{"text":"Our party of 5 had dinner here tonight. The food was average, one of the dishes we ordered penne arribiata w/ sausage had so much chili peppers in the sauce that it was  inedible , had to return it and get a new one. Difference in sauce color was night and day. First one looked like the whole jar of chili pepper flakes was dumped in. Had to ask our sever Bernard 3 times to bring our bread. 3rd time we asked he said that they were in oven and not ready. Which is not true as 2 tables around us (who arrived much later then us) received their bread before their salad, but we finally received ours when we were almost done with our entrees. Bernard came walking by quickly and literally dropped off the bread and mumbled \"your bread ...(couldn't understand the rest)\" as he kept walking towards another table. It had been 10 yrs since we had eaten here, don't think we'll ever be back."}
{"text":"I have always loved The Spaghetti Factory.. the food is still good but our service was possibly the worst I have ever had. We had to ask for everything and waited and waited for him to bring what we had asked for, had to ask the hostess for items because the thing our server did best was disappear. Our dessert was served with the dirty dishes on the table and he failed to bring clean spoons. What a disapointment as we were celebrating a birthday.."}
{"text":"So so on the service.  Traveling on business sat at the bar with every stool open.  Bar tender would not let me eat at the bar because she was busy?  I said I am the only person here? She directed me to the hostess to be seated.  Perhaps she doesn't work on tips? Waiter was great and interior was unique lay out."}
{"text":"The good ol' spaghetti factory's gotta be the safe choice for business lunches; especially when you may not know how many people will show up and whether or not it will fit everyone's dietary preferences. 

I'm on my 6 or 7 visits within the last year and a half - service has ALWAYS been courteous and very professional! The folks in the kitchen must have the formulas worked out - entree always arrive a few minutes after salad plate is cleared in military precision - literally. And if you're lucky they have this minty - chocolate ice cream with nuts to give you all the motivation you'd need to head back to the office!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately this is 'the place ' when it comes to our office lunches. I've been trying very hard to understand why. The pasta is horrible, the service very slow. It takes them about half an hour just to get the order, then the food comes out 10 minutes before we need to leave. I will never understand how this place and Olive Garden can be so popular places. Horrible."}
{"text":"What was I thinking? Well, a place to take two preschoolers for lunch and not go crazy. That seems to be asking alot for a dining experience downtown.

This is honestly the first pasta restaurant that does not know how to make a simple meat sauce. Think Chef Boyardee. I can't even call it bologn....no I can't do it. Oh, and meatballs? What were they thinking."}
{"text":"This was probably one of the weirdest restaurant experiences I've ever had. We called ahead for a reservation but were told we could be put on a phone list that will speed up the wait for a table. We opted for that option since we were on our way. When we arrived we were told it'd just be a couple minutes then shortly after we were directed to the bar to find our own table. 

Our server did his job of taking our order and delivering the food but there was something about him that was weird. On the menu it says every entree includes bread, salad and ice cream. We ordered the garlic cheese bread but didn't receive the other bread, which would be fine if that's standard or if they gave a price break on the cheese bread or something, but the table next to us with the same server received both items with their order. We got our food which ok... I had the veggie lasagna and my boyfriend had the chicken penne. My lasagna was decent but wasn't any better than a $2 lasagna lean cuisine. The chicken penne was crap. The sauce was like watered down paste. After dinner they server asked if we wanted dessert but we had to mention the ice cream that's included.

Now while all this was going on, on the patio there was a woman on the ground who was being attended to by other customers, not the staff. While the woman was laying on the ground, a server actually stepped over her. It was so weird. They brought out her food and just piled it on the table while she's laying on the ground.

All in all, I would not recommend this restaurant. I felt really weird the entire time I was there. If you are looking for Italian, just go to Oregano's. It is so so so much better!"}
{"text":"My fiance and I visit here regularly. Service is always fast and friendly. Drinks and food are always great. We have never had a bad experience. :)"}
{"text":"I've been to a few OSF's and this is the best one so far.  Food is good and predictable, and always an easy choice when no one feels adventurous."}
{"text":"Auch wenn die Factory offensichtlich zu einer Kette gehört, wer nach langen Streifzügen durch Toronto Hunger und dann auch noch Lust auf Pasta & Co. hat, ist hier richtig. & Jugendstil und weniger an ein italienisches Restaurant, aber das stört in diesem Falle nur wenig"}
{"text":"My family of 5 went for dinner on a Saturday night. We had a reservation for 6:30 granted we went early to see if we could be seated earlier but no luck needless to say we did not get seated till almost 7. The hostess staff was rude and had to get the manager involved. My kids did not like to food at all and they love spaghetti and meatballs. Food did not come out hot at all. The food was also average nothing special about it. I would not recommend this place and will not be coming back."}
{"text":"The place is so  beautiful. The decor just gorgeous!! The food was so bad...salad from a bag, meat sauce that tasted just like the the filling of a canned lasagna. The meat balls where ok. I consider my going there a waste of money. Will never go back."}
{"text":"We liked the food we ordered. The service was good and the price was ok."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for years and sitting g in the bar.   Today the bartender said he didn't have time for us even though there was only 2 other parties there.   We went to the front and asked for the manager and the girls at the front said we had to have a reservation to sit in the bar and dint bother getting the manager.   All this happened at 445 in the afternoon.   They were not busy.   Lousy customer service."}
{"text":"From the outside this place looks like it commands attention with its blinding red logo displaying the glorious name, 'Spaghetti Factory'. The street is littered with people outside its doors waiting to get a sweet taste of the euphoria inside. 

Welcome to dread.

After a 45 minue wait with endless tables being open we were removed from the nice looking lobby into a circus.

The decor of this place is very disjointed as if a hoarder use to live here and when it was cleaned up they settled for this look. 

The waiter/waitresses are very easy to talk to but they also forget to do their job, almost arriving at dessert the salad and dinner plates weren't taken back to the kitchen, suffice to say there wasn't enough room on the table. 

The menus really give you a glance of what to expect from the food. The menu is the size of the first page in a newspaper, looks like a print out and is colourless. There aren't any images to help you decide on what food to order like a real menu and then the prices for this food is mind boggling. $16-$32. 

At our table was a penne pasta with chicken, pasta with sausage, steak, and pasta with chicken. All of the portions are ridiculously small and taste very average, mushrooms tasted sickly please avoid them.

The free salad and dessert that comes with every meal is served on a (really) small flat white plate and is drenched with the dressing of your choice. The ice cream is served in a minature goblet and is flavourless.

The best bit of the dinner was the free bread with garlic spread, if for some reason you find yourself here load up on the bread and a drink of your choice. Just don't go."}
{"text":"Zero stars.  Don't waste ur $ or time on this sad place"}
{"text":"Cheap. That's about all that's good. 

Pasta is overcooked and limp. Greasy. Cheap cheese. What else can I say?  Portions are large. It's friendly. I wouldn't go there unless I had to.  You can seriously make pasta at home that will easily be as good as theirs."}
{"text":"I've gone here since I was a child. The food is Ok but the atmosphere is fantastic with an old streetcar you can get a table in and lots of funky old pictures.


 The atmosphere here is really the reason to go. The menu is traditional Italian restaurant and so no surprises though it is still good food.


 I don't know if I love this place because so much of my childhood is wrapped up in going here with my family or because it rocks but either way, it is absolutely worth a visit and inexpensive enough to bring the whole family.


 The most fun is, of course, getting all messy with the tomato sauce ;-)"}
{"text":"The 5 of us all had a GREAT FOOD EXPERIENCE !!!  I had the Veggie Manicotti which was DELICIOUS !!!  A shout out to our server Malia who was friendly, very efficient & extremely attentive to our group's needs !!!!  Ask for Malia to serve you !!!  She is TREMENDOUS !!!!"}
{"text":"food was cold and service terruble. It was only me and I felt like they didn't care. when I said the food was cold they said it is supposed to be that way. the salad was soggy too."}
{"text":"We had a great experience here and will definitely be going back with more people. 

First off, the interiors and seating are great fun. There are multiple 4 person \"tables\" that have oversized wing chairs that could totally pull off a Shelock Holmes costumed foursome and down the middle, multiple tables inside an NYC Tolley. Super fun if you have kids. 

It's a family friendly restaurant and our server was great - a wee bit overloaded and stressed but it was clear she was working as hard as possible. She forgot our fried zucchini and just about passed out in horror- but it was fine because our food came quickly. 

It was all very tasty and each entree came with a salad and a small scoop of ice cream - which was a nice touch. Our family of four- with an appetizer, kids meal, and drinks came to a grand total of $31 (tax included) and we got some leftovers to take home. 

The ice cream (strawberry, pistachio, chocolate) was soooooo good. I only wish my serving had more chocolate. Yum!!"}
{"text":"Being a huge pasta lover, I was really excited to come to this place. But now, I don't think I will ever set foot into that place again. 

I was impressed with the decor, over the top, great character. The waiter was really nice, good service. 

I ordered spaghetti and meatballs, nothing extraordinary but still tasty. The meatballs were a little spicy for my taste though. 

Everything was going well until I left the place and started experiencing strange abdominal pain and had the sudden urge to throw up. 

Got food poisoning here, and because of it had one of the worst nights of my life. So definitely not planning to come back here, ever."}
{"text":"This place looks trashed, inside and out. The floors/carpet are extremely dirty and left my white shoes looking jet black. The pasta is terrible- soggy, tasteless & bland, drowned in cheddar cheese. That's right; CHEDDAR. The soups are watery and the minestrone tastes like canned tomato paste. The lettuce in my salad tasted dry, bitter and old. Everything seems reheated. This was the most disgusting, disappointing restaurant I've ever been to. The only good thing is the garlic butter & bread. It seems like these people don't even try, and they just work to work; and to get paid. The place isn't even clean. This restaurant looks like it could be on kitchen nightmares. I couldn't even finish my plate of food because it was so unappetizing it was making me nauseous, and as soon as I got home I started feeling sick & spent the night vomiting. Please, please, please. Don't bother coming here. Please."}
{"text":"no fresh parmesan cheese? What else is not fresh? great decor, but when we asked for parmesan cheese, it wasn't fresh... I can cook like that at home.  mmm not going back, to many restaurants to go, this was not impressive only for the decor."}
{"text":"Perfect for families looking for a convenient pasta dinner in the heart of downtown, this chain-style restaurant offers a fun environment for kids, ample portions, and remarkable all-inclusive value. Just don't expect fine Italian fare. 

Entrees -- mostly standard pasta dishes -- are generously sized. Spaghetti and meatballs are saucy and moist, and as tasty as you'd expect from a family eatery. This is not a delicately crafted dish that will evoke the essence of southern Italy -- it's just your typical spaghetti and meatballs.

On the other hand, the side dishes included in the meal price disappoint: The garden salad is a small pile of mostly iceberg lettuce, drenched in dressing and garnished with some carrot grating. The minestrone is a small cup of limp-tasting soup. But your family will forgive these shortcomings as they tear into oven-fresh bread smeared with whipped garlic butter. 

Ice cream and coffee/tea, also included with each entree, are a nice touch after the meal. 

Beer, wine, and spirits are served, of course, but if you're looking for a wine list, this isn't your kind of place.

Service is fast, upbeat, and friendly. The elaborate antique-shop decor will enchant the kids. Boisterous school tour groups keep the place lively.

If you're downtown and looking for a convenient family pasta dinner that won't break the bank, this place is great. It's just steps from the Sony Centre and St Lawrence Centre theatres, and only a few minutes from Union Station and the Hockey Hall of Fame.

Alternatively, grown-ups craving real Italian food, executed with skill and subtlety, and paired with well-crafted cocktails and fine wines, will do much better at the bustling Terroni restaurant (minutes away at Adelaide and Church Streets) -- where they will easily pay two or three times as much for a satisfying meal."}
{"text":"Had dinner here tonight with two other people and overall had a nice experience. Was busy but wait was not too long, food was good and the service was excellent. Our server was Tim, very attentive and has a great sense of humour. Oh and the decor is super cute!"}
{"text":"I took my kids here - this was our third trip.  Overall we had a nice night - but here is my feedback:

1) Menu is too limited
2) I orded an $8.00 salad - it was super small - way over priced 
3) Could be cleaner

Generally, I think you go because it is pretty kid friendly and fun.....I would go back but with lower expectations."}
{"text":"I don't know what they were shooting for with the decor, but what ever you are hoping your restaurant will look like I'm sure they have a place in there that will mach.
The service was friendly and I enjoyed the various surroundings. But the food was sadly not up to par. I could make better spaghetti at home."}
{"text":"fantastic food!!! Me and my girlfriend loved it!!!

prices were fair, for the quality of the food, and fantastic service.

will definitely come back again soon!"}
{"text":"Brought my daughters for lunch.  Chicken and mozzarella panini was good,  broccoli soup was outstanding,  decor was cool.  Salad was basic,  asked for dressing on side,  it came drenched.  Sauce on ravioli just okay"}
{"text":"I have absolutely nothing good to say about this restaurant from start to finish.  Hostess obviously does not like her job nor the people walking in.  Waiters are just overwhelmed which means your service is awful.  And the food is bland and either over salted or tasteless.
Stay away.  Tourist TRAP!"}
{"text":"Love the Mitzithra! Good food at a good price but there is almost always a wait. 
Each entree comes with soup or salad, drink and dessert so you get plenty to eat. Their kids menu is also quite extensive so it is great for families and groups."}
{"text":"I often get take out from here. I always get the Gluten Friendly Alfredo with shrimp. Tonight when I went to pick up my order the hostess let me know that the cooks packaged my shrimp in a different container than the pasta because it wasn't Gluten Free. KUDOS to whomever caught this! I am extremely grateful and now know to order chicken instead. I really thank the person that put two and two together (gf pasta+ not gf shrimp)."}
{"text":"Personally, me and my loved ones have nothing but great things to say about this place.  
I really never write reviews. This is my first, but when I saw the feedbacks I just had to step in.  
My husband and I have been going there since we moved into the area. Their meals are a great value. 11.79 for a very reasonable portion of your entree ( if you are a big eater you will have to pay a little extra for the hearty portion); and it also comes with a soup or salad, bread and a little scoop of ice cream for desert. Really? I was reading the complains and I was just cracking up because some were complaining about the price lol
Anyway, we love this place so much that we had our rehearsal dinner here and the service was extremely accommodating and patient. For whatever reason people at my party of 40 came in waves. They all were from out of town so we couldn't make it all at the same time. They still were patient and gave is great great service. Gave us time to mingle and once we ordered, food was right out. We had a great time that eve and all the other eves that we been there. 
The decorations is highly pleasant to the eyes. The details in every corner are just very delightful and entertaining."}
{"text":"On our visit to Toronto, The Old Spaghetti Factory was recommended.  However, we experienced cold food and poor service. I would not recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I love this place, the food is good always when I go eespecially for the moderate price. Though the noise I hate the noise and screaming children. They need an adult section, but I do love it anyhow, the portions good and foods fresh. Service is good and what I would expect with any restaurant thats super packed and busy. 
Also only a few minutes walk from the Subway station."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this review a 3.5. This place has amazing food and definitely good Italian food that isn't typical Olive Garden. I always ate at the location in Fullerton and New Port Beach both in California and when I found this one in Phoenix I was thrilled. 

The service, however, wasn't too great. We sat at a very awkward table behind a pillar in the restaurant and did not even get acknowledged until about 10 minutes of sitting there. We simply ordered 2 waters and cheesy garlic bread to start and the bread came out before our waters. The service the rest of night was extremely slow and there was a crowd of guests being extremely rude and obnoxious the entire night. 

I will go back because I love the food so much and you get a lot to eat, but the service needs some work."}
{"text":"We had a poor dining experience from the time we entered the restaurant to the time we left.  I contacted them via email and wrote the following:

Last night at roughly 5:30pm (1/15/17) our family had dinner at your Phoenix location.  The service we received was poor at best and the management just as bad.  Our server failed on so many levels I don't know where to start.  Our meals were brought out before our salads and bread, my daughter's meatball was forgotten, and our server was missing in action most of the evening.  It was so bad that we had to ask the bussers for our missing food items, go boxes and silverware.  In fact, at the end of the meal we had to ask for the spumoni ice cream and a go box from our waitress.  After she brought it out, with the check and no go box, we asked for spoons.  After 5 minutes with our server nowhere in sight I got up, found a busboy, and got the silverware.  This was a full 10 minutes after we got the dessert.  Several more minutes passed and our server was still nowhere to be found so I took the check to the front, spoke with a host and asked if he could cash us out since our waitress was MIA.  A woman standing next to him said she would handle it. 

After the bill was paid taken we asked to speak with a manager.  Turns out, the women who handled the bill was the manager.  She came to our table, put the check down and left without saying a word.   I would think if a customer came to the front like I did a manager might want to find out what was going on and speak to the customer about it.  Not this manager, it was pretty clear she could care less.  When she came back we voiced our displeasure with the service and were told that she had spoken with the server about coming back and checking on us.  I told her no one did to which she replied she did what she could.  The manager was indifferent to us, looked hurried and troubled and made lots of excuses.  She was dismissive of her demeanor, the poor service, and displayed an attitude of total disregard for us.  On our way out we passed by her and some of the front staff and were glared at as we exited.  Not a goodbye, thanks for coming, or how was your meal, just stares, and bad body language.

When we got home I went online and read some of the recent reviews for this location.  Turns out many people have experienced the same poor service and management my family and I did. You should know that we have been customers for 20+ years.  Sad to say, that we will not be coming back.  There are so many options available, why would anyone want to come back?

It should be noted, management emailed me and invited us back."}
{"text":"My cup was dirty service was slow.
I,had a party of twenty 
Food was Luke warm or cold.
Bread was hard 
Pasta sauce is no different from store bought.

It should shut down the kitchen,and,just turn,the place,onto a museum"}
{"text":"Definitely a \"meh\" kind of place. I ordered the half and half (spaghetti with meat sauce and spinach ravioli). The meat sauce was very salty and bland. The ravioli was akin to the kind I imagine you would buy from the freezer section at Wal-Mart. The bread tasted like saltine crackers. The service was very good however and the spumoni ice cream was good. My bf really liked the fettucine alfredo. They did offer to replace my entree with something else since I didn't eat it, so I got some fettucine alfredo to go. I have a Groupon to come here with my son for a murder mystery dinner in a few weeks...hopefully the food then will be better."}
{"text":"The chicken parmesian is very good. The cable car table experience is cute. Great atmosphere. The waiter we had wasn't the best, but also he wasn't the worst. I would recommend this if you want a different classic Italian experience. Moderate revisiting value."}
{"text":"My first time hear and It was very good but not the greatest. I had the chicken fettuccini it could use more Alfredo souce I had to ask for some on the side but the bread is so good I loved it.

I also liked the setting around me it was very cool and different!"}
{"text":"The environment is cool, but the food is just so so.  My chicken was a little tough, glad the bill wasn't or there woud have been an issue.  Get what ya pay for!  The short brunette girl did give attentive service though, two thumbs up in that aspect."}
{"text":"What a dump! I felt like I just walked into 1313 Mockingbird Lane (The Munster's house) Bizarre decor, old dusty chandeliers, creaky old wood floors and Mexican style colors on the walls. The booths were almost Old English style and I was waiting for the guy in the protective armour to pop out any minute. Service was SLOW for not a busy night. The bathrooms were disgusting. and there were homeless guys out front begging for leftovers. STAY AWAY!!!"}
{"text":"I have been to plenty of spaghetti factory restaurants in Cali, but none were as good as this place. The service was excellent, and the food was delicious. The prices are superb as well."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a really nice meal with wife, kids and a buddy.  Drinks were cold, food was hot, prices were Toronto reasonable. I recommend."}
{"text":"OK of a setting, semi decent food, and bad service.

Went here yesterday and an OK experience just like most of the places downtown. The menu doesn't have a whole lot of spaghetti in it but it's s decent menu and the food is better than average. As for the setting I think it's a good setting for groups. 

From there on it seems downhill. When we ordered the food they didn't bring the complimentry bread that the menu clearly stated that we were suppose to get. I'm not crazy about bread or anything and it's not a big issue. But if you aren't going to give it why say so in the menu. Our waitress was no where to be seen for the most of the time so we flagged a random waiter and asked. He said he will find out what happened to it and left and we never saw him again. Another 15-20 mins later our waitress returned with the bread but she had forgotten the drink that somone in my table had asked for. That drink came about an hour later since it was first ordered. 

Oh and pay with cash if you are in the patio because the portable CC mechine doesn't have very good reception outside. 

At least their pricing wasn't bad for being downtown."}
{"text":"First off the food was delicious, but the service was terrible.  Can someone please explain to me why our server would leave an empty glass behind when brining a fresh drink?  This cocky kid would not grab an empty glass or plate to save his life. After 12 plates piled up I finally asked a hostess to grab all the empty dishes.  Service is very important to me, once again the food was great but I will not go back."}
{"text":"For a place called \"Spaghetti\" factory, I would have expected more from their spaghetti. I've gone a few times, and my pasta have always been over-cooked or dry. The prices are also quite high considering what you're paying for. 

I will say though that this place is excellent for accomodating large groups. So, the next time I'm forced to go, I will order steak."}
{"text":"Used to come here quite frequently. Haven't been able to make it in for awhile but decided to come here after a show, worst customer service and treatment, zero tact. Will never return and will advise all my friends to do the same."}
{"text":"Came here on a saturday night without reservations. The manager kept saying \"worst case scenario 20-25 mins\" so we waited for about 50... chrckrd in and they said they gave our table away as they thought we werent all here...? So we were about to just leave an go to another resturant but then they seated us right away.

Food was really really really bad.... i felt liek i was eating from a soup kitchen.
Server was good , quick and polite.
I went home around 830 and threw up and had direhea by 11:30... i m not sure how clean this place is. I will never be back."}
{"text":"I have been going here since I was a little girl! Lately, the service hasn't been great but still love The Manager's Favorite and good prices.
Today, we ordered the appetizer Burger Sliders- what came was 1 meatball on a bun. We sent it back being there was nothing on it (caramelized onions) and confused cause it didn't mention meatball, just was supposed to be burger sliders like anyplace you order. We flagged down a manager and him and our server brought back with onions, but insisted that's how it's supposed to be. When leaving, we mention to a different manager (Stefan) and he totally agreed with us. There's a new menu coming, but still not excusable that what we got was definitely not BURGER sliders (no matter how much the other manager,server, and hostess was trying to convince us meatballs are basically the same thing!) Stefan took care of us with offering to give us our money back and a coupon for next time. He saved this trip from us not wanting to come back!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner here on a Tuesday night (recommended close to hotel).  First chair I sat in, the springs were completely out (sunk in).  Changed seats, and ok.  All entrees come with soup or salad; bread; coffee, tea, or milk; and a small dollop of ice cream for dessert.  The baked lasagna was good, along with the salad, although I've tasted better sauces for the lasagna.  The bread was not as good as say Outback Steakhouse bread either.  Overall though, good food and reasonably priced for all you get (you won't leave hungry)."}
{"text":"With a name like Old Spaghetti Factory, you figured you best be wearing elastic waist band pants for something epic that can rival your mom's recipe. Well, if your mom is a blind woman whose nose and tongue were burned off at a young age, sure, I *guess* Old Spaghetti Factory can trump that. But I'm deeming it mediocre at best!

I've been there more than once and not because it was my choice but because I have this bad habit of wanting to hang out with friends who clearly have questionable taste. Once you weave your way through the restaurant that is cluttered with stain glass windows, a carousel and a trolley car, you're presented with an olde timey newpaper-esque menu which is cute with descriptions that would instantly make your mouth water. However, the pay-off is an underwhelming pasta dish, spaghetti or otherwise.

I know most people might have a sentimental attachment to this place but alas I didn't  and came in with a cynical and judgmental adult point of view. So unfortunately the only bit of nostalgia I get with the food here is when I regurgitate it later that evening."}
{"text":"Old spaghetti factory is the best  Everything I've tried from here was really good, and comes out in about 10 minutes. The place is always clean, and the bathrooms are up kept nicely. The place has a really good atmosphere, and pretty reasonable prices. The complementary sourdough bread is delicious, and the butter has a hint of garlic, which is soo good. After your meal, they offer vanilla, chocolate and spomoni ice-cream. The place can get packed around normal meal times, but the longest wait I've had is about 15 minutes. The staff is very nice and professional, and the manager occasionally drops by to make sure everything is perfect. We had a hardy portion of the Mizzethra spaghetti, but it had a bit too much butter on it. The manager came out and got us a completely new plate within 5 minutes. Lovely restaurant!"}
{"text":"The dinner was paid for so I'm reviewing quite lightly but they still only get two stars.

The place is really big and close to Subway although due to construction they are hard to access from the street.

I ordered an ice cap, popcorn shrimp app and prime ribs with spaghetti. The shrimp was great! The amount of food for entree was highly disappointing. It's pretty much a blob of spaghetti sauce on some half done noodles with two (pretty sure previously frozen) small ribs on the side.

Wouldn't go back of I had the chance."}
{"text":"Why did we go again? 

I thought we had all written this place off forever the last time we were here, a year ago. But, the growing granddaughter is six and wanted sooo much to go back with her extended family of seven adults

It took 1 h 35 min on a slow Sunday night before we finally got our main dish. Needless to say, more than the six year old were totally starved and almost screaming for attention.

The waitress had no idea of who had ordered what and my not even know what we had ordered at all...

The food is just not even worth what we paid for it.

Now it's over. Will get together somehere else. After having patronized this reastaurant, off an on for some 40 years, we are \"outta here\". 

GOOD BYE."}
{"text":"One of my all-time favourite places to eat in Toronto! Been coming to the OSF for many years. I love the Spaghetti with Burnt Butter and Mizithra Cheese a la Homer. Yum!  The decor is uniquely beautiful and the service excellent!"}
{"text":"I went in with high expectations for this place having heard of good things about the chain in general. The food was pretty decent, but the reason for the one star was the service. Our waiter seemed very disgruntled and disengaged with us the whole time, even blatantly ignoring us to carry on a conversation with a different table. When it came time to pay we paid in cash, with the intent of giving a tip. However our waiter just took our money without giving us the option of receiving change back. Very bad experience and won't be looking to go to any of these restaurants again."}
{"text":"Not really impressed with this place. The bathrooms were dirty. No toilet paper. The food was flavorless tasted liked the generic lasagna that you buy at Walmart. Stay away from the water taste a bit funny."}
{"text":"We ate here tonight in celebration of a family members birthday.  Unfortunately the quality of food makes me give this restaurant only 1 star.  The staff was very friendly, don't get me wrong, it was the food and food alone that makes me give this place such a low rating.

I ordered the Chicken Parmesan with a side salad.  The salad tasted like it came out of a plastic bag 2 minutes ago and was covered in Wishbone salad dressing (and I am sorry, that is a slam to Wishbone, that would have tasted better).  No freshly made salads or dressings in house I can guarantee you that.

The sourdough bread was definitely from a frozen loaf, it had this weird color/texture.  But, of all the food I had, this tasted the best (which isn't saying much).

The chicken parmesan was cooked fine, chicken moist, but it had the weirdest breading on it.  Totally tasted (again) that it came from frozen.  My family eats very natural, no preservatives and I could literally taste the MSG, HFCS, trans fat that these food items had in them (which is probably why I only ate half my meal bc I was starving).  

My husband had the spaghetti with meat sauce.  Again, bland, tasted canned/frozen.

In conclusion, if you want fast, cheap, highly processed \"Italian\" food, this is your place.  If you want Italian food that is freshly made and prepped onsite, run, run as fast as you can from OSF....."}
{"text":"I've loved the OSF for the last 20 years.  The food has never been the best I've had and the quality seems to have diminished over the years but I'm still a fan, nonetheless, and would give them a solid 3.5 (had to round it up to 4 due to yelp's lack of half scores).

During my college years, me and my partners in crime would eat at OSF at least once a month. leave fully satisfied with leftovers all under $20 for us three.  Obviously, the price has changed over the years, but it is still very affordable and satisfying. 

All of their entrees (priced between $10-13) come with a drink (coffee, tea or milk), unlimited fresh baked bread (accompanied by regular and garlic butter), choice of soup or salad AND a scoop of spumoni ice cream.  Perfect for those on a budget!  The portion sizes have decreased over the years, but that is actually a good thing.  

My fav is the Spinach Tortellini with Alfredo sauce with a side of Mizithra cheese... yum!  Unfortunately, they no longer offer fresh pepper at table side.  Really?  How expensive can that be fo provide?  This discounted practice really chops my hide!

My college gf came to town and for nostalgia wanted to eat at OSF.  We met a couple of friends there.  Everyone enjoyed their meals (spinach tortellini, garlic mizithra and crab ravioli).  We also enjoyed the garlic cheese bread appetizer.   

The OSF is definitely a great place for individuals or families on a budget.  The train car in the restaurant is always a hit with the kiddies.  Definitely, not real Italian food but I love it!"}
{"text":"When we first got there it was lunch time around 1:30pm.. We were told a 5 minute wait. However, that didn't happen. We waiting about 20 min when it wasn't busy. We finally sat.. Long story short the food was good. But the service was very slow and it sucked. The waitress took the bread off from the table while we were still eating it. We asked for straws and she didn't have any. So she turned around and took the ones from the table next to us. The people from that table left when we sat.. Their table was still dirty. 
Maybe we just went on a wrong day or time"}
{"text":"To make a long story short my partner and I received a gift card for Old Spaghetti Factory. Usually, we go to the location in Central Phoenix, but I wanted to check out the newer location at Chandler Fashion Mall. It is located in the old \"Gardunos\" restaurant building.

The first thing that impressed me was that the lighting was 150% better than the previous restaurant.  Old Spaghetti Factory is not fancy or pretentious and very affordable. For the 2 of us the total bill was $26.00.  We opted to sit in the lounge/bar area, usually I am leery of sitting in that section at any restaurant due to lousy service. We were pleasantly surprised by the capable hostess/bartender who was working that night. She handled all the food and drink orders for the whole section with great professionalism. If any criticism can be made of the food it would be that the salad was very generic, but other than that it was a great dining experience. I had crab stuffed ravioli, very tasty indeed! The best part is that dessert (ice cream or sherbert) is included in the price of an entree. We will definitely eat there again."}
{"text":"It USED TO BE so good
now it just tastes so commercial not at all like it used too.
before it was like a grandma was in the kitchen cooking for all her family but now it tastes frozen and not unique.. I'm going to miss it the way it was."}
{"text":"It has great environment and service. The food is good but not good enough to win 5 stars."}
{"text":"Overpriced and underimpressed!

While the wait staff is friendly, courteous and very efficient, the food sucks.  I paid over $10 for a \"shrimp\" salad that was 1 head of dressed butterleaf lettuce, 10 croutons, a few sliced cherry tomatoes and 8 shrimps - NOT marinated as promised.  A joke of a salad.

Every time we visit this establishment (per the behest of visiting parents) I'm less and less impressed.

Next time the folks are in town, we'll be seeking out a different restaurant."}
{"text":"I am sorry but I am reading some of the reviews on this place and I gotta tell you, are you people Nuts!  OK I can totally understand giving 1 star because you walked in and got ignored, however did you walk up and ask for a table. Seems a little weird that three people would just have a staring contest with you. It is possible, but not really probable.  Secondly, people griping about the PRICE.... ARE YOU SMOKING DOPE.... The basic meals here are between 10 and 15 bucks and INCLUDE DRINKS. 

I read about people bitching about how bland it is.... Of course it's bland its a Family Eatery. They have to keep the basic food bland to suit all clientele. You can certainly request a little more this or that. NO this is not going to be the place to have a formal dinner with your grandmother from Italy. Yes, you will be put out that your dinner was not comparable to Tomaso's  which is a 15-25 dollar a plate spaghetti shop not INCLUDING DRINKS.  The food is on par with Olive Garden though the menu is not as deep. 

You go to this place when its nice to have a night out, but you don't want to spend 60 bucks on a dinner for two. You go to this place when your a high school kid that wants to take his date out  and go to a movie or shopping over at the fashion square. You go to this place when you want a nice value dinner that includes a great ambiance,  a nice staff, and a fun location for activities afterward."}
{"text":"The reason I'm giving this place a two star is because of all the waiting we did throughout our evening there. Once we got there, we waited about 30min to be seated and a table of four people who got there after us, got seated before us. We were upset but we just brushed it off.. Once it was our time, one of the lovely host sat us and was very nice to us. Then, we waited again, another 15 min went by, our server finally introduced myself and took our drink order. Ok, he dropped it off and we waited again for him to take our food order.. After that, we looked around because we haven't been to this place, only in Chandler. Had a nice conversation with my family, good laughs. I Seen people got there food before us, kind of made me mad because our server was slacking! and wasn't on top of things.. Yes! Our food arrived... Became unsatisfied  I'm not very fond of garlic, Their it was all over my Angel hairs and chicken.. If my mother in law, kindness wasn't there. He wouldn't have gotten that 9$ tip from my man or me.. Not coming back again. I had a bad feeling about this place from the start.."}
{"text":"SURPRISE, SURPRISE.  GIVE THIS PLACE ANOTHER LOOK.  OK, so my son begged us to go here.  It has always been a fun family destination...but great food???  Nahhh.  Boy, I was wrong.  I asked the server for something light.  He recommended the crab ravioli.  It is in a green pesto sauce.  I would have posted a photo...except I ate it so fast it was all gone before I could take a picture.  My son's meat lover's spaghetti platter was \"good\" and met his needs.  I thought his meatballs were too salty and lacked a fresh garlic-herb burst of flavor that I think sets an outstanding meatball apart from the \"average\".  The Italian sausage was excellent.  The spaghetti was quite good.  My wife had a shrimp salad and it was well above average.  Service was good.  The atmosphere is eclectic and fun.  I am going back for the crab ravioli.  It is a new favorite dish."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE! Service, ambiance, food....you name it! We won't be back. The food is super basic and over priced. I found multiple hairs in my salad. All the manager did was apologize and offer me ANOTHER salad (no thank you!) our server was 19 years old and headed out of town on a red eye flight later that night. All he could talk about was how hectic and terrible his day had been and how it was transferring into his shift. Definitely could've and would've spent our money elsewhere that night had we known."}
{"text":"nice atmosphere and the staff are usually nice and accommodating
pretty expensive base on the portion size, but i'm a student so what did i expect lmao
that manicotti though"}
{"text":"Overcooked pasta, check. Slopped on sauce. Check. Average garlic bread. Check. Crowds of families thinking it's fab. Whatever. 

Look people, al dente and toss the Alfredo on the noodle. It's not all bad, but if I want to go shabby chic and chow with the family it's okay. Not my deal, though. I like Italian served in sexy dark corners of the room with my honey."}
{"text":"Mediocre Italian food with bad service. East Side Mario's is classy compared to this place. Tourist trap for sure. Not many options in this area that are family friendly"}
{"text":"The Old Spaghetti Factory is a great choice for dinner espessally on Sundays because they usually have good deals that include salad and ice cream! The atmosphere is great, the server's are very nice and the food is always tastey! Almost Everytime my girlfriend and I come on Sundays, Henry always takes our orders and is a really outstanding guy! He's polite, very upbeat and is always attentive to his guests. We will always be back for more!"}
{"text":"I've loved Old Spaghetti Factory (Spaghetti Company) for 20+ years. The Mizithra/Garlic Butter is so tasty. Prices are really reasonable and service friendly if not always perfect. I give them 4 stars for great value, quirky fun ambience, good basic menu."}
{"text":"I am not sure what the fuss is about this place. I will give it points for a unique interior; I mean it is not very often that you can eat a plate of spaghetti while sitting in a giant velvet throne, but the food is very ho hum. I grabbed dinner there with some friends before heading to a concert in Glendale, the concert was after work, and it was a good middle meeting place. 

For being an Italian restaurant, I thought the menu was really limited....nothing really unique, mostly just pasta and sauce combinations. The salad that you get with your meal is just the cheapo iceberg, which is not even worth eating. 

Also, they advertise that they can make any of their pastas gluten-free, which excited my sister, but when she tried to order, she was informed that the only gluten-free sauce they have is the tomato, so she went with just a salad, once again, chock full of that icky iceberg lettuce. 

There is way better Italian food out there people!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, the waitor was really friendly. Food, or at least the bread and butter came proptly. The plate was a decent portion for your money. The place was really quirky, and felt like a carousel exploded in there. The old streetcar was fun to eat in
It's kid friendly, not over the top pricing and had great food. Although it is a Italian place I was expecting more of a variety, but no, strictly Italian. Most of the meals come with icecream, tea/coffee, salad or soup
Pretty great spot for a date or a family outing, they're apparently really great with large groups. No portable debit machine so you have to pay at the bar.
Highly recommended, will definitely return again."}
{"text":"I went there with a group of 50.  The waitresses are friendly and able to get everyone in and out in less than 2 hours.  We were all ordering off a la carte, it wasn't that we have limited menu, but yet the food all came at the same time and everyone is happy."}
{"text":"It hurts me to write this since this is place has such wonderful memories. But for the past few years the food has become tasteless and service less than lackluster. Even with this I still would come bringing my family trying to relive my happy childhood  memories.  So on Saturday  4/11/2015 my family  and I drove the 25 miles to get there and when we arrive there was a few families  waiting. I checked our family  in at 5pm for a party of 7 and the hostess stated it will be a 45 min wait. I agreed and as 5:45 came around my dad went to check to see if they ready for us. He came back and stated that they told him another 15 minutes. As we are waiting the restaurant  starts filling up and we notice many families  that came after us were being seated. At 6:00 pm I went to check to see much longer and the hostess looked at the clipboard and stated it will be another 20 mins. I couldn't believe it, and what was worse there were names below mine that were highlighted off because they have been seated. The hostess stated that they had reservations and we should have called since our party was so big. I requested a manager and one came out and i expressed my issue but the manager whose name is not even worth mentioning gave a heartless apology and stated it will be another  20 minutes.  With that I thanked him for his time grabbed my family and walked out. So friendly tip if you have a party of 7 or more call in for a reservation otherwise  prepare to wait."}
{"text":"So I went yesterday with some friends for their 40th Anniversary. They had good deals going on pretty much 50% off of a few dishes So I had \"Half Spaghetti With White Clam Sauce & Half Meat Sauce With A Meatball\" The pasta was $3.95 the Meatball was $3.75 they say they give you two but its really only one that they cut in half. So to be honest even at Half price for the Pasta I felt like I paid to much Pasta was under cooked no flavor in the Meat Sauce the Clam Sauce was the worst I had took one bite sent it back. I understand it was their Anniversary and they had half of food so they didn't put there all into it but it wasn't busy at all so the the food should have not been under cooked. You would think knowing that people are gonna come you would want to entice them to come back. It was my first and last time going here sad to say."}
{"text":"Over priced and not worth the money. Very bland food and I would not go back. Too many other great restaurants in the area to choose from...the only part I enjoyed was the warm bread and the bubble gym machine on the way out..."}
{"text":"This place is excellent. I called ahead for a rather large party and the employees were very accommodating. Our table was set up when we arrived and they allowed us to decorate for the birthday we were celebrating. Our server Noah was awesome, always checking up on us and filling our drinks. Food was excellent. Will be back :)"}
{"text":"Ok...we ALWAYS have the best time when we come here and last night was no exception!  Christopher behind the bar was so fun and he smiles all the time and his customer service skills really are genuine and sincere.  Thank you Christopher! Old Spaghetti Factory is lucky to have you.
The food was awesome...haven't had the brown butter and manicotti before but OMG was it amazing. I mixed mine with the clam sauce...and had a side salad...all were so good.  Thank you...we will be back."}
{"text":"When anyone complains about a cheap dinner, then you shouldnt be going out to eat. Under 13.00 is the max. And all the trimmings. Drink-S/S-entries-desert/icecre-bread
 Realy? Dont be Cheap scate. Dont forget to to TIP. you get all this food and the server has to RUN their ass off for you. 
For those thinking about working here, be prepaired to wear your running shoes. If this place were any faster, they would have drive through. 
No shit

The tips suck
 The guest are broke, or old. They're here for a cheap feeding. 
At lunch all the guest want to be in and out in 30-45. Be prepaired to not make shit in tips.

For any guest reading this, you should remember what TIPs stands - to (in) sure promt service.
If you cant afford to tip, you sgouldnt be going out for full service dinning. 

For thoes who are critical about the food??? For Christ sakes -- look at the prices. Your not gonna get 4-5 star food for what your paying for. 
Lastly - why dont those of you who bring your kids, why do you allow them to to MAKE SUCH A MESS.  Thats disgusting and makes tje servers job harder. 
AND - YOU SHOULD TIP ACCORDING TO HOW MUCH YOU ATE.  The menu certainty doesnt reflect the true value of how hard your server worked to keep you satisfied."}
{"text":"I grew up going to the Old Spaghetti Factory in Gastown, in Vancouver. My boyfriend and I made the Calgary location our date night destination tonight. I had never been to this location. What a disappointment. The wait was reasonable:15 minutes. However, the hostess offered us full menu service and a \"GREAT server\" in the lounge, so we took her up on it. 

To start, the air-conditioning seemed to be on full. Even on a warm-ish February night, it was overkill, and I had to keep my coat on. The server was friendly, if a little over-eager to up-sell every part of our meal. We ordered full meals and extra drinks. Our soup/salad arrived timely, but without the yummy sourdough bread that is a signature (and INCLUDED) part of Spaghetti Factory meals. We finished our starters, and were halfway through our entrees (which were cooked well, and arrived hot), when we expressed our curiousity about the bread. We were informed that we could have it if we wanted it. We did, and they brought it without an apology for the wait. There was no salt/pepper, nor was it offered. 

We finished our meals and drinks when our server brought the bill. Again we expressed curiousity about the INCLUDED coffee/tea & ice cream. We were again informed that we could have it if we wanted it. We did. Coffee was brought, but the ice cream never arrived. After 20 minutes, coffees were finished, and we were tired of waiting. 

When we expressed our disappointment in the lackluster service at the front, the same hostess explained that the lounge server was 'unique' and that things are a little different in the lounge. When we stated that had we known this upfront, we would have gladly waited the 15 minutes for a table, she did apologize, but that was the end of it. No offer for a discount. No effort to correct the service. We told them we will never be back. 
And we never will. I will gladly wait for the few times I visit Vancouver and go for the original, quality experience"}
{"text":"I have such great memories as a child going to Old Spaghetti Factory in San Diego and Seattle. I've now realized those memories are most certainly due to the environment; for that, I give it three stars. It certainly is a good place to take a large group with kids every year or two.

I give it two stars for the food. Not a good thing when you don't enjoy the spaghetti at a place called the Old Spaghetti Factory."}
{"text":"This is a good place to go to if you want decent meal and service with reasonable price. I don't really have much to complain about this place except the restaurant can get a little loud coz whenever we go it's always packed! Weird enough we still get seated pretty quickly (under 2 minute wait) and service is good!"}
{"text":"Went there again! This time i had the factory ravioli, and raspberry lemonade ! SWEET JESUS! It was heaven in my mouth! I'd live here if I could

I wish yelp would allow me to give this place 10 stars"}
{"text":"Tonight was my first time there with my boyfriend and we had a great time. Food is SUPER cheap considering the fact that you are dinning in a unique decorated restaurant like this.  The meals are range from $11 (pasta) - $25 (steak) all come with soup/salad + tea + ice cream.  The foods are not bad but nothing surprisingly good either (just pasta, probably I can make something similar).  Service is really good.  Even with all those decorations, we are still able to see our server walking around (unlike some places like Moxie the servers just ignore you).  
The only one tinny problem we had today was the \"wait to be seated buzzer\".  We totally missed the signal (ended up waited 20mins for nothing).  The server noticed the same problem with other customers in the past too... then why they didn't they fix it...??!!  We weren't pissed because they were very nice and gave us a table right away."}
{"text":"The atmosphere and the service are great. Loved the carousel, chandeliers, and other decor they had. 

The food was good but nothing special."}
{"text":"Loved it!  Reasonably priced.  Lots of food!  And I like the atmosphere/setting."}
{"text":"I gave it 3 stars for the private room they have for a group to meet in which was great. The taste of the food was blah. That would've brought it down to 1 or 2 stars."}
{"text":"Not a bad place to go on a busy Saturday night with no reservation.  Got in quite quickly with 4 people.   Beer was good and pasta was okay. Ordered the Pot pourri which was spaghetti with 3 different sauces; white sauce, marinara sauce, & meat sauce.   Was disappointed that all three sauces came on the same plate as they pretty much all ran together and it was hard to taste the differences between them.  I would have preferred them to come each in their own separate section.  Probably would not have ordered it if I realized it.  The meat sauce was delicious. Overall not bad.  With the dinners you receive a starter and dessert and bread as well.  The starters were pretty good.  We had a nice soup and a salad and split it.  The desert was ice cream and it was a perfect end to a filling dinner.  I don't think I could have eaten much more!"}
{"text":"When you go to the Old Spaghetti factory, it's rarely just for the food. 

The overall experience is usually what keeps the customers coming back for me. It's a great novelty type place if you have out of city guests or know someone who hasn't been there before. 

Service is generally pretty good, which is nice. Christian (if you see this) is an experienced and personable host. He was our waited the last time I was there and it was an enjoyable experience. Thanks. 

The meals are way overpriced for what it's worth. It's nice that salad and ice cream are included but that hardly justifies paying $20 for a mediocre dish. I've tried a few dishes from their menu and I haven't been truly satisfied by any. That is to say, I wouldn't but any of those dishes again. 

I wouldn't come here often since the food isn't anything to rave about and the prices are too darn high but If I'm bored or hear of someone who hasn't gone, I'd probably visit again in the future."}
{"text":"Not impressed at all. Went here for lunch  with a largish group today. We had called ahead about 30 mins before to let them know and they said that although it was too late to make a reservation it wouldn't be a problem to seat us. So we get there and it takes about 15 mins to seat us even though the restaurant is not that busy and smaller parties are getting seated before us. Okay, fine. 

Then we get seated and it takes us another 20 mins and a chase down with a waiter for us to get our order taken and even get water. Our food came out fast enough after that point and the waitress was great about dividing the check but it seriously should not take 35 mins to get your order taken on a Thursday afternoon at a restaurant like this."}
{"text":"My family have been going to the Spaghetti Factory for the past 40 years for birthdays, people visiting from overseas and just going down for a good dining experience. You can't go wrong with having a 4 course meal; bread, main meal, ice cream and tea or coffee  for a reasonable price. The specials are quite good as well. We try to go just before the busy dinner hour or later in the evening to avoid the lineups."}
{"text":"A good friend of mine is a big fan of this restaurant so on a recent trip to Toronto she suggested we had down to the Esplanade so I could check it out.

My first impression was the atmosphere. Granted, it was a little dark for me but it was also cozy and there was so much to look at. For instance,  they have an old street car you can sit in,  an old style phone booth and a giant carousel. 

The wait staff was friendly and intuitive. They must have sensed that my friend and I have not seen each other in quite some time so they seated us in a quiet booth so we could catch up. 

The staff also knew exactly when to refill our drinks and understood that we appreciated being left alone until we were ready to order. 

The food was excellent! I ordered the sphagetti Alfredo. It came with unlimited bread,  coffee,  and tea as well as a starter salad/soup and dessert for only about $16! 

Lastly,  I noticed that the restaurant was exceptionally clean and everyone we met seemed genuinely happy to be working there. 

I highly recommend the Old Spaghetti Factory to everyone and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I ordered gluten free pasta and the chicken marsala. Everything tasted great and service was good.  If you order the three course meal it comes with spumoni for dessert which was delicious. Ambiance is a bit franchised but for the price and flavor it's pretty good."}
{"text":"I've only been here twice, after the annual City of Phoenix Bicycle Summit, which happens @ Burton Barr Public Library.  I enjoy the size of the place, and the eclectic decor.  The service was ok.  The food was fine.  The first year we ate there after the summit, I was upset by the lack of bicycle parking.  I ended up locking my bike to a pipe behind the restaurant and worrying the whole time. 

This year, my friend Joseph had a bicycle rack in his truck.  It was a special bike rack that the city offered to local businesses.  He pulled it out of his truck and put it in front of the restaurant.  We locked up and went in to eat.  When we finished, we returned to find that a couple of bikes who were not in our party had locked up to the rack.

We found the manager of the restaurant, and he and Joseph worked out the details for maintaining the safety of the rack and returning it to its rightful owner.  As we unlocked our bikes, a party of 10-12 bicyclists from the neighborhood pulled in and waited for us to vacate the rack.  Bicycle racks bring business, yo!"}
{"text":"Maybe I came when the flavours started to erupt from simmering! I went at 12pm and out of the 6 time i've been here at random times, it was one of the best and very fresh!

Our server's name was Doreen if I remember correctly and had such great charisma and catered to our needs.

I got the manager's special with a mixture of mushroom tarragon and clam sauce, and my date got the spaghetti and meatball.

spaghetti and meatball -4/5, Having recently come back from Cannes which is a 30 minute train ride from Italy, the sauce was pretty much the same thing I was eating in Cannes! I will definitely be back for the regular tomato sauce when I'm feeling France-sick. The meatball was just meh, I truly enjoyed the sauce.

mushroom tarragon- 5/5 Loaded with mushrooms and just the right amount of cream and tomato based! I think the tarragon sauce is a rose sauce. 

Clam sauce- my first time, it gets a 3.5/5. Although it was very good, I don't think i'm used to having seafood sauces. If you're used to it then you'll love it! It's not loaded with clam like the mushroom tarragon was loaded with mushrooms, but whatever.

Overall the food was amazingly fresh this time, server was very nice and I had a great time!

p.s I didn't know they also had a lunch special menu, selected spaghettis (tomato, meat sauce, lasagna, mushroom tarragon etc) was under $8!"}
{"text":"Quantity is great as they serve large portions and staff were good and attentive. However the quality of the food and drinks are very low. I ordered a seafood linguini which I couldn't get past a couple bites and the drinks weren't as good. The manhattan that we ordered had a full slice of orange in it instead of just a rind which was surprising."}
{"text":"I don't know what the fuss was about this place. The food was mediocre. I had the spaghetti with meat balls. I could have made this at home and it would have tasted better. I'm not even a very good chef so that gives you an idea how uninspired this dish was. 
The service was horrendous. Aside from the initial greet, no one seemed interested in serving us. They see our pitcher of water was empty and they just kept passing by. If I have to ask you to refill my water, you failed. 
The atmosphere was so-so. They shared the venue with a comedy club and it was amateur night. It was not funny at all and it was just a profanity laden act. 
I don't see a reason to ever return."}
{"text":"Just a nice, clean, decent pasta. I love the brown butter and cheese pasta. 

But you should not be expecting a lot when that side salad comes out. I think it was probably in a bowl in the freezer with Saran Wrap on it until that morning--and it was not thawed out fully. That's not a deal-breaker for me though; this is a pasta place. 

I wasn't in love with the meatballs, but the sausage was pretty good. I'd go back if I craved just a plate of pasta with no frills, and didn't mind sitting in the middle of creepy decor to have it."}
{"text":"I'm convinced everywhere I go sucks. This place was at the chandler mall. nice ambiance inside and family oriented. the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever. the marinara sauce didn't have any spices or hint of authentic Italian to it. the whole menu is literally spaghetti so don't go with the idea of getting any other kind of Italian dish. the meatballs same thing. no big Italian taste or spiciness. the appetizer- the artichoke dip was bland. felt like old people food or kid friendly food. nothing for your palette to discover. very BLah. just save your money and go to Oregano's where your never disappointed I guess."}
{"text":"Great food, terrific,  kitschy  ambiance. Our server ,Michael was awesome. Until we didn't see him anymore. Evidently, bigger more important tables came in behind us that took priority. Table of 15 next to us that came in  30 minutes later, after us, was served up all their meals, our table of two took 1 hour for our food to arrive. after hunting down the manger, Tara, we were met with a condescending, defensive attitude, and excuses of \"we are understaffed and overworked and doing the best we can\" ...Really? from the manager? no apology, no \"drinks are on us\" Nothing. Totally lost my appetite! Michael, our server, you're awesome, you need to find a more upscale restaurant that will appreciate how hard you work. Tara, get out of the restaurant business."}
{"text":"the host and server are excellent. the food is not. loud with kids and singing happy birthday. the food is bland and they try to hide this fact with lots of cheese, serving sizes are small. the soup is about 4 spoonfuls,the salad is on a small saucer. the spaghetti was in a cereal bowl, the sauce was thin and runny. no taste and very bland. my friends had lasagna and manicotti. both covered in excess cheese,no meat in lasagna and again bland. the bill was $70. for food type a bit pricey. you can get better food at any chain resturaunt for $10-12 a person."}
{"text":"Underwhelming experience to say the least.  I met several friends for a birthday here, Saturday night. We reserved for a party of 8, ended up being a table of 13 by the time we ordered any food. ALL of the party has worked in restaurants or customer service so we knew that because of the party size service may be a little slow, being in no hurry this wasn't a problem. The restaurant was, at best, less than 2/3 full the entire time we were there the (room nearest us wasn't even open).  None of our food came out together,  bread came as half of the party was finishing,  a few drinks came from the bar after all of the checks had been paid. I don't blame the poor service all on our server, the food runners had no idea what any of the food was and were baffled by requests for pepper and Parmesan cheese. The food it self was less that great, my blue cheese dressing had no flavor and seemed watered down, no one in he group that had Alfredo sauce liked it (tasted jarred) and everything was so smothered in grated cheese it was hard to taste anything beyond it. The Birthday girl and her husband were the only ones of the group that had been there before. We chose this spot for price, atmosphere and location. On an upside they did have a great atmosphere and good prices. My check for 2 was about $40 including the added gratuity. Maybe an off night? I probably won't go back to find out."}
{"text":"For what it is, a $10 meal with salad, drink, bread (which was the business) and your entree, its exactly what it should be. Its alright, nothing amazing.

The \"meat sauce with Italian sausage\" is a bit of a trip though. Its literally meat sauce with a full Italian hot dog on the side. Normally, as an Italian, you cook the sauce with the sausage in it when you advertise it like this. 

It left me feeling kind of like Henry Hill at the end of Goodfellas.

\"And that's the hardest part. Today everything is different; there's no action... have to wait around like everyone else. Can't even get decent food - right after I got here, I ordered some spaghetti with marinara sauce, and I got egg noodles and ketchup. I'm an average nobody... get to live the rest of my life like a schnook.\"

Then again, they did send Henry Hill to Arizona when he was in witness protection..."}
{"text":"They offered a gluten free \"menu\" so I was happy to try it. It came out with a Heartland flag stuck in the sauce; apparently they used boxed gluten free pasta. I had asked for the meat sauce and they had spooned maybe 2oz onto the top of my plate of pasta. The \"salad\" was just a handful of iceberg mix. I could have bought all of the ingredients at the grocery store for a 1/4th of the cost and a jar of prego would have tasted better. They've been here since the 70s and I don't even know why people still come here."}
{"text":"Went here with my wife and teenage son on Friday, 7-6-12. I Have not been to this chain since I was a teenager. We arrived at about  7:15PM, finding the parking lot almost full (usually a good sign). We checked in with the hostess and were told we would be seated in a few minutes. Shortly thereafter we were seated at a table in  the main thoroughfare. Not a huge problem, but things got worse from there. Our server was prompt and our drinks came quickly. We all ordered our meals with the minestrone soup. We were offered bread and it was nice and hot. The server told us on two occasions that they ran out of soup, but more was on the way and offered us a salad instead (should have taken her up on that offer). The meals came and still no soup. We were offered more bread and then were told they ran out of that too. I had spaghetti with meat sauce and my wife and son had chicken Parmesan. We all felt the spaghetti was tasteless and the chicken was rubbery. The soup finally came after we were done with our meals and in our opinion was inedible. All in all a very disappointing meal. The prices here a similar to most Italian chain restaurants. I personally will never go to this chain again"}
{"text":"Came here after a concert at the Sony Center. Only a handful of people were around, that should've been a good indication of what was to come. 

The place has a nice feel and look to it. We ordered the bruschetta and Alfredo pasta. Both were terrible. The tomatoes in the bruschetta were stale and the Alfredo sauce in the pasta had a powdery texture to it. I asked them add some shrimps to the pasta and all I got was 4 pieces. Our waters took forever to arrive. 

The server didn't know about SPC discounts but later came by and said that they did offer it. He then said that they would refund us the money but was nowhere to be seen later."}
{"text":"This past year I discovered I can no longer eat gluten, soy or dairy. As you can imagine it is pretty tough to find an Italian restaurant that can accommodate as well as make good Italian food that's gluten, dairy and soy free. 

I was truly blown away by how great The Old Spaghetti Factory's gluten free noodles tasted. Our waitress Alyssa made my allergies not feel like a burden and went above and beyond to ensure that my meal did not have any of the products I could not consume. She truly shines in excellent customer service. 

I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"So much fun! This place is a huge nostalgia trip for many of us Toronto kids but even as an adult this place has lots to offer. The food is good and they certainly pack you to bursting with portion sizes. The staff are friendly and attentive and the decor captures your attention. I love coming here and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"For what it is expected to be, a noisy family restaurant, the Old Spaghetti Factory never fails to disappoint me. I love the wooden decor, the tables and chairs, and the antique lighting. 
The service is fast,  friendly and attentive. Wait times exceeded my expectations both times. 
I had the browned butter and mithyra spaghetti, which is so insanely good and buttery that I had it both times I went there. Next time I will try something else, but I can confirm that it is consistently good!
The chicken marsala is pretty tasty as well. It was moist, thick, and perfectly cooked and seasoned. The salad and soup are average, but the breadsticks may be a little on the tough side. I've had a bit of trouble cutting them with the dull cutlery provided. The spumoni was delicious and a very nice nightcap to a good Italian meal.  
I would recommend this restaurant as a good place to take family and maybe friends from out of town. Maybe not a good restaurant for a first date because of all the kids running around. But I went here fully expecting that, and it didn't bother me much.
It's a very good value for the money (about $30 for 2 people). 
I will continue to dine here when I crave Italian."}
{"text":"Went for the first time 2 weeks ago. Fantastic experience!!! Service was amazing, friendly and organized... had the butternut squash ravioli... full of flavour, pasta was perfect... salad was a nice starter and the dessert at the end was the finish to a perfect experience... will definitely be making this a new tradition for my myself and my children to eat here."}
{"text":"Food Quality & Price: Echoing the reviews of others, the quality of the spaghetti here is okay. This time, I ordered the Blue Cheese Farfelle with Chicken and it was a pleasant change from the usual.  Would probably get it again the next time I go. Prices are decent. No complaints about the food, though it wasn't exceptional or anything.

Facility: Cozy, warm and family friendly. The lighting is dim so it could be romantic for dates, however, everything is quite crowded and the ambiance is very noisy. I could hear the entire conversation of the couple seated about two feet away from us (we were seated in the trolley). 

Service: Average. The waiter was enthusiastic but it's pretty much as average as you'd expect. He checks in once in a while to see if everything is okay. 

Overall: If you've read the other reviews, you'll understand why the Old Speghetti Factory scores a resounding \"eehhh\" across the board.  It's nothing remarkable but makes a good third or fourth choice if you have no where else to eat."}
{"text":"Great love for a family Friday get away. Separate tables in little booths, quiet music, good quality food and really sweet personal. Good for parties and just any time of past time. They also gave us a free dessert (ice cream). Love this place. I will recommend it to anyone who has stomach problems or just like quiet places with nice interiors. 
Better make a reservation. Might be a line."}
{"text":"Went here for a business function a couple months ago, food was ok, i did not select the food myself it was pre-ordered for the business function, we were served some pasta, one with red  sauce and the other i believe was Alfredo sauce. It wasn't the best, but not bad

waiters were a little slow on taking drink orders though"}
{"text":"This may be a chain restaurant but all I have been to have tons of character from the trade mark street car you can dine in to the \"bootlegger\" era bar it is a fun place to dine. The food is flavorful Italian. The spaghetti with mizithra is a house special and very well done here. The portions are s good value for the price. My only complaint about this location is the parking, or lack there of. Tight lot"}
{"text":"Horrible service! I was seated and shortly afterwards placed my order. My appetizer was brought out in a few minutes and then I was basically ignored by the entire staff for 30 minutes. I got up to try to find a manager,  and found my waitress chatting it up at the bar. I spoke to the manager briefly but at that point was so frustrated, I decided to leave without eating. I visit Calgary on a regular basis and will be sure not to return to this restaurant.

Horrible customer service!!!

MLB"}
{"text":"We were on vacation in Toronto so ate here since my kids are big fans of this chain, having frequented the CA locations.  However, avoid this place.  The food was overpriced & pretty bad.  Also, I agree with another review that  the decor give the place a creepy vibe.  Spend your $ elsewhere."}
{"text":"Have been coming here for about 20 years. Have always enjoyed great service, and amazing food! The bread & chocolate ice cream included free with a meal are the best part! Would definately recommend!"}
{"text":"I heard nothing but praise about the food and atmosphere of this chain restaurant. 

I loved the look of this place inside and out. Great rustic barrels and old barber chairs in the bar area gave a unique look.

Service was friendly and fast. 

Food was less than desirable. Salad was nothing but iceberg lettuce (and I got a stump) with some shredded red cabbage. My pasta dish was spaghetti with a white clam sauce. It was too salty and there was a sprinkling of microscopic clam bits. 

I always take leftovers home, this time I didn't. While the prices are good it's not worth a less than average meal. Husband was equally disappointed with his chicken marsala. Chances of going back are slim to none."}
{"text":"Best Italian food Restaurant EVER!!!!
Food was delicious, prices very reasonable! Will Definitely be back!!!!"}
{"text":"This location is outstanding. Always good service, always good food and overall a good experience. If you are looking for a nice Spaghetti Factory try this one instead of the one in Chandler. Chandler is horrendous. Phoenix has never done us wrong and is always good. Chandler has common dirty dishes, extremely hard bread and the staff seems to be at a level of incompetence to drive a customer crazy. Unfortunately the only word Chandler store seems to get right \"I'm sorry.\"  This Phoenix location is in the habit of saying \"see you soon.\" Great food and they know it. This probably also explains the fact that we always have to wait for service in Phoenix where Chandler is always immediate seating. Apparently, I am NOT the only person who prefers the Phoenix store."}
{"text":"After today and several other negative interactions with this location, I must recommend the downtown Phoenix location.  This one is led by incompetence. Today we received a text message offering a promotion, which is what they do weekly. After driving over 30 miles to get here , they inform us that they could serve us, however the computer system was down and could not honor any promotions. They indicated that they were manually running everything. How is it that the same calculator can add a plate but cannot subtract a discount? The promotion was not a barcode it was a text only, text message. This coupled with dirty dishes on previous visits , and overcooked, extremely hard bread has driven us to use the Phoenix facility, which is superior to this one. Don't waste your time. Several visits months apart, they always say they have gotten better, I do not see it. I have a few friends with the same impression. We go to the Phoenix location primarily even though it is further to travel"}
{"text":"Bad service. 

Terrible food. Caesar salad was drenched in fishy dressing. Ravioli was cold in the middle.  

Bread was decent."}
{"text":"I've come to this place for the second time, last night since I had a great time on my first visit but last night was for sure the last time ever. The guy who I assume was the host or manager maybe; was so RUDE and unprofessional. First he said 10 to 15 minutes waiting and after 30 minutes of waiting as I asked him how longer we should be waiting he said with a bad attitude that as you can see we're so busy (with children parties of course) & I don't know how long it would take. Then Suddenly He said oh your table is ready!!!! To my surprise as we were seated to the worst place possible I've noticed plenty of empty tables and I went back to ask him switch our table to another since there were lots of booth in some more quiet area of the restaurent or we may not want to seat there in the corridor , he said it's up to you, it is what it is ... So rude and impolite but it was four of us not only me to decide to leave. Anyhow we stayed and our server switch our table to where we asked for and made it a bit easier for us. Food was average, good for family with kids not for adultes at all."}
{"text":"A six year old bday party at an over priced glorified east side Mario's.

Warning: don't go here if high or hungry

My gf and I stumbled on the factory of noodles in a hunger stupor. Our service was willy wonky esque, our portions were uber small.

We saved the stay by dancing in the middle of the restaurant to at last by Etta James."}
{"text":"First time I came in here was with boyfriend we wanted to try something different ,the food was good not great but good that's why I have it a 2 the service is not good in my opinion they take forever to come to you and when u walk in they don't even greet u or acknowledge u"}
{"text":"We were in the area and wanted Italian, and this was the only option. The interior was kitchy and cheap, but that would have been tolerable if the food was decent. It wasn't. This was probably the single worst place we've eaten. The pasta was undercooked and tasted like Elmer's glue, and the recommended sauces were watered down and tasteless. Don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"We came for my son's Birthday (my son's favorite place). We seated quickly .Out waitress was Shayna please ask for her she was great! My asked for anything she was on top of all our needs. As a former waitress myself  I understand the difficulty of customers happy! She was sweet with my kids and professional with me. So if you do get a chance to come here please ask for Shayna. Thanks again The old Spaghetti factory."}
{"text":"Basic mass Italian food. Pasta is smothered in sauce. Other dishes have a ton of cheese. Kids love it. Usually very busy and a long wait."}
{"text":"I rarely eat here and this is why.  Showed up to eat at 8pm with party of four.  They had a 35 minute wait.  They have over 13 four tops open.  Was told they had some large tables.  Went to the bar and was told they can't serve parties of 4.  Talked to the hostess and they don't care.  Well done Spaghetti Factory!"}
{"text":"We had dinner on Saturday evening and it was the most delicious and relaxing dining experience. Years ago, when living in Portland, OR, we ate at the original Old Spaghetti Factory and this certainly brought back nostalgic memories. We had reservations at 5pm and were seated immediately in a very spacious and comfortable booth, across from the signature railroad car. Karen was our server and she was so attentive to every detail. The spaghetti and meatballs was cooked to perfection, with the pasta perfectly al dente. The chicken parmesan was moist and tender. The spumoni ice cream to top off the meal was a welcome treat, but two of us couldn't resist getting the mud pie! MMMM! Certainly worth the caloric splurge!  Anthony, the manager, stopped by our table and was very charismatic and welcoming.  We will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"We had the veggie, also, the meat lasagnas, which were both AH- mazin!"}
{"text":"Just came back from a fun family meal at OSF. Despite having young and tired kids we ended up staying over two hours. So much to look at (the stained glass Jays wall is great!), and the service was comparable to many upscale restaurants I've been to - our server was very friendly, fast, chatty and cracked a few jokes when appropriate, and came by at just the right times to check on us.

On Saturday nights they have a magician who walks around doing tricks and making animal baloons. Al also does stand-up and he got my wife and I laughing pretty hard while he made animals for the kids. A great touch for everyone!

The food is well made, tasty, quick, abundant, and better than any other comparable chain restaurants. Also great value within the downtown core. I don't know what other reviewers expect for portion sizes - I was really hungry yet barely able to finish my standard-sized chicken parmesan with spaghetti plus all the extras. 

This is a family restaurant, not a gourmet, five-star Italian experience. They know their customer base and they serve it well. We will absolutely be back with the kids and their cousins soon."}
{"text":"I came here around 12pm for lunch on a Friday.  It was empty, so the seating was quick.  Our server was very friendly and very efficient, though that could be because of the empty house as well.  More people came soon after we did, though, and the service remained awesome.  Drinks were replenished promptly, many table visits were made to make sure everything was okay (but not too many that it was annoying), and he even gave us more butter for our bread on time.
The bread that came to us was crispy on the outside, tough to get the provided knife through at first...but it came to us fresh and warm, and the inside was soft.  The butter was also soft enough to spread, so that was great.  
Each entree comes with a soup or salad and spumoni or vanilla ice cream.  I ordered the clam chowder with my jumbo crab stuffed ravioli, and the chowder was excellent.  It was thick, creamy and delicious.  
The crab stuffed ravioli, however, is the very reason I took two stars off this potential 5 star review.  The 6 huge ravioli came out covered with a green pesto sauce, and at first glance, looked delicious.  Upon biting into one of the ravioli, I found the pasta too thick and under cooked.  I peeled the corners apart to find a VERY gooey center.  I'm not one to make complaints at restaurants, but I wish I would've here.  I choked down 4 of the raviolis before giving up and asking for my ice cream.
I got delicious, seemingly homemade vanilla ice cream, and that was probably the best part.  I could barely finish it due to the 4 uncooked raviolis filling me up at the time, but it was good ice cream.
The decor was nice, very rustic and old-town  themed.  My booth was in a replica of a trolley car.
All in all, it was a good starter and finisher, but the star of the show was ruined, therefore 3 stars."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite place to eat.  The location has weathered the change in downtown and addition of the light rail construction.  The building is great, old, weathered but still alive and kicking.  I miss the old buildings that get replaced with new construction, so I can appreciate the setting.  Sometimes the air conditioning may blow your hat or napkin away while eating, but seating position and a positive attitude is key!  The staff is always polite, but rotating as usual.  I don't visit for the excellent service, I appreciate what this restaurant offers in standard italian food and character.  Side note, my wife and I ate here hours after our wedding...:)  Oh, the creamy pesto salad dressing is great."}
{"text":"Went for dinner me and my 9 years old son
Order 1 adult mill and one kids mill
No drinks jest whether 
When the bill came the whiter whit next to me until I get Har payment and my son was noisy   So I didn't cake so Mach the bill
Well it was 31 dollar .....
And I also had tip 
What A rip off."}
{"text":"Ok. I am giving this 4 stars based on realistic expectations. NO you are not going to find the best pasta in town. BUT if you like family restaurants, this is a fun place to go. I would definitely take my kids here. Pastas are ok, but you will definitely get full here. They keep on serving you bread even before your pasta comes out, so you are practically full by the time your pasta comes out. Their prices are very reasonable and you can order a full course meal with salad, dessert & coffee."}
{"text":"This place is perfectly average.  Not a bad thing.  $15 gets you spaghetti, salad, bread, and ice cream.  All tastes good, not great, not spectacular but good.  I will complain about the bread knives however.  Probably in an effort to be safe the knives don't cut bread very well. Also ketchup on the table?   That one makes no sense, who puts ketchup on their pasta?   I suggest the Managers Favorite with a combo of Mizithra and Brown Butter and Meat Sauce.  Salad with the pesto dressing.  Spumoni Ice Cream."}
{"text":"I really only go here because my in-laws enjoy chain restaurants so much. Even though the exterior has been recently redone, I think the interior missed the memo. It's dingy, dark, and tacky. The food doesn't really bring anything new to the \"Hey we're an Italian place that totally doesn't use a microwave for 90% of our cooking,\" scene. The portion sizes are huge, but with the majority of the actual entrees being pasta, it's hard to see why the prices are $14+ per plate.  Both times we've been, (with a large party, admittedly) it's taken a super long time for us to get our checks. Really, look elsewhere for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Do you like salt?? If so, this is the place for you. Food is very sub par here. I'll never come back."}
{"text":"While visiting Phoenix, a fellow foodie said I MUST go to the Old Spaghetti Factory. 

I like the atmosphere. We sat in the bar area. It was kind of divey feeling with an antique flair. 

I wasn't impressed with the menu offerings. It seems scant for a place that came so highly recommended. I got the chicken parmigana. It was mediocre. Probably should have gotten the spaghetti my dinner mate was so smitten with. I did like that our meals came with a yummy cup of gellato. Delicious! 

It was pretty good, but not great. I'd be willing to try it again before casting it aside."}
{"text":"The current rating should have told us all we needed to know, but we went to The Old Spaghetti Factory, for the first time, anyway.  Atmosphere was nice, even interesting.  The wait staff was pleasant.  But the food, is right up there with the worst I have ever had.  Tasteless, commercial, barely edible.  I hardly cook, but I can do better spaghetti than this, drunk.  I don't write this review to keep you from going there.  No one review should form your opinion.  But my advice, is to limit yourself to appetizers, since the bar will probably be empty, so you can get right in.  In this way, you won't drop a load of cash, and you will have enough money left, to later go and get something to eat.  I have spent thousands of dollars in the Chandler Fashion Center area restaurants over the past few years.  I will never bother with this one again."}
{"text":"Appetizers were delicious, I had the risotto balls. Clam chowder was good but was very potatoey, not enough seafood. 

I had the fire grilled sausage with spaghetti.  The noodles were cooked well but the sauce tasted like chef boyardee. The sausages were great!
My boyfriend had the chicken parm. The sauce on the noodles tasted like plain tomatoes. The chicken was good, my boyfriend ejoyed it, I thought the breading tasted odd.

We had the chocolate and vanilla ice cream for dessert which was very yummy. 

Definitely a lot of families which actually wasn't so bad. The staff was friendly but we noticed as the restaurant started to empty, the service got a lot slower which, which depending on how you feel about it, could be a good or bad thing."}
{"text":"I was very excited to see this go in at Chandler Fashion Center. I had heard great things. I went with my mom for lunch after a morning of shopping. We were pleased at the prices, and the meal for my daughter. We got the soup and salad for lunch. 
Everything was good, but what kept me at a 3 from a 4 was the salad. It was straight from the bag, basic iceburg lettuce with the shaved carrots and purple cabbage. A huge disappointment."}
{"text":"Meh.  The food is exactly what you would expect based on the name.   On par with cafeteria food.  Ordered the #2 (spaghetti with meat sauce, sausage, and meatballs).  Got bread, a salad, and my entree all within 5 minutes of ordering.  Salad was a bowl of lettuce with a ton of croutons.  The meat sauce on to of the spaghetti was hot with a sparse amount of meat.  The spaghetti, the sausage, and the meatball were ice cold.   Seriously, the meatballs were from the refrigerator cold.   The best part of the meal was the spumoni ice cream.  My first and last time visit."}
{"text":"Wow, this place has gone way downhill!. I'm not sure what meat is in the meat balls, but it sure wasn't beef.   
I'm in my 50's and I've been going to the Spaghetti Factory since I was a kid.  I was extremely disappointed.  I would suggest anyone travelling to Toronto avoid it.  I appreciate the response by the general manager.  He should invest a lot of time watching who is making these meatballs.  I didn't complain at the time. Because I didn't want to embarrass my kids.  And, I left a 15% tip as this wasn't the waiters issues.  But, the quality of the food is very poor."}
{"text":"Great food came here for lunch and they were friendly and professional.  I had the Meatballs was very hot and delicious and the bread was super hot and yummy . Would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"In my opinion, it took forever to get seated. Seemed like everyone was new because the hostess was busy trying to teach a class to a few other waiters on how to use the registar. After 15min wait we were seated. As we walked back to get seated, the frikkin place was empty. I joked to the hostess that they must be super busy, she replied and said its been slow all day.......... umm confused face emoji!!! What took so long?? Ohh well.. we will see how the food and service are... Atleast the beers good.

Wow food came out quicker then we got seated. Had the #1 \"the premier\" lasagna and chicken marsala. Super good chicken marsala!! All in all we had a good time, except for the wait, but server made up for it! Very attentive, probably because the place was practically vacant! But will not come here anymore, we usually go to the Chandler location. Wayyyy better atmosphere!!"}
{"text":"The food is decently portioned and well priced. Where else can you get a three course meal for 15 dollars? You get salad/soup, your pasta, and ice cream.  Most of all you have to go for the decor! You can eat dinner inside an old street car, or a telephone booth, and even a merry go round! They have a wall of old music instruments, and a really cool telephone switch board that you can play with. If I'm in the area , this is one of my go to places"}
{"text":"Very family/kid friendly. Lots of noise, not the type of place you go to sip a glass of wine. I like the pay one price for a 3 course meal plus tea/coffee. Price wise it's on point. The food is slightly bland but given the amount of kids eating here it makes sense."}
{"text":"To sum it up: its a lot of money to spend for a very average experience. 

I had never been to one of their restaurants and wont go back.  

ATMOSPHERE: The decor was unique and clean. But I found it odd that it was so quiet.  No music, no A/C humming...just awkwardly quiet.  So quiet that other diners could easily hear my conversation and I could hear theirs.

FOOD: My 'salad' was a bowl of iceberg lettuce with 4 shoestring carrot pieces.  My child's mac-n-cheese looked more like pasta with a small bit of butter. My pasta was ok.  Not great, not awful, but not worth the price on the menu.  The presentation/visual appeal was lacking on all items - no 'wow' factor.

SERVICE: Our waiter was pleasant but got 2 out of our 4 orders wrong."}
{"text":"I don't understand the good reviews.  Even if our entree were different, the only thing that was good was the warm bread and butter.  My partner and I both had soup...minestrone...decent, but nothing special.  I had a house salad as well...can you say expired grocery sore bagged salad.  Eeewww.  We also had spaghetti and meatballs...very strange taste and way overcooked pasta.  Sorry, never again."}
{"text":"This place is delicious !!!!! The inside is so cute as well. Andrew is a great server!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere here is wonderful and the food is good, but the food is too pricey. Almost $30 for a plate of pasta that isn't even filling and overshowered in oils? Come on that's a bit much don't you think?"}
{"text":"I did no want to come here. I'm not a big fan of pasta, but my dad chose it for Father's Day and it was actually pretty good. Every meal comes with bread for the table, soup or salad, and ice cream and despite sounding like a ton of food the portions were good. 

I left feeling satisfied and not like a stuffed pig. I got the spaghetti and rich meat sauce, my husband got the meat trio, my Tia the plain sauce, and my dad a Caesar salad and everyone loved their food. 

The service was amazing one of the best waiters I've had in a while. He was super attentive but not annoyingly so.

The atmosphere seemed a little dated... kinda kitschy but it added to its charm. It was not particularly busy but we we're their 2pm on Father's Day.

Overall a great experience and I would definitely try it again. I'm a fan. :)"}
{"text":"We've only been here twice and we didn't like it either time. Bjs and buffalo were both full at the bar so we took a risk and went here. The decor is atrocious! Walking in I felt like Gordon Ramsay walking into a failing restaurant. All chandeliers were old, dated, and ugly. They had red suede on the seats and some weird lady was singing  Natasha bedingfeilds song unwritten with really undeserved applause. The \"bartender\" was running the bar, seating area, and patio! He was nice and friendly. But obviously strained. Within the 40 minutes we were there we were served one drink and had to wave down the waiter to pay. There was literally one other couple there at the bar. So get this, as we were leaving the hosts said bye and as I turned to thank her she was already giggling and chatting with her coworker. Terrible experience. Don't go here. Never again. #disappointed"}
{"text":"Such nostalgia! I can't help but give it 4. 

I have been going here since I was really young with my family, so I will always love it, but I genuinely think it's good value for good food! Love the kitschy decor, (got to sit in the \"elevator\" with a date once, which was awesome) and love the caboose! I feel like it used to be a lot busier when I was younger but it's so fun there.

I think the best deal is any of the pasta mains. You get soup or salad (love the minestrone), the pasta dish, and ice cream for dessert (spumoni all the way!). You also get loaves of bread with garlic butter. Carb fest, but oh so good.

They have a seafood alfredo (that I didn't see on the menu last time) that is delicious, with scallops. I haven't had bad pasta there, though. Drinks can be a bit expensive. I've always had good service. 

Will ALWAYS come back. This restaurant is a family tradition!"}
{"text":"This place had cockroaches climbing on the walls it was gross left ASAP and will never be returning!"}
{"text":"We were promptly seated as they were not busy at all. We waited fifteen minutes and were never even greeted by a server. We left and went to the food court right across the way. Worst service ever. The hostess was too busy with her cellphone to even notice that we were leaving, 15 minutes after arriving."}
{"text":"This place is great.  The food is good, not the best Italian ever, but good.  The cheesy bread is one of our favorites.  The decor is great along with the servers.  We have been a few times, its kinda far from us so we do not visit regularly.  The food is good and comes with free ice cream (kids love).  

We will come back when in the area :)"}
{"text":"My kids and I love this place. We have visited this location three or four times and the Chandler location once. We even turned my mom and stepdad into fans who visit the Chandler location often. We always get great service and tons of food. Tonight was no exception. My son had the Chicken Parmigiana and was extremely happy. My daughter chose the Cheese Mannicotti and Spaghetti, while I had the Meat Lover's plate with 2 huge meatballs and an Italian sausage with spaghetti and meat sauce. We each sampled each others and loved the delicious flavors. We don't get downtown very often, but when we can this is our restaurant of choice."}
{"text":"This is an amazing value for casual, Italian dining.

I got the minestrone soup, whole wheat pasta with white clam sauce, sourdough bread, milk (with refills included) and spumoni ice cream for $10. Everything was good, and the soup and dessert were outstanding. The ice cream came in a classy metal dish, which was a nice touch.

We also had some Sicilian cheese bread and chocolate mousse cake to share, and they were both excellent.

The atmosphere is a mixture of casual and elegant, and the whole dining experience seems aimed at making people feel comfortable.

AnaJolene was our server, and she gave us friendly, helpful service the entire time we were there."}
{"text":"Typical for what you'd expect from the Old Spaghetti Factory.  Food was fine and the price was comparable to other restaurants in the area.  The location and proximity to downtown was what drew us here.  We were able to eat and park conveniently while still able to attend our event later that evening.  

Server and waitstaff were excellent!  They were very attentive to our needs and kept up with us throughout the stay.  

Bathrooms were not in the best condition and in my opinion were not clean enough.  We arrived at 4:00 in the afternoon before the rush so I'd expect the bathrooms to be in better shape in regards to cleanliness."}
{"text":"I went with a group for a business lunch.  They were able to sit us quickly.  The service was good.  However, the food was not so great.  I ordered a chicken Caesar salad.  The lettuce was dripping in dressing, yuck!  There was barely any lettuce, but plenty of chicken, so that may be a preference on my part for more greens.  The chicken was cooked well, still moist, but the proportions were off.  I would have to try something else if I go back."}
{"text":"Manicotti (yum) and spaghetti with mizithra cheese. Heaven. Just like when I tried it for the first time in Louisville, KY in 2013. This time, in Phoenix, I went back the next day and had the same exact thing. I also purchased some of that heavenly cheese. Thank you."}
{"text":"Old Spaghetti Factory?
More like Old Produce Factory. I ordered a salad with my entree and it had old iceberg lettuce that was already wilted and there were ice chips on it. I ordered the sparkling basil strawberry lemonade cocktail and idk what makes it sparkling but it didn't taste like a sparkling drink and I had a huge blob of old ass basil in it, I couldn't even taste the basil in it either. Maybe due to the fact it was old af it could no longer produce any sort of flavor. Our waitress was nice but slow and we ordered water with lemon and got water with no lemon which is a baby owie compared to the old lettuce and basil I had to endure. I also ordered the spinach and cheese ravioli with \"homemade marinara\" homemade straight from a can I think, tasted a little sour, which is the only taste I could get from it and the ravioli tasted like something I could get at fry's in the freezer aisle. I'm sure this place would be great if you're drunk or high though so, if you're intoxicated I'd give it a try otherwise I say pass. 
Update: I just finished my drink and I can taste the basil. Tastes like old basil that has been sitting in a cooler for weeks"}
{"text":"2nd visit in two weeks. Honestly our first visit was great. Tim our waiter was fantastic and the food  quite good. It was for that reason that we returned today. 
Reservation for 5pm to make the hockey game by 7 it's a 7 min walk.
Plenty of time. 
Not.
45 min for salad to arrive. But no soup we ate while the rest of the party waited.
Then another 45 min for dinner to arrive. 
No time to eat and make the game.
That is a  full 90 mins for pasta to arrive at the table. 
Box it up we need to go. 
Had to complain 3 times to get any where. 
The GM was kind enough to respond to let me know that customer service is important. 
Out first experience was 5 star . You do have some good wait staff and not every experience is good. 
The waiter was new, not his first night but still rather inexperienced. 
Ultimately if the orders are not placed with the kitchen then food does not get made. 
Our first complaint was to the waiter. 
That was the reminder that oops he has not put in the order. 
Second complaint 30 mins later still no food  we got salad but no soup. 
Waiter explains that the kitchen was out of soup.
Bring this to the attention of the waitress helping the first waiter we get an eye roll and an offer for more bread.
Still no food . It's been 90 mins since we sat down . Same waiter has served the guest beside us . They had soup and salad and dinner and  ordering desert. 
Request to speak to the manager.
We wait and wait . 10 min goes by and the manager arrives as the food is being served. 
He apologizes and offers to adjust our bill. 
No time for desert or even to finish eating . It's been almost two hours. 
Check  arrives  no adjustment. 
No charge for feast that should increase portions because it is not available for dishes other than pasta. 
So for our poor experience the offer is to remove a charge that we should not have paid for in the first place because it was not available.
As I said customer service needs work."}
{"text":"I actually really enjoy this place. It is a super cute resturaunt built from two old phoenix houses linked together.

Most of the food is not spectacular but never bad. The mizithra cheese however is so good, the chicken marsala, amazing and flavorful, and the tuscan chicken sandwich (only available at lunch time) very craveable.



Most of the salad dressing are made on site, and while I personally am a fan of the bleu cheese, most of my friends go for the creamy pesto.

The bread is delivered fresh daily and once upon a time long long ago when I served tables here for a short time a small loaf of bread was my nightly dinner and quite satisfying.

Because I worked here I can also tell you the kitchen staff back then was always terrific and the whole place very clean.

The price and atmosphere make this a simple and enjoyable place to grab dinner with friends...or sit with your date in the trolly.

For the small prices to get soup or salad, a drink, bread, dinner and a scoop or spumoni, what more can you ask for?

Another notable fact: the location is actually ranked as one of the top haunted places in AZ.  When I worked there the power went out one night and i swear to you we could hear footsteps up in the attic!"}
{"text":"The Old Spaghetti Factory...well not this one, this one is very new. The one in Phoenix-not so great. Very bland...the food and service were not great. I didn't want to go back but decided to try this newer location. I have already been to the Chandler location twice now! Amazing deal for tasty food. I usually have iced tea with dinner, as we all know, drinks are about $2.50 added to your bill...not here, the iced tea comes with your meal! You get an iced tea, hot tea, or coffee (yes, soda you do have to pay for), fresh piping hot bread with a garlic butter, a house salad or cup of soup (they've had a yummy and hearty, vegetarian minestrone both times), your entrée (which are super cheap!), and a cup of vanilla ice cream or Italian spumoni (which is one of the better spumoni's I have had). I honestly don't know how they can afford to give so much food, for such a little price. Two people, that many items for $25.00? That's crazy! Just remember people...just because your bill is less than other places does not mean you should tip off of the bill! Think about the service your getting (mine has been out of this world fabulous both times) and all of the work that is involved (dishes, refills, courses, etc...). Tip on both price and service, then add a bit...don't be stingy. 

Now for the entrees...I have gone off of recommendations both times, and both times I wasn't disappointed. The first time I went I tried their specialty the Mizithra Cheese & Browned Butter pasta (only $9.99). I wasn't sure what to expect but it came highly recommended. This was a very rich and scrumptious dish. It was a blast from the past, like a classier version of butter pasta you eat when you're a kid. I could only eat about half of it since it was so rich but my friend and I really enjoyed it...she ate more of mine than her own. I don't blame her, she got the fettuccine alfredo and it was not very good. The noodles were overcooked and the sauce was very bland...more like a milk based sauce instead of a nice creamy and cheesy sauce.

The second visit I tried another recommended dish, the Lasagna Vegetariano (only $10.50). Four cheeses, alfredo sauce, layers of noodles with fresh artichoke hearts, yellow squash, and zucchini. The top layer has carrots on top which I thought was a very unique and yummy idea. Then everything is topped with marinara sauce and delicious sautéed mushrooms. The presentation of the dish was very nice and the dish overall was not extremely flavorful, but considering it was vegetarian I thought it was very good. I would get it again."}
{"text":"We love love love the Old Spaghetti Factory. I don't think there's been a single time I've been that I haven't had to wait, but it's ALWAYS worth it. I love their lasagna, the bread is really good. They have huge portion sizes, so we split a plate usually when we go, but it's so well worth it. The service has always been really good too. I will definitely go back again and again."}
{"text":"OK, this is the thing. Don't expect anything but some comfort food for a reasonable price. Otherwise you'll be pretty disappointed.

The decor is appealing, the food is decent for the price, the service is friendly, and all in all is a good experience. It's a best seller for kids, and there's nothing not to enjoy of this place if you know that you're going to an inexpensive place to put something in your stomach after some shopping or a movie.

Remember, this is a chain that started in Portland with the vision of feeding the family for a reasonable price focused in the whole dinner (meaning that your entree comes with soup or salad and desert).

The spumoni is delicious!

So, if you're leaving the mall or the movies and you need a quick bite that won't hurt your finances and the food will taste good, and the decor and service are great, this is your joint!"}
{"text":"A group of nonprofit social media enthusiasts (12) booked a large table for lunch. The server provided just the right touch of attention and discretion. We talked loudly and passionately and the table majically was bussed and the next course arrived. Reasonably priced, tasty, simple fare. I had the manicotti and it was above average and the ice crean that comes with every meal was delicious.
Great space for a lunch meeting or gathering. We will be back."}
{"text":"Courtney is probably the best waitress I've ever had here! Super friendly and super funny. She is the best addition to this company!"}
{"text":"I love the ambiance but I just can't get passed the bland sauces... I had fettuccini Alfredo with Shrimp. Needs more garlic and taste! 
Took my daughter for her special birthday dinner and they enjoyed the cotton candy drink! 
Prices are about $12-$25, so not too bad when it comes with bread, salad or soup & ice cream!"}
{"text":"This place is in a newer Building but, made to look old. That is the theme of OLD SPAGHETTI FACTORY. The light fixtures and Furniture and beautiful I have to say. It is really clean looking. I see no problem with the layout or decor.
The one thing that always gets to me here is the smell. There is the strangest smell in this place, and I smell it every time I come here. It is quite a turnoff I must say.
The staff is great even the hostesses.
They have indoor and Patio seating which you can take advantage of for just a small window here in AZ.
The food is decent. You get a lot of food for the price. The people that complain about the food should remember that it is a very reasonable place in price, it is clean and good service.
You really cannot beat it and if you have children, it is a screaming deal still.
Lots of parking in the huge lot surrounding the mall."}
{"text":"Severely disappointed.  We drove half an hour to get here for dinner, only to discover our reservation had been lost.  Pretty much no effort was made to find it or figure out what happened.  We made new plans rather than wait.  Again, disappointing."}
{"text":"I love the Old style Restaurants , also I like the Menu very simple to choose from. I've been going to different Spaghetti Factories . Been in Fullerton, ,Newport Beach, Duarte, there was one in Hollywood but it was shut down and the last one in Phoenix. All of them I rate them 4 Star i'm a Fan . Just depends also what attitude you go when you go out to eat , yes sometimes the service or the food are not good, but we bring it to their attention the right way and you'll get good service. I love OSF , good reviews in my part , good for Parties , dates and with your family. Go check them out ..."}
{"text":"This has been a classic for my family. We have been going here for 20 years. I was very please that over the course of 20 years the taste is still the same. Recently I became gluten free and I was very pleased to see they offer gluten free pasta! Still same great taste, just spirals instead of spaghetti noodles. Gluten free items have their own side of the menu which makes it easy to look at all your options. So happy with my experience and service here. The old spaghetti factory has always been so good to us."}
{"text":"This restaurant seats 600, so you'd think that they'd be able to handle large groups no problem right? Nope. I came with a party of ~40, and here is our story:

1) For large parties of over 20, they will only accept one single group order. This is reasonable, and they were happily willing to sub individual orders if there is a food restriction issue. We were only given two servers but food came out quickly and efficiently.

2) This one's the main kicker: They would only accept ONE bill. They must have had efficiency in mind, but this was anything but efficient. Almost all of us had the exact same order so the bills should have been simple already, but no amount of negotiating directly with the manager would change their mind - so everyone had to scramble for cash to pool together. The first point was forgivable, but this one bill nonsense was an enormous headache for our end.

We have been here just a year ago, but back then we were given our own menus to make our own orders and able to pay our own bills, and we had a good time overall. Food is still not bad, servers still friendly and helpful, but this poor new management effectively ruined our group dining experience."}
{"text":"Amazing and fast service with simple yet high quality food is what you will recieve when stopping in at this place.
We go here for family dine out nights quite a bit. We can take our family of 6 here and leave stuffed for about 60-65 bucks, with tip 75-80.
From the time you walk in until you leave you are attended to by the servers steady from drink top ups to desert, the service is outstanding and the restaurant is always very clean.
The meals are also quickly whipped up with no waiting around for it to show up, no matter what it is you may order that they offer on the menu.
Sure its only pasta for the most part, but they nail every dish every time. 
This is where we will bring out of town family for a great meal as they can seat in large numbers. Plus its ultra affordable."}
{"text":"If you love cheese and butter on spaghetti. Come here. This place is know. For that. It's great. Casual attire and kid friendly."}
{"text":"I had the saturday special, Chicken Pesto Penne Pasta.  The chicken was identical to the canned grocery store chicken.  Very disappointing, my first time there in 13 years, now I remember why I haven't been for so long."}
{"text":"I have only visited this restaurant, because my father likes it.  I have been there 3 times, once each in September 09, 10, and 11 (my father has been there more often).  In the three times I've been here, they've missed calling my name twice.  And the fact that they now use the vibrating pager didn't help.  When I finally went up to the desk after 45 minutes (after being told 25 minutes and seeing people who came in after us get seated), I went up to the desk.  I asked how much longer until I was seated.  The girl looked at her list and said \"You've already been sit\".  I held up the pager and said \"I still have this in my hand so obviously I haven't been sit\".  When I mentioned this was the 2nd time out of 3 this had happened, I got what amounted to a \"S Happens\" as a reply.

As for the restaurant, the kitsch overwhelms.  The service was great although we could tell that our waiter was tired of singing \"Happy Birthday\" as it seems we were the only people in the restaurant who weren't having birthdays that evening.  The food is average, nothing special.  I'm sure my dad will want to go next year when we visit Toronto, and I'll go as a good son but unwillingly."}
{"text":"We didn't eat any food here so my review will be short.

The beer selection was good and I had an IPA that I have never had before. It was good and the atmosphere was really chill. I didn't like the service but it was OK considering it was just a beer.

Overall, would visit again to try a couple other beers."}
{"text":"if I could give them negative stars I would. unprofessional, rude and all around bad service."}
{"text":"I forgot to post this last month......
Best this place has been in years! Shrimp salad, chicken marsala, lasagna... all awesome! Service was the best its been in a long time too. I think our waitress was pregnant, I forgot to ask her name, but she was great!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is nice. The food isn't anything special. I'd say it's probably over priced for what it is. I don't regret trying it, but wouldn't go back if I was to choose where to at."}
{"text":"Fresh pasta my ass! I'm not sayin they don't make it, but they sure as hell don't know how to cook it. Service is outstanding. Food is a joke. Or at least whoever is cooking it is. They should be fired. This place has been around a long time. Has great potential. I gave it a few tries and nothing but bad luck with the food."}
{"text":"Dont waste your money here. Substandard food. This place rides on name alone.You could make better pasta at home . Do yourself a favour and pay a little extra to eat somewhere else. If you love pasta ,this is NOT the place to have it at. I payed $18.00 for a Penne and Chicken and  it was mediocre at best. I should have gotten the hint after seeing the parmessan cheese in a jar on the table. I didnt even stay for the coffe and Ice cream that came with it."}
{"text":"I've been eating at Spaghetti Factories all over the U.S. Since I can remember. I had my first date w my high school sweetheart here who is now my husband. Great food every single time. I get the spaghetti w clam sauce, hubby gets the meat lovers, mom gets the half and half which is spinach & cheese raviolis w spaghetti w rich meat sauce. Kids always get the Italian creme sodas w fruit flavor and they get to keep the glass. The salad w the balsamic vinegar and olive oil is delish. And all meals come w ice cream to finish off ur dinner. Spamoni or vanilla are the choices... The decor is just darling here, literally step back in time when ever I walk into spaghetti factories. It's a 1920s vintage moulin rouge  and train station all mixed into one w velvet couches, & a trolly cart in the middle of the restaurant that you can dine in as well."}
{"text":"I went here tonight 9/6/2015 the waiter was awesome. Every employee was great made me feel great. But for the real reason I went. The food HORRIBLE I should have made my own. Food just was not that good. I got the spaghetti and meat sauce. My guy got the meatballs and spaghetti both dishes where nasty as hell. BUT ILL TAKE THAT BACK THE MEATBALLS WHERE GOID BUT THE REST OF THAT MESS I GAVE TO MY DOG......never again 32 dollars and some change dollars bye bye......and the only reason I went here because the wait at angry crab was tooooooooooooo long"}
{"text":"service great, salad yum - hard to screw that up...however my friend when asked by the waitress how is everything...told her that the meatballs were salty..and to let the chef know..the manager came over attitude in hand...and informed us the meatballs were fine that the chef tasted them and said they were fine...well okay whatever and then proceeded to give my friend 1/2 off her 6.99 spag and meatballs..seriously we didnt ask for anything off or ask the manager over however attitude and all here he came ...boasting of their balls and with his balls gave her 1/2 off...LOL!.jerk and not going back for anymore salty balls!.."}
{"text":"Overpriced ordinary spaghetti

I didn't realize this was a chain until I was seated. The bread with garlic butter was pretty good but the salad appeared to have been of the generic iceberg bagged variety smothered in dressing. The mushroom sauce consisted of their marinara garnished with a few sliced mushrooms. Not horrible but certainly not anything special. The cherry cream soda was excellent and the spumoni ice cream was good, but I won't be returning."}
{"text":"man I haven't been in at least 10 years was driving to eat at a different restaurant down town but stop instead but now I know way I never went back I thought the hostess was the friendest person there our server never smiled didn't explain anything just really had a bad attitude she was super slow never filled drinks now for the food the salad was soup it was swimming in dressing the bread was hard on the outside but super soft couldn't cut it with a knife Marsala sauce just was bla but the pasta was cook perfect and the mule was very tasty prices are good for the amount of food you get but the quality no maybe be back in another ten years"}
{"text":"I have been going off and on to this place since i was a kid!
I went last weekend and i think more than anything i just LOVE the place it's self. The food is hit or miss and they took eggplant off the menu and i do have to say that was my favorite thing to get there. But the building is so beautiful and inside is so many eye catching things to look at. and they have a trolley inside as well, so the kids would love that.
The service is AMAZING, i would give them a rating of 5 stars on that part, friendly, always around and quick.
The prices are not bad either, your meal comes with a drink, salad or soup and dinner and dessert all included. i pretty much never get the dessert their portions are big.
They do have a bar as well but it is not put to good use as i see it, it is in the back of the restaurant and they have never tried to make it a place to just go hang out and have drinks, too bad because it is pretty cool area.
There is rumor that the building is haunted and that they do have ghosts in there, so keep your eyes and ears open!!
It is just a warm beautiful place to go with friends, family or a date!!"}
{"text":"Came here with my husband many times. This time we tried the Italian sausage with meat sauce and the mizithra with brown butter. The sausage tasted like cafeteria sauce to my husband. The mizithra tasted like just parmesan and butter. When telling the manager he kept rebuttling our claims and saying that I was wrong about the cheese and that he likes the meat sauce and disagrees with my husband. I decided on no more food and my husband changed to chicken parmesan, his favorite. Instead of the two for $25 deal, we now have to pay for every drink, the appetizer, and his parm. They also took 5-10 minutes just to get a drink refill out and didn't clear our dishes right away.  Incredibly disappointed in how this was handled and don't plan to come back any time soon. Maybe we will try the Phoenix location next time."}
{"text":"This should have been a better experience... 

I'll begin with the food.  We arrived on a Sunday afternoon after a visit to the Phoenix Art Museum.  We ordered a BLT salad off the lunch menu and a manicotti dish.  We also included a cup of the minestrone soup for a buck.  The salad was good and was accompanied by fresh, hot bread.  The minestrone soup was outstanding.  The salad and soup were brought out early, as we requested, and we had ample time to complete the salad before our entree arrived.  The manicotti was fine and a good enough portion size that we had to box some.   So far, a good dining experience.

Then the bill arrives.  The salad was 8.50 and then entree was full price.  We questioned the bill, as the \"lunch menu\" said the salad would be 5.99 and the entree 1.50 off.  The server actually apologizes and says he'll have the manager correct the mistake.  Then he comes back and tells us \"Sorry, manager says lunch prices only apply Mon-Fri\".  Nowhere on the menu does it say lunch only applies Monday through Friday, and we were never told.  I didn't press the issue, paid the bill and off we go.  

What could have been an overall pleasant experience ruined by what is essentially a sham.  Giving patrons a menu with lunch specials and prices and then waiting to mention \"that doesn't apply\" until the bill arrives disgraceful.  Deceptive business practices will trump decent food every time, hence the two-stars."}
{"text":"This place used to be REALLY REALLY REALLY good.  I'm not sure exactly what happened, but the food went WAY downhill!  While the portion sizes went lower and the prices went up, the quality of the food seems to have dropped as well as the expertise of cooking it.  

The Chicken Parm that I got was pathetic to say the least.  It was a tiny little piece of chicken breast and was dry as a bone.  The side of spaghetti was even small.  It almost looked like a children's portion as they set the plate in front of me.  

My wife and Dad both got the Mizithra Cheese...portion sizes were VERY noticeable between the 2 (She got a LOT more).  Sometimes you you get the Mitzithra Cheese with WAY more than you need...sometimes you get a lot less.  

Service:

Well, it wasn't the best.  It took 20 minutes for anyone to come to the table...I had to go to the hostess and tell her that it's been 20 minutes and no one has even stopped by our table at all.  Once she showed up, it wasn't completely horrible.

The Old Spaghetti Factory used to be one of those places where you can go and meet up with the family for lunch/dinner and have good food as well as walk out of there full.  Their food used to be excellent and not taste like it came out of a microwave...or pre-cooked in bags like the Olive Garden."}
{"text":"I finally managed to make my way here after years of saying I would! Love the atmosphere in there. It's so...eccentric! And the food was good. Totally did not know you get a free dessert afterwards! Spumoni icecream was great. Win win situation :D"}
{"text":"This place is like your fave tried & true shoes. You know the ones. Yup those! Priced right, good sized menu & helpful staff. Love this place & have since I was a kid. I've had the pleasure of eating my fave mizithra with brown butter since I was a teen. Not sure why I chose that as a teen after my years hooked on the spaghetti with clam sauce but there you have it. They've since added another way to consume my fave by adding bacon & mushrooms to an already yummy dish. The bread still included & served hot with the garlic butter to shmear all over the place. Bleu cheese dressing still good too. Some things you just don't monkey with. In addition to how good everything tastes (not just my fave btw) the food is priced right. Where else is your drink albeit iced tea or milk included with your entrée & desert too?  No where. So your next trip check out the Old Spaghetti Factory."}
{"text":"Eh.

That's probably the best way to describe this place. We came in at 5:30 and were seated immediately, but then had to wait 15-20 mins just to get served water and begin ordering. The food itself took maybe another 10-15 minutes, which was fine, but honestly overall did not taste that fantastic. A mediocre soup, a plate of spaghetti and meatballs, and a small bowl of ice cream altogether was only around $17 pre-tip, so can't really complain.

Overall, my friend said it best: \"3 stars sums this place up perfectly.\""}
{"text":"Service was very good.  Food was better than average (expected).  Want a cheap meal without much fuss... this is the place."}
{"text":"I went there for lunch this past Sunday with a friend. I hadn't been to this location before, but had always had good food and service at other locations. The girl who waited on us took our order and brought us each a glass of wine. Someone else brought our food and then we were just left for quite a while. She NEVER offered another glass of wine or dessert, in fact, we wanted another glass of wine and when she FINALLY came back to our table she just asked if we were ready for our check. Seriously? This was, by far, the worst service I have ever had and the food wasn't even good. The only thing that was good was the bread. My fried calamari was undercooked and my friend's ravioli was lukewarm and tough. I would not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"We went here with our expectations quite low. After all, this was, and still is, a restaurant for kids. And one that I quite liked when I was one. I was hoping the same would be the case for my 3-year-old. 

He liked it. And I liked the decor. Same charming antiques that I remembered still lined the place. The difference? A wait staff that seemed to be annoyed by customers that decided to look at them. Apparently, we were getting in their way. Fair enough. But hey, perhaps the artifacts that line your restaurant should come down if you down if you actually don't want our eyes on them? But then that would mean you'd only have your food to rely on. 

Our server was just as cold. We felt like we were at Arby's on the side of the highway. No \"how are you doing\" or \"Is everything ok\". Just rushed, abrupt, unfriendly, almost annoyed service. It was as if she assumed that we were tourists and therefore could treat us like she'd never see us again. Well, we're not tourists, but I assure you, this was definitely our last visit. 

As for the food..where do I start. My wife's salad looked like it was fished out of the Mcdonald's trash bin. My soup was a step down from something in a can. And our \"pasta\" tasted like a Michelina's minus the microwavable box. 

I'm sentimental. Very much so, actually. But when the service and food is this bad, next time I'll get my fill of nostalgia on Youtube."}
{"text":"Took my girlfriend here last night for her birthday and we both loved it. Food was great and so was the service . Got seated super fast on a Saturday night and had a great time. Cool atmosphere and would recommend to everyone"}
{"text":"Spaghetti Factory is the definition of cheap and cheerful. 

Bowls of noodles with a variety of sauces, salad/soup and bread -- all for one low price. 

This is not a place that locals frequent - I think they must sustain most of their business from tourists or tour buses. The interior is kitchy/campy and has nothing to do with Italian food."}
{"text":"First time at The Old Spaghetti Factory. I love the ambiance and the food was delicious. I had the manager special. Plus it's all topped off with an ice cream dessert. Will be back again!"}
{"text":"Ah, The Old Spaghetti Factory. We first met in Tacoma whilst I played tourist almost 20 years ago. I've since bumped into you in Spokane, Denver and here in the homeland. For a chain, consistently good food for a good price. Salad and ice cream dessert included!"}
{"text":"When I was younger, I used to love The Old Spaghetti Factory.  Now that I've experienced finer dining, I think it's just okay.

Parking in this area can sometimes be an issue, and it's not close to the subway either.  Another inconvenience is that they don't take reservations, so you should plan on going a little earlier, especially for a large party.

I have been here a few times right before a show, and let the server know we had to be in and out quickly.  They recommended we steer away from the baked pastas, but we could have any of the other pastas fairly quickly.  

The mini loaves of bread come to you hot, and are served with regular whipped butter or garlic whipped butter.  We tend to go through a few loaves because it's so deliciously fresh.

If you can't decide on a pasta, the trio allows you to try 3 different red sauces on spaghetti.  I am also a fan of the fettuccine alfredo, although it's quite heavy.  When I'm not in a hurry, I usually have the lasagna.  There isn't anything overly exciting on their menu.  Everything I've tried at the Spaghetti Factory just tastes like a good home-cooked meal.  Some of the sauces are a little bland.  I find the portions quite generous and often take leftovers home.

The price is right, seeing as it's just pasta.  For a reasonable price your meal includes a soup or salad, ice cream for dessert and a coffee or tea.  Once upon a time they only offered Spumoni ice cream and I had to eat around the chunks of candy.  They have since eliminated the chunks and also offer vanilla and chocolate as well.  

Great if you're looking for a relatively inexpensive, simple, quick meal.  Nothing special unless you get to sit in one of the cool seats, like the ones in the trolley."}
{"text":"Worst place to eat, food doesn't have any flavor , I had lasagna ,smells and tasted bad, my son had spaghetti with meat balls,, ..  Bad, bad choices .The worst  way to spend your money."}
{"text":"After taking The Light Rail downtown for the Super Bowl Fan Fest, we saw this at one of our stops, and my wife and I decided we would come here on our way back. Boy, am I glad we did. The food was awesome, as was the service. We agreed that whenever we took Light Rail, on our way back, we will stop here for dinner."}
{"text":"We stopped here dinner on the way to an event in downtown Phoenix. We got there at 4 pm so they were not very busy yet. The service was excellent and they were very attentive. We had the Shrimp, Spinach and Artichoke appetizer and it was delicious. I highly recommend this appetizer. For an entree I got the Spagehetti Vesuvious. This is also a very flavorable dish with sausage, chicken and peppers. The sauce is blended and  comes on a large bed of spagehetti. The entree is good but not the best Italian I have had. If you are looking for good food and excellent service this is the place."}
{"text":"I've been here once while on a New Years eve trip. The restaurant itself is nice, it is very clean with cool amusement park/merry go round themed decor. There is a lot of space/tables there so the wait times aren't bad at all. 

For the prices, the food was average, nothing special and nothing that you couldn't make at home. It could possibly be that the food that my friend and I ordered was bland so if I ever get an opportunity to go back I will order something different."}
{"text":"I am saddened to see the low star reviews of this place. This restaurant has been a staple of Phoenix for so many years and has always offered a piece of Arizona History along with a great meal.

My history started with the Old Spagethii Factory many years ago...when my parents decided that this would be my \"thing\"
To do on my birthday. I am so glad that this year marks my 40th birthday celebration at the Factory and I would not give up the history for the world.

The food is always about what it is. My thousand island salad dressing is the favorite over anywhere else and I am pretty simple in my selection of food - rich meat with (1) meatball. Of course it all has to be started off with some awesome cheesy bread! 

If you ever have the time to walk in an just inspect the place, you will find all kinds of cool antiques and articles from years past. It's a virtual experience in treasure hunting.

But before you leave, also take the opportunity to ring the bell on the trolley, because you won't find many trolley cars you can eat in!!

Be kind to the businesses that make Phoenix a better place and know that if they didn't live up to a 5 star review, it is the exception and not the rule!"}
{"text":"I recently had my 17th birthday dinner at this location. And I can say for certain that I was less than impressed. The service was extremely mediocre. We had a waitress who was extremely rude to me and my guests. She unnecessarily yelled at us to lower our voices. It made everyone feel extremely uncomfortable. The food was mediocre as well. It all tasted very stale. And to top off the experience it took them about an hour to get us our checks. Once they got our checks, it took about another 45 minutes for them to get us our change. Overall I was very displeased with my birthday dinner. I will not be going again!"}
{"text":"Meh.  Tastes like a chain. Oh wait, it is! I've had worse food; I'll leave it at that."}
{"text":"I didn't really like it. It was very ordinary pasta. Nothing special, way over priced. I guess location is everything in this case. I don't think I would ever go there. My boy friend makes pasta much better... 
Also it's very busy , it was Sunday night and we had to wait for our table for about 30 min... Not worth it..."}
{"text":"Sometimes you just need an uncomplicated plate of spaghetti, and this is the place to go. I usually get the Manager's Favourite ($15.75) so I can try a couple of sauces, and I particularly like the spicy meat sauce and the brown butter with mizithra cheese. The decor is interesting, and one day I'd like to sit where the carousel is. The servers are not only friendly to the customers but also with each other, which is nice to see. I'll probably be back in the summer when it's nicer to walk around the area."}
{"text":"Ugh, I'd rather chew my own fingernails off then eat here. Considering last time I went there I was in agonizing pain a few hours later from something I ate there. Mentioned that to the manager when I phoned the next day, and was accused of trying to \"screw\" them out of some free gift cards. Yeah. I'm good not going back."}
{"text":"Environment is like antique chronic very nice atmosphere good place to take your family one time experience for you or many special occasions or even once a week or eight times you experience the converse for your family to eat in at least one time and make a moose the food is awesome there with them that the staff is friendly our server Luke was very awesome I would go back and recommend this to all my family and friends"}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant a couple times and each experience was pleasant. 

I think the atmosphere and dynamic of this restaurant is very unique, it always puts a smile on my face. The carnival decoration is very corky and fits the space quite well. There are a lot of good instagram ops especially if you are seated in one of the merry go round areas or the railway cart. 

The services is great, the servers always check up on you and they bring the food out quite quickly even when the restaurant is extremely busy. 

The food is delicious for the price you are paying, I personally like my food with more seasoning which you can totally add more with the black pepper and red chill flakes offered on your table. 

Overall a great place to go to with family or friends, I like to take my friends who are new to Toronto here because I think it's a good overall experience."}
{"text":"If you've been to one Old Spaghetti Factory you've been to them all. Quirky indoor seating and ambience which makes the experience fun when there are a lot of people in the restaurant. The four of us all ordered the lunch option which is basically like the dinner option of pasta with your choice of sauce but a smaller portion. If you expect this to be gourmet it's not but if you expect it to be franchise Italian food then you won't be disappointed. Service was quick and no complaints on the food or price."}
{"text":"This place gave me the creeps.

Not a great opening line but once you step into this place you will know what I mean. This place is vintage creepy and does not look like its been cleaned or dusted since the 1800's. Its dark and dingy inside the interior and this gives it a weird vibe. There are some cool artifacts scattered around the place but its so overwhelming that it becomes tacky.

The menu selection looks impressive but the food is anything but. I ordered a lasagna ($16.50) and my GF ordered a penne arrabiata.( $17.50) we shared both dishes. Its hard for me to justify paying anything over $15 for pasta but I was craving italian food and this place is on the way home. 

For those prices I was expecting a glamourous \"vegas\" style dish but instead it came out like I was at some dive diner on the roadside of the Interstate 90. the only word to properly describe the presentation is \"SHLOP\" which is basically food you feed to pigs. I pictured the chef with a beer belly and cigarette hanging out of his mouth as he prepared our meals.

The service is \"Meh\", I had to remind the waiter several times for our Tea and Coffee that was included with our meal. It seemed like he was doing me a huge favour everytime he came by. 

Won't be coming back here again unless they have some sort of restaurant intervention or something. 

This place is depressing."}
{"text":"I have been here three times with large parties (I.e., bridal, birthday, business). Those experiences were wonderful. However I always had to eat what was on the prepared menu for that party. I have wanted to try this place alone for some time.

I choose the l late afternoon lunch hour being quiet and empty. My server was Jim and he was wonderfully attentive. He suggested the  Mizithra with browned butter. I selected that with lasagne and broccoli. The meal came with bread, salad and spumoni. 

The salad was good, average, and the Lasange was ok. The portions were excellent in comparison to other restraunts. The bread was a bit hard. However it is sourdough roll and typically they are. It was hot and had a great taste. The Mizithra was phenomenal. Must try if you stop by. I'm glad he didn't tell me it was sheep/goat cheese first or I may not have tried it. This must be their signature dish because I would return for this and the service. 

I would have given five stars if the lasagne was as good as it was the the time I came here. Too inconsistent 

The best part was the Mizithra, server Jim, and the spumoni. The ambiance is nice too.. Very calming.

In my opinion, the Old Spaghetti Factory is much better as a large party or catering type establishment. 

I will definitely return"}
{"text":"Well after being out of the country for quite some time, my sister and I wanted some real Italian food. But... this is Arizona... does it even exist if we don't cook it ourselves? 

We were desperate and Olive Garden is just meh to us. We only enjoy their free bread and salad so that was out of the question. After quite some time, we decided on Old Spaghetti Factory... I took her here once for her birthday and the food was decent so we decided to give it another go.

This time around, it wasn't all that great. The waitress seems to be all over the place. I had to ask twice for the water to be refilled. When we order she also ask us \"lunch or dinner\" portions but completely left out what the difference was. 

Anyways to the food.

We were all hungry so the appetizer was quickly devoured. The sausage and cheesy garlic bread was pretty good, my brother seems to enjoy it a lot but the olive tapenade was just okay, nothing special.

Oh and on another note the free bread should have been brought out with the appetizers, no? It was brought out with our food...

So yeah, the food came out and it wasn't all that good. The marinara sauce was a little on the sour side. And it seems like all their dishes use that one sauce. Needless to say, very dissapointing. All 5 dishes... from lasagna to chicken parmesan to silicon meatballs .... all taste the same...

I don't think I will be returning."}
{"text":"I love this place back at home but I have to say the girl who took our name to be seated was very passive aggressive... I hate leaving bad reviews but this wasn't good service... If u look at my other reviews you will find I never really rate badly... I try to rate things I like not hate... But she was annoying maybe it's cuz I'm from Los Angeles and in that city we have a lot of respect for our clients... Not only did she lie and say we r at our reservation time (which we did time ourselves it was 15+ min over 30min which was the original time) but she was snippy and rude and was defiantly not what I want to see when I'm being greeted. The waitress was nice she took out order and smiled she took 5 min to say hello but this place looks pretty busy so that was ok. She was very sweet! And she was super quick with the rest of the meal! Food was Out in maybe 15 tops after we told her we needed to rush back. Her name was Tanika and she was wonderful! She really turned our experience around! 

Also the sinks in the girls room would not stop dropping and that's really wasteful... Conserve water people..."}
{"text":"Such a great family friendly restaurant. The vibe at this place is worth coming for. As for their food, I would stick to the simpler dishes- spaghetti and meatballs, salads, soups. Their lasagna is not very good. But their clam chowder and Spumoni ice cream is to die for! Every time I come here, I always regret not just ordering a dinner portion of clam chowder and spumoni ice cream."}
{"text":"2 for $25.00 with appetizer, soup our salad, 2 entrees, and ice cream. Ordered garlic cheesy bread, Italian sausage, meat balls, soup, and pistachio/strawberry/chocolate ice cream. Usually I think Italian food is overly salty or buttery but the dishes here weren't too salty. The soup wasn't bad, but wasn't anything fabulous. The ice cream was delicious because of the pistachio. Service was quick, nice and helpful. Very cute indoor decor as well."}
{"text":"It's an old spaghetti factory.... Good value for your food, flavorful and big plate sizes. On a side note for my American friends visiting, if you though OSF was a good value in the states wait till you see the prices here and convert them to USD"}
{"text":"Look, it's a warehouse not fine dining. But great value and a location that can't be way. I gave it more stars because the wait staff is a cut above what you typically see. On a Thursday night last week, our waiter Nick entertained us with stories about his European vacation while never letting the beer glasses empty. Decent food, cold beer, fun crowd. I'll go back"}
{"text":"Definitely 'food in a bag'. Plus they rip you off and don't bring you dessert when it's included in your meal."}
{"text":"Really nice décor.  Delicious food.  Parking sucks and can only imagine what it's like during a lunch or dinner rush.  Maybe there's more parking \"out back\" but it's pretty sparse ... and narrow."}
{"text":"Not bad.  The place is nicely decorated, the service is decent and so is the food.  I got the spaghetti with meatball.  Nothing fancy but it felt like \"home\".  The bread comes out hot which is nice and as previous posters have mentioned, you get a scoop of ice cream with your meal and the spumoni is DELICIOUS.

I definitely wouldn't mind coming her again when we are in the area but wouldn't drive across town to have it."}
{"text":"Visited this establishment the other day and while the decor was hella funky and old school, it worked for the restaurant. Server was good but kitchen was slow to prepare our food. Overall the food was ok at best but a bit of a let down. Didn't taste like they make their own pasta which was disappointing. Overall it was a different experience but won't return, many much better options in the city."}
{"text":"Similar to Eastside Mario's in the sense that this restaurant isn't known to be high quality, but you always get the best bang from your buck.  Really big place that's spread out over such a wide area, that an annoying crowd at the front may not even be noticed in the back.  Casual/family atmosphere but not \"too\" family necessarily.  Warm lighting.  Wooden tables, old-fashioned (but clean) carpets, random decorations, lots of stained-glass, but most notably, a big merry-go-round in the middle.  Tons of staff.  Bathroom shared with the bar next door so people walking around is the norm.  A bit loud from how busy the place usually is, but not the music.  Friendly enough service.  Newsprint place mat menus.  Your choice of soup or salad comes with the entree, and their Caesar is surprisingly good.  Decent minestrone.  Also comes with ice cream for dessert but only once in my party (of usually four people) did one of us ask for it as we are too full 90% of the time.Very good prices for what you get.  Yummy spaghetti with browned butter with mizitrha cheese?  Never heard of it but similar to a cross between parmesan and crumbled ricotta?  The portion doesn't look huge at first, but is quite filling.  Good penne with chicken.  Can't seem to find the drink menu online but they have a standard selection for a casual, family place.  On one occasion, the four of us ordered two half litres of white wine and two pints of draft.  The whole bill came to $88 which was definitely good considering we were all buzzed and full.  LOL   Go back?  Definitely...but only when in the area and starving looking to fill a cheap pasta craving."}
{"text":"Great place, friendly people, very cool old house turned into a restaurant. The server was not all there, he must have been new. I asked him three times for lemon for water, took him twice to bring a Corona, and he not once checked up on us after our main courses were served to see how the food was. That leads to this, because I was waiting ever so patiently for him to come back and ask - my pasta was very dry, not much sauce on it. I wanted to see if I could have another side of sauce but it seriously took him so long to come back I ended up just eating it. It was a good dish, I'm trying to check the menu right now but it's not showing up. It was veruceli (sp?) pasta, the spiciest on the menu, which I would give it a 6/10 for spicyness. Good place though with decent prices!"}
{"text":"Food was good, wasn't spectacular. The lobster ravioli was mediocre. All you could taste was cheese, having said that it was still good. I just wish the lobster was more present. The free bread and garlic butter was delicious and unlimited. Decor was interested and our server was great. Service was a little slow but what do you expect on a Saturday night in Toronto. Overall recommend."}
{"text":"I love this place!! We habe been here several times.  The service is always exceptional,  the wait is always short,  and the food is always on point! We have  tried multiple things of the menu.  From lasagna to the taste of Italy,  the mitzritha and brown butter sauce (yum) they even offer gluetin free pasta now!!! A decent house wine and mixed drinks.  Love the atmosphere, and decor. The kids enjoy it too and love to visit! They like the ice cream that comes with their meals (they never really get sweets,  so it is a very special treat) I love that even if we have a large group or it is just me and the hubbs we get the same great service."}
{"text":"I worked at the Old Spaghetti Factory for two week's and the food was MICROWAVED and management was terrible.

 The only good things about the Old Spaghetti Factory is my coworkers were awesome, everybody was very friendly and the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Oh boy, I wish we lived closer to here. 10 of us felt the same.....huge menu and everything superb. Ambiance is really quaint. I can't imagine a legit bad review"}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice in the last three months. I love the spaghetti with mizithra cheese. The first time we went we had to send back our salads because the lettuce was brown. Not just a piece or two but at leadt 70%.  Two days sgo our appetizer plates were filthy. We sent them back and the second set was dirty as well."}
{"text":"I thought our waiter's Herculean effort would lift a pretty bad experience here to two stars, but this was easily my worst dining experience in a week-long trip to Calgary.

First, the place seemed very understaffed. Waiters were hurrying from table to table, and were nice enough to let us know they were incredibly busy and service would likely be slower than normal, but the surprise was that there were several vacant tables. Even without being full, the restaurant didn't seem to have enough people working to attend to everyone in a timely manner.

The menu didn't give any hint as to what items were vegan or could be made vegan. Seeing very little, we opted for the spaghetti and marinara sauce. Despite this incredibly simple order, and our friend having chicken and spaghetti, we faced a really long wait. Our server apologized for the long wait, but obviously it wasn't their fault.

When we got our food, it was incredibly bland and seemed very processed. The salad equally seemed to be like a iceberg lettuce mix you'd buy from the store. The food was all-around disappointing, and it wasn't even at a reasonable price.

Our server did their best, but with my terrible food (in my opinion) and such a long wait, I have to give this the one star it deserves.


I do wish they would abolish tipping though, just read this paragraph: 

Studies have shown that tipping is not an effective incentive for performance in servers. It also creates an environment in which people of color, young people, old people, women, and foreigners tend to get worse service than white males. In a tip-based system, nonwhite servers make less than their white peers for equal work. Consider also the power imbalance between tippers, who are typically male, and servers, 70 percent of whom are female, and consider that the restaurant industry generates five times the average number of sexual harassment claims per worker. And that in many instances employers have allegedly misused tip credits, which let owners pay servers less than minimum wage if tipping makes up the difference.

Citations for those claims can be found here: http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/08/15/the-case-against-paying-waiters-in-tips-in-one-irrefutable-paragraph/"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and friendly staff.  However, the food is far overpriced and very average.  Nothing special at all here.  Can't say I would go out of my way to go back."}
{"text":"Not bad for an Italian restaurant, especially for someone like an East Coast native like me who is used to the best Italian food outside of Italy. The restaurant itself is quirky and fun, full of stained glass and other old things. Tables are arranged inside little \"rooms\", giving your party some space and quiet from other diners. The seating area at the bar is a great place to wait for your table (yes, you will wait, because this is one of the best Italian restaurants in Phoenix). Old barber chairs are arranged in the middle of the bar area, perfect for conversation and a bit of fun. AND, the restaurant is along the Light Rail, which means you don't have to drive downtown if you don't want to, although there is ample parking behind the restaurant."}
{"text":"love every time we go wish the portion sizes were a bit bigger though but everything is wonderful thanks osf my favorite is half mizithra  cheese and half mushroom sauce with some meatballs or meat sauce also love the pesto ranch dressing"}

{"text":"Regardless of how impeccable the service, I won't eat anything but the cheesy bread here voluntarily.  ...and I have eaten here a LOT.

This place is fairly easy to find: it's in the outdoor segment of Chandler Fashion Center, and is by the parking lot.

The decor is awesome...seriously, amazing.  Every seating area is unique and has its own charm.  From a romantic date to a huge familly, there is an area of the seating chart that is meant for you.  I love it...it helps me get through dinner, honestly.

The meals all come with the bread, salad, and spumoni (italian neopolitan ice cream), so you pay for everything in the price of your entree...honestly, that's a good deal.  The wait staff is phenomenal; they're always helpful, friendly, there when you want them, yet unobtrusive and quiet.  We've stopped the manager several times to praise an employee's outstanding service, so they are making the right hiring decisions.

The first time we ate here, I had ravioli and hubs had the rich meat sauce spaghetti.  It was easily the least flavorful ravioli I have ever eaten.  The saucing was sparse and had no boldness.  I'm not a huge fan of the sourdough bread.  The spumoni was FANTASTIC, but that was after I hated all the food and hey, I already love ice cream.  On the opposite end, my husband LOVED his food.  I tried it and thought it was the most boring spaghetti I have ever eaten.  There was nothing rich or meaty about the sauce--I personally think jar spaghetti sauce tastes better.

Second time, had the spaghetti squash; this was better, but just was interesting texturally more than taste wise. This time we had the cheesy garlic bread.  THIS is their best item.  It's melty, cheesy, garlicy wonderful on a still crisp perfect loaf.  I ate this happily and finally had a good mood after coming here.

Third time I tried the spaghetti with the light sauce, also same thing: it's so BLAND!  Seriously, I would guess that only those recovering or on plain diets would like this food...I can't fathom why my husband likes it (he keeps picking it when it's his turn, which is why I keep giving other menu items a chance...I have no choice except not to eat!).  I LOVED OSF in Houston, Texas, so I don't know what is up with this location, but it is just such bland food!

I don't like the lasagna, spaghetti, ravioli...so what exactly is the point of eating here???  I love my husband, that's basically it.  I've started getting takeout here so he can eat his boring spaghetti and I can pick up authentic Italian from elsewhere.

I feel badly because this place has such a good atmosphere and great staff, but I just don't care for the food.  I've had spaghetti, ravioli, and lasagna in Italy repeatedly, so maybe I just prefer the fresh flavorful experience and can't resign myself to this place's humdrum attitude toward food.  I still say save your $40 and go to Vincitorio's!!!"}
{"text":"Good Old Spaghetti Factory. Tried and true. Honestly the food is awesome for the quality and quantity you get. Our daughter loves it and my wife has a secret crush on the place.  The price is right so we make a run for the OSF once a month or so."}
{"text":"I dont know why people on here are complaining about the service, maybe negative nancies or people who dont have the patience, or I went on a good day. Me and my bf went here for dinner tonight to celebrate me getting a job. The service was great and the price is justifiable given that its a 3 course dinner for 12.50 (got the sausage in meat sauce), which you get bread, soup or salad, your entree and either vanilla or spumoni ice cream for dessert. We have to come here again during the 4 course meal 2 for 25$."}
{"text":"Showed up at 7:10 on a busy Friday night, was told there was a 40 minute wait for a table for two.  Fortunately that only ended being 10 minutes, and by 8:00pm my friend and had finished our meals and paid our tab... Shayna our server was great, the food was kicked out quick, bread was piping hot and very excellent, salad was good.  My Spaghetti with meat sauce was perfect as was my friends Lasagna. We got out for $34 with tip, ice cream dessert included.  I absolutely love this classic old school restaurant.  Too many naysayers with negative reviews on here!  This place is a winner!  Great decor, old school video games, very charming!"}
{"text":"Ok so this two for $25 promotion they're doing Sunday-Thursday all day is an unbelievable value!  My friend and I opted for this!  We didn't really want the half decanter of wine so our server said we could both get Italian Sodas and keep the glasses, sounded good to me!  We get our salads, then a huge order of fried zucchini, and our bread. That would've been more than enough for the both of us!  I've had the meat sauce at other locations and it's awesome!  This is why they get a star deduction.  The meat sauce at this location was not too bueno tonight.  Too much oregano!  That being Said, we took a ton of food home!  The food was served promptly, and the manager even came Around twice to check on us!  Clean restaurant, and tremendous value. Just work on that meat sauce recipe!"}
{"text":"The food is horrible.. Please have your corporate company's hire a new cook staff and fix this restaurant."}
{"text":"Decided to go here instead of Olive Garden, parking is small, had to make a U-turn on the next major street when I couldn't find parking. Hubby and I waited only 10 min on a Saturday night at 8 pm. We both got the lasagna, the bread they gave us was super hot and yummy, I got the minestrone soup and the hubby a salad. The salad tasted a tad funky, my hubby said the ranch dressing tasted weird.... I got the minestrone soup which tasted home made, filled with veggies. We finally got our lasagna; kind of small portion, Tate's like your standard homemade pasta, nothing special... It was okay, we were looking for the pizzazz of some sort... Price was great, for the both of us it was 31 dollars. We probably wouldn't come again tho, it was a nice experience to try something new and different."}
{"text":"The Old Spaghetti Factory is a To institution for many. Just mention it and you will get a knowing nod from most of the good folk who make up the city. It's well run and the food is decent and fairly priced. The kitchy interior is over the top fantastic, like something out of a Willie Wonka move set. It's great to have an interior that takes peoples attention away from their phones, even briefly. 
The crush of people on the Saturday night we were there was amazing. But the staff handle it well. Even though we had a reservation, we still had to wait and the buzzer pager they give you is put to use. Right next door is the Amsterdam Bicycle Club so you could head over there to see more kitsch with the stained glass and check out the action at the bar.
We also had fun waiting when a guy took on the challenge from one of the win a prize with a loonie game, there's a giant gumball machine, and once inside there is a replica TTC street car to dine inside. Lots of fun especially if you have a diverse crowd to take out on the town."}
{"text":"i love this location.

been going there since i was a wee lad.

food is just average.  service is always OK.

but it reminds me of childhood so i always go back."}
{"text":"Last night I just couldn't do it. You know, the whole dinner thang. So you'd better believe I jumped on the opportunity to pick dinner up as I was walking by the Old Spaghetti Factory on my way home from work.

When I first walked in, I was greeted warmly by Rob. I asked him for a couple of recommendations on meat dishes, and I also asked for a couple of recommendations on veggie dishes. He was AMAZINGLY helpful and honest. My experience at the Old Spaghetti Factory was off to a WONDERFUL start.

I then sat in the lounge and ordered with Greg. Greg was great! He quickly punched my order in and entertained me as he poured drinks for the customers in the lounge. He was completely on the ball and the second my food was ready, he went back to the kitchen and walked it right over to me. A total pro!!!

When I got home, I found the entrees I had ordered perfectly packed, and included was a warm loaf of bread, two kinds of butter, and take-out cutlery. The food was delicious and they had it ready for me within 10 minutes of me ordering it!

My experience of the Old Spaghetti Factor was excellent. I owe it all to Rob & Greg. The dream team I tell ya! If you've been unhappy with your experience here as of late, request these two gentlemen! They know their shiat!"}
{"text":"interesting decor (got seated on the bus), but nothing too special about the food."}
{"text":"I love this place quite a bit. My friends and I frequent it for special occasions usually. The servers are always super nice and knowledgeable about what is on the menu, which is lovely because one of my friends doesn't eat pork so he has to ask about certain items. The food itself is very good. They have decent portions and I usually try something I've never had before. 
Very pretty building that just had a modern cosmetic renovation at the front entrance to put in a ramp. It has easy access to the light rail and bus stops too."}
{"text":"It's a chandler staple and if you just want decent spaghetti with a choice of sauce I think it's worth it.  Your meal also comes with a soup or salad and an ice cream.  I personally love the spamoni!"}
{"text":"I was there Thursday with a large party which they were not ready for in spite of a reservation.  The only thing worse than the service is the food.  Pure garbage.  If you're the Old Spaghetti Factory, you should know how to do spaghetti, right?  Wrong!  It was an under cooked clump of mush with cold white sauce.  One fork full and done.  Even though the wait staff struggled to get orders out, no management in sight.  Too bad, they missed the last time I'll ever eat there.
You'd be better off eating out of the dumpster in back."}
{"text":"The food was sub-par at best. The best thing about this place is the price you pay for your food which is pretty decent. you get a salad (ceaser/garden) , unlimited bread, your main course and ice cream. The food really has so taste. I ordered the lasagna and my ceaser salad tasted better I went here for a work party, my co-worker and I got really sick the following day."}
{"text":"Its one of my favorite places to eat. They have large portions and good value, but their menu focuses on their specialties, mostly Italian pastas.

I love the ambiance, especially the old trolley car and the headboards between the booths. And it has a classy feel without being stuffy. Unfortunately they have a raging mosquito problem and it's been noticeable just about every time I've eaten here. I've spoken to management and they're aware of the problem and working on it.

The staff has always been pretty friendly and quick to help with anything needed.

I really miss the spaghetti squash, which they don't carry any more. But I'll continue coming here."}
{"text":"I hear the Toronto location is nicer than the B.C. location and has better service: P
I gave it 3 stars for the very simple reason the food is consistently ok and reasonable price.  Consistency means a lot to me.   No, you won't think you are in Italy, but what do you want for an all in meal for $20.00.  If you want a cheap place to bring the kids to celebrate a birthday, this is it. The pina coladas are real good and if you have enough of them, the food will taste better."}
{"text":"i can honestly say i've never had a bad experience at this restaurant! my boyfriend and i come here at least once a month... it is ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC!! price, quality, service... JUST EXCELLENT!"}
{"text":"Had a bad first impression and almost walked out when we were waiting for a table and I sat at the bar to get a drink while I waited. I was ignored by no minimum of 5 waiters who were making drinks. They looked busy but they weren't. No one apologized for ignoring me or even acknowledged me! However, we were seated right before I walked out and our waitress was wonderful. The food was delicious and we had a wonderful meal."}
{"text":"It gets the job done friendly staff average food. If you are looking for a fine dining Italian food restaurant this is NOT the place"}
{"text":"I have been eating at this pasta house for 35 + years In Phx, Tempe, Scottsdale and now, Chandler. I really don't have a bad thing to say, thank god . The  spaghetti is al dente, fresh and consistently great. Sure, I've tried different things on the menu but generally, My order is always the same which cuts back on complaining! 

Mazithra cheese with brown butter is my go to. I know it's a little salty, but with sourdough bread and butter (you can request olive oil), creamy pesto salad and a lil Spumoni, it all comes together. 

Tonight, I was solo and even though the dining and a huge private patio party was packed, service at the bar was smooth, friendly and quick. Couldn't be happier! 

Great for huge group parties, big family dining and a quick inexpensive bite for 1-10."}
{"text":"I hear a lot of people give The Old Spaghetti Factory a hard time but I'd have to say that I always enjoy eating here.

Sitting inside the restaurant feels like I'm part of a circus theme. A large telephone booth size dining for two tucked to one side, merry-go-round horses in the middle, and you can even eat inside the streetcar. The dining area can be a little dark at times but the stained glass décor and lighting gives that extra bit of lit charm.

The food has always been good but that is probably because I only order the Lobster Ravioli. I love their Lobster Ravioli! It is full of flavour with marinara and cream sauce. They include sourdough bread with whipped butter, spumoni ice cream, and house salad which I always upgrade to a Caesar salad.

Service can be slow when the restaurant is full and there have been times when there aren't too many visitors when the service is still a little slow. As soon as you see your server, let them know all the things you need to make your dinner right and they will make you feel right at home.

{"text":"It's been 20 years since been here and now I know why. Service was bad, food was slightly better than  something I'd make at home. It will be Twenty years before I go back."}
{"text":"Great OSF menu I've known to love. Couple local appetizer selections which was cool. Great spot and decor. Fast service."}
{"text":"I was here last night for a group function and wondered how this place is still around? Do families like it? I guess it's sort of a cheap meal out since you get salad and ice cream with your meal. I had the penne with sausage, and it was completely unremarkable.

The old timey decor and 80s furniture is very hard on the senses, but I guess you should expect that given the name of the restaurant. This gets 2 stars only because the service was very helpful and there are more beers on tap than you would expect in a restaurant where you can eat in an old streetcar."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch on a Sunday after running around the Children's Museum for a few hours.  I usually frequent the Fullerton, CA location which is always a 30 minute-1.5 hour wait for dinner so was really excited when they took our party of 2+2 kids in less than 5 minutes.  

Our waiter was very attentive and made sure we had everything we needed - especially the kids.  Luckily, they were on their best behavior even though they were exhausted.  I think the staff was appreciative that they were mostly clean and quiet.  We ordered the ravioli, spaghetti with Italian sausage and 2 kid's macaroni and cheeses.  I love that their meals are served \"complete\" with a salad, bread, and ice cream or spumoni.  Even the kids got milk, applesauce, and dessert as well.  

The kids loved the train, and the staff encouraged us to explore and ring the bell.  We quietly tip-toed through the car (between other eating patrons) to the front and rang the bell while both were over the moon with excitement.  

Tasty lunch with great customer service - thanks OSF Phoenix!"}
{"text":"I feel like the menu here is pretty limited. Yes, I know it's Italian food and they do have GF options but they don't have any good choices for seafood based Italian.  For instance, mussels in marinara?  Service was fine and quick."}
{"text":"the place is very good with the food but the service suck today. William was the server he messed up wife plate and brought out icecream while 2 people eating there lunch. it took 1 hour we got our meal saying there was a party before us."}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed this establishment and have eaten at maybe 12 of them all around the country. I only have gotten one dish through all these years and that is really the only reason to go to OSF - get the mizithra spagetti with browned butter. Now that prices for a full meal have nearly doubled (for dinner), the best time to go is during lunch. You still get a giant hot loaf of sourdough bread with real butter, salad or soup and entree for $7.99. Originally, our waiter said the ice tea and desert (scoop of decent sherbert or average spumoni) was extra, but I guess he was feeling nice and he offered those items for free. This cheese is really good when combined with the butter and it is always one of my fav dishes and never had a bad meal at any OSF across the land (west of Nashville only). 
    Yeah, its an old building, but this is one of the original factories and that lends some charm. Love the spaghetti tree up front and they even have an old school phone booth (with closing doors) to sit in and remember the good ole' days of pay phones and rotary dialing."}
{"text":"omg. sitting in the bar because they had no seating in main diningroom.  menus flung onto the table, no greeting from server. when i mentioned it to the server. she gets an attitude. food comes out, cold and unappetizing.... having to listen to a guy at the next table scream, use the f bomb every other sentence.
manager did bring our hot food out personally so we got to talk. this is not the place i remember to come and dine and enjoy........"}
{"text":"Not a fan of this place we went on Friday for my daughters birthday and the food was not tasty at all. Here is some of the issues I have
When you go as a big party the tip is automatically included in your meal which in my opinion makes the waiting staff not care about the level of service they provide. I understand the pay for a server is lower than any other profession but for this reason you have to have the customer service skills to make people want to give you a good tip. 
The food was not good at all!!!
There was no flavor in any of it and if I can make better homemade spaghetti from scratch 
I expect an Italian restaurant to make some better than me. 
The dishes were dirty. They gave you clear plastic cups for water and sodas and you can see how dirty the dishes are, it just makes you question what else they don't clean right. Never again will I come to the spaghetti factory I would rather go else where or make my own if I am in need of some Italian food."}
{"text":"The Old Spaghetti Factory is an excellent choice of dining for both family and small dates. The price is fair, the food is made well and the service is above average.

The atmosphere is probably the biggest plus about this place. The restaurant has a fun but rustic feel with old wood barrels stacked about and a trolley car fitted with tables for dining in. The antique dining furniture combined with healthy portions of good food make this one of my favorite restaurant chains.

Free ice cream after a meal doesn't hurt its repertoire either."}
{"text":"Was so excited to try a new place as from Tucson we don't get many Italian choices! We waited 20-25 minutes for a table which I know it's the day after Christmas and it's busy? But that wasn't quite the point, every server maybe had 2 tables it wasn't busy at all! We got seated and then began to look around at other tables and they didn't have drinks or food. About 15-20 went by and our server came by I ordered a coffee and water- he stated no coffee was made and it would be 15 more minutes. At this point I'm already irritated and ready to go, we place our order for food soup, salad & entree. No bread or soup was brought to the table before and my coffee didn't event make it to me. At this point I'm starving an we decide to walk to the front and tell the host we decided on something different! Needless to say the reviews and the restaurant style have so much potential, the service needs quite a bit of work! Hopefully I can try it someday with faster service!"}
{"text":"Had dinner and a mystery here. 
The acting staff was very engaging and fun. If you go there prepared to interact with other people, you'll have a good time! If you're lucky, they may recruit you into the show. Though you may not see this as luck... ;]
The food was good, though not a place I would visit just for the food. 
The scoop of dessert afterward...now that was delicious!
I would visit again if the opportunity presented itself, but only in the mystery dinner capacity."}
{"text":"Enjoyed this place two weeks ago. Entree bread dessert. Good service. Took care of the family. Love that.

We will definitely be back. Plus the quoted wait time was much less than the actual wait time.

Our server checked on us every few minutes and made sure that our birthday meals were awesome!"}
{"text":"If you go here for anything other than the Mizithra cheese and browned butter sauce on spaghetti you probably will be disappointed. That is the signature dish and it cannot be found anywhere else, but your kitchen. Also, if you join the factory club on Facebook, they are always sending you great coupons. Today, I had one that added 5oz of pasta (basically an upgrade to dinner-size meal) for free. The lunch meal is $7.99, but after some confusion with the coupon and OSF's  \"special rules on upgrading a lunch entree\" the manager gave me the $7.99 price. This dinner size is huge and contained a large amount of that browned butter and tons of the Mizithra cheese. Still a great dish and the hot bread is also still legendary. Yeah, the salad is iceberg, but that's just a  bonus. Pretty cool server named Brandon and leftovers this time - very rare for me with that dish."}
{"text":"I have been going to this restaurant for about 18 years just so i can get my pesto ranch fix. A few things that will never change..this is a burn and turn establishment.  You will be eating your salad when the main meal comes out. We are not paying for a four course meal.  The atmosphere is kitchy and its fun!   The location in Seattle is my favorite but now living in Phoenix, I make the trip to get downtown. I finally convinced my boyfriend to take the trip last sunday and he was very impressed with quality and price. So much that when we woke up this morning he said he wanted to go there again for lunch today. We usually make our way straight to the lounge so we do not have to wait to get seated and so we can watch sports on tv while enjoying our meal.   We had the same server last week who is very quiet but prompt.  Do not expect the best service, as a past server, smaller checks (food is cheap) means smaller tips and servers are not as frantic to help you out.  

As far as the menu, get the cheesy garlic bead, get the ranch!!!!!!!!!!!!  It is mixed with pesto.  I will sometimes ask for a to-go container just so I can have some at home. JESUS DEAR LORD it is amazing.  All of the pasta dishes taste about the same but make sure that you get brown butter Mazitha pasta.  After having this years ago, i make this at home but it is still never as good.  

I will always come back to this place.  I love it."}
{"text":"Expected to find the best pasta sauce and best dishes. Beautiful decoration not at par with their food.... Please improve your pasta sauce! I will give them another chance in the future because of the decoration."}
{"text":"Heard that it opened up on 36th and was out with a friend interested in trying it out, so we decided to stop by for dinner tonight. It was my first time ever at an Old Spaghetti Factory. The decor is great and staff were friendly and helpful. Service was excellent. Their menu has an \"All Included\" feature which allows you to have the choice of soup or salad, vanilla or spumoni (pistachio, chocolate, vanilla) ice cream, and coffee or tea included.

Is the Food Good?
I had the minestrone soup and spaghetti with clam sauce and baby clams. The soup was great, although the portion size was a bit smaller than expected--and limited to one bowl (so no unlimited soup/salad). The flavours were balanced and it had a bit of spiciness that wasn't overpowering that was a pleasant surprise that I enjoyed. My spaghetti noodles were cooked fine, but the clam sauce was bland and could do with a boost of flavour. The spumoni ice cream was ice cream.
My friend had the clam chowder and linguini pesto with chicken added. I didn't try any, but she had no complaints about the clam chowder and said it was good. There was basically an oil spill pooled at the bottom of her plate that was pretty unappetizing. The cherry tomatoes placed on top were raw and uncooked, and probably could've benefited with being cooked through. They warmed up through residual heat, which made them raw, slightly warmed, cherry tomatoes.

Is it Worth the Money?
The prices are crazy cheap. Every entree was under $15. So it surprised me when the drinks were still the average restaurant mark-up of $3. The dinner menu is roughly 2-3 dollars more expensive than the lunch menu, which I thought was great. Incredible value from a pure price perspective.
Combined with how the food was, it was just okay. I wouldn't say it was really worth the money since my food ended up so bland. If the entree had more flavour, I would say it is an amazing deal for everything you get. I might try it again and order something else."}
{"text":"My husband hadn't been to this place in years and asked to go for his birthday. So I chose the newer one in Chandler. The decor was nice, private booths were perfect. The service was good, I did tell them it was my husbands 50th birthday. But only a nod and smile no Happy Birthday. That was disappointing. So, we ordered the Shrimp Capellini and the Lasagna and Spaghetti. We both loved the Shrimp Capellini, but the red sauce on the Spaghetti was not very good.  Bland. The bread was fresh and hot. The salad was good except it had too much dressing. Next time we go we will ask for it on the side. We both had the strawberry peach Marg which was very good. 
Next visit, we will not be ordering the red sauce again. We were so full we didn't get to the desert. But all in all we would go again, it was affordable."}
{"text":"I think this place has to be my all time favourite restaurant. I've had many birthdays here at this restaurant growing up. I actually spent my first birthday here right in the carousel tables, on that day I was kissed on the cheek by Doug Gilmore. He noticed my mother and grandmother were celebrating so he came over , my grandmother said afterwards \"I love the blue jays!!\" And my mom's face went bright pink in colour. Lol 
I love spaghetti and the decor in this place is spectacular. I hope they never change a thing. Great memories, great food, great fun."}
{"text":"Had dinner here with my family, Tim served us and was great! Food was excellent, prompt, and came with some entertaining personality from our waiter.
Will definitely come visit this place again."}
{"text":"The problem here is not the food, but the front reservation desk.  We had to put out name in for table twice.  With 12 people sitting to eat the wait time was terrible."}
{"text":"Came here with a large group.  This explained the slow service, since they wanted to bring out meals for everybody at the same time (still waited almost 45 minutes for a salad).  The service was good considering how many people there were.

I got the clam sauce spaghetti and it was quite bland.  It was definitely not worth the wait.  The salad was just some carrots, lettuce, and dressing.  Again, nothing special.  Ended up leaving before the dessert was even brought out. 

The cutlery was, unfortunately, not clean.  There was a clear lipstick mark on one of the cups from before and both my forks had some dried out sauce on them still."}
{"text":"It was my first time here. I called ahead and ordered the chicken Alfredo to go which was  $16.50. There was nothing special about it, and with Pasta I expect to be fully satisfied but the portion wasn't very much for nearly $20. Now I'm still hungry :(

If you're in the mood for good Pasta at around the same price try Vagabondo just up the street on Wellington."}
{"text":"When for dinner the other night with the family I had to say old-school vibe with old-school Ttc. Streetcar inside onto the food food was excellent well presented and well portioned staff were friendly and outgoing desserts were excellent tea coffee good  Love the old-school decorations as well"}
{"text":"Based on the group rate vs the quality of the food received, I won't be recommending this place to friends very often.  Olive Garden, while a chain, has better quality food for the same price.  A plus that earned TOSF it's third star: the atmosphere is nice, it's knick knack but classy."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time to celebrate a friend's birthday. The decor is cool but borderline creepy and it looks like the place hasn't been cleaned in years. 

We came in a big group of 8 and I arrived early. They wouldn't let me and other people who were early sit down until everyone showed up which I thought was bizarre, so they made us stand up for a good 10 minutes when the place was obviously empty inside (it was a monday night). 

Anyway, the service was surprisingly good but the food was TERRIBLE. The only good thing about this place is the bread. 

I ordered a salad which was made up of 5 pieces of lettuce (at most) with obviously store-bought dressing slapped on top. I had the meatball pasta which was overcooked, had almost no sauce (even that was obviously store bought) and 3  meatballs that tasted like nasty fish. I was actually glad they only gave me 3. 

The ice cream was good (but then again how can anyone screw up ice cream). 

Everyone else around the table ordered different things and no one seemed to enjoy their food. Many complained about the lack of flavour. 

Honestly for $16 I would much rather eat somewhere else and get a decent meal. Avoid this place at all costs. Even if you think it's cheap, it's not worth it."}
{"text":"Not a bad place for a large group. Food was okay and service was good. Location and decor were awesome."}
{"text":"The reason for this one-star rating is the waiter service.   Our waitress completely got our order wrong, and didn't apologize.   She actually managed to miss bringing one person's meal at our table.

When it came around for desert, we didn't want ice cream.  We asked what else there was to choose from, and she suggested jello.  We made the assumption that jello would be an alternative to ice cream.

The bill arrives, and two surprises:  A) she charged extra to everyone for jello, and didn't inform us it was not a substitute (no one would have ordered that if known) and B) she actually charged us for the meal of the person who she never delivered to!

I asked for a manager right afterward, and the manager did not believe that her prized waitress could have delivered such atrocious service.   She reduced our bill by the desert costs and the missing meal - I really should have asked for more, but it was late and the manager convinced me the waitress was normally good."}
{"text":"Alexis knocked my socks off with her amazing service being an expert suit salesman customer service is very important and her attention to detail and positive attitude made my terrible day great definitely returning to this fine establishment to make more amazing memories and her water filling skill was exceptional can't wait to be back"}
{"text":"So I'm sitting in the trolly car at The Old Spaghetti Factory in Newport Beach, CA trying to figure out what to order. Then I noticed I've been to many of the locations listed on the menu. So it hit me, I need to type up a review for each location I've been to. But the truth is that they are all good. The food is yummy and I think the home made salad dressing us the best. I love the atmosphere and of corse the garlic bread. If you have not been to one of the many locations I highly recommend you give them a try. If your in vacation and want a fun family restaurant give them a call and bake a reservation because some times the wait is long."}
{"text":"This was my second visit in years, but first time to this location. I showed up fashionably late to attend a birthday party dinner, took a quick trip to the restrooms(liked the decor of the restaurant)and upon returning to the table was surprised to see no menus, nor drink orders taken, no plates for the bread, no servers around. When we finally got our orders in it felt as though we had to repeatedly ask for everything, especially drinks, and they completely forgot my daughter's drink. I'm not picky but if my glass is always empty the tip goes down, like father like daughter I suppose. I ordered the spaghetti Vesuvius, suppose to be spicy, it was barely above regular sauce. Although the sauce was chunky it was placed in a spoonful a top cold bland noodles,not enough sauce to cover it. I realize we were a big party but reservations were made. Food was bland, service was slow, will I return most definitely no."}
{"text":"If its spaghetti you want, they have it in many ways! They even have a gluten free option, which I defiantly am grateful for. I had the gf spirals with mushroom marinara. It was good though I had to ask for more sauce. I'm a saucy gal! Ha
The restaurant has a fun atmosphere including a street car in the middle which you can dine in. Cute idea especially for kids. It's a great place for large groups and parties. 
I will say the that the place could use a little cleaning up. I had to switch out my chair because it was stained and dirty. Eww. Other than than that, the waitress we had was very friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"I came here for a team lunch outing.  The staff there was excellent.  The server was accommodating and moved quickly.  That being said, I am only giving 2 starts because the food was meh.  You can get better pasta dishes for the same price somewhere else.  The atmosphere was also very dated."}
{"text":"We came here because our first choice had too long of a wait.  This was my first time here.  The service was just fine and the food was rather tasty.  But there was a faint odor of spoiled grease or sewage in the air when we walked in which threw off the experience.  We stayed because we were pretty hungry by this point and as I said, everything else was fine with our visit.  I'll probably try this place again if they fixed whatever that issue was."}
{"text":"I came here on a Sunday afternoon. My waiter was on point and did a great job. The food was good, but I can't say I really enjoy the decor. Overall I enjoyed my lunch and I would come back."}
{"text":"I will preface this review with stating this place is not my favorite restaurant to begin with. I've visited this location about 4-5 times hoping and praying I would have found something new or even something I remotely like.

We visited this location yesterday and there were 4 adults and 1 kid. Checking in was ok, however it took a tad longer than I would have expected for us to be seated. The place was not busy and multiple tables empty and staff standing around doing nothing. We were sat in the Trolley which in itself can offer its own natural experience, however, it did not make up for the horrible service and food. Our server was Andrew, he took our drink orders and left. When he returned with our drinks he did not bring creamer for the coffee. We had to ask 3 separate times for creamer. Another worker finally brought the creamer but the coffee was cold at this point. We asked for a new cup, which we were told after two more times asking for a fresh cup, a new pot is being made. Finally, the fresh cup arrived after our meal was over. What kind of service is this?

In addition to this, we had to ask for refills on other drinks and more bread. These requests were always asked with Please and Thank you, but we had to remind Andrew multiple times. I'm not sure how this place is still surviving with this mediocre service and food. Its unfortunate management has done nothing to address these concerns. Read the reviews its a common trend.

The food is flavorless!  Olive Garden is way better than this place. Maybe its the older cliental that keeps this place in business. Their sense of taste must have left them! Save your money, time and patience's and find a new place to eat. Trust me there are better options available in this great city. 

And to the group of management staff standing near the exit doing nothing, maybe you should be going around to the tables and ensuring the guests are having a great experience and seek their feedback. IMPROVE the business!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend found this place on Yelp and after reading the mediocre reviews, we decided to check and see for ourselves what the Old Spaghetti Factory has to offer. We made our way from the Distillery District, which was about 15 minutes walk away.

As we entered we were seated almost instantly. As we walked to our seats, i thought the look and feel of the restaurant was quite odd, but unique. We ended up being seating in what seemed to look like a merry go round.

The waitress was pretty quick in making us feel welcome and politely asked for drinks. We both got water, but they offer pop, coffee, tea, and alcoholic beverages as well. We were both pretty hungry. 
I ended up ordering Caesar salad and the good 'ol spaghetti and meat balls, while she ordered Caesar salad and some Italian sausage spaghetti. The Caesar salad wasn't good, there was too much sauce and powdered cheese. I also thought both spaghetti meals were alright, but i wasn't amazed with the meatballs - they seemed very plain and dry. I ended up soaking the meatballs in as much spaghetti sauce as possible. The Italian sausage was actually tasty, but at the same time, its hard to mess up sausages.

All in all, the food was average, and the service was great. If you have never been to the Old Spaghetti Factory before, i recommend trying it for yourself to see how you like it. I would definitely choose Scaddabush over this place when it comes to Spaghetti, and all other types of Italian food."}
{"text":"Been here several times. Love the food, garlic miztheria is my go to. The bread and salad are amazing too. My daughter's favorite place to eat. Not a close drive, but worth it. Can hop on the light rail for a game too."}
{"text":"We had battered shrimp for appetizer, and chicken alfredo and baby back ribs with spaghetti for main course.

their battered shrimp was very crispy and blend well with the sauce provided. it's the best dish that we had of the night.

the chicken alfredo was good, though it doesn't mindblowing. baby back ribs was too dry and didn't mix well with spaghetti that accompany it. the spaghetti was very tasty though it shouldn't have been used as side to baby back ribs.

the service was very nice and we got to wait in their bar area until a table in dining area opens. the setting was very classic that lived up to its name."}
{"text":"Spent a few hours here with my son and some family as his last dinner before shipping out for basic training. Wait staff was great, food was good and price was reasonable"}
{"text":"I love this place. 
I love that it's rich with history (for Arizona) and the fact it was two houses, connected. 
The interior is beautiful, and wooden. There's a Trolly in the middle, which is always a treat to be able to sit in. 

The service is usually stellar, in fact, the last young lady (I feel awful for forgetting her name) not only joked along with us, but we danced the Charleston together! 

I've been coming to this place since I was a child, and I was devastated to find out it's a chain. But this particular location earns it's credibility back with the great history, and the consistent food and service. 

Anywhere I go, I hold the Mizithra standard to This location. I always eat too much, and never regret it. 

It's always nice to know there is a scoop of ice cream for desert after, especially when connecting with old friends, and wanting time to leisurely chat over desert. 

I will continue to visit, and enjoy myself at the Old Spaghetti Factory. 

(Side note: I recently went on a Haunted Bus tour of Phoenix, and apparently this location is Haunted by the ghost of a child, who like to poke people in the behind! I have never experienced it, but watch your fanny! haha)"}
{"text":"The Old Spaghetti Factory is one of my fave place to eat and celebrate special occasions. I like the eclectic decorations and wood furniture ambiance of the restaurant. The meal portions are large enough for two. I often order the spaghetti with meat balls or with white clam sauce. There is always room for spumoni!"}
{"text":"We were here 2wks ago and we were so excited about because it was our first mystery dinner. We didn't quite know what to expect. The actors were very entertaining and funny . Especially the maid she was hilarious! And made the whole show! 
 Your seated with a group of people who you will together try to figure out the mystery. Which was fun. 
 The dinner was your choice  3 entrees to pick from. Basic simple salad was served first. I picked a meatball chicken sausage and pasta entree.  Which was small amounts of sausage and soggy pasta. It was not what I expected. 
  It was not something we would do again."}
{"text":"We were a large group for work and I have no idea who chose this place.

You dread coming here just by looking at the name, Chuck E Cheese comes to mind.

Everyone was let down, I tried my best to steer clear of the pasta and my rack of ribs still came with a dollop of pasta.


Yes, I had pasta with ribs!!!


The prices were not even that great, but they throw a bunch of warm bread (really the only decent thing), as well as soup (watery) and salad (iceberg from a bag) ,

You could spend about $10-20 here, which is the only saving grace.

Service was ok, I knew our large group would be overwhelming to most wait staff"}
{"text":"So totally stopped here because we were reading it was haunted. There's a ton of stories online. So it was fun, the food was good, the cream sodas were the best. The service can definitely use improvement. 
This is the reason I gave it a 3 stars instead of 4. The decor is vintage which will appeal to a ton of different blends. I like vintage because I was born in the wrong century. Any who, come to this place if you don't mind below average and not so friendly waiters. (At least ours was lacking) also the ice cream at the end of your meal is a plus. Don't ask questions about the ghosts, the waiters will literally run. So I didn't see a ghost."}
{"text":"The place was slow for easter. . It took them 10 minutes to seat us when the restaurant  was about 30 % filled.  The prices are reasonable.  Food was decent . I liked my garlic shrimp. However there were so small. Portions were small . . Their were homeless persons walking out side."}
{"text":"Horrible Service. Food was sub par. Not as good as an Olive Garden. Expected a more authentic taste. The decor was the only positive. Again, horrible SERVICE! I do not recommend."}
{"text":"Have been going to the OSF since the early 90's...I think I have had almost every dish on the menu...Very consistanly good; the pasta is done al-dente just like my roommate prefers.  Love the new spaghetti squash side dish!!!
YUM, YUM, YUM..."}
{"text":"When you eat there, you got to think of two things: 

1. Do I want to eat at a historical Victorian house that breaths rustic history?
2. Do I want good memorial Italian food? 

1. The place is awesome, very big and large, filled with low lighting (Keep this in mind) and a lot of historic decor. Wooden floors that creak and crack, and memorabilia on the walls. Sadly, this doesn't really do justice since the food was plain 'Meh'

2. I had better food. In fact, the Olive Garden serves better food then this place. The Chicken was warm inside out and the meat sauce tastes a bit sour, like it was getting bad. My SO had the meat balls, but the low lighting made it hard to tell if it was cooked our not. After opening one of the meat balls, it was a bit red. A Manager came and told us, this is how it is due to how the meatballs was cooked. 

Like my 2 star rating indicates, I've experience better food. If it wasn't for the decor, I would give his a 1 star, but the feeling of eating in a old house feels great. It's just too bad we had to eat this kind of food here. 

As for the service, it was okay, not too bad or too good."}
{"text":"Poor service on a Monday afternoon at 1pm. Waited for 20 minutes to put in drink and food order. No refills unless her manager. When I went to ask for help, the manager rolled her eyes and rudely helped. Awful!!!! I won't be going back!!!!"}
{"text":"There was a 40 minute  wait. We ordered immediately  . The lettuce  was wilty.they  lost our order.after 30 minutes.  But did get our order fairly quickly . The noodles were undercooked. And portion was small"}
{"text":"The Old Spaghetti Factory serves its purpose. 

The Old Spaghetti Factory is great if your dining experience is to fill one of these criteria: 
- children/teen friendly 
- large group of people that like \"basic\" food 
- bang for your buck 
- you want to hang out with tourists 

If you are looking for a great Italian dining experience, do not go here. The Old Spaghetti Factory will not make you think of your Italian grandmother or even your quarter-twice removed-does a great Godfather routine-Italian grandmother. 

Last night I took some of my family and my 3 year old God Daughter here. She loved it. Lots to see, crayons and paper at the table, people singing happy birthday, loud music and they had her requested \"meat balls with pasta\". 

When you order anything off the menu it comes with a choice of soup or salad to start, pop, your entree, ice cream and coffee/tea. All for about $15. Was the food great - no. But, I had no expectations, and was going here solely for my God Daughter. She loved it, they had what she wanted, there was something everyone could eat, again - served its purpose. 

Of note, they do have some half decent girly drinks/cocktails that if you order the larger version - you get to keep the glass. This place is quite large, so if you have a group of people with bland taste buds, this may be a good option. 

Bonus points for the music. It was a 90's revival. I sang and seat danced to James \"Laid\""}
{"text":"It is what it is. A family portions and very casual place. The food here is pretty good. And service is always wonderful. Walking through the kitchen before u get seated is a different touch but seems a little gross to me."}
{"text":"For a place that primarily serves spaghetti and is called \"Spaghetti Factory\" you'd think they'd take the time to actually make the pasta. Nope. Store bought. The \"spicy\" meat sauce was very watery and not spicy at all. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Horrible experience!!! We went here a couple of weeks ago, around 830 pm, and they made us wait to be seated when it was not even busy, ok, fine, after a 10 minute wait, the host sits us at a table that was not assigned to any wait staff at all!! We ended up leaving, but before leaving, we spoke with the same host, and we were told a very blah \"ok\", he honestly seemed to not care. I called the manager, who confirmed we were sat at a table that was not assigned to anyone, and we were invited back to enjoy dinner on them, nice gesture, but when we returned the next week, the waiter we did get, was another blah person who did not seem to care. I was given 2 cracked straws, and to his reply, \"oh the come from the manufacture that way\" no apology, and the food was just ok. With the many dining options out there, I will not be returning to this high school run restaurant."}
{"text":"I go here at least once every two years whether I want too or not. It usually is not, but I go. 

Today was one of those days.

We arrived probably around 1:20 p.m. and the lunch rush was over; if it had one.

The young lady took the name and said it will be about ten minutes, ok no big deal. This gave me time to look around again for the first time. The building and the décor is tired and uninviting. It could be really nice if it tried.

Ok so this is not fine dining I know that, I accept this.

Our server was Cory; he did a fine job with a very pleasant attitude. 

I ordered what was recommended to me by two folks; the Mizithra Cheese and Brown Butter. It is said to be a toothsome treat for cheese lovers. What in Gods name does that mean I have no idea? Nor do I know why a cheese lover would love this dish. I also ordered a salad and cup of soup. Clam chowder was the soup and salty was its name. I beg, please do not give me a wet salad, dry the veggies first and then serve them. As for the toothsome treat it self, well no. Bruce looked over and said; man that looks dry is it missing something? I would not know since I have never had it before, but I do know if this is a favourite dish of anyone they have very low standards in food.

I like good food; I want good food even in a middle of the road place like this. Find inspiration and pass it along to your patrons. I mean if I am going to remain fat I want it to mean something....."}
{"text":"This place sucks overpriced not worth it at all.  I ordered the shrimp alfredo which originally doesn't come with artichokes so I told the waiter to add artichokes and he says yeah yeah I can do that the only problem is oh yeah he didn't! We then asked the manager to come over and he tells us that he didn't want to open another can of artichokes just for my meal he was too much of a cheap skate. 

Also I ordered a Long Island and the lady looked at me like I was from Mars and the manager says oh she was the hostess she doesn't know about drinks cuz she's underage nice defense doesn't make any sense it's common knowledge.  So then I finally get my Long Island after waiting 35 minutes and they bring me a Blackberry flavor Long Island like I'm a little kid or something I wanted a regular Long Island. I didn't want to wait another 35 minutes so I just drank it tasted like a virgin Long Island with crappy BlackBerry flavor 

Overall horrible experience would not recommend to anybody over price food Olive Garden would have been better"}
{"text":"Great food.  Great service.  Great location.  Very busy, but they still bust it out quickly and exude excellence."}
{"text":"Recently went here again after so many years and honestly this restaurant is so wonderful. It's like a hidden gem. The food is excellent! The service was phenomenal! Wish I could have dinner in the trolley!! I just think this is so unique! When I was waiting for my date in the lobby I was sitting in this chair that made me feel like a queen, very fancy! Also, in the back of the lobby is my all time favorite- the spaghetti tree! I always wanted one of those growing up!"}
{"text":"The feast combo is really a good deal. The vibe was very good too. Nice place for friends hanging out."}
{"text":"I don't know why I like this place!  The food is average- not craveable. The service is consistently bad. I'm sorry, but I have encountered so many clueless employees at this place that are too pathetic to even complain about. 

That aside, I like the way this place feels. It's fun to take my younger family members from out of town.  What kid wouldn't want to eat lunch in an old-time train car? Plus, ice cream is free with a dinner- can't beat that! Don't expect your waiter to be a wine expert- or even know what a mimosa is during Sunday brunch- but, it is a cute little place with lots of fun memorabilia.  Like I said, the food is not going to knock your socks off, but it's not that bad- just forgettable.  Stick to the basics that are hard to mess up, like lasagna, and enjoy that free ice cream (I suggest the spumoni)."}
{"text":"Old Spaghetti Factory: the place where fat suburbanites bring their fat children to eat fatty, salty and bland pasta.  The parking lot is a Camry convention and the clientèle is as white as the bread that they serve with your meals.

On the plus side, kids love the trolley and they get to ring the bell when they finish eating.  Always good motivation."}
{"text":"We went here last night before the Raps game, and although service was excellent, the food unfortunately was not. We were greeted and seated quickly with bread delivered promptly. As we pulled in our chairs, I noticed the menu. It was quite pricy considering what it was. Our server was friendly and attentive, however our water was never refilled. I ordered the spaghetti and clam sauce, which was a disappointment. The pasta was drenched in heavy Alfredo sauce, and there was very little clams, I counted 5 small pieces. The bread was undercooked, and overly doughy. The minestrone soup was ok, however quite salty and had not enough vegetables. Unfortunately, I enjoyed the spumoni ice cream more then the meal. The meal was fat, starch and a bit of sodium. I was expecting much more for the price.

Pros:
Excellent Service 4.5/5
Nice decor 5/5
Unlimited bread, free ice cream and side

Cons:
Low quality food
Lots of small kids, so kinda noisy
Not the healthiest
Pricy (for what it is)

Verdict: TOSF is great for families looking for large portions, but a low quality of food diminishes the nice decor and service.

Food 2.5/5
Service 4.5/5
Atmosphere 4/5
Speed 4/5
Price 3/5

Average: 3.6, although I weight food and service over the others."}
{"text":"This is my first time eating at this restaurant. I would not have suspected it to be a chain. This place has a good vibe and is decorated nicely inside. There is even a trolley in the middle where you can be seated at a table to eat.

The food was amazing. I usually can't finish a full meal in one sitting but it was so good I somehow found room to eat every last bite as well as share a dessert. I got the baked chicken which had good seasoning, but was a little dry. The dish came with a side of pasta and I got the spaghetti with mizithra cheese and browned butter. It was amazing!The dinner comes with free ice cream or sorbet but I opted to pay extra to get the mud pie. I have no regrets in doing that! The dessert was delicious.

The waitress was very attentive and sweet. We did wait a little longer than usual to order drinks but once she got to our table the service wasn't slow. Her sweet personality made up for the initial wait."}
{"text":"This place is a Phoenix original! Although  it used to be called The Spaghetti Company, things change. But, it is basically the same.
Because, the owner got divorced he lost this location to his wife, who had it join the Chain of Spaghetti Factory.
At first with all the changes, it suffered and was not as good as the Company was. 
But, they have ironed it out a bit and now it is better.

The food is good. Not authentic Italian, but for the price it is a fantastic deal.
Nothing to complain about at all.  You get a lot of food for a very low price.
It is decorated really great. Very old fashioned Victorian style.
Servers are friendly and do the best they can, because this place is always packed full.

You get soup or salad, bread and butter, a meal , and dessert. All for less than $10.00.
The menu has a lot to choose from as well.
It is a great place to take children, because the whole family can go out and it does not break the bank. 
Bathrooms are clean, and lots of parking, additional in the back."}
{"text":"I'll begin by saying the service was the best ever. We had 32 people in our party, they assigned one girl to us. She was amazing, she kept up best she could on drinks, breads etc, not due to her some of the food was cold, she deserves a huge pat on the back for being amazing. The food was not good Italian food, the manager who made it clear that he would not be helping her do anything but make sure the food came out on time. They did good but the quality of food wasn't good. The salad was fresh out of the bag, not good. We had reservations so they should have assigned more people to help The service from Amber on her birthday was fantastic. We sang to her, made her understand as doing it all solo she was amazing. I'd go back but only to sit in her section. 3 stars was for the food.... 5 stars for service all the way!!! Thank you again Amber!!!."}
{"text":"I've heard about this place enough times for it to be a tourist attraction - and, well, it essentially is. The interior is super lively, filled to the brim with interesting decor and the overall restaurant just exudes a fun and comfortable atmosphere. 

The food however is very mediocre, although the prices are fair. I had the spaghetti and meat sauce from the lunch menu so my bill came up just under $10 after tax and tips. There was nothing special about the dish itself and it resembled a lot like a homemade meal - not something on par with the quality that you would normally consider \"restaurant food\". I did appreciate the unlimited dinner roll breads + freshly grated cheese though, and the waiter that served us was great. The best part of the meal was the spumoni ice cream which cost $1.99 as a side order. It's basically neapolitan ice cream except the three flavours are vanilla, chocolate, and pistachio. It was delicious! 

I feel that most people come here for the experience and I have no regrets for having tried it, but it's unlikely that I'd come back again. I wouldn't be inclined to recommend this place unless someone specifically told me they wanted this type of environment."}
{"text":"We went here for my wife's birthday party and we had a group of 15.  We came on a Friday night @ 6 p.m.  The restaurant is large and can seat many people.  We were seated promptly.  We had 1 waiter for the group of 15 and I'll say he did a fair job.  He made sure our drinks were always topped off.  The minor problem I saw was the empties weren't being picked up so with 15 people, the glasses were piling up quick.  I won't fault him too much for that as we were a big group.  When our salads and bread came and we were finished, that's when we noticed the table was full of dirty dishes and here our food came.  Where do you put your dinner?  I wish the floor manager that night kept an eye on our large group because asking 1 person to do all of that work is a chore and a half and I understand that.

The food was good.  I ordered the #3 Meat Lover's Treat which came with 2 Sicilian meatballs, an Italian sausage and spaghetti with meat sauce.  The sausages and meatballs were really good and outshined the dish.  I would order it again.  As part of the dinner you get a dish of Spumoni which I had with our birthday cake we brought and the Spumoni was really good.

I'm not a big pasta fan so I would come back here and eat again, no problem.  Why I give the restaurant 3 stars is the location.  It's attached to the Chandler Mall and the parking is ridiculous.  After \"sharking\" the lot for 10 minutes we decided to valet park and that was $7 extra.  It's because of the parking problem I would choose to go elsewhere for my pasta fix where it is more convenient."}
{"text":"We like to hit up this place every once and awhile if we're in the area for an event.  We like it because it's always consistent and we know what we'll get.

Bluntly, the Old Spaghetti Factory is definitely a casual, niche market restaurant.  They cater to large groups and families, while also serving couples such as ourselves.  I would by no means classify their food as amazing Italian but it is tasty and contrary to some reviews on here, extremely good value.

Most of the their meals come with bread, salad, ice cream and coffee/tea - which for $15-$17 is a good price.  The best value on the menu in my opinion is the Managers Favorite, which allows you to combine two sauces in one dish.

Overall, if you have a family - this is probably one of the best places to go in downtown Toronto.  The kids will love the interior and it's very child friendly.  If you are looking for romance - maybe not.  But as a couple, we do enjoy coming here from time to time, especially if we are hungry.  And the service is always good.

Be prepared to wait sometimes - it can be very busy here or fairly quiet, which means not all the tables are open."}
{"text":"Went for the first time and loved it! Generous portions, great service, and wonderful lasagna. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"After reading all the reviews about the poor service we were hesitant about eating at The Old Spaghetti Factory. We were seated in less than 5 minutes around noon on a busy Sunday.  Our waitress visited our table immediately and was attentive during the entire meal. My food was above average and my wife said her meal was excellent. We will both return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"First time ever at this location. Nicely decorated all remake stuff of the old time stuff.
Clean restaraunt, including the bathrooms.
We came really early for dinner. We were running errands and wanted to eat early and get home.

They were serving all day,which is a major plus. The hostess gave us lunch menus along with our dinner menu. However, lunch had been over for 25 min.
Anyway, our waiter was nice. He bought our drinks and bread quickly.
The food is very cheap (price wise) . So for the $$ you cannot complain.
But, it really has no flavor, it is very plain.
We both chose the soup. Which was really good, Minestrone.
Food was good , just not a lot of flavor.
Of course it is an Italian place owned by Greeks so they will have things a little differant.
After we got our food we sat for a very long time with no drink. Our waiter seemed to of disappered for 20 min. Maybe they have things to do in the back before their shift ends. but, the hostess walked by us several times. I think she should of asked us if we wanted refills.
Not a bad place, just not a great place. It served the purpose of a quick , fairly good dinner. They are doing something right, they have been around for years."}
{"text":"The more things change, the more they stay the same!

First started going to OSF (Or was it Spag. Co??) on Mill Ave as a teenager.
Dad and Mom had just split (temporarily) and Dad didn't have a lot of money.
He'd take me here on payday, and it became a bit of a tradition for us.
Back then, it was a place where we could have a \"real\" sit down dinner with soup or salad, entree, fresh bread and garlic butter, drink and dessert for CHEAP!

These days, it's a place where you can have a \"real\" sit down dinner with soup or salad, entree, fresh bread and garlic butter, drink and dessert for CHEAP!

Love the historic building.  Love the furniture, decor, antiques and mock-antiques.  (Granted, I didn't know any of them were mock until I met the man who does most of the stained glass that I *thought* was vintage.)

Even though there's a huge capacity, it's split up to feel much more intimate.

Is any of the food amazing?  No, but it's not trying to be.  This is good, old-fashioned Italian-American comfort food.  Sure, there's a couple updates (pesto ranch dressing, gluten free pasta) - but for the most part, it's the same menu you'd see in an Italian restaurant anywhere in America in the 1950's and 60's.  No risks taken on the menu - all very safe, middle of the road fare.

But sometimes - that's *exactly* what I want!  Service is always friendly, food is always fresh, I've never left hungy.  Oh, and it's CHEAP!"}
{"text":"The last time I went to an Old Spaghetti Factory was in California, ages ago.  It was awesome then.  Now?  It sucks.  We arrived around 5.  No crowd.  At the podium were 4 young women who looked like petulant teenagers, pissed to have to be at work.  The stared us down until we were in front of them.  Nary a smile to be seen.  The one in front of the screen looked at us and said, \"Two?\".  We said, \"Yes.\"  She said so and so will take you to your table.  So and so fumbled the menus, recovered, drummed up a sort of smile and got us seated.  Waiter comes.  Gets drinks for us.  Never were refilled by the way.  We ordered the meat lovers.  It was awful.  The sauce was, at best, insipid, devoid of any flavor.  The meatballs were so greasy I nearly gagged (we paleo except on Friday cheat night) so you can imagine.  God knows what was in that sausage, but one bite warned me away.  I hope my dogs don't get sick.  The blurb they have about their fresh, homemade food?  Check out the picture of their \"fresh, crisp, greens salad\".  Bag salad.  I am not stupid.  I recognize it when I see it.  The Spumoni was also lackluster.  Oh...wait.  The bread was good and warm.  The Sicilian bread appetizer (cheese bread) was not.  The service was poor.  It was as though these peeps have not been trained to put plates on a table.  We were in one of those cubicles with the table at the center.  Plenty of room to get around.  My salad got delivered to the upper quarter of the paper placemat.  The entree, sideways, to the upper left quadrant, both with the server reaching across the table.  Sheez.  Waste of a good cheat night.  Not doing that again.  Just realized the photo of the salad is on my phone.  Will see if I can attach after I post this."}
{"text":"The food was okay, nothing special. But I do think this place is worth coming to as a tourist attraction. The inside is really big and beautifully decorated with pictures, stain glass, carousel, telephone booth, a bus, etc. It's very vintage/antique feeling. The waitress was kind and the food is pretty inexpensive. I would come here again."}
{"text":"Decor is beautiful! This place has so much character. Food even taste better than so of their other locations. Service is good and prices are the cherry on top. We ordered 3 pasta dishes with salad, bread and ice cream for 40 dollars. Now that's great deal! The brown butter and mizthra cheese is staple here. Topeka was our server and she did great job. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Totally fine for what it is. I go here a couple of times a year with a group of about 18-20 people, to carbo-load before long races (marathons, etc.) We are the WORST restaurant guests ever, making a massive reservation, showing up over the course of 45 minutes or more, ordering all sorts of things on the side, and all wanting separate cheques. It's terrible, really.

But they NEVER complain, they are always unfailingly friendly and accommodating, and never make mistakes. The auto-grat, but they friggin' deserve it. They are SO nice to us when we totally don't deserve it.

Tonight there was actually a monster truck rally somewhere nearby (lol) so the line was out the door and down the street by 4:45, but they manage it calmly with 5-6 hostesses.

The food is fine. Actually, the brown buttered pasta with mizithra cheese is really good. Lots of beers on tap. All in all, totally reliable option."}
{"text":"Awful food and apathetic waitress. I find it unacceptable when the entire table leaves more than 50% of their food on the table because it is so bad and all the waitress says is dessert? No? Just the check then? Careless and rude. Garlic bread was ok."}
{"text":"Wow! Thanks to the entire experience we had. We needed a place to host a party of 40 in 24 hours. Individual checks were OK. They pulled it off with great food, service, and the awesome ambience for The Factory! Cheers"}
{"text":"I come here about 4 or 5 times a year. It's consistently good. There is ample seating, so I've never waited long. It's off Central, so the parking is horrid. Their lot holds a good number, but it can be tricky to get in and out when crowded - I don't drive my van here.
  I am always pleased with the food. I find the salads ok - I really like their Balsalmic Vinigarette dressing - I'll mop the leftover with bread.
 I typically get spaghetti with meat sauce and sausage. The sauce has a good flavor.
 The Brown Butter with Mizithra Cheese is incredible - but very rich.
  The staff is always courteous, and I rarely have to wait for anything."}
{"text":"Damn, these portions are huge. The garlic bread is to die for, and the pasta is just the right amount of filling. The food isn't the best quality, but it's got quantity and it is satisfying. That's all one could really ask for as far as I'm concerned."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here a few times since it opened. We're happy we don't have to go downtown anymore!

Yesterday we stopped by for lunch with my sister. It was a normal visit, quite slow since \"lunch\" happened around 2:30/3:00 for us. Service was great, food was good and it's always nice to see you're paying $×× to get a starter, meal, dessert and tea/coffee!

I can be kind of picky about my food but the staff are always accommodating. I want penne instead of linguine? Done. I want more vegetables? Done. I want this meal but with that sauce? Done! And always with a smile. Looking forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"I give one star because the chairs look big and comfy but I will never go back to find out.

Plain and simple...my boyfriend and I walked in and stood there while 3 employees stared at us and did NOTHING. It was a monday evening, we saw open tables, and not one of the 3 employees acknowledged us so we left."}
{"text":"So we love OSF and have visited the downtown location many times. This location fell short of our expectations, I would not recommend you eat here and I will not repeat. 

If you want more details read on: 

Julie said that 1. It was my turn to change the diaper and 2. A family restaurant like OSF would most definitely have baby changing tables in the men's room. Well, if those exist they hide them well, I will mention that both the stalls were busy so I was not able to look in there for a changing table so I had to change him on the sink which was less than pleasant. 

Next, we sat about 40-60 feet away from the front door in large, red Alice in Wonderland type chairs. Although charming and comfortable, these chairs are little to tall for a short guy like me and my legs would not touch the floor! I had to do the slide-down-the-chair-to-touch-the-floor-so-I-feel-like-a-big-boy routine. 

Then I noticed that the first set of double doors from the outside were propped open so every time someone opened the inside set of double doors to walk in or out, a huge breeze of 39 degree F air would come rushing in and give us a great \"Arctic\" atmosphere. This bothered me enough to call Sean, our waiter, over. I explained the issue and he quickly went over to the hostess station where four girls with the apparent combined IQ of 50 argued with him for a few minutes and it seems that Sean lost the argument because the doors remained propped opened until about an hour later when a customer must have accidentally kicked the prop and made the outside doors close on his way out. Who is the genius that decided to prop them open in the first place with the kind of weather we were having? 

I ordered a Chicken Penne and Sean said that it came with a salad. The \"salad\" was just a bunch of lettuce in a puny bowl with some dressing. It left me wondering why we didn't just go to Olive Garden to get a real salad. 

Then came the bread. It tasted good but it was hard, cold and difficult to cut. Even little Ryan at 2.5 years old gave me a weird look when he tried biting into the bread. 

The bread came served in a puny cutting board which the more we cut the bread the more crumbs and hard crust went every were on the table and made a huge mess. I would recommend you bring some safety glasses and a cordless sawzall for this operation. I was not impressed. Why not send the bread pre-cut or in a plate more suited for this purpose? Hey how about sending FRESH bread out? 

The food came fast so I got my Chicken Penne and it was just OK, very unremarkable. Again, it left me wondering why we did not just drive a bit further and eat the Pene Rustica at Macaroni Grill which is a dish that deserves a standing ovation. 

The beer was tasty and the rest of the meal was enjoyable now that I was wearing my jacket fully zipped up and was starting to contemplate wearing my gloves also for good measure. 

IQ 50 girls were still giggling by the hostess station. 

Then I overheard three employees talking a few feet away from us by the terminal. They were discussing restaurant drama, something about \"he almost got me fired but I apologized to the customer and still got a good tip\" 

Now, let me tell you that besides being a patron, my extent of having any restaurant management experience involves working at Pizza Hut for two months as a waiter during summer break in college but even I know that discussing drama within earshot of customers is unprofessional and should be taken outside or in the kitchen. I began fantasizing about being \"manager for a day\" as I already had a list of the top ten things that this restaurant needed to address if it planned on staying in business. 

At this point in the meal I was looking around to see if I could determine who the Manger is and maybe call him or her over. 

Could it be the girl that was dressed in white, different from the other employees dressed in black? No, she was hanging out with IQ 50 girls for a long time, probably not. 

Julie also made an observation that they appeared to be waaayyy overstaffed. Julie worked in a restaurant as a lead where dollars sold per labor hour were the important to keep high for their bonuses. This was apparently not the focus here as there were loads of employees standing around and circulating the restaurant aimlessly carrying nothing and doing nothing. 

The positives: 

Sean was a great waiter, professional, courteous, prompt and was there just in the nick of time when needed. Sean is probably the greatest asset this company has going for it. 

For his sake, I hope Macaroni Grill is hiring as I think this restaurant is going under within the year. 

The building is nice, kept relatively clean and the music and ambiance is pleasant (besides the Arctic issue) 

But again I will not repeat."}
{"text":"I have been a few times but and have always had the same experience, good service, and the food was edible. Our last visit I tired This drink called pirates punch, it has Captain Morgan and I believe pineapple juice. It was too scrumptious and can be dangerous after a few. **DRINKER BEWARE** 
The environment is cool, very 50's furnishings, there is a sleigh in one of the front windows.........not sure what the meaning is behind that. Also you have to check out the Pasta Farming Paraphernalia 
Parking can be a little hectic as well"}
{"text":"Not \"homemade\" tasting but not bad either.  Service was fast and friendly and the food came out quickly.  Anyone remember that \"fast food Italian\" restaurant chain Fazolie's? It sorta reminded me of that place but with a nicer dining area. 

I had the pot poutti, it's a sampler so I got to try the Mizirtha cheese and brown butter sauce, the meat sauce, the clam sauce, and the marinara sauce.  All of the sauces tasted pretty good (especially the meat sauce). The pasta wasn't over cooked either so the food is fairly solid.  Head and shoulders above Olive Garden.  The thing that ruined the experience was that everyones entrée came out lukewarm.  I hate that (that alone takes them from a generous 4 star to a solid 3 star)."}
{"text":"It's been about four years since we've been here.  We were nervous when they updated the look on the outside that they also remodeled in the inside, because it had such a cool vibe as it was.  Thankfully, they inside remains the same.  

We went to eat to celebrate our friends birthday.  The wait was approx. 30 minutes but with so many cool things to see in the waiting area, time went by quickly.  Our waiter was friendly and kept the drinks coming.  He also made some good recommendations.  We ordered the garlic shrimp alfredo and it was amazingly delicious.  Kids enjoyed their alfredo.  I love that you get bread, a salad, the entree, and a dessert all for a reasonable price.  I believe it was $15 for the garlic shrimp.  Not bad.  And the Shirley Temples are free refills.

Overall, great experience and good food.  Will go back time and time again!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a Saturday night. I got the Strawberry peach margarita. It was pretty good but just a little too sweet for me. The complementary bread was warm but over toasted on the outside and hard to slice with the provided knife. The bread was soft on the inside but still pretty good. I ordered the spinach and cheese ravioli with marinara sauce. The ravioli was alright but nothing super awesome. The marinara sauce was actually very tasty and zesty, which I like. My husband ordered the Italian sausage with spaghetti. He really liked but it only came with 1 medium sized sausage link. His meal came with a bowl of Minestrone soup which was delicious and hearty. We both got the ice cream which was included with our entries. We paid around $37 for a beer, margarita, and the 2 dinners."}
{"text":"I went to OSF yesterday right at 12pm. Service was prompt and polite but my food was complete crap. I ordered a garlic shrimp capellini, there was no seasoning what so ever! I'm not much of a salt person but I really had to salt and pepper my pasta. The shrimp wasn't seasoned either, just the blandest pasta I've ever had. For an appetizer I had cheese ravioli, most of them were pretty burnt. I had a basic salad come with my entree too. All the lettuce seemed like it was a few days old and yeah that was it, just wilted romaine lettuce and a couple croutons in ranch. Although their free sourdough bread was warm and tasted fine. I'm just disappointed I paid $15 for the pasta and $7 for the burnt appetizer that had no taste."}
{"text":"My oldest wanted to go to the old spaghetti factory out of nostalgia.  We used to go regularly in Winnipeg at the forks so she had wonderful memories to draw from.  I would have given more stars but our server did not replenish the bread...not even once and  my kids were enjoying it. On the flip side...the food was nice, service was friendly and the atmoshere was as eclectic and magical as our home town Winnipeg 's Old Spaghetti Factory.!!"}
{"text":"Spaghetti  factory has been around since as long as I can remember! I do love the historic antique ambience this place has to it (this has always been a reason to come here) 

This place is normally busy do give yourself time if you have a big party! Ok on with the food! The fresh warm mini loaf bread is a great way to start! Yum! Garlic butter is a bonus! I had the Chicken parm, which is served with a soup or salad and an ice cream desert. The salad was meh  (small) but the ranch dressing I had was extremely tasty! Ok main dish, the pasta sauce tasted alright but nothing special about it! The chicken parm was tender and tasty but like many I've had latley, on the smaller portion size. As for desert, ice cream is ice cream! No thrills attached once so ever to this!

I'll be back in do time to try something different I suppose."}
{"text":"Ok this place was soo fantastic. I ordered the appetizer Sicilian garlic cheese bread. It had the perfect amount of cheese and garlic. The bread wasn't hard either just right. For my main entree I went with chicken broccoli fettuccine Alfredo. I definitely made the right choice. It tasted delicious! To top it off they include dessert with dinner. :)"}
{"text":"The food was good; I had the Mizithra cheese and browned butter pasta, the hubs had the triple meat platter. The waiter was nice enough, but not very attentive. We requested club soda with lime and it took a long time for him to bring it. We had to request refills at which time I asked for extra napkins. Another waiter brought the drinks and the extra napkins never came. It wasn't that busy for a Friday night, in fact they had several empty tables so I'm not sure what the issue was with the waiter. I'm guessing he just needs a little more training."}
{"text":"The food was amazing, the atmosphere was great, And our server Blake was the best server I've ever had he made the experience even better."}
{"text":"It's ok. The servers and manager like to stand around the tv a lot.  Meh. They have Donkey Kong in the waiting area, that's pretty sweet!"}
{"text":"Haven't been in years and was excited but other than the warm bread, not happy with our meals. I had factory ravioli ( which was supposedly homemade) but it was clearly not and very very salty. I couldn't finish it. I told the server and instead of offering something else she just said \"no one ever says that about the ravioli\" and walked away.  Daughters meal not much better. I was sad because I wanted excited to go back to my childhood memory of one torontos oldest restaurants. I guess this was the last time. Atmosphere is pretty cool- that's a plus."}
{"text":"The food here is great!!! Always have good service.  It can get crowded on the weekends, but that's to be expected."}
{"text":"Within less than ten minutes, our entrées arrived!  I ordered a Spaghetti Classic, the Spaghetti with White Clam Sauce.  The spaghetti was covered in a light garlic and basil cream sauce with baby clams scattered throughout the dish.  The light garlic and basil cream sauce was really good and the baby clams were rather plentiful and they didn't taste rough or chewy at all.  When it comes to spaghetti though, you need to eat it relatively fast otherwise once the cream sauce settles and gets cold, you have a big lump of pasta all stuck together.  I enjoyed this simple spaghetti dish."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in the food and service here.  I don't understand when you have a large party with one server who really wasn't very good. They should have had two servers for our group. That being said the food was very bland and my spaghetti was all sauce and very little pasta. Where did they hide the spices??  No where near real Italian food as it tasted like it came out of a can or jar. No bread was served to anyone despite it being on the menu.  Salad was simple and plain. That was about the only thing I enjoyed. I probably would not go back there again."}
{"text":"If you are a fan, I'm sorry. 
I used to be a fan too, the restaurant is full of fun decorations and it seems like an endless playground the further in you go. From carousel, medieval lamps, stain glass windows, it could almost double as a museum! And the menu consist of 3 course in one price: Spaghetti (of course) salad, free bread, tea, coffee, ice cream.
But those days of gluttony for me is over, when you realize you can't enjoy the abundance of food because you only have so much room for canned meat in the 'meat sauce pasta'.

Nowadays I visit mostly for the abundance of seating and their accommodation of large groups, rather than the abundance of food."}
{"text":"I agree with what other reviewers are saying when it comes to the quality of food.  While it does not blow me away it is not that bad or should I say consistently average.  I have not disliked anything I have had here.  The servers are always friendly and attentive and seem to handle really large groups very well.  The bar is pretty cool and they do make a really good margarita:)."}
{"text":"Review number three for spaghetti and meatballs.  The last time I went to the OSF was 10 years ago, and I had not gone back because that experience was painful with bad service and food.  So when a friend suggested it last week, I was open to giving it another chance.

We went in and were seated right away, but our server didn't show up for 10 minutes even though it was not that busy.  He finally arrived, and gave us our complimentary bread and took both our drink and food order.  Friendly, so that's a plus.  Our drinks arrived five minutes later so I was happy, thinking maybe this experience would be good.  Thirty minutes later, I wasn't so sure anymore.  Onto the food - the french onion soup was very bland, the beef broth was not robust at all.  The spaghetti and meatballs were also pretty tasteless, with the meatballs being mostly filler so they were moist at least.  One bright spot was the spumoni ice cream at the end, pistachio flavor was the best.

So, overall, can't blame the server for the wait on the food or the quality.  He was friendly and helpful when he finally showed up.  But, based on the food itself, I probably won't return for another few years."}
{"text":"Great food, atmosphere, & friendly staff.  While it's not the best Italian out there, for the price around $10 average, it's one of the best."}
{"text":"Love this place, that atmosphere is amazing and the food is fantastic! My only issue is that they do not take reservations between 4 and 8 making it difficult to plan if you can eat there or if you need to choose another restaurant!"}
{"text":"couldn't decide what to eat while in this area of chandler before seeing a movie. the hubs had never been here and the last time i ate at an old spaghetti factory was over ten years ago. since i always get to pick, i let him pick.

he picked this. the hostesses let us peruse  the menu before we were definite on our decision of eating here. 

once seated, our server brought water and gave us a few more minutes to decide on what we wanted.

hubs got the managers special, a half meat sauce and half mushroom sauce combo. i opted for the fettuccine alfredo and asked for garlic to be added. our server suggested i try their new garlic alfredo.

sure glad i took her suggestion! it was delicious. hubs liked his selection as well. 

their entrees come with a soup or salad and bread too. also the option of iced tea, etc. and and the end, spumoni or vanilla ice cream."}
{"text":"It's old. It's on Central Ave. Ok...I know you need more than that. 
The waiting area is homey and large. We went today for lunch as a party of 5 and waited about 15 minutes for our table. It's nice to see old favorites busy and bustling in this economy.

Aside from some missteps in service, the service was ok. Friendly, but just ok. One dining companion ordered a hearty size portion and got the same size as the rest of us. Same companion also ordered a side of sausage that didn't arrive with the rest of the food either. Server brought him a side of pasta....but he had ordered whole wheat pasta and she brought him regular pasta. Sausage came out a few minutes later. 

My spaghetti was salty. The meatballs were salty. The sauce was very very salty. The salad was over-dressed, but the creamy pesto dressing was actually pretty tasty. 

Overall, it was eh at best. It's my dining companion's favorite place so we'll likely go back, but not because I really want to. Maybe I can convince him to go to Postino's instead.....I hope. :)"}
{"text":"All the times I have come here I have not had any issues.. They just remodeled this place and I must say its beautiful. Would come here if I could all the time !"}
{"text":"Food is good, cheap, and the cheese bread is amazing. I do enjoy the wine selection and its perfect if your looking for a fast dinner."}
{"text":"I came for the nostalgia and remembered why I never ate here often back in Utah.  The food isn't terrible by any means, but growing up with a grama who made marinara from scratch it's difficult for me like most italian restaurants.  I had a great time here in spite of the slow service, over cooked bread less than ideal seating.  

Because I like going to places that remind me of being a kid I have no doubt I'll be back again."}
{"text":"Service was wanting this time by the food was very good. Definitely a step up from our last trip with freezer burned chicken (although I did NOT order the chicken again!). 
The meals were served hot, tasted fresh and were big enough to have plenty of leftovers."}
{"text":"So excited to have a nice lunch with my 16 yr old before a little 'after Christmas' shopping.  He wanted calamari as an appetizer!  I've done the server thing so I understand waiting to be seated so the wait staff has equal  tables so we had to wait a little bit to be seated. ..no biggie. Seated. ..yay!  NOBODY says 'hi' , ' be with you in a minute ' NOTHING!  NOTHING FOR OVER 10 minutes!  Never EVER giving them another chance!  Customer service is very important. ..( I'm done) Happy New Year!   :)  P.S. We are at Buffalo Wild Wings and happy!"}
{"text":"great food but service was sub par! it wasn't bust but we had to wait for ever to get our order in! very rarely mind but this was very bad!"}
{"text":"We have been to other OSF's, but never to the one less than a mile from our house.  We stopped in last night for dinner and had a great experience.  The restaurant is huge and has lots of fun furniture, lamps and other cool things to look at.  The service was friendly and fairly efficient.  The food is decent and reasonably priced.  I had the spaghetti and marinara with minestrone soup and finished off with rainbow sherbet.  They must be doing something right since they have been in Phoenix since 1972!"}
{"text":"Ok my four star rating for this restaurant is likely a little soft.  However this is also the cheapest full service restaurant in downtown Calgary.  The challenge Calgary has is that the only food choices downtown are fast food, and pretentious haute cuisine.  The spaghetti factory is the ONLY mid priced restaurant I've found near my workplace and hotel.

I was there twice this week once for the chorizo manicotti and the lunch sized lasagna.  The manicotti was decent.  The lasagna was about mediocre.  Par for the course.

For dinner, the service was great.  I Had a server who was helpful and chatty, and the hostess looked like my wife's best friend.

For the lunch, the restaurant was pretty full so service was a little slow.  But I was there with a couple of regulars, so our drinks were kept full, and fresh bread was plentiful."}
{"text":"First off the atmosphere is one of a kind a super cool. Almost worth going just for that.
They start you off with fresh baked Italian bread and a garlic butter which is quite good. For the entree I had the spaghetti with clam sauce with I side of their sautéed mushrooms. The dish by itself was ok but when I added the mushrooms it jumped to wonderful. They end the meal with ice cream or Spumante which is good but I was so full I didn't eat much. I also had a cup of coffee which was a good cup of restaurant coffee."}
{"text":"Great dinner place for the family, love the mushroom sauce and the pesto house dressing for the salad.  My kids like the kids menu choices. If you can sit in the trolley do it!  My sister and husband love the mizithra cheese and browned butter."}
{"text":"Fast friendly service, decent food and reasonable prices compared to other restaurants in the area.

Thanks to Rebecca for keeping us on time for our soccer game!  A very pleasant and knowledgeable server.

A bit too 'kid friendly' if you're hoping for a quiet meal but if you're a family then I highly recommend.

Good value for a quick satisfying meal."}
{"text":"Waited 15 minutes for the server to even come to us. Took another 15 minutes for her to get our drinks to us. Took another 10 minutes to get WATER to us. Never asked if we wanted a refill even though all of our cups were empty. Asked if the salad was included, she said it was. Got the recipt and it was an added fee. Not included in the meal as she said it was. Asked for bread 4 different times. Received bread twice and it was from the manager, not even our server. She asked when we were leaving if we got our bread. We didn't. Thanks for the horrible service."}
{"text":"Great place, great location, and for downtown EXCELLENT parking. The food was wonderful.  And despite the fact that every table seemed to be filled with holiday office parties, we were seated and served quickly."}
{"text":"The Good : Service was great! and the kitsch Deco was really fun!

The Bads :  Honestly i took one of their ''specialty'' the Meat Ball Spaghetti and it was Horrible, first we had a Soup as appetizer it was not bad but  could have been any Can Minestrone Soup. The main was just disastreous the pasta were so overcooked that it would have make any Italian cry. To give you an idea of the taste just think '' High school Cafeteria''.

honestly for 23$ + it was quite insulting, because some microwave paste can do a better job for less than 5$ 

Please don't go."}
{"text":"Tasted like the McDonald's of spaghetti. It's pretty obvious everything here is made before hand or brought in on trucks and just microwaved, leaves you lacking for about 16 dollars a person. Service was good though."}
{"text":"I was amazed how much the food sucked at this place.. I had the Sicilian w/ chips (looked like Lays chips).  I had a much better experience at the OSF in Seattle.  You would think the 2 would be the same, right?  I give this place 2 stars for having the old Paperboy video game present.. but the food... nah..  I'd rather go to a Olive Garden or Buca Di Peppo next time unless I'm in the Seattle area again."}
{"text":"Another fun and delicious meal with the nieces.  Great iced tea as well."}
{"text":"Had dinner at the Old Spaghetti Factory last night with the whole family.  The food was good, the service was good but the cost was way too high for the quality of both.  This was only the second time I had eaten their and in both cases I felt the same.  I guess if you have alot of extra money and want to try something different the Old Spaghetti Factory is your place.  Otherwise their are other places that can give you a better meal for the buck."}
{"text":"I haven't tried to many items from here, but the chicken parm was good, I had some chicken dish for lunch one day that wasn't the best.  The bread was fresh from the oven so the butter melted as soon as you spread it, and the free post meal sherbert is the 4th star!"}
{"text":"The restaurant reminds me of a quaint little countryside café.   It gives me that homey feeling like a mom and pop store instead of the chain restaurant that it is. I like how whatever entrée you order from the menu; you can get a complete meal from it.  Each entrée comes with a drink, bread, soup or salad, and their spumoni ice cream for dessert.  However, if you want \"Italian\" food, you're not going to get it here.  It's a very Americanized version of Italian food.  They do have all the classics: the pastas, lasagnas, etc.  I've been here several times and tried a few of their dishes.

Spaghetti Vesuvius:  cute name to start off.  Spicy chicken sausage and meatballs with mushroom.  I didn't think it was that spicy, but it was extra salty.  It's a very flavorful dish, however the individual tastes are all mushed together.  The noodles are a bit tough for me; perhaps undercooked.  However some people like it a bit tough.  

Gourmet Jumbo Crab Ravioli:  There's not a lot of ravioli pieces in the dish.  The edges that were not covered in the pesto alfredo sauce was dry.  I did like that they used fresh crab meat in the ravioli.  The creamy sauce was not bad and it wasn't too overpowering in my mouth.  It was able to taste pesto sauce and still enjoy the texture of the crab.  

Baked Lasagna:  This is the best of the 3 I've had.  It has 4 kinds of cheese, ground beef, and pork.  First of all they gave you a huge piece of lasagna. Then they topped it with mounds of marinara sauce.  You may have to remove some of the sauce if it's too much for you.  The noodles were cooked tender enough for my taste, but it was still able to hold its shape.  And the meat was blended well with all the flavors of the dish.  

I do like the cute little serving they have of the spumoni ice cream.  It's a great blend of pistachio, chocolate and strawberry.  And it's just the right amount after a large meal.  Maybe one of these days I'll go back just to try their chocolate desserts.  

If you like an American spin on Italian food, then you would like this place.  It's a convenient place to eat after shopping at the mall and their quick service is great if you're crunched for time.  But the food is just average and not that special."}
{"text":"Okay, I like the fact that your meal comes with a drink (milk, coffee or tea) and salad or soup and bread and dessert.  Or if you want to skip the drink and dessert at lunch it is $1.50 off your bill.

I think the angel hair with mizithra cheese sauce is FABULOUS.  I also think the eggplant parmesean is sometimes FABULOUS and sometimes average.  It is hit or miss.  The macaroni and cheese is also very good.

The salad and bread, not so good."}
{"text":"Giving them 4 stars for what it is: pretty good food in kind of a cool setting that is family and group friendly. Don't expect anymore."}
{"text":"We have a networking meeting there every week. 
Bryan was our server today and he did a fantastic job. 
He annouced he will be serving us in the beginning and asked at the end if we need anything. 
This is exactly how it should be done. 
Good job Bryan"}
{"text":"Extremely overly priced. Food is mediocre and very small portions. You literally get more noodles from a pack of ramen. I used to like this place when I was a kid but then again I was a kid. I probably liked it for its unique atmosphere and indoor train caboose. Me and my girlfriend went there last night and was seated in what I thought the smallest table in the place I'm 6-3 and weigh 450 lbs so I asked the waitress if she could please seat us in another larger table. She blankly stared at me extremely dumbfounded. Like she didnt understand anything I just said. It was very uncomfortable. After explaining that I was too big and needed more room a few times and talking slow I finally convinced her to give me another table. So she took me to another table that ended up being the exact same size. At this point I was very upset luckily a gentleman named Francisco stepped in and took us to another table that was larger. He brought us our food and refills before our waiter did and he was a busser. He was all over the place cleaning tables, serving drinks he was all over the place and actually made our night a lot better. On our way out we decided to tell the manager about what a good employee Francisco is.  But this is one place I will not go back too."}
{"text":"Quality and Value going downhill. Have been a regular, at least monthly, customer for nearly 20 years. Prices have doubled, food quality has waned and service remains spotty. Too bad because the buildings the restaurants are housed in are always interesting and it's a great place for large groups. Someone needs to \"right the ship\". The dinner we had tonight wasn't worth 1/2 the $50+ we paid."}
{"text":"The service at this location was HORRENDOUS.

Was not informed that soda is not included with the meal but milk, tea and coffee are.  So my son ordered a soda which was like $2.50 extra when he would have been happy with the free iced tea.

The salads came out with almost no dressing on them.  When I asked for more we were charged $.75 per salad for more.

Ordered a kids meal for my 6 year old.  Was brought out a regular sized meal.  When I asked the waitress informed me it was an adult portion.  When I said I wanted a kid meal she took the adult meal back and made us wait about 5 minutes for the kid portion to come back.

Had to ask for drink refills.

Waited forever for the bill and even longer for her to pick the bill up."}
{"text":"I have been to the factory in Phoenix - wasn't the least bit impressed.  My family wanted to try this one - I was hoping for the best, but yet again I was disappointed.  Its like another Olive Garden with everything premade so its nothing special and you can't customize anything.  Its only the way on the menu and thats it - no special orders.  I dont know what the big hype is with this place, this isn't real Italian and its nothing to write home about, there was nothing to be impressed with from the soups to the lame salads to the meal - all was mediocre and if you ask me they charge to much for the quality of the food. I got the ravioli - totally lacked flavor and their marinara is bland as well. Now that I have had both places I hope to NEVER return - the food sucks."}
{"text":"It's an eye assaulting restaurant of epic proportions. Like dining inside of a half-circus, half-carnival. But for $16 dollars, you get salad, entree, drink and ice cream. If you're looking for high end Italian food, this is not the place o go. But for lower end, pasta to suit everyone in the group type of place, I would recommend it. For my cheap belly that loves sauce and pasta together, Old Spaghetti Factory fulfills its needs."}
{"text":"Good food but decent quality. I got the fettuccini alfredo; the broccoli wasn't cooked all the way, the chicken was processed and the mushrooms were canned. 
 The bread is good however it gets hard fast, but ya garlic butter which is really yummy! 
And free ice cream at the end!"}
{"text":"Ate here on a Tuesday night. Arrived around 7:40pm and was told there was a 15 minute wait. Luckily it was only 4 minutes! Somewhat loud inside but you can still hold a conversation at your table.

Basic kids menu and basic iceberg lettuce salad. I had the seafood linguine and I was pleasantly surprised with the nice taste and good quantity of seafood in the dish. My husband had the goat cheese ravioli (can't remember the exact menu name). Very bland tasting.

Our server was attentive and almost too fast bringing things out. But still friendly service. Ask for the wifi password.

This isn't fine dining by any stretch of the imagination. However for the masses it's a decent place to eat."}
{"text":"Once upon a time I went on a really bad date to the Old Spaghetti Factory with a boy who wanted to show me authentic Italian food. If by \"authentic\" he meant that it was equivalent to buying dry pasta and a bottle of sauce from the grocery store, he was right. Needless to say, there wasn't a 2nd date. Last week I returned to the Old Spaghetti Factory after a 6 or 7 year absence and I'm not surprised to see that nothing has changed.

The atmosphere screams \"family restaurant\" in the worst kind of way (though I'll be the first to admit, I was tempted to ask for crayons to draw on my menu) and the food couldn't be more mediocre if it tried. I suppose I can get behind the \"choose your own adventure\" format they follow. Ordering an entrée also entitles you to your choice of starters and desserts but don't get too excited! It's really just salad and ice cream.

The service itself was nothing special. Granted, I did go here on New Years Eve and the place was packed, but then again when isn't this restaurant full?

Overall I was unimpressed and underwhelmed. Hopefully I can go another 6 or 7 years before I get dragged here again. And to the kid who took me here as a teenager: I sincerely hope you've found a more \"authentic\" restaurant to take your dates to when you want to show off your Italian heritage!"}
{"text":"Was amazingly good !!! The staff was awesome from entering the restaurant until we left !! Food was tasty too ! I will definitely be back !!"}
{"text":"What makes a persons first time at an iconic old time restaurant be so bad that they come home and immediately go to Yelp?  Have a long wait time in a restaurant that is 1/2 empty... check.  Seat the party at the table closest to the entrance and exit when there is plenty of tables in the dinning room... check.  Take over 20 minutes for a waiter to even acknowledge that they are there... check.  Serve salads before even putting the drinks on the table... check.  Never come back again once the food has been served and have your customers wishing they went to crappy Olive Garden instead... Check.  

I was excited to try this place since others seem to really enjoy it.  It's eclectic and old school Phoenix feel in the Roosevelt district IS charming.   The smell of old wood on a day it's been raining has its own unique old house feel and I was hoping for a good experience when I saw the comfy chairs and arcade machines.  

I wasn't put off by a 20 minute wait, although the restaurant did seem a bit empty.  But when we were sat at a table closest to the entrance and no one was around I did feel out of sorts and took a peek around.  The tables are set up so each table for the most part (except those in the trolley car) has its own private feel so being sat where everyone comes and goes was a little weird.  Still no big deal and we sat and chatted, looked over the menu, chatted some more and then realized that we still haven't see  our waiter and it has been 20+ minutes since we sat down.  We flagged the host who found our server and we waited another 5+ minutes.  Weird when there were so many servers walking by us and it seemed like a fairly slow night.  We considered walking out then.  I wish we had.

When the waiter did show, no apologies for the wait.  We ordered everything all at once because, well, we had plenty of time to make our decisions.  A long wait again and we were served bread and salads.  Then finally our drinks came after we started eating our salads and mentioned to the waiter that we still didn't have our drinks.  The food came before our salads were done and the waiter was quick to take the plates (even though one person hadn't fully finished her salad and only put it to the side when her dinner plate came.). My dinner plate was saturated in butter.  I like butter as much as the next person, but the pasta only tasted of butter and LOTS of parmesean.  My chicken Marsala was ok.  Nothing special.  Dessert came and we sat and waited for spoons before we got to eat our 1/2 melted ice cream.  Our drinks were never refilled- not even once.  The server was quick with running my credit card once he FINALLY came back and got it.  That was the only good service we saw.

My point...  The service was horrible.  The food was nearly ok.  The building is interesting.  It's a neat place, but neat isn't good.  Maybe it use to be good at one time.  I didn't see any of it.  Except the hot sourdough bread.  That's good.  Look I found something good in all of this!  I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"Quality and service is terrible here. There is way many better Italian food restaurants in the valley. 

I got the egg plant parmesan and it looked like my 7 year old tried to make it or it came from a box. The sauce was so so. It's definitely more of a tourist attraction or a place for people who haven't eaten real Italian food. Save your money, get a can of Chef Boyardee. It tastes way better!"}
{"text":"I love spaghetti factory one of my definite favorite restaurants they 're always aim to please great food great service and clean and I always enjoy bringing my friends there highly  I recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Food was pretty standard for larger pasta shops, but the price is so so reasonable that makes the difference.
Unlimited bread was always warm and fresh.
The service was impeccable and so kind and courteous.
The decorations are a bit extreme and a little overwhelming to the senses but quirky in a good way.
Always busy."}
{"text":"Ok this is place worth checking out
And I would give it a 5, but I did REALLY enjoy myself, I just cant give it a 5 because my Manocotti got my hopes quite high and dashed them expertly.
First plus was their Long island Ice tea was on point
Second plus was the flat bread with goat cheese and other stuff. I cant remember all that was on it, but I would go again just for those 2 things
Third the waitress was very attentive, she wasnt paying attention and came over to interrupt a heated argument I was having with my lady at the time. Not her fault, but it did put the grump in my frump. In all fairness it was worse for her than us I bet. (side note for my avid readers were doing fine, the argument was regarding Jurassic Park)

TL;DR: Best restaurant in the Marlborough mall area, probably between 17th - 32nd and Barlow to 68th

Went again
Waiter named Kaleb impressed THE HELL out of me 
Everything else I said earlier, except now I give it 5 starts"}
{"text":"Well its 6 am and ive been up for hours sick adter eating here last night. Absolute worst restaurant experience I've ever had. Ordered our drinks, 1 beer and bottle of wine,  at approx 7:05-7:10... I kid you not, we got the beer delivered 10 minutes later and the bottle of wine at 7:38!!!! 7:38 exactly. We had to flag down 2 people and eventually the bartender brought it over. Our server was never to be found. The food and the manager were the only saving grace,  except mine of course because I'm sick now and can't keep anything down. On a different note,  The Vesuvius is the best.  If it didn't have meat (Im a vegetarian) then that'd be my go to meal. I ordered the managers special with marinara and Alfredo,  but got marinara and Mizithra. Nasty crap that Mizithra is, but its obviously subjective. I imagine that's why I'm sick.  It tasted horrible.  I didn't want to wait for the correct meal since we waited so long and I wanted to eat with my in laws who are in from out of town.  All in all, I'll never go to an OSF again. Worst service I've ever had.  Thank you to the manager who understood our frustration and dealt with our hangry selves. You were very sweet and we appreciate you.  

Note: get the spumoni ice cream.  It'll change your life."}
{"text":"Came here tonight with the boyfriend and I must say I was pretty impressed. 

For starters they had a Honey Jack Daniels Lemon Drop....the bomb!!! If you haven't had one go right now totally yummy!!

I had the spaghetti with meat sauce and he had the #3 Meat Lovers Plate...Spaghetti w/meat sauce, Italian Sausage and Meatballs.  Both were pretty tasty. 

What I loved most about this place though was it reminded me of happy times of my childhood. I spent many a birthdays at the one in downtown San Diego. It was nice that it hadn't changed that much...just better drinks now ;)"}
{"text":"Took the family and was, er, not impressed.

We waited 25 minutes from the time we sat down, to when they came to take our drink order.

It was 50 minutes from the time we ordered until we got our food.

My wife's lasagna was still frozen on the inside, and my linguine had a thick leathery top from sitting under a heat lamp for too long.

To top it all off, our waitress was clearly wearing a soiled adult diaper that reeked and made us wish to high heaven we were eating elsewhere.

We pointed out the issue with the lasagna, and my wife just asked them to return it (she was no longer hungry).  They didn't take the lasagna off our bill until I dug in and asked to speak with the manager.

I still cringe and have phantom smells of our waitress every time I walk by that place.

It was the single-worst, dining-out experience in my life."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with my family. First the waiter dropped the drinks down my brothers back. Then proceeded to completely get the orders wrong. I never got what I originally ordered, had to settle for what was brought out. Sadly he didn't even get the ice cream order right. Probably the last time we go here."}
{"text":"Ugh, I tried this as a quick post celebration dinner for this semester and was pretty sad. I ordered the chicken marsala and it literally tasted like they didn't cook the wine out of the sauce and the noodles were cold. My date ordered the regular spaghetti and said it was bland. The cherry on top of our visit was the dessert? Which was mud pie, but..... It had Hershey's chocolate sauce on the plate. 

For what the check was, I'll stick to oreganos or pretty much any other place that sells pasta."}
{"text":"Bread and cheezey bread was great. Spaghetti could have cooked a bit longer, and the sauce was on the dry side.  Atmosphere was cool, and the waitress would have been better trained.  Next time I may try the Alfredo sauce but the Marinaria sauce was nothing to brag about."}
{"text":"It had been a year since our last visit to Old Spaghetti Factory.  What a difference a year makes!  My dinner was not too impressive.  Actually no one in our party of four was thrilled with their meal.  Very small portions and the food seemed like it was not even cooked fresh.

Don't think that we will be back any time soon.  I am pretty sad about that, as I have fond memories of OSF."}
{"text":"I go a lot of places and know good service when I see it. Henry was one of the best waiters I have seen. 

I will definitely come here again."}
{"text":"One of the worst pasta i ever try in my life, over cooked, plain, nothing special at all, not worthy, the service is ok, friendly waiters, but that's all, how come this place is review as one of the best italian food in Toronto still a mistery for me."}
{"text":"Food was good but our waiter was horrible and our lunch (at 2 in the afternoon) took over 2 hours because the service was so slow."}
{"text":"While the waiter was friendly and offered great service, the food was not good at all.
The Clam Chowder had rarely any clams and was very sweet. Two of us changed it to a Caesars Salad. The pasta with seafood was very sweet as well and tasted very  good. 
All in all: low prices at low tastes..."}
{"text":"It had been a while since I had eaten here. I used to bring my staff here for post team building meals, until the light rail traffic just made it horrendous to take a bunch of people onto downtown traffic.

My wife and I decided that we wanted a change; therefore, she suggested that we pay this place a visit.

We were quite impressed with the remodeling efforts as it really opened up the lobby, and brought a more modern touch to the place. It was a Friday evening, and there was certainly a large crowd and the wait was about a 45 minutes. We didn't mind it much as we were in no hurry, and we had already committed to sampling their dishes.

She chose the rich meat sauce pasta classic, and I had the sicilian meatballs.

The pasta was superb. Not overly watery. Just right, and we didn't need to douse it in sauce to enjoy its flavor. However, the meatballs in my meal were overcooked, and lacked any of the tasty characteristics I used to remember from this place.

What really downgraded our mediocre opinion was the service. Either the place was too busy, and they didn't have enough staff, or the waitress serving us was taking long breaks in between her table rotation visits. In either case, we sat there for long periods of time with nary a refill, and it took forever for her to return once we were done with our meals. Then she brought in the signature spumoni for dessert, and it was already partially melted.

Then to top it all off, which set off my wife, is that she asked if we were together or if we wanted separate checks? Improper etiquette right there. I realize that many couples now split checks, but perhaps rephrasing the question would've been more proper. Just my opinion.

Needless to say, we will not be returning. Even though the pasta was superb, we have too many options in many parts of the valley to have to frequent this place, and have to settle for a re-peat of dreadful service."}
{"text":"This place was pretty surprising because I have driven by it numerous times but never had been inside.  The inside is huge and looks like it can serve a lot of people, which explains why it looks so packed on weekend.  The food is average but they do give you big portions enough that maybe two or three people can easily share two plates.  The service was pretty good as well."}
{"text":"Disgusting!

I've always wanted to go here because the buildings and the decor pulled me in. The food was worse than fast food. Pasta was overcooked. Broccoli tasted old, like really old. I actually considered leaving a tip and ditching the bill because I was appalled that I would have to give this minimal, barely edible restaurant money. A place like this doesn't deserve to take your money. There was absolutely no effort put in the food or service."}
{"text":"When you decide to take your family for dinner you always hope that it will be good. I was so glad that our visit to your restaurant was what it was. Everything was amazing from our server chris to the food we had. Everything was just outstanding."}
{"text":"Without a doubt the worst meal my fiancee' and myself have had.  We've tried a few times to eat dinner here and each time the wait has been exceedingly long so we've skipped it. However one night it was storming so psychotically we postulated that no one would be crazy enough to want to go out to eat. Well, except us anyway. We arrived and sure enough there was no wait at all, and to top it off there was a parking spot right out front.  Walking in and getting sat by the smiling hostess was pretty much the only good thing about this experience.  We were sat at a table in the middle of the room surrounded by screaming children and people talking loudly on cell phones.  We sat waiting for 10 minutes before being approached by our server. A male about mid 20's who had quite an annoying arrogance to him that almost turned our stomachs.  The questions we asked about the pastas we've never ingested were answered with a snideness that even a smart-ass such as myself has yet to see in a waiter.  She settled on The Manager's Favorite with the Clam and Mizithra Cheese. After a slight argument with the server on if that was what she really wanted and was sure she wanted it he finally wrote it down.  Turning to me I ordered the Veal Parmigiana, he didn't seem to have anything to add so he walked away.  25 minutes later quite possibly the smallest plate of 2 kinds of past mixxed together is sat in front of my fiancee. What appeared in front of myself was a piece of breaded veal that was only slightly bigger than a poptart,  and a pile of spaghetti the size of my fist covered by a marinara sauce that was pink and almost looked like liquid bubblegum.. I So wish I was making most of this up, but sadly its true.  

Lets start with the fiancees' meal first, aside from the limit of pasta there was barely any clam sauce on half of it, she actually liked the favor of the cheese dish more so than the clam side of things, the clam sauce was far too salty and kept mixing with the cheese since it was together in 1 dish. You'd think you'd have some kind of splitter to keep the sauces from tainting each other. She says that the garlic butter that come out with the bread was the best part of the meal.

Mine on the other hand was a perfect example of how to completely screw up veal parmigiana. The breaded cooked breast was dry, tasteless, and tough. The pasta sauce had a flavor to it that screamed \"I Should not be in this marinara sauce!\" We pondered over it for at least 25 minutes passing the fork back and forth between each other trying to figure out what the particular spice or herb used to create the assault on my taste buds. We could not identify it and I felt quite depressed that I had let this bad meal get one over on me.  On top of the flavor being something I have never had in my mouth before, it also had no cohesiveness at all, no matter how much I stirred/mixed/tinkered/padded/twisted I could not get the sauce to stick to the noodles.  

We managed to shovel down only half of our respective meals before calling it quits.  When the server noticed our plight he basically took the plates off our table with a few comments with an undertone of arrogance. 

I think I have made enough of my point clear. We won't be giving this another shot, unless of course we're exceedingly drunk. Then it may be a possibility."}
{"text":"The food was alright but nothing spectacular and the decor was pretty over the top with the stain glass grandmother lamps everywhere. I felt that they were a bit skimpy on the sauce though and the food could have been warmer but the food overall wasn't bad. I would have given it 4 stars but the service was so bad so that's where it lost a star. The waitress handed over the bill without serving the ice cream and the drink that was included in our meal. When we remembered about the missing order it was impossible to flag down any servers and I'm pretty sure a lot of those servers saw us calling but wouldn't come. When we finally got a waitress to take our order she never came back and we had to go over the entire process of flagging a waiter who took forever to bring us the rest of our meal. Towards the end our stay wasn't as enjoyable."}
{"text":"Food good. Server Michael never mentioned the free included spumanti ice cream 
We left without it."}
{"text":"Oh dear. This is probably the worst restaurant that I have ever been to in Toronto! I was with a group so it was a set menu but it was really dreadful- the spaghetti was mushy and over cooked and the sauce was so sweet that the only way to make it semi-edible was to throw spicy pepper on and to coat in the poor quality powder cheese provided. If you are called the spaghetti factory I think that you should be able to produce acceptable pasta. Even my children would have issues with this place. If you have the palate of a six year old then you may be ok but otherwise stay clear. I'd rather save my calories and eat nothing than to eat here ever again."}
{"text":"The food was really good, the service was really bad.... Lindsey the FOH Manager took great care us and it wasen't neccessary. Thank You....."}
{"text":"I've been here a number of times. Usually the food is pretty good. The last time I went though there was an insect in my salad. When I brought this to the attention  of a server she took it promising to bring another, and never came back.  When I brought it to another servers attention she got me another one, but it came at the same time as my entree, so it ruined the rhythm of the meal, and generally just ruined the dining experience.

Also, either living in the U.S. has changed my view on portioning or the portion have gotten really small. I'm not really sure what to make of this. The food was ok. I'll try again and maybe update."}
{"text":"We were in the general vicinity of The Old Spaghetti Factory and decided it would be THE place for lunch today. When we walked in, the hostess said it would be about 15 minutes but it was less than 5. Nice! 

What I liked most about the OSF is that everyone--EVERYONE--is friendly and attentive, asking if all is good, if they could get anything more and thanking us for being there. And then there's the food. As many other reviewers have raved about, the Mizithra in browned butter is amazing. So good that it's my splurge from my low-carb diet. That and a piece of the sourdough bread. And I really like the balsamic vinaigrette. It's just...good. Homey, welcoming and easy to be there. It's not loud like some restaurants, allowing for good conversation to flow. It's like they know that the eating experience is not just about the food but it's the atmosphere, the customer service and making people feel welcome.

So kudos for manager Stephan and all his crew. Looking forward to seeing y'all again. And again. Oh, and again :)"}
{"text":"Even though their establishment has lots of rooms and isolated areas, they managed to sit the only family with the restless noisy kid right next to my wife and I. They must be much more concerned about their section allocations than the enjoyment of their customers. Don't go here expecting a nice quiet lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"kinda pricey for what your getting, non-authentic (primo---aka caker pasta)
with non authentic sauce...its ok if thats what you want but not what i want
if you like this place, you probably like east side as well...enough said"}
{"text":"Father's Day dinner with the family, disgusting. 

It's  hard to believe that a restaurant can call this food. 
Something as simple as fettuccini & shrimp could really be bad. 

How difficult is it to cook pasta , it was way undercooked, the dinner salad that came was limp & warm. 

A child's meal of angel hair pasta cooked with butter only for an 11year old was just as bad swimming g in liquid butter goo. 

The pictures of this restaurants food on yelp is not from customers. It's staged food from the restaurant. 

I will never be going back."}
{"text":"Been wanting to come here for years as it's a Phoenix insitution. First impression of the building and decor; \"fire hazard\". Made me feel uncomfortable right away like watching an episode of hoarders. But I get that some might find that \"nostalgic\", that's fine, moving on. Service was ok, nothing special. I find their menu confusing, took a while to figure out what is what. The bread tasted weird and the actual food was just nasty. I hate Olive Garden but I'd rather eat there any day of the week than come back to Spaghetti Factory! Seriously people!? Why the good reviews?! Crap from a can. Reheat and serve."}
{"text":"All I can say is that if I'd wanted overcooked pasta, I would have gone to my grandmother's house and it wouldn't have cost me 65 bucks. I guess their spaghetti really is old. The only good thing Abe it this place is the bread. Run, don't walk, away from this place!"}
{"text":"This OSF just opened up nearby at the Chandler Mall so we decided to give it a try one night for dinner.

I ordered the Garlic Mizithra and the BF had the Premier (Lasagna & Chicken Marsala combo). We also got a side of two meatballs to share. All entrees come with a soft drink, soup or salad and ice cream at the end. The bf chose the soup (minstrone) and I chose the salad (garden salad). The soup was gross. The salad was blah. The honey mustard dressing was yummy though. The bread and butter they offered was better than I expected. It was a fresh loaf of sourdough. Nice, crispy and slightly chewy. Our entrees came and I was quite surprise with my dish. It was spaghetti tossed in butter with bacon bits, mushrooms and mizithra cheese. I couldn't stop eating it. The bits of cheese was delightful and there was tons of it tossed in. I liked that it wasn't salty but a soft subtle flavor. I thought the lasagna was decent and the marsala was alright. My BF really enjoyed them. The meatballs were okay. I can't say much about them. At the end of our meal we had a choice of a scoop of ice cream (spumoni or vanilla with chocolate sauce). We chose one of each. They were nothing special but a nice little treat to seal up our dinner. 

With two 20oz beers our total came out to around $45 before tip. I thought it was of fair value. I'd probably go back just for the Garlic Mizithra. Everything else was nothing memorable."}
{"text":"When i found out that this was being built, I was super excited to try it since I had heard so many great things about this restaurant chain. So, Friday night, I ordered my husband to meet me there. First things first, have fun finding a parking spot! Once inside, we waited about 15 minutes before being taken to a booth. The overall setup of the restaurant is very nice, spacious with very comfortable seating and a fun trolly car in the middle of the restaurant where they seat people as well. The aroma upon entering was very pleasant so I thought we were in for a delicious dining experience and that OSF had potential to be added to our restaurant rotation. 
I was definately pleased when I saw the price of everything and that all meals included salad, bread, drink, and ice cream. Unfortunately, this was also a downfall because the cheaper the place, the more family friendly it is, hence more asshole kids! They were fricken everywhere, my head was spinning. I would like to add that if you have kids and they are screaming, get them the F out of the restaurant. Just because you think its adorable that little Johnny is banging his silverware around and screaming at the top of his lungs doesn't mean I enjoy it. In fact, one of these days, you are going to get punched in the face thanks to Little Johnny!
Anyways, the husband and I, both having large appetites, each ordered platters. Me: The meat lovers treat which was spaghetti with meatballs and sausage (I tried it because it is the Old Spaghetti Factory after all and they should make good Spaghetti) and the hub chose the premier which was lasagna and chicken marsala. Both of us chose the salad with the creamy pesto dressing (they didnt have ranch and this was the closest dressing to it). We were off to a good start when the bread arrived hot and fresh, a lovely loaf of sourdough goodness. The salad, although consisting of only iceberg lettuce and a few carrots, was refreshing and acted as an excellent vehicle for getting the creamy and delicious dressing into my mouf! However, when the actual meals arrived, everything just seemed mediocre. The sauce on my spaghetti tasted jarred, didnt have much meat in it which was odd for a meat sauce, the meatballs were wayyyyyy too salty, and the sausage was your basic sausage, nothing special about it. The hub said his meal was very much the same, nothing great. In fact, at one point, he stated that he wished he was at Olive Garden. Unfortunately, I couldn't disagree. In any event, I decided to box up the remainder of my meal and we proceeded with eating our spumoni which obviously wasn't bad. How can you mess up ice cream though that is scooped from a bucket???
When leaving, I decided I wanted to go into the mall to see the puppies at puppies of love. Brings me such joy. Haha. I wasnt sure what to do with my box of leftovers but when thinking about it, I determined that they were not even going to get eaten so there was no point in taking it. All in all, if you are looking for cheap and your not a true Italian and dont care about true Italian food, then you might like this place. However, if you want GOOD spaghetti and meatballs, try Rigatonies (all their food is great) or Pesto's. Thank you very much   :)"}
{"text":"I was invited to a fabulous 18th birthday party.  It made me feel so young talking to these wonderful group of girls.  While I don't want to be 18 again, I do envy  that flawless and unblemished skin.  

OSF accomodates quite a few large parties.  Our table, a very snug  seating for 25, backed up against the wall.  It made it hard to visit one another.   Once we were seated, it took awhile (an hour) for the bread and butter to come to our table.   We asked for it a few times, but it got lost somewhere in the kitchen.  My cutie pie was so hungry, he was crying.  My friend had to flag someone to get my boy some bread!  Then out came a single bread.   My cutie pie wasn't the only one starving as all eyes followed the fresh hot sourdough bread laid in front of him.  It should have been the cue to bring out all the bread at the same time instead of just the one we asked for.   

The food.  I looked over the menu...twice...three times.  I decided on the Baked Chicken and minestrone soup.  The chicken was a little bland.  At least I expected the soup to be on the salty side, and it was.   While I love to cook my own pasta at home, I'm not a fan of ordering it.   I settled for chianti to go with my meal.  My hubby ordered the Lasagna Vegetariano.  The pasta was overcooked then drenched with a watery marinara sauce.  My cutie pie liked the  Fetuccine Alfredo.  It was pretty good for a kid's meal.

Not a bad place as long as you enjoy good company, but overall experience was just A-OK."}
{"text":"3.5/5
Ive been here a few times.  Is it the greatest spaghetti I've ever had...well definitely not.  Does it have the best salads, no it does not.  It is rather simple, and somewhat symbolic.  Those of you who have lived in Toronto your entire life know what I mean, you know the Spaghetti factory is there, and for me its tried tested and true.  Its got this old school charm to it, and the ambience is hard to describe, though classic would be fitting.  
The dishes Ive had were all decent, and I was satisfied and every now and then I come back and pay them a little visit.  Now the question is, Should the spaghetti factory be \"the best spaghetti\" you've ever had?  That's really up to the company, and their recipe culinary arts sector to decide if anything needs revamp, updated, or if they really want to be competitive to step up their game etc.  
Personally, I'm happy with all of its simplicity, but I would never said that it was, THE BEST..and if I wanted the best, Id yelp \"best italian food\" and...well it appears to be corrodes on john street.  And if I wanted the best steak, I guess id have to go to jacobs, but then id expect to pay a premium lol."}
{"text":"Not the best. Wanted to try this place. Used to go to the one down town Phx. Toasted ravs were great. Got a loaf of bread that was wonderful. I got the clam sauce. It had little bits of green peppers. Minestrone just ok. Carrots where uncooked. Won't go back. Sorry."}
{"text":"This place is great for a big group and we had lots of kids with us so it was perfect.   As a foodie, this is not my first choice but it served its purpose :)

It was a Friday night and I was really craving/needing a nice glass of wine.  I ordered the Malbec and 15 minutes later the waiter announced that they didn't have any ... so I had my water.

I ordered the spicy spaghetti, which is not spicy and was pretty bland.  But my expectations were not too high to be honest so it didn't really disappoint.  Our waiter put up with us and all our requests so that was great."}
{"text":"My sister and I stopped by The Old Spaghetti Factory just before the dinner rush one Sunday. Each time I've been to The Old Spaghetti Factory, the meal has been very good - hot and fresh, well cooked and tasty - and it's a great price for downtown Calgary dining. 

Sadly, our cutlery was filthy, forcing us to request new, clean flatware - which we promptly received - and the service was average. After taking our order and dropping off the complimentary loaf of bread, we weren't approached until our order was received, at which point we didn't see our server again until we flagged her down for the bill.

The restaurant quickly fills up on an evening, so if you intend to go, be sure to arrive early, lest you spend an hour waiting. And if you have any sense for good wine at all, avoid the by-the-glass house wines and stick to cocktails or sparkling water."}
{"text":"I haven't gone here for couple of years and decided to go today. We were seated quickly but next to the kitchen door. Our waiter did not really have a personality but did come by a few times to check on us. He was so busy that a supervisor or manager brought out our food. She really didn't have a personality. She did not say one word to us. Food was ok. I should've have went with my first instinct, spaghetti. I have the pesto checked penne. My wife pesto is better. This was a very creamy pesto. You can see the oil on the sauce. The chicken was really dry. On top of this I got a very bad stomach ache from it and currently still going."}
{"text":"The old Spaghetti Factory has been a stop on our Toronto itinerary for many years. 

There are some who rip it apart and others that love it. I tend to lean to the side of those who love it. To me the lure here is all of the crazy decorations in the building combined with the reasonably good food. 

When you go to the Spaghetti Factory, you order spaghetti. 

I ordered the \"Managers Favourite\" which is a \"combination\" spaghetti platter. My choices were the spicy meat sauce and the brown butter with Mizithra cheese. The meat sauce was hearty, but not very spicy and the brown butter with cheese is a taste to behold. This is not melted cheese, but a dry cheese sprinkled over the spaghetti sauce. Complete this with a salad and it's an Italian meal to fill your belly. 

Warning.. we ordered some of their \"speciality drinks\" and they were way too weak for the money. Either drink beer or water and save your money. 

We'll definitely keep the old spaghetti factory as one of our stops on any Toronto area trip.."}
{"text":"Should have just made something at home would have been better. The food is nothing special and the server we had didn't stay hello she just opened with I'm the one in training. I gave it 2 stars because it was clean and you do get a scoop of ice cream at the end of your meal. All in all im glad I tried it because now I know not to ever go back. 
Thanks but no Thanks"}
{"text":"I went to the SF before attending a show at the Playhouse on the Park at the Central Arts Plaza.  It was just a quick walk from the venue.  I was seated after only a very short wait and was cared for by Amber, Her service was excellent and there was plenty of food! (salad, bread, pasta, sauce and dessert).  I also enjoyed a great g and t from the bar.  Rian was attentive and as I watched the other staff work I could see that they all shared this trait.  It's not always easy to go to someplace alone; but, I felt right at home here.  Thanks."}
{"text":"Tasty for fast no frills italian. Consistently tend to skimp on the marinara though. Always need to ask for a side of it when the meal comes. The fresh bread, salad, drink and dessert included can't be beat pricewise when dining out with the family."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  .. The food.   It is really on point.  The breads are fresh and yummy (gotta use the butters)..pastas are the real deal, salad, gelato is a must! 
    I heard it's Haunted?  Plus they have all the atmosphere coolness you would expect..  Super cool decor, classic arcade games and other entertainment (sometimes balloons, artists, and such)..
The upholstery is rad and colorful dark woods, there is also a Spagetti Tree (have to see).. Among other things..
     But honestly the food alone.. Will make you moan."}

No refills, took an hour and a half to get our meal and it wasn't even busy!  Very disappointed!"}
{"text":"I came here during their 50% Off promotion. Whatever we ordered, was 50% of the original price.

Service = excellent; the servers were all charming and the folks who did the hosting were great
Price = regardless of the promotion, I felt that the meals were quite reasonable
Food = this is where the OSF lost points in my book; food is mediocre and the portions are too big to the point that you no longer enjoy what is in front of you

Come here if you're short on cash or if you're with company who have not eaten anything in days."}
{"text":"This place has been here in this location forever. I remember coming here as a kid when it was called \"The Spaghetti Company\" and regarding it as a major treat. The restaurant is housed in what looks like somebody's house on the corner of Central and McDowell, (and I always thought it was.) The interior is cavernous and museum-like, with old Victorian-era photographs, bookshelves, hidden rooms, chandeliers, and antiques on the walls. There's even a trolley cable car in the middle of the place where you can sit in and eat. As a child, I thought this was the coolest place ever. My brother and I would even go off and \"explore\" the restaurant when we finished our meals.

So, this place definitely has nostalgia for me. I always thought it was a unique, special place and that the people that were in the photographs lived in there at one point and now probably haunted the restaurant from the hidden upstairs level (how do you get up there?! There must be a hidden staircase somewhere...)

But then my young, naive little mind discovered the existence of a little thing called a \"chain restaurant.\" \"Wait, so you mean there's ANOTHER Spaghetti Factory? In Fresno?! I thought this was the only one? I thought it was a Phoenix thing?\" I wasn't sure what to make of that fact. I felt a little bit betrayed, as a matter of fact. Maybe it wasn't as magical and old as I thought. Regardless, the building it has occupied for the past twenty (thirty?) years has real charm and history, and I'm glad it's home to the Spaghetti Factory, and not a Cricket phone paycenter. 

The food isn't really anything special. Honestly, it's rather forgettable. But then again, I was always more focused on finding the secret book that would open the trapdoor than on my lasagna. I haven't ever had a terrible experience with service or the food, but it's certainly nothing to rave about. I came here the other weekend with some friends and we had a good time; had nothing to complain about. The portions are rather small, however. 

Now that it's directly across from the lightrail maybe I will stop by if I'm in the area. It will always have a sort of nostalgic status in my mind, but I have to say, I love the OSF of 1991the best."}
{"text":"Not sure if Mike Pulous still runs this place or not - but still has the same good food as the original on Central Ave.  Manager special is my fav - with 2 of the sauce choices on 1 plate of pasta- I got the meat sauce, and the brown butter/cheese sauce - a great combo.  They bring a nice warm loaf of french bread with your included chilled salad.  Add a glass of cabernet wine, and top it off with spomoni ice cream - and it is a great meal.  The bar is nice and large - and a great place to sit and have dinner if you are just a single.  The bartender is always pleasant and knows how to take care of you with great service.  I have been back a few times and have enjoyed consistant great food.  I hope this place makes it - I know the rent has to be high at Chandler Mall.  So I am going to do my best and eat there at least a couple times a month!!!  :)"}
{"text":"I've had two experiences at The Old Spaghetti Factory this summer.  First was with a small group, two friends and a child and the service was perfect!  The second was with a a large group for a send-off for a young friend going to college. Despite the fact they were both on a week night, with reservations an hour a part, the service for the larger group was horrible.  But the food at The Spag-Fac is still great!    A veteran of the Old Spaghetti Factory since it's inception in Vancouver in Gastown (we were there the first year it opened with a Family event in the early 70's  and had great service and great food.) I love the all inclusive, affordable meals.   One of the problems with our Large Group experience was the fact there were several large groups that night and our group trickled in for an half hour after our reservation time.  Still, our waiter was not on his game.  He did recommend a decent wine, but the customary bread was slow in coming and at one point I got up and went over to bus staff to ask them to find our waiter.  
I could have gone to the manager, but I knew the bus staff would do that anyway and didn't want to upset our waiter any more than our critical members of the group already had. 
I've been with large groups at various locations of this restaurant chain and we've never had service that was less than excellent before.
 We finally received our meal almost an hour after we arrived and the manager took care of us afterward with  gift cards, and free meals for the most upset members and a free drink for our celebrating Going Away Girl. 
I have three recommendations for anyone with a large party going to The Old Spaghetti Factory.  Make sure you get separate bills for everyone right at the start of the meal and make it clear who's paying for what at that time before you even order drinks. When you order your meal, order everything at once, your salad choice, your entree choice, your beverage choice (it comes with coffee or tea) and your dessert choice (spumoni or vanilla ice cream).  If possible have your  group get there on time.  And for now, be prepared to park on the street.  The parking lot beside the restaurant has a plethora of heavy equipment in it and a construction.
Last but not least we owe a four star salute to Manager Courtney, who found a way to appease the harshest critics.   I will be going back because I'm a long time fan and because the young manager made it right in the end.."}
{"text":"I think this place would be absolutely fantastic for kids. Not only does it look and feel fun, the all-inclusive meals (bread, salad, entree and ICE CREAM) and over-exuberant staff make for a fabulous family experience. For the more discerning adult out for a weekend meal, however, not so much. 

It started out promising. We were seated in a nice, big booth, in a quiet corner and served warm bread, with two types of butter (in a plastic tub), by a ridiculously friendly waiter. However, the salad was largely Iceberg based, with rather dire dressing, and the pasta was just so-so. 

There was definitely enough to fill your belly - too much, in fact, to the point where I could barely stomach the sight of the little silver tray of ice cream delivered at the end.  

The trip to the bathroom was pretty exciting. Not because of the state of the facilities themselves (pretty unpleasant, to be honest), but rather the excuse to wind through the enormous dining room exploring all the weird relics on show, like the old trolley and phone boxes, in which you can actually dine! A kid's dream, indeed."}
{"text":"Old Spaghetti Factory.  Barf.
Tourist central.  Creepy decor.  Angst ridden wait staff.  And, don't even get me started on the food.
I went here with my sister and her offspring.  Although the kids did not seem to mind the possibly haunted, and rather run down carousel, and seemed to delight in being provided with crayons and paper, I however, was not as easily appeased.  I went the safety route with my order of 2 glasses of red, and a chicken salad, and expectations were met appropriately.   Unless you are really seeking some overpriced food, in a hideous atmosphere, and care to endure the reems of tourists pouring out of the summer ball games, do youself a favour and choose of the lesser evils the Esplanade has to offer."}
{"text":"We had a reservation here a few nights ago for my wife's birthday party. I called twice in advance to confirm reservations and head count to ensure a smooth process for all when we arrived. Reservations were at 7:15 but we didn't get seated until 7:40ish. 

Once seated our server was extremely slow, now to be fair we had a group of 19/20. I politely asked the manager if there was any way we could get another server and I was told they only have multiple servers for parties of 25+. 

We finally got the appetizers and realized that plates had never been put on the table. Once the actual entrees were ordered the food was bland and average (I ordered the spinach and cheese ravioli) 

The aesthetics and restaurant itself was nice and had a cool ambiance of an old house. I did however notice that the baby changing station in the men's room was filthy. Looked like it hadn't been wiped down in months. 

I was not impressed and will never be back."}
{"text":"Ok, so the service was great, but it was definitely chain Italian food.  The bread was a bit stale, the lettuce was defiantly sitting for quite a while as wilted as it was, my meal was a bit on the cooler side when I got it, and all of the food i tried was OK.  I was asked by my son, who loves this place, if i would come back......I mean I would eat here, but I would not plan to come.  

Plus items, the meals are well priced for a full 3 course meal.  The ambiance and location are fantastic."}
{"text":"We love The Old Spaghetti Factory! Been eating at these restaurants since I was a kid. My favorite is the Mizithra and butter but all the other options are really good. They have a pesto salad dressing that is delicious. They are so old school that after the meal they serve a scoop of spamoni ice cream. Love this place. Nothing's changed in over 30 years"}
{"text":"I've been to Old Spaghetti Factory location between Arizona and California since I was a kid. Always consistent and always great! We'll be back over and over again."}
{"text":"The Old Spaghetti Factory has a beautiful interior with amusement park designed interior, but not so great and expensive pasta. 

Nevertheless, I enjoyed my time here because it brought out the childhood in me again. I mean, there were cable cars, carousels, etc to sit and dine in a normal restaurant. 

I tried the meatballs with spaghetti, haha yes, the classic for $17.50. HOLEY MOLEY, $17.50 just for spaghetti and meatballs?! Get this, plain spaghetti with NO meat, just sauce is $14.50.  If you want a salad, that's over $10 as well. The baby back ribs seem more worth it for $23. 

The pasta alone wasn't that great tbh, it tasted like normal pasta that you can make at home for less than $1. The only thing attractive about this place was the decor, other than that, a tourist trap."}
{"text":"This restaurant goes back to my youth; there are a few of these in the Los Angeles area and it was on the list of places we would all go, extended family included, for Grandma's birthday.

I think teenagers go here in their early dating years too, at least in Los Angeles.

It is a good \"Grandma/Grandpa\" place, isn't it?   It is also a great place for kids, tourists and picky eaters--this is about as bland as you get in Italian inspired cuisine.  

All that being writ, I can't give this the lowest rating.  No, I would never choose to eat here.  But, when the choice hasn't been mine (twice in Toronto), I have actually kind of enjoyed it.  The food, while not exciting, is certainly fine--I mean, you know what you are going to get, the portions are big enough and the quality is decent, right?  The atmosphere is super kitsch but the magician guy kept the kids entertained.  The wait service was entirely adequate or better.  And the prices were very reasonable.  

Given what it is, it is totally A-OK.  Going in here and expecting much more would be like berating a McDonalds's.  OSF exists for tourists and families and it serves those markets well.

Hopefully I'll never have to eat here again.  But, if I do, I will leave my snobbery self at the door and enjoy a common pasta meal with the common people.  And maybe I'll get a balloon animals too!"}
{"text":"First time here, waited long time for water,  waitress is not very friendly, chicken is canned chicken and was pink. Broccoli is hard and cold. Bread was warm and great!  Will not be returning :("}
{"text":"Great service average food. They waiter was nice and friendly and all over our drink service which was nice. 

The restaurant was quite busy that night to and he was all over everything. 

The food came out quite fast and actually tasted amazing. 

The menu wasn't the same as I'm used to coming from the original in new Westminster. I believe they have more items. 

I would go back to this location just from that last experience."}
{"text":"You go for the themed resturant, after picking up my daughter from girl scout camp, I wanted to take her someplace she would enjoy, there is plenty to see here and my daughter enjoys spaghetti so it was a good combination.  I wouldn't recommend this place for the food, it's more about the fun you have with the teme."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with a friend and my son of the first time. Server was good, nothing out of the ordinary. My sons food came out first. it was good, he ordered the mac and cheese. my friend and I ordered the Manager's Special from the lunch menu. 

Food was ehhhh.. literally. It lacked flavor, and spices. I didn't even finish my meal and that's saying a lot. I ordered my sons ice cream so he could have it before we left. The ice cream tasted like it had been stuffed in the back of the freezer and they had to pry it out of a snowmans hands to get a scoop for my son. It was so bad that my son didn't even finish it. 

My advice, save your money, go to the grocery store and make your own meal, you'll get better service, food and leftovers at home."}
{"text":"Appetizers good. Drink specials good. Dinner meh... My pasta was pretty bland."}
{"text":"I have gone here since I was a little girl. This place holds a lot of nostalgia for me! I love the setting, an old house filled with unique antiques. It makes for interesting conversation pieces. The food is good. I usually get the \"Managers Special\" which is pasta with your choice of 2 sauces. I always get half clam sauce and half mizithra cheese with brown butter. Yum! All of their dinners include fresh baked bread, salad or soup and a scoop of ice cream. The prices are great, but the service can be hit or miss. Great for large parties or kids! There's even a real trolley inside. The food is good, not great, but good. 4 stars for good food, great atmosphere and reasonable prices!"}
{"text":"Love the interior and atmosphere and wooden charm. The food was good and satisfying if you're craving some traditional Italian fare. Salad is basic. Got the Mizithra cheese with browned butter which is delicious and meat sauce which was good. Dessert is included and spumoni ice cream hit the spot.  Service was lacking and we felt we were in a corner where it was hard to get someone's attention and waitstaff sparingly came by."}
{"text":"This was my first time ever going to the old spaghetti factory.  The food was good and the service was really good.  We must have been there on a good day, because we got right in with no waiting."}
{"text":"We used to eat here often many years ago.  It was good then and they were always busy.  So, we were in the are last night and thought we'd give them a go again.  They were not busy at all for a Saturday night.  The staff were friendly enough, but a little too casual.  In my opinion this is no longer a fine dining destination but a pit stop for pasta.  The restaurant has lost its class. 
The food was a huge let down.  It was very bland and way over priced for the portions served.  

We wont be going back"}
{"text":"One year later and another birthday for Natalie at her favorite restaurant. We had another great time here. This time I had their chicken Alfredo, and a salad. Meal was very good, kids had their usual spaghetti. Wife had the penne pasta, and we all thought the food was very good. Service were spectacular, and gave all five kids a free ice cream. Thanks for the great time again."}
{"text":"I haven't eaten at The Old Spaghetti Factory for the longest time.  My last visit has to be at least 10 year ago.  We recently had lunch there on a Sunday and ordered from their lunch menu.  The prices are quite reasonable as it includes tea or coffee, salad or soup, and ice-cream.  I ordered a roast beef sandwich if I remember correctly.  Our order took a while ot arrive as we had a large group of people.  Our server kept us topped up on drinks while we waited, which was nice.  The roast beef in my sandwich was disappointing... it was quiteway over cooked and nearly not edible.  If the food had been good, I would have given it a four-star rating.  It's too bad."}
{"text":"Food is average. I ordered their classic spaghetti and meatballs with meat sauce. Spaghetti texture is good. Meat sauce taste like something I can cook easily. Meatball is too spicy for my taste. Service is poor. Booked supper for 9:00pm, we arrived on time and waited for 15 minutes before we get seated. The restaurant was half empty, I am not sure why we have to wait so long. Service was very rush. Server never greeted us. We ask for water, it came after the complimentary bread is serve. The water never got refilled until we asked. We order before the table next to us, and they got service way ahead before we do. Good came very slow. Has to ask for parmesan cheese twice for our pasta. Server keeps on changing and none of them stay more than 5 seconds at the table expect during initial ordering and billing. May come back here for their atmosphere, maybe for their food, but definitely not their service again."}
{"text":"Ok Prices but the worst food ever. its really shame  for a restaurant making spaghetti for the last 40 years.
Salad is just lettuce  with very cheap sauce."}
{"text":"Impressed and will be back!
Went in on a Friday night at about 4:30pm and got a table right away. When we left at about 6:00pm there was a wait at the door. 
We ordered a glass of white zenfendel; always a standard 8 Oz glass. Calamari was the best I have ever had. Had seafood linguini and the Alfredo sauce was awesome ...a bit of a smoky yet spice to it....very unique ...not just another white sauce. Loved it.  Plenty of seafood in the dish. We also ordered stuff mushroom ravioli also awesome. 
Meals include coffee dessert soup or salad. 
This area needed another choice for dinning that isn't over priced. I beleive they will be successful for a long time."}
{"text":"Our food was outstanding and delicious and our server was 5 stars!  However, the hostess that didn't greet us or smile was a disappointment.  All she did was walk to our table and toss the menu's on the table and walk away.   Obviously, she is not Customer service oriented.  Maybe she needs to dine at Olive Garden and observe how a proper hostess is supposed to interact with the customer's!  I give 2 stars just for the good food and Jim our server.  I spoke to the manager about the poor hostess.  Hopefully, she provided feedback to the unfriendly hostess.  Remember:

1.  Greet the guest's with a smile
2.  Allow the guest's to be seated before u hand out their menu's. Always hand menu's to the ladies first, starting with the eldest.  
3.  Explain any dinner specials and whom their server will be and tell them (with a smile) to enjoy their dinner and the server will be with them shortly."}
{"text":"Listen, the environment is awesome. I LOVED the furniture. It's been many years (16 maybe) since I have been to any Old Spaghetti Factory, so it was really like a new experience for me. 

Anywhoo, the staff were kind and super attentive. The waitress was amazeballs. She had an eagle-eye. We didn't want for anything while we were there, she predicted our every need. I can't remember her name :( or I'd give her a special shout out. (If you read this, and recall us complimenting you in your eagle-eye, please comment on this, so people know how fabulous you are.)

I had lobstah ravioli, and it was delectable! I would definitely do this again, and order that every time. Compliments to the chef(s)!!!

Thank you all for an awesome dining experience!!"}
{"text":"Not the worst, but by far not the best either. Service was very slow, food was bland, and experience was lacking. Will not return."}
{"text":"This was by far the worst experience in a restaurant setting yet. We are a party of 13 so we made a reservation for 6:30pm. Checked in and they were not ready for us until 7 pm. We are seated there are two pitchers of water but no glasses. We wait patiently and no one comes over so after 15 min I go to the hostess and ask if a server has been assigned to us. Almost 30 minutes before a server comes over to take our drink order, we ask for glasses for the water. The server says she will bring them over we are now ready to order. She takes the order and forgets to go around the whole table and walks away. Now keep in mind it is now 7:29 pm we have been at our table for 1/2 hour and still no cups for water all though the water is on the table. We chase the server down to tell her she didn't take all the orders, server takes the rest of the orders and walks away, still no glasses for water. I go back to the hostess and ask for a manager, a few minutes later the manager comes to the table as the server is dropping of drinks and the manager asks the server if everything is good. I speak up and say no it's NOT, I begin to tell him that it's unacceptable to be at a restaurant for more than 1/2 hour and not have anyone see if we have been helped or a server come over to take our order. We ask if our food is already made he says no we say cancel the order and give us our bill for the drinks. Manager says let me get you appetizers while you wait for your food. Seriously, you can't get anyone to take our order and you want to make us happy with appetizers \" no thank you\". I proceed to tell him we are leaving and I would like your regional managers number. I am in the industry and have been for over 15 years, you don't treat customers like this ever. It is a competative market and all we had to do was cross the mall and have dinner at Buffalo Wild wings.. to give you an idea how long everything took my husband and daughter were able to meet us for dinner. They were in Quartside when we were headed to The Old Spaghetti Factory."}
{"text":"I don't want to wax nostalgic here, but I have fond memories of a Spaghetti Factory from long ago.  Numerous trips to the library or art museum in Phoenix, followed by a trip to the this location.   In the early to mid 1980's I remember the Tempe location serving hungry college students 2 for 1 meal  specials on  Sunday afternoons.

In more recent years, this Phoenix location has been a family favorite, suitable for get-togethers, child friendly, centrally located.  

A few years ago, I would be giving a 4 star rating. My most recent visits have Spaghetti Factory at a solid 3.  Why, you ask?  Well, I'm happy to share!

Keep in mind the name of this restaurant:  SPAGHETTI Factory.  

The menu:  what was once an easy to navigate document is now overloaded with too many options.  Spaghetti is buried in the middle of the book.  

Let's face it folks, spaghetti is cheap. Keep the menu simple, with its namesake food easy to find.  

More frustrating is the lunch structure.  For years one could get their favorite spaghetti and sauce combos in a smaller quantities, with drink and spumoni inclusive, for a reduced rate.  Now, lunch options are salads or sandwiches, with a pasta option offered as a note at the top.  No drink or spumoni option, unless you buy the dinner size.  Why???  

Thank goodness they've kept their pasta sauces the same.  You can't go wrong with any of them- one of my favorites is the spaghetti with half meat sauce and half brown butter mizithra cheese.  Sublime!  The mushroom sauce is another tempting choice.  My husband loves the clam sauce, and my kids are all over the board.  

I like the addition of the option for steamed broccoli in large quantity- an excellent option for a large family gathering.  Salads are still crisp and cold, dressings still fresh, bread still warm and tasty.  I've ordered salad entrees, great quality and balance of flavors.  Really, no complaints about the food, but the food is not all there is to a good rating.

Combine the lack of menu focus and lost menu options with consistantly (last 4 visits) slow food service, and we move from a 4 to a 3.  Servers are friendly enough, but it seems that everyone is moving in slow motion, save for a couple managers and long-term servers, scurrying about.  

Just a little tightening up on service, plus a simplification of menu (bring back the lunch drink option), and I think we could hit the 4 star zone once again."}
{"text":"The place is new, opened around 2 months.

Food is good, I love the mizithra one, best spaghetti with butter and the cheese.

Service, everyone is friendly.

Good Food, awesome prices, and excellent service! One of my fav places.."}
{"text":"While this may seem like a familiar old friend for those from the States it's just a little different.  The food is close to what you would expect from any of the other OSF south of the boarder.  Prices are a bit high, standard tomato sauce is around $15, which is a bit high considering OSF was always known as the inexpensive pasta place.  Note you do get salad, bread, pasta, and ice cream but then again that was always their deal.  I will continue to come back and it will continue to be just a little different."}
{"text":"We had dinner here last night. It was wonderful. The food was good, albeit my son said his chicken was a but on the dry side. Our waitress could not have been more attentive. Prices were reasonable, and we were all quite full. I'm sorry I can't find one in Houston"}
{"text":"This place is very nolstagic. It used to be two houses, then they combined them, then it became a furniture store, and still bears those marks, made apparent by the shag furniture still in the window up front. Nice touch. It's supposed to be haunted but our waitress informed us that she hasn't seen anything and says the building is settling. In the women's bathroom, you do feel like you're being watched, every step of the way. =)

We have sat in the trolley and in the booths. Bring a flashlight because it's way too dark. The menu resembles a newspaper. If you get overwhelmed by the menu, remember that you can always get spaghetti. We brought extra money just to get the Italian sodas in the Spaghetti Factory brand glasses. That way we got to keep the two glasses and have a souve. Authentic spumoni can be had here."}
{"text":"Gross! I don't know if they use prego or ragu but ragu is better!  I'm from ny.  I know Italian food. This was discustingggggg. Sauce all salt. Chicken all salt and not grilled. More like precooked frozen chicken. Chicken parm nasty!!! Bread hard to cut or bite! Place had bugs flying around. Shrimp has she'll on it. Salad wilted. Everything was garbage. If you're from the ghetto or very illegal alien You might enjoy because you dont know better. I'm still pooping 2 days later .NO ONE I was with liked their meal. 8 people!!-! Meatballs fkn gross. Nothing fresh. Nothing quality . Cheap food..you ask for cheese on a dish that comes with cheese *on the menu* and they pointed at a cheese shaker like in a pizzeria!!! Really? I wanted to barf. I'll never go back. They need to close"}
{"text":"We love the ambience inside. However, the quality was not worth going back. I had chicken Parmesan and my husband had the Italian sausage spaghetti.  We tried to find something we liked - only thing was the bread.  Salad was a tad brown and our wine was out of the box (the bartender did disclose that though). We will be sticking to carrabas as we have never gone wrong with any meal."}
{"text":"I've seen this place downtown for years and finally went for a work-related holiday lunch with a party of 10.  Now I've heard rave reviews for years, but I have to say I was a bit disappointed with the food.  The server was friendly and efficient, and though we waited a bit for our food, they kept the hot bread coming, which was quite tasty.   I had the Italian Sausage sandwich.  It was a few small pieces of sausage, average flavor, on what looked and tasted like a somewhat large hotdog bun that had been on the counter for a while.  I was still hungry afterwards.  Now, I can go to a deli and get a bigger sausage sub with way more sausage for the same price and end up taking half home for later.  I will say that it was not at all expensive and that combined with the decent service is why I gave 3 stars."}
{"text":"Love this place, the food is good and great prices! The ambiance is fun and friendly."}
{"text":"Not too often do so many things go wrong.  My first 1.5 star rating.  First, given we were at an organized event (50+ people) you'd think management would staff appropriately.  One poor guy at our table didn't get his drink for 35 minutes.  My wife had to send back two drink, (old fashioned (...who messes that up?) and cosmo (tasted like fruit punch).  I had the godfather and thankfully first one was great. The next were not.  I spoke to the manager (young Asian girl no more than 19) after the first incident and she looked clueless.  When I went to get my buddies drink (got up from table, waitress was nonexistent because she had little help) she was behind the bar with another bartender running around without a clue.  We never got an apology let alone a free drink.  6 of the 10 people's drinks at our table were grossly messed up.  Too bad, we had hoped manager would have at least stepped up.  We paid a TON for this event and couldn't even enjoy it.  Bet they won't read this review or do anything about it.  BTW the Godfather=scotch and amaretto!"}
{"text":"Was actually thinking of giving this place a second chance to eat at tonight. But thanks to yelp reviews it seemed to not chance a year later.
Food was not that good. Service was so horrible, I couldn't take the lady bad service anymore so they had another waiter and he was just as shitty so the manager ended up waiting on us. As we was leaving the parking lot the waitress was outside smoking a cigarette ON A BUSY NIGHT, explains why she never came around our table we had to keep getting up to get other servers. I noticed people at the other table in our area was just as frustrated."}
{"text":"The food is inconsistent. We came on a week night evening and the food was disappointing - terribly salty and tasted like a microwave dinner, however on a weekend during lunch the food was great. Also, we were turned away on another occasion because of some unplanned building maintenance. I think it's better to close rather than turn people away."}
{"text":"We were staying at the Novotel across the street so we just walked across the street.Really crowded place when we went for dinner so of course it would be expected that service was a little slow.The food was really good though.I enjoyed it and it came with ice cream.I really liked how the place was decorated.It's a big place too.I think this a chain restaurant but we don't have it in New York sadly."}
{"text":"Interesting decor, colorful, clean.  It had been about 40 years since we ate at OSF.  Staff are efficient, friendly and reasonably attentive but the food is not good.  It has nothing to do with the chef but probably the recipes.  Not good flavors, not what you would expect from traditional plates you have eaten elsewhere.  We had Lasagna, poor or lack of flavor and Chicken Alfredo almost tasteless and the chicken was grisly. I did well to have eaten a third of it because I was extremely hungry!  Lots of salt and pepper couldn't pick it up.  I will never return, there are too many good places to eat here in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times over the past year since my bf lives so close by. We both like it, especially him since he loves cheesy, carby Italian dishes lol. The interior is absolutely MAGICAL -- it looks like a carnival with a carousel, giant version of toys, fake phone booth, etc. It's a perfect place to take your kids because they will not get bored! Lots of families come here, so it does get pretty loud.

They also have an associated bar with a bar menu and an outdoor patio for the warmer months.

We got the combos a few times with a salad to start (very sad salad... small, more lettuce than anything else, too much sauce), a main (many to choose from, including vegetarian options), and ice cream to finish (recommend spumoni flavor = vanilla, choco, pistachio). The combo is pretty good $ value and is available for lunch and dinner. The mains are all pastas if I recall correctly and everything has a fair amount of cheese.

Overall the menu is very cheese and carb heavy, not super healthy. But if you do want healthier options, they do have decent full-sized salads you can get as a main. I recommend the Esplanade Salad ($12.50) with grilled chicken breast (+$5.99). It's a filling salad since there's also candied pecans and goat cheese.

Complimentary bread comes with every meal -- very soft and fresh. You can ask for olive oil and BV if you don't want butter.

There's nothing questionable about the food quality or dishes, but also not wow-worthy. But you will leave feeling full... Very full. Come for the cool interior design and cheat day menu!

Food 3/5
Value 3.5/5
Service 4/5 -- very friendly
Space 5/5 -- beautiful interior, large space, great for groups and family gatherings"}
{"text":"This restaurant hosted the Murder Mystery dinner thing recently.  We bought tickets through Groupon.  There were only three menu choices available, but I won't hold such details against Old Spaghetti Factory.  All I will rate is the food and service.  The Murder Mystery was a different company.

The salad that was presented was sad.  Truly sad.  This pathetic (and SMALL!) thing with a creamy dressing (and we weren't even allowed to choose the dressing!) is what gives salads a bad name.  Even my wife, who loves salads, didn't want it.  

There was bread service, and the bread was fine.  A crusty sourdough.  I liked it.  Then the main course.  I got the \"spaghetti vesuvius\".  Supposed to be a spicy spaghetti with a rose sauce (tomato and cream), chicken and sausage and peppers.  The portion was very small (like a lunch special).  The flavor was fine.  Nothing special but fine.  It looked more appetizing than the salad, but still was sort of sad.  You'd think there was a food shortage or something, and we have this little portion that looks out of place with the size of the plate.  Even some fancy presentation would have helped (like you sometimes see in fancy places where there's not much food on the plate but they do something ornate in hopes you won't notice).

If the pasta hadn't been reasonably good (flavor) I would have to go with one star here.  The salad was pathetic.  The main course looked sad and impoverished.  And the dessert was this tiny scoop of neopolitan ice cream.  Emphasis on \"tiny\".  Service was reasonable.  Nothing extraordinary, but fine.  That and the taste of the pasta saved them from one star.

Normally I take half a meal home.  This one, which included dessert (which I seldom get) was barely enough to satisfy me.  I had no leftover.

In summary, I'd pass them by.  There are other Italian restaurants that have better food, and more of it."}
{"text":"I was taken here by my parents when I was...not a child but a youth. I've always been a huge fan of spaghetti, it's my go to menu choice and if a restaurant has it (whether or not it's an Italian restaurant), that's what I will order. So obviously going to a place called the \"Old Spaghetti Factory\" was definitely right up my alley. 

Boy, was I knocked off my feet! I couldn't imagine going to a more perfect restaurant to satisfy my love of spaghetti. Not only that but you get this amazing warm bread with garlic butter (they have regular but you won't touch it, trust me) and your pasta comes with a choice of soup or salad, a generous portion for both, and ice cream at the end of the meal. What could be more perfect than that?

I always get the spaghetti with rich meat sauce, this one is the best one! I've tried the others and it just doesn't stack up against this winner. And I just can't fathom eating anything else but spaghetti here, I've seen others eating the lasagna or fetticini or whatever. While the lasagna isn't bad (my mother has ordered it)...nothing beats having spaghetti at the Old Spaghetti Factory. DUH!

For starter, I usually get a salad, if you're not a dressing lover, ask for it on the side; I also love their minestrone soup and the clam chowder is actually good. The servers are amazingly friendly and range from the young university student to the older more mature server that has been there for a long time, both are equally as friendly and gracious. I always write a comment card because I love being served by friendly people who always have a smile and make me feel important.

Many people think that place is a tourists trap and yes I guess they're right but I still love it. From sitting in the carousel to the streetcar or the telephone booth/elevator (which you need to reserve), I love it all and I will always come back here, even after I've dined at swanky restaurants in different cities. This place is like Swiss Chalet, reliable, good food that is always the right price and a place you can go to when you're in a pinch for ideas."}
{"text":"Went here for my best friends birthday. I absolutely adored the old-fashioned decor and chandeliers hanging from the ceiling. I told myself I'd be going back to get one of everything on their menu because there is so much variety and I couldn't decide what I wanted to get.

I decided to settle on the spaghetti with mushroom tarragon sauce. I thought I made a mistake because I was expecting more mushrooms and less sauce covering my plate! However, the cheese was the best part of the meal, as was the bread!

The entire ambiance of the restaurant is definitely intimate, with plenty of fixtures and low lighting around the tables, it definitely hit the nail on the head with that one. What I also appreciated was that while the restaurant also has a bar, it's completely separated from the rest of the restaurant. 

I'd definitely recommend checking the place out if you're in the area and just want to grab a quick bite or have dinner. It's pretty great and the prices are also fair. We all enjoyed ourselves and I'm sure we'll eventually be back one day."}
{"text":"Not the best experience we've had here but it was ok. 

The thing that bothered me the most about the meal was the starter salad, it was brown and limp.

Everything else in the meal was as expected. The waiter wasn't super attentive but we did just fine without him. The only thing we really needed him for was drink refills, the check, and to-go containers. 

PLEASE FIX YOUR SALAD ISSUE AND PROVIDE A FRESH PRODUCT OR STOP SERVING SALAD AS AN OPTION."}
{"text":"Gotta leave another review. I like this place. This time I ordered clam sauce trying to avoid meat.  Had 2 small clams. I searched and searched.  Taste bad. Not sure how its made but tasted like it came out bag with processed or powered mix.  Sent it back got my fav meatballs. That tasted great. But as soon as I walked in the door I had upset belly and ran for the bathroom.  Who knows what causes that but it seemed like strange occurance so soon after the meal. Draw you own conclusions"}
{"text":"We always make bets on the way to the Spaghetti Factory whether or not the service is going to be crappy or not.  Sometimes it's great; sometimes it's downright awful.  But that mizithra cheese keeps us coming back for more.  

 We got there at 7pm on a Sunday night.  There were a few girls working at the front desk and one of them asks how many are in our party.  We tell her '3' and then she disappears.  Minutes go by.  I think her shift might have ended and she took off.  Who knows.  So now another girl asks us how many and then tells us it'll be 10 minutes.  I can sense that my fiance is getting irritated so I remind him that this was his idea.  We go sit down to wait.  Not even two minutes go by and they call us.  I don't know where they learned how to estimate time, but at least it was in our favor.  Everything else went off without a hitch; the food was delicious (you gotta know what to order though---we always order the same thing...chicken marsala with the mizithra cheese spaghetti and the eggplant parm) and our server brought applesauce and milk for our toddler.  Which reminds me-- it's a great family place; we are always relieved to be at a place where there are other kids and babies being noisy.  Less chance of us being the ones making the scene or anyone noticing our toddler flinging her applesauce off the spoon.  Sorry to the people sitting next to us, by the way.  In summary--it's good, it's cheap, it's a classic, it's family friendly; it's weird; the service is spotty, but in the end...we'll go back."}
{"text":"The Old Spaghetti Factory is close to my Company's Canadian Mother Ship (Shell Centre) and is a convenient place for a fairly quick and no-nonsense Lunch. I've been here several times over the years and have neither been disappointed or wowed. Some might argue that this is the definition of consistency and that's what some people want when they visit a new City. That's fine for Lunch, but in a City such as Calgary, there's too many good place to eat within a decent walk for me want to come here for Dinner. 

The other trick on business trips is trying not to eat too much at a single sitting. After all, there's work to do in the PM. The Old Spaghetti Factory can certainly provide a big meal, but they also offer a soup and salad combination that has worked well for me."}
{"text":"I love The Old Spaghetti Factory and this one was pretty good. Server was friendly and efficient.  I ordered the Manager Special and my pasta with brown butter was too dry, but everything else was okay. I would go here again."}
{"text":"Umpteen times checked in here, that means its good :)
It's a very good value for the money (about $30 for 2 people). You get fresh baked bread, salad or soup, entree, drink and spumoni. For me, i get salad with gf dressing, gf pasta, i have to skip all the other stuff but its fine by me, that is alot of food. 
I set up to get text messages for deal, they normally run one on Wednesday and Sundays. Buy one get one free. You really can't beat that. 
We recommend Old Spaghetti Factory."}
{"text":"This is my first review of this restaurant but I have been here many times. I have always had a great experience and have never been disappointed with the food I have ordered. This location is my preferred one due to its location. The building is full of character and the light rail stop being right in front is a plus since my 6 year old son loves riding it. Yes, it is not the best Italian food ever but it is consistently good and the value is solid."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a cheap, quick meal, you can't really go wrong with The Old Spaghetti Factory.

The food itself is nothing special.  You're paying less than $15 to eat a pretty decent amount of food.  The atmosphere is very nice and unique, but I do have to agree with some people when they say that guests can be loud.  Our server was very nice and checked up on us often.

Overall, you get what you pay for here.  If you want to go out on a budget, you can come here."}
{"text":"Marsala spaghetti-nuff said!"}
{"text":"Fourteen people celebrated my daughter's 45th Birthday. We had chicken fettuccini, sausage/meat ball spaghetti, shrimp scampi and more. Everyone was very happy with food and drinks. The service was superb. The dinner is served with soup or salad and ice cream with no extra charge. First restaurant in Phoenix with quality food and service that we visited.  Definitely will be our go to \"celebrate\" place."}
{"text":"I live 5 minutes from this place and haven't eaten here in 3 years. Nuff said."}
{"text":"Atmosphere, friendly staff, and comfort food make for an enjoyable meal with friends and family. 

Meals are served with delicious warm bread and soft butter to compliment your dish. The pizzas are fantastic too!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a great valued dinner or lunch with large portions and great service, this is your spot! You will never go to a more unique restaurant in your life and it is highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in this Toronto OSF when I visited in 2006. They have you wait in the bar area until your seat is called. Nice area with a lounge feel to it. Finally we are called and seated. The food was honestly decent, but nothing amazing. The place was jam packed on a Friday night. It is a family style place, but also had a few tables with couples out for a night of Italian-Canadian cuisine.

The sauce tasted like an upscale chef boyardee, the servings were big and the waiter was attentive. All in all I think its a decent stop, but not a must, when visiting Toronto."}
{"text":"Service is ok. Most waitresses are young and cute.  Food is expensive.

It all tastes ok.   Spaghetti shouldn't cost so much.

Nice environment and decor inside the dining room.

I won't return unless I win the lottery.  It's ok but hella pricey. How can people afford to eat at places like this?  We need tax increases if people can afford this."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is extremely nice. However the service was terrible. 
Had to hunt My server down and eventually asked for the manager.
I enjoy the Old Spaghetti Factory nationwide, just not this ONE.
The one in Phoenix is way better! With better service! Larger portions, and better \"old italian\" style atmosphere."}
{"text":"We had the spaghetti and meatballs and chicken parmigiana. The sauce and meatballs were bland. The best part of the meal was the bread."}
{"text":"Quick seating, service was average, food was bland. I'll opt for another Italian restaurant next time."}
{"text":"If you come here expecting it to be like authentic Italian food made by a mama and grandmama from Italy, then you may be disappointed.  Haha I know sounds wierd, I am basically saying don't expect too high, and you will be fine. But as a family eatery with prices to not hurt the wallet while you drag kids and grandparents out, OSF really is decent.  I have neither kids nor grandparents, but I managed to see it and enjoy it, for what it is.

Maybe its because I always get the same thing, the manager's favorite, with Mizithra cheese and clam sauce.  Then I mix it all together and I am a happy happy person.  I cannot get this anywhere else.  Now I am not saying you go and try this, I only know a handful of people that like it the way I do, but I will repeat, OSF is the only place I can get it at.  So from 3 stars I give it 4.

Now the bread usually is good, but this location can get inconsistent.  The salad is just busy work till you get your food.  Nothing to talk about there. I have tasted food from others' plate, like lasagna and parmigiana chicken.  They were alright.  Sometimes tasty, other times just blah. The little dish of ice cream you get at the end is perfect. 

I really can understand the lower ratings on this place, its not really consistent.  But I do like it and enjoy my dish.  I have gotten lucky with service, no complaints there.  Overall a 3.5 place, rounded up to 4."}
{"text":"Ahhh this old relic of a restaurant is still around alive and well with all its own unique collection of relics. 
Came here with my parents, aunt, uncle and I for a late dinner and we were all satisfied with our choices. I chose the lasagna w/ Caesar salad and I love em! Love how they cook it in a dish straight in the oven so heats very well. 
Been coming here with family since I was little and will continue to do so!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time this year - and I totally understand why there is a 3 star rating!

The whole restaurant wins 10/10 for setting a family mood, bringing the carnival/circus theme to life and making the best background for Instagram pics! We went on a Saturday night, so a lot of birthdays were being celebrated ... the servers sing it in a opera kind of voice!! Super cool and really adds onto the whole vibe! 

Our server was absolutely amazing, she frequently checked in on us, explained the menu thoroughly and fortunately did not hesitate to change my order 10 mins in after we ordered ... super thankful they were able to change it. Again, adds to the whole experience and really made it worth it. 


The food ... well there's only SO MUCH you can do with spaghetti. I don't get why people are bashing on the quality - it was decent spaghetti at a decent price. We also did order the ribs and they were also decent, but I do not regret the amount paid because of all the other contributing factors. 

I had the managers special - 2 sauces (I think it was the brown butter sauce and marinara)
The other is the pork ribs with marinara spaghetti 

I also orders a side of shrimp - not my favourite probably would never order again. 

If you're looking for amazing food that'll feed your soul, this probably isn't the best place for you but if you're looking for a great family date/night out ... defiantly a must do!"}
{"text":"Restaurant intéressant grand mais un peu brillant.Le service est moyen, il faut faire attention quand arrive l'addition il peut malheureusement se tromper.Sinon le repas dans l'ensemble s'est bien passée.Donc aucun regret"}
{"text":"3 stars is sufficient..... I feel the prices are on the high side...Yes, I know it  comes with a small salad, bread, a drink (iced tea or milk is included, but not soda....go figure), & a small cup of ice cream, but it still seems a little pricey to me. 
I felt like the portions are all not that big.  I love the Mizithra Cheese...So yummy! But there were a few times where I felt like they didn't really give you enough on the spaghetti.... I felt a little gipped.  
If you really want Italian Food, then go to Oregano's instead!...NOW we're talkin'!"}
{"text":"My first time there today was pretty awesome! Short wait time with no reservation great customer service! Food was great wish I would have ordered a bigger portion of pasta though!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Fresh pasta and great service! All the food is delicious and great prices. 3 course meal that includes bread, soup or salad, entree and ice cream for around $14. Can't beat that!"}
{"text":"Great night out but be warned, policy has changed about seating yourself & eating in the bar area. Not a fan of that. The wait on this Sunday was 45 minutes, we went before a show at Comerica Theatre and heard a couple of others talk about going so maybe that is the reason it was so busy. You used to be able to by-pass the wait and seat yourself in the bar if space allowed, now it is part of the dining seating as too many whiners complained. lol We didn't know about the change and sat ourselves anyway, Michael helped us this evening, he was waiting on a large party but still gave us excellent service! The Mizithra & Brown Butter pasta is my absolute favorite, a must try! I love their pesto salad dressing and ending the meal with spumoni. I'm not so sure I would wait the 45 minutes, I get that they want you to wait it out and drink in the bar but that's not my thing, if I'm sitting there, I'm eating! Making a reservation is a must for a large party but for just two people, not sure they do it. I guess I'll be looking into that in the future."}
{"text":"We were completely ignored and left!  We walked in past 2 female employees sitting at a booth and then past 2 male employees sitting in a booth, and sat at the bar nearby in eyesight of the male employees.   One of the male employees was a manager bc he was telling the other one how much money he was going to start him at and when his orientation was going to be..  He finished with the employee, got up, walked past us w/o acknowledging our existence into the back.  Then he came out, walked past us again, talked to the 2 female employees and walked BACK BY US into the back w/o a Word!  We sat there ignored for another 10 minutes, and finally got up and left!  These employees Do Not give a crap about customers!  We went to Carraba's where the employees actually care."}
{"text":"I have to start off with, I received good customer service, which is key. 
I had the shrimp Alfredo....good.  Just depends on your taste. I loved the complementary bread and butter. The salad was not bad. And the meal came with your choice of three desserts. The vanilla ice cream was good. The Shirley temple was also good. Not many restaurants get my Shirley right:)"}
{"text":"The Spaghetti Factory has been around for many years.  Most people I know remember going there as kids, but even now it's fun.  The whole place is mostly a novelty, because truthfully their spaghetti isn't anything you can't make at home.

However, the experience of coming to this place is worth it in itself.  The dining area is enormous, includes a carousel and an old fashioned street car, which has tables you can sit and eat at.  Many of the 2-person tables are built on old Singer sewing machines, and the wheel/pedal mechanism is spins.

Usually you have to wait to sit down, and the timing depends.  On Saturdays, you're not allowed to make reservations from 5-9pm, and the wait is usually about an hour long.  Often they exaggerate the wait time just to make sure you don't get pissy, but that's not always the case, so don't count on it.

And yes.  Ice cream comes free at the end of the meal."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place only has a 3 star average. The food is always fantastic and served quickly. Before your entree, you have a choice of soup or salad. They also bring bread, yum! At the end the bring you ice cream (spumoni or vanilla). All these items are included in the meal, making it a great deal. The atmosphere is beautiful and elegant with many chandeliers and luxurious booths. There's also a cool old trolley that you can sit in for dinner. They have a nice patio that overlooks a water feature. This place is located in the Chandler Fashion Center, making it a very convenient location. Then you can go shopping after lunch or dinner! Even though this place has been here for a few years now, I am happy to finally have one in Chandler. If you're looking for a nice, but affordable Italian restaurant, this is the place."}
{"text":"Where would you go for your last meal?  

No, I'm not at San Quentin.  Last meal in Canada.

We were on our last day of our 9 day Canadian Rockies trip, just before our 4pm flight from Calgary back to SFO.  Needed some lunch spot with quick service, no leftovers and a semblance of quality.  The last ruled out most fast food restaurants in the area.  

Dressed in shorts, T-shirt and open toed sandals.  That would rule out all the classy restaurants!

Wife had always vetoed going to the OSF at San Pedro square before shows in downtown San Jose.  That and the Redwood City branch are the only OSFs within 30 miles of our Sunnyvale residence.  

There happened to be an OSF right outside the Eau Claire shopping mall.  Went in at noon on a Friday, and went up the stairs and were seated immediately.

Old style spacious restaurant, with colored glass, large windows, nice wooden furniture and wooden walls with ambiance of old times.  

While we read the menu, server comes with heated bread and water. Sour dough bread, not my favorite, but when you're hungry you aren't particular.

Wife orders the $10.95 CAD lasagna lunch, and I the $10.35 CAD spaghetti with meat sauce.
Meals come with coffee/tea, soup/salad and spumoni ice cream.

Wife gets the minestrone soup, which is pretty hearty, with pieces of potatoes, beans, pasta, and tomatoes.  My house salad comes with carrot strips over iceberg lettuce, with thousand island dressing on the side.  

As soon as we are done with the appetizers, the main courses come.  Now that's service.  

Wife likes her lasagna, which is actually a bigger portion than the spaghetti, and comes with layers of pasta over ground beef and pork sauce.

The spaghetti marinara meat sauce has particles of ground beef, onions, garlic, tomatoes and is thick for the amount of pasta you get.  

Doesn't take long for us to finish our meals, as we wolf down the food like it is our last meal!

The spumoni is  a very generous blend of chocolate, cherry and pistachio.  Welcome relief on a 79 degree day.  No nuts or candies within the ice cream.

We get out of there after tip and tax for less than $20 USD, a bargain in expensive downtown Calgary, where you have to pay by the hour to park, and can lose your shirt if you don't watch where you go eat!

OSFs only in 14 primarily western states and western Canada.  Half of all OSFs in California. You folks on the Atlantic Coast and Gulf of Mexico are SOL!"}
{"text":"We arrived too late to be seated and were quickly told as much the second we walked through the door.

But we were hungry and so very pleased to find out they would let us order take out. 

The food was prepared fast and tasted good. It was my first time eating at this chain so I'm not sure how it normally tastes. I really liked the garlic aioli that came with my pasta. The salad was tasty.

The manager Adam Wilcox, accommodated some of our party's particular requests.

They have gluten-free options - make sure you order them specifically even if you are ordering off the gluten-free menu."}
{"text":"Came for a date night with my wife and was hoping to have some great food. Service was good and the waiter was very attentive. 

We ordered baked ravioli as an appetizer which was the highlight of the meal. 

Salads were disappointing. My wife ordered the house salad and commented that the dressing was a little watery. My caeser was over dressed and came garnished with tomatoes. I felt we both got the cheap end of the lettuce as well. 

Entrées were also disappointing as the ratio of sauce to pasta was either too much or too little and both poorly seasoned. The Italian sausage tasted like a breakfast sausage as well. Good news is that my diet coke was good and my wife enjoyed her Italian soda."}
{"text":"Spaghetti is one of my faves so I was super excited to try this place out...looks like I'll have  to save some of that excitement for another place. The interior looked pretty awesome and the people were nice enough.

I ordered the garlic mizithra and it was...okay. I never had it before so I asked our waitress about it - she said if I was a cheese lover, then I'd love this spaghetti. Speaking as a true cheese lover, I did not love this - it was like they either put too much butter or not enough cheese. 

The best part of my dining experience was my drink - ordered a strawberry vanilla italian soda and it was yum. Wish I had more to say but that's pretty much it..."}
{"text":"New look, same old game. I have to start by saying that the exterior remodel is gorgeous!!! So total kudos for that. Unfortunately, that's were the excitement ended. The last time I recall eating at the Old Spaghetti Factory was at the Tempe location in elementary school. As an adult, the bells and whistles of the decor fall flat quickly. This restaurant is cute for sure, but attention to cleanliness has not been paid. Even after a huge remodel! There were dead bugs in the busted out faux stained glass in our booth. Their price point is very good, so I didn't expect the world for a three course meal, but it was sad, sad, sad. Salad consisted of iceberg and croutons, nothing else. The \"fresh baked\" bread was hard and had an aroma that I can only equate to bleach. The pasta with meat sauce was poorly plated, just slopped on. It was completely edible, but I could have made better at home with a jar of sauce and some extra veggies. Having some ice cream or spumoni included in the meal was nice. It tasted like something from the grocery store, but at least it existed. 
I don't want to hate this restaurant. It is an AZ staple. The food is passable and the service is good. I had just hoped for more seeing the nice, new facade. I will not return nor would I encourage others to do so. The Old Spaghetti Factory maybe has an inch over Olive Garden in the presentation of the restaurant, but would be a downgrade on food quality. And that comparison is sad on all fronts."}
{"text":"Being new to Arizona, we decided to try 2 new restaurants for our anniversary. This was our lunch and it was fantastic. We had an incredible meal. The restaurant is very interesting with an old train dining car in the seating area. 

We had an appetizer of garlic cheese bread which was some of the best that we have ever eaten. Our entrees consisted of their lasagna and the Italian meatloaf with a side of pasta with the mizritha cheese and browned butter. Very rich and heavy but oh, so good. We didn't have the included dessert because we were too full. 

The service was excellent and very personable. Everything was as ordered and was prompt.

When we have friends and family come out from the mid-west, we will certainly be taking them here to eat."}
{"text":"The banquet service at Spaghetti Factory is less than stellar. There were about 90 people in the room but they only had one waitperson taking drink orders. We had the sangria and it seemed to be made with concentrated fruit punch. When they did pass out the bread, there was one loaf per table of 10 people. At one point the waiter dropped a loaf of bread on someone at our table and still served it to another table! The dressing on the lettuce only salad had a watered down ranch dressing of some sort. The main entrees were ok, but a little small and flavorless. The single scoop of ice cream was forgettable. Getting our check paid took forever and most guests were gone by the time it was completed. If I was basing my opinion of Spaghetti Factory on this single visit, there would not be a reason to ever go back."}
{"text":"In five bullet points:

*Good service. The waiter was attentive, and delivery was awfully quick. Their decor is also kinda tasteful too.
*Really bland food. The menu is one of the shallowest I've seen from a real chain restaurant in years. The minestrone in particular had an issue, being spiked with some spice that way overpowered the flavor and made it horrid. The toasted ravioli appetizer was better than their \"signature\" cheese-butter pasta.
*In hindsight, should have gone to CPK or somewhere else instead -- if you want real Italian, there are local and better chain places from which to get it -- Olive Garden (of which there is one across Chandler Blvd, north of the mall) and RigaTony's both come to mind. This is a restaurant for large families that need cheap, fast food. (This is probably why their meals are \"complete\" meals.)
*The previous occupant of the OSF space was a restaurant called Garduno's, featuring Mexican food. They did better at food than OSF. 
*How has this chain not only been in business for 42 years but expanded throughout the West and into select markets east of that? (St. Louis, Indy, Minneapolis, Louisville)"}
{"text":"Really really awesome dining experience here. I ordered the Angel Hair Pomodoro and left the cheese off so it was vegan. SO. GOOD. The fresh basil was the highlight, pasta was perfect, and that alone makes it 5 stars. 

However ... The best part of dinner aside from the food was our server, Alyssa. She was attentive, familiar with what was vegan on the menu (!!!!!) and always making sure our drinks were filled up. Definitely ask for her when you come! I will when I go back for sure. It's always a good dining experience when the staff is as helpful and kind as the food is delicious. 

This was an A+ experience. Very happy."}
{"text":"Been dining at the OSF for over 25 yrs. I went with my folks back in Sacramento and have been a fan ever since. From California to Washington where we frequented the Seattle and Tacoma locations for years and on to Phoenix, I have always been satisfied. Where else can you go for decent Italian at their prices. The food is consistently fine, although I am embarrassed to admit that I have never ordered anything other than the \" Meat Lovers Special\" after all these years. Just spaghetti with marinara and a couple of meatballs and Italian sausage. try it, it's great. The wife always orders the spinach tortellini with Alfredo and the kids order off the kids menu. The atmosphere, although varying from location to location is enjoyable. The kids love sitting in the trolley, give it a shot. maybe I am not saying much, but it beats the Olive Garden any day of the week. The service can be spotty, but keep the bread coming and I am happy. Went recently for my 9 year olds B Day dinner ( His Request ) and we all had a great time. The service was excellent and the meal ended with a complimentary piece of cake for my boy and enthusiastic singing from the staff. What more could you ask for. Great job OSF !"}
{"text":"I visited the old spaghetti factory for the first time and was very impressed with the building itself. It's huge and a historical vibe. The food was good and the staff was very nice. There was a 45 min. wait to be seated so be prepared to be here for a couple hrs. It maybe is a little understaffed for the amount of people that eat here. I will give them a second chance someday soon."}
{"text":"Came on a Sunday late afternoon - in a nutshell - whacky decor, friendly waiters, decent value..

The value - decent.  Kids meals were about $8 including a drink, an appy, and bottomless garlic bread.  Pretty standard though I didn't find the pasta to be that phenomenal (then again, it's a kids meal).  The adult meals are pricier (we opted for the $20 seafood linguine) and some spaghetti with Mizithra cheese ($15), but again with bread, appy, and coffee/tea included.

The food - quality was mixed.  Minestrone soup appy was nice and not overly salty, whereas the side salad was drenched in running dressing.  The garlic bread was incredible.  The seafood linguine also was a nice surprise - I'm not a pasta person but this really hit the spot.  However, the spaghetti with Mizithra cheese was insanely salty and not edible - that thing should come with a warning label.  In fairness, we were offered a couple of times to swap for something else if anything wasn't to our liking, so that was nice.

The service was also touch and go.  The waitress was friendly but very obviously overloaded - she came by rarely and when she did it was to very quickly throw down some food before jumping away to cater to another table.  I sense she had too many tables on the go.  Not bad, but not great.

The kids loved it though - so we'll probably come back for a birthday or other occasion.  Not a place I would probably visit again if it wasn't for the kids though."}
{"text":"Great food and fun atmosphere!
Highly recommend chicken parmigiana."}
{"text":"This old fashioned spot has been a favorite for years! I love the decor and the food is really good! The garlic cheese bread is to die for! Finish the meal off with a free scoop of vanilla ice cream or sherbet!"}
{"text":"The Old Spaghetti Factory has such a fun atmosphere.  We've gone twice and both times were sat in these booths that were like little rooms.  I loved it!  

It's a really great place for kids, especially with these little booth rooms.  The food didn't really leave an impression on me, I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing though, it can't all be good."}
{"text":"Went during their anniversary celebration.  The building definitely has some character.  But I also felt overwhelmed as if it was a labyrinth of Italian food - but I also understand its been their for a good amount of time so that has no bearing on the star rating.  Anyways. Service was really lacking here.  Ordered a beer when we sat down and didn't get it until after the appetizer.  Got the artichoke dip.  It was good but the value for what we paid wasn't worth it. Free bread was good. Nice and warm and tasty.  Entrees came and were good too.  Pasta cooked well.  Got the brown butter with cheese, very tasty. Everyone else seemed to enjoy their food as well.  When server brought entrees said shed be back to refill water glasses, that didn't happen until desserts came......., so why even come? Not only that but our cheese dispenser was empty when we sat down, was told by runner that he would bring a new one, waited for 5 min, then I just got up and took it from another table. 

Not sure if it was just bc of the specials they were running and thus slowing down service but I would go back bc of the price point of the food. But if the service was the same I'd probably not come."}
{"text":"We went to the OSF last night before the Suns game and it was another great experience. I love that it's on the light rail path so that you can hop off, eat, and get back on and head downtown. The service is always friendly and you always get a hearty meal at a good price! The hot out of the oven sourdough bread is the best!! If anything come for the bread."}
{"text":"We went here for some pasta as DH had a craving for it!  There is lots of parking in the Marlborough Mall parking lot (a big plus) and we were seated right away. DH ordered the french onion soup and I had the minestrone soup.  BTW my DH is in the food business and he hates restaurants that cut corners and use cheap ingredients.  No problems with that here!  He was happy with his soup as the cheese was plentiful, of good quality and delicious!  My minestrone looked homemade and it was good, too.  DH ordered the spaghetti and meatballs and I had the chicken club sandwich with fries.  The fries had just the right amount of crunchiness on the outside and were tender on the inside.  The sandwich was excellent as was the spaghetti and meatballs.  We ate two orders of their sourdough bread with butter, which was included in the price of our meals.  There was no charge for the second iced tea ordered.  All in all, the food was good and very filling.  The server was attentive and did an excellent job of taking care of our requests.  The restaurant was fairly busy on a Saturday afternoon around 1:30 p.m., but was not overly crowded or noisy.  DH seldom gives any restaurant a 10/10, but neither one of us could find any fault with the Old Spaghetti Factory so we gave it a 10/10 with a promise to go back soon!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and the first time I came I wasn't a fan however..everybody deserves a second chance right!? I ordered both times the Spaghetti with Browned Butter And Mizithra Cheese and the second time around I could not stop eating the spaghetti after my first bite. 

It had the right amount of cheese, the brown butter sauce was so buttery and melted in my mouth at each bite. I could not get enough of this dish and have tried numerous times since to recreate it at home however I always fail! How is such a simple dish done so well? It doesn't hurt that they offer you garlic bread and butter with your dish that was so delicious! 

Because our entrees came with Spumoni ice cream I wasn't a fan and therefore gave mine to my friend who loved it and said it reminded her of her childhood when she would eat it. 

I can't wait to go back to the Old Spaghetti Factory and have my Spaghetti with Browned Butter And Mizithra Cheese again!"}
{"text":"This Old Spaghetti Factory is located at Eau Claire Market. It is really busy, or at least seems really busy. My friend and I went here for supper because it's across the street from our hotel and was easy to get to. My friend's leg is a bit broken, so this was more of a convenience factor than anything. 

One thing I find weird about all the Old Spaghetti Factories I've been to is how you either have to go up a flight of stairs, or a down a flight of stairs to get to the restaurant. What's up with that? Like really, it's odd. 

Moving on we got a table right away, next to a giant group table. It was loud, but it's Old Spaghetti factory and that's to be expected. Our server, this young kid who looked about 10 (although he was probably 14, and I'm just sounding like an old lady) was awesome. Seriously awesome. Cracking jokes, really friendly. 

The food at Old Spaghetti is okay. I got this spaghetti dish with brown butter and mizithra cheese. There's no meat in this dish, but it's quite rich and was very filling. It was very salty though, not sure if that's just the cheese or if there's extra salt in the dish. Either way it was good, but way too salty for my taste. 

The food is okay. Our server was awesome. The atmosphere is a bit too chaotic and noisy than I normally like, but for being there when I needed some food this was all right."}
{"text":"Saying you like the OSF to some people seems to be the equivalent of saying you like to eat dog turds off the street. Foo on  you.

OSF doesn't pretend to be anything that it isn't. It is a basic, solid, basic, unpretentious, basic, fun restaurant; it's the type of restaurant that is disappearing in this country, where we are rapidly becoming a nation of two choices: fast food or upscale. Here you will find generous sized portions, friendly service (almost over-zealously so), and a crowd of diners that are genuinely enjoying their experience. There is always at least 1 birthday song going on somewhere in the restaurant, and I've heard as many as 4 during one visit. You'll see a cable car, you'll hear creaking floors, you'll have ice cream (included) in a small metal dish.

The salads are 100% iceberg. Want field greens or Romaine? Not here. Go somewhere else. The bread usually comes out so hot that you have to wait for it to cool. It tastes much less mass produced than the breadsticks at Olive Garden these days. You can have your spaghetti in the regular size or get the larger portion \"for the hearty appetite\". Where do you see that anymore? They have mizithra cheese. You won't find that at Bucca di Beppo. They have spumoni ice cream. Sorry, didn't notice that the last time I was at Gelato Spot. 

It's gotten to the point that I end up dining at OSF alone, with my Kindle. I hear laughs, fake puking sounds, see turned up noses when it is suggested. I've given up. It's definitely retro in atmosphere, and anything but trendy, but its consistent and satisfying."}
{"text":"I loved it here- this place reminds me of Olive Garden or Spaghetti Factory in the states. They've got pastas of every kind (even Thai dishes!) and no, it's not gourmet, but hell for the price you get salad all the way to dessert. Plus we just had to come back when we saw the waiters sing happy birthday to an elderly lady a couple of tables down. This place is perfect for a family putting and it's a shame I can't come more often."}
{"text":"I've ate at OSF twice now and it was two times too many. Both times service has been horrible. I get that working the lunch shift may not be lucrative, but yesterday I was with a group of approximately 15 and our waiter was incredibly rude and disinterested in serving us. He was banking on the fact that he would get an automatic 18% from each of us, which is unfortunate because for good service I will tip more. Beyond the lousy service, the food is not good. I had the fettucini alfredo the first time I ate at OSF and it was drowning in alfredo sauce...yuck. The salad looks like something you get from a bag. Yesterday I ordered a caesar salad as my entree. First, it had tomatoes in it. I really don't like tomatoes in caesar salad. Second, our waiter brought it out with the other salads. So that meant that when my group got their entrees, I had nothing and basically had to watch them eat. Since when were entree salads brought out with starter salads??? Lastly the wine selection is pathetic. There are only two white wines by the glass and the Riesling I had yesterday was much too sweet. 

For generic Italian food, go to the Olive Garden. At least their salad and breadsticks are decent."}
{"text":"I used to love the spaghetti factory since they cut back on their meat sauce and don't put hardly any meat in it I no longer am going there. If they raised the price I would have paid it ,but since they hardly put any meat in their meat sauce I will not be going there anymore.it's called Bolognese sauce"}
{"text":"Interior design of this restaurant is top notch. The decor and details put in is remarkable. That's as good as it gets though.
Food was extremely oily/greasy and too heavy on cheese (I love cheese but this was a whole other level). The soup we had tasted as if it came out of a Campbell's can. The salad had watery dressing which soaked the lettuce soggy. Gross. The side plates had specks of old food not washed properly. However, our waitress was extremely kind and quick. 
Honestly, I would only come back here to just have a beer and enjoy the interior ambience. Definitely take a tour around the restaurant after your meal. I really wished the food was better. 2 stars for service, and decor."}
{"text":"Surprisingly not terrible. Creepy building, yes. Food, not bad.

The minestrone was alright.  The fresh bread was good. The spumoni is not bad. 

I got the combo of Mushroom Sauce and the Mizithra Brown Butter Sauce. Skip the mushroom or any combo involving the marinara. It is not that great. 
The MIzithra is pretty awesome though. EXTREMELY cheesy (not in a gooey way, but in a salty buttery rich way)... I could feel my arteries clogging. 

The best was probably the garlic Mizithra - pretty much the basic jazzed up with garlic, bacon and mushrooms. The husband chose well with that selection. 

IF I was made to come again, I would get the Garlic Mizithra. 

But honestly? For these prices (about $12/plate), I could (and would) make a freakin Italian feast at home."}
{"text":"The food is okay at best. You don't come here for the food. You come here because it's touristy and you have friends with kids from out of town that are staying at a nearby hotel."}
{"text":"We had a party of 16 on a Sunday night.  We were greeted by a waiter with no personality.  Our drinks came on time. The salads were small and not at all what we thought they would be.  We had to ask to have the bread delivered to our table half way through the salads.  I ordered the Chicken Parmesan.  Here's where it all went bad.  The piece of chicken was 2 and a half by 2 and a half inches and the pasta was 3X3 inches.  I pointed this out to the waiter and by chance the manager was right there.  The manager was taken aback by my complaint of the portion size. He offered to bring me a larger piece of chicken but by now I was not in the mood so I asked to change my order to something else.  I can't believe they would plate something that bad and try to Serve it.  All of the pasta was under cooked and  everyone in the party agreed never to go back to this Spaghetti Company again.  We will go back to the Olive Garden or Carrabis for our Italian food.  This was a poor example of an Italian Restraint.  The manager needs to get in touch with the competition because at this point he is losing.  The moral of the story is when you are picking up a tab of $270.00 don't settle for a Baby Chicken and some under cooked Pasta."}
{"text":"We have visited the Phoenix location many times and really enjoy the food and atmosphere. The Chandler location just doesn't have that same cozy feel, and the food isn't the same. 

This is our third visit to the Chandler restaurant, which I guess says it can't be all that bad. My husband wasn't feeling well, so we opted to take out instead of eating there. The waitress was very accommodating, and made sure everything was done to our specifications - all sauces and dressings on the side, no ice in the drinks, both regular and garlic butter, and extra dressings. She even went over everything with me before I walked out the door.

When I got home and started unpacking the meals, I only needed to reheat the meals. Aside from the pasta sticking, which is to be expected without the sauce, everything was perfect. We had a good meal at home without any of the work.

We ordered spaghetti, ravioli, meatballs, sausage, and the olive  tapenade. Everything tasted fresh, but I didn't care for the meatballs... they tasted \"dark\" if that makes sense. The bread was chewy and soft and warm, the way it should be.

We will definitely be returning, but our first choice will be the Phoenix restaurant."}
{"text":"Amazing value for an amazing ambiance. I actually just ordered To Go after my movie. The hostess was kind and patient. Ordered the half and half for 12.99 and I had freshly baked loaf, a salad and an ice cream too. What a deal for that price. As a pasta lover, I already know that I wouldn't hate the food. And when I went home, I loved everything but the ravioli. It wasnt bad, but I definitely had better. To sum up my experience, great service (with a hand written \"have a nice day :)\" on my box), clean restaurant and decent food. Your 15 bucks can go far. Appetizer and dessert is covered. Will i come back? Hellz yeah. ;)"}
{"text":"I've been to the old spaghetti factory in MN many times...it's a great experience with great food. So, I was sorely disappointed with the Phoenix branch. I had the spaghetti squash with spicy marinara, it came with soup/salad, bread and spumoni. The bread is a sourdough loaf, not my preference so I didn't eat it. I can't eat lettuce/cabbage and they only had minestrone soup with cabbage and salad as the side choices...they offered me a child's applesauce as the only possible alternative; I opted out. I was very hungry by the time the spaghetti squash arrived, but it was over-cooked and dried out plus a significant lack of sauce. The waiter was nice enough but barely saw him and when I did he was pretty rushed and frantic...there really weren't that many people there. I had to ask for the spumoni at the end of the meal after paying the bill."}
{"text":"Pretty standard chain restaurant although if you're searching for a familiar old place this is it.

The service here was friendly and efficient and overall a pretty good value."}
{"text":"Whenever we are in the downtown area, we always eat here.  The decor is appealing, and the food is always flavorful.  Love the bread, salad, pasta and spumoni.  The prices are great for what you get, and the service is typically attentive.  Their kids meals are good sized, too.  This is a place that we will continue to frequent."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with a friend. This is the first time coming to this location. It's been a few years eating at an Old Spaghetti Factory. I ordered a soda and the lasagne. I really enjoyed my food. I did not like the price. Before tip it was $18. and some change. I recommend parking behind the restaurant. Parking in the front is really tight. I will be back someday when I forget how expensive it is. Lol"}
{"text":"Do you like wacky and whimsical kitschy vintage decor?
Do you like being surrounded by kids and tourists?
Do you like eating cafeteria food?

If so, you will love The Old Spaghetti Factory (which I had no idea was a chain until I came across their West Edmonton Mall location--guess that explains why they're so well-advertised). It is a great place for overpriced cafeteria style pasta. That is what I am calling their food.

I was expecting some decent comfort grub, not necessarily some high-end fancy Italian. Instead, the spaghetti is so bland that it reminds me well of the crap they serve in elementary school cafeterias. Maybe it's the tomato sauce they use, which taste like straight out of a can. I also remember ordering a lasagna that was burnt and heavy on the noodle layers.

My mother makes better spaghetti... and we're Asian! Heck, IKEA food is much better (and way cheaper) than this stuff!

The decor however cracks me up, including a dining room in the form of an old replica trolley. And judging from all the kids swarming the place, this family-friendly restaurant is one of the few that welcomes children with open arms--heck, they got more than enough dining space to accommodate multiple swarms of kids. And its proximity to most downtown Toronto tourist attractions makes the Factory a convenient eat-in spot for tourists."}
{"text":"We come here every year on our Wedding Anniversary.  We actually held our reception here, hence the tradition.

The prices are what you'd expect them to be considering the excellent quality of food, portions, and the location.

The only thing I'd like to see is a significantly larger selection for their menu.  Aside from that, we will keep returning every May 2!  ^_^"}
{"text":"I am giving this place only 3 stars, not because of the food but because of the manager that was on duty tonight. 

First off, the food was great and the server that we had was really nice. I have no complain about the food at all as we all enjoyed it. This place is also good for gatherings as the ambiance was amazing, it was not very loud and music selection was good.

However, we were disappointed with how the manager handled our situation. We understand that we had reservation and some of us were late but she did not give us our seat since our group was not complete yet. She could have sent us to the dining as we waited for our entire group to arrive as 90% of us were already there. We were not informed about their policy that if your group is not complete, your entire group will not be seated and you would be asked that your reservation will be given to other group. The place was not 100% full that night and if they have that policy, which is by the way not common and not the best service to guests, they should inform us when we book our reservation.

Overall, like I said, food was great but the manager that night could have served us better."}
{"text":"Food is great as usual , but customer service has declined dramatically in recent years. They used to include drinks with the meals, then they started charging $1 which I understand. 

I was always able to order tea and switch to a glass of milk with the meal at no extra charge since the drinks are bottomless.

Now even though tea and milk cost the same, and the have always done it, at this location and every other I've been to, this time the manager refused to do it without charging for the milk. So they would reather I buy and drink a half gallon of milk instead of 1 glass of milk and the rest tea for the same price. That makes no sense and is a very poor pricing model.

Now I've learned at lunch unlimited milk is $1 as it always was, but soda pop which costs pennies a glass is $2.98. This is ridiculous in every way and is a kick in the teeth to customers.

Very disappointed at the Iack of logic, the ignorance, and the degree of the lack of consideration for the customer and for customer service in general. Sad and pitiful really."}
{"text":"Day after Christmas 2015 went in for dinner at 4:00 pm.  One large party before us and we're told the wait would be 5 to 10 minutes.  The place was NOT BUSY!  No problem.! We were seated right inside where all servers and management personnel could see us. We sat at the table for 10 minutes  while several employees walked past our table.  NOT ONE PERSON, NOT ONE, stopped to say anything!  No one said, \"your server will be right with you or may I get you something to drink?\"  NOTHING!!!!  

We walked out and when we told them their service was less than desirable, the hostess in her best \"valley girl voice\" said, \"thank you!\"  We Love The Spaghetti Factory but this one NOT SO MUCH!  We won't be returning or recommending this joint to anyone! 10 THUMBS DOWN!!!! You get better service at any fast food restaurant!"}
{"text":"Awful service that is exceedingly slow and difficult to get help from. Food is average to below average for what you would expect."}
{"text":"The ambiance of this place is pretty great.  I made the comment while we were having diner that it would be a great place for a first date.  That way, if it is awkward, at least there is plenty to look at to make the time pass.  The food was pretty good for the price.  The service was also great.  I'd happily go back again."}
{"text":"The venue was very unique with carousel and trains inside.

The meal came with bread with a butter-garlic-basil,  salad or soup, entre, ice cream dessert and coffee or tea.

The soup was not amazing.  It didn't taste like it was from can but was very washed for taste and could use a little more time in making the soup base.  The salad was iceberg lettuce with carrot shavings.

The main course was slightly one up from  east side.  I order the pasta with clam and the dish was dry, there just wasn't a great sauce to pasta ratio.

The dessert was ice cream was okay.

Coffee was okay, but found a bit of grit on the bottom of the mug.

The washroom was pretty dirty.   Toilet paper everywhere.  There was no one regularly cleaning the bathroom unfortunately."}
{"text":"Met my family there for my sister in laws Birthday. We got there at 11:30 on Sunday and the food and service were top notch! I had the staple of just Spaghetti and Meat Sauce, it included fresh baked bread, soup or salad and even ice cream for dessert all for $10. Great Value for your money."}
{"text":"Came here a bunch of times with friends and family. Usually when we'd come for a hockey game, we'd swing in here for dinner and drinks. Or if a ball game had just ended, we'd head in here for some pasta. Now this place is really really big so you won't have any problems just showing up at the door and getting a table almost immediately. The great thing is that they're open late. 11 pm late. 

Now when you've ordered, they'll put a loaf of bread on your plate with some garlic butter which taste delicious. Once you're finished, they'll keep bringing new hot loaves over. I've never had to ask for a new fresh loaf because the waiters are on the lookout for customers who have annihilated the bread in seconds. 

There's really no point in getting the Bruschetta because you already have bread but if you do, it's actually pretty good. For the main course, they have about 30 million different spaghetti choices. Ok, more like 10 different spaghetti options. I mean. Come on. Who really thinks they're only going to have one spaghetti and meatball option considering that their name is called the old spaghetti factory???? I have tried the spaghetti and meatballs which is a big hit. The Veal parmigiana is also a fan favorite of mine. One of my friends got a lasagna one time and I couldn't stop making fun of him. I don't care how italian this place is, you don't get lasagne at a spaghetti place. Sheesh. some people. 

I've always had a good time here and will come back."}
{"text":"What can I say, I really like this place! I know the food ain't great and sometimes the crowds are a put-off. But you can't beat the charm of the antiques and whimsical oddities. And it has lots of big open spaces for groups of out-of-town guests or get-together with old high school chums. Lots of fun."}
{"text":"First time here in Arizona, family decided to come eat here. Came in, walked to the host stand, all Host are there. 15/20 seconds pass for them to even recognize us. They're all standing there talking to one another. One finally recognizes us and we ask \" can we have a table for 9 people under Jenn please? \". She doesnt give us eye contact and just stares at the screen. She replies with \" how many and what's the name? \" like hello. We just told you, do you pay attention??? We repeat it again and now we see she recognizes how many there are of us and just passes us along to one of her partners. The partner, still with no effort of being a nice host, doesn't even give us a fake high voice , tells us our wait time. We accept it and talk about how shitty the hosts were tonight. So we look for another restaurant and ditch this place. 

HOST: you know you are the face of the restaurant because we, the customers, see YOU when WE walk in. So, put on a smile because we are paying your bills. 

TLDR:  THE HOST SERVICE SUCKS ASS HERE. THEY ARE SO RUDE AND DEF DO NOT KNOW HOW TO FAKE BEING NICE, EVEN FOR THEIR JOB. PLEASE OSF MANAGER TALK TO THEM. I am a host myself, so I know what I'm talking about."}

With in our party there were babies and toddlers too and not to mention my pregnant almost due sister in law. You can imagine how upset and cranky they already were waiting since noon, at already 2 pm and still nothing. The manager could have at least apologized, or seated us nearby in tables of 4 or 6. That would have been fine too.  She said nothing. If you CAN'T  accommodate big parties or are under staffed for the moment just say so straight out from the beginning.  How annoying and upsetting our experience was!!!!!!. We left, and still they didnt have our table ready, that it would be another 20 min at least. REALLY!!!! Luckily at another place nearby the restaurant was able to accommodate us right away, Thank God, we were all gungry, mad and cranky. Our experience today with this restautsnt FRUSTRATING AND DISSAPOINTING!!!!! would have given it zero stars if I could."}
{"text":"i will extend this review in future times, however... for now I will say that 'The old Spaghetti factory' provided me with the Worst meal I have ever had in Toronto, without doubt.

For the first time in my life, I honestly could not eat my main course, unless I was ready to face the punishment of sitting on the ground of an 'Old Spaghetti Factory' toilet cubicle.

Don't even ask why I did eat here, just please listen to what I am telling you.

Horrible. Like Chuck E. Cheese, without games, prizes, and people dressed as animals.

{"text":"Just came back from the OSF...it was my first time in this restaurant. I ordered the Lasagna (mama's recipe) with the Caesar Salad to start. Hold on right there, maybe I should start from the VERY beginning. 

My boyfriend and I walk through the door, we are the first in line for a table, it takes the greeter girl a few mins to see if there is a table ready for us. We are led to our table, my boyfriend finds a spaghetti noodle on his chair from the previous people. We sit, and we sit, and we sit. About 10 mins go by and we are just starting to get ready to get up and leave when our waitress comes over to take our order (with the bread in hand). As I said, I ordered the Lasagna, with Caesar salad and a coke. My boyfriend orders the spicy chorizo penne and a honey ale. We only have to wait about 5 mins or so to actually get our food. My b/f's meal...the only thing that was really wrong with it was not enough sausage in it and he discovered that his fork was dirty about 1/2 way through. 

My meal? Well let's start with the salad. When she brought it over to me she brought the coke at the same time. Puts the coke on the table then goes to put the salad down, a crouton falls into my pop (she goes to get me another) while I am eating my \"Caesar salad\" (just lettuce with dressing and a little \"fresh\" parmesan) I look and notice there doesn't seem to be any dressing on the salad, well that's because it's all SUPER watery and is sitting at the bottom of the plate. So I put that aside and go to eat my \"mama's\" lasagna. 

What a mistake that turned out to be. The menu description is \"Layer upon layer of pasta, meat sauce and three different cheeses\" Well it really is only layer upon layer. There were only 2 layers. Around the outside the noodles were hard and crunchy and the middle was just a pile of mush. I didn't eat very much and ran out of coke about 1/2 way through the meal. When the server came over to ask if we were done (she didn't come over at all during us eating the meal to see how everything was), she noticed I didn't eat very much of my food so she asked if everything was ok. I told her frankly that it tasted horrible. 

She said she would speak with the manager to see if we could have it taken off the bill. The manager then came over to us and offered a $10 off coupon for our next visit and said that he had taken the lasagna off the bill. We proceeded to tell him that we would definitely not be back and advised him of all the other horrible things that had gone wrong prior to the lasagna. He also said not to order the lasagna when you go there as they make it for the kids so there is no spices in it so it's very bland (I did not order off the kids menu).

He tried making excuses about how his servers are all new and blah blah blah...I won't even get into the 15 mins discussion we had with him about everything and all the excuses he made. He did take care of the whole bill at the end of it all.

The jist of everything above? DON'T BOTHER GOING to the OSF. If you do, apparently go on Friday night's and say you are a friend of Joe and he will personally take care of you (or that's what he told us anyways). We will not being going back though, that's for sure."}

Both of us ordered lunch size portions and thought it was a good amount of food. I ordered the \"sampler\" (Potpourri) and enjoyed the variety of sauces.

All in all, much better than I expected whilst dining on vacation. Would recommend to those craving spaghetti."}
{"text":"First time here ... food was super good for the price - I wished I order something else , but I was in the mood for a Marsala chicken . The staff was very friendly - my only suggestion is to have a new  menu - ours was super dirty - and maybe show the bartender how to make a real lemon drop martini - because mine tasted like lemon sodas . But besides from that  I still  give the place a 5 start everyone at my table really enjoyed the time there."}
{"text":"Me and my sister in-law went for dinner this past Tuesday before the P!NK concert, I hadn't been in about 9 years. I must say I was terribly disappointed.  There was a bit of a wait for a table in the dining room so we took our buzzer and went to have a drink in the bar. It wasn't busy in the bar area so we grabbed a table. When our server  (who I'm assuming was also the bartender because he seemed to spend more time making drinks than attending to us) came over he asked if we wanted to eat in the bar instead of waiting for a table. We agreed because he said it was the same menu. We had a couple of drinks and an appetizer, but then felt pretty much abandoned. It was getting late and we didn't want to be too late getting to the concert. We finally got his attention and ordered our meals. The meals came out pretty fast, almost too fast, and weren't that hot or that good. We wondered if they had been made for some other table that changed their minds. We also never got a soup or salad or ice cream or coffee. Is this not included anymore or did our server just not bother to offer it to us? Overall a very disappointing experience which is a shame because I've always enjoyed going to the Old Spaghetti Factory in the past."}
{"text":"yuck. 
the staff-  very pretentious and rude. very slow to take our order. seemed annoyed when we asked questions about the menu. didn't check on us or ask how things were...
asked a waitress where the restroom was. she said up front to the left. I went towards the front and there's a sign pointing to the right that says \"restrooms\" so I went to the right. accidentally walked into where a party was being set up. employee got very mad at me and directed me towards the bathroom. I walked in the direction he gave me, still couldn't find it and had to ask ANOTHER employee. 

also this place is full of stairs, would not recommend if you have problems with stairs. 

the food- 
bread & butter brought to table: not good. impossible to cut. 
soup: I didn't like it, but my boyfriend did.
cheese manicotti: bland. tastes like it comes frozen. 
ice cream: weird fruity chocolate flavor. 

you get an app, entree, and dessert for the price, which is the only good thing about it. 
otherwise, just go to Olive Garden. it's MUCH better & the prices are about the same, and you get unlimited good tasting soup/salad/breadsticks."}

The Old Spaghetti Factory has been a place my family has enjoyed going to, from my grandparents to my grandkids, we have all had a nice time, the family use to go to the one out by Newport Beach, then when we moved to Phoenix, we went to the downtown location. So it was no surprise she picked this place.

We were a party of 20, when we went to the room were the tables were setup my son in law didn't like the flow of it because it had  1/2 the party on one side and other  1/2 away from them, so we moved some tables around and made a upside down L shapped table, which worked and we all got to interact with everyone.

We got there about 7pm, around 7:25  servers asked for our drink orders, around 7:45 they started asking us for our orders, but none of us had any menus but we were never able to tell anyone we didn't have menus because there was no one around, we ordered our food around 8pm.  By this time most of everyone's drinks needed to refilled, the bread that was out is now gone and there are no servers to be found.  I had to ask for tea 3 times.

The food wasn't mind blowing, it wasn't even that great, I did ignore the reviews other Yelpers wrote because this was what my daughter wanted and I wasn't going to be all Oh other Yelpers said this wasn't that great. No I wanted her to have what she wanted.    

I ordered the spaghetti with meat sauce, it was bland, no flavor, but I did eat it, I was starving. By now its after 9pm everyone was done with their meal and ready to get on the 2nd  1/2 of the party, but again no servers and no checks, people starting standing up and then out of magical air our checks showed up, everyone was not happy with the service they got, had to ask many times for refills, cheese, napkins, plates, other random things one asks for.  85% of the party skipped the free ice cream SKIPPED THE FREE ICE CREAM, the kids were the only ones who went for it, everyone else just wanted to leave.  Fortunately even with the bland food & missing servers my daughters night was not ruined. 

Oh I also should point out, I told the server that it was my daughter's 21st birthday and I wanted to buy her 1st legal drink and she took the drink order, but NEVER ID my daughter. What if I was lying about her age??   smh"}
{"text":"The online menu for this specific location has a gluten-friendly section which includes alfredo, yet when I ordered this, I was told that they could not make it gluten free. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"**Vegetarian Friendly**

Stopped by after the Ostrich Festival in Chandler because our map had a coupon for free garlic bread! We got to the restaurant only to realize the coupon was expired. The manager, Charlie, honored our coupon since we just came from the event. In fact, Charlie gave us great customer service the entire night, he double checked with us when the bills came to ensure adequate charges. 

Most of their entrees qualify as \"three-course meals\" meaning soup/salad, entrée and dessert. Why doesn't every restaurant do this?!!

Appetizer: Sicilian Garlic Cheese Bread
Excellent blend of three cheeses served with marinara sauce. I personally like my garlic bread on the crunchy side, and this was too soft for my taste.

Three Course Meal: The Managers Favorite - Mizithra Cheese with Browned Butter and Traditional Marina
I ordered the salad with the house dressing of basil and ranch. Too much dressing for the salad, but it's up your alley if you're a fan of ranch, if not their house balsamic was just as tasty. The pasta was cooked appropriately to al dente and not watery at all! I wasn't a fan of the mizithra cheese because it felt too dry even with the butter sauce; I think a garlic butter sauce would be a better option. Dessert was a scoop of ice cream, and I mean how could you go wrong? It's the perfect size to round out your meal. 

Dessert: Mud Pie Cake
Chocolate on chocolate on chocolate. It's rich, so I recommend sharing. You'll probably want a glass of milk to go with it! 

I wish they had eggplant parmesan on the menu because they have chicken parmesan. Overall, great restaurant if you're having a strong spaghetti craving!"}
{"text":"Those two stars are almost entirely for the super fun and kitschy decor! Having never heard of this place when we walked in on on a blustery weekday evening, I was and am delighted by the loud, tacky, touristy nostalgia trap. As expected, there were children running around getting underfoot; the food and service were subpar. 

I didn't feel like spending $20 on unappetizing pasta (from sneaking glances at plates), so got the popcorn shrimp and risotto balls (arancini) instead. The former was ok; the latter my friend liked, but it was the worst arancini I've ever had - edible, not delicious. I don't like wasting twenty bucks on \"ok,\" especially when we had 2-3 different servers who a) weren't engaging, b) were very slow and c) barely showed up. 

Should I mention that we waited 20 minutes to be seated in an emptying restaurant? There was really no reason to be lackluster or have to wait at ALL. I expected a lukewarm review for the food, but not the service. Luckily the company was great :) 

I recommend getting new crayons and caring about your customers. Oh, and I didn't realize fresh cheese/pepper was a thing until reading yelp reviews afterward!

Still... Looking forward to trying the spumoni ice cream.

These guys, in prime location and atmosphere, could do soooo much with their menu and, consequently, prices - and therefore service!"}
{"text":"My family and I ate dinner on Friday night. We celebrated my birthday early.  My husband and I ordered the Potpourri- it has four different spaghetti sauces- mushroom, meat, brown mizthra and clam. 
One of my son's ordered the spinach ravioli and another son had spaghetti with rich meat sauce.
All of our meals came with a salad with a choice of dressing; one of my son's chose Minestrone soup instead of salad. For beverages my son's ordered coke and my husband and I had ice tea with lemon.
After we ate our delicious meal, our wonderful waiter brought us spumoni ice cream. We thoroughly enjoyed every bite of our meal. It was the perfect ending to a busy Friday."}
{"text":"OK WHATEVER YOU GUYS!

I ate here last night and it reminded me why I like it, unlike everybody else!

For like 9 bucks I got a bowl o' soup, bread, a huge serving of yum yum yum spaghetti with mizithra cheese and dessert. And because I got the creme soda, I got to keep my cup. In my cabinet is an entire set of the old ones. Now they have newer ones.

There is a slight wait to be seated (at least during Mon-Thursday early evening hours, when I usually go), but they have old arcade games to play while you do so. The food was served quickly. And the servers always seemed over worked, but I've never really had a problem (except with trainees).

So yeah, whatever y'alls!"}
{"text":"The place is very comfortable, decor is lovely, they renovated the place,it's all a dark brick color. It's in need of a good chef, better menu. The sauces are rather bland or soured, the bread is sour dough? Where is the Italian bread? Give me real Italian sauce with spices and fresh tomatoes on my spaghetti! The staff are great, the place is clean, just needs a real chef!! When that happens, I'll come back often.Thank y"}
{"text":"We had a birthday dinner here tonight (group of about 12). It was pretty slow so I'm not sure why the service was lacking. We had to request a round of refills since nobody bothered to refill our drinks after at least 20 mins of empty glasses for the entire table. Orders were messed up, we ordered a few Italian sodas that come with a keepsake glass. When I asked for a bag or box to carry them home in they offered to get clean ones and bag them. I got home to find that they wrapped dirty glasses. My sister's card was charged for the wrong table. They apologized and said the second charge shouldn't clear her account. Overall we give it one star since the food was edible (not great) and the service left much to be desired. 

If you enjoy empty drink glasses, wrong food orders, dirty keepsake glasses and surprise charges on your card then this is your place."}
{"text":"I come here for nostalgia.....but mostly for the brown butter-mizithra cheese spagetti!"}
{"text":"I have been a frequent diner at The Old Spaghetti Factory for my entire life...literally.  My parents dined here when I was still a wish on a star and it was still The Spaghetti Company, and my first meal \"out\" in my infant carrier was here...

I really enjoy this place.  The food is always solid, the atmosphere pleasant, and the waitstaff, though it seems to turn over often, is usually very good.  The fact that most of their meals are inclusive, coming with a drink (soda not included), soup or salad and a choice of spumoni, sherbert or vanilla ice cream at the end is a real bonus!  A great place before a game downtown, to take familiy or friends from out of town, or just because."}
{"text":"No, it's not the best Italian you can get. It's a chain. But it's good. The bread is excellent. Our server kept us well stocked on drinks which was good because it had been a VERY long hot day. She was very attentive and was especially nice to my son making sure he liked everything. It's beautiful inside. So much to look at. And the food came fast which was a big benefit as we were exhausted and starving. The three course meal is very nice. I wish we had one of these by us."}
{"text":"The last time I was here, I found a hair in my food. That is all."}
{"text":"We attended a murder mystery here and was quite frankly not impressed with the food at all. This was a disappointment because we have eaten here in the past and the food had been very good. We don't know if it was because we were part of the murder mystery group or maybe just an off night. I had the spaghetti with mushrooms and it was very bland. I had been expecting a mushroom sauce however all it consisted of was a basic marinara sauce with about four sliced mushrooms on top. We only received one loaf of bread during the salad course between six people and was not offered anymore during our meal. They brought our plates out in piecemeal fashion so those that got theirs first became cold while we waited for the rest of the table to receive their's. In addition we had to ask for parmesan  cheese and it took forever for them to finally bring it so by the time it came our pasta was even colder.  The murder mystery portion was good and it made for a fun evening and I would definitely recommend it to others."}
{"text":"Wow. So much hate for Ye Old Spaghetti Factory...

I have to admit that I never went to this place as a child (that I recall) but I am still a bit of a big baby so it doesn't take much to get me excited about something. I absolutely love pasta so this restaurant is right up my alley. Plus even though I might not have been to it until I was an adult it does remind me of other places my parents would take me to back in the day -- the style of menus, the dated decor, etc. Reminds me of places like Mother's and Ponderosa.

I've only been here twice and I had a decent time on both occasions. For a pasta freak like me I thought their food was just alright. Of course it's not going to be as great as some finer places but I don't think that's what they're aiming for. Food is decent and my service was decent so they get an average rating from me. I guess it would be a place I would hit for sentimental kicks, if I were in the area or whenever I have kids and want to take them somewhere fun."}
{"text":"I went here for a birthday dinner with a large group of people.  The birthday boy had made a reservation for 20 people at 8:30pm.  I was not pleased with the greeting of the hostess when we walked in.  We told them that we were there for a reservation and we were told that we weren't allowed to sit until at least 10 people had arrived.  I can understand if someone just walked in from the street and had a big group, but we had a reservation....why can't we sit down?  We had to wait in the entrance until more people had arrived.  

My friend and I thought...well let's go get a drink at the bar then while we're waiting.  Nope.  Not allowed either.  We were told that our server may not be ready yet, so we couldn't get a drink.  WTF?  At most places, you're usually SENT to the bar to have a drink while you're waiting for your table.  

FOOD:  
Anyway, once we were seated and ordered I got one of the \"it's all included\" meals that came with soup or salad, pasta, bread and ice cream.  The minestrone soup wasn't bad, but also tasted like it probably came out of a can.  I tried a bit of my boyfriend's salad which tasted nice and fresh (it's hard to mess up a salad though) but could have used a tad more dressing.  

I ordered the Manager's Favorite which was spaghetti with your choice of 2 sauces.  I chose the mushroom taragon and the rich meat sauce.  I also added a meatball for $1.  I was told that the sauces would be separated rather than mixed together.  While technically they were separated, the bowl that it came in was so small that as soon as you started eating it, the sauces started mixing together anyway.  I would have preferred if they had used one of the bigger \"factory size\" plates so that if you didn't want them to mix at all they wouldn't.  No biggie though.  

I was actually surprised at how long it took for our food to come out.  I meal 80% of the menu is spaghetti and they probably have big batches of the sauce.  I guess we did have a big group though.  The meatball was not very good.  I'm glad I only got one.  It was very mushy and didn't have much flavour.  The sauces were quite bland.  Just like the soup they tasted like they came out of a can.  They tasted the same, but like I said above, they were probably just mixed together.  

The bread was very tasty and they brought as much as you wanted.  It was hot and fresh, and the garlic butter was very yummy!  

All of that being said, it is a really cheap meal, so I can't complain about that.  It's not like I went in there expecting a gourmet meal.  

SERVICE AND ATMOSPHERE:
Our server was great.  He asked us ahead of time if we wanted separate bills, and unlike at some restaurants he told us that there was 15% gratuity already added.  He was very attentive and joked around with us a lot, made suggestions on menu items, and didn't make a big fuss if people moved seats.  

The atmosphere of the place itself is definitely very fun.  There's a giant carousel in the middle, train cars that you can sit in and other decorations and fun seating areas.  A great place to bring kids or groups.  The location of the restaurant also has a nice patio, and great for people watching in the summer.     

However, unless it was for another birthday or something, I would not go back there voluntarily."}
{"text":"I'm traveling with family from California. Wasn't sure where to go as my family is picky. And then I remembered about old spaghetti factory that is really popular in San Jose (CA).
We were really impressed with the interior - really big restaurant (so no reservations needed), good food and fast service. Good is always good and fresh. 
All noodle dishes come with salad or soup. So don't take more than one dish (they are really big)!
Parking is there (though not that big). Lovely place, highly recommend it"}
{"text":"I decided to check this place out because I have heard great things from a friend of mine. Unfortunately I was very underwhelmed by my first and LAST visit here. The wait time on a Saturday night was fairly short and overall the ambience was great. I loved the unique furniture and the fact that all the dining tables and chairs were different. From there though the rest went pretty downhill. Our server was nice but we honesty only saw her when she took our order and when she dropped the check. Someone else brought our appetizer and salads out. One of my biggest pet peeves is dirty, finished plates crowding my table and the photo I attached sums up our visit. We never received refills, no one prebussed our table, and we were never asked how our food tasted. We even struggled to catch her attention so we could finally cash out at the end of our visit. The food was decent but given the lack of customer service we won't be back."}
{"text":"We were here for The Murder Mystery Show. This review is for the food, not the show. However, if interested, the Murder Mystery hosts were funny,engaging, and well into to murder mystery 80s theme. 

We were pleasantly greeted immediately and taken to the venue room.  

Food: salad drowning in the house dressing. Spaghetti was ok.  Not al dente but not soggy either.  Sauce had some tange but was a bit boring and needed more vegetables. The scoop of ice cream was melting as it was served, the spoons served about two minutes later. Service was ok.  Not great, not poor.  Prices were average. In summary, ok food, ok service."}
{"text":"My husband and I attended a robotics competition in Chandler and, as a celebration, the leaders made a reservation at this place for the teams. We went in earlier than the rest of the group and wound up sitting with the group from Toronto by mistake due to miscommunications on our parts; our group had a different reservation two hours after we arrived and we were not informed of it.
Now, onto the food. The bread, I could tell just by looking at it, was either made in a steam injected oven or the bakers sprayed it with water. In any case, I was impressed. The bread was served piping hot and was so good it didn't need any butter. I ordered the chicken broccoli fettuccine and my husband ordered the chicken parmigiana; both of us ordered minestrone soup and spumoni. The soup was not half bad; in fact it was one of the few times I have seen both pasta and zucchini in a minestrone. The fettuccine was good. I found the alfredo sauce a bit on the greasy side, but was pleasantly surprised that they added a touch of white wine to it, much as I do.
My husband adored his chicken as far as I can tell; it's quite difficult to screw up anything parmigiana.
The spumoni was good and just the right portion for a single person after a starchy meal."}
{"text":"Went here on Canada day. This place was super packed. With the dim lighting, stained glass decors and low hanging roof and kinda maze like seating arrangements, it felt like I transported back in time to the middle ages or maybe Alladin's cave where he stored all his treasures. 

The menu was ok. Decent priced, considering it includes soup or salad and ice cream. Portion was kinda small for me. Service was attentive and effecient, even though place was kinda packed."}
{"text":"A little rich on the sauce, too much sugar in the sauce. Very friendly server, atmosphere is good. Moderately priced, lots of families eating together."}
{"text":"Ah, pasta. One of man kinda greatest food achievements. A food so simply delicious and I believe that this restaurant has some potential. I really wanted to give a 3 star review because my main entree wasn't that memorable but everything else was fantastic so I'm being generous and rounding up to 4 stars for this review.

We went on a quiet Monday evening for my step-sisters birthday. The decor was fancy and everything seemed well organized. My first thought was the price of such elegance! Well I was proven wrong because most items were fairly cheap, 9-14 dollars roughly and it was included in their famous 3 course meal. Browsing the cocktail list made me want to try one but I was with my family who frowns upon alcohol so must try one next time I'm there with friends. 

I had the soup to start and it was hot and delicious. I dipped my bread into the soup and I wanted to get fat just off that! I knew my main entree was coming so had to save room for the good stuff. I ordered a Spaghetti Vesvious? Forgive me I can't remember the correct spelling. It had meatball, chicken and sausage with my choice of angel hair pasta and sauce. The pasta noodles were great but I wasn't stricken by the sauce. Their recipe wasn't to my liking, I would have preferred something else. It wasn't great but wasn't bad so I finished the entire plate. I figure a spaghetti factory would specialize in amazing sauce but I've had better from Oregano's, Olive Garden, etc. The dish seemed to brag about a variety of flavors but I only tasted one, tomato. It was supposed to be spicy I'm guessing because it said made with Tabasco and peppers. Not spicy whatsoever which is why I ordered it. There were so many other things on the menu I wanted to try that sounded so tasty and I probably will not order that dish again but I really want to try the spinach and cheese ravioli! They brought out a scoop of vanilla ice cream which finished the meal perfectly. The waiter was nice but I got the vibe he wanted to be somewhere else. He was attentive but every time I said thank you he wouldn't even acknowledge it. Maybe a bit more personality would help but the service was fine. They sang a personalized happy birthday and I felt bad cause I had already hear them sing about 3 other times. Would love to go back and prove they have that potential and deserve more than 3 stars!"}
{"text":"Food is subpar and waiter we had Brandon was rude and provided lousy service. If you don't want to waste your money on mediocre food and bad service, do not eat here."}
{"text":"I have been a long ime patron of The Old Spaghetti Factory on the eEsplanade. Last night could not have been a better night. My parents as well as my brother and his girlfriend have never been there before we're with us , along with my fiancée and her parents who have been there before. 

Where to start, the food quality could not have been better. This place always has amazing food and very generous portions. Their regular sized will fill you the factory sized either split it with someone or you will bring some home.

Also the atmosphere in the place is far better than anywhere else. No loud music and tons of things to look at, like the old elevator car converted into a table, or the old carousel with horses that has tables on it, or the old ttc streetcar with dtables inside and all the old stained glass just to name a few.

The service we had was impeccable. Our server Tim made the night more magical than it already was. To start we went there for my fiancée' birthday, well when the meal was done Tim came and did a really amazing card trick for her where he was very accurately able to guess her age using cards the rest of our group drew. He was friendly, kind, caring, and truly loves his job. 

I also proposed to my fiancée  this was last night (Dec 19, 2015) As I asked Tim earlier in the meal to bring champagne before dessert but after the meal. I actually never told him why but he was amazing at remembering every detail that we requested. 

All in all I have to give The Old Spaghetti Factory a 5/5 if I could go 6 out of 5 I would. Their prices are great the service is always great, especially on the service last night, the food amazing as usual I highly recommend this place to all my friends and family and a few times to random people who asked me while around Union if I knew a good place to eat. Thank you, please do not change."}
{"text":"I've eaten that many old spaghetti factory's, the one in Chandler just happened to be the most recent. I arrived at approximately 5:15 PM on a Thursday, there was no way to get in. They set our party of four in a half circular booth, two of us are large guys well over 200 pounds. This wasn't the best choice of tables. The waitress was very polite got our drinks and took our appetizer order. I do recommend the garlic fries, as long as you love garlic! We all ordered our entrées and incidentally we all got the minestrone soup before our pasta. The minestrone soup was much better than Olive Garden I will say. Our pastas arrived the food was hot but not particularly flavorful. Overall a decent dining experience but nothing to get excited over."}
{"text":"I love the spaghetti factory in Phoenix, but they are always understaffed and there's long waits even during weekday nights at 8:30PM. Pita Jungle is looking good at this point. If they say a 20 minute wait. Count on 45!"}
{"text":"This place was a lot of fun to bring the kids. When we got there, the wait was pretty short, my husband requested a seat in the train, so we walked around the lobby while our table was being prepared. I'm glad we had the time to stroll around, all the creepy old rooms were awesome. The PacMan game is a great touch.

As we approached the table, my 5 year old's smile stretched from to ear at the sight of walking up those train car stairs. Our server was prompt and courteous. Our food was good, I had the cheese ravioli, the kids had some spaghetti, and my husband had the chicken Marsala. But  I'm not a foodie, so this is not about the food. It was about the ambiance. Which was fantastic. The food was good enough to not lose any stars because of it. 

The refills were on point. The only negative was that all of the tables around us were dirty. But I think that's because the train is too small to have a busser in there while customers are there. It, at the very least, would be a tight fit with the possibility of him bumping in to us.

The check was small. Love that. It's a very affordable restaurant.

Next time we come, we're riding the tram and sitting at the bar. I forgot how cool this place was. We were glad the kids had a weird spaghetti craving that night."}
{"text":"The only thing that would make this place more of a tourist trap is if it had a box propped up by a stick with a string on it, baited with a two-for-one coupon for a Toronto double-decker bus tour.  For whatever reason, folks who have grown up in Toronto of a slightly Golden-brown age remember their first time to the Old Spaghetti Factory fondly.  There was a novelty organ, a train that ran around the restaurant on elevated tracks, tons of fake antique-y items.  Oh, and they served spaghetti.  They still do.

This appears to be the only known survivor from the late-70s-early-80s onslaught of old-timey pizza-pasta places.  Mother's Pizza is gone, Frank Vetere's is MIA, and all we have left is the Old Spaghetti Factory.  The place is charming enough and is definitely child-friendly.  But if you're looking for pasta dishes that are \"authentic\", \"Italian\", or \"good\", you'd do well to find a truly Italian restaurant.  Being kid-friendly comes at a cost.  Just ask Chuck E. Cheese (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/chuck-e-cheeses-north-york)."}
{"text":"I have been here a handful of times- I normally go here when I want to fill up on decently good italian food, but don't want to spend too much $$.

Old Spaghetti Factory has a great ambiance, full of stained glass lamps & even a cute decorative train. Very spacious, you will never be standing around waiting for a seat.  Definitely a good place to take a large party (of 20?), good place to take kids (think free crayons + birthday parties).

That said, I was pretty disappointed with my meal, having had recollections of better food in the past (the minestrone soup was overly laden with beans and macaroni and didn't taste like a soup, it was more like a pasta dish).  The entree was ok (I ordered the spicy rich meat sauce spaghetti), the bread and butter was definitely the best part of the meal. Maybe my impression was also influenced by the menu prices, which I noted had risen by at least $5 for each entree item (for example, the pot-pourri spaghetti meal used to cost me under $10, but now it's $15).

Perhaps Old Spaghetti never really did offer amazing italian food, but I had always considered it great value for decently good italian food. Now, with the hike in prices, you might as well head to Libretta's (on Ossington) and order a pizza as you'd definitely get better food for the same price."}
{"text":"Wonderfully charming place filled with attention to detail and comfort food!

It is perfect for large & small groups. The food is very reasonably priced and the environment is appropriate for adults and children alike. 

I love the wooden floors, the cable car that sits in the center (it's a treat to be seated inside!), the separation of dinning areas into different rooms that provide large groups a measure of privacy & the small tables for 2 that all have plush and unique chairs.

This location is on Central, directly across from the light rail. Unlike most restaurants in the area, it has a very large parking lot. Not having to worry about parking makes meals here that much more enjoyable :)"}
{"text":"Kind of shocked I haven't reviewed this place earlier, since this is the place to go if you want a quarantined fun dinner out that everybody will enjoy. From dates to family gatherings, this place never disappoints! Not only is in the interior absolutely stunning with an incredibly hospitable staff, but you're surely to warm up to them once you're served with a freshly baked roll of bread and their in house garlic butter as soon as you're seated. Their menu is simply and straightforward, as they do have both vegetarian and gluten free options for their pastas. I've had their classic tomato and meatballs spaghetti as well as their Alfredo fettuccini, and they're both a delight. If you decide to go with the factory feast and opt for a deluxe desert, their decadent chocolate cake is a must! Absolutely love this place for every special occasion. 

TLDR; great place for a fun night out, friendly staff and lots of good food for a great price!"}
{"text":"Best food and service I have received at any old spaghetti factory ( I have been to several). Karen our server was AWESOME. Our food arrived fast and tasted great! The Christmas tree and decoration's are cool also. Check this place out!"}
{"text":"The Old Spaghetti Factory has been a family staple for many years.  We used to love coming here with our kids for a good time, great portions of pasta and a unique, antique and relaxed atmosphere.  While some menu items have changed, we still enjoy the white clam sauce (which, I'm the first to admit is like a white clam gravy), the kids' meals are fantastic and the mizithra with browned butter is still a dish that speaks for itself.  The pasta is al dente and the bread is hot and fresh.  

However, over the years the service has gone downhill.  We have avoided our favorite place because of the long drive, and found the price just wasn't worth the trip anymore.  Last week, we chanced it again.  The wait was moderate and the drinks were strong (and surprisingly so!).  The food was very good and the waitstaff was on their game.

BUT - the lobby.  Oh, the glorious lobby which used to be filled with large antique furniture, including an old-fashioned sled the people could sit in to wait.  The \"Spaghetti Tree\" was leafy and dusted and nice - not so much this time.  The lobby is in very ill-repair.  It is no longer inviting - it is, instead, rundown and depressing.  Kids run rampant and why not?  It no longer looks like a place where one should sit nicely and wait for a table.  The Spaghetti Tree is showing its age, with layers of dust and missing leaves, and the \"pasta case\" is still filled with the same noodles that have been inside of it for years. 

It is way past time for the owners to take the time and spend the money to fix up the lobby and restore it to its days of glory.  No, this is not a new restaurant.  Yes, it still needs a spit and polish to make it really shine.  This is one chain that has never felt like a chain, and in order to stay open with all of the new businesses in the area, it is more than time for a revamp.

Old Spaghetti Factory, we have given you a second chance.  Its time that you invited us back by showing that you too, care about your restaurant."}
{"text":"As Chef Ramsay would say, I wouldn't serve this s*it to a dog.  A place with this name should make their pasta from scratch, but they don't.  Perhaps their sauce is made from scratch? Nope.  There is nothing authentic about this place.  It's lazy cooking, lazy owners, and lazy front of house staff.  The food is crap to say it nicely.  Bland, undercooked and boring.  The servers I had on both occasions I was here were slow and more interested in their phones than their customers.  If you want good Italian food, go to an Italian restaurant.  The Old Spaghetti Factory is the McDonald's of the Italian food scene."}
{"text":"Hard to believe that something like spaghetti could ever really fall out of date, but pasta ain't what it used to be. With Asian noodle houses such as pho, ramen and fusion restaurants dotting the landscape now, places like this are becoming a rarity. Still, The Old Spaghetti Factory marches on.

I've been a couple times and it's never bad. The spaghetti is fairly decent, the servers are friendly and quick and for the table everything we asked for. The spaghetti itself is pretty Ho-Hum, and the place inevitably draws comparisons to East Side Mario's, but it's still a good place for what it is: family dining downtown at a decent price. I 'factory' sized my spaghetti which our server was sure I wouldn't finish, and I have to say that I don't know if this is more a reflection on what a pig I am or how small their servings are, but I will say it wasn't much of a problem at all! It's probably because I'm a pig. 

Worth going to for large parties or corporate stuff. Dates and intimate gatherings night better suited for a smaller setting."}
{"text":"Was very impressed with everything here.  The waiter was one of the best I have had in a long time, the food was fabulous and the atmosphere was very relaxing after a long day of shopping.  Will most defiantly be back!"}
{"text":"The Chandler Old Spaghetti Factory location is the worst! Service and food are awful. We had a horrible experience few months ago with the food and our very snotty server and when we complained to the manager, he actually told us off and kicked us out of the restaurant. We were shocked and speechless. The worst part is.. We wrote about our experience to OSF headquarters in Oregon and the regional district manager and they didn't even care. We've been loyal OSF customers for over 30 years, but no more."}
{"text":"Stopped by the Old Spaghetti Factory because we saw one in Banff but did not have a chance to walk in for lunch or dinner. My husband and I had dinner here recently, we were seated immediately! The restaurant, however smelled a little musty and was not updated at all. The food was good, but nothing extraordinary in my opinion. The deal is great however, you get an entree, soup or salad, ice cream and tea or coffee with your meal, seems like a great bargain!"}
{"text":"Took an out of town friend to what used to be one of my favorite places.. 39 minute wait for a half empty room, the worst I mean worst service I have ever had.. bread hard as a rock, we asked a different server to replace it, never saw the server again until he brought the check and then he never came back.. i had to get up and look all over for him. Why the renovation? I don't understand how they are still in business."}
{"text":"Bad food, horrible service.  Nothing redeeming about this place. Believe me, you ate better off eating at the food court in the mall."}
{"text":"I am giving this 5 stars.I haven't been here in years but had dinner here tonight with my daughter.The food is still excellent and we were really impressed with our server Izzy.He was very attentive,friendly and went out of his way to make sure we had great service.Our family has always loved this restaurant and still do.We recommend this highly."}
{"text":"Passed by here a gazzilion times, but finally had to go there yesterday and was pleasantly surprised! There is so much antique looking furniture in there, and even an old street car, the waiting room was obviously some kind of show room before but the subterannean dining was nice and cool for Phoenix. My Chicken Parmigean was great and the pricing was very reasonable I should try going for Dinner next time. 
Very unlike the other huge chain restraunts in Phoenix, the old spaghetti factory packs a punch for the days gone by."}
{"text":"My friend who moved to the city thought that the Old Spaghetti Factory was a hip and happening spot for locals. In fact, it's a cheesy and touristy restaurant with lots of interesting gimmicks (British phone booth, mummy, a merry go round (not functioning), train you can eat inside of, and the list goes on. Check out the photos to see what I mean.

Much of their menu is $20, which includes a soup/salad, pasta dish, coffee/tea and ice cream (get the Spumoni - pistachio-vanilla-chocolate). They serve warm bread with whipped herb butter. If carbs are your jam, you'll love it here. For pasta, I had the penne with chicken (subbed out my sauce for pesto). Admittedly, you get a lot of food for the price. But I found the food to be average - there was way too much dressing on my salad and the pasta was a tad too salty for my liking. 

The service was just fine. The factory is very family friendly and great for kids. I can imagine having my birthday from ages 5 to 10 here. Coincidentally, we happened to have four August birthdays in our group and the staff came out singing with sparklers in our ice cream. 

Overall, it was a fine experience but it wasn't really my jam."}
{"text":"I think I expected too much.... I would have been better off sitting at home ordering pasta and bread sticks from pizza hut. That's how much I regret coming here. The shrimp alfredo pasta was ridiculous, basically just boiled fettuccine and cheap alfredo sauce from a jar and probably frozen shrimp that's just been boiled. The bread sticks tasted ok but like I said, pizza hut could have done it better. And the salad? Oh my god... Just plain iceberg lettuce and crappy store bought vinaigrette. Nothing tasted authentic restaurant made, it was like cafeteria food!"}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant on a Friday night. I will say the service was lovely, despite being quite busy Michael was attentive and answered every question I asked. However the food was sub par. The minestrone soup was okay, the bread was a bit stale, the Italian cream soda and spumoni were lovely. 

The actual meal I ordered was not good. I ordered the Breast of Chicken Fettuccine. It was luke warm when it got to the table, and the Romano sprinkled on top was only halfway melted and couldn't be mixed in to the sauce. The chicken tasted like it was from a can and was not seasoned. The noodles tasted like styrofoam. The broccoli was still a bit frozen, and the sauce was unimpressive to say the least. The mushrooms were fair. If I hadn't skipped lunch I don't think I would have eaten as much as I did. I paid about $25 including tip, and I expect a bit more than \"sort of okay\" for that kind of money. 

All in all I wouldn't go back and certainly wouldn't recommend it."}
{"text":"On a hot afternoon, we were traveling home to mid-city Phoenix from a Diamondbacks day game on the light rail. Hungry, we reached the McDowell Road stop about 5pm and got off to dine at the Old Spaghetti Factory. Upon entering a nearly empty restaurant, it took the hostess girl several confused minutes to seat us. We eagerly waited well over five minutes for someone to bring us glasses of water, which typically happens automatically in Phoenix restaurants in June, when a waitress finally appeared and took our drink and dinner orders. Still no water. While waiting at least another ten minutes, no drinks or water, we observed several, if not many, other employees standing around talking to one another or just doing nothing. Still no water. We then walked out and will not ever go there again."}
{"text":"Stay as far away as you can from this place.  I have been twice and both times both of our entrees were cold.  The last time I came I should have known I was going to have a bad experience by the fact that the kitchen manager and floor manager were chit chatting on the floor the entire time I was there.  I ordered the Breast of Chicken Fettuccine.  It was possibly the worst pasta dish I have ever had.  The chicken was so dry I could not eat it.  It tasted like it was either boiled, reheated or a little of both.  The cold stale pasta and sauce did little to compliment it, so I picked the broccoli out and that was that.  I wonder how they are teaching servers nowadays because when I was still in the industry and two plates looked untouched we were taught to inquire about what was wrong.  I did not feel the need to complain because as I stated before the manager was obviously too busy hanging out nonchalantly to care about my awful dish.  I would stay away unless you are just of the greedy type that don't mind stale pasta because they will give you a heaping serving for around $10."}
{"text":"This review started out as a 4 star in my head at the beginning of my visit but ended up at 2.

We walked into the joint early on a Sunday evening, no lineup, got seated in the lounge (our request - they have comfy couches!) right away.

The meal deal is great - soup/salad + bread + meal + ice cream + coffee/tea? I'm sold!

Drink service was pretty quick off the draw, but the server ended up having to come back & ask me again what I ordered about 10 minutes later, which was a bit odd. The person I was with wasn't sure what he wanted right away, and had to flag someone down about 20 minutes later to (finally) order his drink.

After ordering our meals, we received our appetizers no problem. But in the middle of eating, our server came by and asked us (again!) what our meals had been?? Even odder. Why weren't these things written down or entered into the system right away?

I got the Red thai chicken curry. The sauce was amazing - if it had been served over rice, it would have been PERFECT. I loved it.  And maybe a bit more kick but I can overlook that. Served with fettuccini, though, didn't do it justice. Even my dining partner agreed (as I'm not a pasta person so I needed a second opinion).

However, service degraded after this. We were left to our own devices for what felt like forever, and then finally our server directed someone else to pack up our meals. He asked if we wanted the bill before asking whether we wanted ice cream and coffee/tea. Brought 2 bills (both identical - we only paid 1!) There were no water refills throughout the entire meal.

After waiting 15 or 20 mins, I had to get up & stand next to the payment machine & flag down our server to actually pay (via credit card).

And, to finish off the evening, I had the pleasure of watching 2 servers (ours included) get into a fight about meals & who was busier that evening. Not exactly mature. Take your disagreements into the back, not right in front of your customers.

Doesn't really make me want to come back. The food was alright but the service turned me off."}
{"text":"Attention, all servers everywhere: if you get a family with little or semi-little kids, just assume they will spill something and bring extra napkins as your usual procedure. Esp if u want a good tip.

This location is at Chandler mall, right outside the food court/behind Harkins/across from California Pizza Kitchen. Parking is almost always a problem because of all the food places and also Macy's.

Don't bother to make reservations.  When you arrive on time, everyone who did not make any will get to go ahead of you! 

Bread they give is sourdough and it is very sour and tough as nails. The best part is if the butter comes out soft instead of hard...easier to spread but for sone reason, they like to bring it out cold and so it usually ends up being unspreadable.

Tortellini is really good. Salad that you get with the tortellini? Mostly iceberg lettuce :/

Kids meals are pretty good and we love the triangular crayons. 

A few of the servers are quite good. Many have forgotten silverware, left us hangin for refills, etc.
Dessert included with all meals is ice cream...either vanilla or spumoni. Most will not tell you or offer chocolate sauce on that in case you dont care for spumoni or plain vanilla, so keep that secret in your back pocket if you need to.

One time we sat on the patio...waitress turned on a heater overhead for us. At 45 min before closing, the tv went off. We asked the waitress and she was all, \"huh.  Not sure why.\" And never got it back on for us. 
This visit, the sun was in our eyes and I asked the server if he could put a shade up and the manager came to move us, so that was cool.

They have Coke products and I believe a full bar since there is a bar section where you can also sit.

There is a train with tables you can sit in...usually those are reserved, but see my comment about reservations above. 

Some tables have these high-backed velvety chairs and we feel like the royal family when we get those. :) 
They have a loyalty program. Check in on their tablet when you arrive by punching in your cell # and on 5th time you can get a free lunch item or a discount if it is dinnertime."}
{"text":"We've been eating at The Old Spaghetti Factory since 1983 wherever we can find one. We also always order the same thing: Manager's Favorite with white clam sauce and browned butter/mizithra. It never fails to satisfy. Eat at your location, if you're lucky enough to have one nearby."}
{"text":"I think the food is tasty. I came for lunch and I felt the portions were a little small. But overall the service was good, food was good, and it was a three course meal. The complimentary bread was hot and delicious. And the butter was soft not frozen. I hate frozen butter that rips my bread up."}
{"text":"It's hard to screw up spaghetti and meatballs, so they do ok here. But I always get the sensation that if it were a little easier to make an unsatisfactory pasta dish (I'm not too picky with the basics), they might do it here. 

I've eaten here many, many times and have never walked away disappointed or let down, but I think the trick is that this is one of the first Italian restaurants I ever went to. I can't even tell you how many birthday parties in the trolley I attended and came home with spumoni caked on the front of my Hypercolor t-shirt. 

Now, having been to a few more restaurants of all varieties, I can unquestionably say that food here is not bad nor good, but it's great if you're a six year old who doesn't know the difference. 

Post Script/N.B.* My girlfriend has informed me that if you call ahead for a kids' pasta meal, you can get a healthy portion of pasta, side salad, loaf of bread, and a carton of milk for $4. Be advised, they may look at you funny when you pick up your meal, unless you are indeed a child rather than a starving college student, in which case you shouldn't have a problem."}
{"text":"A complete disaster!!! We choose this restaurant for my special needs sons birthday., I stress this point only because we put in a reservation a week  early and I called the day before and the day of just before we left to ensure everything was ok and taken care of. So when we arrived my wife let the hostess know we were there for our reservation they told us to have a seat and the would seat us.WE WAITED 25 MINUTES AND NO ONE TALKED TO US OR EVEN APPROACHED US. Needless to say my son's birthday was ruined, and when I asked why we had not been seated THEY SAID WE HAD BEEN PUT ON THE \"NO SHOW\" LIST .... REALLY WE SAT HERE FOR 25 MINUTES.. never again will I ever go to this establishment... HORRIBLE"}
{"text":"family restaurant. Only excuse to eat here is if you have children. The pasta is average. That is, average for pasta cooked anywhere, by anybody.

Maybe it's literally a factory?

No redeeming qualities except for the bonding which ensues as you're complaining about the meal with friends and family.

I've been here a few times, and the only memorable one occurred when my friends started spitting water at each other through straws. This would have been unacceptable at almost any other restaurant. But not here.

You're on yelp. Find something better."}
{"text":"Best family place without a side of fries.  Love the quiet yet fun atmosphere.  This isn't Chucky Cheese, this is a place to sit down with your family and have a nice meal with your family and friends."}
{"text":"Went here to meet a friend for lunch. Did not like the food at all. Their pasta was very dry (yes even with the sauce). Flavor was very disappointing."}
{"text":"I was writing a review about how much I dislike Buca Di Beppo, and it occurred to me that I like this place even less.  I've been to this location before and a few others in different cities.  It's always the same.  I'm looking for something good to eat that would want to bring me back and I've never had that experience here.  Plus there's like a million places in the Southeast Valley that are better, both chain and local.

Yeah the inside is nice, it's close to the mall, staff is fine.  Bla bla.  I even had the Mizithra cheese dish that people seem to rave about.  Buttered spaghetti with some cheese on it.  I make a better side dish in 10 minutes at home.  It is inexpensive, but then again so is Fazoli's.  I did kind of feel like they threw my precooked spaghetti into  hot water like they do at Fazoli's, but I just couldn't see them doing it."}
{"text":"I have not been to the Old Spaghetti Factory for years.  It was a family affair when I use to go.  I went with my friend.  Upon arrival we were told it would be a 15 minute wait.  They gave us a buzzer.  Within 5 minutes we were placed in the streetcar.  There are many themes in the restaurant.  Our waitress was fast, pleasant and always checking on us to make sure our meal was o.k.  We both ordered the lasagna meal which came with a salad, all you-can-eat home made warm bread, ice cream, coffee or tea.  The portions were just like I remembered and well worth the meal.  The food was hot and tasty.  We made sure we tipped our waitress over the 15% because she was amazing.  I enjoyed being there and we had no problem hearing each other.  We felt we had the place to ourselves when it was packed."}
{"text":"Really Really strange discombobulated style. Part bordello, part  barbershop, crate tiled ceilings and 80's arcade.

Very spacious.  Very eye catching in not a very good way.  

Ordered the Marsala and Lasagna factory plate.  Two main dishes on a huge plate. No sides. Just a huge bread.  It was actually enough for me and my bf  to split between the two of us

All in all it was pretty charming."}
{"text":"The host was rude, didn't put my name down and my family and I waited for over an hour due to this error. The manager apologized and got us seated once she noticed we were waiting for a long time. Our waiter was very nice and changed the entire experience. If it wasn't for the the waiter, i would give this place 1 star at most. The food is slightly above average."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with everything from the food to the service.  I took my daughter for dinner and they were not very busy so I am not sure what happened.  The fettuccine was barely warm and when I asked if I could get shrimp with it, the shrimp was served in a cold bowl on the side.  My daughter ordered pasta with a simple butter sauce and it too was served barely warm and the pasta was severely under cooked.  No one refilled our drinks, no one checked on our meal, and at one point I timed how long it took for our waiter to come back.  It was 17 minutes.  He was more concerned with the larger parties he had nearby, working the larger tip I assumed, than us.  When he asked how everything was, and I told him, there was no offer of any kind to make up for the sub-par food or the lack of service.  He simply replied \"I am in the weeds.\"  The best part of the meal was the bread."}
{"text":"This was our first and last experience at the Old Spaghetti Factory. We walked in yesterday evening and I promptly greeted the two hostesses at the front desk. They were chatting amongst themselves, turned to look at me, and then went back to chatting with each other. My husband, thinking  they hadn't heard me, also greeted them and we were once again met with the same chilly silence. An awkward moment passed where they stared at us and we stared at them before one of the hostesses turned and grabbed three menus and walked us through a nearly empty restaurant - passed all the lovely tables,  architectural details, and charming decor - all the way back to the bowels of the restaurant. We were sat at a dingy table on the kitchen's doorstep. Who doesn't enjoy being serenaded by clanking dishes, wait staff yelling at each other, and the general cacophony of a kitchen in a nearly empty restaurant? How thoughtful. The waiter, who was far more friendly than the hostesses, was nice enough if not a bit bungling. He stepped on my husband's foot once and even hit him with the serving tray accidentally. We were off to a great start. 

Our food was as miserable as the service. The sourdough bread came with a side of warm margarine, and the minestrone soup was a little too close to canned-tasting for my liking. My husband had the #3 which came with two meatballs, spaghetti with meat sauce, and an Italian sausage. (He fared the best.) His son had the pope pourri (poo pourri) which is spaghetti with four different, equally sad, canned sauces. I ordered the jumbo crab raviolis which were served unexpectedly lukewarm/cold and dry with a little warm sauce and oil. There is nothing special about the food - it's edible, yes, but it's also lacking anything crave-able. The food is overpriced for what you get. It's \"competitively priced\" with trendy midtown eateries, but lacking all of the flavor, care, and quality that makes the other places so very worth it. 

The highlight of the evening came when the waiter brought the check and cough/laughed enveloping the table in a thick, aromatic blanket of smoke which hung in the air like a moist hug. It was the perfect unappetizing, terrible end to a generally terrible experience."}
{"text":"I have always loved the food here...especially since they are doing gluten free. It smells wonderful too. I usually don't let servers ruin the experience since I rarely talk to them, it's the food that matters! You can get A LOT for 12 bucks and if you order an italian soda in their signature glasses you can take the glass home!"}
{"text":"Just left here, will not be back.  Artichoke dip was all oil, no cheese.   Food had no flavor. The best part if dinner was the sherbert.    Waiter was not freindly at all, he was on the verge of rude.  Reached across the table numerous times.  When your meal for 4 is 80 dollars, I expect some etiquette.       Nicest person there was the bus boy."}
{"text":"I like to give places a chance. I'm not a harsh critic, and don't always let a couple bad reviews steer me away from trying a place. In this case, I should have listened. 

First off, it wasn't horrible. The food was OK, nothing special. The service wasn't the worst I've had, as the waitress was attentive, but she mumbled and didn't really provide much more than subpar service. 

Overall my experience was underwhelming, and forgettable. I probably wouldn't choose to eat here again."}
{"text":"First time for us.  The interior is very elegant and reminded me of the cheese cake factory.
Maybe the same corporation.....who knows?
The staff is incredibly young......college young which did not match the overall theme of the place.
For 32.00...we had pasta and sauce, pasta and clam sauce, salad, soup, 2 spumoni ice cream, a coke and a cherry float.
Definitely a great deal with hot bread, soup or salad, entree and dessert included in your entree price.

No linguine !!!!! No way !!#!#&* !
My pasta and clam sauce was creamy and very good.
Their standard meat sauce is very thick, savory and rich. Very old school.....which might turn off some people. Not light by any stretch. Not our style.

Service at 530 pm was questionable with our soup n salad coming with our entrees.
We will go back ......."}
{"text":"I love the bread that they serve at the restaurant! It is so warm and fresh. The spaghetti is okay. I wouldn't say it's outstanding but it's not that bad either."}
{"text":"This restaurant will close soon to make way for another office tower. No word on a new location yet.
Saturday night at the Old Spaghetti Factory was great reward for my daughter who stuck with me while I did a bit of weekend work in my downtown office. Our four-course meals, plus a beer for me, came to $30 plus tip. That's great value, even if the food is a bit uninspired."}
{"text":"I really, really, REALLY wanted to give this place a chance because it holds sentimental value, but I was let down in a big way.

You walk in to OSF and you're immediately overcome with that \"old-timey\" stench. The same stench that can be found in thrift stores and your grandmother's moth-balled attic. Albeit, the building has been around for decades, it doesn't need to smell like it. 

The service was decent, but that doesn't take away from the fact that the food was less than spectacular. The salad that preludes the meal was drenched in dressing, but the bread came out fresh and still very warm. We ordered the lasagna with marinara sauce and manicotti with meat sauce. The noodles were cooked perfectly and that's where the praise stops. The filling hardly filled either entree and the sauces tasted as if they were poured from Chef Boyardee cans. Absolutely hated the meal. Thank goodness for free refills on the soft drinks, because it took a lot to wash that taste from the taste buds. 

Not sure if we'll ever be back to this location. We might give the one in Chandler a chance, but only time will tell."}
{"text":"I like going to the spaghetti factory when I want some comfort food. The service is usually fast and friendly. And Thr spaghetti meals are consistently good. I liked the Decour of the old spaghetti factory better but you don't eat the Decour."}
{"text":"Love the service and the food. This place may not be 'authentic' enough for some but it's nice to have a restaurant in Toronto where neither the food or the servers are pretentious. Love their never ending bread and penne with arrabiata sauce."}
{"text":"This was the first and last time I will every go to this place. My waitress was extremely rude and didn't know anything about the menu. I was with 2 of my 4 children and had asked for bread and was told not until you put in your entree. What sense does that make so my kids have to scream and starve because you can't get them bread wtf. Like that wasn't bad enough she drops the food and that was the last time I seen my waitress. I waited over 20 mins for her to return and she never did so i had to ask someone else for my check. But she must have had checked on the table behind us every 2 mins flurting and bull shitting. I couldn't even get my water refilled. Besides the fact that the 2 chicken parm sandwiches we ordered were burnt but no one cared. I get my check and tell the floor manger how horrible the experience was and the food that was half eaten because couldn't force another bit down due to the horrible taste. He takes my card says sorry and charges me for everything. On the way out I proceeded to inform the big manger how my experience was. His response I'm sorry next time you come back let one of us know and we will take care of it. Mind blown next time there will never be a next time and I made that clear. He obviously just didn't feel like addressing the problem. I would never recommend this location to anyone the service and food sucks. If you bring it up to management don't worry they don't care and won't do anything anyway. Don't waste your time or you money going here. The only good thing was the decor."}
{"text":"I have gone to this place since even before it was the \"Old Spaghetti Factory.\"  Originally, this building was 2 houses built in the 1920s owned by two families, the Coles and the Bakers. In the 1940s, the Coles bought the Baker house, and combined the two houses into one.  In the 1970s, the Barrow family bought this structure, and turned it into the \"Spaghetti Company,\" and was in business until the mid 1990s, when it was sold to the current owners of the Italian restaurant chain, The Old Spaghetti Factory.  Local Phoenix legend has it that the place is haunted.  In any event, the building itself is worth the visit to see.  It is almost like a museum with all the memorabilia on the walls, and the huge trolley in the middle of the place.  As for the food, I really like their pasta and marinara sauce, and they have great bread and sausage."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to go here to celebrate our wedding. We had a large party of people we gave our drink order and sat and waited for what seemed like forever before our food orders were taken. We ordered drinks from the bar that never came because they waitress thought we were joking. The taste of the food made up for the horrible service. When I talked to the manager about the service she only apologized and that was it and made an excuse for the waitress being new. The waitress had to many tables and big parties. I will think second the next time we go here with a large party of people."}
{"text":"I actually really love this place; I don't know how you couldn't. The waiters we've had here are the sweetest and are very attentive. The second my tea was empty, it was promptly replenished. WITH a new lemon. Every time. The same went for out salad dishes; they were gone as soon as our salad was done! 
Cory was seriously one of the best waiters we've ever had. He was kind, attentive and funny and we replay enjoyed his company as a waiter! He had the best timing; I was very impressed. I can honestly say I've never had such great service.

Regarding the food, for the money, it is a very great deal. It's cheaper than Olive Garden (which I now hate in comparison) and even includes spumoni. 

We both started with salads. I love their vinaigrette and the fact that the bowls were cold. We also received some hot bread which was pretty standard.

For the actual entree, I had the manager's special with the marinara and the cheese and browned butter sauce (which were both pretty awesome) and my father had the chicken parmesan. He thought the chicken was good, but would have preferred it to be a little thiner, but he scarfed it down (and he is an italian food snob). Otherwise, I mean, come on.. They even have gluten free pasta! That's awesome! We also ordered a side of broccoli which was the perfect compliment to our meal.

We finished off with the spumoni (included) and it was the perfect end to a great meal!

I am very impressed with this place and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Ran into this place on the way from the airport to Grand Canyon and had a great time there. You can try 4 types of sauce for your pasta at the same time and all four were excellent. I particularly like the meat sauce - great thickness and flavor. The interior was very interesting too."}
{"text":"How can you not love Old Spaghetti Factory? I don't care if it us a chain. It's cheap. It's good. And you can sit in a booth that looks like it's in a train car. It's great! 

It had been a while since the boyfriend and I had been to the OSP and during our last visit I was reminded of how much I liked it. I ordered the pasta sampler so I got the pasta with the cheese and browned butter and a meat sauce. The cheese with browned butter is SO good. It's their signature item and it's awesome.

Of course all their meals come with bread, soup or salad, a drink and a scoop of ice cream or sherbet at the end. And I think my entrée was like $12.99. Total pasta score in my book.

We left happy, full and with intentions of returning soon."}
{"text":"Mama mía, thats a nice ravioli. Ok, so I like their ravioli- I have been to better places & I've been to worse places. I guess why I gave them 3 stars is because of their parking situation & their wait time.  You literally park all the way behind the restaurant and walk all the way around- but wait, there is a door half way you can use, but it is an exit only door!"}
{"text":"Was looking for a restaurant that we don't have in out hometown. Arrived about 30 minutes prior to our reservation time. We were seated right away. Waitress was nice. The water tasted like tap. Margarita tasted like run of the mill.A few pieces of lettuce probably shouldn't have made it in my salad.Very brown.Dinner was amazing.I had basic spaghetti and meat sauce.Bread was a nice touch. Definitely going back when in town..."}
{"text":"My fiance and I dined here last night and we were very disappointed. When we first walked in the door we were not greeted even though the hostess was standing at the entrance. She seemed very distracted and it took her about five minutes to even notice that we were there. Once we were seated it took probably another ten minutes before anyone ever took our drink order or introduced themselves. Eventually a woman came over, I still do not know her name because she did not introduce herself and she said she was a manager and would be taking our order because our server was running behind.

I ordered the penne with marinara and alfredo sauce with chicken which was a recommendation from the manager that took our order. My fiance had the lasagna. It took about fifteen minutes for our food to come out which wasn't bad but it was horrible once we started eating. The chicken in my penne dish was rubbery and tasted freezer burned and days old. Definitely not cooked fresh. The lasagna that my fiance had seemed like something that had been frozen for months and then quickly heated up in the microwave. I wanted to send my dish back but once again there was no server to be found. My fiance had to eventually ask the bartender to find a manager. Ten minutes later we finally had someone over to our table. I told her that the chicken was really bad and that I would like something else. I ended up just getting the garlic and brown butter sauce on spaghetti. It was not to bad but pretty bland and nothing to write home about. Overall the service was really lacking and the food was terrible. The only thing that I enjoyed was the Italian cream soda and the bread which isn't saying much.

I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone. If you are around Chandler Mall waiting to see a movie, go to BJ's or California Pizza Kitchen. Much better service and food."}
{"text":"Growing up, The Old Spaghetti Factory in Edmonton was a regular destination whenever we were in the city.  We always enjoyed it and always had a great time.  As I got older and became an adult, my visits all but disappeared.  I'll be honest, I missed it.  So when I moved to Calgary I jumped at the chance to go again.

Sadly, I've only been here a couple of times.  Maybe it's because I'm not a kid anymore, or maybe it's because they were never that great, but both my visits here and an additional visit in Edmonton weren't very good.  In all 3 cases, the service, food, and atmosphere were about average.  Certainly not living up to my childhood memories, but also not really living up to what I would expect without those memories.

I've noticed that the food is fairly bland and unimaginative.  They also never seem to get it right.  The service is decent, but not great and certainly not worthy of my repeat business.  The atmosphere is just terrible, although it probably hasn't changed much over the years.

But it's certainly family-friendly.  Maybe when I have kids, I'll visit again and the experience will be different.  But as a young adult, it just doesn't appeal to me anymore.  But hey, at least I still have those memories!"}
{"text":"Rated \"10 best family restaurant chains\". Fine, two reasons to hate it."}
{"text":"This is my favourite place to be for a meal with my friends and family.

The food portions are huge. The service is quick (for a bustling restraint) and friendly.

A great party place where everyone will have a great time while keeping the cost reasonable. Wish I could make it there more often!"}
{"text":"This place is a great little dining experience.  The Italian food was a true taste of Italy.  We were very impressed with the décor, the history, the staff and the food, of course.  They have all sorts of interesting dining options: trolly car seating, barber chair & table, brass bed booths, and stained glass everywhere.  A real treat and fun place to eat."}
{"text":"The worst Service ever.  The food was really good. Friends came from California we've been in for lunch and we had wait an hour for food because there was a table ahead of us I was doing a being crew located the course the guy doesn't come out and tell us tell her food should have been there then it tells us. She missed up on my order All for white sauce on all my pasta give me white sauce a red sauce and I asked if I could get the white sauce and ignored me and then before I got my ice cream I said I still wanted the white sauce."}
{"text":"Chicken Caesar Salad: hardly any dressing and a complete lack of flavor.  The chicken was a reheated slab of frozen chicken with soggy breading. You can save yourself the time and get a salad from McDonald's that's probably better."}
{"text":"Ending up eating here main because if was freezing out and I was in the hotel across the street. Food was shocking good, wasn't expecting much from the outside. I want to put that carrousel in my house brilliant idea for seating"}
{"text":"I can't even begin to tell you how good this meal was! Everything we tried was excellent. Their butter for their bread was great, the Alfredo sauce on the pasta even better! The soup was so fresh, and the ice cream at the end was just what this meal needed! There is a part of me that wishes I would have taken home left overs because it was amazing!! Definitely a place I'll be going back to over and over again!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at this restaurant. I am Italian and I always prefer my dad's cooking to any restaurant, but I love to try new places! Our server was great, prompt and very cheerful! I got a very basic spaghetti with marinara and I had no problems with it. I like that they include bread, soup or salad, and ice cream with the meal that you purchase. You even get to keep the glass when you buy a cream soda. Overall a great time and I liked the decor. I do wish the menu had some more options, though!"}
{"text":"Let me preface this review by saying this place is cheap!

Went here like an hour before closing on a Saturday night and had a combo meal. You get bread, soup or salad, entree, dessert, and tea for one price. We even had a drink and our bill was still quite reasonable. The salad honestly looked like it came out of a bag. I made the best of it and drizzled some dressing over it. The bread was pretty good, it was warm and came with garlic butter. I ordered chicken lasagna and was surprised that it was in fact ground up teeny bits of chicken nothing like the slices of breast I was expecting.

We had to call for our server a few times to come back which I get because they were closing. He was still really nice and gave us our ice cream and tea. The washroom was kind of dirty. Also probably the most jarring thing was the live band somewhere on the other side of the dining area playing and then a radio station on full blast also playing in direct contradiction with one another. Anyways, we paid for our meal and ask for to go containers for our leftovers. The waiter insisted he would do it, so we agreed. Unfortunately, my friend found a hair in her pasta after placed in the to go container. We didn't say anything just threw it out after we left but I'm pretty sure I'll never go back here. Once I find hair I am too disgusted to return and to be frank there was absolutely nothing memorable about the place just a little quirky with some Toronto memorabilia (there's an old streetcar and a phone booth)."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant quite a few times and have always really enjoyed it. You get great food for a very reasonable price. My most recent experience was this past weekend when my husband I visited. We were seated next to the bar and our waiter, Iraq, greeted us right away. His level of customer service was impeccable. He was attentive and asked questions that I really appreciated.

I ordered the Spinach and Cheese Raviolis and my husband ordered the Chicken Caesar Salad - Entrée Portion. Each of our plates cost us $11.00 and they came with Iced Tea, Sourdough bread, Minestrone Soup and an order of ice cream. The food is satisfying and the service was wonderful. We will definitely continue to visit this location."}
{"text":"This location has absolutely great service. Very fast, friendly, and accurate. Got our order correct the first time. Looking young and coming to a restaurant like this, my husband and I always get funny looks and less than satisfactory service. That did not happen here. I'm very impressed with the service. The cheesy garlic bread and spumoni ice cream are to DIE for. My only complaint was my spaghetti was a little spotty(hot here and cold there), but not enough to ruin my experience. I would definitely revisit this location."}
{"text":"This place came higly recommended, and it lived up to the hype in a few areas.  I guess you go here for the atmosphere and not as much for great Italian food.  The prices make up for the lack of great taste.  If you don't pad the bill with a big bar tab, it is really affordable family dining.  Dinner special includes salad, bread, entree and drink.  The entire family made it out the door for under $50, including tip."}
{"text":"Unless you have time for a three hour lunch, I would avoid this place like the plague.  People around us were walking out because they got tired of waiting for their food. Then to top it off, when the food finally arrived it was cold. Horrible experience."}
{"text":"I like their food but the service is horrible every single time. I've eaten here at least 50 times. I love their broccoli cheddar soup but it's only offered during lunch on Wednesdays. This past visit was sadly my last. Not only was my waitress not attentive but everything I asked for was an extra charge! One bread per table!? Really!? That's insane and I also don't remember there being a charge before. I asked for extra Parmesan cheese and again a dollar charge! We also weren't offered the salad that comes with the meal."}
{"text":"I used to have really fond memories of this place as a kid. I loved the decor and always thought that every restaurant should serve spumoni upon completion of a meal, but the romance has since ended now that I am an adult. 

In the past year I have found myself here often as a central meeting place that could accommodate a large group. In both of those occasions we had the save server who lacked any ounce of charm in his body and felt way too comfortable with the fact that his gratuity was added into our bill due to size. He was brash and acted annoyed the entire time and despite our size we were pretty low maintenance. 

Other than service, the food is doing little to impress me. It has become one of those places where I am never truly satisfied with what I ordered. Because their menu is traditional fare I find myself comparing it to every other Italian place I have been and none of their dishes stand out as the best I have had or even close to it. The portions do not match the price in my opinion and neither does the quality. I just end up walking away from dinner feeling a bit cheated by the entire experience. I wish I could fall in love all over again with this landmark, but it is going to take a lot to win me over."}
{"text":"I came here with a group of friends the other day. The food is really good! I got the spinach tortellini with white sauce, it was delicious! The wait time was 45 min, and the restaurant wasn't even half full.. kind of disappointing :( Other then that it has a great atmosphere and wonderful food!"}
{"text":"First time here and I must say sadly the last... for the price the service wasn't on point like cheaper restaurants.  Food was just Ok... soooo sorry but last time here."}
{"text":"We first found the OSF when vacationing in ca and were surprised to see that we had one in our hometown but no one had ever suggested it.  I now believe I know why.while a wait to get is not that bad,  they apparently don't do reservations prior to 8 pm. The wait was about 20 mins at 4 p.m.  The place was about 1/3 full at the time. The speed of service throughout was glacial. Server mastered the art of the is there anything else I can... and wandered off just as the refill of coffee was being requested. 

The 90 min 3 course, only 1 refill on coffee, a success rate of 1 in 4 requests.  Salad wilted,  flat and unimaginative, blue cheese dressing didn't appear to be blue cheese, I could have been eating a painting from daycare. 

Wife's side-order of chicken breast came out in chunks and some kind of marinade that wasn't requested._(Separate items on the menu)  Too many mistakes to make it worthwhile to enjoy the entrees which were better than average for the type but overshadowed by the main experience.  Slow, inaccurate and yeah their booths have little nails on them that catch clothing.  So ripping them a new one  is merely returning the favor.:P 

Ca service was great, all food was fresh and all orders correct it's a shame that can't travel east."}
{"text":"Food was good, service was mediocre, the server was disconnected with his primary responsibility of taking care of his customer.  Had Long Island iced tea but the server didn't mention that they added a blackberry flavor. It was fair but not a Long Island traditional.  Server should have mentioned that."}
{"text":"We went to Old Spaghetti Factory on Wednesday night with a large group (35 people) for a work event.  All I can say is it was mediocre at best, the service was middling and the food just satisfactory.  I'd probably be willing to give them a second chance with a couple or a small group but for large group events I would definitely steer clear."}
{"text":"I go to the Old Spaghetti factory on a yearly basis, because there is one single dish that I am addicted to. The spaghetti with browned butter and Mizithra cheese is to die for, and every so often I get a craving and drag someone down for a meal.

The staff are usually very friendly, and if you order one of the meals you get sourdough bread with garlic butter. They're very quick to keep giving it to you, which is great. The meal itself consists of coffee or tea, soup, the main, and ice cream for dessert. It's all in all not a bad meal, if you don't count the so-so food. And it's almost too much food!

But beside that one meal, I can't really recommend the Old Spaghetti Factory. The old, horrid decor and the so-so food do not make for a great dining experience. It's not the worst, but it is far from being the best either."}
{"text":"Pretty good visit. Not gourmet food but consistently good sketti. Bread is great too. Used to have one in ATL but closed down. We miss it, so when saw this one had to try it. Smaller portions and higher prince, but good. Glad we went. You must try the mizithra cheese if you have never had it. Mmmm"}
{"text":"We went to see the Murder Mystery show inside Old spaghetti Factory  on 3/26/2015 and most of the people there are friendly, outgoing and funny! However, when I first arrived, my husband was parking the car so they escorted me to the picture area.  The woman that was taking pictures (no name tag) said as soon as she saw me said that we would wait for my \"party\" which I expected anyway. I was very surprised at her abrupt behavior though especially compared to everyone else.  While waiting for my husband (so neither of us were doing anything) I told her that I really loved her accent, and I tried to guess where she was from, she was silent for a second and then rudely said \"its none of your concern\"   Wow, ok, I was quiet after that while we waited. The picture came out great, but I refused to buy them from her after she was rude.   The show was good and the rest of the staff was very friendly. I would go back, just wouldn't get my picture taken. 
A side note, we drove around literally for 30 minutes while looking for this place.. We only had our tickets with us which had the address, but didn't have the building it was inside of.  We passed \"old spaghetti factory\" several times.  Finally found it but we were late."}
{"text":"Heard so many reviews of this restaurant of how great this place is, but, never went. Luckily a friend wanted to do a secret farewell/ hang out for a coworker. The atmosphere is cozy and ambience. Many vintage layouts which is a plus for me. Got to sit next to a library of old books which was awesome. Fast services on the drinks, but, a bit slow on the foods coming out... but, who cares when you had a huge group with you to enjoy the dinner with. Ask the server to do a secret celebration for a friend early birthday and she did for me anyway (don't know about you, but, that is great customer services right there). The prices are decent, but, the portion is a tad small for those prices. Nonetheless, delicious and fulfilling. Would go again if given a second chance. P.S. order their Italian Cream Soda because you gets to keep the cute cup as a souvenir."}
{"text":"We had a nice time however the food was horrible.  Both my wife and I had the gluten free pasta and hated it. Service was good."}
{"text":"When you read reviews about The Old Spaghetti Factory, it seems that many people have fond memories of going here when they were younger, only to now discover that it's either went downhill, or perhaps was never really all that good to begin with.

I had only been here once, which was over three years ago and had never developed the urge to go back until recently. And while their knack for renovating old buildings definitely has its charm, I feel that OSF isn't really much more than just your usual franchise Italian food that is mostly on par with what you'd receive at Olive Garden.

The ever-so-popular mizithra cheese and brown butter is something that always tastes good on the first bite, but eventually, the cheese and more so, the butter, become so incredibly overpowering that I find it extremely difficult to finish. I ordered an extra meatball just to try them, which was just average, but cold.

Traditional spaghetti is just okay, using mostly bland sauce. Their whole three-course meal approach is nice, enabling you to receive a loaf of warm, but somewhat salty bread, as well as a soup or salad. Salad is pretty basic, similar to what you might receive at a place like Texas Roadhouse.

The ice cream is fine. Last time we came, spumoni was the only option, which I don't really like. This time, we were offered three options between vanilla, sherbet, and spumoni.

The food is cheap in comparison to a lot of places and the portions are pretty large, although some report that they were even larger in previous years. But despite this, that's not really enough to really earn them any more than a very generous two stars.

If you dig chain food made in bulk and just like eating in large quantities, then I'm sure you'll like it. But if you're aware of what other pasta options we have in Phoenix, then you obviously know why this would never be a top choice for most of the well-informed locals in Central Phoenix."}
{"text":"Pasta was a bit dry, but good flavor and I like that your meal comes with ice cream! Gets pretty busy so I would recommend making a reservation!"}
{"text":"If there was a button for negative stars, I would leave it here. I've been to numerous OSF locations around Canada, and all were better than this one. Our server was not very attentive, the pasta tasted horrible, and our server never showed up again until dropping off the bill. Definitely will not go back, place is a feed lot for kids"}
{"text":"I went to the Old Spaguetti Factory last night for the first time. Was looking forward to it but was disgusted to find a cockroach cooked in my food. Like on a piece of ravioli, mixed with the sauce. I've eaten in street restaurants all over Asia and have never seen anything that revolted me to that point. To add to our experience, the table next to us jumped when they had a cockroach crawl on their table. Manager was very kind and asked for my email so that he could get in touch. No one has so far. I will obviously never go back, even if they pay me to eat their food for free."}
{"text":"We went there last night to try out their food for the first time. We ordered a mango daiquiri, bruschetta, lasagna, spaghetti with clam sauce and marinara sauce.

Decor: we liked it because some of the novelty behind like a gutted train car, and cast iron spinners converted into a  dinning table.

Food: Bad

Mango Daiquiri had little to no rum in it. I know because my SO is very sensitive to alcoholic drinks, she becomes warm and, has a slight headache. However, she just drank it all saying the bartender probably skimped on the alcohol. 

Bruschetta - five out of the six bread slices was not toasted and (soft bread with tiny sprinkles of cheese) there was no cubes or cheese or meat, it was pretty watery. 

Lasagna - My SO kind of enjoyed it because of the toasted cheese on top. 

Spaghetti - TBH tasted like out of the cream of can clam sauce, and the marinara sauce was too salty. The paste was cooked okay, but the sauce is the essential ingredient for a pasta dish. 

Ice Cream - tasted it was from Breyers aka, not real ice cream.

Service: okay 

Server: we understand it was busy, but we barely saw our server, so we had minimal opportunity to voice our concern. Once the food was dropped off, he left and didn't see him for rest of our meal. It came to the point, where we just wanted to finish up, and leave as all the food served was not what we expected from quality or value. Our final bill came to 70$. 

We will not return because the quality of food does not justify their high prices."}
{"text":"After 3 years of not being here, three of us friends thought we'd give it a try. It was horrendous! One friend ordered the meat sauce, the other the Sicilian meatballs and I ordered mushroom spaghetti. The minestrone consisted ENTIRELY OF BEANS--no tomatoes, no pasta! The ice tea was so dark that it looked like motor oil! One Sweet & Low in one glass is usually enough but this tea was so strong that I couldn't even taste it! When I took a few bites of my mushroom spaghetti, I noticed it was extremely watery. I used some Parmesan to see if it became thicker and it didn't. Out of frustration, someone walked by and asked if every thing was alright. I said no! Told them how watery my mushroom spaghetti was and they credited my entree. My other two friends ate their food and although they didn't like their food either, they tolerated it. They left a bill for the $1.08 iced tea. My friend Sue said now we remember why we stopped eating here. Olive Garden has a special this week and is better than the Original Spaghetti Factory! If you want good Italian food, do NOT GO HERE!!!"}
{"text":"Food was underwhelming and generic. The atmosphere was nothing special, only highlight was a train car in the main room. If you are a train enthusiast, this could be your place. There was a 30-45 min wait even though the restaurant wasn't even half full. They might have been a little under staffed given it was New Year's Day. 

There are much better places I'd rather eat."}
{"text":"This is by FAR best value for american-italian food I've EVER gotten.

Lots of dining space and a interesting decor and atmosphere. Got seated pretty quickly for lunch and immediately got some garlic bread.

Looking at the menu, don't come here to skimp on carbs, this is a place to EAT.

The combo meals which come with a soup, a main dish, and a ice cream/coffee. In addition, the portions were HUGE. I ordered a seafood-fettachuini-rose kinda meal, but added in button mushrooms. The dish was jammed pack with shrink and scallops, not to mention delicious!

I highly recommend this for a american-italian food binge on a budget."}
{"text":"We had my daughter's graduation party there and they were AWESOME! Food was delicious. Service was great. Price very reasonable! Loved it would definitely recommend it highly!"}
{"text":"Omg we LOVED this place.  The charm and vintage decor totally won my heart.  The food was better than I what I've had at most chain Italian restaurants.  And the spumoni ice cream sealed the deal.  Amazing."}
{"text":"I appreciate the hard work the guys put in attending to a party of over 20people. Great work, awesome room for large party, had a great time. Ask for Henry he was  great!"}
{"text":"We love this place!  Great food and reasonable prices.  Something for everyone in the family!  Our service was a little off tonight, which is why I can't give 5 stars, but it's usually great."}
{"text":"Went to a movie nearby and stopped in here for a late supper.  Very glad we did.  Had been to other franchises in other places, but most of the ones we had been to have closed.  Our server Nathan was very attentive without being bothersome, even though we may have been his only table at this late hour.  We had the meals which included salads, and my wife had her usual ranch dressing and I had my usual honey mustard.  Salads were crunchy and fresh and we did not feel that they had been sitting for awhile and were fresh.  My wife had the angel hair pomodoro and loved it.  I was fairly hungry so I went for the meat lover's sauce over angel hair pasta.  Tasty and rich sauce.  We both had Widmer Hefeweizens to accompany our meals, and topped it off with complimentary spumoni  at the end.  A very pleasant and intimate late night treat!"}
{"text":"The old spaghetti factory is a place I would recommend when you are looking to eat a lot of average food. 

It is not bad nor is it anything special by any means but the prices are truly hard to beat. For 16 dollars, you get a pasta dish, salad, bread, tea or coffee and dessert. 

I would recommend this restaurant for big groups as it is very spacious. Would also recommend for children as it has a cool decor."}
{"text":"Dined there while on vacation, early June 2013. It is like our local Spaghetti Warehouse. Decent value. There were loads of school kids that entered when we did, three groups of 25+. I thought GREAT :(. It didn't affect our service or delay our dining one bit. I was impressed. Our server Tim was A+++. Asked us right off the bat whether we were on a timeline or had someplace to be in a certain time. Thoughtful to survey our needs. Food was B- in quality, but overall a very pleasant experience. 
If you visiting Toronto and are looking for a  good place, try this place and ask for Tim as a server. Hopefully his working and he will take great care of you."}
{"text":"If you're vegan and find yourself at the Spaghetti Factory, never fear, you'll still be able to eat! I suggest their bruschetta, it's a nice sized app, ask to hold the butter and cheese, there are some pasta options that you can easily ask to hold the animal products, I have never had issues in this area, the service is consistently good.

Why 3 stars? They never wash their salad leaves. These salads come pre-washed in large bags, kitchen staff dump them on your plate and that's it. Everyone knows you're still supposed to wash them!! It was very unpleasant to have sand in my teeth.."}
{"text":"The inside, atmosphere, and service were all great, but the food is terribly bland. Also, when we walked in on a Thursday night there was a 10 minute wait and when we were seated, there were about 10 tables open (which stayed open until we were done dinner). The only good thing about the food is the free bread, but I'm sure that's because they don't have to really prepare that. I ordered the meatball spaghetti, which was overpriced and very very bland. The meatballs were dry and the sauce didn't taste like anything. Not sure why they charge so much? I think it's a good place to take your kids to, but not a good place to eat out with friends if you're really hungry."}
{"text":"Delicious garlic cheese bread and toasted cheese raviolis!  Italian sodas with a souvenier glass may sound silly but I bought in because the contents were so good.  This is not pasta just thrown together in a plate for kids to be occupied and get basic nutrition.  This place is really good.  I actually think that for a spaghetti chain, they make a difference by taking extra care to present the dishes in a pleasant way and by selecting quality contents.  I am a fan of the themed space.  I sat in a trolley car and felt like a kid.
To tell you what to specifically order is hard.  I had the option to make my own dish so, I can say that my meaty sauce selection was married with a penne and garlic.  You wanna talk about something good! 
Right now...this is my fave spaghetti house."}
{"text":"After reading the previous reviews I was worried that I would also end up with bad service tonight. Luckily it was the opposite! Service was great throughout our visit so I guess it really depends on who your server is.

The Old Spaghetti Factory has a very quirky look to it. I've never seen any restaurant that is decorated like them. I don't really know what the theme is but I saw a subway cart while my boyfriend and I sat in the carousel. I found that our table was way too close to the table next to us. I was pretty much elbow to elbow with the next customer.

Tonight I ordered the fired grill Italian sausage with spaghetti while he got the traditional spaghetti and meatball. I thought it was a pretty good deal for what we got. All entrees come with either a Minestrone soup or crisp green salad, classic sourdough bread, Spumoni ice cream, and hot tea or coffee. We both upgraded our salad to a Caesar salad which was an additional ~$1.90. We didn't really like the Caesar salad. It felt chalky to me when I ate it. However, I did enjoy my main dish! It looked like an okay portion but I was very full at the end of it that I didn't finish one sausage. My boyfriend said the spaghetti and meatballs were okay but he prefers Scaddabush. The Spumoni ice cream was average, nothing special to me.

I've never been to the Old Spaghetti Factory before but I'm glad I got to try them out. If I was in the area I would visit again but there are better restaurants that serve way better Italian food."}
{"text":"My son and I were there this evening to celebrate my birthday.  Our server, Jace, was fantastic!!  He helped us to chose properly and our dinner was delicious.  He was very tall ... lol.  Will dine here again!!  I ask that Jace receive recognition  for his exemplary service!!!"}
{"text":"The mizithra was excellent as was the cheese garlic bread and for that and the ambience, I will give this place 4 stars. The Italian dressing on the side salad was gross so I'm glad I ordered the cheese bread. It's nice that the meals come with a scoop of sherbet, spumoni, or vanilla ice cream for dessert."}
{"text":"Lunch on a Wednesday.. It was average food. The interior is really interesting and the new exterior looks nice. 
The cream of broccoli soup tasted like it came from a can, maybe because the broccoli was overcooked a bit. I got the lunch portion of spaghetti, half clam sauce, half mushroom sauce, again nothing special. Overall it was ok but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat there again."}
{"text":"The food was not spectacular, but it was decent.  All four meals were adequate to good.  Service was excellent, very friendly and prompt.  The decor is way over the top, but kinda cool.  Like others have said, average food, fair prices, and great staff.  Don't expect fine dining, but good food and great service make this an overall good experience. 3.5 stars rounded up to 4 for the service."}
{"text":"I remember when going to the Spaghetti Company was something to look forward to. Back then (about 30 years ago) it was one of the few restaurants in town, so the wait was considerable. That lobby is still there with the same stand-up video games and circa 20s sofas (reupholstered of course) and the restaurant still seems to be a place for an adventurous child to find hidden secrets and exotic places. Back then the wait to sit in the trolley (since removed and replaced with a replica) was over an hour. As a child the mystique of its cavernous faux Tiffany-style glass-enclosed \"rooms\" was a wondrous delight that could now only be matched in adult scale by the extravagance of the Winchester mansion of California.

I've been back 4 or 5 times in recent months and am consistently surprised that for a restaurant that could seat a thousand, I must wait 10 to 15 minutes for a table. Tonight I was making my way back across the cavernous lobby to leave when I was called to be seated. I should have just left.

Once inside I discover why the wait is so long. Every table as far as the eye can see is covered with dirty dishes and glasses, but no one is sitting at any of them. How long they have been in such a state is anyone's guess, but tonight I was able to sit in the fake trolley and so was afforded the opportunity to see that only 2 of them were cleared throughout my entire meal. What a disgrace! You all should be ashamed of yourselves!

Our server was extremely attentive and did his job with careful precision and punctuality. The only major error was when he kicked a piece of trash in the small walkway between trolley tables to a nearby corner. Oh my God; I just wanted to get up and go over and pick it up. Was that a crust of bread??!?!?! When he first arrived at our table, I asked if he needed some help clearing all these tables. What a disgrace! He told me that when he walked in, there were 130 people waiting in the lobby.

The food was exactly as expected -- somewhere below the quality of an Olive Garden. I think someone else here may have made the same comparison. Pasta overcooked to the point it can just barely hold its form anymore; meat sauce so gritty you wonder if this is what Manwich tastes like. Meatballs well formed and of overall good taste, but spiced with powdered everything, and old powder at that. Parmesan passed my test with little recognizable filler and of good body. Didn't taste like sawdust.

Bread obviously ordered by the hundred thousand, and obviously arrived frozen and partially cooked, Shamrock style, with the finish in a quick-heat just before serving. The cutting boards still have a second indentation for the garlic butter, but none was served. The butter that arrived was nothing like butter, but instead a whipped watery creamy colored stuff that should be the last straw that finally convinces you to throw down your napkin and sue \"I can't believe it's not butter\" for false advertising.

The salad was mostly dismal. The only redeeming ingredient in the entire meal was the olive oil used in the \"balsamic\" vinaigrette. I had to take several concentrated bites to try to convince myself that the red-wine vinegar they were trying to pass off as Balsamic was not actually cleaning-grade white vinegar, but the olive oil was really nice. Never mind  the basil or parsley or the whatever-name-you-can-come-up-with tasteless flakes in the dressing that had to be at least 20 years old. Ew.

There are times when I wish I could go back. I wish I hadn't dined under the artistry of chefs who celebrate the creation of cuisine. I used to be able to enjoy this crap, oblivious to the talent that's out there. Unfortunately Phoenix is slowly but surely returning to its roots. Where is our talent? Surely it is not at the Old Spaghetti Factory."}
{"text":"My 8yr old daughter and I decided on eating here for what my daughter called \"a late lunch\" she had spaghetti and meat sauce and I had the baked lasagna. Needless to say we both finished our dishes, food was very good our waitress was very nice and helpful. All in all our visit was great we will be back real soon!!"}
{"text":"We dined in for lunch on a Friday.  Short wait and then we were seated in bar area.  Took about 15 minutes to get our drinks because our waiter was also bartender. It looked like a busted up antique shop but i guess that's what they are going for.  Garlic bread and complementary bread were pretty good.  I ordered a salad that was drenched in oil. Very hard to eat more than a couple bites.  Chicken in my pasta was definitely frozen and looked like rubber.  I'm glad i tried it but i won't come back.  Much better value at  olive garden"}
{"text":"Cause my nephew and niece enjoyed the decorative restaurant's food and atmosphere.
The attentiveness of the staff including our server would be another reason to visit The Old Spaghetti Factory again... 
Highly recommend for those with kids and looking for a restaurant in Toronto's downtown"}
{"text":"I've been to this location multiple times with family and friends... and this place never disappoints! My husband and I had our rehearsal dinner for our December wedding and the manager helping us out  was VERY HELPFUL. We got to choose four different dishes that our guests could choose from and the price range was definitely worth it."}
{"text":"I went here on a weekend night for a reservation, so I'm not too sure how the wait times or the host/hostesses are. However the rest of the service was remarkable. As mentioned before my party originally came for a reservation and we were late, however they were fine with it and even able to handle the change in people for our party.

Overall the scenery is very nice, I enjoy the amount of decoration and quirky use of table settings around the area. Props to any worker who had to find their way around there. Although the atmosphere was nice, it went from 5 stars to 4 stars because the overall lighting is really low and it was very hard to see. I found it a challenge to read the menu and even other people at my table due to the lighting. It was just slightly too dark for my eyes to adjust while I was there.

As for our server he was Tim, or Magic Tim as he refers to himself, however the name tag was too small to fit it. He was adorable and fun! We were celebrating a friends birthday, and although there wasn't any cake for celebrating, he was at least able to add a candle to the ice cream dessert. And we didn't have to go through all the hassle of showing id compared to some establishments. As well, we were even able to get our side of the restaurant to join in on the birthday song. Afterwards he even did a magic trick for us which was impressive indeed.

As for the food itself, it is a great price for overall what you're receiving. The pasta is delicious, and our servers made sure we didn't forget the specials that were available. Bottomless bread at the beginning and throughout the meal is always a bonus. Portion was not bad, overall after tip you're looking at 20-30$ per person depending on the items they choose, and if you choose to upgrade sides. I personally had a creme pasta (apart of the all inclusive menu) with a side of soup or salad and ice cream at the end included.

Overall it was an enjoyable experience and I will be returning! It is perfect for groups, family or even casual dates. I do suggest making a reservation before hand even if you don't have a full handle on the numbers and update/call them later with an exact amount. As well, if you don't know where you are, make sure to look up at the signs on the walls."}
{"text":"I've actually never set foot inside this restaurant, so I can't comment on the place itself. But every now and then we've picked up orders from Old Spaghetti Factory at work, so I can comment on the food. 

The entrees are as basic as it gets. This is definitely \"family food.\" Most adults won't complain about it, and kids will enjoy the simplicity. I recently had the Old Spaghetti Factory's Chicken Parm. I won't call it bland, but it's nothing that the average home chef couldn't cook up for their family. 

I will give the place credit for the portions. It's not expensive and you get a lot of food. While the chicken itself was not huge, it comes with Spaghetti, an entire loaf of bread and butter, and a side salad. The salad was way too plain for my taste, but at least I had a little bit of vegetables to go with my meal. It's also quick. Take out orders are almost always said to be ready within 10 to 15 minutes."}
{"text":"We received a gift card to this place for Christmas and decided to try it out.  The meatballs in the meatball sliders had excellent flavor, but generally speaking the sweet Hawaiian rolls they were served on were not a favorite.  Garlic cheese bread went over very well with the table.  The minestrone soup and bread were good, but the salads were disappointing. Our main courses were good, but the best part was the gelato afterward."}
{"text":"I love the Old Spaghetti Factory! I think it's very good for what it is (not a gourmet Italian restaurant - more of an affordable family restaurant that also has an interesting atmosphere). I hadn't been to an old spaghetti factory for probably ten years until going again about a month ago. The food was, shockingly, as good as I remembered, and it's still very affordable. (All meals include garlic bread, soup or salad to start, pasta main, plus ice cream and coffee or tea to finish.) And, the interior of the location on The Esplanade is really amazing - there is a full size carousel inside the restaurant, a caboose, all sorts of interesting antique knick knacks/signs, and a ton of plants. Really a neat place. Lots of families with kids, so if noise is a problem I'd suggest asking for a table at the back or coming later in the evening."}
{"text":"Old spaghetti factory:
6/18
So this being my first review for the blog, I wanted to be a little detailed and more intuitive to my review.

First things to note, this is my first time here, we were with a party of 10-12 people, and it was a family birthday and that may have been what happened with service or the overall experience. 

Let me start with the experience, walking into the restaurant was quite plesant, and seating wasn't bad for a get together, the warm home style atmosphere was pleasing and made for great conversation space with out interruption from to much music or background. So overall the space was great.

Let's look at the menu. Lots to choose from here, there were a few of us in the party so we did get to see a nice portion of how the plates were. I did enjoy the selection, and how most of the dishes came with the option for soup/salad, and the spomoni. It was nice to see that I didn't have to pay extra for a Dessert.

After looking over the menu I settled on the Number 3 Factory Meals: The meat lovers plate, and also ordered a garlic, pepperoni, and bacon bread. I usually order appetizers when with family as a conversation dish to eat and chat. After placing my order we waited for the courses to come out. 
It was about this time I emptied my drink. Let's see how service is..

The appetizer came out along side the Soup and sides. The appetizer was quite delucious I sprang for the extra toppings of bacon and pepperoni, which was a great choice, a nice smokey flavor on the bacon and not too greasy on the pepperoni. The best part was the sauce, that you spoon onto the top, it was like a warm brushetta with alot of flavor.

The soup, was a house ministorone, I found myself confused at what I was eating, even to the point of googling ministorone soup, to remember if there was suppose to be noodles in it. Sadly I even tipped over the cup onto my plate I search of pasta and all I found was a noodle less pile of stew veggies, as you can see in my picture.

Finally, the main course... The Meat lovers pasta.. I was impressed by the amount of food, but the service wwas terrible, I had asked for grated cheese and waited 5-8 mins for it to arrive. Almost like they took a detour. Finally with my food cheesed I dove into the meatballs.. This would soon to be disappointing.. The meatball was flavor less, only to be described as a round beef patty.. The Italian sausage was even worse, it tastes frozen and lacking any sort of Italian flavor.. After cutting up my meatballs and sausage and adding it to the sauce, I found covering it in cheese to make it edible with a bit of flavor.

Dessert- this was a nice surprise that it was included in the meal, but to tell you it was delicious  I would be exaggerating. The spomoni ice cream reminded me of egg nog, and worse of all after eating all that heavy food it just added to the mound of food in my stomach making me feel a little lethargic. 

I would rate the old spaghetti factory 2/5 stars, between the customer service, the food, everything.. I would go back and see if having less people makes a a better experience..."}
{"text":"The Old Spaghetti Factory is a great place to go if you want a good priced pasta meal. For three of us getting an entree (with a salad and tea) it was $64. The spicy spaghetti is really good and I would recommend this, as it's their specialty.

Our only issue was with our server. He said he was \"too shy\" to sing happy birthday alone and made a comment that they ID people now?! (I was a bit offended as the sole purpose of going was to celebrate my mom's birthday). She has a severe mental illness so it can be hard in public places, but when the server isn't accommodating it takes away from the overall experience."}
{"text":"Went here for my daughter birthday with some small children, there were 8 of us, we could not find much for the kids on the menu and IT IS NOT AN ITALIAN restaurant, they use some weird greek cheese that none of us liked and even though we ordered different items NOONE  was happy with their meals. To this day it is a standing joke in our home to say lets go to the old spaghetti factory because the memory leaves us laughing because it was so so bad."}
{"text":"The look of the building is really neat, but my husband and I both ordered the Chicken Parmesan and it tasted like hospital cafeteria food... not impressed."}
{"text":"UMMMM.....

the bread is the bomb.com, the salad is just a plain salad [nothing like Olive Garden]

annnd the chicken penne pasta with marinara and alfredo sauce was A-OK. It's a cute place and I really like the atmosphere...

there's really not much to say I guess. It wasn't so bad where I have to write a two page review bashing the place...but it wasn't so good where I have to write a three page review praising the place...

the end."}
{"text":"So, this Phoenix institution is not gonna win any awards for its food.  There are a whole lotta other reasons why we go here.  It feels like your grandma's place and my kids love it.  I've been going there for nearly 40 years.  The food is dependable and tasty and the cost is very reasonable.  Know that you are always going to wait in the lobby, even if there are several table available.  It's a good tactic."}
{"text":"Food is just o.k. We did get free ice cream for dessert, but I was not impressed with our entrees. Bread was good and service was decent. The restaurant was fairly empty when we arrived, but we still had at least a 20 min wait to be seated."}
{"text":"I only come this place for the atmosphere, cause the food quality isn't very good. The food is always watery, and tastes like it came out of a can. The restaurant is super big, and has a train car right in the middle of it that you can eat in which my kids love, so it's the only reason we go."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this restaurant has such bad ratings. Right when I entered the restaurant, I found it extremely cute! I love the cheesy decor and going in, I know the food won't be perfect but I wasn't expecting high end quality restaurant food.

I got the butternut squash ravioli which was delicious! A bit sweet but I thought it was fine. I tried a bit of the spaghetti and as I predicted, it wasn't al dente that's why I opted for the ravioli.

It's a relatively cheap meal. For around $25, you can get bread, soup, pasta, tea and ice cream!"}
{"text":"I had made reservations to this restaurant for 5:30 pm on a Wednesday yet still had to wait for a table to be free and received a pager. I was seated about 15 minutes later. The server we had was very attentive and informative, her name was Kianne. She was pleasant and helpful. The menu is here good but the food was mediocre. I have had better Italian food at Scaddabush and Mercatto. For a place that calls themselves the spaghetti factory - the spaghetti was surprisingly their worst dish. It was bland, the sauce was watered down and runny, and it had no flavor. The manicotti was nice though. The atmosphere was interesting and service was good but food can use improvement."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday that also happened to be St Patty's day. Not a good idea. But the wait wasn't as bad as I expected it to be. Got there before 5pm and we were seated by 5.45. 

We were lucky and got seated in the elevator. It was pretty cool. Their bread and garlic butter was so good. Bread comes warm and garlic butter just always taste good. All entrees comes with a choice of salad or minestrone soup. Got the soup and salad with house Italian dressing and it was delicious. 

Ordered the lasagna and spaghetti meatballs. Didn't try the lasagna but it looked good and portion was big. Spaghetti meatballs was decent. Our server was really good at making sure we got everything we needed. Would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"My roommate and I were looking for nearby restaurant that was close to campus, so we decided to eat here. Being students in college, we try to not eat a lot of expensive restaurants to say the least ha ha. But anyways, the restaurant itself is decorated really nicely. There kind of an old saloon theme going on which I thought was pretty cool. The food was also good, nothing too special but it wasn't bad. My roommate and I both got pasta which to our surprise was apart of their three course meal. It includes a soup/ salad, the entree, and ice cream. Considering how much food I had plus my drink, my bill was under $20 and that's pretty cheap to me! The reason why I'm giving 4 stars is because the food was pretty average and we were also sat next to this ceiling high stack of barrels that kind of isolated us from the entire restaurant. Personally, I like being able to look out at the rest of the restaurant and see what's going on, so this table wasn't my cup of tea. However, if you're in the mood for Italian, you should try this place out!"}
{"text":"Sorry but this place is not worth the price.  We were at the mall and needed a place to eat. We wanted to try something new so here we tried.  Last time.

Start with the food and the prices.  Prices are comparable to places like Olive Garden and other so called Italian restaurants.  The food on the other hand?

We decided to order garlic cheese bread and calamari.  The bread seemed more soggy than crispy and no taste.  He calamari was cooked well but noticed they were all the same size and shape.  Like the ones I buy at Costco.  The entrees came with salads that were covered with watery dressing.

My daughter and I decide to share the Spinach Tortellini with cream sauce that they tried to pass as Alfredo.  No taste and again, seemed like something I purchased from a big box store.  My son got the Chicken Parmigiana with Spaghetti.  He didn't finish anything which never happens.  He was hungry so he ate but he didn't enjoy it.  My wife got the Chicken Piccata.  Fried chicken with a balsamic like sauce, tomatoes, and capers.  It also came with some weird pasta on the side.  She said she like it but when I tasted it, the chicken tasted like it was cooked a little too long in old oil.

Too top it off, service was bad.  We asked for 5 mins to look over the menu but ordered our drinks.  We didn't see her for 15 mins.  We decide to order and this time it wasn't too bad.  Restaurant was not busy by the way.  During the meal, we drink our beverages but no one comes for a refill.  We finally see her again when we complete our meals.  She asks if we want our ice cream as it comes with the meal.  She brings us the ice cream, but no spoons.  Yup, ice cream with nothing to eat it with.  Of course we stop another passing waitress after waiting 5 mins.  My daughter and I just started licking our cups.  

Bill finally comes and we give her the credit card.  I kid you not but we sit there another 10 minutes until she comes back.  Grrrr.  Never again."}
{"text":"As we walk up I see the place has been updated so it's been awhile since I've been here... Two adults on a lunch date and we are seated in the trolley with families yay!
I start taking a look at the menu and seeing the price hike is a pretty big hike from what I remember. No thank you I don't want to pay for the facelift! Our server or lack there of was more interested in the other party seated after us so I took that as my cue to leave! Peace out old spaghetti factory I will not pay your prices it's not that good!!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed my time here, the prices range is always within reason and the food is good quality. The presentation of the restaurant and decor was also mood setting."}
{"text":"Totally the kind of place that kids get taken to if they get straight A's on a report card. Meaning that I appreciated the fact that there was a bar/lounge area that was relatively kid-free. The food was good, but just eh. Seems like an Olive-Garden kind of place, but with slightly less variety.  Ample parking, even on the nearby local streets. Overall not bad."}
{"text":"I love the lay out ok service was on the slow side don't know why long time to get drinks  as for the meal it was almost perfect except for the meatballs not a good taste to them  but to every thing else the food we had was  I recommend them and plan on trying them one more time before I put a X though them  so I give them a 3.8 star"}
{"text":"It was okay, and just simply that. 
The interior was unique, but the pac-man game was broken. : ( 
The desk person was helpful. They let you change out the combo meals without a fuss, which I liked. 
However, the manacotti had very little sauce and the pasta shell was dry. 
The spinach ravioli was decent, however the alfredo sauce leaves something to be desired. The dish was okay. It was good enough for 11 dollars but nothing special or spectacular. I probably won't head back on my own."}
{"text":"One word... Meh. This is definitely a chain restaurant. We came with a large group on Mother's Day and they had plenty of room (even though we had reservations). The eating area was very clean, although the men's restroom needed a bit of cleaning. It also has a very nice atmosphere.

The food was mediocre. We had the cheesey garlic bread for starters. It was ok. I ordered the Sicilian Meatballs with pasta and a side salad. The salad was one of the worst I have ever had. It looked old and was not green at all; the lettuce was white! On top of all that was way too much dressing. The Sicilian meatballs, pasta, and sauce were average, which is disappointing for a place called The Old Spaghetti Factory.

The service was great and our large group was taken care of well. This Yelper won't be returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"This was my first time to The Old Spaghetti Factory. I'm trying to decide if it will be my last. The food was good. The prices were good. The Minestrone soup was excellent. The service was....interesting, then confusing, then dissappointing. We arrived at 7:45pm and were seated in under 5 minutes despite it being a busy Saturday night. We got a semi private booth which was nice, but because it was next to the bar, there was no lighting. We literally had to use our cell phone flashlights to read the menu. Our server, Charlie, came up within 10 seconds after we sat down and the first thing he said was \"What can I get you to drink?\" We had just barely started to look at the menu (with our flashlights). I thought it was odd that he didn't welcome us, ask us if we had any questions about the menu, or acknowledge the lack of light even if there was nothing he could do about it. Just odd. Sit down BOOM what do you want to drink? We didn't get a chance to look at the cool beverage menu so we ordered or stand-by Diet Cokes because he was clearly in a hurry. Charlie then asked if we were ready to order. Wow, way too fast. I said \"It's our first time\" hoping Charlie would understand and introduce the menu, specials, etc. Nope. He said he was going to get a dessert order from the next table and hurried outside to what looked to be like a huge group. We soon realized that this group demanded all of Charlie's time and we were being served in the short 60 second-window he had between patio duties. The desert order must have been huge because we didn't see Charlie for a while. Finally we got our drinks. Charlie was nice, but his attention was obviously taken elsewhere. Since we didn't get order the minute we sat down, it was a while before Charlie came back to take our orders. Then he was back to the big outside group. No bread. My Diet Coke was constantly empty and no water was offered. He kept re-filling, but it took so long to get a re-fill. Finally we got our Bread, Soup AND Appetizer...all at the same time. And then Charlie was gone again. Now I promise this next part I am not joking, it couldn't have been more than 4 or 5 minutes after we got our bread, soups and appetizer - another server brought out our entrees. Seriously, we weren't even halfway through with our soup and hadn't even cut the bread yet. I'd had one bite of the appetizer and they brought out our entrees! Charlie must have wanted us out so bad in order to concentrate on his big party outside. I mean, who does that at dinner? Maybe in a lunch rush, but not for dinner. The server saw our table, and said \"Oh is this too soon?\" Duh. But we worried if we said yes, that they would just sit the plates under a heat lamp until we were ready. No thanks. So we just went with it. Our smaller, round table literally could not hold everything. We just wanted a nice dinner, but we were rushed through like cattle. I gave up hoping of always have something to drink with my food. We tried to make the best of it, because honestly the food was really good. Not great, but really good. I would rank Old Spaghetti Factory as one rung above food court pasta and one rung below Olive Garden. That's not a bad thing because the prices are very reasonable, especially with a little bowl of soup and a little scoop of ice cream. It's really good food. But oh my, the service. Perhaps our experience would have been different at another time with another server. Perhaps we just got caught in the vortex of a demanding, larger group in the same serving area. Perhaps as soon as Charlie realized we weren't ordering alcohol, and therefore not paying a big bill, he focussed on the groups that were, to ensure bigger tips. I don't know. It's always interesting to watch servers' faces drop when you order a Diet Coke. I watched disappointedly as a couple 2 booths down from us, who came in before us were served by another server who seemed attentive and helpful. I don't think their drinks ever reached the bottom before he refilled them. He offered fresh cracked pepper (which would have been really nice over my fettuccini alfredo), and it was obvious they had time to enjoy their appetizer and soups before their entree was brought out. I guess that's why I'm disappointed, is because I could clearly see what our experience was SUPPOSED to be like, but absolutely was not. We gave Charlie the benefit of the doubt that the big group must be very demanding to treat us like that. We gave him a normal 20% tip, even though the service was worth much less than that, because I don't believe in tipping less than 20% unless it's just a horrid experience. This was not horrid...it was interesting and disappointing. I wrote this note at the top of the receipt \"I'm sorry we caught you on a bad night. The food was really good though.\" Hopefully seeing a normal tip will help Charlie realize I'm not trying to be a jerk, but there was something way off tonight and he could have made it very different."}
{"text":"I love the three course meal concept and I almost always order the combo of Mizithra Cheese with Browned Butter and Clam Sauce. Both are incredibly good and addicting."}
{"text":"Una lasagna picante?? Un mesero que le tira a uno los vasos y cubiertos?? Si estaba bravo no trabajé! Muy mal!"}
{"text":"The cheesy breadsticks were delicious.  Everything else, not so much."}
{"text":"A group of us (adults, kids) dined there this past New Year evening (December, 2017), and enjoyed it much. A cozy, friendly environment with delicious food and plenty of choices. Loved their decoration (there was a bar there, too, but with two toddles could not check it.)
Recommend it for sure:)"}
{"text":"A generic name for a generic chain of generic Italian food.  There is a hint of Greek flavor in some of their dishes, due to a certain type of Greek cheese used in some of the pastas, but other than that, the dishes we had were just OK, nothing too special.  Their redeeming quality is that entrees include a drink, soup or salad, and dessert.  Entrees will run you around 11-15 dollars."}
{"text":"The atmosphere and servers were great.. But the food was not the best italian that I have had... The spinach dip was decent.. I got the No.1 The Premier (Lasagna and Chicken Marsala). 
The Lasagna was slightly cold and the chicken marsala had a rubbery/fatty bottom that I ended up cutting the chicken up and not eating it."}
{"text":"For Review 200 I wanted to take something from my bookmark list. I was downtown for the Herberger Theater and passed by the Old Spaghetti Factory. I used to visit the OSF in Atlanta and when I lived in Ohio. I remember always enjoying the experience...

Nostalgia is better than reality.

My friend ordered the fettuccini alfredo and I went with the garlic mizithra...which is a twist on the standard mizithra cheese & spaghetti plate I typically order. This added garlic, mushrooms and bacon. The food was good, but fairly average. The portions were smaller than I remembered. 

The sourdough bread was good - still warm. The restaurant opened in 1972 and I think they have been making salads the same way since Day 1. It was an iceberg lettuce classic and although I ordered blue cheese, it arrived with vinaigrette. Rather than send it back I kept the salad. 

Perhaps I arrived close to a shift change, but there appeared to be 2 managers on duty, both stopping by the table multiple times to ask \"is everything fantastic?\" - the waiter stopped by several times as well and said \"Is everything excellent?\" I like to be checked on occasionally, but too much is annoying.  

Another annoying aspect was the food had been on the table about 10 minutes and still was 3/4 full, the waiter came back and asked if we needed boxes or were we still working on it? Um...yes, still working.  Maybe it was because it was 5:30 and the lobby was crowded with others waiting, but I hadn't been there that long - and three minutes later when he popped back over and asked again if we were finished, well you just earned yourself a small tip and a long guest because my show didn't start for another 90 minutes and I didn't have anything to do. Deal with it. 

Finally I allowed him to take the plates away and we were brought complementary spumoni - I have to say that was the best part of the entire meal. Afterwards I swung by the restroom and that was a charming experience.  Big open urinals - at least it wasn't like the old pee troughs some places used to have - but there it was - a full restroom of guys looking like a locker room. I didn't know my spaghetti came with sausage. Yuck.

Overall - $31 for a hopefully soon forgettable dining experience.  The service from the waiter and the manager(s) was annoying and the meal average at best.  Some memories are best kept as that. I don't think I need to revisit this restaurant any time soon."}
{"text":"Food was fast and tasty today. Try the mussels! The service was prompt though the dining area was pretty quiet."}
{"text":"I love the old Spaghetti Factory, it is one of my favorite resteraunts. The atmosphere is really nice if you like a different mood set for dinner. The portions are huge so I was stuck with leftovers for 2 days but I'm not complaining!"}
{"text":"This place is so much fun. I have to admit, I come more for the decor than the food. I have a lot of happy memories here, and I love going out with new friends or bringing visitors to come see it. 

I think it is reasonably priced, and I don't expect anything too fancy on the menu. It's your basic spaghetti - some options have a few twists. I always get the option with the button mushrooms, myself. 

I really like their bread and garlic butter.. I'm always starving when I get there, since I usually go after a day at the harbourfront, so the bread is very appreciated while waiting on the meal. 

I can't say much for drinks here, as I don't remember ever ordering anything alcoholic. 

If you go for a meal with just the two of you, request to sit in the elevator. You'll feel special. Atleast, I think its awesome."}
{"text":"Not the greatest pasta out there. But then again, what is? I enjoyed the \"Manager's Favorite,\" where you can pick two of their five sauces. I went with White Clam Sauce and Mizithra Cheese and Browned Butter. Definitely very buttery. Like Paula Deen buttery.

The interior is fun. We sat inside a train or cable car of some sort. Not much else to say. Decent dinner. Decent prices."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and honestly each visit is worse than the one before, the food is tasteless and bland. The onion soup and mussels were decent. But their entrees have no seasoning on them whatsoever. Customer service could be much better as well. You feel as if you're dealing with aliens."}
{"text":"Go after the lunch hour. The noise level is lower from children.  The waitress is stressed due to little help. Food is good but nothing to shout about. Parking is a challenge if you want to park in the front or side. No discounts for military or seniors offered."}
{"text":"This place is an old reliable  restaurant and has a pleasant atmosphere. Reasonable prices   Service was not great but I will continue to go there."}
{"text":"Granted, this was my first time at the Old Spaghetti Factory in Toronto.  I'd recently been to the one in Vancouver and quite enjoyed it.  Toronto's is true to shtick...antiques, a tram etc.  I found it very engaging.  There was no end of things to look at.  I ordered the lasagna, which was ample, cheesy to the extreme, and a bit short on tomato sauce.   But it was very very good.  Service was prompt and friendly.  I hemmed and hawed about where to have dinner before the opera, and decided I was craving cheese and tomato sauce.  No better place.  The pub next door (Scotland Yard) was also quite nice and low key.  Dinner, BTW, was pasta, caesar salad, a coke and ice-cream:  $21.00   Not bad."}
{"text":"I love the cheese pasta and meat sauce they have here, I also love the soup, bread and ice cream that come with all the dinners. great place to grab a lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"They will forever be my favorite place to eat when I'm wanting pasta!
Let's start with the bread. It's alway fresh and the butter is easy to spread
Then the salad is great with the pesto ranch yummmm! 
Every pasta I have gotten I've never been disappointed with. My favorite is the mizithra cheese on one side and meat sauce on the other. AMAZING!"}
{"text":"I remember eating at the Old Spaghetti Factory when I was a little kid and I remembered that I LOVED it! So I was very excited for the new location to open in Chandler and I knew that I would definitely be by for a visit! I went to this location for the first time with my parents.
We ordered an appetizer, the Sicilian Garlic Cheese Bread (absolutely amazing!) and we each got a different entrée. My dad loves spicy food, so he ordered the Spaghetti Vesuvius, which ended up not being spicy at all. My mom got the spaghetti with marinara sauce, which had absolutely no flavor. I got the spaghetti with the rich meat sauce which was tasty, but it could have had more flavor to it as well. Of course the spumoni ice cream for dessert was delicious. But we were not that impressed by the flavors of the food. I think I remembered that I loved the food so much because I was little and I didn't like spice. I think that the food items here are much better for children.
On another occasion, we ordered OSF food for takeout while we were working. We got macaroni and cheese, spaghetti with marinara sauce, and the garlic cheese bread.. it was unanimous that the best thing out of all of those was the garlic cheese bread... needless to say we aren't going to be doing trade-outs with them anymore at work."}
{"text":"We had not been to an Old Spaghetti Factory in a mighty long time.  We had been to other Italian places including Olive Garden but for some reason had skipped this place.  What a mistake and it won't happen again.

The inside is beautifully decorated even with a streetcar setting with booths.  The server was excellent and so was the food.

There were four of us and we were all pleased with the food we were served and even the bill.  We felt it sure beat Olive Garden!"}
{"text":"I asked not to be put near disruptive kids. I get placed where they park the strollers and then a family is sat next to us with a boy that is popping his head over the barrier, staring at me. Yelling and kicking the seat back. Stop worrying about bullying when your little brats are ruining things for everyone around them. Restaurants should separate people. What you do is not rocket science. I complained to the idiot of a manager who only said \"fair enough\" and \"it's a family restaurant.\" Took my payment and 15%tip but did nothing in return. Thanks for ruining my evening stupid jerks!

All restaurants are getting very weak in their service. I'm sick of cinemas and restaurants that can't sympathize with the people they claim to \"serve\".

I was there friday the 13th of May 2016 around 7. Manager kept my comment card which led to this posting.

As to the response from Graham H - a couple on a date is not out for a community experience. The manager's tone of voice was insulting. He was basically laughing at me. There was nothing apologetic in his demeanor at all.

Disregarding my request was disrespectful. I was not disappointed when I left. I was furious. Your people mismanaged the whole thing."}

{"text":"One of my all time favs. Whenever I come to Phoenix I eat here and bring ppl with me. The food did not disappoint. I usually always get the 3 course and it is priced fairly. The ambiance is def fun"}
{"text":"It's a chain, but doesn't feel much like a chain.  But it feels very local, because it's in a historic home, and near downtown Phoenix.  It doesn't really feel Italian, more a local Phoenix feel. That's where the charm ends.  The food is about average, sadly I'd say below even Olive Garden.  And the service is totally hit and miss...  Service is sometimes great, and sometimes just dysfunctional teen who can't speak clearly.  Overall, It's only a 3 star, average.."}
{"text":"We really love the Spaghetti Factory but we're disappointed with our most recent experience.  First the positives - our waitress was quite attentive and friendly with the kids, which we appreciate.  She also got the bill right which sounds basic but more often than not is an issue.  The opportunities - the kitchen was not on its game, unfortunately.  The broccoli with mizithra was cold in places. Disappointing.  And the pasta with mizithra had very little browned butter sauce. Equally disappointing."}

This place is a joke and I will not be returning here. Very pissed off customer"}

I ordered the Chicken Fettuccini Alfredo....AMAZING!....better then Olive Garden...While I liked the bread..I like breadsticks more..... So that's just preference....I really enjoyed my experience here..  I highly recommend The Spaghetti Factory!!"}

{"text":"This was my second time eating at OSF, the first being about 7 years ago, but I had good memories so I was pretty excited. We had a group of about 60 going out for dinner after an event, and after two other restaurants couldn't take our reservation, OSF popped into my head as an option, and luckily they were able to take our group on a few days' notice. 

I talked with the managers a few time to figure out what would be the best plan of action for our large group, and we decided to do the family style dinner that was a flat charge per person, with bread, salad, pasta, and ice cream for everyone. We were seated in the banquet hall which is pretty nice at 3 long tables, and we had to wait a few minutes but they started to get everything rolling out pretty quickly. I have to say everything tasted great, by far better than a similar deal at *cough bucco di beppo cough*. I think everyone got their moneys worth and then some. 

The only reason I have to give them 4 stars instead of 5, is because when making arrangements, I was told that we would be able to have separate checks. Well, at the end of dinner, we got one check that we had to split amongst everyone, which ended up being a minor pain. But the servers were super nice and did the best to make the process easy and painless. I'll definitely be beck"}
{"text":"Henry the bartender took good care of me. The thing I like about the OSF is it's consistency. All the spaghetti was as I remember it. Plus,you get spumoni ice cream if you are a good boy!"}
{"text":"Had a nice dinner at OSF.  The staff was pleasant and attentive.  The food was OK overall.  Nothing too special, but tasty!  The building and atmosphere are fun, kind of a blast from the past.  I would imagine it would be a great place to take the kids.  Pretty sure we were supposed to get bread with out meal, but didn't.  The good news came with free ice cream at the end!  I'm sure I'll be back sometime!"}
{"text":"REALLY awful. We were sat across from the bar somewhat near the front entrance. Our server came and we both ordered drinks, he ordered a beer and I had a Malibu and pineapple. Once our drinks were delivered mine had a bug in it as well as a clear shard of plastic. Really..? You didn't notice that when you were making the drink? I let the bartender know and he got me a new drink which also had a bug in it. I sent it back and declined another drink. After receiving our food something caught my eye right above and slightly behind my boyfriends head. A swarm of gnats was actually circling near the wall that separated us from the servers walkway. I couldn't stop staring at them. I told my boyfriend but I guess from his angle and the light he really couldn't see the tiny bugs flying near his head. 
The prices really don't match the food y ou get. They really should lower their prices. The salad is pathetic with its place iceberg lettuce and basically no dressing.  The pastas we ordered were bland and tasteless. The only decent thing was the spumoni you get at the end of your meal. 
I was so uncomfortable here I don't want to ever go back. Every time my boyfriend asks if we should try them again all I can think of are those bugs and I veto the option immediately. We love RigaTony's and Oregano's; WAY better food, great service, and an inviting atmospheres. Please trust me and MANY of reviewers, just don't waste your time or money coming here."}
{"text":"Hannah was very sweet and attentive. I always come here to get the brown butter and mazithra cheese, very great food for reasonable cost. The restaurant is always clean and the front reception team is always very welcoming! Looking forward to the next time I come in."}
{"text":"Welcome to the Old Spaghetti Factory Toronto!

Apparently, the restaurant is housed in what was originally a Blacksmith Shop (built in 1898). According to 'teh interwebs\", it is an old warehouse that was transformed into a confusing 600 seat restaurant in 1971, filled with an eclectic assortment of antiques and artifacts. This is what the famous \"Old Spaghetti Factory is known for. 

Where else can you dine in a streetcar, a 100 year old carousel or a king size bed? How about beanstalk high ceilings complete with skylights, stained glass windows,   and countless other prehistoric artifacts?

This definitely isn't high dining, but our family has nothing but great memories here. This was our comfort dining spot for our vanilla-oatmeal-conservative friends and family, with a dash of quirky, freaky, bizarre and wacky.

I can't say the food is great, but the manageable prices, great location, in addition to consistent fast and friendly service make it our go to spot if we haven't made arrangements.

They are a simple pasta restaurant - hence the name, but another big draw for our family is that all their dishes are also offered with gluten free alternatives. Nobody is left out. 

Instead of them charging several dollars more for gluten free pasta, they charge a minimal 1.25 cents more. That's a steal.

For urban street art enthusiasts, Banksy hit this area and his work has since been preserved. I found it on Church Street, in an alley on the west side of the street, just north of The Esplanade."}
{"text":"4 or 5 stars for service and atmosphere. We came on Mothers Day and sat in the trolley. We had a big group, 9 adults and 3 kids. This place is so family friendly. I really appreciate that. The food itself was only okay. Garlic cheesy bread was delicious, the chicken piccata good, but the cheesy pasta it comes with wasn't great and that's one of their signature dishes. My husband had the spaghetti and, and it was so plain and bland. I do like how they give a scoop of ice cream at the end of every meal, that was a nice touch. My son's Mac and cheese also had no flavor. So just not enough to bump it up to 4 stars, but almost."}
{"text":"I just read other reviews, and I'm sad that I didn't get spumoni with our meal! Dessert is the best part of the meal.

Anyhow, I stopped in after shopping at the mall. We ordered Chicken Parmesan and Shrimp Garlic Fettucine.  The service was good, the food was meh.  It reminds me a lot of Olive Garden.  I feel like Phoenix has a lot more authentic Italian restaurants, and this is just a stop for hungry shoppers."}
{"text":"The service was mediocre, the food was awful! I ordered \"The Breast of Chicken Fettuccine.\" I got dry noodles with hardly any Alfredo sauce, 2 slivers of mushroom and the nastiest rubber chicken (clearly frozen and reheated) cut into cubes like I'm a 3 year old child. If you want delicious Italian food go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"Oh pasta... so great and delicious. I love pasta. I never read the reviews so I don't know what to expect. 

I ordered the chicken breast fettuccine. It was good. It had chicken breast, fettuccine, broccoli, mushrooms and the sauce was Alfredo sauce. I liked it. The person who was with me ordered some spaghetti with meat sauce. I tasted it and it was not bad. 

The best thing, in my opinion, pretty much every meal was a 3 course meal. You start with some warm bread to share (if you're with people) and then either a soup or salad. Then comes your dish. Finally you get either vanilla ice cream or something that is a mixture of pistachio, cherry and chocolate. I chose the latter and it was also good. 

The service was pretty good for what it was. Our waiter seemed like he was in a rush, not that he was rushing us though. He just seemed like he was getting overworked or something. Although he was so fast, he was not bad. 

Although this place is very good, I won't be a regular. I'd definitely come back though, just not consistently."}
{"text":"First impression: Beautiful presentation and friendly staff but, room for improvement. 

Recommendation: Clean the dust off of the air vents. Really dusty. I would worry about all of that dust getting in my food."}
{"text":"I came here with a group of at least 30 people during a recent business trip. Honestly the food is mediocre but the service is decent. I really want to give this place 2.5 stars but the food was just not all that.

B R I E F  S U M M A R Y
-- Nice big parking lot
-- Train stops right in front (I took it from the Westin)
-- Interesting old arcade but some stuff is broken and doesn't work
-- Chain restaurant & they seem to be all about the same
-- Service is decent considering 30+ people
-- Salad is iceburg mix = below average
-- Pesto dressing = their take on ranch
-- House bread is good when it's hot and fresh
-- Appetizers were just OK
-- Garlic cheese bread with marinara was probably the best
-- Olive dip was weird - not my thing
-- Artichoke dip was OK - thought it was interesting that it had shrimp
-- Meatball sliders were decent
-- Don't bother with the Lasagne, it tasted so processed
-- Chicken Marsala was way more edible than the lasagne but still average
-- Free spumoni was the best thing all night!

Sorry but I actually have one of these restaurants in my town. I would rate them all below Olive Garden in reference to food quality and taste. Service can differ, of course. I thought our server(s) did a decent job with 30+ people in my party. There were long pauses and then it was like the kitchen was pounding us with food. 

Originally I wanted to give them 3 stars but the food quality was bad. I couldn't justify an average rating for way below average Italian. I definitely would have rather had Olive Garden or a Mom & Pop's Italian joint. The appetizers weren't too bad but really just unfulfilling and heavy carbs (duh, it's Italian). My entree was really disappointing. I was able to put down the Chicken Marsala but the Lasagne was just meh. I could taste the greasy ground beef and it had no flavoring or freshness to it.

This experience just solidified my opinion on all Spaghetti Factories. I would pass if I were you but I'm not sure what other options there are in Phoenix."}
{"text":"If it wasn't for the tasty food, I would have given this place one star for service. The service was HORRENDOUS. We made a reservation for 5:15PM for 5 people. My boyfriend and I arrived after the other three in our party. Our server didn't come back for about 7 minutes and was really frazzled. She asked what we were drinking and mid drink order, she stopped us, walked away and then came back and said, \"I just can't handle this. I need help with my tables.\" No apology to us for interrupting and just walking away. She was very overwhelmed with 4 tables and I am unsure why. We were all super chill and the three tables that were seated roughly at the same time were all really close together and no one was rude or really needy that I could tell. 

We eventually ordered and received our meal. We had to keep asking for drink refills from the server and she wasn't really prompt with refilling water glasses. What is even more irritating to me is that she never once apologized to us for the way she acted. She was quite rude when we asked for anything and had no issues reaching over our plates. My whole experience was ruined by this one older server who truly seems like she would fit in better at a hole in the wall diner where her crap attitude would be acceptable.  

The food however, was great. Italian food is hard to mess up, but the food was reasonably priced and we received salad, some bread and a scoop of ice cream with every meal."}
{"text":"Very charming spot, reasonable prices and good food. We had a group with four children during a busy time and they accommodated us great. Nice to be able to eat with children in an adult restaurant
and not feel out of place.  We will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"So everything on their menu apparently is a \"fresh sauce\" but it's all premade. So if you don't like unions like myself, then oh well, that's half their menu. After going through 5 different dishes I couldn't get because \"simmered in fresh onions\" is apparently also a sauce, I finally settled on the fettuccine Alfredo with shrimp. Mind you this a $17 dollar plate. As someone to cooks on a regular basis, I could immediately tell the shrimp were microwaved. So I gave it a try and sure enough it was microwaved with garlic salt on top. It was like eating shrimp and garlic flavored rubber. The pasta looked like they cooked noodles and added canned fettuccine Alfredo sauce. Hardly worth $17 in my opinion. The only good thing there was how nice the waitress was. She was running two very large parties and dealing with me, so I felt bad so I tipped her really well. But I won't be going back there. There's nothing \"fresh\" about that place."}
{"text":"Nice meal out with the kids or visiting relatives, but the prices are high given the food portion and quality."}
{"text":"Very disappointing, from the slow service to the mediocre  food. Tasted like an average Olive Garden and I hate Olive Garden. The restaurant was 1 block from the Phoenix Art Museum so we decided to grab a bite before attending 1st Friday festivities. You'd think they'd done a better job on a busy night. I guess we should have suspected problems when we were seated immediately."}
{"text":"Not bad! Very nice decor and excellent service, but that was 3;00 before a rush so will check again! Appetizer menu is not much to choose from so we just ordered soup and salad! Clam chowder was good but small, and Cesar salad was good but lots of garlic! I liked the regular sangria and good prices on Sunday with special Cesar drinks! Martinis are 8.00 for double which is good price, but I didn't try one yet! Next visit will do a entree with martini and post new review! Thanks!!"}
{"text":"SO good! I honestly expected to be disappointed by mediocre food, but you can't judge a book by its cover! 

The browned butter spaghetti was to die for, and their caesars were also fantastic. My only complaints were that I wasn't a fan of the type of bread used in the French onion soup, we had to wait a few minutes to be greeted because there was no one at the courtesy desk, and that it was quite loud inside of the restaurant."}
{"text":"The last time I went here it was in 2003. Prices have naturally gone up since then. I ordered the Goat Cheese Agnolotti (Goat cheese stuffed agnolotti, sauteed red onion, sun dried tomato and mushrooms tossed in a pesto cream sauce). It was delish. Love pesto sauce. Not the best pasta I've ever had but it was good. I wish it had more goat cheese in the pasta but it was alright. It also came with a salad, drink and ice cream. Portions for the Agnolotti was wasn't very big as I was able to finish the entire thing. Usually I need to pack things home. I'd forgotten we get free garlic bread! Food 3/5

Service was excellent. Our server Tim was very personable and handled everything well. 5/5 He's definitely an asset to the restaurant. 

Would definitely be back again. This is a nice family restaurant. Great for groups."}
{"text":"It was OKAY , you can literally get the pasta sauce from a can some noodles from Walmart and it be equivalent to what they serve. The bread and salad not my favorite. Kind of expensive , I do like that they have ice cream included for some courses. Never really seen that on a menu  as being part of the course meal.... loved the decor inside , very spacious and cute. waitress was really nice!"}
{"text":"They seem to be declining over recent years but the Mizithra is so good we went back anyway.  Appetizer flatbread was fair.  Chicken parm was fair.  Mizithra was great."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to this new location of OSF in the chandler mall, and I'll tell you right now, I don't know if the other locations are this bad, but I will not be returning... If you're wondering why, read on, you'll see.


---Service---
We had a table of 10, which i understand can be difficult, but in a restaurant this big that seats probably 150 people or so, they shouldn't have trouble with a table of 10. We were seated promptly enough, and our waitress took drink orders while we were still waiting for half of our crew. Once everyone else showed up she took their orders, but completely forgot my friend. He eventually got a water, but by that time we were about half way done with our meal. When the food that we ordered arrived, my friend who didn't get a drink also didn't get his entrée. It came out about 5 minutes after everyone elses. My wife and I ordered garlic cheese bread as an appetizer and we didn't get it until 10 minutes after we were done eating dinner. The waitress said the kitchen was backed up, which I don't buy at all. She simply forgot to place the order until i mentioned it was missing, plain and simple. When the bill came we noticed that the two drinks we ordered were missing from the tab and we notified the waitress of her mistake. What she should have done was apologize for the poor service and numerous mistakes she made and comp'd the drinks and the garlic bread, but instead she corrected her mistake and she threw away an opportunity win some brownies points and any kind of a reasonable tip. Sadly, this had to be some of the worst service I've received at a restaurant in recent history.


---Atmosphere----
As far as the restaurant itself is concerned, they did a really good job converting a rather eclectic Mexican place into a nicely furnished and modern feeling Italian joint. Our party was seated closer to the front of the restaurant, and because they left the outer doors of the two doored entry way wide open, whenever anybody would come inside there was a giant gush of cold air that would sweep in, making everyone at my table cold while trying to enjoy out no-longer-hot food. What's the point of having two entry doors if you leave the outside doors wide open!! Seriously people. It was pretty noisy and chaotic inside as well. All the waiters and waitresses seemed to be running around like chickens with their heads cut off. The nature of the building also lends itself to being acoustically boisterous, that is to say, this isn't the place to come if you're in the mood for a quiet dinner with your loved one. 


----Quality----
None of this even speaks to the quality of the food, which is to say, quite sub par considering the prices on the menu. My wife and I ordered the whole wheat spaghetti with mushrooms and marinara sauce. The portion size was smaller than average for a $10 plate, and the sauce was way to wet and there was way to much of it. My spaghetti was drowning in a thin red soup. I've made better at home! My brother in law ordered the chicken parm and his meal was just as bland and boring. The serving of spaghetti he got was tiny, and the chicken breast wasn't even breaded, which may be healthier for you, but it's not chicken parm unless that chicken is deep fried and crispy. The salad we got before the meal was sub standard by any means, low quality ice berg with a few tiny croutons. The creamy pesto sauce that came with it was good, but not so good that it warrants drowning your lettuce in it (which is was). The cheesy garlic bread that we received ten minutes too late was actually pretty decent although a bit greasy for my taste. The sourdough bread was fresh and warm, however, don't expect to get a fresh loaf if the kitchen is out of knives, apparently they won't bring you one unless they have a fresh knife to give you as well. The ice cream we got after the meal was decent enough, I enjoyed the flavor of the spumoni, however, there were ice crystals in it, which leads me to conclude the ice cream tub had been left out and refrozen after a while, ruining the smooth texture it should have. There's no excuse for that. 


---Summary----
I don't give out 1 star reviews very often, as I'm usually easier to please, but last night it seemed like it was consistently one thing after another that just piled on top of each other. Eating here made me long for olive garden, which at the very least is quieter and as far as I can tell, has much better food. I can only imagine what the lease is costing them for that location, and I'm sad to say it, but I actually hope they go out of business to save anyone else from the experience of dining there. Maybe they can turn things around, maybe they can't. From the other reviews I've seen so far, it appears as though they're making a habit of pissing off their customers. So there's nothing left to say but good riddance, I hope whoever takes over that space next actually puts some thought into how to run a restaurant."}
{"text":"Beautiful building and inside the decor was spectacular. They have a nice big train /booth  seating ;which was cool. The bathrooms were clean. The waitresses  were so very nice  My view from the window was so memorable. I can say this place has a very nice ambience . 

Oh, I'm sorry I need to tell you about the food. I will make this very simple. Our food was overwhelming bland and tasteless .  It taste exactly like chefboyardee and I am being drop dead Fred serious.
Literally !!!"}
{"text":"I've been here and the Seattle location now... I regret both. The clam and mushroom sauce pastas taste like they're from a pre made Safeway jar... Noodles were horribly overcooked, salads were pathetically thrown together. 

Service was decent both times, the only reason they have two stars. 

Overall spend your hard earned money elsewhere."}
{"text":"I like the decor and concept of the restaurant. Staff are friendly and the wait for the food is reasonable. But I'm on the fence with the food. I had the cesar salad and vegetarian lasagna for dinner. I prefer a creamy cesar dressing but their dressing was watered down. And I'm not too keen on adding tomatoes to the salad. It was an interesting mix. My lasagna did not impress me at all. The pasta was way overcooked. It was like eating gooey noodles and the sauce was bland and chalky. The serving size was decent for the price although it was not appealing enough to make me want to finish the meal. My husband not wanting to waste food decided at the end of the dinner to box up my meal and have it for leftovers the next evening. My husband really loved his meal, angel hair pasta with white clam sauce. He said it was perfect along with his pomegranate long island iced tea. Maybe I was having a bad night, food wise. I would like to give this a place another chance. Just not anytime soon."}
{"text":"Today was my first time visiting the factor. Below are my impressions.

Environment: lots of seating, so the place is great for groups. Very wacky decor which I imagine kids would enjoy. 

Service: a bit slow. We were waiting a while for our server to show up and eventually resorted to flagging down another server to reach our own server. 

Prices: prices are reasonable given that entrees come with soup/salad, unlimited bread, ice cream and coffee. 

Food: decent selection of items particularly for vegetarians. I ordered the chicken lasanga and enjoyed it very much. I also loved the spomoni ice-cream at the end . 

Overall the place was pretty good minus the service at the beginning..

Tip - spomoni ice-cream is delicious.  Avoid the bruschetta if you want to avoid a mess....it falls apart very easily. A lot of food comes with the entree so there really isn't much point of ordering apps."}
{"text":"I love the Old Spaghetti Factory.   I have a few vague memories of eating at one as a kid, a college student, and now a full fledged adult.  

I came here last night with my date, and we took the light rail.  Walked in, and it was quiet, but it was also a Sunday night.  We only had to wait 5 minutes.  The hostess and what appeared to be a manager were taking names.  The manager was so funny and personanable...when the girl said \"what is your name?\"  I spelled A-M-Y instead of just saying my dam name....when he called my name he spelled Amy instead! ! LOL. Date and I laughed!

We ordered our food with our server, who was nice and knowledegable enough. But, we had to ask for our Bread!  For dinner I ended up with the spaghetti with meat sauce, dinner salad with Balsamic vinigrette dressing and it was tasty!  Date got a cheese pasta dish, and he said it was to cheesy.  O well.

Anyways, place and service was fine, will be back, and I still love it here!"}
{"text":"I love the Old Spaghetti Factory.  Growing up, I remember going to the one in Ohio on the way home from Cedar Point, and I always always always loved it.  I would go here in college as well, and I have so many fond memories here.

My friend Austin and I were hungry today, and wanted something different then the norm.  I suggested OSF and after googling it, realized that there was one right here at the Chandler Fashion Center.  this means I don't have to schlep all the way downtown anymore!  YES!

This particular location has only been open a year as of this month.  Place is huge, and decorated nicely!  Huge fluffy red chairs, chandeliers, large seating booths for big parties, and a big dining room in the front.

We were greeted by our server who took our order.  She was really good, and treated us great.  I went with the angel hair spaghetti, and my friend went with some other pasta dish that I can't remember.  We got bread sticks, drinks, and spumoni for dessert.

I would gladly come here again, as I always love dining here, as it brings back so many memories for me.  Keep up the good work OSF, I love you!"}
{"text":"The service was really good, the atmosphere is great but the food is nothing special. Its a tourist trap. Not worth the price although the pasta was really fresh... its just pasta. All the little upgrades add up too. 

The nice thing was we were in and out fast in between the GO station and the movie theatre at Younge Dundas."}
{"text":"Literally steps away from the light rail route, we spotted the place and decided to stop for dinner. No, it's not gourmet Italian food, but it is darn good for a spaghetti franchise. So, don't except what you had in Rome, when in Phoenix, this is where it's at.

With less Yelp food photos than photos of the restaurant, you know it's a cool place. They sat us in the stationary/makeshift train in the middle of the restaurant. Even though it was Happy Hour and that was only available at the bar, we were content in our super cool seats. 

It was a pleasant surprise to see Makers Mark featured in their star cocktails, including the Old Fashioned. Although I can't say it was anywhere near the best Old Fashioned I've ever had, this ain't Kentucky and I must give them credit for effort. 

I was torn on whether to order the clam cream spaghetti of ravioli and so was my friend, so I ordered the Gourmet Crab Stuffed Ravioli and she ordered the Pot Pouiri. I wasn't a huge fan of the clam sauce based spaghetti, so luckily she was completely content with her entire order and raved about it the entire trip back to train ride back to Tempe. The ravioli was excellent, but could've used a tad more sauce and wasn't as large of an order than I'd expected."}
{"text":"I definitely remember the food being better here when I was a kid. I came here for a small dinner party and I was really disappointed in the food quality. A majority of it seemed like it came straight for from the can and lacked flavors and texture. The easiest way to explain it is by comparing it to the school cafeteria pasta that we had when we were kids. I ended up giving this place two stars as the setting is fun and the old street car is really cool. Too bad you have to have less than 4 people to sit in it."}
{"text":"I have always had very good Italian food, good service, & great atmosphere.  One reason I have been here several times is because of the convenient location across from the Metro.  This place also has great history, having been here since 1972.  I would definitely recommend this place. =)"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service, why make a reservation if you are just going to make someone wait an hour to be seated? The food is nothing spectacular. Similar to cafeteria food honestly. The salad was dumped out of a bag onto a plate. Over priced cafeteria food at that.. I have tried this place twice now just to give them the benefit of doubt. I even ordered the spaghetti this time thinking that maybe that would be awesome since after all you are the spaghetti factory.. nope it's disgusting"}
{"text":"This is an American chain restaurant, which is decorated a la yesteryear in Little Italy. If you have guests over, its an entertaining place to take them to visit - but beware mediocre food. If you are looking for an authentic Italian, look elsewhere: lamb parmigiana is dry, none of the pastas tastes the way it should and the desserts are laughable. 
Their patio is nice on a good summer day, but otherwise might forgo it altogether."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of spending my Friendaversary with the lovely Georgie S. this past Sunday at the Opera. Because we saw \"La Boheme\" I felt it only right to get Italian food, so we headed over to The Old Spaghetti Factory in hopes of satisfying our pasta craving.

It was quite charming when our waiter came over with the bottle of wine that we ordered. It was the second most pricey bottle they sold (coming in at $34) and he told us in the four years he worked there he had never sold a bottle that expensive. Well, that's because you don't have high class broads like us patronizing this establishment, or so it would seem!

They have a good sized menu with a lot of delicious looking dishes. I was especially excited that they have gluten-free pasta! I was hoping I would be able to eat more than a salad. On that note, I must point out that your meal comes with salad, bread, your entree, and iced tea, AND spumoni for dessert! If you choose not to get the tea and dessert, you get to knock $1.50 off the cost of your meal. 

That means that my large, tasty plate of pasta and the salad cost me $6.50.That's right folks, dinner for $6.50!

The place itself is pretty charming. They have a trolley car in the middle you can sit in. The one drawback is that this place is very \"family\" oriented; something Miss G and I are not normally very \"fond\" of. But we dealt. 

Very solid 4 stars...."}
{"text":"the locations in California when I was younger and thought it would be perfect for him...it was! 

We came for his tenth birthday and of course, he had the spaghetti and he LOVED every bite. (He went with the version that had the mizithra cheese and browned butter sauce). They made sure to sing to him and bring a desert wich is always appreciated. My wife had a seafood stuffed ravioli and I had the chicken Alfredo and both really enjoyed our food. My daughter went the spaghetti route as well and we were all full and satisfied. 

The inside has a fun yet old antiquey type feeling and decor, pretty cool in its own way. We made reservations ahead of time and we're seated quickly. The wine menu was limited but prices were better than expected and we really enjoyed the bottle we selected. I really like the location they sat us at because it was mostly enclosed on 3 sides with a sliding curtain and provided a little seclusion and privacy and the server could just come and go. Overall a great experience and the kids have already asked to go back. 4 stars for our visit"}
{"text":"One thing that I love about OSF is that they offer gluten-free pasta for those of us who have wheat/gluten issues. The one thing that I hate about OSF is that you never know if they will actually have the gluten-free pasta in stock. Usually the server will inform me upon ordering that they are out of my pasta, which is aggravating but at least we can determine if we want to stay or not before actually ordering. This time we placed our order, received our drinks, ate our dinner salads, and then (a full 30 minutes after we placed the order) the server informed me that they were out of gluten-free pasta. Apparently the kitchen manager was on vacation and no one placed the supply order. So not cool. We just paid for our drinks and left."}
{"text":"I haven't been to a spaghetti factory since the one in downtown St Louis quite a few years ago. It turns out this location is very near my work place, but I hadn't noticed before. Love their spaghetti. Love the atmosphere. Went in for lunch with about 12 people. We were early for lunch so there weren't alot of people there yet. I had the meatballs. My favorite. The server was excellent. She took care of us all very well. We of course had all separate checks, which she handled impressively. She was very organized. Great job. I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"We enjoy going to the old spaghetti factory quite a bit. The food is average, but always tasty. Prices are good, staff is friendly, and usually it's quite busy. Call ahead reservations are encouraged on the busy nights, otherwise you could wait a good long time to be seated. Recommend this place to people who want a good meal on a reasonably price budget. Also great for families and parties.

Decided to come in again tonight. They had a BOGO and had been awhile since last visit.  This one is not starting off well when 4 people are standing at the checkin booth   The. We get seated next to the kitchen because a server was able to add us to his list of tables.  Should have just walked out then.  Server comes by and acknowledges us and says will be right back.  Yeah 7-8 mins later.  Then try to order house salad but with the dressing Casar.   Cannot do it without N up charge of 1.50. Ummm, say what.  We were not asking for the Ceasar salad, just the dressing.  Anyways, again did not get custom service.  

Since our last visit they have changed the sour dough bread and not for the better.  Also now using aluminum take away containers.  Not microwave friendly."}
{"text":"I would say this is a good place if you like market place atmosphere placed in indoor. They do have beautiful interior, including merry go around set, an old telephone booth and stained glass lights. great deal on food which includes appetizer and dessert, but I'd rather go somewhere else if I want better spaghetti."}
{"text":"The only reason I gave this one star because I had to put a star otherwise it would be 0 stars....we ordered the shrimp fettuccine got the salad at the same time as the shrimp fettuccine never got any bread only saw our waiter maybe twice he refilled our water just once terrible terrible service.... ask to speak to the manager he was somewhat helpful but not very apologetic or anything definitely don't recommend this restaurant and we won't be going back...."}
{"text":"The food here is absolutely disgusting! I ordered the lasagna and the sauce just tasted like a can of cheap tomatoes. The pasta was over cooked and my salad was cheap iceberg lettuce with Brown rust on it. My friend ordered the spinach & cheese ravioli and the sauce was seasoned with pure sugar. The bread they give you tastes like straight up yeast and is hard as heck. We saw our waiter twice, once to show up after 5 minutes of waiting to  order our food and drinks and another to pay our check. There's zero customer service here. The food is awful and so is the service. People who like this place obviously love bland under seasoned food. I feel like they only get business because they're located at the fashion mall. Please do not waste your money or time here."}
{"text":"We decided to try this place out last night. The inside is huge and absolutely gorgeous! I love the lighting and the caboose with seats. I also thought the service was really good. My only complaint  (and it's a big one) was the food. 

The price you pay for the quality doesn't match. We started with the garlic fries which were literally frozen fries heated up with minced garlic dumped on top. You get a \"free\" soup or salad with each entrée and we chose the soup which reminded us of cambells canned soup. I had the ravioli and it also tasted frozen. You also get a \"free\" scoop of ice cream which doesn't taste all that great either. I  say \"free\" because you're essentially paying for them with the cost of the entrée.  

If you want a nice atmosphere but below mediocre food this would be a good place to stop."}
{"text":"This is a great place to bring the family and enjoy great Italian good food at affordable prices!  The decor is amazing.....it brings me back to when I was a kid!  The food amd staff are great too!  I LOVE THIS PLACE!"}
{"text":"I personally love OSF, not because its authentic or high end, but the value and nostalgic qualities make it a wonderful option for dinner. My go-to-meal is the managers special which is a choice of 2 types of sauces. I like the mizithra cheese in browned butter and meat sauces. This is not healthy of course but oh so delicious mixed together. Each meal comes with a salad and I always choose the creamy pesto. Additional accompaniments are fresh sourdough bread loaves with garlic butter and ice cream at the end. Who can resist spumoni?

My sister is a fan of the italian sodas with the take home glass (the nostalgia part).

Service is usually very quick and is a much more enjoyable experience than dining at Olive Garden. Even the take out service or dining at the bar as a single is enjoyable."}
{"text":"I can't do it anymore.

I used to really like this place as it had a big plate of tasty pasta at a reasonable price.  First, the plate became not so big, then the pasta was not as tasty, and the price was not as reasonable as it used to be.

At my most recent visit, a normal visit with me and my family consisted of three mediocre meals.  The salad was lousy, the meatballs too greasy, and the sauce inferior to what you find in many jars at the supermarket.

$80 with tip--really?  

I'm not the only person to write a review as of late that is similar to this.  OSF, are you listening?  You had a good thing, and you are losing it.  You spent all that money renovating the exterior of the restaurant, and the quality of the food suffers.  Not good.  Not worth it anymore."}
{"text":"The inferior of the two OSFs nearby.  Nice ambiance.  The food and service ain't bad, but for the price that you pay for a single plate of food, this is just an okay pasta place.  You also have the tendency to still be hungry once your plate is empty and the bread all consumed . . .  

The Phoenix location is better by far--VERY FAR."}
{"text":"I'm a pasta fanatic and I've fond memories of this place from childhood, but the place really isn't very good. it's not cheap, service is (sometimes very) slow and the spaghetti mediocre."}
{"text":"Mixed feelings about this place. 

This is the type of restaurant that I like to drop in once and a while and eat a decent meal. The food isn't spectacular, it's just....okay. They serve up typical Italian dishes such as pasta, etc. However, that's what I like about it. The taste of the food is always the same and has probably remained like that for a very long time. The vintage decor definitely gives the place a more \"family restaurant\" kind of feel. 

I would actually recommend you come here. If your looking for a not so casual, fancy, mediocre restaurant, this is just the place for you."}
{"text":"This is a decent sized chain with great food, but what get's me every time is the extremely sensational atmosphere. This location has so much too look at you'll definitely find your eyes wandering as you eat, either in admiration or just trying to figure out what the heck that thing is over there!"}
{"text":"I'm giving a 3 instead of a 2 because there wasn't anything 'wrong' with the food or service but the menu options are bland bland bland. Perfect menu for a picky 8 year old. If noodles and some sauce is your cup of tea you'll like this place. The salad is lettuce and croutons with 2 choices of dressing. I wish I didnt pay for something I could easily make at home."}
{"text":"Yummy food, awesome service tonight by Michael. Best service that we've received in a long time. Only complaint was that the salad dressing was extremely salty. Other than that, everything was perfect."}
{"text":"2nd time I've eaten here, was just as impressed as the first.

The restaurant is absolutely gorgeous with a fun-spirited ambiance appropriate for families and groups. I took 11 friends from a movie we had seen over to the restaurant tonight.

The food was incredible - from the warm freshly-baked bread to the Spaghetti w Meat and Miz Sauce. Probably the best spaghetti I've eaten in my lifetime, and I don't say that lightly. Free spumoni and vanilla ice cream were a real treat at the end.

The service was slow however, and i found myself contstantly looking at my watch. Being with a large group made it tougher, as I wasn't the only one wondering what the wait was. Although the restaurant was not packed I believe our server had too many tables.

Definitely would recommend this to others, and hoping my next experience is a 5-star one."}
{"text":"Esplanade salata hem lezzetli hem de tatl? ve ek?iyi tek tabakta çok dengeli bir ?ekilde biraraya getirmi?, bir yandan çilek taneleri bir yandan balzamik ve kaliteli keçi peyniri uyumunhaka. Atmosfer de muhte?em!"}
{"text":"Nourriture très médiocre, digne d'une cantine. Les raviolis ne ressemblent à rien, mal cuits, farce sans goût (comme des raviolis de mauvaise qualité de supermarché), sauce ni bonne ni mauvaise. Rapport qualité prix très mauvais. Service qui vous donne l'addition et qui enlève vos assiettes quand vous êtes encore entrain de manger... Et le pire, je vous écris cet avis depuis ma toilette... À éviter absolument."}
{"text":"I've always heard such great things about this place. For some reason I had about as opposite interaction as they have. Was seated at our  table and waited a full 10 minutes for the waiter to introduce himself and order our drinks on a Friday at lunchtime when the restaurant was not that busy. I think he clearly forgot about us but would be more attentive with our meal. Offered  chowder (do not know the difference between Manhattan or New England) as an option for a soup and later came back to us and told us that he was out, that can happen but he should've known. The lunch was lap luster and his pressuring for us to get ice cream afterwards was not necessary. I honestly don't know where all the positive reviews get come from I will never be back."}
{"text":"We loved the atmosphere of the restaurant and the food was good, especially for the price. Our server was helpful and friendly with good recommendations. Chicken Parmesan is an excellent accompaniment to the bread and garlic butter. Make sure you save room for dessert. The ice cream is worth it!"}
{"text":"Pretty good i had the spicy spaghetti.it needed more chicken. I enjoyed my time with my boyfriend...my waitress was awkward.nice time though"}
{"text":"Great service and everyone loved their food. My sister didn't have enough sauce on her pasta and they gave her another small bowl of sauce no charge. A little bit on the pricey side once you factory size the meal with desserts. I would come back."}
{"text":"4.5 

I love it here. 

I used to come with my parents on special occasions to this restaurant and as a kid, I was so impressed by how whimsical this place is. 

The restaurant is a step back in time in Toronto history. The walls are lined with all sorts of old time memorabilia, posters, musical instruments, anything you can imagine. Equipped with a full sized streetcar and carousel, diners can enjoy a hearty meal at likely the most unique restaurant in the gta. 

The service is always really nice, I don't think I've ever had a bad experience. Servers and hosts are always very friendly and prompt with requests. 

Food is good, I usually get the spaghetti with meat sauce which, while not authentically Italian, is hearty and tastes like my non-Italian mom makes. The meals are \"all included\" meaning they give you some bread to start, a soup or salad and then an ice cream and coffee or tea to finish. The minestrone is my go-to to start, it's filled with veggies and has a nice flavours. To finish, I love the spumoni ice cream, which is a mix of chocolate, vanilla and pistachio, kind of a better version of Neapolitan, and I'll usually drop a spoonful or two in my coffee for good measure. 

From start to finish, I'm always consistently happy with my experience here, no-it's not gourmet Italian food, it's big portions, kind service and an amazing atmosphere that takes you back in time. Prices are very reasonable for a pretty upscale area, a meal for two is around or under $40 and there are drink specials every day of the week. I definitely have a sense of nostalgia whenever I come back here and it always makes for good conversation and a nice evening! 

Parking in the lot on esplanade across the street is only $6 in the evenings!"}
{"text":"OLD SPAGHETTI FACTORY is wonderful place.  I have never had a bad meal here.  All food comes as part as a 3 piece dinner.  Soup or salad, main entree and dessert.  Very reasonably priced.  
Just beware of the parking.  Very small lot."}
{"text":"This was my first time at The Old Spaghetti Factory. Now if your looking for true \"Authentic\" Italian cuisine this is not your place but if you're looking for Decent bowl of spaghetti with good portion sizes than this place is it! I ordered the Manger's Special. My sauce choices were Spicy Meat & Brown butter with Mitzitra cheese which had quite the favour I definitely enjoyed. The meat sauce I expected more from none the less it was a good meal with a sweet end to a delicious bowl of vanilla & chocolate with pistachio ice cream. Server's were friendly & the decor was a true unique factor."}
{"text":"I really like this place, it sure beats Olive Garden. The menu is pretty simple and straightforward, basic pasta dishes and a few other options.
You get plenty of food, soup or salad, your entree and desert for a decent price. Of course, this isn't authentic Italian food or anything, just really good pasta.
The interior is rustic, lots of seating and room in this hardwood floored refurbished old house. The decorations are old family photos and playbills.
But be warned, don't expect to be in and out in an hour for lunch. Service is slow for whatever reason. I learned after a few times that an hour and a half was the norm for lunch."}
{"text":"Food was miserable, Service was mediocre.
I ordered a dish with 2 types of pasta sauce. First time it came out the food was COLD. So after the waiter finally came back I asked for some HOT food, that took a while by which time everybody else was finished eating. Second time out they put the WRONG sauce on one side.
I ended up telling them not to bother with any food. It was a very quiet time, I'm sad they can't even manage passable food when they are not busy. I won't be repeating this again."}
{"text":"This is the kid's choice.  They love to sit on the trolley.  Ok dinners.  Nice bread.  Get a scoop of ice cream to finish.  Alfredo is a bit dry.  Service is 5 stars.  Ken is great."}
{"text":"First of all let me address the negative reviews about empty tables and wait time. The occupancy is 450 people. Do you think they have enough wait staff at lunch time for 450 patrons? No they don't. Moving on....

We went for lunch and there was a 15 minute wait which ended up being 6 minutes. Everyone from the hostess, waitstaff and bus staff were super friendly. I love the decor and the trolley! Our waiter Lidia was so sweet and attentive. 

The food was delicious! The meat sauce was a huge hit for our table. It was so flavorful. They do have gluten free pasta and gluten free sauce options. 

I really enjoyed the atmosphere, food and attentive service. The lunch menu was priced very reasonably. $40 bucks for 3 pasta's one with Italian Sausage (which was delicious) bread & butter and 3 side salads. You can't beat that!"}
{"text":"The experience was absolutely horrible. From our initial interaction with the hostess, the broken chairs in the lobby where we waited for 10 minutes despite the restaurant being nearly empty. The food was extremely BLAND!!! The extra charge for an unimpressive Caesar salad was a waste. Please avoid. I took family here and was very embarrassed. This place hosted a sad last night of visitors with very sad food."}
{"text":"Spaghetti Factory is the definition of family feed bag. They charge you a nominal amount for large portions of pasta with lots of bread and cheap food for the kids and lots of visual distractions for them as well. Not a dating place. This is a family place. Kids are running around full of candy all over the place. I am fine with that, but if you don't like screaming kids, or are too good for that sort of thing, then don't bother. 

Staff was very friendly. Food was typical but plentiful."}
{"text":"Visiting TO we dropped in for a late lunch on a Wednesday afternoon. The place was very quite, we had it mostly to ourselves except for a few other, probably tourists. This was great to walk around and take in the ambiance. Which is the main reason we went. I love the large Tiffany stain glass lamps and eclectic collection of historical photos and period posters. Not to mention the street car, something like an old phone and Mary Go Round that makes for very interesting seating arrangements. Easily accommodates large groups. Sadly the giant gumball aquarium with the gold fish was gone. The fish must have died of old age, I think my last visit was after a Blue Jays game, probably 25 years ago. 

      Food is average, good heavy comfort food. Nice on a cold autumn day. Lots of pasta at a good price. Forget \"super size\", you can FACTORY SIZE your spaghetti and increase your portion by 65%! Arrive with a hollow leg! They keep the bread coming as long as you want it have combinations with soup, salad and ice cream desert with most menu options.

     Very close to CN Tower and downtown Toronto, maybe a block from St. Lawence Market,  its a good location. They are also connected to two pubs, the \"Amsterdam Bicycle Club\" which is basically the bar side of the restaurant. They also connect to the Scotland Yard Pub (next door) internally, which looked like a very comfortable place to hang out. Its their sister pub so their share washrooms.

      The building really is an old factory, (black smith shop apparently) from the turn of the 20th century. I found it ironic the roof was made a sold timber, which today is called NLT, Nailed Laminated Timber. It's considered cutting edge sustainable technology. We are currently using some on a  college library project. I say ironic because there it was in an industrial building 100 years old. 

If you like Italian comfort food and fun atmosphere, drop by for sure."}
{"text":"I'll start by saying everyone who lives in Toronto should try it once. After that, I say you're on your own.

There's a lot of mixed feelings on The Old Spaghetti Factory reviews - so I'll try to be a bit specific. 

1) The atmosphere is fun - not great, but fun. It's just a little too unkempt for me, but it's still designed in such a way that you can enjoy yourself if you don't take the venue too seriously.

2) The food is plain. It's not horrible (I wouldn't liken it to toilet water!) but for Italian I would say it's very Americanized. I look forward to a bit of pizazz on my plate (if not in presentation, at least in flavor). You don't get that here. I feel that they stay away from too many spices in order to appeal to a grander audience, but in doing so disappoint people looking for a real Italian meal.

3) I got really drunk during a dinner with my wife and family, and I had a lot of fun. In this regard, the OSF is great. The wait staff aren't up on high-end protocol, but they know how keep you happy and give you your space.

I gave it two stars because of the menu, but the atmosphere can easily bump it up to a three. Like I said: try it once, then decide for yourself."}
{"text":"An old stand by in the Toronto tourist scene. Is it the trendiest or most modern? No. Does it have really interesting things on the menu? No. But honestly there is something to be said for comfortable and tasty. 

We went early on a Saturday and the entire staff was incredibly welcoming. Our server, Kurtis, so warm and polite. Very attentive. 

The food was good. I mean, it's pasta and sauce. For $16, I had a fair size dish of pasta with 2 sauces, bread, salad and ice cream. I really liked the brown butter and cheese sauce because it had a nutty flavour. Really delicious. The clam sauce was ok. The ranch dressing was surprisingly homemade and you can taste the dill and horseradish. Super yum!

Compare this to any other tourist driven restaurant in Toronto and you will find a better value here anyday of the week."}
{"text":"I think Calamari F. pretty much summed it up. OSF serves absolutely inedible \"Italian\" food that is far worse than the usual Americanized Italian fare you get at chain Italian restaurants like Olive Garden. I would have rather had seafood alfredo from Red Lobster. The prices were also very high. The only good thing about our experience was the \"free\" spumoni ice cream that comes with every entree purchase. Avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"Food was average, but they had gluten free pasta. Service was what brings the stars down."}
{"text":"We have always LOVE OSF.. in fact I've been going here since I was a small child and have very fond memories.. 
tonight we took our party of 9 our to celebrate our youngest daughters 19th birthday. I was SO disappointed in the subpar service and the mediocre food. 
I hope this was a one time problem.. but it feels like no one really cared."}
{"text":"Came down to enjoy a dinner.  Had to wait to be seated, but they must have just started staffing for dinner.  Server was personable and was prompted with our order.  Food was able and served hot.  Great tasting fresh hot bread, dinner even comes with s scoop of ice cream. From Mesa you can ride the light rail"}
{"text":"I was craving chicken parmesan and we were heading downtown for a night out so I figured I would give this place a try. it wasn't bad! there was a bit of a wait on a Saturday night but after one drink at the bar a table was ready. 

I had the chicken parmesan with alfredo sauce instead of tomato on the pasta and the bf had penne arrabiata. both came with salads-I had Caesar and he upgraded (lol) to a mixed green salad with cranberries and goat cheese. both salads and mains were good we were satisfied.

not sure if I would come back again though-its a big busy resto with screaming kids and scattered looking waiters. I feel like there are much better options in the area"}
{"text":"I recently had the pleasure of dining at the The Old Spaghetti Factory located on the Esplanade, steps away from Sony Centre and Maple Leaf Square! This restaurant is a reasonably priced casual gem located in the downtown core. The Old Spaghetti Factory brought back many childhood memories of birthday celebrations, family gatherings, first dates and hockey team celebrations! The service and food were excellent. The menu has not changed over the years, but the quality has remained the same. Thank you!"}
{"text":"In the lobby old school arcade and antique's, great ambiance for special occasions, spicy meatball awesome loved it!  My waiter was really cool too."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing!  From the atmosphere to food!  I was there last night for a birthday dinner for close friend.  This place never disapoints!"}
{"text":"We got seated right away and our waiter Simon was very friendly and speedy. Frequently came to make sure we had everything we needed. The decor was neat .I had the chicken parmigana . The chicken was juicy  and very delicious . The sauce on the pasta was very tasty as well I quite enjoyed it . The only down side was the penne (I got instead of the spaghetti noodles ) were undercooked and crunchy. Next time I come back I hope that they are a bit more cooked (not too cooked either ) Don't mean to sound like a mean customer because I really did love everything else. That was the only thing. Other than that I'll defd come back :):)"}
{"text":"Service here was excellent. Food was quite disappointing, tried the chicken breast fettuccine Alfredo and tasted the butter in the noodles more than the creamy Alfredo. Tried the garlic cheese bread and marinara was quite watered down with little taste. The lasagna was not worth the wait. If you're truly craving Italian find it somewhere else."}
{"text":"I've been going here since I was a kid and really enjoy the carnival atmosphere.  I feel it's best to go when it's busy as it adds to the experience with everyone enjoying a good meal amongst the hustle and bustle. This is one noisy place on a holiday Thursday night did not disappoint. I called 30 minutes before arriving as they do not take reservations and they put me on the waiting list. By the time we got there we only had to wait 5 minutes for a table. They sat us in the back room which was a bit cooler than the warmest part of the place which is the middle part of the restaurant.  They provided fresh bread along with plain and garlic butter right away. The bread was crunchy and warm. 

Our sever was super friendly but busy tending to multiple large tables. We ordered wine, chicken parm, and spaghetti with the butter and cheese and the mushrooms. The spaghetti with butter and cheese was outstanding--such good flavor. The mushrooms had too much tarragon. The chicken parm was very tasty with a thick chicken breast, though the cheese a bit over cooked. 

The salad was crispy with great thousand island dressing.  The vanilla ice cream was really icy, not creamy at all. 

Everything was served quickly, perhaps too quickly. It would be nice to have a bit of a breather between courses."}
{"text":"Nice family atmosphere with 19th century architecture. Reasonable prices with combos including soup or salad, bread with garlic butter, and ice cream."}
{"text":"Great value since most entrees include appetizer and dessert.  They also bring fresh sourdough bread with butter.

Enjoyed the atmosphere and great service.  There is a cute faux San Francisco Trolly in the middle of the restaurant that has booths.

Wish they had calzones, but I still left happy."}
{"text":"While most of my family had been to the location on Central, this was my first visit to OSF. We were all up for going even though it was no one's first choice. Everyone wanted to go to California Pizza Kitchen or Buffalo Wild Wings. I wanted to come here because I had never been here before.
Well the service was top-notch just like Lisa K. stated previously. This location was brand new and the staff seemed well trained and knowledgeable about the menu. Everyone was extremely friendly, personable and outgoing. The service made for a great experience.
The prices are very reasonable considering the entrees come with tea or coffee (not soft drinks) and spumoni included.
We ordered fried ravioli and cheese bread as appetizers. They both were delicious.
My dad and I each ordered the Spaghetti Vesuvius which boasts a spicy and hearty combination or chicken, sausage and meatballs.
The waiter even warned us that was very spicy. Not only was it not spicy, it didn't even have a slight kick to it.  The meat was used very sparingly in the sauce and the sauce was bland. Everyone else seemed to enjoy their meal. I tried my nieces spaghetti and meatballs. It was good. Not great, not overly flavorful but it tasted fresh, not fresh out of a jar.
Would I come back here? Yeah probably. It has a great atmosphere and is good for groups like the one I was in.
I think it would be worth giving another chance to."}
{"text":"As others have mentioned, the Old Spaghetti Factory has crap food - but otherwise it does serve it's purpose. 

If you have small town folk visiting from out of town, or families with children, this an excellent place to take them. Really, where the hell do you take kids in this city? They are unwelcome pretty much everywhere, so options are limited. Picky eaters will generally like it here too.

The restaurant is one of the biggest I've ever seen, I imagine they can seat up to 500. The decor is kind of fun in my opinion. What other restaurants have old carousel rides and even a street trolley? 

I came here with my brother and his family; the kids loved it!

The menu is bad and you know the food is going to suck. If you're trying to eat healthy, you're basically f*cked - so don't even bother. 90% of the menu is pasta, huge portions topped with fatty sauces. Bread served first with two kinds of butter and they are happy to bring seconds free of charge.

The price point is quite cheap, with full meals ranging between $11-$22, kid's meals at $6.95.

Service is friendly and quick."}
{"text":"Very cute resto and great comfort food. Felt like I was walking through some grandparents home. Went there on a Saturday night so it was packed but we were seated and served quickly. It's a big restaurant but it feels cluttered with all the decor and there isn't much space in between seating -you'll bump elbows or backs with other diners!

Complimentary bread and their homemade garlic butter was delish. I got the classic spaghetti and meat sauce for around 12$ which comes with a choice of salad or soup, ice cream and coffee or tea. The meat sauce could have been a little thicker but it was flavorful and the pasta well cooked. Simple yet satisfying meal. Everything on the menu looked appetizing so I would love to go back. Portions are also perfectly sized to finish but for an extra fee you can supersze it if you're feeling extra hungry. 

Family friendly with affordable prices and choices that are easy to please. Can't go wrong with this spaghetti house."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try this place for a while now and I have to say it was my first and last time I ever go here. Food was too salty, I got the Fettuccine Alfredo with chicken and broccoli I felt like I was eating a frozen dinner. Only good thing I can say is our waiter was very attentive."}
{"text":"Had a rather disappointing dinner at the Old Spaghetti Factory last night. It was for a small surprise birthday party of 7 people. We called a week in advance to reserve a table for 7 at 6:15pm. I arrived with my friend around 6:08pm and checked in at the front, told them we had a reservation for 7 for 6:15pm. He looked at us and told us he couldn't sit us until we had at least 4 people. I explained to him that it was a surprise birthday party and that the birthday boy is arriving at 6:20pm, so we would like to be seated so he won't see us as soon as he walked in. He looked at us confused and said he can't have people sitting at the table waiting, just in case another party without a reservation comes in, he can then give the table to them. I told him we made reservations in advance and he explained that he'll always \"have a table ready for us\", he just can't have us sitting at the table and waiting, so he'll seat us closer to \"6:15pm\"... as if 6:08pm wasn't \"close\" enough for him. So we sat down and I texted my friend to let us know when they're close. She texted me back saying they're 3 min away from the restaurant. I went back, it was 6:15pm then and asked if we could be seated. He looked annoyed and told a hostess to seat us. As soon as we sat down the hostess left and came back with a loaf of bread (with a knife stabbed in the middle) and literally (no exaggeration here) chucked it at the table. She didn't give us plates or anything just a loaf of bread with a steak knife stabbed in the middle. The rest of our friends joined us after a few minutes and our server, Jonathan, introduced himself. Jonathan was nice, we ended up tipping him 20% despite the horrible service at the beginning, since he was thoughtful enough to bring out a mini ice-cream with a candle on it. However, after going to the Old Spaghetti Factory for the last 6 years, we will not be going back. We will also be telling all of our friends about the horrible management at this restaurant and the rude waiting staff. Despite being on a lot of the downtown hotel's \"must-go-to restaurant\" and its cool vintage decor, be warned that the staff here is not accommodating, rude and ignorant."}
{"text":"If you have a chance go from Sunday to Thursday when they have full course meal for $25.  You get two glasses of wine, soup, appetizer, entree, and dessert for this price.  This is probably the best deal I have ever seen for a four course meal.  The food here is great and in a great location (right across the Chandler Fashion Square and Harkins).  Definitely my go to place for Italian in the East Valley."}
{"text":"I LOVE their spaghetti with meat tomato sauce! and the place really looks nice (an old beer garten, which they kept with all the typical settings and decorations) and tha place is not packed (so you can chat and ear yourself).
BUT.... the amount of spaghetti and, more importantly, of sauce is highly variable depending on the day and even the plate... whereas my GF had too much, I had just a small and clearly insufficient portion of sauce... it was obvious (so I could grab some of my buddy to make it \"equal\" and better), but that did not seem to bother at all neither the cooker nor the waiter... is it that so difficult to try being constant? to use a standardized spoon to put exactly the same and regular amount of sauce, so that customers can come back and back again and have the same pleasure and enjoy every time?
Another but... waiters all seem to be young students, who had not been hired by other places. Talking to each other, they were totally unconcerned about customers well being. Had to ask twice for the drinks, had to stand up and pick up myself the pepper. (had to equalize the sauce amount...)
Last but... final ice cream (chocolate-pistachio-vanilla) = ppppouaarkkk! (wheras I am a HUGE ice cream eater!)
Make a small effort!!"}
{"text":"Clean, beautiful, casual and great food!! I was one in a group of 11 that made reservations for an early lunch on Saturday. It's really cool that there are so many places that big groups and small groups can gather for a meal in a somewhat private area. I shared tortellini and Italian sausage with another guest. The plates were huge! Sourdough bread was served hot. It was so yummy. I would have loved to be offered balsamic and olive oil as a go with, but didn't request because of our group size. Service was impeccable! Our group requested separate checks, and we were treated graciously. The restaurant was not crowded when I arrived, and while waiting for others in our group, I perused the decor, dining areas, and lounge. I was very impressed with the cleanliness. The chandeliers sparkled, and I didn't see any dust or grime. This was a wonderful experience, and I'm looking forward to bringing my husband along for an intimate meal soon!"}
{"text":"Amazing!! 

Service and food were excellent! 

Atmosphere is great. We sat in the middle section, which gives you a great view of most of the restaurant. 

Staff was very friendly and knowledgeable. 

Since the restaurant is a SPAGHETTI Factory, make sure you order a pasta meal, they are delicious!! 

Definitely recommend to anyone and everyone of all ages!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has a lot of charm, it is one of the last few places in the neighbourhood from Old Toronto - everything else is new condos.  The dining area is uniquely decorated with stain glass chandeliers, an old phone booth, a streetcar, and a carousel!  

This is a good place to visit for families because the menu is very simple (Spaghetti everything) and is a really good value.  You get soup or salad, a main dish (Most likely spaghetti), and ice cream and tea / coffee for a very reasonable price.

Our server wasn't the friendliest server I've ever encountered but he got our orders right, and the food arrived very quickly.  The food was very tasty, but isn't like anything you would get from your Nonna's kitchen."}
{"text":"Spinach and cheese ravioli with Alfredo sauce instead of marinara is my favorite! And that darn warm mini loaf of sour doe is perfect every damn time. Love!"}
{"text":"The Old Spaghetti Factory is a fun chain restaurant where both families and larger, alcohol-fueled gatherings are at home.  I come from an area where \"red Italian\" menu items are commonplace, and mediocrity is the norm.  From this perspective, the cooking here is comforting and old-school; a notch above the ordinary, but nothing to get excited about.  Fortunately, portions are very generous, prices are quite reasonable and The Old Spaghetti Factory scores on that basis.  The lasagna was loaded with meat and just enough ricotta to balance.  Not enough mozzarella was buried under a thick coat of ho-hum tomato sauce.  Several other cheeses were (literally) throw-in's, the dish would improve with their removal or replacement with adequate quantities of garlic, basil, oregeno and/or onion.  Seasoning, in general, appears to be oriented toward their pre-school and geriatric patrons.  My coworker had the crab raviolli; it looked delicious, but a bit light on crab.  She did enjoy it.  While David was a capable and friendly waiter, the kitchen let him (and us) down.  Our appetizers and entrees were brought to the table within a minute of each other; completely unacceptable, and cause for the loss of one star."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic if you have kids.  It looks great inside.  There are lots of knick knacks for kids to look at.  The food is not bad, if you're not expecting haut cuisine. However, beware: you really should make reservations.  If you don't, you'll join the group of people sitting in the front lobby waiting for a table (which may remind you of the \"Occupy TO\" movement.)"}
{"text":"Food is so-so, nice decor, decent service. I'm particularly not a fan of their meatballs (taste a bit powder-ish), but maybe that's just me. Somehow costs more than you think."}
{"text":"Used to frequent this quaint place fairly often back in the day, and enjoyed my recent return just as much. They offer a great selection of pastas, which come in healthy portions (or perhaps not so healthy!). Most meals are also accompanied by a decent salad and a wonderful spumoni ice-cream. 

On this recent visit I went with the \"Tuscan lasagna,\" which did not disappoint - chicken was tender, just enough spinach and red peppers, ricotta, all slathered in mozzarella mmm...  

You will leave this place filled, and hopefully satisfied, especially if you enjoy the old-school but still classy vibe. Make sure to take a picture with the over-sized gumball machine!"}
{"text":"I don't eat a lot of pasta and I don't come here all the time.  However, I think the salad with pesto dressing and the garlic Mizithra (spaghetti with bacon, mushrooms, brown butter and cheese) are very good.  I have heard that the other stuff is good, too.  I have only been here for lunch, so I don't know what dinner is like. 

Sit in the trolley car -- you can ring the bell!

It is located conveniently off the light rail stop at Central and McDowell, near the Phoenix Main Library."}
{"text":"Great portions of delicious pastas and Italian themed dishes are a normal site at this lovely establishment. It's all decorated with carnival and carousel themed furnishings, and it's a really cozy and spacious place to have a filling meal out. All items are delicious but there are some tang are cut from a different cloth, such as the lobster ravioli. Delicious! Super size the meal for a few dollars more if you are famished. Will always come again ."}
{"text":"I went here with a large party. The servers did a good job keeping up with everyone. The White Clam sauce was outstanding. Very good pasta. The Rich Meat sauce also was good. Bread service was average, as was the salad. I'm not a big pasta person, but this was a very good meal."}
{"text":"If I haven't been here on a school trip 8 years ago, this place would only get 3 stars. I had such a magical experience the first time that I decided to come back. 

The decor was much nicer than I remember but the food wasn't as magical as the first time. I was with 2 people at about 2pm on a Saturday and we only waited 5 minutes to get seated. We were served a loaf of fresh warm bread with garlic butter. One of the best i ever had. I ordered spaghetti and meatballs, it says it's spicy in the menu but it was just a mild pepper spice. The main dishes come with soup or salad and I picked soup. There's no Parmesan shaker anymore and the meatballs weren't as delicious as I remember them to be, so the food was quite mediocre. The minestrone soup was nice. The bread was warm and tasted really good with the garlic butter. The Spumoni ice cream was great. Our server was friendly and fast but he unknowingly seated us where water was dripping slightly from the ceiling which wasn't his fault; the place is old.

Overall, great service, mediocre spaghetti, good bread/garlic butter, delicious ice cream and beautiful decor. Would probably go again sometime."}
{"text":"It had been years since I had been to Toronto and to the Old Spaghetti Factory. It did not disappoint. The food was delicious and the prices were amazing.  All of the staff members were friendly and polite. 
I ordered the lobster ravioli and was impressed with the large chunks of lobster. I will definitely be back, next time I cross the border."}
{"text":"I ordered the crab ravioli and it was really good.  The sauce that it came with was great but not enough of it as it only covered half the serving so if you order this and like sauce on your ravioli ask for extra sauce.  My daughter ordered the shrimp garlic fettuccini and it was good too. Her food came with enough sauce and the shrimp were super tasty. The salad was just lettuce and a couple croutons however, the house dressing that they substitute for ranch is some kind of a pesto dressing and is amazing.  Again, this is sometimes an issue of not enough dressing so ask for it on the side if you like your salad actually dressed.  The dinner does include some limited drink choices, salad or soup and a scoop of ice cream.  Overall a good value."}
{"text":"These guys are a great deal, if you know what to order.  All of their famous complete meals come with fresh baked bread (and it is great sourdough, providing you get a hot loaf), soup or a crisp green salad with choice of dressing (small upcharge for Ceasar), and a beverage (providing you order either coffee, hot tea, iced tea or milk - NOT SODA), and their signature spumoni or vanilla ice cream for dessert.

We went a little wild this time and ordered the toasted raviolis. Loved em.

Today's tip: Don't order the HEARTY MEAL larger serving if splitting between two hungry adults.  It ain't a double portion... no matter what your server says."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was wonderful... the staff was very friendly.  Me and my wife stopped in early to have a few drinks before the dinner and Murder Mystery show.  The restaurant and bar atmosphere had sort of an early 1900s feel. We had a very tasty Flatbread Pepperoni appetizer which disappeared very quickly. The Murder Mystery was fun but turns out not to be my cup of tea.  Although the maid in the play was very entertaining and talented, the spaghetti dinner was more of a mystery than the actual show."}
{"text":"Our server was very pleasant and kept coming back a few times.  Food here isn't the best but it's cheap and plentiful.  Most of their entrees give you unlimited bread, a well sized salad or soup and the main course.  Oh yeah, there's also a dessert included (ice cream).  It's mostly great for families and it won't break the bank."}
{"text":"Server... Was interesting. Mannerisms were improper. Did not warn of hot plate. Did not introduce himself. Did not bring us extra plate for entrees when it was clear we were splitting our dish. Seems nervous. Did not bring us ranch when requested. 

Crab ravioli had shell in it. I do not reccomend this and I will not be returning. List continues. Not worth my time... Advisory to anyone who trys to come here don't."}
{"text":"I have to be honest the chicken Parmesan here in the spaghetti and meatballs was actually very good.

I know this place is been around for decades but I have never tried it. I will definitely come back as the prices were very fair and the sauces are very good. Not to mention to Brett that they brought out was still steaming and excellent."}
{"text":"Food was decent, but the rating of one comes from being shuffled off to sit in the bar for dinner.  When will chain restaurants learn they can turn a table of one three times in the amount of time it takes to turn once for families, etc.  When you're a traveling businessman, it gets old that you're immediately shuffled off to the bar to eat dinner because you're not worthy of sitting in the 3/4 empty dinning room."}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't reviewed this place yet.  The Old Spaghetti Factory is my alltime favorite restaurant in the whole world, and has been since I was 3!  This is ALL because of their spaghetti with mizithra cheese....My mouth is watering right now just thinking about this dish.  With it's rediculously flavorful shredded goat and sheeps cheese (mizithra), and the warm brown butter and garlic sauce, this meal is decadent - but without the pricetag!  For $16 I can get this entree, with salad to start (their homemade ranch dressing is to die for), warm bread with garlic butter, dessert (spimoni or sherbert), AND a glass of wine.

The decor is also amazing - so unique and eclectic, it's got a really fun ambience - complete with dining trolley in the center of the room!  There are private rooms for even small dinner parties (I had a private room for a dinner of 4 once, and it was simply luck of the draw).  

The old arcade games (think pacman) in the lobby waiting room are entertaining as well.

Basically, if I were on death row, this would be my choice for a last meal.  I have no idea how anything else tastes here, because I always order the same thing, and I always leave completely, happily, satisfied."}
{"text":"I was suprisingly displeased this time around. It was my 2nd time there and it wasn't anything like I remembered. The salad was DRENCHED in dressing (which I hate) so if you don't like that, get your dressing on the side. All I ordered was the soup and salad lunch special. They brought me my first salad which consisted of, literally, maybe 11 pieces of iceberg lettuce, 3 slivers of carrots, 4 slivers of cabbage, and about 8oz of dressing!! absolutely disappointing. I ordered my second salad with the dressing on the side and, of course, they brought me a REAL-SIZE salad the 2nd time. They should have done that the first time. The service was slow as hell and they brought us 2 loaves of bread (bc we had a party of 7) with only 1 knife. It was retarded all around. Just about everyone else was dissatisfied with their meals. It was lunch hour, I'll give them that....but they weren't even busy!!! Never going there again :("}
{"text":"I had the food delivered by Grub hub. The lasagna was delicious. The bread is similar to sourdough. I ordered minestrone soup, but something similar to cabbage soup."}
{"text":"--- Atmosphere --- 
First time coming here - I live around the corner so I wanted to come try it out! The interior is very unique and lovely - there is a massive gumball machine and chandelier at the entrance when you walk in, and the restaurants have different unique paintings on the wall. There's also a cool streetcar and telephone booth inside as well. The booths were comfortable, it was great for a date night as the atmosphere wasn't too loud so we didn't have to raise our voices haha.

--- Food ---
I ordered The Manager's Favourite ($16) - I chose the mushroom tarragon sauce and browned butter and mizthra cheese (as recommended by our server). I liked the former but not that latter, it was too dry and tasteless. I would've chosen the white clam sauce instead. The spaghetti was good, nothing spectacular - but I think what a family style spaghetti restaurant would serve, so it was enjoyable! Reasonable price too. 

My partner ordered the Lobster Ravioli (22) and he got the Factory Feast (an additional $5.99) where you can upgraded Starter, bigger size spaghetti, and premium dessert or coffee. But the ravioli portion looked about the same size as my dish. It was pretty tasty! 

I think all the food aren't memorable but it's more of the experience in the unique restaurant and the \"family setting feel\" that makes it nice. 

--- Overall --- 
I wouldn't recommend the factory feast as I was very happy with my meal already (all entrees already come with soup/salad, ice cream, tea/coffee). I recommend coming here to check it out if you're in the neighborhood! :) The service was good too."}
{"text":"A good friend and I were in downtown Phoenix at lunchtime.  I was excited we might eat at one of my favorites along Central (Postino, Fez, Windsor).  But, since it was really my friend's day, when she asked about restaurants, I deferred, \"What did you have in mind?\"  She said \"How about The Old Spaghetti Factory\".  I tried not to let my lip curl in disgust (I dislike all chain Italian restaurants).  But, again, deferring to her, I said \"Sure, I always like to try new places.\" 

We were seated fairly promptly.  The decor was kitschy, but we had a nice table with comfy chairs.  Our waiter brought bread and took our drink order.  I asked if their iced tea was caffeine free, he said \"Oh yes, we brew it ourselves.\"  WHAT?!?.  Just because they brew it instead of taking it from a soda gun doesn't guarantee it's caffeine free.

Having been there before, my friend knew she wanted the lasagna.  Being Italian, I never order lasagna in restaurants as I know mine is better ( I make 2 kinds of lasagna, regular that just takes a few hours, and then the grand dame,  lasagna bolognese, which takes 2 days, with all the braising and creating 2 separate sauces).  I had a bad vibe theirs wouldn't hold a candle to even my \"lazy\" lasagna.  I chose spaghetti with mizithra and brown butter, supposedly their signature dish.  All entrees come with bread, soup or salad, and tea or coffee.

Our waiter took our order.  My friend asked for the lunch portion of lasagna.  The waiter replied \"Oh, we don't have lunch portions of the lasagna, just dinner size.\".  My first thought: it's FROZEN.  My second thought: nice way to up-sell buddy.  She had cream of broccoli soup and I had salad with pesto ranch on the side.  Our waiter delivered the soup and salad, but forgot the dressing.  He said he'd be right back with it.  When we flagged him down 5 minutes later, he was surprised I had no dressing, saying \"I told the busboy to bring it to you.\"  This must have been the same busboy who was so busy doing anything but his job that a nearby table remained uncleared during our entire meal.  Soon, he dropped off a small silver dish containing a pesto ranch popsicle.  Yes, the dressing was FROZEN.  I had to stir it so it would thaw enough to pour.  The salad was a big plate of pedestrian iceberg, cabbage and carrots with packaged croutons that appeared as if they had been chopped in half to stretch them.

My friend was sorely disappointed with her lasagna, saying it didn't taste like she remembered from past visits.  I told her it was probably because it was frozen pre-packaged, which was why they couldn't cut it into lunch portions.  My spaghetti with mizithra was so bland, I'm sure any finicky toddler or nursing home patient with a digestive disorder could have tolerated it (and I'm not insulting seniors or anyone with digestive issues, as my husband suffers from one, I'm just commenting on the utter lack of flavor in this dish).  Where's the garlic?  Where's the nutty goodness of brown butter?  I don't think what they used ever came from a cow, I'm quite sure it was industrial grade margarine.  

Sadly, even their bread wasn't all that flavorful.  It looked and smelled good when it first arrived hot to the table, but shortly after, it seemed extremely flavorless and the \"butter\" added nothing.

All I could think was \"Robert Irvine would have a field day trying to fix this place on Restaurant:  Impossible!\", then I remembered he doesn't work with chains.  As Daniel D alluded, Olive Garden would have been a better choice."}
{"text":"I love this place. I come here often and am always stoked when I get seated in the train car. OSF is a GREAT deal though, especially for a student on a budget. For 2 people, it's roughly $30-35 for salads, pasta, ice cream, as well as non- alcoholic beverages. 4 Star restaurant 5 Star experience."}
{"text":"If Fear and Loathing were a restaurant it would be OSF!
Honestly this place is an acid trip on a good day and the fake almost android-like waiters kind of make you feel like at any time someone might jump out from the giant telephone booth and yell \"You're on hidden camera!\"

But really, as Shari M. mentioned this place services its purpose. I prepared myself for mediocre food and I got what I expected. What can you expect for a $12 prix fix spaghetti meal?! 

My personal food mission is not to order things at restaurants that I can make myself unless they can make it better, so lets see how I panned out:

*Free loaf of bread: Not bad... and it's free. Don't feel shy about asking for a few more loafs, God knows I didn't!

*Garlic butter: Churned on location and probably the best part of my ENTIRE meal

Minestrone soup: Spoon goes in my mouth, soup gets spat out... nough said!

*The Spaghetti: I got the spicy beef... it wasn't spicy and the jury is out of if this was actually beef. I poured salt on this thing for a good minute in the attempts to give my spaghetti taste!

*Pistachio Ice cream: This place managed to fuck up ice cream :-(

If I had small children with me, that required loads of distractions I might consider this place again, otherwise I pass. 

If you do plan to come here though reservations and HIGHLY recommended."}
{"text":"Went for a quick dinner last night. Two of the dinners came out good but one got cold food. The garlic shrimp fettuccine was good. The person who received the cold food said the lasagna was cold and the noodles were soggy. The waiter took care of the issue and apologized."}
{"text":"Very cheap prices
No Wait time
Decor is unreal
It's like a museum
Sauce is great
No pork in their meat 
Super nice place
Great staff
Good food
Small portions :((("}
{"text":"I LOVE OSF and this one is awesome just like the rest. We went the night after they opened and had amazing service since they were overstaffed. Food was great - I had the Mizithra Cheese pasta, husband got the Meatloaf. The creamy pesto dressing is absolutely amazing - get a side of it to dip your bread in!

We went back in for our 2nd try and it was also great. The only bad thing is, I had bought a $25 gift card previously, and you get a free $5 coupon. I gave the server both the gift card and the coupon, and he deducted the full amount from the gift card, and we lost our free $5. I didn't notice until I got home unfortunately. So - just make sure your receipt is correct!"}
{"text":"Slow lunch service with average food and drinks.  Paid parking available on street.  Won't be back or recommend"}
{"text":"There's nothing special about the Old Spaghetti Factory, but it can be counted on for tasty pasta at a very reasonable price.  The OSF is great for groups or to get together for a meal that won't hurt the wallet.  We recently went to the Spaghetti Factory in a group of 12, and they were able to quickly accommodate.

They always bring complimentary bread before the meal, which is warm and smells great.  The garlic butter goes very well with it, although it comes in a stingy little metal cup and they never seem to bring more out.  If I wanted regular butter, I'd be eating bread at home.

Oh, and there's ice cream with every meal afterwards, too -- always a nice treat."}
{"text":"The food here is so mediocre as to be funny.  But the place itself holds a special place in my heart.  I spent many a high school half-day with my friends sitting in the trolley.  And I always loved the decor.  It was like walking into a mansion that is some old-timey wonderland."}
{"text":"We were there for a birthday party last night. Amazing server, great atmosphere but....the food was horrible. Wouldn't even pay $5 for a plate of spaghetti. It was a combo that came with canned clam chowder and a salad which the lettuce looked like it was from last week. Pasta was dry, bland, absolutely no flavour. We had to ask the server to bring us some cream sauce to pour all over it and even the cream sauce had no flavour. All the meat sauces and carbonara tasted like canned. Extremely surprised at the positive reviews? Maybe it was an isolated situation with our group? Chef was sick that day? Not sure...regardless it was HORRIBLE food with an amazing server :) really surprised if they can stay in business long term with this food quality."}
{"text":"Victor my server was great! I ordered the manger's special with Mizithra cheese and clam sauce.  Always good every time.  The restaurant was undergoing some renovations at the time but it did not impede in my experience or level of service I was given.  It's a great location and I'd be happy to visit again the next time I'm in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch today with a friend and was a bit worried that we'd be selecting a restaurant located within the mall, but was surprised to find that it was in a nice outdoor plaza adjacent to the Chandler Mall.. The weather was beautiful today, 90 degree weather but overcast so more like warm winds.. As soon as we arrived at noon we were seated promptly and the waitress took our drink orders right away.. Their strawberry lemonade comes with unlimited refills for $2.50 (i think?) and it tasted great! They even gave us to-go cups to take some extra with us.. All pasta entrees are $1.50 cheaper on the lunch menu so my spinach and cheese ravioli went from $9.99 to $8.49.. Still a bit pricey but they do give you a generous portion like at cheesecake factory.. My friend ordered the baked lasagna (which is her all-time favorite food) and she said it passed her test! All in all I had a great experience and my server was extremely friendly.. We even got an extra loaf of their sourdough bread to take home [: I would return here again for sure!"}
{"text":"The sausage ravioli was two spicy wasn't what I expected.and the cotton candy  limeade drink had the smallest piece of cotton candy on it"}
{"text":"A friend and I ordered for take out. The inside was really well presented. 

She had Brown Butter Cheese pasta & found it dry & clumpy with no butter, and little cheese sprinkled on top. Not satisfied. 

I had the seafood medley pasta & they overcharged me from what the site prices are which made me bummed. Seafood plates are typically more expensive but I found the entire portion was quite small for what I paid (the shells were left on the end of the shrimps, first time I've seen scallops so small, and were there clams ?). The bread was a pleasant surprise though. 

It did taste good but I suppose our expectations too high."}
{"text":"The line up to get a table on saturdays is huge, most people make reservations in advance. Families with children mostly. Had to wait in line for about 30 min, and when the hostess finally brought us to our table, it was already taken. She offered us a table in the middle, but we insisted on a booth that we asked for in the beginning. There was a whole area of empty tables, but she was not sure if she could let us sit there. After running around for 10 mins, she finally did us a favour and let us sit at the booth. And of course, she forgot to let the server know about us, so we had to wait another 15 mins for a server to come. However, the server apologized many times even though it was not her fault and after that the service was great. The food is good, a little pricey for a pasta, but you get a whole combo with bread, salad, ice cream, and coffee/tea. Overall this place has a cool decor and atmosphere, and is pretty big."}
{"text":"I've been there twice as of now. My first time I was WOW-ed.

The environment is truly interesting. I was looking everywhere. I love the carousel and phone booth. Even my second time around I was still trying to decipher what was going on.

Service was friendly and efficient both times. However, it was most exceptional from the waiter who is tall, handsome, and wearing 
dark-rimmed glasses.

The food comes in amazing large portions - this could also be seen as a downfall. I barely finished my pasta the second time around.
I ordered Spaghetti and Meat balls the first time - AMAZING.
Chicken Penne the second time - not so happy with that. My friend recommended it and said she enjoyed it. I, however, was not a fan.
In your meal you get soup/salad, pasta, ice cream, coffee/tea, and bread. Yes, it's a lot. If you get full easily (like I do), do not eat all of your appetizer and do not eat a of bread. Your main course will be worth it.
Also, I ordered a Bellini and didn't really enjoy it. I prefer my bellinis with a thicker consistency equivalent to a slush - this was more watery.

The only improvement they should make would be with their menus. It's in fact a simple piece of paper folded. With amazing decor, I feel that they should have a menu that at least matches the theme they have going.

Overall, I would definitely be visiting again."}
{"text":"I don't know why this place only has a 3 star average review. My boyfriend and I came here at 9:20 pm (40 mins before closing). I didn't feel rushed or like the staff was trying any less to give us a great experience. 

The inside is so cute! This is a very well put together restaurant. The inside looks as if it were an old hotel, turned into a restaurant. Lots of cute decor and signs everywhere.

The food was good! Not the best in town, but definitely a great deal for the prices and for being a downtown restaurant. The cocktail I ordered was so-so, but good enough to wear I didn't feel like it was a waste of money. I really enjoyed this place and it was great for a quick make shift date for my boyfriend and I!"}
{"text":"Good old family restaurant, been around forever. 
I wouldn't say its the best Italian restaurant in Calgary but consistent. 
Our service was great, but the place wasn't very busy for a Monday night.
Great place to take the family, as it is kid friendly."}
{"text":"So I had finally gotten around to getting to this place after I have been meaning to for ages. I came here on a Sunday afternoon.... it was after a Diamondback game and it was Father's Day so it was a pretty long wait, but that's my fault for not making reservations. I ordered the ravioli and spaghetti combo. Both were amazing, and after I finished that I was just about stuffed. It came with bread, a nice salad, and ice cream. I chose the chocolate cherry pistachio flavor and wow was it good. It was about $50 for me and my dinner companion who ordered the Alfredo which was also very good. I think I still prefer Red Devil, but OSF is pretty good indeed."}
{"text":"Always heard good things about OSF but had never been. I went for lunch with some work colleagues. I got the chicken fettuccine, which was really good, but after trying a bite of the lasagna I actually made an order to go. So good!

The service was good. They're not too busy during lunch as most seem to go for dinner. The waitress convinced all 6 of us to get the spumoni ice cream for dessert, which was really good, and then she surprised us by not charging us for them. That was really cool. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The food is great, the decor is so-so. Sometimes I wonder how long it's been since some of the display items have been cleaned. Makes me a little leary of what other corners they might be cutting, but have never really had a problem with food quality of service."}
{"text":"I have been here twice now and each time was disappointing, the outside of the building gives this rustic homemade italian food appearance and I wound up eating lukewarm microwave quality tv dinner style dog food. the service was worse than the food. Honestly we were told we would have a table in five minutes and were allowed to wait at the bar. fifteen minutes later we finally received attention enough to place a nonchalant drink order, which didn't come to fruition for another five minutes. my girlfriend and i were ghosts. never coming back."}
{"text":"A friend had a wedding rehearsal dinner here and it was held in the back room. Large room with really high ceilings.

Staff was great and very attentive to all of us. Never skipped a beat in making our dinner experience great.

Food was good and they serve you plenty of it.

Had the lasagna and even tried my friends chicken marsala and side spaghetti with white sauce.

Place is huge, big dining area, bathrooms were clean.

Plenty of mall parking right behind the restaurant."}
{"text":"I can't say I will be going here very often but it is another option for me when i want a nice dinner that is gluten free.  

I was impressed that we mentioned gluten free and the waiter gave me some options, he even remembered no croutons on my salad and the item I ordered had a gluten item on it so they substituted something else in it's place.  

The food was good and I have to say the pasta was really good because I've made my own and well this was a LOT better.  It was the perfect consistency I just wasn't impressed with one of the toppings because it made the dish very dry.  I ordered the Pot Pourri forgetting that the clam sauce would have gluten in it and substituted with the browned butter and Mizithra cheese which was really dry to me.  The Marinara sauce was good and added some flavor to the dish which I thought it was missing with the other item.  

This is a great family restaurant and the staff is really nice and friendly.  For the price of the food and the service you really can't beat it."}
{"text":"The waitress was wonderful, atmosphere definitely entertaining, but the food was bland and boring... this restaurant has been in the same place for nearly fifty years. My family really enjoyed their time here... I enjoyed their company, but would probably never recommend anyone to attend here; unless they're looking for that family atmosphere restaurant with basic food."}
{"text":"My family and I went in for lunch. Good food, nice lunch prices. Loved the ambiance. Our waitress was very attentive and the food arrived quickly. the sourdough bread was really tasty. We will return again."}
{"text":"By far my favorite restaurant in the valley. Great food and staff with enough bang for your buck. if you are unsure of what to order you really can't go wrong with a classic!"}
{"text":"I keep wanting this place to be better, especially at pasta dishes. It's kitschy, convenient, affordable. It is not inspiring, memorable, or even current. Maybe Robert Irvine could pay a visit"}
{"text":"My Favorite place to go for spaghetti in Toronto!  A lot of good childhood memories of this place and to this day they never disappoint! Great portions!  Spaghetti and meatballs still my favorite!  Super fun place to take kids also!.Service is okay mediocre at times!"}
{"text":"Tried this place today to answer my pasta crave. I was impressed with their spicy spaghetti Vesuvius. Now, I'm a big fan of spicy foods of different ethnic cuisines, so I didn't find it close to being spicy but I loved the dish. The sauce was sweet and garlicky but not overbearingly sweet. Entrées came with choice of salad or soup, bread and butter, and desert. Service was great! Waitress was attentive and friendly. They have a full bar so I tried their mojito which was made just right. I highly recommend it to others and I kinda want to go back soon... Like, tomorrow!!"}
{"text":"This is basically an off brand cheese cake factory. It took the wait staff twenty minutes to get me water and they do this weird thing where they bring bread sticks in knives. Totally unprofessional. The food was similar to what I cooked myself in college and the price was quite high in comparison to the quality of food. The only reason I would even consider coming back is because our waiter Bernard was super chill. Will probably not come back"}
{"text":"I love this place. Its great to bring out of towner's or the family for a reasonably priced meal that you usually have left-overs of the next day. 
The fresh bread is awesome. My  family still raves about the broccoli dish ( not a veggie fan so I'll take their word). All of the pasta dishes are amazing and the spumoni is a great way to end.
The atmosphere has been covered by many, but let me just say it really does make the place worth the trip and the service is always attentive.

There's a reason we usually have to wait to get in (because they are doing something right), and its always worth it."}
{"text":"Everything here was good from beginning to end.  My server was quick and efficient. My salad and bread were served quickly and my meal was delicious. I highly recommend the lasagna."}
{"text":"Recently we had our company party here. I absolutely love this huge old building. Inside of the place is so unique. It's almost like a museum. But the food is not that great. Prices are cheap. So I still gave it a 4 star because it's a neat experience."}
{"text":"We called for reservations for a party of 20 and they stated to come right over and they could accommodate. We got to the restaurant and now their telling us our party is not a priority to them right now do to they have much bigger corporate parties and their taking priority. A sorry we don't have room would of made it easier for us then having us wait for 45 mins and then telling sorry YOUR NOT PRIORITY."}
{"text":"Bad service.... didn't even get a chance to go in and eat.  My family and I get out from the movies, thought we would walk over for a Sunday dinner.  Walked in, lots of empty tables..... told there would be a 25 minute wait.  
Tried to sit and wait but became aggravated when staff was standing around joking and not seeming too interested to place us at a table.  

Ended up at Olive Garden, Service is always great!   Don't think we will go back to the spaghetti factory in the future."}
{"text":"I have been to an Old Spaghetti Warehouse in Texas and loved it, so when my family and I went to Chandler Fashion Center it was a pleasant surprise to find an Old Spaghetti Factory there. 

The food was absolutely delicious.  While greatly enjoyed everything we ordered, my favorite was the garlic cheese bread.  I have ordered cheese bread from other restaurants and found it to be too dry/crunchy, with either too much or too little cheese.  At the Old Spaghetti Factory the garlic cheese bread was fresh, fluffy, and had just the right amount of cheese and garlic.  The mizithra spaghetti was fabulous, too!

In addition to delectable food, the service was great.  Our waitress was nice and attentive but not overbearing."}
{"text":"One of the words in the name of this place correctly describes it and it isn't \"spaghetti\".  We came here for a wedding reception and were just kind of whelmed with the experience.

First off, lets call a spade a spade. This place is CHEAP. All their meals come with bread and a salad/soup and spumoni ice cream for dessert for under $15. Their current special is a 4 course meal for 2 for $25 so they definitely have a target demographic. 

The venue itself was nice and clean but there was a large wait at 7 PM so be early or be prepared to wait.  We had a back room that was very large and could accommodate very large parties. The servers were nice but a bit inexperienced. I ordered a chardonnay, received a pinot nior. We were served by table and both times food was delivered (salad and entree) someone at our table was left out and had to grab a server to get their meal.

We were offered 3 choices of of entrees. Mine was very bland, I had the fettuccine Alfredo which was low on taste and on sauce. The Boy got the Chicken Marsala which was a bit better, the side of Mizithra Spaghetti was to die for but the Marsala sauce tasted pre-made and the chicken portion was small.

?This place is good if you are looking to eat on the cheap, if your in-laws are in town, or if you are a High Schooler ?going to Prom. Spend a little more $$$ and go to Rigatony's instead."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend, who was in the mood for pasta. 

My meal was meh. I ordered the spaghetti with mushroom tarragon sauce. It wasn't anything special.

I'd recommend this place for families since the decor is cool (lots of interesting light fixtures to look at) and, well, they serve tons of pasta. Kids like pasta. But I wouldn't recommend this place if you're looking to be wowed by your meal."}
{"text":"We attended the Murder Mystery show and had a great experience there but not a great experience with our servers. I had to track them down to order a soda then I had to remind the server multiple times that I still didn't have it. The food was good but not great. I was really disappointed in the lack of good service for such a small group of people."}
{"text":"Founded in 1969 by Guss Dussin, The Old spaghetti factory is an italian style chain restaurant based out of Portland, Oregon.

The Old Spaghetti factory serves you the delicious dishes with fresh ingredients and  at reasonable prices. They have all inclusive menu.

All Entrées are free of cost which included :

1. Sourdough Bread with Regular butter and Garlic butter. I am totally in love with sourdough bread from now on.

2. Minestrone Soup: An italian soup made out of vegetables like beans, onion, carrots, celery etc. Soup was refreshing and healthy.

3. Crisp Salad: Enjoy the crispy collection of lettuce, carrot, cabbage etc in one plate.

After the delectable entrées, we proceeded with the main course:

1. Roasted Garlic Grilled Chicken: Linguine noodles tossed with garlic butter, served with garlic and lemon marinated grilled chicken breast were scrumptious and would love to have it again during my second visit.

2. Penne with Chicken: Penne tossed in basil cream sauce with sautéed chicken pieces and mushrooms is all you need to make your meal complete.

3. Blueberry Cheesecake: Always a lover of cheesecake, this delectable blueberry cheesecake with subtle vanilla flavour was a perfect dessert to end my day with.

Also, in dessert they serve ice cream with no additional cost. We had:

Spumoni ice cream: Another italian gem, it's a molded gelato with layers of different flavours. We had the blend of Pistachio, cherry and chocolate ice cream. I still can't get over it

Rating:
1. Ambience: 4/5 (The old sphagetti has been given an antique look with wooden interiors and chandeliers)
2. Taste: 5/5 (Relishable and delectable meal)
3. Service: 5/5 (Staff is courteous and welcoming)
4. Presentation:4/5
5. Value for money:4.5/5"}
{"text":"Something about The Old Spaghetti Factory that I love and then really don't like, not sure what exactly it is.  The pastas are just okay but other things on the menu are good.  The ambiance is fun and family feeling. 

Maybe it's because the food is just okay but I want it to be better because I want to like the place.  It's holds some nostalgic memories for me as well as the the quirky atmosphere that some would call old, but I like it. It  makes me enjoy actually being there, maybe not eating there though. 

This is a pretty lame review actually.  What was the point of this?  Not sure."}
{"text":"\"The Old Spaghetti Factory\" was probably one of the first restaurants my wife and I ate at when we started dating.  Money was tight back then and TOSF soon became one of our favorite eats.  I hate to compare this place to a fast food restaurant, but this place is like the \"McDonald's\" of Italian food.  Now let me explain that.  When you go to McDonald's, it doesn't matter where in the country, or in the world, you are, when you order a cheeseburger, you know what you are going to get.  It's consistent and it's inexpensive.  The same can be said for TOSF.   It's decent quality Italian food, at very fair prices.  

I've sampled many things on the menu over the years, but lately I always get the same thing when we go out for dinner; Spaghetti and Meatballs.  I know most people wouldn't think to order something that you can make at home out, but I like a good meat sauce and my wife would rather have marinara.  So, for me, it's a treat.  She adores the spaghetti with mizithra cheese and brown butter, although, last night she ordered the meatloaf and said she found a new favorite dish.  I'll have to try it next time.  I'm usually the one that goes for the \"soul food\".  Dinner is usually served with a salad, and their creamy pesto dressing (similar to a ranch) is really amazing.  Remember to save a little room for desert, because you always get your choice of a scoop of ice cream, spumoni, or sherbet afterwards.

TOSF is definitely kid friendly.  It is a true family restaurant.  The trolley car in the middle of the restaurant is always a draw with the little ones.  There can be a wait sometimes.  Call ahead and put your name on the list, since they don't take reservations.  The 1980's era arcade games are great to pass the time and bring back many memories of wasted quarters of my youth.  TOSF is one of those places that will always leave you full of good food and great memories...even if it is a chain."}
{"text":"Two and a half words... \"gluten-free pasta\".

When I was a kid my family would dine out 1x's a week.  My parent's idea of trying new places meant sitting at a different table at the same restaurant.  Once a place got introduced into our dining lives, we went there every week until my dad got pissed off for some odd reason, and we would move on to a different establishment.  Needless to say we ate at Spaghetti Factory many, many, many times.  I have some fond memories from this place.

Fast forward to now, many years later, I learn they have gluten-free pasta.  1 3/4 hours after finding this out, I was sitting at a table ordering gluten-free pasta with meat sauce and sausage.  I was not disappointed.  They use a corn pasta that has a very good consistency and has a very good taste... my non-gf dining partner also ordered it and enjoyed it very much.  The meat sauce was fantastic in a super salty, not healthy kind of way and the sausage... oh the sausage, so good.  Now I realize this place is in no way healthy, authentic, or \"italian\", but it's a guilty pleasure that many will like.  I especially like the prices and the decor inside, just like it was when I was a kid.

I enjoy this place, for the memories, and now for the gluten-free pasta.  This will be a monthly place for me before first-fridays.  I highly recommend you use their call ahead seating option by phoning in before you come, it will greatly reduce your wait times."}
{"text":"Double you. Tee. Eff.

A friend and I were meandering aimlessly (Shawn Micallef styles) down the Esplanade when we both remarked that neither of us had visited the Old Spagetti Factory. Heck, we were both hungry so why not give OSF a try? \"What could possibly go wrong?\"

We came for the pasta, but what we got was an unapologetic visual assault. From the grizzly bear-sized gumball machine in the foyer, to the 1:1 scale carousel in the dining room, to theriomorphistic depictions of  famous Toronto Blue Jays as sheep rendered in stained glass (seriously, read that last part again), this place is truly a family-oriented, good-taste murdering, cautionary tale of a resto decor job.

That said, my Goat Cheese Angolotti wasn't half bad. Not worthy of ire, at least. All entrees come with salad, bread, spumoni and coffee, so for less than $15 plus tax and tip you can eat like a king. The king of a demented, gawdy, carnival, stained-glass kingdom of Dr. Moreau, but a king nonetheless.

Obligatory Title Pun: SPAG-edelic, baby! Yeah!

Menu Readability: The menu is a broadsheet printed on the thinnest newsprint I have ever felt. Includes old-timey clipart. Whee!

Need to mention: Bring your kids, not your boss, and never a date.

What this place teaches me about myself: Spaghetti is a poor substitute for ritalin."}
{"text":"Food, service, and atmosphere ALL EXCELLENT. Took my twins here for a birthday dinner. They just turned 10. The environment is kid friendly and the scenery entertained my kids throughout the meal. From sitting in a cable car decked out in lights to antique decor throughout, no one is bored. Yesterday there were 2 other birthdays next to our table. I also spied a few first dates (u could just tell.) Spumoni with a lit candle and wait staff sing happy birthday! This was a treat.Again, our waitress was great and working hard! I had the Managers Choice \"white clam sauce\" & \"meat sauce.\" It was delicious. Dinner served with salad/soup, bread and Spumoni. Kids had the \"brown buttered spaghetti w/ cheese. \" Our bill was less than $25. I'm buying gift cards for Christmas. Wait time for a table about 15 minutes. Wait time for drinks 5-10 minutes. Dinner served within 15 min. I wish I knew our waitresses name because, she would get a shoutout. I think you have to sign up for the birthday club online if you want to get free b-day meal for your kids. This may be. One of our new hotspots."}
{"text":"We held a group event here the other evening - - and the staff was great! I didn't even realize that we have an OSF in Phoenix, and right in the downtown area. 

The building was cool... a former house, I guess. But the interior was pretty cool, lots of small steps down and up every here and there. 

We had a large closed-off area for our group. No issues with the timing of the food or anything, as we had a couple servers overlooking our party of 20. 

I had the lasagna - -which was great! For dessert, I think we all had the mocha pie (or something like that). It was awesome!

I'll come back again another time with my husband. Good times!"}
{"text":"I will always rate Old Spaghetti Factory with 5 stars. It is amazing EVERY TIME. This was our first time at the one in Phoenix and, honestly, it is either the second coolest or in tie for the 1st coolest one I have been to. I have been to the one in Phoenix, Spokane, and St. Louis. The waiter was awesome and brought out a little ice cream dish with a candle in it for my husband's birthday. 

For those of you who have not been to a Spaghetti Factory, you will be FULL when you leave the restaurant. I am in love with the brown butter Mizithra noddles. It's amazing! They give you bread for an appetizer, a salad or soup, your meal, and ice cream at the end. You MAY OR MAY NOT have leftovers , it just depends on how much you enjoy it at the moment. I normally have leftovers, but there are times I chow down on the goodness. 

At this location, they have fish tanks inside of an old gas pump (I believe that's what it is). We made reservations and only had to wait about 5 minutes, if that. They have some old arcade games in the \"waiting room\", near the bathrooms. There's PLENTY of tables for customers. All of the decorations and lighting is amazing! If I remember correctly, the building is over 100 years old and part of it, was someone's house. 

It's an overall amazing experience."}
{"text":"Other than a friendly waitress, there was nothing good about my experience at the Old Spaghetti Factory.  

I was surprised to see that the French onion soup I ordered was not baked in a ramekin, but was served to me in an ordinary bowl.  The broth was too salty and there was a single piece of cheese placed on top, which hadn't even completely melted.  Good thing I ordered more than just the soup or I would have left very unsatisfied.

Oh wait, I was still unsatisfied when I left!  My main dish was a cheese tortellini with a tomato rose sauce.  The pasta was extremely dry and there was not enough sauce to make it tasty.  The sauce itself didn't have much flavour to it.  I ended up taking almost the whole dish home so I could sauce it up myself.  Even after that, the tortellini still wasn't that good.

The only nice experience I had was at the end of our meal when the waitress said we get complimentary ice cream.  Well, the ice cream was only included in my meal, but the waitress said she'd bring some for the other person in my party.  The ice cream was delicious.

Not a great experience at the Old Spaghetti Factory.  I won't be making a return visit any time soon, or anytime in the future for that matter."}
{"text":"Oh family.... why must you continually want to patronize boring chain restaurants. I've been to this OSF many times, and it is always fine... nothing special, but nothing terrible. I usually get angel hair with mizithra and clam sauce. The bread and butter is tasty. The minestrone soup is generally a little watery, but fine. By the time the pasta gets there, does anyone really want to eat any of it? I usually take it home. Anyway, OSF isn't the worst chain out there, but I'd rather spend my money on a meal at a local restaurant, especially when in downtown Phoenix.... mecca of local eats. Sorry OSF."}
{"text":"I always go to this OSF with my Gram because it is close to her house and she likes it. I went there yesterday (and have been there on at least 10 other occasions). The food is really just meh. I used to love it as a kid, but now it is really nothing special. The bread comes out warm and with garlic butter, which is probably the best part of the meal. I always get a small order of half mizithra cheese half clam sauce on angel hair (a must at this place for me), and it is fine, but definitely not worth the million calories that are in it. The meals come with soup or salad and ice cream and only cost about 10$ for dinner or 8$ for lunch, so there is no doubt that it is a bargain, but I would not come here if it were not my Gram's favorite place to go."}
{"text":"Food overpriced and barely edible, a unanimous sentiment at my whole table of starving girls. Salad was just basic iceberg mix, vegetables were extra on request. Chicken piccata was so tough a knife would hardly go through it without some serious effort. My girlfriend cut chicken meat from the tough skin and sent it to the kitchen (her meal was comped).  Broccoli was hardly cooked. The server gave us one drink refill and we never saw him again after he collected the check (I pulled out my own bottled water). I don't send food back to the kitchen or make a scene, but I don't return. I cannot recommend this spot."}
{"text":"We have been to this location before and although my husband thought the portion were too small we both agreed the food was good.  We tried to go here on Canada Day and the place was literally crawling with kids.  There were babies and toddlers crawling all over the floor of the bar.  When I asked the hostess how long of a wait she said 45 minutes or so.  I asked why there were kids in the bar which is where we would have spent 45 minutes or so enjoying a drink and she said kids were allowed and if we didnt like it maybe we should eat somewhere else.  We did eat somewhere else and will never darken the doorstep of this establishment again!!"}
{"text":"My first time here and we had a great time!

I am actually surprised by the poor reviews by a lot of ppl, I paid attention most of them because one visit and about specific waiters.

I think when you review a restaurant give them a poor rating just because you run into a bad waiter one time is a little bit funny.

We really enjoyed our food, we got the bread with cheese & marinara sauce and spaghetti with a meat sauce and they both were really good and above expectations.

The waitress was new and wasn't very knowledgeable, but she really tried and was very very nice.

And wow the price?? Everything for $24 plus tip??? It's unbeatable!!

I think all this people who rate a restaurant need to pay attention to how much they paying too!

To go to a restaurant who charges you $30 for two people and compares it to one who charges $100 and rate it as you paid the same is not right.

I really felt like the price & quality is above my expectations and by far!"}
{"text":"I wrote a review on the Chandler location and gave them five stars.  I love this Phoenix location even more!  I like the vibe in this restaurant.  There is so much character to the building and as you walk around you see that it's huge!  

Our server was a sweetheart and kept replacing our bread and butter.  I ordered my  Mizithra with the bacon on the side.  If you have ever thought this dish was overwhelming, try it with the bacon on the side so you can control how strong you want the flavor to be.

I ordered an Italian soda and they brought me a Spaghetti Factory glass souvenir!  It might just be a seasonal thing so I'd ask first in case they don't always do this.

Great food and great prices as always!"}
{"text":"This place is great.  With your pasta you get piping hot bread, choice of soup or salad, and spumoni or vanilla ice cream to finish your meal.  Prices run around 10 to 14 dollars.  I can't believe it took us so long to come here.

The food is not photogenic so I didn't feel compelled to post pics, but what the food lacks in presentation it makes us for it in taste and price.  The decor of the place is a cross between industrial and whimsical with a splash of vintage.  

Great experience!  I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Decent food, massive portions, and they have SPUMONI!!  That's a huge plus.  So why the 2-star review?  They made the \"dirty dining\" list for June, and that's NOT cool.  And after several visits, service was all over the map, from really good to crummy.   Sorry guys, you gotta try harder, and keep the joint CLEAN so that you don't score horrendously on your health department inspections.  Better options elsewhere."}
{"text":"I only went here once with a couple of friends on a Friday night, and boy was it ever crowded! I remember there's a staircase when you come in the front door and then we were all lined up on the stairs for quite awhile, while waiting for some tables to clear out.
After about 25 minutes we did get a table, which was nice, but due to the crowding, it was awkward too because the table was right in the center of the room with people all around and bumping into us on occasion.

It was a little loud, so my friends & I were having difficulty chatting at a normal decible level, but I must say I ordered some chicken strips to snack on and they were some of the best I've ever had :d

However, just as we were getting into the evening, we were suddenly asked to hurry up and leave since that same night, a stand-up comedian was to be on the stage soon, and I guess they sat us in reserved seats where someone had tickets for them.
I have never been there since, but perhaps if I ever go again, it will be during the day when it's much less busy, since they do make good food :)"}
{"text":"We don't fancy franchises, but sometimes it's just convenient.  We go here sometimes because it's near Phoenix Theater.  It's fine, but overpriced for what it is.    The last time we went, it was really slow, even at 5:30... almost missed our show at 7.  Likely would go back if we were with people who weren't very interesting eaters and had a decent amount of time.
    Nothing here is interesting- standard italian.   Would likely be good for kids- it's loud and most of what is on the menu, kids would eat.  It has it's place, for sure."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. Needed a place to avoid the rain before going to see Tron with my mom at the movie theater next door. We didn't order food, just drinks. There's an OSF in Seattle, and having gone a couple times, while not super familiar with the menu, I know what they serve. Our waitress was actually really awesome- she got us our drinks quickly and was super friendly with our touristy butts. Yeah... it's a chain. I know the food isn't the best and the service can be hit or miss. But the stars are all for our waitress, whose name I (of course) can't remember. I got the OSF version of a Jack and Coke, which had a cherry infused whiskey (it was dangerous, and at 7 dollars, doubly so), and my mom got a virgin Daquiri- our waitress put extra whip on it. A little touch, but one my mom really appreciated."}
{"text":"Italian food is one of my favorites, I'm always excited to try different pasta's and \"authentic\" Italian cooking. I had been wanting to try this place but never really felt the need to go out of my way to make it happen. Needless to say I was invited for a group dinner and graciously obliged.  

Presentation C: They are renovating right now, there were no signs coming into the parking lot indicating the entrance. We (of course) attempted to enter through the main entrance, only to be stop by a small piece of paper that said the entrance was the other end of the building. Ugh. Who likes to walk on gravel in 4'' heels? 

The overall feel of the restaurant is very warm, the furniture and decor is all antique, resembles broken down shipping crates, antique lighting, but  still very well lit. Our group sat in a group dinning area behind the hostess stand so we got to see everyone that walked in, which was a little distracting. People were standing by our entrance waiting for their table, poor design.  

Staff D+: 
Hostess did not greet upon walking into the restuarant, after arriving to her stand we saw our group seated directly behind her and we sat ourselves.

Our group had been seated for 15 minutes prior to our arrival, granted we were still waiting for others, 15 minutes in and no one at the table had drinks. Really? The waiter wasn't very friendly, his service was very poor. He would disappear for 10-15 between each action. Drink order.... 15 minutes till drink delivery. Drinks are delivered he disappeared again for another 10-15 minutes. He finally returns to take our food order food takes 20 minutes... we eat. We're done. He doesn't check on us at all during the process... 10 minutes after we are done eating he returns to take our ice cream order.... I think you get the point. I'm sure you're probably asking yourself,.... were they busy? No. At least it didn't look busy to me.

Food C-: This part will be short and sweet. The food is mediocre at best, I can make it at home. I got the Chicken Parmigiana with Fettuccine Alfredo. The portion of food in comparison to the price, is small. It is not a lot of food at all.The taste was very bland for Italian I found myself adding salt. 

Best thing about the restaurant is the building and decor,i'm curious about the renovations. The staff needs to be more friendly and welcoming and they need to deliver a better experience for the customer. The food portions need to be increased by 20%. I've never eaten Italian food and not had to have a to go box. Especially for the price we paid.

I would only return if I was invited and accompanied by a group and everyone else wanted it."}
{"text":"The Old Spaghetti factory is okay. 

I came here a little over a month ago way back in early September and my pasta was pretty good. The french onion soup is good. But there's nothing that really wows you about this place and I don't think I'd be dying to come back or anything.

The service is the real downside to this place, it's not very good. Our waiter wasn't warm or friendly and honestly seemed like there were a billion different places he'd rather be than there. Which is understandable, everyone wants to go home, but the least you can do is hide it, ya know? Maybe he was just having a bad day.

+ Food is decent

Wait time is alright. I thought with the fact it wasn't all that busy and it was super quiet in the restaurant, service could've gone faster. Prices are alright.

- Bleh service"}
{"text":"As a New Yorker, I was unimpressed with this Italian food, but the waiter was great. Good atmosphere for families with kids. It makes me nervous that the waiters walk around with the bread on big knives lol."}
{"text":"I always enjoy the Old Spaghetti Factory. This was actually the first time I have been to one since moving from WA State to AZ. I went to the one in Spokane, WA a few times. It was nice and the service was great. I was there with friends for the murder mystery dinner so we only had 3 choices for dinner. The Spaghetti Vesuvius was good as per usual. Maybe I'll make it back one of these days. I always enjoy the mzythra!"}
{"text":"I'm being generous with one star! My step daughter was leaving to Texas for Airforce basic training and we had a party of 12. Our reservation was for 5 as she had to be back at her hotel for briefing by 8p.m. The hostess staff was very cold an uninviting in general. We were seated and waited for our server who must have been lost. Bear in mind the place was nearly empty with staff visibly standing around doing nothing. We put in our drink order and appetizer order, no drinks for at least 15 minutes... After 25+ minutes we finally got our cheesy garlic bread and shrimp scampi. Bread was fine, the scampi was a few small shrimp swimming in a bowl or luke warm butter with little to no flavor. Our water glasses were empty for almost an hour then we finally were served our entrees. My husband did not touch his chicken fettuccine and my brother in laws meat balls were dry and needed a sharp knife to cut. I almost forgot to mention our server arrived with the entrees sweating like he had run a marathon, appetite killer for me. Our server never came back to notice the majority of the party hardly touched their food or to ask if we needed anything. I had to go ask the very rude unaccommodating curly brown haired hostess if she could get us some crushed red peppers since I could not find my server. The best part of the meal was the free ice cream at the end which everyone ate because they were still hungry from not eating their food. It is now 740 and my daughter needs to be back at her hotel by 8 o'clock and my server is nowhere to be found so again I go to the hostess desk and stand there while she's chatting with another employee waiting patiently for her to acknowledge my presence, I say excuse me can you please go find my server we need to get going. All in all very disappointed and we will not be back. Lesson learned always check yelp before visiting any restaurant."}
{"text":"The old spaghetti factory sounds like an amazing place to be, but don't let the name fool you at all. 

The food was horrible, even worse than canned spaghetti sauce or frozen spaghetti entree. In fact it was so bad, I felt like barfing the spaghetti back out. I ordered the spaghetti parmigiana and my partner ordered the penne sausage. The spaghetti was revolting, for a place that is called the spaghetti factory, some of the spaghetti was hard and not cooked at all. I would have expected more because of its name. The sausage penne was a joke, $20 for 7 thin slices of sausage, not even one whole sausage and the penne tasted like canned sauce. 

I was expecting a lot more and it was really disappointing. Our meal came to $60 and it was definitely not worth it. I would not recommend any poor soul to venture into this 'nostalgic' restaurant."}
{"text":"This was my first, and probably last, venture into OSF at Chandler Mall.

The service was first rate.  Our waitress was very attentive and well-trained.  The decor was lovely and invoked a Disney-esque atmosphere of a real \"spaghetti factory\".  Everything was clean and the front of house greeters couldn't have been nicer.

Here's the bad news: the food was, to put it politely, not very good.  Our table of four ordered two spaghetti with meatball dinners and two lunch portion spaghetti with marinara.  All of the entrees came with a very pedestrian cup of bagged lettuce mix with choice of dressing and drinks of choice.  The dinner choices included a dessert of spumoni ice cream.  The lunch portions did not.

Allow me to state that I am not a food snob.  Noodles and sauce can be very satisfying under almost any conditions.  In fact, I wondered out loud in the middle of lunch, \"How could anybody screw up spaghetti?\"

Here's the answer:  Jar.  The spaghetti sauce tasted like it came from a jar.  Ragu?  Prego?  Chef Boyardi?  Take your pick.  There was absolutely NOTHING fresh in the sauce.  NOTHING.  Processed red stuff all the way.

The only good thing that we had was the loaf of bread that came with the meal.

This place makes the Olive Garden look like the French Laundry.

Save your money.  Please change the recipes.  Thank you."}
{"text":"We started off positive with our visit to this restaurant, we were seated early, the hostess was able to find us a booth near an outlet so that my husband could plug in his power wheelchair. Then our server came to our table and it was all down hill from there.  Her name was Hoda.  When she arrived, she didn't introduce herself she just went into asking for drink orders and since we knew what we wanted we went ahead and placed our order. She went and got our drinks, placed our order to the kitchen, and then placed another tables order prior to bringing me my salad. While she was taking the other tables order, our main dishes arrived prior to my salad. The server who brought our main dishes out offered to take them back and bring salads but we declined and then my salad arrived. My drink (diet coke) was empty for over 1/2 of our meal. When it was time for dessert as it was included as part of dinner we asked our server what Spumoni ice cream is, she explained  and we both declined and asked for chocolate. When she came back, she had 1 chocolate and 1 Spumoni. We finished our ice cream and asked for the bill, my husband already had his credit card on the table and Hoda advised that she would go get the machine to run the credit card. We did not leave her a tip at the end of the meal due to her poor service, so we signed the slip and she walked away. As we were packing our things to leave our sitting are, she came back (she must have seen $0 for a tip) and asked if something was wrong. We advised her that it was her poor service, she responded with that it was because she was busy. When we spoke to Will the mgr on duty he advised that she was new and had a small section to deal with that night. Needless to say, we won't be back,"}
{"text":"I will NEVER go back. 
This was my first visit and from the outside the building looks really old and it gives a feeling of history. I was excited for some delicious Italian food. The drinks tasted like sewer water and the manager didnt care one bit. We had both the Coke and Dr. Pepper and both were horrendous. I ordered the Chicken Parm (well done, and when i asked if it was well the server didnt even know) and was BEYOND disappointed. Its a grilled chicken breast, no flavoring, and they didnt trim off the fat or anything. The cook just threw it on the plate and covered it with their sour, nasty, gross tomato sauce and cheese. I have had this dish all over Phoenix, (Bucca de Beppo, Olive Garden, Carabas) the chicken for this dish is normally pounded flat, then breaded and either baked or fried. This Chicken Parm was the most simple thoughtless dish I have ever had! And at the tune of $11.95 they can keep it! The walls and ceiling were moldy and the service sucked. Smells like cat piss and I recommend you just go somewhere you know has good food and skip the \"history\" and awful decor."}
{"text":"Had the baked lasagna, the hubby had the chicken Marsala, both were delicious. The service was also fantastic! This was my first time eating at a OSF, we will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Had small children with me as I had supper here tonight.  One was a screamer.  Didn't help that it was particularly busy tonight (we kept having to ply kiddies with food, so that they wouldn't belt out too much.  Kids were basically full, by the time the entrées arrived).  However, it was nice that the background noise was so family-friendly that heads didn't turn around when there were any screams.  Finally, we felt like we could eat in public!

Overall, I think the experience was... A-OK.  Food was decent.  Portions were on the smaller than average size, despite prices being around $15-20 per dish, and under $9 for a kid's meal.

I like service.  Attention to our bread, water, etc... levels.  People coming by at least once to ask us to confirm that all's going well.  Instead we had to ask for whipped garlic butter, extra napkins, extra drinks...  I know they were all busy there, but I know I like 'service' if I'm out at a restaurant.  We ended up not being offered a part of the meal deal - nobody was asked if they wanted tea/coffee, at the end of the meal.  
Waiter was otherwise nice, just not available enough.  

Waited 40 min. to get a table (you should call ahead to make RSVPs).  You may want to request a table in the... caboose, or... merry-go-round.  
Food took some time to arrive, as well.  Again, heard this was because it was pretty busy this Sat. evening.  

All combos, and ages, were there.  Couples on dates, family dinners, many Blue Jays' fans.

Total came out to a bit around $60 for 2 adults, 1 child.  Two adult mains, one child main dish, one drink.  All dishes come with soup or salad, an ice cream dessert, a milk for the kids or a tea/coffee for adults."}
{"text":"Your food is the best! Our favorite was the spaghetti with butter and Parmesan. I was also happy to see that there was gluten free past there. We sat in the trolley which is a great place to dine if you're there with kids."}
{"text":"The Old Spaghetti Factory is a place of many memories for me.  When I turned 18, my friends and I went to OSF by whim.  We had be doing research at the Burton Bar Library and it was just right there.

When we first walked it, we were mesmerized by the comfy looking couches, the retro games, the sleigh in the corner...  and when we sat down to eat in those big velvet chairs, we were hooked.  It was love at first sight.  We even got to take home our glasses since we had the Italian sodas!  The food is excellent, portions are decent, and you get some spumoni at the end of your meal.  How great is that?

With prom being one or two weeks later, we all went with our dates and a bigger group back to the OSF.  Everybody loved the food.  We were all dolled about and had a great time there!

Now when I look in my cupboards six years later, I see a dozen OSF glasses.  If you can't tell, I'm a big fan of the place.  :3"}
{"text":"I like this place.  Just can't help it.  

Let me break it on down for you...

Negatives:
1. Food is not \"slap your mama\" good.
2. With it's popularity, there can be quite a wait on some nights.
3. I can't really think of a 3, but I wanted to have at least 3 things here...

Positives:
1. Food is good, and everyone can find something they will like.  Nothing to experimental, too trendy or too expensive.
2. The decor.  They could serve McDonald's food and the decor would find a way to save them from one star hell.  The much-mentioned trolley car in the center is fun, but I love even more sitting in the library room (or so we call it).  Or at one of the big tables with the big velvet chairs.  
3. Great for when you have a lot of people in your party, and/or when there are kids.  I'm kind of stumped when I see folks mention this as a bad thing.  
4. Even when you are waiting, there are awesome chairs and sofas in multiple rooms where you can mingle.  
5. Ms. Packman!  How it is no one has mentioned this?  We've had Ms. Packman competitions while waiting for a table several times. 
6. The place is really huge.  Why is this good?  Because if you go at a non-peak time, while not typically a date kind of restaurant, if you ask to get put in a quiet spot, it can feel like you have the whole place to yourself.  
7. Location.  How much family friendly fare is down here?  Another reason the place is always packed.
8. Spumoni or sherbet is included with your meal.  Heck yea.

Listen, this isn't the cool and chic place to be, but it's nice, kinda fun and pretty well liked by most people.  Very kid friendly.  And who knows, you just might like it too."}
{"text":"The best way to describe my experience here last night is, in a word, \"meh\". I went for a girlie night out with my mom and sister and was less than impressed with this place. We were seated right away, which was nice, and the table was very clean. The server, however, had a \"too cool for this\" attitude, complete with slumping against the post of our booth. 
When my soup arrived, it was room temperature, not even warm. My mother's was the same way... I didn't eat much, it wasn't that appetizing. When my main meal came around, (I got the baked chicken), again, my spaghetti was room temperature and the chicken was not that great either; it was definitely on the drier side (however, the Mizithra cheese that they put on the spaghetti was the best thing I've ever eaten). My mom, who ordered the same entree, said hers was about the same as mine only warmer.
The bread that we got with our meal was probably the best part. It was flavorful and fresh - very yummy. 
All in all, decent service, cool decor, mediocre food. I don't know that I'll be returning."}
{"text":"We were at The Spaghetti Factory for a birthday. Blake was our server. He did a tremendous job and made our experience one to remember. The food was great and the atmosphere was fun. Thanks Blake for a job well done."}
{"text":"I wanted to like it more but left me feeling unsatisfied. All the food seemed salty. For a place called the Spaghetti Factory it better have some killer sauce...but not so.
Service was good. Food not so much."}
{"text":"Probably the worst Italian food I've ever had!! And those who know me, know I have been to PLENTY of Italian restaurants. So to say this place had the worst food, trust me it was that bad. My friend commented on the lasagna that it didn't even taste as good as Stouffers frozen. The Chicken Marsala I ordered was so tough, I couldn't even cut it! I definitely could have done 100 times better. The atmosphere is great, but the service doesn't support such a cool looking restaurant. I'm not sure how long it took to get a glass of wine and beer from the waiter but it semed like forever! There is no parking in the front so you have to drive around to the back which is a tad unsavory honestly. How do you mess up Italian food THAT bad?? Really! Go somewhere else. Do not take anyone but your kids here and order something like spaghetti and meatballs!! Then cross your fingers!"}
{"text":"First of all, their gluten free pasta is really good! It's yellow and made from corn. It's nearly unheard of to see an Italian restaurant (non-chain, chain, authentic or not) have a gluten free option. +1, seriously.

I've always liked the Spaghetti Factory. It's not the best but it is dirt cheap and they have so many cool decorations. I'm a sucker for old antique-y looking stuff. 

The service can be slow and it's always busy, but hell...ALL Spaghetti Factories are this busy if not more. It's not an anomaly people. I'm just happy they have a call-ahead system so you don't have to wait for hours when you arrive."}
{"text":"Prices include everything, soup or salad, main and dessert.

Food was good, nothing special but no complaints. The decor is super cool, especially with kids and the service was excellent. 

All in all, a great night. Wouldn't do it often, but will for sure do it again."}
{"text":"Went in at dinner, the wait was not long. The waitress made sure we were good, very friendly. I would come back"}
{"text":"The only thing this place is missing is a giant neon sign above the front door that says TOURISTS EAT HERE and a big flashing arrow. 

Very kitschy, faux-nostalgic Victorian interior with the ambience of a Chucky Cheese. This place is deceptively large on the inside and there were several large tour groups eating there at the same time, meaning 5 dozen junior high school students and their chaperones graced us with their oh-so-witty banter all through lunch,  and none of them had any concept of an \"inside voice.\" 

The menu is fully unimpressive. As you might expect, it's all pasta. I ordered the Spaghetti with Brown Butter and some kind of dry cheese. I got totally dry, mushy pasta under a mountain of approximately 2 cups of what appeared to be Kraft Grated Cheeze Dust .  Eating it made me feel like I had to sneeze. 

My husband had the chicken parmesan and deemed it passable, but nothing earth-shattering. 

While the food is definitely blah, the service was fast and super-duper friendly. And this was the only place in Toronto where I could find real unsweetened iced tea instead of the tooth-achingly sweet mix stuff. 

This is not a spot for calm, relaxing lunch or high-end Italian fare. I don't really know why you'd go here. It was across the street from our hotel, and I was really, really hungry but there are many far superior places in the neighborhood. Walk a block or two farther and take your pick, but don't waste your time or money here."}
{"text":"Great throw back concept. Wonderful location near other restaurants, theater, etc. family based, good portions & values."}
{"text":"One of my usual favorite restaurants, but the hostesses are the worst, they initially told us about an hour wait, then 15 min later I went to add another 2 people to my party and they did not even have us checked in. Granted it was a busy Saturday night, but even the busers were horrible. After a party had left, they would take 20 min to clean a table. It was so bad that both myself and one of my party offered to help clean so we could have a seat! 4 hostesses all standing around not doing much and busers taking their sweet time cleaning tables joking around with the management staff women working. 2 hours later finally seated and they squeeze us (10) into a small room. When I asked about the bigger table they said nobody was staffed there. Arrived at 7pm seated at 9pm. Only person who did a decent job was our waitress. At least she was the only one that tried."}
{"text":"They have a good environment/atmosphere, and the restaurant was nice and clean. Our service was a little alow, especially towards the end of our meal. The menu seemed a little limited, but the food came out delicious! I had the Brown Butter Noodles with Mizithra Cheese, and definitely was NOT disappointed."}
{"text":"Incredible experience! First of all, my server was Jace whom gave my partner and I a phenomenal experience! We asked for recommendations which were the manager's special(spaghetti with spicy sauce/spaghetti with browned butter) and the chicken Alfredo with mushroom and mascarpone cheese ravioli. For dessert, he recommended the spiced cake and we ordered a tiramisu. We loved it and would order the exact same thing returning back to this franchise. Also, the price for all the food you get is well worth it as you get salad and dessert with your order. You will definitely not leave hungry! Thanks Jace for making this environment so much more enjoyable!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy The Old Spaghetti Factory... we usually go to the one in Fullerton, San Diego, Rancho Cucamonga and not to long ago while vacationing in Hawaii went to one in Honolulu. All of them have that authentic tastes and there spaghetti flat out rocks!!!

When my sister and I were making the drive out to Texas, we were at midway point. Using the reliable Garmin typed in places to eat and Spaghetti factory pop... 'YES' 

The place is very old looking but it was really cool because it was consistent with the name, so I liked it. Wood creeking floors, arcade room, ugly ass chicks - LOL - JK okay we're all beautiful people inside and out, etc...

Now the food was a little bit of a let down, although it was good but seems like it was a The Old Spaghetti Factory  Probation Center... like the food was trying to redeem itself to its authentic tastes. Well, if it is keep up and continue striving.

Would I go here again, I sure would, but with just a tad bit lower expectations food wise. Then again, every business is hurting recession wise so I'm sure there has to be some compromise with the food.

Nevertheless, sister and I left satisfactory!"}
{"text":"Used to love coming to this place. The wife and I went in tonight prior to a concert downtown thinking we'd get a nice meal. Although the Spaghetti Factory's decorations and ambience really add to it's character, none of that matters when you have the service like we did. We made a reservation thinking it would help us avoid wait times and still ended up waiting 10 minutes when we arrived. When we eventually were seated we had the worst service in recent memory. Our waiter was soft spoken and didn't give much of an intro and brought our drinks with our soup and salad. Once we had finished our soup and salad and both of our beverages we waited twenty minutes before we received refills. Forty minutes in a queried about our appetizer to which the waiter said he would ask the kitchen, the place he had seemingly been hiding out in most of the time. When he returned he said there was a mistake and we could cancel the appetizer or it would come out with our entrees. No apology was made or attempt to make it right. Meanwhile the table next to us received there meals even though they had been sat after us. We then were brought our entrees by a kitchen staff. I ordered the chicken parmigiana which came lukewarm with a glob of spaghetti while my wife ordered the ravioli. The waiter then brought the bill without asking us what ice cream we'd like, a part of the three course meal which we were not offered. After I'd paid I tracked down a manager to see if there was still some hope they might make it right. Nope! The manager seemed to express a disingenuous apology and said \"hopefully it's better next time for you\". Clearly the customer is an afterthought here. There definitely will not be a next time."}
{"text":"Funky place. An amusement  park inside an eatery.

I ordered a spaghetti with mushrooms and terragon sauce and my friend got the  bruschetta.

Priced are alright and servings are decent. You can \"factory-size\" your meal to make it 65% larger!

Come for the ambience. Lots of families   bring their kids but the noise level is acceptable."}
{"text":"While this place had a lot of charm it left a lot to be desired. We had a party of 11 & with literally 1 other table it took them over 15 minutes to seat us.(between lunch and dinner) Once seated it took my husband going to the manager to get a server to take our drink order. The server proceeds to tell us \"sorry the other server didn't want this table because you have 7 kids here!\" Uh really there is literally not one other patron in the place. Took drink order and brought kids all cups with no lids. Food came out fairly timely. I had pick 2- lasagna was fair but the chicken Marsala was horrendous. NEVER AGAIN!"}
{"text":"Wow..what a waste. Starting with the menus I should have known it was going to turn out to be a horrible meal, raggedy and dirty that they were. THe color on everything that we were served was off and pale. The salads were pathetic and everything needed salt, its amazing what a dash will do to cheeses. The meals were touted as hearty and fulfilling, but its been a long time since Ive seen my husband clear his plate, which is either a good thing or bad thing i feel it was sadly mislead..I was so disappointed but at very least I didnt feel bad about not taking off my running jacket before dinner, this may be the blue plate headQuarters and home of the $10 bowl of pasta, but if your looking for class and/or quality pass.... Olive Garden would be a better bet.."}
{"text":"Really cool atmosphere, you can even sit in a trolley! Great value too. Soup or salad, pasta, and ice cream all included in the price."}
{"text":"Reviews are not that good, but I felt our lunch was very good. Service was highly attentive, and our pastas were flavorful. Good sauce, both the tomato meat sauce and the clam sauce were good. Bread was very average, but the spumoni made up for it!"}
{"text":"Long wait, poor presentation, and subpar flavors made this a negative eating experience. They have an extensive waiting area with about a dozen tables with six seats or more leading us to believe that waits are common here.

We ordered ravioli, spaghetti with meatballs, and fettucine alfredo. I wish I had taken pictures but then again, they would have been unimpressive. Sauce was either too tart or wholly bland. Portions were small considering the price.

Just imagine cardboard and the color brown. These describe the general impression I received from this establishment's ambiance. 

Good aspects were attentive service and complimentary ice cream dessert (your choice of sherbert or spumoni).

I think you'd have a better time at Olive Garden."}
{"text":"This is a trip down memory lane.  My husband and I are high school sweethearts and this was always a very special date night night.  Before Sweetheart dance, after Homecoming or just a fancy date this was our go to spot.  If we could sit in the trolly even better.  We grew up, went to college and got married and started taking our kids there.  They both married tgeir high school sweethearts and this restaurant has become special to them too!  When my husband would work at Phoenix Theatre we would eat there on dinner breaks. If we wabted good LOCAL pasta we would go here. When we go to a show at Phoenix Theatre we always tey to eat here.  The food us good, portions ok and the staff super. Also love the historic element.  Fun to be on the rail too!  A Phoenix favorite for sure."}
{"text":"Slow service to seat and then to serve. Left waiting and the food was below avg at best... decor was best thing about it...."}
{"text":"I've avoided coming to OSF because my ex put the fear of Yelp in me about how bad this place was, so much so that nearly four years after the break-up I was still hesitant to dine here. [I truly respect his opinion on eating out]. But my bestie Jason and I were meeting a few friends to attend an N2T production and this was the closest open restaurant on the light rail.

Yeah, this is a chain and probably a step above Olive Garden. But what impressed me was the Garlic Mizithra:  Brow butter. Mizithra cheese. Garlic. Bacon. Especially the bacon; I'm a sucker for bacon. Not only did I eat the entire bowl of pasta, after digging into the wonderful sourdough bread and putting a serious dent in the tapenade, I left wearing some memorable stains from the butter. Meh, that's why I brought a scarf.

While I cannot say I'd add this to my regular rotation, I wouldn't not return."}
{"text":"Food here is always so good, portions are amazing for the price you're paying. Recently we've had the pleasure of having a server named Michael, he gave awesome customer service, and working in the customer service industry I know it when I see it. If I could give more than five stars I would! Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Their back!!!! Food was as good as ever!!! New place, right at aloha tower. Meat sauce / mizithra managers special! Always the bomb!"}
{"text":"What to say?

Food...serviceable.
Staff...adequate.
Wait time...short...even on Friday night.

Good place to take a family if for no other reason that cost.  Otherwise, if you get into another restaurant on a Friday night, go there.  If not, then OSF will serve the purpose of putting a meal on the table."}
{"text":"Pretty good, cheese bread amazing, unique atmosphere good casual date spot, probably 3rd or 4th after you're more comfortable with each other. Lol."}
{"text":"Cheap eats.  The place is a bit overwhelming in terms of its tackiness."}
{"text":"This place is the absolute best. The spaghetti squash is unparalleled. Seriously. If you're keto/paleo you've got to try it, it'll blow your mind!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite OSF location! The historic downtown location (coupled with ghost story rumors) makes for a fun and #TBT experience! The staff here are always friendly, professional, and prompt. I love coming here!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love The Old Spaghetti Factory, but this location disappointed me sorely. Granted, we came in an hour before closing - I'll give them that. I felt rushed and neglected throughout this entire dining experience, with the exception of being seated. We waited an unusual amount of time before our drink order was given and when we ordered our food, the server seemed very hurried. When our salad/soup came, we had no place settings or silverware and had to wait until someone passed by. It just seemed very rushed and hurried. 2 stars, since this location not only fell short of expectations, but when it comes to best in its class, other locations were so much better."}
{"text":"My family and I ate here after a few hours spent at the Children's Museum. I would definitely  recommend this place and we will be going back very soon. The cheese bread appetizer was so yummy, our girls ate that for their meal.  Mizithra cheese and browned butter noodles-very tasty. Great atmosphere and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"I go to the old Spaghetti Factory on average 5 times a week. I lost the game there so many times and the food is always there....it's always food. And the service is always amazing and they bring out the food. And drinks too. Help me find my game. They cook the pasta here.....and the bread, woooooaaaa the bread."}
{"text":"The Brown butter sauce and pesto ranch are both worth trying at least once."}
{"text":"Despite the food not being great, I was actually a fan of The Old Spaghetti Factory.  I kind of liked its cheesy charm.  And it is kinda cute for kids.

The last visit was not so great, though.  The manager seemed less than thrilled to host our group of 26 people in the bar.  Even though the bar was empty when we arrived and we were paying customers, I felt we were unwelcome visitors.  The manager did agree to give us a $5 special cocktail, but considering we probably gave them the busiest Saturday bar night in awhile... I felt she could have been more gracious.

The bartenders were nice and friendly, hence the two star rating."}
{"text":"Old Spaghetti Factory is good for large parties because it is bargain priced and has quick service. 

The food we had was pretty bland and boring.  

My child got a larger portion of her tortellini than I did of my spinach ravioli.  

Still, the service was friendly.

As a bonus, we all got to choose from a scoop of vanilla or spumoni (cherry popsicle also available upon request) for dessert.  Go for the spumoni.  It will be the best part of your meal!

Additionally, sitting on the large, misted patio on a perfect night like last night was very relaxing.

Come here after a movie at Harkins with a large group.  Don't expect to be getting the best food.  I mean, I have had better ravioli come out of the freezer section at Fry's.  Still, if you're hungry and you're close... it's better than some of the other mall choices."}
{"text":"Have been eating here for over 20 years when it was owned my Mike Pulos.  Would eat here when you could use your ASU ID and get half off.

Now a days if you enter your cell phone in the ipad at the entrance they will send you specials via text message. 

Would always order the Managers Special and get half clam sauce and half met sauce. The meal comes with salad or soup and dessert ice cream and use to include ice tea which is a dollar now.

Not the most incredible pasta you will ever have but good especially if you can get a 2 for 1 special.

Will always come back for more but will try to take advantage of the specials to maximize the dollar.

Service is generally good and the parking is limited in the front but there is plenty in the back.

Will be back again and again"}
{"text":"Cute family restaurant for downtown Toronto. The place is huge and kids-friendly. The menu is also very kids-friendly. I don't have kids, but my fiancé and I enjoyed our meal. Food was alright for the price, cheap drinks, and great service by Jason (i think?). The whipped garlic butter is so addictive. The pastas are standard, but I didn't expect anything more. Price is very reasonable, as the entree already comes with salad/soup, dessert and coffee/tea. They have gluten-free pasta too if you're into that."}
{"text":"Disgusting chain-restaurant style food at it's worst. Tastes like it arrived at the place in a plastic bag, was cut open, and microwaved (which it probably was.) They put onions on the chicken marsala without mentioning it on the menu. Plus it's not cheap considering how mass produced it tasted. Considering all the fabulous places to eat in the area, you couldn't pay me to go back."}
{"text":"the OLD spaghetti factory is by far my guiltiest pleasure. lets face it the food isn't that great, and on more then 5 occasions i have been here and it seemed like the entire bussing staff was on a smoke break.

growing up in the willo district as a child my mother took me to the Spaghetti factory alot. i remember sitting in the trolly and the entire 86-88 suns team was in the building \"helping\" out. signing autographs and what not. sure was fun as a kid.

now that i'm older i just have those memories to make me say this place isn't all bad. 

the mizthra cheese and butter on some noodles is still delish. the meat sauce is decent to great. the pesto ranch dressing is pretty good..to bad the lettuce is either still soaking wet, or dry and disgusting. 

as a phoenix institution for decades i wish this place was better. maybe someday someone will come in and turn it around..but as a \"chain\" restuarant i don't see that happening. either way..for nostalgia i'll still eat here on a quirky whim. but i will not go out of my way to eat here."}
{"text":"Perhaps not the worst eatery in the galaxy but this place reminds me of Death. Cornerstones appear to be below average, oversalted Italian and slow, sometimes indifferent service.  Old folks abound, perhaps reassured by the gimmicky old tyme nostalgia, with the trolley, fake tiffany lamps, etc. Instead, it transports me to the 1970s, to sprawling east coast chains off the turnpike I'd get dragged to as a kid - with waits, bland food, very young staff going thru the motions, and crap on the walls to distract from the underlying mediocrity. 

It's not horrible, and will appeal to that handful of Americans actually older than me, but I've little interest recapturing the sleepy era this factory is shooting for."}
