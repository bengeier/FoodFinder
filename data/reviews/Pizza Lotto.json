{"text":"Eating at Pizza Lotto right now. This place is absolutely amazing! Excellent service started the experience off right. Then the amazing pizza came out. We went to NYC last month and this is the best pizza I have had in years! Got a pepperoni pizza  and a pitcher of goose island IPA and I can't wait to be back in town to to get this pizza again. Added the garlic and oregano per the owners recommendation. He was so right!"}
{"text":"The El Cortez location isn't going to be the most accessible for many people, however the food and guest service were quite good, so it is worth frequenting.  

The garlic knots and the pizza we ordered were both excellent.  Both are among the best in town and make the inconvenience of the downtown location more palatable.  The proprietor also threw in an order of wings at no charge so we could try them.  Very cool of him - didn't love these, though.  I might have, but they were really overcooked and it made them taste strange.  I was intrigued with the interesting seasoning they use on them.

The design of the restaurant could use work.  They've been open for a decent period of time now, but it still looks like a work in progress with these weird display pieces serving as a de facto temporary wall blocking off part of the room.  Kind of hard to describe.  There is virtually no ambiance or decor to the room.  

They also use paper plates.  I strongly dislike having my food served on a paper plate in a restaurant.  I'm not looking for fine china - just go to the dollar store and buy fifty cheap plates and wash them.  That will work perfectly.   

The aforementioned proprietor was very pleasant and repeatedly checked on our satisfaction.       Pizza Lotto is a good choice for pizza lovers looking for a casual experience.  I hope they are successful."}
{"text":"The pizza isnt great. The server was very rude.  Overpriced. Can get better down the street."}
{"text":"This pizza is legit. Coming from two New Yorkers, this is the closest you'll get. The flavor is actually better than pizza rock slices, which I've stood by until now. This place has better flavor and is way cheaper. Eat it up, it's a delicious hidden gem."}
{"text":"Rude and extremely slow service. Poor quality pizza. This place is truly awful. I'm flabbergasted by the good reviews."}
{"text":"Great pizza, I had a pepperoni slice. The crust was thin and crispy, the sauce was delicious! We also tried the garlic knots, a bit greasy but still good! great staff, I'll definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Food is amazing! Justin Rocks!! Large portions. Served on paper plates. Keeps prices reasonable."}
{"text":"Very good NYC style pizza. We had a Groupon for a pitcher of beer and a large 1 topping. Excellent value. The pizza fed 4 adults. Service was friendly and pretty fast."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery. Everything was correct & on time. Caesar salad was good but the croutons tasted oily& the Parmesan tasted like it was American....not imported....so not quite as pungent. Margarita pizza was excellent. The crust was light & airy with a nice chewy texture & wasn't flimsy at all. Definitely a must try & I will be back!"}
{"text":"Pizza Lotto is a must visit for Fremont St Las Vegas. If you love pizza and wings, come here. Staff is friendly and every helpful for whatever you need. TRY THE WINGS!!! the owner is awesome. Please try these place, we are a Socal resident. This is amazing. Just come. Sorry for bragging"}
{"text":"Ok - this is by far the best pizza Ever!  FRESH, TASTY and great service!!!  The garlic rolls melt in your mouth - DECADENT  Hats off to Dan the chef and Julie the hostess - food is unbelievably good!!"}
{"text":"Had a 12\" Sicilian pizza and garlic knots.  Both were excellent.  Would definitely come back the next time I am in Vegas."}
{"text":"Really really close to Authentic NY style besides being a damn good pizza! Just go there and find out for yourself, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"We were staying at the El Cortez Cabanas & decided afternoon to have pizza & beer for breakfast er lunch. Come on it's Vegas Baby! So we wanted to give this place a shot. We aren't NY pizza fans per say but the hubs likes pizza in general. Having said that we both enjoyed our own slices which is nice so we can get what we individually prefer vs. the usual sausage compromise... Don't ask. So bonus on the slices. Beer was $5 ea for non PBR or $10 for a pitcher. So who am I to deny the chance to have some more beer with my pizza. 
We also got the Antipasto salad & OMG was it pretty when it came out & so good to eat. Loved it! I would seriously go back based on that salad alone. I know FREAK but it was that good.
They do have a super good deal of a slice of cheese & a PBR for $5. Can't beat that with stick. So I say give this unpretentious spunky spot a shot. You won't be sorry."}
{"text":"Great food awesome pizza and great portion sizes too for your dollar. Inside el Cortez once I found the place.  Staff very friendly as well."}
{"text":"3 for cheese. 4 for white slice and Sicilian. Sicilian was the bests of all. Great after a night of gambling."}
{"text":"The closets rhing I have found in the city to real pizza. Everything is delicious. And is doesn't break tour wallet.  Take it from a Chicagoan, we know pizza."}
{"text":"When in Las Vegas don't cheat yourself by getting just any old pizza. Stop in at Pizza Lotto inside the newly renovated El Cortez casino on Fremont Street. Excellent pizza and a first rate staff brought me back for a second meal during my week there.  I'll certainly visit again the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Tucked into the El cortez is this newish pizza spot- you order at the counter but the dining room and menu are both larger than expected for such a place. Service was exceptionally friendly but it wasn't enough to save my white slice, which was very dry. Came back for a regular pepperoni slice and it was pretty average. 
Rounding up my review a bit due to the variety offered here: salads, sandwiches, and entrees along with full size specialty pies. They're fairly new, hoping a return visit in a few months yields a better actual product."}
{"text":"I think this was the best pizza I tried in Vegas. I wasn't even hungry, just needed to kill ten or twenty minutes. Got a slice of pepperoni, it was great. The girl that was working there was cool too. 

I have nothing bad to say about this place."}
{"text":"located inside the El cortez hotel and casino. Great pizza. I enjoy the white pizza with Riccotta cheese for four dollars a slice. other slices like pepperoni are five dollars. Pizza Lotto  offers New York style slices,  big Sicilian style slices,  whole pizza and draft beer. For $16 you can get a pie and beer. Great deal on fremont. Beer selection Is not bad Light lager a craft and a IPA . Pizza lotto has mexican coke in the bottle and other coke products for soda. Place is small but always clean and the staff is nice. Shakers are in abundance and on tables. I hate having to ask for them. We always enjoy a low key much here. It can get very busy at night."}
{"text":"Horrible Pizza, Horrible service. I wish I could give zero stars. The wings were decent though. Totally disappointed with this place."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I live next door to the el Cortez so we always love to come to this hidden gem (in the old cafe Cortez location) once a week and try out a new pizza! Their pizzas are great and the perfect size for 2 people to share. Fredi who's the director of operations over there is the biggest sweetheart and always makes great suggestions on what to try. Overall great lil pizza spot with a large menu of salads, sandwiches, and breakfast as well!"}
{"text":"This place used to be our favorite spot downtown for pizza. But my god have they gone downhill!  The second to last time we went in, we got a Margherita pizza..  It had fresh mozzarella, fresh basil.. and dried Italian seasoning. A little off putting to say the least, but somewhat excusable. The guy behind the counter said that it was a new cook.. So we wrote it off as that. The LAST time we got a Margherita.. It was undercooked, which forced us to finish cooking it in the oven. Fast forward to tonight. Ordered a Margherita, and a Sicilian to take home..  The Margherita had ZERO fresh basil on it, this is a problem considering Margherita's always have basil.. Oh, but there was a generous portion of DRIED Italian seasoning..  So if this was from the \"new cook\" you're doing it wrong. The Sicilian was so over cooked, the crust was like cardboard, a steak knife struggled to get through it! The crust was way over salted, I felt like I had been licking a salt lick after eating a piece. 

To be fair and honest, she refunded our money over the phone, and didn't require us to bring the pizza's back downtown. That's the ONLY reason I'm giving 2 stars, and not 1. 

This was incredibly disappointing considering we've been there more than a dozen times, and have ALWAYS loved the pizza. I guess it's Evil Pie for us from now on. Unless this \"new cook\" gets some serious training, and we're proven that it's back to the way it used to be..  We won't be back."}
{"text":"The pizza was one of the best I've had in vegas! NY style, super crispy and thin. There's current pizza and beer specials, so best value for this caliber of pizza!"}
{"text":"Pizza place inside the El Cortez. It's NY style pizza- not my favorite but pizza is always good! The prices are reasonable here. We got 2 big slices & a beer for $9."}
{"text":"$4 for an avg slice of pepperoni.For a location that caters to the budget thinking customer I dont understand the pricing like it was a gourmet slice.If I was starving after walking 3 miles in the heat ,sure its ok but if I have a choice im going somewhere else."}
{"text":"I am so sad this placed closed down, the pizza was so good and the new place that replaced it just doesnt hit the mark with their pizza for us. So sorry to see you gone, Pizza Lotto."}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza and garlic knots I've ever had! Next time I'm in Vegas I'm definitely coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal pizza.  I am a former New Yorker and saw this place after playing craps at the Cortez and stopped in for a slice.  I ended up getting 3 because it was so good.  The owner, Max, talked with us as we ate at the bar.  Turns out his family is from New York and he uses an old family recipe and baking style.  Come to this Vegas secret and you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"amazing pizza, and service. The staff at Pizza Lotto always goes above and beyond every time I visit. Great quality pizza, very authentic."}
{"text":"Seriously the best pizza I've had, and the cannoli made my eyes roll back in my head it was so delicious. Service was great, prices reasonable."}
{"text":"I went to Pizza Lotto's website and played their lotto game to see if I won something. I won a slice of cheese but saw it was only good for about 2 minutes. When I got to the counter I had about 25 seconds to claim it. The waitress seemed a bit flustered only because of the time crunch (my mistake not her's). The slice that came out was fine. Could have been an older slice. While the crust was good the pizza just tasted a bit old. I'm sure if I ordered a whole pizza I would be happy with it so I will have to try it next time I'm in town. Just a tip if you play the lotto game on their site, play it in line or at the counter."}
{"text":"Pizza Lotto is a brand new gem in downtown Las Vegas. Completely unpretentious, it underscores the foundation that makes for a fantastic pizza restaurant: love for the recipe. Every ingredient has been thoroughly considered in the quest for the perfect pie - and it shows. The garlic knots are fresh to death - literally, you will die. The pizza is the culmination of a perfect combination of cheese, sauce, fresh toppings and blend of secret spices. The end result is a crunchy-on the outside-soft on the inside- goodness. Make the trip up to downtown when you're craving late night pizza and I promise it'll be worth it! Remember to get creative with your pizza - leave no desire unattended - and it will surely blow your mind. Enjoy and regret nothing. Vegas baby, Vegas."}
{"text":"Divey Food place inside El Cortez Casino. 
Ordered a Blue Moon draft and Tiramasu. 
Tiramasu was VERY good!"}
{"text":"So sad this place is no longer at El Cortez. New owners and name. Okay but I will definitely miss Pizza Lotto. It was so much more NY style. Pretty disappointed my favorite pizza place is closed."}
{"text":"Fat man Carlos  behind the bar is rude.. pizza sucks and service is terrible.. don't eat here.."}
{"text":"Great pizza and the garlic knots are amazing!   They have a Groupon for pizza and beer, and to top it off,  you can access 2 pokestops while eating.  I'm definitely coming back!  :)"}
{"text":"I got a coupon on Groupon and was really excited to try this place because all the pictures and reviews were really great on there. We got there and ordered our pizza which was the large bacon and onion. The pizza came out after about 20 minutes which was expected and ensured that the pizza was made fresh. The guy that brought the pizza to us was really nice. After trying a slice I was actually disappointed. I was expecting a red sauce and it came with a white sauce which I didn't realize and I don't think it specified. Although I probably should have asked. In my personal opinion I didn't quite like it and now I have a full box of pizza in my fridge not going to be eaten. I'd love to try again because I'm sure they make great pizzas but I don't want to buy another one and end up with another pizza I might not like."}
{"text":"MEDIOCRE ALERT!!!!

If you think that NY pizza means industrialized ingredients and cardboard crust, then this is the place for you.

However,  if you know that making a great pizza is an art, where every element, from properly fermented dough to the right oven and cooking temperature, to the freshest ingredients, is what it's all about, then  this place can be crossed off your list.

I wouldn't say it's completely inedible, it's just forgettable....as Woody Allen said: \"sex is like pizza, even when it's bad, it's good\". 
There are so many many better options in Las Vegas, including Metro Pizza and Settebello and Evel and Due Forni and Pizza Rock, and my favorite neighborhood joint Sicili Pizza on Twain, that in the final analysis Pizza Lotto is a losing ticket."}
{"text":"Good pizza, nice value with a coupon.  That being said, I have never met a pizza I didn't like.    The pizza was street style NY, I would skip the wings next time.  I like the old school feel of El Cortez and this place has potential.  Just wasn't that memorable."}
{"text":"Great Pizza for a good price. Really big slices of pizza.  Nice thin crust. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"When I think of the El Cortez, culinary options don't normally come to mind. I think about that food court with the Subway. Also think about how I didn't feel great after eating at the Subway in the food court. I probably would have never found this place if we hadn't had the Downtown Vegas Improv Festival at the El Cortez Fiesta Room.

Pizza Lotto was the oasis in the desert. I saw there was a deal for a slice of pizza and a craft beer (probably Oscar Blues type beer, I think I had a couple that night...) I had to rub my eyes to make sure it wasn't a mirage. During the two days of the festival, there were plenty of people taking advantage of the pizza. The pizza was delicious in it's own right, not just because other options were limited. I felt it had the right amount of greasiness for a pizza. The pepperonis were delicious. I had some bites of a white pie that was also delicious. 

And it hit the spot. This place saved us a couple of times. After the show, we went to the lounge area in the El Cortez that served food. The waitress was overwhelmed and had trouble even taking orders. We went and ordered pizza from pizza lotto and were able to bring it back AND I finished my slice before the waitress at the lounge came back to take orders."}
{"text":"Awesome service here. I was using a Groupon and there was a delay on my pie...I was given free garlic rolls for the wait. These guys are incredibly helpful and customer-oriented. If you get the chance & like it, DO add spicy sausage to your pie...so delicious, and apparently made ON SITE! I did a spicy sausage and green pepper...delicious!"}
{"text":"Best Pizza in Vegas!!!! You have to try the garlic knots and order a few slices!!! Great cold beers and authentic New York style pizza!! Make sure if your downtown try it out!"}
{"text":"Did someone say, \"New York\" pizza in Vegas? Yes, authentic straight from the pizza oven with just the right amount of everything!  But... You have to try the meatballs! Nonna's recipe is amazing. All of this, second to the garlic rolls and the delicious drippings you dip them in! 
PizzaLotto in the nostalgic El Cortez Hotel in downtown Vegas is not to be missed. A dose of the past with a taste of Italy is just the right combination.  Great service and attention to your every need, you won't need any luck at PizzaLotto, it's a Winner!"}
{"text":"I tried 3 different pizza slices during my last trip (Cosmo Secret, Evel's and Lotto), this was the best."}
{"text":"My group of about 6 people were visiting the El Cortez and the fabulous Downtown Experience for the first time this past week and came upon Pizza Lotto. It was a Saturday night and there were 5 or 6 other tables. We were greeted by Fredi, the GM who explained the concept of \"fast casual.\" We sat down at a table to look over the menu and when we were ready, we headed to the counter to place our order. Our drinks were quickly delivered to our table and then, a basket of the most amazing Garlic Rolls (NOT KNOTS!! As they say on the menu) were brought to the table. The rolls were dripping with XVOO (Extra Virgin Olive Oil), grated Parmesan and Romano cheese and fresh herbs. Our Calzone and Stromboli soon followed as well as a Funghi Bianco drizzled in truffle oil. We ordered a variety of Stromboli's, all 3 that were on the menu to be exact. Chicken Parmigiana, Sausage and peppers, and Italiana were the three they offered and boy were they delicious. The Meatball Calzone was by far the best I have ever had! Mama Della, wherever you are, God bless you! The Funghi Bianca would even make Chris at Pizza Bianca Proud. The only bummer was that we came in before they had their beer and wine license, therefore, no booze. We were told that they should have beer and wine within the next week or so. Oh Yeah! The Cannoli are to die for. Crispy, crunchy shells, proper filling, just the right amount of cinnamon, vanilla, chocolate chips, and creamy sweet ricotta. This was a fantastic experience all around and my mouth will be watering until I return next time to this new upcoming hot spot!"}
{"text":"Ok. Boardwalk style, which means a pasty thin dough, thin tomato and cheese, baked quick.   Sober, thus pie is just ok.  Had two slices, the sauce was a little sweet for me.  Limited condiments.  

No military/first responder discount."}
{"text":"Just tried to order a Pizza... its 1:30 on Friday night... I'm staying at the Hotel... was told I can't because they close at 2 and they only have sliced pizza and its going really fast and there is a line out the door and even if i walked downstairs to get a slice it would be gone... aka \"f you i don't feel like making you a pizza because I'm going home...\" I could have ordered and paid online and they would have had to make it... I'm on Vacation right now and work in the Industry and if someone wants a drink a half hour before we close you better believe i am making that drink with a big old cheesy smile on my face because thats what we do and how we keep our customers happy!! Because without them we have no job!!... I am here until Tuesday and will not bother giving this place a dime. 

Thanks for absolutely nothing! :("}
{"text":"Got a Groupon for pizza lotto, I actually bought 2 on accident lol. My grandma and I love the downtown area so we went to El Cortez and decided to check this place out. We ordered a Cesar salad and a 12\" pie with pepperoni and mushroom. Salad was good, enough for both me and grandma. The pizza was greasy but the ingredients are fresh, they don't skimp on toppings and that includes cheese. The crust was great as well, I don't like crust however I finished all of it. We stopped ourselves from finishing it all, definitely will go back."}
{"text":"we ordered 2 slices of pizza. one pepporoni and one cheese. we also got a anti pasto salad and 2 beers. the pizza slices are a decent size for the price you pay. it is 3 dollars a slice and it cost extra for toppings. the pizza was excellent. I loved the thin crust and the cheese. the anti pasto salad was fresh and flavorful. the italian dressing is the best I've ever tasted. I loved the meat in the salad and the cheese. the salad was so fresh that you cant stop eating it. it's a small place inside the hotel. we went on a weekday so it wasnt busy. the waiter was helpful. we were satisfied with our purchase and food."}
{"text":"Went to pizza lotto and redeemed a Groupon for a large pizza and a pitcher of beer. We were helped by Kenzi and she was very helpful and didn't make us feel weird for using a Groupon. She was really personable and made us laugh. We will. S back because of her."}
{"text":"I haven't yet been to New York but this pizza definitely makes me want to go! 
I suggest you try the wings, they're very good but, keep an open mind because they're different from what most people would call hot wings. 
This place is a must try!!"}
{"text":"No lie, the pizzas by the slice that they had on display did not have me convinced. It looked dry and unappealing. I almost walked away but it was late, and we were too lazy to find an alternative. They were getting close to closing but chef guy said there was just enough time to squeeze in a fresh made pie. I was so relieved! 

We decided to opt for a full fresh made margherita. I was surprised. It was so delicious! I inhaled all that my body would allow. Didn't even feel guilty about it. The downtown area has some good pizza joints but this is my favorite for margherita."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza for a great price ! Every time my boyfriend and I go to Vegas, we make sure to stop by for their $5 Pizza slice and Beer deal. (I think it's $5 anyway, might be $7). The owner is a super cool dude, also. We chat with him the whole time while we are there."}
{"text":"Place is a great deal.  I went here by mistake, but it was a nice mistake.  I couldn't complain with the 1 slice and beer for $5.  Great deal for ballin on a budget down town.  

I tried the cheese pizza and the beer.  It was ok, nothing too special, just reminded me of New York. 

It must have been better than I thought, because I found myself there the very next day.  Worker was nice and recommended the white pizza.  That was really good!  There was also somebody playing cool live music in the restaurant.  

Nothing fancy, nothing spectacular, but a cool little place with a great deal or some pizza when you are a bit drunk.  See you guys soon"}
{"text":"We walked past Pizza Lotto about 6 times before I decided to check out their menu online, back in our hotel room. My to my pleasure, when you go to the website you're greeted with an online \"slot machine\" wherein you can win various items from the restaurant. I lucked out and won a free slice.

The next day my husband and I decided to cash in the free slice and purchase one, too, as a snack while we were walking around town. We got a slice of classic cheese with marinara and a slice of the white pie with ricotta. Both slices were traditional New York style. Both slices were very much enjoyed.

The service, however, is what I mainly wanted to review. We were greeted by one of the owners, Max. He was very down to earth, super friendly, and we very much enjoyed chit-chatting with him as we ate our pizza slices. My husband wanted to be sure to return and support the business, due largely in part to Max's great personality, alone! (Though the pizza was worth returning for as well -- and they do have more on the menu than we tried!)"}
{"text":"I ate here for the second time this weekend and I have to confirm my first review from several months ago that this is without a doubt the best Pizza in Las Vegas. Trust me when I say this because I am a TOTAL Pizza snob coming from The Bronx. I had a 18\" with Meatball and tried a slice of their White Pizza. Both are incredible. I urge the owner to open a Pizza Lotto in Henderson as we need them there badly. Being in The El Cortez makes it tough to go there regularly"}
{"text":"The service was just ok. Because of service and location (El Cortez hotel) I was unsure of what the quality of the food was going to be like. Once we received our order, we were happy to find that the food was delicious! Good portions at great prices. You can't go wrong here and we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Very good food and very reasonably priced. Pizza is good and so are the pasta dishes. Its a nice atmosphere and they have a guy playing piano some nights. Best of all food is not tourist trap priced. You can get full on $5."}
{"text":"Simply the best pizza in Vegas! This guy knows how to make the perfect dough, lite airy flakey.This place is a diamond in the  rough !"}
{"text":"Great food and great service! Was looking for a good pizza place near my hotel and Fremont street. Was not disappointed!"}
{"text":"Tucked between some seriously loose slots is this gem. Ordered at the counter with Ricardo which was easy. Was told they were out of ceaser salads so they whipped me up some amazing pile of mixed greens with olives and peppers which was yummy. I had a slice of four cheese and my boyfriend had the pepperoni. Both were perfectly cooked with a crunchy but fluffy crust and the perfect amount of cheese. They had a guy playing live guitar which we really enjoyed listening to. Ricardo checked on us often and supplied plenty of napkins. He took our trash when we were done and I was a very happy camper. Their prices are very reasonable and a steal on National Pizza Day (whole pizzas half off)! We'll be back tonight to take a whole one to go! Very very happy to find a yummy place with great service that's easy on the wallet!"}
{"text":"Best pizza I've ever had, not too greasy, authentic NY style pizza, definitely best pizza down town! Awesome deals like a free pitcher of beer, Groupons etc. Good customer service, not too long of a wait! I recommend this joint!!"}
{"text":"Pizza was terrific! Quick, hot, and very fresh! I'm a pizza snob, but I really enjoyed theirs! Service was great!"}
{"text":"Pizza Lotto is located inside the El Cortez Hotel & Casino. Customers order at the counter. Service has been excellent during each of my visits. The employees are friendly, and we never wait long. I usually order a slice with mushrooms, and my boyfriend orders a slice with sausage. The toppings are fresh, and the portions are generous."}
{"text":"Pizza Lotto has wonderful pizza and a to die for Roast Beef Sandwich! Located in El Cortez is the perfect location for great priced and good food!"}
{"text":"Update to owners response that needs voiced on YELP: The rolls WERE so hard they were difficult to cut with knives. We were NEVER offered an exchange or remake of the pizza. The comment left is my honest and accurate review. To whoever responded dont post lies. Bad food happens...accept my review...dont post things that didnt happen. For this I will not return and I hope users read both replies to my review. I have always posted honest reviews and am offended with this false response to try to save face."}
{"text":"A very non-descript pizza place in the back corner of the El-Cortez Hotel & Casino - but a pleasant surprise!

We bought a groupon for Pizza Lotto and we were not disappointed. Very delicious, well-priced pizza for the Vegas area. 

The cashier was extremely friendly and even helped with recommendations - and talked us down to a 12' pizza from 18' once we realized how massive it really was. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza, great service and nice relax atmosphere! It's my first time here and we really enjoyed it..... Very well recommended!"}
{"text":"Pizza place located in El Cortez hotel and casino in downtown Vegas. We kind of stumbled upon this place by accident. Wanted pizza and this was the closest! All I can say is wow! This pizza is delicious!! We ordered a large spicy Italian sausage and green pepper pizza. Every single bite was perfect. The sauce is so good! Tastes very fresh. Wish we ordered more! We demolished the large which is very generous. I will definitely stop here next time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Went down to El Cortez and stopped in Pizza lotto for lunch.  I had the thin slice with sausage and green peppers. It was delicious. I think there was more sausage on my one piece than most places put on a whole pizza.  I definitely will return again. One of the best pizzas I have tried since moving here. Maybe you can open more locations."}
