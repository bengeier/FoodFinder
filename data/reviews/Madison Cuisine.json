{"text":"Thanks for this unauthorized Panda Express, so I can have chinese food for lunch everyday now"}
{"text":"They have sushi, hibachi, and Chinese take out.  Definitely would consider it Asian American food.  It was okay, the food choices aren't bad but they don't taste amazing though."}
{"text":"This place has really fresh food and it tastes great, it's inexpensive and the staffs are super friendly. This place is a great place for colleges students to enjoy, it's just right across campus."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch one day when I was taking a class at the UW Business School.  This place reminds me of Panda Express, which I have been missing for some time.

I am so glad I stumbled upon it.  The portions are great for the price.  I was also amazed at the variety of offerings they had.  I was a little bummed the sushi bar was not open, but maybe it's only a dinner thing.

If I'm ever downtown, I will definitely stop by here again!"}
{"text":"fast and cheap. I had lunch for $7.9(three dishes). Tastes ok, too much oil though. By the way they serve great rice! but I guess only Asian can tell the difference hahah."}
{"text":"This is my daily go to spot for delicious Chinese hot pot. The dish is well prepared and nutritious, not to mention it is delightfully delicious! The owner knows me and we are constantly having a good time every time I am eating there. Definitely recommend anyone who enjoys Asian hot pot to give it a shot!"}
{"text":"For less than $7 you can get a full meal of Chinese food. If that's what you are looking for this place is a great balance of quality, quantity, and price."}
{"text":"Served me raw chicken, then told me I should have ordered it well done. I'm gonna go ahead and give this one a one star."}
{"text":"This restaurant is absolutely one of the best Chinese ones in downtown Madison, WI. Their hot pot is particularly delicious and priced well."}
{"text":"I feel death.

Jesus Christ no. This is a bad food court for dumb college students.

I should have known. I knew as soon as we drove by. But we still went in.

Being able to distribute this warning to my Yelp fans is the only positive. 

The food is generic or slow or both. None of it is good. It's not extraordinary in any capacity.

I am drinking now. I am drinking a lot. And peeing. Thanks"}
{"text":"Good place for have food for students. We should not expect more. Many choices, convenient and cheap."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a great value. It's inexpensive, very good Chinese food. The amount of food you get for the price is hard to beat.

The Lo Mein noodles are amazing. Sometimes I don't even need to get an entree. I'll just eat the lo mein noodles. They're that good."}
