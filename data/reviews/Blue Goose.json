{"text":"Had the three wrap combo:  beef, trout, and chicken. They were really good! I like the chicken the most, while my friend like the trout. The beef isn't bad either. Each three had their own distinct flavour even though they had the same sauce toppings. Filling for $8, great stuff!"}
{"text":"Do not waste your money. If you want a good burger, Blue Goose is definitely not it.  First off, the service is super inefficient. Don't get me wrong: I didn't expect much from a food stand. However, the wait was unreasonably long. Yes, unreasonable even taking into account that the stand was solar-powered. Plus, there were too many staff members in the tiny cooking space. This meant they were constantly bumping into each other and not knowing what to do, thus delaying the entire process.  Secondly and more importantly, the burger was horrible. I like my burger slightly rare, but this was beyond just \"slightly.\" It wasn't cooked properly (which I would also accredit to the staff at hand). I have absolutely no qualms about eating raw meat and enjoy blue steaks and beef sashimi, but I would not finish this burger. The raw ground beef was falling apart, and I had to pick and eat the outside cooked parts.   Now let's talk taste. There was none. It tasted like it wasn't seasoned at all, which I don't doubt is the actual case. And it had none of that fresh beef taste. It wasn't as if it was under-seasoned to let the natural beef flavour shine; it was just bland and flavourless. You can make a better burger yourself at home with frozen ground beef and salt and pepper.   I would give it a 0 star if it were possible."}
{"text":"Juicy! That would be the first word I would use to describe the burger I had today.  Fresh, organic and special of the day would follow as I had the Japanese fusion burger. Cooked to medium and served with pickled cabbage and some other tasty fixins. Best burger I've had in a while!  Glad I stopped by as I believe that this might have been the last weekend they're open until next season :( If you missed out you'll have to wait patiently 'til the spring, but it will be worth the wait."}
{"text":"Caught a whiff of this joint through a foodie forum. Since this place was quite close I decided to pay a visit (Edwin A beat me to it for the FTR Darn!) Ah well I am not a burger aficionado by any means but I think I can tell when I have had a good one.   The meat was a fresh dollop of ground beef (all organic and hormone free) and is cooked medium rare when I had it. A flat hot surface is used to cook the meat so the all important fat in the ground beef has nowhere to go. The bun is decent. Condiments were your regular offerings with the caramelized onions being the standout. The burger is seasoned on the mild side and lends to bringing out the umami flavor one craves from meat. Folks this is a great value proposition and will even give even the higher priced places a run for their money for a burger.  Ding ding ding ding 4 stars!"}
{"text":"Really liked this place last year, but the new menu is really bad. The hot dogs were dry and very bland. Wouldn't recommend it and I won't be back."}
{"text":"Three banh mi tacos for $9 sound ok. You'll never mistake these for your favorite banh mi since this version is grilled pork w/ hoisin sauce, and some kind of pickled stuff on a single flour tortilla w/ a spicy kick thrown in. But it is tasty and should leave you satisfied for an hour or so."}
{"text":"A good spot to grab a burger, or other meat related product on a bun/tortialla on a sunny summer day. The meat they use is also of excellent quality, and tastes very fresh. My only complaint is that the food isn't necessarily that interesting to keep me coming back as it's run of the mill burger and toppings, and other things like it. Though I do enjoy that the food is sustainable and organic, and isn't ridiculously overpriced, though it's not cheap either. You can find a lunch for about 9-11 dollars though.  I had the special of the day: 3 tacos for 10 dollars. The tacos had ground beef, carmelized onions, mozzarella cheese, and cilantro. There was also sour cream on the side for dipping. The flour tortilla shells had been fried on both side, so it came off as a mix of a taco and a quesadilla. It was tasty and fresh. Not bad Blue Goose. Not bad."}
