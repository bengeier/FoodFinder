{"text":"We tried Boqueria at the Food Fest and it was AWESOME!! We ended up getting seconds and thirds.  Can't wait for the May schedule so I can follow them around."}
{"text":"If you are looking for an exquisite sandwich or authentic Spanish Food, this is your food truck! Great quality, beautifully presented & fresh ingredients. The Chef is someone to meet! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"The best Spanish / Barcelona food in Vegas. All menu is delicious. Sin duda alguna el mejor cocinero de comida Espa√±ola en Las Vegas. Buena calidad, muy buen hacer y un toque pequiliar hacen de este food truck uno, si no el mejor, en el panorama culinario de la ciudad. El chef Oscar se convierte asi en una apuesta imnovadora y segura cuando lo que buscas es comidad autentica."}
{"text":"Chef Oscar's Vaca Saltada bocata was love at first bite: succulent braised beef topped with gooey manchego, brightened up with red onion and spicy yellow chili-mayo. The tender, juicy meat is comforting and delicious, well-balanced with the other ingredients, packed into a sturdy fresh-baked roll. Praise calling this \"the best food truck ever\" are not overstated. Boqueria Street is the real deal, bringing Spanish street food to the food truck followers of Las Vegas. They are well worth hunting down, driving out of your way, and rearranging your schedule. The food lives up to the hype and then some!  Other standout menu items include the classic Jamon Serrano bocata with ham, mozzarella, and truffle mushrooms. The patatas bravas always make a great side with a zesty sauce and green onions, and are a generous portion for the $5 price tag. The croquetas are not always available, so get them if you see them- they're as tasty as the version served in a shoe on the Strip, at a fraction of the price.  Truly a menu with something for everyone. If you don't do pork products, there's the Pollo (chicken) bocata. There's a veggie roll that can be vegan-ized. Even pescatarians have the Gambas shrimp appetizer. And those are just the regular menu items! Each time I've found the BS truck, they have several featured special items, too.   Though they may \"just\" be a food truck, the attention to detail and quality of product they put out is easily comparable to what is available at brick and mortar options. The exterior is pristine, with ambiance added by bistro tables topped with small plants for a dining area. Chef Oscar and his assistant are always armed with a smile and, if you ask nicely, a sample of jamon iberico!"}
{"text":"Amazing food!!!! The Cuban Roll sandwich it lived up to the hype. Don't leave Vegas without having one, won't disappoint."}
{"text":"Tried them for the first time at the last foodie fest and loved it! The service was great. The jamon iberico was so good and the potatoes had this yummy sauce on them. If I came across this food truck again I would definitely eat here"}
{"text":"Got the Barcelona Sausage and \"Xino Xano\" Fried Rice for lunch. Super duper tasty. In terms of truckfood they are definitely well above average. If they had a brick and mortar store I would probably frequent them fairly often.  You would probably not regret giving them a try."}
{"text":"Chef Oscar Amador brings a taste of Barcelona to the streets of Las Vegas. I love Spanish cuisine and this new off-Strip option is awesome. The Boqueria Street food truck can be followed on social media and found at local venues including bars, farmers markets, or downtown outside the Children's Museum and RJC. You can even hire them to cater private parties.  The short menu comprises bocatas, patatas bravas, and croquetas. A bocata (or bocadillo) is a Spanish sandwich and Chef Oscar presents his version beautifully on a soft roll crisped up with butter on the griddle. I asked about a vegetarian option and he served up a bocata with mushrooms, zucchini, red onion, bell peppers, bok choy, and delicious romesco sauce. I was dining al fresco at Bruce Trent Park, but it could have easily been Jaleo. Chef has a Jose Andres accent.  I will be tracking down Boqueria Street very soon for an order of patatas bravas!"}
{"text":"I wasn't sure what to get and was thinking chicken tacos. I asked if they could make veggie tacos because I wasn't feeling meat that day but they were not too flexible. The guy said to get the veggie sandwich and talked it up a lot. It was average, extremely small , just had like tomatoes and a few leaves on toasted bread. He made it sound like it would be the best thing ever. And it was 9 dollars for the smallest sandwich of my life.  I would go to Panera of subway over this for a sandwich any day. And if I wanted fries with my sandwich it was going to be 3 dollars extra.   This place doesn't seem worth it at all and was sub-par. Maybe I'll be open to giving it another shot for their animal fries.  But -1 for not being flexible and -1 for subpar recommendation and food and price."}
{"text":"Craving Spanish food we drove across town to try it out. The jamon Iberico sandwich was meh. The toast bread overwhelmed the jamon. The lomo saltada and patatas bravas more than made up for it! Delicious! Worth the drive just for those two hours items. The owner/cook is from Barcelona."}
{"text":"They came to our office today, and the food was delicious. I got the pollo, and patatas bravas. Service was quick and friendly. I didn't have wait forever for my food, which was nice because it was windy! I would absolutely eat here again. I only wish there was a little more shredded chicken to bread ratio. Otherwise it was great!"}
{"text":"I've eaten several menu items from this truck. It's found all over town, but they usually are where the Food Truck Party is scheduled each week and worthy of trying. The guys working are nice and seem to genuinely care about putting out quality food that tastes great. When you place your order don't expect to get handed food right away. They make everything to order and it can take time, but it's well worth it.   Jamon Iberico ($13) - This is some tasty ham! The split-top rolls that they grill in butter really hold the fillings in nicely and tastes great. While I like this sandwich, I actually recommend the quesadilla which is stuffed with iberico ham, mushrooms and mozzarella.   Patatas Bravas ($7) - This is a full portion, but you can add a smaller version for $3 to any meal. The menu describes this as fried potato wedges with Barcelona style spicy sauce. I like the patatas bravas a lot, but the flavor hasn't been consistent each time. Sometimes the sauce it much spicier than other times and even has a different color.   Vaca Saltada ($11) - Braised beef, manchego cheese, red onion, spicy yellow chili mayo on a split-top roll grilled in butter and topped with pretty edible flowers. The beef has great flavor and all the fillings compliment each other well. This sandwich was well liked by all in my group that tried it.   Croquetas ($7) - There's chicken inside these fried tasty gems. You get 4 of them in the order and side of Parmesan cheese bechamel for dipping. I feel like you should get at least 5 of them for the price given how small they are, but they do taste good.   They also have chicken, sausage and veggie options. Check their social media pages to see where the truck will be next."}
{"text":"Great service. Excellent food. Great pricing. Chef is from Barcelona. Michael is great. Talk to him. He has blue hair. I had the cheeseburger and fries but everything is good!"}
{"text":"Amazing!!!! The burgers and sandwiches are so tasty!! I have to say though the patatas bravas is to die for!! If you see them check them out!!"}
{"text":"Believe the hype as the Vaca Saltada Roll is a definite best of.  The meat is tender and succulent, the bread oh so buttery melting, the toppings just the right complement.  It's a bit messy to eat, so grab a fork and some napkins.  The owner was cool.  The rest of the menu looked inviting."}
{"text":"This just might be the best food truck to ever debut on the streets of Las Vegas.  Boqueria Street is a new food truck that, per their web site, just launched in January of this year. I'd be one of the first to say that you're usually not going to find anything truly special on wheels, with a few notable exceptions of course, so I'm not that I'd never heard of them until i saw the lineup of a new weekly food truck event that I was planning to visit. After trying the food, I became very surprised indeed.  The highlight of their menu of \"Barcelona Inspired Street Food\" (you'll see the words on both sides of the truck) is actually a separate blackboard full of Iberico ham options (Jamon Iberico \"de Bellota\" to boot, which is reputedly the highest qualtiy). The gentleman outside the truck pointed out this menu while I stared pensively at the truck, and the chef went so far as to offer me a sample.  I will admit that I have certainly never had Iberico before, so I have no point of comparison, but the morsel of meat that the chef offered me was the best thinly sliced ham that I have ever had the pleasure to taste - far richer than whatever prosciuttos that I've eaten (laugh at me all you want, but I'm not that well-traveled or experienced). Consequently, I had to order off their Iberico menu, whether or not the pig that this came from actually ingested acorns and only acorns all of its life.  I chose the Flat Bread of Iberico ($12), which was simply the ham draped on a flatbread, with some tomato and olive oil in between. I already waxed poetic about the ham, but the bread was surprisingly good, certainly far better than whatever run-of-the-mill pitas that every Greek place uses. The tomato was a welcome acidic accent, but perhaps slightly overpowering in some bites. Still, I'd definitely suggest ponying up for either this or really any of their other options if they offer what they call Iberico.  I was also hungry enough to order the Barcelona Sausage ($8.50), a non-encased pork sausage in a buttery roll with zucchini sprouts and chimichurri mojo verde. I really have to highlight the awesome roll, which is by far the best bread that I've had from a food truck and certainly one of the better ones if I include brick-and-mortar. They actually source it from local outfit Great Buns Bakery, but whether it's the third-party softness and airiness or the chef's grill treatment, you can't miss their bocatas (aka bocadillos, aka sandwiches) for this reason alone.  The sausage needed to shine too - heck, it's the namesake - and it indeed had a rich, meaty flavor. It kinda reminded me a bit of bratwurst, actually. The accompaniments are also nice, including some chips (taro?) that were somewhat prone to falling off but still delivered a touch of crunchiness. I'll likely also grab another bocata next time to see what else they have to offer.  By the way, both portion sizes are what I'd charmingly call \"modest.\" But with food trucks, you're often prone to paying prices not too much lower for food that's certainly inferior. Same for brick-and-mortar places, sometimes. Go for quality over quantity here and then pig out on whatever gut bombs you might find at other trucks at events.  As food trucks often do, Boqueria Street posts their menu on their various social media pages, as well as their web site (which also has a copy of the menu, sin* Iberico). That's how you'll find them, and you definitely should make the effort to try one of the best food trucks in town and one of the more interesting new food ventures, four-wheeled and four-walled alike.  [*because not everyone learns at least sufficient Spanish to get by, sin = sans = without - capisce?]"}
{"text":"I fly to Barcelona every month for work. I always miss this food when Im home in Vegas. It is not in many places here. So I was thrilled to see this food truck sitting outside of Premium Outlet Mall. The two sided burger had perfectlt seasoned beef and pork. It was simply perfect and totally hit the spot. The owner says he is opening a small sit down restaurant with his Barcelona Tapas food soon somewhere down near Jones and Spring Valley. Can't wait !"}
{"text":"\"A sandwich?  It's 100 degrees outside and 120 in the car.  Go by yourself.  Oh and bring me one\" says my SoCal poker bud.  15 miles later, at the Las Vegas Farmers Market (Rampart and Vegas Drive) sitting on a park bench, now munching on my SoCal poker buds sandwiches. huge Cheshire Cat grin, feeling no guilt; \"You had your chance\".  One of the BEST food trucks in Vegas.  It's specializes in a small sampling of Barcelona Street food adapted to American taste.  Not 100% authentic, All good, just enjoy your food outdoors while you people watch.  You'll feel transported.  Credit where credit is due: thanks Stefany V for the recommendation.  Bocadillos, traditional Barcelona sandwiches, feature OUTSTANDING fresh bread with flavor, slightly chewy, toasted crisp that manages to hold everything in perfectly.  Amped up mayo and spreads and fresh veg and micro greens that actually make sense (the flavor of the micro greens adds to the enjoyment of the sandwich).  Proteins, very well chosen and blend well with everything.  The Jamon Serrano, sweet porky goodness and cured funk that pairs well with the mushrooms.  The Botifarra; naturally cased, coarse ground seasoned pork; delicious and fatty, intensified by a great chimichurri mojo verde.  Finally the vaca saltada; braised beef with manchego cheese and an earthy chili mayo, just plain good eats.  Do try an order of patas bravas (deep fried thick potato wedges with a spicy aioli).  Fluffy on the inside, gently crisp on the outside, it makes a perfect, rich side to any sandwich.  Note: If you have not tried Iberico ham from black footed, acorn fed pigs, AND it's on offer here, go for it.  It might not be as good as that sold by places on the Strip but at 1/3 the price, unless you're a true gourmand, your tongue won't know the difference.  Prices are in line with the quality.  No foot long subs for $5 here.  If they only sold wine by the glass and that other famous Barcelona street food, churros.  Ahhhhh.  Be sure to check out their FB, IG, Twitter, and website to see where they are going to pop-up next.  An amazing food truck, well worth seeking out."}
{"text":"Boqueria Street brings heat to Las Vegas with their Spanish cuisine.  Boqueria Street are known for Bocata rolls which is a sandwich made with Spanish bread, not sliced, cut lengthwise. In Spain, it's considered humble food and its inexpensive has allowed it become a staple.  These guys bring serious eats when it comes to Bocata rolls everything is fresh, authentic and flavorful.   The Vaca Saltada is out of this world, the braised beef is so tender and juicy and its marinade is full of herbs and spices. Loaded with Manchego Cheese, Red Onion, Spicy Mustard and Chili Mayo. It's the perfect sandwich for this type of season, I should have bought a bunch to take it for a picnic.  If your looking for small bites the croquetas is a must have, They are deep fried into balls and stuffed with chicken, parmesan cheese and bechamel. After one bite I will never eat mozzarella sticks again, this tastes 1000x better so creamy and cheesy.     I hadn't tried everything on the menu, but by looks of it each item has had a lot of thought put into it.   This food truck is outstanding if you happen to find them, don't hesitate to check them out."}
{"text":"Just tried it, great sandwiches! Tried both the lobster and iberico sandwich and the vaca saltada. Totally different sandwiches, but both amazing. Chef Oscar's the best!"}
{"text":"My first try tonight at the farmer's market in Bruce Trent park. I wanted something different.  Spanish street food sounded interesting. It was recommended that I  try the chicken sandwhich, sorry I can't remember the proper name. The BEST thing I have eaten from a food truck! The chicken was moist, the bun was fried,  and the sauce!!!! The homemade fries had a nice crispy batter. I sure hope they are there every Wednesday. I want to tey more!!"}
{"text":"Fucking delicious... I thought item was small at first a little larger then hot dog but was filling... ingredients on point ... freeeeeesh bun warm and fluffy but crispy"}
{"text":"It makes me so sad that I don't live in Las Vegas, otherwise I'd make sure to catch Boqueria Street whenever I could. I first tried their Vaca Saltada at the Life is Beautiful festival and I fell in love, I began scheduling the rest of our weekend to make sure I could get a chance to grab another one before we headed home. Their sandwiches are so flavorful and the bread is phenomenal. I can honestly say I have never had a better sandwich in my entire life. And a major plus is the people who work there are so nice! I think I met the owner and he was super helpful! The next time in Vegas I'll be hunting this food truck down and inhaling all the Vaca Saltadas I can. I don't have a photo of this sandwich because I was way too busy devouring it to think of taking one but I noticed a few fellow yelpers posted some photos. You guys are awesome!!"}
{"text":"Finally got to try one of their amazing sandwiches. Lobster topped with Iberico Jamon. Well, there you have it. Two of my most favorite foods in one. Great buttered and perfectly toasted bun. Filled with pure delicious tender lobster and topped with the absolutely best ham in the world. No fancy restaurant or TV chef on or off the strip can make this any better. Definitely one of my top 3 food trucks in Las Vegas. You gotta chase this food truck down. When you find it it will be worth it!"}
