{"text":"I've been here 4 times since trying it for the first time in January. Hands down my favorite coffee in Tempe. The parking can be a little difficult around busier hours since it is located next to Four Peaks, but that is the only downside. Excellent service and products offered."}
{"text":"Great coffee by people who really know coffee. The owner is a coffee, tea, and wine sommelier which gives you an idea of the quality that comes out of this place. Not to mention now that they've opened up the bag there's a lot more room to work. Love the bar where you can see them roasting the beans."}
{"text":"This place is hip.. Coffee is as good as cartel.. but hey.. it's in my neighborhood. Can't wait to try their paninis though.. will come back for more coffee and workspace"}
{"text":"Great coffee, had the iced kenyan roast. However, had an issue with the workspace. Needed a power outlet for a charge and the only spot I could work was the bar along the front window. That became a problem as the sun started to glare me out. The main issue is one of the employees was stationed at the lounge area, which baffles me. I would've stayed longer, had lunch, and a couple more drinks, but had to leave as a result. Didn't want to raise an issue there in front of anyone, so hopefully theyll read this and keep the employees in the office instead of the customer area."}
{"text":"Amazing cold brew and cold drip coffee. The vibe is solid, the coffee is great, and the folks behind the counter are friendly and incredibly helpful. I was given a few samples on my first visit, which helped point me in the right direction, and now I've gone back every morning this week.

My only wish is that they would stay open until 8pm on Saturdays. This is definitely the place I'd like to hang out with a cold brew and relax before heading to Four Peaks."}
{"text":"You can have your coffee any way you want it. I appreciated the help we received in choosing what we wanted from the cashier. He also let us try the different coffee before making a decision. It's a lot of coffee for the price. I'm not a huge coffee snob so the difference between air pressed, cold drip, cold brew, blah blah, doesn't really say much to me so the tasting factor really helped."}
{"text":"Fantastic coffee shop. They do their own roasting and have a nice variety of coffee selections, as well as being methods. My boss, an espresso coneseuer, loves their roasts. Their tea blends are also amazing. The barristas have a good knowledge of the roasts and tea blends, and can certainly give good advice on being methods. The place some better seating now that it's expanded. I find myself coming back weekly for a cup of Turkish coffee and to grab a bag of espresso for the middle of the week."}
{"text":"Awesome tea selection!!! Love the rich, aromatic and robust Monkey King  Jasmine tea  Great chill and work environment"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite coffee/iced tea spot in the Valley. I have no problem waiting for something that is quality. I am actually glad that Infusion is hard to spot- because- I fear that the line will be around the block in short order. The vibe is chill, my latte is always done perfectly, I usually leave with an iced tea to go which is equally delicious, never bitter.The staff is always very helpful and courteous especially Jack and Jake."}
{"text":"This place has some of the best coffee in the valley that comes directly from their roasting company that is housed in the warehouse next store. They always have great cold brews on top and well as great lattes. The baristas are all very friendly and helpful at all times. It is a great place to spend time to study or do work now that it is open till 8 pm every night. The one downside is that parking can be tough at times when four peaks brewery next store is very busy."}
{"text":"Met them at the Farm....loved the tea I tried and Bought....!! Quite Wonderful..So here I am at Dear, Very cute and Wonderful Restaurant... The owner took us on a tour of the facility and I have to say it was Amazing , Educational. And a real Big TREAT..!!!  Dear is so much more to Tea and Coffee going on here ....Master craftsmanship...in the Brew....Thank You ...."}
{"text":"Excellent coffee, nice quiet place. It's better than Cartel. It was the best cappuccino I've ever had!"}
{"text":"I have consistently come to Infusion over the past several months at least twice a week. I love their selection of coffee, but their service warrants the two stars. My food orders are always wrong and need to be sent back to the kitchen, or they are missing elements that are mentioned in the menu. It also takes them between 20-30 minutes to make a Turkish coffee when there are only 1-2 other customers. That time frame is only relevant when they haven't forgotten to make your order altogether, which happens pretty often as well. 

The location has always been convenient for me, but I'm ready to move on to better service elsewhere."}
{"text":"Always passed by this place and finally decided to check it out and was not disappointed! The drinks are fresh and hit the spot! It is also a very welcoming and friendly environment. Whether you want to meet new people or just want a nice space to get some work done Infusion is by far the best coffee shop I've been to yet!"}
{"text":"This caf√© just blew my mind. We were immediately greeted upon walking in by a super sweet barista that knew the menu like the back of her hand. She gave us samples, suggestions, and opinions tailored to what we liked most about coffee. 
And oh my God the coffee. Roasted in-house, there is something new on the menu all the time. I tried there Papua New Guinea cold brew and was blown away. I've never had more fresh coffee and was unbelievably happy with my drink. This place is clean, organized, and employs some seriously awesome people. KEEP DOING WHAT YOU'RE DOING."}
{"text":"\"It's like Cartel but not pretentious. \"-wife. 
Delicious coffee about to try the waffles."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem! I was on the hunt for a new study location, and this place is perfect. Big, outlets by the tables, fantastic coffee. Not too cold inside, and the vibe is good for long days of studying. How did I not know about this place before??"}
{"text":"If you are a coffee purist, you won't be disappointed.  From roasting to preparation, this place takes coffee seriously.  Our barista was very friendly, knowledgeable and skilled.  After we enjoyed our lattes, we also bought their Bourbon Barrel Burundi roast beans and were given tips on proper grind which was much appreciated.  It's really good."}
{"text":"Update:  The person I was with bought two raspberry scones to go.  I mentioned to her that they look \"wet\" like a piece of pie.  If you know what a scone is, it's a somewhat dry pastry.  Sure enough, she told me when she went to eat them at home, they were wet and inedible. She said they appeared to be undercooked and were probably wrapped in plastic wrap while still warm.  Gross.  She agreed with me.  No need to return here.  I'd give 2 stars if I knew how to change the rating on this mobile app!  


Pro: Good iced Americano coffee, very, very friendly cashier.  We tried eggs, bacon, toast, rosemary potatoes (way too salty!), and French toast.  All were just ok, but definitely not memorable. 

Con: very limited seating.  There were 3-4 tiny tables crammed together in a corner.  Once seated in that corner, there was no ambience whatsoever-- all views were blocked. The seating that was more open to a view was a small high community counter/table with backless metal bar stools.  That might be okay for a quick cup of coffee, but not ok for sitting down for lunch.  

I tried this place based on Yelp reviews but I don't think I'll be back.  Just underwhelming and not comfortable for me."}
{"text":"You will not find a group of people more passionate about coffee in all of Arizona. Infusion sets the bar for all coffee shops in the state and is a must visit for anyone who loves coffee or are interested in learning more about coffee and tea. The baristas and owner are extremely personable and knowledgeable. The shop itself is also great with plenty of seating, a unique feel, and lots of room for activities."}
{"text":"This is where I learned everything about coffee. I took the SCAE coffee diploma class here, and the teacher Patrick is amazing. The coffee shop is also very nice. Friendly and skillful baristas, top quality coffees, and Great food. Try the crepes and it will blow your mind. Now I can't drink coffee anywhere else!"}
{"text":"Ordered a almond milk latte and orange juice. We waited literally 20 minutes for the latte and it came out without almond milk. I am glad I asked before drinking it because I am lactose intolerant. It took another 5 minutes to get the latte back with almond milk. We waiting 5 more minutes for orange juice and finally just had to walk out. We had somewhere to be and 30 minutes is way too long to wait for two drinks. Terrible. Will never come back. Thanks for wasting my money."}
{"text":"If you like coffee and tea, this is a must. If you want good food, go somewhere else. Small portions, only the rosemary potatoes had flavor, and the bread seemed like it was pre-cut white bread from a supermarket. Breakfast sandwich, crepes, and French toast are all not worth the money."}
{"text":"This place really knows coffee. Offering more different ways to get it brewed that I can count on my hand. Their selection of brews are incredible and the food was fresh and delicious. The workers were super nice and knew their stuff. My brew came with a complementary chocolate topped lemon cookie and a glass of ice water. Very nice.

I had a small issue with the wifi but ended up using the 5ghz instead which worked fine.

I would highly recommend you check this place out!"}
{"text":"Now that they added more seating this place has gone from a great coffee shop with nowhere comfortable to sit, to a great coffee shop with a nice atmosphere for studying/reading/working/catching up with friends, etc. btw, have then make your espresso drink with the Burundi beans! It's maybe the best cappuccinos I've had there, plus it's helping stimulate the Burundian economy which is on the verge of collapse and civil war. Great shop!"}
{"text":"The coffee here tastes great. I can only compare it to Jobot or Lux in the valley. 

The place is pretty small so not that many tables, but has a nice atmosphere and it's actually quite bright inside, which I enjoy while working here. The baristas are very friendly too."}
{"text":"Infusion Coffee and Tea crafters definitely made the whole drinking experience into an art form. They take special interest into their coffee and presumably their tea. Our cashier was very helpful, polite, and informative. I highly suggest grabbing a \"Cold Brew Flight\" so that you can taste the difference between their specialty if you have a friend or two with you it's even better so that you can all have a sampling. It's a lot of caffeine so be warned!"}
{"text":"Very laid back tucked away little gem. I love the overall vibe, the large variety of tea I definitely enjoyed. I didn't feel like leaving because I felt so relaxed. Staff was very attentive and kind. I would absolutely go back"}
{"text":"This place has the world best almond milk cappuccino! I finally can drink cappuccino without feeling sick all day!! You HAVE to try it it's sooo goood!!"}
{"text":"Black Coffee and Espresso: 5.0
Lattes n such: 4.5
Food: 4.0

After better exploring the relatively small (but rapidly expanding) Phoenix Coffee market, Infusion remains one of Phoenix's best roasters and best shops.

Black Coffee and Espresso: 5.0
Infusion delivers consistently delicious coffee in all its forms. Their espresso is fantastic, well balanced chocolate and fruit notes. Their cold brew \"push\" is flavorful and delightfully bright--lime and berries are the main flavors of this energetic brew, which among a sea of exclusively chocolately cold brews is a huge relief in the Arizona summer. And finally, their beans are simply delicious: I'm currently drinking a bourbon barrel Burundi as siphon, and oh man I am loving this blend of wine and blackberry flavors.

Lattes n such: 4.5
Infusion delivers lattes that rival their coffee, which says a lot. Thoroughly enjoyed the chai I've had here.

Food: 4.0
The Where's Patrick is delightful--I mean, how can you go wrong with egg on arugula and toast?

I only have one complaint: service here is friendly but often slow, so if you're in a time crunch, tread carefully. But if you do have the time...I can promise that Infusion is worth the wait."}
{"text":"If I could give 10 stars, I would. Infusion has the best coffee in the valley by far - if you haven't tried it yet, do yourself a favor and head in for an amazing cup! I've been several times, however today I stopped in and sat at the bar by the roasters. They offered a tour of the roasting lab and explained their entire sourcing and bean testing process. These folks don't mess around and have the highest standards for their beans. Best coffee in town, most knowledgeable roasters on staff, and cool laidback atmosphere inside. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This coffee roaster, tea company, and cafe is located in a neighborhood that probably doesn't get much foot traffic, but the quality of the coffee and tea is among the best in the Valley. It is more than worth the drive, bike ride, or long walk from the ASU campus. That's really saying something, because the coffee scene in Phoenix easily rivals Seattle."}
{"text":"Quirky interior, i was absolutely captivated by the cups displayed across the wall. The menu was never ending, drinks upon drinks but before I can dive into their never ending menu I go with the usual. For me a Cubano was right up my alley, plus we ordered a Indian chai. I was ecstatic to try the coffee but to my surprise it was bland and left so much to be desired. Big let down the chai tasted like a watered down chai, no taste whatsoever. Perhaps we just picked bad drinks but, if you can't make the basic drinks i wouldn't want to try the extensive menu. Interior was super cute, nice hang out, i only wish i could say the same as for their drinks!"}
{"text":"AH-MAY-ZING. A little snooty, but they have every right to be. They take the \"art of coffee and tea\" to a whole new level. I had an incredible rooibos latte. Lots of natural lighting, and a good amount of seating tucked into a small space. I will definitely be back next time I'm in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I cannot express enough how amazing this place is! I have been to many places and tried hundreds of coffees and teas, this is by far the best I've had! Their food is also actually pretty amazing, and it is hard to find superb food at coffee shops that is not $1000 in my opinion. The owner is an expert in coffee and tea and actually trains people and is somewhat of an idol in the coffee industry. Everyone that works there is so passionate about coffee and loves what they do, and they are by far the nicest baristas I've met! It has the best ambiance with plenty of space to sit since their amazing expansion! The interior is also amazing looking. They do many things to make sure that the quality is kept in their coffee and tea with things such as public clippings where anyone can go and try their coffee for free and learn a lot about the type of coffee you like and the process that goes into it! They also offer tons of classes in every area you can imagine, if you live or visit Tempe, Phoenix, or scottsdale and haven't been here your doing life wrong."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for over a year, and it's been generally good the whole time, but I today I was blown away - unfortunately, not in a good way. 

I've always gotten a large 4 shot iced almond milk latte, and it's always been around $6. Never had a problem with that. Today, I get the same exact thing, and my total comes out over $8! Now, apparently with the modifiers it came out that way. $1 per shot, two extra shots, and $.75 for almond milk. But that is WAY WAY too expensive for a standard quad shot with almond milk. And it's only 20oz, not even 24!

It really sucks because this place has the best atmosphere around, and their tea is excellent - but no way in hell should anybody ever have to pay $8 for my drink. And to be honest, I've had better at both Steve's and King."}
{"text":"Great coffee and food here. I had a macchiato and piccolo. Love coffee that doesn't require creams and flavored syrups to mask poor quality and preparation. Will definitely come here when I am in town."}
{"text":"Very nice interior and lots of room. It was blazing hot inside for some reason while we were that, but the weather was perfect outside. Love their selection of teas."}
{"text":"So, we had just rolled in from Ohio, walked into this super hip cafe, and saw they were offering Lavender Lattes. Being the creative type, I asked if I could get a Lavender Iced Tea. They were all too happy to accommodate my request and it was delicious!  Our experience was so great that we went back and took a friend with us. If you have a bit of a sweet tooth, the chocolate croissants are delish too!"}
{"text":"I think this is gonna be my spot. I live right around the corner and so far I've had the glacian (latte lightly sweetened by condensed milk) and the amazing nitro iced coffee. The baristas are super nice and I'm waiting for some gourmet waffles as I post this. Yessss"}
{"text":"This rating is for the network connection this coffee shop provides to its customers.

You can never joint the network.

If you're thinking of coming here to study, doing your online quiz/exam...rethink about it."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time today and was completely blown away with all of the coffee and tea options. The staff was very friendly, welcoming and extremely knowledgable about what they do. I will definitely be returning in the near future"}
{"text":"Infusion is a great spot to get a variety of single origin and blended coffees and teas. The cold brew is on tap and is really nice and smooth and not at all acidic. The atmosphere is a really comfortable lounge where one can work, study or chat with friends. Great spot overall and worth checking out should you find yourself in Tempe."}
{"text":"For all coffee(or tea) enthusiast this is a great spot to come with friends and share a cup of Joe. They have a large variety of selections, weekly coffee tastings and very friendly staff members. 
Come learn about coffee or explore new taste you never dreamed about. Oh yea the music was just on point the other day. Very chill."}
{"text":"Stopped by looking for something unique and that's just what I found. Baristas are extremely friendly, lots of smiles. Patrick the owner showed me around while I waited for my coffee. This is the shop your grandparents had, small shop, good conversation, amazing coffee. Taste the world in a cup!

Something I should add. They support Veterans"}
{"text":"No lie infusion coffee and tea house is the best coffee shop in Phoenix. And it's not even close. The coffee lab is a one-of-a-kind and the coffee shop is awesome. I spoke to the barista behind the counter who was telling me about the owner. Apparently he is world renowned in the coffee shop and is on a mission to brew the perfect cup. I believe it. The coffee was delicious. I'm planning to attend one of the coffee workshops they have in the coffee lab there. Can't wait to go back again soon. Again, by far the best coffee shop in Arizona. Authentic as can be"}
{"text":"This place is what would happen if the most hip and trendy Brooklyn cafe just got transported to Tempe. It was such a hipster fever dream in the best way possible. The place had a \"reclaimed former warehouse\" aesthetic balanced with pops of color, great art pieces, and an eclectic array of furnishings. 

They roast their own coffee here and know exactly what they're doing. I ended up getting a coffee that was made in a cocktail shaker mixed with honey and lemon. It was unlike anything that is being offered in a 25 mile radius. It is truly, a one-of-a-kind, artisanal experience. 

Ample street parking outside. There were 3 indoor sections, and one outdoor section. The clientele was mainly students of ASU, and there were ample outlets and places to work. 

This place is 30 minutes away from me, but might just be a new regular spot for me."}
{"text":"First time here, everything was amazing! I got a latte and a mate! Latte's flavor was not too bitter not to bland (I do not add any sweetener on my coffee). Tea was great, even with milk. I loved that the staff was great at explaining things and always willing to help you; very welcoming atmosphere. I also ordered the \"where's Patrick\" and I loved it. I enjoyed the bread with aoli that I would have loved to be even more covered with it. Aoli and cheese made the bread not too dry, and the mixture of the ingredients gives a pretty good balance of flavors. Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Very frustrated with the network here. You will find yourself sitting with no internet at this coffee shop. There are 3 people sitting next to me asking if i can joint the wifi. 
The answer is NO.
And I'm not coming back to this place!

Very very frustrating with this Coffee shop. This place bring me back to the 70s.

Wasted my Sunday."}
{"text":"This place was so cute! I graduated from ASU a couple of years ago and, at the time, there were not many coffee shops like this in the area. I was pleased to find this place while back for a visit. 

I spend about three hours sitting here working and it was very comfortable. The employees were friendly, my tea was good, and it felt clean. The decor was unique as well. The only downside is that some of the coffee machines were a little noisy, but I can deal with that. 

I will definitely be back in the future!"}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed this coffee and tea cafe. The barista was super nice and explained all the different ways they can serve their coffee, they have a range from Turkish, to French press with all the  others  in between that I've not heard of. 

They have so many different coffees because they roast right there. And they have a large selection of tea, from mate', matcha, to flavored and straight up green or black teas.  The  choices are endless. 

I loved the decor and feel of this place. Totally laid back with tables and chairs and also a couch in one of the sections. 

Nicely lite so you can see outside get the fee for the sun and still work on your laptop without glare. 

I ordered the tacos as they were the special of the day. They were amazing!!! The chicken was tender and flavorful. The corn tortillas were soft and the sauce had just the right heat.  It was so refreshing to find a place that serves good food as well as coffee and tea. 

Unfortunately they didn't have stevia as a sugar substitute, but  they did have honey and raw sugar. They have soy and almond milk for vegans. Wish they had coconut milk but the coffee was drinkable without any milk if need be. 

Definitely going back to this place soon!"}
{"text":"Pretty sure I found my new, favorite, legit coffee shop. Apart from the staff being friendly ( but not TOO, obnoxiously friendly) and knowing all the ins and outs of coffee, they had a great selection of coffee makers, roasters, french press and all sorts. My fiance and I went in on a hot day and were so pleasantly surprised to find this coffee shop right by Four Peaks. i got their cold brew and it was one of the best I have had. They also make their own coffee-type cocktails, and if I wasn't trying to control my sugar intake, I would have been ALL OVER IT!
My fiance got an iced americano, and again, perfection.
We will definitely be back, and kudos to the roast-master!"}
{"text":"Waited about ten minutes because the barista was busy chatting with people. Finally got a cappuccino that was just ok. I wouldn't mind waiting if the drink was high quality or if she was even working at all."}
{"text":"My partner and I love this new spot. The baristas are very warm and welcoming and it's clear that they are passionate about coffee and food! Always excellent customer service. They make the best latte I've had in the valley and their cold brews are delicious too. 

Make sure to stop in and try breakfast/brunch here as well. All of the food items we have tried were super tasty and cheaper & quicker than if we had ordered at a place like snooze or ncounter. Right now they have a spread of unique waffles infused with fresh herbs from their garden. 

Seems like a decent place to work in the mornings because it doesn't get crowded or loud. There's also a  patio that will be nice once the weather cools down."}
{"text":"Best coffee and tea you'll find in Tempe. Food is also delicious and the service is great! :)"}
{"text":"Excellent customer service, friendly service and great coffee and teas. We had a mix up with the order due to a Yelp issue.  Infusion folks called to straighten it out and gave us free beverages. Above and beyond kindness! I will be a loyal customer!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a neat little spot that has amazing food and coffee look no further. This place is amazing, great service, the chef is beyond skilled and there is so much rooms which makes it feel spacey even when there are a lot of people. If you're in the area, I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I always pass this cute lil' coffee & tea shop as it is located right next to my apartment, and I'm glad I finally decided to stop in! Everyone is so welcoming and friendly, and the service is great!! And, their drinks are even better. So far I've tried their Moroccan Mint iced green tea and their Southern Belle iced green tea (I loveeee my green tea). Both were so flavorful and refreshing, and I can't wait to try more!! My friend ordered their iced dirty chai and said it was one of the best she's had. They also created such a nice, relaxing coffee shop atmosphere-- from the aesthetic to the music playing. Whether you're planning on meeting a friend to catch up over a cup of joe or you need to grind on some homework-- this is the perfect spot!"}
{"text":"Awesome place. So relaxing. Just loved it. Evan is a wonderful asset to this business. So personable and knowledgeable of their brands."}
{"text":"New to coffee and having fun with it.  How many can have coffee roasted by the 2015 World Barista champion Sasa Sestic?  I've learned so much about coffee because of owner Patrick O'Malley.  Can't wait to take his home brew class.  So many amazing teas and coffee to chose from.  This is not hipster coffee.  Infusion is about someone that has dedicated his life to coffee for decades.  Barista training, roasting training, coffee equipment for businesses.  So many amazing coffee places in the world, one is right here in Tempe."}
{"text":"I just found Infusion - but already it's my favorite coffee shop in Tempe (really in the whole valley). Infusion has a great atmosphere, an amazing (and huge) selection of coffee and tea that they roast on-site, and a wonder staff that is extremely helpful. When I have time, I drive from Gilbert to hang out here!"}
{"text":"Friendly service, nice atmosphere, pretty chill. I had a yummy caprese sandwich and the best iced dirty Chai. Mother had a breakfast sandwich and amazing coffee."}
{"text":"Some of the kindest barista staffs I've ever encountered!! The tea was delicious and I want like 65 more chocolate croissants!!"}
{"text":"The best iced tea anywhere. This is the same tea they serve at Federal Pizza and Postino. The passion fruit and desert blossom are perfectly done. There's free parking, so easy to get in and out. Seriously, the best iced tea."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this coffee place for the last few months and I have to say this is the most authentic place for coffee or tea. The customer service and the atmosphere is great here. The tea selection is the largest I have ever seen."}
{"text":"Yerba Cordoba was bomb.  Biscuits even better. 

Hot tea, quickly put together. 

Unlimited hot water refills to get multiple steeps. Awesome tea."}
{"text":"I think I found my new coffee spot in Tempe. This place has plenty of street parking and the space is spacious. Plenty of inside and outside seating.

Their cold brew is excellent. Refreshing, strong, and smooth."}
{"text":"Coffee is really well brewed and they have coffee from all over brewed in multiple styles. The staff is super friendly and the atmosphere is great for groups or for you to come and just be alone. Great little gem next to four peaks"}
{"text":"Nice, well lit, decently priced. Coffee wasn't as hot as I prefer but cashier was very friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"A new place to try out with a friend and the ambience is nice/welcoming. I didn't try their selections of tea or coffee but they do offer smoothies. The mango smoothie was okay; not too bad but alright to start the morning with. Price for the drink was questionable. The decor is very different with a kick. Definitely a nice place to grab something and do business at."}
{"text":"This place is very cool. Lots of space and perfect if you want to do some work at a coffee shop. We came in for breakfast and learned that they are adopting a new business model and no longer serve food... only coffee/tea and some pastries. But since many have posted pictures on yelp of their food people assume they have a full kitchen. My husband really loved their coffee and the tea was excellent (but pricey). The almond croissant I had was decent and my kids liked their bagel with cream cheese. The service was super! Friendly and accommodating. Place was clean and ambience was fantastic... if I lived in the area it would quickly become a favorite spot."}
{"text":"Way off the beaten path.  Best coffee in Arizona.  No poofy barristas here.  Just coffee fanatics that know their coffee and know how to present each coffee in the right way.  Worth the drive or Uber."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed Infusion, the ambience was just what I needed for some out of the house study time . The barista Evan was knowledgeable, had perfect customer service and was quite handsome for a young man . Evan listened to what I was in the mood for and offered perfect suggestions. Free wifi and very clean restrooms only put icing on the cake. I'll definitely be returning to this home away from home environment. Peace & Light"}
{"text":"Wow!!! Amazing coffee .good vibes they could have more food options.. but thats just a suggestion ! The coffee is so damn good! Go get some!"}
{"text":"Just opened few days ago. They're figuring out their place fully yet. But a very authentic genuine coffee place. One of those places which are really passionate about their coffee (and tea). 
They're pros in the coffee business. They know their stuff.
Most importantly the coffee is good. Very good. They're super friendly. 
The cafe as such is small. Not too much seating. They have a patio, should be functional soon. Not the very comfy, sit for long hours kind of coffee place (yet). 
Definitely my goto places for good authentic coffee."}
{"text":"What a gem! This is right across the street from where I used to live as a little kid (back in the day when my folk's were in graduate school at ASU), and boy has the area changed! I had a little bit of a hard time finding parking at first, but then I noticed that once the parking lot fills up, everyone just pulls into the back, which was fine. The coffee shop itself is wonderful. The space larger than I initially thought after I noticed the connecting room. We found a nice little corner with plenty of room to work and there are outlets around as well. I ordered a hot mint tea for my friend and an iced African Rooibos for me. I absolutely loved the rooibos tea; it was so light and calming. The hot teas come with three little hourglass timers so you can steep to the perfect strength for you. It also came with a little cookie/biscuit. We spent a good two or three hours here catching up and studying. It is definitely a nice spot to get work done or meet up with friends. I really loved the ambience."}
{"text":"Really good stop for a late night coffe or tea. Nice and quiet, just want I like about late night coffee shops"}
{"text":"Best Coffee-Real Coffee!! Patrick, a true Roastmaster keeps his staff extremely knowledgeable and professtional. Food is superb. A must experience. Go and be amazed.
Steve-Bartending Academy.Tempe"}
{"text":"Best coffee ever at this coffee shop. Look out Starbucks they have your  coffee beat. Looking to see if they have one in my neighborhood the one i went to is down in Tempe.  Worth the drive!!"}
{"text":"Great service, friendly staff, and delicious tea. I got a mix of blackberry green tea and mate tea based on their recommendation and it was great. They also have a huge selection. It has a lot of seating and great internet so it's a perfect place to study."}
{"text":"I have to say it's kind of hard to park here, you always need to find somewhere else that is close to the restaurant next door. Overall, the quality of coffee is great, and I liked the cookie they gave! The ornament indoors is stylish. It was fun to see the people actually working at the back to deal with coffee beans."}
{"text":"This place has great coffee and amazing tea. I love their expansion so you can get hunkered down for some solid work in the computer. The staff is always friendly and environment is great. Keep coming back!"}
{"text":"This spot is right next to Four Peaks Brewing on 8th street, so the parking can get a little difficult in the afternoon.  We stopped by in the morning (coffee hours) instead of the afternoon (beer hours) so we were able to get a spot right in front.  Infusion has a small quaint eating and sitting area and a nice patio when the weather cools off.  I ordered a caramel latte and it was so buttery and creamy.  It reminded me a lot of the one at Cartel.  Delicious.  My hubby didn't really know what to get because there were a ton of choices.  The guy at the register didn't really help much but the guy making the coffee offered a few suggestions.  My hubby still felt a little misguided though, so I hope on the future the cashiers are also schooled on the coffee so they are able to make suggestions to the customers.  They sell bags a coffee beans and every type of press/roaster you can imagine."}
{"text":"Coffee: 5 stars (not very acidic or burnt tasting, these people KNOW their coffee) 
Teas: 5 stars (lots of variety, different flavors available. Heck, there's a WALL full of tea for purchase) 
Ambiance: 5 stars
Food: 4.5 (have an assortment of french pastries, bagels. To be honest, I'm gluten free, had a croissant once and it was pretty good)
Customer Service: 6 stars (definitely go above and beyond to make sure we're happy)
Wi-Fi Internet: 5 stars (fairly consistent internet - had a hiccup a few weeks back but they promptly took care of it, probably best consistent internet I've ever had) 
Paul, the Roaster's Conversations: 6 stars (he's fairly knowledgeable about diverse topics, can fix really anything with WD-40 and bilingual). It's kind of neat to watch him roast coffee and do what he does, good background entertainment. 

Overall: 5 stars

Just overall a really neat place to be. Baristas are cool and make good coffee. I practically live here."}
{"text":"I have been to a lot of coffee houses, this place by far has the best cold brew coffee thus far. And, the food is fantastic too!"}
{"text":"This place is so cute and I am so sad I haven't been here before! I ordered the tiger chai tea latte with soy and it is amazing! I am for sure going to try their infused coffee. They have so many different types of coffees and teas I was overwhelmed. Need to come back here and do some studying while I am still living in the area! A must try!:)"}
{"text":"Atmosphere was chill, plenty of places to sit. I felt the coffee and tea was a bit overpriced but cute place to go study or get some work done."}
{"text":"Ambiance is good with lots of natural lighting. Coffee is overpriced (I paid about $6) but the quality doesn't reflect the price. Studying was extremely difficult. There was a group of people in the middle table and they were incredibly loud; there was no background music to drown out their voices, so everyone could hear their entire conversation. Maybe I just came at an off time, but I probably won't be back here again"}
{"text":"This place is great, I get my usual cold brewed iced coffee which is less acidic with tons of caffeine. The staff is laid back and it is a nice place to bring company or to have a meeting. And smells like fresh roasted coffee . Looks like they serve breakfast now too, I will be trying it out next time ."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I've been to many coffee shops but this one had me gushing from the start. The art and decor reminds me of some I have seen in an African plantation. The taste of the coffee was amazing! (They recommended something fantastic after I asked for something sweet.) Also, they have a lending library and we were also offered a tour. I would definitely one back to this place and tell my friends about it."}
{"text":"So glad this little spot opened. Was riding by and saw that it was actually here, I happened to be looking for breakfast! Its very cool use of space, I think it might be difficult with a large group. Panini sandwich is an excellent way to do breakfasts...but ketchup is a good thing to have on hand if you make breakfast. It has a long shelf life and people tend to put it on breakfast. Cool spot, bike rack right outside."}
{"text":"Cozy atmosphere, serving expertly crafted coffee. These guys don't mess around. I got the latte that was served at the perfect temperature, excellent microfoam, and complimented with a sugar cookie. If you appreciate coffee, this place won't disappoint."}
{"text":"Really interesting variety of tea, coffee, and espresso drinks.  It's apparent that they are intent on nabbing some of the coffee crowd in Tempe.  The taste is excellent.  The person today said they were planning on expanding.  That's good, because the sitting room in the place is a little awkwardly crowded.  The room is simply an awkward shape.

This place isn't quite off the ground yet but I enjoyed my time in here today.  It's never more than half full but that usually means you can get an outlet for laptops.  There are three, not one as someone mentioned.  The other two are by the seat cushions near the entrance.

Overall I'd say it's somewhere that will reliably have seating room, good drinks, and a decent environment to get a few hours of work done.

Edit: After coming here several more times I'm upgrading this to a five-star from the perspective of getting work done.  The music is on point, the prices are crazy low, there's always space, and the staff is friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"The affagoto was the best I've ever had here. I came on a cloudy and winter day and they have a seat inside that has an open area as if you were sitting outside  This reminded me of San Diego. This place is a great coffee shop and I will be back"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the atmosphere in this coffee/tea shop.  Their food looked delicious and the iced green tea I got was so flavorful!  I would definitely come back to try their other teas."}
{"text":"Really cute place! Rustic without the dingy, like a lot of coffee shops. They seem to be very serious about good coffee. They roast their own and you can see the roaster. Lots of great tea options! And my friend got a drink called the Bees Knees which was iced espresso, lemon, and honey - very refreshing for those who want iced tea but their coffee addiction won't let them. I got a hot chai tea latte made with traditional loose leaf tea. I asked for honey in it and I wished it had a little more and were sweeter, but I do appreciate that it wasn't a sugar filled drink like most places. Customer service was great, super friendly, even offered to give us a tour of the roaster room when we were peeking in! So far this is my fave coffee place in the valley (other places I've been - Sip, Kings Coffee, and Press)."}
{"text":"Such a great place to meet a friend for a cup of coffee.  It has seating inside and outside, which is perfect when the weather is behaving! Awesome staff as well. I will defined be returning."}
{"text":"Food was good quality and filling. The staff was really friendly and were able to give good menu recommendations. We even got a tour of their production when they heard it was my husbands first time. Paul gave us the tour and even let us know of the cool classes they offered. We will definitely be back for food, coffee, and training!"}
{"text":"I was so disappointed in this place! I had seen it while taking a walk and had really been wanting to see what it was all about. So, the other morning I decided to check it out, finally! When I walked in there was 1 man behind the counter. Didn't look up. Didn't say hello. Nothing. I then sheepishly said, I've never been here before. Crickets. I felt embarrassed and ignored! I had wanted help with the menu, it's broad and there were some drinks i had questions on. That's all. What's worse is after another few seconds he walked in the back then came out again and still didn't seem to want to help me. I turned around and just walked out and went to Dutch Bros. They are always nice and cheery there. Maybe Dutch Bros can give Infusion a few pointers on hospitality."}
{"text":"Met Karen W. here today for a much-needed review update.  My first (and last) visit was back in March, and while I enjoyed the Galician latte-   which I'd heard from a Spaniard yelp reviewer was definitely an \"original\" menu item, since he's never heard of such a latte to be found anywhere in Spain!- I complained about how hot it was indoors even though it was only 85 degrees outside.  I hoped that it would be a lot cooler indoors today, and it was.  However, it was a lot warmer in the other rooms, so we decided to sit in the main room.  

We couldn't decide what to try- the DB, which is a cold brew and lemonade WITH mango and habanero added, or the Pumpkin spiced latte, so I thought why not order one of each and have them split? https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/infusion-coffee-and-tea-tempe?select=FrZmPrzNmnxGHUdbO5jmXw  Karen ordered the cold brew, which Evan tried to make a large order of and just split into two glasses, but he said that didn't quite work out, so he just made two smaller doses, while I ordered two small hot PSLs.  I really enjoyed the DB from the first sip, while I VERY MUCH disliked the latte.  I believe this was the very first latte I've disliked so intensely, and it was because of its high acidity-- why so sour??  I meant to ask Evan if I could just have a Galician latte made to replace this, but he told me I'd have to wait since he was in the midst of preparing someone else's coffee.  I returned to my seat and conversation with Karen, and the short wait turned into a much-longer wait when Evan suddenly was inundated by a run of at least five other customers who showed up.  It was too late for me to clarify my request, so I just hoped that the \"do-over\" will taste better.  Evan said he used a \"finer grind to remove some of the coffee's acidity,\" but the new cup tasted exactly the same.  I decided to copy Karen and dunk the two cookies in the latte.  The flavors were tolerable this way, but I didn't do much damage and pretty much wasted two cups of PSL coffee.  (If you want a great cup, go try Peixoto's seasonal offering of Buttered pumpkin latte, which contains pumpkin puree... it is heavenly!)

I would order another DB in a heartbeat, but I think I'll stay away from the hot coffee drinks and check out the teas instead, which Karen says are excellent here, should we decide to meet at Infusion again."}
{"text":"Nice coffee shop.  Nice location and nice feel to the place.  But the internet goes down all the time!  I've been in three times over the last six months and have left every time because of the on again off again connection.  Which is a shame, it's a nice place."}
{"text":"The yelp menu is wrong and hey do not have any good options except for over the counter sandwiches which are called snacks. 

Seems like a cool place but I was searching for breakfast and a coffee but they said the menu changed over a year ago. Pretty misleading. Disappointed."}
{"text":"Coffee heaven! We had actually first discovered Infusion Coffee and Tea through a Chandler festival where they were serving finely crafted espressos and cappuccinos. We mentally bookmarked this place as a cafe to visit sometime.

After sadly discovering that no Kona coffee was being offered at the Aloha Festival, I had remembered that Infusion was near this area and could at least satisfy our needs for a fine caffeinated brew. The cafe is situated a few doors down from Four Peaks, and has its own small dedicated private parking lot. 

I browsed through the menu and was excited when I saw they had affogato! Espresso and gelato, how can you go wrong with that? The presentation of it was very nice and this is the only affogato I've had that has come with a selection of berries, walnuts, and a separate cup for the gelato and the espresso. It was like eating and drinking a full dessert plate. The espresso itself had a rich caramel-colored crema, a shot of coffee perfection! The intense, almost chocolatey flavor meshed well with the creamy sweet gelato. I also tried some iced mate tea, which had an earthy deep flavor, yet was still refreshing.

Service was outstanding and the young woman taking our order was extremely personable and sweet. 

Definitely stop by here for a great cup of coffee or tea. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Came here with a few friends the other day and really enjoyed it. The atmosphere of the caf√© is very trendy and the baristas were super nice. The iced Matcha Tea latte is a new favorite of mine!"}
{"text":"Had a great cup of coffee here. I asked for a suggestion of a latte and the Barista suggested the vanilla lavender latte it sounded a bit peculiar but it was actually very enjoyable service was excellent atmosphere perfect."}
{"text":"Great coffee and a cool place to get some work done. I come by anytime I am in town. You can also purchase beans here."}
{"text":"This coffee & tea is legit! Patrick and his staff are awesome. Enjoyed an iced coffee and tour of the cafe & classroom. You can take classes there. Can't wait to take one! Espresso Italia is right next door which sells to businesses. If you see Miscela De Oro & Infusion Tea at your favorite restaurant you are in for a treat!!"}
{"text":"Always looking for a great cup with knowledgeable staff behind the counter. I came in on a rainy day and ordered a black pour over Liquid Pie. It had a nice subtle sweetness with a bit more acidity than I was expecting. Overall not bad but I'm not sure if I'd order it again. They have a huge coffee/tea menu though so I'll be sure to come back to try something new. Staff was nice and attentive and seemed somewhat knowledgeable about their product. Take note that they have little parking spaces so street parking may be your only option."}
{"text":"Love the ambiance. Great service. It was my first time because it was recommended and I would recommend it as well. I got the peach apricot tea and it's very good, super refreshing. I would love to go back and try more. The style of the place is wonderful, I love how unique the layout is. Lots of seating, family friendly."}
{"text":"Good coffee and food!!! Not very conducive to studying, relaxing and reading, or getting anything productive done though in my opinion. The seating and decoration is really nice and on point, but the music is kind of obnoxiously loud. Rock songs that were popular in the 90s - 2005 were playing, which is cool and all but not really matching the vibe in my opinion. Tried to put on something more relaxing and better to focus with, but could still hear the loud rock through my earbuds. Maybe it's just how it is today? If this is how it always is, I'll come here when I want to just chat with friends, but if I want to study or something, I'll go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I'll be honest and say that the latte art is what brought me here. However, I can now say that the customer service, coffee itself, and environment are what will keep me coming back every time I'm in the area!

For this first time, we just had coffee and didn't try any of the other drinks and food. We had the white chocolate mocha latte w/ almond milk substitute and another coffee but I forgot the name. I enjoyed what I ordered! Since they had a large menu, I wasn't sure what to get so the barista helped me out and talked me through some of the best options for what I wanted that night. He was very knowledgeable, friendly, and definitely knew what he was doing! Of course, the art came out beautifully as well so that excited me a little bit, but not as much as the latte itself. 

Since it was a quiet Thursday night, we were able to sit down and just enjoy our coffee. It was definitely a nice experience and I will be back!"}
{"text":"Infusion is the place that I've called home for the past six months and as a result I've gained the four best friends I've ever had in my life. Infusion isn't just a coffee place, Infusion cares about you and who you are and how your day has been, and they actually legitimately care. Infusion is the most welcoming, hospitable, friendly, and accommodating place I've ever had the privilege of being a part of."}
{"text":"Infusion is my every day spot. Coffee and tea purists, and it's consistent. Great, friendly customer service and awesome atmosphere. You don't need cream or sugar ok?!! Killer cold brew too. Get here."}
{"text":"I was at a coffee shop in Tempe trying to get some work done, but its Internet had crapped out. I turned to my phone, hoping to find another coffee shop nearby. I know Cartel is nearby, but I hoped for something else. Sure enough, I spied this \"Infusion\" place right near my old Four Peaks Brewery hangout.

It looks like the area along the old railroad tracks is getting some much-needed love, and Infusion is just one new-looking business that's opened. I saw signs outside advertising two different types of cold brew on tap. I have a hard time resisting cold brew on tap, so that's what I chose rather than my default cappuccino. 

It was a very rich, chocolately cold brew. If you ever need to stay up for 137 hours, drink a few of these. The barista helped me choose which cold brew to order with very solid descriptions of their taste. I'm looking forward to trying the other drinks at Infusion.

It is a smaller space, and not quite as comfy or roomy as a few others (especially if you have a small person). But it's definitely a nice space, and they're clearly into making top-quality coffee drinks."}
{"text":"This coffee shop roasts excellent coffee and always has a large variety on hand. They expanded and have more seating now and I like that, especially on a day like today where the doors are open for some fresh air and a mild breeze. 

I am taking one star off for the complicated pricing and lack of a price board. 
The pricing is complicated because almost every brewed coffee has a different price, and the coffee descriptions at the counter do not list prices. There is a separate menu for pricing. And I wish they'd just advertise a \"double shot\" for espresso since that's the American default. Both of these situations yield surprises when the register rings it up. 

Also, the WiFi is so godawful slow, they shouldn't bother offering it. I clocked it around 1-1.6 mbps depending on the test. 

Great coffee, worth visiting, but know ahead of time you're looking at about $5 for a brewed coffee and more for cappuccinos and lattes."}
{"text":"I'm giving a four because I've been here once and the experience was good. Just need to try again to solidify into a five star. 

So I'm a pretty conservative guy. You
Might not expect me at a place like this .... a little more hip place than a lot of my friends would go to. But I like coffee, espresso, and cool and innovative coffee shops and bars that do something different and have high quality products. 

This place is cool. First of all, it makes me want to get into tea more and buy an infuser. About the coffee, I had a mocha. Excellent and not disgustingly sweet -- rather, a hint of mocha but still with an espresso flavor, not masked by a load of chocolate syrup. The croissant,well --- amazing. Very authentic. Flaky, buttery, like a real croissant. Not a puffed up giant pillow that you often find in most places. I don't know who bakes them, but I want to find out. 

You can but all kinds of coffee and samplers. They roast their own, too. 

Anyway, they're a little out of the way for me, but I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Alright, so I'm currently sitting in this coffee shop a little peeved. I came here to get some work done. Ordered my coffee, sat down, put in the wifi password, and the system tells me I have it incorrect. After a few tries I go back to the front desk and the barista says \"Oh yeah. We had someone who was putting it in perfectly yesterday too. I don't know what's wrong.\" Eventually after a few more tries, I got it to work. 

Orrrrr not. The system is now kicking me out every three minutes. The coffee is good, but man, it's really frustrating to go to a coffee shop to study only to not be able to do just that. Unfortunately this experience is spoiling it for me. Fix your wifi, or don't provide it at all. This intermittent stuff is infuriating though.

The coffee here is pretty good, but $$$$$$. Baristas are decent too. I may have to come back and try it as a place to sit down at some point. For now though, 2 stars seems appropriate.... mostly cause I'm not able to do what I need to."}
{"text":"A friend suggested we try Infusion Coffee for a change. Am I ever glad she did! Friendly staff, calm & comfortable seating, great coffee. I love coffee, not fancy flavored sweetened coffee, real coffee with a little cream. This is the place! Want a pour over Guatemalan blend, or a in house blend, they have them.  I don't care about the wifi, I want to relax & drink great coffee & this is the place!"}
{"text":"The tea is where it's at. These guys offer tea blends that you won't find anywhere else in the valley. A small but clean space. Only wish they were located in downtown Phoenix as that's where Arizona's real coffee and tea culture resides."}
{"text":"This place is a little tucked away gem. Can't wait to come back and try something different. Great atmosphere and friendly staff, just wish it was closer to where I lived"}
{"text":"This coffee shop opened about 2 days ago, and we delightfully stumbled upon this shop unfortunately it was closed but we still went inside, met the owners and they showed us their vision. I look forward to trying the coffee. But look forward even more to one of the coffee classes they will be offering.

In the back they have different rooms to roast coffee, rate coffee, and learn how to brew coffee. The acience of coffee will be aurely aluve at this place. Loved the atmosphere and they were auper friendly and excited. This place looks like it will be a gem."}
{"text":"This place is a gem!!!  Awesome people and great service!  Evan and Paul just gave us a tour and shared awesome coffee and tea with us!  Check them out, this place has the best coffee I've ever had.  Can't wait for public tasting class this Saturday"}
{"text":"Like your place and the coffee, visit often, but the wifi really needs some improvement, slow and keeps on disconnecting..."}
{"text":"Passed by this place on 8th st.  From the side of the road it's easy to miss.  The parking lot is pretty tight even on a sunday. This is really close to four peaks restaurant.  

When walking in you are greeted by a barista they were helpful explaining their menu.  Alot of their coffees displayed in their side room gave off the impression that they were from around the world some beans from indonesia.  When my coffee came out there was much to be desired.  The latte for one was in a baby cup it looked like I was jipped 3 oz from a regular 8oz cup $4 btw.  Also,  I was very excited to try the glacian latte which had condensed milk.  I could barely taste the condensed milk and also the coffee didn't have the caffiene boost I was looking  for... Although, the baristas were friendly and the shop is cute the drink was overpriced for what I got and missing flavor."}
{"text":"Good coffee and good place to work! (Music is a tad loud for my taste.)


WiFi password: TheBestCoffee"}
{"text":"Wonderful laidback coffee and tea shop shop that's right by ASU's campus without the crowds normally associated with ASU. The iced teas and cold brew mocktails are excellent!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed coming here with a friend for a Sunday afternoon coffee meeting! It is located right in Tempe and is not far from a light rail stop. The guys working were very nice and the place itself is definitely an attraction to stop at when in the area. The coffee and smoothies are great, however on a hot day, the building is steaming hot, possibly because of the many windows. Beware of parking also, there are maybe 5 spots for this location, the rest of the parking is what you can find on the street..."}
{"text":"I don't like to leave bad reviews. At all. I believe in communicating issues with the staff/owner directly if there is an obvious improvement there can be made. So, this is a disclaimer that I gave this place several chances before writing this. 

First of all, why two stars, not one a.k.a positives: 

- Coffee is usually amazing here. I have to tell I've had different experiences with different baristas but generally, it is very good. 

- Also, it reminds me of home thanks to Turkish roasters they use. 

The bads: 

- Wifi: Consistently not working. Horrible. I spent hours in total several times trying to fix it as I was made to believe it is because of my computer. Well, they should owe me a few hundred bucks for identifying their issue. It is their router. How do I know? I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science with years of experience. I can give details about why only the IPV6 address is assigned and IPV4 is not working causing not usable network for most sites upon request. 

- Today's experience: In my last visit after, the first question I asked was this: \"Is your Wifi working stable now?\" This was today, a few months after my last visit because of the very same problem. Gentleman on the counter was very assuring. He said they have fixed all their issues and it was robust. No, it was not. I again spent an hour trying to resolve the issue from 2 computers and 2 phones. I was able to force my adapter to receive an IPV6 address but internet still did not work for most sites. An employee suggested that \"they have upgraded their internet to the highest speed\" so it should be working. According to him, my computer was the problem. He said there was another customer having the same problem(!) another day and he was able to figure it out as he was very good with computers. When I tried to explain to what the issue really is he was uninterested. Well, maybe you guys can go buy a \"faster internet\" package to resolve your issue. The barista softly said \"sorry\" when I was leaving after wasting an hour trying to fix their network. 

- The consistency of not caring: I have encountered network problems in all my 5 visits to this place. Every time the same thing happens: I ask the barista if the network issue was sorted out he says yes and it is not working. When I bring it up nobody cares. Again, this happened 5 times over several months. You might not care about your network but you do not have a right to waste my time by falsely offering the service. 

I hope I had the time to visit here without having to work on stuff at the same time. However, my routine is to visit a coffee shop when I need a different comfortable atmosphere working on my research while enjoying a good cup of coffee. Infusion only has good coffee and unfortunately not the other things that I and most of my friends expect from a coffee shop: Good service and a stable internet connection."}
{"text":"Love love Infusion! I used to live right across the street from here so it was nice to be able to get coffee/tea whenever I pleased. The place is super easy to find, parking can be a little tricky when it is busy but honestly it's worth the walk if you have to do so. The employees are all very friendly and well educated on the menu when you have questions. The place is super cute inside, there's outdoor seating and also a back room with couches and also a few chairs and tables to eat at. Free WiFi is also available here which is awesome if you come to do any work! I've had their breakfast sandwich which was delicious! The iced dirty chai is amazing and probably the best I've had in Tempe so far!"}
{"text":"Biggest coffee and tea menu I've ever seen. Great place to hangout and chat, read a book or catch up on work. Ginger Blackberry iced green tea on a 20 oz glass was perfect."}
{"text":"I have been to a lot of coffee shops in the Phoenix area, and this by far is the best coffee place I have been to. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"There's plenty of seating here - the cafe seems to have three sections. The first section is where the cash register is and it's near the entrance, adjacent to the parking lot. The next section has three tables - all of them have outlet access and there's a window looking into where they hold coffee brain storming (?) or training sessions. And then the last section is way in the back - there's a couch area and high seats that overlook the coffee grinding. So, this last section does get pretty noisy. It's also very warm here because there's a glass garage door that lets in a lot of sun. Yea, I was sweating when I came to study here pretty recently."}
{"text":"I was excited to come here, but was very disappointed!!  First of all, we tried to order their \"cold brew flight\" and were told that they only had 2 of the 6 cold brews available. Then I ordered an affogato, which was supposed to be ice cream with coffee and fresh fruit.  When I got my $7.50
affogato, it was just a small scoop of ice cream with a shot of espresso and no fruit.  When I asked for it they told me that was an old picture and menu description. What a rip off!!  There are so many better coffee shops. Don't waste your money here."}
{"text":"Ahhhhh ! How aboutThis gem that I just found!! Ahhhhh please everyone if you love coffee and or tea! Or just need a nice little place to study! Please try this place out! The guy I am sorry i don't remember his name but he was so nice and very open to answering questions! It's my new study spot so if you see me say hi"}
{"text":"This place is the bees knees. Talk about great service and a passion for their product. Also, the smells are wonderful and make me happy. Apparently the owner travels around the world sourcing products. How incredible is that? If you take a look at one of the clocks on the wall, you can see exactly where he is and the time. Dubai is where he's currently at, FYI. 

Drinks: I needed something that wasn't straight coffee as it was later in the day. I got chatting with Jake, the barista, and he told me about this special they'd concocted, the Bees Knees. Espresso, honey, lemon, and water over ice. Questionable? Perhaps. Delicious? Most definitely. This drink was incredibly refreshing and I'm probably going to order it whenever I come back. 

Service: I adore places that have good service. Pretentious baristas at coffee shops make me question the establishment and all that it holds dear. This place rocks. As my friend and I were walking out, we took a peek through the window where some roasting equipment was sitting. A guy walking by us seemed enthused and asked us if we wanted a tour. Heck yes we did! Unfortunately, we were running to an appointment and couldn't make that work. Raincheck? 

Atmosphere: this is a great study or date spot. It has pretty quiet background music that doesn't get in the way of conversation. The place is filled with coffee smells, at-home coffee equipment for sale, and of course, bags of tea and coffee. 


Love it. I'll be back."}
{"text":"It was my first time here, so naturally I asked the Barista what she recommended/the most popular items here. Unfortunately, she directed me to read the menu, which is huge and didn't narrow it down any for me. I stuck with a cold brew, since I wasn't able to try anything special to this store, I cannot review on their coffee/tea. 

However, the WiFi is a mess. It hardly works. So as for a study space, I wouldn't recommend. It's also a much younger crowd, so beware of that as well."}
{"text":"This place was so good I came here twice in one day (I know, I'm a sick human, but to my credit once was while waiting for friends and once was with said friends). It's about time the east valley got a truly delish coffee location. This place roasts their own beans (kudos!) and spends ample time making their coffee drinks. The space is cute, warm, and comfortable with a variety of seating options (tall chairs, short benches), especially for their small space. They feature their coffee roasting equipment in the space, which is neat to see. The barista I spoke with was knowledgeable about their coffee and tea. I ended up getting a dirty chai and it was extremely tasty. The only issue is it did take a long time to get my drink, and when I came back with friends it also took quite some time. So why no dock in stars? Because I feel that they used the extra time to make all of the drinks meticulously. I can't fault them for that. I will definitely be back!


PS they have wonderful looking breakfast options here...next time!"}
{"text":"For a place that pretends to be a high-end specialty coffee destination, the coffee was tasteless from the latte to the cappuccino.
Also, the service was way too slow for a quiet monday morning.
Would not recommend to coffee connoisseurs."}
{"text":"Infusion is doing so many special things here. That's why I fell for this place pretty hard. As I'm writing this, I'm drinking a cup of their barrel aged bourbon coffee. What?!? Seriously...who does that? It is totally delicious and unique. A definite special coffee experience. I love how creative their drinks are. Oh! And the staff is really helpful & personable. I can tell they love what they do."}
{"text":"Infusion Coffee & Tea caught my attention today while searching google maps for coffee spots nearest me. The location was a bit hard to find parking for, however the coffee is outstanding. The team members were attentive, friendly, and kept the dining area very clean. I will definitely be recommending this location to friends and family looking for a tasty cup of coffee while in the Tempe area."}
{"text":"I realllllly want to rate this place higher. 
However, after visiting several times and waiting to make an informed decision, some things stand out....
My beverage is never hot, but always just barely warm.
Also, it takes a long time to get your drink. If you need to be somewhere in a timely manner, this could be problematic.


Update:
Went back and they messed up my order. This happens every time I'm at this establishment. After giving several chances, I will not be back."}
{"text":"Just stopped Buy this new coffee shop in my area, one word...WOW!  This place has like 10 or 15 coffees  from around the world to choose from. They even have Big Windows so you can see how they roast and teach others to roast coffee. It looked like they were still in the process of finishing up some of the outside construction, but the place looks beautiful none the less. Can't wait to become a regular here!"}
{"text":"Infusion Coffee & Tea caught my attention today while searching google maps for coffee spots nearest me. The location was a bit hard to find parking for, however the coffee is outstanding. The team members were attentive, friendly, and kept the dining area very clean. I will definitely be recommending this location to friends and family looking for a tasty cup of coffee while in the Tempe area."}
{"text":"A little off of the beaten path, but a cool shop nonetheless. It's a large multi use space-- with coffee classes going on, roasting, and the normal coffee shop and bar liveliness. I got the coffee flight, which is very unique! It was an experience."}
{"text":"This caf√© just blew my mind. We were immediately greeted upon walking in by a super sweet barista that knew the menu like the back of her hand. She gave us samples, suggestions, and opinions tailored to what we liked most about coffee. 
And oh my God the coffee. Roasted in-house, there is something new on the menu all the time. I tried there Papua New Guinea cold brew and was blown away. I've never had more fresh coffee and was unbelievably happy with my drink. This place is clean, organized, and employs some seriously awesome people. KEEP DOING WHAT YOU'RE DOING."}
{"text":"First of all we went here to do homework and the wifi didn't work at all, not on our phones nor computers. My boyfriend ordered a white mocha and it was great. I, on the other hand, ordered a freshly squeezed lemonade and it was so tart. I added six packets of sugar and it still was just as tart. I understand that it's fresh but it literally just tasted like lemon juice."}
{"text":"I've only been here for an hour and already love this place! I've been in search of a coffee hangout close to campus for a long time, but a place that isn't overrun with undergrads (Cartel), too loud and fast-paced (Starbucks), limited in their selection (Gold Bar), far too small (Solo Caf√©), or just kinda gross (Xtreme Bean).

Found it! Infusion is quiet, offers a ton of coffee and food options, has great areas to sit and work or chat with friends, and is bright and open.

DOWNSIDES: (1) Potentially space; 7 chairs at a \"bar\" area facing the street, 4 chairs at a table in the center of the space, and a cool wraparound couch with center table that might seat 10. There IS an outdoor patio with umbrellas and much more seating space, right off 8th St. (2) Outlet availability; I only see one available outlet, and it's not too close to a seat (with an extension charger you could make it, but only from one seat)--come here on a full charge if you plan to work!

UPSIDES: Very friendly staff. I was overwhelmed by their coffee selection and coffee-making methods (e.g., Aeropress, Chemed, pour-over, French press, and the list goes on and on). They also have a ton of tea. All coffee, tea, and \"making methods\" (previously listed) are available for sale. They offer coffee from Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, Bolivia, Brazil, Burundi, Ethiopia, El Salvador, and Indonesia.

Their breakfast options include: Parfait, Irish oatmeal, continental, cr√™pes, French toast, hash browns + eggs + bacon/sausage, eggs + artichoke + feta, eggs + brie + apple + bacon/sausage.

Their lunch options include: SALADS (strawberry, bacon, spinach; gorgonzola, pear, spinach; house tabouli; citrus quinoa; caprese) and PANINIS (prosciutto & pear; balsamic glazed chicken; caprese; paddy-o grilled cheese).

They also have daily chef's specials with additional options. I had the parfait (see photos) and it was absolutely delicious. I'm guessing this place is of Irish origin (although you can't tell from the d√©cor)--they have an Irish blessing hanging from the wall and a clock set to Ireland time.

Very, very neat atmosphere, very laid back, great place to work. I'm glad I came!"}
{"text":"Nice place.  Good mocha.  Professional presentation.  Off the beaten path, but not to far off. Try"}
{"text":"Outstanding.  If you ever wanted to see a coffee and tea laboratory -this is it.  

Lights out baristas.  This is to coffee what Amsterdam is to marijuana and hookers.  It's the best place on the earth for it."}
{"text":"This is by far the coolest place I've been to study so far! Not overwhelmingly large or busy and great staff!! I ordered tea and was very impressed with the presentation and the service I received. The barista gave me some options based on my preferences and prepared the tea pretty quickly. I am so impressed by the presentation and preparation of the tea you can really tell that a lot of detail and thought was put into the way tea is served here. I loved the outdoor and open air seating; really accommodating for any temperature preference. There were so many tea options. I stayed pretty much until close and was really impressed that no one was rushing around or trying to push patrons out. My only complaint would be parking and not many food options.  However they let you bring food in annnnd finding parking is a small price to pay for great service and a basically perfect, chill working space. Annnnd they have classes on tea and latte art, etc:  super cool! I can't wait to go back.....did I mention they were affordable?!"}
{"text":"Beautiful coffeehouse ambience, very kind staff, and very clean facilities. Had the Tiger Chai Tea, but it tasted a lot like the artificial Starbucks blend. Will be returning to try their other varieties."}
