{"text":"Inconsistent with portions and freshness.  The young staff have no clue what they are doing I feel the only two knowledgeable people there are the older man and women who seem to only work there during the day.  
I question their health and safety since a careless employee had put raw chicken on the counter (where they build your sandwich) and a raw chicken skewer touched my pita.  I then had to ask for another pita since the girl did not see what her coworker had done.  On another occasion the older man had rung up my order took cash from me and then went to wrap up my sandwiches without washing his hands after handling the money I just gave him.   
Other than that, I find their chicken shawarma to be tasty and flavourful and the samosas are pretty good too."}
{"text":"Walked in to have a gentleman tell us to ring the bell. No bell to be found. He panicky grabs a female associate from the back room asking if she can serve us as he is fixing something. 

The lady comes out and clearly does NOT want to serve us. Very RUDE and talking way too fast and quiet to understand her. After constantly having to ask her to repeat herself before understanding what she was asking us we finally completed our sauces and topping choices. 

After she is done preparing our order of a chicken shawarma pita and gyro beef dinner, she walks over to the grill and starts scooping up old chicken that's clearly been sitting there for a while and puts it in my pita. Then picks up old beef gyro and puts it over top of the rice. 

The food was disgusting and probably was the worst shawarma and gyro dinner I've ever had. Chicken was dry, pita was cold, rice was undercooked, barely any sauce, etc. 

The lady behind the counter was extremely rude and not welcoming at all. $25 spent on a horrible dinner that I'll probably get food poisoning from. 

Absolutely disappointed."}
{"text":"I love this place!! The only thing I absolutely hate is that their falafel is not made fresh to order.. it's precooked then just heated up.. don't be lazy.. make it fresh to order... PLEASE"}
{"text":"Best falafel in town!! I absolutely LOVE bon-a-pita and have been a regular for as long as I can remember. The food is always fresh, the service is wonderful, you definitely get a bang for your buck with the portions they serve, and the quality of the food is incomparable to the other shawarma restaurants in Bolton. Definitely a personal favourite of mine, The owner is very very nice and sure knows what he's doing with his meat!! I'd definitely recommend their falafel pita or one of their shawarma meals, happy munching!!!"}
{"text":"Best shawarma I've had, almost better than Paramount! Also do NOT pass up the fresh baklava!!! Both are amazing!"}
{"text":"It was ok if your in the mood for average shawarma!! It's the best I've found in Bolton so far ! Toppings  are nothing special and feta cost extra ! Hot sauce is only medium hot and the chicken has tough bits in it"}
{"text":"This is my favorite lunch place in the Bolton area. Its got everything I like: good tasting food, fast service, and cheap prices. Also, the place is clean, has lots of tables and a couple TVs. 

In a subway-styled assembly line you pick out what meat you want and choice of pita (white/wheat). There are 3 choices for sauce: hummus, tzatziki, garlic. I like all 3 on mine, but you should at least try the garlic for some added flavor. They pack your pita with a variety of veggies: lettuce, onions, tabouli, pickled things. Finish it off with some hot sauce and they will put your pita in a hot press while they ring you up. 

For $10 you can get a pita, side and drink. The sides are OK, I think the samosas are the best to pick from. And check out all the options in the drink fridge, there's some more rare drinks and alternatives to the common soda. 

WARNING: this place gets packed around lunch time, come before noon to avoid a wait. And ordering the souvlaki takes an additional 5-8 minutes."}
{"text":"Not bad! We had beef gyro, chicken shawarma and Greek salad. It was very good - looks like Bolton finally has a decent gyro shop! Staff was very courteous and the place was clean. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I accidentally passed by this place and thought I should give it a try for lunch. The place was not like your average Shawarma house. It was clean and trendy. 
I opted for the chicken shawarma, no lettuce. Great choice. Excellent taste, way more than I expected. After all, this is Bolton. 
The Staff was great, the place was clean and the food was excellent. Simple!!!"}
{"text":"I work in Bolton and it's a struggle to find a good lunch spot. This Shawarma place is a gem for Bolton, really one of the few places worth going to. That being said, my last few visits, they were stingy with the portions, counting out 2 tomato slices,  exacting out the feta, etc. Take it easy. Charge me an extra 50 cents if you have to, but let's not nit-pick. 

Good spot. Enjoy your meal."}
{"text":"Shawarma did not disappoint! Crispy yet juicy. We had the dinner with veggie rice and potatoes.
Home made garlic sauce is the clear winner - couldn't get enough. 
Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Can't go wrong here.  It doesn't blow me away, but they make a fine shawarma."}
