{"text":"I've never used the spa so this review is strictly for the gym.  I had a membership there through work for a few years but truthfully I would not pay full price for this gym myself.  It's very high priced for what they offer.  On a positive note, the facility is small and non threatening (good for those like me who are not really gym people overall).  All the machines are well kept and you can easily get access to one right away.  They offer a ton of free weights and a schedule of classes.  I'm a HUGE fan of the yoga workshop by Sherry.  She really describes the postures and why they are good for your body.  It's a wonderful class to take for beginners to yoga to really understand the full benefits of the practice.  I can't speak for the other classes but they seem like fun and have people religiously attending them.   Overall a great low key gym located at the Squaw Peak Hilton Resort.  It's just the price and the front desk service I could pass on."}
{"text":"What a great way to start the day!   Took my mother in law to the spa for the head to toe treatment and we both had a great experience.  The milk and honey sugar scrub was delightful."}
{"text":"When I look for a gym I'm really hoping for the following:   -Conveniently located (either by home or work)  -Decent mix of free weights and machines  -Not too crowded  -Reasonably priced   I've found a great match in Tocasierra. My employer has a corporate account with the center, which brings the price down to just under a dollar a day! You can't beat the price.   A decent range of classes are included in membership, from Yoga to Strength training. I haven't tried any classes yet, but I've heard that they're good.   The fitness center isn't big, but it's fairly complete. There are several cardio options, a full set of dumbbells and around ten machines. One other plus, they have an honest to god bench press. Machines just don't cut it. A pool is available as well. It's big enough to do laps in, so that's a plus.   Over the years I've found that one of the most relaxing things I can do is work out on my lunch break. I get my head straight for the rest of the day and I don't have to feel guilty about being lazy in the evening. Thanks to Tocasierra I can do this!   I should also mention that the staff is very friendly and helpful. Good stuff."}
{"text":"I came here on the second day of my Phoenix vacation with several family members for a combination of facials, pedicures, and massages.  I made reservations in advance to make sure that the spa could accommodate everyone at once.  We selected this spa because we were all staying at the Pointe Hilton Squaw Peak, so the location was convenient, and they were offering happy hour pricing that fit our budget.  The spa is located across a parking lot from one of the hotel buildings, and is relatively easy to find.  My husband and I arrived first, were handed big fluffy robes and directed to the men's and women's locker/waiting rooms to change and prepare for our appointments.  The locker rooms were lush, with ginger scented lotion and soap, a cedar sauna, showers, and a relaxing waiting room with iced tea and cucumber water available for refreshment.    I enjoyed a facial by Barbara. She did a wonderful job, analyzing my skin, suggesting and applying treatments most beneficial for my skin type. I was left refreshed, and for the first time ever did not break out after the treatment.  I also had a pedicure, which prepped my feet for a week of desert hiking, pool(ing?), and flipflop shuffling. Even after all that abuse, they still looked great. It has been two weeks, and the polish on my toes hasn't chipped a bit!  My husband enjoyed a massage and pedicure.  He said that he loved both. My other family members seemed to equally love their experiences.    In all, I think this place is awesome. The facility's ambiance is perfect for anyone seeking the zen relaxing spa atmosphere. The people providing the spa services were very professional.  The price, reduced due to the happy hour rates, was just right.  If I ever make my way back here again, I will definitely stop by.  If they are offering a few deals, I will probably treat myself to another spa experience!  Thank you ladies!"}
{"text":"I got the head to toe glow which was a hot stone massage, body scrub, and a reflexology.  I felt so relaxed and clean after my session.  The massage was perfect pressure. After he applied the body scrub you take a shower and rinse everything off.  Then he does the reflexology with a body cream so my skin was so soft and silky afterwards!"}
{"text":"Another hidden gem unearthed, be sure to visit Tocasierra Spa and Fitness for an excellent therapeutic massage. Ask for John, the massage therapist who hails from Adelaide, Australia. John has a quiet, calm, friendly demeanor, instantly feel comfortable, and worked miracles on my tight shoulders, upper back, and neck.   My companions both had facials and raved about how excellent the service was, how much they liked their aesthetician, and how smooth and rejuvenated their skin felt.   The spa is elegantly appointed, the staff friendly, helpful, and efficient, and they carry a full line of salon products in case you left your beauty products at home. The ladies lounge is welcoming and comfortable with cushioned chairs and refreshing fruit and cucumber waters to help hydrate the skin and flush the body of toxins.   I plan to attend a fitness class at the fitness center located in this spa and will update this review with details about the class."}
{"text":"I was in town waiting for a flight (10pm flight) and found this amazing Salon on yelp - Tonya was amazing and the scrub was very relaxing.  Most people are loyal customers and I was lucky enough that they squeezed me in.  The salon is in a nice strip mall on east side of town right next to Walgreens and Starbucks.  I will be back in my next trip to Phoenix."}
{"text":"The fitness part of this place is great: machines are new and plentiful.  Good classes on the schedule, and plenty of cold water and fresh towels.  Now, the spa, on the other hand, is mediocre at best.  The pool is a bit of a walk and available to anyone at the hotel; same with the jacuzzi, which also means the jacuzzi is outside!  Why no jacuzzi inside?  The steam room is small and there is no sauna.  There are only 3 shower stalls, with shampoo and shower gel, but no conditioner. The lounge area is also small and not at all relaxing.  And the robes are super thin (with a chilly room; that's not even nice!) and not very big.  I had to sit very carefully so as to not expose myself to everyone. Hello! haha.  The massage itself was very nice, but the spa is not relaxing, especially for the prices.  I wouldn't return to the spa, although the gym is good."}
{"text":"Great to use if you live in the area , small and quiet has a great pool although is on the run down side missing some tiles and landscaping  is kind of sparse where things have died and not been replaced.  The towels are circa your high school locker room ..used to have nice ones but i was given some weird story about how they got mixed up with the hotels? The gym has lots of treadmills , weight machines as well free weights and is clean .  Great for the moderate workout.  Overall is a nice facility but could use some upgrading as its a hilton hotel and spa."}
{"text":"I'm in Phoenix on business and decided to treat myself to a massage before my flight tomorrow.  John Steiner, Massage Therapist is amazing!!!  I felt comfortable in his proffesiional hands and experiened the best massage ever!  On my next trip to Phoenix I am definitely going back and requesting John."}
{"text":"I booked appointments for my mom and I during Spa Week.  The website and the woman with whom I booked led me to believe we were able to use the resort amenities - the resort pools, lazy river, restaurants, etc.  After being crammed into a tiny locker room to dress, experiencing average massages, we were looking forward to the lazy river.  Unfortunately we were then told that those pools were for resort guests only.  We were then led to your basic below average apartment complex pool.  Very disappointing when we were planning on spending the day, ordering lunch, etc.  I was mortified after having taken my mother to actual lovely resort spas around the valley.  Do not book here if you are looking for any sort of resort experience - I'm glad we only booked for Spa Week prices."}
{"text":"Though I can't speak as to the spa side, this place is almost worthy of being called the perfect gym.   The facilities are clean and the staff is always available and friendly, yet it's kept enough of a secret that it's almost never crowded. It is hidden inside the Pointe Hilton Squak Peak Resort but gym memberships are available to the public at surprisingly reasonable rates.   Members are given access to a heated pool, steam room, sauna, in addition to an entire gamut of classes at the workout facility.   If I still lived in this neighborhood, this would undoubtedly still be my gym of choice."}
{"text":"I have had my fair share of spas and massages done and this place isn't going to be on my top list. You obviously get what you pay for and the nicer the hotel, the nicer the spa is going to be. The spa is in the same area as the gym, which is nothing special. The bathroom/changing area is nice but small. There is a small changing area/locker area, 3 bathrooms, 2 showers and 1 wet room, but they had plenty of towels and sinks so I guess you can't complain. The waiting area was nothing special, small and not very comfortable. The staff here are nice and the massage was alright, hot stones were the most amazing part of the entire thing. Slightly disappointed, could have  been better but it was better than most for sure."}
{"text":"Just finished a couples massage at the resort for Valentine's which was lovely. However I had called ahead to ask if buying a spa service allows us to use the resort grounds. I was told yes absolutely which justified me spending $320 on massages and a nice day for valentines day. However the ladies at the spa said we could only use the spa pools which are beyond subpar. I definitely would have not spent my money here if I had been informed properly. Very disapponted ."}
{"text":"I went here during spa week for the first time ever and had 2 service.   Firstly, this place is kind of hard to find. Its detached from the actual hotel, its in a weird office looking building to the east of the hotel and there is no real signage telling you where to actually go.  When I checked in I let them know it was my first time visiting them. There was very little \"tour\" given. As in, I was shown to my locker and wasn't even told how to function it, had to ask one of the other spa goers. They had a steam room (which is tucked in a weird corner in the locker room), which I didn't even know about until the end of my visit after I was fully dressed and ready to leave, which totally bummed me out, had I known about it I would have taken full advantage of it.   My first service was my massage. It was one of the worst I have ever had. The guy seriously talked THE.WHOLE.ENTIRE.TIME. Oi Vey! aaaaaaaaaaand he seriously worked me over so hard that I was sore for 2 days afterward, I've never had that happen.   HOWEVER, my second service was a facial and it was top notch. I loved that the table had a warming option! The technician was very sweet and did a really great job! Also I loved that at the end she didn't try to push/sell me a ton of products like a lot of spa's do."}
{"text":"I recently visited and booked a Swedish massage with John, who came highly recommended by the receptionist. I have been getting massages for 17+ years and have my fair share of experiences.  Perhaps he was having an off day, but his Swedish massage was definitely a deep tissue. He never once asked me how the pressure was or if I wanted focus on one particular area. In part of the conversation I mentioned how the feet were my favorite part. He literally spent less than 15 seconds on each.  Very disappointed and I left more tense from fighting the pressure of his thumbs rather than relaxed. I was so looking forward to the relaxing strokes of a swedish. The best place about the spa is that they can accommodate minors under the age of 18, which after calling several spas this was about the only place who would."}
{"text":"My sister and I visited Tocasierra Spa while on vacation in Phoenix (we were staying at the Pointe Hilton Squaw Peak, which this spa is a part of).  We scored facial and pedicure appointments with little notice, and were very impressed with the spa facility and the staff.  I still contact this spa (from North Carolina!) to mail-order their sugar butter body scrub and lotion -- it is the BEST!    If you are in Phoenix and need spa services or just a manicure/pedicure, I recommend calling Tocasierra.  At the time we were in Arizona, we read that Tocasierra was rated one of the top ten spas in the state so you may be better off getting an appointment instead of hoping for walk-in luck.  We probably got lucky with our appointments because we were staying at the hotel."}
{"text":"I had a wonderful experience this year's spa week. Amelia was fantastic. I left relaxed and refreshed. If you make it to the Pointe make sure you ask for Amelia"}
{"text":"Great experience during my short stay in Phoenix. Loved the cucumber water offered during your wait, enjoyed a renewing mani-pedi and good talk/company with pro's and co-victims alike. :) I klutzed out and messed up two of my not-quite dry fingernails, and they were kind enough to redo them. All around fun experience."}
{"text":"I recently traveled from the East Coast with my family. We stayed at the Squaw Peak Resort by Hilton where this spa is located. We stayed in two of the 'casitas' and the spa was a quick 2 minute walk for us (though there is parking available). When planning ahead, I decided I wanted to treat my mom to a spa day while the boys golfed. I contacted the spa manager, Lauren, ahead of time to book our massages. She was very friendly and accommodating; which I very much appreciated. She even provided me with her direct line to reach her with any questions I had.   When we arrived, we were promptly greeted with a smile by the spa receptionist. She was adorable and so sweet to us. She 'checked' us in, and asked if we had been to the spa before. We told her we had not. She led us to the women's locker room and showed us around. You enter the locker room and behind a partition there is a lounge with a small bistro table, a coffee table and four chairs. They also had (lightly) sweetened lemon tea as well as chilled cucumber water in there. Beyond that, there was the sink and counter-top area for getting ready (hair, makeup, etc.) To the right there are showers and (ahhh!) the steam room! Straight ahead there are 3 toilets that double as changing rooms, and to the left are the lockers. She showed us how to use the lockers and made sure we were comfortable with this - there's also a sign on the wall for those who forget. She put our robes and slippers in a locker and left us to undress to our \"comfort level.\"   We changed and went to the waiting area, where we were met by our respective masseuses. My mom had a young blonde masseuse (sorry, I didn't get her name), and I had June. My mom doesn't get too many massages and said her masseuse was great - friendly, gentle and thorough. We both got the 50 minute Swedish massage - this was my mom's first 'whole body' massage and she loved it. My masseuse, June, was more tenured which I appreciated. I very regularly get massages - I go 2x a month to a neuromuscular massage therapist (i.e. deep tissue and healing massage). The guy I go to is very knowledgeable about the muscles, the joints, nerves, etc... This means he's very effective. This also means, I'm spoiled and can be hard to please as a customer.  Thankfully, I lucked out with June. She was very thorough and I could tell through her technique she knew what she was doing. She identified the 'knots' in my shoulders and did a great job navigating behind my scapula and around my c1/c2. She used good firm pressure, but checked in with me periodically. She respected my desire - or lack of - to chat during the massage. She was definitely 'tuned in.' I VERY HIGHLY RECOMMEND JUNE!  After our massages, we went to the steam room. A steam room or sauna are my favorite aspects of any spa! We were the first ones to use it that day and learned we needed to turn the timer past 20 minutes a few times before it kicked on. When it did, it worked great. They had ice towels (wet rolled towels with ice on them to keep them cool) outside the steam room (a must have!). I showed my mom my favorite way to steam - on your back with a towel behind your neck rolled, and another over your face. She enjoyed it immensely. I could have stayed for hours!  In the spa, they also have a very large fitness center which you have access to as either a spa guest, or a resort guest. For locals, I understand you can also get a fitness club membership. There was a private small pool (outdoors) through the spa which was adult only. We took a peak but decided to make our way to the water park/main pool area (you must be a resort guest and get a bracelet to use those pools). We spend the rest of the day sunning and enjoying the lazy river. Overall, it was a fantastic spa experience - DEFINITELY RECOMMENDED!

{"text":"So far, the best gym I've ever been to. It's an upscale fitness center + spa belonging to the Hilton!! Cool right? They have very nice lockers, showers, swimming pool and steam rooms. Perfect place to work out and release the everyday tension. Staff is always nice and very professional. They don't bullshit you with tons of promotions like L.A. Fitness or YouFit (I've tried those :/). Plus you get 20% off at Rico's and 10% off massages! I still have to try their massages but I'm sure I won't get disappointed. Go local! Yes, you pay more, but you also get a distinguished crowd."}
