{"text":"Delicious!! I had the hot sausage sandwich, loaded brick fries and cream puff cake. All three were ridiculously good. I will be going back whenever i can. Actually about to go here now. Alice was even cooking!!

Update: Ive been back 6 times since I first went and still can't get enough. It's only been about 2 weeks. Daily specials are always amazing. Her potato salad is some of the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"Love it - small, home style dinner with good food and good service!!  Treasure these places more and more in this day of chains!"}
{"text":"While antiquing, we needed a quick sandwich.  Couldn't locate subway and stumbled across Alice's Restaurant. Awesome sandwiches - service - neat atmosphere. 
I got the Italian sub - fresh ingredients and husband got a Reuben. Excellent gem of a find!"}
{"text":"If you like a small town diner you will love this place.
Seating is limited but the food and portions are large and you walk away very satisfied. You will return."}
{"text":"We were traveling from California and looking for something good to eat the Food was very good here, we were very pleasantly surprised. I had the Ham BBQ with cheese fries, my only complaint was the canned cheese sauce. The the BBQ Ham Sandwich was very good, my husband had the stuffed pepper soup (delicious) and the Scotty Special it was pretty good too. Definitely worth a try if your in the area!!"}
{"text":"Small and homey. Breakfast made to order. Alice delivered breakfast herself. Good to see locals supporting a local business"}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast. It's a small place but very vey good. We eat breakfast here every other week and never have been let down. Try the Big Breakfast and the grilled potatoes."}
{"text":"We went here for breakfast at 8am. I don't know if we would have gotten a seat an hour later right away. I have to agree with other reviewers the hash browns are awesome! Great place to get breakfast."}
{"text":"Definitely the best meal I've had in a long time, and so affordable! Staff are lovely (Joe was our waiter, he was very nice) and the food is excellent. The atmosphere is comfortable and friendly, a real 'Ma and Pop' kind of vibe. I had pancakes and French toast and both were absolutely delicious. I cannot adequately express just how good the food is! I will definitely be coming back as soon as I can!"}
{"text":"Friendliest diner we've ever been to. Delicious food and great service. Thanks for welcoming a couple from Philadelphia on their way through to Michigan."}
{"text":"We have been living in the area for the last year or so and have always lamented about the lack of \"non-chain\" types of places for breakfast.  I lived in NJ for 17 years and I admit, I got spoiled. 
Anyway, I decided to see if YELP could give us some guidance on a local place for brunch.   Slice's came up with 4.5 star rating and almost 40 reviews, many of which were from last few months.  
When we found the place we thought we could park right next to the place where the big pickups were.  That did no work cause I was not going to take a chance jumping the curb in our new Impreza.  We parked in the real parking lot and when we got inside it was pretty small and a little tight just as past reviewers had noted.  
Our waitress was friendly and we could see and hear Alice and Scott doing their thing at the grill. We did not stray from regular bfast fare, eggs,sausage, bacon, home fries (yum) and Italian toast were pretty good.  Coffee was ok.  
I talked with Scott who is a regular guy supporting his wife Alice and their son, all bustin butt chasing the dream.  This is as \"unfranchise/chain\" as you can get.  Yea for them and us. 
Best part was when a diner sneezed and Alice, working the grille, shouts out \"bless you\".  
That was AWSOME. Your not getting that at Cracker B...."}
{"text":"I had the cheese steak omelette.  Sounds a little weird, but that was what drove me to order it.  It was really good and the hash browns as suggested by the waitress over the home fries was spot on.  Small interior space, about 8-10 tables and a very small counter.  Service was pleasant and helpful."}
{"text":"Oh my god. Get the Scotty special. Under 'fair specials' on the menu. :-) Fries are tasty. Get a side of gravy with them. Cute place."}
{"text":"This place feels small and almost run down but the food and service are great, for very good prices.

I had the meat and cheese omelet with bacon with white bread and the hash browns, accompanied by a fine cup of diner coffee, but the conversations I hear coming from the back is my favorite part, at one point the topic of skiing came up, one of the ladies said \"I would love to try skiing someday\" then the other rebuttals \"I'd rather sit and drink by the fire, too cold for me\". 

So, to sum it all up, good food, good coffee, great entertainment!"}
{"text":"The service was great and the locals were very friendly.  
My husband has the Italian scramble and I had a meat and cheese omelet; both were delicious. advised to do the hashbrowns which were fresh shredded potatoes that are deep-fried similar to Shoestring fries."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast. Great portions, very reasonably priced.  Service was very quick, server (Joe, I think) was friendly and very quick. He hustled. 

Food is made to order and fresh. I had the hot sausage omelette with hash browns and toast. Omelette was big and stuffed with ingredients. Hash browns were exactly as ordered, well done and tasted great. 

7 tables and a few seats at the counter make this place cozy, except for the draft when the door opens, but hey that's what 7 degrees will do for you. 

Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I wasn't overly impressed with the pricing and or food. I'd be willing to try it again because there was a power outage so their entire morning was awry. It's a small quaint place."}
{"text":"Ahhhh - food from the old days - when food tasted like food. Not all processed.  

The fries were awesome, the sandwiches were very good and the service was friendly.  

Try it you'll like it!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious diner type food. Had amazing biscuits and gravy. Great home town feel and friendly staff. Just a tip for parents- no high chairs. Definitely recommended!!"}
{"text":"The food and wait staff were fabulous. The interior is small; however, worth the trip and possible wait."}
{"text":"Delicious homemade local food. Fresh ingredients and packed with flavor.  Huge portions and friendly staff. Filled with neighbors sharing great food and good stories."}
{"text":"Food: Simple, freshly made options. I had the BLT, which was good. I would love to try their breakfast though, next time I'm in town.

Service: Down-to-earth, friendly, relaxed.

Price: Affordable

Atmosphere: Small dining area, with an open kitchen nearby. It felt closer to cozy & comfortable instead of cramped & confined.

Nice little diner with a down-home feel. I look forward to trying the breakfast soon."}
{"text":"I have only been here for breakfast but it is very good! A decent menu of different options that results in a filling home cooked meal. Breakfast burrito and pancakes are my fave! The coffee is good, service is fast and friendly. The best place is very small so be prepared to wait if it's a busy day. I would guess there's only like 10 or so tables. Definitely worth going here if you're in Canonsburg. They do take cards."}
{"text":"Cute little local diner. Limited seating but that adds to the charm. Great breakfast. Had the Scotty special omelette and it was yummy! Very nice friendly and fast service. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I love small town places and this is one of my go-to's! The brick of fries is what keeps me coming back but everything is amazing, from breakfast to dessert. Love the friendly home town service too!"}
{"text":"If you love diners with home cooked food, then Alice's is your best bet. It's very small and limited hours, but you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I love this place for breakfast. They're very reasonably priced and diner has that cute little small town feel. Their hashbrowns are the absolute best!
I'm not a big fan of their lunch, it's just average to me. This place is super crowded on weekends and there's not much seating inside, but service is quick and efficient. 
Definitely try this place for breakfast!"}
{"text":"This breakfast was perfectly simple. They make their hash browns completely from scratch. This steak and cheese wrap special put my in a food coma. If you are in the area LOOK NO FURTHER."}
{"text":"Great place! Wonderful service and homemade foods. Stuffed pepper soup and homemade biscuits where ridiculous.  Don't forget about the brick of fries - - have an ambulance on speed dial... But so worth it"}
{"text":"It's so good. Breakfast and lunch is great. Small seating area, but that's what makes it such a great place to go to.  Wait staff and cooks are always friendly. Go to Alice's if you want quality food, don't want to go to a chain restaurant, or simply want a change from the rotation in Southpointe. 

FYI they are cash only."}
{"text":"Summary: An old diner in an old house, with good food. Go for the experience and food.

The Goods:
- Solid diner food. Don't expect to rave about it, but it's tasty.
- A bit of 20th century working class history.

The Bads:
- Us southerners find the northeasterners' attitudes dismissive. But I'm over it.
- A greasy spoon d√©cor, but that's part of the charm.

The Uglies:
- Set up for a small clientele, so if you show up with 6 to 8 (as we do), there's a shock factor that slows the service and kitchen. 

Bottom line: Don't go for the food alone. Don't go for the atmosphere alone. But go for both."}
{"text":"I love this place! The owners and wait staff are amazing, not to mention the food. I've been going there at least once a week for two years. Alice and her crew are like family to me. I've met some great people while enjoying my food and sweet tea. I wholeheartedly recommend this place to anyone who likes a great environment and awesome food for reasonable prices"}
{"text":"We will definitely come here again! Prepare yourself for a close intimate dining experience with excellent biscuits and gravy, wonderful has browns, relatively quick service and reasonable prices. We had a wonderful stop."}
{"text":"Perhaps the breakfast is why people have given this place such high reviews, but today we showed up at 11:30 and we were told breakfast stops at 11. Which is fine, since this is a diner and should have some good burgers and sandwiches, but we were wrong. I had the Scotty, which was okay but way too much sauce that made the bread mushy, my son's hot dog buns were semi cold, the same for my daughters cheeseburger. The fries though plentiful weren't anything to write home about...Yelp yes, but not home. :)

Food took quite a while to come out, server was friendly and seemed to know many people that were in the cramped areas. I had to move to another table because the person behind me wouldn't be able to get out unless my son and I got up during our meals and let them out. 

I go out of my way to eat and mom and pop places, but this time we were all let down."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my breakfast here.  The eggs were done to perfection and the hash browns were to die for.  Perfect!   Best breakfast in a long time.  Will definitely be back.  This place is a hidden gem."}
{"text":"I was not sure what to expect with this place. When I walked it is was tight and not a lot of room to get around, it was very busy not sure if this is normal for around 1130. I came here to try the breakfast but sadly breakfast stops at 11. I ended up just having a hot dog with cheese fries and I was impressed with the quality of meat and the bun was toasted perfectly. The fries where great and seemed fresh cut and the cheese was a perfect amount I even had a little left over to dip my hot dog in!  I will definitely be back to try the breakfast!"}
{"text":"This place is the physical embodiment of the expression \"hot mess\". We made the mistake of sitting at the counter where you can see the chaos, uncleanliness (I'm sure this would be a D rating if there were labels) disarray and overall lack of competence at making something as simple as a omelette or egg over easy. I was served a broken over easy egg and i saw many people served omelettes that were overdone and consisted of a disc of egg with veggies/meat stuck in the middle - not cooked with the eggs. To top it all, we waited at least 25 minutes for our order to come out since they were giving many take out orders priority over customers actually sitting in the restaurant. Ive eaten at many diner counters and never been as disgusted as i was at this place. The glass of water they gave me even had what looked like a film of grease on top."}
{"text":"This is an excellent diner in Canonsburg! We went here on a Sunday afternoon and has a delicious breakfast!

When you walk in you're in a small, unfancy dinning room where you can also see the kitchen. The decor is a bit dated but honestly their food is so good that it hardly matters.  There is not a bunch of seating, so I imagine that there's a bit of a wait earlier on in the day.

We ordered standard breakfast foods (omelet, scrambled eggs, pancakes and hash browns). Admittedly the pancakes are just ok, but the hash browns are homemade and some of the best I've ever had. We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot.  It is a small old place with friendly staff and newspaper ready to read if you are interested. My eggs were cooked perfectly, pancakes were large, thick and tasty.  The bacon and sausage were good.  Had the home fries which are like string potatoes that are put in a frier and watched the cook shred a potato to make the fries."}
{"text":"Alice's is a quaint little place. It's clean and the servers are friendly and quick to take your order and answer questions. There are only 7 tables and 4 seats at the counter but it does not feel cramped or crowded. 
The food was great!  Very large portions and cooked perfectly. 

Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"When you hear the American ideal of a quality diner, it always involves delicious and relatively cheap food with great service; that's exactly what you will find at Alice's.  I cannot recommend their breakfast food highly enough.  The Kitchen Sink Scramble was especially memorable, and featured well cooked vegetables and meat.  I also recommend the big breakfast, as their pancakes were delicious.  Also consider the cheeseburger, which a cute old couple seated next to us ordered to share.  Go with confidence!"}
{"text":"We have gone here a few times for breakfast. It's  small and cozy and clean. Always good service and a good meal - hash browns are awesome! Loved the French toast too. Go early, I think they stop serving breakfast at 11am."}
{"text":"I love this place! 
Such a cute little diner, not alot of seating. Cozy and friendly.
I ordered a breakfast sandwich on a bagel with hash browns. The hash browns are very unique...they remind me of the potato stix you buy at a convenience store....so cool and delicious!! 
VERY affordable prices."}
{"text":"Out in the area and found this place on Yelp. We stopped on our lunch break, very good choice. Friendly people and good food. Fresh cut curly fries and the Scotty sandwich was awesome."}
{"text":"I know it's strange given a diner a four star review but I happen to love breakfast and they had an awesome breakfast. We were headed to IHOP for pancakes and my 13-year-old kept telling me that chain restaurants are just no good so on a whim I found Alice's diner on yelp and thought let's give it a try. It was so good.

The pancakes were exceptional big and fluffy just like you'd want them. Really all we had besides pancakes were eggs, sausage, some bacon, toast and home fries but it came out so fast and so warm. The one thing that I love is when I ask for lemon in my water the waitress actually brought me out several pieces of nice big, juicy lemon that alone in my book will get your four stars.

My only complaint is I love home fries done in a skillet and these ones were deep fried they were still really good but not as healthy as maybe a panfried version would be. Also real butter is a necessity for any breakfast."}
{"text":"Very small Diner with above average breakfast. 

Good quality and flavor sausage and eggs, hash browns are similar to shoestring potatoes and very good if a little bit on the greasy side. All and all nothing great but nothing bad either. 

The very small size could make it difficult to get a table or seat if you arrive during prime breakfast time. 

Would gladly eat here again."}
{"text":"Place was great. great food great staff. Loved watching Alice work her magic on the grill!!  Ya gotta go. Next time gonna try the gravy over the fried potatoes!!!"}
