{"text":"We were very disappointed with the quality of our meals and with the level of customer service we received. We went on Valentine's Day and arrived an hour and a half before they closed. We were only the 2nd table in the entire restaurant so there was no excuse for the food being the way it was. I had the orange chicken and my date had the Mongolian beef. My chicken barely had any sauce and what little sauce it had was bland and tasted more like thick soy sauce than orange. My date took two bites of his Mongolian beef and we immediately flagged down our server - his beef was as tough as shoe leather and had the same sauce as my chicken but was completely saturated. There were also hardly any vegetables at all. We immediately told the server that there were issues with the beef and we wouldn't be finishing it because of how unacceptable the beef, the sauce and vegetables were. The meal itself was terrible and the orange chicken wasn't any better. We boxed up the rest of the chicken and shortly thereafter she brought the bill - which still had the beef on it. We left a decent tip - 18% - and went to the counter to pay our bill. We again expressed our discontent for the beef and asked the manager if they could do anything about it. She stated the beef and the sauce for the chicken must have just been different than what we were used to and charged us full price. I couldn't believe it. There is no reason for that and they weren't busy. Very disappointed and it wasn't worth the money. Sadly, we will not be going back again as the last few times we've gone, the service has gotten worse and worse as has the food quality. So much for customer loyalty - we were 15 year customers.... :("}
{"text":"Great variety of items all made with quality, whole (local when then can) ingredients. Really big portions, so you will have leftovers. It is a little pricier, but that's probably due to the sourcing of the ingredients -- they don't skimp on veggies or meat, and it's clearly all non-processed/frozen. I only got carry out, so I can't vouch for the service inside, but my order was ready when they said it would be and they were so kind and answered all my questions upon picking up my order. I will be ordering take out again."}
{"text":"This place has some of the better Chinese food I've found in the area.  They are not an \"authentic\" Chinese restaurant such as Wonton Gourmet, but they make many of their own sauces and their vegetables are fresh. I have been getting the chicken and green beans lately and it is very good.  The hot and sour soup could have more bite, and the fried rice is a little bland, but the egg rolls are great and so are the fried entrees, like sweet and sour chicken. Unlike the other poster, I actually prefer my sauces on the side so my food doesn't drown in them."}
{"text":"I have been eating here most of my life and its essentially sets the bar for classic american-chinese food. It's mostly what you would expect, and a hair more expensive than some places but the quality is on the high, as are the portions. I still think they are the best egg rolls I've ever had. I'd fear I was being sentimental but after having been to NY, LA, Chicago and who knows how many other places, this still stands above for that quintessential chinese-american meal."}
{"text":"Great food...a little pricey for Chinese food but not over the top. I think it might just be because of the area...close to Hudson. But none the less, the food is always great. WAAAAYYYY better thank Pad Thai, in my opinion."}
{"text":"Just got takeout here for the first time ... I've lived around the corner for 10 years, and I was always a faithful Pad Thai eater. After a recent stint of bad experiences at Pad Thai, I decided to change it up. I got some won ton soup and pot stickers. Fairly basic food for takeout. I thought it was good with fair prices. I will definitely go back again to try something different (for takeout though, not eating in)."}
{"text":"Gave my wife food poisoning. Took her three days to get over it. After the event I went and visited their kitchen had an inside look at the condition of their workspace.   Do not eat here, they may clean it up temporarily, but people that cut corners always resort back to their bad habits.   Can you really afford food poisoning? That's the question you need to ask yourself before visiting Tong Tong"}
{"text":"I work right around the corner and honestly I am always pleased with the quality and taste of the food. I get a variety of items, and I don't think I've had a bad meal. My favorite is either the Sweet and Sour Pork, or Pork Sub Gum. Though the Orange Chicken is great too. Seriously...not a bad place at all.  I always get take out and there's never a time where I had to wait. My lunch hour is at 11:30 so I am usually calling right when they open to place a quick pick up order.  Getting in and out of this place is a breeze."}
{"text":"This place has been around forever. It's a classic Asian food restaurant with old stand-bys. I always get the Singapore Mai Fun with curry and an egg roll. They are friendly and it's a good place for a quick, hot, and tasty meal."}
{"text":"Great chicken fried rice - I usually opt for take out. Staff is very kind and makes extra effort for diners with mobility issues."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for Tong Tong based on a recommendation from a coworker.  People were nice, food was made fast, prices seemed a little high.  Got take out.  Got home, unwrapped my package and was impressed how everything was packaged.  I even got a tea bag!  Then I started to assemble everything.  Egg rolls looked authentic.  Got to the shrimp and sour sauce.  BUMMER.  Just pineapple?  Sigh, I'm used to having veggies with it.  Outside the disappointment of not getting peppers and such with the sweet and sour, the food tasted OK.  Still in search of my sweet and sour shrimp with veggies, not just pineapple."}
{"text":"A staple in Stow. I've been eating here as long as I can remember and the food has always been good. The portion sizes are great for dinner and leftovers."}
{"text":"YAY, I finally found my Chinese food in Ohio! I previously lived in Philadelphia where the selection for Chinese food was quite abundant, and once we found our favorite place we stuck to it for the next 8 years and didn't eat anywhere else. When I got to Ohio, I found that I was having difficulties finding any Chinese places, let alone any places that made good food. Then I noticed that we'd been somehow blind to the fact that Tong Tong was right down the road from our usual grocery store and it was all over from there.  We went into the little building in the strip mall and picked up take out menus to pour over. The prices seemed a bit high, so we decided if we were going to be overspending anyway, we may as well just sit down and dine in. Service was very quick and efficient. Our drinks were refilled every time before we could even think of finishing them.   We both got a veggie egg roll, which was light and crispy and tasted faintly of ginger. Then our entrees came. My boyfriend stupidly ordered something he didn't always like no matter where he got it (Mongolian beef), and he ended up having to order a separate plate of steamed white rice since it only came with fried rice, but that came in about 30 seconds when he ordered it. I got my usual chicken fried rice with extra bean sprouts, and it was perfect.... I hate to admit it, but it was possibly better than my Philadelphia favorite. (Sorry, Golden Chopstick) The rice was perfectly flavorful, the egg and scallions were cut small and scattered wonderfully throughout, the chicken was actually recognizable as chicken and in big chunks throughout, and when I asked for extra bean sprouts, I got them in droves. SO tasty, I'm stuffed. I also got a side of steamed \"pea pods\" which is a little cup of snow peas which were perfectly steamed, still crispy and bright green, and definitely enough for me to justify paying for $2 for them.  Tong Tong is my new Chinese food staple. Thanks, Stow!"}
{"text":"Just moved to Stow from California.  I did not expect to top my favorite Chinese place.  Boom!!  The egg rolls are not to be missed.  We are Vegan, and the veggies with tofu is great.  Super huge portion.  Seasoned perfectly.  Very fast service, and so nice!  We will be regular customers!"}
{"text":"My lovely wife and I took take away from here a few weeks ago.  We've heard all sorts of compliments about how wonderful it was and what great Chinese it was, and it was reaffirmed by Yelp reviews.  Sadly we were disappointed.  They packed all of our entrees with sauces separately. Now I don't mind this when I request it, but seriously, should their bags read \"some assembly required?\". Basically we received fried chicken, and we're given the various sauces to assemble our own.  My wife, sweet n sour, myself sesame chicken.  Their sesame sauce that I received was nothing short of awful.  I'd be better making my own. Which was essentially what they wanted me to do."}
{"text":"This place is great for lunch on a budget. They always get my order made really fast, and the food is great! The Ma Po Tofu and Egg Drop soup is awesome. I'm Not vegetarian but love veggies, and the vegetarian and diet options here are vast, definitely will be going back!"}
{"text":"We like this restaurant but, over the past year, we have noticed the flavor of the food has changed!  It has become, very bland and sometimes , not fresh ! Must mean Chef's not watching quality of food being served !"}
{"text":"We so want to like this place as we started going here when Tai Wah moved to Streetsboro. They have all the dishes one wants in a cheap Chinese take-out, it's close to home and it's quick. But after more than a half dozen visits we continue to be disappointed. The food just tastes \"off\", or not very flavorful. So sad."}
{"text":"The best Chinese restaurant in Stow, though Main Moon and King Dragon aren't too bad if you're in a pinch (Tong Tong is little more expensive). Great for takeout or dining in. The egg rolls are outstanding! And the Singapore noodles are comparable to PF Chang's."}
{"text":"More like 2.5 stars. Several pieces of shrimp had not been cleaned/deveined, which is lazy and gross. But what makes me update my review is one of the managers talked on her cellphone in the dining room during my entire meal, apparently trying to find a new health care plan for her family. Customers don't need to hear personal phone calls for an hour."}
{"text":"I have been eating Chinese food for years, never had Chinese food that tasted so bad! was greasy over cooked and was just off. spent like $20 and was very disappointed.  called the restaurant to try and get refund and they told me it wasn't there problem.  well it is now!  They are just taking advantage of there customers. They got your money no need to make you happy now.  This is not a American business and this is not the way Americans should be treated.  I will never be eating there again. I advise you do not eat there either."}
{"text":"Bland. We ordered crab rangoons (my favorite American \"Chinese\" food staple!) and they were barely crisp, certainly not properly poofed from hot enough oil. My pork with peanuts was mostly other vegetables with small pieces of pork. They do not offer brown rice. The sauce was congealed and tasteless and - though we were hungry from shopping - neither my husband or I were able to eat much of our entrees. The waitress was attentive and quick."}
{"text":"My father David started Tong-Tong over 30 years ago with the desire to bring great-tasting Chinese food to the people of Stow and Hudson. We were the first Chinese restaurant in the area and still remain in the same location from the day we first opened our doors. Dad sadly passed away in 1992, but my mom Wendy has worked very hard to make sure nothing has changed from the quality of our egg rolls to the generous portions of our freshly prepared meals. I personally want to thank all our customers, especially our longtime friends that travel far and wide to come back, for being our guests in my 2nd home. I know I wouldn't be where I am today without this restaurant and I really appreciate all your support and your patronage."}
{"text":"Decided to try Tong Tong takeout while we visited Headtrip Brewing a couple doors down. I ordered the General Tso combo (or \"General Tao\" as it is listed on the menu) with egg roll and fried rice, while my wife ordered the Four Season Green Beans with white rice.  The girl asked if I would like the sauce on the side, which I thought was strange for General Tso and told her they could just put the sauce on the chicken. Should have taken the hint, as we ate from the containers and mine was literally swimming in sauce.  There were 2 pieces of broccoli and the rest was chicken and sauce, no other veggies. The sauce was not spicy at all and the chicken was drowning in it so I eventually started setting the pieces of chicken into my fried rice to let it absorb some of the excess before eating. The egg roll and fried rice were good enough but I was not happy with the entree.  My wife seemed to like the green beans but didn't care for the white rice, said it was too dry.  If that were the end of the story, I would give them 2 stars but both of us had severely upset stomachs afterward even though we ate completely different items. First and last time for us at Tong Tong."}
{"text":"We have been to Tong Tong in the past and were happy.  But recently they have really gone downhill.  Like someone else said, they basically give you fried chicken and whatever sauce you ordered.  One thing of white rice with two meals.  No egg roles or anything extra.  Was just mediocre."}
{"text":"Fairly typical faster food Chinese set in a fairly typical strip mall. I've been here a couple times and I would give this place three stars if it weren't for the service of our waitress Ellie. She alone gets the fourth star.   The food is good and the prices match, but if you go ask for Ellie and you'll be happy you did!"}
{"text":"Every time I eat Tong Tong I feel like a warrior.  The War Su Chicken is phenomenal there and unlike anywhere else.  I could eat that stuff until my face falls off."}
{"text":"The first time I came here the service was amazing. Food was good too. In the last few visits i wonder if the food is fresh or simply reheated. Sometimes the food is really tough to eat. The family that owns it seems to always be working there and boy are they nice. Makes every visit worth it. Though I love to see a restaurant employee the community the amount of young and i mean young, I wonder if these people are even 16, they have working here worries me. At that age, this is not the job they want for the rest of their life. How devoted to the job are they? Otherwise its well worth it. Its just fine. Decor is interesting. A bit old and out dated but its ok."}
{"text":"Have been eating here for many years. Excellent Egg Foo Young and  Great Moo Shu Vegetables. You cannot go wrong here. Great place to sit and talk. The Owner is very friendly, and checks on you to make sure your meal meets the grade.Perfect tea. Dinner for 2, huge potions, lots of leftovers, under  21.00. Suggest no MSG, or food can be salty."}
{"text":"Both my boyfriend and I have upset stomachs after eating at Tong Tongs. The food came out cold bland and just hard to eat. Tong Tongs is a good place to take an enemy"}
{"text":"We went to Tong-Tong with a 2-year-old who was past her meal time. They could not have been more accommodating, bringing out steamed vegetables before we ordered our entrees.  The entrees were excellent, generous portions and reasonable prices. Would definitely go back."}
