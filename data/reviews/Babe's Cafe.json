{"text":"Randomly stumbled here and glad i gave it a shot. Funny i felt a eggs benny last weekend so heres my chance for a fix. It did not disappoint and left me wanting more.

I had the eggs benny smoked salmon.  

Nice light and fluffy.  Good job on the eggs.
I would prefer a bit more hollandaise.

I would also have like an option to get double portion because it was so good.

Will be back..."}

{"text":"Very nice location, has a nice casual sit down dinning area and they also do take-out. I bought the meat balls with rice combo which was very tasty. 
They have a small menu but a nice reasonable priced selection of food, also they have a good selection of western breakfast which I might try very soon."}
