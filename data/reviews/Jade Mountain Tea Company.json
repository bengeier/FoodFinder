{"text":"I've been here a couple times. Their bubble tea is very tasty, and the patio was a nice place to sit out and enjoy the sun. It would be nice if they stuck a couple more tables out there though."}
{"text":"Favorite place in the entire world. :D   The tapioca is served warm at the bottom of your drink. Soft and chewy and seemingly dipped in heaven. Best boba I have ever had. Fantastic tea too. My go to: Black milk tea smoothie with tapioca. DELISH.   Staff is super nice. Love this place. Wish they would open up a shop or move over closer to campus. Their current space is nice and cozy though. :)"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  Best bubble tea in town--they actually brew the tea and their pearls are the best kind.  Way better than the carts on Library Mall or the Steepery, which seem to tend toward a powder mixture for their teas.  I also had the veggie potstickers, which were very tasty.  And for the fact that they use nice brewed teas and nice pearls, the prices are awesome.  Woohoo!!!"}
{"text":"Jade Mountain is by far the best bubble tea in Madison. It's cozy cafe, friendly staff, and of course, amazing bubble tea , always gets me.   I've tried a number of things here, but my favorites are the coconut milk tea with bubbles and taro milk tea with bubbles too ($3.48 for a small, & $3.67 for a large). The milk tea is balanced perfectly with sweetness and an authentic tea flavor. The bubbles have a great texture and are even flavorful just eating them plain. The coconut is creamy and has the taste of real coconut. The taro is more of a nutty and unique flavor. Although ordering the tea might take a little longer (10-15 minutes), it's worth the wait!   Nonetheless, Jade Mountain empresses me continuously. Hope you enjoy this bubble tea shop as much as I do."}
{"text":"I love bubble teas!! Especially Jade Mountain bubble teas!!! If you are looking for some great bubble teas in Madison, look no further. The owner originated from Taiwan, the birth place of bubble tea itself. Just this alone more than justify the authenticity of their teas. They know what they are doing, serving up both the traditional taiwan red, green and black teas, as well as some fruit flavors to spice up the variety.   They do their bubbles amazingly well, I would say the best I have had in Madison, and comparable to the Chinatown bubble tea in Chicago and California. Their bubbles have a certain chewiness to them, not too hard and not too soft, just right! With a little tinge of sweetness to them. My favorite drinks are the matcha green tea unsweetened, I like that unsweetened, and with the added pearls in the drink, the sweetness is just right. They are also very good at customizing sugar levels, and so I could order another of my favorite drink, taro milk tea, at the half sugar level.   There is also a decent menu of ramen, dumplings and baos if you are looking for a meal or a snack. But above all I love and recommend their bubble teas ~~"}
{"text":"Great iced mocha! Ordered large I think it was 24oz for $4.11 including tax. Nice atmosphere also and very friendly staff. They had Asian menu pot stickers, ramen, etc. And Mr. Delivery for to go orders."}
{"text":"I cannot possibly say enough nice things about this place.  Their bubble tea is delicious - real tea, lightly sweetened tapioca pearls; sweet and refreshing and never cloying.  I particularly recommend the red milk bubble tea.  I've tried bubble tea other places since Jade Mountain opened, but nothing else compares.  Their chicken and pork pot stickers are perfect snack food, and the pork ramen is excellent - better than Umami's at half the price.  They have a tendency to run out of the various food items on the menu, but there's usually an equally good alternative available.  Throw in friendly staff, casual atmosphere, good prices, wifi, and a rewards program, and Jade Mountain is well worth my commute from the west side."}
{"text":"Coconut bubble tea is on point and so were the dumplings.  It's got a cool, chill atmosphere.  I like that I felt welcome even though I had never been there before."}
{"text":"Best boba I had in Madison so far and I'm from Taiwan and only recently moved from LA. So not to brag but I know my boba tea. In need of a boba fix and Jade mountain def did it! Got the oolong milk tea with boba. The tea is nice and creamy, not those water down green tea water I had from the sleepy whatever place on state street. The boba is perfectly cooked.  Boba is suppose to be chewy all the way through, if you under cook it, the outside will be soft but the inside is still hard. That ruins the experience of boba and you might as well just shoot the boba out the straws like bbguns.   The atmosphere is intimate. With about 7 or so tables inside. Seems like you can pull them together if you have a bigger group. They also have outdoor seating area. To complete the decor there's copies of manga on the shelf. Although it seems like most of them are in Chinese.  They also serve food - ramen, buns, pot stickers and stuff. I haven't tried it yet but will def be back for it soon.  The owner is Taiwanese and he definitely does not let our heritage down. The boba is on par with what you would get in Taiwa6n and even better than some places in LA I would say. He is also super nice in general. So if you want the real boba tea in Madison, go to Jade Mountain!"}
{"text":"Jade Mountain has delicious bubble tea! I recommend the fruit teas (ordered cold). The veggie ramen is lovely as well-- quite a big portion for $5.50."}
{"text":"Bubble tea is outstanding.  I've got the black bubble tea both times; not too sweet and very delicious.  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to come here since I heard there was another bubble tea option in Madison outside of a certain chain, and I'm so glad I finally made it. The boba here is incredible- definitely the best I've had in Madison and better than most I've had in Boston's Chinatown. It's cooked perfectly and the texture stays perfectly chewy when it's in a smoothie. I got the taro smoothie with boba/bubbles and the other people I was with got the coconut smoothie with bubbles and the lychee tea smoothie (yes, you can turn any flavored tea into a smoothie!) with bubbles. We were all blown away by how delicious they were. Granted they were very sweet but I think that's because we got them in smoothie form. 100% will do again- I just wish they were open later than 8 but I suppose that's a blessing in disguise because I would be here way too often otherwise"}
{"text":"Best bubble tea in Madison by a significant margin.  Only place that serves real milk, and will substitute almond or soy at no extra cost!  Yeah!!!  Unfortunately, service is often quite slow, although usually very friendly.  If you are not in a rush, place is great.  That is when they have bubbles.  Late in the day, and esp on weekends, they regularly run out of bubbles.  I've had many a wasted trip, and thus the drop from 5 star to 4.  Still, Jade Mnt is the best bubble tea for certain in Madison.  If you like bubble tea, this is the place to go!  (and try their great bao!)"}
{"text":"I'm a very picky eater but my friends made me come here for lunch and I ended up loving it. I got the BBQ pork bao and it was amazing. I've come three times since and every time the service is great and all the employees are super friendly."}
{"text":"Jade Mountain has excellent-quality coffee and FANTASTIC bubble teas. The staff is very friendly and easy on the eyes, which I really appreciate when I wake up crabby. The prices are more than fair. If they would stock a more diverse array of pastries and possibly some sandwiches I would rate them as perfect!"}
{"text":"Delicious. If Justin is around, he'll recommend a weird combination for your drink, and they are always good.   Recommendation #1:  Taiwan Latte with coconut syrup. Tastes like an awesome coconut dessert. Yum.   Recommendation #2:  Half Taiwan Latte and half black tea. I love you. I can never go to sleep before 3 a.m. whenever I drink this, but it is so worth it."}
{"text":"Best bubble tea in Madison. There may be fewer flavors than you'd expect, but they're all tasty. The bao are also a nice snack. Some of the sandwiches are more typical American breakfast food. The coffee isn't the best in town, but if you need the full dose of caffeine, this place doubles as a coffee shop."}
{"text":"Best tea/milktea in Madison by far...nothing else compares. Wifi is also really fast and reliable so a good place to study."}
{"text":"Best bubble tea I have outside of Taiwan!  Excellent flavor of the tea which you can tell the owner put a lot of efforts to make it right!  I had Lychee fruit tea with bubble.  So delicious!!!!  All ingredients are fresh.  So happy I found this cafe/tea shop!"}
{"text":"I think this is a great place and great for the neighborhood, but they have no caffiene free teas available, which is disappointing because it means I won't be back until there is caffiene free tea available as my fiance doesn't do caffiene.  I love that they have outdoor seating!"}
{"text":"Great food, drinks and environment! Love the bubble tea and potstickers."}
{"text":"Really good bubble/boba tea! Red is my favorite. They also have stella's bakery scones and spicy cheese bread. Can't wait until winter to try hot bubble tea."}
{"text":"By far the best bubble tea!  The teas are all imported from Taiwan and are exceptional.   They make their own boba/bubbles and they are so incredibly delicious!!!!  The owner Chen, and Kevin and Simon his amazing staff, are so wonderful and spread so much joy; you will never leave without a smile on your face!"}
{"text":"The smoothie I got was great! It was loaded with tapioca. However, it was the ramen that I stopped in for and I was very disappointed to find that they were out. Maybe another time."}
{"text":"Great iced green tea and very relaxed environment. I am not a fan of bubble tea but they have a ton of varieties of fruit and milk teas as well as just straight-up tea. The patio is nice, too."}
{"text":"This place is great! The prices are super reasonable and the tea is just how I like it-- not too sweet, with great tea flavor. I wish I lived in Madison so I could get bubble tea here all the time!   It's a great place to hang out for a bit; you can get your drink in a glass if you want to drink it while you're there. The owners are really friendly!"}
{"text":"Best bubble tea I've had!  Also delicious ramen and snacks.  Great prices, friendly staff, and nice atmosphere.  Easily one of my favorite places to hang out."}
{"text":"The place was pleasant and lovely decor, a nice place to study with free wifi. I order the taro milk tea with boba it was alright, not the best I had. it didn't have the richness and the taro flavor was not strong. it was sweeter than I'm used too. But the boba was cooked perfectly, chewy. my friend order a strawberry tea. My friend did not like it, it was too sweet and strange. Lol"}
{"text":"I love this place. Everything about it. The bubble teas are the best in town--in fact--the best I've had. Everything is so fresh and brewed perfectly. But the service is really what makes this place special. These are the nicest people you will have the pleasure of encountering anywhere in Madison. I am a proud regular and bring all my friends here for their first--but definitely not last--visit. A Madison treasure. Make sure to try the Roselle Flower and the magical Taiwan Red bubble teas."}
{"text":"Great experience. Cute local run shop. Tea and coffee drinks were both very good. The Bun was also very good, and they have Potstickers and Ramen also."}
{"text":"The best bubble tea in town. I live in Chicago, used to go to school in UW-madison. Couldn't find a bubble tea as good as this one. I always ordered the green milk tea. FYI, I'm highlighting on the tapioca pearls. They have awesome tapioca pearls, sweet and chewy. However, if you prefer just the tea, they are fine as well but I like this place because they have good pearls."}
{"text":"Best bubble tea in Madison currently. The bubbles are sweetened so they don't taste just like tapioca powder. They have excellent teas, green is my favorite. They serve warm milk tea, too. It was unusual for me at first, but I keep coning back for more of the warm ones on colder days."}
{"text":"My sister introduced me to this little gem yesterday, it's a small little Taiwanese tea House on Madison's eclectic east side. The shop itself is small and cozy, and  there is also an outdoor dining area that would be perfect for warm  summer days.   I ordered the coconut bubble tea, she had taro bubble tea and we shared an order of potstickers. The teas we're very light in flavor and had little tapioca balls in them, dubbed \"bubbles\". I wasn't crazy about the bubbles, but the flavor itself was delicious. The potstickers were made to order and had me salivating before I even tasted them.   If you're looking for a little spot to escape from the world for a bit this is a nice choice."}
{"text":"Really good lattes.  Most places have bitter tasting coffee/espresso or overly sweet by covering it up w/ the syrup.  This place has found the sweet spot(no pun!) and has good beans to match.  They keep a nice frothy head on it, and its juuuuuuuuust the right tempature to not scold your taste buds off immediately like most places.  I havent branched out to try any of the teas or the food, but I'd imagine they were just as good.  They keep expanding their offerings too which is a major plus!"}
{"text":"This rating should be closer to 3.5 stars but since the beverage prices aren't shy, i don't feel so bad.  Let's start with the good - my wife's salted something, something coffee was outstanding.  We also ordered the basil chicken which was tasty and a good snack size.  They  were out of the brick toast on the Sat morning that we visited (boooo) and my matcha bubble tea was simply lacking flavor.  We might try it again if they have toast available."}
{"text":"I don't get to Madison very often, so I was super excited to stop by. Jade Mountain did not disappoint. I got the the black tea smoothie with boba. So. Good. The boba is fresh and chewy with the perfect amount of sweetness.   The interior/ambiance is also an ideal place to just hangout and get some work done. Will stop by again."}
{"text":"This is the best bubble tea we can find in town. I would rather drive a little bit further than getting any bubble tea around the campus, I would say it is better than Steepery(it is good too). Their service is awesome too. I just enjoy its taro and macha smoothies that ease my throat because they have the right amount of sweetness (not too sweet) and good flavor tastes."}
{"text":"One of, if not thee best place for authentic Taiwanese style Teas, Bubble drinks, and even some small snacks.  All made without all the super sweetness that is rotting out our American diets.  Keep on rocking the wonderful teas and food.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"Jade Mountain seems to have gotten its game together! Their products are much more consistent and the service is a lot faster! I love this place. Best bubble tea in the area!"}
{"text":"It was okay. They had lychee jelly on their menu but they didn't have any in stock. Cute cafe atmosphere. Maybe next time ill try something else."}
{"text":"Their milk teas are perfect. Very subtle flavors with just the right amount of sweet and milkiness to tea ratio. I think they blend their teas rather than shake, but it comes out tasting smooth, refreshing, and cool.   I also appreciate they keep their indoor temperature at normal levels. Who wants to be ice-blasted by the air-con? I can actually wear a t-shirt inside, rather than have to bring a sweater with me on a hot summer day. Or, I can sit outside on their cute furniture with my cool drink.   They're a bit of a ways from campus, but whenever I'm in the area I try to stop by and support this unique find in Wisconsin."}
{"text":"I live right next to Jade Mountain Cafe and I have a feeling I will be going there a lot! First off their prices are extremely low, everything is under 5$. I ordered the Oolong Tea Latte and it is absolutely superb! Great customer service from an amiable and sweet guy named Chin. Great selection. Calm atmosphere. Their to go cups are even compostable material. I've been waiting for something great like this to fill that little spot in the neighborhood. Oh and I can't forget, their bakery is from Stella's so you can buy little hot cheese breads. What more could one want? I highly recommend supporting this business, its worth keeping in the neighborhood!!!"}
{"text":"Jade mountain is definitely the place to go if you are reminiscing about Taiwanese bubble tea.   They serve the most authentic (in Madison) bubble tea with a variety of flavors and styles. Also featuring a special type of tea: Taiwan Red, it's quite a good alternative if you are looking for something more subtle and less caffeinated than the regular black tea.  Other than bubble tea, they also serve potstickers and ramen (not Japanese style, just FYI) with fish tofu! One new thing that is a must try: their butter mix thick cut toast. Thick cut toast is a very common snack they have in TW, usually served with various kinds of spreadings. Great snack to go with your bubble tea!  They also have a number of chairs+tables with outlets nearby. Plenty of people take an advantage of doing their work there."}
{"text":"Finally got a chance to try the veggie ramen today and I was not disappointed. Good broth, great veggies, and a decent portion size.   The only issue was that it took about 30 minutes to come out. But it's a small place with probably only one cook. If you're going there for food just plan for a little extra time."}
{"text":"I ordered a black milk tea for under 3 bucks which it's totally reasonable price. It tasted pretty good...you can tell it's made fresh with real tea - none of that powder crap. It's not as rich/caffeinated as HK style milk tea (what I'm used to in the bay area) but I would definitely come back here to satisfy my milk tea craving.   Very comfortable/clean seating area and the cashier/owner is very polite (handed my change back with both of his hands!) Too bad it's so far away."}
{"text":"Ordered veggie ramen and pork bun. Taro milk bubble tea.    Food was aiiight.   But goddamn, they must have the microwave turnt to 11 bc I burnt the shit out of my lips on both items. I do like hot food but goddamn! I ain't no fatass or nothin that can't wait for the food to cool down, but ramen is best hot nah mean?  Taro milk was good but that extra sugar will give me the diabetes."}
{"text":"Came here after a fellow yelper recommended it and boy am I happy she did! Look no further for the best boba in town!!!   This place is probably the most authentic tea shop in madison and the tea lives up to it as well! I arrived with my friend a little after 10am and didn't heed the warning that the boba isn't ready til around 11am or so because they make it fresh every day. Seriously.... guys.... you MUST wait for this boba. If you are having some serious cravings this will satisfy them! I decided to wait the extra 25 minutes to get it and I am so glad I did!!  The texture was soft and it was warm when they brought the drink out to me cuz as I said they make it fresh! I had it with the matcha green tea which was good. Again probably one of the best in Madison, not too sweet but I always like more matcha flavor.   I also tried the BBQ pork bao which took longer than I expected it to, but overall was okay. It was a nice snack but nothing exceptional.   I'm giving this place 5 stars cuz definitely in Madison it is the best boba and the environment/decor is awesome. I'll def be back   Happy boba eating!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best bubble tea place in Madison, in Wisconsin, or even in the entire Midwest.   As a native from bubble tea's home country Taiwan, I generally have a pretty high standard on any flavored tea drinks. Jade Mountain, the name of the highest peak in Taiwan, is a dream come true for many Asian international students at UW-Madison. This place could compete with any tea shops/stands you find everywhere in Taiwan.   In term of the bubble tea, the sweetness and chewiness of the bubbles (or pearl or boba, whatever you want to call it) is perfect, and if you taste it carefully, you could tell that Jade Mountain adds legit TEA in the drink, not some crappy tea omnipresent in other tea places.   As many reviews have mentioned, their coffee, ramen, and sandwiches are just standard. Stick to the tea menu in your first visits, because it is what Jade Mountain is known for."}
{"text":"Stopped for the bubble tea based on the Yelp reviews, did not disappoint!! We had the Matcha bubble tea and Mocha Smoothy, which was surprisingly rich and will certainly get us back in again!"}
{"text":"I feel really conflicted writing a poor review of Jade Mountain because I know many people (my friends included) have had amazing experiences here. My experience today was extremely lacking, however; I'm not sure if the people working were just having an \"off\" day or if something has shifted in their quality.   My friend and I came in at 10 a.m. for boba tea-- an hour after opening-- and we were told there wasn't any tapioca available yet. We brushed this off and chose different items. She ordered a hot red tea, I ordered an iced black milk tea. The person at the register was an older gentleman and he seemed a bit confused with the point of sale system. We were extremely patient with him, thought \"maybe the iPad is new or he's just behind, whatever, nbd.\" I paid with a credit card and my friend paid in cash; he handed me a stack of random bills (which, if counted correctly, should've been my friend's) and asked my friend to sign my credit card slip. We sorted it out, but he seemed off his game and flustered with the whole situation. Then, he got both of our orders wrong-- he brought hot black teas to our table instead of 1 hot red tea and 1 iced black tea. I told him I had received the wrong drink and he came back a minute later with an iced black tea that looked and tasted like he had just poured the first hot tea over ice. The tea was definitely over-steeped and neither my friend nor I could palate it. I had a phone call to take and didn't want to ask the older gentleman to remake my drink a second time, so I waited a bit to bring the drink back up. This wouldn't have been a big ordeal anywhere else.   I had only taken a sip of the iced tea before realising it was undrinkable, but the second person at the counter (a younger guy) didn't seem to believe the tea was over-steeped. After a lot of back and forth, I asked for a different drink and told him I would pay for the new one. He didn't charge me, but implied their tea was going to be too strong for me regardless of what I ordered and grudgingly made me a new drink. The second drink was definitely better, and the veggie potstickers I got were nice too, but the worker's attitude just turned me off completely. The customer definitely isn't always right, but if they're being polite and there is something fundamentally wrong with the drink (and they didn't drink half of it before returning it), it's usually better for everyone involved to believe them and be courteous. I really hope I will have a better experience if I visit Jade Mountain again."}
{"text":"I currently live just a short walk away from Jade Mountain, and only occasionally stop in. It's okay.  The drinks are okay, but nothing that I go running back for. The coconut milk tea is decent. The coffee is good. If you like bubble tea, then Jade Mountain will probably leave you satisfied.  The food is mediocre. I've ordered the ramen, buns and pot stickers and they are all edible. Nothing mind-blowing, and of similar quality that you'd find at the grocery store.  The interior is kind of junky and could use some serious love. They recently got these weird new table/counter things that are pretty nice, but slightly awkward. The bathroom isn't the nicest. Everything inside the shop looks like an arts & crafts project.   The patio is nice.  Service is slow, as others have stated, but the staff is friendly. There have been a few occasions when they were supposed to be open but weren't, which was annoying.  Overall, it'll do, but leaves much room for improvement."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is so nice and the drinks here are amazing! Haven't tried the food yet but it sounds good. The prices are not too expensive, either. The quality of the bubbles are on point. Would really recommend the matcha milk tea with bubbles!!"}
{"text":"Definitely a hidden gem on the near East Side.  My new quest is for boba tea drinks here in town and Jade Mountain is my new fave spot.   They have a nice selection of teas and fruit flavors. All can be made hot or cold and with the tapioca balls which always seem freshly made. Yum.  We've had the taro, matcha, coconut, and mango teas, all with tapioca balls. The tea and fruits definitely tasted great and freshly brewed.   They also have some bakery and a small food menu, potstickers and ramen included.  For a tea/coffee spot, their ramen and potstickers were pretty darn good (and modestly priced, too). I have been to a number of other ramen spots in town.  Too trendy for my tastes. Jade Mountain's is as good but with a more casual, welcoming and neighborhood vibe.  No pretense. Just is what it is.  Love it.   The guys in the shop are way cool and welcoming. Not aloof hipsters. Thoughtful and good-natured is how they seem to me and how they help their customers have a refreshing break from their day.   They have nice casual seating with outlets and power strips for the electronical.  Outdoor seating, too and plenty of curb parking on their side of a shade-lined street.   So go there. Be mellow. Sip. Breathe. Enjoy.  See you there."}
{"text":"Yes!  So good.  The non-coffee drinker's Starbucks.  Tried the taro milk tea (cold) with bubbles.  I was dead-set on getting a medium, but large was less than $.20 more. After tasting it, I was glad I got the large.  Can't wait to try more; coconut will be next.  Food sounds good too."}
{"text":"I love the customizable teas, my kumquat tea was delicious. The service was very friendly and it was a wonderful atmosphere to spend some time in. It's also open later than most tea places which is nice as well. I will be coming back and recommending it to others!"}
{"text":"I can't stress enough how great this place is.  I've been coming here regularly since I discovered it last winter and will continue to do so.   The first thing I noticed about this place was their great customer service.  The workers are always friendly - especially the owners - and you can tell that they try to get to know a lot of their regular customers.  They're also very helpful in answering any questions about the teas and can give recommendations.    Thumbs up on the milk tea, mountain tea (a really unique and great taste), coffee and the fruit teas.  The little desserts are a nice touch and the one I've tried was good.  Their steamed buns are good as well.  The only thing I wouldn't recommend is the pork ramen.  My friend and I both tried it and neither of us liked how fatty the pork was.  The ramen is okay but I probably wouldn't order it again for the price.  But overall I find their prices to be very reasonable."}
{"text":"Their patio was definitely the star of the show - for some reason this corner of the street has some killer feng shui. The interior is okay, needs a little more work to enhance the coziness.  The espresso was too bitter, so don't come here exclusively for the coffee. They also have bubble tea, which I didn't try yet. Also have some kind of dumplings (can't remember)."}
{"text":"I was excited to have a ramen + bubble tea place near my house. Sadly, it didn't live up to my expectations. The bubble tea is pretty good - I really like the texture of their tapioca pearls. I was a little weirded out by the fact that their straws weren't wrapped and a dude just brought the straw out to me in his hand.  I ordered veggie ramen, but they were out of vegetables. He suggested the pot stickers instead, so I got those. I saw him preparing them and realized they were store bought, frozen pot stickers. They came with a really salty thick brown sauce I didn't care for.  I think I'll be sticking to the Steepery on State, but still looking for a good bowl of veggie ramen in Madison."}
{"text":"All the girls and boys wanna see my FOUNTAIN From Lisa in HR to Larry in ACCOUNTIN' My sex is like an ATM just enter the AMOUNT IN And like a Gore election you'll be left RECOUNTIN' This 21st Century Fox'll put his PARAMOUNT IN Make you wanna ride all night and never be DISMOUNTIN' Even if you charge for sex, I'm the one you'll be DISCOUNTIN' And then we'll go for Bubble Tea at JADE MOUNTAIN  WHAT  I'm a little Jaded when it comes to Bubble Tea. Get it. Jaded. I've had so many of the best ones in North America, so how could this compare?  Well, you know what, I judge it by Wisconsin standards - and even Chicago standards are not sky high compared to Texas, New York, and of course Cali. And by Wisconsin standards, you won't find a more authentic, homemade, and enjoyable Bubble Tea shop than this. In fact, you won't even come close.  Yes, Jade Mountain was easily the best place that I got Bubble Tea in Wisconsin. By a distance. They don't really make their drinks sweet, so you have to rely on the squidgy gooey tapioca to give your teeth some sweetness. Tea I mean. But that too. Silly voice dictation. And it really does because they are soaked very well in sugar or honey. It's a good job, even if they could be a bit more chewy in a bit less sludgy.   The teas themselves are absolutely excellent. Brewed to perfection. They make Mountain tea as a Milk bubble tea, which is really high in caffeine, and then the Oolong and the regular milk tea are both excellent. I can't decide which one I like better, but I think I'd like to try them with honey next time I come. A little sweeter than usual. I'm not Asian after all. So I have the North American sugar addiction, a bit. A lot a bit. And I'm also not Asian very well. I mean ageing very well. OK that's a lie.  And there will definitely be a next time because I also have yet to try the fruit teas. So until then I'll teas you about them... and teas you in general, especially if you're on my Snapchat. Or should I say Crapchat. I mean, it's a pretty crap app. I wonder if there will ever be an app called Crapapp. But I digress.  Also the teas are a generous portion for a normal price with a very heavy dose of tapioca. As opposed to the heavy dose of British Sausage that is also available. Not here though. PM me, I'll tell you where.  Not to mention the tea shop is really cute and a lovely place to hang out (much like my bedroom), and the owner girl is such a sweetheart to talk to (much like I talk sweetly to my British sausage). It was a pleasure discussing bubble tea and Taiwan with her - and the products here, my visit here, and our chat, were among the top highlights of my trip to Madison.   Whenever I am in Wisconsin - in Madison specifically - I am going to come back here for bubble tea.  And whenever I am in Madison, she starts trying to wife me, and I'm like, this is why I don't hang out with Madison anymore."}
{"text":"I had their chicken bun (they were out of pork) and a taro milk tea with pearl tapioca. The milk tea was very good, and served on site, the medium sized cup was fairly generous in size. I liked the flavor of the bun a lot, and it came in a bamboo steamer - a nice touch.  The interior is fairly nice, with matching black but varying in height sets of tables and chairs and a few cushioned seats and lower tables.   Service was rather friendly. It seems like business is pretty good.  They have other appetizers and desserts that I didn't get to try, but I'll be coming back.  The location is rather tucked away on E. Johnson (and North Street) and I like that - parking is easy - though it also appears that a lot of the business comes from residents in the neighborhood who get their orders to go.   Madison - your boba tea has finally made its authentic debut at Jade Mountain!"}
{"text":"Delicious! I love their bubble tea! Their smoothies are the best! There coffee is strong just like I like it! They have food, potstickers are great!!! I had pork and vegetable and both did not disappoint. There spring rolls or egg rolls are good too, they seem a lot healthier than restaurants I've tried before. Best of all it's reasonable priced. I love this place! The customer service is impeccable!"}
{"text":"This place is way better than the steepery. Not too sugary (they have the right sugar percentage options), AUTHENTIC Taiwanese red tea (really takes me back to summers in Taipei!), and the pearls are great! Sadly, it's a bit out if the way of my usual haunts, and the place is a little small. But this is 100% my new pearl tea place in Madison! I'm sure it would be beautiful to sit outside during the summer."}
{"text":"Only been here once, so I'm only going by what I had. They didnt have taro at the time, so I ended up getting a mango milk tea. Pretty good, generous on the tapioca balls. Disappointed there was no taro, but hoping they'll have it when I come back again. Service was average."}
{"text":"The taro milk boba is good. You can't choose the sugar percentage here so you're at the mercy of the staff in terms of sweetness, however, mine was mixed quite well. At first I was told they were out of boba, as they make it in house and it takes one hour to complete the whole process (and they didn't predict being so busy that day) - but after guilt tripping the host about hearing this place was the best in Madison, he checked in the back and came back with a smile stating they think there is just enough left for me to try. His customer service skills were on point.   I also ordered the chicken gyoza and definitely think it's appropriate to just stick to the drinks when at Jade Mountain.   I can't get the red bean boba from Cali out of my mind, I'll have to try a couple more drinks from Jade before I can consider myself a fan."}
{"text":"I just moved around the block from this place!  It is going to dangerous the amount of tea and delicious that will be consumed."}
{"text":"Going to leave this short and salty.  Got the Taro Milk Teas. It had no flavor. More just a cream flavor. Also got the Veggie Ramen. Just by looking at my picture. It looked unappetizing and salty. Ohh and it was. Needed a glass of water to cleanse the mouth. Looked/tasted like the ramen I used to get in the store in the containers just dumped in a blow and just added in some veggies.  The staff was nice, so may give them another chance with the tea."}
{"text":"My friend took me here to get boba and told me it was the best bubble tea in Madison and probably even Wisconsin. It's way better than Kung Fu Tea or Sencha for sure! Too bad it's a drive to get to from campus.   I got the black milk tea with boba (because I'm really basic and also just couldn't decide). It was great! Not too sweet and the boba was cooked perfectly. I also like it that they sweeten their boba with honey. A few other boba shops I've been to do this and I really think it adds something different and makes the drink a little bit more interesting flavor wise instead of just syrupy and sweet. They have a lot of drink options (milk teas, fruit teas, slushies, etc) and other options for toppings as well including lychee jelly if that's more your style.  Lots of outlets around and free wifi so it seems like it would be a good place to catch up on some work! I'd definitely come again!"}
{"text":"I went to the Steepery on State St and this place the day after. I have to say the tea at Jade Mountain is waaay better. Mango tea with the regular tapioca balls is the best."}
{"text":"I ordered a Milk Tea Latte (no bubbles). I did not realize there was food until I saw the board to my right. This was after I paid and two other patrons came to the counter. Sadly, I did not have enough time to wait in line to order food.  Now, I took this time to use their public restroom.  (Back story, I went to Crostini and I wanted a bathroom. Crostini referred me to Jade Mountain and I took the opportunity to get a delicious beverage as well.)  I have never in my life been in such a dirty place. My visit was just a week ago, so I was wearing flip flops. I stepped into a flooded bathroom which smelled of things I can not begin to talk about. The bathroom was unfit for use. I have been in cleaner rest areas in the middle of Texas. Awful. I was actually coughing and choking. I am not a person who can handle smells.  Needless to say, after this experience I was looking forward to a delicious beverage and running out of the cafe as fast as possible    The Latte was ok. Nothing bad, nothing good. However, I must admit I wondered what their kitchen looked like after walking into that bathroom."}
{"text":"I came in and had the taro smoothie with boba. This is by far the BEST taro flavored smoothie I have ever had in my entire life hands down. And I lived in the bay area in California, where there are a lot of boba places to choose from. I swear nothing tops this places taro smoothies. On top of that, I'm not a boba person but I opted to have some added to my drink so I could try their boba. Once again, I was mind blown by the perfect consistency and quality of the boba in my drink. This place is a new favorite. Well worth the 5 stars and I'm looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"My usual is the mountain tea with honey boba. What makes this place stand out from other boba shop in Madison is it's delicious, chewy and sweet honey boba. The variety of drinks is not as many as Kungfu Tea but the quality is excellent. The shop also serves food which is a great choice for brunch or snack. But remember, it's a Tea shop, so don't expect the food to be amazing"}
{"text":"The world's saddest ramen lives here. The broth had slightly more flavor than water, the egg was hard boiled, the noodles no bite, the chicken dry and stringy. Super disappointing that I just left all but my seven bites on the table. The pork and lotus potstickers weren't much better--limp wonton and flavors that were just passable. The sauce was way too strong and overpowered everything unless you did the teeniest partial dip.   The great part: the boba tea is exceptional. The boba bubbles are some of the best I've had with lots of flavor and bite in a sweet sauce, just like they should be. The milk tea is flavorful and I would come back just to order this again, thus the three stars.   Side note: not that I would have ended up eating it, but they do not offer to go containers for their ramen."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to try Jade Mountain yesterday, after seeing that they had vegan ramen listed on their website. Let me just tell you, this place is AWESOME!   We each ordered vegan ramen (veggie ramen, no egg = vegan, we asked) and bubble tea, and we shared a plate of veggie potstickers (also confirmed vegan.) The ramen is made with rice noodles and I will say, it is not traditional ramen (this is a Taiwanese cafe, after all) but it is DELICIOUS noodle soup with tofu, bok choy, and fried onions and garlic in the broth. In addition, they make all of their teas loose leaf, so if you would like to order milk tea, any of their teas can be made vegan by ordering it with soy or almond milk! I had taiwan red milk tea with almond milk and bubbles, and I loved it. The bubbles were better (and more fresh tasting) than any others that I've had. The potstickers were great, too, although we were personally not fans of the sauce (we dipped in our soup broth instead!)   In addition, our server was super nice and helpful in checking the ingredients in what we ordered. It is a cafe setting - cute furnishings and a lot of outlets (I didn't check on wifi but I'd guess they have it.) We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed coming here for some time now! I haven't had a drink here I didn't like. I usually go for the fruit teas with tapioca.  Today I got the matcha milk tea with tapioca, less ice. Not too sweet and just the right amount of matcha so that it's not powdery either.  My coworker who was a bubbletea virgin tried it and was very pleased!"}
{"text":"I searched all over Yelp for the best place to finally try this infamous bubble tea my friends have been raving about. I wanted to try and find the best bubble tea in Madison. Did I find it? I'm not sure. The bubbles were certainly delicious. The tea? Not so much. I didn't really like the flavor I ended up getting. I had some of my boyfriend's honey dew and that was pretty good, but he didn't get milk in his so it wasn't really the same. For the price, I won't be buying bubble tea again at a cafe. I might try it again at home, but this review isn't for bubble tea itself, right? So back to the store. I didn't really like the atmosphere of the place, so I'll probably never come to sit. The service was... weird. When I ordered everything seemed fine, but when I got my drink it didn't have milk in it. Since I had never really had bubble tea I thought maybe I just didn't have the right idea of what I was getting. After a quick Google search I realized it was in fact not what I ordered. When I approached the employee who made my drink he said he messed up and just auto-piloted making it without milk because the Chinese find adding milk like that to be \"unnatural\". Er, ok. Well, whatever. I don't think I'll be back, but I'll keep it in mind next time I really want some honeydew tea."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my visit to this place! Free parking on the street and all around the area. It's a little out of the way if you're not in town but well worth the trip. Tried passion fruit green tea with jelly and classic black tea with bubbles. The passion fruit green tea was delightfully refreshing! Love how the black milk tea itself is not too sweet, and the boba was soaked perfectly in sugar.   Was very disappointed that they weren't serving food the day we came by. Would love to try it out. Great study spot to go to or to meet up and chat with friends. Free wifi is available! What a gem."}
{"text":"How does one pretend to be quaffing a brewsky when you are actually totalling tea? You come to Jade Mountain and get a large Oolong Tea in a glass mug. Check out Sarrut O's pic here. The freshly brewed Oolong looks like a beer with foamy head and all. And it's just delicious. I came to the cafe which while it does serve coffede,is primarily a tea room with light Asian fare. I watched as the potstickers and ramen went by to another table. I was here with a group who was just here for beverages and conversation. Jade Mountain is a good place for both. Located in an east Madison neighborhood, there are number of small local businesses nearby (so you could get a massage, too.) The tea choices are very extensive and the service is friendly and attentive. I am sure to be back."}
{"text":"Holy smokes! This is a hidden gem that needs to be closer to the Capitol/campus! I love the variety they have on their menu. Boba is perfectly chewy and the drinks are fresh. Things I have ordered: Matcha Smoothie with Boba and Milk Tea. So good. If it was closer, I would come every day.  They take cards and they also serve food. I need to try the food next."}
{"text":"I love their bubble teas! My favorite is the Oolong milk tea, iced with bubbles. It's not to sweet. The Bao they offer is great too, with 10 options available. I really like the pickled veggie, an option that I never get in my small town. I love stopping here when I get to madison!"}
{"text":"I was less than impressed by my tea experience at Jade Mountain.  I looked for a place to stop in Madison while on a business trip and found this place.  I had planned to do some work in the tea shop but it was very warm in the space and didn't seem like a place I could get anything done.  The tapioca pearls were fantastic and clearly fresh so that was good.  I got a mango fruit tea and it was just too sweet and there was no ice in it so it got warm fast with the warm tapioca pearls.  The tea was much better when I was able to add ice into it.  The kid who helped me didn't seem to excited to be there or particularly helpful for a first-timer like me and I was a little disappointed to get a regular lid instead of the fun shrink wrapped cup to stab the straw into like I find at most bubble tea shops.  This was good but not great."}
{"text":"Best bubble tea in town - I order the Taro Bubble Tea and it is wonderful every time! The bubbles are ready after 11am, and you can tell they are made in house! The dumplings and noodle bowls are reasonably priced and delicious, as well! Be prepared to wait at least 10 mins for anything you order, but it is well worth the wait. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"BEST BOBA IN MADISON!  Jade Mountain is easily the closest thing to a traditional bubble tea.  Bubble tea was created in Taiwan so it's only fitting that the owner is Taiwanese and the teas they use are hand picked from Taiwan!  I would suggest anything but if you're a first timer try the Black Tea smoothie with boba!  It's a bit of a distance from the UW campus but worth it with its choices and prices!   I will say that you should call ahead of time to see if they have boba readily available because they get crazy busy and will sometimes run out during the day!  Simply call ahead and check, all the employees are super nice!   Definitely a Madison favorite"}
{"text":"Nice latte but very, very loud group of people inside... I don't think I will stop by here next time."}
{"text":"After Macha on East Johnson, this is one of my favorite places in town to go for Real Tea (be it of the loose leaf or bubble variety.) JMT is a Taiwanese tea house, through and through.  The staff is super-friendly and helpful, and the atmosphere is nice and casual -- there are always at least a few customers about, but I'd generally call it \"steady\" but never \"slammed\" during the times that I've visited over the years. Lots of outlets, and nice ambience to sit and read or work for a bit while I enjoy a drink or two.  In addition to the teas, they also offer some tasty foodstuffs as well -- ramen (GLUTEN-FREE and VEGAN OPTIONS!), bao, and pot stickers, as well as a selection of baked goods; all quite reasonably-priced (I think most of the menu is $5 or less!)  The only drawback to JMT is their location -- a couple of miles away from downtown, they're nestled in an odd little spot just off the corner of a busy intersection. All the parking is 15minutes only, so you might have to walk a bit to get there (or just grab your drink to go!)"}
{"text":"This is real Taiwanese bubble tea. The Taiwan Red and taro were both delicious, the bubbles are perfectly cooked, and my request for half sugar was honored. If I lived in Madison I'd be a regular. Being close to the airport, it will just have to be the first stop I make next time I fly in."}
{"text":"I want to like this place, but I can't. When 2 out of my 3 visits are not good, then I'm not coming back for a fourth.   The first time I came in was a half hour after they opened on a Saturday. We wanted the bubble tea that everyone raves about, but as soon as we got to the counter we were told that the bubbles wouldn't be ready for another half hour so we left. We came back an hour later and got what we wanted. My green tea tasted like perfume but my fiance' s taro was good enough to make me want to come back.   That leads us to today. We drove over tonight to get some tea and came to a sign outside reading \"Not Open\" even though the door was open and the shop was full of people. My fiance walked up to the guy closest to the door and said \"they're closed tonight?\" To which the guy responded \"yeah, they're celebrating the Penguins winning the Stanley cup.\" This was a dig at my fiance wearing a Boston Bruins t-shirt. I know that isn't the shops fault, but it's turned me off from going there ever again.   I don't blame them for having an event that prevents me from going on a Saturday night. But being insulted in the doorway by another customer for asking a simple clarifying question just because of the clothes were wearing is not something I take lightly."}
{"text":"Without a doubt, the BEST bubble milk tea in Madison! Being an avid milk tea connoisseur from Houston, the first thing I looked for when I came here was bubble tea. Surprisingly, I didn't find this place until a few weeks into my move!  It's kind of difficult to find the place, as it's on the corner of a street intersection. They have 15 minute street parking that is usually empty right in front of them, so I like to park there conveniently and grab a bubble tea to go after work.   The place itself is fairly quaint, and usually has a few people working on their laptops/reading/studying. Their menu is expansive and covers much more than just bubble tea, if you are in the mood for something else. They also have food including baos (which are kind of like...asian sliders? I'm not really sure how else to describe it), ramen, and dumplings. Personally, I didn't try them, but other reviewers seem to say that they're pretty good, and they're fairly cheap.  I really recommend this place if you're looking for the best bubble tea in Madison, or just want to try it for the first time!"}
{"text":"If you like bubble tea, you need to come to Jade Mountain for the real deal. It's the best in Madison. You can order fruit, milk, smoothie or straight tea; decide the type of tea, they have it categorized by caffeine level. And yes, these are brewed so know what level of caffeine you can intake. My fav is Oolong [ya heard right, they bring in some Oolong tea to make your bubble tea--dang!]. Then add the bubbles: the traditional tapioca (always made properly), passion fruit jelly or lychee jelly. Small, medium or large. Just go big. It's so affordable, why not?!"}
{"text":"Their menu is pretty typical for a tea house: black/red/green (milk) teas, fruit teas, et cetera et cetera. I do appreciate that they have S, M, L options for their drink sizes instead of the usual one-size-fits-all.   I ordered a medium green milk tea, and I'm not sure if the tapioca pearls were included or if they were an add-on, but either way my drink cost me less than $3.75. The tapioca pearls are not as \"Q\" as I would have liked (could have probably been boiled for a few more minutes), and their milk tea is clearly made from powder....but I'll take what I can get.   I wish there was more indoor seating available - either that, or they need to control the sprawl of customer belongings so that they can clear up more seats for other patrons. Fortunately, the weather was nice, so I was able to take my drink outdoors to their patio.   Overall, Jade Mountain did not disappoint, but I shall continue my search for the best pearl milk tea that Madison has to offer."}
{"text":"Me and a friend went to Jade Mountain for soup/appetizers/tea/coffee yesterday.  I had the veggie soup and red tea with milk (hot).  My friend had the pork dumplings, egg rolls and mocha coffee.  The soup was simple yet delicious.  A poached egg was added to the soup that included tofu, noodles, leeks and a clear broth.  Lovely touch.  The soy paste that came with the dumplings was thick but very salty, and the chili sauce complemented the egg rolls well.  The Staff was friendly and the service was good.  Any complaints?  Not really.  The only real complaint, if you want to call it that, was the limited menu and tea selection.  However, this business is small.  They are not able to accommodate many patrons who would prefer to stay and read the paper while sipping on a fruit tea.  The location is not exactly ideal either.  Only street parking available.  And easy to miss if you are not looking for it.  Suggestions?  Only perhaps to offer teapots with loose leaf tea steeping for friends to enjoy together a la Ma Cha on Monroe St.  I am absolutely recommending to go to Jade Mountain if you are/living in the area.  Otherwise I would recommend Ma Cha on Monroe St or hitting your local fav coffee shop.    Obviously based on other reviews, I need to try the bubble tea.  Oh!  And a shout out to the guy I spoke with...didn't get his name.  Hopefully you will be there when I go back so we can speak further about your native Taiwan."}
{"text":"Black Milk tea with boba is legit. The boba is fresh - nice and chewy. My husband got the taro milk tea, which wasn't so great. I don't know what it was... Just seemed watered down?.. had a hint of taro but not really. It also seemed powdery. Definitely have had better taro milk tea at other places. However, this place was chill and far enough from the busy areas if all you want is boba.   I'd come back to try the other teas."}
{"text":"Nice space, friendly staff. Every San Pellegrino flavor in the case, including prickly pear and orange. They have bubble tea if you're into that. That said... the coffee is from an automated machine like you'd find in a cafeteria, and the potstickers are frozen (they told me they get them at Asian Midway). So... I paid about 3 bucks for dispenser coffee and 6 bucks for 6 or 7 potstickers that I can buy a whole bag of at Asian Midway for like 4 bucks."}
{"text":"The only and the best bubble tea in Madison! Heard that their coffee is also pretty good, but I just stick with the bubble tea every visit :p"}
{"text":"Bye Steepery!   Being an Asian in the United States, it is a pain to order a bubble milk tea and realize your bubbles are of the wrong texture. Jade Mountain's bubbles are the best I've ever had in the States, even better than the ones in LA or New York. Their bubbles are AMAZING. Soft coating and chewy core, sweet and taste perfect when mixed together with their fairly light tea. I've had the Oolong tea twice and Honey Milk Tea (they don't have it on the menu so I asked for a honey substitute in a normal Bubble Milk Tea). Both tasted great and had me talking about it for hours. Never tried the food items. Never tried the coffee or fruit-based items. I pretty much only go to Jade Mountain for authentic Taiwanese milk tea and I suggest you do the same.    Service is slowwww so I took away one star. Expect to wait at least 10 minutes for your order, especially if you're not the only/first customer in line. Still, I would definitely recommend the place if you are looking for some authentic Taiwanese Bubble Milk Tea!"}
{"text":"The bubble tea (boba) at Jade Mountain is the absolute best in Madison and quite possibly the best I've ever had!   The texture of the bubbles is perfection and provide enjoyable mouthfeel, which is not always the case with boba. The masterminds at Jade Mountain are experts at boba preparation.   The milk teas we tried were so refreshing and full of flavor - matcha green tea and black tea.   I now have a new go-to place for boba in Madison. Happy day!!"}
{"text":"I like the coffee a lot, and there are some yummy selections of pastry from Stella's bakery.  It's a great addition to the little corner strip of Johnson and North Street.  I usually walk here, but there may be a bit of a problem with parking close to the cafe during peak times (and this definitely will continue if/when something moves into the currently empty corner store front on Johnson/North).  Jade Mountain has also added panini and pot stickers to their lunch menu.  It's a nice little place, and I hope to continue going there a lot in the future.  Also, I believe they are able to take credit cards, but they do prefer that you pay with cash."}
{"text":"The bubble tea here is outstanding. If you don't know what bubble tea is, you are missing out. First of all, although it's tea it is a cold drink. They start with either a fruit juice (made from actual fruit) or sweetened tea mixed with milk, then add large black, chewy, sweet tapioca pearls at the bottom. You drink it through a giant straw that lets you suck up the pearls.   We have had some of the fruit versions, and mango, blueberry, and grape are our favorites. For more traditional tea flavors, I love the oolong and the guy loves the red.  We have not ever had anything here besides coffee and bubble tea, so I cannot speak to the quality of the food.   Although it's a bit of a drive for us, we make the trek at least once a month. If you haven't ever tried it, you are missing out on something wonderful."}
{"text":"A hot summer day and a nice, cool, fresh pearl drink. It doesn't get better than this! It can be tough to find real bubble tea that ISN'T made from that nasty powdered stuff; I have a hard time even amongst the plethora of places in the Bay Area. Jade Mountain's bubble tea is top notch quality, made from actual tea, with love and fluffy, fluffy frothiness on the top. Yum!"}
{"text":"oh I remember the first time I came to find this gem. Having heard so much about their Bubble tea and at the time Madison didn't have any bubble tea place (back when Steepery was not there), I took a number 9 bus and thanked God that I didn't miss it!  Opening the door, I could feel a nice vibe and good atmosphere and the owner greeted me. Before coming, I learned about their products on website but when I was in front of the counter, I still had no idea what to order. The owner was being extremely helpful and nice. He understood right away that I was new to his place. So, he suggested some tea to be combined with Taro (yeah, I am a big fan of TARO). And of course,  I didn't forget to add some bubbles.  Since then, I came here with hubs and my girlfriends. One or two time we came to read and write, other time was only  to chat the whole day or evening long with my girlfriends. They didn't mind having us camp there. That's so nice of them.  After coming for several times, I got to try their pot stickers and eggroll. They're good and I like them. Too bad, I didn't dare to try their ramen, as I was warned by a friend that the ramen didn't live up to our standard. But other than that, I love their bubble tea. Their level of sweetness is just right. I can't take something which is too sweet.   And now (starting from a few months ago), they have the star punch sent directly to our email. That's nice.  To be honest, this place is better than the other one. The only thing that keeps me coming everyday is the location. But, a little effort is worth doing to have a huge portion of Taro bubble tea. And hubby is always happy to drive me here, on weekends or after work."}
{"text":"Came to Madison and I was craving boba, what's new? After seeing so many reviews of this being the best boba in town, I had to give this place a try.  Overall, I was impressed! They're a very authentic tea shop that offers several different fresh loose leaf tea options. The boba itself was soft and chewy.  The only complaint I had was - I ordered the milk green tea at regular sugar and it came out very, very mildly sweet, almost couldn't taste the sweetness at all (to help with comparison, it would've been like a 30-50% sugar at King Fu Tea). I was a little disappointed with this, but the tea itself was fresh. I'm not sure if it's just the variation of different workers making the drinks, or if the sweetness is always this mild but I'll just ask for extra sweetness next time."}
{"text":"I love this place. Amazing selection of teas and bubble teas and cute delicious bites to eat. The staff is so nice. Really good place to hang out."}
{"text":"Went here and tried not to get excited... im from california and i know good boba when i drink it...  After my first sip i was immediately satisfied with my green milk tea with boba!!  The tea at this place is Taiwanese style which is better then Hong Kong style in my opinion, now if only they can add their famous fried chicken and butter toast to their menu...  Word of advise, i like my tea not too sweet and the one they made was perfect for me. However, it is usually a lot sweeter, so if you have a sweet tooth ask for more syrup!"}
{"text":"Jade Mountain is by far the best place to get bubble tea in Madison! I live on the west side, go to school at UW, and I still take the long drive to get to Jade Mountain when my bubble tea craving hits. Their bubble tea tastes exactly like the bubble tea I got when I was in China, and they're very willing to customize your drink to your taste. Their staff is also very fun and friendly. My friend and I were recently there studying for finals and the staff was trying out a new recipe for waffles, and gave us some to try to free! I love this shop so much, I wish I lived closer so I could go everyday!"}
{"text":"Craved boba in Madison and don't care for KFT.  My main complaint is that their selection here is slightly limited (I'm biased--am originally from the Northern Virginia area, which is blessed with bubble tea places out the wazoo). Aside from that, I'm much more than satisfied with my experience here! All drinks and ingredients are prepared fresh; the calm vibe is great; the staff seems friendly and patient.  I'll definitely be coming here as regularly as possible to get work done while sipping on great boba."}
