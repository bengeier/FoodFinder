{"text":"Great food, decent beer selection and a great patio. We just moved into the area and this place will be a regular stop. Service was great, friendly and quick."}
{"text":"Just got back from a terrible brunch experience.  Note - the people who like this place is because they are Avenue Road  people who are there to see and be seen by their neighbours- NOT for the food or service both of which were abysmal.  1. All,orders were wrong. 2. Had to constantly ask for coffee and water, although guy kept walking past our table , not doing his job. 3. Same with clearing dishes- they just sat there as guy kept walking past us oblivious to his job. 4. Couldn't even get waitress' attention to order to begin with. 5. Three- egg omelette was definitely 2 small eggs, very tiny  6. Butter for bread had MOULD on it- waitress didn't even notice and served it to us.  Only good thing was that the manager comped one breakfast that had bacon in it when we asked for no bacon.  You have got be crazy to eat here- Toronto is filled with good restaurants- choose one and avoid this place!"}
{"text":"A friend of mine suggested we eat here after watching the Junior Argos win against Oakville.  Although he is a fan, I really was not impressed.  I feel the prices are too high, 12.99 for a burger, no thanks. The food was good but exceptional and certainly not worth the price.  The service was friendly and fast, and attentive.    The one thing that gets me is why not fix the tables so they don't wobble, really how difficult is this task.  Ours was so bad that as soon as someone lifted their elbows, all our drinks spilled.  Great location, great patio but too crowded, would go back for drinks maybe, but there is much better on Avenue Road to choose from."}
{"text":"We arrived at 5:30 for dinner then Yuk Yuks. The server was friendly but new. The wrong wine was brought for the ladies to start things off but that was handled. Two salads were ordered, one arrived and it took two requests before the second one was delivered. Ladies meals cane out, men's took almost 10 minutes more to arrive. I got the wrong burger but it was close so I just ate it. My buddy ordered fish tacos and got a fish wrap. We had to send the bill back 3 time before it was correct. Food was pretty good but the service ruined it. Next we went down to Yuk Yuks. The ladies wanted the same time as upstairs but were served something different. The waitress was told but never did anything. My buddy too the glasses to the bar and after getting attitude from the bartender the wine was replaced."}
{"text":"Visited a couple weeks ago on a Friday evening.  Restaurant was about 25% capacity.  Greeted at the front by a smiling hostess who quickly showed us our table. Had the children with us that night so they brought them the usual crayons and paper to keep them occupied.  We were starving so we jumped straight into the entrees.  The kids had the normal kids menu fare...chicken fingers and fries and pizza and fries.  I had the gnocci with jumbo tiger shrimp...very delicious and my wife had the fish tacos..can't remember the specific type of fish but she enjoyed it.  We shared a chocolate crunch cake which was absolutely amazing.  Our waiter let us know all deserts are home made by a pastry chef.  Our waiter lived up to expectations and was courtious and attentive.  Atmosphere was cosy, you get a feeling of the downtown feel in Ajax.  Washrooms are clean.  Only drawback is the blaring music...they could stand to turn it down during dinner service. I will be back as I like supporting the local independant restaurants and as well, on the way out, noticed a flyer for DJ's on Thursday night. I'll be sure to review after that experience....forgot to mention...if you like the fries Harvery's used to serve...Safari has them."}
{"text":"Wow we live down the street.  The location is fantastic and we can bring our dog when we get a seat near the fence.  The decor is great!  Yeeetttt....the worst service ever.  We sat for 20 minutes before anyone spoke to us.  After 15 minutes they brought us the someone else's order.... worse it was table behind us and the customer challenged the waitress regarding the wine.  Apparently it was not the type she ordered.   We then ordered our drinks and the waitress brought us the wrong drink.  Frightening thing is that we debated coming at all as the last 3 months have been horrible for service.  While we were there multiple tables complained about the service. We bailed before we could order any food.  Sad but that was the last chance we will give them."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday evening, pretty empty so no need for a reservation. Ordered a pizza and a pasta which looked promising but ending up being flavourless. We really took advantage of the salt and pepper shakers on the table. Drinks are alright,  but for the price you're paying, you're better off elsewhere. Overall, overpriced and overrated. Server was nice, but I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"This used to be our go-to as we live in the neighbourhood.   Beware it is under new ownership. The food is now terrible.  I was there a couple of months ago and seated near the kitchen. I watched a server remove a bun from a burger with her bare hands!  Eww, I hope she washed her hands!  My husbands pizza came back undercooked twice.  He ended up not eating that night.  I gave it another chance last night.  A friend and I each ordered the grilled calamari.  It was slimy and chewy and was floating in what tasted like cheap jarred tomato sauce.  I am so done with this place.  The same goes for Drums and Flats - same new owners.  I miss Dan."}
{"text":"Everything said previously is 100% bang on.   Service is really slow, took us 20mins just to get some water. They brought round some menus and then we had to go upstairs to order our food because we'd booked a party of 30-40 a few months ago and they only thought to put one bartender on. It was pandemonium.  I had the burger which was burnt. Really over priced. The only redeeming feature was the free pool."}
{"text":"Service was exceptional. Order off the new menu.. The waiter indicated that my chicken cooks for just over 20 minutes. I was ok with this. We didn't realize but the dinner took longer than 25 minutes. The manager brought over dinner and apologized and said he took the apps off the bill. Wow...not necessary. The service all night was great. The pepperoni on husbands pizza wasn't as good as usual but overall a great experience. The 10 clove garlic chicken was good. 5 star for service 4 star for food"}
{"text":"After 20 years of food experience, my worst   experience have occurred in this restaurant ,on Father's day it Took 20 min to bring wrong brunch menu , water arrived 25 min after , waitress took our order for beer and after 15 min let us know that she doesn't have the beer , we gave up after 1 hr when we left restaurant very disappointed,  nobody even took our order or even bring a coffee for us , Unprofessional staff , Never go back and do not recommended ,"}
{"text":"I use to order Safari burgers a lot when I was pregnant and always had a positive experience. The burgers and fries taste great. I also really loved their veggie wrap. Over time, however, I've found that the quality of their food noticeably decreased. They were sending smaller quantities of less flavourful food. I eventually stopped ordering from them one day when they sent me one piece of calamari in tomato sauce - when I ordered deep fried calamari. When I complained to \"Just Eat\" - I was informed that the restaurant denied even preparing my order (what the heck is that?). Never ordered from them again."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick bite with friends mid-week. We all ordered pizzas and they were all very good (The Green, The Red, The Forest). They offer gluten free crust and were able to accommodate the many substitutions and dietary restrictions of our group without a problem. Price was on point with most pizza/pasta restaurants in the neighbourhood. The service was pretty good. It took a while to get menus, but once we did everything went fine. Overall a solid spot. They have billiards upstairs for pre/post-meal fun."}
{"text":"I have seldom experienced restaurants with worse service or a more unappealing menu. Upon arrival at this restaurant the first thing I noticed is that it is LOUD, I know it says bar but the lack of local watering holes in this area most mean that too many locals crowd into this cramped overrated lack luster establishment.   Although I wanted to leave immediately, with the moeny I already spent on parking I was already \"in the hole\". The menu is basic, with odd exceptions that one would never consider ordering from a bar. Its busy dark, loud and adding insult to injury is that you have to wait an exceedingly long time for everything!!! its unbelievable how long my girlfriend and I were left sitting around before we were asked for our drink orders or even giver menus.  If you are on Avenue Road look elsewhere for your dining need unless its early and you have time to kill, and my last piece of advice would be....Bring a book  Cheer,"}
{"text":"A friend & I went for lunch several weeks ago & I ordered the Tribal Salad, which I usually do.  My friend had the fish tacos.  My salad greens were dead: limp & tasteless, there were no parmesan chips and the chicken chunks were so tough I could barely chew them.  My friend's fish was tough as well.  I won't return if this is the chef's idea of actual food.  Safari has a lot of nerve serving this garbage.  We have been patrons for years.  What happened, Safari?"}
{"text":"Was there last nite & had an awesome time - really good 80's band (the \"McFlys\")!  Re: food, can only comment on the nachos, which hit the spot. Service was quick and reliable. Small but cozy, enough room to find a spot to dance. We're looking forward to going back!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here in the past and used to enjoy the food, service and atmosphere. Tonight was a big let down on all three. Actually had to send back a dish. The 'Fish Taco' that showed up as a flavourless wrap! Definitely NOT a taco! It was a wasted evening out. This used to be a highlight in Durham region. Not sure what's happened, but won't be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Server was good at first but as the tables began to fill up she couldn't multi task. The lamb was burnt. Fries were way too salty. I asked for no onions and wasn't told the burger would then be sauce less because there was onions in the sauce. I was offered mayo or guacamole which also had onions in it. The attempt to fix the situation took too long so I got fed up and said take it away and off the bill. I will not be back!"}
{"text":"I loved this place the first couple of times I went. The food was inventive and service was great. Since then I haven't been as impressed. The menu hasn't changed much over the years and the service became poor. I really wish they would change things up."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why Safari has such low ratings. I've been here multiple times and will always come back for the Safari Burger with sweet potato fries. This is must try! If you want to gauge how good this burger is, I'd definitely rate it as a \"HIMYM burger!\""}
{"text":"Gotta say I'm a little surprised by the hate for Safari!  It's an easily accessible spot for my family, and the huge patio is always a big draw. Over the years I've had patio parties before going away overseas, to school, and I've never been disappointed.  Went last night for dinner on the patio at 7:30. We had called around 6:30 to ask about a reservation, but at least for the patio, they won't take them for parties of less than six. They told us we probably wouldn't have to wait long, and they were right, no wait at all.  Service was prompt, and when I spilled my half-drank beer our server brought me a fresh one on the house. Don't abuse that system, though!  We shared some Irish nachos to start, which were tasty, if a bit uninspiring. Their homemade kettle chips were good, but a bit under-seasoned in my books. For a main my mom and I split the (9oz) Safari burger which had cheese, mushrooms, bacon and sauteed onions. It was huge and delicious-looking, and came speared with a big knife. Unfortunately they cook burgers all the way through, and I just can't call a well-done burger perfect for me. I understand the rules, but gosh I don't like em.  The side ceaser we had with it was great.  My boyfriend had the chicken wrap which I've always dug, and my dad had the souvlaki pizzadilla - he loved it.  All in all, the food stops it from getting to the next level, but I dig Safari."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in years and this was my first time trying out their food and it was just meh.  Thankfully our server (I believe his name was Ricardo) knew someone in our party so the service was friendly.  He does seem like a genuinely nice person so that's great for the Safari Bar & Grill.  Other wait staff/servers were a little rude and the food took about an hour.    [Starters] Calamari Fritti With Smoked Jalapeño Mayo - The portion itself was actually pretty good and it also tasted pretty good.  Was worth $11 and definitely can be shared between 2 to 3 people. 5/5  Irish Nachos - This was also quite good and was a big serving.  Normally, Irish Nachos are serves with waffle fries but theirs was actually, what seemed like, fresh potato chips.  The toppings were good, but there could've been more. 4/5  [Main] Linguine Del Mare - This was served with Black Tiger Shrimp, Calamari And Mussels Tossed In A Spiced Provençal Sauce.  Sounds fancy, right?  Well the presentation itself was very lovely and you get a very generous amount of seafood however the dish was lacking flavor. Even with fresh ground pepper and grated parmesan cheese - a lot of both - the dish was still very bland.  I ended up taking mine home and re-heating it in a pan with one of those ready made Philadelphia garlic cream sauce.  Trust me, it tasted waaaay better! I would give this dish 3/5 stars simply due to the amount of seafood you get."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to this restaurant in probably 5 years or more.  Unlike the previous reviewer, we found a parking spot right out front.    My gf and I decided to try something simple and out of the norm for our one year anniversary.  So we had a very cheery server, which he happened to mention was the manager of the place.  So we ordered a couple of alcoholic bevvies to start. Then we had the goat cheese spinach dip. Same as pretty much any other dip.  The baked pita bread was good but the very salty tortilla chips probably tostitos were MEH!    Then we ordered goat cheese chicken and cheese burger and fries. My goat cheese chicken wasn't too bad.  I wouldn't say to die for but the side items were pretty delicious although one piece of the ravioli was burned, unless it was charred.  My gf liked her burger and fries.    The place changed a little bit from the last time I went there where you are in plain view of the cooks, which they seemed a bit young.But hey.  They've gotta start somewhere right?    Maybe I'll go back, if they pick my name out of their contest.  LOL"}
{"text":"I went on a Saturday night with my husband. We're both in our early 40s and currently scoping to find a fun place to venture on our much needed date nights.  The waiter was super nice, I ordered the Red Pizza with a special 'safaritina' cocktail and he ordered the burger and a bottle of beer.  I'm not as picky on quality of food, as much husband, but we were both pleasantly surprised by the portions, price and service.  I later asked about the pool tables, and we ventured a few games in the basement below (bartender was also very friendly).  A few pool tables were reserved for a larger group, later on, but we were there early enough (around 10pm) to find a table for at least 2 hours.  Around midnight, the basement was pretty packed with people playing pool, and/or a few dancing on the floor.  I found the crowd mixed, mostly older (like us, haha), but a few young ones too. I sensed we all wanted the same thing: to have a good time, in a decent place.  All in all, we both decided to return. :-D"}
{"text":"Can I just say Safari is out this world. The sweet potato fries were the stuff dreams are made of. It felt like I was floating on a cloud. The spinach and roasted goat cheese dip was phenomenal and just melted in the mouth. The chefs are amazing culinary gods. Our servers Samantha and Kayla were so caring and attentive it was like they could read our minds of what we wanted. Ask for them to be your servers when ever you come. I say to management employees of the month every month."}
{"text":"I like the patio but that's probably the best part of this place. It's a family friendly spot with a safe menu, and a couple of decent beers but don't expect great food.  I think it's slightly above average pricing for the quality to be honest, thus I gave it 2 stars instead of 3.  The burger was so so - not terrible but nothing to write home about either - especially for $18.  The wings were again standard but not juicy enough.  It was the pizza that was the biggest disappointment.  They definitely don't have the nice thin crust concept down and just add gobs of less than stellar cheese to their pies.  It's the type of thing you regret ordering once you look at it and before you even taste it.  Either do a nice Italian style or a good American style pie, this was neither and didn't taste much better than frozen pizza from the supermarket to be honest."}
{"text":"I guess Monday night is not a good night for this restaurant. We walked by the kitchen being sat down and the kitchen staff were using the f word liberally. While we were looking at the menu we could hear the kitchen staff talking, not a conversation we wanted to hear. Then some one came in off the street and walked in to the kitchen to have a conversation with the staff. The service was ok and the food was mediocre, we left over half our meal on the table and all our server could ask was if we wanted it packaged. We will not be back!"}
{"text":"I don't understand the hate. I think it's pretty good!"}
{"text":"We'd been to Safari in the past for some wings & beer etc., and were always satisfied with service, price and food.   This time we were planning an event, a Sunday brunch for about 50 people. My wife & I recently married in Vegas, so wanted a reception brunch here for those who couldn't make it there.   We went in a couple of months early and were met by the \"events manager\" Kayla. She was more than helpful, booking the basement room and giving us menus for various buffet items running from about $13 to $18 per person plus tax & tip.   We returned about 3 weeks prior to the event & Kayla advised that she recommended the main floor, saying they would close to the public for our 3 hours. We ordered for 50 plus 7 kids meals. We had given $100 deposit at original time of booking, and nothing further was required until we were done. We ordered a combo with sliders, bbq chicken wraps, and fries. We added a couple of dollars per person for coffee & soft drinks. We were going to pay as you go for liquor wine & beer.  We were able to bring a wedding cake, and packages of cookies for our guests, and the restaurant supplied the plates etc for the cake.  On the day of, we met with Kayla & Ricardo. Throughout the event we received unbelievably great service. Our guests remarked that they couldn't believe ther was only 2 people serving us.   The food wasn't \"fine dining\" but was very good. It was however exceeded by the service, and we would absolutely recommend Safar Ajax."}
{"text":"I love the food here, and upstairs is so cool. Patio is awesome. I love the pizza's and one of the few places that you could get Innis and Gunn on tap; plus the service is good. Downstairs is dark and good place to get away for dinner. Upstairs is fun; pool table, table tennis and darts take up a good portion. Like the place!!"}
{"text":"Safari used to be one of my favourite places when they first opened up. I have eaten here many times food in my opinion is hit and miss both in value and taste. They have great burgers and wings however I have been dissapointed when ordering anything else.   The prices of food at Safari are pretty expensive I believe they really are trying to seem like an upscale restaurant.  The reasons I have begun to dislike Safari over the years and no longer go are as such:  They have a restaurant style upstairs and downstairs they have billiards a bar and even a small dance floor on weekends which they now charge cover for every weekend and I haven't been in a while but Safari can be very hit or miss on weekends. Before when there was no cover it was this way but it really turned out annoying when you would come on a Saturday and the place was dead but you were paying cover to get in, I could understand this just not in Ajax.  They used to always have the downstairs open and pool used to be free (with drink or food purchase) Tuesday - Thursday 6:00 PM - 8:00 PM and free all day on Sunday after 5:00 PM - The problem with this was it seemed that only 25% of the staff actually knew about it. I can't tell you how many times the person behind the bar would argue with me that they have never heard of free pool only to go upstairs and have to come down and apologize. If it happened once or twice it would have been more understandable but it honestly happened 5-6 times.   The final straw for me and Safari was the complete lack of consistency of the downstairs being open it became completely hit or miss whether it would open and was a waste of the gas to find out of we could play pool. And the crazy thing is all it would take is 1 person to serve people down there.  Anyway this review got long... Safari used to be great although pricey, now it's just pricey."}
{"text":"Went in for a Sunday brunch and didn't really do any drinking or billiards which is what I assume most people do there on evenings. We spent all the time in the patio which was very nice albeit slightly cramped if you have a seat lined next to the building.  Service was definitely friendly, although a little slow but I can look past that. The main reason this place is getting a 2 star review is that the food quality was not that great. I got the Egg's Benedict and did not enjoy it too much. It was cooked all right and everything but just tasted unhealthy and like no real care was put in to it, comparing it to breakfast in places like Fran's or Over Easy. Hmm that does sound harsh, maybe I should just say not to get the Egg's Benedict and go for something like the apple french toast which was good and a must get if you like apples and french toast.   A couple of other reason for the 2 star is that I believe it's over priced (close to $3 for a regular cup of coffee? No thanks) and my friends coffee came with 2 lipstick stains on it, and a pitcher of water had some sort of floating leaf/moss type thing. Again I would revert back to my \"not caring\" outlook.   I'm not a fan of writing low star reviews, and I'm fairly certain that if I am made to go again, the experience would probably be better if we refrained from eating and just went on a night out.   In terms of parking, ample space all around on Avenue and the side street. Parking is free on the north side of that side street next to the restaurant while the south side is paid parking (on the weekends at least!) so that was a small plus."}
{"text":"Safari - just a very standard breakfast spot.  Never been there for dinner but had brunch a few times.  This sunday - not a whole lot of staff on, which made waiting for coffee, etc. a little bit of an issue.  The toast was not toasted but the eggs were poached and a few mix-ups on the ordering.  Overall - just a standard breakfast - nothing spectacular and nothing terrible."}
{"text":"This place has potential.. But service is pretty bad. If your server is also the bartender good luck asking for anything. We wanted dessert but waited so long I went to the bar to ask for the bill.  If you go, they have a really delicious butter tart you have to get (which we didn't order this time out of frustration)."}
{"text":"Went here tonight with 2 friends and we really enjoyed ourselves! It's not fancy so don't expect it to be. It's a very relaxed atmosphere. Burgers, wraps, pizza and seafood. I got the Hawaiian and it was good. Could feed two people. I took half of it home. Prices are reasonable. Server was so polite and friendly. He didn't hover and kept bringing us water even after we paid but we continued chatting. I'd go back. I'm curious to try the lamb burger."}
{"text":"My review is going to seem really different from the others, I think.   Safari holds a certain amount of nostalgia with me, it's where my Husband and I had our first date and where we celebrated our wedding anniversary last night.   I think the food is great- you have to keep in mind that this restaurant has the sometimes difficult task of satisfying the food needs of an interesting and somewhat diverse cultural/religious group. As a result, their menu is a mish-mash of different things, with no real direction. But everything on it is pretty good.   When you are seated, they provide you with fresh bread and roasted red pepper hummus. That's pretty different, I think.   They're also family friendly and have a second floor that houses televised events, pool tables, etc. And the bar is stocked, of course.   The servers leave a bit to be desired. I think their laissez-faire attitudes stem from the fact that Safari is one of the few family-friendly, well-priced eateries in this neighbourhood and people will come despite poor service.   There's not a ton of parking in the neighbourhood (all street parking or Green P) so you've gotta snatch something if you find it.   There are many, many restaurants which are much, much better, but this place holds a special place in my heart and the food is pretty good. And I think they know that."}
{"text":"Went today for Winterlicious.  The lunch was ok for $15.  Very bland food.  Had spring rolls, kabob and apple tart.  Friends had soup, fish and butter tart.  Service was slow even though the restaurant was not busy.  Disappointed we were not offered wine or a drink menu.  Coffee refills were abundant.  Looks like a decent menu, but will not return as there was no taste or atmosphere at the place."}
{"text":"Winterlicious Part 2: Safari Grill on Avenue Road north of Lawrence is a good ol' local food joint that focuses on traditional American food with a twist. Upon entry, they've actually got two entrances, one for their restaurant and the other with stairs leading to their second floor bar that's filled with pool tables and ping-pong tables.  Firstly this felt like a cozy place, perfect for a date, simple, cozy and yet classy...overall a very warm environment!  Our server was very sweet, casual and open to providing recommendations.  For starters I had their Roasted apple and squash bisque! great melody of flavor. Mains: being a carnivore I tried their Cajun rubbed fall-off-the-bone baby back ribs smeared with a bourbon BBQ sauce served with winter vegetables.  Truly delicious and the portions were more than enough! Dessert: White Chocolate and Raspberry Butter Tart a great way to end off an excellent meal.  Looking at their regular menu, portion and prices, its quite a reasonable place that I'll have to visit again!  Easy 4 stars for this place."}
{"text":"What a dump. I need to stop going to awful places with my friends who think these dive bars are the place to be. Seriously, you are making money now. Stop going to places like this. And I know it's not for the food. Because I know better places that serve pub food than here. The only reason why they are probably still open is because there are a ton of residential places in the area and not a lot of bars to go to. Plus, parking is awful because it's on Avenue Rd and getting a spot on the side street near the restaurant can be very hard.  But anyways, the wings were terribly overcooked and extremely hard to bite into. It almost seemed as if they had been deep fried, left out to cool for too long and then thrown back in again. I had 3 of these before stopping myself. And the hot wings were not hot at all.   So I figured I'd try something else and something that isn't served in most pubs. The lamb burger. What a disappointment. Once again, it was way overcooked even though I asked for it cooked medium. It came out well done. Now I'm not a fan of sending food back but I had to on this time and when I do, I get a sneer for my waitress. Seriously, do you want to see the back of my fist?  Will not come back."}
{"text":"Stick to the drinks at Safari. Great beer selection and always a good crowd. Pool tables upstairs."}
{"text":"Samantha was our waitress and she was fantastic! The food was cooked perfectly, flavourful and tasty. Comfortable relaxed atmosphere, We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My fiancee and I chose Safari to host our engagement get-together with a bunch of our closest friends and family. We'd been here before last year for my fiancee's brothers birthday party and thought it was a neat place to host a group of friends without breaking the bank.  We booked the space upstairs where their pool tables are located, and they sectioned off a nice corner for our party. They had a coat rack, a table set up for us to put a cupcake stand, as well as a buffet table where the finger foods would be served. There was only one waitress serving the entire upstairs area, and there were other guests up there eating and playing pool, but our server was pretty great.   We ordered Chicken Wraps, Chicken Wings and Sliders for the whole group. The food itself was alright, but the only complaint I have is portion. We ordered 25 orders and there was only one platter for each item. Last year when we were here, the hosts told us they ordered the same amount (25 orders) and it looked like they had almost double the amount of food. A little disappointed there.  One last complaint I have, when I paid the bill I wasn't told the gratuities would be included (but I should have known since it was a large party), but after 5 pints and 3 shots, I didn't even think about it until the next morning and double checked the bill and realized I had given a tip on top of mandatory gratuities. Oops.  Overall, it's a good place to hang out with friends. There aren't a lot of pubs with ample pool tables (and at a good price of $10/hr), and a good selection on tap in the uptown area. (Please see my review on Spacco, LOL)"}
{"text":"Been to this restaurant twice and both times I was really disappointed. The food service is so slow. They took an hour to get my pizza today. And when they brought it, it was just warm and tasted sad. How can they mess us pizza so bad. I have tried other stuff also and overall the food is just ok, but quite expensive. I would not recommend the place."}
{"text":"I would leave zero stars if I could. We went for winterlicious. The salad and soup was just delicious.  The music was very loud ask if it could be lowered. We had to shout across table for our friends to hear us. The ribs were just ok served with cold fries, the fish was cold, when it came back from kitchen it was still cold and dry.  The replacement dinner pasta was so greasy it turned my stomach after one bite. The rice pudding tasted like bread pudding.  We will NOT come back.    Wasn't impressed with how manager dealt with the problem. I never ate a main course.  Eating there was a big waste of money"}
{"text":"although i've eaten at this restaurant several times, i definitely don't return because of the service.  the food is great. the spinach dip appetizer is delicious, and it's consistently good. the dinner menu is sophisticated pub food, but i have yet to find a single item on the menu that i don't like. overall, i really enjoy the food, and eating on the patio makes the experience much better.   the part i really don't like is the service. i find the hostesses are always quick to have you seated, but it takes forever to get the order in, let alone deliver the food. i always have to remind the waiter/waitress to bring the humus dip, which is complimentary and really good. when the weather is nice and the patio is full, service is even slower and the kitchen is overrun.   i would still recommend this restaurant to anyone. i find that the good food and nice restaurant environment surpasses the pour service."}
{"text":"Nice decor.  Was recommended to this restaurant by my date.  Food and service was great.  We first started with the appetizer (mussels).  These were excellent.  In fact the best mussels I ever had.  I then had spicy angel hair pasta, and my date had pork chop.  The pork chop was great, but the angel hair was a bit too spicy for me.  So I ended up ordering fish for myself (catch of the day).  The fish wasn't that great unfortunately.  Fish wasn't fresh, and the rice was bland.  The vegetables were probably the only decent part of the dish.    Bad luck for me that day I guess.  My date has been here for years, and told me they use to have more Cajun food on the menu."}
{"text":"Nice place for bar type food! Good atmosphere and the best fries in the city."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love free stuff?! Don't know if it was by luck or if its a regular thing, but on this trip we ended up getting free lemonade and 2 free beers. It may have been that the waiter just forgot to put it on the bill, but it wouldn't surprise me if the waiter just comp'd it. No doubt, the best service I have ever received at a restaurant!!!!! The waiter knew the menu like the back of his hand and gave his honest opinions. He made us feel at home and did everything to make it the best experience. And again, free is always a winner in my books.  The food was pretty good. As suggested, I ordered the lamb burger. Always love lamb and the shaved red onion and cucumber and cheese was a perfect complement to the yogurt sauce. The burger was a little overcooked, but still full of flavor! Also ordered the wings. Once again, I didn't man up and got afraid of trying the clinically insane sauce, but after trying the medium, I think I would get it if I ever find myself back in Toronto (probably won't ever happen). The medium sauce was sweet and didn't pack any heat. But the wings themselves were a hit!  We came for lunch so it was pretty empty, but the restaurant itself was great. The lounge area upstairs was also awesome especially for watching the Euro Cup matches."}
{"text":"AMAZING!! My husband & I held our wedding reception at Safari in Ajax on Sunday October 4th, 2015 & we couldn't have been more thrilled with the whole experience! The atmosphere was great, the food was delicious & made fresh to order, and the service was excellent. All of our guests had nothing but fantastic things to say about Safari. Whether it is an intimate dinner for 2, a fun party for 10-15 people or a large party like our wedding reception (app 60 ppl) you won't be disappointed if you choose Safari! The event planner Samantha was so much fun to work with, she was attentive & dedicated to making our event a true success. The servers were friendly, quick & efficient, & the bartender Nadine was just fantastic! Quick to prepare & serve drinks with great personality & style. We are long standing customers & knew we made the right decision when we chose Safari as our wedding venue.....we were NOT wrong! Our guests haven't stopped commenting on how great the food was & how much fun they had. THANK YOU SAFARI for making our wedding day dreams a reality! You've got customers for life in us! Choose Safari for your next event, you won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"I usually have a good time here but the staff there was terrible...We got there and the pool table we wanted was reserved..so the manager graciously bought my group a shot and gave us a table to sit and chat...we ordered a drink and 2 minutes later the waitress came over with the bill...I was thinking we didnt ask for the bill....5  minutes later she comes back and asks us if we were going to pay it....so I told her we never asked for the bill but we will pay it if she wants us out that badly...so we paid the bill she came and got the money and 25 minutes later she came back with the change..Not a good experience at all"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were wandering around killing time when we came across this place to grab lunch. I got the Del Mare pasta and he got the Safari Burger. We both enjoyed the food! The service was just meh however. Waiter seemed bothered by us being there and inconvenienced when we were ordering. He never actually stopped at our table or smiled for that matter. Just wandered by and asked what we wanted. He wasn't terribly rude, just acted snobby."}
{"text":"This little spot in Durham was kinda fun. I went there once about 8 years ago, and it was a nice place to dance with my friends.  Went back this time with a group of family to see since some wanted to dance. The location had about 20 people there dancing or playing pool. Was a bit dim lit, but kinda expected.  Didnt have food, just drinks. Price is decent, but nothing amazing. Go if you want to dance/play pool/drink. You might enjoy the relax."}
{"text":"I like the food and service here. However three of us came in for lunch today. I hardly ever get cold but it was FREEZING cold. The waitress said they just turned the heat on. This was close to 4pm. The shrimp was so good I ordered more but I ended up taking it to go as it was just to cold."}
{"text":"We love this place! A neighbourhood fav with a nice big patio that seats plenty, and the food is very nice. Their nachos are my favorite, while my bestie loves the fettuccini and my Hunny loves the burger and also the wings. Just a really nice vibe. Staff are very friendly and accommodating! #bebacksoon"}
{"text":"Safari looks like it could be a great bar to hang out and get something to eat. But sadly the staff don't seem to care to make an effort.  Service is so slow a one-legged turtle would be quicker. We were sat for over ten minutes before anyone even came to our table. Then when she did it was another ten minutes just to get a menu. We eventually placed an order, and waited for our food to arrive. And waited. And waited some more. Once it came it wasn't worth the wait. Bland burgers and very dry chicken.  With a better chef and serving staff, Safari would be a great establishment. Sadly, until then it will just be an overpriced place to spend your day waiting."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch. The salad dressing was excellent, the mixed baby greens unfortunately had more than their fair share of wilting. In the past I've always loved their Irish nachos. Today, not so much... The cheese was mostly unmelted, and the chips weren't hot. I think someone in the kitchen took their eye off the ball. This is in contrast to my numerous previous visits."}
{"text":"I've come here and had great food then come here another time and had the lamb burger that tasted like seafood and blood (worse possible mix ever) if you do plan on coming here I would not suggest ordering the lamb burger however other dishes such as there pasta has never failed. Good environment and on Fridays it's a nice night out with a live DJ."}
