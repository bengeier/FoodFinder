{"text":"Was not impressed at all. Below average bbq at premium prices. A great bbq place MUST have killer sides and the ones we got were average at best. The owners are very nice and hands on. Maybe we had an off night order so we will try again mainly because the staff and owners were so nice when we were there."}
{"text":"Not a fan of the pulled pork or the brisket we ordered on their last day of the season. Both portion sizes were appropriate for the price, but dry and not much flavor.  

We will give them another try once they open back up in the spring.

Also, Long wait times to order and receive the food.  BBQ should not take 30-35 mins from ordering to receiving."}
{"text":"In my opinion It is truly the best BBQ in the area. It is only there seasonally at this point, but will soon be a permanent part of the area.  Had stopped by after several good reviews through friends and social media.

Owner is a very engaging gentleman who took the time to come out and greet us, offer samples of any of his food, and explained his operation. After we placed an order, he took time to show us the smokers he uses out back.

The brisket was absolutely delicious. Tender, juicy, melt in your mouth with just a bit of Char. Jalape√±o Mac and cheese was tasty, without being overly spicy. 

We are looking forward to going back soon. Seating is limited to some picnic tables and chairs, so until it becomes permanent it is best taken to go."}
