{"text":"Terrible service .... Terrible over cooked wings. 

Literally was like eating dried out oil jerky ... Not sure how they are still in business. 


Tip* save your time and money go somewhere else... Anywhere else will be better."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 0 stars I would. 

Everyone beware, we ordered take out for a party and when we opened the package at home only 2/3rds of the amount of wings we ordered were there. This place is an absolute joke. The wings they give you are tiny and they cheat you on order size. Even after calling the store to complain the owner got on the phone and rudely told us we were wrong and he was right.  We paid over $120 dollars and got 50 wings when we should of received 80. Save your hard earned money and get your wings from duffs or all star. Do not be scammed by this wild wings and the dishonest owner/management."}
{"text":"these wings suck and location is dirty.  Skip this place unless you want a real dirty wing experience."}
{"text":"WORST wild wings I have been to! HORRIBLE service. Walked in with a friend and was not acknowledged. So we just picked a table and sat down. Waited and waited.... no one came to serve us or even offer drinks or acknowledged us. The girl at the bar was busy..... drinking..... with a bunch of men. Are servers even allowed to drink like that on the job? Finally another server came out glanced at us and walked back into the kitchen....... after 15 min of sitting there we just left. NEVER AGAIN."}
{"text":"Really bad food. Sticky tables. Jalape√±o poppers were horrible, you can tell they were frozen and fried. Mozzarella sticks weren't any better. The wings were just ok.  Over battered and over fried. The best part of my meal was the Pepsi. Service was the only part that was good."}
{"text":"I found the wings not great at all for a place that boasts they have the best. They have a nice and exotic variation of flavours but the wings were a bit below average.
I ordered TWO platters of the Wing Sampler which allows you to choose 4 different flavours in-groups of 5 wings since I wanted to try a variety and see which I liked best. I was able to taste the, Honey Garlic***, Brown Eyed Girl*. Garlic Garlic**, Hickory Dickory Doc**, Lemon Pepper*, Naked Buffalo*, Spicy Lemon* and Some Beach*. Fries were ok, dill sauce sucked and the service was not even mediocre - when waiting for the bill, my server was no where in sight. I had to call a different server to find out where my actual server was! Overall I was a bit disappointed and walked away feeling this place was anything but spectacular."}
{"text":"I have waited over 20 minutes and no one came to get our drink orders. Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"The fact this place is still open blows my mind. Only reason we went to this restaurant is because it was late (10pm) and close to us. Had a table for 8, mind you there were only about 6-7 tables seated. Took 10 mins for the waitress to come take our orders, waited 25-30 mins for the food to come. Everything came but two orders of wings.. again 5 mins later the waitress comes back and asks what we ordered..yep another 20 mins for two orders or wings. Asked for water couple of times but did not receive.. waitress had their friends coming in and was talking to them the entire time.

Finally asked for the bill and there was a 15% service charge added on the bill which is fine..restaurant policy.. but you'd expect at least a decent service. 

Brought it up to the manager's attention but he came back to me saying it was really busy.. which it wasn't... and also 25 mins is the ideal time it takes for the food to come out. He then decided to knock off 2 bucks for the poutine upgrade.

Never will I step foot in this restaurant ever again."}
{"text":"I'm really surprised at the other reviews. I have gone a few times and they service and the wings have always been really good. I love all the flavour options they give you so there's something for everyone. I am not really keen on a lot of spice so I normally go for the mild items, gar par is amazing and so is blue-eyed blonde and texas honey.

You can order them without bones, which is nice because you get more meat for you dollar. I've never been here to eat during a game but I gone in and I know that it gets pretty packed. They have many televisions and a large screen to watch it on.

Only thing that could be improved in my mind is the little vegetable sticks. Normally they're good and crisp, but sometimes they're not and I know that seems small but I am not interested in noshing on a sad limp carrot / celery stick."}
{"text":"I have never been so dissatisfied with my food EVER and I've once received a bug in my food. I ordered the cheddar burger ( I know it's a wing place) it was absolutely disgusting could taste the freezer burn but couldn't spot any cheddar however I only took a couple of bites before the freezer burnt meat took over anyways after I dry heaved from the foul taste I couldn't find my side order of ceased salad (yuck just got another whiff of the burger) my salad was wrapped in wax paper lol it was completely uneatable gobs of salad dressing piled together every piece of lettuce was drenched so I literally ordered something that's going right in the garbage... just awesome! Oh... fries were good.. ;)"}
{"text":"The wings were watered down and not that great. Also ordered the calamari and it was over cooked and tasted like fish sticks. Although the server was sweet and polite she was the only one working and I did leave her a nice tip despite the really poor food. I've been to other wild wings and I have to say this is my least favorite.  I took my mother and sisters out and dropped $100 for a really poor meal. I would have rather ate at a Tim Hortons or somewhere in all honesty.."}
{"text":"Food was acceptable. Wings were on the small size and a bit over - cooked. Sauces were tasty but applied a bit too generously. Been to better Wild Wings before."}
{"text":"Love this place!  I have yet to be disappointed at any of their locations.  Strangely, I became a vegetarian a few months back and love that I can get a wrap from Wild Wing with any of their sauces.  It allows me to enjoy the great taste without compromising my diet.  You haven't had wings until you've had wild wing."}
{"text":"I've tried Wild Wing before at the Thomas/Tenth Line location, but this was my first time at the Heartland location and we went for lunch on a weekend during the summer. I guess it was the time of day, but it was absolutely empty...

The menu is the same as any Wild Wing location and as mentioned, there is a wide variety of flavours for wings, all of which we ordered were quite tasty. However, the pulled pork sandwich...never again. 

This location is close to home, but I've had better wings for the same price."}
{"text":"Earlier this evening I ordered lemon pepper wings and an extra order of fries.  When my husband and I went to pick up the order, there were no wings available with a lemon flavour, so I had to substitute and wait for the wings.  I was charged for the wings and extra fries.  .  When I arrived home, we only had one order of fries.  

I phoned the restaurant and was told that I could come and either pick up the fries/refund or a credit would be applied to my next order.  This is terrible customer service and quality control.  In my opinion, Wild Wings should have either delivered either the fries or the refund.  I should not be expected to go back and get what I have already paid for.  After all, what is so difficult about this order?  In addition, I think that staff should have phoned me when they realized that they did not have the ingredients on hand to fill my order.  

In my opinion, Wild wings owes me a full refund."}
{"text":"If I could give these guys a zero I would. They straight up told me to go some where else because they were full. No wait time, nothing... Just go somewhere else. What the fuck?"}
{"text":"The service was good and so were the wings, I went for traditional Buffalo style spicy wings, my friend went for gar-par. Going one for one with the wings was cool as these flavours compliment each other. Nice to be able to get a seat and get beer."}
{"text":"Fair wings. Duffs is much much better -- simply head down the street. Who breads their wings?? Only chains that buy pre-frozen I gather."}
{"text":"Nice place but really crappy service , we order take out fron this place and when we arrived home our order was completly wrong  will never order from  them again  ."}
{"text":"Wild Wing smells like a piss filled dumpster. Not the cute baby pee that smells like marshmallows and licorice but the concentrated, baked-in-the-sun piss of one thousand elderly alcoholics after an all night bender of southern comfort and miller.

The smell doesn't hit you when you enter but gradually permeates your skin and hair.

I ordered wings to-go and a beer at the bar. The beer was poured but then forgotten. While the beer was within arms-reach, I feared that I'd lose a hand to the swing of a rusty sword if I attempted to serve myself.

I can't comment on the quality of the wings. I needed three showers and four whiskies to get past the smell. By then, the wings were cold and hard."}
{"text":"I tend to go here for lunch every now and then. I have to say the latest server they have is beyond horrible. I sat down at the bar and waited 10 minutes to order a beer. Then had to flag her down to ask for a menu. Thought I'd give it another shot, got the same server just ordered my usual without going through the trouble of asking for a menu. Got my wings and beer, no napkins, no bone plate, and she disappeared from there. 

Going to search for a new wing spot."}
{"text":"I've only been to two wild wing branches and this one sucks I ordered the Cadillac ranch the wings were barely covered with sauce and the pint and pound special has to be only on Thursday while the one at airport Rd. And queen would let you have the special any day of the week and you're wings are drenched with the sauce and enough fries for two, the two stars are for the friendly customer service."}
{"text":"Great service.  Great food everytime.  Always accommodating. Small and cozy.  Come enjoy a nice cold beer anytime before 11"}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting a wing place in Toronto.
Food-wise, the wings were delicious.They had a 1.5 lb for the price of a lb offer since it was Tuesday. We ordered a double (two flavors) of Honey Blues and Naked Buffalo. The order arrived pretty fast with two dips, and some vegetables. They were delicious! The Honey Blues are definitely worth a try if you're looking to get your hands messy and your teeth sinking into something sweet! The Naked Buffalo wings were standard wings. They weren't that spicy, as their menu indicated with a small blue star. Our sodas were bottomless, too.
After finishing our wings, we decided to go for another round of the double, this time with medium buffalo wings and the honky tonk. I favored the medium wings more this time, the honey garlic flavor didn't really cut it for me. 
I would note that there was only one waitress around [that I know of], but there weren't that many people there anyway and she was handling things pretty well. 
Overall, it's a pretty nice and quiet place to go to if you're looking for some delicious wings, but I'm sure there's better."}
{"text":"Lots of wing flavors friendly staff on of the cleanest bars I have seen. Sports on the tv and not too busy so not loud and you can have a conversation."}
{"text":"This place is seriously the worst. Just go anywhere else. The nachos are pure comedy genius."}
{"text":"I went there once in the summer and never again. 

It was a weekend night and there's only 2 people sitting around the bar. They only have one waitress who doubles as a bartender. So you basically expect no service. The food didn't taste too warm I guess she couldn't make it back into the kitchen in time to pick up our food. But it's a small town so I guess they just didn't expect too much and didn't bother hiring more staff.

However they have pretty baller decorations which is why I'm giving it 2 stars instead of just 1."}
{"text":"I went yesterday to this joint and right of the bat the service was underwhelming. It really seemed like our waitress didn't want us there at all. We all ordered wings and my friend wanted to substitute one of the dipping sauces from dill to sour cream. She said that would be extra. Really?? For sour cream?? The wings were small and our waitress never told us about the Tuesday special were you get an extra half pound. It was only once we had paid where we realized this. She got our bills wrong and when we asked for her to correct it she still couldn't get it right. There are far better places out there for wings."}
{"text":"unbattered wings were tiny and overly sauced with the base sauce, drowning out the specialty sauce.
fried pickles overly battered.
service was ok
frankly I would not go back, had better wings at another wild wing location."}
{"text":"Food was horrible. The wings were tiny and flavorless and everyone at my table got a burger, all were disgusting. The waitress didn't ask how anything was when she clearly saw the slightly picked at food when bringing us the check. Just terrible."}
{"text":"Food is not bad at all.  Especially Wings and its flies are good.  Wing is not small.  It's still juicy and I really like its sauce taste and choice.  The blue moonshine night cheese dipping for my daughter's fries is a smooth texture and just right flavour which even my wife loves that.  I think Wild Wing's wing has a quality on food in average.  Portion is ok compare to its price level.  They have kids menu and the portion is just right.

Only thing I am not quite satisfy which I can tell is the service it provide with the price.  I mean the service from getting reception to table.  The waiter told us it is around 15 min but I have waited 25 to 30min but actually the place is not that full at that time.  Well, it is me and my son's birthday, so I don't want to ruin the time.   Wait time on the food is not fast but I am patient enough along with my smartphone.

Place are big, clean but definitely a sport bar is quite noisy for family but good for a big group over 10.  Be sure you reserves for table otherwise you will be frustrated unless you want to sit in the bar side.

I think I am one of the kindest about the reviews.  I cannot say Wild Wing is very bad in food, but service wise, it needs to be improved in order impress people to come back for a second visit.  Or unless they have a very good price or food quality or speciality, otherwise, it is even hard to impress a not-so-demand guy to come back a second time."}
{"text":"The food isn't the issue. It just feels dirty in the restaurant. The menus and the tables are sticky. I've been here a few times, always giving it another chance because it's closest to where I live. But I won't be going back again. The waitstaff has never been good and the last time I was there I waited for the only waitress there to finish flirting with a table of 3 for ten minutes so I could get my bill. Apparently I wasn't the only one because someone was more vocal than me and just spoke up that he wanted his bill. 

In conclusion the food is good. The service is bad. The atmosphere is gross and feels unclean. I'd say if you want to take out that's your best bet."}
{"text":"The food here is always great and not to mention the service is great! Their southwest chicken flatbread is TDF, love the French fries and ask for a side of spicy gar par sauce, there's so many sauces that come with the wings so honestly it depends of your preference"}
{"text":"I have lived in the area for about 2 years, never has Wild Wings come up as a place to eat... I came here for the first time, just this past weekend... And i saw for myself why.

I go my order to go, so I saw seated at the bar while I wait - the servers were getting drinks ready right in front of me. 

One server had three drinks to carry... and didnt take a tray for some reason and decided that  carrying two - against her body was a great idea, not against her shirt, but right against her cleavage. Both drinks, just bam against her bare skin and cleavage - Eww! 

Same server, was playing with the straws with her hands just playing with all the straws while waiting for her drink to fill up - and then when the drink she was filling up was full she just zoned out and started playing with the straw in the glass - holding the part that you're to put in your mouth - just staring at the glass and playing with the tip of the straw - snapped out of it and handed it to the customer.. So they dont use tongs to get you a straw, they just use their hands which have touched... who knows... and they touch all the straws when bored.

The best part was three Bartenders and two customers to open a can of pineapple juice. 

Im sorry but I will not be recommending this place unless it improves, But I will not be returning to find out."}
{"text":"After weeks of hearing friends gloat about their visit to Wild Wing, I got it in my head that we needed a treat. I used to love Wild Wing...but this experience sucked! The restaurant itself was small, dark and dank. The loud, drunk construction workers at the bar made me very happy this was a take out order. 
   To make a long story short....our little (expensive) treat ranged from too greasy to too dry. From flavorless, to too intense. No in-between, yummy goodness. Yuck. It will be a long while before I crave this place again."}
{"text":"Wings r not very wild they are very dry.. I ordered salt and pepper and it is too salty"}
{"text":"As per the review below I too experienced one of the worst services at this Wild Wing establishment and cannot believe that after almost a year, an important area such as customer service has yet to be corrected at this place. A party of 4; we went in on a UFC night, at approx. 7pm (the fights would not begin until 10pm). We sat upstairs where there was 1 bartender and 2 waitresses. There was about 4 tables with people. We placed our order, 4 orders of chicken wings and a deep fried pickle appetizer. The deep fried pickle came out in reasonable time. The wings however took approximately an hour to receive our wings. One of the dishes was cold but we were unable to tell the waitress because she never returned to our table. After eating and waiting another 30 mins for her to return so we could get our bill, we had to go up to the bar to request our bill. In my view this staff was too busy preparing for a UFC event instead of taking care of their customers. Such a disappointment and I do not recommend this place to anyone, nor will I be returning."}
{"text":"I had never heard of this place before and now wish I never had.

I went to use the washroom before my group ordered. The floor was covered in piss and had flies everywhere. Classy.

The wings were way too expensive for what we got. Tiny little baby wings with hardly any meat.

The waitress was way too pushy about orders and by the end felt like she was just a bother.

Avoid this place."}
{"text":"Bad service. 

I seated myself at at the bar and had to go get my own menu. I ordered deep fried dill pickles and a single order of wings. 20 minutes later, the food comes out in a takeout container, but didn't ask for takeout (did they want me to leave?!). Another 15 minutes later wings come out again, but deep fried dill pickles are nowhere to be seen. 20 minutes to transfer a wrong takeout order to an eat in order?

While waiting, I saw at least three other people get the wrong order. I was not offered drink refills or asked how my meal was. It was not very busy. 

Wings were tasty, but very small. I don't know what kind of baby chickens they get them from. 

Reluctant to return."}
{"text":"I go their every tuesday and order 2 lbs chicken wings with fries and drink. Everything comes under $20. One of my all time favourite is spicy gar par. They are open after midnight for a late night snack."}
{"text":"Worst wild wings I've ever been to. I came here when they first opened and service was horrible. An order of wings and fries took about 50 minutes to arrive. I assumed  things were bad because they just opened and had to get the proper setup and training. 

Fast forward about half a year and I return. Still horrible. We waited for half an hour for fries and received our wings an hour later. Sure, I don't kind waiting for food if it has to be cooked and get to me properly done, but the wings were warm as if they'd been sitting on a counter for quite some time. 

Seriously bad location and its too bad because all the other wild wings I've been to are great. I live close by to this one and was so excited about it when it just opened. I've honestly tried it 6 times since opening and 5 were as bad as I stated, not even close to exaggerating. I only went because of convenience or friend requests  but it is always a let down. 

This location needs to get its act together. It is a joke how bad it is. It's not like they are busy and can't make our items in time. I come in with 3-4 other tables and it takes an hour before I get my wings."}
{"text":"My husband and I were here this evening.   Normally we go in with the expectation that it's a wing joint and we are getting what we pay for.
Tonight we certainly didn't get our money's worth.
Waiting 25 mins just to get drinks, wings and fries came another 30 mins after that.  The restaurant was half full and there seemed to be 3 waitresses working.
 Waitress never checked on us and we needed to ask twice for drink refills.  
When the bill came the server came and picked up our cash payment.  Coming back a few mins later asking if we wanted change.  ( bill was just over $60 and we have given $80 in cash)  We told her yes and waited another 15 mins for change. 
Overall we were there for an hour and half.  If our food wasn't as good as it was we would have left way sooner!
Overall- service sucks...normally not this bad.  Food was good though.  Wings are always delicious."}
{"text":"Wings were tiny and sub par to other wild wings. Tuesday wings \"deal\" is disappointing. 1,5lb for 10.99 with a 3$ drink purchase. One flavour only. I have had much better experience with St. Louis wings. For the same price, you can get four instead of two flavours , fries and dip included. 

I would not recommend this to anyone. Well we were the only people on a Tuesday evening. Go figure."}
{"text":"So... I should have known after my friend said that this place was \"grimey\" but i like wings and this place was close so i ignored him. I shouldn't have. Let's see what happened. 1. My plate was broken. 2. He found a hair in his wings. 3. There was lemon residue in my water and I didn't even have a lemon in my water. 
So I told the waitress about the dirty used cup and she was oh that is gross. If that's not a sign... I don't know what is. 
So she goes to see what she can do. Then she comes back with the bill and took 2 beers off the menu. Funny thing is... I HAD THE DIRTY GLASS AND I DIDNT EVEN HAVE A BEER. 
Needless to say... Just don't come here. Drive further. It's worth the gas money."}
{"text":"You must have read the review below which mentioned that the name has changed - the logo is deceptive as it looks like Wild Wing but it is Wing Hub.

We went there last Wednesday at 9 pm with my wife and daughter and despite being a game day - there was no one in there! Not a single soul besides the lady (not sure if she is the owner or the manager there) and a guy to make your wings (looks like he is still at school and this is part time job - no offence to that). Dead empty for a wing and bar place - that should have been a sign to stay away and I didnt take heed - my regrets.

We ordered two different types of wings (20 each) - Honey Garlic and a ranchy one - and it was served after a 30 minute wait despite no other customers to serve. Believe me, the worst wings I have ever had in my life. I have been to a few good places that serve wings - All Stars, Kelseys. Wing Machine, the actual Wild Wings, Real Sports - this has to be the worst. They reheated the wings and put them on our table. The wings were hard as rock! I usually eat around 20 wings and I couldnt eat more than 6 - the wings were hard and tasteless. I decided to order some onion rings and sweet potato fries to compensate for it and they were equally bad. When we left the table, we had around 25 odd wings left over and we didnt want to take them home.

We complained about it to the lady (owner or manager) and she apologized (I guess for the heck of it). She said she would give me a 5% discount - for what? We ended up spending $50 for wings which we didnt eat.

So please stay away from this place - this isnt Wild Wing - this is knockoff Wild Wing going by the name of Wing Hub.

I lost my appetite that night and my money too!"}
{"text":"WORST WILD WING EVER. Steer clear. Manager has no clue about customer experience.  Actually tried to argue with me about the time I arrived to the restaurant (we waited 30 minutes for our appetizers), on top of that the calamari was the worst thing I've ever tasted. No napkins, side plates or cutlery on the table plus my 5 year old complained of it being \"too sticky\". He's 5!! Waitress interrupted me while i was complaining about lack of items, to tell they \"ran out of side plates\"?!. After all of this the manager still charged me for the calamari, when I opted to leave and cancel dinner. Poo on a stick covered in sugar would be better than that experience. Opt to starve...do not eat here."}
{"text":"This \"restaurant\" is a joke. I wouldn't go back there if they offered free wings and beer. We came here for an early dinner, just my husband, 2 year old daughter, and me.  The restaurant was empty, 2 other tables of 2 or 3 people, besides us when we entered and one more couple came in about 15 minutes after us. 

For starters, when we entered, we were simply told, sit wherever you want. This to me just shows how little the employees cared, especially when it clearly wasn't busy. We had one waitress, who seemed to be the only one working, bypass our table several times, despite us making eye contact with her. We were about to leave after we waited for 15 minutes without even a drink order being put in, but fortunately for them, and unfortunately for us, my daughter had to use the bathroom, so we decided if after that no one had come by, then we would leave.  When we finally got to put in our drink order, I asked for chocolate milk for my daughter and the waitress looked at me like I was crazy and said they didn't have chocolate milk, so I asked for plain milk and she said they didn't have any milk. I pointed to the drink section where they offered drink selections and showed her the menu said they did. She replied that she was new and didn't know the menu yet. Seriously? Who let her start waiting tables without knowing the menu??

While we were waiting for our drinks the aforementioned couple came in and they managed to put in their drink order AND their food order BEFORE we even received our drinks. Not high on my list of restaurant cardinal sins, but my husband was angry. I assume they just knew what they wanted when she took their drink order.

During our 30 minute wait to receive our very simple, straight from the menu, no special request dinners, we were assaulted by rap music littered with the \"f\" word, the \"n\" word, and several other choice curse words.  We were appalled. Even if we didn't have a young child, we still wouldn't have expected to hear that kind of music in a restaurant, of any kind. And we're not \"old\" at 31 years old each. I was kind of hoping while the first song played that perhaps it was just a song that slipped in on someone's playlist, but by the 3rd song and after the abrupt end to an R&B type song back to the curse word riddled rap, it became obvious someone was playing it intentionally.

Our food was mediocre. Definitely not wings to write home about, other than to say this restaurant was horrible. We never received the carrots and celery listed on the menu as coming with the wings and my husband requested ranch dressing which took two requests to receive.

All in all, there is no way I would come back to this restaurant. The food wasn't great, the service was terrible, and the environment was deplorable. Find somewhere else in Toronto for wings. This isn't the place."}
{"text":"I only review when things are good or bad. If its middle of the road, I don't waste my time. 

The Good - $9.99 Cdn pitchers on Saturday 

The Bad - hands down the worst chain pub food I've ever had. Im not going to go into details, if you can imagine what \"chain\" pub food is, this is it to a T. 

I'd be willing to guess that within 12 months of Oct 5th 2013 this location will no longer  be in business. 

I knew better before going in, unfortunately it was 8pm the LCBO was closing and I needed to eat before drinking."}
{"text":"Don't know why I've heard bad things cuz his place is awesome. Great wings. Cold pints. They need more weekly deals to attract more but other then that the wings were really good. Keep it up. Can I suggest .60 wings or pint and pound for 15?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?"}
{"text":"This rating is not to do with the food, but rather with my overall experience at this particular Wild Wing.  I'be been a fan of Wild Wing for years. 

To my understanding, this store used to be a Wild Wing, went independant (as Let's Wing it) and back to a Wild Wing all in a matter of a year or so. I'm not sure if it's the same staff that work at both places, but they're making a mockery of the franchise at this location. Here's the list of reasons why I feel this one-star rating is justified:

1. My girlfriend and I went there to watch a UFC event.  We got there early, got good seats, ordered food.  Then the manager-on-duty started telling us we didn't pay last time we came.  He tells me that he had been asking us for $10 per person to stay and watch the fight, we were ignoring him and that we also never paid last time we came.  This was our first time there for a UFC event.  We also had to pay ahead for this fee, it could not be added to the bill.  Since I was paying debit, I got hit with 2 service charges as a result.  Not a big deal in itself, but it left me with a sour taste in my mouth.

2. Management needs to bring in more than 1-2 servers for rush hour.  There are about 20-25 tables in there, it's obviously too much for 1-2 people to handle.  As a result, service suffers for everyone, which I'm sure also affects those poor servers' tips.  I personally don't blame the servers for this in any way; they're not responsible for scheduling.  If they were, I'm sure they would know better than to give 10-15 tables to a single server and expect sit-down restaurant service. It's one thing if this was happening on a weekday when they expect not to be busy, but during dinner rush on a Friday night? Not acceptable.

3. The restaurant was also offering delivery through just-eat.ca.  We live 3 blocks from the restaurant, but sometimes we prefer ordering in.  The restaurant refused our orders half the time, giving reasons like \"Busy in restaurant\" or \"you're too far\".  I'm 8 minute walk, 2 minute drive from the restaurant. Also, if it's too busy in the restaurant, wouldn't you actually WANT me to order out? It's already bad enough that there aren't enough servers to assist all the tables in a timely manner, I'm ordering so I won't put any more stress on the servers, but then the store just refuses to send out the order? Add to this the fact that the food would often arrive late and cold, the drivers didn't seem to have any hot food bags in their car, and drivers would get mad if we paid by credit card and tipped online, actually ASKING for a cash tip as well.  Luckily, they were pulled from just-eat, so they no longer deliver.

I've been to several other Wild Wing locations in Markham, Scarborough and Toronto, I've always loved the atmosphere and service.  If my first experience was going to this location and getting the service they provided, I would have written off this franchise as a whole.  I worry that many other people have done so already.

If I had to rate the food itself, I would give this place 4 out of 5.  I would just rather spend my money elsewhere, as the consistant bad service makes this a place to avoid."}
{"text":"I, sadly, had a terrible experience at this establishment. I ordered a beer, and a pound of Angels on the Moon flavoured chicken wings (one of my favourites). I found a HAIR in my food just two wings in. I told the waitress. She sent the order back and brought out another order of the same flavour of wings. I was a bit skeptical to give it a try, especially as there was a lot of sauce on the wings. But I, being an optimistic person, convinced myself that it should be fine. Two wings in and I found another hair of the same kind!!! It was so gross. I told the waitress and she took it back. I told her I was done, and I didn't want anything more. When it was time to get the bill she charged me full price. I explained that I should receive some kind of discount (I should have said \"I'm not paying for this!) and, after speaking with the manager, they gave me 15 percent off...

This was a terrible experience for me, and it was a terrible way of handing a situation. It leaves me feeling disgusted every time I think about wings.  

I will add that my boyfriend ordered chicken fingers with fries and he said it was \"okay\". 

I will never go to this establishment again."}
{"text":"This is by far one of the best wild wings location I have been too. The staff at the front who helped us with out take out order was beyond nice. she helped us choose our flavours and even offered us samples. and on top of all of that, she offered us water while we waited for our order.. now who does that? super nice.  As for our order, we were pleased with how the wings were cooked - well done and crispy just the way we like it..and we asked for extra spicy for all 3 of our flavours and that's what we got.. I can still feel the burn.. haha.. the only reason I gave it a 4 is because we upgraded our fries to a poutine and both of our poutine portions were ridiculously small - they definitely cheaped out there ..and also the gravy and fries stuck to the paper parchment beneath so basically I was tearing my fries away from the paper as I was eating to make sure I wasn't consuming any paper! That is not cool and needs to be fixed!"}
{"text":"Came on Saturday night this place was only only 1/5 seated. Waited for 10 min didn't even get the menu."}
{"text":"My friends and I went to this specific location to watch a non main event UFC match, some just wanted to come and hang out, and got a horrible experience in return. 15 minutes into the event, we were told that we each had to spend a minimum amount of $20 each in order for us to stay during the event. Some of us already ordered our beers and food, but he wasn't willing to wave this policy for our group.

We had a chat with the boss and asked if this was a Wild Wings policy or just a policy for that specific franchise. It turns out it was only for that franchise and it ruined a great get together among friends. We won't be going back there just because of this mishap."}
{"text":"We ordered take-out from this location. As usual, the wings were pretty good! Overall however, the portions were small. The dips that came with the wings literally only had half a teaspoon in the cup. The Apple Fuji Chicken Salad was more like the size of an appetizer and had a lot more onions than necessary."}
{"text":"This Wild Wing location is where you can watch the UFC on a few 46\" TVs, conveniently mounted 12 feet into the air, showing a standard definition broadcast squashed into an incorrect aspect ratio. 

Burned garbage bits of calamari and then some McCain fries provided the assault on our remaining senses.

Nothing in this review is an exaggeration. I even left out the fact that if you lean on the corner of the tables, they tip. The legs need to be rotated 45 degrees to prevent this."}
{"text":"Sucks to be the owner of this place. Sorry whoever you are!! 

So the staff here are completely rude!! Food isn't up to par either. This review is based on 4 visits not just one!!

Too bad, I love wild wings but won't eat here ever again."}
{"text":"I wrote a bad review for their Hwy 27 location but this one rocks. I got a pickup order of Bonnie and Clyde and Buckin Bronco wings and they were fast and nice when I got there. The wings were sauced perfectly and very tender and tasty (as well as good cold the next day for the ones I didn't finish).  The Bronco wings were a bit spicier than the other lamented location but still soo good. I will be coming back here"}
{"text":"Wings taste ok. Fries are really delicious. The sauce is amazing. We ordered the 1/2 pound wings and that was filling for 3 people"}
{"text":"Best wings place in my opinion
Love the variety of flavours they have
Very good service from the asian girl that works there
They have very good specials everyday too, i usually get the pint and wings special or the 2 appetizers for 1"}
{"text":"The whole vibe of the place is pretty cheap. You've got over-salted food and country hicks at the bar yelling and screaming unnecessarily. It's White Trash City, that's for sure. The servers also just don't seem to give a damn. By far the worst Wild Wing in Toronto."}
{"text":"Place was dead on Sunday night.. The venue is a little old can definitely use a reno... Got the Gar par wings with fries combinations.... The wings were okay...The sauce wasn't enuf.. We're kinda dry... The fries weren't well done.. Just tasted like boiled potatoes...service was good but  Would i come back... Naa I don't think so...."}
{"text":"I'm not a regular here but have been 5-7 times since it opened. 

Service is average but could be slow on busy days (not many busy days). Food is your average wings. Nothing to rave about."}
{"text":"I have been to more wing joints than I care to mention.  This WW location started with promise with the eager owners running the show.  Wings were good, however, with staffing problems.  

They brought in another manager to help bolster the atmosphere and business.  This did not happen.  On my last visit, my wee son and I ordered apple juice and a beer with nuggets and wings to go.  The place was empty, literally, just the manager.  The beer tasted off, but apparently the apple juice was \"appley\".  When I brought the food home, my son eagerly ate his nuggets: dry, tasteless, and one had a big old bone in it.  I was awfully glad my 4 year old didn't choke on the bone.  I then dug into wings: NO breading, NO sauce (except for a squirt in the corner of the box) and looked like a starved, hairless rat.  I was too much to \"bare\", I called them out and refused reparations.  Myself and associates will not be returning. 

It felt like the manager was trying to pull one over on the \"to-go\" guy.  Surprise, you'll be looking for work in the near future.

Inexcusable."}
{"text":"The wings are great and the menu has a lot of options for those that don't love the well-sauced delicious wings of chickens that weren't using them anyway so why not eat them? Deep-fried pickle-dog? Check. They probably even have salads. 

Also, at this location there are two servers that are so friendly and helpful that they are my favourite wait staff in the city. They are always great to me and also were really nice to my mom and dad when I brought them along."}
{"text":"great food! i had the breaded wings with hot sauce.it was really good.a clean place and the staff were very friendly."}
{"text":"i visited wild wings because puck n wings is now closed.

the tuesday deal is great.

wings were medium sized (12 in 1.5lbs) and crispy, and come in a huge variety of flavours
service was quite good
highly recommended"}
{"text":"We waited 50 minutes to have our food brought to the table. Everything is deep fried so I don't know why it took so long. The tables were very sticky. I asked for the waitress to wipe them down and she said they were sticky because of the varnish on the table. Trust me, it wasn't the varnish as we saw old food on the table. Eeew."}
{"text":"Being so focused on the task at hand I didn't notice that the giant glowing plastic coconut tree at the entrance was back, and that Let's Wing It was no more. In its place: Wild Wing; a back-to-kitschy and back-to-wing-focused joint.

Okay, I'm done copying Vivek's review so I can start on my own. Yes, Wild Wing is back. No, the place has not really changed.

My dinner companion and I wandered in when we were walking by and only had 45 minutes until a movie up at Varsity started. We were the only people in the entire restaurant. The wings and beer came quickly, but weren't anything special. The whole place (servers, d√©cor, the food) all seem kind've sad.

The wings aren't horrible, but there is something about the place that makes me feel depressed and regret going there.

:o("}
{"text":"Popped in here after watching the cavalcade of lights in Nathan Phillis square.  Was hoping for a quick snack and chill while warming up.  There was lots of space when we arrived but only 2 servers for the whole place.  Shortly after a group of drunk out of towners came in and ordered more beer.  I don't know why they would have been served as they were clearly intoxicated already.   They promptly spilled half a pitcher of beer all over the table beside them. There was no one to clean it up so it just sat there for awhile, while a line up formed at the door.  The drunk group proceeded to put the chicken bone bucket on their heads and and do squats in the middle of the restaurant to see if they could bust their pants.  While very entertaining it wasn't how I wanted to spend my evening.   We watched the last part of the raptors game, finished our wings and drinks and got out of there quickly after that."}
{"text":"Really bad service - none of the waitress seemed to care to do their job (talking on the phone, sitting up on the bar, wearing inappropriate clothing...), not friendly, just overall very unpleasant

the guy who seemed to be the owner was walking in and out with take out to the kitchen and didnt seem bothered about the staff 

wings were light drizzelled with sauce, not tossed & coated 

I have been here a couple of times and I cannot say one positive thing about this place, other wild wings are great but this location is horrendous - food & service here just absolutely suck and talking with other locals about this place I know I'm not the only one that thinks so."}
{"text":"Poor service.  We finished our drinks and waiting over an hour before being served.  She spoke with her Chinese friends and served them before us.  Confronted service staff and they shouted at us.  Very poor service.  Do not recommend."}
{"text":"This place is a joke. Waited one hour after my designated pickup time. It was during the super bowl but still. Mass confusion and no one knows what's going on."}
{"text":"I went there on a Sunday in July around 6pm.  I was surprised that only 3 tables with customers in total of 7 people.  The waitress's face was bad and no smiling. She doesn't feel like to serve us.  The wings were bad.  Will never come back."}
{"text":"VERY BAD SERVICE
Me and my girlfriend went to this place about more a year ago.  We ordered a small pitcher of beer, but the waitress placed a wrong with a large pitcher, however we didn't realized until we drank one third of it.  So we asked the waitress if she took the wrong order, she said sorry to us that she though we want a large pitcher.  Anyhow no way for me and my gf finish it.  So, I told her that I don't pay the price of the large pitcher.  Make it short, she talk to her manager and the manager said cannot adjust the bill and said that we already drank one third of if. I was pissed and told the waitress that I am not going to pay it.  End up the manager took our beer away and didn't say anything.  Then the waitress came to us and said that the bill already adjusted.  But our beer was gonna and we didn't even finish the amount of a small pitcher of beer.  It was their fault and they took the rest of beer away.  What kind of service is this?  They don't know how to run a service business in Canada.  Will never go back again.  I ended up giving them 2 cents of tips."}
{"text":"Hubby loves wings, so in an effort to grab something quick to eat last night, this was his choice.  I personally do not love wings, but I figured there'd be a few options on the menu to suit me, and there were.  So that wasn't the real issue.  

We ordered one order of regular wings, and one of boneless, as well as a nachos and cheese, and an order of potato skins.  The nachos and cheese were soooo disappointing.... we were digging for cheese, and barely found any.  The potato skins were so-so.  The wings were pretty good as far as wings go, but hubby says they've been better previously.

Upon entering the place, I was immediately turned off by the smell.  It was sort of a musty, wing-sauce, dish-soap sort of smell.    Just stale.    The decor is quasi-saloon like, but not done so elaborately that it feels that way.   And the dim lighting I guess is part of that saloon feel, but really just felt sort of dull and dreary.  

The server was friendly, so points there.

But overall, the experience just left me feeling sort of \"meh\"."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I placed two orders for classic wings. We got home to find out that they were breaded, which neither of us can eat. There was no mention of beaded when we placed our order in store, and no where on the receipt did it say breaded (I checked when we were waiting in store). The fries were also gross and soggy.

When we called the store they were unwilling to do anything about it. $30 wasted. I'd avoid this place if you're looking for wings."}
{"text":"We'e been going here for the past 2 years or so and the service has just gone downhill. The wings are tiny and you get 10 of them for $10.99. Drinks are overpriced and they charge $1 if you order an extra ranch dip with your wings... you know the one that comes in a little cup like container and probably costs them $0.05. I wouldn't recommend this location to anyone, I am puzzled as to how they are still in business."}
{"text":"What made me happy: as a single women entering a sports/wing bar, I felt welcomed and comfy. Tuesday wing deal. Wings are great and plenty. Atmosphere. Unexpected free wifi

What made me unhappy.  Nothing. Please note nude wings come seasoned and are not bare nude per se."}
{"text":"Service was awful.  I've got a few times, and each time it takes a while to get seated, a while to get an order and a while to pay the bill. They've changed waitresses on us a few times, made mistakes on bills, left us hanging, etc. We once were made to pay while we were eating because the waitress' shift was ending... 

The menu and deals seem to change every time I go (i.e. every few months) and I've tried ordering items on the menu that the stores didn't have. Deals on the website didn't apply to this location either.

The wings are good, and if you can bypass the horrible service, you can have a good meal. They've got other items besides wings that are good too. There's dozens of flavours, but I don't see a point - you can only order one flavour per 20 wings. If you're not going on a half-price day, expect to pay a dollar per wing, which is too much imo.

Better to go to Kelsey's, which is cheaper on Thursdays, and they allow you to get two flavours."}
{"text":"This was the worst customer service I ever had. The so-called manager has absolutely no managerial skills. She increases conflict rather than diffusing it and she is stubborn, ignorant and disrespctful. I told her that the dip tasted bad and she accused me of making that up just so I get out of paying for it! She refused to take it off the bill because that would mean she would have to take her lazy ass back to the cash register to reprint another. She tried in no way to accomodate or problem solve the situation. When I asked to speak with the manager she claimed that she was the manager! I still don't believe that she is because of how stupid and ignorant she acted.  She has no idea how to build customer loyalty. I also interacted with the hostess as much as I didn't want to but she became the link between me and the waitress since the waitress never checked on me.  The hostess was so miserable with arms folded and leaning on her little podium the whole time. But I could understand why she was so miserable with having that rude stubborn ignorant stupid manager. It is not worth going to this dump. On a Friday night they were showing and playing  Bring it On. I guess a movie about dumbass cheerleaders really reflects the personality of the staff."}
{"text":"Sometimes, it's not the food but the company.

This always seems to win out on the \"which bar to go meet up?\" place.

I generally like this place because it's in the north and close to home.  It's in the middle of nowhere and not that busy.  The service is always nice and quick.

The food is medicore bar food so don't expect to be wow'ed... and there's not enough TV is you like your food with sports.  

I do like that there's sufficient parking, roomy bench seats, and the tables are set far apart so you can be a little rowdy if you want.  

I'd recommend this place if you want a beer with some wings but don't come with high expectations of the food.  Oh, and it is quite expensive for wings and beer.

Cheers."}
{"text":"I've been to this location twice now. Once about 8 months ago and again yesterday. I feel that both times were pretty identical experiences. However, the last time we were there we had to pay for fries separately and they now come with a pound of wings so that's a bonus.


The wings were okay. I did really enjoy the Jerk spices they used on whatever I chose (the name is now escaping me but it was basically just bbq and jerk). We had requested that fries really be well cooked to the point of being crispy and they came out the exact opposite - not a huge deal, but why did we bother asking. We did not have to wait long for our meal.

Another thing I noticed, there was maybe three customers in at the time, and one gentleman had to get up TWICE and walk over to the bar to ask for another beer. I chuckled. When it came time for me to need a refill of my own, the server stood motionless behind the bar, so I ended up having to do the same thing and go up to the bar. I didn't realize it was self serve?

They did put the blue jays game on all their tvs and changed their music to the live audio of the game so that was appreciated since it seemed everyone ( all 3 tables) was interested. 

All in all, if you want a decently priced joint to watch a game and eat some wings it's not a bad place, but if you want wings AND beer you may want to just hit your local pub"}
{"text":"DO NOT GO ON A TUESDAY
Its was a Tuesday (Nov 22, 2016). We simply walked in to this location expecting to enjoy a Tuesday special. After a long 25 minutes wait cramped at the entrance our group of 9 finally got a seat. Two 4 seater table side by side. It took the server about 10 minutes to come around and attend to us. At this point we all were starving and ready to order but our server insisted she gets us our drinks first. Being polite we simply ordered our beverage. After another long 10-15 minute wait she returned with our beverage ready to take our order. At this point we learnt that wild wings Tuesday special is not really competitive. In order to enjoy a Tuesday special we have to order 1 drink for each half pound wings we order, the wings does not come with any sides (No fries, NO celery NOT EVEN DIP!!!) so naturally after this long wait we caved in and had our orders placed. Our server rudely mentioned that she would not be able to split between people who ordered a pitcher and also mentioned there would be forced gratuity on the bill. 

I assure you the one pound wings I ordered did not weigh one pound (8 pieces). Since I didn't want to be forced to order another drink, I didn't bother asking for another pound. Our long table only had one paper towel roll which we had to keep passing around inconveniently. Our disposable bucket was given after we were done our meals. So my one pound wings (with no fries, no celery and NO DIP!!) cost me $13.23 on a TUESDAY! 

We experienced a terrible service followed by a terrible meal and we all were left unsatisfied and forced to pay gratuity. We all needed a second dinner. NEVER COMING BACK."}
{"text":"What happened to the wings at this place! utterly the worst wings we ever had there.....must of changed the supplier for wings or pissed the suppliers off as I dont know if I was eating pigeon wings.....wings used to be plump and crispy ( i think breaded as well).....man what a waste of money .....sorry wild wings, will not be going back"}
{"text":"Don't even bother. Really poor quality - wings were over breaded with almost no sauce on them, most pathetic side of fries I've ever seems (10-15 fries!!!?) and literally a single carrot and piece of celery as the \"side of vegetables and dip.\" Clearly the kitchen staff is being told to skimp out by the owners. Huge disappointment."}
{"text":"The good:
The variety of flavors is pretty unparalleled. 
Wings are pretty good (I usually get the boneless variety). 
Staff is quite friendly.
Lots of TVs for sports fans.

The bad: 
Usually empty and somewhat depressing. You'll often see \"regulars\" at the bar, depressingly sipping beer at noon. 
Service is usually slow.
Pool table is useless with the amount of space afforded to players."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Not a place to watch sports. 

Went here for my birthday with my wife and daughter. 
Once we got seated, the server introduced herself. Name started with a V. Took our drink orders (was a pint and wings during leaf games special). Then left. 

She came back with drinks to take our wing orders and I had to ask for a kids menu. The two foot tall person wasn't clue enough to even ask if we needed one. 

Finally made our orders. The app came. Then the kids meal. Then eventually our wings came. Not all together.

And that was the last we saw of her. 

Didn't come by to see how the meal was, if everything was ok etc.

About 15 minutes after I finished my pint, a different server came and snatched my glass off the table, no refill offer, not even an \"excuse me\" as her arm shot past my face. 

Another 15 minutes pass, still no one stopping by. She wasn't on break, she was serving other tables the entire time, multiple times. 

Had to go to the bar to request the bill and take out box. 

Too top it off. Leafs game day special on pint and wings. At other bars who promote game day events, that game is on regardless of what else is on. You can see and hear the game. With this promotion, no Leafs game on any of the tvs and terrible music on overhead. Way to live up to your promotion. 

Will not go back. Go the extra 2km to STC area and go to All Stars or St. Louis for wings."}
{"text":"Great staff, and great food! You can tell that the servers like their jobs, and they take pride in making sure you get what you order. They explain everything to you about the menu (101 flavours, wings are breaded, naked or boneless, comes with a side and a dip). Overall my experience was great, just remember when you go to wild wing, you are eating fried foods that are tasty, and provide a quick service!"}
{"text":"Went to this location a couple of times, only giving it one star because of the variety of chicken wings' flavours that the restaurant chain offers.  However, customer service at this location is terrible.  Tonight we got there at 715pm, the restaurant was 1/3 full and maybe 3 waitresses there.  We a family of 4 were greeted by a girl at the bar and she directed us to sit at a table by the window.  The chair space was pretty tight on one end and so I let my younger daughter sat at the tighter spot.  As I was helping her to take off her jacket, a waitress came near us with a beer for a guy behind our table but she had no sense whatsoever stepped in and stood between me and my daughter because my chair was tucked in.  I was standing behind her the whole time waiting to sit down with my daughter but she was chatting or taking orders for this guy or father of a family of 6.  I felt annoyed already and my husband suggested to change table.  So I had to go and asked the same girl who greeted us to see if we could sit at another table that was available.  She said no because they were reserved.  The restaurant was only 1/3 full ok!  Well fine, then we saw someone just left and asked if we could sit there next.  She said gave her a few minutes to clean up.  So we went back to the entrance and waited.  We saw her cleaning another table but not the one we just asked.  Does it make sense??? She could have cleaned ours first because there were no other customer waiting to be seated.  She finally cleaned out most of the stuff on the table for us but then went to talk to the clueless waitress.  Afterwards, she went into the kitchen and brought some menus back to the front but no intention to keep cleaning the table we were waiting for.  As we were standing, watching their behaviours and waiting, my husband said maybe she asked the clueless waitress to clean the rest.  But the clueless waitress was taking orders at a table so that means we had to wait longer and until she's done.  At that moment, I was not impressed and so we left for another restaurant.  Too bad so sad with this kind of customer service.  We'll not go back for the dining room if these girls still work there.  Also noticed the waitresses like to chat with guys who ordered a beer or a pint.  Maybe trying to get more tips."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been going to this location for a few years now regularly. We do like going here because of the spicy wings but I do have a few complaints, it seems like they either keep changing the recipe or the chef because every time we go there I order the exact same thing but the wing sauce tastes different, it's either nice and hot the way I like or tasteless and no heat. Also one time we went in there they said that Rickards red was no longer on the menu and the broccoli cheese poppers were discontinued so that was upsetting because we ordered that every time. We didn't go back for a while then decided to give it another chance and the Rickards red and broccoli cheese poppers were back and the wings tasted the same again. I'm not sure why they keep changing things around."}
{"text":"DON'T GO HERE IF YOU ARE ON A DIET!!!!

Yea no kidding. This chain is awesome to come in grab a pint and a pound of wings any flavour you need. The staff is underworked, so attentive, what else is there to know;

Leave your Dietitian at the door."}
{"text":"Last night i visited the Wild Wing on the Queensway and had an amazing experience!!! The servers were so friendly and helpful in choosing wing flavors because they have 100+ flavors!!!! Yummmmmm the wings were delicious and the traditional wings are of good size too! My family and I really enjoyed the visit. Thank You Wild Wing we will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Horrible experience, waited 15 min at the door while restaurant was empty, another 20 min at the table with the waitress passing by not even acknowledging we are even sitting there, I would give a minus if that was an option,horrible experience never again"}
{"text":"Came here on a Tuesday for the wing special which was a pound and a half for the price of one pound ($12.99) with the purchase of any beverage. It came with your choice of single sauced chicken wings (breaded/unbreaded/boneless), fries, a dipping sauce (blue cheese, ranch, sourcream, dill), celery and carrot sticks. 

I ordered the blue moonshine which was a mix of blue cheese and bbq sauce. My brother got the country girl which came dressed with their my thai sauce and pineapple. Honestly, the food took a really long time to come out but we both agreed that it tasted it pretty good compared to other well known chicken wing places. 

Our server was very friendly and helpful who did periodically check up on us but never offered us any water to start. Instead we just got the drink we ordered for the special which was a ginger ale ($2.99/unlimited).

You can definitely tell that this specific restaurant no longer anticipates for Tuesday wing eaters as the place is practically empty. The whole establishment just felt very run down and slow.

Overall, I didn't have a horrible experience here but I also don't see myself coming back either."}
{"text":"I like wild wing for the most part. They have a tonnnnn of wings to choose from in varying degrees of heat, normally I go for whiskey girl, gar par, or something along those lines. 
The crunch on the outside of the wing is superb although sometimes there can be too much dressing on the outside of the wings. 
The \"pickled willies\" here are some of the best ever I don't ever go and not order them. 
As the guy before me said the dill sauce is freaking great. 
Extra bonus if you go in the afternoon, apps are 1/2 price! 
I've had hit and miss waitresses here. This location is new so a lot of the wait staff is too. Most can't find pens, or hover, one told us that after 2 drinks we were cut off.... However the wild wing in stouffville had a lovely waitress cute as a button. 
If you love wings try it out."}

Perhaps they are low on staff but the one that are there are not very efficient in my opinion.
Tables don't get cleaned until they have to sit someone. I got seated at a dirty table and no one came back to clean for over 10 min.

Seem like there are a dozen in the back chatting around and no one on the floor to serve the customers.

My third time here ... And maybe the last"}
{"text":"Last friday, a group of friends and I, went to Wild Wings at the McCowan and Finch location where we had an extremely rude and unprofessional waitress. 

The food was okay, no complaints. The waitress doubled as the bartender and didn't check up on us. The waitress, Daria, spent most of her time at the bar talking with whoever was seated there. She furthermore spent the rest of her time going outside for smoke breaks every 15 minutes or so with whoever was seated at the bar.

We had to get her attention multiple times to get a takeout box. It is obvious that you need a bag along with the takeout box, but she quickly left after she gave the box. We had to call her again and ask for a bag and wet napkins. \"How many?\" She asked. There was four of us there. It is common sense to bring 4 napkins.

As we got our receipt and paid our bills. She looked at the bills, and made an eye roll after looking at her tips. As we prepared to leave, she told us that tips had to be at least 15% or above. She then threw the last receipt on the table, then stormed off. As customers, it is our decision how much to tip. Furthermore, it is extremely rude and unprofessional of a staff to tell customers how much we should tip. We have always tipped above 15% on past occasions that we've been there. She was tipped based on her service. 

We have been at this location multiple times, and this is the first time we've encountered such a horrible server. For the future Daria, be more respectful, professional, and friendly towards your customers. You'll be sure to get tips beyond the minimum 15% if you had a more professional, customer-friendly attitude.

Steve, if you're reading this, please train your staff on common courtesy. 

Sincerely, 
- A frustrated, loyal, customer."}
{"text":"Service is friendly like any other sports bar.  The food on the other hand was so so.  The wings tasted a little off and the size of the wings are really small.  The price is average for a pound of wings.  Place is a bit old and wrecked."}

- tiny place, about 12-15 tiny tables, 2 people per table."}

Negatives: 
- Had to wait about 30 min to get our wings. Friday night, place was pretty deserted
- Had to remind for the drinks 5 min after we got the food
- Peppercorn ranch and Honey garlic wings that we usually get had unusual taste, not bad but very different."}
{"text":"Had the Monday night boneless wings special with fries and poutine and a couple of beers. It was quiet but the service (Stephanie) was exceptional! The wings hit the spot - had the honey garlic and the \"hottest sauce\", both were very good. Fries were cooked to a medium well (slightly golden brown and not soggy). Very clean dining area with tons of TVs for everyone's viewing pleasure. Very tempted to come back for the Tuesday half price wings special (with a purchase of a drink)."}
{"text":"The worst poutine I have ever laid eyes on.

I placed my order through foodora assuming all wild wing locations were created equal. BOY WAS I WRONG.  These people sent me a poutine full of chunk gravy. Looks like they haven't bothered to stir the gravy since 2016.. and the taste is lacklustre at best. Not even worth the hassle of a refund. But please be warned. This place is trash."}
{"text":"Been here couple times because st.louis(my preferred choice) was busy.  But honestly this place is not bad, for some reason I still prefer st.louis wings but this place serves bigger wings.  St.louis's wings are little too small.

One of the biggest reasons why I prefer st.louis is because of the atmosphere, this place tends to be dead a lot of times.  However during big Raptors playoff games, they can get busy.

But if you like a quiet bar, then this might be for you.  For me, bar and grill has to be loud and cheerful.

Restaurant is very easily accessible, plenty of parking available in the plaza.

I haven't tried their other food items other than their wings so I can really comment on it but I assume it wouldn't be bad since this place has better reviews than st.louis."}
{"text":"This is a tacky wings place. I bet you're excited. Well it's not Hooters. Sorry.

Wings are about a dollar each. They have many types of sauce and TVs to watch popular sporting events. 

The wings tasted pretty good. About 40 minutes after consuming them though, it felt like there was a civil war going on inside my stomach. I think the technical term is \"Gut-Rot\". Anyways, it almost beats eating wings at home or at Hooters. 

No great deals to be had. A few rowdy locals, though."}
{"text":"Horrible service, I left my iPhone there by accident and the server tried to steal and sell it. Good thing my friend worked in the back and gave me back my phone."}
{"text":"On n'aime pas les ailes de poulet, c'est de la bouffe d'√©tudiant. Cependant ce restaurant 'Wing' est g√©r√© par une femme qui a une passion pour la cuisine argentine. Alors laissez les autres d√©guster leurs ailes de poulet √† la capsa√Øcine pendant que vous commandez de l'autre menu, celui du Gaucho !"}
{"text":"Let me start of by saying looking at the menu it looked extremely satisfying... But I was wrong. I ordered a few things to go and I ended up waiting a half an hour, in these kind of circumstances it would be understandable if the resto was busy, but it was dead. My expectations got even higher considering the fact that it took forever to make my salad, potato skin and wings. Once I got my food I was eager to eat it. As soon as I opened my salad my appetite was gone. My salad had no dressing on it, the cheese and olives didn't taste like cheese and olives, my chicken was tasteless, my salad was old. Overall it just looked like they soaked my salad in water. As for my wings they turned out soggy. And last but not least the potato skin was plain, I had to add salt to add some sort of flavour to it. Overall it was a bad experience.... I really hope they make changes because it was not worth my money and the waiting."}
{"text":"Worst wild wings I've been to... I think I've been to at least 4 in the GTA
We originally wanted to go to St Louis for wings (since it was tuesday) the wait was too long so we ventured to Wild Wings... bad choice.
Place was fairly empty.. service was slow. I ordered an angus burger with cheese ... but didn't end up getting any cheese on my burger, waitress denied I ordered it with cheese but offered to put cheese on for me. We waited over 20 minutes to get the bill and even longer to pay.. 
When I got the bill I noticed they charged me the burger price (8.49) and extra cheese (0.99)... whereas the burger with cheese cost 8.99. Not a big deal but when I brought it up to the waitress, she told me it was actually the same price. I asked her to double check (because I was sure it wasn't). Bad service?
The burger was alright. I wouldn't return. I can get more delicious burgers at the same price with better service and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Moved to Richmond & Church?  Just had the wings here as it's close to work.  I had the Smoked Jerk.  Yumm... not as jerky as I would have hoped.  And will try some of the other flavours next time as mentioned in other reviews."}
{"text":"Took 40 minutes to get our order of wings.  Only one waitress on Thursday night. Go to the other locations in the gta. This one is not worth the wait."}
{"text":"Once again on Thursday night after work  I take the bus east instead of west and end up at Wild Wing.  The pint and a pound deal can't be beat. Sitting on the patio watching the world go by. 

Usually have the hot honey flavour and it is awesome. Today I was hankering for something different and went with the desperado. Yummy it was. Now this comes with fries unless you order the deal. 

If you are in the neighbourhood stop by and enjoy. Service is fine."}
{"text":"Tried another location of Wild Wings and once again I am happy with my experience. If you are in the neighbourhood pleased stop by and check it out. Nice little patio where you can enjoy the sunshine or the shade. I had the spaghetti western flavour and while not my favourite (hot honey) it was good.  Now that the fries are included you have the complete meal."}
{"text":"Every other Wild Wing I have been to has been 5 stars, but not this place. 

The wings had the bare minimum of sauce, when other locations have been soaked in sauce. They also almost forgot the veggies and dip and didn't even offer them over the phone (take out). I know it's not a big deal but we also got the cheap wipes with our food when I have always gotten the Wild Wing brand thick wet wipes from every other location. And last but not least, the staff wasn't very friendly - when I called the lady went \"You know were the location next to dollarama right?\"... Obviously I know which location I am calling.  

Not much else to say about this location, except for the fact that I will not be returning."}
{"text":"I just came from lunch from this location.  2 hours it took. We were one of 2 tables that were there.  Slow service and rude server named Shanet.  She forgot our order, brought all the wrong things and was rude about it.  I didn't tip her.  I don't understand how it takes 2 hours for wings and fries that come out of a bag.  If you find it too hard to do your job then find another one.  I was on my lunch and I do not have time to wait around for wings and fries, when I could have gone to Mercatto and gotten freshly made food and all done in a hour time frame.  Horrible.  I would just keep walking."}
{"text":"Went here on a Friday night, while it was pretty empty the staff was super friendly and was taking requests of songs to play. It was really fun as this involved the customers and everyone was really getting in to it, singing along to the throw back tunes! 

Food is ok, pricey for mediocre wings, but definitely a fun place to be!"}
{"text":"Terrible service, wrong order came out and manager refused to change order, asked for a discount on the order and he apologized and said no. Keep in mind this was all communicated through our server. He refused to come out and speak with us."}
{"text":"Can wings ever get better than this?
There are sooo many flavors to choose from. I usually end up something that tastes hot, peppery, lemony and I have never been disappointed. 
I agree that a dollar each for a wing seems pricey .. they could come up with better offers/coupons."}
{"text":"One of my friends bought a Buytopia voucher for Wild Wings. They tried using it at this location before and was told that it was valid for only 1 person (1 person per voucher). So my friend was expected to eat $25 worth of food all to herself. She wasn't able to share the coupon between 2 people which was ridiculous. The voucher was about to expire and asked if I wanted to use it. I said sure, I'll try it and see if they will take it for a table of 2 people. As soon as I presented the voucher, the manager came over and said that Wild Wings was losing too much money and is no longer accepting vouchers. They would not even offer $12 off our order (which was the price of the voucher $12 for $25 worth of food and drink). 

The place was absolutely dead on a Saturday night at 9:30pm, no wonder they are losing money. And with the customer service that I received, it makes me wonder how they treated others that purchased this Buytopia voucher. 

Not only did I make the mistake of trying to use this voucher, we decided to stay for a drink and service was incredibly slow. We were just getting out of our chairs to leave when the waitress came over to ask what we would like to order. 

There was a bad smell that was coming from the kitchen? washroom? It stunk like a sewer (terrible rotten egg smell), the staff had to open the front door to make the smell go away faster since other customers were complaining."}
{"text":"To start off i dont think this location even should get 1 star. I went there today and the service was terrible. When we walked in the waitress just starred at us rather than seating us. Finally we just grabbed a seat and she came and gave us the menu. My friend and I both ordered their wings. After eating a few we found a piece of hair wrapped on one of the wings. Disgusted we called the waitress to inform her and instead of taking it and getting a new batch she started to pull the hair out right in front of us. Then she asked us if we wanted a new batch but after waiting a while to get our initial order and after seeing the hair in the food we lost our appetite and just wanted to leave. When we asked for the bill the waitress actually billed us for the wings that had hair in it after we gave it back and didn't order anything else. After arguing with her and her calling her manager she finally took the wings off our bill. Then we asked to speak to the manager and she gave us his number since he wasn't in. Then a few hours later we called to talk to the manager and he said the waitress said there was no hair in the food and how she shouldve charged us for the wings. Never going here again this was the worst customer service I've received at any restaurant."}
{"text":"Wild Wing is your local wings/beer joint... on steroids. They have wings with over 100 types of sauces you can never get bored with. The sauces range from the safe \"bbq\" to the saucy \" Garlic Parmesan\" and for the wild risk takers \"chocolate sauce\". Yip. I speaket the truth. 

This location is family owned. 
They don't really look like they know what they are doing. 
they don't even look like they enjoy the 'beer/wings' atmosphere
They barely speak English.

The dining room is TINY , but def hard to miss off of Queen & University.
It's got about 5 booths along one side and a few tiny tables and chairs on the other end. The space between is so narrow, I had to press down my winter jacket. Bathroom are downstairs are super tiny. 

A few times the orders came out wrong. I vowed the next time they bring something to our table, I'll eat it first then let them know it wasn't our table. Alas, the 3rd time was our order. 

They had MGD on tap. woot.

 Somehow even the crap service didn't deter me away from the orgasmic list of wings this chain offers. Got a loud, big crew hungry for some wings and beer? make a trip down here. Order a few pitchers and laugh at your own volume. The optimist in you will be having so much fun with your people and breathe out the \" Oh yea, I forgot\" when the wings up. And what fun you shall have. Oh, the joy. Like Christmas, for a Muslim. Ha.  

The wings are well meaty, juicy and take no effort to come off the bone. They are most generous with the sauces, which makes me really happy. All the orders come in a standard wing basket with the serving paper keeping the sauce from in the same region as the wings. This is excellent strategy for triple dips. 

Sweet potato fries - were pretty good too for sharing. Comes with a side peanut sauce, which is sweet and almost buttery but not a big favorite of the group. 
Calamari -  Delicious sharing appetizer. Not enough lemon squeezed on it, but definitely a succulent reassurance to the quality of items this high end wings joint serves. 
Mozza Sticks - Pretty standard. I didn't find them extra memorable. The marinara sauce it came with was bland. While the cheese to breading ratio was excellent for a cheese lover, the breading was of poor quality. It was too flaky for my liking. 
  
If you have yet to make a visit to this chain, here's some garlic-loving fellow yelper's suggestion

Spicy GarPar - Garlic  & Parmesan with spicy sauce. This mixture is amazing for a side kick.
Buttermilk Dill & Honey Garlic - My absolute favorite. I highly HIGHLY recommend this. It's the perfect balance of sweet and garlic. It puts a Tasmanian devil spin on the regular honey garlic. 
*Really though, Buttermilk ANYTHING is just an aphrodisiac. It hasn't been proven yet by scientists, but I'm sure it will be a thing. *

Pineapple curry - This was a delicate surprise. At first I wasn't sure why I liked it because I don't normally enjoy the sourness of pineapple. Then it hit me, like an arrow from Theseus. There was no bitter sour taste. It was saucy with the right smudge of sweet that made you feel like you were tasting something exotic. Be prepared to lick your fingers a few times to reminisce the taste of this sauce.   

sad fact: I witnessed the owners turning away more than 8 people requesting to use the bathrooms. I don't know how standard this is, but I feel it's a bit inhumane to say \"no you have to let your bladder burst instead\". Just sayin. 

Happy Wingin.

{"text":"So far, being the closest bar near me, I really enjoyed the food and company I had here. Not crazy about the atmosphere but that's not really why I go there anyways.
Their wing menu is excellent. I like how each flavour has an index rating how spicy the flavour is (I hate spicy stuff). 
Their prices are a tad unreasonable, if they put out a few deals, I'd be much happier going out there more often. Until then, it's the go-to place anytime I have a hankering for wings."}
{"text":"I'm a big wing nut. And this place satisfies the wing part AOK.

When you first walk in, the decor is distinctly ranch country. There is a bar area with TVs showing the sports of the the moment, and several beers on tap. The seating for regular patrons are all in wood.

Service is prompt and friendly. Free refills on soft drinks.

The variety of wing flavors, and how they are prepared, are great. Everyone I have brought here has loved their wings. It doesn't disappoint. Veggy dips are great too. Here can be found the best dill sauce I have ever tasted. Really.

What is disappointing is their french fries. They're saggy, bland, and mushy when ordering the poutine. And to add insult to injury, the amount of cheese you get (compared to the menu pic) is insulting. I've had to send it back to the kitchen twice for more. This is the reason why I'm giving them a 3 as supposed to a 4."}
{"text":"Ordered the good the bad and the ugly poutine and deep fried pickles, and a coke.

20 dollars later before tip, kinda let down.

The quantity of food for the price was lacking and I can't excuse that by saying it was quality. 

My opinion? try something else."}
{"text":"This place is horrible. Went with a friend but wasn't very hungry so just ordered the mozzarella sticks. There were 4 tiny sticks and the price was $8.50!!! At more than $2 per mozzarella stick, they weren't even good! The service was terrible too...the waiter didn't come by once to check on us even though there were only three other tables there. When we finally asked for our bill, she took so long we just went up to pay. I wasn't going to give her more than a 10% tip, however, their machine does not allow you to select a tip amount less than 15%! So you are basically forced to pay 15% unless you pay cash! I didn't want to make a scene and just selected the 15% and left (which is exactly what they are trying to coerce you to do). 

I definitely won't be back, which is kind of disappointing since it is pretty much across the street from me. I have been here a few times and its always been a bit of a disappointment but this recent experience really sealed the deal. Hopefully a better restaurant replaces it."}
{"text":"Came here for a half price wings Tuesday promotion. When we went to order our wings, we were told only the first lb of wings is half price..so for 2 lbs it is 22.50..which isnt what i would consider a great deal. We ordered garlic cheese bread which seemed to have been microwaved seeing as all of the edges of the bread turned rock hard and not edible. Gross. Place seemed very dirty and unkept... avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"Took literally 45 mins for us to get our bill and pay after first asking. Food sucks compared to the other Wild Wings I go too. Never coming here again. You're better off driving a couple minutes more to the Copper Creek location or the 16th and Markham one."}
{"text":"I stopped into Wild Wing for a quick lunch last week.  The place was packed, a good sign that the wings would be delicious!  My sister and I were greeted and directed to a table as soon as we got there.  Their wing menu selection was huge, about 50+ different sauces.  I picked the \"I am Canadian\" - hot + maple syrup; the wings were properly sauced and super yummy.  On the hot scale, it was about a 4 out of 10, where 10 is extremely hot.

Their sweet potato fries and calamari were average.  I did not like the honey mustard sauce that the fries came with.

For a wings fix, I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My go-to spot for wings and beer after Raptors games. Absolutely in love with their staff! Great food and company."}
{"text":"This was my first Wild Wings experience and, unfortunately, will be my last.  The service was terrible, the prices were high, and the food was mediocre.  The waitress was even wearing a jogging suit.  She brought out our food in stages over about a 10 minute period, yet the place was empty. I have not seen a restaurant so lacking in professionalism."}
{"text":"Awful experience. Fries came first and were still crunchy in the middle. We were there in January and every time the door opened we froze. The wings came and they were barely even warm. We sent them back and they were clearly nuked. Still only warm but some centres were hot. Would not go back to this franchise. Poor atmosphere and dreadful food."}
{"text":"Went here with my girlfriend, nephew and niece on Tuesday for their advertised Tuesday special: Buy 1 pound of wings and get a 1/2 pound for free for 10.99 with the purchase of a beverage. So we got 4 (1 1/2 each) pounds and 4 drinks. The two little ones wanted a Root Beer and a Dr Pepper pop, I got an Ice tea and my gf a Pepsi. After we ordered we were told that there are no refills for the Ice tea but there is for pop and that my nephew and niece's pop was considered \"Half a drink\" so in order to receive the special, I would have to buy another beverage. The special had not said that flavoured pop is not considered a beverage and considered a half beverage. I mean I have never even heard of that. The wings were ok, not the best I've had but not the worst.  The menu also has spelling errors on it. 

Spent $14 just on our drinks. Probably won't be back here again."}
{"text":"My experience wasn't quite as bad as the other people who've reviewed it, but in their defense all 4 times I've gone here, I've been the only table. 

What can I say, it's a chain restaurant. Wild wing (not just this one) have about the worst decor ever. I've never visited a wild wing where my table wasn't unnaturally sticky, it's the worst. 

The service is okay, but seriously my table has always been the only one, so how could they possibly screw it up.

The food is alright. I've tried a bunch of wing flavors, and they're alright. They're not wonderful, a lot of them are pretty redundant. They should try less, at having so many flavors, and try more at having less, but really good, flavors. 

I mean it's alright if you're really craving chicken wings, but don't go for anything else (seriously avoid the burgers)."}
{"text":"While waiting an hour for a table at Guu, we wanted an appetizer.

Tempted by the smell of grease and deep fried goodness, we decided to check out Wild Wing (Also, we could catch the end of the hockey game, good job Habs!).

What I didn't expect was the selection of flavors on the menu.
I won't bother listing any flavors, that would take too long.
There are lots.

The menu offers all kinds of combos, ribs and wings combo...excellent!

Also, fries can come with with all kinds of toppings! Garlic-Parmesan, cheese, gravy, chili, or bacon!

Another thing I liked is the option for boneless wings.  My friends preferred wings with bones. Something primal and satisfying about ripping meat off bones with teeth.

I personally love boneless wings.  Less mess and less work to get food into my mouth.

I'll come back here for sure to try some other flavors!  This place is like a scaled down version of All-Stars wings for downtown folk. :)"}
{"text":"I was at your restaurant recently and I think this will be my last time. I work in customer service so I try to give leniency to staff when it's busy. There were two wait staff, but even when it wasn't busy, it was impossible to get their attention. First, our waitress forgot to punch in our appetizers even after we mentioned it to the manager when he dropped off the wings. We waited over an hour for our appetizers. When I dipped my chip in the spinach dip, I found a plastic foil (the size of a store-bought tub of spinach dip) inside the dip! Great, now I know how you really prepared this dip. We speak to the manager, send it back, and simply ask it to be taken off the bill - we didn't want a second remade order of that. When we finish our mediocre meal with ridiculously inattentive service, we ask for the bill. Firstly, the spinach dip wasn't taken off. The server takes the receipt back before I could check the rest. She comes back and I find that the half price wings was only applied to 3 orders, not 4 despite ordering 4 drinks. I get her attention after 10 minutes of waving her down and explain the situation. She says she will fix it. 15 minutes later, she hasn't fixed it. She walks by the table and tells me the manager will be with us shortly. I wait patiently. 15 more minutes have passed and the manager seems to have no intention of coming to see us. I walk up to the manager to explain the situation to him and he had no idea about the problem! Zero communication between the staff and the manager!! I tell him that we don't want to wait for him to fix it any longer. I've calculated what the bill should be and prepared the exact amount of money we owe. I hand it to him and tell him to fix the bill on his own time. I'm not waiting any longer. And then I left. 

I tried. I really tried to be patient and understanding. I even tipped them a little because I understand that it was busier than they have probably expected. But the quality of my food was not good enough for me to dismiss the quality of my experience. At no point did the manager take control of my frustration to offer me a discount for my troubles. At no point did I feel understood that my time is important too. We dined for over 2 hours when it could've been just 1, and mind you, with a toddler and an infant. I'm sure the staff were genuinely nice people that simply lacked training. But unfortunately, I don't think I will be returning to any wild wings because of how the food might have been prepared."}
{"text":"This review is for the owner/manager.

Been a big fan and long time customer at your restaurant. Never had a complaint about food or service before. 

In the last 3 weeks, my fianc√© and I have been to your restaurant twice. While the food was fine, the service was just garbage. There's a new waitress (older, brunette, long ponytail,maybe eastern-European?) who's been behind the bar. For more than an hour, other than myself seating myself and her delivering a menu, she's never heard from or seen again. The first time I came, my wings came out more than 45 minutes after ordering and they were cold because she just stood at the bar talking with other guys (not doing anything work related). Second time was last night - while food came out, for over an hour, she never came back to check on us, provide us with refills, or even a bill or container for food! I had to go to the bar and pay for my bill and left my food. 

Not my intention to throw anyone under a bus or get someone canned, but if you want loyalty from customers, fix this and train her so she actually does her job. The rest of the ladies have always been amazing there.  But I'm willing to take my business elsewhere - you're not the only wild wing in the area or wing joint. 

Thanks."}
{"text":"Was with a group of 6 looking for a late lunch on a Sunday (Oct. 19 2014) and went to Wild Wing around 2:45. Sign on the door says they open at 2:30. We go in and see all the chairs on top of the tables, and a kid tells us they're not open. We asked him when they open, and he didn't know. So I guess I'll never know if this place is open or not. I won't make the mistake of thinking we can eat there in the future."}
{"text":"The staff is super friendly! The patio looks crappy from outside but when I walked in and got to see it from the inside I was pleasantly surprised! Awesome atmosphere,  there were even Tvs for the patio. Wings were delish, and we had a couple of tequila shots and had a pretty good Friday afternoon here. I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"First time here and we did take out.

The service was great, very friendly, helpful and very patient ( I couldn't make up my mind on wing flavors, they have so many!).

While we were waiting for the food I had a drink which was big (coke and rum) they put in a tall glass.

the food was pack very well and was still hot when we got it home.

We ordered Wings (big wings and the flavors are amazing), Potato skins (good but could have used more bacon, 2 of the piece had no bacon), dill pickle wedges (very crispy and tasty), Poutine (big and great gravy).

Over all the service was great, great food and good prices. I would definitly come back again."}
{"text":"Went in to this location on a Wednesday night with 7 friends and because the Leafs were playing and this location didn't have LeafsTV it was empty. We were literally the only people in there. The service was pretty garbage even though no other customers were there. I came in after my friends had ordered and our server was nowhere to be found for a good 10 minutes. When she finally appeared back on the floor I waited for her to come over for another few minutes and finally gave up and went over to her. Remember, we were the only people not staff in the restaurant. 

The food was delicious as it almost always is at any Wild Wing location. Everyone was more than happy with their food so no complaints or particular praise there as this is a chain/franchise so, frankly, I expect it.

When it came time for our bill all of a sudden our server became worse than a helicopter parent and their first kid. She literally stood there right at the table as we figured out who owed what, who needed change, who was paying card, who was using cash, etc (the typical situation when you have 8 friends together chilling who shared pitchers of beer, appetizers, and even some desserts). It wasn't even that crazy of a tab! $225 between 8 people after taxes.
 
Not a very good experience from a service perspective. With the service we received when we were the only customers in there I would hate to see what happens to the service when/if they have more patrons."}
{"text":"Best wings and service I have ever had!! I come here almost every week just for their wings. This is the only place I go to for my wings and beer! 

The food is always fresh and delicious. I always get my favourite flavour of wings here and the chef makes it to perfection. Words cannot describe how good the food is here! 

The servers here are very fast and friendly! The service is always amazing every time I come here. We are greeted and seated right away. The restaurant is huge and we always get a spacious seat with no wait time! 

Can't wait to come back again! 

Best food, best service and amazing time."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with Wild Wing's wings! Best to go on Tuesdays for their pound and a half wings deal, which would be $10.99, and Thirsty Thursday deal; a pint and a pound of wings for $13.99 and $0.30 more for premium beer. They offer Steam Whistle so it was worth it!
Went here for lunch on a Thursday and it wasn't that busy but there was only one waitress at the time so our orders were slower than usual and we were starving!

If you like something more on the cheesey side definitely try Gar Par, Blue Moonshine, Angels on the Moon and basically anything with blue cheese, so good! Prepare to get messy because it'll be a 'Finger lickin good' type of experience :)"}
{"text":"This was a horrendous experience. We had parents going into the kitchen to help support the servers because the restaurant was grotesquely understaffed. Please, on Saturday nights (and basketball game days) please ensure you have an adequate number of staff available to customers. Worst service I've ever experienced at a restaurant. 

Take this as an opportunity for improvement, but I won't be returning to this location."}
{"text":"$12 for 8 wings that are small. $3 for dry fish. They charged for ketchup! And fish sacue. That came In the packet! This is sad. I will not be going back. I will find another wing place like st.louise that give me bang for my buck"}
{"text":"Service at this Place is getting worse and worse instead of serving the costumers all Female Server Are having smalltalk with boys... Go get urself  a Other Job!!! Left the Place After 20min of waiting if i could i would not give Even 1star!!!!!"}
{"text":"Wild Wing is a franchise, and as such, whether you like their style of chicken is something that you can discover at any of their many locations. Frankly I shouldn't like this place. The wings are a bit smaller than I would typically like, and it doesn't have the dirt cheap eats that I usually celebrate. Yet Wild Wing straddles the line between dive bar (see Toby's) and overpriced fake-locals (see Duff's and really every pub that has more than one location). You will not find $10 pitchers here. Or a homeless looking bouncer. But the place still feels like it has its own personality.

What really makes this place different is that Chrissy and her brother aren't your run of the mill franchisers. In fact, many Yelpers might be more familiar with the pair as the purveyors of amazing peameal on a kaiser  at the Gaucho stand at St. Lawrence Market - a treat that will be carried here as well, making this restaurant the first to bring the delicacy to SoBlo. Chrissy used to have a deli at this Royal Theatre adjacent location, and then one night while she was counting cash realized that success on College Street meant being open during the big rushes on Thurs/Fri/Sat nights. She shuttered the deli and began planning next steps. The story goes that she shopped around and settled on Wild Wing because they were the most flexible franchise. They would allow you to carry your own food and even tweak the 'look' of the restaurant. Accordingly, instead of a big cowboy mural, old license plates and an off-pink colour scheme, this new location boasts a warm natural wood aesthetic, with a big exposed brick wall behind the bar and open windows at the front. TV's adorn the wall up and down their narrow space, creating a bright a boisterous atmosphere. 

Even on their first night (well, technically second, their soft opening was the night before and included a visit from Rick Springfield. So... that's awesome) there was a good crowd. I had a pound of wings (RING OF FIRE !!!!) and a pint for $7.50 and was well satiated. My GF had the meal for $8.50. Pints on their own were $5.50 which is also a reasonable price for a clean and pleasant pub.

College Street is now The Wing District of Toronto. With Duff's, Toby's, Sneaky Dees, Southside Louies and Mullins all within four blocks, there is no dearth of options if you're feeling this cherished meal. With the addition of Wild Wing, that distinction has been cemented. Wild Wing is a great new spot on College and I have no doubt it will enjoy well deserved success there."}
{"text":"I really like this place. Half of my reason is because it reminds me of my university days...memories of my big group of friends (some who I rarely see now) hangin out..boozin and eating wings. The other half is because I come here and it's nice and quiet...I love the booths, and the service is always pleasant.

I came here last Sunday and noticed that the wings were smaller than the ones at Puck N'Wings (Yonge and Finch location). Now, I don't know if they were always small or just small that day...in any event, that didn't affect the taste. Here is where you can get GarPar which is a mix of Garlic and Parmesan sauce. It really is yummy and ever since I have been coming here, I have always order it.

I have never been to this location when there is a game on. This location is my quiet Wings place...where I just want to go and chill with my boyfriend...drink and eat. Prices are reasonable as they come with Wings in Toronto."}
{"text":"Hmm.. Wings are good but place a bit run down .. A bit boring.. They have a patio but view is not the best.. I think I would rather pick up my food from there then it there.."}
{"text":"Good food very good service 
The price is good can't be beat beer and wings 
Specials .. It was fast fresh and came exactly as I ordered 
The bartender she was amazing and super nice .. Even thought I could tell she was having a bad night
The location is easy to find 
The beer selection on tap could of been better but the food and service made up for that
Each time I've been here it always was perfect.,
Try the breaded ravioli"}
{"text":"worst service I've ever had as far as i can remember. Waitress all alone at the floor, doubling as bartender, taking orders, handling the payments. Not sure whose fault it was that it turned out that way it but at least be apologetic when a room full of people have been waiting an hour for 2 orders of chicken wings. Also please warn customers that service is going to suck due to the conditions. I was hoping another member of staff was going to suddenly enter and save the day. It was painful. Partly my fault that I didn't figure this out when I entered and should have left early, but I was hungry!

The wings finally came and they weren't bad. Although, after an hour of waiting with the stomach grumbling, probably anything edible would have been good."}
{"text":"Don't usually come here as I know of a million places with great wings but for some reason my colleagues suggested it for a lunch time pint, and along i went.

They had a pound and pint deal for I think $14, and so I went ahead and ordered some flat beer and some thai style wings, (forget the name). The wings sauce tasted great but they were so small that i was still hungry enough to grab a slice of pizza afterwards. 

Nothing special to rave about really."}
{"text":"I met up with a friend after class to have a bite and a drink, and to catch the last period of the first regular season Leafs game. There wasn't much else in the area and this was the first restaurant/bar we saw. I've been to other Wild Wings and this one just didn't meet the same level of the experiences I have had at the other ones. This space is also pretty small compared to other ones and one of the TV's colouring was off so people appeared green.

There was only one server and she was nice, she just said sit wherever you want so we chose one of the booths with a TV right across from it. When she took our drink order I said \"I'll drink for both of us\" referring to an alcoholic beverage because my friend couldn't on this particular evening, but she must have misheard what I had said this, so after taking my drink order she walked away. I had to get her attention after to confirm that I only wanted one of what I ordered as it was not the same for both of us and that she also needed to take my friend's drink order. 

Anyway, we ordered a single of Chiquita in Paradise and got them breaded. Its listed as a five which is extra hot, but neither of us found it hot, instead it was pretty salty. The flavour was good though, if only it was hotter and less salty it would be a winner.

Our server checked on us once and we were okay, but after the hockey game was over and we were ready to go it was very difficult to get her attention to settle our bill. Eventually my friend walked up to her to ask for it. My recommendation would be to have one other server to help out."}
{"text":"Terrible service!! 
I came here Sunday night(jan 31/16) a little after 6pm. There were only 2-3 other customers in the restaurant. My family and I sat down and were presented with menus. The waitress didn't take our drink order. We waited 20 minutes for her to come to our table before I went up to the bar to find her. She was busy texting on her cell phone. I told her my family and I were ready to order. She said \"OK\". I asked if she could please come to our table to take the orders, said said\" OK \" again. We waited an additional 10 minutes and she still didn't show up. We decided to leave. As we walked out the door we saw her behind the bar on her cell again. This is unacceptable considering there were only a few other customers in the place. Avoid this place, they don't deserve your patronage. We ended up going to Wild Wings on St Clair near Runnymede instead."}
{"text":"The wings here were very good. We also had the pulled pork poutine, that was also good. It came out fresh and quickly.  Our server Shante was the real star of the night. She was so friendly, professional and attentive."}
{"text":"Monica was our server and she was absolutely fantastic.

My average score comes from my frustrations with the place.

1) it needs a renovation 
2) the dishwasher leaves a chlorine smell on the cups - one of mine actually had residue on it.. it was gross
3) the food comes out WAY TOO FAST for me to think how long was it sitting there or what am I eating?

but my upmost frustrations come from the lack of sound played. I was here for game 5 of the Jays game and the quality (or there lack of) was horrible. it was impossible to hear what the commentators were saying, we asked SO many times to have the sound up - the response we got was \"I don't know\" or \"it doesn't work\".

not acceptable for a \"bar\"."}
{"text":"This brand new location of the rapidly expanding franchise replaces a pizzeria/bar that I haunted since I was just a smurf. So upon entry, I almost expected WW to impress me as payback for buying out C.J Gino's and one of the best pizza pies in town! Well alas and alack, I've been back to WW three times since they've opened and I haven't yet felt remunerated.

Some notes:
The wings are good (albeit not Buffalo good).
They're big, they're expensive, there's about 100 flavours, and they're breaded (blasphemy to any Buffalonian).
Their heat rating chart is out-of-whack (\"hot\" is not hot at all).
Since they have about ~100 flavours, choosing is a real pain since who knows what \"Garpar\" or \"Lock, Stock and Barrel\" actually taste like in advance? Sure there's the sampler platter, but you pay even more per wing just for the variety.
Wait staff is nice and knowledgable, even though it's a brand new location. I was pleasantly greeted by an out-of-town \"BOH Trainer\" who is a representative from Head Office who stays with the new franchise until it's up and running smoothly. Very impressive!
As of my last visit, the patio is was not licensed, so all brewskies must be chugged inside."}
{"text":"This place suck's, came here with friends several month's ago and can still remember the poor quality and service. A Sunday evening, barely no one there. Group of 7, orders were incorrect, one order missed 4 times, food was cold and my dish had a piece of hair in it. The waitress was useless and didn't care about her job. Food was late and don't plan on returning. Found better establishments else where in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Although the issue of best wings is hotly debated, I tend to always come back to this casual Midwest themed chain for their laid-back ambience and myriad of flavours. Call me a sucker for variety. 

My two favourite flavours here are the garlic garlic dry rub and the gar par. The wings also come with a side of fries and veggie sticks (depending on the location ) which is a nice bonus. 

Today we ordered the jalapeno poppers and 1 lb of the garlic garlic and gar par in the boneless wings as that was the Monday special. 

There were only 5 jalapeno poppers in a serving and it tasted kind of lacklustre, like it gave up trying to be an app. In my first bite, there was some unevenness going on, half of the jalapeno wasn't fully cooked and tasted cold still, while the other was burning hot.

The boneless wings tended to be more on the dry side when compared to their regular wings - probably because they are all white meat. 

But..I probably will come back just for the 2 seasoning flavors, as I haven't found anything that quite simulates them anywhere else yet. Having said that, stick to the wings (with bones) my friends."}
{"text":"WORST EXPERIENCE EVER! do not go to this location! I went there once and decided I wanted to wash my hands before my meal arrived to only find out that the restaurant had no SOAP. disgusting! waitress couldn't find soap in the restaurant and that was a major alarm so i decided to leave the restaurant. Before leaving, I asked the waitress how they wash their hands and she did not answer me, and then I asked how would other female be able to wash their hands after using the bathroom and she replied \"I don't know\" with a blank stare!! But I called the next day to make a complaint to manager by the name of \"Nadia\" and all she replied was \"okay.\" I called again since i did not like her answer and then she replied \"DO YOU HAVE A LIFE?!\" with a very mean immature tone of voice! wow!! and she is a manager?!! unacceptable behaviour.  I made a formal written and verbal complaint to head office. poor health and safety practices here! worker's need to get trained better and management needs MANNERS!!!!!!!!!!! PLEASE TERMINATE MANAGER: NADIA DUE TO UNPROFESSIONALISM, LACK OF EMPATHY, LACK OF APOLOGIZING, LACK OF TRAINING, LACK OF INTERPERSONAL SKILLS, LACK OF HOLDING RESPONSIBILITY."}
{"text":"Limited draft beer, wings were not good, fries were good but not ordered. Wings ordered were dry cajun, previously cooked wings with a touch of added Cajun seasoning were supplied. Place was empty - no surprise...."}

Had the Jamaican me crazy wings, honey garlic wings and fully loaded chilli cheese dog. Excellent. 
Great food, new location is spotless and the service is solid. 
I will be back!"}
{"text":"Love this location of wild wings. I always receive great and friendly service. I go at least once a month and have never been disappointed. Love trying all the flavours and will continue to visit here when we feel like wings. Tried the location at college and yonge and this location is way better."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Came with a party of six. Took 50 minutes to get 5 of us our food and another half our for the other.  Out of the 6 orders 1 basket of wings was hot and 2 were the wrong flavor. All if these mishaps happened with only 1 other table in the place. And they refused to comp the order of wings they forgot about. Don't wast your time."}
{"text":"I love the dry spicy lemon rubbed non-breaded wings with Chippers dusted in Cajun and with a dill dip for the veggies. I've been here once before and I ordered the same thing. I'll probably continue to order this since the spicy lemon dry beats the lemon pepper at hooters by far! They also provide hand wipes and great customer service. $21 for single flavour wings and a pop."}
{"text":"We all know what we're getting when we go to Wild Wing. It's wings tossed in what seems like a billion flavours and sauces, then your choice of drink or poison to chase it down. The food isn't phenomenal but wings can't be awful and it's not out-of-this world expensive. As a chain I rate Wild Wing 4 stars, but this location, the one closest to my home, I give 1. Once I ordered the Bacon-poutine and it was served cold, as in the gravy and cheese had re-hardened. Once they got my girlfriend's order completely wrong but we had movie tickets and couldn't wait for another meal to be prepped. I can let these little mishaps slide, but this last Sunday my girlfriend and I went in after our movie ended (roughly 7pm) and were pleasantly surprised to see it wasn't that busy. We were seated quickly, but that was the end of the service. We sat for 15 minutes without our drink order even taken. Other tables were getting their drinks and napkins taken care of but we were basically ignored! 15 minutes! We walked out and went somewhere else for dinner, this Wild Wing establishment is off of our dining list now. This location is probably only surviving because of the proximity to late night bars and a movie theatre just steps away. Disgrace to a decent chain."}
{"text":"Not terrible, but not fantastic. The wings, service, pricing, ambiance, etc, etc, etc, are a resounding average. I generally end up here as a second choice but I don't regret it. 

As a bonus though, it has a huge number of TVs, that you can see from anywhere, if you want to go watch a local sporting event."}
{"text":"A few of us went there on Sunday morning to watch the hockey game. Despite the crowd early in the morning, they handled it very well. Our server was pleasant and the food was great. We tried around 6 flavours and every one of them was delicious. We definitely would return here as we have nothing but good things to say about this place!"}
{"text":"Fast and Friendly service GREAT Wings! My fav are gar par and daisy duke! I just wish they were open longer like the other locations in the downtown area. But otherwise it is a great place to be"}
{"text":"Restaurant gives very small portion for sides. Ordered an additional side of French fries and it was the smallest portion I have ever seen. Wasn't worth the price. I have been to better wild wings! Don't go to this location!"}
{"text":"I came out here for some wings and it just isn't as good as it used to be. They are average wings, not too much seating and the service is meh. The wait time was also a bit long. It's good if you don't mind...but I definitely think this place has lost a little bit of the spark that it used to have...would rather go to other wings places in the area."}
{"text":"I love wild wings but they're seriously understaffed at this location... it took 25 minutes from the time we sat for a waiter to come take our drink orders."}

{"text":"Service is great but 12 tvs and they only have one sports channel available...disappointing so we left"}
{"text":"Extremely poor customer service. Waited 30 mins to be served just water, and mind you that the restaurant was empty. When food finally arrived 1 hour after being seated, the food felt as if it was a little warmer than room temperature. Highly recommend you to go to another location."}
{"text":"Okay wings, pricey and mediocre service.

I love wings - wild wings has good flavours but comes to over a dollar a wing. What a rip off. 

On two occasions to get my water refilled or even attended to by the waitresses has been   A challenge. Then when I pay the bill- I get complemented on my earrings and my shirt. I don't appreciate when there's bad service then you make face for a nicer tip. Give me great service, then you'll get a good tip. 

Better wing places out there within the area although it has good seating here."}
{"text":"I rate this location 3 stars, but the food and service there can vary between 2 and 4 stars depending on the cooks and the waiters.

When ordering remember to ask for the wings to be really saucy, or you have about a 40% chance of not getting enough sauce on them.

I've only been to this location around five times, but had to send the wings back once because they were cold when the waitress got around to bringing them to our table.

I haven't gone back in over 6 months because my chicken needs are satisfied down the street at Popeyes chicken, with some Bullseye BBQ sauce at home."}
{"text":"Second wing experience, my first being Puck'n Wings downtown. In my opinion this restaurant is definitely superior to Puck'n Wings b/c they have a greater variety in their menu, larger portions, better wing sizes (Puck'n wings are too large, wings should lean towards small/med in my opinion), and better flavour.

In addition I also enjoy  how there's a bucket for me to dump my bones. Not sure if most wing places have this, but Puck'n Wings didn't. I also ordered the apps (I went in the afternoon so half price w/ any drink i think) and I tried the fried broccoli and cheese along with potato skins. The potato skins were normal, nothing special but the broccoli and cheese was surprisingly delicious!!

The wings were yummy (though I forgot the name of what I ordered) but my only complaint is that there seems to be a sauce overload, and your tongue might get tired of the vinegar (from the bbq sauce) more quickly as a result. Free refills definitely a plus as well.

Unfortunately this location was very quiet during the afternoon, and me and my boyfriend were the only ones there, making it kind of awk. so I recommend going in the evening where it might be more busy. Also, the waitress wasn't rude or anything, and she did everything she was supposed to, but still nothing outstanding service wise.

Overall great experience, though I would actually give it a 3.5 (b/c of the sauciness of the wings), but there's no half stars on yelp so I thought they deserved to be rounded up just for being better than Puck'n Wings =)"}
{"text":"Came on a fairly busy night as the Leafs were playing. Ended up getting 2 pints and 2 flavours of chicken wings. The sweet escape (honey garlic w gar par on them) turned out pretty well, and my guest got a spicier choice which had a nice kick to it. 

The only thing I will say is that there weren't enough paper towels on each table so we had to share ours with another table a few chairs down. The waitress also forgot our buckets but quickly rectified any issues we had so we could see she cared. Thanks to that it did help our night feel more enjoyable. Would come back and recommend, however fyi this place is small and usually limited in seating."}
{"text":"This wild wings is pretty bad. Wings looked like they were from poached seagulls and pigeons from the parking lot. Literally little stubs and the bones were all shattered like the poor birds had been abused. 

The \"hang em high\" wings were a level 4 hot but just tasted like salted fried wings. Their poutine was horrible... The gravy tasted like it came from a knorr packet.... This place in general is basic and I would not come back."}
{"text":"I think this business deserves a 3.5 stars, but I'm giving it a 4 to bring up the current Average rating of it on Yelp! So that other people visit it too! 

The wings here are solid. As in, extremely delicious. I'm not a huge wings person, but these were absolutely wicked! They tasted like KFC, but 50 times better. They have 101 flavours, so huuuge variety here. Try the 'Smoke that Jerk' and the 'Southern Heat'! Amazing!!!

The decor is kinda cool, but a bit cold, like another reviewer mentioned. The prices are alright, but the service is fantastic. The servers are very attentive and try their best to appease the situation if they get anything wrong. 

I would do back here with a group of friends to try more of their flavours!

{"text":"Wings are good, but service was slow at this location......been to better Wild Wings before."}
{"text":"Service is so slow. Only one girl working a shift on a Saturday night. Took 10 minutes to get a menu , another 15 to take our order. I love the food that's the only thing that made me stay. HIRE MORE STAFF PLEASE."}
{"text":"Came here a few days ago and I called before to confirm the halal wings were available and they said they are out of non-breaded but have the regular breaded wings. I got 2 lbs. of the HALAL breaded wings in zesty lemon and korean bbq, our server was great, wings were awesome! The tables were SUPERR sticky, lots of fruit flies were in the air, drinks were flat but I was like whatever the food was good. 

Came back yesterday after work and a long drive for the Tuesday 1/2 price wings ($7) and our server told us:
1. They do not serve HALAL breaded wings at this location (even after I explained I bought them just a few days ago), she said maybe our server put it on the bill as HALAL but they definitely do not have breaded HALAL wings there...So I guess my wings were not halal?
2. They do not have an option to order any wings without a side order...weird 
3. Although it is half price on Tuesday, every lb. ordered required the purchase of an additional drink even though their soft drinks are usually refillable, meaning every lb. is $10 with a drink instead of $14 without (not really looking like 1/2 off anymore) 
4. After I was too lazy to argue I said okay, I'll take the non-breaded \"HALAL\" wings, with fries (I had no choice) and with a soft drink for $3
5. A few min later she comes back with the drinks to let me know \"Actually HALAL meat is more expensive than regular wings so I will just add $2 for each lb. you ordered\"
What??! Why didn't you tell me that before! Now my 1 lb of wings is $7+$3+$2= $12

I was so shocked she came up to me 10 min after I ordered to try to sneak $6 onto my bill so I told her I don't want anything and I left. Now I know why the 2 times I have been I was the only customer in the entire restaurant and the reviews are so bad. Hopefully this location closes soon. I went to Los Chicos nearby and had an awesome delicious flavourful meal instead."}
{"text":"The best Wild Wing I've ever been to. The decor and multiple tv's is worth the trip.  The wings are also very good. The location is very new so I hope they keep up the quality and classy atmosphere. The old Wild Wings need a Major overhaul once you've been to this location."}
{"text":"Wings and flavors are the best in the area. This place is just missing atmosphere. The service is usually just so so with the waitresses not really caring about the customers. New menu was a nice change. That's a start."}
{"text":"I'm getting so tired of doing this. Toronto is becoming the worst for expecting something and getting nothing. I try, trust me, I try to venture out of my usual spots but ALWAYS end up disappointed in Toronto, except for Suko Thai. 

Anyway, I digress...we decided to try Wild Wings. Ugh :(. I used ritual for my order and this experience gets interesting. I slammed them on ritual as well. We ordered at 5:46 for pick up at 6:07 (it was to take about 15-20mins). When my husband left it was at 5:59. He drove there. Literally two minutes away in the car. He got there and he had to wait 5 mins., okay but nobody was in there. So he waits. Gets food. Comes home and fries look like they were on someone else's plate. They were hard like they had been refried and they were cold. Why would the food be cold by the time he got home if it was just made?? The boxes were huge for some reason compared to the portions inside. A waste of cardboard. The box was three quarters empty. So sub-par fries and they were cold. It's a good thing actually that there weren't much fries because two orders came with our meal of 2lbs of wings but I ate none of the fries. Fried pickles. They were okay but old and cold as well. Now let's get to the wings. As per usual, the box was mostly empty with these tiny weenie itty bitty pitiful looking wings. Omg. I don't know what else to say. We paid $45.00 and everything was blah and nowhere near what we should have got in terms of portion for that money. I can't believe that was two pounds of wings. I didn't even eat the dessert, some weird Sin a Bites. They didn't even get the veggies right. (Please see photos). 

Why do restaurants in Toronto think they can get away with this stuff? From yesterday's burnt pizza from Pizza Nova to this. I'll just stick to my usuals, because trying new things in TO is proven to be disappointing time and time again."}
{"text":"I am not a huge fan of wild wings at any location I have visited. I went to this location near my house because I was very hungry and tired after a long day. 

I ordered a burger and onion rings. The burger and bun was such a weird texture. The bun was cold and was just as flimsy as the meat. While picking up the burger it almost split in two pieces.

The burger was also very thawed and under cooked tasting. Just strange. The bacon wasn't even crispy. 

The onion rings had way too much batter as well. 

The only reason I gave a two star rating (instead of one) was because of our server Nancy. She was attentive but not over bearing. She also makes a really good Caesar. 

There are a minimum of 7 televisions all tuned to a different channel and the sound rotates between them. Very distracting and irritating. 

The restaurant is very clean but that does not excuse a 8.00 drink cost. 

It is just not good food."}
{"text":"Recently dined at this Dufferin and Steeles location with a friend and have to say, if I had gotten sick I would have sued.
My friend and I went one early evening and started off by ordering a coffee which took an extrememly long time because apparently the outlet got shortcircuited (which I'll accept since the waitress explained).  Both of us proceeded to order 2 salads with balsamic dressing when my coffee finally came. 
When our salads came we did not notice the dressing and not seeing our waitress (or anyone for that matter), my friend approached the counter to acquire.  It took a longer than usual to try to explain and the male worker came back to our table later to ask again.
He asked us what it was that we actually wanted and we explained again when he proceeded to tell us while putting his finger into my salad, flickering over the toppings to let us know that their salads come predressed.
My friend confronted him and he just laughs while backing off mumbling and left.
This created such a distaste in my mind and makes me nauseous just thinking about it after.  I still tipped my meal and totally regrets it.
I will not be visiting this branch again and I feel I must say the staff needs to be retrained in food and safety."}
{"text":"I don't know about these reviews, but I loved it! The staff is so fun and down to earth, the staff is also super nice and extremely kind. Other wild wing locations suck compared to this one. I just found the food was so much better at this location vs the other locations.  

It's a bit out of my way from where I live but I would totally recommend this location. I also find that on game nights this location is far more active and fun to be in. 

But yes, I highly recommend this location because the food and customer service is SO amazing. 

Ohhhh and their fries are to die for! 

Love this place!

{"text":"I ordered a hot dog. They gave me a wrap with sausage. 
This wrap dog has everthing a normal person won't put on their hotdogs.  Like huge pieces of uncut lettuce. Along with cheddar that tasted old.

Seriously how hard is it to make a hot dog? And who eats hotdogs with a wrap?
I ordered a taco last time which was really awful too.

Advice: don't order anything other than wings from here.cuz u know they will mess it up"}

First the good - their fried pickle spears are really, really good. Order those or die.

The wings are just plain average. First of all, you don't bread them. Second, the sauce has to be amazing. This one is just a bit oily."}

{"text":"I've eaten Wild Wing a few times now, but my experience at their Orion Gate location was the most memorable. Pull up a chair, it's story time!

So my dad and I decided to get some wings on a weekday afternoon, and wandered in. The place is rather small (maybe 20 tables?), but took in the right about of relaxing sunshine, and we took a seat at the bar, a few stools away from the only other customer in the place. The impossibly cute bartender was very courteous, and prompt with our drinks. We ended up getting orders of the standard BBQ and honey garlic wings, with a side of onion rings.

A little ways into our food, we started noticing a pattern, regarding our co-habitant a few stools down. 
First off, let me paint you a picture: This guy looked like Gene Simmons, if Gene was run through the cycles of a middle-aged rut, graying hair, and a ratty tanktop. The kind of creepy guy you see wearing purple-lensed Ozzy-esque shades in the food court of a shopping mall, discreetly looking at teenage asses.

Anywho, it seemed that every time the bartender came to check on us, as she'd head back to the other end of the bar, 'Gene' would stop her, lean forward, and say things to her very quietly. My dad and I got a few chuckles out of it, because we were sure he was trying to hit on her, and she being waaaaay out of his league, would continually try to nicely get away.

This went on for a little while, when suddenly, on the 566th attempt, the bartender snaps at the guy, and starts raising her voice. 

We were wrong. As the guy recoils, slurrilly asking what he's done wrong, she rehashed their talks. It seems that Gene had taken to drunkenly demeaning the poor girl every time she walked by. For you see, according to the Gene book of society acceptance, women should not get their nails painted with cute designs, and upon seeing the nicely painted nails on the bartender, decided to go all Peter Finch about it.
She angrily (and yet still oddly professionally) informs him that she doesn't appreciate being talked down to, that she will still serve him, but she's done with the chit-chat. Good on her! 
Gene decided to not take the hint, and got all screamey about it, resulting in management asking him to leave. Still shouting at the poor girl's choice in nail design, Gene stumbled out into the sunny Brampton afternoon air, defeated. 

What caused poor Gene to have such a mental snap over painted nails? Did he catch the love of his life in a romantic nail-painting embrace with a muscular nail-design-artist? Was the final image he had of his children storming out due to his alcoholism, the tragic sight of his daughter's beautifully-painted middle finger raised his way? Perhaps it was his years of creeping the local Dairy Queen while drinking nail polish remover that has warped his perception. Sadly, we'll never know.

The wings and onion rings were tasty and reasonably priced. The bartender got an larger than usual tip for being such a trooper, and for inadvertently providing us with some quality dinner drama entertainment.

As for old Gene, I'd like to think he's still out there, fighting the good fight for us busy citizens, stopping the horrific injustice of nail painting. Or maybe he's huffing hairspray in the alley behind Baby Gap."}
{"text":"The service was great. That's as far as the positive goes. The deep friend pickles were good but for a place that has the word \"wing\" in it's name, you think the wings would be something close to kick ass. More like just ass.
The wings were small, knobby and had very little meat on them. I'm still nursing the little nub of skin between my two front teeth, which is swollen from the over seasoned dry rub on the wings.
On top of being sub par, they were also the most expensive wings I've ever had.

As a side note: What's up with breaded and battered wings?? I'll never understand this. Wings are covered in crispy skin (fat) why bread them??? I guess I grew up too close to Buffalo. Perhaps I'll shuffle off there the next time i want wings."}
{"text":"SO. NOT. WORTH. IT. 

Omg. I was trying to decide whether or not this was gonna get 1 star, and ultimately decided to go for it. I don't even give 1 stars usually.

First off, the place was rather quiet for a Wednesday night, but didn't really get much service. The server seated us, asked us for a beverage, and that was pretty much it. Other than coming back to take our order when waved down, she didn't do much. 

Second, the wings were tiny. I mean, TINY! I go for wings almost once a week, and have gotten used to the average size of a chicken wing. These wings they gave us were so small, they couldn't possibly be counted as 1 wing. Unfortunately, Wild Wing doesn't charge by weight, but by the number of wings. A single order is 9 wings at $12.99. With at least half of those wings being tiny, you definitely don't get your money's worth.

I was even hungry after eating here! I have NEVER been hungry after going for wings! Sadly, the fries they served with their wings were crap, so I didn't even want to eat those!

All in all, a horrible place to go. Not full. Not satisfied. Not happy. Will not be back, or to any other Wild Wing for that matter. And will never make the mistake of going anywhere but my favourite (St. Louis)!"}
{"text":"Doesn't open until 12pm,nail in the bench, and forgot the gravy.. Poor showing."}
{"text":"Horrible rude service.  Waited 20 minutes for drinks.  Waitress made excuses and wasn't apologetic at all.  Never taking my kids here again."}
{"text":"Almost 16 bucks for 8 pieces of wings? That's crazy! I used to come here a lot when the prices were decent...I will be looking elsewhere for wings from now on.."}
{"text":"This place is a scam. There is a deal on Wednesday which is 59 cents wings minimum order is 9wings. However, they made up a rule that 2 people 2 drinks are mandatory which is bullcrap! and the customer service is really bad. the waitress gave us our wings and left us there with no fork and plate. how the hell do you expect us to eat wings with no fork and plate? It took her at least 5 minutes to see us waiving our hands and there is very little customers in the restaurant. WILL NEVER GO AGAIN!!!"}
{"text":"Wow. Walked in this place on a Wednesday and it was deserted. Only two customers that looked like friends of the waitress. The waitress didn't even realize that my friend and I was there until she glanced over and saw us that we already seated ourselves. Didn't even greeted us. Gave us the menus and left. She went back the to bar and kept talking to her \"friends\" . When we knew what to order i had to wave her down and called out really loud to get her attention.  Waited on the wings for 10 minutes. Wings arrived and it was bad. The wings were small and the chicken just tasted weird. My friend said the same thing with hers. Waitress never back to check up on us. We ate at least three wings and stopped and payed our bills.  Never again."}
{"text":"Let me just start by saying that I genuinely enjoy Wild Wings (other locations) and this was my first time at this location. 

Now onto the food..

The food was seriously so mediocre. I ordered the spicy gar par wings (usually my go-to fave), my boyfriend ordered the hot honey wings, and we ordered jalapeno poppers as well. The wait was a bit long but we didn't mind at all. The wings came out first. Upon first glance, I could tell something was seriously off about my spicy gar par wings. First of all, there was barely any sauce on it... It honestly looked like they put 3 drops of hot sauce, and lightly sprinkled it with parmesan. It tasted so dry and salty. On the plus side, my boyfriend's hot honey wings were pretty good! Wasn't lacking in sauce at all. I kept reaching for his cause mine were so bad. 

The jalapeno poppers (which came out last because they forget our order) were pretty good. No complaints there.

All in all, I was seriously disappointed with the spicy gar par and I will not be returning to this location for that reason."}
{"text":"Each wild wing franchise varies.  At this neighborhood joint, it's filled with locals eating and watching tonight's Raptors game.   They have TVs at almost every angle.   The waiter was courteous.   

The downside is the food.   Compared to other wild wings, I find their spicy gar par wings lacking.   It's primarily made of ranch, parm and hot sauce.   Unfortunately, they put a lot of ranch and very little hot sauce.   It's not mixed together well.   The fries also tend to be soft despite just coming onto our table.   

We only go because it's so convenient and the husband has an insatiable wing craving.   But we feel disappointed the last four visits with the preparation of the food.   We always say we'll go somewhere else..... But then we forget and end up here again. 

Three stars"}
{"text":"I went to have dinner on a Saturday night not busy at all I was very disappointed with the service and food. I order nachos to start wings and a cesar salad. After the long wait Over 25 mins I got 1st my salad then came my nachos after my wings by the time I was done with my nachos the wings were cold I didn't get any napkin as my server was to busy flirting with the men/her friends at the bar. The salad was  drenched with Cesar I have pictures as well of this. I was so disappointed with wild wing service I paid the $60 but I can  guarantee I will not be back again."}
{"text":"Wow, lots of bad reviews below and I'm not sure why. I had a totally fine experience. 

Dropped in after catching a show at Yuk Yuk's. Server was a little distant at first but warmed up quickly and was attentive. Asked her to mix me up some kind of cocktail and she brought a lemonade cocktail which was delicious! 

Food wise - ordered my standard (pound of boneless). Food came out quickly but with no sauce (basic of wings!) No big deal though, I requested it and the server brought it out. 

No complaints at all."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a Friday night.  The place was busy but not packed.  We were able to get a high top table right away.  Our server came over for our drink order immediately.

We ordered 2 pints of Belgian Moon on tap, but unfortunately it was flat.  We informed our server and she quickly replaced them with fresh ones.  Apparently, it was the end of the keg.  The new ones were much better!

We ordered a triple order of wings that came with 3 flavours.  We got medium, honey BBQ and Bonnie & Clyde.  They were all really good, but I thought the medium could've used a bit more heat.  One thing to note though.. the single and double order of wings comes with fries, but anything that's triple and up does not come with fries!

To end, service was great, food was good."}
{"text":"Came in on a Tuesday night at 10 PM after a movie looking for some half-price wings for a snack. Wild Wing was nearby, so we made our way over. Website says half-price tuesdays. Specials menu on the wall says half-price tuesdays. Place was going to close in an hour, but that should be enough, so we went in.

Dead empty. Never seen a place so empty on wings night. There were maybe two customers in total, and they seemed to be having difficulty getting service because the waitress was standing behind the doors to the kitchen and sometimes looking out to see if anyone needs anything. Or, in our case, see if someone's waiting at the door.

We were seated near the front, and the waitress heads back to the kitchen for whatever reason.

The restaurant doesn't look too bad. Nice, polished wood look. Menu didn't look bad either: lots of options to choose from. Their tuesday wings price only applied to their single-pound; I guess they didn't like having to sell too many wings or something.

When the waitress came back, she informed us that the tuesday wings deal was done for the night and finished at 10 PM. Well, there goes that.

We walked out."}
{"text":"Since the new management team came the quality really worsened. I'm sad because I really liked this place :("}
{"text":"We came in here on a rainy day, attracted by large flat screens on the night of a hockey game.

The atmosphere is comfortable, like a small town bar. Lots of booths and wooden tables and chairs with horseshoes burned/spraypainted into them.

They have have the usual \"60+ flavours\" like any wing place, which usually means 60 permutations of 10 different ingredients. Nonetheless the wings were not bad for the price. The Huz had a chicken wrap with delightfully crispy fries. I also ordered some bruschetta which unfortunately came out very soggy and salty. This is a decent place to watch a game when the food is secondary, but I won't be going back just for the food.

One thing that struck me was that there was free wifi. That's a plus when you want to get your devices sticky."}
{"text":"I ordered the new Apple chicken salad in a nacho bowl. 4 tiny pieces of chicken, barely any dressing and the bowl was over fried so it was super greasy. 

My colleague had the chicken sandwich, again small pieces of chicken. 

The waitress didn't check on us then at the end she asked how the food was, we told her. Oh sorry about that, I'll tell the kitchen. I said I would have told you but you didn't come by and our lunch is overdue now. In terms of wait time for a new order. No discount on the food was given to us. 

Not going back."}
{"text":"Not too shabby place to enjoy some wings.

The wings were pretty good, the second to hottest flavour was *pretty* hot, but I was really hoping that it would burn my face off.

The place is comfy, with big windows and friendly service.

It's a good place for wings if you're in the area, but nothing special."}
{"text":"Tried to order on March 18th. A guy answers and asks if I can hold. Leaves me on hold for over 5 minutes. I decide to call back and nobody answers my calls for over 15 minutes. I decide to start making a dinner at home just in case (while still calling them to see if I someone will pick up the phone). I make a full dinner at home and still nobody picks up the phone. So for over 45 minutes now this restaurant has not taken a phone order during prime dinner hours do they not think that might be odd and should check their phones?

The wings are not that great to begin with but I had a craving for wings. In this economy forget ever getting my business. I'll go out of our neighborhood to pick up good wings."}
{"text":"We've been to this location a few times but I'm not sure why. The food is alright but the service is always horrible and slow and it's not because they're busy because I've never seen more than 3 tables in here at any given time. They are understaffed and aren't very friendly.  The turnover rate for employees must be quite high because I've never seen the same waitress twice. Today when we asked for the bill we were informed that their debit system was down and after waiting 15 more minutes we were informed that we should \"walk to a bank and get money.\" I won't be back to this one again...and I mean it this time."}
{"text":"Ordered with JustEat but came in for pick-up because I live close by and I'm actually surprised with how smooth everything went!

I got a lb of honey garlic + garpar wings and fries with dill sauce. When I got there, everything was prepared and ready to go at the specified time. By the time I was back at home seated and ready to eat, my food was overall still nicely warmed. The fries were just mediocre (a little too starchy) but the wings were large, juicy, and super saucy - just the way I like them! 

A carrot and celery were packaged separately in another plastic bag along with the dill sauce and everything was kept clean and tidy. I was provided with several wet wipes, napkins, and a handful of packets of ketchup.

Overall, I'm fairly happy with my experience."}
{"text":"Certainly can't argue with the selection of sauces (101 flavours). And a personal favourite is the fried dill pickles."}
{"text":"just walking along and there it was, complete with a patio.  Who can resist wings on a patio?  Not me.  So we pulled up a seat.  Shortly after, the waitress took our order, and put the umbrella over the table.  The service was fast and polite.  Our wings arrived just in time for the rain but the shelter of the umbrella still made it a pleasurable experience.  So many choices on their menu so i will have to come back soon."}
{"text":"Wild wings is always a dependable, consistent joint to get your classic wings! 

Service [5/5]: once you sit down, you will be approached by your server right away to place your order (plus). Once placing your food order, the food comes in 10 minutes. Big shoutout to our server Kristina who met all of our needs and went above and beyond!

Space [4/5]: the space is small so if you go during busy time (ie. a big sports game) it will be harder for you to get a spot.

Food [4.5/5]: the wings are the perfect size! I prefer getting the boneless wings since they are more filling. The classic wings are definitely not the same wing size as  the traditional buffalo wing from Buffalo,NY. The meat is super juicy!! The fries are the exact same as Costco which is a big plus since they are crispy. The only downfalls are that the blue cheese portion is smaller than a true wing joint from Buffalo as well as there was very few veggies given with each meal. Tip: if you like really hot wings, get the \"She's a hottie\"...you definitely will need a lot of beer with these!"}
{"text":"Can you believe that I came here and didn't eat wings?! 

We came because we wanted to grab a drink in the area and catch the hockey game. The place was full of other hockey fans. It was a fun, loud environment and the wings looked good. I'll definitely check them out next time I'm there.

Service was super friendly, and there's free wifi with a password."}
{"text":"lots of selection, decent service, cold beverages.  Whats not to like.  I had the teriyaki wings and my guest had the medium bbq, and we shared some fries, veggies & dip.  Wings were awesome, fries were OK, veggies were OK.  But its not called wild fries and veggies for a reason i suppose."}
{"text":"Wild wings always offers daily special item.  Their website tells all. 

Wings are half priced off on Tuesdays. We came for this special deal and ordered three single flavors wings ( good ).   We also ordered calamari (taste so so), butter chicken poutine (new item a great taste), veggie spaghetti (definitely worse than TV dinner, believe me) 

Beers are good, no doubt. Service is adequate and short staffed. Beside wings and beers. Nothing is really outstanding at Wild Wings

will return for wings and beers. You can eat other items elsewhere.  :)"}
{"text":"Service is unsatisfactory.  The waitress did not want to have anything to do with us. With so many wing options, I asked for a little help. She began to help, then said \"why don't you guys decide and I'll come back\" before I could order, and I'm not slow.  Wings were scrawny but good, not good enough to remember. We never got our refills. We asked for ranch, we had to remind the waitress twice, got the ranch when we were on our last wings..um, yeah."}
{"text":"Pretty good experience here. Ordered a couple different kinds of wings and they were great. Also really enjoyed their Gar Par fries. All food was fresh and tasty. The atmosphere was nice. Even when it filled up a bit, it didn't seem too busy. The server was extremely nice and kept checking on us. Overall, really enjoyed myself."}
{"text":"I'm a regular i don't always check in when i go because i often have hands covered in sauce ;) tasty place OK $ and nice to have a beer and a chat there."}
{"text":"The takeout here is horrendous. I love wild wings but the cook here does not know all the flavors or something. I keep ordering the dirty nelly and sometimes they put bbq sauce in it sometimes they don't which sounds fine but dirty nelly is supposed to INCLUDE bbq sauce. The fries portion is completely random. Some days you get a lot of fries some days they skimp on it. Also for some reason these guys do not include forks or cutlery, which would be nice."}
{"text":"Your standard wing chain.

We came twice for dinner. The first time, the service was pretty bad, the second time our server was lovely. Wings are decent, if a bit overcooked, and the hot sauces are actually pretty hot. This isa  good spot if you like the whole million types of flavours thing. 

Fries are nice and crispy. 

It's not my first choice for wings, but it'll do in a pinch."}
{"text":"This place operates, kind of like a joke. The manager must seriously lack knowledge of how to operate a restaurant because the place was packed and had two servers. The servers tried their best to serve a huge table plus other tables but they were stressed.  One even complained to me and other customers about the bad customers they had. They even swore openly, in a joking way, but just because I look young doesn't mean I appreciate unprofessionalism. This apparently is a regular occurrence of the restaurant being understaffed. A regular customer said he had to step up and help serve and buss tables to help the servers out before. And he's done this several times. He probably has a crush on one of these severs or both but geez. What a joke! And I think that is definitely illegal. I asked did he get paid and he just said got extra drinks! He was being honest. Damn. 

The problem is Tuesday may normally be slow in the winter but Wild Wings caters to a sports crowd, as in sports teams, plural. The place gets hopping after games. Baseball and maybe soccer. The owner needs to get more staff on board because the two girls working were stressed out. 

The food was standard pub food. Lots of frozen stuff and a gross Greek salad with too much feta and dressing. Ugh. Just order drinks but they may have trouble until they get at least one more person in. 

Avoid this place like the plague until the manager (whoever that is) and the owner learn to run a restaurant properly. 

Styles Out"}
{"text":"After work meet up place.  Enjoying company and a pint.  Friendly staff and consistency in food quality keep us coming back but they should plan for sudden busy times.  Love the way they make it better when service is a bit slow.  Food is great...want wings?  Come here, wild wing on yonge!"}
{"text":"We gave Wild Wing a try on Victoria Day. Normally holidays are very hit and miss for restaurants. We have to say that this Wild Wing lived up to the challenge.

 Our server (who was the only one most of the night) did above and beyond. She was quick, friendly, obliging and helpful throughout the night (even brewing a coffee rather than the pod machine).

Food was served in a prompt manner ( even asking ahead how we prefer the apps and main served). 

This was 2nd time at this location - and while the food was of similar quality and taste (athough 4 is really not that hot, and the 3 we had was hotter than any of the 4s), the server raised the bar.

Recommended."}
{"text":"Good selection of sauces, and good size wings! One of my local go to spots on a Tuesday."}
{"text":"The franchisee of this location just doesn't care and it shows.  Tables are sticky and dirty ditto for the floor..washroom needs a good scrubbing.  Food is mediocre, again you can tell he doesn't care...wing sauce was thrown together and had no flavor.  Wings were tiny and not value for what we paid.  Side of fries were skimpy and the topping was thrown on as an afterthought.  Service was abysmal.  Please don't waste your money on this place."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place - it's in my neighbourhood, it's good for groups, and there's a pool table. But the food was beyond terrible. Worst nachos I've ever had ($15); terrible calamari ($11 for 10 pieces), and okay wings ($26). There are better places to go for this type of food and for better prices. Wild wings - please shape up, or make way for a better establishment to take over your prime location."}
{"text":"Being a huge wing fan and having chicken or chicken by -products account for roughly 75% of my diet, I was incredibly excited when opportunity came a knock'in to enjoy a deep fried feast at Wild Wings in New Market a few weeks back.  After driving over two hours in horrific winter conditions to meet up with a friend from Trinidad I was more than happy to oblige him in sampling some Wild Wings.

My mouth watered with Pavlovian anticipation as we neared the restaurant entrance.  With a plethora of aptly named sauces from the mundane to the bizarre I thought that my only challenge would be settling upon one, not having to force myself to choke down the monstrosity of a meal that was set before me. I settled on the boneless dinner which includes one order of boneless chicken nugget pieces, fries and a drink.  I decided to try the \"Jamaican me crazy\" jerk sauce.  The pieces arrived almost cold and also sans sauce.  The fries were soggy and the pop flat.  

I do realize that we were eating at roughly 10:00pm in the middle of a snow storm in New Market, yet absolutely zero effort was made to even attempt and serve something palatable.  The only thing that separates Wild Wings and other sub standard wing chains is the attempt at giving all their sauces cute names.  They failed to deliver on every and all fronts.  I will never set foot through the doors of another Wild Wings as long as I live."}
{"text":"Ordered the Poutine and pint deal for 10.99, not so much a deal because it cost just about the same.. Fries were slightly over cooked and seemed like they were trying to cover it up with lots of gravy and cheese. Quite disappointed at that, but did like my friends fish n' chips. So-so experience.. The first time I came was better. Server was pushing us to pay the bill because her shift was done.. What if I don't want to pay yet or still want to order more? I'll stick to All-star wings since I work close by."}
{"text":"The wings were really good, but both times I've been there the waitresses have been quite rude. But it was definitely worth it for the wings!"}
{"text":"While I used to be a regular of the Kitchener location, I am not as much a fan of the Calgary location as of yet! That being said, they are a new venue and certainly need to learn a couple of things - they could certainly take tips from the franchise owner in KW!

The wonderful thing about Wild Wing is truly the variety of choices you have. While some are ultra-saucy (and I frequently request that they go light on the sauce! BEWARE! If you dislike soupy wings - ask them to go easy on it if you order anything with their Gar-Par or blue cheese sauce! Sorry Wendy!), others are quite dry, it all depends on how you like it.

My personal preference is not even on their list of 102 flavours, and they happily abide by my request to have it anyway - I order Maple & Hot almost every time I go - in between Catch Me If You Can (Very Hot & Maple) and Deperado (Medium & Maple).

The real day to go is Thursday - Pint and a Pound for $13. And a pound of wings isn't ten skimpy wings, it averages out to 9 per pound, and they are meat galore. I would like to see the chickens that the wings and legs come off of because they are a little large! That being said, they know not to go after the $0.25 wing fans - these wings are fairly monstrous, and you will be hard pressed to finish a second pound.

The biggest drawbacks? They haven't quite figured out that the bone-buckets on the table are a little disgusting by most people's standards (stick to plates! seriously, one plate per person is much less gross than a Corona beer bucket), and for some unknown reason, they haven't figured out they need to build a better wall to zone off the front door from the cold! Sit far back near the washrooms or near the bar, not near the door - there are no groups sitting there for a reason.

All in all - good wings, great service, a little cold but it is a good spot that has not quite taken off yet."}
{"text":"There are only 2 places in Toronto that I go to wings for... All Star Wings, and Wild Wings.  The All Star Wings restaurants are a little too far for me because I live in Scarborough, so for the most part I am now a die hard Wild Wings fan.  My favourites are Gar Par and Farmer's Daughter.  The wings are well-marinated, and very delicious... I won't go anywhere else for wings anymore..."}
{"text":"Its just average, good service, food was decent, could had more sause but in the end it was filling and great.

Came in on thrusday for lunch, not that busy maybe a dozen during my stay. The waitress was great. Nothing special but nothing to make it look bad. Good location

Edit*Feb 25 2016.

Upgraded my rating for 3 to 4 because of the Waitress Lily. Rarely do I see such good service and  personality"}
{"text":"*100th Review*

Its your standard wing places. I usually just come here for the Tuesday or Thursday deals which are good. Good is usually good, sometimes their wings don't have enough sauce or heat but they have no issue to take them back and add more.

Outside of sauce or heat, their wings are usually good.

The service maybe lacking sometime there is only one person working and she usually at bar 70%"}
{"text":"Ordered a plate of wings and bruchetta ...took an hour and half to get food...and the place wasn't that busy. Ridiculous. Will not be back"}
{"text":"I have been to this location once before when it was wild wing.  Like the other reviewers mention - do not be fooled - this is not the same restaurant as it used to be.  Maybe same management, but the quality is not even close to acceptable.

We ordered a Friday \"Wing and Rib\" special.  The wings were smaller than usual, one was almost half the size of what the wings use to look like at Wild Wing.  The taste was \"ok\" - and the ribs were fine, but we later got mild food poisoning.

Long story short - no wing and rib combo is worth a sleepless night consisting of multiple trips to the bathroom, and the feeling like you have to vomit but can't.  

While I have scored this restaurant one star, I feel that this is even a stretch. Stay away from Wind Hub!!!!!!"}
{"text":"good wings (not as many flavours as all-stars) ... the service was on point (waitress nice and friendly) and the tv placement was optimal for watching sports ... will take pics next time i visit ... we had a group of 8 and shared nachos as an app along with a hundred wngs (got to pick 10 flavours)"}
{"text":"This place is not as bad as the overall ratings! It's chicken wings! Beer! Big screen tvs! What more do you want? Yes the waitresses sit at the cash and play with their hair as they wait for a customer to call them over. But they also ask you if you want stuff and then charge for it on the side! I love the choices and this location gives you fries for free (some locations charge extra for fries). The service is friendly and overall the experience is better than some places in this part of Etobicoke! Feeling adventurous? There is a suicide flavour.  Good luck if you try it!!!   There are over 100 choices for wings! Breaded or non breaded! Go for the wings, stay for the beer."}
{"text":"Where's the chicken!

If you enjoy deep fried bread, this is the place for you!  

If you enjoy some form of meat on the chicken wings you order, this is not..."}
{"text":"I would never recommend eating here even if you were starving !

1. The management was eating dinner slouched behind the bar with noodles hanging out of her mouth, that's not an exaggeration. It was like a child eating, I was disgusted.

2. The cook came out from the kitchen wearing slippers and no socks, dragging his feet like he just woke up. You could see him in the back through the kitchen doors, walking and talking on his cell phone.

3. Atmosphere was depressing and tv at the table was filthy dirty. I can guarantee it was never cleaned.

If I could rate this a no star I would. It was so bad I created a yelp account just to warn others."}
{"text":"Ordered Caeser salad wrap and paid the additional for chicken. I think I must of paid for s malnourished slither of chicken for $4 or $5. The food took quite a while which I don't if that was a tactic to try and convince is to get a drink. Your known for your wings at least make them something to talk about rather just tasting like just some wings."}
{"text":"Decent wings, much better than a All Star.  Waitress recommended onion rings with caesar dressing and Parmesan, which was a surprisingly good combination."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try Wild Wings for a bit now. Finally convinced my fianc√©e today was the day!!

We entered into the restaurant and had it all to ourselves! Not a soul in sight.. I thought this could be bad or this could be good.

I ordered the spicy gar par and my other half ordered hang 'em high. I wasn't a fan of the spicy gar par. I didn't find them medium in any sense and a tad on the creamy side. Like too creamy in a way. The good thing? The wings were cooked perfectly. I tried a wing from the hang 'em high and they were not that good either. The dry rub was focused one one spot of the wings and you were left with battered wing on the other half.

I think it was worth the try but you can catch me at all star wings next time I need some wings."}
{"text":"The only option for delivery was to order online. The food arrived after an hour and 45 mins. It was 45 minutes later than promised. The food was cold and soggy. Now I have the joy of reheating my food in the oven. Never ordering from wild wing again. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch on a Thursday with a crew of 6. The place was deserted.  Restroom were not kept. The food took quite some time to arrive. Meager portions.
If you are in that area, just get into the mall and go the food court."}
{"text":"Wow. Absolutely terrible service.

I cant comment on the food because I didnt manage to order any. I went and sat at the bar on a very slow night with plenty of staff around. I waited for 15 minutes without a server or bartender even speaking to me. They wouldnt even make eye contact as I tried to get their attention. After that amount of time I just got up and left. They didnt say anything or attempt to stop me then either.

Message to the management: You have a terrible restaurant and I hope it closes down because you dont deserve to be in business."}
{"text":"Waited 30 mins and never got served. I only recommend coming here if you don't want to eat!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Tuesday because I had a craving for wings and it was close to home. I think we arrived around 8:45pm. Two servers on the floor with someone I assume is the owner/manager watching the happenings of his restaurant. No host/hostess to seat us. We had to wait for a server to free up. 

The restaurant wasn't busy, but there were a few tables enjoying the Tuesday night wing deal. We weren't greeted or anything, but was able to place our order in one go when we got the attention of our/a server. 

While we waited for our food, we watched as the owner/manager tried to drop food off at the wrong tables. Constantly. Come on, your restaurant isn't big. There's no reason to mix table numbers up like that. We waited around 45 minutes for our wings, which is grossly long for a place that wasn't that busy and our food didn't require any skill - just throw everything into the deep fryer and toss it in some sauce.

When we finally got our wings, I was pretty annoyed that we had to wait that long. No utensils were given at the time of order, so we had to ask. For wings that took 45 minutes, I expected them to be piping hot, but they were only slightly warm at best. The fries had an interesting texture, like they had been frozen and defrosted a few times - they were sandy and dry on the inside, if that makes sense. No one checked on us to see how we were doing or if we needed anything else.

After all was said and done, we left the restaurant at about 10:30pm, which was much later than we would have liked, since we ate our food within half an hour. I chose this place thinking it would be a quick in and out bite, but I was very wrong. Not sure if I would ever come back."}
{"text":"This reincarnation of Wild Wing hasn't changed much since its acquisition. If you've been here before when it used to be Wild Wing, you can't really tell the difference.

The listing of the 69 flavours lacks a \"fun factor\" and while they seem to be categorized in groups, each group could use some sort of nickname or even a title for that matter. The friends I was with didn't feel like braving it out and trying something different, and refused to go over a 2 (on a scale of 5). We ended up sharing 30 wings, half honey garlic, half cajun. As mentioned by previous Yelpers, the wings were heavily loaded with batter, but definitely packed with flavour.

The only thing that was really missing was a bucket for the bones! But if you need your wings fix, this place will suffice."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a change and because of the wings which I have had numerous times at the Ajax location. 

Walking in I was struck by two things

1) no one else was in there.  It was 6:00 pm it was empty.  During our meal there were two take out orders

2) for a western (old western theme) in the middle of the bar is an electric Palm tree and parrot. It did not fit literally as the server had to negotiate around it. 

The meal:  

We ordered the bacon, cheddar, broccoli bites.  Very tasty but so wished there could have been more dip I asked for more and the container was 1/2 filled.  Which was more than the ketchup bottle on the table.  

The main was two batches of wings.   One wet - Diana's BBQ sauce and One dry - Hickory, dickory, doc

Both were good and fresh.  Before we started my spouse notices a sign.  

Happy Hour: buy 1, get one free on appetisers Mon- Thursday  4:00 pm to 7:00 pm. 

I wondered why she had not mentioned this.  So after we had emptied our pops.  I walked up to the bar for a refill and asked, \"Is the Happy Hour?\"

Our server who I interrupted texting on her phone and nibbling on a power bar.  Said yes.  So I ordered another batch of broccoli bites.  

I was disappointed having to ask for a refill and about a special that she did not mention. 

But we didn't get any follow up.  She did not ask about the meal, nor about refills and even didn't offer us a wet nap to clean up. 

Nice food, crappy service."}
{"text":"Walked out!!! Do not recommend going here. Divey inside which would be okay if the servers were at least nice. Nope. She was unfriendly & unwelcoming. Waited and waited for her to take our drink order. Only a couple brands of beer. Menus scribbled on with hand printing. Wings start at $14. Doesn't say if it's a dozen, half dozen or a pound. So who knows what you're getting. $14 for wings down town, sure. $14 for wings in a parking lot in Scarborough on an ugly patio, not happening. Skip going here."}
{"text":"TL;DR: World Cup, Mediocre food; Terrible server swore at us. 

Though I never expect that much from establishments such as wild wing, this one takes the cake. 
The one star here is simply to denote that Yelp doesn't allow lower scores. 

Ambience: 2/5
Came here to watch a world cup game as while other bars were totally packed, wild wing was able to seat 8 (that should have been a red flag, right there). The world cup turns even the slums of Rio into a party, so in parallel, wild wings was a slum-turned-party. 

Food: 3/5
Mediocre, and not cheap. An ice tea, crispy chicken sandwich (with yam fries), and 1 lb wings were pennies under 30$ after tax.
Nothing wrong with the food... just not all that great. Pretty standard for a wild wing.

Service: 0/5 - in fact, -5/5
this one may be my front runner of WORST SERVER EVER! Didn't even catch her name, but keep an eye out for crimped blond hair, thick eye liner, and a lot of lip gloss. 
She only took orders from one person at a time (despite the fact that she had a note pad). Not even sections of our 8 person group. Only one person. BF and I weren't allowed to order together (though we were sharing), because she said there were too many people in our group. There was a minimum 5 minute wait between order/ person. 
A few of us asked for water, which she said was not possible because they were out of cups and glasses. When we saw water go out to other tables with other servers, a friend and I went up to the bar to ask for water. The bartender (here on: water-server) gave us an odd look and told us of course they had cups. 
Server never came by to check on us- in fact, water-server took the initiative to drop off a pitcher of water before our actual server ever came back.
She complained to the water-server about having to serve us (while standing over our table)- saying it was not fair that she had to serve the big group (notably, there were other 8+ groups there. Split up between the 3 servers). 
The final topper was while trying to settle the bill, she complained to each of us about how much work it was to split the bill, and how it was not normal to split the bill at wild  wing, and how it make things much more difficult and complicated for her. Then, she miscounted the number of drinks (counting 5 ciders instead of 4). THEN (and here's the kicker) she told my friend who was last to pay that since it was punched in she would have to \"f*cking pay for it [her]self\" and \"someone at the table is a f*cking liar\". I wish I were exaggerating.
I know wild wing isn't the classiest of joints (and I don't expect it to be) but that seems to be a little much for me. Call me old fashion, but I really don't think it's appropriate to swear at, and complain about customers while they're still sitting in front of you (save that for the back room!).

Water-server told me that the manager/ owner wasn't in today. And BF picked up our tab, despite my griping about not tipping and leaving a note as to why. So, I guess the best I can do is to put my experience on yelp in an attempt to save other people from Wild Wing on King, and never ever go back. 

I hope this server finds something she likes to do more and that this wild wing becomes something a little classier, like a Hooters."}
{"text":"I get take out from this location often, and they do a great job getting my order correct and fast. And I'm obsessed with Gar Par sauce!!!"}
{"text":"Husband and I live in the area and thought we'd try this place out.  Saturday night around 8:00pm, not a busy time.  Ordered a Caeser and was told they have no Worcestershire sauce and no celery salt.  Fine. Ordered a vodka and water with 2 lime slices. Was told no limes.  Not very happy at this point.  I ended up having to go to the bar myself to find out what was going on.  The owner, Amrit, was rude when I asked him why there's no limes as there is a Food basics in the same plaza.  Said yes there's limes, and about 5 minutes later comes out with brown limes that have been on the shelf so long they have indents from sitting there.  Disgusting.  Ordered wings.  Undercooked. At this point I was fed up, and paid $50 for a beer, a drink I couldn't drink, and 2lbs of questionably cooked wings. We asked the waitress if we could speak with the manager, but he was busy having drinks with someone.  The funniest part was he sent his beer back to the bar because there wasn't enough head on the beer. But he will serve mouldy limes to a paying customer.  Avoid this place at all costs.  Go to Burger King for a chicken sandwich and the beer store for a 6 pack --- it will be a better meal than anything you get at this dump."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and good food. It was nice that they were open on labour day too. As someone who works all holidays, it's nice to still be able have a hot meal on the holidays. They were all impressed that my buddy ate the number six wings as if it was ketchup. He then added homemade ghost pepper sauce to it. Would eat there again no problem. Wish they played country or at least some classic rock in a western themed wing place...whatever the heck that \"new music\" is they play doesn't fit the atmosphere."}
{"text":"What else can I say, it's wings. Love the flavours."}
{"text":"Buyer beware!

Went here for a quick bite the other night. 2 of us split 3 lbs of wings and had one beer apiece. Tasty wings! But I just checked my credit card online today and the bill was way above what it should've been (roughly $20 higher)

In hindsight the barmaid deliberately kept me distracted while I was punching away at the debit machine. Sneaky hobbitses!!

Anyway, congrats on the bilking, but you just lost 2 customers who will never come back to your location."}
{"text":"Lots of wings to pick from, great place for a beer and a game too.   

They have over 101 flavors.  Come get some"}
{"text":"I've been to a lot of wing places (for work, social, etc.) and this place is one of the so-so ones.
I really like how the waitresses are nice and caring but the quality of wings could be better."}
{"text":"My wife and sat down for some wings. Gave the waitress our order 5 minutes she came back asking us to move tables because a large party came in and she needed our table. So we moved then people who came in after us were served first, 40 minutes later we got our wings they were barely warm. Very crappy service will never go back there.
Wingporium on Islington and Queensway 
If you feel like driving way better quality and service...."}
{"text":"I came here on a Sunday night after failing to get a table at All Star Wings. It was empty when my group an I arrived, with only one table occupied. 

We all ordered wings and I liked that it came with fries. While we were waiting for our order, I started noticing a washroom/sulfur smell and everyone noticed it too. The smell was still there even as we were leaving. One other thing that bothered me was the washrooms were single washrooms but there was no lock on the door.

The food was very lacklustre and the wings reminded me of frozen breaded wings you'd get at a grocery store. 

Overall, I would give the food one star and another star for the service. This place was dead for a reason and I definitely would not recommend this place at all."}
{"text":"The waiter was tired and mid recommended some wings to my friend that were just plain terrible. It was clear my food wasn't tossed they just sprinkled the lemon pepper on top. Overall really poor place"}
{"text":"We had a quick dinner here last night before catching a movie. 
Severs are nice. Food is ok. We had a variety of wing dinners. 
Would I eat here again? Sure."}
{"text":"I stopped in here one night and doubt I'd give it another try.  Their menu overreaches and is confusing as all hell.  They have a gazillion combinations of sauces and they seem to be all over the map.  

When the wings arrived, their sizes vared from decent to minuscule-hidden-in-breading, and seemed re-heated, as in the bones separate too easily from each other, etc.  The sauce was typical wing sauce, but a bit tart and vinegary.  The breading on the wings themselves was a bit tasteless and seemed to serve only to soak up the sauce and fall the hell off of everything.

The only positive about this experience was the server was sweet and tried to be helpful, and the beer was ice cold and flowed large."}
{"text":"Service was good. 

Food was decent.  Wing sauce was good.  The appetizers could have been less \"manufactured\". 

Overall, if you're looking for decent enough food with lots of selection it is worth checking out."}
{"text":"The service is decent and the food is blah. Ordered 3 orders of wings and it came back with 9 skimpy small wings for each flavour. They do not commit to measure portions to pounds or # of wings. Worst wing place ever. Not worth the money!"}
{"text":"Every single time I've been to wild wing I've had some sort of issue or another. I do the wait is extremely long or the wings come out super overcooked and over done or the fact that there's just not enough sauce on them. I have literally never had a great experience at wild wing and it's extremely extremely disappointing. As much as I love wings I really miss back home in the US going to Buffalo wild wings which was clearly a shining star. The prices were a lot better and the fact that they would be a lot more open to using multiple sauce flavors."}
{"text":"Wings are tasty, but range from small to average sized, but single serve portions are small (7-8 pieces).  Comes with fries, 2 celery sticks and two carrot sticks.  Fries are tasty, but I came for the wings.

Tuesday half price deal is only for single serve wings. One drink, one half priced single served wings.  I know that's how the deal is worded, but the last time I ordered, they let two people share a three pound order. To strictly enforce the deal and say the terms of the deal right when you sit down took my excitement away. Only one sauce? Only one pound? I guess if you order a pitcher, they may give you two pounds. I wanted two pounds but only one drink this night.  I think it's smarter to just let one person order two pounds right off the bat, then maybe I'd be more likely to stick around and order more drinks. Note that service here is sloooowwwww, so you will most likely be on your second drink before the one pound comes out. That's another reason they should just let you order two pounds right off the bat.

Anyway, I left disappointed with only one pound and one flavour eaten. Also, the server came back twice not knowing the order.  However, she did explain that she was new. She gave us dill sauce instead of blue cheese. She mixed up our orders so my companion ate one of my wings! Ughhh lol because there's only one pound per person, I got possessive over my pound. 

The layout of the place isn't attractive, tall daunting ceilings, minimal character, the vibe is very detached. It feels like a warehouse rather than a restaurant or bar.  If you sit by the doors during the winter on either side or the middle, you will be very uncomfortable with wild gusts of wind blowing every time someone comes in.

Anyway, if you if come here for the Tuesday wing deal, be prepared to drink, otherwise, have one pound and leave your appetite at home."}
{"text":"Came here to watch a pay-per-view boxing event and it was all right.  Some of the television had the caption, which was useful.  The place has a patio, but it wasn't utilized the time I went there.  The place is quite small and have a couple of medium sized TV's.

As for the food, I've been to a couple of Wild Wings before, but it was my first time at this location.  The wings were pretty good.  This locations seems to have normal, smaller sized wings than the Heartland location, which I prefer.  I had the lemon garlic garlic dry wings and they are pretty good!  Great crispness to the wings.  Some wings places seem to have wings that the bone just breaks when you pick it up, which is not appetizing.  Service is decent.  I would go back and try them again."}
{"text":"This was an interesting stop on a very late night of a weekend trip to Toronto. One of our friends really wanted to come here because of promotion they had going- a free glass when you ordered that particular brand of beer. They were out. 

We were a large group, but the place was dead, so we you'd think they'd be happy to get some business and some tips... not so. 

We ordered food and it came out in really odd mismatched ways... someone would get a side order of their meal, then someone from the opposite end would get their main. It took a really long time for everyone's food to finally arrive, and even then, we had a random extra fries that we had to negotiate that we weren't paying for since we didn't order them. We also struggled to get our drinks. The waitress kept forgetting several of us, even though she had supposedly written them down multiple times. 

She then spilled a full tray of drinks (with my drink on it-sad). At this point I was starting to feel bad for her, until we realized that she didn't ever intend to clean it up. At all. And didn't, even when asked. So all night, the people sitting on the benches had to jump over this pool of sticky mixed alcohol to get in and out. Luckily she warned us that \"she wouldn't step there if she were us.\" 

I did eventually get my drink, but don't even get me started on trying to get another round. The food was actually pretty good, which is why I rated so high! A friend and I shared some appetizers including the sampler platter. I loved the pizza stick things. 

I'm not sure if we'll be back- we might give it another try when we're in town and cross our fingers for a different waitress!"}
{"text":"One of the FIRST restaurants that opened in this semi NEW Eagle's Landing Plaza, it took establishment at the inside corner where at this point the plaza is still somewhat deserted. 

Both times I came for wings where the first was to TRY, which meant partaking in the WINGS SAMPLER PLATTER. As you know by now I DID try the Raspberry flavour as well and it simply did not work for my taste palette, however the other flavours did not do much better either. Second time we went for TRIPLE but as before it lacked the mouth-feel, maybe it was the texture or something. 

I think I began to lose faith in this place already but like I noted in a discussion before, I come here when I feel like being a COWBOY. Aside from Montana's having this type of decor, Wild Wings does a great job of Wild West meets Sports Bar. 

This place even has a few of those video games at the Bar where you can play Card games or Mix & Match while watching the sports game displayed on large LCD behind the bar. 

So there are somethings Wild Wings does that make them UNIQUE at least for now, but this difference doesn't target me any better than other more successful WINGS places."}
{"text":"Not sure why the negative reviews.  Based on my experience on Saturday night, it was a satisfactory visit.  The portions were good and the wings came out nice and hot.  Service was friendly - it was about 80% full and environment was decent.  It's no michellin star restaurant but it does provide decent wings."}
{"text":"Just had the worst service I have ever had. Sat for 10 minutes before we were even acknowledged. No menus. Waitress finally got off her cellphone and came to the table and said she doesn't start her shift for another 10 minutes but will serve us. Lucky us!  
Took our order. Brought the food and no silverware. Waited 5 minutes for a fork. When she brought our wings a free basket of fries were brought as an apology. Wow. Never checked on us once during the meal. 
We were done eating and watched the waitress eating pizza behind the bar while we sat for 15 more minutes waiting to get our bill.  I have waitressed for 16 years. Usually tip 20 to 25%.  Left her 0 on debit. she was complaining as she walked away all the while not knowing if I was going to leave cash.  See you never know who your customer may be.  Her loss. Maybe she should chose another career because she sucks at waitressing."}
{"text":"I like the wild wings brand, probably the best wings place in their category for wings restaurant/bar, but this location isn't the best when it comes to service. The food is solid here, sometimes too saucy. But you don't get great service from the waiters as you would at other wild wings"}
{"text":"Been there a few times servers are great foods great but one time I ordered the rubs I've gotten them before and loved them but this time they were burnt so badly people said they could hear the crunch  across the bar I asked my server who made them it was the owner I told her he sucks and should fire him self other then that everything was great"}
{"text":"The server is very slow. And only serves the men if your a girl here. Been waiting on drinks for 20 mins a day she is cleaning instead of bringing them over. Food will be cold when it comes"}
{"text":"Went to WW for my first time on a Tues night. There was 4 couples.. but what do you expect ona  Tuesday? The atmosphere was... eye catching. A fake palm tree with lights right at the enterance. The layout was uncomfortable.. It was also freezing! They have around 6 TVs I believe, it was so quiet that they didnt even play music until 11pm.. and when the music came on it was those \"bedroom\" songs that you dont want to hear while you eat wings.

I ordered a beer, it was good and fresh. We got bbq with meduim sauce and canjun meduim bbq flavours. The size of the wings were good, the sauce amount could have been better, some of them were drier than the rest. Oh, and with 4 couples the side of fries was forgotten. 

The waitress was friendly, but not top service.
Food came out quick, but some were not sauced and drier.
Size of the wings were good
Layout was unfortable for me (better for 4 people or less), and it was freezing!!!
Atmosphere was.. interesting but also bland. A big room with high ceiling looks very empty expect for the fake palm tree.

I would not come here again, There are better places that are warmer, and have better wings (I like mine with lots of sauce). The layout of the room was not for me either. The menu is huge, but nothing special."}
{"text":"Haha. I've been going here for awhile but I'll only come back when I really don't care about the quality of food. Other Wild wings locations are better. Their level 6 heat level is for babies. The draught beer tastes insanely watered down. And the waitresses there need to be a little more level headed. Our last waitress was pretty scatter brained but it wasn't anything annoying - I just didn't want her to stress out over nothing haha.

CMON WILD WINGS you guys can do way better. Also get rid of those laminated wooden tables - they are gross and they stink."}
{"text":"I have been to this particular location several times since it opened.  Sometimes it can definitely be a hit and miss depending on the situation.  I made the mistake of popping over one time for pick up at lunch time and my wings were stone cold, but this only happened once.

I have dined in on one occasion as well and it's the typical wild wings atmosphere and decor the customer service was terrible, and that's why I haven't dined in since.

When I do take out the are usually very good about the wait times that they give you and the service when you pick up is not the best, but the wings do taste good.  

Brown eyed girl is my all time favourite flavour of wings.  The flavour is very rich and can be enjoyed by all members of the family as it isn't spicy."}
{"text":"Not sure all the low star reviews - I quite enjoyed this place! Was looking for a place to grab some lunch and instantly craved wings when I saw the sign. We came here around 1pm on a Wednesday and were the only ones there except for the guy at the bar. The waitress herself was a little surprised to see us walk in. 

Right away, we got the Molson Canadian beer  - my first time trying it and I highly recommend it! The menu for wings is extensive and a bit overwhelming. The waitress gave us some recommendations and favorites of hers. I wish I remembered the names - something with honey garlic and gar par. Yummy.. Also, keep in mind you can customize your wings too. We asked them to add teriyaki to one of the flavors and they did with no hesitation. 

Oh and try the poutine. I'm sure it's not up to Quebec City's standards but it was very good. 

We stuffed our faces and had to sit to digest for a bit. The waitress was very sweet - gave us ideas of places to see during our 1 day stay in Toronto. Really liked this place - lots of TVs, I'm sure it gets packed for games."}
{"text":"I was downtown one day and in the mood for boneless wings (the only reason why I would go to Wild Wings to be honest). Their website said there was a deal on Tuesdays for $0.39 boneless wings, but when I asked them they said they didn't have that deal at this location. Food is decent, service is good. It's located between college and dundas station, so it's easy to walk to from the subway."}
{"text":"First of all the waitress had no idea about the menu, doors too 25 mins.  We got an appetizer which showed up at the same time as the food 25 mins later, then was incomplete.  Salad missing, no salsa for the nachos and wings were over done.  I would have been embarrassed to serve this in my own restaurant.  
The waitress put ice in my son's chocolate milk and we had to wait another 25 mins for them to clear the dirty plates and bring a bill.  

I will never return."}
{"text":"Absolutely disgusting. My friends and I arrived on a Thursday night and ordered a few wings and beers. The food was mediocre but acceptable bar food. My friend and I shared an order of  garlic parmesan wings with a side of fries, we basically finished our meal and on the last few fries at the bottom of the basket - we discovered a large mosquito FRIED INTO the french fry. We informed our server and she did not even apologize or do anything to fix the issue. Just lots of attitude and an expensive bill. DEFINITELY WILL NOT RETURN. Terrible customer service."}
{"text":"Overcookef and bland. Fries were soggy , service was slow and uncaring. Manager couldn't care less about what his customers thought. Never going again."}
{"text":"I've visited this place twice in my life but only to have pitchers of beer.  I've heard from a friend that the food is terribly over priced for what it is (not like anyone offered us a menu as we did come in a group) but I could care less to eat at a bar anyway.  

Clean, spacious and as the theme goes... Your sitting in a desert.  

Not exactly the place I'm dying to visit again unless I want some beer.  

Nice seating.. you can feel comfortable at the bar or in a booth.  Not much else I can say."}
{"text":"The worst service!!!!! please read...

The bar itself is tiny cramped and smells horrible. The staff is rude, inconsiderate, and boarded on disrespectful to whomever they please.


The food is below par. Even the wings were served nearly ice cold... they are named wild wings, you would think they could get that right. 

Save your time and money and find another place"}
{"text":"Are you looking for a place to trash your money well this wild wing location is perfect for you? 

They legit served me cold food. Pretty disappointed wouldn't go back nor would I recommend this place to anyone !!"}
{"text":"I'm not big on the Wild Wing franchise, but this place at least was decent and a better experience than I had at the Yonge St location. It was a Sunday afternoon and we decided to stop in for lunch since we were in the area. Considering there was only one server working all the tables, the service wasn't too bad.

After looking over the many wing options, we settled on a pound of Daisy Duke (BBQ, Medium, & Mango Chipotle), a pound of Honey Jerk (Honey Garlic & Caribbean Jerk), an order of Potato Skins and a couple pints of MGD. The wings were both pretty good. I mean we're talking about a chain that pretty much just whips all their wings out at the same rate and throw a different kind of sauce on them, so it's kind of hard to screw too much up except for the customer ordering a crappy flavour, but that's more the customers fault than the employees. And from a business perspective, I've got to hand it to a company that can sell 9 chicken wings for $9.99 all day long. I mean the pure profit levels of selling a chicken wing at over $1 a piece when they buy in the bulk numbers they do... Just build a ridiculous menu of sauces and fancy menus and boom! Instantly justified mark-up. But I guess thats more of a rant aimed at the Chicken Wing industry as a whole, so I digress... 
One thing I can find Wild Wing at fault for is the potato skins. Quite dry and bland. Seemed like the type of thing that comes frozen they just warm and serve.

Another complaint is that they advertise a \"Mini Pitcher\". After each of us ordered a pint, I wanted a bit more to top off our glasses without committing to a full another full pint (as it was the afternoon and just needed something to wet my whistle as I finished my lunch). When I hear the term \"pitcher\", I expect something that will be brought to my table that I will be able to pour into glasses. Turns out the Mini Pitcher is actually just a big ass mug. Now if I was just looking for a big ass mug of beer, this would've probably been pretty cool. This was not very easy to pour or share though. Now I'm assuming that it was a corporate decision to market it as a \"mini pitcher\" so I can't really point fingers of blame at the location specifically...

Basically this experience re-enforced my anti-Wild Wing opinion, but will admit that if you are okay with Wild Wing in general, this seems to be a good location to go to. I think I'll just stick to the non-chain wing places to get my better value on."}
{"text":"The wings were alright, but service was awful and the waitress charged us wrong. Instead of fixing the mistake, she told us to figure it out amongst ourselves."}
{"text":"From the sorry the bathroom is for customers only to poor service and crummy food would explain why on a Saturday night at 8pm the place has two customers

$7 for soggy frozen fries and gravy is a rip off. Honestly they were horrible and the fast food drive throughs serve a crisp and hot fry day in and day out....can the chef here not do that?

Sorry but the owner should look at the Wild Wings mantra again

I cancelled my wings order because I just knew they would mnot meet my basic expectation

I am sure Wild Wings does not do any quality checks to ensure EVERY franchise owner meets their criteria on a regular basis because bad experiences like this mean that from now on I would hesitate to eat at ANY Wild Wings again

I would think every restaurant owner would take the utmost pride in a high quality experience for their  customers especially in this highly competitive market"}
{"text":"I'm not a big wing person but these are pretty good. We usually order some flats when in town. This time I think we had the dry lemon pepper and dry spicy garlic. I've never had anything else from here but wings. Couldn't really tell the difference but breaded, crispy and good nonetheless. If you ARE a wings person, they have tons of flavors to choose from. Wings are served with a side of fries, little celery/carrots and your dipping sauce of choice. (i.e. ranch, blue cheese..)"}
{"text":"Definitely not the best wings, our nachos were very cold with very little cheese, our sour cream looked like it came out of the freezer or something and kinda looked like cottage cheese instead, my Cesar had no rimmer, no lemon or celery so i was very dissapointed! On a good note, the deep fried pickles were very good."}
{"text":"Went with a friend. She ordered the Tortilla with spinach dip and I ordered some wings - I believe they were honey garlic, I can't remember at all. Our waitress was checking up on us every now and then and was very nice to accomodate us for the night. Towards the end of the night when we were paying, their machine died so I had to walk up to the counter where the waitresses and bar staff were apologizing several times before I finished paying. Despite the fact that the meal was sort of average to me, they lost a star, but if I could give this place 4 and a half stars, I absolutely would."}
{"text":"I'm not averse to Wild Wing as a business or restaurant -- as a chain, they're (probably) one of the better places.  The one in Kingston was routinely very good when I used to go a few years ago...

This Wild Wing, however, is the worst I've been to.  Poor service, uneven cooking, and skimpy portions on sides that I don't remember from other WW's.  $7ish dollars for a handful of from-frozen sweet potato fries transcends offense into the realm of comedy.

Others have already summed up the particulars of the typical Wild Wing experience -- 100+ mostly redundant flavours, tacky from-box tex-mex stylings, macrobrewery beers, big screen tvs -- so I won't dwell.  If you like that sort of thing, it's here for you.  The wings are good, no complaints there, the rest... meh.

Like most WWs, they double as a sports bar and regularly show UFC cards but fat chance getting a table.  They don't take reservations, and the local and not-so-local drunks snatch up tables hours before the shows begin.  The servers are woefully ill-equipped to deal with space management, so you'll regularly see tables for six serving one person.  How is that a money maker?

Of small interest, there's a sort of weird little back room that houses a dart board and a few tables separate from the rest of the place.  You'll see it when you look for the bathrooms.  I suspect this would be a decent place to avoid the loud ruffians... but really, if you're coming to a WW, isn't half the point that you're welcome to be a loud ruffian amongst loud ruffians?

You want a private room to play darts... go someplace else."}
{"text":"Your review helps others learn about great local businesses.

Please don't review this business if you received a freebie for writing this review, or if you're connected in any way to the owner or employees.Came here after watching a movie. I've been to this Wild Wings location a few times primarily on Tuesday. My friend and I ordered the wings special on Tuesday which is a single lb of wings were half the price with the purchase of a drink. We both ordered 2lbs of wings each along with 2 soft drinks. Nestea isn't refillable but Pepsi and other drinks are refillable. The wings special come with your choice of sides and comes with veggie sticks.  Wild wings do offer a good selection of flavours and styles of chicken wings catered for various people. It took a bit longer for our food to arrive as the restaurant was quite busy. Service was alright. I felt our waitress was a bit overworked because after she gave us our initial order.  Our wings finally came. We ordered the Sweet Escape and Hot Honey which both were listed in their top 10 section. We also ordered the Maui Waui and Smoke that Jerk (Smokey BBQ + Caribbean Jerk). The Sweet Escape and Maui Waui were both my favourites and I would highly recommend both of those as it just works well with wings and taste delicious! Overall, not the best place to get your wings fix but a decent place to go to on a Tuesday night when you want cheap wings."}
{"text":"This Wild Wing is probably one of the, if not the smallest I've been to but it's still very much your typical wild wing restaurant. The interior still reminds you a wild west saloon and the wings are great. 

The wings were excellent here and arrived hot and fresh. They were big and meaty and the hot BBQ sauce I ordered was the perfect amount of sweet, tangy, and spicy. I was also really impressed with the wild salad here which you can substitute at no charge instead of getting the fries. It was essentially a deluxe salad and also was huge. I thought I had to pay a charge for it but it turned out to be the 'standard salad'.  

The only real problem I had was that the wings arrived a bit too heavily sauced but that can easily be changed on request. There was only one waitress here but that was fine on a slow Saturday afternoon when we were essentially the only ones in the restaurant."}
{"text":"I went to this Wild Wings locations with my cousin one night to watch the UFC fights.

I normally would not go to a chain restaurant but I went to accompany my cousin, we ordered some food then some dessert. I tried to order coffee but it turns out that Wild Wings does not serve any coffee, the staff gave me all kinds for BS excuses as to why they do not sell coffee!
I was a little shocked at the fact they don't serve coffee! Needless to say it is things like that why I don't go to chain type restaurants.

{"text":"I've been to this location thrice. The first 2 were good for me but the third time was awful.

One time I came here was during the NBA playoffs for a raps game. It was super crowded so we came early for seats. Even though it was crowded we still got our orders in reasonable time. I had the fish and chips which were nothing special. My buddy ordered gar par wings and told me the day after he didn't feel too well afterwards. 

The next time I came here I decided to get some wings as well. When I got home I felt sick. I think I got food poisoning or something. 

Maybe it's just this location or maybe it's the franchise, but I'd suggest hitting up somewhere else like All Star for your wing fix. 

It was a 3.5/5 on my second visit but a 1/5 on my latest."}
{"text":"A bit smaller compared to other locations, wings are pretty good, with tons( over 100) of choices in terms of style, sauce or dry rubs. Quite extensive menu such as burgers, ribs, salad. Beer list is a bit thin, with only the major brands being offered."}
{"text":"Mostly overpriced, but the specials are always pretty good. They also have this \"get 2 apps for the price of 1\" thing that's really good. Mmm mozza sticks. The wings are really good, obviously they should be if it's called Wild Wing. I wish the workers didn't play their crappy rap/top 40 music from their iPODs. Doesn't really match with the bar environment. I love the servers though, they're really funny and sweet."}
{"text":"THIS is how Wild Wing should be.  The blonde waitress was super nice even though the place was virtually empty except for one weirdo who kept laughing to him/herself-- \"it's self.\"  I couldn't tell what gender/species this shape shifter belonged to, but it had very wet laughs and had horse teeth. That's to be expected tho; we're in Toronto.  Anyway, the Wings were electrifying, I got the Sweet Escape with extra hot.  That is Honey Garlic and Gar Par sauce.  It was sooo freaking good I wanted to order a second pound and pretend like it was for someone else! My eating habits are none of that blonde waitress' business!!  

I didn't give this place 5 stars because of the fries.  God help them ol' fries they just weren't good. Saltiest fries I've ever eaten.  Sure, I coulda sent them back  but thats pretty much asking for less salt and MORE angry chef spit.  I don't care how silly that sounds, its not a risk I would ever take for fries.  

It's sad that this place was so empty meanwhile other Wild Wings are so busy and stink metaphorically, symbolically and ACTUALLY.   I'll be back you kind blonde waitress lady.  I tipped you 16% which ended up being less than you deserved, but hey, I tried.  It's not like I was shootin to put you through law school with my tip, that's what Zanzibar is for. Anyway, 4 stars!"}
{"text":"Up until a month ago, my coworkers and I would go there for lunch twice a week.  It was delicious... BUT NOW, the cheap manager who slithers in and out of the kitchen discretely, has changed everything! Cheapskate! The wings are tiny, and you don't get a pound of em, you get charged extra if u mix flavors.. u know what? I could tell you all the things that are bad about THIS location, but there's a word count limit!  I really hope this place gets a new manager or shuts down.  I'm sitting at my desk hungry, and its all mgr mohammad's fault!"}
{"text":"My brother and I stopped by while we were staying in the nearby Homewood. It was pretty packed and the staff was stretched thin. However, once we were seated, our food didn't take too long to come. We had the Country Girl (thai and pineapple curry) which was not quite as hot as I expected but quite tasty. We also had the Fire Water, which, despite its name, only has 1 flame for spiciness. However, we concluded it was spicier than the Country Girl (which as 2). 
We also got the fried mac & cheese for an appetizer, which was somewhat lackluster."}
{"text":"Ive Heard bad things about this branch but none of which I've experienced. Wings have always been hot, good sized, and my drink and service are on par for a reasonably priced establishment. 

My old complaint is the long way from the parking lot. Which kinda sucks during the winter."}
{"text":"Been here 3 times. Food was good. Just like any other wild wing. But the servers was dumb and was very slow. I'd would much rather be at any other location."}
{"text":"I had the medium hot wings and fries so it was pretty simple but good ! Service was also good but it wasn't that busy either. Will come again"}
{"text":"I cant rank this place as they put batter on their wings..which will automatically give the sense that they are large...I advise a trip to duffs, einteins or The Wing Company...thats my complaint batter on wings....oh when i went there they only offered orders of 10 wings maybe that changed and I had to actually tell the server of the deal they offere on the day I went b4 I got fleeced ...maybe someone was trying to pull a fast one on me...LOL"}
{"text":"Great customer service - terrible food. I go here (a lot) and nothing ever changes. They screw up my order 97% of the time, and it's not like I am difficult, I literally point to a menu item and don't make any substitutions to my meal. Yet, it's always cold or wrong. Plus they are always out of the cider I want because \"Friday's are our delivery day.\"

Why I keep coming back to this place, I'll never know."}
{"text":"Wings at this location after just bad.  They  taste like frozen wind from Walmart.  For a wing joint that cagers to the wing connoisseur, theit wind are the worst

Do yourself a favor and go one block north on Jane St to St. Louis Bar and grill.  These wings are way better.

Try even Buffalo Wild Wing just down the street.

Just don't waste your money here."}
{"text":"The waitress was nice, you should seat yourself as they are not paying attention to people at the door. Food service takes a bit longer than usual. The food is very bland and tasteless. The spicy burger wasn't very tasty and didn't have much spice to it. Also tasted stale/not very fresh at all. Fries and poutine tasted as if they had been made hours ago. The gravy on the poutine was crusting just further proving the foods been in the kitchen for a bit. Everything tasted just barely warm. The restaurant is freezing, not sure what's up with the heat. Also since it's a sports bar you would expect the tv's and speakers to be working. The speakers were shot. Sounded as if the sub and amplifier blew out a while ago and nobody bothered replacing. Overall experience 1/5 food and atmosphere needs to be improved significantly. Would not return to this location."}
{"text":"We ordered for delivery is Uber eat. 3 wing combos came out to about $60. The food was okay for the value, we got a pound each with a side of fries and veggies. The flavours had fun and quirky names but they weren't really described well. We ordered a pound of 'Louisiana wings' and had no idea what flavour we were going to get. Overall the flavour was there and the wings we good but St. Louis is still far better."}
{"text":"Here on a Saturday and had the classic wild chicken crunch. The chicken was over cooked and so dry. The fries were gross. And the gravy was so runny and unfavorable. I've been to other wild wings and they were good. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"I've been occasionally stopping by here with friends for the last 2 years. They deserve a good updated review. 
The food great as usual and it is always on time. My favourite wings are sweet smoke, and I love the deep fried pickles willies. I find the servers always check up if you need anything else and they don't pressure you to leave. 
I am very satisfied with what they have on tap, they always have what I want to drink. 
I've never had a problem, I prefer coming here then most wild wings."}
{"text":"I can't seem to order anything different! The menu options are endless but  I keep defaulting to the Lemon Pepper wings, salty, tangy, peppery and crisp.  And Hot.  And not enough!  I could eat a double order if it didn't mean double the price.  I find myself eating all of the accompanying carrot sticks and celery sticks (I hate celery) just to round out the meal.  I can't wait until they introduce a few \"special wing deals\" on which I can capitalize.

Service is always very friendly and attentive.  Go, have some wings and a brew!"}
{"text":"I've been to this location quite a few times and I like it.  It's never crowded so it isn't noisy...Unlike the other Wild Wing restaurants I've been to.  I find the service is friendly and the wings are divine.  I would go back any time."}
{"text":"Location closed!  Moved to new location 1km away under new management.  Will add that to Yelp shortly.."}
{"text":"This location opened under new management within the past year, and the old location on Main Street & 9th Line is now closed.

The new place is probably a bit smaller but nicer, and the wings and beer are top notch as always.  Friendly staff and lots of flavours.  Tried the smokey + dill tonight - very good!  Lots of parking, next to the Maki Zushi and right along the main drag.  Good place, I'll definitely be back.."}
{"text":"The truth is that I'm torn.  Politically, I really want to dislike Wild Wing, and it's because it's a franchise chain, and because franchise chains tend to threaten local pubs and bistros and so ruin a local area's unique vibe and character.  There are enough stripmalls and carboncopy eateries in the world already, as far as I'm concerned.

The Wild Wing Corporation has seemingly sprung up all over downtown Toronto in the last year, clearly trying to homogenize and muscle in on the growing Buffalo wing craze.  This particular location is very probably trying to draw customers away from my own personal and beloved haunt, Loons, which is about a block away at the Roncesvalles/Howard Park intersection.  I'm worried.

Thankfully, Loons still has it down when it comes to solid, stick-to-your-ribs hot meals apart from the standard pubfare, and their wings are seriously good, all considered.  But I'm afraid that I do have to admit that, in some ways, Wild Wings is a like an upstart, young Sugar Ray Leonard here, giving the well-established challengers some bopping and swerving moves in the ring.

To start with, WW boasts some 91 flavours to choose from, and about half of those are actually not some variant of hot and spicy.  This is good news for those of a mellower palate who simply want to enjoy some pleasant sauces on their poultry limbs instead of feeling embers from Hades sliding down their throats.  

These flavours include a variety of assorted clerverly-named blends and fusions of any or all of these:  BBQ, jerk, pineapple, maple, curry, honey garlic, Thai, mango, garlic, Cajun, chipotle, lemon, dill, kethcup, buttermilk, parmesan, ranch, caesar, mustard, hickory, black pepper, teriyaki, and yes, chocolate.

But I'm a fire man, and the hottest to be offered here include \"She's a Hottie\" (triple suicide blend), \"Cadillac Ranch\" (caesar/ranch/suicide), \"Home On The Ranch\" (ranch/suicide), \"Bubba's Backfire\" (BBQ/suicide), \"Catch Me If You Can\" (maple/suicide), my personal fave \"Dusty Muckaroo\" (honey garlic/suicide), and their two super inferno options, \"Sweatin Bullets\" (a suicide/smokey BBQ fusion) and Ring Of Fire (blend of various suicides).  Whoah.

Wings are offered in counts of 9, 18, 28, 36, 50, and 100 pieces, all with option of regular or boneless, breaded or not.  It's a tad expensive here, but if you're smart you might show up on one of their specials nights: Tuesday (14 wings for $10), Wednesday (double wings and a pitcher for $30), or Thursday (pint and pound for $13).

Wings are served with ranch or bleu cheese options, but in cups that are half-full at best.  The metal busket (like those found at Duff's) is useful, as are the particularly firm and large wetnaps available.

Sometimes the vibe is cool and distant, but you can always relax on the extensive side patio with its young trees and view of passing streetcars.  

The brats eat free on Sundays.  The meatheads enjoy UFC on the big screens here.  If you're driving and it;s after normal business hours, take a chance and park in the Master Mechanic's lot across the street.

The biggest drawback is the price and the general lack of unique character (unless fresh-from-the-box psuedo-Western is your thing), but I have to say than tham thar wings is purdy damned okelydokely."}
{"text":"I don't know why people complain about this place (it's under new ownership so maybe that was the issue in the past). It's awesome. The wings are great and it's been newly renovated. Free and easy parking. My favoutrite is honey hot and their boneless wings are high quality, unlike a lot of the cheaper places. We find ourselves here about once a week lately. Go here, you don't be disappointed."}
{"text":"If you see more than 4 tables, be prepared to wait a while for the entire process. Wings are okay, might as well go to st louis on king"}
{"text":"Honestly didn't expect much from this place, but the wings turned out decent. We got the dry Cajun along with saucy ones, and the hot spicy ones were definitely better.

I would recommend getting  4-5 on the spice level. Anything less seemed kinda bland.

3 stars for being easily accessible for ppl living in this area and friendly service."}
{"text":"Just came under new ownership so let's hope for better things here.I usually drink in a place for the crowd and the staff,so while their food isn't the best.Their beer is good and reasonably prices and the manager Angie is a ray of sunshine.Live the place."}
{"text":"Wild Wing isn't the first place I think of in Toronto when I want wings. As impressive as their flavour and menu choices are they just never seem to quite cut it for me. However, me and my sister were craving wings and the closest wing place aside from \"Wing Stop\" on King street was Wild Wing and since the World Juniors game was on we decided to give them a shot.

Every time we pass by this particular location it always seems empty however because of the game there was two gentlemen sitting and watching the game while a group of about 8 were also there. We were allowed to choose where we would like to sit (always a bonus when dining) and so we opted to sit at a corner table so we could view the game as well. We wanted boneless wings so I ordered the Dry Cajun while my sister got the Wee bit Saucy with Buffalo Sauce and a Buffalo Rub. Although the place was practically empty our order did take over 15 minutes to arrive. I assume because there was probably one or two cooks at the time. Once our orders arrived, I wasn't that impressed with the size of my boneless wings although there seemed to be quite a few of them. The Dry cajun wasn't anything special. It seemed overly dusted in Dry Cajun spice however that I had to shake most of the spice off the little nuggets before devouring them. I did try my sisters as well and maybe I am bias as I really do not like Buffallo sauce but it wasn't anything special as well. Seemed like it was just Franks sauce tossed with a dry rub. Which didn't balance very well. 

If you want good wings, this probably isn't the Top choice downtown however if you have a craving. This place isn't that terrible.

Service was very friendly btw!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars**

Wild Wing is located in a small, but expanding plaza with a variety of restaurants, including Aji Sai, Korean shabu shabu, Phoenix Restaurant and even a Dollarama. Choices, choices, choices.

But for that night, I was craving wings.

There was 1 hostess managing the restaurant on a Saturday night, but there was only 2-3 tables filled. 

Ordered:
Honey Garlic and BBQ - I've tried the Honey Garlic wings here before. It tasted EXACTLY the same. The sweetness covers up any hint of BBQ flavour it may hope to show. I didn't mind as much, as I do love my honey garlic wings, but disappointing, as they do have an extensive list on the honey garlic combinations, probably with the same result.

Gar-Par - A combination of garlic and parmesan. A bit too creamy for my liking. 

Overall, the wings are well cooked, meaty, and juicy. Too many wing places over cook their wings to dryness, so Wild Wings does this well. The flavours were a bit disappointing though. 

Oh, and the fries. McCain fries anyone?

This place doesn't blow my mind, but great for a quick fix. 

Note: I do notice a lot more Wild Wing restaraunts around, as this US company is expanding across the borders."}
{"text":"Gone once but happy I did and will definitely return. The Yelp reviews were also helpful and it was good to see the management had addressed some points that other reviewers had brought up (ex. buckets still on table for bones, but so are plates).

SERVICE best part of the visit. Hands down. Not going to lie-the wing list can look a little overwhelming (but totally mouthwatering!) and the server took her time pointing out the differences in the wings and how we could try several types as part of that night's special-these could have been advertised both in house and on the street more visibly. The server was friendly and we both felt she w someone who had earned a good tip.

FOOD great stuff coming out of that kitchen for wings. An earlier reviewer mentioned that they go heavy on the sauce-and they do, so be warned. I had the mango chipotle and spaghetti western and if there weren't so many on the menu that I still want to try, I'd get them again. My friend got one with pineapple and jerk sauce-tangy but messy and another that had chocolate on it and the name completely escapes me. Everyone's taste's are different blah blah blah and I like my wings dry. Lots on this newly expanded menu to try and I look forward to coming back to do so.

DECOR & MOOD was a bit off and am not sure if it was a one-time thing. We were there around 6pm on a Wednesday night of Stampede. On the one hand it was nice to walk in and not hear country music. On the other, considering the menu, I expected to hear either southern rock or something along those lines. Dance music through the speakers while the many large TVs mounted to the wood paneled walls all showed the TFC-Whitecaps match. We were there for the food, not the 'ambiance' so this isn't a big deal but it just didn't seem to all go together. Like I said in opening, I'm not sure if it was a one time thing but I will be curious to see if it is the same when I return.

OVERALL a newer Calgary eatery on 17th Ave SW that is definitely worth checking out. Solid service. Lots of meat on the menu and something for all tastes."}
{"text":"I've never been to the old place some other reviewers mentioned so I can't compare. But what I can compare is one Wild Wing to another.

Generally I find wild wing's too be a bit small, but this one was small. When I walked in I had to take a look to make sure there wasn't more. But that's not a big deal. Because there weren't too many people here on a Saturday night. I counted three tables, one waitress and one other guy who I thought was going to help me, then the waitress came over and then he went back to the kitchen.

I guess they don't expect a lot of people since there is only one waitress who must double as the bartender. But then I'm not surprised, there were three tvs in there and for some reason they were all out, no TV in a bar!

The waitress, she was a bit rude and unorganized. I guess if she was dealing with the whole restaurant herself I can see why she might be flustered, but a bit better service wouldn't be bad.

As for the wings, a bit lukewarm like they been sitting around for a while.

Stouffville has tons of fast food places, not too many wing places. Perhaps it's hit or miss, but this time it was a miss."}
{"text":"Crappy. I've been here before on numerous occasions and although I've been patient enough, I've walked in and had to wait five or more minutes to be seated...because nobody is around. Second, their sauce sucked! Not sure what happened but they watered down their wing sauce big time! I ordered Honey Blues..which is supposed to be honey garlic sauce topped with thick blue cheese dressing....where's the blue cheese (from pic) And the honey garlic sauce tasted bland - like a watered down syrup. 
When the new ownership came it was still okay and I ate here and was served by one of the new owners who did perfect. 
I don't know what happened and I am so mad that I wasted my money and said nothing. I just felt bad for them. 
Bring your sauce back and don't jip your customers. Your sauce is what makes you guys unique."}
{"text":"New wild wings in the east Markham area...newly opened...renovations are welcoming and seating is considerably OK. Currently still alot of construction on Markham Road so therefore the entrance may be difficult to enter. This is a small plaza so parking spaces are limited.

Many different flavours of wings available. Over 100 I think. Taste is ok. I've had better. They don't have enough staff on the floor I think cuz it's new...giving benefit of the doubt, how it will pick up better in the future.

Only 2 waitresses working on a Friday night is definitely not enough. I'm not sure if it is opening specials or if its ongoing. Family combo special 2 salads, 4 lbs of wings and 2 large fries for only $44.99. Which is not bad at all.

Washrooms are clean (it's a new place...if it's dirty, I am very concerned)...May come back again when the construction and stuff are out of place.

If you're in the area and feel like wings...give it a try!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure if it's a chain thing, but every Wild Wings i've been to, every visit is the same.
Mediocre bland food, lousy service, empty restaurants. 

This visit was no different.
Our group of 7 walked in on a Wednesday night, 4 of us got food, 3 only got drinks.
3 of us asked for drinks that weren't available, including cider which was very surprising.

I ordered the pulled pork sandwich. The taste was eh... Mediocre, not enough sauce. My salad was actually quite delicious but it is hard to screw up salad.
My only big concern was that my food was served on a plate you'd see in your own kitchen, not a restaurant style, which I found weird.

My husband had a chicken sandwich which he actually enjoyed.

Our server was completely absent. She would disappear and only check in on us every 25-30 minutes or so.
At the beginning of our meal, we told her separate bills, at the end she said she forgot, so she went around to each of us to figure out what we ordered. 
She could not keep the orders straight and ended walking back and forth to our table 6 times before getting everyone's bill right.

Really not impressed, yes the food is cheap, but if you want good food and good service, check out wacky wings on dundas. 

1/5"}
{"text":"Place looks nice and at first we thought it was going to be a really good meal but we found out that the naked wings with sauce meaning the ones that are not battered are very puny and over cooked. When I talk to the waitress that's how they come and that they're dark because they are seasoned that way. I thought the waitress just justified the quality with a poor excuse"}
{"text":"RE: A previous reviewer's opening line, Wild Wing is always dependably mediocre.

We came here for a playoff game because our other spots were completely jam-packed and full. 

This place however, 30% occupancy, MAX. 
Our server was pretty sassy and impatient with us. We got beer right away, and asked for water. She seemed really annoyed when we wanted another minute to decide on wing flavours. We had to flag another server down to flag her down because it seemed like she was ignoring us. After we ordered we did not see her again until we flagged the other server down to get our bill. Then she was The Flash. 

The wings were disappointingly dry on the inside and really, really salty.

Mediocre food, beer was not very cold/almost flat, unwelcoming server. No thanks."}
{"text":"Pretty slow service/kitchen ItTakes forever.. Waiting for 3 pounds of wings for the last 50 minutes or so. A burger turn around is 30 minutes :(    And the place is pretty run down"}
{"text":"In a word: soggy. 

At over $1 per wing these should be better, or even good.  The dry wings are passable, however salty but the sauced wings are tepid and mushy despite being battered.  The numerous sauces are more show than substance. If you want wings, head over to Duffs or better yet go across the street to Auld Spot now called Hogtown something or other for their drummies (all drumsticks, great sauces)."}
{"text":"Wings were extremely saucy. To the point that it ruined the taste of the wings. And the dry wings were extremely salty. Service and atmosphere was good."}
{"text":"The half price wing deal is a rip off. Go to St Louis instead. Same night, every Tuesday.

The deal is a rip off because: 1) they take away the fries 2) you must order a drink for every pound of wings you order. 3) the price is not lower if you buy more wings, it is usually prorated at other places. For example $14 for 1 pound but $20 for 2 pounds. So 2 pounds is a better value - elsewhere. Not here.

Table was sticky. Service was slow. Place was empty. Bathroom was small, and no paper towel. So for those reasons - I will only eat at St Louis Bar and Grill, half price every Tuesday!"}
{"text":"Don't quite understand why this place is almost always empty/lacking customers every time I visit, but I suppose it isn't something to be too concerned about.  Came here with a friend about 2 weeks ago for an extremely late night dinner after spending some time chilling downtown.  Was really craving tacos (and I know they used to serve them!) but was disappointed when I wasn't able to find them on the menu.  

Nonetheless, I ended up ordering a single serving (approximately 10 wings) of Honey Garlic + Garlic Parmesan wings (no picture, sorry! Was too hungry at that point to take one).  One has the option of choosing between boneless chicken or wings and wings can be breaded as well.  

Overall, the food quality is great and there are lots that one can choose from on the menu.  A good place to go to for a late night meal or snack."}
{"text":"Restaurant was a little outdated but the food was great and the service was great, no complaints on that end!"}
{"text":"When you get wings you expect the following:
1. They actually look like wings that could have come from a chicken not a tiny Cornish game hen,
2. They are covered in sauce, there should be no part on the wing that is bare unless requested.
3. Even though they are covered in sauce they should still be crisp on the outside and moist chicken on the inside.

I got the smokybbq+honey garlic wings. Here's what I thought:
1. Nope not the size I was looking for, though it was nice that it was majority drumsticks.
2. These wings were maybe drizzled in sauce, I would say 60-70% completely bare.
3. Even though they weren't covered in sauce, they were soggy and just filled with grease. 

Overall a terrible experience."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: fun, good place to hang with friends , friendly staff

Price : pricier; 11.00 for a pound, go on Tuesdays for their 1 1/2lb special 15.00

Food: awesome! Love how much flavours they have. My usuals are sweet escape which is honey garlic and gar par and hot honey, is honey garlic and hot. I took a chance and tried their Caribbean jerk, oh what a mistake. The combination was just very wrong. 

Overall: my go to place for wings, so I'll definitely be back"}
{"text":"I have only been to Toronto twice but I make it a must to come for these delicious wings!!!! Good drinks and food! You really can't beat"}
{"text":"4 stars for service and 2 stars for food. 

My boyfriend and I went for a quick late lunch. We ordered calamari, cheese bacon gravy poutine and fish and chips. Wth were we doing in a wing shop but didn't order wings right? I don't know. Anyway,

Poutine was good with lots of bacons but gravy was a bit salty. 

Calamari was fine by me but le bf found it a bit fishy and some were soggy. 

The biggest let down was the fish and chip. It was really heavy it made me sick after two bites. It was heavily beer battered as well - even when we peeled the batter off the fish."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love coming to Wild Wing it's a casual date spot. He enjoys the Cadillac Ranch and Garlic Parmesan. We usually get a pitcher of beer and I enjoy their Caesars. Their French fries are pretty good too. Stay away from the jerk wings, they aren't that great. On certain nights of the week they offer different specials. Go and check them out. The wait staff is interesting to watch and this old lady regular who sits at the bar who is a hoot."}
{"text":"Was here for the first time last night to watch the Canucks game...

When I walked in the place was practically empty except for a handful of drunken middle-aged men at the end of the bar. I grabbed a seat near the front and waited for my friends to show up. The waitress was nice and polite, and as the game was just beginning quite a few people started pouring in. 

The Sunday special was three appetizers and a half-order of fries for 20 bucks. We did the math and it was only about a dollar cheaper than ordering all the items separately. We also passed on getting a pitcher of beer because there was no price difference whatsoever between the jug and individual pints. Makes no sense.

Appetizers weren't very good -- definitely on the microwave tip. We got some jalapeno poppers, potato skins, and mozzarella sticks. They were all rather sub-par. We decided to tackle some chicken wings: an order of honey garlic and cajun dry rub. Both weren't very good either. They weren't very big, and they worked out to be over a dollar each! They were about the size of my thumb. The cajun ones were better than honey, but they were also extremely salty.

So the food wasn't very good and not really that inexpensive either. But we were there to watch the game, and they have multiple TVs and plenty of beer, so that's what it basically comes down to. It's hard not to snack on something when watching a three-hour game but I will have to think twice about what to grab on the menu.

I'll be back. My friends live in the area and it was a good enough vibe, but I might just make sure I eat a lot before I roll through. Beer and service is fine, food is questionable."}
{"text":"I usually frequented the location at Yonge and College but it closed! Much to my delight this new franchise opened. My wife and I decided to check it out and it was okay. For some reason the wings didn't seem as high quality as the location at College. I'm not sure whether all locations get the same meat/ingredients but these seemed of lesser quality.

My wife asked for an Ameretto sour and after what seemed like a long wait our server informed us that they were out of lime bar mix? I would have offered to make a fresh squeezed one but hey that's just me. I ordered a draft Heineken and it took forever. I noticed they were changing the keg, why would they not just say so?

Our apps were good, pickled willy's and potato skins. We love the GarPar so that was a no brainer, we tried a new all-dressed wing and they were great, reminiscent of the chips.

One thing that miffs me though is that they charge for any kind of sauce. My wife doesn't like hot sauce so I asked for some Tobasco or Frank's but the wanted to charge me for it.

All in all, a good experience. You can tell it's a new location but we are happy to have one in our hood."}
{"text":"Perhaps it was the fact that we went here after moving my friend into his new house but it was great. Yes we were thirsty and hungry but the wings were delicious and the service was great and friendly. We ordered Rickards White and after receiving it we were told they had run out of orange slices. After cajoling the server someone actually went out and purchased oranges for us, now that's service!

What I liked about WW is that it's not just wings like Duffs. They have quite a selection of apps etc.

I ordered Gar-Par wings which is Caesar and parmesan and they were delicious. I also ordered some which were ranch and Frank's red hot with lime and they were great too. I like my wings crispy which they were and didn't even have to ask.

This would be a great place to watch the game with the boys.....or girls for that matter.

YUM!"}
{"text":"It was probably my mistake to order a chicken wrap at a wing place but this was the saddest excuse for food. It included maybe 5 bits of fake chicken slices and a lot of lettuce. They really need to take it off the menu if they're going to serve this crap.

The wings were decent but nothing can save them from that poor example of a chicken wrap."}
{"text":"Food was good....but service....this girl Jane*(not sure) she was on her phone all the time....never asked me for a second drink or took my empty plates....so I decided to pay and leave...and then she had that angel voice....when she gave me my bill....never checked on me even once! I will never go back..."}
{"text":"The wings were good.  The mac & cheese wedges were okay.  The calamari and boneless wings were horrible.....the service was very slow."}
{"text":"Wednesday night I decided to order take out from this place. Me and my boyfriend tried their wings specials. For $27.50 you get 2 lbs of wings and plus one side, with 2 pops. 

The delivery came really quick. But the food was not impressive at all. All the wings had too much sauce on each piece, and it was mostly drumsticks in the box. Plus they didn't taste good at all. Spicy flavor is just pure sourness. 

I'll not order again."}
{"text":"Came in for a late dinner on Sunday night. 
Wings were ok, however service was severely lacking. Both waitresses stepped out for a smoke at the same time, leaving the dining room unattended. Not impressed. Improvement required."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Arrived about 6pm. Seated in bar. Server acted very overwhelmed and scattered. Brought wrong appetizer; never offered drink refills; actually went for prolonged periods of time without seeing her at all; had to hunt her down for check; weren't informed that she handled payment so we wandered back to hostess desk where we were informed to \"try coming when we aren't busy\". Really? Thank you for your concern. Just paid our $70 and promptly left. Food was good but I won't be back."}
{"text":"Awful food. Frozen and poor quality. Manager doesn't care to rectify issues with customers. Just stares awkwardly from afar. Save your $!!"}
{"text":"This place is kind of run down. I don't like the sticky tables although to be honest I don't go to sport bars often so not sure if that's a norm. The wings were.... how do I say it, the meat was too soft to my liking. They were big, with lots of meat on it, but I felt like eating a drumstick.  the flavour was good, some parts of the seasoning/breading didn't taste fresh. Also some shady people in the restaurant that seemed to be friends w the staff there. Service was fine though, nothing to complain about. Although what service do you expect from a wings place?"}
{"text":"Had a party of 15. Waitress forgot orders, didn't follow up. Wound up bringing wrong orders and missing some. Although nice, poor service. 

Food was okay but service sucked."}
{"text":"Horrible service came here while on vacation. We walked in waitress tosses some menus in the table we assume they were for us considering she said nothing to us. We sat down (its a fairly small place) waited 10 mins they didn't even ask is if we wanted drinks or anything!! Not sure how the food is because we left and went somewhere else!"}
{"text":"Went This past Friday. We pick this place only because hes visiting from portugal. It started nice.  Our waitress was nice funny. As soon as we ordered thats when it went down hill. We got out beer first by the time we were almost done we got out wing. 10.99 for only 8 wings isnt that great other places u get more and these arent big or even jumbo wings. Our server never came back to see of we wanted anything else. This place was somewhat packed and to only have 2 server on the floor plus the patio thats weird. We waited for 15 min just so we can pay we asked for our check and didnt even come back we got fed up and just went up to pay. I would not come back to this place"}
{"text":"We went here for lunch yesterday. Things started out well - we ordered the bruschetta flatbread, which came quickly and was delicious. But after finishing the flatbread, we waited almost AN HOUR for our entrees, which were simply a Lund of wings and a club sandwich. The wings were decent (not as good as wings from other nearby Wong establishments), but the club sandwich was dry, underseasoned, and overall flavourless. How do you screw up a club sandwich??

To add to this, we were seated by the kitchen, and kept hearing complaints from other customers about the EXTREMELY slow service, and one complaint about undercooked chicken.

The server was very pleasant and we realize the slow service/lackluster food was not her fault. Still would not return and would not recommend going to this establishment. Management should pay the extra $10/hour for more staff...I can't see this place staying in business with this food and service. Go elsewhere or make food at home."}
{"text":"2nd time coming back to this location and I left feeling more satisfied compared to the first time going. At time we came, it was raining and it was early evening so the place was rather empty but either way, the waitresses were very tentative and welcoming. 

Our order was taken at around 4:30ish, the waitress informed us that the wings were made to order so they obviously had to come out steaming hot and that also means a bit of waiting, which I didn't mind. Compared to the last time, our wings came out piping hot and within 15 minutes of ordering. This time I ordered Mango Chipotle wings while my girlfriend got Honey Garlic wings and we also got a side order of Gar Par fries. 

The Mango Chipotle was listed under the \"Naked\" wings category which basically means the wings are breaded, deep-fried and then tossed in a powdered seasoning. The powder seasoning itself was really good, it had the right amount of chipotle kick with the sweet hint of mango and for me, that's what makes a good chicken wing.

The Honey Garlic is nice and sweet with a medium hint of garlic also mine and gf's all-time favourite sauce to have on our wings. The Gar Par fries were so bomb! You literally get a basket of hot fries packed to the brim and the creamy garlic sauce that is drizzled on top along the sprinkles of parmesan cheese, mmmmmmmmm! Great combo. In the end, the total wasn't too damaging. $32.20 for 2. Definitely coming back again,"}
{"text":"Came in one late Sunday afternoon and the place wasn't too overly packed which was great. There was only one cook and one waitress from what I witnessed. She was really nice and welcoming. I ordered Gar Par fries for both me and my girlfriend, she got the Sweet Escape wings while I got the Farmer's Daughter wings.

Gar Par fries are like our staple to get at any of the Wild Wing locations. Her Sweet Escape wings are essentially Honey Garlic wings doused in Gar Par sauce but they were uber good. My Farmer's Daughter wings which was BBQ sauce, Medium hot sauce  and Wild Jerk seasoning. Now on the Wild Wing scale, mine was a 3. There was hardly any hot sauce that I tasted and it didn't kick in after I consumed all 10 wings that I got. Maybe, I'll try a 4 or 5 next time I go."}
{"text":"Went to Wild Wing on a Sunday and was just looking for a quick and small bite. We stood at the front for a little while without being acknowledged. Likely because there was only one server/bartender for the whole establishment. Once we were seated I asked for the daily special. The server said it was flatbreads with a purchase of a drink. When I actually saw the daily specials it stated 1/2 price flatbreads with a purchase of a drink. Big detail that she left out. 

I ended up ordering a single of Spicy Gar Par Wings. The wings were suppose to come with fries, celery and carrot sticks. The wings were missing the carrots. When I asked about them, the server said they ran out. Don't you think that if you run out of carrots you would provide more fries with or more celery sticks? Nope! Didn't even cross her mind. It might have been a good thing she didn't give us more celery sticks because they were disgusting. The two sticks looked like they were torn apart instead of sliced properly. They were also soggy as hell, with no crunch, and on the border line of expiry. I was unimpressed and wish I could have went back in time to walk up further to the St. Louis just north of this Wild Wing location. Don't even ask if I want to return. JimStar Out!!"}
{"text":"AVOID!  Wings were super dry and not well seasoned.   We returned a set of wings and received ones that were worst!  The owners of this establishment should be ashamed to charge customers for their subpar food.  They need to visit the other Wild Wing locations to see what the wings should look and taste like.  Don't waste your money, stay away!"}
{"text":"Good wings, mediocre service, strange atmosphere, and lots of fruit flies. 

We were sitting at a table that seemed to have nested a ton of fruit flies. EW. This was disgusting. We complained to our waitress  who basically stuck up her nose at the issue and did not offer to seat us elsewhere or correct the issue through some alternative strategy. By the our wings arrived, we were just about to receive our wings so we decided to suck it up. Safe to say the fruit flies killed our appetites pretty quickly. There was also some ridiculously drunk person at the bar that produced a transient, high-pitch scream every time her preferred baseball team on the television made it on to a base (god help us).

The wings did not disappoint. To the waitresses defence, she happily agreed to make the wings all flats (my girlfriends' favourite)."}
{"text":"I gave this place a second chance to see if they improved their lack of customer service but I wasted my time. All the waitresses have attitude and always in a bad mood. I hate bad customer service & I'm not one to complain but if I'm complaining, you know it's serious. I don't want the waitress to kiss my ass but I don't want them to be rude too. I don't understand how Wild Wing can hire such unprofessional people and expect customers. To top it all off, it's never busy in here and it takes them forever to serve us DRINKS. Terrible location, maybe I'll try another location Wild Wing some day...never going back to Ellesmere and VP."}
{"text":"In a world of dying Wild Wing franchises, I'm definitely glad this place is sticking around. Quality of the food is much better than other Wild Wings. The service is not so much to be desired considering there was only one person working that afternoon as a waitress and bartender. Nonetheless she was able to serve us efficiently. She was also very upbeat and personable considering she was the only one working there. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about this place. The location is great. The place itself is so-so aka average though i have been to other Wild Wings and they are better than this location. The service was decent. The wings were good. I would have preferred them a little hotter (temperature) as they were room temperature when 2 lbs arrived but then again i have had warmer flavourful wings from many other places. Will i come here again? Probably not. 
I'd prefer to order take-out and enjoy them home."}
{"text":"First time at this location. Clean, bright and not cluttered (unlike some other WW locations). Service was great. Now to the main reasin why I went there - them wings. Gar par, Daisy Duke, desperado, cheese dip, Irish nachos were all good."}
{"text":"I was craving wings and even though their wing menu is extensive (a zillion different types of wings), they are absolutely blah.... average.
Don't like breaded wings but that's their standard (which was never mentioned) and didn't tell the waitress I wanted them naked, had to eat them breaded (didn't ask if they would accommodate,  I just couldn't imagine them throwing food away)... anyways, I am leaving thinking I might not come back... Unless Earth stops serving wings anywhere else!"}
{"text":"My friend and I came here for Wings. As we were seated down, the waitress failed to mention the debt machine was down. Which could have ultimately changed our mind on staying since we both did not have cash. We ordered our meal, which was decent. I mean, it wasn't too horrid. It was edible. There were definitely not the welcoming vibe. We felt really uncomfortable just being in the building. As we asked for the bill, the waitress finally decided to mention that debit was down. Also the ATM was out of cash. My friend had to go out and take cash in a different plaza and come back to pay. It was an inconvenience and waste of our time. Never coming back."}
{"text":"I've been to this Wild Wing twice in the past few months. On both occasions it was at off times; the first time was late at night and they stayed open for us and the second time was between lunch and dinner time. Both times the place was empty. The service was friendly and genuine and we were not rushed at all. The food is the food they serve at all Wild Wings; I am loath to say anything bad because the people running this place are very kind, but I will say that the dishes don't look in real life like they do in the photos on the menu. But that is the corporation's doing and not any fault of this particular franchise location. The food has been fresh on both occasions and the place is kept very clean. You can score some free parking on the east side of Bayview Ave. if you go a bit south of the restaurant or you can pay to park right out front. It is a medium-sized establishment to which I will happily return the next time I have the hankering for some chicken wings."}
{"text":"There should be a saying along the lines of \"if you are on Queen West, why the hell would you go to Wild Wing?\"

As this saying didn't exist, I went to Wild Wing on Queen. It was... well it was Wild Wing Jr. The wings came from chicken, the sauces came from a big bag in a bigger box and the waiter came from Brampton. I guess I am saying I got what I paid for. I give the restaurant 2 stars and me 1 star for going to a chain restaurant when standing B-deep in one of the best culinary neighborhoods in the country."}
{"text":"I love Wild Wing... and I have raved about every other location on Yelp. This dingy little thing on Lakeshore? Not so much. Sadly, I wasn't even craving wings when we walked in. And when I ordered my regular Saddle Up, I did not love it. 

First things first, this location is such a Ghost town. When we walked in, it was totally empty, lacked the usual decor, and the usual amped up music. Instead, some TVs playing sports, one quintessential old guy at the bar, flirting with the one waitress/bartender half his age. The menu looked dreary and different too. Saddle Up (my order) is usually described as Gar Par and Buttermilk Dill at the other locations. It was Caesar and Dill at this one. The waitress had me convinced that these are exactly the same. NO, they aren't. Caesar and Dill is exactly what it is - Caesar salad dressing with some dill. No taste of buttermilk, no taste of parmesan. The fries are forced in... so you end up paying $15 for the 10 wings whether you want fries or not. 

Never coming back to this location. It ruined my Wild Wing experience. 
If you're going to buy a franchise, and won't spend $$$ to maintain it, don't buy it at all. Clearly, they are getting the crackhead business in this area."}
{"text":"These guys have a ton of flavors for Wings. 
The Gar Par with buttermilk and dill is to DIE FOR.
And they have an amazing Tuesday special!! 

#winning 
Can't wait to be back soon."}
{"text":"Staff are not that great.
Server made a mistake with my order the refused to correct it. She blamed me, then offered to meet me 1/2 way and give me 10% off my next order (like I would ever com back)."}
{"text":"Recently visited this location and unfortunately the food and service was a big miss. I usually like Wild Wings for their gar par wings. Here the wings were small, over fried, and the flavours were not consistentent with the other locations. Also, they gave us dirty cups and napkins. Head over to the Woodside Square location instead."}
{"text":"I live nearby, I drive by a lot and see the big projector screen upstairs playing whatever game or fight is on that night. Wild Wing has a pretty good rep where i'm from so I decided to bring a date here to watch the Raptors and eat chicken wings. 

It was pretty dead in there. The only employee was working the tables, the bar and the kitchen but she was friendly and accommodating. We asked her if they were going to be playing the Raptors, perhaps on the big screen, she looked at me like I had three heads. She eventually found the channel for us in the bar downstairs. I was a little disappointed about how low key it was. 

We ordered a vegetable flatbread for an appetizer. It was like she emptied out a packet of frozen diced veggies on a flatbread and stuck the whole thing in the microwave. So gross. 
The wings were good. Lots of flavors. 

The local Port Credit drunks treat this place like an alley bar where they can get pissed up and fall asleep. 

Pretty much every other review on here is correct. It's not like any other Wild Wing, in the worst way. It's pricey to begin with, this location isn't worth it. Avoid under all conditions."}
{"text":"Came here with two friends Saturday night to watch the UFC fight. We ordered the deep-fried mac'n cheese and the Dirty Cowboy poutine to share, and then an order of wings each. I got the Catch Me if You Can (Maple & Extra Hot), breaded.

The deep-fried mac was interesting in execution but pretty boring in flavour. I didn't go back for seconds. The poutine was standard, I enjoyed the flavor of the gravy but found myself seasoning it with chipotle Tabasco to make it more interesting. I enjoyed the flavor of wings I ordered, and the breading had a pleasant crispiness to it. My only complaint would be that these wings were ranked 5 on a scale out of 6 for heat level, and I probably would have ranked them at 3. The heat was pretty wimpy, so next time I'll probably go for a 6.

Our service left not much to be desired, we were well attended to throughout the night, so no complaints there. I do think that some of the food is slightly over-priced for what it is, but that probably wouldn't stop me from going back in the future to hang out."}
{"text":"Why and how this location is still open is beyond me. It's clear that the staff and owner just don't seem to care anymore. 

I brought an out-of-town friend to this location for lunch on Thurs. May 7, 2015 and I felt so bad for doing so. 

The bar literally had 3 tables seated and one waitress working who doubled as the bartender. It took her 33 minutes (we counted) to come and ask us for our order *despite* us trying to flag her down 3-4 times in the process. Keep in mind, it was not at all busy. Our food arrived 20 minutes after we placed the order (we'd now been at the bar for over 50 minutes). It took her another 15 minutes to get me a refill of water, even though we were seated right next to the bar. 

The waitress put on a sour face after realizing my friend had refused to tip her. I mean, tips are earned and she definitely didn't deserve one. The entitlement was real, lol. 

Overall it was a terrible experience. Perhaps this Wild Wings would do a lot better if they started caring about the handful of people that actually bothered to come into the bar. Don't waste your time at this location unless you have an hour to waste fiddling your thumbs before you even order your food. The Boxgrove location is equally as dead but the service is outstanding compared to this one."}
{"text":"Lunch - music is too loud to hear the soft spoken inept waitress - who screwed up putting in a simple wing order three times - will not be returning to this location - do yourself a favour and head to BUFFALO WILD WINGS"}
{"text":"Ya, no.

Horrible experience.  Wings were tiny, like if Derek Zoolander were there he'd have questions.
Sauce was decent, but they rated it 4 out of 5 for heat... I'd have rated it a 2 max.
Only one server who was doubling as bartender.  Slooooooowwww service.  I'll give her a break because she was alone, but come on.  The place was not that busy and apparently had lots of time to talk to fanclub/boyfriend at the bar.

There are much better options, won't be back."}
{"text":"We order a double wings (2 flavour wings and a side of fries) combo from here to share between 2 people via Uber Eats. They gave the Uber Eats delivery person the wrong order. We called the restaurant immediately after discovering this and they said \"they could not do anything about it now\". I don't understand why they can't help when they provided the delivery person with the wrong order? This was a mistake on their end and they did not want to claim any responsibility. Poor service. 

The restaurant claimed they provided the Uber Eats delivery person with 2 orders so that individual might have mixed it up. However, we called the Uber Eats delivery person and they said they only received ONE order from the restaurant. Who's lying?"}
{"text":"Wings were alright. Waitress was beyond unprofessional unlike other wild wings I've been to. I understand it's a casual atmosphere because it is a bar but no need to come up to customers without any greetings or manners and ask \"so what do you want?\" I made no comment to this because I was hungry and just needed a break right after a long day of shopping for the holidays and brushed it off. Waitress walked away and continued conversing with the people at the bar but I'm gonna assume they were her friends because she passed the aux cord to them and they started playing over all the TVs with vulgar rap music while my fiance was trying to watch the football game. Again had said nothing because I really wasn't in the mood to get heated that night. Waitress then went outside, had a smoke, came back in and served us our food. You can only guess how I felt about that, lol."}
{"text":"Worst service ever! Waitress was very rude- she clearly didn't want to be there.. It took her 40 mins just to come near us so we could ask for a drink- and the place only had 2 other customers! Wings were OK, but not great, which took forever to come and they weren't even the right order when they finally came.. Will never visit this location again!"}
{"text":"I am sitting in this Wild Wings right now, been here for an hr and 10mins and have seen a waitress once. My food was order like a 45mins  ago and still nothing.  Not even my appetizer has shown up yet, but a family sitting behind me walks in and out of the kitchen like its their home.  Always walking out with more and more food literally every time.   This is my second time here and it will definitely be my last time coming here.  This is completely ridiculous how this place is staffed it seems like 3 they have 1 actual server that is swamped. Sadly if I could give this place a proper rating it would be maybe one tip of one triangle of the first  star provided.  I am definitely calling the health board for not having hair nets on the guest that insist on entering the kitchen every 5 mins"}
{"text":"Wild Wing is normally a 3-4 star restaurant, but this particular location is a disappointment. The place is empty most of the time and although the servers are generally friendly and attentive, the food takes a surprisingly long amount of time and, at my last visit, the wings came out warm, not hot. There was only one other table in the place which makes me wonder if the cook or server left my wings to cool while they did other tasks. It's also a cold atmosphere, both from a decor and temperature perspective. 

I actually felt ashamed eating here. Like everyone has figured out better places, but not me. 

Beer was cold at least."}
{"text":"Let's start by saying I'm not in the business of taking enjoyment with leaving negative reviews but people should really be warned about this particular location (Lake Shore/ Cawthra) - don't waste your hard-earned money.

A few Friday nights ago, we ordered about six pounds (separate flavours) of wings for carryout.  My husband gave them his AMEX number over the phone. When he arrived, he was told that they actually don't accept AMEX; albeit the fact that they still took the number over the phone.  He didn't have his debit card with him so he had to go to across to Metro and buy a VISA gift card to pay the hefty $78 bill.

When he brought the wings home, they were a mess and none of the orders were labelled.  Some looked like a bunch of salad dressing was poured over them.  We tried to eat them but we couldn't figure out what flavour was which and, plus, a lot of them were undercooked.

He called to speak to the manager who said, unless requested, it's not their policy to mark the orders.  They also weren't able provide a refund but would make a new batch free of charge.  He drove back and picked them up and they were marked this time; however, they were even more raw with a ton of breading on them and, I swear, salad dressing poured over them.  Bottom line: simply nasty."}
{"text":"Overpriced. Rude staff.

Extremely salty foods. Extremely salty attitude by staff on the phone.

Very stingy with the gravy and cheese on fries and poutine. Very stingy with compensation. I was told I would get a free compensatory dessert because they forgot an item I ordered for delivery. Never did. When I called to inquire, I was given something free alright, rudeness.  

Sticking with Pickle Barrel which has better foods and better staff."}
{"text":"The metamorphosis complete, Let's Wing It has lost all remnants of its former Wild Wing stylings and has painted over its horseshoe-branded tables. Unfortunately. someone thought it would be a great idea to line the windows with flexible cathode light tubing that rotates through neon-bright hues with a frequency of five seconds. THIS IS NOT A GOOD IDEA.

Topped off with the fact that on a busy night there were only two servers (including the bar-tender), this place has gone downhill. There were at least two tables that walked off because they weren't being attended to.

A fellow yelper I was with noticed I was the Duke of this place; he was embarrassed for me. 

The beer selection still sucks."}
{"text":"\"Thank you so much for providing such a great experience for my parent's 60th wedding anniversary. They can't stop talking about your wonderful food and service!\"
you made dere special day very special. . .  . . . good heart people.... love them... recommend them to all...."}
{"text":"I've always said it would be a feat if a restaurant managed to screw up chicken wings, but would never expect it from a place whose name has \"Wings\" in its name! Yet Wild Wing has (somehow) managed to get it wrong. So, so wrong. Something as seemingly simple as salt & pepper wings turned into an oversalted, overbattered, overcooked disaster. Not to mention the service was awful! One girl took my order and another executed the order - but (I presume) since she hadnt been the one to take my order, I didnt end up with that I asked for the first time around. To add insult to injury: she then became so busy talking to tourists at the next table over, that I didnt get any service until I asked for the bill.

Never again, Wild Wing!"}
{"text":"The wings taste/feel like freezer food. Service is OK. Flavours are hit and miss (like most many-flavour wing places). Meh!"}
{"text":"I love the food and the atmosphere of this location. I don't goto any other location but this one. The employees are great, and the service is top notch."}
{"text":"Wings were not bad, same as other locations. But the service was .. not the worst I've ever seen...but weird. The girl who served us clearly didn't want to be there. She talks like she's gonna drop and fall asleep right in front of you. She basically RUSHED us to place our order coz she's going on a break soon. This is what she said exactly \"how many mins you think you guys need? 3?5? More than 5? I'm going on a break soon, just want to know if I should wait\"."}
{"text":"I'm going to be brutally honest

I came here with my parents and to be honest, The wings I had here weren't to to die for. They were not cooked thoroughly, It was a bit pinkish. Which was clearly not a good sign. The Caesar salad I had here was a bit dry. 

The service here was slow, we waited a while before we got our order. And to take in account, Iv been to a different Wild Wing location before and the service Iv gotten before was really good. So I was disappointed, especially because I was craving good wings instead I got dry, raw wings. I can say that Iv had better. I really had high hopes for this place because Every Wild Wing location is always awesome but this time...

That being said, only 2 stars from me."}
{"text":"Love this location!! 

Located in a plaza, Wild wings is the master place to get wings, yummy juicy and oh so full with flavour. You can get em' boneless or with bones. With many many flavour varieties. My all time Fave is lemon pepper, honey garlic or BBQ. They really have a imagination here as for flavours, pretty insane flavours. Like BBQ w/ blue cheese on top. Like who wouldve thought of that combo! The customer service here is really on point, they really care about your wild wing experience. Oh yeah and that poutine pic you see there, I ate that with much joy. The wings here are actually cooked throughly, no pink meat here! 

Been to other locations before, this one has to be one of my faves!"}
{"text":"Belated Mother's Day and my belated Birthday outing with the family.

It was Thursday night and I knew it was not going to be busy so I did not have to make reservations.  It was not busy at all which was great.  There was 6 of us and the hostess/waitress seated us by the door which was fine so we could have a private-ish dinner away from some of the tables.

Her name was Jassica and she took care of us.  It was my family's first time at Wild Wing so they spent a lot of time figuring out what wings to order.  Jassica came around a lot to ask if we were ready.  Finally we were and we ordered 5 pounds of wings (unfortunately she did let us know that there was a 5 lbs special and charged us each individual pound), soft taco dinner and 3 orders of Gar Par Fries.  She also was very good at following up with my brother-in-law for the side of his meal after she forgot to ask the first time.

The food came out fairly quickly and was hot.  The Gar Par fries came first (wow!  a lot of gar par sauce which was excellent) and then the wings.  However, we had to check in with Jassica for a missing pound of wings that she followed-up with the kitchen.  Later on after we finished our dinner, Jassica's shift was ending so she asked us if it would be okay to cash out before we leave.  We agreed and we had to ask another waitress for our take-out containers.  The new waitress had to ask if we paid and good thing Jassica was there afterwards to clear up with her that we did.

We definitely enjoyed our meal and experience but there was somewhat of a disconnect and smoothness of the night.  Jassica did wish us goodbye as she left to go home.  She was okay to deal with but if she just tightened a few things up, she'd do great in the future!"}
{"text":"Sunday evening, came here for my father-in-law for Father's Day.  This is my absolute favourite wing place, bar none!  I have come here more often than any wing place or any other Wild Wing in the GTA area.  It is also my sister-in-law's favourite wing place as well.  

I will explain why Wild Wing is my absolute favourite wing place:

1) The wings are big, breaded, crispy, juicy and delicious.  There are no flimsy, burnt, tiny, stick things, which are sorry excuses for wings with only 2 bites of meat.  Every bite is awesome and you fill up your tum tum with each bite of chicken.

2) The Snakebite flavour (Hot & Yellow Mustard) is truly my favourite taste of wing I have ever had in my life.  This is preference but I have found none better for myself.  The Snakebite flavour is spicy (not too hot) and terribly sour... I am licking my chops and suckin' on my fingers while making the kissing sound.  Best for me!

3) Gar Par Fries.  Take golden, crispy fries and put garlic parmesan sauce all over.  Perfectly LOVE this side order.  They also give the option of getting the Gar Par on the side so you can dip it yourself.

4) At this Scarborough William Kitchen location, they give generous sauce portions.  They do not give little drizzles of sauce or dinky lines of Gar Par on their fries as do other Wild Wing restaurants I have been to.  They do not disappoint!  Whenever I order my Snakebite wings, they just load/coat the wings to the point that you no doubt can taste the flavour.  Because they put lots of sauce, you can dip part of wing that lacks the coat.  This location is the ONLY one I have been to which DUMPS Gar Par sauce all over their fries.  They always give more, and as a customer, I take note of that greatly.

This is why I have been a loyal customer here for years.  The service is normal and satisfactory but it's a place where they serve phenomenal wings and a place where my wife and her sisters can eat and hang out.  Until they stop being generous with their sauces, I will always come here to feast."}
{"text":"Never been to Wild wing before. Can't say I'll go back. At least to this location. Service was terrible and the food was decent. Bartender/Server was to focus what seemed to be her boyfriend at the bar and occasionally going out for smoke breaks out front with him. 
Later told a customer (you should have came out and got me! I didn't see you go on) ...."}
{"text":"Thursdays - $13 for pint and 1 lbs wings. Great deal i say! 

Massive wings menu. It took 10 minutes to decide on a flavour. Settled for the gar par. Messy goodness! Their wings are pretty big, coated, fried, well dressed. 

Beer is cold and refreshing.

Service was friendly and attentive. 

Patio was pretty  big with some shaded areas and nice to chill out at. 

Washrooms were clean *huge plus* :)"}
{"text":"Went here with a party of 10. The waitress was really nice and seated us quickly. She was quick to get our drinks and also didn't mind having to split the bill 5 ways.

I split the wing sampler with my friend. 20 non-breaded wings, 4 flavours, and fries for $26. I don't know where they got these wings, but they were TINY! They must have gotten them from baby chicks or something. The flavours were delicious but the size of the wings left me hungry, and I'm a small girl who doesn't eat a lot.

I also tried the deep fried pickles, they were super bland. 

If you do go here, don't get non-breaded wings. Also, sweet escape is a really really really good, non-spicy flavour."}
{"text":"Oct 7, I placed a take out order,  4 different flavoured wings totalling 50.29.
As this was the second time we were disappointed I felt I needed to call and speak to the manager. The wings were very dry and some when you bit into them even the bones crumbled.
'The Manager' was not receptive to my call. He didn't want to listen to my complaint. Well I'm really sorry when you first opened your wings were 5 star, now I find it difficult to give  1 star at the very best.

Barbara"}
{"text":"MEH. Came here on Nuit Blanche night because all the good restaurants were packed. I wasn't expecting much, and Wild Wing delivered exactly that - not much.

My friends and I shared a few appetizers... We got the pizza bites, veg nachos, and honey BBQ wings. Although the prices seemed really affordable at first, the portions were horrifyingly stingy enough to match the prices. The pizza bites were about $8, I believe, and there were three of those tiny little things in one serving. The $11 nachos were also served on a ridiculously small plate. You can't really deceive people when it comes to wings, because a pound is a pound! The wings were good, though.

Service was okay. The place was small. Run along to anywhere else on Queen Street."}
{"text":"If you're looking for Buffalo wings, don't look here. 

Very forgettable. Reminds me of Applebee's. Except that place is more comfortable. 

Only positive is Tue is half priced for a single order, so it wasn't a big waste of money."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite wing place when I'm in Canada. I fell in love the last time I was in Toronto so I stopped here after getting in town. There wasn't anyone in the building, so we were instantly greeted. Our waitress was very nice and super attentive to us. We ordered the double wing order with spicy gar par and honey jerk and sweet potato fries. OMG!!! The spicy gar par is to die for! I wasn't a personal fan of the honey jerk but my husband loved them!! The sweet potato fries were amazing as well!! We topped our orders off with jack and cokes. Overall, I am very happy with this place and we will definitely stop by before we head back home!!"}
{"text":"It's our first time trying Wild Wing. The location at Yonge and College had a patio and it was a nice evening so we decided to eat outside.
They had a 2 for 1 option for appetizer with the purchase of a drink that is valid after 9pm Monday to Thursday. The server said we can order pop to take advantage of the 2 for 1 but instead of free refills we only get the one glass.
We ordered the potato chips and the calamari. The potato chips was ok. I expected it to be crispy but it's not and is a bit over-seasoned. I ate them with lots of ketchup and that made it better. The calamari were really small bite-size pieces - battered and crunchy. I liked them and it came with its own dipping sauce. 
Since it was our first time, we decided to try their Wing Sampler which was really good value. You get to choose 4 flavours and you get 20 wings in total. There were a lot of flavors to choose from and the level of spiciness are also indicated. We ordered the BBQ flavor, Blue Cheese, a level 4 spice flavour (I forgot the name) and Maui Waui which has pineapple flavour. The BBQ flavor was the best of the four. I liked the level 4 spicy flavor one which was not really that intense. Just a little kick and sour taste to it and I also liked the blue cheese. The pineapple flavour one was not good. I didn't enjoy it at all but it's not like I can't eat it at all. The flavour just didn't work. Not ordering pineapple flavour for sure next time.
The service was ok. We took a bit of time deciding but our server was very patient and she explained how it all works. 
The wings were good - it didn't come out fresh and hot but it was very flavorful. It's also smaller than other wing places we've been. 
They also have a washroom but you have to go down the stairs to get there. It was clean though. They don't use paper towels - only the hot air machine to dry your hands which I don't prefer using.  
If you are going to sit at their patio, do not sit close to the street at night because bums come up to you and ask for change etc. They are generally harmless though and we just said no. 
Overall, I would go back again just to explore the other flavors that they have and maybe watch games."}
{"text":"We came initially with a group of 4, and 4 others arrived afterwards. We ordered 125 wings for our group, it took about 20 minutes. The wings were decent, I'll admit that. They had a lot of flavours to choose from, some were just plain weird though.

The atmosphere of the place isn't bad, for some reason they like to play music from the early 2000's, though. 

We went on a Friday night. There seemed to be only 2 waitresses running the whole place. We were seated near the door. We always had to wait a long time for our waiter as she would go up the aisle and totally miss us. We literally all had our hands up and she literally did not notice us. It was not even that busy.

To sum it up, I had a bad experience here. There was even gratuity automatically placed on the bill, which our group really disagreed with.

Definitely do not recommend this place, especially if you have a large group."}
{"text":"Ahhhh it's okay.. I would rather all star wings.. it wasn't bad it was just okay... sauce was kinda cold... good flavor.. good place to go out with friends"}
{"text":"I'm surprised that this place hasn't shut down yet due to lack of customers.
But good thing it didn't, so I can come here time to time when I run out of other places for UFC.
Food is really bad. Service is meh. The girls look like they are miserable."}
{"text":"Went here for a late night snack. I got my usual favourite of Sweet Escape (honey garlic with gar par) and it did not disappoint. We also ordered smokin' ranch (smokey bbq & ranch) and we found this be unpleasantly sour tasting. I don't think we'll be ordering that again. Our two flavours came with fries. Servers were nice."}
{"text":"Came here with the softball team after the game and it was a regretful choice.  They did not inform us that they only had 1 deep fryer going and we had a group of ~12 people.  The waitress was clueless.  Basically, half of the group ate while the other half waited and then we switched.  We waited more than an hour to even get the first batch so it was close to a two hour wait for the second.  Then after admitting that there was only one fryer going, she offered us a discount but things got even more complicated she couldn't figure out how to split the bills properly.

The wings were dry and the chicken wings were shrivelled.  Just don't go here, even if you have low expectations."}
{"text":"I used to be a regular here years ago. They changed suppliers along the way and never recovered."}
{"text":"Why does my local wild wing location suck so much ? 

I think the owners are completely useless , I think they would be better off if they stayed at home & hired a \"real\" manager to run the floor of their restaurant .. the servers are lacking energy .. Customer service is brutal , maybe you'll get lucky & get a better waitress , but then again they are pretty bad , they tend to say oops I forgot to put your order in while they all congregate at the bar milking their hourly wage while ignoring you because your order hasn't come in nearly 45 mins !! 

And then there's the food .. So it finally comes .. and was it worth the wait?? .. the wings , you better not mess up the wings .. Fortunately .. It was acceptable .. 

But .. We ordered a big variety of items as well , all the hot dogs ( don't waste your money , better going to get street meat dt for 3 dollars and loading it up yourself ) 

Calamari is a near pass perhaps ... 

The fries and chilli was the most disappointing thang.. Your better off eating Taco Bell fries supreme & get your money's worth .. it was a heavy goop of mess .. 

This is by far the worst wild wing location .... 

it's my Neighborhood joint .. But like joints .. You gotta toss em in ashtray .. 

Will definitely not come back"}
{"text":"Stopped in to get 1 order of wings to go on a Tuesday at 1:30 in the afternoon. Been waiting 25 minutes and it's not like it's packed for lunch, just 4 tables - 2 of which look like they're finishing. Waitress doesn't even bother to update/check if there's something I want while I wait. Fries didn't taste fresh."}
{"text":"Good wings and ribs, hamburger was plain, a little turned off when I went to the washroom and there was dried blood on the urinal. The staff should check once in a while if they are clean.
Came again and ordered a rack of ribs they told me they can only give half a rack as they do not have enough, half the table was served other half waited a half hour This is a joke this place"}
{"text":"I would like to change my rating up to a 4 star since their service has since gotten better for delivery. They pick up on first time, and are quite accurate with their orders. No complaints from me. Maybe they got more reliable staff now :)"}
{"text":"Been twice - never going back. The food is good but by far the worst service I've ever had. Took 15 minutes for someone to come by and offer us drinks - another 10 before we actually got them. Ordered a draft - it was flat and piss warm. Another 15 minutes or so went by before we got to order food - took about an hour to get it. Was there for almost 3 hours and saw the server maybe 3 times. Don't care if they're understaffed - service is brutal"}
{"text":"Don't go here . Service is terrible. Ordered a 5 level spice and it was a 1. Level 4 spice was hotter than the 5. I complained and she just dumped more sauce on it that wasn't spicy. I asked for hot sauce and they don't have hot sauce. How pathetic. They also rushed us to order drinks and food when we just sat down. It was busy on a Tuesday night. TUESDAY NIGHT THE TIME OF HALF PRICE WINGS. Not even busy. Three table tops. Honestly if I saw the rating here I wouldn't have came to this location and went to the Richmond Hill location. They're a lot nicer for sure. Honestly if I could curse here I would, all I can say don't even think about setting foot here and drive towards it. I rather you go to Walmart and buy a loaf of bread and be happier. Always I wrote a long email to wild wings . And it's independently owned, so everything I wrote was sent to the restaurant . Guess what a week later , no reply to my email. Customer service is absolutely sh*t."}
{"text":"Maybe it's the understaffed staff at lunch or maybe it's this location, but the food is below average and the waitress isn't very attentive. We were ready to order and she was flipping through her handbag at the bar. I waved my arm, called for her, and yet no response. She comes over later and claims to have been daydreaming ... Wow.

As to the food, I got the Wild Crunch burger which was average ... Nothing special at all. Fries had no seasoning but that might be how they do it.

Not sure why I returned to this place, maybe I should go elsewhere for lunch."}
{"text":"Not sure what's going on with these wing establishments in Thornhill? Can't a girl just get decent service with some tasty wings and beer too?

After driving around & calling places for Tuesday Wing specials, I found myself at Wild Wing. The service was mediocre at best. My poutine came out about 10 minutes before my dates wings. Even though we were sharing, the timing was just odd. There's something about waiting for everyone's meals to be plated and served before devouring your own. Not like we cared too much last night - we were starved! 

Beer was cold and the breaded wings were good. The server just needed a coffee or a beer or some type of pick me up cause she was lackin! I really don't like it when servers stare blankly at you waiting for you verse your order. Take charge and ask me if I'm ready! Please, don't just stand and make me guess if you're there to take my order, drop off my bevy or to say hi. It's all too confusing when you're hungry!

PS Wild Wing, y'all need bigger TV's."}
{"text":"Every single time I say I'm going to give Wild Wings a chance, something always always always goes wrong. The last time I dined in Wild wings, I had asked for Parmesan Garlic Wings, was told they didn't have it. Cool, the server suggested another flavour that was similar to what I had asked for. I had also asked for the wings to be EXTRA SAUCEY because I mean, who doesn't like saucey wings. Anyways, when I had received the wings, they were dry. REALLY DRY. Told the waiter this isn't what I had asked for and for her to asked them to be re-made. She didn't agree with that idea and told me she would see if she can help me out. She took my wings, and when she brought them back, they just added ranch sauce to the wings....... I absolutely HATE ranch sauce. was not pleased with this service. On top of that she told me she was going to charge me $1.00 for the sauce that she added AFTER getting my order wrong. 

This time I had called to make an order because usually on Friday's we order take out for the employees. They decided to go with Wild Wings although I had told them it wasn't a good choice. We ordered a Greek wrap, Wings and Fries. When we went to go pick it up, they forgot to pack the dipping sauce but charged us for it. Not a problem, mistakes happen all the time. When we called to ask them about it, they told us they would have to charge us EXTRA for the dipping sauce that THEY forgot to pack. HOW IS THAT FAIR? Anyways, We ended up getting another choice of meal for half price and didn't end up paying for the dipping sauce. We didn't realize the Greek wrap doesn't come with any meat inside. Actually, NONE of the wraps   come with meat inside. SO, I'm paying, $9 for a wrap with no meat......... OH and it's $4 to add meat inside. That's ridiculous. I highly recommend you to inform your customers that all of the wraps are vegetarian and to add meat it's $4... The lady at the front desk checked the website and didn't know any of the wraps didn't have meat in it.

Very unprofessional, not satisfied. Today will be THE LAST time I ever have Wild Wings."}

{"text":"I dont really eat chicken wings as a meal, its just not my thing so I got the lucha libre tacos and all I have to say is GROSS. They were bad,bad,bad. Under seasoned, small and the tortilla bread was horrible. I dont know what I expected but I didn't expect it to be as bad as it was. They were COLD. Our group was the only people in the place and we could never find our waitress she kept disappearing to somewhere into the back which is really unhelpful when we seem to the the only people in there for the entire time we were there. 

The food honestly is hard to explain how bad it was. I've had better food come from the freezer section at No-frills. I will not be returning nor will i return to any wild wing. The food and the service were both lacking."}
{"text":"I ended up eating here twice in a three day period since my hotel was in the same plaza. I really liked this place. They have about 50 different flavors of wings and I loved each one that I tasted. The Poutine was out of this world too. 

If you're feeling that the wings aren't spicy enough like I was.. ask the bartender or waiter to give you a side of sauce with a bit of the special hot sauce that they use with a dropper.. That'll open up the pores"}
{"text":"So we went here to watch UFC and eat because we were starving. There were no seats or tables so we decided to just drink and watch tv and starve because there was nothing to eat on. Spoke to 3 different workers and NOBODY told us there was a $20 minimum per person. The boss made it seem like we could just stand and watch UFC and chill like everyone else no problem! But we decided to be nice and order beer for us 4. Came out to about $52. And now they were closing so wrapping us up she asked if I wanted to round it to $80. At first I was like \"excuse me?\". She explains the $20 minimum fee and I said \"nobody mentioned anything like that to us.\" She told me it was in their sign at front (which by the way is only seen when u EXIT the restaurant). So we starved, didn't even have a TABLE and they want to charge us $80? Are you kidding me? We ended up paying but never am I coming back to this. If we actually sat down and got to USE their restaurant I 100% agree with the $20 fee...but if we are forced to stand around basically waiting for a table the entire night, that's just robbery!! 
And she was rude enough to take away the pay machine and allow me to \"ponder\" as she put it. I'm a server/bartender, I know rude drunk idiot customers, we were not them. We were treated however much worse. 

No thank you Wild Wings. Good-bye."}
{"text":"Me, with a bunch of friends were here to watch the  \"toronto RaPTors \" last night.. glad we choose this place.., perfect spot  if you were to watch any sport event with some good food to snack on..the place was surrounded with large wide screen TVs plus projectors for screening ..had an awesome night watching the game..even though the place was pretty packed, I have to mention about their excellent and efficient service.. servers were very friendly and attentive the whole time.. suggested we try their new menu items .. nachos n flat bread were a real treat..\" a must to try, delicious and healthy bar food..love ur new menu items.. & always a lover of ur saucy wings..  you got me coming for sure."}

I clearly mentioned it to the girl in the bar that its to go & she said she will charge full amount as its to go & Tuesday special doesn't apply. I said its fine and it took sweet more than 20 mins & no  sign of my to-go. I called up few guys as i was missing my movie, waited for 5 more
Mins, that girl who was supposed to check on the order was doing everything except checking on the order, when i asked after 5 mins she said few more mins. I lost my patience & said cancel the order. She was like ok & checked with her lead & took some more time. Finally they agreed to cancel & wen she came to me to cancel she literally threw the debt machine for refund.  I really dont want to continue writing the review further.."}
{"text":"Wild Wing, did I really? Yeah I did! If you haven't figured it out on your own, it's a wing place. Wings, wings and more... you guessed it, wings! Traditional, boneless or naked, you'll find oodles of flavours. Being the blonde haired, blue eyed yelper I am, I figured it only appropriate my Wild Wing virginity be christened by a pound of Blue Eyed Blonde. Yep, this blue-eyed blonde has an extra pound of Blue Eyed Blonde now in her belly. The chicken wings themselves were a good size. I'm not sure I'd order the same kind again. I wasn't a fan of the wings being smothered completely in blue cheese sauce. I can think of better sauce smotherings for the Blue Eyed Blondes.

The place itself is alright. It wasn't busy, but the service was good and I enjoyed the wing/beer special. One pound of any wings and a beer for under $13. Add an extra thirty cents if you'd prefer some yummy WR Velvet Fog that's on tap. Yeah that's right, you can get a coupla local brews on tap :). Yay! 

If you're headed in on a cold night, sit on the west side of the room if there's a table available. You'll avoid the draft from the door. It can get c-c-c-coooooold! Brrrrrr.

I'm not as impressed with the buckets of Molson, Corona and Coors to throw your chicken wings into, or the big MCC logos all over the walls, and hearing that Wild Wing also has its own Wild Wing girls isn't exactly something to bring me through the door again (although maybe it's your thing!). 

Overall, it's an alright spot. It's cool we've got a joint that's all about wings.. it'd be cooler if it were something local that you couldn't find anywhere else, but hey, we've gotta start somewhere, right?"}
{"text":"So many negative reviews, but I had a positive experience here on a Tuesday for their Tuesday deal and to catch a Raptors game. The wings were your typical Wild Wings wings. Place was pretty empty for prime dinner time. (Live near another Wild Wings location and it is insanely busy, especailly when the Raps are playing)

The lady (probably the manager) is pretty talkative and funny. Checked up on us regularly and didn't bother too much when we wanted to stay a bit longer for the game."}
{"text":"Honestly this place was pretty awful.  It takes a lot for me to give a 1 star review and no place tempted me more than this Wild Wing.

A friend of mine who loves the Wild Wing chain recommended we try their wings while cruising around.

The bar was not that busy when we arrived (There were 3 of us) there were about 4 tables of people there.  It took an hour and a half for us to get our wings which is unacceptable; and I only thing we got them that \"quickly\" because I asked one of the waitresses what was taking so long and she told me that once you order it takes 20 minutes for it to get to the kitchen.

The bar had barely any people in it, why would it take that long.

When we finally got our food it sure was ok.  Just ok.  I had the \"country girl\" wing sauce it was hard choosing because they have a large selection of sauces but apparently to get a lot of their sauces they just mix others together.  

The sauce was ok but the wings were awful.  For taking so long to get to us they sure weren't hot and honestly look they were just sitting finished in the kitchen a while ago and someone forgot to bring them out.  But hey at least their fries were ok and the gar-par was fairly priced.

Still I would NOT recommend this place to anyone.  There are far better bars in the area to get wings from.

{"text":"I come here pretty often and I am usually satisfied with the food and service. Always a huge wild wings fan due to their variety of flavour choices. The waitresses never really followed up with us, and it's always a mission to get her attention. They have daily specials, so check it out before you come.
This place is pretty busy during NBA season!!! Let's go raptors!"}
{"text":"Horrible.

My girlfriend and I came here tonight. There was a huge party. We waited at the door for 10 mins. 

No server was in sight to assist us as they were both busy with the party. We finally sat ourselves... and waited! They were checking tables of other guests when they were busy with the party! get the attention of a server! 18 mins later my girlfriend got furious and tried to wave down a server and asked to speak to the manager... the server said there's no manager... how you run an establishment without an on duty manager makes no sense and instead of apologizing she made excuses.

We just walked out"}
{"text":"I had lunch at this Wild Wing today.  I've been to a couple Wild Wing restaurants in downtown Toronto and have liked them.

I got there at noon and the restaurant was quiet and sad.

There are nine wings to an order.  I hadn't had breakfast and knew I wouldn't have supper 'til late so ordered a double order with Dill-icious Honey and Whiskey Girl sauces.  I'm glad I ordered a double order.  Despite the sign on the wall behind me boasting that their wings are plump and juicy, mine weren't.  Mine were mostly small and overcooked.  The dill sauce was good but the BBQ and honey garlic sauces that were on them was mild ... so mild that I couldn't tell which was which.

I won't be going back to this location again."}
{"text":"Gord and I have been waiting for this Wild Wing to open. This chain has been popping up all over the place and we thought we'd wait 'til this one opened to try it since it's in our 'hood. It opened last week so we walked there for lunch yesterday.

They have a lot of guts opening two doors down from the Wheat Sheaf who are famous for their wings. St. Louis Wings and Ribs was across the street for a couple years but closed last year (I love their wings!).

According to their website ... Wild Wing restaurants are dressed up as old time saloons with pine covered floors and walls covered in chicken wire - to keep you caged in of course! Large screen TVs for the sports enthusiasts and lively music from our Wild Tunes video jukebox will keep your toes tapping!

There are horses running and John Wayne is on the wall which stay with the theme. But what's up with the palm tree?! How does that fit in in a \"saloon\"?

Their menu boasts 101 varieties of wings.  First you decide if you want them battered or not, then you choose your sauce, and then you choose your dressing for your veggies.

I ordered Whiskey Girl non-battered ... they were delicious!  Gord ordered Mango Chipotle battered ... his were delicious too.

The beer selection is pretty tame.

The food was good as was the service (we were the only ones there). We'd go back ... we still have 99 more varieties to try!"}
{"text":"Gord and I were going to a three hour Travel Photography 101 workshop this evening at Henry's.  Before the workshop, we met a Wild Wing at Church/Queen W for an early supper .. it's not far from Henry's.

Because it was fairly early, there were only a handful of people ... watching the EuroCup 2012.

They have taken some of their wings off the menu ... but there are still 90+ to choose from.

I ordered Come Get Some.  I like dill and found these were a bit bland.  Plus there was no other sauce to contrast the dill sauce.  They were okay, not great, and I wouldn't order them again.

Gord ordered Smokin' Dill.  His were much better.  The BBQ sauce gave them a kick.

Adam was our friendly server and took good care of us."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if they have changed management but oh my god does this place have the best Wings ever!! 100% Better than Duffs in my opinion .... 
I ordered a lb of wings with Cajun rub and a smokey BBQ on the side and they were HUGE and very juicy! 
Do not order the burger though ! My brother in law ordered it and it was not good at all.. Very dry and under seasoned beef .. However I don't think I'd order a burger in a Wing restaurant anyways .. 
Our waitress was sooo friendly and attentive ! She really knew her knowledge about all the sauces and rubs and paired me with a perfect combination!"}
{"text":"We ordered take out and couldn't wait for our food as we were so hungry at 6:30pm on a Sunday night. The girl who took out order was kind and very thorough with taking my order. 
I ordered hot wings level four hotness, but my wings were more mild and very salty. Two double bacon burgers we ordered did not have any bacon in it the burgers were cold and dry. A chicken quesadilla we also ordered was soggy and falling apart like it was dipped in water. We spent about $70 on this order and it was such a disappointment as the food we ordered was worse than a fast food burger joint. You should've ordered from McDonald's. I have ordered from other wild wings before so I know it's not the company but the location that was terrible. We all didn't even finish our food as the food we ordered was so unappetizing."}
{"text":"Honestly the best meal I've had in my life, I got the honey garlic + mystery and it was worth the wait, very zesty. If you ever need a good good wing, come to this sweet sweet spot."}
{"text":"Server lied to my face when I asked her for a coke and she said sure and got me a Pepsi instead, not even bothering to tell me assuming I wouldn't know. Also the food is alright but for the price it's not worth it, I would recommend other wing or bbq places. Also \"coke\" in question was 3 dollars and an ice tea was 3.50 and I'm pretty sure it did not say that on the menu, not 100% sure it did but that's a ridiculous price either way. Ended up not tipping because our server also lied to the table next to us about something else. One of the worst places I've been."}
{"text":"Ordered food for 6 people. Called ahead of time for pickup and was told it would be 25 mins. I arrived 30 mins later. Paid for the food, and waited another 30 mins for the food to come out!!! Only after I asked for a refund to go elsewhere did I get the food. We were in the car getting ready to come home when an employee came out to give us something they forgot. When I got home, I found my burger was not what I ordered. I just ate it anyway. 

I am not at all impressed with this restaurant, it's service, it's staff or the quality of the food. While I was as waiting for the food, the bartender and one other employee just kept looking over at me sheepishly. Thank god I had a friend with me to pass the time or I might not have been so patient. 

The restaurant had 3 tables full, and 2 single patrons at the bar. No excuse if you ask me."}
{"text":"Great food, friendly service and awesome location. It's a nice place to go for a drink and some chow. They have had live music in the past which I found was a definite plus. The prices are very reasonable and it won't break the bank. Close, easy access to the highway."}
{"text":"Kind server who remembers my order. Cold beer with excellent selection . Good food that's well prepared and tasty! Clean dining room with lots of room to sit. Fun games if those are your thing. This a great little spot to grab a bite."}
{"text":"Service is ok, fries are horrible. Last time I came I found a hair in my wings. Not acceptable!"}
{"text":"Not sure if it's just this location or others are the same.

I came here last year, it was just opened, everything is great, the service is good, the food is not bad.

This year, I came in with 10 people on a Tuesday night special for 1.5lb of wings for 9.99. (which is always been their tuesday night special).

We were REALLY disappointed that the wings has turned into a baby size. We liked it here before because the wing size was decent size, now what happened?? they kill the chicken too early or something?

The flavours are okay, the wet ones are wayyy too wet, too much sauce on it. The dry wings are good (lemon peppers!). 

And don't even bother ordering anything other than the wings, they are a fail.

we ordered Nachos, sweet potato fries and a Greek salad. First of all, nachos are so carelessly made, it's like I can make it myself, the fries are just okay, and the salad look like they just opened a pre-made bag of salad and dump it in there.They are worst than the food that a crappy bar would serve. Thumbs triple down on this.

No wonder there were no one in the restaurant when we went because people know to go for Duff wings next door instead of here.

I might go back to St. Louis wings, even their wings is better than what this Wild Wing location serves here. And at least St. Louis wings have awesome fries to go with."}
{"text":"I'm glad this place finally got closed down, as someone mentioned the waitress who is always on her phone and never attend to the customers really passed me off or help solve any problems and issue. I was served a jerk chicken chicken wing and the sauce was like a make shift toxin. It made me want to throw up and gag on the spot, called her over to let her know i have never had this \"jerk flavour\" and she had the audacity to say it's as authentic as I am going to get it. I told her she was making crap up and that authentic jerk don't taste like soap mixed, I quickly tossed it and told her \"fine, have it your way. Always being on the phone when it clearly shows a bad example to the customers/patrons that want to have a pleasant experience and will tip you.\" After that I never step foot to any wild wings location cause all they hire are jalopy waitress with absolutely no experience with customer services, as well understaff.
So happy they closed down!"}
{"text":"Completely effed up my order! 
Usually I go to the king & Bathurst location but I was near school so I figured what the hell. Total craving. 

The bartender/hostess was nice & since it was takeout, I didn't see the issue. I ordered bbq wings and spicy lemon (DRY RUB) ask me how the bbq ended up being teriyaki flavoured and the spicy lemon was deep fried with batter then sprinkled with salt and pepper. WTF! & the lady looked me straight in my face & told me it was my order. Why bother checking right? Since I was the only one there! 

Got home and opened that bee up and bam! What the eefff. I called to say my order was mixed up and was told the hostess wasn't there anymore... 
This location is a total no no."}
{"text":"The wings here are so salty! Have to drink a lot of water to balance! Chicken flatbread is good, seasoning is nice. I tried their new Fuji apple chicken salad ( with their special sauce), the dressing is weird: too sweet and sour for salad with chicken on it.
The service is pretty friendly."}
{"text":"The WORST service - and I mean EVER! Beyond bad. All the details would take too long to explain or describe, but just imagine the worst experience you've ever had and then double it and add 10. The wings were good, but I also received the WORST hot dog I've ever encountered - and I know hot dogs! I used to sell them! When I brought the unsatisfactory 'dog to the waitresses' attention she explained to me that they were known for chicken wings and NOT hot dogs. \"If I could have told you not to order it I would have,\" she said. \"It's terrible\" Seriously! She said this! I have witnesses. Then she just turned and walked away without the offending 'dog. But here's the kicker ... I ASKED HER IF THE HOT DOG WAS ANY GOOD BEFORE I ORDERED IT!!! She looked at me blankly, as though I'd asked her what the square root of 25 was, and said, \"I don't know if it's any good.\" So I can only assume she's maybe fibbing, or else she has a remarkably lousy memory - which means I just should have somehow known better and because of this (I'm guessing, anyway) the 'dog wasn't removed from the bill even though I sent it back and didn't eat it. When I asked her why I had to pay for the inedible hot dog, she replied, \"Thats just the way it is. You ordered it, you bought it. There's nothing I can do.\" This was alas, aside from ordering our food, the only interaction we had with her. She never once asked if we wanted another drink or anything else. To say she was uninterested in her job would be an understatement of the absolute highest order. She spent most of the time hovering behind the bar looking at her phone. At first I couldn't figure out why, on Super Bowl Sunday, we were the only people in a chicken wing joint in downtown Toronto. Now I know. Do yourself a favour and give this dump a swerve!"}
{"text":"This was the first Wild Wings and they have always treated me well here. So I come back when I can. The selection of different flavors is second to none. Also the selection between breaded and boneless as well as dry of wet wing selections are a draw in for me."}
{"text":"Good ambience and great for watching sports since it has big tvs all over. Service was friendly although slow even though it was busy. I got the Texas honey and spicy gar par...it was delicious."}
{"text":"I was there on the day of the Super Bowl (about 4 hours before kick-off). The food was disappointing. I ordered a spaghetti alfredo but it was luke warm. Unlike other restaurants where the server grind out the cheese table side, this place added cheese for you before bringing it to the table. I'm a cheese lover and they didn't add enough cheese. The kitchen was rather slow too as there's only a group of 2 aside from our party of 13. I wouldn't go back if they can't even handle light crowd like this"}
{"text":"I have a LOT to say about this place.

I personally work at a Wild Wings location but due to the fact that this is across my school and closer to my home, I used to visit on a regular basis with my friends. 

The \"manager (I think)\" is actually quite nice. (A foreign maybe in his 30's man) while all the other girls are rude, have LOTS of attitute and consists of thinking they're the s***. Let me also mention they are completely out of uniform. One time, there was a girl who was wearing a bandeau as her uniform with ALL HER HAIR DOWN & wearing tna pants. Completely unsanitary. Gross.
That same girl began to yell at me when I was argueing her about the fact that my take-out wings didn't come with a dip and veggies. I began to talk about how I also work at a Wild Wings and wings comes with a dip, people! While she kept on blabbing, I said to her how if a customer pays the same amount for takeout as they do for dine-in, they should get all the same things that come with it. She of course shut up and ran back into the kitchen, gave me a glare and said the exact words \"I'll give it to you THIS time, but consider this a warning.\" Like who do you think you are?

Will never return.
Ugh, writing this review makes me mad.."}
{"text":"We use to go to the Church St location and really enjoyed their food.  When we moved to the Queen St W area we decided to try this location.  Unfortunately different owner/management means different service and quality.  For example for the Double combo (2 flavours of wings) you must order the same type of wing.  One customer cannot order 1 set of boneless and the other 1 set of regular traditional.  Other locations you are very much welcome to do this.  Therefore, was disappointment bc my husband and I have different preference of the type of wings we wanted to eat so someone had to let it give. 

We ended up ordering boneless and they turned out to be VERY VERY dry and way over cooked.  Not to mention the portion sizes are alot smaller than other locations.  Eg. the chef took 1 boneless...cut it 1/2 and 2 halves counted as 2 boneless.  They cheap out in everything and the veggies portions were very small.  Another thing that was quite gross was the smell of the restaurant.  It smelled like a washroom so I really question the sanitary of this restaurant.  Overall, we won't come back and if we crave wings we need to walk to another location."}
{"text":"Checked out this spot as a last minute \"we need somewhere to eat before going grocery shopping so we don't buy stuff we don't need\" solution after there was no parking near the spots on Dundas we wanted to try. Regretted every minute of it.

When we walked in there was about 10 tables seated and it took 3-4 minutes for the server to come tell us we could sit where ever we wanted. This was annoying until we realized she was the only server on.

The service was incredible. For being the only person there, the woman working was extremely attentive, took an app and drink order quickly, and had everything at our table within a very reasonable amount of time. The nachos we ordered were alright, but we were starving and it's salty chips covered in cheese so we ate them all.

My s/o ordered wings and I ordered a burger with broccoli and cheese bites on it. The burger was a frozen patty, as were the nuggets of broccoli and cheese, so that's the kind of food you're getting. My s/o was pretty full from the nachos, but said the sauce on the wings was good. The fries tasted like they had been sitting under a heat lamp for a while.

I found it surprising to see \"no refills\" for the drink on the menu under the wing dinner, considering it costs about 5 cents to fill the cup, but again, that's the type of place you're at. I had a beer and my s/o didn't finish her pop, so it didn't matter to us.

As for the atmosphere, it's pretty bad. There was an entire chandelier that was burnt out, but maybe the owner is trying to save money by keeping it off? I assume burnt out though because none of the chandeliers were fully lit, most only had 2-3 bulbs lit. 

The only thing that saved the experience from being completely terrible was the waitress. I hope she finds a job somewhere else because she'd make a killing providing service like that elsewhere, and this place is definitely going to go under."}
{"text":"I had to share a horrible experience we had a Wild Wing Restaurant in Oakville. We ordered 3 lbs of their naked wings with seasoning. I should have took a picture of these wings my goodness like they were so small tasteless and the worst wings I have eaten ever. On a Sunday night they had only one waitress poor thing working. I wrote to the telling them how awful the food was  and how it wasn't fair for them to have only one waitress serving 15 tables here's their response. and this is their response. Really the best chicken absulote rubbish ..
I just wanted to speed the word. Save your time, money and appetite for a more reputable establishment

The red dirt road (pulled pork with jalape√±os)   was very delicious,  it looked as if the 17  year old kid in the kitchen just didn't care and threw it on the bun.  Tasted great,  but looked like - - -.   One server was awesome.  The others just looked like they were in a miserable mood and didn't give  a hoot.  This is a local area for me,  and sadly,  I think this will be the last time I come here.   No music.  One person kept asking the bar staff to change the channel from tennis to hockey to baseball to who knows.  Make up your mind for Pete's sake.   Maybe I have to come in with a group to make it worthwhile for the Manager?   Oh,  forgot to say.  Only 7 other people in the restaurant.  Sad for Gtown.  And almost forgot,  Don't order the mozzarella sticks.  It's like something from Metro that no one knew how to cook."}
{"text":"Overall impression: Wild Wing has decent food but the service is lacking.


Friends and I went to Wild Wing on a Tuesday night after finding out St. Louis Bar and Grill had a long wait time. 

There were a few patrons at this place.

We were seated and served water right away. Our server took our drink orders. They arrived shortly. It took longer than usual to take our food orders (about half an hour later) when the place was almost empty.

The server finally came and took our orders. I ordered for my partner who was joining us a little later. All of us ordered a pound of wings and I ordered my partner chicken greek salad with the dressing on the side.

My partner arrived at the pub and ordered a glass of wine. The server did not pour her a glass of water and did not receive the wine throughout the night.

It took 45 minutes to receive our food.

The wings were crispy and sauce was moderately marinated on the wings. My partner said that the salad was good without the dressing.

The server was missing throughout the night. It took us 20 minutes to get the bill after requesting it. We noticed they charged my partner the glass of wine she never received."}
{"text":"With Buffalo Wild Wings just down the road, and All Star Wings not too far away there definitely must be a strong desire for wings in the area, and stiff competition. Unfortunately Wild Wings has come up with the short end of the stick. 

It's not from a lack of trying that's for sure, the service was friendly, but the product left much to be desired. We didn't like the heavy breaded wings, not overly thrilled with the sauces either. The burgers had pretty bad flavor and I couldn't blame the kids for not eating them. The wait for the food was a bit much considering we were the only people eating in there. There were a couple other rather gruff looking regulars having a few drinks aside from ourselves. 

The selection of beers wasn't vast, but varied of the usual suspects. 

The service was great, but I didn't like the product put in front of me, unfortunately the service couldn't make up for that. If you like breaded wings maybe you'll like it here, but it wasn't for me."}
{"text":"Went there after hockey and service was awful ...took 15 minutes before a server came over.  Afterwards they brought us a jug of \"skanky\" beer and we complained and the server just said that's the way it is. Obviously they didn't clean the lines or had old beer ... just terrible. Food was acceptable, but all the other factors make this a Wild Wing to avoid."}
{"text":"COCKROACHES!! I have ordered take out from here a few times but this is the first time I actually dined in, and I really wish I hadn't. The food was ok, but towards the end of the meal, we noticed two cockroaches on our seat and on the table. We managed to trap one under a plate and immediately called the waitress over. Not only did she not apologize or offer any type of discount, but actually asked us where it came from, and suggested it might've come from our bags or boots. This is absolutely unacceptable and I will not be going here again. Save your money and go elsewhere, I was beyond disgusted with both the lack of cleanliness and service."}
{"text":"Went to Wild Wing with some friends and the service was pretty great. The food came out quickly, and our waitress was fun and understanding when we took a million years to decide on our wing flavours! 

The wings themselves were pretty big and you get about 10 or so (of course, depending on how many you order!). I personally had the GarPar wings (for the first time ever) and they were DELICIOUS! I'm a sauce person; dipping sauces for pizza, etc. What I loved about Wild Wing was that they were generous with their sauces on the wings-- when I went to Wacky Wings and had the same wings, you would have thought they were suffering a shortage of sauces they were so dry. Automatic disapproval to the nth degree. I do NOT like dry foods. 

That being said, the only reason for lack of 5 full stars is because the tables could have been a little cleaner! Other than that, no complaints :) We all left satisfied, and our wing cravings were successfully satiated."}
{"text":"One of my friends and I frequent this location about once a month for some disgustingly good deep fried food. We usually get one of the wing platters that lets you try 4 different flavors of wings and an fries or onion rings to round out the meal.

First of all, one term that you need to know: gar-par. Nothing better than gar-par - get it on your wings, get it on your fries, get it on your onion rings... get it on anything you can because gar-par stands for garlic-parmesan and its to DIE for. 

Now, onto the important part: the wings.

We've always gotten bone in wings - if you're going somewhere for wings, what the hell is the point of getting \"boneless\" wings? Part of the fun is sucking the chicken off the bones - but I digress. When it comes to wing flavors, this place takes the cake in my opinion. While they have a LOT of flavors, I have yet to try any that are offensive. There are a few that I don't like but really, with that many flavors, everyone will have a favourite. Some of the more notable flavors (the ones that we tend to repeat) include: Whiskey Girl (BBQ&Dill), Gar-Par (Caesar&Parmesan), Farmer's Daughter (BBQ, Medium&Wild Jerk), Spaghetti Western (Medium, Parmesan&Italian Seasoning - my least favourite thus far) and anything off the Smokey part of the menu.

Overall, I really like this location. Every time we've been we've had a different server but the staff here are really great. We always get a warm welcome when we walk in, whether they're busy or not, and the wait staff always approach with a smile and are willing to recommend wing flavors, specials, etc. We usually go on Tuesday nights and we have yet to be there when its really really busy, even with the Leaf Game on. Service is prompt, our food always arrives faster than we expect it to and we generally have a really good meal every time we eat here. 

If you're looking for a good wing joint, you can't go wrong with Wild Wing."}
{"text":"Do not order off uber eats!!! They took 1hr longer than promised. When i called, they did not give me straight answers and tried to get me off the phone. Very disappointed"}
{"text":"We came here on a Tuesday at 8 PM during game night and it was not that busy. It appeared that there were only two servers and one bartender servicing the entire restaurant.

I decided to sit on the patio and wait for my friends. First thing I noticed was that all the seats had bird crap on them. The tables were dirty and they weren't wiped. Some of them were falling apart.

While waiting, the workers were nice enough to bring a TV outside onto the patio even though they already had 2 TVs inside facing outside. It was a nice gesture nonetheless.

When my friends arrived, we ordered and decided to go sit inside since it was getting a bit chilly for one of them. There was a wing special, where you get half priced wings with the purchase of a beverage. The waitress mentioned that the computer only accepts 1 pound and that we can't get a double order with that deal. I thought this was ridiculous because St. Louis lets us order two pounds on special. My friend wanted to order cider but they were sold out as well.

It felt like a long time before our food arrived. Probably about 40 minutes.

When the food arrived, it was okay. Nothing spectacular. I have the say that the entire experience was mediocre and I'd probably never come here again."}
{"text":"Mixed feelings.... service was horrible but wings were the tastiest I've had in a while. Try spicy Gar Par. Tuesday night they had 12 wings for price of 8 when u buy a drink."}
{"text":"I am thoroughly shocked that anyone has had a positive experience with this specific location. Since its so close to me, I've tried to go back several times to give them a chance to redeem themselves, and each time they consistently remind me to stop coming back...and now I have  to warn others to save their money! As people can see from my reviews, I rarely mention when I have a negative experience, but as I said I felt it was my responsibility to warn others. I went by on several different occasions with one other person, and walked into an almost empty restaurant and told to sit anywhere I like. When I sat at a table for 4 facing the TV, I was then asked to move to a table for 2 after being told to sit wherever I want. When asked why, I was told to make space for the busy night they were anticipating....Tuesday night with the hockey game already started and maybe 2 other tables eating in the whole restaurant but ok. I then had to beg the waitress to serve our table constantly as I watched her stare off into the distance pretending I didn't exist, looking out the window as if she was ready to run out the door and not return. My friend had the wings which were ok, but not great considering wings are their thing...I had the most disgusting quesadilla that literally had cheese, fake chicken and that's it folks...not a single other thing was on this plate - I again had to beg the waitress for some sour cream or salsa as she brought it over with an annoyed look on her face. All around the food sucks, and so does the service so why even go to this crap hole? If you really love the wings, order in so that you don't have to be subjected to this horrible dingy bar. By the way, the restaurant never did fill up, and instead chose to piss off a real live customer that was sitting in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Never going back here again. 

Went last Tuesday for wing night and saw that you could get your wings in 2 different portions - \"Single\" (1 pound for $15) or \"Double\" (2 pound for $27). So we decided to share the double, and each ordered a favour (NOTE: waitress responded \"oh that's a great choice :) !!!)

When we got our bill, we were charged for the whole amount and when i asked, her response was \"oh, the half price is only when you get single.\"

?????????? why the fuck would anyone pay more (almost twice as much) to get the same amount of wings on a wing fucking night???

She did not even apologize until I've mentioned that it really was not cool. And even then, she went \"oh, well sorry about that.\" That really is not the way you treat your customers and I sincerely hope she won't mistreat any more customers."}
{"text":"We usually get take out from this location, so the review is strictly for their food, and not their service. 

The four star rating is for their wings...I am in love with their Smoky GarPar, although their Smoked Thai, and Brown Eyed Girl (Honey Garlic & Mystery sauce) are good too.  For $10, you get a single order (usually about 9/10 wings) - crispy and smothered in delicious sauce AND a drizzling of garpar (which is exactly what it says it is: garlic parmesan dressing). 

Their starters and fries are decent - I'll sometimes get the fries with gravy, or the mac and cheese. But I admit, I go for the wings. This place definitely hits the spot when I get a craving for some crispy goodness."}
{"text":"We came to Wild Wings for some wings (surprise). It was good we had a few mild wing types and with over a hundred flavours to choose from it was quite nice. But we wanted one order of really hot wings and we ordered the supposedly the hottest on the menu but it wasn't that hot at all and we were disappointed with it. The service was ok, but found ourselves looking for the waitress to help get a refill for our drinks. 

At the end I think you can find better service and better wings for a better price elsewhere but they have the unique 101 flavours thing that's intriguing and that's it."}
{"text":"Wings were soft and bad... Cocktail southern ice tea was poorly mixed.. 
Overall this location is going downhill.. couple more months before it finally shuts it doors for good."}
{"text":"NB: I've come here for take out only! Called them up to place a take out order, they answered the phone (despite another yelper's bad luck detailed below) and placing the order was simple! I was looking for 2 single orders and they suggested getting a double order special that came with 2 flavours, fries, and 2 drinks for $24.99. 
Now, wings have quadrupled in price since the 90's it feels like, so I'm not saying that $24.99 for 16 wings, fries and drinks is some kind of steal, but with today's prices, it wasn't too shabby. 
I got the Canadian Honey(?) which was honey garlic & maple, and my SO got the dry lemon pepper wings. I personally loved mine, and they were a little overcooked but luckily I enjoy them like that. The fries were also regular pub fries, but a little magical when slightly over cooked with crispy shells...yummy!! We got a sad amount of carrots and celery but..who are we kidding? Just less to toss in the green bin. (JK. Sometimes I'll eat a carrot but celery is just a cruel waste). 
Would I get take out from here again? Sure. But given the price, it'll probably be a once in awhile treat instead of a weekly staple. Their menu is super confusing but one that I'd be happy to try and deliciously decipher!"}
{"text":"I would not go to this Wild Wings EVER! The customer service is retched. Went with my partner and he ordered a Veggie burger with fries - the burger arrived and it had a very distinct smell, he took one bite and almost threw up. 

We went to tell the Waitress that we are sorry but he couldn't eat this burger, in which the manager said \"no you have to take it, you ordered it.\" After about 15 minutes of saying that we can't even take another bite the waitress was able to convince the manager to let us try something else. We ordered the tacos which were cheaper, and the manager still charged us for the more expensive burger we didn't eat. The waitress felt so bad she gave back the difference from her tips. 

I didn't expect our food to be comped or anything, but when the food is inedible due to taste, you should at least offer something else. The manager felt it was beyond him to deal with it. 

Would NOT recommend this location"}
{"text":"So you gotta love the big juicy wings to come here.  They are like little breaded drum sticks.  We were really surprised how nice and filling they were, and the meal with fries and veggies sticks was under $14.  The portion of wings was very good, more than filling for my husband and I couldn't eat them all.  We ordered the regular bar b q which had a touch of sweetness too them and also the lemon pepper which was very pleasantly flavoured. The place is not fancy and probably could use a bit of sprucing up but the service was good, even when it got rather busy after 7pm.  The TVs are all flat screen and clear so if you are interested in a game, it is a decent place to go but get there early as is a bit smaller than other similar restaurants. I think the place is now under new management."}
{"text":"Came here last night with friends. The place isn't usually packed because of the area. The interior is a rustic/ranch style with dim lighting as there is a seated bar area.
There was only one employee working on the floor, a restaurant manager, and one kitchen cook. It took a while for our wings to come, we got the maverick (5flavours 5lbs) + the triple (3flavours 3lbs) comes with celery and carrots, seasoned fries, and calamari for 7 people. The food was alright but everything was a little pricey, I don't think the food was worth the price in my opinion."}
{"text":"The only 2 things positive about the place and the reason its not 1 star is the very kind and food service and their kids mac n cheese ALL the other food is not good, ALL the wings are extremely dry and over cooked, same goes for the burgers, we actually tried to replace them and asked them to cook it less (and they gladly did it), but it was all dry once again. 
Will not recommend! I will recommend the service team to find another job as the service level is way above the food level."}
{"text":"I've been to many wild wings and these are great like the rest. 

I love the boneless wings because I am a bit of a neat freak and I like to use a fork. Also, I think you get more meat per wing. 

Staff is very friendly at this location and always looking to make your night a more pleasant one."}
{"text":"Just next to the LCBO this Wild Wings has a very friendly staff. I am always greeted there with a smile. I love their food, they seem to put more sauce on their wings than most places but the downside is it seems to take them longer to prepare, not sure why."}
{"text":"Honestly I'm torn between a 2 star and a 3.  I gave it the 3 but only barely.   We bought a groupon and used it in Dec.  When we arrived around 5pm the place was empty.  We ordered (it was just the two of us), and our waitress was friendly and great to deal with.  No issues there at all.  The wings however were bad.  The texture of the wings were a chewy mushy consistency.  If I were to guess I'd say that they were cooked at too low a temp.  They were thankfully cooked all the way through, but the texture was horrid. 
Also on that visit the woman's bathroom stalls did not have the lights on and I had to use my cell phone to see the toilets.  One was covered in urine.  So this visit pretty much sucked.  Our waitress and my husbands company were the only redeeming features.

We wrote the company and received a discount if we came back.  Frankly since we are from out of town we didn't think we would use it, however found ourselves nearby a few weeks after with a larger group of friends so we thought we would give the restaurant a second try (other Wild Wing's in different cities have always been consistently better).

Again the service was good, although slow, since she seemed to be the only one working the floor and bar.

The discount was honoured, and we received our food.  Thankfully it was all in a much better condition.  Stuffed burgers, wings and jalepeno poppers were ordered.  This time our wings were almost crispy and for sure better than the first visit.  Making the longer wait time almost worth while.  Our friends said their burgers were cooked fine, but a bit bland.   Unfortunately overall I'd have to give this location a pass, especially with so many other options nearby.

One interesting thing about the location is that it holds local chess tournaments, as well as some other local based community events.  Too bad the food just can't match."}
{"text":"The wings here over time have gotten better . You got a good size portion of wings even on cheap wing night on Tuesday when it's half price . The flavour and the different kinds of flavour falls short of an 5 star wing place like all stars or something like duffs. It's decent for uptown Markham and the staff, although understaffed definitely work fast and are very efficient . If you like spicy wings, then the hottest wings 6 star are not hot enough . You need to ask them to make it spiciest so that you can get the true heat - only for true connoisseurs of hot wings for that flavour . Parking and facilities are good with a patio outside for the summer time . It's close to home in Markham and a good spot to hang


Here's a hint about half price wings Tuesday . It's only good for dine in as long as u order a pint per pound of wings . The key is that you can order a pound with a beer .. eat 1 wing or fry and then take them home for take out . If u order take out, there is no deal ."}
{"text":"Never been to Wild Wing. Came by for the halal wings! They were great.  Big wings, lightly breaded. You can coat it with the sauce of your choice. The wings were a lil crispy, just like I like it.

Tbh the wings were slightly dry, but still enjoyable.  

We went at like 12pm during the week and basically had the place to ourselves.  The server was very nice.

We were overwhelmed by the options in sauces. Took us forever to decide. But the good news is you can buy additional sauces on the side for 0.99.

We liked the Hot Honey Garlic sauce and the Smokin' Ranch.

Thanks for the halal wings, Wild Wing!! 
I would totally go back on account of the halal wings."}
{"text":"Got a double order for takeout, there are only 8 wings in each order. When we complained about the order not being even one pound of wings they said the naked wings are significantly smaller and that we should order breaded next time. The fries were heavier than all the wings. Not worth the price. Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Worst experience ive ever had at a restaurant. Which says a lot as my wife and I go out for dinner near 5 times a week. The so called  manager offered to have her boyfriend come to the restaurant to \"hit my wife in the face\" because she asked return the cheeseburger because it tasted too salty. The police had to come and everything, it was a total catastro phie!  Stay away from this loaction no matter what."}
{"text":"I'd stay away from this location. Walk in or via skip the dishes. 

We ordered one pound of wings. You figure a wing place wouldn't screw up a wing order. Guess what they did!  I get it, everyone is human, we all make mistakes. 

Getting a refund for the wrong meal being delivered was like pulling teeth. In addition, nothing else was done for the inconvenience. No credit for future orders, nothing. It's 2017, customer service is king.  You're not going to last long if this is how you treat your customers.  

Good riddance."}
{"text":"Service was excellent and good was amazing!

We went a few hours before the Mayweather Mcgregor fight.  The place was empty however they were booked up solid as of 8pm (it was about 730).  They happily took us in and more so provided fantastic service and didn't rush us at all.  

I asked a few questions about nutritional information which were answered in detail. 

Needless to say, their wings are fantastic, hot and fresh.  

The fries that accompany them are also great. Served with a bit of seasoning. 

I'd happily come back often!"}
{"text":"Currently here on the patio sipping on a long Island iced tea, which is very well blended may I add. The staff is super friendly and the location is very convenient. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for some good food and great customer service."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in a few months but I'm surprised at these reviews. Literally the best place to go to eat wings. I would recommend visiting again and asking to be sat with Nancy or Vivian, they are the best!"}
{"text":"Horrible service. Went to pick up take out and waited 45 minutes for food. 1 person in the kitchen and one waiter. The one at mcowan and finch is a lot better"}
{"text":"Six of us ordered 100 wings (the cowboy) which included:
- Ring of Fire (Dusted with some sort of hot spice, 
it destroyed my anus...i am still on fire)- Red hot and blue  (Blue Cheese and Hot)
- Sweet Cheeks (Honey Garlic and Mustard)
- Hot Honey Garlic

My fav. was sweet cheeks, which was new to me. 
The UFC event was on so it was  a good size crowd. 
Beer selection was good as well.

All and all pretty damn good!"}
{"text":"I think it has been a very long time since I had a great experience at Wild Wings. I really hated going to these franchises because 1.) There's mostly young girls that work there who really just there to make money and not actually serve. 2.) Service always suck, wings come out too late and pretty mediocre.

It was a Sunday afternoon and my boyfriend driven to two places that he wanted to try but were closed on Sundays. Instead of driving around again, he said let's do Wild Wings next door to the place that was closed.

We were greeted right away with menus. The guy was very friendly and super attentive. He wasn't too pushy and he continued to follow up on if we're okay, how's the food, filling our drinks. I was super surprised! He was definitely by himself and managed to get the food out to us quickly. 

The meat lover flatbread was delicious, it was half priced flatbread on Sundays with a drink. It was cooked to perfection and super crispy and flavorful. We got Smoky Gar Par and Sweatin bullets. Absolutely no complaints, fries and wings were amazing and the service was great.

It's crazy how one server can be a better server than the handful of servers at Davis and Eagle and the wild wings on Bayview."}
{"text":"In the hockey season, my house becomes a meeting ground of loud ruckus guys who just inhale food like no tomorrow.  In one session, the guys decided to give me a break and do take out at a local wing place.  After searching online, we found Wild Wing with it's ridiculously HUGE flavour menu.  We called and ordered $50 worth of wings that allowed us to choose up to 5 flavours.  They told us to come pick it up in 45 minutes.

When the guys went to go grab it at the 45 minute mark and they noted that the wings seemed to be lukewarm instead of hot.  It's great that the store made it faster than the alloted 45 minute but not so good when you do pick up and it's not fresh.  For $50, you get a fairly large bucket of wings.  I would say we probably counted around 30 to 35 wings or so.  The wing size were medium.  Some were scrawnier than others but they were ok meat wise.

In terms of the flavours, we got naked lemon pepper, honey garlic, desperado (a hot maple bbq), texas honey, and spicy bbq.  From a spiciness perspective, the medium heat isn't so bad.  If anything, I would say they're on the tamer side so anyone who is really worried about heat level... these won't kill you.  From a flavour perspective, they were ok.  I did like the naked lemon pepper the most as weren't sauced and you just had the deep fried crunch with a citrus touch.  I found the sauced wings not great and it's possible from the fact they just sat in the sauce too long.  They weren't crispy under the sauce and some of the sweet ones (like texas honey) were just too sweet... almost cloying.

Overall, it's not a bad option but I think the superstore chicken wings are just as decent and considerably cheaper (especially when they have deals!)"}
{"text":"Service was horrible! Some European lady with an accent came to take our order and right in the middle of my order she walked away and helped someone else! I called her back to ask her if we could finish our order. She rudely complied.. I was sitting on the far left of the bar and I could clearly see the kitchen. The server was sitting on a keg taking off her shoes and picking dirt from in between her toes.. I then saw her place carrots and celery with her dirty foot fingers into our plates! DISGUSTING! Food was alright. Will not be coming here again I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE"}
{"text":"Horrid location, and owner with attitude. Service was sub par as mentioned by others. We definitely wont be coming back to this location. If anyone deserves to go through financial straint, its this owner. I can't believe her arguing with customers on the floor (multiple ones too). Definitely doesnt know anything about customer service!"}
{"text":"Very fresh food, nice staff and prompt service. I have been to other Wild Wing locations but this one is one of the best. It may be small but it works."}
{"text":"Great selection and quality, very cold beer, friendly staff, prompt service, but not a place I'd wanna hang out too long after my meal, needs more ambience."}
{"text":"Good wings. Many sauces to try! They have dry powdered and wet wings which is great since not many restaurants do that. Close to UofT campus so it's a good hangout after class"}
{"text":"Good service! Great wings. They offer dry powdered and wet wings which are both amazing. If you're ordering more than a pound for 2 people then maybe you'd want them to stagger. The wings come out hot but was cold by the time we went though the 2 pounds of wings. Great casual atmosphere."}
{"text":"There once was a time, when wild wings meant quality. But that was a long time ago. Wild wings in general has dipped in quality, but after our most recent experience, never again. I used to love wild wings. You come in order your favourite flavour from their larger than life list of choices, and you get decent wings. But the wild wings I once loved has been reduced to higher prices, bready lower quality wings, and inexcusable service. 

In my last personal visit the wings were terrible, very bready, and there was gum left on my napkin from the last customers. But to be fair this was a different wild wings.

This wild wings in particular wasn't any better. We ordered wings for takeout and sent my brother to pick up the order. It was specifically ordered the day before to be ready and prepared for 11am. At 11, there's no one in the restaurant and the order isn't ready. It takes another half hour. When we finally get to tuck into some wings, we realize it's the wrong order. So we called wild wings and they already knew but didn't bother to call or say anything. So we go back to wild wings with the bag in hand and the lady working there literally takes the bag and hands it to the other customer, \"here, this is yours\". Disgusting!! I would have demanded a fresh batch. We didn't touch anything from the other order, but that's not the point. Where's the quality control? But they did try to make it up to us by giving us some free fries. 

Never again wild wings... never again..."}
{"text":"Neon assault and a side of wings please. Where this place lacks in atmosphere, it makes up for in television screens. The array of wing choices are kooky (caramel or taco) to downright tasty (maple and medium) and come with the requisite vegetable side of flaccid carrot and celery and ranch dressing. My delicate sensibilities aside, these wings are pretty tasty - heavily breaded in the style of a KFC wing on steroids, and well sauced. I wouldn't rave about Let's WIng It - but when you have the need for wings and you're in the area - go for it."}
{"text":"Very bad for take out.  Arrived at 9:50PM to the restaurant and it was not busy at all. I immediately placed a small order for poutine for take out. Got my food at 10:40 PM.  But whyyyyyyy? I don't know..."}
{"text":"Ordered Half a rack or ribs and 2 lbs of wings for 2 people. Big mistake. Too much food, but that's on us. For the wings we had honey garlic + hot, and garlic parm + hot with a side of house salad with blue cheese dressing. salad was alright. the blue cheese wasn't overwhelming and was actually pretty good tasting. the wings were not hot at all, i could see the hot sauce on the wings, but definitely could not taste it. tasted like regular honey garlic and garlic parm to me. ribs were pretty good. nice and tender, but obviously doesn't compare to a bbq or smoke house.  The meal wasn't bad at all, i enjoyed it. my biggest problems were with the service. servers don't really come to you unless you ask for them. never came to fill water once. even when we asked for a box to pack up the food, it didn't click that maybe now that our food is packed in a box, we might want the bill as well. so it's mostly a service thing here."}
{"text":"I ate at the Wild Wings in Pickering a few weeks ago and it was an all around great experience! This location is a bit smaller than some of the other Wild Wing locations i've been to, but the food and service was outstanding. I ordered Gar Par Fries and Brown Eyed Girl Wings and both tasted fantastic! The wings came out super hot and I mentioned to the waitress that there is never enough gar par sauce put on the fries, and she made sure they gave me extra. 

All of the employees were very friendly and seemed like they enjoyed working there. Also, the owner sometimes works at a waitress so she can stay in touch in her customers and make sure the restaurant is keeping people happy, and staying up to standard. 

I would definitely recommend Wild Wings if you are looking to try some interesting wing flavors and I would recommend this location to receive great service!"}
{"text":"First time having Wild Wing at this location. The restaurant seems pretty steady but I can see it being really busy during sports season.

I booked a reservation for about 16 people and the waitress was really friendly. They have a section to fill 1 group of 20+ people, but definitely call to reserve that spot.

I always get the 1 pound of Daisy Duke wings (Mango Chipotle, medium hot sauce and BBQ). Wings are a bit sweet, with some tang. It's not spicy at all for me, but it might be the right amount for someone less accustomed to spice.

If you want a creamier type of wing, consider the Gar Par or Spicy Gar Par. The wife always gets that and hasn't looked past since.

Service is good here, but don't expect the food to come out fast. I've noticed the wings are slightly smaller (than the Bayview/407 location, at least) but I have no qualms with it.

Tastes good, and gets the job done. You can't go wrong coming here."}
{"text":"Ok place for some Wings and fries. 

This place is a little run down and needs an update. 
The Washrooms need a real update!!!

Other then aesthetics the food does taste good and you have a good variety of sauces and rubs for the wings. 

If you get a chance try the Yukon Chippers with a Cajun spice, excellent. 

The chicken wings taste good and juicy, you know they are fresh! 

Service is good with Omina doing a great job looking after us! 

If your looking for parking go to the Arena right beside, lots of parking there!"}
{"text":"I like the wings here, though I've noticed that they've gotten a bit smaller than before.  Imagine a place that give you a base chicken wing, and then add a selection of over 100 different sauces, and that's Wild Wing on 17th, the first of this franchise to come to Calgary.  
Working just a block away from there, I occasionally pick up some wings there every other week, especially this one sauce that's part caesar salad, part chicken wing.  Daily specials every day.  Very basic wooden decor that leans on the Stampede style of things, but then, if all you want is wings and beer, it's all you need."}
{"text":"This is worst experience I had since coming here. The food (burger and fish&chip) were not fully cooked (cold inside still). We waited for more half hours for this result. I only found the fish was not heated because my 10 year old almost finished and left some and I tried to finish the remaining. And the waitress was arguing that we already completed. So disappointing. Anyone who want to try the worst food and service for experience, please go there. Two more things , one order item was not captured and we ended up cancelling this item, the waitress said she forgot. When the waitress came back with the bill she brought another table's bill. My wife was careful enough found out, otherwise I would have paid additional 20 dollars!!!"}
{"text":"So. Many. Options.

Super casual joint, good place to watch games, service was friendly but food took a little while but it makes sense, wings I got were hot dill pickle - was really good but very very salty, I wasnt a fan of their fries though. Boyfriend got hot parmigiana or something along that line, was suuper saucy and even more salty than my hot dill.

Would go back because it's convenient and fuss free :)"}
{"text":"Let me start off by first saying the food here is great. There is great selection in the appetizers with many options. I went with the Calamari as I always do when it is available. It was very good and personally some of the best American style Calamari I ever ate. The wings which were very nice, started with Dirty Nelly -  BBQ & Extra Hot. It was not spicy* at all in fact I found it a tad to sweet. It still tasted very good but not exactly the flavor I expected and what the waitress explained.I proceeded with Bubba's Backfire - BBQ & Extra Hot which honestly was not tastly at all. In fact I felt out right disgusted by the lack of variety within the sauce.
     

    At this point you may wonder why I only gave it a 3/5 or a 60%. That is due to everything except the food. The waitress I received was rude and assumed my mother did not know English although she has complete knowledge of the language and even was the person that initiated the damned order. The environment is sub-standard and I did not feel completely comfortable eating there with obnoxious people everywhere. Finally, what the hell is with that random bucket and the huge casing for the condiments. It only left me and my mother with about 75% of a small table to eat. Clearly not enough space to enjoy my self.  

So organizing the pro's and con's of this place I would say

Pro's:
Food

Con's:
The Venue and everything about it."}
{"text":"Been here a few times now.

Bar staff always good. 

Wings are good but the rest of the food should be skipped.

Ordered \"nachos\" in the description \"layers of cheese\"  what we got was nacho chips with a sprinkling of cheese.
We actually sent them back!  We were told once they came back that the \"recipe\" calls for 4oz of cheese and it was now doubled.  They still had no cheese.
We were told that the manager would not do anything about this since the \"recipe\" had now been doubled for the amount of cheese.  But she could knock off 50%.

The \"cook\" had a dress shirt on so I suspect he is also the owner and only cares about his bottom line of profit.

Hoping a real sports bar opens in the area.

I don't care to support places that offer a sub par product for premium prices."}
{"text":"If you love the taste of frozen food then this is the place for you. Pretty much every single aspect of a meal here is processed."}
{"text":"For some reason I keep giving this location another chance, but I've finally decided that I'll never eat at this location again. 

The service is slow, lazy and forgets your order. 
The servers/bartender spend more time playing with their hair than they do working. And don't even wash their hands before preparing drinks - touching lemon / lime after finger brushing hair...nasty!!

They wipe the tables and chairs with filthy sour rags that do not get rinced after use. 

The coke is always flat, wings are undercooked and taste rank inside. Fries soggy and taste like the oil thru were fried in is from 1982!

It's near Seneca so I kept going back periodically...but alas I've sworn to never return."}
{"text":"This place was not too bad when it 1st opened, but it has spiraled into a dump. 

The tables are always sticky and every one of them wobbles.  How hard is it to align legs or put something under it, I mean really!!

The lighting is terrible, it's cold inside, smokers go in and out bringing in the cold wind and smoke with them. 

The servers spend more time flinging their hair back and forth and launching cleavage into the faces of the drunken regulars who seem to be sitting at the bar every time I've been there.  They barely notice you come in, and never check on you.  Constantly mess up your order. 

The big guy who made amazing wings has moved on, replaced by a long list of goofballs who cannot cook and either undercook or overcook the wings/fries. 

Owners - please clean up this dump. 



The only good thing I can say about this location is they have the best Dill Dip.... Which is why I go here as a last resort. Otherwise - I would have stopped long ago. 

Oh BTW - the new wings they switched to last year are smaller and taste funky."}
{"text":"Tonight, my brother and I decided to go to Wild Wing in Heartland Town Center in Mississauga. At first glance we noticed that the place was dead on a Saturday night and that is usually not a good sign. I've been to Wild Wing before, food is decent and they're usually fairly busy. 
Our server greeted us when we sat down and took down our drink order. She seemed new judging from her lack of knowledge of the items on the menu. Our mozzarella sticks appetizer got to the table before our drinks. I kindly reminded her that we didn't get our drinks yet, so she rushed to the bar came back with one drink and then went back to pick up my brother's drink. I didn't understand why the service was so slow if we were the only customers there.
Secondly,  we decided to order two pounds of wings with 2 sauces on the side. I asked how much an extra sauce would cost she said she'll ask and come back. This information is significant and should be taught in training, since I'm sure it's a commonly asked question. Minutes later, as we watched her go up to the screen looking confused -she came back and said she'll give it to us for free..
When she finally arrived with out wings, our server decided to drop off cutlery roll-ups, which we definitely did not need considering all we ordered was wings. I also couldn't help but notice that the wing sauces aren't mixed properly. The sauces didn't look or taste very appetizing. The wings were a decent size and properly cooked so we ate them anyway since we were starving. 
After we finished our wings, I automatically cleared all the paper towels into the bucket and dumped the bones from the baskets. As I glanced into the basket where the wings were placed on a sheet, it looked like the baskets have never been washed. There was a sticky residue in the bottom of the basket under the sheet, which my guess is sauces accumulated over the years. 
I rated this place 2 stars out of 5 because I wasn't satisfied and would probably never go to that location again for food. Any other Wild Wing location isn't as bad, they're usually a fun place to get together with friends over beer and wings."}
{"text":"Loved it! Didn't think I would. The salt n vinegar wings were awesome. I also recommend the smokey blues."}
{"text":"Service is great and the wings are excellent, best I've ever had. My favourite place to go to when UFC is on"}
{"text":"\"Okay\" Service - Decent Food

Upon arriving at the restaurant we were promptly greeted and the hostess/waitress did her best to seat our party of 7.  

-  We waited about 10 minutes before our waitress came to take our drink orders.  By this time we had already figured out what we wanted to eat.

-  Some of the food was so-so.

-  The wings were good - not bad at all.

-  The service was not that great - we were constantly looking for the waitress to get refills and even get the check.  

If you want a quick bite - this is a good place - don't go in expecting much."}
{"text":"just got some take out ordered their four pack of wings four different sauces and some celery and carrot sticks 

DISAPPOINTED had to get home to find out two of the packs were sauced and in truth were very good. however two of the packs had NO SAUCE whatsoever and one of them was clearly burnt . to add insult to injury 4 pounds of wings comes with six celery sticks and 8 carrot sticks with four small blue cheese dips . 

Are your Fking kidding me for $50 I expect a lot more 

The one star was because the two that were sauced were OK"}
{"text":"I find the wings here pretty consistent with other Wild Wing locations. The only difference is the size of the wings, these are medium sized. The appetizers are alright, they can't really screw up frozen foods. The portion for fries though are significantly smaller here, as in half a basket thats been shaken and spread to look like there's more but it's not fooling anybody."}
{"text":"I like Wild Wings.. *Sweet Escape* & Sweet potato fries, is the way to go! Now.. this location.. I'm sorry, the food is okay, at best. Other locations haven't disappointed me, but this one in particular is just not up to par. Same waitress as last time (3rd time coming to this location) She actually remembered my face.. We had a couple of shots last time on the house, can't remember why but I was all in. Besides that, I highly recommend a different location if your craving for your fix, lol. Service isn't all that either but it's a small town. Meh."}
{"text":"This is the second favorite Wild Wings location.. I have to get my Sweet Escape fix once in awhile, so I come here just for the Sweet Escape Wings! I never ever get any other kind, I stay loyal to the best! The wings were very crunchy and tasty and flavorful and FRESH. Some wild wings location, the wings aren't fresh and I told the waitress that it's very fresh and she said \"We changed the oil\".. I would hope so.. but I was expecting her to say (We got the wings the same day) lololol.. I'm serious. Anyway, as a franchise, I like this place and I love wings. I recommend this location!"}
{"text":"Brutal. Ordered  buffalo chicken crunch. Recieved a chicken club 45 minutes later.  Wow.m 0-2 at wild wings.  Went to the Wheat Sheaf to get some wings. Best decision I made."}
{"text":"Wild Wings is quite decent if you want to watch a game and have a drink with your friends.

Great neighbourhood pub. One might not find anything fancy with the beer selections or the food. 

My experience here was A-OK. We just have drinks here and our waitress even ask if my friend wanted a refill.

The 3 TVs in the bar area was great and even sound was turned on so I could listen to all the commentaries."}
{"text":"We ate the hottest wings in the Wild Wing's menu and survived.... 

We started with 

Dusty Muckaroo - Honey Garlic and Extra Hot (5*) A tad too sweet not spicy

Then

Bubba's Backfire - BBQ and Extra Hot (5*) Too sour taste too one dimension

Then

Sweatin Bullets - Smokin BBQ and She is a Hottie (6*) Spicy enough and love that smokey flavour

I preferred them non breaded as we were given that option. As I found the breading a little too thick to my liking! The chicken wings though were quite juicy and tender...

It was a great night as Pint and Wings are going for $12.99.. washing the spicy wings down with some cool refreshing beer.... and watching a NFL game....

The bartender/server was nice and friendly and was smiling when she saw my Red Eyed Yelp Friend sweating his brains out from the spiciness!

Beer on Draft and Bottles are minimum, surcharges for Premium (30 cents) and Import (50  cents) which we happy to pay!"}
{"text":"This location is excellent if you're looking for some wings! It's not easy being consistent every single time with great food, but this location always has my food super fresh and tasty. The waitresses are very friendly and accommodating as well!"}
{"text":"Amazing food but pretty bad service! I keep going back because I cannot get enough of their all dressed Yukon chippers and their honey garlic boneless wings but every time I go I swear they only have one waitress for the whole place. She is really nice but it takes a while to get waited on."}
{"text":"Food was good.  Bartender was watching a depressing episode of Intervention Canada.  Not great lunch time viewing...

Wings were very good, had the medium sauce. The Jalape√±o poppers were excellent.

Basic quick food.  Nothing special"}
{"text":"I personally don't mind the long menu for wing flavor. The presentation on the wet wings are not bad but the presentation on the dry wings are absolutely horrid! The GOOD dry wings are flavored before the actual breading process but nooooooo this place just serve dry wings and literally put powder over it. I saw the powder spilling everywhere on the wing basket and ended up having a normal breaded wing. 
The vegetables that came with it were dry as well, it might have been sitting in the kitchen for few days as it was not appealing nor tasted great. 

The server (mid-50s indian dude) looked like he hates himself and doing the job because he's forced to do so. He had no smile, no enthusiasm whatsoever and if he was forceful enough, he almost dropped the wing basket on our table when he was serving them (don't worry he didn't but he looked like he almost did)

This store needs a new owner, new kitchen staff and servers. Empty-ass store when we went in, now I understand why."}
{"text":"i used to come here as a last resort after all stars.. but its grown on me.. and allstars has gone downhill.

staff is great at this location. they're genuine. i think it was the owner, not sure, but he saw that we were overlooked and were waiting to be helped.. so he comped us some fries.. it was really nice of him."}
{"text":"We live close by and at one point I preferred wings at Wild Wing to All-Stars. No way in hell can I say the same today. The wings tasted different. The Cadillac Ranch I used to order didn't taste right. I don't care that they added a side of fries to every wings order... because the fries are soggy and undercooked here. The service... I don't know what to say. While the waitresses probably had good intentions, they were flat out annoying. 

What upset us the most was the lack of cleanliness. Let me illustrate. We walked in and waited to be seated. The seats we were offered were at the very back behind a party (where you can't see TVs) and at the front beside the entrance (where it gets cold). There were 4-5 unmanned tables that needed to be cleaned. We weren't offered these tables. What bothered us more was the fact that after we were done our wings, those same tables were still never cleaned! Furthermore, every table wasn't cleaned. We were literally in the middle of dirty tables (picture attached). I have always questioned this location because the sticky tables, but I have never seen anything like this. My friend and I agreed we will avoid this restaurant like the plague, even though it's literally 2 minutes away from our house."}
{"text":"I gave this place a second try & so glad I did.  My first attempt was Victoria Day and when we arrived there was only 1 staff on, we were never greeted at the door and eventually walked out, tables needed to be cleared, tables needed to have their order taken and it was very busy. I felt bad for her whoever she was. But 2nd chance was great.  Their wings come 3 styles & I had traditional and they were just how I liked them. Except they were only warm not hot.  There are like 100 sauces and something like 30 different ways to dress their French fries.  The beer was really nice & cold. Note to manager, I used to be a restaurant manager myself & I always taught my staff the best way to judge a restaurant is check out it's restrooms first. Yours was frightening & smelled awful.  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Food was good, service was excellent and TVs big snd set on the right games. Definately go back."}
{"text":"Being so focused on the task at hand I didn't notice that the giant glowing plastic coconut tree at the entrance was gone and that Wild Wings was no more. In its place was Let's Wing It; a decidedly less kitschy and less wing-focused joint. The wing options have dropped to sixty-nine flavours (from over one-hundred) and the menu is not ashamed to emphasize their non-wing selections.

That said, the wings are still huge, saucy and tasty. But the coconut tree, the crowds, and that amazing beer bucket for your bones -- all gone. Not too sure about this change, but I'll give it some time.

Obligatory Title Pun: WING and a miss.

Menu Readability: Many the worst designed menu I've ever seen in a restaurant. Yes, that really does say \"bineapple.\"

Need to mention: The website doesn't actually take you anywhere.

What this place teaches me about myself: Soixante-neuf still makes me chuckle."}
{"text":"Two stars ONLY because we were able to get seats right away during the raptors game, and the food was really good. 

I got sweet escape wings, which came with fries and veges (carrots + celery), it was really good! The fries were amazing, it was crispy and I believe they put seasoning on it which made it taste good. 

Okay, now for the service. Our waitress was kind, however the service sucked!! Upon arrival, we noticed many tables still needed to be cleaned. The waitress noticed us but didn't say a word or approach us until we found a seat. The table was so sticky we had to ask her if it could be cleaned. She hardly checked on us, and we had to ask for water/refills. 

Loved the food, but wouldn't come back to this location."}
{"text":"Never again.. I think this was by far the worst Wild Wing I've been to. The service, food and restaurant itself was so bad.

Our waitress was so clueless the entire time we were there. Whenever we asked her for something, she'd forget, then we would have to remind her. She would literally come back like 15-20 minutes later. When I said the restaurant was bad itself, the tables were SO sticky and an alarm went on for the last 30 minutes we were there, kept going on and off. We left because we couldn't stand it.

I got spicy gar-par boneless wings w/ regular fries, which also came with carrots. The boneless wings were OKAY, not the best. The fries were so soggy and gross. I hated the food.

Def. will not be back."}
{"text":"My first time at this location . The food was delicious as always , however the place was cold!! It was about an hour into closing so I don't know if the hearing was turned down. I didn't enjoy eating with my jacket on and neither did my two guests. We weren't offered a re fill even though the hostess could see the glasses emptied ! Apart from all this , I would consider going again ."}
{"text":"UPDATE! WING HUB: The ownership stayed the same but the new suppliers they decided to use made a real difference in their Wings.Before you would be paying for the \"Wild Wings\" name and that meant too many flavours, not enough quality. Not only are the Wings actually now a lot better but they are much more reasonably priced. The environment works. It is simply just a great little spot to grab a drink and watch the game. I did however experience a little bit of a wait even though they were not that bus but with that said I would still give this place another shot. 

Enjoy fellow Yelpers!"}
{"text":"The service was horrible period. When our order was messed up me and my girlfriend asked to speak to a manager and the waiter kept beating around the bush that the manager is busy and that they can't disclose his personal number and so on and so forth $70 dollars and two hours of telephone tag later we got the wrong meal and no manager was contacted to let him/her know of the poor service we received at this wild wing location."}
{"text":"What to try:

Def come on a Tuesday for wings because it's for 1/2 the price! Wings come either breaded or unbreaded. With fries AND some celery carrot sticks. The dipping sauce also comes with the wings. Only thing is...580 calories my friends vs let's say honey garlic at 190 calories. It's a big difference but hey. Worth a try once right?

Last tips: 1/2 price wings come with a caveat. You have to order a drink so unless you're a fan of alcohol...order a soft drink then!"}
{"text":"This place used to be good, but not anymore. The quality went down food and environment. Rings don't taste as good as they used to I don't know what they changed maybe it's me who knows."}
{"text":"ABSOLUTE GARBAGE!!!  This was our second visit and definitely our LAST!  We gave it a second chance as the first time was kind of 50/50. There was nothing tasty about this location.  It used to be another bar and was newly renovated to be a Wild Wings.  They already need to overhaul the staff.  The cook could be lost or overworked, who knows???  Friday night should have more than one waitress working, especially during a baseball game.  I manage a restaurant as well and know sometimes, things do get out of control.  

I went there with some co-workers after our shifts, entering the restaurant at around 9:30pm.  The restaurant had a few tables mostly with families and some teenagers hogging up a table in the back.  I felt bad for the server as she was obviously over-worked.  However, she should of been honest with customers and let them know that she was the only server and it would be a while for food and drinks.  The chicken wings were bland and did not even come close to what their ingredients were described in the menu.  Don't get me wrong, I am a big fan of chicken wings but this place is not going to last in Richmond Hill.  I hope the franchise owner at least tries to fix these issues."}
{"text":"The service was good, and while the chicken wings were juicy, the sauce flavours we chose fell flat!  They have many (x4) flavour options, perhaps we chose the wrong ones."}
{"text":"Serious question: Does anyone *actually* work here?

We went here last night for dinner at around 7 and had a party of 5 people. We were seated within a couple of minutes and I was relatively impressed by the size of this place - by far the largest Wild Wings I've seen to date, styled in the typical Wild Wings trimmings - dimly lit, painted cactuses, license plates, sports tchotchkes, shiplap, and a whole lot of wood everywhere else. 

After being seated, we waited 10-15 minutes for beverage orders. This probably should have been the dead giveaway that we were in for a long visit, but hey, it looked like there were only two people manning the floor and the place was busy so that was to be somewhat expected. 

15 minutes later, the drinks arrived and we put in our order. We ordered our mains and our appetizer simultaneously. The appetizer arrived approximately 20 minutes later and the waitress was gone before we could ask her for cutlery. As she didn't come back within a couple of minutes to do a quality assurance check, I got up and sought her out and asked for cutlery. 

Cutlery arrived, pickles were piping hot and good - dill dipping sauce was alright, a little too sweet, and not a whole lot of dill, but good. 

When the mains arrived a few minutes later, my partner noticed that the wings that he was served were not the correct flavour. I assured him not to worry, the waitress would be back momentarily and it would be rectified.

Except she wasn't back. In fact no matter how often I attempted to make eye contact with her, she averted her gaze. I watched her stop at eery table but ours, and watched her converse with a table of patrons for 15 minutes, pick up their babbling, albeit adorable toddler and do everything but her job. My partner's brother needed to go the bathroom and decided he would flag her down on his way to the bathroom - but nope, she was fast with the dodge and evade routine. We shrugged empathetically at me and mouthed an apology across the room. 

To avoid having to get up, *again*, I resorted back to primary school and raised my hand and stared at her. She finally got the the hint and came over - my partner explained that wasn't what he ordered and asked for buffalo sauce and I asked for whatever their hottest sauce was as the xtra hot was all vinegar based and not hot at all.

She was back quickly and the hot sauce she brought over was like a kick to the back of the throat and fantastic. (Which is quite literally the only reason why this is a 2 star experience and not a 1.)

When everyone was finished their meal, we then had to wait another 25 minutes in hopes that she would come back and ask us if we needed anything else. My future MIL was itching for some cheesecake and my partner and his brothers were ready to get this nightmare of a wing ordeal over with. 

To put us all out of our misery, I got up once again since I apparently love exercising when I'm dining out and wandered over to where she was...and again, we played the evasion game until another waitress came back and asked if I had been taken care of - the answer is no. 

I put in our cheesecake order with the other waitress, asked for the bill and a takeaway container.

Suddenly when it was time for payment, our waitress was available, and armed and ready with the debit machine going as far as to linger around for us to pay our bill and beat it.¬†¬†

You have got to be kidding me. This is the most atrocious display of acumen I've ever seen in my life. This location could afford some seasoned staff members, or one's who clearly have a keener sense on how to manage their tables better. Patrons should not be left waiting, or better yet, having to get up and ASK for service, repeatedly."}
{"text":"In the words of today's teenager: 'I can't even.' 

After a fail attempt at getting a table at Marcello's, my boyfriend's sister suggested Wild Wing as an alternative given it was within the same plaza. With a communal indifference to the dinner option after our blunder, we agreed. The warning sign should have been how empty the restaurant was with a single patron sitting at the back of the restaurant working vigilantly on her computer and nursing a beer.  The lone waitress didn't greet us, didn't nod an acknowledgment and didn't seem to give a rat's that we were there. Despite this, after deciding on a table, we sat ourselves down and patiently waited for the lone ranger to wander over. 10 minutes later, she strolled over and handed us three menus with a half assed greeting. 

Now, it's a no brainer: you come to a chicken wing place, you get something chicken related. However, I'm weird about touching my food and without fail, will always vote for the boneless option. So, you can imagine the gut sinking feeling when the waitress reappeared 15 minutes later and she advised they were out of the boneless option. 
(Why it would take 15 minutes to flip through the three page menu, [one of which consists of wing flavours to decide] in order for you to draw the conclusion that A: You want chicken. B: You want it in some variety, or C: You like to play on the wild side (see what I did there?) and stray away from the traditional by getting a burger.) (You daredevil, you.)  

Fine: I will meet your lack of boneless option and go with the chicken fingers. 

I should have taken the no boneless option as my third warning to run while I still I had a chance. 

Upon the waitresses arrival, we were greeted by plastic plates (why on earth any establishment would be serving their meals on plastic plates purchased at their local Dollarama is absolutely BEYOND ME) and quite possibly the soggiest, stalest tasting nachos. The salsa tasted rancid, and the lettuce was wilted. Upon the arrival of my entree I encountered what appeared to look like it had come straight out of a Hungry Man frozen dinner... the chicken fingers smelled off... like they'd been sitting in the back of the fridge. I was feeling ballsy, so I took a bite... I wasn't convinced. My boyfriend's GarPar chicken wings followed suit, and they were bland tasting.

20 minutes later when our waitress arrived to do a very delayed quality control check, she asked how everything was tasting. I explained to her the lack lustre experience I was having with my meal, she stared at me blankly as she asked me several times to describe how they tasted...they tasted freezer burned...they tasted off...how many other ways did I need to find in order to describe this? \"Do you want another meal made?\" No, I want to get out of here as quickly as possible...instead I asked for some more sour cream...I should have anticipated that upon her return, the sour cream would be extremely watery and very off in texture. An elderly couple helplessly attempted to flag down our waitress whom she ignored several times before the poor woman with an evident bad hip hobbled over to her requesting her attention. Given the destitute of people within the restaurant, it was easy enough to hear the woman explain that her chicken...well...it didn't taste like chicken. The waitress feigned surprise before asking: \"Does it taste like freezer burn?\" \"Yes!\"

FACE PALM. 

When my boyfriend went up to settle the bill, he was started to find my meal on the bill. Upon asking if she could do something with it given my circumstances, she sighed heavily and said she'd have to consult with the kitchen staff. She returned two minutes later and said: \"I can give you 15% off.\" My boyfriend now agitated by this response rebuttled that I hadn't even consumed even half of my meal.\" \"Well, she ate the fries, right? I'll just charge her for those.\" $4.99 on cardboard French fries later... and we were racing for the door with a mutual agreement to never return again. 

Wild Wing, there is a reason why a number of your establishments are closing, it's only a matter of time before you, your crappy chicken and plastic china at this location follow."}
{"text":"Biggest selection of wings I ever seen. Came here for SuperBowl 48 and 50. The service was great, and the food was a delight each time, but there is not atmosphere. I would suggest to grab the wings for take out."}
{"text":"The owners are always there and fully intoxicated everytime and speak like children from a rap scene. Horrible service. Didn't even bother disputing my order the second time."}
{"text":"Terrible experience. Wings were definitely frozen. Sauce was subpar as was the service."}
{"text":"Oakville's been expecting two Wild Wing locations to open for about the past year. This one seems to be the first of those out of the gate, and it isn't a bad start.

For such a big franchise chain, I'm kind of surprised that this is my first time visiting Wild Wing. The sheer variety of wing choices certainly took me by surprise - sweet to savoury to spicy and all points in between. We went with the 20 wing sampler - Desperado, Gar-Par, Garlic Garlic and some sort of barbecue sauce version. That combo came to about $25.

Fair warning first off: if you're an aficionado of the traditional Buffalo-style wing, you may be disappointed here - I found they tended more towards the saucy type than the traditional style that sarah l. introduced me to on the Great International Chicken Wing Crawl of 2009. Still, all varieties were quite tasty, my favourites being the Garlic Garlic and the Desperado.

That brings me to wing size: definitely on the small side, which made the $25 we paid for 20 wings feel like not such a great deal.

Aside from that, service was pleasant and cheerful, but well on the slow side, especially considering that the place was basically deserted when we came in. On a Friday night. Methinks they've not quite gotten the word out that they are, in fact, finally open.

Overall, I'm happy to have gone and found the wings to be very tasty, but the price and speed of service have left me with a bit of a sour taste. I'll probably be back."}
{"text":"This wild wings has now closed or has been closed for a few months, the few times I've been the food was mediocre, the place was always dead and the service not so good. Also my bf and I had one beer each and we're told they had no more (literally of all the beer)which was disappointing because they should have the items on the menu. Needless to say I would not go back if it ever does open"}
{"text":"Before I became a vegetarian I had been to this location a few times and it was my favourite wing place! The list of flavours are impressive! When ordering boneless wings I normally got 6-8 wings depending on size. Came with celery, carrots and fries. You never left hungry that's for sure. Honey garlic/ Parmesan was my go to flavour!"}
{"text":"Not recommended at all! 
Food : wings has too many choices but too complex to get a simple order
Wings : too small
I asked for garlicky flavour but NOT sweet. Ugh ok. The waitress gave me honey garlic flavour. It was soooo sweet, I swear, it can pass for desert!!!
French fries are long and huge but nothing to crave for. 
Nachos is so so. It gets hard and damp after a while. Pulled pork is sweet too! 
Dessert was their best seller.  It's a muffin with chocolate syrup! It's microwaved and way half into eating it, it got as hard as a ROCK! We returned it and they asked if I want another one.  And waiter said, they really just microwave it. 
Really?!! Try oven toaster! 
You'll have to keep looking for the waitress coz of high partition wall between couch area and bar area. And she comes at times when you don't need her. Arrgghhh!!! 
Food isn't worth the price! 
Lane design for a sports bar with ugghhh the feminely, foldable colourful hanging lights! Lol! What's the theme here?!
Two stars for the billiard area, TV on each couch  seating and ample parking at the plaza."}
{"text":"very stingy with the fries. A side order of fries are $3 something. However wings were alright, service was okay. Not many seats though"}
{"text":"Our server Berlin was fantastic! We had a disagreement on the Monday night boneless wings promo, but she was able to resolve it for us."}
{"text":"Fairly large location as this used to be a pub. Lots of large   TVs covering multiple sporting events. Wings are decent but pricey.

Free wifi available."}
{"text":"One word: disgusting.

When we went in, we were the only table there; that should have been the first sign. The food was alright. I got the Swiss + Mushroom burger and it was a little dry but the fries were good. It was better than I expected but the service and sanitary aspects were piss poor. There was a dead bug in my water. I only discovered it floating in my water when I was almost done. Lesson learned: look at your water before beginning to drink it. I pointed it out and they replaced the water but didn't offer any compensation for making me drink marinated bug water. A coupon or something would have been nice. The service was also poor. The waitress was sick and sniffing the entire time. She left the cash machine at our table and got upset when I put in the purchase myself. I understand that it is policy, but you should not have left it there unattended with no explanation. She also never gave back the change to my brother who paid in cash.

I would leave 0 stars if possible. I will never go to another Wild Wing again. If I can't even trust the cleanliness of the water, how can I trust eating their food? 

I probably sound like a brat right now but I am really upset and annoyed."}
{"text":"Finally the boys got some time to meet up and catch up. With work and everyone doing their own thang, it's been tough to organize any kind of get together. And of course, being.... ahh, 'men' we decided to do the wing and beer thing at a pub. We went for Let's Wing It... a pretty good slogan for the night.

We got there and there are a ton of flavours. So if you have gotten use to crazy selection at All Stars or wing diners like that, you should be comfortable here (69 flavours, no joke intended). The decor is clean and representative of your typical pub but most importantly, it comes prepared with paper towels and wet naps which trust me, you'll need.

I got an order of 30 Honey Garlic and Caesar parmesan wings and my friends got flavours such as Caesar - extra hot and parmesan and Pineapple Curry Caribbean Jerk. We got our pitcher of beer and before we knew it, our wings came in about 10 mins. For sports fans, there are a ton of flat screen TVs so you won't miss a beat. And the people there are very nice to change the channel if you prefer to watch a different sporting event than the one showing by your table.

The wings here are heavily battered, so if you're the type that doesn't prefer this then you might wanna try their ribs. They're nice and tender and make sure you ask for extra sauce on the side for them. For my wings, I liked the flavour. If you're not a big eater, 30 will be way too much as I was struggling to finish myself. I would say 10-15 would be the average for most people. I can't really comment on my friend's flavour, but I definitely liked mine. It can be a little saucy for most people, so beware if you're planning to order this. But if you like Caesar salad and honey garlic wings, then this might be the right choice for you.

Overall, I like Let's Wing It. And judging from the empty bowls of chicken wings, my friend's enjoyed it as well. It's a nice little place and with a modern TV system, you won't miss your game. And HD is available for most of your sporting needs. However, this place is pricey. It comes to just under a dollar for a wing. Which if you're like me, you'll be paying for $30 just for wings before any drinks, tax and tip. So would I recommend frequent visits, probably not. A little too expensive for me. But a nice place to go to for those playoff games and Olympics moments."}
{"text":"This is a new addition to the Wild Wing franchise, located where the Original Motorcycle Cafe used to be on Queen St.It's a lot brighter than OMC and a lot more televisions. Seating is about the same, with the exception of the wall where there jukebox used to be. I guess now it's a proper \"restaurant\" as opposed to just a bar with food. 

 I'll get down to business regarding their food: ordered the classic \"Medium\" and their \"Buckin' Bronco\" (medium sauce +lemon pepper). Extremely SOUR. Whoever made the sauce was a little vinegar happy the night I went. I mentioned it to the waitress who said she can take it back to the kitchen and add something to it...I don't think that would have done anything to it so I said forget it and washed away the taste with the tasty sweet potato fries. My friends ordered \"Margaritaville\" (BBQ + Jerk sauces) and \"I am Canadian\" (mild sauce + maple). The I am Canadian was a bit off, which I'm guessing because the person again messed up on the measurement of the vinegar... Margaritaville was the hit out of the four flavours we tried. Their fries and gravy was pretty good, nice beef-stocky gravy and crispy fries. 

I find their prices a little too high though so probably best to check out their specials and come in on that day (by the looks of it Tuesday seemed to be the best which was 
1 1/2 lbs of wings for the price of 1lb, which I think was $9.99)

I'd give it one more try before I make up my mind whether this place is a no-go or not."}
{"text":"Was really looking foward to Tuesday half price wings night after watching a movie.  We wandered into Wild Wings around 10pm and thought we had enough time to eat our wings wthin an hour as the restaurant was closing at 11pm.  The associate eventually sat us down and told us that half price wings promotion ended at 10pm.  So we walked out in search of the next half price wings promo restaurant."}
{"text":"Very bad service, under new management.. ordered wings and fries....the server forgot the order so she just brought wings and no fries... Again she forgot the beer , then she went back and never came ... Wings were stale and tasted funny...when requested to change the channel for the TV close to us she refused not to mention that there was no other customers around..and when paying for the food ..she added the amount for fries which were never served and wouldn't take off the bill.... Call the manager ..even he supported the server .... Crazy place...will never go back"}
{"text":"Terrible. Doesn't even feel like a sport bar or like the other wild wings. Also wings were over cooked. There was a reason why it was empty when we went."}
{"text":"We ordered one order of regular wings, and one of boneless, as well as a nachos and cheese, were soooo good.... we were digging for cheese, and barely found any.  The potato skins were so-so."}
{"text":"They defiantly stepped up their game. Even when slammed and short staffed they were open with their customers and kept everyone informed. The waitress was very kind even when under a lot of stress. The food and drinks came out in a very reasonable time! 
I would definitely come back :) 
My only negative comment is that I wish wild wings would stop increasing their prices so often! This is not the restaurants fault, it's a franchise thing, but it's getting quite up there!"}
{"text":"Today me and my friend decided to try out a new chicken wing place that we haven't been to before. The first thing that popped into my mind when I stepped in was...what a cheesy place due to the design and atmosphere.

The menu for the wings is VERY extensive. There's at least 30 different flavours you can choose from so it might take you a while to decide. My friend ordered the ribs and I got the single order of honey garlic wings. The food comes out pretty quick and it's actually hot inside and outside compared to other chicken wing joints. The skin on the chicken was crispy and the meat was soft and hot on the inside. I was very pleased with my order and my friend really enjoyed her ribs. The prices are quite high for the wings...9 pieces costs $9.99 (basically $1/piece).

The service wasn't the greatest because the majority of the times the server were all huddle together by the counter. They would come around once in a while to check up when we didn't need anything. However, when we needed something it took a while to flag a server down.

The wings were great so I would definitely go here again just for the wings. If the wings were bad and the services was terrible I wouldn't bother coming back. I'll let the poor service slide just for the yummy wings."}
{"text":"$19 for baby wings. so not worth the money. bet the owner is cheap. gp somewhere else."}
{"text":"Worst service, didnt even bother to ask if we wanted our wings breaded or what kind of sauce we wanted. Super rude waitress with RBFS.. not recommended."}
{"text":"Horrible Experience

Went to Wildwings for takeout at about 6pm.  Place was dead.  Like, not a soul in there.  We put in a order and asked them how long.  about 15-20mins.  Cool, sounds good.  Paid for the goods.  
My wife waits inside.  I'm jamming with my kids to the Moana soundtrack in the car.  30mins roll around.  My wife still didn't come out.  One of my kids wants to go inside, so no problem, I bring her inside with my wife.  I'm back in the car with my other kid.  Wife checks with the waitress to see how's the order's going . 
The order didn't go through.  Apparently, the girl who initially took the order left for the day and didn't tell anyone about the order.  No one's fault right?  But wait, no one bothered asking the single customer in the whole damn restaurant what the hell's she doing there for 30mins while the kitchen is not active?  What?  She there to watch the game?  Wtf.  

Whatever, the waitress says it'll take another 15mins.

15mins later, I'm tired of listening to the damn Moana soundtrack.  Time to go inside.  Now, there's a party seated and a few other people waiting for orders.  Some wings come out.  Sweet!  That must be ours right?  Nope!  They goto the party before us.  Da fffukk???  How the hell do they get priority here???  Put the sauce we ordered and let us go!

Another 10mins goes by, finally we get our wings.  Total of 55mins.  Seriously... These guys have a horrible system, and they made next to zero effort to make things right.  We got a total of 2 \"sorry\"s.  One in passing when the waitress was walking by.  And another when she handed us the food with the pay machine, when we already paid!  No offer of water.  No offer for a discount, or some free food.  

The wings were alright, but damn it wasn't enough to get through the bitterness of the experience."}
{"text":"crap service...subpar food, all of the tv's were set on boxing...? bathroom looked like it hadn't been cleaned in a bit 
Not impressed"}
{"text":"Better than St. Louis but not quite as good as Duff's or All-Stars. Liked the \"Pump Jack\" flavour. It was a tasty mix of spicy mustard and garlic parmesan. 
No free refills on iced tea = weak."}
{"text":"I love Wild Wing's food, but the service we received last night has guaranteed that we won't return. We ordered our food online through a delivery company, as they were offering a discount. Since they were pickup only, we started driving to their location. We got a call from the delivery company stating that Wild Wing had accidentally rejected our order, and though the delivery company had sent it through again, it would mean a longer wait time. We had no problem with that, and the delivery company sincerely apologized.

We waited until the time they told us the food would be ready, and then my Husband went in to retrieve our order. It still wasn't ready, and they asked him if he wanted to pay while he waited. He told them we HAD paid, and even showed them the e-mailed receipt with their name on it and my CC info, AND the amount coming out of our bank account. They STILL didn't believe him. They eventually called a manager over and the manager told my Husband he would take it up with the delivery company. No apology, just \"here's your food.\" By then, our food was cold. We took it home and warmed it up in the oven. When we sat down to eat, we realized part of our order was missing. They were closed by then, so we just dealt with it and agreed that that was the last time we'd dine at this Wild Wing. 

Good food is important for a restaurant. But a lot of restaurants have good food. Your customer service has to set you apart from the others. Unfortunately for Wild Wing, their customer service has set them apart in a very negative way."}
{"text":"Wasn't pleased with the service or the wing sauce. Won't be returning, kitchen closed before I was able to change my order."}
{"text":"Very Clean. I believe they just opened up. The decorations inside are nice.

Great stadium bar for showing sporting events. I was here specifically to watch the Raptors but they didn't have the Roger's Sportsnet channel. Which was a downer. I stayed anyway.

They feature a large projection screen at the back. It also features a bar, many booths with individual television screens and a pool table. I saw that they have a foosball table or as well. Other than that I saw a promo for $13.99 for a pint and pound. In addition, they have a live DJ handling the music there as well. It was empty on this particular Friday night but it just opened up.

I had the wings and a Coors Light, which I had no problem with. Very fast service as well!

I'd probably be back here.

Minus 1 star for not having my Raptors on that night."}
{"text":"Ordered through Ritual, paid extra $8 for 2 poutines only to find out there's no poutine at all in the bag, only 10 pieces of fries with my less than average wings. So annoyed right now. Service was also bad even though it was a quick takeout."}
{"text":"Went on a Thursday night. Wings joint only has one waitress for the whole lot. She did a decent job but definitely needed more help. Wild Wings recently had a revamp in menus and loaded up on better options and a nicer looking menu. Don't be fooled as the wings quality didn't improve. Wings seemed to be over fried and over sauced. Doesn't even satisfy your craving for wings either."}
{"text":"Wings - Extra hot just isn't hot at all.  Seriously need to re-index.  At least they were meaty...

Beer selection - BORING

Bathrooms - stalls are so dark even during mid-day you cant see anything.  Hate that.  

We did get to watch NFL countdown and service was OK, but business was slow, so not sure what busy would look like.  

Not going back.  If you are in the area, go to Gabby's"}
