{"text":"The best Chinese/Japanese buffet I have been to, as a vegetarian (though, of course, there are plenty of seafood and meat options).  They had three different veg soups, including a delicious hot & sour soup.  Spinach pies that were not the usual soggy chinese restaurant affairs, but firm and tasty, as well as cheese pies.  Very nice mixed veg in brown sauce rather than the steamed tasteless stuff other places offer; mushrooms, potatoes, French fries, noodles of course; sushi and hibachi made to order.  Lots of other dishes, but what stands out is the high quality of the food.  The service was also excellent.  Just wish this place was closer to home!"}
{"text":"I've been here about 10 times now and every time, I left satisfied! Every time I've been, the entire staff had smiles on their faces and promptly serviced us. Drinks are constantly refilled without asking as well.

I don't agree with other reviewers about the sushi selection. Most buffets you go to, you simply don't want to eat the sushi because it's either been left out all day, or the selection has almost no real sushi (I don't count cream cheese in rice as sushi!). However, this buffet has a huge selection of sushi. There are some cream cheese sushi, but also some real sushi as well, including sashimi (raw fish with no rice) and non-cream cheese filled sushi. Some of which have raw fish inside and out! They don't skimp on the sushi at this place. It may not be for the die-hard sushi fans, but it definitely have much better sushi then you would find at your average buffet.

The overall cuisine of the buffet is American and Chinese. It does have a bit more american food then most chinese buffets, so even non-chinese buffet lovers would be more satisfied. I would suggest going after 4pm since they have a slightly better variety such as frog legs and crab legs.

The lay out of the buffet is 9 main buffet tables with a long tablet that houses the sushi on one side and hibachi on the other. 2 of the tables are dessert. One of these dessert tables has a chocolate fountain! There's also a separate ice cream bin. 1 table has cold food which consist mostly of salad stuff, but also has raw oysters and cold cooked shrimp. The other 6 tables are the main buffet and consist of seafood, american, rice, soups, and so on.

Dinner price is slightly under $30 for two adults, including drinks and tax. I believe it was about 22ish for lunch for the same.

Overall, I definitely recommend it and will be going plenty of more times!"}
{"text":"Osaka...  Oh sucked...  food was cold and like it was taken from the refrigerator.  I really tried to like something.  Not successful.  Not worth the money and poor imitation of chinese food..."}
{"text":"I've been here twice it was recommended to me by a friend. The first time I went it was a little after 1 pm. The restaurant had  a small crowd. 
 
Once I sat down to eat my first plate I noticed that some of the food was extremely cold (nobody likes cold rice) and the sushi was ice cold. However, I did enjoy the food that was the correct temperature. I enjoyed it so much I even went back a second time to the restaurant a couple of weeks later. 

This time I was there when it opens at 11 am. I have to say the food was a little warmer.There isn't a larger variety of food, it's a newer buffet so maybe they will have a larger variety in the future. They do except competitors so if I receive a coupon in the mail for a buffet I may return."}
{"text":"Came here high af and had the munchies from 9th circle of hell. Spent 9$before 4 pm and ate until my stomach broke 3 buttons and my belt snapped. 
they have 8 rows of buffet tables, a sushi/ hibachi private grill and ice cream. Desserts, crab legs and all the other Chinese goodness you could expect from a Chinese Buffett. Defiantly worth going and I 1000% recommend it."}
{"text":"It was..okay.  It wasn't great but it wasn't terrible.  The food was nicely seasoned, but some of it was kinda cold.  It was mostly empty for 7:30 on a Friday night.  Even then, the waitress only came to refill our drinks once."}
{"text":"hubby and i ate here for a date night....the raw meat was brown  , both of us had gotten really sick from the sushi! we both walked out and didn't pay for shit! 

yay! they shut down!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I'd give it a half star if I could. This place is pathetic, food looks old and unappetizing, not to mention your paying $13.00 per person for old food. The food is very unappealing and looks all the same(brown gelatiness meats, old limp veggies and seafood that I wouldn't feed my pet). The Chinese place at the food court in the mall is way better, so if you don't like the food court Chinese food then this place would be joke.
I'm actually sitting in the resteraunt now and discusted with this place and had to write this review to at least warn others. It dosnt make sense as this place is surrounded by great places to eat, this is a prime location and yet they serve crap. Their only saving grace is prepackaged Hershey ice cream and the made to order hibachi.

If you really want the best Chinese buffett and can make the drive to rock hill SC , there is this place called \"AMBER\". I've been from New York to Los Angeles and I've never found a Chinese Buffett like \"Amber\". Food is absolutely wonderful and fresh.

Anyway, 
Just wanted to give you all a heads up on this place and a real honest review.
Before I came here, I read reviews on this place and thought I'd give it a chance, but the reviews must be fake and staged. 

Take care and
Good eats to all !!!!"}
{"text":"Great variety!   The place is new and ultra clean.  Do to the close proximity of the mall, during busy time, the food turns over quickly, thus you always get fresh stuff.  The bad, almost depressing, flip side of the mall - the sushi chef is \"slow as molasses\"......   He only makes one or two rolls ever 15 minutes.   So I end of hovering around him until he makes what I want and I go away."}
{"text":"I admit to having a weakness for buffets.  Not just for the sake of gluttony, but more so for the variety.  I think I've been to Osaka 8 - 10 times since they've opened.  They are somewhat higher priced than the typical Asian buffet, but not outrageously so.

First off, I don't understand other review complaints about cold food.  I've never had an issue with that.  With any well maintained buffet, if food sits a while, it fades, but it doesn't get cold.

I'm 60 years old and trying to do the low carb thing.  I do my best at home during the week, but want to be able to go out on the weekend without totally blowing the diet.  With that in mind...

Here's a map to the place.  Standing just inside the front door...

There are nine stations, arranged in three rows of three.  Hold your phone out in front of you, the closest row is 789, the next 456, the next 123.  Behind that is the sushi bar and hibachi grill.

Station 9 is cold items.  Peel 'n eat shrimp, raw oysters / clams, seafood salad, lettuce, tomato, cukes, etc.

Station 8 is hot seafood.  Salt & pepper shrimp, crab (not crab legs), frogs legs, crayfish, fried / braised fish, various types of shrimp.  Some of these items have cornstarch, but this is a cheat night, not a regular part of the diet.

Station 7 is vegetarian stir fries, chicken, beef stir fries.  Some of the stir fried items are heavily breaded, so beware.

Station 5 has loads of fried items - egg rolls, spring rolls, fried shrimp, fried dumplings.  Beware.

Station 4 has hibachi chicken, rice, fried rice, lo mein, soups, etc.  Beware the rice and lo mein.

Steer clear of stations 1, 2, 3, 6.

Sushi is OK, but not worth cheating the diet for.  I've never tried the hibachi grill."}
{"text":"There wasn't a review so I thought I'd leave one. Not as bad as some reviews I've read. Your standard Asian buffet. Nothing special, but also not disappointing, hence the 3 stars. Service was average. I would return but not for a while since there are others closer to me. 

My brother and I went on a Monday night and it was slow. Some of the less popular items were sitting around and very cold. The rest of the selection was good though. The Sushi was ok because half of it was filled with cream cheese and cucumber. So if you're going mainly for sushi, I'd skip this place. 

One last thing, they have a chocolate fountain so that's a little different. All in all, I felt like the food and experience was worth $12."}
