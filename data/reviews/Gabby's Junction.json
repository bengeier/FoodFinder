{"text":"If you've been to a Gabby's you kind of know what to expect.  A pretty standard Canadian Pub that serves popular beer brands, and has a pretty big menu without a real signature dish so all the food is just kind of OK.

This Gabby's has a few pluses, it's family friendly with some specials for Kids meals that help the wallet.  It also, like the other Gabby's around town, has their half price wing specials on Monday and Wednesdays.

Another plus on this location is their back patio in the summer time that is a pretty sweet little spot they have back there.

You aren't going to get anything mind-blowing from but it's not bad for families, and the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"A solid establishment. Lots of sports, drinks specials, seating, and a patio. Clean, and standard sports pub menu. Wings, burgers, wraps are good. Consistent service, decent prices.. Only sports pub in the Junction. Should be 5/5 but I'm a bit biased as I prefer a St. Louis over Gabby's."}
{"text":"PLEASE NOTE: This review is only for a delivery order from Gabby's at this location, through Just-eat. I have not been at the location and cannot speak for its atmosphere, staff or quality of service.

My girlfriend and I decided to treat ourselves last night and order some food in while we watched Survivor. We only had our debit card on us, so we decided on trying a new place from Just-eat.  We settled on Gabby's.  She had a burger and fries, I had a double order of boneless wings and fries. 

The delivery time quoted was 50 minutes, it arrived in about 40.  Driver was very polite, and is the kind of driver you'd want representing your company. The condiments for the burger were all on the side, which is good - they don't just assume you want all-dressed and put it all on.

As for the food, the burger was reported as \"good, though it's never as good delivered as it is fresh with something like a burger.  The boneless wings were good tasting, even though a couple were a little soggy from the wing sauce. Only problem was, they were TINY - barely the size of popcorn chicken. Still though, tasty as can be.

I will probably re-order from them again in the future."}
{"text":"I've been to many Gabby's in my lifetime. I've also been to this location before. Generally it is what you might expect for a chain pub: average. Not bad average; it's generally good but they serve hamburgers and nachos so what are you really expecting?

Well a group of us was there recently for weekend brunch and it was absolutely horrid. Every single dish was cold. Every single dish got sent back. This is bacon and eggs we're talking about here, this isn't gastronomy at its finest. The whole ordeal took forever and we all agreed we will not be returning.

Dundas in the Junction continues to grow and Gabby's is not the only or best option. If you're going to be an average chain restaurant, I think your quality margins are much thinner than the competition. Gabby's just can't afford to be bad because there are so many better options available.

If you're looking for pub-type food, support our local community and take your business to Axis. They have better food and better service."}
{"text":"I ordered basic chicken fingers and fries thru DoorDash and this is the first time I've ever seen chicken fingers go wrong. They fried it so much that it turned black. No only did it visually look unappetizing as in the picture the batter was rock hard, chicken dried out, no taste. I wonder if this is how it is always served or they felt it was ok to serve this since I am a DoorDash customer and couldn't complain in person.  Not sure what the other menu items are like but chicken fingers are hard to mess up like this. What a waste of time, money and my dinner."}
{"text":"Gabby's has the only consistent hours and late night kitchen in the western half of the Junction. Unlike some of the other bars in the area, they are open until 2:00 a.m. and their kitchen is open until last call.

The beer selection is your typical sports bar stuff from the big brewing companies like Moosehead, Molsons, etc.  - which is fine - as other bars in area cater to the craft beer crowd. 

The place has a great back patio that is open until 2:00 am, and has a couple of large HDTV screens with proper HD signals feeding them. 

When the patio isn't open, the place is still large and is good for groups. Lots of TVs for viewing sports on as well, with good sight lines. Though some of the large TVs inside do not have proper HD signals feeding them, it still seems to be getting good clean digital standard definition signals though.

I found the service to be attentive and the wing specials on Monday and Wednesday are good. I find the food at this location is very good for what it is essentially: American diner food.

This place accepts credit, debit and cash. So I give it a four out of five because I've had only good experiences here. Definitely recommend it for late night eating and for watching sporting events."}
{"text":"I came here for nachos thinking it's literally impossible to mess up something as simple as nachos. Boy, was I wrong. Half the cheese wasn't even melted yet and overall it was very bland. 

The server was a sweet girl, and the gluten free beers they offer are actually pretty good, so I'll give them that."}
{"text":"I prefer this place to any hipster joint down the road. The place is not too noisy, especially when compared to those next door. Service is prompt, friendly, and positive. They serve standard bar food and more (fish tacos!), but, that being said, the foot is not overpriced, and the portions are not microscopic. The seating is comfortable, and the overall vibe is pleasant and unimposing. Their selection of beers is standard, but lately they've started adding local brews to the menu. Overall, this is a great place to relax and have a conversation over a pint of beer."}
{"text":"Just don't eat here.  Wings are pretty sad, honestly they just look sad sitting in that basket.
I'm no vegan but I felt bad that chickens had to be slaughtered in order for me to eat last night.
You are in the Junction, eat elsewhere come here for the beer and Raptors afterwards."}
{"text":"Ordered from Gabby's through Uber Eats and spent well over $100 on food here for two. Found not one, not two, but THREE long strands of brown hair in a salad and wings that we had ordered. We called to have this justified and the hostess that answered was very rude and could care less about our issue. After spending that amount of money at your establishment and then being inconvenienced and disgusted with finding that hair, the least you could do is apologize. With that being said, I will never order from this place ever again. Food was horrible or at least what we had of it, customer service was appalling. Would never recommend this place. Unless you like eating hair with your food."}
{"text":"I don't usually review chain establishments but I had to step in and defend the Junction Gabby's.  

Sometimes I come here because in a hood peppered with very hip joints to drink and bite and play pinball, It can be refreshing to enjoy a booth of unpretentious familiarity.  Beer with a blue collar.  

Useless Review Tidbit:  I enjoy writing at the bar on a weeknight when the place is mostly empty and I can chill out with the nostalgia of sport narration in the background.  I know I can hang out and no one will rush or bother me.  I'm pretty sure By going there I'm recreating my parents basement in Brampton and the hours I spent doing homework while my dad watched the Leafs.  It taps right into my creative calm. 

But that isn't helpful for you, is it?

Okay. 

What might be of interest to you is that this particular Gabby's has one of the *best* gluten free menus I've seen in any bar.  Ever. Ask for it. It is a separate menu, which includes pizza, burgers, and other great selection.  Two choices of gluten free beer are usually in stock (I'd go for Bards).  

It is totally wheelchair accessible with a large main floor bathroom at the back.  

The patio is big and lovely. It's clean and kid friendly from what I've seen. 

Sadly this place doesn't get a ton of business -- but that means its a safe bet if you want to get a table, even for a group. 

The food is, what you would expect. Not mind blowing, but not bad at all.  Quite decent bar food. A lot of choice.  The steak goat cheese salad is HUGE and delicious, by the way. 

And the service. 
Yes, they seem to have a lot of turnover in the staff. 
But I've been going off and on for years now and have had nothing but warm, honest service.  Down to earth, helpful, attentive when they need to be but not overly so.  For some reason I feel like Im in a small(er) town when I go there. 

Occasionally, occasionally it becomes apparent that some servers just don't have enough training (like when I ordered a martini and got a big smile and a \"sure!\" I had to make sure to catch her as she walked away to complete the order -vodka not gin). 

Was it a great martini? Not by a long shot but I tend to consider the context. Gabby's is not where you go for a great martini, and I knew that.  I was there for the easy going atmosphere and the company. 

Are my standards too low? Maybe. 
Does managing your expectations help your dining experience? Probably.  

Mainly I want to say don't let some of these poor reviews scare you away.  The Junction Gabby's is a good one.  And the staff are good people."}
{"text":"This is in my girlfriend's neighbourhood and we've been once so far on one of those cold nights in late February when we were hungry and did not want to think or walk long for dinner.

No real surprises here--it is a Gabby's.  I was pleased to be able to get a Big Wheel on tap and bonus points for the gluten free menu.  Actually, extra bonus points for the kitchen being able to make my item special (no onions).  

But yeah--it is a Gabby's so you know what you are getting in terms of food and drink.  

Service from our waitress was excellent.

Two meals, two drinks, tax and tip was just under $50.  Don't assume that chain pubs are cheaper.  But don't assume they can't be as friendly or as customer oriented as indies.  While I do try to support local, independently owned businesses, in the end, especially with restaurants or pubs, I think it comes down to the location's staff and management.  This one is quite well run.

Recommended if you are on the west end of the Junction!"}
{"text":"I ordered off skip the dishes and received a burnt cheese pizza... It tasted like cardboard to keep it short. I will not eat here again as I was extremely dissatisfied."}
{"text":"Went to see Toronto FC win. Beer list not bad. House wine drinkable but that's about it. Nachos were amazingly bad. Lots of chips that were dry. Cheese sparse, bland, and not layered so some dried beyond being able to carve it off the waxy paper it was served on but most chips untouched by cheese. Tomatoes were in big chunks you couldn't get to balance on a nacho and they were quite cold. The tomatoes, like the tiny shreds of lettuce and the seven peppers, were on top and clearly hadn't been heated, so that was weird. 
Small side ramekins of sour cream and a very mild salsa did not help this mound of almost all chips much. 
Save your $16 and have another drink."}
{"text":"Only ok. We were in Toronto for the weekend and this was within walking distance from our airbnb so we decided to check it out. I got a Caesar salad which was meh.  My husband got Shrimp tacos which were pretty good but not outstanding."}
{"text":"It doesn't have to be this way!!!!

Recently I went into this new location to check out the Gabby's vibe and have lunch. I had never been into a Gabby's and was excited that a pub fare type of restaurant was open in the junction.

Unfortunately, Gabby's fits a typical pub pattern. This pattern assumes that people just want beer (or that the money is made from beer), and the quality of the food doesn't matter. I had a burger with onion rings. It was small and flavorless.  The bun was a bit stale.  The onion rings were stuck together just as they had been in the freezer.  The lettuce was limp.  The burger was 12-13$. 

I am not against chains.  In fact, you can have a much better burger with fries and a coke at Wendy's for about 1/2 the price. unfortunately, there is not a Wendy's very close by.

Gabby's may be good for a beer, but stay away from the food until you have had at least three beers. It is a shame that this place doesn't seem to care about good food.  It has a good pub formula, just typically not-so-good pub food."}
{"text":"The food was decent I thought for a pub like kind of food. The food I got was the fajitas, which was decent. Only thing I didn't like was the service. Poor service. It was almost like they were non existent. Waited more then 10 minutes for the bill and had to ask twice for it. Not only that, the waiter never checked up on us. Really disappointed. I'm never going to this place again."}
{"text":"Most of the reviews are pretty grim on here. Wasn't expecting much at all. Been here previously and the food did suck. 

However, this time I ordered the Guinness Beef Pot Pie with a side of onion rings and I was pleasantly surprised. 

Lots of flavor. Chunks of beef. Seasoned well. Only $10.99. 

Go for it. 

Dip the onion rings in the pot pie and maybe some mayonnaise. Yum. 

The pastry could use some work though, a bit tough. Service is a bit slow. All good though."}
{"text":"Not sure about this one. I've used the toilets at Gabby's on King (perfect spot to stop to unload before a film at the TIFF's Bell Lightbox) and Gabby's Roncesvalles and have had no problems whatsoever: clean, well-maintained facilities with good water pressure, free of offensive stall graffiti. But what's going on in the Junction? This Gabby's only has one toilet. And it's on the first floor! Not much privacy there. The toilet is accessible, which is great, but it's also unisex. So if you're there to watch the game, prepare to wait in line to use this toilet. I'd just as soon go at home! But where's the glamour in that?"}
{"text":"Personally I am not the biggest 'chain' fan but the Gabbys in the Junction, specifically has always has decent food.  Yes, service is slow but the service is decent considering they always short staff the place!

Tried out their Mad Jacks Rootbeer and well what a lovely discovery that was 

Poutine is one of my faves and it's not bad here.  $8 for a decent size and add $1 for your choice of chicken or ground beef--not bad!

This location has a lovely patio in the back with 3 TVs and very comfortable seating.  Inside, plenty of TVs to watch all your sporting desires.

Go Jays Go!"}
{"text":"Was here recently to watch a Raptors game with a friend. Place was 1/2 full. Took 10 minutes to be served. 
Ordered wings and found them to be very small and physically abused. As if the chickens were plucked by a lawnmower. Terrible. Service was friendly but that is it. Unlikely to return."}
{"text":"You ever go to a bar and say \"let's get the nachos...you can't f*ck up nachos!\" Well Gabby's can. It's so sad how bad the food is here. -Fin-"}
