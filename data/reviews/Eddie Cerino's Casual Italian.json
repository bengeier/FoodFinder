{"text":"I really liked this restaurant.  Had been to the former Eddie N Eddies once and probably wouldn't have gone back.  Now with this change to casual Italian, I'd definitely go back!  Although I enjoyed the eggplant parmagiana bolognese, it wasn't exactly what I thought it would be.  Instead of layered eggplant parm, it was breaded and fried disks of eggplant with tomato, cheese and sauce on top.  They could even be frozen eggplant disks for all I know. Again, It was good, but not what I expected based on the menu title.  The pizza was delicious though!  Would go back just for that and try some other great sounding items from the menu too.  Casual atmosphere, great service and a good dining experience overall."}
{"text":"What a great experience.   We were a group of 5 last night and the food was amazing, the service excellent. The bread they brought to our table lasted seconds and she brought us more.  I had the Veal Piccata, best I've ever had, I tried my son's Lemon chicken and my sisters chicken marsala all amazing.  We finished with coffee, cookies, and tiramisu .  We all left stuffed and raving  how great the  food and service were, and the price.... we'll all be back.   New Lakewood gem."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late lunch. Sparse crowd around 2:30. I had meatball sliders, my guest had veal pram. Both were very good, especially for lunch menu items. Great service and prices. This is a nice space with a menu worth exploring. The dinner menu is large without being overwhelming. Still a good bar selection, perhaps a carryover from the bourbon days."}
{"text":"I'm shocked by the good reviews of this place.  Perhaps we were just there on a bad night but we'll never know because we certainly will not return.   The place was busy which we expected for a Saturday night.  We fully anticipated the 30 minute wait and had no problem with it.  What we didn't anticipate was the seemingly chaotic and unorganized front of the house.  No one really seemed to be in charge and everyone seemed to do a little bit of everything.  With a crowd waiting to be seated, it took almost 10 minutes for a 4 top to be cleaned and prepped for a new party.  That's not really acceptable.   We like a bottle of wine with dinner and were not impressed with the wine list.  Not enough choices at various price points.  We were paying $25-30 if we wanted a bottle. I have no problem shelling out that kind of money for a decent vino but give me better choices! Plus, as we would come to find out, when the food at crappy Olive Garden tastes better, I'm good with a cheaper wine.   The bread was good.  I will give Eddie's Casual this much - they make good bread.  However, the olive oil for dipping was not tasty and with just a dusting of black pepper, nothing to get excited about. Boring.   We shared the Mussels Dominic appetizer. The mussels were overcooked in my opinion. And the broth - the whole point of ordering mussels is to have that yummy nectar to soak into your toast!! - was awful.  It tasted like basic chicken broth with a ton of garlic dumped in to make taste Italian. Where was the wine?? Where was the flavor from the mussels?? If anyone can find it, let me know!   We also shared an entree.  This is something we do almost all the time and we usually end up taking some home.  Not this night.  We ordered the $18 portion of the veal marsala. We received about $2 worth of flavor and it was all garlic.  This dish had ZERO flavor beyond the garlic and mediocre olive oil.  Zero.  Zilch.  I even checked under the table to see if it had fallen off while being delivered but nothing.  No wine, no veal, no mushroom, no peas.....none of any of those flavors.  When we finished eating, there was a pool of olive oil on the plate that rivaled the one used for bread dipping. Note to the chef(s): adding tons of garlic and an extra 1/2 cup of mediocre olive oil to a dish does not make it Italian or tasty.  It just makes it gross.  My stomach felt icky the rest of the night and I'm pretty sure I can still taste the garlic two days later.    I will not return. I hope that this place improves drastically or gives way to something more deserving of the prime real estate in downtown Lakewood. There are way too many GOOD options (not even mentioning great options) within a 10 mile radius to even consider giving this place a second chance."}
{"text":"This place is so much better as an Italian restaurant! I went when it was  Eddie 'n' Eddie. My burger was alright and the service was good. We ate there for the again last week (after they switched to just Italian) and loved it! Not expensive and the food was good. Our service was great. We waiting a half an hour for a table but you are going to wait anywhere on a Saturday night at 7:00pm. Totally give Eddie Cerino's Casual Italian a try, you won't be disapointed."}
{"text":"There was a nice crowd for a Thursday night.  This is my first time since the restaurant changed from Eddie 'N Eddie Burgers, Bourbon & Apple Pie.  Our waitress was welcoming, nice and attentive.  I ordered the veal marsala and my partner ordered the sausage bakes ziti.  Both were delicious and reasonably priced.  The portion size was filling, so I didn't have any room for dessert.  I'll definitely be going back to try some more entrees."}
{"text":"My husband and I finally tried Eddie Cerino's this past week, and I have to say, it exceeded my expectations.    First off the hostess was so sweet and worked her butt off in making sure no one waited long for a table.  We walked in and she ran over to us with a warm smile.  Our waitress (Crystal) was amazing.  Super sweet, helpful and gave us the perfect amount of attention throughout dinner.  Everyone that works at Cerinos just seems really happy to be working there.  Really sets the atmosphere.  Our eyes were bigger than our stomachs.  We ordered three appetizers and two entrees.  Oops!  Everything sounded so yummy so we panicked.  We tried the meatball app, almond/date salad, and the broccolini app.  Sooo good!  For dinner we had the baked ziti and the eggplant parmesan.  Both were soooo delicious, and even tasted great as leftovers the next day.  Highly recommend trying Eddie Cerinos!"}
{"text":"Wow, excellent food, service and bread! I came here on New Year's Eve and they were very busy, but the service was still great. We ordered baked ravioli and chicken piccata, and both were excellent! The bread was delicious, fluffy Italian bread with a crispy, salty asiago topping. Prices were very reasonable too.  I will definitely be coming back! They also have an after work happy hour with $3 wine and $4 appetizers which I can't wait to try."}
{"text":"Be prepared to be surprised by the quality of the food in this casual eatery. The pizza alone is worth the trip, but the pasta frutti di mare was superb!  The service was attentive, but not overbearing.    Happy hour specials, both drinks and food, were real bargains. Prices in general are modest. Great restaurant!"}
{"text":"Really tasty traditional Italian. I loved Eddie 'n' Eddie so I was initially bummed about the Cerino's switch, but I'm over it now.   The food here is awesome and the menu has a ton of variety. Cocktails and beer list are great, service is good. I usually expect to wait but I don't mind hanging out at the bar. Their bread is AWESOME and the mussels are my favorite appetizer. Pasta is solid and offers a range of homestyle options to more contemporary dishes. My favorite is the asparagus ravioli, and the crispy gnocchi.   Very glad to have another solid Italian joint in Lakewood. It's such a treat!"}
{"text":"POOR --- This used to be a wonderful place to go. He service s excellent, nine better. However when they changed the theme, they missed the boat. We gave it three chances and each time the food was bland at best. Seasoned poorly, meat was not even close to being tender. Each time it got worse. We thought originally it was the cooks getting use to the new menu. But it didn't get any better. I am not a chef but every meal we had I could have not only presented it more appealing but the flavor and meals would have been 120% better. They should have kept the old theme. We'd still be going 3 times a week and not only telling our friends but also bringing them to eat also."}
{"text":"When Eddie 'N Eddie closed I was sad to see them go- although it wasn't an ownership change, more like a concept change. I'm still sad about the change after trying out the new menu @ Cerino's. I am not a fan of the two offerings my husband and I sampled. In fact, I don't think I have ever had such a terrible serving of a three cheese tortellini dish anywhere; soggy pasta and asparagus that tasted like it was canned.yuck. Takeout may not be the best representation of a an eatery's culinary skills- but it shouldn't be inedible! It was bad enough that we threw it out. Our second dish, the Corti Bucati was OK, but not exciting. Parts of it were cold (like it had been inexpertly reheated), this despite the fact that we live only a few houses away from the restaurant.  Too bad- and bad enough that I doubt we will try again."}
{"text":"After a less than appealing experience at Deagan's, strolled across the street to Cerino's. It was awesome. The calamari and fresh made pizzas were outstanding. Great service at the bar and the place had a great vibe and smelled amazing! Will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was nice, open, and clean. I like the large windows! Plus valet is $4 up front then you get the $4 removed from your bill..totally a great deal. There is only one female/male bathroom so there is a wait to use it unless you go into the hall and use the public one adjacent to the akron college. Which to me is not convenient at all and there should be more restrooms in the restaurant. The service was fabulous. We had a birthday party of 15, he split up the checks, he was attentive and very friendly..we brought our own cake and the server brought it out on a cart with utensils and plate..amazing service!  Not to the FOOD! My biggest concern was that there is NO salad served with the meals. I paid $4 bucks for a tiny side salad to accompany my meal. They did serve bread and oil with the meals and the bread was flavorful and delicious. I taste tested my friends foods also and overall the flavors were authentic and very tasty! They offer half or full portions and I opted for a half portion of the gnocchi and chicken and I was not impressed with the half portion size..IT WAS TINY!! But very good, fresh, and delicious! I will definitely go again and I think next time I will come as a family!! Worth a 2nd or even 3rd visit!1"}
{"text":"Very pleasant experience. Went on Saturday night. Only waited about 15 minutes for a table. Food served very quickly. Had the special - asparagus ravioli primavera. Ordered the full but took almost half home. Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"It was a cold, winter night when I came here. It was Saturday night so of course, it was very crowded and the wait was around 45 minutes. When the wait was over, we were seated and greeted by our waitress. She was very friendly and seemed like she had a lot of experience with the food and restaurant business in general. (I wish I would have remembered her name!!) She helped us with the menu and I ordered some type of chicken pasta. It was really good. Like it has been five months since I've been there and I still think about it good. The location sucks and I wish there was a closer parking lot but the food and service definitely make up for it! If you're looking for a good quality Italian meal, make sure you give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times and the food and service is consistently good.  I'm not even a big italian food person but I would happily go here anytime."}
{"text":"Went there with my husband, both of us left satisfied. The food was fresh, the service is nice, clean place, will go there again."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Cerino's in Broadview Heights, and I also really enjoyed Eddie 'N Eddie. I had no doubts that Cerino's Casual Italian would be good at what it does. I guess I understand why Eddie 'N Eddie had to go. And aside from Peppers (and I guess Angelos, and some other small pizzerias), there isn't a lot of casual Italian in Lakewood. I'd consider Cerino's to be a little bit more elevated than just \"casual,\" in fact. There's something about the space that is more than just that old, mom & pop place. I love those types of places, I really do. But sometimes you just need a little bit of space and a modern touch.   Anyway, that's all about the idea of this place and the reputation that Eddie holds. However, I was a little disappointed with my takeout experience. I know, it's not the same as dining in. But the baked ziti was very bland. I was surprised, actually. There was plenty of fresh basil, the cheese was good and the pasta was cooked well, but a little more salt & pepper could have brought this dish to another level. (**Edited to add \"duh realization moment\": I ordered it without the sausage. So obviously the sausage would have added more flavor. So, I guess my suggestion would be to do something to the vegetarian version of this dish to balance it out a bit.**)  My husband loved his cortini dish -- and so did I. This had pulled pork, ricotta, and other stuff. It was delicious. In contrast to the underseasoned ziti dish, the bread they provided with the order was overly salty. I'm usually a bread beast, but I only had once piece.  Also, I had ordered a salad, and even after confirming the order over the phone and again when I picked up, it wasn't in the bag. I called and they were unable to refund the charge for the salad on my credit card for some reason, so they gave me a \"credit\" for a salad next time I come in. I was like, \"So, you're just gonna write down my name, and you'll know?\" I guess we'll see how organized they are about this sort of thing. If I were them, I might have either a) sent someone out to deliver my salad (I live in Lakewood, 5 mins away), or b) I would have gotten my email address or home address and sent a gift card, just to ensure that it wouldn't be lost in the insanity that is a new(ish) restaurant.  Because I have always had a great experience at the other Cerino locations (and great feedback from Eddie himself), I'll certainly give this place another try soon."}
{"text":"I have been here for lunch and dinner and both times service was fast and the food was good. I've sampled a few of their dishes and have not had anything I haven't liked. You can't go wrong with an item on the menu. I also like that you have the option of ordering almost any of their dishes in half size or full size.  The complimentary bread is phenomenal but be careful because it is endless! :)  Happy Hour Deals: $3 House wine, $5 special cocktails and $5 food items such as 2 different types of pizza, meatball sliders and calamari.  Tuesday nights they have BOGO pizza and it applies to any size."}
{"text":"I've had a few meals from Eddie Cerino's Casual Italian. Large potion sizes and decent prices on everything I've ordered.   I'm really fond of the Rene Boucher calamari. It's some of the better (fried) calamari I've had.  They serve it with a lemon aioli as well as marinara. It's a lighter breading, which I prefer, that allows the seafood to shine more than tasting mostly fried breading as you'll find at a lot of restaurants.  I'm looking forward to trying the other 2 kinds of calamari they have on the menu.   I've had pasta and salads that have also been good.   I particularly like that they offer half or full portions on the menu. I've only ordered the half potions so far and, as I said, the potions are sizable.   I've had good service and it's a nice, open, and clean restaurant.   I'm torn between 3 and 4 stars. Remembering the focaccia bread that was served (with olive oil) prior to the meal bumps it up to a 4. It was flavorful and, what can I say, I'm a sucker for carbs."}
{"text":"Having been to Eddie n Eddies several times and enjoying it, we decided to take my parents out on a Wednesday night to the new Eddie Cerinos.  Arriving at 6pm, we were promptly seated in the dining area (nice atmosphere) and greeted by our server. She informed us of the happy hour specials - the happy hour goes until 6:30 and is served in the entire restaurant. $5 appetizers and pizzas (all of which range from $8-13 normally), $5 cocktails/martinis ($9-10 normally), $4/$3 house wine and beer. We all ordered some delicious happy hour drinks (cerinopolitan is great!) and the blanco pizza, BBQ pizza, fried zucchini planks, and crispy calamari. On top of all this, we were served their delicious bread (kind of a salty sourdough) with olive oil and pepper.  After apps, we ordered entrees to share: The E n E burger with fries($11?), amazing Lemon Chicken Parmesan($12), and the small tossed salad ($6) (which was more than enough to share).  After enjoying dinner, we opted for the pan-baked chocolate chip cookie with two large scoops of vanilla bean ice cream. This may be my new favorite dessert in the Cleveland area.   I have three years experience working in an Italian concept restaurant ... Eddie Cerinos has outdone themselves and they should be proud to bring this concept to lakewood.  I think what was most surprising to my party was the affordability combined with the generous portion sizes. The prices are better than most chain restaurants, portions are larger or as large, and quality cannot be matched. I will make this place my new go-to happy hour, especially when I have company or family in town. For a party of 4, we each had a couple drinks, shared 2 apps, 2 pizzas, 1 salad, 2 entrees, and a dessert. Our total bill was $90 plus a $20 tip to total $110. This cannot be beat. We also left stuffed and with a couple boxes of leftovers. In hindsight, we probably should have left another $5-10 for our server since she was so on-point and a portion of our bill was discounted due to happy hour pricing. I recall a recent trip to Brio in Westlake. Our bill was over $200 and we all left hungry- not to mention the subpar quality of the pasta/food.  Also id like to mention that Eddies still has the best ice cubes in town."}
{"text":"Recently visited Eddie Cerino's at the recommendation of several friends on a Sunday afternoon after visiting Playhouse Square.  Very, very pleased with our meals!  Salads were fresh and HUGE and we ordered the 1/2 portion...highly recommend the salad with brussel spouts and my husband enjoyed the Italian Salad.  Lemony chicken and pasta with shrimp were also delicious...plentiful and served hot with a smile.  Bottles of wine are 1/2 off on Sunday...what a nice surprise!  Will definately return!"}
{"text":"Food was good but not fantastic. I had the special eggplant Napoleon. Caprese salad was light and very tasty. The eggplant was crispy and not greasy at all, combined with the goat cheese it was great. The pasta was slightly overlooked and the sauce just didn't have that homemade taste.   My husband had the chicken marsala which was really nothing special. I usually expect it do be lightly dredged in a seasoned flour and served with the Marsala sauce. But the chicken was naked and the sauce lacked flavor. There weren't even any mushrooms, but maybe that's just how I make mine.   Most likely will go again to try the pizza because we have heard it's one of the better things on the menu."}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is pretty good, they are VERY accommodating for large party get-togethers. They let us bring in our own cake and were really nice about us needing to add to our reservations. Prices are very fair! I highly recommend the brussel sprout salad. They also have fantastic bread. Lakewood is lucky to have this place :) Keep it up, Cerino's!!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  While I haven't had everything on the menu I will say their soups and salads never disappoint.  You have to try their Brussels sprout salad."}
{"text":"I have been here twice and I am super impressed. I was not a huge fan of E & E's although in its defense, I went when it FIRST opened and then not again until it was closing. I did really enjoy the E & E burger, which is also on their current menu as well, so I'm glad about that.  I have had two very delicious meals since it switched to Italian and my mind has been changed. The bread is SO good, like food crack good....the mussels are absolutely delicious! Some of my favorite that I have had anywhere. Last time I got the Tuscan dinner salad which was a great portion size sprinkled with freshly made beans, crispy prosciutto and some other stuff. We also sampled a pizza as well as the spaghetti & meatballs and baked ziti. Everything was so good...a little TOO good for this place to be only a few blocks away! I like the white table cloths and the way the restaurant seems to have 'classed up' a bit. The service is always GREAT, very friendly and efficient. A great place to go with family. It seems like the guy that owns this realized the needs of Lakewood neighborhood and made a very smart business decision. There are lots of places to get a burger in the area, but definitely none to deliver the kind of experience that Eddie's Casual Italian does. I will continue to support as much as I can. Hope it sticks around, by the looks of how busy it is on weekends I bet it will."}
{"text":"I'm really torn between 3 and 4 stars for this place, so I guess we can call that a 3.5.  This is a pretty decent spot for some Italian food. The bread they serve before your meal is actually one of my favorite parts about this place, and I mean that as a compliment (when I'm trying to criticize you'll know it, just wait until paragraph two). I've had calamari, which was great, and some pasta dishes that were quite good. I'm a fan of the chicken piccata. The pasta is above average, but it won't exactly knock your socks off. Although I prefer that everyone keeps their socks on when they go out to eat. The thought of a bunch of barefoot people at a restaurant is very unsettling to me.  That being said, I have a major issue with one particular thing at Cerino's: they make their chicken parm with a tomato slice on top instead of sauce. That was an automatic -1 star for me. There's no need to be cute here, ditch that tomato slice. Have you ever had caprese salad? Delicious. Have you ever thought to yourself, \"Hey lets stick this caprese salad in the oven for 25 minutes and then toss it on some chicken\"? No. Because that's ridiculous. If you want to see the look of sheer disappointment embodied in one man's facial expression, promise me chicken parm and then give me chicken with a tomato slice on top.   Final verdict: This is a nice spot for some good Italian, not formal, but not super casual. A nice in-between. The food is mostly pretty tasty. Their bread is amazing. But for the love of God, Cerino's, get rid of that tomato slice on your chicken parm."}
{"text":"Decent Italian food with lots of vegetarian options. The marinara was a little too thick for my taste. The staff is friendly. The location is great."}
{"text":"Fantastic! My boyfriend and I made our way to this place for the first time after a really terrible experience at Jammy Buggars down the road. Very very glad we did...the service was friendly and attentive the atmosphere was nice and the food was really great.... I had a house salad with the crispy gnocchi and my boyfriend had the chicken parmesan, they were large portions and not overpriced at all...the food was delicious! I can't wait to go back and try some other things on the menu...it all looked so good! Very happy we tried this place!"}
{"text":"Lakewood beer festival - great caprese a d meatball sliders!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch on Saturday. We've been to the Seven Hills location several times & hadn't been impressed the last few times. We had also been to the burger place which was alright. The place was relatively empty, & once seated had to be moved for a private party. No big deal, & we ended up with a window seat for the Halloween dog parade. The fried risotto balls had a faintness of seafood, I think it might be the same fryer for the calamari? It was pretty cheesy & tasty otherwise, great marinara. Good salad, that's always been consistent at all their locations. I had the tortellini. It came in a clear broth that was so salty it was almost inedible. The bread was also a bit dry. Service was good, as is the ambiance. I just wish they were better. I don't think it would take much to improve on the food, but for what it was and the price, I don't know if it's worth going back."}
{"text":"A friend and I were looking for a new place to try and we decided on this since we both had not been there and we were both impressed.   To start off the waitress was one of the nicest, most friendly, helpful waitresses I have ever encountered.  I was a little early before my friend got there so I watched her interact with other tables as well and I had never seen one waitress connect with all her tables the way she did. I wish I knew her name - but she was on the younger side with long brown hair.   Now onto the food.  I ordered the wedding soup and the crispy gnocchi and both were delightful! Sometimes wedding soup can be way too salty but theirs was not.  It came in a nice size bowl with a good mixture of meatballs and pasta.  Then the gnocchi was in my opinion to die for! I love spinach and pesto and that was the sauce with grilled seasoned chicken.  It was delicious and I only got the half order and still had leftovers - so I can only imagine what the full order was like.    My friend is a vegetarian and opted for the eggplant sandwich and she said it was cooked very well and the sauce that came on the side was tasty.  She had some changes to her meal and the staff was very accommodating.  They had a chocolate pecan pie on the dessert menu that I wish I could of tried but I was too full so I will be going back!    I also had a glass of wine and it was very reasonably priced so I would totally go back just for drinks and appetizers as well. Now I LOVED Eddie 'n Eddie's and I would say the change was probably for the better for the business side but thankfully it did not falter on the food change either!"}
{"text":"Obsessed with their Brussells Sprout salad!! To die for! I love this place. Great food, great service and atmosphere. I've gotten takeout often and it's always packaged well and the quality never diminished."}
{"text":"Crowded on a Monday. I heard the owner(?) say to another person at the bar that he changed the concept because he wasn't making it as a burger place. I get it, there are a lot of burger choices in Lakewood.   I had a very nice salad (very large serving) and a roasted pork with pasta entree. Different and very good. There're are several interesting salad choices. There are some different entree choices as well. I will be back to try more items. Many sounded interesting. Everyday soup is wedding soup. They have a changing special soup also. Several calamari ap specials.   Glad they changed. In my estimation I would come here over the other two very near by highly rated places that are very crowded and frankly getting a little stale. I had heard the service at the old Eddies could be a little spotty. I had no problems on a very crowded Monday. I did notice several new servers getting trained."}
{"text":"I went here with a group of coworkers for lunch.  The food was good and so were the prices.  They were able to accommodate the vegan in our group.  I will be back for more of their yummy food."}
{"text":"This was a fantastic addition to the Lakewood restaurant scene, as it is now one of only three Italian places in the entire city. It has fantastic food, very good service, and the atmosphere is very comfortable yet modern. I highly recommend a visit. They also have a good Happy Hour."}
{"text":"VERY affordable and so delicious. At first, I was annoyed that they changed the restaurant from Eddie N Eddie's which we loved, but after trying the food at Eddie Cerino's everything changed. I love the pizzeria salad. They offer half portions of most entrees which is helpful. To be honest, the one specific thing to write home about is the bread they bring to the table - warm and amazing!"}
{"text":"I was drawn in by sign promising creamy augratin onion soup.  I grabbed a cup to go.  They threw in a fresh chunk of cheese bread, kind of a sour dough taste.   The soup was really good, but not heavy cream here.   They throw French fried onions on top.   Nice small lunch.  The food they were serving was mostly italian dishes. The smells were to die for.   They offer 7 different lunch specials at $ 9.99."}
{"text":"I am very excited to have an Italian restaurant so close to my house. So far I've had the following--chicken piccata, lemon parm chicken, and baked ravioli. They were all good, but needed salt and pepper. The pasta is always slightly overcooked, I'm used to al dente, but I know that's a little tough with angel hair :) service is always rocking! Ask for Krystal's section! She served us when it was eddie n eddies and she is still there after the transition! Our bartender the other night was also very nice (Amy?).  I will be back, hopefully there will be slightly more flavor."}
{"text":"I was pretty disappointed when I heard that Eddie 'n Eddie was being replaced by a casual Italian concept. I can count on one hand the number of times I've been out for Italian in the last five years so I had pretty much written off this place by default. So what got my butt in their seats? Once again, Groupon was the catalyst. My wife purchased a pair of them ($11 for $20) so off we went.  I'll break it down real quick like before I dive into my usual copiously verbose rant:  The food was actually pretty good. The service, alas, was not. Now, on with the show.  We arrived somewhere around 6:45pm on a Friday evening. Not our normal MO, that's for sure. While not terribly crowded, there was a solid attendance. We actually had to wait about 10 minutes to be seated. Strange seeing as how we could clearly see several empty tables from our vantage point by the front door. Anyway, the greeting was friendly enough so let's continue.   Our table, a two top crammed between two other two-tops, was a bit close for comfort but we managed. BTW, the table was miniature with barely enough room for the doodads they've got setting on them. By the time you work in the olive oil container, the bread basket, your silverware, side plates and your drinks you've got pretty limited real estate. More about that later.  Our server approached, appearing a bit flustered by the business of the place, and proceeded to provide us with some fresh-baked focaccia bread while pouring out some olive oil onto a plate and sprinkling some pepper on it. Unnecessary showmanship. I'll say one thing, though, that bread was frickin' fantastic. Soft, warm, salty, herby; I did my best to resist but failed miserably.   Now what about that service. Two words: slow and inattentive. It took forever between courses, between drink refills, you name it. I don't mind a wait when things are busy but this was noticeably long. Another thing that really bugged me was that our plates weren't cleared in a timely fashion. We finished our app and the empty plate sat there. Our salads were delivered, we finished those, and now three empty plates sat. When our entrees were delivered the person that dropped the off (not our server) actually had to push our other plates out of the way with them to make room. C'mon, man. Really? We were positioned right by the kitchen, plenty of employees could see our table and nobody bothered. Big strike against them here. Too bad, really, because the food was another story.  FYI: Quite a few things on the menu come in whole and half sizes. Order the half sizes, trust me. They're still huge. The half-sized salads are still as big as your head and plenty for two.   Rene Boucher Calamari - Your traditional breaded and fried variety. Well-seasoned, a slight touch of heat and the lemon aioli was a nice dipping sauce. The marinara was also pretty tasty.  Caesar Reggiano - Your bare-bones Caesar served with a couple of croutoned (very salty) fococcia slices and a sprinkling of cheese. The dressing was pretty bland and lacked acid. Since our plate from the calamari was still on our table we corrected this error with the lemon wedge.  Pizzeria House - This salad has become standard fare on just about everyone's menu. Romaine, field greens, cran-raisins, sunflower seeds, goat cheese, and balsamic vinaigrette. I thought it was pretty good, veg was fresh, dressing wasn't overwhelming.  Corti Bucati - Spiral pasta, shredded roasted pork shoulder, cremini mushrooms, white wine, tomato, and lemon ricotta. My wife really liked this dish. The dollop of ricotta was fresh and tart and the pasta, made in house, was cooked perfectly. Big chunks of tomato and fresh basil added to the heartiness.  Twin Filets - I was in a red meat mood and this was done right. Two small beef medallions sautéed with cremini mushrooms and cherry tomatoes accompanied by a brown sauce and Italian roasted potatoes. The meat was tender, juicy, and cooked a perfect medium. The potatoes were tasty, with plenty of herbs and onions but the various sized wedges led to some inconsistent levels of doneness. I still managed to polish off every last bit.  So herein lies my dilemma. They tasted a solid four stars, no doubt, but glaring service errors couldn't save them from the inevitable mediocrity of three-stardom. We'll be back because we still have another Groupon to use but I honestly have much lower expectations for our return visit."}
{"text":"If you don't have time to go to Little Itlay or some way pricey place downtown, this is probably some of the best Italian you'll find.  Now, this appetizer should come back and they'll get six stars, the caprese sliders, fresh mozerella, basil, balsamic and tomato on their super scrumptious bread was awesome.  In the mean time the zucchini planks are pretty good.  Entrees, the bolognese and crispy gnocchi are fantastic dishes. If you get the full orders, be prepped to take home leftovers.  The Italian dip is pretty good, too, but I like being wowed by the pasta at Italian places over almost any thing else.  I regret not saving enough room for the olive oil cake that was on special because it sounded diving but the spumoni they have is great and bring back childhood memories of the stuff at my grampa's."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Italian place to go to! Bread is great and the chicken parm. (im pretty picky) is amazing! They also have a great happy hour with pizzas and meatball sliders only being 5 bucks! Hopefully they can stay for along time because I try to go as much a I can!"}
{"text":"I can summarize our dining experience at Cerino's this evening just by sharing the quotes overheard from two adjacent tables.   \"This is the best Italian I've ever had!\"  \"I'd come here again in a heartbeat!\"  The dinner service was busy, about a 20 minute wait, but well worth it. We checked out the new Campbell's Sweets store across the street while we waited.  If you dig Italian fare, you should definitely give this place a shot. Great food, good service, overall very positive experience.   Look forward to stopping by again."}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant out with friends this past weekend. was seated quickly for a Saturday evening but don't let the lack of wait fool us. We ordered the traditional calamari for an appetizer which was crisp and tasty and well paired with the lemon aioli. For dinner we split the crispy gnocchi which was was served in a larger bowl with pesto and grape tomatoes. The service was quick and always there when you needed something. Our friends spoke highly of the martini quality and drinks that were ordered. If you are looking for a great low key Italian without having to get to Ritzed up this is your place."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time lastnight with the family. Service was excellent. We did go very late ( about an hour before they were to close). Food was great. I got the carbonra pasta bake ( small size portion), my son got the dinner special which was lobster ravioli and my fiance got the chicken parm. For dessert we got the cookie pizzette...we were in heaven! Just typing about it makes me want one! And I cant forget the awesome drink I had...cerinopolitan...i could have seriously drank it right down in one drink, so good!"}
{"text":"Amazing! Food was great and the service even better. I had the chicken Parm witch was very fresh and my date has the pesto chicken. The menu is just the right size. Great place to watch the World Cup!"}
{"text":"Started at the bar. 2 draft beers cost $15. Ok so 1 was a pricy Belgian so I would expect that, but the other beer was a lager, not worthy of a $7 price tag.  We were promptly seated but waited way too long for a server (he apologized). A different person brought bread to the table and then confessed he didn't know how to work the cheese grater or the pepper grinder [who is this guy?] we had to show him.  When the food arrived there was no silverware at the table (I hate that!). I had Broccoli Rabe - good thing the silverware included a steak knife, I needed that. I also had Zucchini Planks which were tasty and had 2 different dipping sauces, also tasty. He had the Chicken Parm but was not impressed. Carrabbas is way better he said.  There are loads of places to eat at in Lakewood so we probably won't return."}
{"text":"Grant and I went there tonight. We each got the special, he got the chicken while I got the eggplant ravioli. It was all so good! The service was excellent. We found seats at the bar so we didn't have to wait the 40 minutes they said it would take for a table. Both of us cannot wait to go again, the menu has all kinds of stuff we BOTH want to try, which is tough to do since I'm vegetarian and he is not. We are definitely going back."}
{"text":"Hubby had a late working night one Saturday (today) and I really had been craving spaghetti. We are new to lakewood and I'm very weary of trying new places... But what else can you do but try new places when EVERY SINGLE THING AROUND Is unfamiliar :) anyhow. We found this place on Yelp and decided why not. We ordered the spaghetti and meatballs, Marsala and some bread. Delicious. It was fast, on time and they even have a curbside pick up. The young woman came out to us, delivered our food to the car and even took the credit card inside to run it. The bread was so yummy, the meatballs were cooked just right and the chicken was superb! Mind you, this was all at 10 o'clock at night. We will definitely be back when we want some italian!"}
{"text":"We came here on a recommendation from a local and it was a great place to stop. Brock, our server, was awesome. Super friendly, funny and knowledgable.  Great impression of nice people in this city!  The bread was delish and loved the layout of the place.   Ordered the butternut squash ravioli, it was tasty!"}
{"text":"I hope Cleveland has the critical mass to support all of the new businesses that keep sprouting up. I was bummed out when Eddie 'N Eddie closed down. A few menu options survived the transition like the Balsamic Bleu burger which is nice. I have tried the whole wheat chicken sorrento, eggplant and veal parms from the menu and I was not blown away or turned off by any of them. The chicken sorrento was my least favorite of the offerings. It was somewhat bland yet a healthier option. The prices are in line with the \"casual\" vibe and name. The staff has always been great at providing quality service. There are a lot more places to eat in Lakewood now compared to a decade ago when it was mostly bar food and I am thankful for that."}
{"text":"I hate myself for coming to Eddie Cerino's...not because the food was bad or the service was sub-par, but because I ate so much food that I won't be able to burn off those calories for weeks! The atmosphere is nice, and as stated in the name, very casual. It's a place where you can enjoy a sandwich and a draft beer or a fancy Italian dish with a nice wine.  I ordered the parmesan lemon chicken, while my S.O. ordered the sausage ziti. Both dishes were delicious, though my chicken could have used a little more lemon or seasoning. It was a tad on the bland side, but the chicken was lightly breaded and fried to melt-in-your-mouth perfection. The ziti was great as well, but I felt the marinara sauce was a just little underwhelming. The sausage was the real star of that dish: a nice mix of sweet and spicy. We ordered some plain-jane side salads, and they were topped with fabulous toppings like mozzarella and banana peppers. Their house dressing is purely addictive. Everyone raves about the bread here, but ours was ice cold. We were hungry and ate through our first basket, and the second arrived just as a first: cool on the tongue. But, I guess you shouldn't judge a place just on bread.  I wasn't sure about ordering a cocktail, but I'm glad I did (their draft beer list was surprising long and temping). I ordered a seasonal sangria while the date ordered a fruity orange drink with muddled fennel. Both cocktails were beautifully crafted, mouthwatering, and aesthetically pleasing. Honestly, it wasn't something I was expecting from a \"casual Italian\" establishment.  The prices are quite fair for the quality of food you will receive. The service was average with no frills, but that's to be expected. It's a great place to either take a date or have a happy hour drink with your co-workers. Chances are you'll leave overly full and wholeheartedly satisfied."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in on a Sunday evening and found Eddie's filled almost to capacity but there was room for the two of us. The atmosphere is casual but pleasant as there's enough background conversation to give some life to the place but it's not so loud that you can't converse at a normal level. Our waitress was pleasant, attentive and efficient. She brought us warm asiago bread to snack on as we looked over the menu. The food selection was a little different from most Italian restaurants; We felt the chef uses his imagination in his food combinations. My wife ordered a chicken parmigiana sandwich along with a bowl of wedding soup. She exclaimed the soup as excellent, the best wedding soup she'd ever had because of the many ingredients. Her sandwich was another pleasant experience for her; flavorful chicken on a nice foccacio bun. On the other hand I was in for a real surprise when I tasted my \"Spaghetti Frutti Di Mare\". The menu stated the pasta/sea food dish would have a \"Spicy tomato sauce\" but WOW! I was thinking 'flavor spicy' and they were thinking 'heat spicy' Way too much heat so that it overpowered all the other flavors in such a delicate dish.  We finished the meal with a very tasty dish of Spumoni ice cream. Definitely deserves another visit but next time I'll ask some questions before ordering."}
{"text":"Good bye Eddie Cerino's! We will miss the the people, the restauant, and most of all the food & wine! Looking forward to visiting your new place soon!"}
