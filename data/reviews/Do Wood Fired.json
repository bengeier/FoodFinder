{"text":"Really enjoyed this place.  The table ordered two 12\" pizzas and four dO-wiches. The wood fired pizza was just great. The dO-wiches came with pizza dough subbing for the rolls. A clever idea for a sandwich indeed.  Great service and friendly staff.  If you like pizza and sandwiches, this place is for you."}
{"text":"Great new little pizza place hidden away in Irwin, Pa among the the circa 1800 buildings.  We had the 1972, half pepperoni, half sausage, and added green onions.  Definitely the best pizza this part of Pennsylvania."}
{"text":"Perfect joint for pizza with friends or great takeout. BYOB, too!"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!! Great food, staff, and atmosphere. Salads are huge and the pizza is to die for. I can't say enough good things about this place. It's friendly to your wallet, too. I don't think enough people know about this place! I've lived in the area all my life and just discovered it a month ago. If you haven't been here yet, you NEED to go!"}
{"text":"First time here,  impressed!!  Pretty finicky about my pizza and this was absolutely delicious!!!!  Five star"}
{"text":"Great find. Nice crust from real fired pizza oven. Highly customizable menu. Worth the slight detour off the main highway."}
{"text":"An easy five star review. One of the best wood fired crusts I've had, plus quick, friendly service. Check-box menu to customize your pizza is a nice touch. And you won't miss out if you want to order a sandwich instead - they're served up on wood-fired flat bread. PA Turnpike travelers - it's worth jumping off the Irwin exit to stop here."}
{"text":"Excellent margarita pizza, love BYOB and our service couldn't have been better. We will certainly be back- often!!!"}
{"text":"Great new spot.  My wife and I have been meaning to try the pizza since hearing good things about it.  Way better than expectations!  We also had the Italian sandwich (comes with crispy homemade chips), which was every bit as good as the pizza. See you again soon, Do."}
{"text":"This is the BEST place to get pizza!! The staff is super kind and the food is outstanding. I came here on my 16th birthday and staff was so awesome and welcomed gifts and even treated me to a giftcard! Highly recommend it for lunch or dinner!!"}
{"text":"We have have visited 5-6 times and the food and service have been consistently excellent.  This is a simple, casual pizza joint concentrating on a few menu items only.  The pizzas are of course the star attraction, but the sandwiches have become my favorite choices.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This is the best place to eat! I recommended it to a lot of people and they said they like it a lot . this is a good place to go on a date or just to hang with friends. There is an amazing selection of food! I really love the pizza."}
{"text":"Excellent atmosphere.  Very cozy.   Great for a lunch or dinner date!   I'll be back to try the sandwiches. The pizza was very tasty.   Just the right amount of toppings. The crust was amazing.   I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"We drove past do wood many times and tonight we decided to try it.  I ordered a burger sandwich and my spouse ordered a grilled chicken salad.  The burger as so greasy I couldn't pick it up.  And they lost my spouses order and that resulted in lots of yelling between the staff. It seemed they were messing up a lot of orders.  When my wife's salad finally came the chicken was dried out.  I can be confident that I won't be back."}
{"text":"Started going after Sunday church in Irwin with my grandson for a takeout pie a few months ago.
Nice place , excellent pizza.. I wish it was closer to my house."}
{"text":"The first 2 times I went this place was great, but with their popularity they seem to have lost what made them special.  The place is hot and loud and the food is just ok.  They are in such a rush it seems they don't cook the Pizza to its crispy goodness.  Very sad.  This place was great, but lacks consistency. Find them not busy and you will probably be pleased."}
{"text":"We stopped here on our way to Michigan.  Delicious pizza, plentiful toppings (included in the price), delicious salads, friendly service, welcoming owner who comes to your table to introduce himself.  Not far from the highway, but cute neighborhood location.  Really a special place if you're in the mood for just-right crust, great sauce and fresh toppings.  Yum!!!"}
{"text":"The family and I couldn't decide on what to get so we tried a few items. The sandwiches are made on their pizza crust and the Club Do Wiche was fantastic!  The Pecan Chicken salad was great as well and was packed with extras like feta, dried cranberries and pecans. We finished up with the pizza and I think I have found my new favorite in the area.  The crust was as good as the sauce and they finished with just the right amount of cheese. 
The staff was nice, the owner said hello and thanked us for coming in, the place was clean and modern. We will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Great pizza. Had the Philly with beef. Just found a ringer! Quick and great price :-)"}
{"text":"Just stopped here while making a road trip.  This place earns 5 stars from me based on food and service.  Service was outstanding:  I asked if they could sauté the onions & peppers before putting it on the pizza.  The staff was very accommodating and had no problem doing that for me, which was a pleasant surprise.  Our waitress was very attentive and considerate.  Food was delicious:  We had requested thin crust well done pizza, and we got one of the best pizzas we've had in a long time.  Great sauce, sautéed toppings and generous amount of cheese.  The crust itself was amazing.  I loved it and would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"My husband picked up a white pizza and Italian sandwich tonight, both were awesome! The pizza was one of the best I've ever had, so much flavor in every bite (and trust me, I've eaten a lot of pizza). When we get a white pizza that has both spinach and ricotta, especially from one local place, it can end up pretty soggy. That was happily not the case here, the crust was perfect, and again, soooo much flavor! The sandwich was more for the hubby, not really my thing, but I tried a little and was blown away again. Yum! My husband ordered and picked up and said the service was great, everyone was very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Excellent food, awesome atmosphere, cool owner. Very cool establishment and happy to have it in town!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! I have been there 4 times in the past couple week and it does not disappoint.. The pizza is fantastic the ceaser salad wonderful and I have been telling everyone I know to try it out. Every time I go they are busy and I would bet they will been a second location soon . Well done. And congrats on your success.."}
{"text":"I can say this is one of the best pizza places in Irwin. This was my first visit and their staff was over accommodating it was fast, quick, friendly service. The staff went above and beyond and making my kids entertained while we waiting for our pizza. I ordered upon walking in and it only took less than 10 minutes for my order to be complete. The sauce was very authentic to other pizza places in the area. I have to give 5 stars for offering gluten free pizza, the taste was amazing! I had the Billie jean with ricotta, mozzarella, with garlic sauce. It was so tasty! The gluten free pizza was a large 6 cut that I shared with my kids and they had no idea it was gluten free. I will definitely be back. Thank you for our great meal!"}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere, unique pizza and friendly staff. They messed up our pizza but took ownership of it and gave it to for free! Chicken philly pizza was delish and super cheesy. Italian sandwhich was good, crust was a little too toasted but still enjoyable."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here on Labor Day for the first time.  The wait staff was very friendly and attentive.  We ordered a pizza with mushrooms.  It came out more quickly than I expected and was nice and hot.

The pizza was delicious! The sauce tastes really fresh, and the crust is fantastic.  We both loved the cheese, which was gooey and just the right amount.

The only complaint from my husband is that he dislikes pizza shops that use raw mushrooms; he prefers that they be sautéed first.  He also would have liked a bit less sauce.  However, we plan to get this pizza again.  Great place!"}
{"text":"Really good pizza and great service. The staff are very friendly and fun. The pizza is also priced right."}
{"text":"Great food especially the pizza but the sandwiches are fabulous as well as is the burger. The best part are the people. Very friendly, attentive, and respectful! Very welcoming place with great food. ONLY downside is very small but the staff makeup for the cramped space."}
{"text":"So good! Sandwich was huge and a great cut of chicken.  Pizza was fantastic with a nice wood fired taste.  Yummy!!"}
{"text":"Great pizza. Great atmosphere  friendly staff 
Try it. You want be sorry.   You will love it"}
{"text":"Fantastic food.  Great service.  Friendly owners.  My husband and I have eaten here 3 times in the last month since we discovered this restaurant.  We usually get Margarita pizza and Chicken Caesar salad.  Both are fresh and delicious.  The pizza crust is one of the best that we have ever tasted.  Great job guys."}
{"text":"Been coming here since they opened. It's 2 min from my house so I might be biased but it's amazing pizza with all fresh toppings which is a must. No one likes things from a can!  Great staff and consistent product. Everything on the menu has been good. The sauce isn't too acidic like some other places and the crust is the best around!  Perfectly charred. Can't beat the quality in the area."}
{"text":"This was a surprising and unexpected stop on a return trip from a family day out in the nearby area.  

The skinny:
They have a nice menu of pizza and sandwiches that, as a customer, you get to choose with a pencil or pen to correctly select your order and reconfirmed with your server (to avoid any mistakes). 

The non-skinny:
The pizza is really good.  Wood fired, nice crust and a solid selection of toppings and styles make for delicious eats both on the day of ordering or as leftovers the next day.  

3.5 stars rounded up to 4 at this place.  If you're in the area, it's worth the stop if you're in the mood for a good pizza."}
{"text":"Omg, the Philly pizza was the best all 3 of us had ever had and we immediately felt welcome by the cooks! We got 1/2 steak 1/2 chicken philly pizza. They were both great but we all agreed that the steak was better. We also got the 1972. Pretty solid and both cooked to perfection. The philly was the favorite, however! Throw in a 6 pack of BYOB Yuengling and the best server ever, Madison, and you have an all over fabulous experience! So happy we picked this place on our way to N Carolina. The town around it even felt friendly. We are planning on passing back through when we are on our way back."}
{"text":"Stopped in after seeing it had a five star review. Wasn't disappointed. Loved the one price for whatever toppings you wanted. Staff was excellent. If we wander back to Irwin we'll definitely stop back. Hope they continue to do well."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service.  Very cute little spot right off the turnpike.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"A fine discovery! Ate on the patio yesterday and enjoyed the contemporary urban design. We tried the sandwiches. I had \"The Roast\", lots of roast beef in a pizza crust fold with horseradish mayonnaise, lettuce, tomato and onions. Wonderful. My guest had \"The Italian\". A very popular choice. Plenty of good deli sausage, lettuce, tomato and onions. We also enjoyed the peppery potato chips that came with both. Three Italian ladies were at the next table. They ordered a pizza which looked authentic and delicious. One lady actually brought fresh basil from her garden to snip on top! Great idea! We just may have to go back there today to try the pizza. BTW: a large selection of toppings all free! 
Simple, limited menu done very well. The essence of cuisine. Bravo!

Yes, we returned two days later to try the pizza. I  am happy to report it was delicious. We had the \"1972\". The wood fire makes the best crust and the tomato sauce was balanced and nicely accented by the andouille sausage, mushrooms and cheese. One of the owners told us they will open a second location in downtown Greensburg in January 2017. Lucky folks in Greensburg! Oh yes, we'll be back soon with a few friends."}
{"text":"Really good lunch spot! Like that it's byob! Only 4 star though bc we went once on a Sunday and there were out of numerous items like turkey which was upsetting I couldn't get the club. It's my favorite!! Overall though really enjoy this place."}
{"text":"I'm addicted to this place. Can't even think of eating pizza from another local shop. Love the vibe, smell - seriously, and very friendly service. 

It's BYOB which is another huge plus. Order a pizza, pick out whatever toppings you want at no extra charge. It's fantastic and smart. 

Highly recommend the pizza margarita. But you can't go wrong with any choice.

I hesitate to review because I'm afraid it's going to get too popular, but 5 stars is more than well deserved."}
{"text":"Do Wood is a newer place in Irwin with wood fired pizzas, sandwiches and salads and definitely a solid choice if looking for a really good food. The staff was really easy going, friendly and helpful.  The choices for the pizzas and salads are great also, very flexible to customize it how you want.  They also have a very good gluten free pizza."}
{"text":"Great pizzas!  I love that you can get as many toppings as you want on the pizza and it doesn't raise the price!  Their Do'wiches are amazing- it's a sandwich on pizza crust!  Definitely go hungry because you get a ton of food!"}
{"text":"Stopped in off the turnpike for a Philly pizza for lunch. Superb service, wonderful pizza, and a nice experience."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful, wood-fired pizza! Came here on a whim one day to be very pleasantly surprised. Everything from the fun staff to the \"build-your-own\" pizza menu style was incredible and creative."}
{"text":"Ordered pizza for pickup. Ready on time and hot. My wife and I thought it was very good. We will order their pizza again."}
{"text":"We had the Billie jean and it was awesome. Chicken Caesar salad is good as well. And this may sound odd but hey have the best ice ! Great job all around guys"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place!! We have had pizza, sandwiches and salads all 5 star!! And the people who work here are probably the nicest business owners we have come across!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal 
Italian sub is packed 
Pizza is awesome
Great people
Great service 
Great food"}
{"text":"Pizza in this place is delicious !!! 
byob great thing and it's very reasonably priced. 
It's small place simple decor but really great pizza"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I live in Pittsburgh, but we are often in the Irwin/Greensburg area because our families live there. We decided to check this place out after I had seen it on here when I was browsing for something to eat in the area. This place is great! Definitely 5 stars for the area, it's one of the best restaurants in the Westmoreland county area. I often have a hard time finding places that I want to eat at outside the city (mostly chains, etc), but we will definitely come back to this place!

Both my boyfriend and I ordered a dowich. I couldn't make up my mind if I wanted a pizza or sandwich, but since I've never had something like the dowich before I went with that. As others reviews probably explain, they are sandwiches with folded over pizza crust as the bread. (kind of like a pita) I got the club, and my boyfriend got the blacked chicken. My boyfriend is a big blackened chicken fan, and he said this was the best he's ever had. My club was very good as well, super filling, I took almost half of it home. (it actually reheats well in the oven as well). The employees were super friendly as well and they have some outdoor patio seating. We will definitely be back to try the pizzas, what a great addition to Irwin! I could see the dowiches working very well in a food truck as well, if they ever would decide to branch out into something like that."}
{"text":"Amazing! Owned by a great family, and it is a great atmosphere for locals to have amazing food and relax. Not to mention the pizza is phenomenal!!"}
{"text":"First time there today.   Gotta give 5 stars !!  A must for anyone who wants to get an awesome wood fired pizza at a great price... One price for as many toppings you want. Same for the salad !!!  We WILL be back!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Cannot wait till they come to Greensburg. Thin crust, delicious sauce and too many toppings to list. Small place, very casual and close seating but super friendly employees that make you feel at home. BYOB!! Highly recommend"}
{"text":"We got the the Italian with recommendations from our server and the DCBC pizza. It was rally good. Awesome customer service."}
{"text":"Legit wood-fired pizza place with unique and flavorful pizza choices. Love the atmosphere.... Reclaimed wood meets industrial type of atmosphere in a small town atmosphere. There's a tv if you need to keep on top of what's going on with the sports scene, and an outdoor seating area for balmy Irwin evenings. Love the fact that they're BYOB. There's a reason for a line that reaches out of their doors and down the street... Eat local!"}
{"text":"Pizza as it should be!  I have eaten pizza in almost every state of the Union and have found none that come close to Do's. This is the perfect pie. The DoWich is great as well."}
{"text":"Had meetings in the area and had to grab a quick lunch for my colleagues. I found this spot on yelp and called to place an order of 6 large pizzas. They had my order ready in under 20 minutes and the staff there was more than inviting. I met the owner and he offered me a drink for free while I waited. He couldn't have been a nicer guy. Although I'm not in the area often I would highly suggest this place for quality pizza and amazing service."}
{"text":"One of my biggest pet peeves is a restaurant that has too many menu items because, honestly, we all know you can't be good at making everything. Which is why Do Wood Fired works so well - they have a small menu that consists of pizza, salads, and sandwiches. That's it and it's a perfect concept. 

My husband and I had lunch here today - we both got a do-wich, which is a sandwich, sort of. It was explained to us that a do-wich is an 8 inch pizza dough filled with the toppings of your choice, then folded over in a half circle. Picture a wedgie or open stromboli. Anyway, I ordered the Blackened Chicken - chicken, cheddar cheese, lettuce, tomato and fire mayo. (They were out of cheddar cheese so I substituted provolone.) My husband order the Italian - ham, salami, provolone, lettuce, tomato, roasted peppers and vinaigrette. Since the sandwiches were so big, we decided to each have half. I have to say I liked the Italian better than mine, it was filled more and just had more flavor. 

Pros? There's tons. Our server was friendly and one of the owners came over to talk to us. He was also friendly, asked where we're from, how we liked our lunch, etc. The place is clean and has a cool look - wood walls, chalk board along the bar area. They also use disposal plates and utensils, which I'm assuming helps with overhead. 

The best part is the menu. I already mentioned that it isn't big, which is great, focus of a few things that you do good. Plus, you know produce is always fresh. But the very best part is this - no charge for toppings, extras, cheese, etc. The menu is a paper one, which you fill out and give to your server (think Burgatory). Anyway, for example, all salads are $9.90. You choose what vegetables you want (mushrooms, banana peppers, olives), cheese (feta, blue, cheddar), meats (pepperoni, ham, chicken, steak, anchovies), and dressing (ranch, casesar, balsamic) and it's the same price, regardless of how many things you want. So you're not paying a buck for cheese, $3 for a second meat, or what have you...which always makes me feel like I\"m being ripped off, ya know? Same goes for their pizzas. Ingenious!

I would really give this place 4.5 stars. The concept is great, the menu is smart, and I love seeing small businesses work. Especially in the Irwin area, which is home to so many fast food restaurants and over-priced establishments that may work in the city, but not so much here. My only complaint was my sandwich, which simply either had too much dough or not enough filling. I ended up ripping most of the pizza dough off because it was just too much to try and eat. Regardless, I will definitely be back to try something else!"}
{"text":"Found this place while looking for lunch. Staff was awesome and down to earth. The sandwiches are simple yet delicious and the pizza is good too.  Ask for the \"fat\" sauce I believe he called it. It is very tasty and adds a great flavor to the sandwiches and chips. Definitely a great find and a place we plan on visiting again very soon."}
{"text":"If it were in Pittsburgh, this place would be considered quite good.  That it's in the dining wasteland of the East Suburbs immediately elevates it to \"great\".  Wood-fired pizza, an authentic pizza marguerita, and an excellent crust. 

I think they're still trying to walk the fine line between what some of their customers probably expect (\"Put too much stuff on the pizza\") and what their crust demands (\"keep it a bit dryer so that it doesn't get soggy\") but given what I saw and tasted today I have no doubt they'll continue to zero in on it.  4 stars, and will be back regularly."}
{"text":"It was alright. Nothing too spectacular but worth a try in the area. Staff is very nice. Pizza is just ok."}
{"text":"Delicious food, great atmosphere, will be back and a total gem in Irwin!!! Got The Philly gluten-free pizza with tomatoes and it was superb! Also ordered custom salads which were enormous portions!"}
{"text":"We love this place and head here every 2 weeks at a minimum.  The pizza is fantastic, the burgers are HUGE and delicious with a homemade \"bun\" that makes it truly unique.  Best of all however is the staff....friendly, attentive and did I mention friendly?  They always make us feel welcome."}
{"text":"The score would be -1. The food is good and that is where it ends.While I was waiting for my food (it was takeout) the two men that were making the food  did not wear a hairnet or anything to cover their facial hair from falling into my food. They did not wear any gloves, the whole time they were dealing with the ingredients and everything else in the kitchen they just had several rags that they would wipe their hands off with and toss on the counter. The best part of it all is I was sitting down maybe 10 ft from the register and they were making fun of my name. I don't know about anybody else but, I did not travel from California all the way to Pennsylvania to have someone make fun of my name. The food is good but, I do not pay someone to make fun of me. Would not recommend this place.
     When it comes to running an establishment it would be nice to know that you are respected when you walk in and, when you walk out"}
{"text":"Great pizza and friendly staff! Sandwiches are huge though so they are great for sharing"}
{"text":"Pizza was great. It was cool to see the real wood being used to bake the pizzas.  The price was good since you get unlimited toppings"}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time after a youth basketball game and it was delicious.  Friendly staff greeted us at the door and made us feel welcome.  Ordered two pizzas and they were cooked perfect, not burnt on the bottom.  We'll be back the next time we're in the area."}
{"text":"Love their food! And free BYOB! We usually just do takeout. Their roast beef sandwich is the best! The DCBC pizza is good too."}
{"text":"Literally the best pizza I've ever had and fantastic customer service to boot. Make a pit stop here, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Gathered a group of about 15 friends for a great evening of the best pizza in town along with BYOB. DO WF has a great covered patio which made for a pleasant late summer evening. Anthony was super attentive, too. Love having DO in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in the area! Not overcooked, done just right. The service there is also great."}
{"text":"North Huntingdon is filled with pizza places on every corner. This one is unique because it's the only true wood fired pizza in town. Very good, pizza salads and sandwiches."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout here during a recent overnight stay in town. The menu isn't too extensive -- pizzas, salads, and \"do-whiches\" which are basically sandwiches made with pizza crust bread. The menu shows options of toppings and salad fixings so you can customize your own pizza or salad but also lists \"favorites\" that are pre-set options. 

My husband and I both opted for do-whiches. I had the Veggie that included roasted vegetables with mozzarella and pesto mayo and my husband ordered the Italian. They had me at pesto mayo, so I ended up loving everything about my sandwich. Fresh ingredients and a really tasty combo. Do Wood-Fired was a little far from our hotel so by the time my husband got back from picking it up, the bottom piece of bread had gotten a little soggy and the bread was only warm for a little while, but it was still good, even that way (this is obviously not something they can control -- I'm just noting that even under less than ideal conditions, I still think it was great). They're probably unbeatable as an eat-in item. Fun spin on a sandwich!

As I said, we ordered takeout so I can't speak too much to the service, but the woman I spoke with on the phone was polite and efficient and our order was ready on time.

We'll be passing back through again soon and I can't wait for another do-which!"}
