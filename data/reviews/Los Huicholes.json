{"text":"This place is amazing I fell in love with the Gordon burrito this is my first time coming to Vegas and I wanted something good I saw it and said why not and the delivery guy was nice and as soon as I took a bite of the burrito I fell in love. It's amazing and I would recommend it to anyone and plus it's not an average burrito. It's a huge burrito and it's amazing especially the horchata. I would definitely order this again over and over."}
{"text":"We ordered a mini feast for delivery to try a few different things. The delivery came early and was piping hot. Everything was delicious, and we can't wait to try some different items. The crunchy chicken tacos were excellent. Their tacos have the lightest crispiest shell I have ever had. The enchiladas came in a nice red sauce that was savory not spicy. Give them a try."}
{"text":"All around AMAZING. Just got my food at almost 9pm on a Friday night when I know they're busy.... in 20 minutes.  Driver was clean, presentable, professional.  Food presentation on arrival was beautiful, and tastes even better than it looks. When I called to order, the lady took my order fast and efficient.  They don't take credit cards over the fone,  but that's a minor inconvenience for the awesome customer service, speedy delivery,  and delicious food..."}
{"text":"The food is very good and reasonably priced. It was a little difficult to find but worth the trouble.  It was very clean and airconditioned, which is important to me. The staff was very friendly and helpful.  It also didn't hurt that the guy at the register, Paul, was really cute.    Overall, I say this place is a must try."}
{"text":"Los Huicholes catered a bday party That my cousin Lakisha had at my house and I was super impressed with the service. The food was delicious, and it was enough for everyone to go around twice. The price was great, they delivered... I was all around impressed... So much that I'm gonna have them cater my engagement party!!!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I live right by this place. We took a while to try it out but we are glad we did. Their burritos are really good and come with a small bag of chips. I would recommend giving it a try"}
{"text":"First off, it's really awesome this place delivers and I appreciate that. Secondly, the woman who answered the phone was very polite and helpful. I ordered a shrimp burrito, & and a side of French fries. The French fries were seasoned perfectly and were very crispy. The burrito was just a mess. First off, the burrito had so much onion it was nearly impossible to pick it all off. Secondly, the burrito barely had any flavor all I could mildly taste was \"salsa el pato\" (that red sauce people use for cooking). Every bite of the burrito consisted of onion, cheese, some sauce, & a random piece of green bell pepper. Very disappointing experience with the burrito overall. Would I consider ordering from here again? Yes, but never a burrito."}
{"text":"Shredded beef chimichanga. What a joke. I appreciated paying $8 for a fried tortilla filled with beans."}
{"text":"Food is average - if that. I place orders via EAT24, and delivery time is NEVER what is quoted. Today it's been one hour and 45 minutes and STILL no food. Despite EAT24 telling me it's on the way. Called the restaurant and can't get an answer. I've placed a few orders with this place and today's is going to be the LAST. Their food is definitely NOT worth a 2 freaking hour wait."}
{"text":"Excellent food, every time I order. Hot, fresh and so delicious!!! From the huge Taco Salads to the perfectly cooked chimichanga, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I love ordering from here. They are so close to home and the food is amazing. They delivery is always on time and the drivers are very nice. Will continue to order!"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE: I ordered a steak super burrito wit guacamole, sour cream & lettuce & when I got home there was no meat in it. I called the place back to let them know & see if they might be able to make me a new one or do anything, give a free one next time, anything at all & the guy said, \"I put meat in it I don't know what to tell you.\" Rudest person I've ever dealt with in a restaurant in Vegas. You don't treat customers like they're lying to you."}
{"text":"Love this place and would have given them 4 stars if I wasn't a little disappointed this time and the time before when I got delivery orders. Their food is usually really good and I feel well worth what they charge. Even though I live just a few blocks from the restaurant, for the first time in about two years, my food arrived cold. I had to put my cheese enchilada combo in the microwave before I could eat it. The raspberry tea which I always order was too sweet this time. My hard tacos were ok, but the pico de gallo (that I paid extra for) didn't look fresh. I paid 75¢ for about 2-3 tbs of guacamole. I think it should be free for that size. The first few times I ordered from Los Huicholes (sp?) I would have definitely given them 5 stars, but I'm disappointed now because as their fame and followers have increased (prices too), the quality consistency has decreased."}
{"text":"Lord I pray you deliver me from this mexican food addiction as I know it's unhealthy and I have a deep freezer full of food!!!   So to much disappointment they didn't habe any shredded beef or barbacoa available and she said it would be 3 more hours. That's the only reason I took one star away. So I settled for a carne asada wet burrito in red sauce and a couple pastor tacos.  The lady who always helps me reminds me of the mexican grandmother in the in the neighborhood who used to feed us all. She's beautiful, sweet, always has a smile, and makes me feel right at home. The place is always clean and even behind the counter where they cool is always clean.   I will continue to patron this business on great service alone and then comes the great food!!!"}
{"text":"great Mexican food that delivers? what more can a single lady ask for?? I love it! as a matter of fact, I'm lovin it right now!"}
{"text":"Food was alright flavor wise. Tasted like your average Mexican food (I got the Gordo burrito their signature dish) but tasted good. However I ordered a grilled chicken burrito and half of it was shredded and the other half was grilled. And the guy at the counter was less than excited to be working."}
{"text":"I got the Gordo's burrito, and wow it was huge! 3 meals total. Fresh, hot, meat, rice, beans, cheese, and a bunch of stuff. And, the salsa is good too! Great prices. Highly recommend thank you"}
{"text":"Ordered some food through postmates. Everything was good like always with the exception of one of my items. I ordered potato soup not sure what happened or if this is the way its made here. I got a very small cup of watery soup not thick at all!!!"}
{"text":"Their big burrito is ... BIGGGGGG. Big enough for two people. I have tried many places in the bay, LA and Vegas. The burrito here is def worth a taste. Also for now there's a free drink offer for checking in."}
{"text":"I have been here a handful of times and every time, they mess up my order or it takes longer than it should. I don't understand how it takes so long to make an order of fries. It's a disappointment because their food isn't bad but their service is."}
{"text":"Great food. Awesome asada fries and their Gordo burrito is huge and tasty. Great place to grub on when you're lit. And don't wanna drive."}
{"text":"Excellent food from both the Mexican and American food menus! Fantastic french fries - very crisp. Good size portions."}
{"text":"I ordered a veggie Chimichanga, it's all rice. Very little veggies or black beans. :(   I gave it two stars bc the chips are pretty tasty, but it doesn't equal dinner, so it's all around a big bummer."}
{"text":"My first experience with this place was through Eat24. The delivery time was pretty close to what they quoted me. It was about a 45-60 min wait, I believe. It was so worth the wait. The food was amazing. This is my go-to for Mexican food.   My favorite thing to get is the Super Nachos with marinated pork. It's so delicious and the portion is pretty big.   I've recently been to the actual location as well. It's a small place and very \"hole in the wall\" feel.   Now that I live out of state, I visit this place whenever I'm back in town visiting family. It's just that good."}
{"text":"AMAZING Great food and great service. Good delivery time, food was hot and fresh."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. They deliver, and it is authentic as well as delicious. I order food from here frequently. The tacos are spot on (usually get lengua), burritos are fantastic, and the enchiladas are some of the best I have had outside of Mexico. This place is ran well, consistent, spotless inside, excellent food. You can tell that they care, and the staff and delivery drivers are never in a bad mood. A++ to this place, I shall return."}
{"text":"What  can I said one of the best places to eat real mexican food at the best prices in town also get catering and great customer service"}
{"text":"I ordered food from this restaurant on 10/21/2016 around 8.30 pm, they sent me expensive food with cheap quality, a Philly Cheese Steak Sandwich with invisible cheese, a MINI Tres Leches desert of 1 1/2 inch in size that smelled bad, I complaint through Eat24 customer service which is linked (I think) to Yelp for food deliveries, I was told that they called the restaurant and someone named Paul did not want to discount the order, I was not looking for discounts or credits of any kind, I just wanted them and Eat24/Yelp customers to be aware that due to the quality of their food I am not going to order from this restaurant never again and that maybe other customers have had a similar experience, I order food 4-5 times a week, they lost a possible regular customer. Their menu items are not cheap, a Philly goes for almost 10.00, minuscule deserts for 3.99, delivery charge is 4.00 dollars and I normally add a 20% tip on top of that, the saddest part is that I hate to throw away food but I had to."}
{"text":"Great food, premium quality. To be honest I was looking forward to some trashy Roberto's hangover Mexican food, but was pleasantly surprised with Los Huicholes."}
{"text":"I placed an order with eat24. When my food arrived, my taco shells we soggy and the food was cold. I ended up throwing it away and went to get another meal. I contacted eat24 which contacted the restaurant. I was advised by eat24 the restaurant stated because I did not contact them , I would receive a discount for the meal and not a full refund. I advised eat24 I will never order from the company again as I was unable to eat the food. I am highly disappointed with the restaurant that they would serve cold and soggy food."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food delivered ever.  Seriously, its the bomb. However, I think 2.50 is pricy for extra salsa, and wish it had come with some flour tortillas. But still, the best tasting, freshest Mexican I have ever had delivered. Definitely saving to favs."}
{"text":"Authentic, good, Mexican food. I order from here on postmates all the time.  The smothered burrito and beef chimichanga are my favorite.   I wish they would give a little more salsa I always ask for extra salsa because I can't eat Mexico's without an adequate amount of salsa and jalepenos."}
{"text":"Never been to the actual restaurant, but I've ordered delivery a few times.  They're food is FRESH and DELICIOUS. Looooveeeee it!  I normally order from their American menu lol I got the Steak & Eggs Breakfast once and the steak was a big fat piece that was soooooo soft and juicy! The eggs were made to order. I only wish they gave a little more of the seasoned potatoes.   The chimichanga is huge.  I think the best thing about this restaurant is that the food tastes like it would if you were at a friends house and his Grandma just invited you in for breakfast, lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"I got a torta de al pastor and it had no flavor. The ssalsa was to watery and had no flavor either. My husband said  that his food was okay. so that's why I'm giving it 2 stars. Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"3/17/16 Delivery, 1 hour, Hubby had Caribbean Salad and scarfed it down. I had the mini tortas and fries. Asked for extra crispy, and they were still crispy when they got to my house! Next time I will ask for no salt,  I have a low tolerance dont like the taste. But the mini tortas were great! I normally dont like lunch meat,I think it was because of the avacado, due to salt. But these were well balanced and loved the bread.  Had 1 ham and 1 turkey. Would order again.  First try...Yelp says they deliver.....placed my order online, and 2 minutes later the Eat24 people were calling me to say they do NOT deliver. Maybe cuz it is Saturday???"}
{"text":"The shrimp tacos are amazing!! The delivery only 30 mins usually and the drivers are always friendly! I asked for a few extra sauces and I got about 6 of them! Don't forget to try the chicken enchiladas as well. Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"The taquitos were good and the guacamole was awesome!  However, the chips and salsa was not great...the chips had a funny taste to them and the salsa was watery tomatoes: not extremely appetizing."}
{"text":"This is really good, authentic Mexican food. My favorite is the barbacoa plate. All of their dishes are consistently well-prepared and perfectly seasoned.  Everything I've tried has been delicious. Servings are generous. Their guacamole is excellent!"}
{"text":"I am happy with my order from this place. Generous portions and great service. Awesome food, to boot. Definitely eating here again."}
{"text":"They always have good food with variety and great customer service. I've ordered during the day and in the middle of the night and its always consistent, with proportion, and the taste.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I love this place. I've never been to the actual restaurant, but I order delivery through them.  I typically order their taco salad, chimichangas, wings and fries or super nachos.  On the weekend where I'm feeling very lazy, this is my \"go to\" place to order from.  The food is always consistent and the flavor - so comforting.  This may be he first time I'm checking for this restaurant but it isn't the first time I've ordered.  If your in the mood for some Mexican fare, you may want to consider ordered or eating thier restaurant.  They also serve American food like burgers and such (I'm a huge burger fan) but, it's the Mexican food that I am drawn too.  Delivery can be as soon as 30 minutes to an hour, but it is so well satisfying!  Enjoy your food and hopefully you experience what I do!  :)"}
{"text":"Once upon a time, Roberto's and its clones were the only places in town to get restaurant quality mexican food with fast-food convenience.  Slowly, other mom and pops proliferated and food trucks began popping up all over town.  But it can be difficult to know at a glance as you drive by whether these places are serving slop or not.  Rest assured, Los Huicholes is a cut above all of them.  Everything I've tried here has been high quality, from the various meats and wonderful seasoning to something as simple as a side salad that looks like it was prepped by a chef.  Nothing ever seems overcooked, old, or derived from poor quality ingredients.  In fact, their sopes seem to be homemade, not store bought.  And the little breads that come as a side are as tasty as a fresh bakery product.  The only thing I've been disappointed with has been their hard shell taco - it's smallish, not fried, and they skimp on the cheese.  Otherwise, everything here - including the staples of beans and rice - taste better than  any other similar mexican restaurant I've tried in town.  Try it!  I think you'll be impressed."}
{"text":"Love their house salad with grilled chicken and extra everything and the bread!! Must try and get it with chipotle ranch dressing and ask for extra Love this place !! I always order through doordash but one day I will come in the restaurant . Getting ready to order now"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Super authentic and tasty. The restaurant is clean and well maintained. I definitely recommend their tacos and huaraches! Every meat they have is full of flavor and juicy. I haven't tried their American menu but I love the fact they have so much options."}
{"text":"all I ordered was a bean and cheese burrito, cheese quesadilla, and 3 rolled tacos. and hour and twenty minutes later still no food. a coworker ordered as well at the same time and had his food in 25 minutes. I called to see what was going on and my food still had not left for delivery. I tried explaining and the person on the other end called me a lair. I will never order from them again amazingly bad experience!!"}
{"text":"AWESOME PLACE!! they have great food great prices and wonderful customer service I have ordered a couple times from them and I am very pleased the food is delivered hot and fast. I ordered tonight online at Eat24 and it was late so the delivery date defaulted for tomorrow, they called me to confirm if that was correct when I told them no I its for tonight, they said no problem and they still deliver to me after their closing time. What great people and the delivery guy had a smile on his face. I have found a new place to eat with a big variety & super yumny food. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"The food is good but not the best food there is.  I had ordered for delivery.  I was told it would be about 30 min.  An hour after I had ordered my food I decided to call to find out what was going on since it was taking longer than told.  The guy that answered the phone said that they had gotten busy...  Ok, they did have my cell phone number so they could have called me!!!  About 20 min later the food came. Once the food was being delivered, the delivery guy kept calling me to ask where I lived because he couldn't find my home.   I had to go outside to basically wave him over.  Sorry,  I will not be getting food from here anytime soon :("}
{"text":"Fantastic food! Everything was fresh and delicious. I had the torta cubana.  Yummy! It was so good and big! Highly recommend this place! The employees are also very nice and down to earth.  Bring cash because sometimes the credit card machine is down."}
{"text":"I had lunch today and it was delicious.  I had the tacos al pastor and a soda.  It came with a few chips topped with refried beans and they were awesome!!!  The meat was perfectly seasoned and the tortillas were not overly greasy.  The meal was perfect and hit the spot.  I definitely recommend those who want good food at a great price to swing by this place and try it out.  I will be back."}
{"text":"This is a small unpretentious hole in the wall restaurant with wonderful food. I have lived in the downtown area for several decades and have seen places similar to this pop up and then fade away. I hope that it will establish enough of a following to last, so encourage anyone living or working in the area to give it a try. Expect moderate portions of well-prepared food always made with fresh high quality ingredients. We have ordered take-out online almost a dozen times, and never been disappointed. It is notable that the vegetarian items are exactly that; flavorful beans are made with canola oil NOT lard. Cheese is used with appropriate moderation. I  recommend enchiladas with either the red or house creamy green sauce, nachos, tostada salad, taquitos,etc. and anything with guacamole. It is an ultra-fresh chunky mildly seasoned with the usual tomato,onion and cilantro, never too salty, dollop of goodness. I have reservations about recommending the chile relleno, as it is far from the traditional expectation. It is strips of green chile and cheese in an eggy crepe-like rectangle drizzled with the house creamy green sauce. We jokingly call it the green chile cheese omelet, but like it well enough order the relleno/enchilada combo often. The large menu also offers a lot of American sandwiches, burgers, chicken, salads. Something for everyone!"}
{"text":"Great customer service, it was my To-go food order for edc weekend, time and delivery was excellent & their food was amazing! Try the Hawaiian burger, it's to die for"}
{"text":"My husband and I always get delivery from here. They've never been late and the food is always fresh and hot and tastes amazing. My favorite is the chicken burrito with the green sauce. My husband gets something different every time and has been impressed every time. I'm so glad that I found a great Mexican restaurant that delivers!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  The food is always delicious and incredibly fresh.  Their chili rellenos are have a unique twist that really made them stand out for me.  The horchata is home made and very good.  Actually, everything appears to be home made right there when you order.  The service is always great, and the other reviewer was right - Paul (the guy at the counter) is really cute and very nice!"}
{"text":"Perfect! I ordered the house special burrito! Holy guacamole! ...delicious! I was shocked at how delicious it WAS! It was the largest burrito ever and so autentico! Bravo!  Delivery was prompt and friendly! I'll order again any time and be thrilled to recommend this place!   ps. I'm raised in the restaurant business and I know the difference!   pps. Every time I order from these people,,this just keeps getting better! Incredible food!"}
{"text":"We Eat24 this place for lunch 2-3 days a week in our office. Their burritos have that authentic taste, not too greasy, and huge. My favorites on the menu are the breakfast burrito (served all day!), asada fries, and taquitos combo (rolled tacos). Their guacamole is really good, definitely fresh. Their horchata is also spot on.   Service is amazing. So fast and very friendly."}
{"text":"On my way to meeting at office nearby looking for good food and saw this place.  Decided this looked good.  I was right.  Good food anand plenty of it.  Well presented like a sir down restaurant."}
{"text":"Order once for delivery and once for pickup through the yelp app easily. I was pleased with my hard shell chicken taco and carne Asada. Go out and try this place when u get a chance!"}
{"text":"This was my first time ordering from them for delivery and I am pleasantly surprised. The food was amazing and the delivery was prompt. I ordered the Asada Fries and the huge Gordo burrito. My family loved both and we have had our share of asada fries and burritos. We will certainly order again... And again."}
{"text":"small local mexican food place in Las Vegas. the rice and beans taste homemade not canned or frozen. the taquitos with shredded beef topped with cheese, lettuce, tomato, sour cream, and guacamole was delicious. you get 3 taquitos on the plate. it was 6.99. huevos rancheros were good too. the cashier is nice and the place was clean."}
{"text":"I order from here all the time. Addicted to the soft tacos! Have tried burritos, taco salads, nachos... everything is delicious. My favorite place for work lunch.   Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The chilaquiles were the bomb ! The guy who took my order was very.  My food was fresh and hot"}
{"text":"This place has some of the best mini tortas on the east side of Vegas.   I had the pork tortas which had pork, jalapeño, chipotle mayo, lettuce, & cheese.  Their bread is soft and lightly toasted which made it all the more better.  My friend also had the bacon wrapped hotdog which was also really good as well but I personally think there are other places that have better loaded dogs.   The inside of the restaurant was a little dirty, especially the bathroom."}
{"text":"Los huicholes is a Mexican restaurant just off of the strip, now I've only had it through delivery so in the future I will check out the location so you know what you're getting yourself into. The rating is 4.5/5 which I think is a pretty fair score. Now we're gonna dive right into the food. The Gordo Burrito is their signature burrito, weighs 2.5 pounds and comes with chicken, rice, carnitas, cheese, tomatoes, guacamole and sour cream. Topped with a delicious red sauce, smothered with cheese and It's amazing. I also ordered the asada steak fries and wow do they load those suckers down. They weighed a hefty weight on their own and well worth the price of $8. It had beans, cheese, juicy steak, sour cream and pico de gallo. You need to go here it's amazingly delicious and if you don't go you will seriously regret it. Love, Bug"}
{"text":"Great food at a great price. Love the 95 cent tacos. Good environment, overall very pleased."}
{"text":"Bomb.com food....  I order delivery at least once a week if not more:) And the Delivery guy was friendly and always fast"}
{"text":"Holy guacamole! This place is good AF!!! Went in to grab a burrito and decided to try the signature burrito, and I defenitly was not disappointed!!! I almost thought I couldn't finish it but pushed through it and killed it, still haven't met a dish I couldn't finish that is great but this one is defenitly at the top of my list as \"almost had me\" lol. Defenitly coming back again and defenitly recommending this to any and everybody!!!"}
{"text":"Great for breakfast, affordable great deals, they also deliver. I order breakfast for the whole office all the time and it's always cooked fresh."}
{"text":"Very authentic food... very friendly staff. Love their green avocado salsa. Great price. I'll be coming here again :)"}
{"text":"First I have to say Im from San Diego, CA sooo a california burrito is something very familiar to me, haha. Ordered one here (via postmates) and while it was really tasty it was definitely NOT a cali burrito. Good effort tho! I'll for sure order more food and try other items. Delivery was fast and food was nice and hot!  Update 4/8. Tried a carne asada burrito and it seems they like to use a lot of filler. Rice and beans do not belong in a carne asada burrito! Not much meat so that's a little disappointing. Good flavor and quick service tho...  Update 5/1 Ordered sheddred beef tacos....all shell, hardly ANY meat and some lettuce. Pretty disappointed actually. Rice and beans were totally bland. Think this is the last time I'll order from here. Ah well."}
{"text":"Fresh and delicious. I order steak and eggs. The eggs are home made style. My steak was delicious also .Excellent customer service  too. Don't forget to order chips with salsa. It's so good. Ask Magda for some Huicholes sauce too.  They told me they have someone that delivers food too. I told them that Uber eats and all those places overcharge, they told I can just call restaurant and they have their own driver. That's awesome"}
{"text":"Placed my order at 724pm.. Got a phone call at 804pm from the restaurant letting me know that they ran out of Chile Rellenos. 40 minutes after placing my order they call to tell me they are out of the main thing I placed my order for. When I told him that was the reason I ordered he said oh yeah I know they are really good... Well I wouldn't know would I, because you ran out and waited 40 minutes to let me know. I'm still waiting for my food, but really upset. Unless the food is through the roof amazing, I don't think I'll order from here again!"}
{"text":"Great cheap Mexican food! Love it and they deliver. I feel like their food is really fresh and I really can't say anything bad about this place! The meat is always moist and tender and the veggies are fresh!"}
{"text":"97cent tacos and had carne asada Nachos ... Very pleased with food will be back to try rest of menu items"}
{"text":"I ordered delivery today for lunch, as I wasn't getting out of the office before quitting time.   I ordered the Asada fries. $9 isn't too shabby for a messy pile of yumminess so I went with it. Plus a $3 delivery charge. Plus a tip. I gave specific instructions on how to get into the building, and where to meet me. I paid before my food was delivered with a card - first mistake.   The delivery man called me - as requested - stating he was at my location. I looked for him on my floor. Nothing. Then he told me \"oh, I'm in the lobby - I won't come up to your floor - I'm too busy.\" Ummmm... Ok? I gave a hefty tip for you to BRING ME the food I ordered. Nearly 100% of my tab!   So I go to the lobby to pick up my own food. The delivery man said he was busy, and didn't want to go through the scanners. Ok. At least TELL someone that beforehand. Customer service. You know, making sure the customer is happy? Apparently customer service must be dead... Right along with chivalry.  Get back to my office, and my order is wrong - I received nachos, not Asada fries. *sigh*   On the plus side, the food was decent. So 1 star for shoddy service, and a +1 for good food. That's all I can give, here."}
{"text":"Took 1.5 hrs to deliver 2 sides of guacamole And wings.   DUDE. It's guacamole, you don't even have to cook it.  Wings were over salted and guacamole Had no zest or salt, although it was real fresh avocado. But I guess I can buy an avocado for $1 and cut it up, instead of paying $5 for half of it.   Overall, not sure it was worth the wait OR the money."}
{"text":"We had family in town over New Years weekend and ordered from here 3 times because my family loved them so much. We ordered the scrambled eggs and protein breakfasts twice and a bunch of mini pork tortas for lunch once. Our orders were large orders and everything came exactly as we ordered it. I would highly recommend the mini pork tortas to anyone. They were the biggest hit. We had everything delivered and the delivery fee was only $3. The delivery guy was so friendly as well. You've got to try this place."}
{"text":"Just had lunch delivered. Absolutely delicious. Very fresh. Salsa is hot, hot, hot and tastes so good you don't mind the burn. They should bottle and sell it, it is that good. Will definitely be ordering from them again."}
{"text":"First time here, and it was really good... had the soft tacos for $1.50 and they were great! for the price, also the meats and salsas do taste fresh, very traditional..... the restaurant was clean, and ordinary."}
{"text":"There was a little 'oops' with the order (it was split in two) and the person on the phone spoke very little English to help.  The food was very good. Nice sized portions. Good flavor and delivered in their proper container (meaning it wasn't all spilled out every where)  Will definitely use them again!"}
