Did not try the breakfast yet but I will soon.
Don't forget to have an espresso at the end of the meal :)"}
{"text":"Your classic Italian Hot Table restaurant in the concord area. This recently opened place serves the classic fair from breakfast and sandwiches to hot meals and coffee. 

While the format is nothing new it is a great addition to the area.  For the past few years eating in the concord industrial park there was limited options that you could choose from.  While there is one of these in every corner in Woodbridge there are only a few in Concord. 

I had a single meal plate if pasta, chicken and some veg on the side. While it set me back around $14 it was very filling and I was greeted by some really nice ladies behind the counter.  Breakfast with eggs, meat, bread and coffee is around $7. 

The place has a very cool ambiance and can be used to host some cool events. 

The menu is limited and rightfully so. Keeping in mind that you want your food fresh you don't want to over complicate things with a large menu. 

The food itself is very homemade style for what I tried. Not overly complicated and or overly seasoned. 

Finally a great Italian Hot plate for lunch has arrived to the area."}
