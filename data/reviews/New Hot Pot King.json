{"text":"Hotpot place is good,the price is not the most expensive, fresh ingredients. Six people go, birthday is free, the boss gave the seafood platter for the birthday boy or girl. See other comments on the tip problem, a lot of all u can eat place is 10-12% service charged,and bill are illustrated, the waiter also said! Good service, often to help us removed soup bubble, tipping is worth! Compared to other hot pot place service much better. Spicy soup base is amazing!"}
{"text":"Got there around 8pm, and there was 2 tables with 4 customers in total. $22.99 for Friday dinner though on their menu, they've pointed out it's $20.99 for Beef/Lamb hot pot.. so beware without any surprise at the end when they present you the bill. Also they take only cash payment so no debit/credit card machine they'll provide. If you don't bring a whole lot of cash then there's ATM in the bowling area, which will charge $2.50 fee..Choice of hot pot items was mediocre, and limited, and the sauce counter were mostly bottles bought from the store-counter. They charge 50 cents per (small) eggs.. Service was just standard, and including 10% service tip to the bill felt unjustified.. Overall I would not come here again as there are other better hot pot restaurants in Markham.. This hot pot joint used to be one of favourites a while back, and I figured I give it another chance, but that chance was wasted."}
{"text":"Very poor customer service, I know the price is cheap but I was standing there for half hour with no waiter approach! They don't even give u a number so everyone can wait IN ORDER!  After we got the seats, u have to sit there for another 15min with no water no menu.  For real !?"}
{"text":"At $12.99, this is as cheap as it's going to get for AYCE hot pot. But as you can guess, the quality of the food is not the best. If you're looking for the best value for hot pot, this is definitely THE place to go. If you want higher quality food, go somewhere else. Don't get me wrong, the food is edible and very delicious. Each person gets 1 free plum drink.   The Menu: Fatty beef defines a typical hot pot experience. They also have chicken, pork and lamb for meats. They have various dumplings, vegetables, tofu, and noodles. The menu selection is pretty standard.   The Place/set up: I actually like the flexibility of making my own soup base. This way, I can't blame the restaurant for poor seasoning and it saves the restaurant time. Most importantly, I can make the soup as strong/mild as I want. Don't worry, they have recipes if you don't know what to use.   The Food: This is where I can start to list some flaws with certain items, though most of them were decent. The beef is not as fatty as I'd like. But it's still delicious. The chicken was fine. Didn't get pork or lamb. The various balls (fish, squid, beef) were fine. I really liked the home made squid balls.   The biggest problem was with the dumplings. The so called shrimp dumpling was stuffed with a lot of ground pork. I understand shrimp is more expensive and you can save $$$ this way, but that doesn't explain why the chive dumpling also had pork inside. I thought chive is cheaper?   The fried fritter was terrible. It was fried maybe 2-3 hours ago. It was hard. Not edible.  There were only 2 of us and they serving of vegetables was too much. They used a basket and filled it up.   Overall:  Like most Chinese places, don't expect much in terms of service. They also screwed up our order once by adding rice cake to our order of udon. But at such a good price, all these can be overlooked. Just don't overlook your bill because they include gratuity in the bill. Recommended if you want value."}
{"text":"Date Night might include a few rounds of Bowling then Dinner but not at this Old Kennedy Road destination.  Bring your low-expectation Hungry Friend of yours and you've got yourself a feast of Hot Pot.  Don't expect Tables to be 100% clean nor the Washrooms.  Fun to see your Friend try to suck their Gut in when it's basically ready to bust a pant button and fly like a bullet towards me.  That's NOT the only hazard here as they have notes on the wall with warnings, such as Vegetables are washed but please carefully inspect prior to consumption.  Much like the Bowling Alley, New Hot Pot King has that dated decor and mix-match setting while the Hot Pot Soup Bases and Sauces are fully self-serve which can be Good or Bad depending on your preference and knowledge of complimenting flavours rather than contrast.  2.5 *Star*  Seafood & Beef AYCE Hot Pot($17.95) - This is quite a VALUE if you can overlook the decor/cleaniness like myself.  First off, the Soup Base, Unlimited OYSTERS, Unlimited Snow Crab Legs, Misc Seafoods, and Misc Drinks are included into the price already.  I was having a Red Bean Ice Drink with Mango Ice Cream, Sour Plum Drink as my Friend had Grass Jelly Ice Drink with Ice Cream.  They have Handmade Fish Balls/Beef Balls/Pork Balls as well which I personally prefer and appreciate.  Yes, the Sauces/Soup Ingredients that are self-served can get unhygenic and sometimes mixed such as the Scallions in the Wasabi.    Note: Make sure you BOIL the heck out of everything and use the Chinese Mentality.  Big Germs eat Small Germs.  With practice you'll be able to eat smaller and smaller germs and develop a new Antibiotic that all Doctors in this world has been searching for.  That's if you don't DIE first.  Am I right, Gregger??"}
{"text":"It looks like you're in a super sketchy neighbourhood, but if you come here often, you'll know it's safe. This hot pot place is located upstairs and is right beside the bowling alley.  For AYCE, it is really cheap per person. There are two menus: one is the seafood option, being less than $20 (including a greater variety of drinks) and the normal option (less than $15 per person, including a smaller variety of drinks. I think they've been taking out the all you can drink option because last time we went, they costed money. Many people get the sour plum sauce which comes in a jug with cups.  You can choose your own sauce and it is also AYCE as you're able to choose your soup base through the sauce and be able to put eggs, chives, satay, soya sauce, tung yum gong, etc.   I find the dumplings and meatballs most impressive because they look handmade by the restaurant. The menu includes dessert as well. Super cheap food for AYCE!"}
{"text":"This place is upstairs, connected to the bowling alley called Club 300 Bowl. You may get lost trying to find this place because there are 2 ways in. There is an entrance straight from the parking lot that takes you into the bowling alley, and you just walk down the length and arrive at the restaurant or you go into the plaza and up the stairs or elevator. It is just easier to go from the parking lot but it is an unmarked entrance.  When I first came here, it was bubbling with pots everywhere and there were lots of people. Business has died down a bit but I still think that they're food is pretty good. I mean, how can you actually mess up raw food that patrons cook themselves?   Their sauce bar has a wide selection of different sauces as well as other add ons like seaweed, century eggs, raw eggs, different herbs etc. and it is here that you choose what you want in your soup base, whether it be miso or spicy etc.   There is an upgrade for seafood, it's an extra $4 (I think) for one plate of oysters, salmon, shrimp, scallops and various other things. But you only get this one platter, meaning this portion is not all you can eat.   I'm not a picky hot pot person, if you serve udon noodles with beef, I'm pretty much good to go. The udon that they serve here is really good. I think that's why I like coming back here. They do offer the bbq side grill, it's sort of like korean bbq but you also get hot pot at the same time. I rarely ever see anyone take advantage of this option.  They used to have a special with the bowling alley, if you eat at Hot Pot King, and take your receipt, you will get one free soft ice cream cone per person. This used to be the draw and allure of coming here but they have since gotten rid of this option. In its place, they now serve a dessert on the premises. Usually it's a Chinese papaya dessert soup, couldn't tell you the name if my life depended on it but it's pretty good, but not as good as ice cream."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: located in a sketchy neighbourhood, the parking lot looks like it about to collapse.....the restaurant itself is upstairs next to a bowling alley   Food: definitely quantity over quality. They do not stings on sauces, all pots come with plain broth, and from there you make your own soup base and sauce at the counter. There's a choice between beef ayce and seafood. Most if their ingredients are decent, out of 3 plates of beef we got 1 bad one. Does not come with drink, pitchers are 3.99  Overall: debatable if I'll be back, if anything it's because it's so cheap."}
{"text":"This place is an honest business with good prices. The dinner for beef (which includes lamb, chicken, pork, etc) is only $12.99. They don't charge for eggs and you make your own soup, which can include ma la (spicy szechuan) that other places actually charge for as well. The food quality is very good for the price and they aren't cheap on portions when you order. They give you big plates of meat as well when you order it. The service is great and the workers always make you feel at home. No complaints and I must say this is my favourite hot pot place in town."}
{"text":"I love hotpot!  What can I say, I love trying out all the hotpot places around GTA.  The other night we came here with friends to try out since the last time I was here about a year ago.  This restaurant is located upstairs which has elevator access.  You can watch the bowling alley next door while you are eating!  We were quite surprised when they turned off the lights next door only to see them play bowling in the dark!  What makes this place different than the others is that your hotpot is just boiling water and you go and make your own soup base.  Personally I prefer to have it ready made for me as I found the selection of soup base ingredients poor.  I felt it was pretty much the same as the normal dipping sauce ingredients (add Knorr chicken stock and some thai/spicy soup bases and cooking oil).  It was very quiet for a Saturday evening.  The price for all you can eat hotpot was $12.95 which is the best deal if you are looking for cheap hotpot on a weekend evening (most places cost more on weekends).  There was also the seafood option for $17.95 which includes unlimited refills and pop.  The $12.95 price includes only 1 cup of plum juice so we ended up paying an extra $3.99 for a jug of plum juice (they also had extra cups of plum juice for $1 each which we thought wasn't as good).  Overall a great place for cheap hotpot.  But for more selection (quail eggs!) and ready made soup base look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Chinese restaurant owners must be killing each other by pricing \"all you can eat\" dinner so low.  Some of them cheated by having so many limitation, extra charge or charge \"full price\" over left overs on tables.  $12.99 for all you can eat beef dinner, and $17.99 for seafood dinner with all you can eat snow crab legs, oysters, fried fish skins(wow!), as well as salmon too.    There is a self serve \"soup \" stations where one can create one's own soup base.  They have a suggestion of how to make different soup, but I ask the girl manager how to make a good spicy hot base.  We made a perfect spicy hot soup!  There may be some people do not how to make good soup, my suggestion is to ask  the manager to mix it for you!  Food are fresh! The beef are freshly sliced; dumplings are good (I don't like some hot pot restaurants served frozen dumplings from supermarkets or some corner store), and selections are good. Their homemade beef balls, pork balls and the squid balls are excellent, a must eat!  Decor is causal, no additional cost at weekend; only we need to go to the washrooms at bowling alley!"}
{"text":"If you want cheap and quantity over quality then this is the place for you. I came here on a random weekday and it was very empty. You can make your own soup base here which some people may or may not like. I would come here if I was craving hot pot and didn't want to spend a lot of money on it!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars.  Not the best but far from the worst out there.   If a cat has 9 lives.  This restaurant is the equivalently of the feline.   Their menu selection is extensive and price point is A-OK.   You can add seafood to your dinner piece meal but I found no need to.   The soup bases all have extra cost and the pitcher of sour plum tea will also set you back another buck for bottomless.   The sauce selection puts everyone else to shame.  Food is good.  Very extensive.  And never got a  Sorry this is sold out excuse.   The meal also includes desert ( Ice cream or fruit - apples or oranges)  They also open until 4 for those night owls"}
{"text":"Chinese restaurants changed business owners frequently! A change of name without even changing the deco and then a new business!!   New Hot Pot King now replaced the \"Old\" Hot Pot King located at the Club 300 Bowling Alley.   The set up is similar to the previous business but a totally changed of menu structure. There are 2 choices:   Beef All you can eat Hot Pot ($12.95)  -a more limited selections without any seafood  - 1 cup of plum drink  - various veggies and dumplings   Seafood and Beef All you can eat Hot Pot ($17.95)  - unlimited seafood: Oysters, snow crab legs, shrimps, mussels, Salmon etc  - includes everything on the Beef menu  - includes unlimited pop, plum drinks, red bean drink and jello glass drinks   Though I find it is a good concept of mixing and creating your own soup base, I found it doesn't taste as good as the one that the kitchen prepared in other places. I found though there a great selection for dipping sauces, the practice can get really unhygienic.   The food is not bad, but not of the best qualities.   The services though is nice and friendly, all our requests were honoured with a great smile and attitude!   Please note that they includes 10% service charges already, so make sure you don't double tip!"}
{"text":"Typical no frills hot pot. Choices are quite basic. This time our fatty beef was the leanest chewiest beef ever. No fat marbling at all.  Surprisingly the Chicken slices were the best since it was at least tender. Sauces are abundant but missing peanut option. 12.99 for the standard beef option."}
{"text":"Had a fantastic time with my friends here from 7pm to 11:15pm.  Yes that's a long time (though there aren't many people there... so just an FYI for those worried about the 2h limit they put on AYCEs, it is just to allow them to let more customers in if the line is getting long and your party is acting like a douche and just staying there)  Personally I would only get the $12.99 and avoid the seafood altogether.  However, that's just me being cheap.  For those who don't know, hot pot restaurants are generally AYCE, but you cook your own food with the ingredients provided.  It is generally only available at night time or weekends since that is when you'd have the most time to enjoy it rather than a weekday lunch affair.  Normally you'd be here for 2 hours max, but if no one is rushing you like my last event, then just enjoy the relaxing atmosphere.  Hot Pot King uses a more communal bowl unlike iCook Buffet or Rolling Pot so be sure to hang out with people who have the similar tastes than you, although each pot is split into two.  They start out with a base broth (not sure what's inside, but it's not pure water).  Then you have to make your soup base and dipping sauce.  Now that I write this I feel so stupid that I forgot to let my friends know they can try out the soup bases that other people have created to see which one does a better job.  The restaurant does have some instructions on how to do the sauces, but they are vague and if you don't know what you're doing you may put the wrong portions since they don't specify quantity.  Here's what I do, but feel free to experiment.  The worst that could happen is you cannot eat from your pot so just use someone else.  Soup base:  * Chicken broth mix (it's a powder), add a generous heap of it, this adds a salty flavor to your meats otherwise it may taste too bland without it. * Parsley * Green onion * Miso paste  Dipping sauce  * Fried Garlic (1-2 spoonful) * Fried Onion (1-2 spoonful) * Parsley (1-2 spoonful) * Kikoman Sauce (use this to fill up the rest of the bowl, this is the base of the sauce, but do it after the smaller ingredients, I learned this at Vancouver) * Thai Spicy Oil (a little bit for a sweet kick) * Raw Egg (to make the sauce stick to the ingredients, use your discretion, I know some people don't like the idea and it's fine, the sauce just won't stick as much)  They have free ice cream as well.  They have a few faults though: #1 their web site still cites the old expensive price, it's cheaper now $12.99 per person (drinks are not included and no free refills) #2 bathroom for the gents is bad.  However, you can go to the one used by the bowling alley, it's MUCH cleaner now #3 Though they are okay service wise, they tend to lose orders, just follow up with them more often if you don't see the stuff you want (in my case the rib eye beef)"}
