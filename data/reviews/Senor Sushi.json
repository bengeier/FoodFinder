{"text":"I Loved señor sushi! OMG I seriously couldn't believe how good the food is and how much I enjoyed it."}
{"text":"I will start off by saying the food here is good and tasty. Other than that, this place doesn't know what it wants to be. The dj is so unreasonably loud I had to shout just to talk to my gf who was sitting directly in front of me. Next, our waitress sat us at a booth where towards the end of our meal, they decide to drop a screen in front of us blocking us in at our booth! There were plenty of other booths and tables open. Why would you do this! Maybe if the food didn't take so long to come out to us we would have been out of there already. And we never got an apology. There were no Fucks given. Good food, terrible environment. If I wanted a nightclub I would have went to one. But what I got was an inconsiderate sushi restaurant with over bearing music. Way to ruin my meal! No wonder there were so many empty tables."}
{"text":"This place is always so busy but so worth the wait! The Bomba, Cielo Mar Y Tierra & the Carne Asada Roll are to die for  can always anticipate a great meal along with some decent entertainment.."}
{"text":"Fine fine fine. Very good very good very good. Veryveryveryvery goooood.....no duren tanto para tomar orden de bebidas, traer un baso de agua o para traer la comida y les dare 5estrellitas"}
{"text":"Wow. Was out for a quick bite and this place was great! Excellent tasting food, well done and the variety of rolls is great. Also a good place for people who are just getting into Sushi. I am a vary picky person but this place definitely met and I would dare to say, exceeded the expectations."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to purchase the Groupon for this place and give it a try. We are sushi lovers and have tried a bunch of different sushi restaurants. I have to sadly say this was the worst. I used to say that I wouldn't purchase sushi at a store, like Costco but now I have to say I would rather do that than have sushi at Senor Sushi.  First off, the service was not so good. There were people around us getting service left and right and it seemed like we were invisible. Frustrating to say the least.  The sushi itself was flavorless and old. I have to wonder how fresh that fish really was. Having grown up in the bay area and eating some of the best fish you can find anywhere, the fish at Senor Sushi tasted like it had sat there for 4 days before being served. The best part of the dinner was the desert which was actually good. Unfortunately we were both sick within a few minutes of leaving the place and tossed the leftovers out of fear of food poisoning. I'm not sure if this fusion is a good idea or if it was just not executed very well but sushi is surely not a strong point at this place. I might suggest the cooks head around town and try some sushi to get a taste for what it should be. It would also help to have fresh ingredients. You can't serve old sushi and pass it by anyone that knows sushi. Won't be going back to this place."}
{"text":"NEVER going back! Food takes FOREVER to be served. Figure about 30+ minutes from the time you're seated to the time your food arrives at your table. Sushi rolls are a little expensive.  When my wife and I went, we got seated and while we were ordering a party of three was seated next to us. Long story short, after we got done eating ordering desert, eating it and paying (about an hour and 25 minutes) the waitress when to their table to tell them that what they had ordered was out... I was amazed! Not going back. For sure!"}
{"text":"My frist time was good the only thing was to expensive and small portion of food. Where at sushinola you get more food for less money.This is the truth and better service too!"}
{"text":"I give 3 stars because the food was pretty good. This place is somewhat a nightclub with bands at night so when u walk in, it looks like a dark night club with some tables in the middle of the dance floor. The had booths that lined the wall. The table we were sat at looked as if it had dried up soda or beer all over it and was pretty sticky. Yuck! The service was no bueno. We had to ask multiple times for water, silverware, napkins, and BBQ sauce. The server was sweet although she pulled out her cell phone twice and was looking through it and typing/texting while taking our order and while dropping off our drinks. Not very professional. They did not have a kid menu but I did notice they had one on their web page so if U have kids, u will need to look online because the server didn't know what they had for kids. No happy hour menu, although they have one. (Starts at 3pm) the margarita was pretty good. Stay away from the mango martini!!! Tasted like I was sipping on warm thick mango syrup. Ick!  The food was great. I would recommend the firecracker jalapeños and the milena roll, and the cordon bleu roll. Only thing I would have liked to add to my roll next time would be jalapeños. The flavors were good but needed a lil spice. The menu is awesome!! If they could hire attentive and experienced servers, this restaurant could be a gold mine. We will be back but will order to go."}
{"text":"I highly recommend this sushi place, very flavorful. Reasonable price, so worth it. Service is excelent. Recomiendo este lugar, el sushi tiene muchisimo sabor. Los precios rasonables, el sabor lo vale . Te atienden fenomenal."}
{"text":"Extremely bad service, no one checks on you, it's horrible! Even McDonalds says a hello and have a goodnight. Not to mention, the food is mediocre for the price. 0 stars for this place. Don't do it!"}
{"text":"Overall I rate this establishment 3 stars. When we arrived we were greeted right away, we were seated at a table. It took about 2 mins for the server to come to our table to get out drink order, another 6 mins till we received the drinks. She looked a little busy. We decided to come here since we had a Groupon deal. Which included two Sake bombs, two salads or two soups, 2 sushi rolls any kind and a dessert. The server was very knowledgeable about the menu and she checked on us many times to make sure everything was going well. The rolls were great and very big portions. The dessert was also a hit with us fried ice cream with fruit. While we were there they also had live entertainment of a mariachi band. This venue also is a club on certain nights with booths surrounding the restaurant area with a huge bar. The decor was ok, I would go back if I had a Groupon the prices are a little high without it."}
{"text":"Delicious food good selection of beer/drinks great atmosphere. Carne asada roll was perfect. Good Staff"}
{"text":"Yummy in my tummy !! Great service and creative fresh sushi ! Awesome service and beautiful venue !"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place the concept is really cool.  With that said I will never be back, ever!   A friend and I walked in about 15 mintues before 11pm. They stop serving food at 11pm was not really hungry but would have liked some menus just to try something. We sat down, we're not acknowledged until after 11pm so no menus. Actually I had to get up and ask one of the waitresses who would serve us some drinksand she said I dont know who has that table but I will serve you. She did seece us one roundbif beers and 30 mins later I had to get up and ask her for another round of beers so frustrating. Bi asked if she would bring us a drink menu she said they did not have one. When she went to go get our drinks I told my friend let's just go.   We had lots of beer money to spend and instead just ended up paying for one round. Oh forgot when we sat down the table was dirty and sticky, very irritating.   I went on the website to ask the owner via email what time they stopped serving food and did get a reply, he/she stated 11pm. Then I sent him another email lettiing he/she know about our experience and got no reply back.   Too bad for this bad experince will look for other restaurants with same concept and hopefully get better treatment!  Don't waste your time or money here!"}
{"text":"Best sushi I have ever tasted ! I wasnt a big fan of sushi until I went here, I always get the guamuchilito, it is the best sushi there in my opinion. On Friday nights they have live banda de rock or banda playing. I did a birthday dinner here for one of my loved ones and they had a great time ! Try to get there early as it gets packed on weekends !"}
{"text":"I have been there 3 times. The bartender in the day is great and mixes a very good Bloody Mary.  The Poison Ivy roll is very tasty. I was told the eel sauce did not sound good but my friend enjoyed it.   This is a nice place in Casa Grande."}
{"text":"I have eaten here 5 times in the last 3 months and I have to say it is really good. I was a little nervous about trying it because it isn't really the traditional sushi but it is actually really good."}
{"text":"This is easily the worst dining experience I've had in Mesa. Although our server was sweet, she abandoned us after taking our drink order. We watched our drinks sit on the bar for exactly 13 minutes. The manager came over and asked if we had any issues. We told him our drinks were sitting on the bar forever.  He just laughed and walked away. Yes, he laughed and walked away. I ended up going to the bar myself and grabbed the drinks. The bar tender said nothing. When we finally saw our server again she blamed it on the bartender even though we watched him make our drinks and place them on the bar for her to pick up. She actually had the nerve to ask us if we wanted more drinks. And the food...I'm all for a twist on a traditional roll, but If I'm getting something deep fried I expect it to be at least warm when it comes to the table. Nothing was.  Our cold rolls were the same temperature as our fried rolls. Paying the bill was painful. We could have gone to an amazing Mexican restaurant or a good sushi restaurant and spent less for MUCH better food, service, and drinks."}
{"text":"Walked in with a reservation on a Monday evening at around 6 pm. Sat down with the boy. After 10 minutes, had not even been acknowledged- no \" your server will be right with you\" even, but the family that walked in 8 minutes after we did got place settings?! I didn't stay to try the food.  I will not stay at a place where the service is that horrible."}
{"text":"Place is not much to look at, but I don't care much about looks as much as I care about the food.  For those who don't like raw seafood this place has several options for them because here the sushi rolls are fried.  If you are looking to try something new or if you want to eat sushi like they do in Mexico this is the place to come."}
{"text":"First time here. They opened last Friday. We had the firecrackers jalapeños for apps. Then the carne asada rolls to share. The prices aren't bad and the portions are good sizes. Since they're fairly new, we had a nice quite lunch. During the weekend they have a live band and open up the floor for dancing in front of the stage area."}
{"text":"Three of us had dinner at Senor Sushi this afternoon. We ordered 4 different \"sushi rolls\". The food was all fresh and edible, but this is not a sushi place! And order carefully, some of these rolls are baked or deep fried.  The ingredients were a little odd (jalapenos?) and time tested Japanese flavor combinations were largely absent. Service was acceptable, and the restaurant was very clean and pleasant, but if you want good sushi, look elsewhere."}
{"text":"They had not served real Sushi at all for a long time, however, they have very fortunately met one of real Japanese Sushi chefs Mr. Kazato who has more than 4o years experience on TV show this year. Thanks to Kazato's advice, they are changing. I hope they have started serving real Sushi now."}
{"text":"A nice tasty surprise in the West Valley! I think I've found a new fav sushi spot. The first thing I noticed was how clean the restaurant was and friendly staff. The fresh tropical ice tea was just what I needed to start. I picked two rolls with the help of my beautiful waitress, one from the traditional side & a latino roll. I couldn't pronounce them but it didn't matter...the explosion of flavors were enough for me to give this place 2 thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I wouldnt recommend this place at all. The food is not bad, but the service is horrible. The waitress are slow and dont seem to care. Even in slow days they still take for ever to do anything, even refills. We have placed several to go orders because we feel that way we dont have to deal with them, but even on to go orders they still make mistakes. The management should encourage more hospitality on the waitresse's behalf because this place seems to not really care about their customers. Most of the time is packed but there are a lot of aspects to improve."}
{"text":"I went there on a Thursday and the place was set up like a school cafeteria. The soccer game was on and it was really lout and the people there looked intoxicated.  The food was awful."}
{"text":"The service in this restaurant sucks!!!... I went with my husband because his friends recommended it to him and thought we were going to have a lovely experience, but it was the total opposite. When we arrive we were welcome promptly and a waiter directed us to our table. The place looked more like a night club than a restaurant, which was a little weird. Once in there we had to wait about 20 min for a waitress to notice us and after she took our food order it took about 40 minutes for us to get our food. however, all this time that we were waiting i kept looking at the cooks and they seemed to be chatting and goofing around with the front of the house staff. At the end the food was OK but I will never go back!!.."}
{"text":"The food was flavorless. The only flavor was the spicey sauce they drowned the roll in. The shrimp tasted old and over cooked and the seaweed wrappers were chewy. Will never go there again."}
{"text":"nice place mexican style sushi and watching the soccer game"}
{"text":"The calamari tasted old and so did the eel. Old is not a comforting taste when eating sushi...."}
{"text":"Giving them 2 stars because the food is great but for customer service i would give them a negative -5, everytime we go its the same bad service (execpt for one time out of maybe 8). This last time we called in for a to go, we were told it would be done in 25 minutes. We got there on time and still made us wait 20 more minutes! To top it off we had to call about 5 times to get them to answer, and when we got there the lady was standing next to the phone while it rang a good 4 times but she was too busy talking and laughing with another waitress.   If customer service was WAY better this place would be good."}
{"text":"Good food horrible service. Servers took my order and then sat at table and ate for 40 mins. Then when she finally came back with my sushi she was like ohh sorry the cooks lost your ticket? Ummmm okay? If you weren't eating and actually working you would of noticed it was taking longer than usual. No customer service skills at all. Smile people at least smile."}
{"text":"We had a little trouble finding this place at night. They didn't  have a lit up sign! Once we did find it, we went inside and were seated right away in a nice big booth. There was a live DJ playing upbeat Spanish music. It was kind a cool vibe once you got used to it. Staff were courteous. Service is a bit slow, even with many staff standing around chatting. The waitress brought bowls of sauce but never told us what kind of sauce it was. she also didnt recommend any particular items to us. This is a fusion place, so wouldnt you want to push your unique dishes? The menu was a little small and had a lot of cooked rolls, but the food was very good. Actually it was better than good! I could see coming here with friends for an evening out. I saw some drinks pass by that looked delicious. We ordered a Las Vegas roll, a Shrimp Killer, and another spicy roll. Very yummy! Lots of good flavors. It would be nice if you got some soup, salad, or edamame with your order like most sushi places, but not a real big deal. I would just beware that waitstaff seem very inexperienced."}
{"text":"Very nice place to eat. I thought it was casual wear but people were dresses up. My bad. Took a while to get my order. Also didn't get the same server through the whole thing. The last server guy was kind of rushing nus to leave but we were still eating. Food was good."}
{"text":"I ordered the Californian roll and got some weird cucumber thing the restaurant itself is amazing and the staff is too I'm just really mad about my order"}
{"text":"My one and only favorite sushi restaurant! I always order the Guamuchilito! Most popular off the menu. If you or any of your friends are not sure what to order, recommend this! Delicious and satisfying."}
{"text":"First time here and the margaritas are AMAZINGGGG! I would come just for this. I can't remember the name of the roll I got, it was a Mexican roll and it was delicious! The only downside is it is expensive! I paid $30 for 1 roll and 1 margarita and I'm pretty sure there are no rolls on their happy hour menu. But other then that it is really good! Also, the food did take a while and it was pretty dead there was only about 7 tables, but the only reason I didn't mind was because I was on a catch up date with my friend! But if you're in a rush then I don't suggest this place."}
{"text":"If u want a fried burrito roll come here. This is not sushi !!! Service was horrible and the prices were outragous ! 9 sake bomb ??? thats crazy !! Real Sushi places are @ $6 dollars max. I only give 1 star for the TV' s and music. Really stay out from this place if u are a real sushi lover cuz ur not gonna find any real food there."}
{"text":"Meh food was awesome drinks were too! It was very pricey and i tried to be ok with that but we were seated right next to a big table of very rude people with equally rude children that thought chopsticks were drumsticks and swords. I was attemping to justify our over 50.00 tab with \"its a good date for me n mine\" but shit these little ignorants and the big ignorants with them ignoring them ruined it all.. perhaps if we were in a booth? regardless its champange dining in a school cafateria.. have fun with that one!"}
{"text":"I can't rate this place! Service was horrible waited forever to get a bottle and what they charged was unreasonable. 270 for just the bottle and 32 if you wanted pinnapple juice or red bull. I don't mind paying for 300+ but this place is rarely new and for the time we waited it wasn't worth it. Usually bottle service includes the juice's not just a specific one. Waitress didn't even tell me bottle didn't include drunks until after I paid then she brought me the check for the red ill and pineapple juice."}
{"text":"This place opened up just less than 2 weeks ago near our neighborhood, so I decided to check it out!  I'd give this place 3 stars for quality of food. I'd give this place 5 stars for service!  The food quality is honestly just okay. We ordered the carne asada and tres quesos rolls--my husband and I shared them and we weren't amazed. Probably won't be going back anytime soon, but if we do, it will be for the bar.  The service was awesome! Sat at the bar and talked to the bartender who was chill and very funny. A few of the waitstaff who came by the bar were also friendly and said hello, which is why I'm giving my rating a 4 star rather than 3."}
{"text":"Omg!! If New Times hadn't listed a Mexican Sushi category I wouldn't have known it existed, and for that I'm thankful. We hit Señor Sushi and it was wonderful. Add the wandering mariachi's and this place just made a regular out of me. We had the Yamas-Aki roll and the Guamachilito Roll. Both delicious. I'll be back"}
{"text":"I came in when they were not bizzy. Everything was excellent. Food,serve and quality. However I thought about arriving on a Saturday and was disappointed the food was cold and they hesitated to return so I can complain but they took too long. So I ate it but was disgusted. When the waitress arrived, I had already ate half. So I was not going to tell her anymore,partial I was hungry and waited too long. Then I couldn't find her to ask for a refill,so I ended up eating my food with no more drink. Eventually she arrived again and I ask for the bill. I'm sorry I had to leave this review because I have had excellent food prior but what I see the lack of staff when they are filled with customers."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time and loved it!  Very different than the other sushi places, but the food was delicious!  Great atmosphere,  customer service, and food.  A bit pricey but worth it."}
{"text":"Expect HORRIBLE service and an hour wait for your food! Have gone a couple times hoping to get a better treatment and its just worse each time! The food is okey. I would rather go to any other sushi place where they appreciate their costumers!"}
{"text":"Food is amazing!! Super clean and nice staff. Unique twist on cuisine. The fried rice was so fresh and flavorful and the Carne Asada roll and Cordon Bleu roll was perfect!"}
{"text":"At least they have nice bathrooms to throw up in?? Both my fiancé and I ended up throwing up after our meal.   I had read the reviews, and I thought everyone is just so picky about their sushi. But seriously. DONT EAT HERE. Thankfully w saved a family from Missouri that had walked in about 20min after us.   It taste good when it's in your mouth but after, not so much.   Great customer service but horrible food."}
{"text":"Not a good experience at all!!!  The food is a overpriced, and not all that great! And alittle annoying that you get charged for every extra condiment you ask for, not to mention the server never mentioned the extra fees! the server was very distracted and really didnt deserve the automatic 18% gratuity!!"}
{"text":"Love this place the Mexican Japanese combination is great. If your looking for traditional sushi this is not the place. The fire cracker jalapeños are a tasty start. The Asado rolls or any combination of Mexican inspired rolls. As far as cocktails go the Margaritas are choice with the Mango flavored one being the best. The device is quick and attentive with a nice disposition."}
{"text":"I came in as a first timer because of all of the fantastic reviews it had. Well I was throughly disappointed and all around just felt super uncomfortable.. It was myself and 2 other individuals, we were seated almost immediately but then sat at our table for 20-30 minutes, without a single waitstaff coming to greet us, offer water and/or take our order. I kid you not, everyone within the restaurant were starring at us (minus the waitstaff, who couldn't try hard enough to ignore us) I'm not sure if it was because we were the only group of Caucasians or if their fully staffed waitstaff, and not that busy of a restaurant, just weren't equipped for 7pm on a Monday. We finally decided an entirely new restaurant to go to before anyone came to our table... Sooo all in all, if you aren't close to 44th Ave and Indian school don't waste your gas.. and even if you are, don't waste your time!"}
{"text":"All the rolls are deep fried or at least a majority of them are, we got three different rolls which all tasted the same, and it was not tasteful, it tasted like deep fried food, I like my sushi to taste fresh.. I tried to enjoy it but I just couldn't it almost immediately made me sick, the next few days I had a terrible stomach ache. After hearing much hype from friends that Mexican sushi was good, I think I have to reestablish who my true friends are lol"}
{"text":"Horrible service. This is my second time here first time came in and it was ok, and this second time the waitress spilled sauce all over my husband he's shoes and jeans got stained and took a long time to bring a wet rag to the table. We order some beers and took 20 mins when we reminded our waitress she said she forgot about but still didn't bring them. I asked for a discount for the bad time and waitress said no that there was nothing she could do about it. The food is great just wished service was better."}
{"text":"Wow this place has change, more staff, and food was ready in only 17min much faster than last time. Lots of improvements have been done here.  Food is still good."}
{"text":"I was intrigued to try it when I saw the offer on groupon and because my fiance never had sushi before and I figured \"Well he likes Mexican food and so do I\" so this seemed like the perfect place for him to try it out. The place looks pretty to me honestly, I' am a person who prefers dark over bright light any day so perfect ambiance for me and he didn't seem to mind either. I went with the \"Mexican Roll (Call 911!)\" and he ordered hamburgers which kind of ticked me off because I wanted him to try something new but I got him to try a piece from my plate anyway. The wait time for the food was normal and once I tried it I instantly loved it. If you're the kind of person that LOVES spicy or hot foods I highly recommend getting the Mexican Roll. My fiance tried it too and loved it, and also loved his hamburger too. For dessert we ordered the fried ice cream, something we both never had before. I should've read the description on it though because its covered in coconut and I hate coconut but it didn't stop me from trying to eat it. The fried ice cream plate looked really pretty with strawberry slices placed perfectly around it with drizzles of strawberry syrup and hot fudge syrup, it was amazing. It all stayed under the groupon budget too (and yes we did tip). I highly recommend Senor Sushi!"}
{"text":"Sushi is good but they have a lot of baked or tempura rolls. Not so much raw fresh sushi. Great mango margaritas."}
{"text":"Love love this place!!! Perfect place for a girls night. Their cocktails are really good and the sushi, mmmmm!!! My favorite is the Culichi Roll and you must try the Fire Ckacker jalapeno. It does get pretty noisy on the weekends and if I still want sushi I just order it to go!!!"}
{"text":"Worst service, the waitresses run around with their heads cut off, and the restaurant was not half full. We got our food in stages, not all together as it should be. We were celebrating mom's B-day, and because of the service and less than average food, it was a disappointment! Do yourself a favor avoid this place! Minus 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Sr sushi es uno de los mejores lugares donde he comido sushi, a mi esposo le gusta mucho comer ahi de echo siempre encarga cuando esta en su trabajo a el le gusta el guamuchilito a diferencia de mi esposo a mi me gustan los ademames y cualquier tipo de sushi, les recomiendo ir al sr sushi"}
{"text":"Very fun place, sweet waitress, best crunchy roll ever and sports on TV!  They have this tropical tea that tastes like flowers and compliments the sushi so well.  Next time we're having the flaming roll and the carne asada roll!  We are in love!"}
{"text":"Ok ! I don't know where to start , we been customers since day one they stared their business! Well the past couple of month we had I really bad experience  with the service ! Some of them ( not all ) have a really bitchy attitude like if they are giving the service for free we came on July and same thing happened,,, the customer service is getting really really bad ! Thanks god are more options now !"}
{"text":"So far not that great! I've been waiting forever nobody has even come to see what we want to drink! It's not even full!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to go back ever since I left this place. Waking up thinking about sushi, making lunch thinking about sushi, contemplating more sushi for dinner. Mexican sushi is life. My husband and I went on a Saturday night and when we arrived the place was pretty full but we were seated immediately. I don't really like the table setup, they aren't that comfy & I felt like a sardine almost all crammed in there. I'm really confused as to why people are complaining about the prices, we've payed similar prices pretty much every place we've ever ordered sushi, traditional or not. Our bill was around $50 for 2 rolls & 3 drinks. Yes a little steep but well worth it in my opinion, and I'm almost sure this will be our new anniversary/special occasion go to (good bye red lobster) Some better drink specials on weekends would be nice. The food was excellent, seriously, like I want to go back right now. We got the culichi(sp?) & tres quesos. They have a live DJ And he played all Latin music. It was really loud and almost like a club but I enjoyed it and had no problem conversing with my husband. Our server wasn't like  THEE best, but he wasn't bad either so I can't complain about customer service. The hostess,who actual reseated us into a \"intimate\" booth did so very willingly after we placed our order and I felt 1,000 times better and probably enjoyed myself way more once we sat in that booth with some funky lighting fixture that cast a great orange glow.   **Bottom line.. Cheaper drinks on weekends and this place will get 5 stars from me. I definitely recommend and will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! The food is always great. Service is also good depending on the time you go. I noticed Friday and Saturday nights they get pretty busy so service can be a bit crapy.    As far as food I love the Vegas rolls, caramelo rolls, and my new favorite the GUAMUCHILITO rolls!!! Yum yum yum!   Now what I love the most about this place is the music on Friday nights!! They play rock en español so I just eat and sing all through the night lol. I Definitely recommend this place it's awesome."}
{"text":"Best sushi (if we could call it that) place in Phoenix. Don't expect to come here to eat traditional sushi, it reminded me exactly of the sushi places I used to eat while living in Mexico.. Kinda pricey but honestly the size of the rolls aren't your regular skinny size so you really get what you're paying for. The night I went there was a live mariachi singer and the ambiance was fun. You'll find me eating here often"}
{"text":"I only will give this place one star because I think that's the lowest yelp will let me rate this place, also the waitress was nice and the food tasted good. Otherwise their live entertainment was ok but to loud for my taste I couldn't even talk to my wife across from me. There was 2 couples sitting next to us that was seated after we had been seated, they had the there drinks and was 3/4s of way from finishing there meal by time the waitress says our food is on its way out. We waited nearly 45 minutes until our food came, but by that point we where just about to walk out the door.    I nicely told the waitress about our wait and even told her that the couple next us came in after we did and she apologized but no consideration was further shown. I could have spent the same money at revolving sushi bar, ate double what they gave me as an entree and probably have been out of the restaurant in a half hour.    I won't be coming back and I'm only writing this review because I don't want you to make the same mistake and wait almost an hour for your food and then have to pay full price. I'm happy for the couple next to me though they looked like they had a good time."}
{"text":"Food was great.  Ordered really quick and was served pretty fast.  Now as far as the service goes I'm not happy.   We placed our order, gave us our order and that was it my drink was empty half way thru my meal, seen our waitress walk pass us several times and never checked on us. But when it came to the bill. They were on point didn't miss a step to make sure we paid before we left and i still didn't get my drink filled."}
{"text":"The food was greaaaat! Let's start with that!!! Drinks were pretty awesome too (had a few Sakeritas!). Athemospere was nice but the music was very VERY loud... Really hard to keep up a conversation when you can't hear anyone... Also, the waitstaff although nice, they did lack on checking up on the table. This review is based on one visit to be fair.... I will definitely go back for the food... Although it was pricy it was very filling. Also, didn't love the location. Hard to find and lacked signs. Still giving them a 5 star for the unique variety of sushi:)"}
{"text":"If you're timid about eating traditional sushi, the options this place provides for cooked, Mexican-inspired sushi is what you need in your life. Or if you do enjoy traditional, they got that too! My favorite dishes to start are the fire cracker jalapeños: crab meat stuffed in jalapeños. So tasty. Then I get down on the carne asada roll. It's a roll that's filled with carne asada and vegetables, rolled in rice, breaded, then deep fried. Try it first the way it comes, then try it with some if their signature Señor Sushi sauce. You have to ask for it. My go to drinks are the \"Mangonada Margarita\" for something cold and sweet or if I'm in a different mood I go with the \"Michelada\" which is your choice of beer mixed in with a spicy Clamato mixture they prepare and the drink comes with a chile salted rim. Great if you like cold drinks with a bite like I do."}
{"text":"I hadn't been here for about a year and let me tell you that I was impress with updates on menu and service.   I went today for lunch with my sister, who by the way hadn't been there ever.  We were greeted  and seated immediately as we walked in by a very friendly waitress.  My sister and I had the \"firecrackers jalapeños\" as appetizer and order the \"tres quesos\", \"rainbow roll\" and \"Culichi roll\" to share.  Let me tell you, all of them are to die for. Best part is that this rolls are huge and very affordable.  My sister wanted to order a fourth roll just cause she is so used to sushi at other places were they come very small and only six slices. But I warned her that this place is nothing but generous on their portions.  We were extremely satisfied with our food and service.   To be honest, it took me this long to go back just because last few times I'd been there before today, waitresses were not friendly and took for ever to get our drinks and food delivered.  But this time everything was perfect.  I don't give them a 5 stars just because I believe their rolls need to be a bit tighter since we had to rush picking up the pieces and eating them before they crumble. But other than that I totally recommend this place.  Just be warned, portions are BIG so if u don't eat to much just order one roll or order a couple to share. Also be adventurous and try some of the Latin Rolls. I assure you won't regret it!!  Can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"PROCEED WITH CAUTION.  My friend and I had lunch here on Sunday 6/9/13 and both became violently ill Sunday night into Monday. Food did not taste or appear spoiled at the time, but obviously was off in some way. Wait staff was pleasant but not overwhelmingly helpful or friendly. Atmosphere was bizarre as stated in other reviews.  Overall would NOT recommend friends to visit as experience was just ok and likely caused food borne illness."}
{"text":"Great food, bad service.  Both times we have visited we have waited 20mins for drinks!"}
{"text":"We liked the carne asada roles best! Food took a while to come out, started to get a bit antsy. We would come back! We didn't get s nonalcoholic drink menu."}
{"text":"Great food and drinks!!! Had 4 different rolls, Shrimp fried rice, shrimp yakisoba it was all delicious!!!! Plus a 10% discount for military and first responders,  as a retired Navy Chief I appreciated it. The wife also had a Mangoneada margarita, it was so good it may be dangerous,  lol!!"}
{"text":"Sorry, don't waste your money and time. Food was tasteless, Sashimi salad was swamped in dressing. Lemon Roll had no flavor again over sauced.  Service was slow and place almost empty. Great... on the way to Urgent care, with possible Food poisoning.  Had to give one star, unable to give zero or negative."}
{"text":"Maryvale may be the last place to find a unique fusion restaurant, but here it is. Spacious and somewhat noisy (thanks to the multiple flatscreen TVs showing soccer games), this restaurant was quite busy on the weeknight that John M. and I went - a good sign, I think. The decor itself reflects the establishment's main concept: Mexican and Japanese combined. We shared our orders, starting with an appetizer of   boneless wings with fires, which were OK but far too heavy considering what would come next. The rainbow roll was good, as was the Melina sushi. The sushi servings were very generous and not typical of the serving portions you get in standard Japanese sushi restaurants, and the prices were good. Service was efficient and very friendly. This is definitely a good place to try if you're in the Maryvale area."}
{"text":"I went to the one in Mesa (not sure why it isn't showing up). We ordered the Firecracker Jalapenos, the mexican shrimp tempura roll and the Carne Asada roll all three were phenomenal!  We're definitely bringing some friends here.   We used to come here when it was Panchos... they redid this place nicely.   The staff were very friendly and attentive.    I didn't read the reviews before I came here.. only after we were eating (which is rare).  I hate when somewhere good is down rated.  I read some of the low rating reviews as I was eating the awesome appetizer and wonder what exactly they expected.  I immediately grasped that this is a mexican-japanese fusion restaurant from the restaurant's name. I guess some reviewers didn't grasp that this isn't a typical sushi place;  it has a mixture of American, japanese sushi (not much raw at all), and mexican inspired sushi.  A lot of the sushi is deep fried (like the Las Vegas roll is at many sushi restaurants) and has ingredients not typical like CARNE ASADA.  Don't come here expecting raw sushi, wasabi, and sliced ginger... and you'll probably love it.  Also.. while it has a bar and even has a band some nights this isn't a night club (as some low star reviewers seemed to think).  Maybe the fact that this place has a bar and stage for a band has some people justifiably confused.. I don't know (the band wasn't there today).   In any case I'll be back."}
{"text":"I've been to the Phoenix location so when I saw they opened one here I was excited! However, I don't know if it was just because they were short staffed today, but in a mostly empty establishment it took a bit for us to get seated and once we did it took another 10-15 minutes for anyone to come up to get our drink order. The upside, once we put in the order we actually got our food pretty quickly. I got the caramelo roll and caterpillar roll. Both were delicious, but my boyfriends yakisoba combo was a bit mediocre and the chicken was over cooked. Overall, mediocre experience and not as impressive as the Phoenix location."}
{"text":"Holy crap this place needs help. Bartender slapped menus down in front of us. No \"hey, How you doing?\"....nothing. Just turned around and walked off. I asked a question about the menu to which his response was \"I don't know\". Well great! That really helps. Had to flag him down to get drinks that we were never offered (We were the ONLY people at the bar). The person with me wanted a well bourbon to which the bartender pulled a bottle of Jameson Irish whiskey off the display. Turns out he didn't know if they had well anything. I won't get started on my poorly made drink. Ordered the firecracker roll....meh....could totally live without it. Didn't order anything else due to the over pricing and awful service. I won't go back. Ever."}
{"text":"Latin sushi...who would have thunk it! The culichi roll was interesting  (in a good way),  & the poison ivy roll was good too.  This will have to be a treat, because you'll go broke quick...our total bill was around  $56. A bit pricey, but I'd still recommend  this place."}
{"text":"Well. I drove over two hours to enjoy a meal here. When we got here the workers were gathered around the front podium and just stared at us like they were deer in the headlights. Finally they sat us. We ordered our drinks. That alone took about ten minutes. When our drinks finally did come, the girl spilled the drink on me. She was too busy trying to be cute for the gentlemen in the booth behind us to watch what she was doing. Then instead of bringing me another drink, she had a different girl bring it and serve us for the rest of our time there. Even after that we were still very excited to try it out. We did finally get the food. It was mediocre. No flavor. Poor customer service. We had to go to the podium to ask for our check, rather than our server bring it to us. I don't recommend."}
{"text":"Just alright.  Pretty pricey for what u get. I'm pretty sure my roll had relish and mayonnaise.  Very different than other sushi places."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of sushi but their carne asada sushi TREMENDOUSLY AMAZING! Lol. I went there while visiting family in pheonix and I loved the place. The tables were a little tiny but once you find the right position it's WORTH IT! Great place, great prices, home run guys :) future go-to place while in pheonix !"}
{"text":"This was my first time visit and it sure was a good one! The inside is very spacious! A lot of tv's to watch the sports! The customer service was great. They had a lot of different sushi rolls but I had to go with my favorite roll, the vegas roll. They were big and it came with just enough! I would definitely come back again and I highly recommend Senor Sushi."}
{"text":"I'm so in love with the spot, best place to eat and chill and have a good time  Awesome customer service  #teamondeck"}
{"text":"Sooooooo.... i don't know if this is a bar or a restaurant. From the looks of it they make their money from drinks/music nights and their food is just an added convenience to go with their alcohol. Food is overpriced and drinks get very watered down. Even though the staff is really nice they are not very knowledgeable when it comes to sushi. Obviously its not your average sushi restaurant and i know that but was expecting more. Three times I've come and i think im out."}
{"text":"Great service sushi was delicious and boneless wings were delicious ! Crystal's a very nice server she's lovely. Completely different from the other servers I've had there."}
{"text":"I returned to Senor Sushi for dinner with the family last night. I have to changed my former 4 stars to 5 stars.  It seems that now that the Groupon frenzy is over, the restaurant is less crowded than usual. The reduced crowds ensured a much faster food preparation and server check in. The food was simply amazing. We had Jalapeno Poppers (the best in town!) Guanchito Roll and a Las Vegas Roll. So amazing. This place is amazing. It is now my go to spot for tempura sushi rolls. Delicioso!  PS. The Pina Coladas are out of this world! I went from liking this restaurant to LOVING this restaurant. Five stars!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! I have had my fair share of traditional sushi, but this place is something else! The twist of \"Mexican sushi\" is soo good and this place does it right! The fire crackers, carne asada roll and the Las Vegas roll are to die for! Another hidden gem in Phoenix! Highly recommend for sushi lovers who want to try a different twist on it!!!!"}
{"text":"Its the second time i have been at Señor sushi. The first time Ive had an issue with the time it takes for them to get our food but the second time is the reason why i write this review.  The food took an hr to come here and when it did, there was a mistake where someone must of taken my plate and was left with a carne asada sushi. Waiter was rude and told me someone took my plate and expected me to eat the carne asada roll. After waiter did not try to fix the problem to get me a guamuchilito roll waiter was asking everyone who eat the plate. After telling me it would take long to get me another plate as if she did not want to get me a new one. Waiter didnt apologize and took another 20min to get my food. The worst part was that from all our 15friends that where there, 3 others experience the same situation. Worst service ever and it has to be bad enough for me to even write a review."}
{"text":"Waited forever in a day, no 1 wanted to help me, food was really greasy especially the shrimp fried rice. Made my tummy feel really sick. The sushi was bad fish was soiled.... will never return wish I could give negative stars"}
{"text":"So I do have to kinda agree with some comments on here the food was pretty great and pretty fairly priced at around $6-$12 a roll depending on what you get.I went with some buddies that dont like sushi, but they had a chicken roll and a carne asada roll which was pretty inventive and good. They have a variety of food, which i liked. I went on a friday night had some good specials $2 domestics and I think $3 mix drinks not to sure though and it was pretty busy so service was a little lagging. The girls seemed overwhelmed, but the place is fairly new so I can understand some training needs to be done. It was a mix of a bar,night club,sushi place nice interior and decor. Ive also been at lunch time and the service was better. The only reason I give 4 stars and not 5 is the service does get slow, but the food and music (which I might add they have a dj and a dance floor). I will continue to go, as service each time has been improving. Overall my service wasnt extremely bad, but it wasnt great either. Keep in mind though the weekend they treat it almost like a club, so it gets pretty hectic. Id say if you are going to just try the food go on a weekday or at lunch. If you want to have a pretty fun time, and dont mind some waiting than try a weekend. Either way its worth trying."}
{"text":"The food is really good. What needs Major improvements is their customer service. I really love this place but I try to stay away from here. Every time that I decided to go in here I've received the worst service but I've had enough. I don't think I will be coming back. I'll just stick to to-go orders because I love their food."}
{"text":"A few friends and I tried this place out and it was just ok for me. We went during happy hour and I was disappointed at how limited the happy hour menu is. We ordered a few different rolls and shared and they were good but nothing stood out as amazing to me. I had high hopes cause some other friends raved about this place but I've had better sushi rolls elsewhere. The margarita I had didn't taste like it had tequila. All I could taste was margarita mix. But great sake bombers though. I don't think I'll return anytime soon unless a friend picked the place then I'd go because otherwise there's better sushi out there. Waiters are cute! :)"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE SERVICE!!! After seating our party of only 3, we waited for over 15min for the waitress to get our drink order and NO ONE came!! There was NO ACKNOWLEDGEMENT whatsoever!! Even other guests who were seated way after us got served before us!! The place was no where near busy when we got there too. In fact, there were more employees than guests. We all got up to leave and attempted to tell the hostess we were unsatisfied with their service, but of course, NO ACKNOWLEDGEMENT!! Just plain RUDE!!!"}
{"text":"Very good food and drinks!  Sushi with an interesting Mexican twist.  The pepito shot was really fun to drink (shot inside a cucumber) The hot sun shot equally as tasty.  The crunchy Mexican sushi is spot on.  Been here twice and loved everything we've ordered.  Fried rice I give an 8/10.  Karaoke nights and live music from 9-12am on the weekends.  Prices reasonable and large, spacious dining."}
{"text":"My first experience in this place was a disaster, my two sisters, my older sisters boyfriend & I ; very specifically & nicely let our server know my younger sister was vegetarian. He showed us the vegetarian options.  Also, Keep in mind she's vegetarian for a reason due to being highly allergic to eggs. We each ordered different types of food & our server took about 10-15 minutes to bring our drinks. By the way the margaritas do not taste like they have any alcohol. Anyways, We didn't complain, still remaining very kind to our server. He brought out all of our food at different times , in between waiting about 10 minutes for each plate. We were all hungry & wanted to eat together so we waited for all of our food. But he had gave my vegetarian sister the wrong plate , we let him know & he took it and apologized for it. He then began to eat the plate that he had taken. We waited another 15 minutes, by now our food was very cold. He brought out the correct plate but had put chipotle on top of her vegetarian sushi. After five minutes of trying to get his attention, we let him know that we ordered a vegetarian fried sushi & the chipotle sauce had eggs. He began to try and argue with us about how the way they made the chipotle sauce did not have eggs. We asked if it had mayo and he said yes. We told him that mayo had eggs & my sister could have gotten very sick due to his mistake. He apologized and took the plate , by this time we were all very disappointed & aggravated. Our food was cold, we were hungry and we had like an 1 and 30 minutes waiting to eat. He came back with a regular sushi, it was not fried. But at least it didn't have the chipotle sauce. Haha ! We let him know about our cold food & he said theres nothing he could do about it. We asked for the check and left the place. Yes we paid for everything. If i could rate it negative 5 stars, i would. Never going back to this place ! Will never recommend..."}

{"text":"Worst service I have ever had, they tell you a time to be seated n every time you check to see the wait time, they tell you the same thing. The food is not even worth it. I will never come to this place again and I will make sure I tell My friends and family about this place!!"}
{"text":"The food is great! Customer service is good too. The Carne Asada roll is a must try! Call in your order if you don't feel like dining there or waiting to pick up."}
{"text":"It was ... different.  The location is totally sketch and looks like it doubles as a club some other days.  We didn't have any issues with the wait staff other than impressing the need for someone who spoke English (I can speak Spanish, but not well enough to order sushi in!).  She was attentive and generally perfect. We ordered the guamuchilito, milena, and a caterpillar roll.  Surprisingly, it was the caterpillar that I really loved and which is why Senor Sushi is getting 4 stars and not 3.  You also get a lot of food for the price, and Im not sure where the person who said the rolls were expensive is getting their sushi since this seems on target with the amount of food that your getting.   All in all, the whole experience was fun, definitely different and totally worth the drive."}
{"text":"My friends enjoyed their sushi, looks and sounds great but my order was never put in, service was slow and terrible, will try it at lunch hour and see if mayb its that they cant handle a large volume of people at one time although wsitresd was observed chatting away when i would finally get dry for too long and go fetch my own drinks at the bar which was stil a long dry...wait"}
{"text":"Love this place.  A little hard to find but worth the effort.  I will be a regular."}
{"text":"Tried calling to ask if they cook with peanut oil about 4 people got on the phone because they didn't know. Basically no one knew. Called back to ask what's in the Carne asada roll it took about 3 people to answer my question. I asked about if there was shel fish because I have someone who is allergic to peanuts and shel fish. The lady over the phone swore she spoke good English but I didn't understand her and she didn't understand me. She insisted on getting my number to place the order when I told her about 4 times how I need to know what's in the food and what oil they used. Long story short, they don't know anything when it comes to food allergies!"}
{"text":"First time here & we won't be coming back. We waited 10 mins to be seated, then we waited 45 mins for our food when TWO couples came in after us & were served & finished before we even got our food. As soon as the food came, we got boxes & left. We were still charged $30! Ridiculous. A good company would at least offer a discount, but we got nothing. Highly dissatisfied & will never come back. Also it's terribly loud & you can't even have a conversation with whoever you're with or hear the waitresses."}
{"text":"The food is delicious! Reminds me of Sushi I had In Sinaloa:) unfortunately the service is the worst. But we keep going back because of the food."}
{"text":"Very delicious I am not a big sushi eater but they had very many different options to choose from which was great! We got sat in the higher part of the restaurant made us feel a little like vip it was great! Very clean the waiter was fast to getting to us. I ordered chicken wings and chicken strips they where very good wings could have been a bit more crispy but good can't go wrong with chicken strips and wings my partner got the sushi rolls deep fried she loved them I even had a couple and they where pretty tasty I must say. I will definitely be back! They have live music and bands very packed count on waiting about 20 mins if you go in after 5 ."}
{"text":"So if you are looking for a authentic sushi experience, then I say, maybe this is not your place. I wouldnt order sashimi from this place, but I am really picky about that. This place has an awesome, lively, fun, truly different take ~ latin inspired sushi. So most of the rolls are deep fried, but it was delicious! The loud music, nightclub type atmosphere was a lot of fun. Here is my one complaint - MY GOD, it took FOREVER for the food to arrive. One of the folks in my party of 6 waited 45 minutes for ONE sushi roll. My husband waited 30++ minutes for his roll to arrive also. I think the annoying thing about that is to wait almost an hour for ONE sushi roll, have it happen to multiple parties at the table, none of the food arrived together, and for them to ADD 18% gratuity to service like that. Its presumptuous - why would I tip 18% for what I would consider poor service? None of us got to eat together, I ended up sharing my sushi rolls with the other folks at my table who were still waiting on their rolls 45 minutes later.   Here is a tip - order a salad or the teriyaki chicken, that came out the fastest or just dont go their hungry. It was definitely worth the experience."}
{"text":"Came in for dinner.. ok so not great. I get the concept but still was not impressed. The sushi was ok but not something I would come back for. The drinks nothing to Asian and I really thought the menu would have a lot more choices. This place is also so not kid friendly not in the choice of food or drinks. The service was good and the food came out fast hence the two stars. I will not. E coming back."}
{"text":"I've gone to señor sushi multiple times and I have to say it is a great place to eat. Although this is not my favorite sushi place it is pretty high up there, the food is great and I really love the fusion they have going on.  I also love the ambiance of the restaurant specially in the weekends. The few times that I've gone in on a Friday night it is pretty packed and I've seen a mariachi group walk in a few times.  The service was quick and very efficient every time I've been there.  The staff is always friendly and even though on some occasions they seem to be a little rushed they've never missed a beat with any of the orders."}
{"text":"first...hair found in sushi roll. second...screaming children. EVERWHERE. third...food was flavorless (except the 911 roll, which was very spicy and the best part of our meal).  service was ok. until it got busy, then we felt ignored.  so much for fusion sushi. we won't be returning."}
{"text":"My husband and I were visiting from out of state and heard about this place! We went as soon as it opened and the staff was very friendly and the sushi was bomb! Super unique but in the best way possible. Very clean environment."}
{"text":"Bring the family, lots of very large, comfy booths to sit and relax in! Let us use a 4 person Groupon deal for just the two of us.  Very nice place overall.  Quite a variety in sushi rolls. Latin rolls are the best!"}
{"text":"We love going to eat here.  We always go to the Indian School location in Phoenix and when we heard about the new place in Mesa we just had to come check it out.  We love the new place and saw some familiar faces from the Indian School location.  The food was amazing as always. We had our usual The Bomba and the Chicken Cordon Bleu Sushi Roll. The new place is really nice and the staff and food are great!!!"}
{"text":"I have been here before many many times  Great food great staff just one thing I didn't like yesterday we had our reservation since one week right at the door they told me there's was a cover charge of 10$ because there was live music wich I I don't like  They reduce the cover fee to half because no one ever call me to let me know about the cover fee ( they were supposed to) I saw a lot of groups of more people that weren't getting charge really pissed me off I couldn't say no my mom was there my wife and all my family who knows maybe I never go back and I am sorry for my waitress no tip but auto tip was 25dollars"}
{"text":"Amazing sushi and has a variety of menu options. They also have excellent micheladas. It does get crowded very fast so arrive early."}
{"text":"My girls and I love to eat the Sushi here. Delicious. Our first choice for Sushi spot. Fast friendly service. Fried Ice cream...omg So good."}
{"text":"I love coming here with my friend and eating sushi , I always get Cielo Mar y Tierra and this other plate I don't remember what it's called but it's delicious ! I recommend for anyone , the drinks are really good too I get Mangoniada !"}
{"text":"I heard about Señor Sushi through a friend, who was having a birthday dinner there. Imagine my surprise that in that same week, they were running a Groupon deal. When I first heard about where this place is located, I was initially hesitant, as I'm not a big fan of the West Side. (What can I say, Central Phoenix kind of girl!) Still, I gave it a try and I've been a fan ever since!  The inside is HUGE, I think at one point it may have been a sports bar of sorts. The decor is interesting, and it works. On Saturdays they play great music and there is a dance floor. During the week, I have not experienced DJed music. They also have a full bar and TVs that are usually playing soccer matches, football games, or whatever other sport is on at any given time. Any day of the week it seems like a pretty popular place and has been clean. There are always many diners, including large families, and an extensive amount of staff. The staff are extremely nice and accommodating. I have noticed that they continue to make improvements to the space and additions to their menu, so that's a good sign. On one particular visit there were musicians playing guitars from table to table and a lady was singing. Her voice is incredible!   The best things on their menu are, of course, the Latin Fusion rolls. Deep fried concoctions stuffed with different cheeses, avocados, etc? YES PLEASE! Upon first bite, I knew I was in love. These Latin Fusion rolls are ginormous. Prepare to stuff yourself into a happy oblivion. They also serve traditional rolls, but why order those when you can get those anywhere?  From the drink menu, they have outstanding Micheladas. For dessert? Fried ice cream, please! If you're into appetizers, I never order them anymore here because they rolls are just too filling, I recommend the stuffed jalapeños.   I've recommended this place to other people since I have discovered it and they've also loved it as well. Glad I gave it a chance! I don't know of any other Mexican Sushi place in the valley, nor have I ever had this type of cuisine anywhere else."}
{"text":"I've been coming to thus place since they opened up my 1st impression was this place is AMAZING, regardless of the fact that the ambience is so dull the food made up for it. The latin rolls are by far the best I've had here in the valley and their calamari salad the first few times was excellent, but there's been quite a few problems I've encountered my last visits and I just keep giving this place more chances but last night was the end of  it!!! I had the cielo mar y tierra roll which is covered in panko and deep fried the chicken, beef tasted like it had been cooked days before not fresh at all, and the oil that the roll was fried in must have been old because it made the roll taste funny and this has not been the 1st time this happened to me here my buddy ordered the gordon blue and had the exact same problem and when I ordered the kamasaki roll and didnt like it because the rice tasted odd the waitress did not wanna fix it for me nor even bother getting a manager to check out the situation so I ended up paying for something I didnt eat she was rude about it too! The calamari salad was blah and there was only about 5 other seated tables in the restaurant and we waited forever for our food to arrive. Lastly we had the \"deep fried\" ice cream which was hard as a rock when it got to our table we had to sit around and wait for it to thaw out a little and I didnt even bother to point it out to the waitress she would have done nithing anyway, overall I have eliminated this restaurant from my faves list and would not go back by any means unless they'd step theyre game up and take food and customer service seriously what a shame because their latin roll menu has so much to offer and the cooks are just not putting any effort in what they do. I only gave it 2 stars because at one point they did serve outstanding food but the customer service has always been terrible"}
{"text":"I have recently visited this establishment and I was impressed. The atmosphere was enjoyable and the music was great! Definitely will be going back!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere was pleasant. However, every order of sushi was warm from being deep fried and all tasted very similar. The Vegas roll had little to no eel sauce and the carne asada roll had only a crispy rice taste. In addition the staff was awkward and did not give good service. In short the decor is unique but the food is tasteless and slightly overpriced in addition to an uncomforting staff."}
{"text":"Senior Sushi?  It's a Sushi bar with Mexican fusion rolls that are outrageously interesting.  It's located within a strip mall next to O'Reilly Auto Parts. The inside is huge with table and booth seating for at least 200. There is a fully stocked bar and even a band stand for live music events. Several TV's are located throughout with various sporting events on. Now on to the main event - FOOD.  We tried the Caramelo roll, the Melina roll and a Rainbow roll. All of them were really good! The Caramelo roll was our favorite overall. The fish on our Rainbow roll tasted very fresh. Service was the only issue. It wasn't busy yet it took a while before anyone came and took our drink and lunch order.  Overall it's definitely worth a try and we will return."}
{"text":"This was a great find! Fun food flavors, good live music and drinks. Will be back again :)"}
{"text":"Came here the other night with a friend to try and it was definitely  yummy, this place is usually  packed most nights and they have a live mariachi band so it gets alil loud in there but rolls are super good they have regular traditional  rolls but they are really know for their kinda hybrid Japanese Mexican rolls that incorporate mexican classics like carne asada and jalapeños into a roll and deep fried definitely  delicious  tho!"}
{"text":"Pretty good.  Was a little bit skeptical about the whole Mexican-Sushi concept, but I am happy to report it exceeded my expectations!   Went in with a Groupon, and it was totally worth it. Even without the Groupon, prices are good.   We had 3 rolls, all were tasty. Also got a margarita which was delicious as well.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"Your service sucks during the day..change lighting in this place please or better yet just peel that ugly ass tint off the windows so the sun can shine on thru..Your chicken fried rice is bomb taste like a teppenyaki spots rice..nice. big ass rolls too..so if two people order different rolls u are not gonna finish that shit..3 stars for the rice..I like rice."}
{"text":"They have done a great job updating and renovating this building. It sat unoccupied for years, with paint peeling off its exterior, and slowly dying with the surrounding area (ie Fiesta Mall and many other strip malls nearby). However, few buildings nearby buildings have come back to life, and I was pleasantly surprised when I drove by this place and saw vibrant, colorful paint and banners on this building. When you walk inside, you'll be greeted by an Asian-styled restaurant with a Hispanic twist. It obviously isn't authentic Asian, but it still gets the message across. They have an open area where people can dance, a normal dining area, seating in front of the sushi bar, and two separate bars. The bigger bar/dining area is raised mildly elevated, giving you a good view of the dance floor.  I visited the Mesa location of Senor Sushi on a weekday evening for dinner. We were seated immediately and everything else thereafter was very quick. Everyone works really fast here and the customer service was decent. There was a very mild language barrier and sometimes I questioned if our server understood us. We asked him if he had a nutrition menu. I was unsure if he understood, but later, Justin who I am assuming is an owner, came over and apologized for not having one. It really impressed me that there was follow up on our request. It confirmed that our server understood us and made me feel like they cared about their customers.  About the food -- if you are wanting authentic Japanese food, do not come here. I would market it as Asian-inspired Mexican sushi, and I definitely recommend this place if you're considering! They have a appetizers, including hot wings and fries for those who do not like seafood, salads, rice, soup, specialty sushi rolls, and latino sushi rolls. I am not sure if they make more traditional rolls such as cucumber rolls, spicy tuna, etc...if requested. I tasted the Poison ivy Roll, Rock & Roll, Carne Asada roll, and Mexican Roll. The fish in all the rolls seemed fresh and tasted good. I really loved the use of cream cheese on the Poison Ivy. The Rock & Roll is a very good low-carb option because they wrap the fish with cucumber instead of rice. The cucumber itself was a little too soft, making me believe that it was too soggy or stale. I will have to reorder it in the future to understand it better. The Carne Asada Roll had very good carne asada..ha. The Mexican Roll had such a good spicy kick to it! Even the soy sauce that was served to us had some chili powder it in. I really like and appreciate what they've done to these rolls and made it their own.  They also have alcoholic beverages, a full bar, happy hour specials and live music on the weekends. I was told the performer ranges from a live band to DJ and varies greatly from one day/week to the next. This place has a really fun ambiance to it and seems like it would be a great place to come hang out on the weekends.  They've done a very good job branding their restaurant. They have a great logo. On a side note, their bathrooms are immaculate. Its design was very trendy and updated. The sink bowl and countertops are one of the swankiest designs at this time. Most importantly, it was clean! I am a clean freak and rarely give my stamp of approval to public bathrooms. This one gets my approval."}
{"text":"I do NOT recommend anyone who enjoys sushi to go to this establishment. I will say this first...this is not like a traditional sushi restaurant and they don't have any type of traditional sushi on the menu!! There's no hand rolls, no sashimi, no nigiri, none of that it's all MEXICAN rolls!!  I went over the weekend because I have had heard rave reviews that this restaurant was amazing and the food was great and unfortunately that was not the case.  When I arrived it was overly packed like a can of sardines and there was very limited seating. The wait was 25 minutes which didn't bother me too much because it was over the weekend and I expected the wait to be similar at any other restaurant over the weekend. When we got seated and saw the menus that's when everything took an unfortunate turn of events. The menu's were in very bad shape and ripped. Aside from the menu presentation there was not a lot of variety when it came to sushi. What was also off putting is the appetizers...there were Buffalo or BBQ wings and fries as an appetizer item on a \"mexican*japanese\" fusion menu which didn't add up.   We ordered our sushi (which came with no soy sauce, we had to ask our waitress) and the sushi was not good. I ordered the Kamikaze Roll but they put some type of Mexican house sauce all over it with a variety of peppers which ruined it for me. Back to the soy sauce...they didn't give me a bottle but instead a bowl of soy sauce with Tajin in it!!   I also ordered the Large Chicken Fried Rice which was actually the best item on the entire menu but it had green beans in it. My mango margarita was trash it was very watered down and disgusting. Overall I will not be returning ever again."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and I ordered the Miso soup,  Cielo Mres Y Tierra Roll and a Pina Colada. The food was good as well as the drink however, I don't think there was an alcohol in there even though they said so. The place is pretty roomy but a little pricey so not something I would bring the entire family to."}
{"text":"Decent mexican sushi. I feel like the customer service could have been a little bit better. I don't really like the table setups either. Prices are typical for a place like this, it's not too expensive."}
{"text":"All of their rolls seem to be fried. They don't even offer a regular California roll. No sashimi and no nigiri. Their noodles were flavorless and the service was pretty bad."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the Firecracker Jalapeños!  The Japanese/Latin fusion was interesting. I had the tres quesos roll, and cheesy sushi roll took some mental adjustment. The traditional crunchy roll my daughter got was better. The service was great - very friendly!!  It was worth the visit, though my husband thought the atmosphere (lighting and decor) was too much like an adult club."}
{"text":"Have been back and it seems that the owner is making an obvious attempt to make things work.  Seemed better together and better attention to the customers.  I am glad I gave a 2nd chance to this plase as I said before, the food is Amazing!"}
{"text":"This is simply my favorite sushi restaurantYou also have to try the wings and micheladas, they're awesome!"}
{"text":"Sushi! Was great. We had poison ivy roll Mexican roll,-Spicy tempura and Fried rice with Chicken. Mango Lada margarita and blue moon 55.00. Very good! Fast service kind of loud Mex music, but fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"I ordered for carry out and the lady that I had spoken to said it would be 25 minutes. I got there in 30 minutes and my food still wasn't ready. They took forever, but other than that, I was pretty satisfied with this place. It was my first time trying it. Pretty affordable prices even though it wasn't happy hour. I'm definitely coming back when I'm on that side of town :)"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised by the hybrid. Thoroughly enjoyed my experience! Loved the food!"}
{"text":"Senor Sushi is the bomb!!!! Very creative sushi rolls that taste awesome. Service was great. It was a little empty at 2 pm but noticed they have a happy hour that starts at that time. So I'm guessing once the word gets out about this place it will be a lot more busy."}
{"text":"This is my husband and I first time here. Upon arriving, we were seated very quickly! Our waitress brought our drinks(we ordered micheladas) and were very delicious. We ordered the lemon roll and rock and roll. All I have to say that it is \"fire!\"  I will definitely have to come here on a more regular basis."}
{"text":"The sushi was amazing!! Love the mexican rolls. I come again. My kids love it. The place was really clean and nice services."}
{"text":"Bless Groupon for leading us to an unexpected find in Maryvale: Mexican sushi and a sizable, comfortable, and unusual venue to dine in.  Big comfortable booths line the perimeter, semi-encircling numerous tables stationed on the stained concrete floor.  The place is awash in a very oriental color scheme of deep red and black, while numerous flat screens broadcast futbol visible throughout.   Tucked away (I seem to go to a lot of places that are \"tucked away\") in a small 1/3 empty shopping plaza located on NW corner of 43rd Ave & W. Indian School, once you figure out it's in the plaza, the building housing Señor Sushi sit's behind/ just to the north of the O'Reilly Auto Parts that faces Indian School Road.  There's a lit sign on the building that apparently wasn't there early this year, and I'll grant that with the front windows and door covered up with only a lit \"Open\" sign exposed, it is a bit reminiscent of an old time \"adult\" bookstore - except I don't recall seeing any of them with their windows and doors covered with huge color photos of sushi rolls.   They were doing a surprising amount of business for a Monday night but it's a good sized place and they were not crowded and we were seated immediately.  Our server greeted us nearly immediately, was most helpful, and maintained a smile throughout our interactions.  She took our beverage order right away, and brought those to us in short order.  I regret not being able to compliment her by name, as she was friendly, courteous and helpful, and in English, which I don't think was necessary for most of the other patrons, but was appreciated by us.   We ordered a very un-Mex-un-Japanese appetizer of \"boneless terriyaki chicken wings served on a bed of fries\". The chicken bites were good, and the fries tasty enough, but it did make for a  heavy start.  Norm ordered the Rainbow Roll ($11.95) and I the Melina ($10.95),  consisting of Shrimp, Chicken, Bacon, Avocado, Crab Meat, cucumber, Chihuahuah and Cream Cheese (deep fried), Poor doggie, but very good, and huge.  I've never seen a serving of sushi of that size, and I thought the Melina was excellent, and loved the flavors.  The Rainbow roll of  Shrimp Tempura, Spicy Tuna, Cucumber, Avocado, Spicy Señor Sauce & Orange Sauce, I thought very good as well, though didn't detect the orange or spicy which  I may have missed on the side.  We were unable to finish and had a small amount leftover to take home.    The full price of our generous meal for two without the coupon would have been $35 (+tip).  I don't do sushi often but recall spending way more in a very informal place in DC more than 15 years ago - and leaving hungry.  We did not leave Señor hungry tonight.   In other news, the stained concrete-floored dining area appeared clean.  The large, black-ceilinged interior  I thought had a night-clubbish feel to it.  Numerous families were dining and while I was surprised at the number of small children (burgers available on the menu if the kids aren't into rice & rolls, but not running loose and not obtrusive but for a shriek or two.  The men's room was clean and stocked with all necessities including TP, disposable seat covers, hand soap, paper towels, and working hand dryers.  If you're looking for \"genuine Japanese style sushi\" - go somewhere that claims to serve it.  In my limited sushi experience, you'll pay a lot more for a lot less.  \"Genuine\" is great, but don't let that stop you from appreciating a different take on the subject,   I think Norm R will agree our food was very good, the serving sizes downright shockingly generous, and our server could not have been friendlier or more helpful.  Your experience may vary, but as for me, I shall return."}
{"text":"From Tempe to 43rd Ave and Indian School is quite a trek for sushi but we had a Groupon and decided to try something new. I ordered the Las Vegas Roll just to have something I KNEW I'd like and decided to try one of the Latin rolls. I got the Guamuchilito - Shrimp Tempura, Avocado, Cucumber, Crab Meat, Cream Cheese/Fresh Shrimp (breaded and deep fried). It was amazing. The decor was nice, not overdone. The service was good (read: helpful & friendly). We will definitely make that drive again. I can't wait to try some of their other creative rolls."}
{"text":"We stop by Saturday night. Super busy but still only waited about 20 minutes. My favorite are the firecracker jalapeños and the carne asada rolls. There margaritas are also delicious."}
{"text":"The waiters are nice and polite, but the sushi is so bad. I couldn't taste the fish at all. Was kind of fried rice sushi. So frustrated. The grocery store sushi is better."}
{"text":"Poor service. After a period of 16 months, I would go dine every Friday to this restaurant. Loved the food and the live music they would provide. But, after two continuous occasions, I would sit at the bar and wait for someone to attend me. Keep in mind, there is a bartender in front of me serving other people around, and waitresses would pass by without . I make eye contact and wait to be attended by him. Around 15 minutes pass and no menu was given to me or was I offered any service. My expectations of this place are high because of the frequent visits. But, expectations bring disappointment. This was the second and last time I will recommend or consume at this location."}
{"text":"Went here and was happy with my order a kamikaze roll. It was delicious just very spicy! Would come back!"}
{"text":"Amazingly good! This place is a hit with Japanese! Apparently, they filmed a Japanese reality TV series here. A master sushi chef digused himself as an employee learning the art of Sushi making. Of course, there was a grand finale when the chef revealed who he really was! Then taught them the REAL art of Sushi...and it shows! Decor is somewhat lacking, but makes up for it in the food!   TRY THE FIRECRACKERS!!! (jalapenos stuffed with spicy tuna)...yummy."}
{"text":"Señor sushi was an interesting experience. The atmosphere is kind of funny. It looks like it was a night club before. The windows are still blacked out and there is a giant wooden dance floor and huge bar. It was a little weird. It did not feel like a sushi place.  Anyways, I had a groupon so we decided to check it out for lunch.  We seated ourselves and the baby. FYI, they have good high chairs where my baby can't crawl out.  The menu had some fun things like edamame with tapatio. We decided to try 3 rolls- tres quesos, Milana, and guacamuchalito. We also got fried rice for Baby to chew on.  The rolls were pretty expensive. 11 dollars per about.  Wow these rolls were huge! We ordered waaaay too many. We can usually split 3 rolls between us but not here. We had so much left over. I would prefer them smaller and cheaper so I can keep up a variety. I love to get many different kinds of rolls and not just 1 or 2. Fortunately we had a groupon, so the price was not too bad.  The rolls were very tasty. I was a fan of the queso one, and hubby liked the guaca one. The problem was we only got friend cheesy rolls so it was a very heavy meal. I didnt leave the sushi place feeling like I got pretty healthy food like I usually did. I went home and took a nap and was still stuffed.   I did not find any problems with the service. It was fine for me.   Now the question will we be back? Hubby says he probably won't because he likes traditional healthy food. I would go back with a friend and another groupon but would order a lot differently."}
{"text":"Such a relaxed atmosphere. Very much like waking into a Mexican restaurant with the strolling musicians and tv's projecting Spanish tv.  But visually a Japanese restaurant with the colors and lotus lamps through out the venue.  The food was delicious and had generous portions.  Service was fast and despite being a very busy night with a birthday party...we were seated, waited on and was served fairly quickly. Definitely coming back for the carne asada roll."}
{"text":"First time going last night and was thrilled! The waiter was awesome and offered great items to us (bc we've never been) and the service was fast! Food was delicious and affordable. I also order a mango margarita and was loving it! Pretty cool during weekends since they have a dj with awesome music"}
{"text":"In my opinion, it was gross. Fried meat covered in rice. Meh. I could do better at home. Came here on recommendatiin and bummed I went."}
{"text":"We were so excited to try this place because it sounded interesting. As soon as we walked in the host only spoke to us in Spanish and neither me or my boyfriend understood. After we told him we didn't understand Spanish he still continued to talk to us in Spanish. The entire restaurant was empty, they were playing club music off of somebody's phone, were changing the songs midway through, constant \"pings\" from incoming texts, and the commercials from the Pandora stations were nonstop. They kept mopping the floor and all you could smell was Pine-Sol which is nice for at home but not at a restaurant.  As for the food, expect everything to be over $10 but you do get a lot. The flavors aren't anything special and they all taste \"okay\" but definitely not worth it. Our server barely spoke English but was really friendly.  Overall we won't be coming back to this place. The food isn't anything special and it's not worth the hype. Wish we went somewhere else altogether, hands down."}
{"text":"I purchased a groupon today and decided to give this restaurant a try. I loved it. I am not a fan of loud Spanish music but the food was so good I didn't care. The firecracker jalapeños had a nice crunchy batter and my Latin roll was perfect. The portion sizes are huge. I left full and happy. I will be back to try the fried ice cream."}
{"text":"Home run. Food is beyond awesome. Service was quick. A bit of a trek for us but definitely worth the trip!!"}
{"text":"What a cool, bizarre assault on the senses!  Picture this, late night, post-Dodgers' spring training game at Camelback- and afterwards, it's 10:30 pm and we are hungry for something different.  YELP to the rescue!  Search \"late night dinner\" and up comes Señor Sushi- not too far from our hotel.  Drive to a seemingly deserted strip mall...walk in...and are instantly assaulted by really good, really loud live salsa music and disco lights!  Order Sapporo beers, eat creative \"Latin fusion\" sushi made with jalapeño, Mexican cheeses, carne, and also good old standbys like Volcano rolls.  We wish there was one of these out here!  But you'll need to learn sign language to communicate!  Loud loud loud!  And girls taking selfies in the bathroom..."}
{"text":"We went on a Saturday afternoon and surprisingly wasn't as busy, maybe we got lucky but we were seated immediately and our order was taken and delivered to our table in a timely manner. The sushi was actually pretty good! Better than I expected. Their micheladas are also very good but a little on the expensive side for the size ($9.00). All in all still giving 5 stars for good and timely service and will be returning soon!"}
{"text":"Sushi and Fun. First this place gets packed so be patient. The sushi was good I think we ordered pretty much all of them. The drinks were so creative and tasty. The live music was a awesome plus!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here tonight, for the first time. We will be back!!! The food was so delicious, fresh, and fast! The service was great too!  We had the firecracker jalapenos for an appetizer, and I was afraid they would be too spicy for me, (I'm a spice wimp) but they were not hot at all, and were full of flavor. The portion was very large too. We got 8 big jalapeño halves stuffed with crab and cream cheese and other good stuff.  For our meals, we got a Guamachulito roll, which was a shrimp tempura roll with a Mexican twist, and a carne asada roll. Both were humungous rolls, 10 to 12 pieces each. I could only eat 4 pieces, and I was stuffed. The food was very fresh, and full of flavor. I can't wait to come back with friends. GREAT MEXICAN-JAPANESE FUSION RESTAURANT!!!"}
{"text":"This Mexican sushi is the best!! The place looks lonely on the outisde, but it's lively inside. We usually have to wait since it's crowded on the weekends, but I love the vibe in Senor Sushi and I love how their sushi has a kick to it. The banda is nice too."}
{"text":"It took me a good while to find this place, even with Google Maps, Apple Maps and my girlfriend telling me I was in the right spot (and those three never agree).  The windows are blacked out, but there is a little sign if you look up and a solitary neon flashing \"Open\". It honestly looked like a certain kind of video store from the 80's and 90's. The kind of video store doesn't carry Disney movies, if you know what I mean.   Inside is no less confusing. To the right is a decent sized bar with a bunch of big screen tvs. Ahead is a stage.  Service was friendly, but it helps if you can speak Spanish. The menu had some of the traditional sushi rolls, but you don't come here for those, you come for the Mexican Roll or the Guanchito roll. Deep fried and heavy, but tasty and massive! The highly recommended jalapeño poppers did not disappoint.  Worth the visit, but probably wouldn't make a return trip."}
{"text":"FANTASTIC!! Oh my good it was sooo good!!! The Mexican Asian fusion was on point!! We had 8 different rolls, some giant margarita and the jalapeño things. The service was awesome and they were super friendly. I can't remember what rolls we got but they were allll gooood"}
{"text":"They don't speak English.  Forgot our order multiple times Wouldn't talk to us because we spoke English  My boyfriend was furious  And I ended up getting really sick from the food"}
{"text":"Like this place Food its somewhat expensive but its the closest shushi place from my home"}
{"text":"I love this place everything is delicious.  The mexican sushi rolls are the bomb.  The milena roll is our family favorite roll they are so yummy.  The waitresses are fast and very friendly, its a little expensive but its so worth it.  Give it a try you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Mexican spin on sushi, interesting but good! Seems sketchy but it's yummy! Go for the Latino rolls."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic if you are looking for something different.  You will not find the traditional sushi snob and confusing menu but a friendly flavorful fusion on a perfect Mexican style sushi,"}
{"text":"I wasn't really impressed. I may be due to the server automatically speaking Spanish to me, but I guess she probably feels the same way going to most places and having servers automatically speaking English to her.  Anyway, if you like sushi, it's a good place to go, but any other foods than that, forget it.  The shrimp and noodles dish tastes like they seasoned it with leftover ramen packets."}
{"text":"My husband and I will definitely stop here again. I have the Entertainment Coupon Book and I like to try different places when driving through other areas of the Valley (we are in East Valley).   The food was WONDERFUL! We had the Calamari appetizer, Poison Ivy roll and Culichi Roll.  We were here on a Sunday morning at 11:00 am. First customers. The service was very good.  Highly recommend"}
{"text":"It's obvious the staff here is trying hard to please their customers. Unfortunately it's a little to diverse and new, which is causing them trouble.  It's not a full Sushi bar. They only do rolls and fried apps and such. No fresh lovely slices of fish on a little pad of rice here. It's all calorie rich and loaded with fat. Except the Edamame, which is very good. We had the Edamame and the Calamari Strips as apps. The Calamari would make an excellent substitute for show leather. I brought this to the attention of the floor manager just as a young lady at the next both was struggling as she attempted to bite into hers. The manager said it was a new supplier they are trying and they will take a good look at it. A few minutes later she came back and said the chef agreed and they would change it. Like I said, they try hard to please. I LIKE THAT! The roll we had was good, though it had a half inch thick layer of cream cheese on top. It was tasty though not so healthy.  The Mexican inspired rolls left something to be desired and we didn't even give them a second thought. I'll get my Carne Assada at a real mom and pop place, thank you very much. If they make it through the next few months of growth problems this place may become a worthy place to eat. I think they have potential."}
{"text":"Such a strange concept for me. We ordered a rainbow roll and the tres quesos roll and much preferred the rainbow roll because of the strong panko flavoring on the latin roll. The drinks are strong, and when I say strong, i mean STRONG! This place can get busy so expect a bit of a wait. Service is hit or miss. I am told that the carne asada roll is the way to go so we will be back to try that."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our evening at señor  sushi. The rolls are deep-fried, Latin, and enormous. They're also quite delicious. I do recommend."}
{"text":"First time here. It was really different going to a Mexican sushi restaurant. Mexican music and Hispanic service staff. We had calamari to start, it was really good. Crunchy outside and perfectly cooked inside. We ordered 4 rolls, all fresh ingredients and great flavors. Normally we only eat sashimi at sushi places but there wasn't any on the menu (that's why only 4 stars). Also had fried ice cream and churros for dessert, both very yummy. I had a fiery mango martini (2 actually ) that had really good flavor. I have a couple of friends that I would like to bring here for the experience. We had a really great server as well."}
{"text":"I didn't like this place and I won't be back. I've had Mexican/Japanese fusion sushi in Tucson and loved it, but this place is far from any type of traditional sushi and not in a good way. First of all, we couldn't even find the place. We had a groupon so that's how I even heard about it in the first place. I called about 20 times and each time it went straight to a voicemail that hadn't been set up. The place has blacked out windows with NO SIGN, just a small flashing neon \"open\" sign. The atmosphere is weird. It's a very large open space with lots of black furniture and a dance floor? It looks either very unfinished or like a grimy sports bar, since it has huge tvs and a huge bar that covers one entire wall. I didn't find the wait staff too friendly, well trained, nor professional. It took over 45mins to get our three rolls. We had to ask for obvious things like dipping plates, soy sauce, etc. I agree with some of the other reviews that their orders are large and we had plenty leftovers. I also agree that the food here is extra unhealthy. Everything is either deep fried or overly covered in mayonnaise-based sauces. We ordered the tootsie, volcano and carne asada and the carne asada was the best, although it was deep-fried. I didn't feel like I had a healthy meal, good service nor a pleasant surrounding environment.   Also, I used their restroom and of the two stalls, one had the toilet seat broken and laying on the floor and the other had a door that didn't close properly. =/"}
{"text":"This place is a strange hybrid of asian and latino restaurant as you'd expect. The service from my server was really amazing. She took the time to explain the variations of rolls and how they compare to traditional sushi.   There were a lot of unique takes on conventional sushi rolls with the latin flair. I think they had a lot of good flavor combinations however I found a lot of rolls to be too heavy. Great value of quantity of food for the price but I left there feeling like there was a brick in my stomach."}
{"text":"Polite and friendly service. We were looking to try something new today, and have passed by this place a few times. We ordered fried rice, a carne asada roll, and a  caramelo roll. Everything came quick and the food was really good."}
{"text":"The food is scrumptious, you get personal service from the staff and the entertainment is the best!!!  The sushi is different, with a Mexican style, but this is what makes this restaurant unique.  I have seen some famous Trios singing such as the Trio Los Reyes and Jessie Armenta, known composer, radio personality, and leader of the wonderful group that performs at the restaurant.  You will love this place and you will leave singing."}
{"text":"Best food ever. Best Micheladas ever. Love this place except when it gets too loud on the weekends you can't hear yourself think. But all in all they are totally worth it Mexican sushi is my favorite."}
{"text":"I am so disappointed with this place. The customer service was horrible seeing as our server and the manager refused to speak to us in English. Luckily I understand Spanish, but my boyfriend doesn't know a lick, so I was having to translate. If not everyone at the table understands, why not speak in a language we can ALL understand. I thought it was so rude for that to happen. Our waiter never refilled our cups and I had to catch him to get our checked since he never checked up on us. To the very end of our meal, when I still continued to answer in English, our waiter only spoke to us in Spanish. I was made to feel unwelcome and less than.  The food had no flavor. So bland and the breading for the fried sushi was excessive.  Needless to say, I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Been there once and the service was horrible. And don't bother trying to make a to go order because calling 4times isn't enough to answer. GREAT PLACE LOL"}
{"text":"If you're going on weekends at night be prepared to wait a while! After our wait we were seated and greeted by our waitress but it wasn't very greeting. Those comments about the service are not wrong, she was very rude from the start and not welcoming whatsoever. We ordered the cordon bleu and caramelo roll, both were really good but they have plenty of cream cheese. The chicken fried rice was VERY good. We also ordered a miso soup as an appetizer but she didn't bring it out until we already had our rolls, when I mentioned that we didn't want it anymore she refused to take it back and gave us attitude even though she took forever. Great food, not so great waitress."}
{"text":"Not the best decor not the best part of town.  But let me tell you probably the best green mussels I have ever had.  The sushi was great ! Fried ice cream was awesome. The beer was ice cold.  I will be back ."}
{"text":"My first and great experience to this unique sushi restaurant. Mixing Hispanic / Latino culture with sushi is definitely different. They offer a wide variety of traditional Hispanic dishes and secondary sushi rolls. On the back of their very colorful menu they blend sushi and Hispanic food into Latino rolls. If you are looking to try something different and don't want the same Hispanic or sushi restaurant this would be a good place for you. It was a clean comfortable setting and easy to find with good parking.  The rainbow roll I had was large, filling and fresh. $12.00 worth it"}
{"text":"I was here on business and my friend suggested I try here.  I'm adventurous, so I was game with the whole Mexican sushi concept.  I tried the Mexican roll first.  It had spicy crab, salmon tempura, and the taste was pretty original, also had a slight spice to it.  The waitress told me that the Fire Cracker jalapenos were good so I went for those.  All I can say is I have never every considered jalapenos in sushi, but with the spicy ahi, and crab, these chefs really know what they are doing.  Really good!  I only had time to try 2 things because I had a meeting, but I'll be back again in 2 months, so I'll go back if I'm in the neighborhood.  I think its so cool that almost every sushi chef in either Scottsdale or Phoenix are Mexican.  I guess like my chef friend in New York said, Mexicans are really the best cooks in the world, but Sushi, who knew!"}
{"text":"The food is decent...when you eventually get it after waiting for 2 hours! More than anything, the service and staff is the absolute worst! They don't come and check on you at all, we had to call them over when we needed something. But the wait time was just absolutely ridiculous! I have eaten there and ordered pick up and it is always an excruciating wait. The food is not good enough to make up for the staff and/or service!"}
{"text":"I really like the idea of Mexican and Japanese fusion. Who wouldn't enjoy their sushi with a margarita? We ordered the tempura calamari, rainbow roll, Vegas roll, mangoneda, and coronita.  The fish inside the calamari was annoying because it kept slipping out. But I did like that outside of it. It was similar to a mozzarella stick without the cheese inside. The Vegas roll and rainbow roll, I'm not that impressed. I've had better.   The drinks aren't bad. The mangoeda was tasty but not strong enough. I did like the coronita though."}
{"text":"Wow! So, these guys (owners) learned how to make sushi from another great sushi restaurant chain in Arizona.  They learned very well and after many years they got together and opened Senor Sushi.  The location might not be glamorous but the food is.  The taste of the food is excellent.  You might not find all of the traditional sushi dishes here but you will find great sushi.  For the most part the menu is a Mexican infused sushi and it is amazing.  Especially if you like spicy food.  The service staff is still learning and with time they should get it together.  Lunch time is the best time to eat here. They have a stage so it might turn into a Mexican fiesta a night with live entertainment.  If are looking for a nice traditional Asian sushi place this might not be the place for dinner.  There is nothing romantic about the restaurant.  The decor does have some Asian influence but the staff screams Mexican restaurant.  The staff overpower the decor, but the great tasting sushi overpowers everything.  I've never ate carne asada sushi (pretty sure thats not sushi) but they say it is.  Give it a try and tell me what you think?  I've heard its good.  Anyway  If you are in the neighborhood give them a try the food is worth it."}
{"text":"I'm not the person to leave bad reviews but this place was a total disappointment, not only to me but for my family as well.  We went on a Sunday and when we got there, there was many people but we got seated on a timely manner. The real problem began when we ordered our food. It took an hour and a half for our food to get there. Our waitress never came once after she brought our drinks to ask how we were doing nor to ask if we we wanted a refill. After hour in a half! My sister called the waitress to ask where her food was at, since we all had gotten our food except for her. The waitress then said that they were backed up and left. Not once in that hour in a half did she ever mention that.  After another 15min she brought my sisters plate of food, which wasn't even what she had ordered! At this point we were all outraged and my sister asked to speak to the manager, which the waitress then said she was one of them. So then she asked to speak to the supervisor which the waitress then ignored the request and said that she wasn't going to charge my sisters food. Which is not the point, the point is that the service was HORRIBLE and no place makes you wait 1 hour and 40 min to get your food and not to even care to ask how you're doing or inform you that your food is not ready.  NEVER going back to this place again!"}
{"text":"please do NOT visit this restaurant if you're looking for spicy tuna, dragon, or any such other standard sushi fare.  This is not your typical sushi restaurant, but a place where, (happily) not many people seem to go, because they haven't discovered it yet.  I had no idea this place existed.  I've driven by the shopping center at 43rd Ave & Indian School Rd at least twice a week, and if it wasn't for a Groupon deal, I would have missed out on what is now a weekly must-visit for me.  They could chuck the entire menu in the garbage, and only serve the following fusion rolls, and I would be VERY happy to gorge myself at EVERY visit:   GUAMUCHILITO, CIELO MAR Y TIERRA, TRES QUESOS, CORDON BLEU  there's only ONE word to describe the sushi at this place: A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!!!!  A word of caution: if you don't like deep-fried sushi, then avoid these rolls.  I LOVE the crunch texture and that's why they're my favorite.  Also, the portions are ENORMOUS.  one two rolls can feed two people without the need for appetizers, or dessert.  Make sure you go on an empty stomach, and you will be rewarded."}
{"text":"The food is good but bad service. As we arrived the person who was at the front was on the phone taking a to go oder never acknowledging us. When he finally got off the phone he just grabbed some menus and told us to follow him. After waiting for about 20 minutes we finaly asked who our server was because no one came by to even take our drink order. Our server was very  rude and the only person who actually treated us like customers was the bus person her name is Raquel."}
{"text":"This brought together my two favorite things. Mexican food and sushi. And I enjoyed every bite. This place is an adventure so check it out if you are ready to have your mind blown. Good job Señor Sushi. Good job! Oh and our server was awesome. Wish I could remember her name."}
{"text":"There are Mexican sushi & Japanese Sushi rolls on the menu.  The food is really good, service good, you should try it !  There was a bandito ! Great atmosphere with the music.   Great place, gracias muchachos !"}
{"text":"I was hesitant at first but then I read some Yelp reviews and had to try it for myself. What really helped was coming in with an open mind, if you are looking for traditional sushi this is not the place. It is a perfect blend of mexican/japanese fusion and they have some absolutely stunning rolls, delicious too! Service was OK, friendly but a little airheaded at the end when we needed our bill then wanted to pay (took awhile). Other than that gotta say the food is legit, we are going back. Give them a chance!"}
{"text":"My family eat at this location couple weeks ago. The food was not that great and we all ended up with food poison."}
{"text":"We heard about this place and decided to celebrate Mothers Day here. We drove a long way and when we saw the parking lot full of people we weren't optimistic but fortunately a large party had just left and we only had to wait 15 minutes. We ordered calamari, baked mussels, stuffed jalapeños and 4 different roles and their blue margaritas. The food was fresh and delicious with first rate presentation. Who ever heard of Japanese/Mexican fusion?  The service was excellent and timely especially with how busy it was. And the Mariachis were some of the best I've heard.  We are already planning our next visit. Love this place!"}
{"text":"I wish I could leave less...The service was horrible, the food tasted like it was sitting at a gas station and then served. No alcohol in my drink and appetizer never came. I understand that the kitchen was backed up for a large party but that was never relayed to us. We were there a little over an hour and finally asked for our check from another waitress."}
{"text":"This is officially my new favorite sushi place they have the freshest fish available, I tried the salmon special and Jesse's special roll.   When you go there ask for Julio or Jose and tell them you want Jesse's special roll and tell them I recommend you.   I know what your thinking, Mexicans serving sushi?...let me tell you these guys ha e more skills than many true Japanese restaurants I have been to, I eat sushi at least 3 times a month and I was just wowed.   Remember be sure to ask for Jesse's special roll if you like a little kick to your rolls."}
{"text":"First off, needs a bigger sign. Overall this place is pretty good. Definitely not your typical sushi place. I had the Mexican Roll that had just the right amount of spice. The service is decent. Got our orders in and food in a good time. It's also pretty pricy. My roll was a solid $10. Currently waiting for our bill which has been a while.  They include 20% for the tip in the bill which is why I think the service isn't very good. Why work for it when you already get it kinda thing. I'd come here again, maybe."}
{"text":"Love coming here with my friends and family. The food is delicious and a very vibrant atmosphere."}
{"text":"The good was very good and different. Not alot if options for rolls, but there is something for everyone. There is no nigiri. It's very Latin oriented. There was a mariachi group playing on the weekday that i went. They have full live music on weekends."}
{"text":"This place is defiantly not your typical Sushi  bar . How every it does a pretty good job at bringing the traditional  Japanese sushi bar and Mexican  Traditions together to make for a pretty awesome atmosphere.  On weekends they have Mexican dancers with Mexican music while sitting watching the sue chefs make your dinner. On top of all this the sushi is AWESOME. I eat sushi all the time and this place ..... ( although maybe located in not the greatest part of town ) is probably some of the best I've had. So with this I have to give Señor."}
{"text":"I would have never found this place on my own...but word of mouth brought me and we will be customers for life! this place is amazing. I give it a 10. their Latin fusion rolls are to die for...come hungry. i had the kamikaze roll and it was better than anything I ever had in California. come eat here and you will be hooked. nicely appointed and a friendly staff. quiet too...you can actually talk. very clean and cool for the summer. I highly recommend this Latin fusion Japanese...it will blow your mind! order lots and share. enjoy!"}
{"text":"It was my first time here and we came to celebrate a friends birthday. The wait was lengthy even with reservations and they did not accommodate all of our party. The food took over an hour to be brought to our tables and it was cold, vapid and overly greasy. Not impressed by locale, staff and food. Will most definitely not come back. Oh and as we speak I've been waiting for a water refill now for 35 minutes! #fail"}
{"text":"My wife and I visited the 43rd Ave. location today for lunch. We ordered quite a bit of food ($60 worth) and every single food item came out even more delicious than we expected it to be. The portion sizes were generous and in addition to being enjoyable, the food was really fresh. However, the service provided was pretty bad. Our waitress only came by maybe three times to check on us so we had to go quite a while without drinks and paying for our meal took way longer than it should have. I probably will go back because quite honestly the food can almost make up for the bad service but I really won't have Senor Sushi among my top choices for places to eat in the future."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service! I decided to try this place as it is literally the closest \"sushi\" spot from my work. I walked in and asked for the order I had placed over the phone, the hostess said \"ok\", then walked away and never returned. I ordered the volcano roll which was meh (no other word comes to mind). I ate it but can't say I enjoyed it. I won't be returning to Senor Sushi. What a waste of my lunch break."}
{"text":"If I could give this place no stars I would! I went with my friend took them 45 minutes to sit us after they said it would only be 15. The table that got seated after us got their drinks and food before us. We got two beers and never saw our sushi so we just walked  out. This place had horrible service I don't think anyone should attend this place unless you want to be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"Oh, where to start...  Let's start with the food.  Ordered the jalapeno appetizer, Mexican Roll, Mohica (Momila??) Roll, and chicken tenders with fries (for the kiddo in our dinner party).  The jalapeño app was muy delicioso and not at all what I was expecting!  They were jalapeños sliced in half lengthwise, lightly and crispily breaded and stuffed with crab among other things.  The jalapenos were super fresh -- they appeared to be uncooked despite being breaded, which gave them a surprisingly good crunch!  The Mexican roll was my favorite roll -- it looked like your traditional sushi roll but with a latin interpretation.  It came with a dipping sauce that was difficult to figure out exactly what was in it... but I found myself soaking my roll in it!  And their special spicy sauce is outstanding.    The kitchen... was about as slow as they come.  After maybe 30 minutes, the chicken tenders came out.  It took another 25 minutes or so before the jalapeño app came out... and maybe 15 more minutes before the Mexican roll arrived.  And then maybe another 15 minutes before the Molica (Mimolca??) roll was delivered.  I am glad the children's dish came out first, but I would think both dinner dishes would have been served at the same time.  And seriously, it was a LONG wait time for food preparation.  The service was pretty friendly, but it took at least ten minutes before our server initially stopped by our table.  Granted, it was a super busy night... but there were a handful of times when I looked for a server but was left sitting there for five or ten minutes trying to catch her attention to ask for this or that.    The ambiance and setting... like other reviews state,  this place looks like more of a dance club with the lights on... so maybe trying to dim the lights wouldn't be a bad idea.  And the dark tint on the front glass is just tacky.  Maybe this is one of those places that turns into a club afterhours... so if that's the case, then maybe they could just pull off the tint by the front door so you it seems more inviting and open from the outside?  Not sure why the tint bothers me so much, but it does...  Next time I'd probably order carryout."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed and over priced! My friends had been to the location in Phoenix and loved it and decided to check out the location in Mesa... big mistake!!! The fish did not taste fresh... food lacked flavor... overall not good quality. I thought ok maybe the spicy tuna roll is simple enough but it looked and tasted like something you would get at a gas station (not that I've ever had it). If you are going to charge a lot for a drink put some liquor in the damn drink. Would not recommend... they need to get better quality fish... hire some people that know how to make sushi... revamp the menu as it took forever to order because nothing stood out as being this sounds amazing. I have no issue spending money on good food but when you're disappointed and then get the high bill... no thanks"}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere, great customer service, food was great. Will definitely be back. I love the twist they put on the normal sushi rolls to make things a little bit different. Justin the owner was super cool guy and even recommended some of the food to us."}
{"text":"came in with my family a party of 4 adults 2 small children and we specifically asked for a booth. the place was empty. the host sat us in this weird large half booth and just walked away before asking or saying \"is this ok?\" like most places do she just walked away and we were like umm hello so we had to ask another lady to see if we could sit somewhere else so we sat in a table next to that booth and a lady came up to us and told us we couldnt sit there because it was for a bigger group and i was like \"its empty in here you arent busy whats the deal of us sitting here?\" we had to move anyway which was just annoying at that point. i told her again we wanted a booth and there were like 10 booths open but she still sat us at a table and at that point i was just annoyed and we ended up walking out. thanks for losing our business over letting us sit in a damn booth when you werent even busy. your hosts dont seem to understand what a booth means"}
{"text":"The sushi is good but the location and the waiters are ratchet. If you are Mexican you might actually have a good time there because they have banda nights on the weekends. One thing I must add about their sushi is that it's one of the best I've tried in phoenix, their sushi might be even better than kabuki's so try it! I recommend the traditional rolls like the Vegas roll, the california roll and the shrimp tempura roll."}
{"text":"Just found my new sushi restaurant. My and hubby have been searching since we moved to this part of Phoenix. Atmosphere was lively, staff was great,  and the food... so good. We got a traditional Las Vegas roll (this is going to be a must have every time we go) and a mexican inspired roll. Loved it. It was crowed (in a good way) so we asked to sit at the bar (even though we don't drink). Mary was nice and friendly,  even with the drink orders keeping her plenty busy. Totally worth it."}
{"text":"This place is fabulous! Something for everyone. We make it a point to take out of town family here. If you like sushi, its very freesh and i suggest asking for the senior sushi sauce for a little extra spice.   If you arent particularly fond of raw fish thry their carne asada roll which is cooked steak wrapped like a sushi roll.  The chicken cordon bleau is also amazing.   Not feeling any sushi-esk food, the fried rice and yakisoba noodles are on point.   They are generally pretty loud and their seems to be live music every eveneing. Fun spot with lots of energy.  I have to give special recognition to staff, i left my wallet there last time and they immediately stored it and i cane back and got it."}
{"text":"One of my coworker told me about this place, and what a great hidden gem. Great food, super service and very affordable prices perfect mix for a great restaurant. My recommendation try their carne Asada roll it's my favorite."}
{"text":"I love this sushi-mexican fusion. It is so not right. If you are a sushi snob, turn around you will not like this place.  If you want something new, exciting, a little spicy.... come here. I ordered the Kamakazie. It was not deep fried, a little spicy. It was filled with tempura shrimp, and spicy tuna.  On top was avocado, some type of pico/salsa. Amazing! We also ordered the wings with their homemade habanero salsa. Yesss."}
{"text":"Love this place! When it comes to sushi I'm not sure you can get more unique than this. Their Mexican infusion makes for a great experience and atmosphere. Staff is friendly and restaurant is very clean. Highly recommend to anyone visiting Arizona in the area, you won't get this experience anywhere else. I consider myself a sushi connoisseur of sorts and this is one of my top rated places in Arizona."}
{"text":"This place is really good and they're margaritas are delicious but it's way overpriced and they automatically add their tip to the check.. and for me and my husband it was $80! Just 2 of us! So if you are planning to eat here make sure to bring lots of money.  I would be here again but maybe 1-2 times a year."}
{"text":"The sushi was good but I've had better for much cheaper. Their Happy hour doesn't really have any rolls on it aside from a California roll which I call The Rookie roll. The drinks are cheaper on Happy hour but I wasn't here to drink I wanted good Sushi and not at $12 a roll. I'll take my business elsewhere for better Sushi at a cheaper price."}
{"text":"Good. But kinda greasy. Overall really enjoyed. Mexican family atmosphere with a mariachi hottie singing it out to you. Lol"}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday party, the staff was on point. Order was fast, staff friendly. I do feel it's a little pricey but I guess it's about average compared to other places. I still prefer a regular sushi place but it's not bad. I was really impressed how they handled our very large group."}
{"text":"My favorite spot for sushi... Love this place and  Pina Coladas taste just like the one's you buy in Vegas."}
{"text":"The \"manager\" there is the worst example of good leadership I have ever witnessed. I called this location after inquiring about using a coupon I had just obtained. The girl who answered the phone told me that she has to ask her manager if they would honor my coupon which clearly states I can use at this particular establishment. This piss poor manager gets on the phone and right away acknowledges the dining discount and then goes on to say that it is only honored at the Phoenix location. Little does he know that I was looking forward to trying this place for the first time. Horrible customer service from the top. Then again, there seems to be a lack of that at many of the restaurants in Mesa anyway...."}
{"text":"One word. Interesting. It was good. But definitely a new twist on sushi. We had a good time and the staff was attentive"}
