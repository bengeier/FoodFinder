{"text":"Absolutely love this place car hops are attentive and always friendly food is alway made fresh and delivered hot!!"}
{"text":"Holy. Guacamole. I didn't know places like this still existed. 1) Everything is VERY reasonably priced. 2) The waitress? Carhop? Is extremely attentive and quick. Despite having many other cars, she came to me right after I pulled up. She also made great suggestions. 

I got clam strips, sloppy joe, fish sandwich and a frozen banana. Fresh and delicious!

Don't go to McDonald's--places like these are where it's at! Go now!! You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Way better than Dog n Suds. Love their corn dogs! They're only open seasonal for obvious reasons but the food is good and staff is friendly."}
