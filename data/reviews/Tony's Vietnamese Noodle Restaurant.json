{"text":"Love their beef/chicken subs and bubble tea :) They have a huge selection of Vietnamese and Chinese food. The Pho is good too!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, super clean, friendly staff and never disappointed. Prices are fantastic too! Thanks Tony's!"}
{"text":"Decided to try Tony's last night and was not disappointed.
Prices were great, and serving sizes were even better.

We tried the Shrimp salad rolls, Grilled pork + shredded pork vermicelli, and the Shrimp pork chicken vermicelli.

Everything tasted great lots of meat and veggies to last the entire dish to the last bit. Our only criticism was that each order could come with more fish sauce as there was about enough for half the serving size. And there could be an extra shrimp or two in item 61.

I ordered for take out and food was hot and waiting for me when I arrived 15mins later. This will be out new go to Vietnamese restaurant."}
{"text":"As someone with a peanut allergy, I had never actually tried Vietnamese food before coming to Tony's. Fortunately for me, the staff here is very accommodating of allergies despite the prevalence of peanuts on the menu. This was a great introduction to Vietnamese food for me. I have so far tried three of their vermicelli noodle bowls: the pork, the beef sate, and the Super Combo, which includes beef, chicken, spring rolls, and shrimp. All of these have been absolutely delicious. The meat is fantastic, the veggies are fresh, crunchy, and flavourful, and the spring rolls are some of the best I've ever had. The sheer amount of food that you get for the price is fantastic; the noodle bowls cost between $9.50 and $10.50, and can easily be two meals worth of food. Be sure to try their Vietnamese iced coffee as well! 
While the table service can be a little lacking at times, the staff are all very friendly, and the food comes out just minutes after ordering. 
This is a great new restaurant for Airdrie, so be sure to check it out."}
{"text":"Good little Vietnamese joint.
Have eaten here a few times and haven't been disappointed yet."}
{"text":"Been here a few times. The first time we went it was really good. Second time they forgot to add my spring rolls to my dish. Third time my grilled short ribs were super chewy and tasted like it had been re-heated, rice was dry and tasteless. Went again today. My hubby ordered his dish with no carrots, nuts and sprouts because of medical issues. They did not remove them. I ordered the short ribs again with rice and spring rolls. It was supposed to be on rice, it came with noodles instead. The meat tasted like I was chewing on rubber bands. They didn't discount us for any of the mistakes they made and they were barely apologetic about it. The waiter is always rude. Always seems like he never wants to be there. Our money is better off spent elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great Vietnamese restaurant! Service is good and the food is amazing. I always order the chicken noodle soup and for the portion they give, I fill up fast."}
{"text":"I used Yelp to find a decent place for lunch for us when passing through airdrie. 

I asked if their food has MSG - the woman checked with the kitchen.  She said \"everything has MSG, sorry\" I was like, everything? not one single thing is free of MSG? \"yep\". 

So I ordered nothing while my husband ordered something as he is much less sensitive than I am. 

She came back to say that they could make spring rolls without MSG but that would be the only item they could make without MSG.  

I ordered that, but was super disappointed and it was not that great, especially as their hoisin sauce for dipping was sickeningly sweet, and my husband thought so too.

Service was nice, cannot say anything bad about that.   But very disappointed about the MSG in everything except literally one single boring appetizer item.  

Will not go back."}
{"text":"omg! BEST spring rolls i have ever had. they are a great size and soooo flavourful. the pork really adds great flavour. the pho was also really good but the spring rolls definitely did it for me. yum yum new fav!"}
{"text":"Amazing pho! Great food, massive portions, very low prices!!!

My personal favourite is #18. Broth has so much flavour and meat is so tender. Only thing I wish is that they had jalape√±os to drop in the pho."}
{"text":"Amazing. My Mom is allergic to canola and eggs and I'm allergic to gluten. The chef came out suggested dishes and worked with us to come up with yummy food. And did you catch that? YUMMY!!! The best Vietnamese food I have ever had!! And four of us were stuffed full for under $40. Go eat awesome food there!"}
{"text":"Very good food! All three of us ordered # 61. Good sized portions. Tastey flavours. Prices are great. 
Our waitress' English wasn't great - but she was friendly. 
I'll be back."}
{"text":"We were looking for something good and filling food.  We decided to go to Tony's a Vietnames restaurant.  Located in the south eastern part of an industrial part of Airdrie. 
I normally have the yummy soup , but this time we ordered # 61 a very filling noodle bowl pork, chicken, beef and shrimp with spring roll.  (What I call fully loaded bowl) for a appetizer we had the shrimp lettuce wrap.  
The price was good and  so was the friendly service.  In fact we have never had bad food here or service. Really worth the stop for lunch.  If you don't have the time to sit in,  take out is available.  

During lunch rush Parking is limited if you want to park close to the front, there's more parking on the side of the building."}
{"text":"With the continuation of the cold freeze in Alberta during the holidays, it was time for something warrrrrmmm.... and pho is always a great idea!  This time, we decided to check out this Vietnamese restaurant in Airdrie for a quick dinner, especially since I got off late from work.

Atmosphere:  3.5/5  Overall neat and spacious; glad to see lots of take out that night along with at least a few other tables.  It is located in the industrial area a bit out of the way from the city, but not inconvenient by any means.  There are only a few parking spaces in front of the restaurant but more along the side of the building complex.

Food: 4/5  Since I was really hungry, I enjoyed this large bowl of rare steak pho tremendously!  Great portion size and tasted delicious and really hot soup which I greatly enjoyed

Price: 4/5  good price for portion size

Service: 3/5  Overall efficient

Overall: 4/5  Overall a great vietnamese restaurant for a quick and filling supper especially in this cold weather!"}
{"text":"Not a great take out experience. Our delivery guy showed up very late, I had to call and make sure it was still coming. The soup was bland as was the  vermicelli and the meat in all meals was mostly pieces of fat. Fortunately all three meals ordered where edible however not very good. I won't be ordering from them again."}
{"text":"Was in area and love Vietnamese food. Gave this place a try and loved it. Got number 35 for take out it was delicious and a good size portion. Plus got the discount. Great food for great price."}
{"text":"Very good pricing. Clean and comfortable restaurant. Friendly service. I loved the Vietnamese sub."}
{"text":"I love this place. In my opinion it's the best Vietnamese in town. Very fresh and top quality ingredients."}
{"text":"Almost 2 hours for delivery. (Restaurant is 1.3km away) food arrived cold and was spilled in the bag."}
{"text":"I think I'm getting lucky lately, because I'm actually getting a lot of amazing restaurants with very few duds. Tony's is no exception.

Only open for a few weeks at the time of this review, I've both dined in and done take-out at Tony's. The first night, we sat in. The location is a bit out of the way for a lot of people, and you might get lost if you don't know the area - Tony's is located in a more industrial part of town, and takes up one of the bays in an commercial condo building. That being said, it's nice and big with lots of breathing room - there are high ceilings, bright walls, and GIGANTIC booths - ours was pre-set for 4, but could comfortably hold 6-8 people with no issues. If anything, parking was the hardest part, as, despite this being in an industrial area, there's a fitness center in another nearby unit, so there's plenty of activity at both the restaurant and gym around dinner time. 

Onto the food! The menu is pretty large, and worth checking out. Lots of the standard fare, so I opted to go with the Vermicelli bowl both nights with spring rolls, sprouts, and lemongrass chicken. The service wasn't the fastest, but for a new place that probably wasn't expecting a huge night-time crowd, they did well. The food showed up within 20 minutes of ordering, and the portions are massive. I probably could have split my bowl in 2 if I wasn't enjoying it so much. The spring rolls were easily my favourite part as well - so much so that I ordered an extra order for my take-out, and tried the deep fried dumplings as well (neither of which disappointed). 

Calling for take-out, the order was really easy to place (everything on the menu is numbered, so even if you can't say what you want, you can always just give them a number). I asked about delivery, but with the grand opening, the hostess reminded me that I'd save 15% on my bill if I picked it up myself, so I opted for that route so I could get the extra appetizer...a good decision for sure!

Tony's is delicious, authentic, and has friendly service. I'll happily be going back here again, and I'll try to take my friends here as well. Also of note - the menu asks you to alert the server of any allergies you might have, so this might be a good place to check into if you love Vietnamese but can't have nuts!"}
{"text":"Definitely not the same since the switch from the last owner. Threw most of my order away"}
{"text":"Delicious! Great menu. Everything tastes as good Pho should."}
{"text":"Tony's is pretty good and it's a good amount of food for a good price but it's not my favorite Vietnamese in Airdrie, and it's one of my last places to order from. I find I prefer a clean clear flavour in my broth and when I had theirs it was a bit murky and had a bit too much salt and a bit too much star anise. If that's your deal, then this place is for you! (saying this with no sarcasm, I know people who prefer this type over the place I favour). I did have an issue with takeout once where they forgot my entire meal and then tried to compensate me by giving me 3 free spring rolls but still making me pay for my meal and extra delivery fee."}
{"text":"First time fabulous service and food was amazing we had a # 29 and 61 flavour was great food was hot and served hot"}
{"text":"Good food, friendly family business.  Pho is really yummy, as are most things on the menu.  Good for a quick meal with the family and take out."}
