{"text":"Food above average. Service on the patio neglectful. Old and musty inside with old carpeting and furnishings. Found a seat on a patio on busy weekday evening around 6pm, had to wander inside to find all the waitstaff clustered around the bar sharing a laugh. Still hadn't been offered a drink after sitting for around 10 minutes outside. Inside smells mouldy. DON'T visit the bathrooms, pretty raunchy. Always imagined their kitchen is like one of those Hell's Kitchen episodes where Gordon Ramsay nearly throws up when he finds how they store and prepare food. Can't get over the smell inside... (and yes, as other reviewers mentioned, have been on the weekend for brunch and you will enjoy it IF you like eating with squealing children running around). Try something else in the area, lots of other choices."}
{"text":"Friendly and accommodating staff. Avoid Aristotle & McGregor's, and come here instead!"}
{"text":"decent food.  great service.

the food is 2.5 stars.  service is 4 star.  if i could i'd give this place 3.5 stars.  

i've been here a number of times for breakfast.  nothing spectacular but solid and reasonably priced.  good coffee.  been there for dinner and drinks.  outside of their specials the food is a bit pricey for pub grub.  

service has always been good.  even with the newbie waitress.  the staff is friendly and the manager tries to make people happy.  

they have a big patio and lots of tables inside.  casual modern atmosphere.  i have no problem recommending the place if you are in the neighborhood.  i wouldn't go out of my way to go there."}
{"text":"I don't normally review places in my neighbourhood but our latest experience here screams out to be heard. Have frequented the Longest Yard for years, not often, but 2-3 times a year. We attended the Regent theatre for a Hot Docs film so thought we would pop in for a bite to eat. You would think they would have taken advantage of the traffic in the area as a result of the film festival. No specials, no sign - Welcome festival goers! They do make a mean lamb burger, but everything else is average including the plastic patio furniture. We sat down, waiter brought menus without much of a greeting. My husband went to the washroom, waiter came and took my drink order without bothering to wait for him or asking what he might like. We ordered - waiter made no attempt at small talk. My husband ordered a second beer, but waiter didn't bother to ask me if I would like another glass of wine. When he came back with beer, I ordered a second wine, but by the time he brought it, husband was done his beer. One of our glasses always seemed to be empty. He never bothered to ask us how our dinners were. Heard him complaining how hard he was working to another staff - 6 days in a row - can you imagine how difficult that would be? he's lucky to have a job.  He was servicing only 2 or 3 couples when we were there. Had to ask him for the bill. No 'thanks, have a nice evening'. Never smiled once. Lots of other restaurants in the neighbourhood who I'm sure would like our money. We won't ever go back."}
{"text":"If there's one word to describe The Longest Yard, it would be reliable. It's not the best food you've ever tasted, but if what you're looking for is a beer and some good 'ol pub fare, this is what you will get here. Situated at the corner of Mount Pleasant and Belsize, this pub has a family-friendly feeling while retaining the ambiance of a sports bar at the same time.

The menu consists of your usual pub fare (wings, ribs, burgers), and also has some unique choices (souvlaki plate, grilled salmon, chili). There are also a few vegetarian options (veggie burger, avocado and brie sandwich, vegetarian chili). 

Friendly service, has a nice patio, selection of beers on tap, reasonable prices, nothing negative to say about this place!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is really not good. The reviews are obviously posted by either employees or long time customers/freinds of the owners. I was in recently, first time I'd tried it and the food was well below mediocre, overpriced, the service was slow and terrible. The look of the room is really outdated and resembles more of a gutted office with a few chairs and tables thrown in. I was really disappointed with the whole experience and will never go here again.

Fun fact: If you like food trucks, you can thank the owner of this restaurant for playing a huge role in keeping them out of Toronto. She's afraid fo the competition and her business quality explains why."}
{"text":"I love the longest yard I have been going here for years! They have a really good veggie burger! I really suggest the nachos. 
They are very friendly and welcoming"}
{"text":"Our go-to burger place... organic beef... quick service... good beer.  A win win... win."}
{"text":"I signed up for yelp specifically to write this review. It'll be short and not so sweet. 

We waited 20 mins before we were given menus or able to give our drink order. One full inning of the blue jays game. When our server did come - she rushed away, missing our used plates and cups - just breezed by, asked if we were ok, didn't wait for the answer then went to serve the bigger tables with families and kids. Forgot about us.
  
Food was ok. Had the fish cakes but left after appies bc the service was so poor. 

We just moved to the area and are very loyal customers. Disappointed that it was so crap. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best. Have been there three times and each experience gets worse. Once we were seated on the patio where it was swarming with bees; most recently the entire inside reeked of cigarette smoke. So, ambiance is certainly lacking. Prices are not great for the quality of the food. Totally lacking in flavour or inspiration. Chicken sandwich was bland, hamburger was dry and just \"meh.\" Not planning a return trip anytime soon."}
{"text":"I'd been eyeing this place for the better part of the last year, walking by without going inside, and today - while out drinking with a friend -  I finally got to visit. 

We opted to eat inside as opposed to the patio, which was fairly full. Decor was nice and neat, and service was very good.

The food: I had the lamb burger, while my friend tackled the calamari po boy sandwich. First of all, I don't know what these guys used to season the fries beside salt, but they were delicious. 

As for my burger - it was great. The meat - and the seasoning - was so savoury. The dip was great, and the bun was nice and buttery. My friend loved her sandwich, but was so full she couldn't finish.

Nice place. I'd definitely come back."}
{"text":"Decemburger Discord.

Having just read my dining partner, Shari \"I'm full\" M's review, I need to clarify a few things:

1.  The outside does look posh.  But the inside is actually kind of lame.  On the plus side, it's definitely low-key.  But there was something about the row of tables (about 12) sitting mostly empty and running straight down the center of the dining room that made me feel like we were crashing a really lame private party.

2.  The saucy fingers (some call them Buffalo Chicken Strips) were awesome indeed.  Try the \"Hot and Spicy\" sauce - it's a little something different.  Onion rings were also fab.  Fries were great.  The burger, however, sucked.  Thank god I had gone for cilantro salsa, Monterey Jack cheese and guacamole on mine - these toppings were delicious and rescued the dry, slightly-tough-on-one-end, I-don't-care-if-it's-organic patty.  Also, the bun was a bit soft by the time I got to it.*

3.  Our server was a darling.  To clarify, she wasn't checking in in an annoying way, but rather in a conscientious, want-to-make-sure-you're-enjoying-your-stay way.  We had, after all, ordered three meals between us (by which I mean Shari paid lip service to the fingers and rings that I all but demolished, and we each had a burger and fries).  It took us a while to get to our burgers, and I noted at the time that our server made an extra stop after that point to make sure everything was good.**

If I were to judge the place by the burger, it'd be three stars for sure.  But overall, this is a four-star joing and I'm confident enough in the rest of what I saw from the kitchen that I'll be back to try some more.

* If you like well-done organic burgers, disregard my 'beef.'
** Actually, I think our server fell victim to my boyish charm and kept coming back for a little more of it."}
{"text":"went over with some friends,beer was warm and expensive, food was bad and very expensive, better places in the area, your not a big franchise so dont act like one."}
{"text":"They treat the locals right here.  Great environment for kids, with a decent and affordable kids menu, and a balloon at the end!

Affordable, consistent dishes.  Not exactly overly inventive menu here, but I think for the clientele that come here, that's exactly what they are looking for.

Nice place for a casual dinner or a quick pint.

Feels like home. :)"}
{"text":"Atmosphere:
Nice patio outside on Mt. Pleasant south of Eglinton and off a side street. We did not get a chance to look inside but it did seem clean and orderly though. No complaints.

Food: 
My wife had a filet of grilled chicken served on a wheat bun and a tossed salad with a mini cup of dill dressing on the side. The Salad was ok. The chicken was a bit on the dry side with charred edges, she said it tasted allright. But then again my wife isn't picky (or else she would not be married to me).The way it was done leads me to belive that this joint serves 90% burgers with fries so a certain just-throw-it-on-the-grill-routine cannot be denied here, during a sunny lunch period on the patio in particular.  

There was a $0.50 charge for preparing the chicken with cajun style bbq sauce without which there was a likelihood it may have gotten stuck half way down. Charging pennies for a sauce add-on is a major faux-pas in a restaurant because it communicates unnecessary penny-pinching attitude. I Have not seen this sort of thing since eating nuggets once at a McDonalds Express in Detroit on a student trip to Cancun. Positively not cool.

I had the grilled salmon with mixed veggies and rice served with a corn-tomato-chutney. It sounded appetizing... 
Presentation was fair but, alas, the dish was somewhat disappointing,
made lovelackingly and without any creative inspiration to it. Dry rice,
dry broccoli, dry cauliflower. This is a real shame because the salmon was actually cooked quite nicely. The problem I had is that it would have been so easy to save it by cooking the veggies to at least \"al dente\" instead of near-raw, and adding a jus of lemon and dill or a savvy hollandaise-style sauce or dressing to bring the vegetables and rice to life. Or even dare to make a risotto which always fares better than just plain boiled Uncle Ben's. Any kind of fresh herb would also have gone a long way for a close to $15 dish. 

Service:
We got menus quickly and fountain drinks/water were there fast.
The waiting time for the meal was tad on the long side, mind you there was a party of 12 sitting at the other table and it seemed quite busy around noontime. All within reason. The service gets a boost of a half-star plus because the manager took the salmon off the bill without making any fuss. Perhaps they need to take it off the menu alltoghether if they can't improve it. 

Price:
Reasonable for this area.

Overall experience:
We may come here again but probably only for beers and burgers.
The service saved our boring dishes. 
Last word:
Bar fare seems to be the Longest Yard's strongest suit. Go-go-grease!"}
{"text":"A great pub offering more than your typical grub. Menu offers a variety of dishes, from lasagna to souvlaki, and I have never been dissappointed with any of the dishes I've ordered. Nice covered outdoor patio available in the summer."}
{"text":"Still a fan of The Longest Yard. I feel the need to update to share more interesting facts about this spot: 
- they have frozen cocktails! Highly recommend the strawberry daiquiri 
- like most Toronto restaurants, their bathrooms are in the basement. They have the towel that you yank on and it is supposed to give you a clean few inches of towel. I thought this type of hand dryer was eliminated in the mid 80's?! 
- when you go down to the bathroom, they have an old sit down and drive video game....maybe they get lots of bathroom lineups?! 
- credit cards accepted, no debit. Debit machine is in basement next to video game 
- great place to go to with a group of friends 
- most of the clientele are older, not a hipster or young crowd. So - make it your own hipster/young crowd!! Start a new trend!!"}
{"text":"Great food & easy going atmosphere. Couldn't find a menu online but was pleasantly surprised by the selection and quality. Posting photos of the menu now for the world to see :)"}
{"text":"Great pub. Very kid friendly. Usually Neighbourhood clients. Been going for years. Will continue going for years..."}
{"text":"We were in the area on a beautiful Saturday afternoon and was looking for a good patio brunch restaurant. We decided to come to here for its distance.  The food took a while to come (20-30) minutes. 

We ordered eggs Benedict and French toast. It was decent but nothing spectacular."}
{"text":"i don't know what the rave is about... yes kid friendly pub, but no ambiance, food was so-so... staff was so-so...  meh.."}
{"text":"This is a pub but with a bit of family-restaurant atmosphere at the same time, especially at brunch time.  The place looks clean and the decor is cute, with a couple of old school video games scattered around. 

Sunday brunch is pretty popular, with most dishes coming in just under $10.  I wouldn't say that any of it is anything to write home about, but at the same time it's all good and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Came here this afternoon due to proximity to my gym. Since I read so many great reviews, I suppose my expectations were too high for this place.

I ordered the Summer Salad (Asian Sesame Dressing) with a piece of chicken souvlaki on top. It was edible, but nothing to write home about.

The service was 'meh.' I understand that they were busy, but it was very hard to get anyone's attention when we wanted to pay for the meals or get a refill on water.

The Highlights:
- Bottomless soft drinks
- Free one hour street parking (which the LY is in no way responsible for)
- Extensive menu with items ranging from salads to burgers

A solid 2 stars."}
{"text":"A regular place to take my father for lunch. He's happy with the \"regular\"  (all day breakfast or peameal bacon sandwich) -- and there are so many other choices for me :). 

Looking forward to having the Prime Rib Dip today and it will go well with Steamwhistle."}
