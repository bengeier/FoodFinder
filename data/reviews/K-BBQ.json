{"text":"Finally a Korean restaurant in the West Island!!!!Beautiful decorated authentic restaurant and food. Family owned and operated so service is a little slow but understandable. Very friendly staff. Definitely authentic Korean with grills built into table, complete with side dishes, lettuce, rice, sauces which were delicious, and they also give you a soup which was nice. Meats and Vegetables very very fresh and not overly marinated."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I live in LA where we have a lot of Korean BBQ places and this is one of the best I have ever tried. The main reason, their meat is top quality and you taste it. Everything is super fresh. They also have a very nice staff. Highly recommend it. The lamb, rib eye and bulgolgi were my favorite!"}
{"text":"5 star all you can eat korean BBQ.  I enjoyed it every time 
They serve 4 welcome side dishes taste very good
BBQ meat is well prepared and seasoned.  So many choices and other korean dishes.  Unlike other buffet place, all dishes and choices are authentic in good portion 
Food is absolutely 5 star 

Excellent service and speed.  Restaurant is clean. 
Keep up the good work! Best secret place in West Island!"}
{"text":"The food is quite decent. The service is appreciable, the only thing is at the end we were like\"pushed out\" of the place cuz they need the table, even we didn't have time to finish the ice cream.Disapointed"}
{"text":"Great for groups. Like fondue but with a grill. Many choices on the all you can eat menu. Fried chicken is amazing. Authentic ramen is also included."}
{"text":"This was a unique and different place!  They have a nice setup for grilling your own meat. I had two tables going one for 'a la carte' and the other for 'all you can eat'.  Service was great at both tables.  Enjoyed very much the side dishes and the lettuce roll-ups, very healthy.   Price was really good too.  Overall a very nice experience."}
{"text":"One of the most awesome places to eat in the West Island ! Love the service and the food ! We had a really great time and were able to find a place without reservation. I had shrimp and it tasted really good!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! 

I've been here twice now will keep coming back whenever I'm feeling that Korean BBQ craving. Meat is fresh, high quality and there is a good selection! 

I really want to write this review because I hate knowing that a 1 star review/rant about the weather as the first thing people see on Yelp when you search K-BBQ. It isn't a fair review in the slightest and should not be the first impression that people get when they look up K-BBQ.

The restaurant is located in a beautify old stone house and offers a very unique Korean BBQ. If it weren't for the BBQs at each table you could probably walk in and think it was a French bistro. Yes old houses= less insulation so it won't be as warm as if it was in a newly built building but to insinuate near hypothermia is a huge exaggeration. I can get super technical with the science behind heat retention....but this is a restaurant review not a lab report.

So in case you aren't aware (clearly the Yelp Elite member was not) Korean BBQ is a concept where you order uncooked meat and then grill it yourself at your table (there is a big round grill at the center of each table). It is usually all you can eat for a fixed price, think all you can eat sushi but with good quality meat. It is a simple concept but when done right is fun, interactive, and delicious! 

 If you do go to a Korean BBQ restaurant I would highly suggest getting what they are known for, not one of the filler items that are on there just in case someone doesn't want BBQ in your group.

 The best way to explain it is by thinking about an all you can eat sushi restaurant. 95% of the menu is sushi but there is always 5% other Japanese or even other Asian dishes, just in case someone doesn't eat sushi but comes with friends.

 K-BBQ similarly has a few classic Korean menu items that aren't Korean BBQ (raw meat you have to cook) , but to write a review about a restaurant after only trying the Bibimbap, is very unfair. There are Korean restaurants that don't do BBQ and focus on classic Korean dishes like Bibimbap, if that is more what you want I can recommend 2-3 great places but don't go to a Korean BBQ restaurant then. It is like going to a steakhouse, having a house salad and then complaining because it isn't as delicious as that salad you had at Mandy's 2 weeks ago...

K-BBQ is great Korean BBQ because out of the many places I've been to in MTL, it has one of the best selections and the meat is some of the freshest I've seen. You can tell they don't have everything pre cut like other restaurants in MTL. 

I really hope a lot of people vote/like this review just so it surpasses the rant that is currently the #1 review. I really don't like that I am calling out a fellow yelpers but seriously... before writing something, take a step back, a deep breath wait a day to collect your thoughts and don't shit on a restaurant because you were cold and tried the equivalent of the house salad.... 

Especially considering he is a Yelp Elite member."}
{"text":"Love this place! The food is amazing and fresh! The Staff are so accommodating and sweet! They even play with my son when he's done eating so my husband and I can finish!"}
{"text":"Being the first k-bbq joint in West-Island, I was excited to try this place out! 

Coming on a Sunday evening, we were seated fairly quickly despite the place being packed. The staff were very pleasant and checked on us often to make sure everything was okay. The food variety and selection were about the same as other Korean bbq places, but included all you can drink soft drinks as well.

Although on the menu it's stated that some meats were marinated, when we received them (beef slices and ribs), they were hardly marinated and lacked some flavour. Luckily some sauces were provided (sesame and salt, and pepper paste), but did not include soy sauce surprisingly. They also provided lettuce, however they were not as fresh, seeing the ends really dried up. While their bibimbap tasted ok, the presentation can be improved as it looked like they just tossed the ingredients of side dishes in the bowl, with an over cooked egg and not enough veggies. On the other hand, their fried chicken was pretty tasty. 

Overall, although some dishes were simply okay, and the staff was great, the majority of the food disappointed me a little. If they added more marinade and use more fresh ingredients, I would give this place another shot."}
{"text":"This was a pleasant experience. Cooking your food at your very own table. Mixing in salmon, steak, calamari, onions on the grill at your own pace. On top of that it being all you can eat. All of this for a decent price. I will definitely be going back again. Service was a bit slow however but they just opened up so it is understandable"}
{"text":"Food was good, service was fast. Only unfortunate thing was we were rushed out near the end of our meal. Fair enough they had another reservation but waitress was a bit abrupt about it.

Otherwise sides were very fresh and flavourful and quality/variety of food to grill was great for all you can eat."}
{"text":"Very nice staff. Will tell you what they are bringing you and how to cook it.

Many food choices.

Very nice restaurant addition to the West Island.

Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Mixed Feelings. Cooking's the fun part.
We got almost everything from the all you can eat menu.
Kept confusing the raw and cooked tongs, dangerous.

Missed the $1.25 lamb skewers on the back of the menu, we just skimmed through it instead of looking properly.
Thin meat slices on grill were hard to cook evenly as they would curl, break, and get overcooked.
Thick was easy to handle.
Thin salmon got destroyed into little pieces on the grill :(
AAA Rib Eye almost no meat, but tender. Sadly no patience to cook my favorite cartilage until edible, not a good idea to have just one choice that takes long to cook, since it would get mixed with the raw faster cooking meats on the same grill. 
Not fun peeling the shrimp, but half the table didn't mind.
Vegs were a waste since the grill's a flat plate with a few holes. Didn't occur to us to mix the vegs with the meat while grilling! Should have done that.
Dipping sauces were bad. Brown was too bitter for me, half my table liked it.  Dark liquid sauce was bland. No other sauces available, made me sad. Need more sauces, like spicy! Shameful for Korea. Only the Kimchi was spicy :(

*slaps the owner* NO! You do not give ketchup for spring rolls! Wtf! Lol
Reg mayo for the mysterious korean sushi \"vegetable kimbap\"?! At least make it spicy mayo! The sushi rice was very soft, mushy, ruined :( but the crunchy part inside was great! as well as the flavorful crab fish and omelet :)

Gave us all our side dishes when seated, which were gone before the actual food arrived :( No one listened, so because I waited, I missed out. My table talked me out of re-ordering them, said they weren't good but I should have because they're meant to be eaten in between and with the main food! I ordered what I recognized, which was the kimchi & daikon, which were tasty. I'd be happy to each have our own side dishes in a divided personal plate, like the double sauce. The single plates took up too much room on the table for the little they had in them, and had to keep reordering so many times for our group :(

Upset that we didn't notice till later that the lettuce was for wrapping the food with white rice. There's no white rice on the menu, so we missed out on the korean experience & the advantage of their side dishes. Put that suggestion on top of the menu!

We're dumb, didn't know our meat cuts, so we just ordered everything. Be nice to see an animal outline diagram pic. We couldn't tell the difference between what we liked and didn't like. In general, I only liked the thick meats, not the thin. My group liked pretty much everything though, except for the porc belly because the fat didn't melt away enough. My mom was happy to see ox tongue :)

I was the only one who hated the inside of the dumplings.

I screamed when the whole baby octopus wiggled on the grill! So embarrassing xp Tasted boring since there was no sauce.
The calamari was excellent. Not what I expected, and not what I would call calamari. But it's texture was really nice, and I love how they cut it. Cool to see it roll up on the grill.

\"Rice&Noodles\" boring.
We didn't expect these were not shareable dishes :( menu needs more details!
Korean ramen was just noodles & red broth. Didn't occur to us to add our grilled veggies & meat into it.
The myuns were nice cold noodle soups which would have been a refreshing treat if we were eating spicy food, so waste.
Didn't know bibimbap was their veg bibimbap sushi just mixed together in a bowl. Awkward to share. Tasted ok.
Didn't know veg bibimbap was their sushi picture we were looking for lol no details on menu -,-*

Tender but not memorable fried chicken. Needs good dipping sauce!
Cute to have fries on the menu for kids, but skip!
\"Buns\" was in the same section as fried entrees. Should be in the desert section. Was expecting a meat bun or something :(

Unexpected fancy ice cream plating :) 
Didn't understand that the waitress was trying to explain to us that we don't need new plates for desert (pineapple boring on flat gril, could have used cinnamon), cuz the ice cream plates also had a big flat surface around the bowl. Very new to me. Ice cream was very tasty. Disappointed for the no crushed nuts like on the wall picture. Chocolate syrup awkward with mango ice cream though. Cute delightful half frozen cranberry on top :) Ice Cream tastes great with a hot \"Bun\" together, like another version of ice cream and hot brownies. Buns like a pastry donut & covered in a simple canned sweetened condensed milk.

Might come back to try the BeefBoneSoup. Seen it on youtube, been looking for it!

The decor inside was like a deli, which was very strange for korean but explains the ketchup&mayo

Our meal was unorganized and a waste of a first experience, which is a bit of a shame for 40$ each (tip/tax inc). Would have made a better imprint if it was set up in a way where it was idiot proof. Not very interested to come back. At least be spicy! Wtf \"Korea\" ?! ALOT of potential if they made some changes though."}
{"text":"Lots choice of meat! I also love all the pickle side dishes! Service was great too. Overall love it and its in west island!"}
