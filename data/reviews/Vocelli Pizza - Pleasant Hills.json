{"text":"Probably more like 2.5 stars, benefit of the doubt as they are a pizza joint and I ordered wings and pasta.

The wings were excellent, the pasta was as bad as the wings were delicious. 
Chicken Alfredo was pure crap, small amount of dry chicken (arguably that could be the good about it), the noodles were overcooked - mushy - and the \"sauce\" was almost nonexistent and tasted like cornstarch in water, literally. 
Wings were garlic romano, excellent taste and done perfectly. 
In town on business, will order from here again to try the pizza (and more wings), update rating a star or 2 if pizza is as good as the wings.

*update - another one of the guys from our group tried the pizza, compared it to those \"english muffin pizzas you make when you're a broke but stoned college student\" .... so while I've never had one of those, I do know that munchies are the beer goggles of food.... won't be ordering from here, and 2 stars remain."}
{"text":"I order food from this location at least once a week while I am at work.  The people on the phone are very nice.  They are almost always faster than they say they will be and the delivery man I usually get is great.  He always makes sure my order is correct before he leaves the store.  He actually brought me a drink one time even though I didn't order it.  When he gave it to me said don't you usually get a drink?  Big thumbs up to their entire staff."}
{"text":"This has become our go to pizza place. I love there crust and all there specialty pizzas seem to have there own seasoning on the crust (I think I've had all the specialties). There pasta is ok and there zucchini needs more if a crunchy batter but its still ok.  The delivery people are always nice and friendly (I think he prob doesn't even have to gps my house anymore.) and it may take up to an hour sometimes for the pizza to get here but it's always hot and fresh. Had a forgotten soda once but i hot a free one next time. Really good place."}
{"text":"They truly go out of there way.  I ordered from here several times,  just got a note in the mail from them with a for a free pizza, stating sorry we were late delivering.  I don't even remember them being late."}
{"text":"This was the first time we tried Vocelli. Tired of the chain pizza garbage, this was a great choice! Awesome pizza, fresh salad, and the Vocelli rolls were incredible! We had a bit of a wait (about 50 minutes) but it was a Friday night. Reasonable prices. I would not hesitate to order again."}
{"text":"Not bad. Got meat magnificent and habenero wings. Enjoyed both of them. Also I was on travel so delivery was convenient. Solid meal."}
{"text":"Nice pizza place. Quick if you pick it up but they take long to deliver from past purchases. This time around I got a reg pie with pepperoni. It was pretty good"}
{"text":"Another typical pizza place.  Nothing special and it's always the crust that falls short out here.  Cheese sauce and toppings are ok.  Pepperoni is dry, small and usually over cooked.  Would order again when the pizza fix is needed but still looking for a NY style pizza place."}
{"text":"We tried Vocelli's for the first time tonight and found it to be great! The guy who answered the phone spoke clearly, listened well, and our order was correct! We were told 30 - 45 minutes for delivery but our order arrived in about 25 minutes. We ordered the Hunger Buster, large one topping pizza, one hoagie, bread sticks, and a 2 liter of soda. The pizza was hot, as in fresh out of the oven HOT! and the pepperoni topping was just curled and crisped, the hoagie was on a fresh bun and it didn't have a greasy river pouring off it, the bread sticks were exactly that, bread sticks. They took freash dough and baked it till a crust on the outside but still soft on the inside them covered it in garlic butter and parmesan cheese. For $25.00 it was a meal for two days! Will definitely be calling them again!"}
