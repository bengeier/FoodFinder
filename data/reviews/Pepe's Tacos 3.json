{"text":"I am from New Mexico so I have ridiculously low standards for Mexican food out of the state but even I was a little disappointed after reading the reviews of how great the food was. I had a bean and cheese burrito and the first thing I pulled out of it was a huge hunk of meat which was pretty gross. I'm guessing the refried beans were made with ham hocks from the presence of meat and the fact it tasted like it had been soaked in meat juice- it was easily the worst I've ever had. It didn't taste like a bean and cheese burrito, it tasted like meat flavored bean paste.  Also the cheese wasn't melted.  Perhaps I ate there on an off day. The chips were okay but I've easily had better bagged chips from the grocery store.  The salsa was alright, a little too much for red chili taste for my liking, but it wasn't the worst I've had.  Salsa tends to be quite variable if it isn't bottled and I think that was the case with this salsa. I wouldn't eat there again, but everyone I was with seemed to enjoy their food so maybe I am just picky."}
{"text":"The food was very tasty! I love buche and Lengua it was good. I also got the Chile Relleno burrito it was ok."}
{"text":"When my girl goes to order she seems to get the best fat burritos and tacos. 

When I order I get the cold burrito and the only fat I get is on the meat.

Pineapple drink is always on point though!"}
{"text":"When you're from LA like me, it's hard to imagine that any other place has great Mexican food, but omg, this place has fish tacos that are nothing short of incredible. 'Nuf said, order the fish tacos!!
  The asada burrito was also excellent, very filling and just spiced enough to get your attention but the fresh cilantro mellowed it out.  
  A very high recommendation. 4.5+"}
{"text":"Very upset ordered our food $30 worth got a number 15 people behind us the order person called out numbers people walk up and they did not check numbers they just gave food away Hispanic people are stealing from there own from the order taker to the customers needless to say I walk up ask for food they say it's almost done because I'm white American he did not think I new Spanish we prose had to make are food again we had to wait longer and again they thought we were stupid maybe white Americans should go to robertos just because they get it right.j tried to ask for manager a person comes up and acts like nothing happened they blew us off 45 minutes later we are walking out good bye pepes"}
{"text":"Had the goat meat for the first time and LOVED IT. Did find a small bone so be careful but the flavor it worth a second try. The staff was nice and willing to help me understand what words I didn't understand on the menu."}
{"text":"I stumbled on to this place when I was trying to find a nearby Church's chicken (don't go to the one near here btw) and I just got to say the street tacos are delicious!

When I first moved here, every taco place I tried was just awful and flavorless. 

This place really hits the spot if you are looking for a good carne asada taco.  They are a bit on the pricey side, but you can't find better nearby.

The salsa is always stocked and fresh.  The staff is friendly.  Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"First visit to Pepe's Tacos. Had the super nachos. Was great only thing I would change and its just personal preference I would not put as many beans. Also had Beef Taquito plate. These were the best I tasted in Vegas. They were made fresh. Wife had the Birria (Marinated Goat Meat). She had the soup version. Since I don't ever recall eating goat I took a taste test and almost wanted to trade dinners lol. Mom had the usual Carne Asada Burrito which again I tasted and again I have no complaints. This was my first visit and it will not be my last visit guaranteed."}
{"text":"My first time having a Lengua Burrito and it definitely won't be my last. The staff was friendly, place was spotless, and my food was not only good but generous. My hubby had the Al Pastor plate and had to bring some home which never happens. This place is beyond great."}
{"text":"I am a comfortable regular due to geography.  I have never had to wait long for reasonably priced food that never touched a fryer; it's always exactly what I wanted/expected, it's satisfying and for all that seems like chaos in the late hours of night or early in the morning ... they have never let me down.  Time to say \"Thanks!\" in the way that counts ... through internet media.  I rate the five stars for price-value, speed, service, and exactness."}
{"text":"People are trippin' for givin' this place bad stars. This place is absolutely delicious. My go to place to get some mexican food, except for my mexican family."}
{"text":"ate here today. i ordered a super carne asada burrito w/ chips and salsa. the meat was too chewy BUT it had really good flavor. as usual, i wasn't into the refried beans at all but everything else in there was good. when my order came up i went to grab it and was confused when i saw chips on the plate with my burrito as well as a whole separate plate of chips. my guess is that chips come with the burrito, which is something i'm not used to outside of the bay area. so that definitely separates this place from the others in town. they also gave me an empty cup with my order of chips which was obviously for salsa but there are cups at the salsa bar so i don't know what the point of that was. i saw it when i walked up and thought \"oh they must give you a special salsa you can't get at the salsa bar when you order chips and salsa\" but the cup was empty. (i don't actually care about the chips and salsa confusion, that shit was delicious and the more chips the merrier. i'm just bored and felt like boring you with my chips and salsa thoughts) also, i dug the flat screens playing a dvd of people making chile rellenos. made me want one."}
{"text":"I have seen this place many times and decided to make a stop. What I found was a menu that had more than your usual taco and burrito. That's right, I ordered Birria. Goat. Let me tell you, the bowl came with lots of meat and the broth was good. Add the rice with some onions and celantro and every bite was great. The place did not smell greasy. The guacamole was freaking fresh and buttery with no seasonings to add with it. I have tasted the burrito and loaded nachos and it's not the same as others. I was satisfied. I hear this place gets busy so come early."}
{"text":"Pretty decent Mexican food, wish they had chipotle sauce. Meat is pretty clean not too much fat. I'll definitely come back for a second helping."}
{"text":"Why the fuck do you ask me if I want everything and when I tell you no salsa roja so why the fuck u still give me my tacos with salsa roja order 3 ckn 3 asada n 1 carnitas taco.. you supposedly fix my oder but now I got 3 ckn 2 asada n 1 carnitas tacos. We're the fuck is my other taco. You make me wait so you can fix mi order just to fuck it up again. I'm surprised they didn't forget my Chiles toreados like they always do.. They use to be a good place to eat but they just fucking up now"}
{"text":"Overpriced is what would best describe this place...each year they just keep raising the price little by little until you realise what your getting isnt even enough to be worth that price...what bothers me is not just the price but the fact that the portion size has decreased by half... So they want you to pay more and get less... Ive been coming here for years and have brushed of the price but the past few time the amount of food I get is ridiculous ... Carne asada fries use to be 6 bucks now they are like 10 and they serve you half of what the actual serving size use to be, less meat, lrss fries,less cheese less everthing ...  Not worth it at all and they have been doing this for months now not just once so im done with them ."}
{"text":"The tacos are really good and the burrito is big enough for 2! A little pricy for Mexican food but it taste good!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Their carne asada combo buritto is soooo yummy! I love their salsa too. I do have to say that I have had days that I went there and the meat was a little bland  and dry, but for the most part, it is usually delicious!! Give it a try if you love mexican food, you won't be let down!"}
{"text":"I'm originally from Chicago and I had a hard time finding good Mexican food but I found it at Pepe's. I have called in and walk in to place my orders and they and always fast and accurate. A must try. I love this place"}
{"text":"Bueno esta es mi primera experiencia es Pepes Tacos y la verdad es que por el precio que hemos pagado esta bien.
Los encurtidos crujientes y sabrosos, el Burrito Combinado abundante y muy bueno, la asada fries buena y los jugos frescos..
Posiblemente vuelva otro dia.

Nota discordante:  podrian aprovechar para limpiar los desperdicios cuando no hubiesemos personas cenando , ya que es desagradable que llegue el olor del producto limpiador a la mesa donde comes.

Pero bueno ya sab√©is... Id, provad y opinad."}
{"text":"Okay! Pepes tacos! I used to go to Rigos Tacos in N.town (Las Vegas) but this place is so much closer to my house.. I tried it and was hooked! The meat is like the street vendors deliciously marinated and cooked on a meat rotary!.. The size of the tacos are perfect! Not too big not too small! 2 tortillas w/perfect amount of meat to make 2 tacos out of 1. The salsa bar is the best! The green sauce is a must try. All u can have limes! (Not stingy) goes perfect w/the tacos!

Authentic tacos is all I can say!! Can't go anywhere else for them!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, bad location. 
The food from pepe's tacos is far more superior in taste and quality than any other mexican restaurant that i have tried. Will agree that this location is in a pretty rough location with lots of unpleasant people around. But hey im the to go guy so 4 stars is fair."}
{"text":"I highly recommend the carne asada super burrito. I get it every time and the quality is always on point. The meat has a great flavor and never has gristle or fat. The atmosphere is... well... lacking. We've seen someone have a medical emergency, somebody walk through the dining area rambling and yelling and tonight the door was opened for us by a very polite, but most likely homeless, gentlemen. That being said we still come here every time we go through Vegas. The food is GOOD! Get it to go if you're uncomfortable, but get it. The staff is warm and helpful and man do they know what they are doing with good, quality, authentic Mexican food!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed their carne asada tacos on many occasions. One time I must have went while a band was playing and it was a fun experience. It's cool to see local Mexican families & their children enjoy some authentic Mexican food at a very reasonable price."}
{"text":"This is my go to place for good authentic Mexican food here in the valley. My boy friend who is from Hawaii would always say Roberto's tacos is great mexican food and I would always argue with him how it was not. His mind changed once I took him back home to the bay area with me to try some great mexican food. Then, of course, he had to find a place that would be as close as possible to what we got in california and I didn't think we would ever find a restaurant here in Vegas like back home. But what do you know, someone told him about Pepe's taco and since we tried it we have been hooked! Needless to say the food in the bay still beats this place, Pepe's is number one in our book as long as we are here living in Vegas!"}
{"text":"The best mexican food in vegas! I always love getting the taquittos de pollo! I also love the carne asada fries! I highly recommend coming here if you love authentic mexican food."}
{"text":"I finally gave this place a chance. I been a few times and never stayed and ordered. FInally, gave it a chance when I saw they have a 4 Taco and a Drink special for $7 on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Granted its a little pricey but very well worth it. Its very clean inside and the menu pops right in front of you. Big bold yellow board lol. They have the typical menu you see in most places like Roberto's, Fausto's.....etc. They have the radish, carrots and salsa right by the register which makes it nice after you order. Decided on the Taco Special, 4 tacos and a drink and a side of refried beans. You get to choose your meat. Had one order with Carne Asada and another order with Chicken. They topped the tacos with Onion, Cilantro and salsa. Very liberal on the Cilantro onion. Which is a good thing. They were fast and wrapped my to go order. I got home and we ate. Awesome flavor and no fat on the meat. The onions and cilantro popped like flavor crystals in your mouth. The salsa was pretty good. Not spicy as I would of liked, but decent. This is the way street tacos should of looked and tasted unlike Tacos El Gordo. That place was garbage and I'll never go there again lol. The beans were very good. Not over salty and had a great homemade taste to them. Almost like my moms. I hope the beans stay consistent because I plan to order those again and hope this wasn't a fluke lol. All in all, very good and I can see why this place is always packed. Until next time, Let's eat!!!"}
{"text":"The food is good, but dang the loud music needs to be turned down a notch... I'm Hispanic but the music is a little too loud. It's not that necessary.."}
{"text":"I am not sure why this place has such a high rating. The burrito (super burrito) carne Asada is no bigger than a Taco Bell $2 burrito. The carne Asada is very bland and dry. Don't waisted money on chips and salsa as they give you a cup and send you to the free salsa bar and your entree already comes with chips. ( wish they would have stated that earlier on) . The only reason for 2 stars is cleanliness and ordering time were both good and the salsa verde is in the top ten. I may try another location as I feel this one may not be to par with the original."}
{"text":"I'm from Los Angeles. Came out on vacation with my fianc√©.  Mexican food in Vegas sucks except for this location and Hugo's. I lived in Vegas for 4yrs whenever I would get homesick this is where I would come devour in gluttony for real Mexican food. None of that La salsa crap or Baja fresh.  That is watered down Americanized Mexican Trump voters food."}
{"text":"This place was my favorite till I ordered the Super Nachos it tastes like Taco Bell but worse.  Fake cheese sauce, meat, beans, guacamole and sour cream.  Hardly edible to choke down.  No tomatoes, no onions, no REAL cheese, zilch.  Seriously they must have pounds of shredded cheese and they used plastic cheese sauce instead for nachos. Most of the food is good would've given it 5 stars if they didn't mess up something so simple."}
{"text":"Great AUTHENTIC Mexican fast food!  Carnitas tacos, Carne asada tacos comes with rice & beans.  Looks like an average chain, but is outstanding!  Worth a can ride if you are staying downtown/Freemont."}
{"text":"Have a craving for a taco? This is the ticket! 
So yummy we had the shreded beef and chicken tacos.
And we had taquitos, the guacamole was REALLY good. Easy in and out."}
{"text":"Best tacos i have found in Vegas. The kicker is they are open 24 x 7 on this side of town"}
{"text":"Open up late which is a major plus!  Also they have a KILLER carne asada fries.  I also tried their carnitas taco which was cooked well and was tasty.  Could have used a little more flavor in my opinion but not bad at all.  I enjoyed the food here and will definitely come back to try more items off their menu.  My brother had the burrito which also looked great!  Oh and I almost forgot to mention the all you can drink hibiscus juice and horchata!  I left very full and satisfied.  Its the perfect place to come late at night to have your mexican fix!"}
{"text":"Pass by this place many times so thought we'd stop as it seems it's always busy....the tacos were GREAT....will definitely go back!!"}
{"text":"Its ok..we visit peps every now and then. Crappy area dont go alone! There is a handful of other taco places i prefer,  but overall its ok."}
{"text":"This place is terrible!  First, I had a hard time just placing my order because the girl kept interrupting me.  Then, after a long wait, I get my order, but they screwed it up.  Then, they give me this dirty cup for my 'chips and salsa' (which is a ripoff) and give me a dirty look when I ask for another.  Then, I have to wait and wait and wait behind this woman loading up for winter at the worst salsa bar I've seen this side of the border.   For all the trouble, the food wasn't worth it."}
{"text":"Boulder highway is not exactly a food mecca, but at least one item on the menu at Pepe's tacos deserves mention. That would be the Machaca burrito - shredded dry beef mixed in with scrambled eggs, onions, peppers and tomatoes. This combo was perfectly cooked and their was not ounce of grease at all.  The burrito also had rice inside and i opted to leave out the beans and every bite was glorious. Fresh cold radishes were a good side and I also loved that the chopped onions and cilantro combo was available at the salsa bar, which is basically just a normal salsa bar. Machacha is a tough dish to master, but Pepe has got it down pat."}
{"text":"Very clean and usually packed place. Excellent meats and burritos are big. Would have been a 5 star rating except they use cheese wiz on otherwise really good nachos. Can't understand the negative reviews. This place rocks!"}
{"text":"This place sucks they can't get an order right 2 times in a row and overcharged me for my meal."}
{"text":"I have a terrible addiction to tacos and this place gives me my fix for 2$ lol The beef tacos are season very well."}
{"text":"Well just like most food joints, everything is overpriced and it takes forever to get. This place is highly disorganized when it comes to the flow of customers.
They have the big menu to choose from, prices vary item to item. The only positive? The sauce is good :/"}
{"text":"The tacos are really tasty! I found this place by accident and it is such a find. The food is really good from the tacos, burritos, chips, and sauces. They have deals on certain days of the week but they are not very expense in general. Good food decent price. The wait is never that long either."}
{"text":"Pepe's is really similar to other Mexican fast food joints in town, but they have a few differences that must be mentioned. First, the guacamole here is bomb.com. It's made in-house and you can taste the freshness. I've not found real guacamole at a fast food restaurant yet. Usually its just some green slop, so the real thing is definitely appreciated. Second, they have liquid nacho cheese. The fries and nachos come with the liquid cheese and tacos and burritos come with shredded. Oddly enough, this isn't mentioned on the menu. My boyfriend prefers shredded cheese on his nachos and was surprised to see it was liquid. If you don't know, now you know.

For 2 super nachos, (one asada, one al pastor), and a cheeseburger, our total was $23. A lot of times you can get a really good burger at a Mexican spot, but I didn't really care for the one here. The patties were super thin and flavorless. I also wasn't fond of the asada meat because it's like shredded. ! I think? This is more of a textural issue than anything and it was definitely not what I was expecting. The pastor was decent, a tad spicier than I am used to, but would order that over the asada again. I'll come back when I'm in the area if I'm craving Mexican food, but I won't go out of my way to eat here."}
{"text":"This place is OK I think they have way too many things on the menu that could be cut down a little bit but if it is going to go there for something quick I guess it's OK I only would suggest taco Al Pastore"}
{"text":"This place is close to my house- closer than either Tacos Mexicos or Robertos, so it's on common rotation at my house. My boyfriend prefers to get a carne asada super burrito while I tend to try either tacos or different burritos. Their lengua & carnitas are good, but I found lots of sharp bones in my birria, which ruined the experience for me. Their super burritos come with lettuce, tomato, sour cream, rice and beans plus the meat of your choice for 4.75, about the average. Their burritos are large and filling, making either a hearty meal or two lighter ones. Their chile relleno burrito is a little more, but  fairly tasty.
Be warned: their nachos are crap. You can get much tastier nachos a mile or so down the street at either the Roberto's at Russel or the one in the Sinclair station by Indios. 
Refills are not free but I always get my food to go so that's not an issue for me. I don't know how stringent they are about it, but they have signs warning against sharing drinks. 
Another decent burrito shop in Vegas. Nothing so outstanding its worth driving across town for, but cheap and filling if you're in the neighbohood."}
{"text":"Best Carne Asada street tacos!!!! They are consistently good, fresh and fast. 

I haven't tried any of their other tacos, but from looking at other patrons plates, it seems this place is good across the board.

The neighborhood can be sketchy, but I've never had an issue."}
{"text":"Pepe's Tacos makes a great torta. They start with a soft roll, and add your choice of meat, beans,lettuce,tomato,avocado,and salsa. Mayonnaise also comes standard, but I skip it since the sandwich doesn't need it. (I ordered the carne asada torta)

The beans and rice are average-- nothing too special. My son ordered a cheese quesadilla and really enjoyed it. This place is a good alternative to Roberto's which seems to be on every corner."}
{"text":"I'm long overdue to review Pepe's, seeing as I've checked in enough times to warrant a cot in the back.  This place serves the *best* street tacos in Las Vegas at a great price.  

Once inside, the friendly staff does a good job keeping the place clean, and the salsa bar stocked.  They also always have a large portion of spicy carrots and chopped radishes.  The red salsa has a nice heat with great flavor.  I would take it intravenously if I could.  And here's something else unique about Pepe's:  Free refills on Horchata and fruit drinks (holy crap!).  That right there is one of the best values in town.

The tacos themselves are glorious.  I almost always get the chicken tacos with the 3 taco special which is served with beans and a smattering of chips.  The carne asada is also *very* good, though the el pastor is just kind of \"meh\".  What I love most about this place is the consistency; the tacos are always delicious, always hot, and always made exactly the same.  This is in contrast to some other locations *cough* Rainbow and Flamingo *cough* where the product ranges from palatable to \"Dear god, did one of the cooks find an old horse dead in the street on the way in to work?\".  I would seriously eat here 4-5 times per week if my cardiologist hadn't threatened me with an anesthesia free heart procedure if I didn't cut back.  This is one of my \"go-to\" places in Las Vegas for friends and visitors alike.

Some find the location (Boulder Highway and Flamingo) to be questionable, but just think of it as dinner and a show.  On the plus side, this location seems to attract a surprisingly attractive group of prostitutes, so bring the kids and play a rousing game of \"Spot the Hooker\".  It's fun for the whole family!"}
{"text":"There's California Taco Shops and everyone else. It's just fact of the matter. If it wasn't for my wonderful, amazing, absolutely fantabulous wife I would have never thought twice to stop at Pepe's. Prior to going in I thought this had the chance to be one of the all time worst Mexican food joints I've ever tried. Holy guacamole was I wrong! This is the only taco shop in Vegas comparable to my SoCal roots. 

The first positive sign when I walked in was that this place had a juke box full of Spanish music - and it was blasting! There's nothing worse than walking into a quiet taco shop or one that's playing heavy metal (yes, that has happened). The next positive sign was that a majority of the patrons were of latin decent.  Another good sign was that the walls were all neon colors. White walls at a taco shop? No bueno. The last positive sign was that everyone who was finished eating had absolutely demolished their plates. Spotless, all were members of the clean plate club. Nuff said, I was a fan.

Now bean and cheese burrito's are the staple of my taco shop experience. If they pass this test they are guaranteed to have a repeat customer for life. If they fail, they never get another chance, they do not pass Go, and they certainly do not collect any additional money for me. Pepe's passes the bean burrito challenge with flying colors and oodles of cheese. They have the best bean and cheese burrito in Vegas. I've even ventured out to their quesadilla and tacos. Absolutely awesome as well. Their tacos aren't that Taco Bell/Del Taco nonsense either. Small and on corn tortillas, the meat is chopped fresh, ingredients are all fresh. They also have a really good salsa bar. 

Morning, noon, or night you won't regret a trip to Pepe's Tacos."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS CALLED PEPE'S TACOS!!!!!!!!
(There's a big hint as to what you should be ordering right there in the name...and it's not Pepe.)

Ordering a burrito at a taco stand is the same as ordering a steak at a seafood restaurant...This is not a Mexican RESTAURANT...it is a glorified taco stand and you should treat it as such. I have never ordered anything other than the breakfast plates or tacos here, nor will I ever! 

Some of you remind me of the girl I stood behind at IN-N-OUT who was asking them to make her a chicken sandwich.

I have not eaten at all of the taco places in town but of those I have tried Pepe's is the best. They have the most choices of meat for your tacos, the shells are always nice and soft but never fall apart like the stale ones I have run into other places. AND they always ask you if you want the extras (onions, cilantro, and salsa) on the taco. So if you think there is too much of these things on the taco just don't get it and add them all yourself from the salsa bar.

The lengua here is the best. I like mine finely chopped because it is a rubbery texture, and most places leave it in large cubes, the carnitas here are nice and moist, whereas when I've had it at Roberto's it is always dry and is not nearly chopped or shredded enough.

The star of the menu for me and for those of you who appreciate it, is the best cabeza tacos I've had in Vegas. It is perfectly oily and greasy and tasty just like head meat should be. 
 
Go on Tuesday or Thursday for the taco plate special: $6.95 for 4 tacos and a drink...and get at least 1 cabeza (if not all 4)"}
{"text":"Went here after quite a few beers at about 2am.  The place was pretty busy.  I'm always on the lookout for good al pastor and this place does it authentically on a vertical spit.  Unfortunately, the meat wasn't marinated well enough.    Tacos were authentic but a bit on the small side.   The red salsa was good but could have used a touch more heat.  This is a good place for late night taco binge, but I won't be going to get my taco fix."}
{"text":"Last night after a long night I stopped at Roberto's because it was in my hotel. If I would have known there was a good place across the street I would have went there. This is Taco truck style food at its best. Definitely going here next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Great food. Got the Pollo Super Burrito and even though it was \"small\" it was a delicious and it was just right in terms of being filling without being overly stuffed. The salsa verde was fantastic.  Definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"The marinated pork was good. My wife had the pork stomach she liked it. The rice and beans were ok good not special.  The salsa was delicious.  The Chile relleno was  very good. The marinated goat was stronger flavored but that's what you would expect. And it was good also. The soft corn tacos that was the base was a little small about 3 big bites per taco and it was gone they were $1.99 each and they threw in some refried beans and chips, and condiments. And they are open 24 / 7)"}
{"text":"My usual order is the Carne Asada Buritto. Just Carne and Guac with a side of red sauce. Very good and it's a huge burrito. My coworkers order other from the menu and they say it is good as well."}
{"text":"love coming here the food is great but please change your gloves wash your hands ! while paying i saw the chef wipe his swear and proceeded to make food ! 



this is not okay !wash and change your gloves"}
{"text":"My husband always brings us to eat at Pepe's. It is extremely helpful that they are open 24-hours and serve everything on their menu at all hours of the day. The meat (we prefer the carne asada and pastor) are always very savory and never dry. The tortillas never fall apart and their beans are to die for, figuratively speaking of course. The horchata and other aguas are next to the soda machine so you can get unlimited refills and that is definite benefit. 

The dining area is moderately sized and very close together. There are gender specific bathrooms. There is juke box available where you can select your own music. I've never been to this location, or any other for that matter, that are ever not busy. Nonetheless, the cashiers always go through the line pretty fast and accurate.  

Because it is in a shopping center there is more than enough free parking lot parking and stores nearby to walk off the food after you're done eating. The decor is a map of Mexico along with their mascot (a rat with a sombrero)."}
{"text":"Finally found a GREAT taco shop! I passed by a few times & never stopped but I was craving taquitos & menudo after a hike today. I was in the area so I decided to give it a try! Yeah I hit the jackpot! Absolutely delicious authentic mex food yum! This will be a regular stop for me from now on!"}
{"text":"I love three things in life:  My mom, my bulldog and Mexican food...perhaps not even in that order (sorry mom!)  Because of this unhealthy obsession, I found myself cruising to the eastside of Vegas for the first time in ages (oh is this what Boulder Highway looks like?!?!).  Pepe's Tacos has won a number of the Review-Journal's \"best of\" awards over the years and I decided I need to see what the fuss was about. 

Well to quote my homie Bill Shakespeare \"It was much adoo about nothing.\"  Much how I still continually wonder how Cuba Gooding Jr. has an Oscar Award, I must question what Vegas-ites were thinking when voting for Pepe's.  To be fair, Pepe's is fine.  In fact, the tacos I had were pretty tasty and the other food I'm sure is good too.  Prices were reasonable and the place is open 24 hours.  The salsa bar is also above average.  The best however?  That's a stretch as I think Roberto's is still a notch above and I'm sure there is even better out there.  Pepe's does offer some unique meat choices like cabeza and birria that one can't find at Roberto's and their taco special Tuesday thru Thursday is a great value (4 tacos and a soft drink for $6.95).  

Some of the other reviews of this place seem a bit harsh as the place does it what it needs to do for being a hole in the wall Mexican taco shop.  Award worthy?  Probably not.  Lunch worthy?  Anytime...especially if my mom is paying (sorry again Mom!)"}
{"text":"Holly cow this place sucks! First of all I was hesitant to walk in because someone had been shot there a couple of days ago. I orderd three tacos, carane asada, carnitas and pollo. They all tasted the same with a small flavor... the salsa sucked to... it felt like I was pouring lame tapatio in green and red slasa on my taco. The service was ok, but this place did not sell me. Not coming back."}
{"text":"Ordered their Thursday Special of 4 tacos & a drink. I love \"carne al pastor\" so my tacos were Al pastor. Loved how well seasoned the meat was since I'm always having a hard time finding ones who aren't over seasoned or under seasoned. Tacos come with double tortilla and fully loaded with cilantro and onion & salsa of your choice. Pepe tacos never fails in authentic Mexican food spots and loved the fact they are open 24/7"}
{"text":"I've been here about 3 times. I haven't left very satisfied but the last time I went (last week) was just plain disgusting. 
I ordered an all-meat carne asada burrito and the amount of grease it had was just terrible. DO NOT cook with that much grease: It's unhealthy and disgusting. I filled a few plates with grease because it was pouring down. Really, you don't have to cook with that much.
There are better Mexican places in town, this is one of the bad ones. I'm Mexican myself and I recommend to avoid this place."}
{"text":"I hate coming here but its the closes one to my house . I'm short on time.  This place is always slow always has homeless people in the parking lot begging for change ."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The carne asada and chorizo is divine! Try the carne asada burrito- you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Wow, this place is super authentic and the quality is amazing , carne asada was lean. Chorizo was tasty. And low price. I would highly recommend it."}
{"text":"The best think about Pepe's, hands down, is the fact that they are open 24-7. It's very comforting knowing that no matter when I get off work (which is sometimes as late as 1am), I can find a hot, filling meal that's not McNast- I mean, McDonald's.

The food is good. Not great, but good. They have El Pastor, so I usually get that. On the last visit here, I ran to get gas while my burrito sat in the car. By the time I got home, it was cold. I was perplexed at how my burrito could get cold after 10 minutes, so I recommend eating the food there, or heading straight home as fast as possible after ordering to-go.

Note to the ladies- If you come here late night, you probably will be leered at by dudes. Not harassed, just a nice, casual leering. It's flattering in some ways, but if you are the type of girl that gets creeped out easily, then mayhap, this is not the place to come. Doesn't bother me, though.

The tables are not always cleaned right away either, so watch out when sitting down. Someone spilled clear liquid, maybe Sprite, all over the booth style seat and table I sat down at last time. Walked around with a wet butt for a while after."}
{"text":"Oh Pepe's. I know it's just a fast food taco place and there are so many others out there. It's far from any 5 star dining experience but there are certain details that make me give Pepe's 5 stars. 
The food alone is just the best. I love how the tacos are on a small tortilla just like in Mexico. You get more meat and less tortilla. This detail alone is hard to find anywhere else and that's why I love this place. 
The beans are awesome. I always order an extra side just to snack on. I recommend the torta and carne asada tacos. Fresh juices and salsas. They have a great breakfast option as well with eggs and tortillas. You will leave full and satisfied for a good price. Trust me Pepe's is the best."}
{"text":"Ordered a burrito. Al pastor with everything. Got everything but the al pastor. The whole burrito was rice. Over heard the cashier when I ordered my burrito that he had 3 orders of it and if he had enough. Obviously not. Will not eat here again."}
{"text":"after being spoiled with real Mexican food in California, I became obsessed with finding places that served those damn delicious tacos. so, on a past trip to las vegas, i finally discovered a restaurant that did.

i got 2 carne asada (beef) and 2 birria (goat). soft, juicy, and jam packed with flavor. very authentic in my book.

i should have topped my tacos with more cilantro and onions, but was too ashamed because of the long line behind me. the sauces i took on the side were really good too; a green and red salsa.

the wait was long, but i didn't mind. i just couldn't wait to eat.

fyi: they do take out also, so be sure to call ahead if you're in a rush."}
{"text":"The meat can be a little greasy sometimes, but damn if it's not the best food after a night of drinking. 

They're open 24 hours, fast service and fair prices. 

They have the best carne asada fries since they use melted nacho cheese. I also recommend the double cheese burger, you wouldn't think a place like this has a good burger but they actually grill it as you order it, definitely better than the fast food chains. 

Best horchata of any place of its kind, way better than any Robertos."}
{"text":"Pepe's Taco's is solid!

Great Carne Asada Fries, tacos, Burritos and more.

Open 24hrs even on Thanksgiving!"}
{"text":"Clean store, food is yummy! Large portions, this is a win, win! Fully stocked salsa bar, burritos are huge, carne asada fries (sp) are amazing! You don't wait long here and the staff seems pretty happy and helpful..."}
{"text":"This is a great little place.  Excellent variety on the menu, and the prices are good.  There are 8 meat choices, including goat and fish.  Nice salsa bar, and several drink choices, not counting the normal soda fountain."}
{"text":"Order got botched TWICE!! Haven't been here in a while. Used to come up to thrice a week. Their tacos al pastor aren't what they used to be. Pepe, dude... I just don't know you anymore."}
{"text":"Awesome $5 burritos and AWESOME juice selection.....pineapple! hell yeah killer late night fare. 3.7 stars"}
{"text":"This place puts Roberto's to shame.  Their carne asada is the best. It's not fatty and disgusting like Roberto's is.

I suggest the super nachos with carne asada with extra nacho cheese. So yummy.
The super burrito with chicken is really good also."}
{"text":"I write this review in the hopes that the owners fix their food , because it used to be great ! I always get the carnitas burrito and last few times it has been so lackluster that I probably will not return!!!! Seems like each of the last few times that I have been have gotten progressively worse, with my recent visit being the final straw. On my recent visit I once again ordered the carnitas super burrito & there was nothing super about it , first off they have gotten smaller over time, but it's the quality that has really taken a hit , the tortilla with the ingredients inside was sopping wet and upon unwrapping it it became a big soupy mess , the carnitas which used to be worth a drive across town, were  sparse , sad , lacking flavor and greasy ( not in a good way ) , the beans  had no flavor either and if there was cheese it probably was hiding out with the rest of the carnitas, basically I paid for a sour cream and guacamole burrito, which speaking of guacamole I paid 1.75 extra for a mix of avocado and lemon , it is quite sad and I will miss this place hopefully they will get better again , I will keep an eye out for your reviews !"}
{"text":"Two words: Fish Tacos!

This spot is right down the street from work so it's one of my usuals for lunch. I typically get the fish tacos but have tried their burritos and quesadilla and all were standard. The review and stars are really all for the fish tacos. They are some of the best I've EVER had!"}
{"text":"Facebook shows 5 stars. It was good, but not THAT good. Had carnitas. Don't get me wrong, I liked it a lot, but I've had better. I actually enjoyed the grilled and marinated vegetables more than anything else. After saying that, if I'm in the area, I'll definitely try something else next time."}
{"text":"Best Pepes in Vegas. Owner actually has priced everything fairly. All the other locations have gotten greedy and almost double their prices. This location has gone up but at a reasonable rate. Also I have noticed that it is consistently delicious where the other locations have from time to time been a let-down. I give kudos to this location and wants to tell the owner how great of a job they are running this business"}
{"text":"Very good! I came in today, they didn't have chicken available, but the steak was super yummy! The staff is nice as well! So many options I don't know where to start! But at least you never get bored! The jukebox is pretty awesome as well! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"This is a very popular (Why?) casual restaurant where you order at the window and wait to be called to pick up the food.  We ordered a total of 4 street tacos; 3 with dried out pastor and 1 with tasteless pollo.  Our plates included industrial taco chips, tasteless Spanish rice, ugly refried beans.  I did enjoy the complimentary carrot and onion escabeche."}
{"text":"By far one of my favorite taco places in town!

I love it so much that I come at least once a week for lunch! I either order your basic tacos (yum) or the gordita. 

The gordita, carne asada with everything is a huge meal. I am so stuffed when i finish it, but it is so worth it! 

The staff is very friendly and it is everything you would expect from a taco shop. It reminds me of my days in Mexico and eating street tacos :o)

They should start a taco/ gordita punch card, after 10 get one free!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious fresh Mexican food. Clean and very reasonable prices. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Looking for Mexican food after 10 pm, heard this place was good. We were pleased.  Nothing fancy but very good. Priced well. Friendly service. Pastor taco meat was delicious."}
{"text":"If I were you, I'd stay far away and never eat here..! I ordered al pastor nachos and two bean and cheese burritos for my husband. Food came out quick and smelled delightful.. I took our order home.. once I got there my husband and I began to dig in and I must say the food tasted ok in the beginning but that was because we were dying of hunger.. my nachos were soggy the meat was burned and had no flavor my husbands bean and cheese burritos were drenched in grease.. neither of us could stomach our food soo we threw it out, what a waste ik.. guess you can say I'm spoiled and use to the Mexican food in California.. ik one thing, we won't be eating here ever again!!"}
{"text":"Taco truck brought indoors. Meaning - YUM! They have the full fare - tacos, burritos, etc. All freshly made on the spot. Portions are grand. Tasty. The salsa bar is a little sparse (two choices, some radishes and cilantro) - but still fresh and tasty. We spent under $20 and ate until it hurt.

Skip the Bell, go for the real thing."}
{"text":"The picutes look tastier than the food actually is. The first time I went was the mini tacos. yuck . i left hungry. I'm all about mexican food but they had more onions in there than meat. maybe it was just my tacos that were gross. The carnitas tacos however were so good. I'd order those again. definitely. the chips and salsa were so gross.. my bf and I ALWAYS finish the basket.. NOT this time. we left the whole basket there. stale ass chips w/ watered down salsa. Yet I will say this place is always busy.  The 2nd time I went I was hung over and craving menudo. I got it to go and they packed it nicely with red pepper flakes, oregeno and it was good but not great. extremely oily, more than most menudos i've had lately. I wouldnt order it again. Knowing how many calories I'm consuming there... I'd rather go nxt door and eat @ Weinerschnitzel. :)"}
{"text":"After dealing with Roberto's crap forever... Finally tried this place. Their meats taste like they actually took time to cook and marinate, and granted the service isn't expectational, it is a wonderful late night taco spot. Why ever go anywhere else again? That's how good this place is. Usually I'm sketched out by cheap meat, but not here. It's so amazing."}
{"text":"I get tacos from here all the time for lunch with my coworkers. LOVE their carne asada tacos, and their nachos."}
{"text":"Stupid singing rat :) ...the entire reason I ever tried Pepe's Tacos was because the stupid jingle is so darn cute.  What is it about a singing bobblehead rat that makes me crave tacos at 2 am??!  It's like this Pavlovian thing with me...

Anyway, Pepe's is okay in my book.  It definitely fulfills my late-night Mexican food cravings more than, oh, say, NASTY Roberto's Tacos does (see inflammatory review).  I usually get pastor for my meat choice.  It's a little chewy but pretty flavorful.  I'm not so keen on the beans, but whatever.  It's a pile of beans.  It is what it is.

I haven't ever come away from Pepe's feeling like I had the meal of my life, but I also don't feel like I've had scary mystery meat either.  It's decent.  The rat is cute.  Trust me, his little bobblehead is engaging in some pretty powerful hypnosis...if you stare too long, I bet you'll end up at Pepe's too!"}
{"text":"This place is legit. I grew up in LA and this place makes the closest thing to what I get in Cali. 
The Nachos: they make it right, no fancy melted shredded cheese, they use the melted, runny oh soo good glowing orange cheese sauce. 
The Tacos: Carne Asada is done right, good flavor and nice texture, they chopped it up in small bits so they are easy to eat. 
I live across town and still drive out here cause it is that good."}
{"text":"The prices here are decent, my boyfriend ordered 2 carne asada tacos, chips and salsa. I had the al pastor fries. I love how they use nacho cheese on the fries. I didn't give then 5 stars because the al pastor meat was super dry and a bit hard. Overall the food was great and our order was under $20!!"}
{"text":"Been trying to find a good Mexican restaurant since I've lived here; I've yet to find one that hits the spot as Mexican is my favorite food. Went here with a friend for the first time last night. It was just okay. I ordered the enchilada dinner with the side of rice and beans. They put way too much lettuce in the meal and not enough seasoning. The food just doesn't taste like authentic Mexican food. Prices are too high for the small servings they give you. Would I come back? Yea until I find a much better option."}
{"text":"The feedback from my group was as follows:

-They had food so it's a 5. 
-It took them 10 minutes to find me a bathroom key so a 2. 
-3.5. 
-this was an elegant experience and though I had a significant language barrier, their peska (some fish or tofu like substance) was an eye opener and reminder that I shouldn't judge other cultures by the quality of their food but instead silently appreciate being able to experience it."}
{"text":"There are soft tacos, hard shell tacos, burritos, torta's, burgers, quesadillias, as well as a lot of other stuff.  It's open 24hours and there are several locations.  I come here fro the soft taco's.

You choose your meat, today its carne asada, then there are onions, cilantro and choice of hot sauce.  I also tried the gorditias, a fried corn tortillia pocket with again your choice of meat, I got the carne asada, onions, and cilantro.

I enjoyed the soft taco's, but the gorditias were over fried, they were very hard and difficult to eat.  

For a quick snack or meal, this place rocks!"}
{"text":"Very typical menu items like at any Mexican casual dining place. Love the carne asada all meat burrito because the meat is so soft and tender and just seasoned perfectly. Service is fast but they are always so busy for lunch even on weekends so call and order ahead if you're planning on taking it to go."}
{"text":"If you got the late night quasi-authentico mexican craving, then Pepe's is probably the place. Not the greatest or the tastiest, but for being OPEN INSIDE 24 hours, the night crew sees plenty of action. I usually get the Carne Asada Tacos, about a C+, and sometimes a Chile Rellano Burrito (tonight was pretty good, a B+, but usually a C-). My roommate loves this place and frequents it often: me, once in a while. To me, it is one step up from a taco truck."}
{"text":"Need more works  food is delicious I love the pollo Fry's just need Add more guc and have agua de pi√±a"}
{"text":"I normally don't hang on this side of town WHATSOEVER but what the hay... gotta live a little! Lmao :-) I ordered a Carne asada burrito and a large Horchata to go, and I'm not sure if I was just hungry due to fasting and trying to eat a little less nowadays, but man let me tell ya, it was soooooooo delicious! I took the whole thing down in around 7 minutes. I asked for my mean cooked well, so it came out crispy just how I like it. The cook back there must literally be from Mexico because only they can make it taste like your actually south of the border. The service was good, I didn't wait too long for my order either. The only reason why it's not a full 5 stars is the price. Plates are about $2 to $3 bucks more expensive than other places like this. Even other Pepe's around town are less than this location. I'm not complaining tho, just making an observation is all. STILL great food. If I'm ever on this side of Vegas again I wouldn't hesitate to grab a bite."}
{"text":"Omg! Pepe's tacos are so delicious! They're real tacos, the salsa is perfect! Everything on the menu is awesome, the only reason I didn't give it five stars is because the location (which can't be held against them, but still) and I feel like I have to run in and run out because it's not safe. I always feel like my car is going to get stolen when I come here. But the tacos are great!"}
{"text":"Another great place to eat out with family or just another meal for yourself. Some people may be picky with their Mexican food but for me this is relatively close to authentic. Very great food. Service is good as well and inside is comfortable as well. Would recommend grabbing a meal here anytime soon."}
{"text":"The female cashier is rude. I've been here three times and she's always the cashier. You'll ask her a question and she'll just stare at you looking as if you're the dumb one. She also ignores people and gives attitude. My friend called her out on to stop being rude and she just laughed. You can tell she doesn't like her job, but you don't have to be rude to the customers. 
Their Carne asada fries are good, but after our last visit, I don't think I'll be going back. I'm very easy to please and I understand that sometimes a restaurant can have bad days. But the fact that she is just rude to the customers and ignores them for the third time, it irritates me. Just be prepared to get attitude from the cashier girl."}
{"text":"Wait was short. Food was great! Had the 3 soft lingua tacos. They sure are not stingy with the meat. My husband had the menudo. He liked it and said they gave you a Lot for price. The salsa bar was well stocked. Salsas were good. Cashier was pleasant. And they knew were the restroom key was.lol. Read some reviews that said cashier rude and they couldn't find restroom key. I would most definitely come back."}
{"text":"I'm just going to make it easy for everyone.

Vegas
24 hours
Off-strip
Cheap
Good
Free horchata refills

Comparable to LA taco places? Maybe close. They do have a location in Downey which I have yet to try.

Adios amigo!"}
