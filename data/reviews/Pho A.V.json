{"text":"Amazing pho. It's a huge serving for 8$! The broth is great and the veggie toppings are fresh. It's a hole in the wall place in a strip mall but it's so worth it."}
{"text":"My husband and I love coming to this pho restaurant. Not only do they have awesome service, but they make sure to always give you a cup of water with lemon (even if you already have another drink), have great prices considering their big portions and their pho is absolutely delicious! This is definitely our go-to pho restaurant and it shall certainly continue to be!!"}
{"text":"First visit. Not a particular fan of their spring rolls, but the best pho I've found in the area since the Nam Sao closed. I'll be back."}
{"text":"This place is incredible. Been to Vietnam about 7-8 times now. This is just like home super scrumptious incredible"}
{"text":"OK but not as generous in size and ingredients as the pho at da vang, where many vietnamese dine."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for Vietnamese food, so I decided to try this place out. I ordered the vermicelli dish with chicken and it was delicious! The noodles were cooked perfectly and the sauce had a ton of flavor. The cook added sesame seeds which gave it a really good and nutty flavor. The decor was lacking, but didn't bother me at all. I pay to eat good food, not to stare at decorations. I had a very hard time communicating with the lady, but the guy speaks good english. They were both very friendly and very accommodating.  Go and see for yourself how good this place is. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"A Vietnamese restaurant added to the the already Mexican and Chinese food dominated area!! The place is owned by Phat - pronounced Pat and not Fat! LOL....he's a funny guy. The food was simple and delicious. I had the pho (beef soup), grilled pork, catfish w/ginger and spring roll. I had better ones, but this one passes the test. The soup's temperature could be hotter though. They have only been open 5 months in the same strip as Food City."}
{"text":"Just about the least comfortable seating I've ever sat on in a restaurant (the booths and the chairs), but what matters, the food and the service, were great.  Delicious pho, so flavorful with all the spices.  Spring rolls were okay.  Mom of this mom and pop was very friendly as a server and helpful in teaching me to eat the pho and spring rolls the proper way.  Did I mention the pho's flavor was incredible?"}
{"text":"Actual authentic and delicious Vietnamese in Phoenix!! This place was such an exciting find.. The food is great, wonderful pho- we had the chicken one and seafood with both being delicious. Also great curry and good spring rolls.. I also liked that they have really lovely service. Most amazing part was that it's owned and run entirely by a husband who does all the cooking and his wife who is the waitress. Despite being very busy everything was perfect. They speak minimal English which was just fine with us and added to the authentic feel.  FYI we have eaten Vietnamese all over the country/world and the restaurants are always no frills. Not exactly a romantic night but good cooking."}
{"text":"Normally we go to Viet kitchen, but this time we decided to try some new place. On seeing the 4 rating we decided to try here. I ordered shrimp soft noodles and chicken pho for takeout, but we got pork soft noodle instead of shrimp. The pho the was not that great, and the soft noodle left a weird taste."}
{"text":"Great food, but to go orders are usually not ready. Well worth the wait though!  Try the beef brisket soup and create your own masterpiece!  Looks not too promising from the outside but it really is. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Food was very good and being Vietnamese myself I would say this is as close to my moms cooking as it will get. Super cheap hole in the wall. I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"It was our anniversary and we decided to get some pho. Opened up my trusty Yelp app and searched. I quickly found Pho AV. Read some reviews and decided to go for it. We knew what we were getting into. Little ambiance, no house music. Our table was a little sticky too. All this and we were still on board. We ordered the shrimp Pho and the chicken version. Also added 4 spring rolls. 2 too many. They were good. Not great. The shrimp were properly cooked. There were a few more noodles in it for my taste but the, what I think was pork was not good. Grey, fatty and largely cut. Making it a tough chew. I have to say we were the only ones in the place. The owners were very nice but after ordering they disappeared and I heard the microwave. I cringed a little. So back to the spring rolls. I didn't hate them. The peanut sauce was fine. Done. Now the Pho. We're served the traditional garnishes on a speared plate and an ample bowl of broth and noodles laced with lightly charred onions. The broth was clear and seasoned but not overly. The flavors were subtle and clean. The chicken was white meat and shredded. It tasted a bit of the fridge. I'm nitpicking. It was good. The prices are very affordable and I'd like to try some other dishes. It smelled of curry when we walked in and I'm eager to try it when I return."}
{"text":"Pho A.V has some of the best pho I've ever eaten which is to say a gem in the midle of the desert of Phoenix. I usually get other pho in Chicago in the \"little Vietnam\" part of Uptown. You can tell this couple take care of a family recipe and it's a delight to try it."}
{"text":"Wow, I am shocked by all the great reviews of this place. The spring rolls were about a 4 out 10. I ordered tofu with curry sauce. The sauce was very bland and the tofu tasted of freezer burn and had the consistency of chewing gum.  Awful food."}
{"text":"I return back to try their pho noodle soup, after hearingabout the new ownership. I must say I was very impressed. The pho broth was very tasty and authentic to me. Also the owner lady was very friendly , Nice and welcoming. Ii'm planning to return, But I hope they can make their price is more reasonable and put more meat in the soup, thenI I would frequent their restaurant a lot more often."}
{"text":"Nice, quiet, cozy place off the 51. Pho was good and the egg rolls were alright. It was standard fare for a filling meal."}

{"text":"This is the best Pho I have had outside of when I went to Vietnam.  It does help I live around the corner from the restaurant.  My fiancé and I get #6, and #8 respectively and both are always delicious.  As all of the other reviews have noted the servings are plentiful with an appropriate amount of meat/tripe.    I have eaten in restaurant as well as carry out.  I would recommend both.  Carry out is outstanding and only takes about five minutes from time of order to walking out the door (At least for Pho orders.)  While dining in, the owners/wait staff are from Vietnam and have limited English skills, pointing at items has happened.    I will finish up saying I have been here with my friend and his wife (From Vietnam) and they both agree this has some of the most authentic Vietnamese cuisine in the valley.  I highly recommend eating here whether you stay and eat or get take out."}
{"text":"I've been to quite a few Pho spots in town and this one by far has the tastiest broth!!! Delicious!!! My favorite place!"}
{"text":"Not the best Pho I've had and also not the worst. It's close to my house so will be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews I decided I would try this place. I was excited because it Is near my house. MAJOR disappointment!  The first thing I noticed was that the vents were dirty and obviously hadn't been cleaned for some time.   I wanted to try the egg rolls but even though they were on the menu the server said they didn't have any. I ordered the spring rolls. They were like chewing rubber with just about as much flavor. I also ordered chicken fried rice. When I heard the microwave I was not very optimistic.   The rice was slightly over cooked (microwave?). The dish had a lot of ground black pepper in it and that was all I could taste. I couldn't finish my meal nor did I want to take it home.   The staff was pleasant and on top of things so I left a good tip but I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Awesome pho got the big combination bowl by accident, what a lovely accident. I finish it all :o ... The lady works the front alone so be patient your order might take some time , she's very sweet tho ;)."}
{"text":"This place is SO good. The owners are really nice and they make amazing food. I'm really happy that it's located 3 minutes from my apartment"}
{"text":"Wow! The pho is amazing here! First of all, don't get discouraged by the interior! It may look like a hole in the wall, but it's super great! Not to mention the add ins of herbs were obviously really fresh, and the Thai basil was a perfect touch to authenticity! Large servings too! Would highly recommend to anyone looking to get their pho fix"}
{"text":"New ownership @ May 2016. Served by lady/owner. Not many pho places north of Phoenix, so with that caveat, plain decor is irrelevant compared to the pho. Genuine broth.  Asian restaurants are really about the food.: (Virtually no English, asked for more sides to no avail etc). Not about service nor ambiance, but food. For that, it gets a strong recommendation."}
{"text":"Excellent Pho.  I had the usual, spring rolls and Pho Thai.  The peanut sauce for the spring rolls was not the best.  The deep broth wasn't overpowered by the anise and came with lots greens, cilantro and green onions.  I'm going back."}
{"text":"Did not live up to expectations based off of previous reviews. I am a big fan of mom and pop ethic restaurants so it's tough to give a difficult review. We were solo in the restaurant for most of the time. They did not have eggrolls at all when we ordered so we ordered the spring rolls. The spring rolls were solid but not spectacular. We ordered the chicken pho and beef pho and another entrée.  None of the three were anywhere near average based off of plenty of previous Vietnamese restaurants.  I drove a bit to get here so it was extra disappointing. I hate to give this review."}
{"text":"Excellent Pho! Highly recommend. The wife and I both had the shrimp pho with all the fixens. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Great Pho all the time!  I get their steak and meatball pho- it's the best around!  Their broth has so much more flavor then other places I've tried. Friendly and fast service always makes it a good experience."}
{"text":"Very good food and the portions were plentiful. The environment was comfortable and staff was also very nice with great service. I will take my family here again"}
{"text":"Very good Pho ! Service was quick. I like the generous portion of bánh pho compared with other Viet pho places."}
{"text":"The food is actually decent but the service is terrible. They get my order wrong every single time. It is a bummer bc we don't have pho in this neighborhood. I now travel to 19th for good pho and service. I AM WILLING TO DRIVE THAT FAR!"}
{"text":"Wow, sooo yummy.   Really, it is, go, go now.  The place is very clean and staff super gracious."}
{"text":"We come here for their Pho! This restaurant is owned and run by the two couple that are extremely nice. The husband usually makes the food and his wife takes the order. Extremely nice little lady. Her Husband is also extremely nice and they are always smiling. I've had all of their pho, and their pho is extremely good. Their spring rolls are also extremely good. I've had many spring rolls from other restaurant and I can't express how much better their spring rolls are."}
{"text":"A mom n pop kinda place.  Small, pho was good, shrimp roll was okay...but then againI grew up in Toronto, Canada where we have a huge Vietnamese population and pho places are everywhere, cheap and tasty! Satisfied my pho craving while in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"What a great find! Family owned hole in the wall. Friendly staff. Great food!! One of the best Pho dishes I've had."}
{"text":"We used to frequent Viet Kitchen for pho, but this quickly became our go-to.  It is one of those unpretentious hole-in-the-wall places with randomly fun youtube streaming on the TV.  The gentleman that is normally there is super friendly and the pho is reliably awesome (and super affordable for such a generous portion!)."}
{"text":"The best Pho in Phoenix area! I used to live in Seattle and Las Vegas where great pho/vietnamese restaurants are all over. Ever since I moved to Arizona, I've been to several places in Chandler, Mesa and Phoenix but none of them were as good as I wanted them to be.  I tried Pho A.V few days ago for Pho tai and fried rice, and this is THE one! My husband, not a fan of Pho even said it is soooo good."}
{"text":"I rate ethnic food based on the food and not the atmosphere.  It's a hole in the wall in a shopping center.  The owner was in the back and spoke great english if you really need.  There is a bit of a language barrier with the lady that served us but she was very nice and sweet.  She even brought us more egg rolls after we ate ours and showed us how to roll it in the lettuce and minute, and then dip and eat.     We had the sesame chicken and chicken pho.  Used my entire plate of sprouts, basil, parsley and jalapeños.  Asked for extra lime.  Everything was fresh.  Excellent quality and taste.  3rd place this week where I was the only white guy.  Knew I was onto something."}
{"text":"We love Pho AV! The new owners a have revamped the menu and it did not disappoint! The spring rolls are to die for and the pho is now at the top of my list. We can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Found this place after a friend took me to a pho place in Tempe and wow what an awesome restaurant been three times and the spring rolls are fantastic the beef pho is incredible I would highly recommend this place for a meal. Don't know about the neighborhood but once you're in the place the surrounding is warm and comfortable and the staff is very friendly. Thank you Pho A V."}
{"text":"Super tasty. The broth had great flavor and the portions were huge! I've been looking for a decent Pho place that isn't way off the beaten path and this is it!  Wait staff was great and super friendly. I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Unassuming place in a stripall next to Food City but this place was surprisingly good!  My boyfriend was skeptical at first based on the dining area but I assured him to give it a try based on the positive reviews I saw on yelp.  The vegetarian pho was delicious and my boyfriends chicken rice noodle dish had the perfect amount of heat to it!  Coming from the north east I was worried I wouldn't find good Pho but this takes my first place so far! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great Spring rolls! Generous amount of BBQ pork insiden peanut sauce was yummy! I had #6 beef pho, broth was very good a little siracha added and I ate all of it! Language could be a barrier she spoke almost no english but our orde was correct."}
{"text":"plain store front in my neighborhood.  If your looking for ambiance, wrong place.  My wife hates these mom and pop type places but I generally find the food is good and the prices fair.  So this goes on the list of places I eat alone.  Both the beef and chicken pho are pretty good as well as the spring rolls.  Give the place a try, I'm sure you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Great little place. Good place to grab a quick meal. Service is quick and the staff, albeit not very talkative, are polite and do their jobs. I usually order the Pho, which tastes great and is reasonably priced. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"My 1st time here. Had the #7 pho and sliced beef large bowl. Menu price was 9.99. I was charged 10.99. Apparently there is a sign behind the cashier that says prices went up  The broth was very good. Lots of flavor. The pho noodles were ok. It's hard to mess up noodles. The only downside was the lack of beef slices. I counted 4 maybe 5 small slices.    Ambiance wise there not much to say. It small looks clean. Like every other basic pho place I've been to across the country.  It's good. I would come back if I were nearby., but i wouldn't make a special trip as there are others closer to where I live and work."}
{"text":"Pho is delicious!!! The fried rice is HELLA BOMB!!!!! The people are nice as well. Its a must go if you like food"}
{"text":"We went here for my birthday dinner a few nights ago, I had never been here but my family likes the spot. The woman who waited on us had a sour attitude from the moment we walked in. I'm not sure if she was upset that we chose to sat by where her kid was sitting, sorry? The service throughout our entire meal was cold, she didn't speak to us much or confirm any orders.. we ran out of water twice and had to get up to ask for it, it was very weird given all of the other great reviews and experiences.. Food was sub-par, I've had better Vietnamese in town. Maybe we came on an off day, but it completely ruined my dinner."}
{"text":"This is a good little \"hole-in-the-wall\" type restaurant. Where this term is usually saved for greasy American and Mexican food, I think this term fits the bill here. The Pho here is one of the more authentic Pho I've had here in Arizona. This is a no frills, no hype, non-fancy type of place. When you walk in, your initial thought is to walk right out. But I'm glad I stayed and gave this place a try, and I promise you will not be sorry for staying and ordering some yummy Pho. The lone waitress that is there does not speak English very well, but she'll understand everything that you're ordering. Don't expect to hold a conversation with her though. The several times I've been there, I've only tried their Pho and have yet to try any other dish, not because it's not appealing, but because the Pho there is so good. I may have to order something else next time I'm there so that I can review that food.   Also, do yourself the favor of totally disregarding the 1 star review where this person says the food is microwaved. That person said, \"I kept hearing the ding ding ding of the microwave and then a bowl of soup would come out.\" Please, that proves nothing. On top of that, I've never heard any \"ding ding ding\" all the times I've been here. Some people just like to write bad reviews. When I see ridiculous reviews like that one, I always think of the line in \"The Dark Knight\" where Alfred says, \"Some men just want to watch the world burn.\" lol"}
{"text":"Hole in the wall with GREAT food.  This is my favorite Vietnamese restaurant in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I did not enjoy my meal or experience this trip. I have the chicken pho and the chicken was extremely dry. Also on the TV playing on the wall they had the channel set to a nature Channel and while I was there the show that was on was about insects and larvae and I just couldn't even eat"}
{"text":"It's my favorite pho place in north Phoenix. Their is very good. The owner is very sweet. She is very accommodating with how I like my pho, which no noodle. The whole staff is very nice! I come here a lot with my best friend. The prices you cannot beat. I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Who is giving this place good reviews and why?!  Ordered #4 appetizer a rice paper spring roll. Came out very room temp (scary and gross) and I didn't finish them   Ordered \"recommended\" beef pho. The noodles were all in one big clump really hard i get apart and so was the beef. Like a brick of beef.  I didn't finish or take with me. Worst pho I have ever had.  Lady at counter very unhappy and room is bright, silent and place is actually super super dirty."}
{"text":"It's so cliche, but you know you are at a good ethnic restaurant when people from the culture are the majority of the customers. I walked in and was excited. The place is situated in a plaza between a Food City and a Family Dollar store. Went with my sister. She ordered a Pho and I had the vermicelli noodles and we split spring rolls. Our entrees tasted great. The spring rolls were a little underwhelming, but still tasted good. She got Pho with meatballs, brisket and steak. I got vermicelli noodles with a ground shrimp around a sugar cane and grilled pork. Would go back again."}
{"text":"I have lived in the valley for over a year and with so many Pho places, it's hard to finally pick one and try it.  I have been to only one other Pho restaurant here and it was amazing.  But it's 40 minutes away.  I was feeling pretty ill one night (hangover, i admit it!) and consulted yelp on a Pho restaurant that was open at 9:30 PM.  It led me to this restaurant in a shopping center.  I called them and asked if it was too late to place an order.  The lady on the other end of the line was more than happy to take my order regardless of the late time.  In a hurry, I went to go pick up my cherished Pho Ga (chicken soup).  When I came home I was super stoked to see how much they give you for $6.00.  Plenty of noodles, plenty of bean sprouts and my FAVORITE (and this is where most restaurants fall short) is they do not skimp on the basil.  They are also very generous with the jalapenos and cilantro.  Overall, I would absolutely consider this restaurant my go-to place when that Pho Craving hits."}
{"text":"I can't speak highly enough of this restaurant. My wife and I love eating here and will often carry out Pho. Moving away from our favorite Vietnamese restaurant was heart breaking. We now have a new love."}
{"text":"The food was amazing and the experience was great! Everyone is so friendly and the food comes out super fast. I love pho,and this place tops it!"}
{"text":"The price was right the food was great :-) I made a mistake in my order and they were happy to fix it you can't hardly ask for more than that!"}
{"text":"I love this little jewel of a place. The pho is traditional Vietnamese fare that is wholesome and amazing . I come at least once a week. Don't miss out on this really great place."}
{"text":"SO GOOD! First Pho in The Valley and one of the best I've had! Prices are super reasonable and friendly staff."}
{"text":"This little Vietnamese restaurant is the best! The Pho soup is so delicious and the egg rolls are the best by far. The service is always friendly and inviting and the servers are always happy to explain the menu items when you're having a tough time deciding what to get because it's all sooooo good. Pho AV is one of my favorite places to go for lunch or dinner anytime."}
{"text":"After looking at all the yelp reviews and listening to my aunt rave about this place my sisters & I decided to stop by and have some lunch. It was a sunday afternoon and nobody was in there but us and our waitress. She was very kind but seemed like she knew very little English. We asked her questions about the items on the menu but she didn't know much of what we were asking so we ordered anyways.   We ordered:  2 Sodas (1.50 each!) Came in a can with a cup of ice, kinda pricey for one can of soda.  2 spring rolls (3.50) - We originally wanted egg rolls but our server said they didn't serve them and insisted we get the spring rolls. We usually love spring rolls but there was something funky about them.. the veggies in it looked old and the aftertaste kinda made me want to throw up.   #20 (6.99) Soft noodles with chicken was nothing of what we expected. The noodles were like ramen noodles, the chicken in it was weird and was heavily seasoned with black pepper.. didn't look appetizing and wasn't very enjoyable.   #37 (7.99) Chili shrimp was OK, could've been better.. there was only four pieces of shrimp in it and a buttload of veggies.   #6 Rare Beef Soup (6.99) was probably the best thing we ordered here. No problems with that.  Overall the food was meh.. I'll stick to my original pho places instead."}
{"text":"We are pretty picky with the places we eat at. So this place seemed very simple and it was not in the best neighborhood.  However, the food was very fresh and the owner and his wife are very nice.  A very pheasant surprise."}
{"text":"I saw reviews and that's what convinced me to go in but it was disgusting. It tasted like literal sea water with soy sauce took a bite & squid tasted like it wasn't thoroughly cooked. Sorry but that's a no go for me I couldn't even take another bite & felt sick for the rest of the day."}
{"text":"Reasonably priced, tasty and freshly prepared meals.  Recently remodeled.  Clean and roomy."}
{"text":"Triend this place for the 2nd time after a while, it just confirmed what I had sensed the first time. The meat portions on the Pho are ridiculously light, so the majority of what your eating is the rice noddles and the broth which is not bad. This place needs to rethink the portions of protein they are serving or it will soon face reality!"}
{"text":"I had the coconut curry chicken. All tasted delicious until I bit into a black rotten potato. I proceeded to throw up my entire meal at this establishment. The waitress spoke very little English and so I couldn't convey what happened and I ultimately ended up paying for the meal. This happened on Sat 1/17/15. I will never go here again. I understand accidents happen but I am so disturbed at how she looked at me and walked away. Did not even respond to the issue."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place ever since they opened and Seems it's under new ownership or management. I never complain about food even when it's not good, but this is more than not good. Right after picking up my to go chicken pho, I immediately noticed an unpleasant smell from the food. Broth had way too much oil and it's what smelled funny. Noodles were very dry, bean sprouts I could count how may there were and veggies were not fresh at all cause the mint did not even smell like mint anymore. This is definitely not the same place and food quality did a whole 180 turn, it's so sad."}
{"text":"I come here often and they haven't given me a reason not to come back.  The space is nice and clean and the service is pretty good.  Staff members are attentive and the food is prepared and served in a reasonable time.   As far as the food, I think it's in the top tier of good Vietnamese restaurants in the valley. I almost don't expect food to be as good for a place that's so clean. My go-to appetizer is the crispy egg rolls. Their pho is great, with regular and large size options. I order it with rare steak, meatballs and tripe and they never have an issue with a custom order. Figured it's worth noting since other restaurants don't take orders that aren't exactly how it is on their menus. I also like their special pork chop rice plate. Tasty marinade on the pork chop with some shredded pork and a fried egg on top, which I'm a sucker for.   They also sell boba (tapioca) drinks here. My only experience with that wasn't the greatest. Tasted good, but came with larger ice pieces than I'm used to.  I was chewing on ice with every sip. I'm just used to more of a slushee consistency when it comes to these drinks.   Overall, always a good experience at Pho AV. I've taken a few coworkers here and they like it too. I'll keep recommending this place those seeking good Vietnamese food in the area."}
{"text":"Very clean restaurant, big plus.  We ordered spring rolls and the seafood phò. The broth alone was very delicious, needless to say once we added all the extras: basil, sprouts, etc...it was even more so. Definitely will be back and will highly recommended."}
{"text":"Was really close to giving this place one star, but the food wasn't spoiled or anything which I use as a one-star guideline.  The issue I have with the food is that it lacks flavor or is over-salted. Instead of finding balance in the flavor of the food, the culinary vision here elects on a unconfident choices. Which is kind of a shame, considering how appetizing the MENU makes the dishes appear.   As a customer, this results in your expectations and your reality failing to match up. Expect to be disappointed and you'll be on the safer side.  The pho that I ordered was way underwhelming, and my partner's salad noodle dish was way too salted.  Suggestions for the owners: Get some control of your food. Return to the traditional roots of cooking broth early in the morning and regularly test your broth so you are not disappointed. Also, go to Da Vang Pho in central Downtown, or Pho Thanh, and remember how traditional southern Vietnamese pho tastes like. Because once you master that, you will bring in a lot more customers."}
{"text":"I got the combination pho and it didn't have much flavor to it and the portion was very small for the price."}
{"text":"THIS. PLACE. SUCKS.  They're lucky I have to give a star cause i forsure would give none if I could.  It took FOREVER for our food to come out. Never had to wait for pho that long. And then they messed up our order. Like what were you guys doing that whole time we were waiting?? My friend asked to sub egg noodles but i ended up with the egg noodles. And then when we called someone to fix it, knowing it took forever for our food to come out, we asked how long it would take and the dude said \"long\". Like wtf?! You've got to be kidding me. Then I'm already halfway through my meal and my avocado shake has still not come out. So i asked and the lady said \"oh oops sorry\". Like I'm already done with my meal and i still don't have my drink. And to top it all off, i had to call for a lady with water 3 times as she passed our table before she heard me and gave us water. Don't come here, they suck so much"}
{"text":"Good service. Spring rolls were good, but the sauce was too watery. The com thit nuong was a little below average. The pho was amazing!!! (After all, the pho is what makes the pho restaurant right? ) Pho broth was so good that I didn't have to add anything to it, and the meat portions were generous"}
{"text":"I'm new to town and in search of a good Pho. Tried this place and it was so-so. I'm from Southern California and I have tried many different Vietnamese restaurants and the Pho all have a similar taste. The Pho from Pho A.V has a nutmeg or cinnamon after taste. We order one beef slices Pho and one white meat chicken Pho, both in the \"large\" size. The beef pho had 8 small slices of beef. Not even enough for a sandwich. The chicken had a good amount of chicken but the broth flavoring threw the whole meal off. We even had another order of beef and broccoli and it had the same nutmeg flavoring. Although the prices were okay, the food looked good, I didn't like the nutmeg flavoring on everything and will not be going back again."}
{"text":"Love their Pho! Really authentic and great price for the amount of food that is given. You get friendly service and they are very quick to make the food. I always place an order To go and they have it ready in the approximate time they give you."}
{"text":"Horrible service, over cooked chicken in the pho, no fired appetizers, herbs with pho weren't fresh, and above all they were rude! The only savings grace was the noodles were cooked okay?"}
{"text":"Two years later and the food is still good. There are new owners but the items, quality, and the inexpensive price has remained.  Good size portions for a great price. I recommend once again!"}
{"text":"Always fresh, always good.  They usually show YouTube videos which is pretty entertaining."}
{"text":"Some of the best pho I've ever had. I tried the rare beef pho and would definitely order again. I went with my mom and she had it with chicken, also delicious. All of the add-ins (bean sprouts, cilantro, mint and jalapeño) were very fresh.  The veggie spring rolls were delightful and came with a tasty peanut sauce. Best of all, the prices are great. $7 for a HUGE bowl of soup.  Yes, there is a small language barrier but with a little patience and some gestures, it wasn't an issue. I wouldn't fault them for that, especially when the food is so good.  The interior is plain, but it's clean. Service was fast and they came by multiple tomes, always keeping our water glasses full. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Because of the holiday weekend  the Vietnamese restaurant I use go to is not open so I searched on yelp find this place. It's a small place, not fancy.  booth is broken feel uncomfortable. I ordered combination noodle soup and thai tea. The portion was big but not too much meat in it but a lot of soup.tasted ok Price was kind of price for what you get !Thai tea wasn't not fresh made its the bottle bought from market ! My service was very nice.but I prefer to chose other Vietnamese restaurant."}
{"text":"Dirty dirty dirty.  Didn't even order. Walked in and walked out after the smell of gross. Ugh.  Beware."}
{"text":"I think this is under new ownership. The pork in my bun i got was impossible to eat. The spring rolls were skinny, but the pho is still good. I dont know, I was so happy to have a viet place by my house but I dont always want pho and this makes it a bit of a disappointment. Bummer..."}
{"text":"Was expecting authentic Vietnamese food but didn't find it. Vermicelli were thicker and spaghetti-like, Goi Cun rolls were thick and chewy, and peanut sauce was watery and sweet (maybe a little sweet wine?). Here's hoping they can do better."}
{"text":"Definitely recommended.  I had lunch here and found the food to be very compelling and the prices entirely reasonable. I had the chicken pho -- a giant, steaming bowl of savory goodness with lots of rice noodles and excellent flavor. Probably not as much chicken as there could have been, but it was tender white meat and it was quite delicious.  The pho ga was accompanied by generous amounts of all the usual sides - bean sprouts, basil, cilantro, lime, and jalapeños.   The service was pretty solid and I will definitely be back.  All in all, a great find."}
{"text":"I saw a lot of great review from that place, I went to try it. It was not very busy. I order beef pho and my friends order chicken fired rice. The soup was kind of warm and soup was not has strong favor. It like missing the soul for it. However, the chicken fried rice was acceptable."}
{"text":"Delicious pho! These tiny restaurants seem to guarantee fresh, authentic ingredients and fantastic customer service. Ma and Pop are dolls, barely speak English, but are serving up hearty bowls of my favorite Vietnamese dish: seafood pho. It's a must try.   The number to call for carry out is (602) 923-0241. I had a hard time finding it."}
{"text":"Needing energy in prep for an afternoon hike in nearby Lookout Mountain, I went here because it was one of the few places open on Christmas day. This no-frills restaurant is small and clean and the service is friendly. I ordered the Vietnamese spring rolls and the chicken pho -- both were very good. The food was inexpensive, typical of most Vietnamese restaurants in the Valley."}
{"text":"Recomendable buen sabor, buena porción de los platillos y buenos precios! Si lo recomiendo"}
{"text":"Been twice now, good both times.  Divey, not an attractive decor, the owners speak broken english, but the pho is reasonable and good, the veggies have been fresh.  White gourd drink to complete the package."}
{"text":"Pho doesn't really exist in the north valley so I was very happy when this place opened up.  Great Pho can only be found in Chandler so this is but a stone's throw away from me.    They started out ok but over time I've seen steady improvement and love coming back.  When I have a craving for Pho on a cold stormy night, I come here and get my bowl on!   Excellent service, aromatic broth, great prices and service with a smile!  There are so many options but I always get #6.  Someday I'll venture to non Pho dishes."}
{"text":"I usually don't frequent this part of Phoenix but I happened to be in the area and was looking for a place to eat lunch. After noticing that there was a Vietnamese restaurant here in the strip mall I was immediately interested. What a great surprise! The pho here is probably one of the best, if not the best that I've had here in the valley so far. The vegetables were fresh and everything was very tasty. If I lived in this area I would definitely frequent this restaurant. Prices are very affordable too for the food being so great.  I'm curious to try their other options too if I ever come back here again. I can highly recommend this restaurant if you're looking for Vietnamese food in the area, was really surprised at how good it was."}
{"text":"Very, very slow service. My wife's Pho was pretty good, but my vermicelli was cold, spicy, and frankly not the dish I orders. We placed our order and sat for 50 minutes before our food appeared. It was hard to ignore that an asian couple came in, sat down, and was eating in under 10 minutes while we waited."}
{"text":"I tried this place based on the reviews and I am not sure how this place received great reviews other than from customer service.  When I walked in the first thing  I noticed  were the torn seats \"fixed \" with duct tape. Walls were a hideous light pink and dirty. We went ahead and ordered since the reviews claimed the food was great. I may not be giving it a fair shot because thd sound of the microwave was blowing my mind. My soup , and everything I ordered was being warmed up in a microwave, and it was obvious they only have one!At least mask this with music or something!!.  The guy hacking in the back was the icing on the cake. It turned comical when the lady came over to my Son, took his spoon and showed him how to put the sauce on his spring rolls, I guess she didn't  want him  dipping . We had a great kick out of that. Next big laugh was the pictures my Son took in the bathroom.  A paper held down by two rolls of toilet paper had been hand written on \"employees must was their hands\". It gets better, two trash cans with \"Thank you\" (like they have at most fast food places ) with duct tape around it so you cannot use it. My Son's 'soup' was in a plate, we couldn't figure it out but figured they were out of bowls? Lady didn't speak much English so who knows what she prepared in the microwave for him. She was kind enough to remove it from the bill. My Pho, not to tasty not much meat. Vegetables didn't look fresh. My food was ready out of the microwave first so it was brought out to me, then you can hear her adding my Son's \"soup\" to the microwave next.  Never again but I must admit we sure did have a great time laughing!"}
{"text":"Been here 5 times and each time the \"rare Beef pho\" it has been consistent and perfect. No ambiance what so ever, but server is attentive and responsive. If you like pho you will like this place."}
{"text":"WOW, I just had lunch at pho A.V and was very disappointed with the way I and my sister was treated. First, when we walked it the male owner was very nice and respectful, but once he went into the back and left his wife in the front she treated us like we were non paying customers! she went to every other table asking if their meal was nice and offering suggestions on the menus but never stopped at our table to see if we needed anything (which I did )  then once we were ready to leave we weren't offered anything to put our leftovers in we had to get them ourselves. she just watched us grab the to go cups and went right back on her phone. then when we were leaving my sister pointed out to me how she was giving to go cups to the table behind us! will not be returning to PHO A.V again and if your wanting pho yourself I would look into other pho establishments."}
{"text":"Good food, very nice people running the place, and the Viet Namese iced coffee was good, too.  Will definitely be heading back soon."}
{"text":"Small place but definitely worth trying.I ordered chicken pho and I would say it was more than enough for one person. This was my second time having a Pho and the flavor was amazing. It had the mild taste of herbs and that made it really  delicious."}
{"text":"A solid bowl of Pho. Not the best I've ever had but very good. Heavy on the star anise, a lot of licorice flavor, less herbaceous. The rare steak did not shrivel up and look like bacon. That by the way is a sign of cheap meat. Coming from Austin, TX where I only found one shop that had non bacon like tai this was great. I would come here again."}
{"text":"The Pho here is no good, the broth taste like hot water no flavor at all ,wonder why the price is so cheap . I rather drive far to PHO VIET place!!!"}
{"text":"Update- since I first started coming here they have made a lot of changes to the look of the restaurant. A LOT has been updated on the inside and still so delicious."}
{"text":"We love this pho, we usually get it to go because we like to eat in the comfort of our home."}
{"text":"The pho broth was way too sweet. We couldn't enjoy it. I also ordered the cold noodle salad but there is water at the bottom of the bowl so it diluted the sauce came with the salad. I was quite disappointed with the food. Service was fast but that's it."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch that is not to pricy and the Pho is really good.  Family run restaurant and well relaxed atmosphere."}
{"text":"Mom and pop operation. Very nice people. Food is good. Love their veggie egg rolls that come w green leaf lettuce, cilantro, mint. Chicken fried rice dish is large and tasty. My staff loves the pho. I haven't tried it yet."}
{"text":"Best Pho I've ever had.   One tip. Just order the pho. The waitress, though incredibly sweet, doesn't know very much English and if you ask her about an item she can't explain to you what it is. Expect weird/awkward service with lots of laughter from her.   The menu is confusing and they don't carry egg rolls anymore (even though they've been on the menu since we started coming here a couple weeks ago).   If you're looking for some delicious chicken pho with fresh veggies and incredibly fresh add ons (cilantro, bean sprouts, etc) this is the place.   We will be lifetime customers here no matter how many miscommunications there are because the pho is just that fricken good. The end"}
{"text":"Really good stuff. Very reasonably priced. I like coming here for a healthy lunch, and they have lots of tasty beverages too. Highly recommend coming here if ur a fan of pho like me."}
{"text":"Never had a chance to try the food. Nobody came to take our order so we had to leave. The restaurant was not busy at the time."}
{"text":"Solid Pho. Always tasty. Good portions. Can be difficult to get them on the phone or order ahead. But it's worth the hassle.   Don't let the location scare you off, it's some of the best in Phoenix"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times. After reading about how good the pho tai was, I had to try it. It is really good. Next time a different menu item."}
{"text":"Pho was great had tripe and tendon which is my favorite.  The spring rolls were very good as well."}
{"text":"Amazing food..it is obvious this couple puts tender loving care in all they do. Im having fun going and trying different things on the menu. A must try for all who want to tantalize their taste buds..... A plus.... michelle"}
{"text":"The peanut sauce was watered down! I guess to cut  down on costs! The spring roll wasn't made with cabbage but shredded salad mix."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Whenever I'm sick I like to get the pho to go.  They do such a great job of packaging it all up with all the fixings and sauces.  So delicious and nice to be able to have in the comfort of your own home.  Everything is always fresh and ready fast.   Tonight I also tried the chicken fried rice and it was a hit.  So glad they are just down the street."}
{"text":"Northern Phoenix doesn't have very good Vietnamese food so when I heard about this place we had to try it.  The location is a bit scary, near a food city and a rent to own center blaring music and advertising in Spanish. Thought I was in the wrong place.  The restaurant was empty on this Saturday and that also gave me some second thoughts but too late to turn back. The wife was starving anyway. Said she would faint if I didn't feed her soon. The waitress here does not speak English so it must be authentic right?    Ordered the spring rolls to start. In Vietnamese the spring rolls are soft not crispy and served with peanut sauce. These had moist wrappers which is good. Better than hard and dry. They had grilled pork and shrimp. The pork wasn't that well seasoned but not bad. At least they have hoisin and siracha on the table.  Wide had the combination pho and I had the rice noodle bowl. The pho bowl was huge!  Largest I've seen in some time. Soup is on the darker side but tasty. Decent amount of meat, tripe, etc. The vegetables to go with it are mostly been sprouts, a small amount of basil and cilantro and a couple shavings of jalapeño.  Overall good but if your hungry you may want to get some extra noodles. Plenty of broth so should work well.   My meal was large also. The fish sauce is a bit tame. Grilled pork is not really grilled but cooked more bugogi style. Tasty though. You get some shrimp and a crispy style spring roll. Nice!  I stole some cilantro and basil from my wife and broke it up to mix in. Good stuff!!  In summary a good place for an unassuming meal that is a good value."}
{"text":"I used to love this place and would have given it at least 4 stars before. The food is pretty good, the prices are reasonable, and the service used to be nice. I came here for dinner for the first time in a few weeks last night. The booths they had before have been replaced by tables, which may have caused some disturbance for the residents of this restaurant... because THREE different ROACHES made an appearance on our table while we had our meal. I love this place, but I'm going to give them some time to get their pest problem under control before I come back here...."}
{"text":"Noodles. I have been in search of noodles for a while nearby my house and this place has come up a couple of times. After having the craving for Pho once again, I finally decided to try this place out.  I've had Pho a couple of times from a couple of different places and have watched videos about how to eat it, so I consider myself a sort of Pho \"expert.\" (not really, I jest)  Ordered the shrimp & pork Pho and a veggie Pho in beef broth for the hubby and brought home the care package they sent home. It is always such a presentation. All fresh and cooked ingredients, separate from the delicious broth, some fish sauce cooked with green onions and the chili sauce separate.   They were both amazing. Perfectly heated, perfectly seasoned and when it all came together we were both extremely full and happy.  We will definitely be coming back again soon to satiate our Pho cravings."}
{"text":"Really good food! I mean it, just really good wholesome food especially when craving Pho.  Ambiance is... Well, it's simple. No music playing. No fancy decorations. Booths on the right side and regular tables with chairs on the left side. No hostess stand that I could remember so my friend and I just sat ourselves at one of the booths.   My friend wanted nothing else but Pho for her birthday and her favorite go-to place was closed so we ended up here. Compiled with a Food City strip mall and some abandoned stores nearby, the outside is not very promising but that's where some of the best \"hole in the walls\" are found.   Exterior and I guess simple interior aside, once we bit into our shrimp spring rolls and dipped them into the peanut sauce, we soon forgot the surroundings and became immersed in our food. The shrimp pho was one of her favorites. I enjoyed curry with shrimp and carrots and potatoes. These dishes were so simple yet very full of flavor and comforting with how cold it's been this December holiday season.   There was only one waitress handling all the tables and it was a bit hard to understand what she was saying but it didn't matter because she figured out exactly what we wanted when we ordered. There were only 2 patrons when we walked in but by the time we were done eating, the small humble restaurant was nearly full! Who knew that noon on a Sunday would be a prime time for craving Pho? Even though service fell a little behind as it got busier, my friend and I found the place charming in its own way, but mainly because of how the food made us feel! We will definitely return again!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to give this place a shot because its the closest pho restaurant to our home. We usually travel to Mesa for our favorite pho restaurant but thought we should go ahead and try the nearest option in case it was awesome and based on the reviews it was promising. When we arrived we were literally the only customers. This should've been the first sign to turn around and leave, but again we were willing to give it chance (I mean the yelp reviews seemed good). We sat down and ordered, the rare beef pho for me and the combination pho for my boyfriend, our usual. Service was pleasant enough and we were hopeful. As we awaited our food, we heard the unmistakable \"ding\" of a microwave. Yep, that's right, it appeared as if we were about to receive microwave pho. The pho was delivered and all I can say is it tasted like microwave pho. It was edible, but the pho is all about the broth and the broth was bland and not the deep, flavorful broth you would expect from a great pho restaurant. Needless to say, neither of us have the desire to return here again."}
{"text":"So, 7pm, we are watching TV and for some reason I say to my hubby: \"So, you have not tried a Vietamese restaurant, uh?\"  We usually have dinner around 5-6~ but we had not eaten yet... I had only gone to 2 pho places and my favorite was way West, so that was a no-no. I checked Yelp and found Pho A.V. On our way we are. The service was great, and since our Vietnamese is... non existent... we just ate whatever the owner recommended... Spring Rolls (pork) with peanut sauce, #8 pho, and daughter ordered sesame shrimp (#45) If you are familiar with the options, the lady waitress can take the numbers, if you need additional details or have a special request you may need to communicate directly with the owner. We also had the iced coffee with condensed milk. The service was great, they are super friendly. Also, the water was really good..."}
{"text":"The Pho soup was hot and delicious, I enjoy going to this restaurant, depending on the shaft, some days you might get more vegetables than others, been here three times, and I'll go back"}
{"text":"I too have prayed for a spot for Pho in my neighborhood and we finally have it !!!  As in previous reviews the physical restaurant is nothing special, clean and uninteresting, but........THEY KNOW HOW TO MAKE A BOWL OF PHO.  Happy Happy. I had the seafood and loved it.  Nice amount of seafood and noodles and an excellant broth.  We also ordered the three beef, also good, lots of bits and pieces of beef.  The owner/cook is a very nice gentleman. The server does not speak English but is also exceptionally sweet and welcoming.  I will be back and try other things on the menu.  But I now know  I can get a satisfactory Pho experience five minutes from home and I am thankful."}
{"text":"New owners took over since my last review. This place has a good pho broth, sometimes a little salty. They don't put a lot of meat in it. If you order \"to go\" be prepared to not have your order ready. I've arrived for pickup three times where they didn't start my order until I arrived. Don't order take out when they're busy. Eat there if you can, the overall experience will be better. My one major gripe was my wife is pregnant and can't eat sprouts, they threw them on anyway, and when we asked for a fresh dish they just brought back the same one and took of the sprouts. That's dangerous. I'll mark it up to ignorance, but not cool."}
{"text":"I'm taking a caregiver class over on this side of town and we get an hour of lunch. I felt like treating myself to some pho since my class is from 9-5.   Was worried when I walked in because it was completely dead at lunch time, then when I sat down about 10 others walked in after me.    Service was straight to the point and fast and the food came even faster and tasted great.  Ordered your typical fried rice house special so don't judge me on my pho expertise...cuz now that I think about it that's literally all I ever order...but either way I love me some friiiiied rice. ESPECIALLY Vietnamese fried rice my dude.   So basically I will be coming here everyday I have my class at lunch time. Maybe even try sometime new (;"}
{"text":"This humble spot has THE BEST PHO in the Valley...  The price is perfect, portions perfect and the I eat here 4 out of 5 days in my workweek when I'm in town.  I'm always super impressed with this operation - you would drive by it otherwise."}
{"text":"Outstanding.  Pho was perfect, though the beef combination was supposed to have tendon and oxtail, I didn't get much of either.     Would be nice to have an option for just tendon or oxtail.   Lime grass chicken was superb.  Never had flavor like that before. Nice and mellow, sparse decor.  Old Vietnam war propaganda on the wall. Don't go for a dining experience, go for killer food and a full belly."}
{"text":"Not sure if it's because of new ownership, but this place did not live up to the reviews.  Service was awful- we waited 45 minutes for our food and they lost our check.  We were excited for the pho (both got rare beef) but disappointed as it was greasy and bland.  We'll keep looking for a good pho place, unfortunately this wasn't it."}
{"text":"Love this place! Cheap, kinda friendly, but usually the more unsocial the Vietnamese place is, the better it is! Always my go to Pho!"}
{"text":"I came here a couple of weeks ago for a quick lunch while in the area. Family owned, when I walked in, owner's son was there, helping his mom. Perhaps he was off school for the fall break. He wasn't really working working, whenever he notices customers will need anything, he would go get his mom in the back in the kitchen.  I ordered Pho Dac Viet, special Pho to enjoy different meats as I was hungry. Vietnamese food has been my comfort food, their broth always help me feel my tummy better, and noodles and meat serves as my instant fuel.   I notice they also serve large size on the menu, since this was my first time, I didn't know the portion size, I just ordered regular. I eat a lot, and wished I ordered large size. It's not that much different in price, I would order large size at my next visit."}
{"text":"My daughter took me here since I was helping her move.   I know she loves pho.   Me?  I tried in once in Seattle.   Bland.   That's all I could say.   Never to try it again till now.  She suggested I order the \"6. Pho Tai (Rare Beef Soup) Sliced beef eye round, bean sprout, basil, lime, cilantro, rice noodle in beef broth.\"  I had thought I might want chicken or shrimp or, I don't know.   Something other than beef.  Nope.   She suggested I go with the beef.  They bring the bean sprouts, lime, basil, and cilantro separate on a plate, which is to be added as one desires.    The beef and noodles in broth were brought.  I tasted it.   Hmmm.   Bland as I remembered.   She added chili paste and Sriracha sauce.   I followed suit.   Hmmmm. ... It was starting to taste better.   Since the broth is really hot, the sprouts and everything else cooked.   By the time I got done adding the Sriracha sauce and chili paste, it was great!   I loved the flavor of the broth.  I think both seasonings made whatever spices were in the broth pop.     I would definitely try this dish at  this or another Vietnamese restaurant.   I'm not sure who waited on us.   Maybe the owners?   The restaurant is sort of a mom and pop sort of place."}
{"text":"This is not the best Pho place I've ever eaten at, but it is the best in the Valley!  I had two slightly different experiences. The first, I found the Pho under seasoned and too lightly flavored.  The second, the Pho was perfectly concentrated and seasoned and really tasted delicious.  I would go back and give it another try!"}
{"text":"Food was good...but atmosphere and service could use some help. It also didn't seem very clean. It was very warm and they weren't running the A/C.  Needs decorations, a thorough cleaning, and major renovations.  I feel bad to give this review as I am sure the owners have limited finances. I have also only been one time...so it could have been an off day.   I truly wish this place well, with money and renovations it could be an AMAZING little hole in the wall Pho place. I would come back...just most likely I would get take out next time."}
{"text":"I have had the Pho Ga and Pho Tai.  Both are great.  It is now a regular stop in my weekly lunch spots."}
{"text":"I am abandoning my \"Two Visits For A Good Review\" policy for this little jewel of a \"Pho Phind!\"  Since two of my three favorite \"Pho Restaurants\" have closed (Dragonfly in Mesa and Pho Ao Sen, also in Mesa, now Pho Number One and NOT very good) I have been left with only Pho Van in Chandler as my only \"go to for Pho\" Restaurant.  Okay, so you have to overlook the seedy, bordering on dilapidated, interior of the Restaurant (assume it was left that way by the previous Chinese Restaurant tenant) but if you do you will be treated to a PHABULOUS BOWL OF PHO!  Pho of this quality should be attracting far more than the three Diners present on a Saturday evening at 7 PM. Very hard to find Pho as good as this and I know, I have been to most ALL of the \"Pho Joints\" in Phoenix and the East Valley.  Spring Rolls are no better than others, but here the PHO IS THE STAR!  My fellow diners (Pho Phanatics as well!) agreed as to the quality of this Pho. This is just plain GREAT PHO!  I will give it only Four Stars because of the interior of the Restaurant, but the Pho is definitely Five Stars!  Incidentally, if you go during the day, you can also pick up something from the Best of Europe Meats and Deli in the same Shopping Center."}
{"text":"Pho A.V. has the best Pho I have found in North Phoenix! The broth is really flavorful, and the veggies are fresh. Location and atmosphere leave a bit to be desired, but you can't be the food and prices!"}
{"text":"What an amazing experience. Undoubtedly the best Pho I've had in the valley, but HALF the price! It's obvious that the owners love food and love their customers. Help a wonderful local business blossom!"}
{"text":"Total whole in the wall divey type atmosphere.   The owners are humble and accommodating to your needs. I've tried this place before, and left a somewhat negative review..however being sick with bronchitis and not wanting to travel real far, I pulled out my yelp app and placed an order for some chicken pho, beef pho and egg rolls (which they no longer have)Said it would be ready in 10 mins.  We arrived in about 2 minutes, and we're greeted promptly. My mom was with me and decided to add some more to our order. She added an shrimp fried rice, as well as an Beef Combo plate. Or wait from there was a solid 10 minutes. Everything was nearly packed, included an abundant amount of condiments and fresh bean sprouts, cilantro, herbs, housing and chile garlic sauce.   The Chicken Pho was pretty decent, full of rich deep brothy flavors of anise and all slow boiled chicken.  Very therapeutic for my burning lungs!! I liked that all the fixings came packed separately, so that I could control how much rice noodles to put in my bowl, along with all the other fixings.    Beef pho, had a sweet sort of back ground taste to it, which I really didn't prefer. Still okay, if you're a beef lover I suppose. Same packaging as well.   Shrimp fried rice....lacked the um..shrimp. I think maybe  my husband got to it before any one else could, but either way was just alright. Not great.   Won't frequent here too often, but will perhaps only  for the chicken pho."}
{"text":"Not the greatest of anything. Prices are oddly high for entrees that don't have much protein but flavors are good. Appetizers are well-priced. Service is not great, so be patient. I'd give it more stars if service was better."}
{"text":"The food is always amazing. I hate that yelp makes me write more than I want to to post a review. One sentence should be enough."}
{"text":"Delish!!! I love pho but I hate it that I always come out smelling like fish from Vietnamese places, not this one. The cleanest, friendliest, and one of the yummiest services ever!  I'm going to be a regular since I just moved to the area. :)"}
{"text":"This place is so good and not expensive! Me and my husband can leave only spending $15 with tip! The pho is fantastic and we also have had egg roles, spring roles and a fried pancake with pho toppings ( can't remember what that one was called) The owner is very nice and I have the greatest food and experience every time. Take out is just as good also!"}
{"text":"Just moved to this part of town and found this place. The pho is amazing!!!egg rolls out of this world. Good prices and nice portions. My only complaint is the service,there was only one server, and she didn't look happy to be there at all..we felt like we weren't welcome in there..I tried to ask for more limes and she never brought them to me. Ordered a taro smoothie and she decided to make it about 10 minutes before we left. If you don't like your job don't be there, we are paying customers and we like to be treated better. I would definitely go back for the food but not for the service"}
{"text":"Had the rare steak pho. Meat was mediocre and soup was lacking flavor and little off. Enjoyable but definitely average (although have been to around 50 pho restaurants)."}
{"text":"Just had the absolute best experience ordering food last night so I had to come here to give them their kudos!  I walked in here around 750, and knowing that this Mom & Pop location closes at 8, I immediately apologized when I went to ask for a take-out menu.  (I believe the owner was the one who helped me) He not only seemed happy to see me, but even made recommendations without rushing me at all! After he apologized that they were out of vermicelli for the night so one of the dishes I ordered wasn't available, he offered me a free drink from the cooler (which I declined).   The final kicker was that the bill came out to around $17, so I was looking for a $20 to speed up the transaction. I didn't have one...so he asked me how much cash I had so he could discount my meal. Amazing!  I declined that too as I too was once an immigrant child growing up with a small business, but absolutely gracious gestures from a family owned restaurant has me totally won over.   The food is absolutely top-notch too, they've had articles and awards from Phoenix New Times, etc. so GO. GO NOW! Enjoy some scrumptious food and help us a great local business!"}
{"text":"I've caught a cold or something from somewhere and have been dying for some soup to help. In comes Pho A.V. to save the day!  It's a small little mom & pop restaurant. The owners don't speak English very well, but they do know how to make a mean pho. Their menu is pretty extensive but so far I've just had their amazing pho.  I came in for lunch last week. I sat down with no problem and was waited on promptly. I order the combination pho. It came with all the dressings on the side. Everything was delicious! My only complaint is that there wasn't enough tripe.  I've been back once or twice since. Totally inexpensive and so so delicious!  Pho for the win!"}
{"text":"I was surprised to find out there was a new Vietnamese restaurant so close to my house. I usually go to Da Vang on 19th Ave. I was hopeful this would be my new place to go...Unforunately, it won't be. Like previous reviews stated, there was a definite communication barrier with the waitress. I did not recieve what I ordered but when I pointed out the issue she didn't understand so I just ate what she brought. The pho wasn't bad but it wasn't the best I've had.  My main issue with this place was the fact that nothing, and I mean NOTHING was cooked fresh in that kitchen. Every SINGLE thing that came out of the kitchen was heated up in the microwave. I kept hearing the ding ding ding of the microwave and then a bowl of soup would come out. In my opinion pho just doesn't taste as good when it's reheated, especially in a microwave. Perhaps it had to do with the fact that the owner was the only one in there and maybe he thinks its faster/easier to just reheat instead of cooking things fresh, regardless I did not like the results.   I sincerely hope the owner does well, but I will not be going back. I will go back to my usual place. Although its further, at least I know my soup will be hot and fresh. They're so busy I bet they cook it multiple times a day."}
{"text":"2nd time we've been here since the new ownership took over. The food is great but the service is just ridiculously bad. Especially the lady who unfortunate we assumed would be the owner. Both times we came there was no hi or smile.  2nd time was worst than the first time. Not even acknowledged when we walked in. All the tables were dirty and instead of smiling or say something like \"we will be right with you\" she spoke to a gentleman in their language to clean a table for us. And it took a few minutes after we sat down to get the menu and water. She came quickly after we got the menus to take our order...a little too quick in my opinion..good thing we order the same almost every time so it was easy to order but we felt rushed.  We would come back for the food but I don't know if we really want to spend our money for a bad experience."}
{"text":"I've never actually eaten in the restaurant. I just pick up and bring it home.   I always get the same thing...the #6! Its the thinly sliced beef pho. It is SOOO good. They give you loads of yummy stuff to make it how you like. The portions are so large I usually get 2-3 meals out of one order. I also love the spring rolls with peanut sauce.   Anytime I'm feeling like I'm under the weather I stop in for the pho and I swear it makes me feel better."}
{"text":"Very friendly people and good pho in the neighborhood. Their chili oil is great. Make sure to specify you want it if you place a to-go order and get extra. Everything is always fresh and the broth definitely has a special something that makes it better than some other places I've been."}
{"text":"Food packed for to go order was excellent. Great spring roll and Pho. Kudos to owner, we will be back!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is so amazing. Their pho broth is really good and their beef is fantastic. Recommend this to any one if they love pho"}
{"text":"I highly recommend this place.  I found this place on yelp and decided to give it a try.  I'm so glad that I did.  I ordered the beef pho, lemongrass chicken, and spring  roll.  The food was very good!!!  The place is not fancy but it was nice, welcoming, and very clean.  The people who work there were also very friendly and helpful.  I definitely will be coming back for more."}
{"text":"NEW OWNERS/management. Pretty sad about the change! We loved this place! We knew something was up when the little lady who always serves us wasn't there. Changed their menus, there's a TV...but worse of all, the food absolutely sucks! Super bland pho, scary looking meat in the bahn mi. Bring back the old owners!!"}
{"text":"Our favorite for Pho. Yes, bare bones seating in  lower end strip mall, but top notch food. We have had all the variations and they all are great."}
{"text":"Pho-king delicious!!!!!!!!!!! Great authentic space with wonderful Pho. Had the Beef Pho with extra veggies and filled my happy little belly to the brim! Great price too!  I'll be making my way back as much as possible!"}
{"text":"So I used to come here all the time. The spring rolls were my absolute favorite and I drove from central Scottsdale for their food. Today I got my food and it was different- tasteless, dry, not fresh. I called and found out this place is under new ownership and the old people are no longer there. It's very unfortunate Bc this used to be a very authentic delicious cuisine."}
{"text":"I am so happy I found this place! Especially because I'm going to be moving around here. Such great pho! The service was welcoming and our order came out the way we ordered it, as well really fresh!   I got the regular size chicken pho with shrimp added and my husband got the large seafood pho. We both finished ours, which never happens.   For appetizer we got the egg rolls, so good! To end it, my husband got the taro smoothie. (It's just powder blended with ice and bobas) was still, really good!   All in all this place gets 5 stars, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Hands down best pho in az ! We've been everywhere in search of pho with great tasting broth . Pho av has best broth and tender brisket . Their prices are unreal too tonight we had fresh made dumplings as an appetizer $2.99 and so flavorful . Nice hardworking family great food !"}
{"text":"Try the beef Pho! Absolutely delicious!! Don't let the appearance keep you away. This place is definitely worth a try!!"}
{"text":"Great food and friendly people. The PHO is the best! The PHO CHICKEN was hot and very tasty. Very clean and fast service. Glad to see PHO on this side of town. Want to try every PHO Bowl on the menu."}
{"text":"Walked in to this hole in a wall Vietnamese restaurant nearby since I was craving Pho. We ordered the spring rolls, beef pho and combination vermicelli. Food was savory and served fresh and hot! The broth was perfect! I just wished the service was a little faster."}
{"text":"I am kinda surprised by the recent bad reviews of Pho A.V..... I thought  itis a great little spot for anyone looking for quick, inexpensive and delicious Vietnamese food. I ordered the number 35, which was egg noodle soup with pork wontons, shrimp, squid, sliced pork, fish meatballs and a quail egg ($7.99).  I found my broth to be full bodied, and flavorful. My egg noodles were cooked perfectly and the portion was huge. I came here with a couple of friends before their flight out of phoenix and they all had complimentary things to say about their meals as well. Service was efficient, their is plenty of parking, and I thought the value for the food was above what I was expecting. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Just moved from NYC and this place is right up there with the legit viet places in Queens and BK. Pho was on point. No frills atmosphere, but who cares. And at $6.99 for a huge bowl it is Def worth the trip."}
{"text":"Loved that they gave you so many vegetable to put in your soup.  Some places get stingy.  The chicken Pho was amazing and the staff was so friendly.  The soup came out fast and piping hot!"}
{"text":"Went based of Yelp reviews and got a win. It's a total (BYOB!!!) hole in the wall, but very clean and 100% authentic, only one person spoke English and that's exactly how I like my Asian. We ordered the Beef PHO and the coconut chicken and beef, both were amazing and let me tell you the bill was $15, we left a $15 tip."}
{"text":"Since I moved to this area last year, I've prayed every day for a Vietnamese restaurant on this side of town and lo and behold- we finally have one! It's even biking distance!  This place is very newly opened with unremarkable interior- in other words, exactly like the types of Vietnamese restaurants I would frequent in my childhood in Utah and California.  The people are super sweet, and the old man had extra kind and gracious manners. I got two bowls of pho tai for takeout, and was pleased to see that saw leaf herb was included (rau ngo om ).  Saw leaf herb is typically a little pricier than the standard bean sprouts and basil, so I always give extra kudos when extra effort is made in including this very traditional herb.  The broth itself was solid; I usually like a little more anise flavor but it was still favorable nonetheless.  All in all, I was very pleased and hope they receive the support they deserve!"}
{"text":"Man do I love pho. I always get excited when I'm in an area I've never been and can check out a new Vietnamese food spot. It's a bit hard to find from the street. You can't see it from 32nd st or Bell Rd. It is in the back corner behind McDonald's and next to Food City. I was greeted right away and shown to a seat and given a menu to look over. I was pleasantly surprised at the great prices. There are two different sizes of pho portions, great appetizers, sandwiches, and drinks. I heard others eating how great the iced coffee is, but since I'd already had three before coming I decided on water lol. After reading over the menu I decided on Brisket and sliced beef pho with the two pork egg rolls. The egg rolls cane with fish sauce with a jalapeño inside. So so so good! The regular bowl of pho was a huge portion. The beef was tender and once I added some bean sprouts, sriracha and jalapeño it had just the right spice as well.  I also saw they have a seafood pho that looked pretty amazing. I'll have to come back and try that with their iced coffee."}
{"text":"I came in to Pho AV a year and half ago for lunch, I liked the food but didn't think they are THAT good. As time went by I dined in lots and lots of Vietnamese restaurants and I found none of them can surpass Pho AV! I didn't realize this until I found myself craving for their pho more and more often.    Their food is just simple, and done right. Nothing too fancy, but it is everything you would ask for when you want pho. I always order their #7 meatball pho. Their summer roll is Devine as well, with the best peanut butter sauce I can find in town.   For some reason this place is never too busy, but that's absolutely not a downside for me. Waitress does not speak a whole lot of English, but she's such a lovely lady :) always nice and provides great service. And she remembers what I order:)"}
{"text":"Great Place! Went as first timers(me and my BF) and were very pleased. I ordered the egg rolls(comes with two and some great Dipping sauce), fried rice and the beef Pho. We shared everything and still had left overs. Everything was great and the service was outstanding. The staff were extremely friendly and accommodating.  The music on the TV was great and gave a great vibe. The place was very clean also. The only negative thing I could think of was the beef in the pho was a little fatty but you can just pick it out, just never had that in pho before. Regardless, I give 5 stars and highly recommend you give it a shot! I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great spot. The food was tasty. We ordered spring rolls, egg rolls, pho and fried rice and it was all tasty. The Thai tea with boba was also good! Service was great."}
{"text":"AH-mazing! I had no idea this place was inside that shopping center. I was craving Pho today so I was hoping not to be disappointed. They far exceeded my expectations! Looking forward to taking my friends and family here. So good!"}
{"text":"Pretty sure this is in what used to be AA Wok.  It is in the northeast corner of the Food City parking lot. Anyway, have to admit this was my first taste of pho. Brought my son, who claims to have had pho \"thousands of times\".   The place just opened and it is sparsely laid out and not a place that will impress you with it's decor (or lack of it). The sign at the counter said cash only, but there was a Visa/MasterCard sign on the register. The woman at the counter was very friendly, yet didn't get the impression she  spoke much English so figured since I had cash I wouldn't  try paying by card.   Good Friday meant we were going meatless. Som was bummed that he couldn't get the rare beef, but since he wasn't buying he didn't really have a say.  Ordered up two seafood soups and sat down at one of the tables. A very pleasant man came from the kitchen to confirm our orders and off he went....presumably to make our order. The woman returned with some glasses of water and came back again minutes later with plates of bean sprouts, cilantro, sliced jalapeño, and lime wedges. Once last trip brought each of them bringing HUGE bowls of soup.   As I mentioned earlier, this was my first bowl of pho, so don't have anything to measure it against. However, I munched down everything in that bowl then slurped up all the broth that was left. Good stuff!   Thought the it was going to be $7.99 a bowl, yet the bill rang up as $6.99 a piece. Didn't want to haggle, so I let it go? :)  Sure the hard core pho foodies  could weigh in with more educated reviews, but I enjoyed my first foray into pho. The food was tasty, but doubt the interior is going to impress anyone. The people were very sweet and I wish the best for them.  Go check it out!"}
{"text":"Under new ownership. It just isn't the same. The new woman at the front counter could use a smile.  The food has changed and isn't quite to my liking anymore. I suppose I'll look for a new spot!"}
{"text":"My my. What a find. Do not let this place fool you. It looks pretty plain but their food is amazing. Spring rolls very good. Rare beef soup (#6 and you want to have this one) best ever!!  Fried catfish w ginger sauce very good and Coconut Milk Shrimp that is to die for. Can't wait to go back. Really enjoyed this place. TIP. If you do takeout, check the containers leaks do happen lol."}
{"text":"Really good for the price! Decent portion, tasty and quick! Got the Pho Thai which is always my go to.  Did unfortunately have a communication error, which I understand can happen when ordering authentic Pho, but was still a bit frustrating. Didn't get enough chili sauce to make my soup to my liking.  I also found it odd there was no Chinese soup spoon included. Disposable ones are like 10¢ each and make for a much more enjoyable experience.  All in all, will go again when I get a hankering and don't want to travel too far!"}
{"text":"Parking: spacious  Environment: clean, booths, not great for groups greater than 6.   Service: good  Food: good. I got hu tieu and shrimp spring roll. Pretty good."}
{"text":"I called for to-go, they answered. On the dot at 10 am when they open. Very kind woman took my order, she spoke English and was very polite. I ordered Goi Cuon and Bi Cuon, I am not a fan of peanut sauce, even though I am sure theirs is absolutely amazing. I like fish sauce so I asked to sub it. Oh, they have the best fish sauce and the best shredded pork fresh spring rolls to date. All that is expected was provided inside these wrapped greatness of heaven: bean sprouts, cilantro, mint, shredded pork, light vermicelli, dark green greens. Super good and a huge amount of pork, all tightly wrapped in a very fresh rice wrapper. Same with the Goi Cuon, large shrimps, good pork, fresh greens and that is that, that means excellent in this case.   The customer service was awesome, I asked for either Sambal or Sriracha. She made me two little to-go cups of Sriracha, perfect amount. They were very friendly, my order came out quick and was fully accurate.  Cheap price, great food and excellent customer service...I mean really? Can you ask for anything else??"}
{"text":"The outside doesn't look like much but don't let this deter you! The food is great and priced perfect. I'd go here again in a heart beat."}
{"text":"Delicious Pho Chicken soup with all the goodies, fresh bean sprouts, basil & cilantro! Yum!"}
{"text":"I love this place !! Definitely by far my favorite pho spot I have found ! They give you good amount of meat , noodles , herbs , etc ! The only reason I'm docking them a star is because they will randomly close for the day .. so when I've gone the opposite way home from work just go get dinner and arrive to find \"closed just today\" it's frustrating . I've learned to call first and if they don't answer it means no ones there .  Otherwise an awesome place with awesome prices !"}
{"text":"This place is a bit of a hole in a wall, but I'm keen on those. Their prices are great. My pho was $7, and I don't feel that pho should ever be more than $9. Those places that are priced high aren't usually authentic. Pho was really good, and believe me, I'm a pho connoisseur. The bowl was huge and was enough for two. The soft noodles with beef has great flavor with a bit of spiciness. It has fresh carrots, broccoli, bamboo shoots, and onions. This is definitely my favorite place in the valley!"}
{"text":"Their pho is pretty good. I tried their seafood egg noodle soup and that taste great. It's really delicious! Their egg rolls are great as well. The owner there is very friendly. Actually, all of their servers are nice.  They even make me fresh lemonade sodas I like.  Prices are great as well. I definitively recommend this place if you live up in North Phoenix."}
{"text":"Not impressed!! Lacking traditional Vietnamese goodies and very poor service..food was fresh but small servings."}
{"text":"My sister and I love this place. What a little gem. The pho is amazing! Best pho I have found in Phoenix to date."}
{"text":"Discovered this little gem about a year ago and probably go once every 2-3 weeks for a quick cheap meal. Their Pho is always delicious and a good sized portion. The fried rice is also good, but haven't had much luck with the other entrees. Stick with the Pho and you'll be in heaven."}
{"text":"Fantastic Pho and spring rolls!  The restaurant is quite basic but the food (and the prices) are great.  I cant wait to go back!"}
{"text":"My review is based on just two items- beef pho and shrimp & pork spring roll   The spring roll was good but the accompanying peanut sauce lacked flavor. I had to add on oyster & siracha sauces.   Pho noodle was exceptionally done- nice & chewy, not over cooked. However, the broth was waaaayyy too oily. It was the fluid type and couldn't even separate from broth. I usually drink half the broth but couldn't even touch it here."}
{"text":"I've been searching for Pho since we moved to Phoenix and by golly my kingdom has come! We walked in when it opened and it was pretty empty, but I was excited to smell the beloved star anise that I knew was simmering in my pho-to-be! I quickly glanced over the menu to see what I could order for my 18 month old and I. Spring rolls, round-eye pho, and chicken curry. Everything came out swiftly and deliciously. The pho was hot (temp wise), the spice in the curry was just right, and since there was shrimp in the spring rolls I got to scarf them both down with every last drop of that delicious peanut sauce by myself as my toddler is allergic! The waitress did not speak any english, but when she placed down the spring roll she put the peanuy sauce on the roll for me. Haha! It was cute! Also, when I asked for to-go boxes she sat down at the table and sweetly helped put all the food away while kissing my toddler. I am so happy to have found this place I love introducing new places to friends and family so i'm looking forward to more pho adventures here in the future!"}
{"text":"Love this little spot!! Nice and simple. I always order the rare pho soup and it never disappoints."}
{"text":"The Pho was very delicious but I was not that impressed with the #16. Helpful tip, do not order over the phone the person answering does not understand english very well, even when trying to order with just numbers."}
{"text":"Quaint little place with awesome food. I eat pho all over the United States and I was NOT disappointed. Continued success!"}
{"text":"I think this is the worst Vietnamese food I've ever had. When we walked in the restaurant was empty except for the waitress. The spring rolls were okay, but the peanut sauce was watery. I had the Bun, and the meat tasted like it was cooked leftovers. You can hear the waitress back in the kitchen putting everything in the microwave. Maybe if they had some sort of music, you wouldn't be able to hear that. We come down from Sedona and enjoy having pho when we come to town.  I definitely won't be coming back to this one."}
{"text":"Best pho I've had so far in the valley, just wish they would put some egg rolls on the menu!!!"}
{"text":"Best authentic pho in the valley! Very reasonably priced, definitely coming back again. The staff were very friendly and open to answering any and all questions. Food was delivered to the table within 5-10 minutes of ordering. Great atmosphere, very welcoming and inviting. Thank you and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"It's two staff restaurant . The wife and the husband. It took some time to get order, our food, and the check. The Pho soup was good. The \"grilled\" beef was  stir fry."}
{"text":"So glad to have found this place.  Being from Cali, I've been spoiled with good pho but this mom and pop shop can hold their ground!! After having pho Thanh for 2 years in the valley, my family and I tried pho av after moving to paradise valley recently.  I gotta be honest, I don't think I'll be going back to pho Thanh.  I got the combination pho, the broth was clean, fragrant and very flavorful.  No film of excessive film of oil and no smell of old meat.  The soup was clear and piping hot.  The noodles were on point slightly al dente and loaded with meat.  The egg rolls were delicious, and my wife loved the pho Thai.  Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"It is time that I updated my review for Pho AV.  I have had three very good meals here in the last couple of months. They have updated the decor, and the service has developed a marvelous memory for regular customers' favorite orders. Today I ordered a new dish that I have not tried at this Vietnamese restaurant. The lemongrass Chicken + broccoli was marvelous. The chicken was very tender and although a bit greasy, this dish very accurately represents the lemongrass chicken at most Vietnamese restaurants. My dining companion had chicken stir fry and was pleased.    I also like the chicken vermicelli bowl. However I do not like that the lettuce is on the bottom under the hot noodles. I also feel like when I order no bean sprouts, I get more noodles and not more lettuce.  It's too much noodle,  and the balance is off.    Flavors are amazing always.  Price and portion is excellent.   Thanks for providing great value!"}
{"text":"I have been here several times and it is becoming my favorite place for Pho and their Spring Rolls. I order the Combination Beef Pho and pay extra for extra meat. The broth is very flavorful and probably the best I have had in over a dozen places. Yes, the place is not fancy - I like to think that they put 100% of their passion and effort into making the best food and decorating. Give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Ok, I agree with other users that this isn't the absolute \"best\" pho that I've ever had, but in Phoenix-- especially for just $6.99-- it is hard to beat.  I have a couple favs around Phoenix if I need a Pho fix, but this one definitely is up there. The owners are super sweet, friendly, & fast-- we all know good service is always a plus.  As far as the menu, I always stick to #6 the ribeye pho & also grab an order of spring rolls. You get a good amount of food for how little you pay, & theres no question about authenticity.  Oh, did I mention I've never seen a wait? That also keeps me coming back as well as it being around the corner from my place."}
{"text":"Well, on first impressions, it was alright. It was a tad bit warm in the restaurant, but I find that to be the norm in Asians restaurants (trying to save money and all). I ordered the pho dac biet, and it was lacking all the delicious meats that come in it. I had rare meat and the bo vien. That is NOT Dac Biet. My husband had the pho tai, and my son had the pho bo vien. There's didn't seem to be missing much, but the pho was served with a side of cilantro, no basil. Um what?! Maybe to the more Americanized crowd that's acceptable, but I made it a point to even let her know I was Vietnamese so she knew not to americanize the bowls. It's common practice here in Arizona because we don't have a large Vietnamese population, they save a few bucks by not using items that a more seasoned Vietnamese eater would notice. The broth tasted flavorful, and hearty. But the dreaded MSG aftertaste came and didn't dissipate for nearly an hour after. What a bummer. I was excited to possibly have found a new pho place to remind me of home."}
{"text":"Although this place didn't look like much from the appearance. Such as plain white walls, simple atmosphere, the food was very good. I bet if this place had some cosmetic enhancements and updated a few things they would be busy all the time. The egg rolls and beef soup was awesome!!! I was skeptical at first from appearance but it was a rest place to eat!"}
{"text":"Delicious pho tai! A secret gem tucked away in a little strip mall. Definitely not a place to go for the atmosphere but for amazing Vietnamese food."}
{"text":"This place is pretty remarkable. Granted, we were a little throw off by the interior but boy do they make up for it with authentic, delicious pho. The owners are extremely friendly and welcoming, language barrier and all. We loved the spring rolls and look forward to frequenting this great spot.  Give it a try, you wont regret it!"}
{"text":"Get the pho! The chicken in the pho is white meat and not dry like some pho places in the valley. It's a hidden gem. We ordered the spring rolls and pho all around and were not disappointed! This has taken over as my new favorite spot to get pho in Phoenix.  Only drawback is that the service was soo slow. I mean slow. We waited nearly 40 minutes to order our food. But we were in good company and the food was delicious, so despite that fact, I will be back!"}
{"text":"Let me start out by saying we don't eat Pho very often.. But I think we will now! This place was very yummy. The language barrier made it a little hard to order because we only eat shrimp and didn't want beef broth so asking questions was a little difficult. When the food came though, it was delicious! The spring rolls with peanut sauce were fresh and delicious. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Great food and the staff is fun to chat with.  Keep up the good work!  It's worth the drive for this hidden gem.  I had a special made roll which they offered without a problem.  It's the best Pho in the North Valley and the rice is incredible.  Give them a try and you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place, the seafood pho is delicious & they know my order when I walk in. They're always very pleasant, I come at least once a week. Great prices as well!"}
{"text":"Very tasty!  Just in Phoenix for a few days and tried this out. Great broth, fresh, good size portion, and affordable. The lady serving us was so sweet. Hope to be back sometime!  Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I don't know why this place has such good reviews! I, myself am Asian, and know what good pho should taste like. This is by far the worst pho I've had in the Phoenix Metro. I've tried many!"}
{"text":"Great little spot for lovers of pho. Modest. Comfortable. On this visit we deviated from having just pho, which is a difficult decision since the pho here is so good. We ordered two shrimp with rice dishes to accommodate the tastes of two youngsters in our party. It was totally unnecessary. The young ones loved all three varieties of pho we ordered. Playing with noodles is just too much fun. But they also loved the grilled shrimp and rice. To complete the evening, the servers were very sweet and generous in presenting the kids with fortune cookies. A great time all around."}
{"text":"The food lacked that something extra or to be blunt maybe it just lacked flavor all together. The spring rolls is definitely something to skip all together, which is a shame as I love spring rolls. The main dish had the same issue. The boba smoothie was not bad just a tad too sweet but not terrible."}
{"text":"This was my first experience eating pho and I could not have been happier. The food was fresh, the service was fast, and the staff were extremely friendly. I recommend the #10. A regular sized bowl will satisfy any appetite. The spring rolls were also very good."}
{"text":"I was looking for a comeback meal after being sick for multiple days with no appetite and I thought hmm, Pho is always a good choice! My mom was like, I have a co-worker who RAVES about the Pho place on 32nd and Greenway. So I looked it up and my mom's co-worker was right.   It's very divey, hole-in-the-wall kind of place...but those are usually the best right? Right. The staff was very cute and friendly and had my Pho out in no time. The broth was everything I hoped it would be and was easy on my stomach. It was so flavorful without being overpowering. Not to mention the prices are extremely reasonable. I ordered the #10 and one serving is definitely enough for two meals! I love when that happens.   This will definitely become my go-to Pho and Vietnamese spot. I can't wait to try more dishes now that I'm feeling better!!"}
{"text":"A very nice couple was working. No, they don't speak much English but you can tell they are learning. Plus the food was very authentic and the menu was varied. It's not in a pretty spot but it's clean. I couldn't find the hours or phone number so I just posted a pic with the back of their menu with that info."}
{"text":"Is it a dive? Yes. Is it the best I've ever had? No. But it's close to home, it's cheap, and if you venture out of the norm, it's pretty damn good. I am in love with the soft/fried egg noodle shrimp (#19) I've had it done both soft and fried and they were both absolutely stellar. The flavor in the sauce, the crunch of the veggies, and the added black pepper on top just make this dish so much more than any bowl of Pho for me."}
{"text":"The lady who works here can hardly speak any English but she doesn't need to because of how delicious the Pho Tai is. I always stick with the Pho Tai, egg rolls, and spring rolls. I wish they had the dish that has fried eggs on top but I can't complain this place is delicious."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were in the area and we yelp for Vietnamese food. This is around noon and the place was empty ( this should have been a good indication) but we wants to try it, its our first time. We ordered pho and fried rice to share. When we got the pho we asked if they had put tendon, she said she had ONE and she fished for it to show us. They also put a little noodle, one meatball, a few slice meat. On the fried rice, there was a few slices of meat, ONE big shrimp and soy sauce. My friend and I was laughing when she fished for the tendon to show us. I guess, we will not go back and will NOT recommend Pho AV  to any of our friends. They are also pricey for what they give you. Pho was okay. I had better ones"}
{"text":"Good food. Except they seem to change their prices depending on.. well, who knows. No itemized receipts. Just a calculator which is used out of customers sight. Won't be eating here again."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the lackluster atmosphere and super sketch strip mall - this place is legit. Some of the best pho I have ever had."}
{"text":"Quiet little spot. Delicious. I've only had their Phô, but my daughter enjoys their Beef and Broccoli. And of the only two places we go to and really enjoy is this property and the one right next to us off 19th.ave. & Thunderbird(NW corner)...turns out they own both places, ran by the same family. What a small and delicious world"}
{"text":"This might not be a fair review but I did not like this place. I went with the family and ordered some Pho for everyone. To be honest, I don't really know how to eat it but this place had great reviews. The hostess/waitress wasn't the friendliest or most prompt. Had to ask to get plates cleared and had to get up to get my water refilled, once again, not sure if this is how its supposed to go here since she literally said about 8 words to us since we walked in.   The food was good, but probably could have been better with some advice from a nice waiter and some table talk. I will probably eat Pho again, but at a more formal restraunt, don't think I will make my way back into Pho A.V."}
{"text":"This place was amazing. Portions were very generous and the lemongrass entree is on point. Since I'm a vegetarian I was very thankful that they had vegetable broth for their pho!   Prices were so good! $7.99 got you almost anything! Oh and they have my wife's Favorite Vietnamese dish. Vietnamiese pancakes"}
{"text":"Pho AV is a great mom-and-pop, hole-in-the-wall Pho joint, hidden away in a strip mall. We visited on a rainy day and apparently that meant they were out of basically everything except pho and salad rolls. I tasted a beef pho and seafood pho, both of which were delicious and generously portioned. I've had better salad rolls, but for the low prices here, I really can't complain. I would definitely come back for another quick meal of Pho - and hopefully to try the banh xeo or some rice dishes when they aren't out."}
{"text":"Love this place! I come here almost weekly for a year now. I always get the spring rolls and rare beef pho. The spring rolls are the best I've ever had. They recently updated the tables and benches so it is much more comfortable now. The place is clean, service is fast, and prices are great. This place never disappoints!"}
{"text":"This is definitely a \"hole in the wall\" kind of restaurant, which in my opinion makes it even more attractive. Service is attentive, fast, and the food is fantastic! I'll definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Wanted some wonton soup,my usual place across the street was closed for remodeling so I stopped by here. They took a while to greet me and give me the menu mind you it was not very busy. I ordered spring rolls, at which I was very unimpressed they were warn, the peanut sauce was so watered down, they put a ton of mint. By this time my soup arrived smaller than other places, the noodles were hard. The flavor was  ok I guess. Needless to say, it was a good adventure  but I will not be back. Their prices are higher than across the street. I paid here for the soup what I usually pay at other place inside Lee Lees what I pay for soup, extra noodle and spring rolls. Unimpressed about that too!! And not to mention how on how I lost count on the excuse me that I heard form people dining, getting the waiters attention. The place is plenty big but it's hot and humid inside, I is not enjoy sweating while enjoying my food."}
{"text":"Good food. Not a great dine-in place. Food is fresh and tasty, not greasy nor heavy."}
{"text":"This place needs to STAY!!   Absolutely the best Vietnamese in the valley. I have only had one better Bun, and that was in San Fransisco (which makes sense as there is a huge Asian population there).   We have been there twice and both times the food was delicious. Different flavors, but shouldn't be scary for the 'American' palate. Both times we had the #16 Bun w pork. And the #20 Soft egg noodle w veges and beef. And the wonderful spring rolls.   As the other reviews have noted, not much atmosphere ( I may take my iPod speakers next time). The server is extremely friendly and helpful. When we had dinner there the last time, I had mixed my pork and veges and noodles as your supposed to do, But she stopped by and put the rest of my sauce (kind of a light dressing) on my food and motioned to mix it more. I bet she wanted to help me and do it herself. Very cute."}
{"text":"Small restaurant with only about a dozen tables. Pho had good flavored hot broth which is always sign of a good restaurant. Also the herbs and bean sprouts were clean and fresh. However, it went downhill from there. The pho was missing tendons which is one of my favorite ingredient in the combo pho. The other meat were hard, chewy and dry. The chicken with lemon grass had very small amount of chicken and mostly crumbs of what looks like lemon grass and ginger. The crepe wasn't too memorable either. The taro boba had hard boba with texture of hardened clay. What's funny was that when she was making our boba drink, the loud noise from the blender just about gave us a heart attack."}
{"text":"Great little spot for Vietnamese food. Love the Bun, Vermicelli and the Pho. Especially good for Arizona which is lacking really good Vietnamese food. All the food is freshly prepared with fresh ingredients and made to order. I have the special mixed vermicelli which came with shrimp, a shrimp ball, grilled pork and pork sausage. It was excellent. Also had the ground pork egg rolls which were cooked to order and very hot  and crispy. They also have all the sauces that usually come with this style of food. Large portion sizes at a very reasonable price. Will definitely be coming back for more."}
{"text":"This is so delicious!  I love the egg rolls wrapped with the fresh basil, cilantro, and lettuce. The fresh veggies/herbs with the crunch is one of the best things I've eaten. The pho is wonderful. Huge portions. Reasonable prices. I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Authentic is the word that comes to mind. Bring your patience, English is not their first language. The Pho soups are out of this world. Shrimp rolls are great for dieters. Go early. Once the place is full the turn over the closed sign so they can get caught up. The still take take outs though."}
{"text":"Went there to get some food to go.. ordered the large size, left a nice 20% tip.. when I got home the soup and meat was in a drink cup.. how the hell are you supposed to eat good out of a drink cup.. I'll never go back and I don't recommend this place at all... I ordered a large and there was 8 pieces of meat in there. Never go there at least not to get anything to go"}
{"text":"The food was very good.  I was the only customer the evening I went.  I planned on picking up and returning to my hotel room. (I was in the area on business).  My only complaint was that it was a sauna when I walked in.  The air was stagnant and not moving.  It had been a hot day so it was disappointing to walk in from dry heat into stagnant heat.  On the upside, the food aromas, stuck because of the heat, were very yummy smelling.  I'd visit it again if I happened to be in the area and it was a cooler day."}
{"text":"I adore this place!   The Bun, Pho, Boba Smoothies and the Crepe are all delicious. I would add more to the list but that's all I've tried.   The staff are so sweet!"}
{"text":"It's been a few years since my last review and since then I have given this place reluctantly two more tries because of the fact it is so close to my house. Again the service is very friendly but the food is so terrible. I am so unsure how people are giving this place more than one or two stars as the food is lacking in taste. The food is very old and reheated in the quality of the meat is not good."}
{"text":"Plain restaurant with simple tables and bench seats.  We walked up at 830 pm on a Saturday night and the signed said closed but the hours said 930.  It was busy when we walked in with most of the tables were filled.  We looked over the other yelp reviews and ordered the #6 rare beef and #8 combination  pho. We wanted the spring rolls but they were out and the waitress / owner was very nice and said we will have some tomorrow.  Both #6 and #8 were pretty good and from another person, they recommend to ask for additional meat at a small cost.  Don't go here for the atmosphere or ambiance, but go here for the food. There are not to many places in Scottsdale, North Phoenix for Pho so this one is not bad rather than drive 30 minutes.   Will come back again especially on a cold day, Pho is always great to warm up the body."}
{"text":"Looking at this place on the surface made me a little hesitant. Once I got past the very \"hole in the wall\" appearance, I was nothing but impressed.  The food is amazing. The portions are huge. The prices are dirt cheap. The staff was very friendly and attentive. It's nothing fancy, but if you just want some great Vietnamese food at a low key place, this is winner.  Very glad we took a chance on this place, still We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Solid Vietnamese food here.  I just moved to the neighborhood and will definitely be frequenting this place.  I ordered the crepe, an order of beef pho and a mango smoothie with boba.  I had the crepe for dinner last night with the smoothie and saved the pho for lunch today.  I'm fighting a cold so I thought it would be perfect.  The broth is aromatic and delicious, the herbs are super fresh.  Can't wait for the next visit...."}
