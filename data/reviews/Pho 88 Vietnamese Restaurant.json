{"text":"Taste:
The only other place I've had worse pho was at the eaton centre food court. Broth was watered down, no cilantro & minimal onions & meat. Oily too! 

Cleanliness:
Was seated at a table that was \"wiped\"... With exception to the leftover remnants of food on the table. The food comes out on lunch trays which is fine if they weren't filled with spilled over pho from the last 100+ bowls served (I have ever seen any other pho place so dirty). 

Service:
They need more servers/just better wages/a ray of sunshine because no one seems happy or even receptive enough to come our table when we waved them down (after waiting 15 mins to order & more for the check- I just went up to pay).

Bottom line: go to pho vietnam up the street. Too bad they close earlier."}
{"text":"My favorite pho in the city!

So far...

UPDATE: A big fall from grace... 
I've been so disappointed with this place lately. I don't know what happened. The quality has really declined. The last time we went this past week was particularly awful. I found a piece of plastic in my pho and kai lan was wilted with very little green tops. I'm going to have to find a new place to get my pho-fix  :("}
{"text":"Pho 88 on Bamburgh Circle is quite terrible and I regret to admit that I have been a fairly regular patron of this restuarant, mostly because it was convenient. The service, food, ambience and cleanliness of this place is rather lacking. It has always been mediocre at best but a recent visit really solidified my negative opinion of this restaurant. We arrived around 7:00PM on a Saturday and it was packed, which is normal for this place. We didn't have to wait to be seated but with how tight the tables were placed in this restaurant, we ended up sitting right beside other patrons. My friend and I each ordered our usual, which was the XL rare beef pho with well done flank, tendon and tripe (#101). Each bowl costed $9.10. The food took a bit longer than usual to arrive but it was still fast. I usually ask for another bowl to mix my sauces and after asking four different servers, in multiple languages, I finally got it at the tail end of finishing my meal. As a result, I did not enjoy my meal as much as I could have and it was rather painful to have to keep harassing servers for \"service\". By the end of the meal, we just wanted to get out of there, especially since someone sitting nearby was talking so loud, you could not even hear yourself talk. It should also be noted that the ventilation in this restaurant is rather poor since you always come out smelling like pho, even if you are only there for a short while so that was another reason to leave quickly. So, we again flagged multiple servers for our bill and after waiting longer than one should have to wait in order to pay, I got up myself to go to the counter. The lady at the front was ridiculously rude, pointing out that she did not know where I sat so she could not give me my bill. I pointed out that I was near the front and that I had already asked for my bill multiple times to no avail. It also did not help that there was no number/marker to indicate what table I was at. A server who was working near the front passed by so I asked her if she could hand me my bill but she feigned absolute ignorance and proceeded to talk to the lady behind the counter in Vietnamese, in what I can only assume was smack talk about me. After explaining what my order was, I managed to get what I assume was the right bill. I purposely gave zero tip because tip is a privilege, not a right. You have to earn it in my books or at least not piss me off. She noticed that I gave no tip and made some pathetic plea about giving the servers a tip. I responded that I was given terrible service, which naturally explains my non-existent tip. This last comment was the final straw. It is one thing to provide garbage service but it is another to act entitled. I left unsatisfied, upset and annoyed and I will never be returning again. With all the pho options around, I have already gave them more business than they ever deserved."}
{"text":"Like the other said, this place used to be better! Now not only there's a price increase, which is understandable considering the increase of raw food cost, they also cheap out a lot on the ingredients. The shrimp rolls we ordered doesn't even taste fresh, it tastes like it has been kept in the fridge for a long time. Disappointed..."}
{"text":"After my frequent grocery runs at foody mart I like to visit here for a delicious bowl of pho. I always get the rare beef tendon and tripe pho, it's my favourite and has been equally as delicious every time. The service is abrupt but quick, they have yet to get my order wrong in the 10+ visits. It is not a place for a fancy meal but rather something warm, simple and delicious. Bowls come in 3 sizes for their pho and all are very generous, if you're interested in other Vietnamese cuisine there's also another large variety to pick from. Overall I would completely recommend this place for anyone craving Vietnamese food!"}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE! This is our go to stop before leaving Toronto and when we get back from vacation, business trip or when you're having one of those horrible days. Noodle soup comfort. A family run shop with a lot of heart...the waiters do not count because this family runs a tight....There's a reason why this place always has a line up and it's always worth the wait."}
{"text":"This place has not changed since I last came here over 10 years ago! Pho lunches/dinners were highly anticipated during high school days.

It did not disappointment! The grilled pork vermicelli noodle bowl was welcome comfort food on a cold winter night. The deep fried spring rolls are delicious as always.

A sure bet for good Viet food. Keep in mind, the service and decor are not the selling points of this place."}
{"text":"Great place to have time with your friends , order their spring rolls and my favorite rare beef & tendon . Most of the time pack with late nite ppl.."}
{"text":"We went to this place first time last week. We usually go to pho 88 in north York on donmills Rd. We thought it's another branch of theirs. Ordered beef pho and spring roll. It's was not as tasty as north York place. On top three of us had diarrhea after eating their food for three days. They use lots of msg too because we kept drinking water after having pho. We will never go back again. They also provide service without smile. I asked for extra empty bowl for my kid and waiters made angry faces as if I asked too much from them."}
{"text":"Used to love this place. Having visited this place recently, my love is gone. Noodles tasted stale, and had a strange taste to it. Maybe it is not fresh, i dont know. Ok, but wouldnt be running out just to eat here."}
{"text":"From the moment we were seated to the moment we got the bill, the service was quick. So quick that I constantly felt rushed to complete our order, to finish eating, and to pay the bill. It felt like we were ordering from a fast food restaurant and eating inside a very loud food court.

Whenever I visit a pho restaurant for the first time, I order a bowl of rare beef pho -- plain and simple. We also tried the satay beef pho and spicy peanut and coconut pho with beef. 

First came the raw beansprouts, which were brown and far from fresh. It was not appetizing at all.  Then came the rare beef pho, which was even more disappointing because the beef was the total opposite of rare! If I wanted overcooked beef, I would've ordered well-done flank...  As another Yelper mentioned, the satay beef pho soup was pretty much their beef broth with chili oil and nothing else = nothing special.  To top it all off, the spicy peanut and coconut soup was so thick, it was more like a sauce in which you would cook meat or use as a dip. It did not pair well with the pho. 

I don't mean to sound like a pho snob, but coming from Mississauga, we have visited many pho restaurants. To charge $7 for a small bowl of overcooked beef pho, we were not impressed."}
{"text":"The service was terrible.  I got a take out from here. When I asked for hot sauce the cashier pretended she didn't hear me. When I asked a few times, she finally said she would have to charge me for the hot sauce rudely. Never going back."}
{"text":"I've been going here for years. The best veggie Tofu Pho in the city, and I have looked everywhere. 
Confirmed a bunch of times that the broth for the Tofu soup is veggie and doesn't have any beef/chicken in it.
Fast service always"}

-tasty broth
-big servings noodles and meat
- great place to have a quick cheap and tasty meal
- also there avocado shake is fantastic

no place like it"}
{"text":"My childhood favorite place to have a bowl of pho! My mom got off work late so decided to grab a quick bite to eat with her. My rating will be according to service, atmosphere and food. 

Service 1/5: i do not come here for service, but still just a little bit of it would be nice! We were sat at a dirty table which then they moved us to a different table. Within 1 min she came back and asked to take the order sheet away (literally just opened the menu). She was definitely moving at a very fast pace. When we asked for a take out container for the pork chop rice and for a new fish sauce, she came back with a small container that won't fit the pork chop and also a sauce container for the sauce that i previously just used. I dont know you but i double dip my own sauce and it is not goo to keep after that. Anyways service was beyond terrible. I feel giving the a 1 star is generous.

Atmosphere 1.5/5: the place was dirty and even the clean tables were dirty. Did not do any renos for years so the place still looks old. They still had a clock hung on the wall that had a date on it of Nov 1 (i wonder what year hahaha). Just a quick drop in and a quick meal! If you don't mind a little dirty here and there and want a quick meal this place is good.

Food 3/5: the food i have to say is still pretty good. We got the special beef noodle and the pork chop rice. The noodle came with a lot of noodle and beef which was too much for my mom to finish. I had the pork chop rice which came with 2 slices of pork chop and a generous amount of rice. The pork chop was always one of my favourites and it still tasted pretty alright. 

Overall the food is good not great. This is great for people that want quick food and don't mind the bad service and cleaneness of the place. All in all a solid 2 i guess."}
{"text":"Pretty great pho for the price. Meat was just a little tough when I went, but that doesn't mean I wont be coming back. Always packed with people."}
{"text":"This is not the place to bring the gf or wife for a romantic dinner, but if you want a quick ,midday beef noodle in broth, I don't know a place in all of north America that has better Pho.

It's always packed and the ambience is like a packed TTC subway at rush hour.  Shared tables are a must if you're in a small grouper alone.

But for a quick lunch, this place has the best authentic Vietnamese Pho. There's only one other chain that serves better beef noodle in broth, but that is a thai restaurant in san Francisco.  

I always go for the special beef noodle."}
{"text":"I love vietnamese food and by far this is one of the best. Pho has lots of meat, unlike other places.  Food taste good. Hard to find a table on a weekend. Wheew!!! This one is a keeper and will be coming back."}
{"text":"special noodles in soup is great. but overall feeling the restaurant is not clean and services are not good"}
{"text":"Probably the best pho in town, you smell pho right when you walk in, taste amazing and great prices !"}
{"text":"Wish I was more excited to be reviewing a spot I was anxious to know the hype behind and ever since yelping, would the first place I review right after dining at tonight...

I've lived on the Bamburgh circle for the passed year wondering why every time I walk by Pho 88 it was ALWAYS jammed packed of people. Has it been here forever? Do they have a regular clientele, or do people just come in because it is the most crowded restaurant in the plaza?? I still don't know why people flow in constantly because the food is ordinary, the atmosphere and decor like a cafeteria, the service ok and the prices are pretty much the same for several dozens of similar restaurants in an 800m radius block, which are all fairly reasonable but not dirt cheap. 

My friend and I didn't finish the vermicilli entrees we ordered, in my case the noodles were served too cold compared to the meat and spring roll. On a positive note, the pho portions are applaudable. Now that's a real Large wong tong soup one can appreciate and share with three people; thank you, that makes me happy!"}
{"text":"Best pho in the GTA! I live literally across the street from Pho88 and I often dine here. Their prices are reasonable, their service is extremely fast and their pho is just amazing. Best Pho I ever had by far!"}
{"text":"this place is good food fast in large quantity. No one i have brought here has anything to complain about.

I almost always get the xl special beef. I like it and you should too!!
a friend of mine always gets some spicy peanut/coconut thing that is really good too. 
served piping hot. super hot. usually with some rare beef poking out the top (if you don't like it this way just tell them no rare meat and they will make sure its the way you want)

i dunno how you could want an appetizer with this amount of food - but the vietnamese spring rolls are satisfying in size and flavor. crispy on outside made with rice papery goodness.

do not confuse this with the more posh pho 88 chain.

this is not a posh place - but the service is fast. at their busiest i have waited 5 minutes for a table. one time. yes ONCE. all the other times I was seated immediately. (when you walk in a person may yell at you from the other side of the room asking for number of people in your party and then point at a table - I am used to this and don't think its rude - it just gets everything done faster)

go here. bring appetite. leave happy and full and ready for long nap :)"}
{"text":"This is my usual go to spot for pho for years. And now I've had the last straw when it comes to their food and service. The fact that I actually had to create an account just to express my feelings towards this place is horrible. A few years back this was a pretty and nice stop for pho. (Especially the value) Unfortunately, the quality of their food has slowly declined throughout the years. They are not consistent with the amount of food they give you and as well they are clearly using simple Asian tactics of cutting every corner possible to still in a well profitable margin. The reason I'm saying this is because during one of my prior visits I ordered the same bowl as what it seems a constant returning customer (the way they connected to the owner) ordered. The customer bowl of noodle was just stacked. Again that was fine since I would understand to keep your returning customers happier.

But, on my last visit to this joint. Everything was normal as you'd expect from this place, fast service, loud environment and constant customers going in and out. Everything was good up until the point where I was paying my bill. I was paying upfront and the boss of the place tells me the total. I put down the cash for her and she just stares at me. So, I just stood there and stared at her. Then she says no tip for them? This is where it struck me when she said that. The amount I put down was enough to cover my meal plus 13% tip. This wasn't the first time that it has occurred to me when they just stared when paying for the bill. Prior occasions I'd leave 15-20% cause the value of the meal are relatively inexpensive. I was tipping higher not because of their service, but because of the laziness of collecting my change back. (They were all coins) This place tends to take advantage of the younger crowd when it comes to tipping from what I noticed. I occasionally use the debit machine to make my payments and the options of 12% is there. Why have 12% on the machine if you guys expect more. Again, the general rule of thumb to older Asian folks was to pay 10% tip and they get by fine when paying. But, I was put on the spot and accused of \"not tipping them\" when my amount of fully covers the meal and the tip. Since when was tipping mandatory to begin with that you'd have to remind the customer in that tone of voice.

This is probably the last time I'll step foot into this joint. There are alternatives around the area like Vietnamese Noodle Star which i'd recommend for quality and as well value."}
{"text":"Been coming here for well over 10 years, ever since I was a teenager. It's the only Pho 88 which I like to come to even though the other ones look much nicer than this food court looking one. The soup just tastes different from the other 88's, it must be the pots their using in the back. Just like when you make a traditional cassoulet you never wash the pot so you can transfer the flavours to the next batch. I bet they do that here! j/k The soup base is always consistent, full of wonderful aromas. I can only comment on the pho noodles since that's all I ever order when I come here. One of the best places for pho in Toronto (Pho Mi Asia in Mississauga is number one for me)."}
{"text":"This is perhaps one of the best Pho in Toronto. Their pho broth is very fragrant (you can smell the spices) and packed with flavour. Pair your pho with a side of their spring rolls too! Lastly, the customer service is okay I suppose (hence the four stars, instead of 5), but personally, the food definitely makes up for that."}
{"text":"Dirty restaurant, dirty floor, dirty tea cups.  service is horrible, i asked them to replace something in my dish and they in turned added a four dollar surcharge.  Guess the pho88 dynasty is no more.  Much better pho places nearby."}
{"text":"I used to go to this place since their pho is quite good other than restarant even if the service is poor like other people mention. A few days ago, I ordered beef pho I ususally enjoyed. While I was having this, I found iron piece look like out of scrubber. So, I called the person in the counter ( I think she is owner )and showed that dirty thing. Well, she just say sorry and that's it. She asked me another one. I said no and just cancel it. They look it is not a big problem. I paid one for my girlfriend that she didn't eat at all. Until then, she did not any explanation about it.

Please don't go to this place if you want nice food and customer service.

I swear I will not go to this place."}
{"text":"the food was good but would not return as the customer service was terrible and the place was quite messy and loud"}
{"text":"I love the food here, lots of vegetarian options and they will customize the order to take meat out and replace it with other substitutes of your choice.

The decor is alright and the seats are comfortable, service is alright and serving sizes are massive. You might be close to other guests, but this is a small sized restaurant, just like other ones that are around it, it doesn't seem to bother me.

I've been here about 3 times so far and i've been satisfied with the food and service.

If you like this Vietnamese food I would highly recommend that you stop by here and give it a try."}
{"text":"My go to Pho restaurant in Scarbs. Always hospitable. Always busy during dinner so I go for late eats. They close relatively late so whic helps for late cravings."}
{"text":"Small crowded place. Very busy and my goto place for Pho near Markham. Seating is cramped unless you're lucky to get the side tables for more \"privacy\".  Food is ok for soup and slightly better if you order bbq with rice.  Portions are average.  Soup have lots of flavor but lack ingredients... Very skimpy.  Pho use to be a good deal but prices have really shot up.  It's just soup so paying more $9 for me is too much.  Go for the premium items such as grilled meat with rice or vermicelli along with other sides.  Best part for me is the spring roll."}
{"text":"I cannot warn customers enough to check your bill and ask questions. ROBBERS. both women who run the this business are ridiculous with robbing. write your price on your bill. thieves"}
{"text":"Tried buying the recipe cuz we love it so much but no price was right! Understandable though, the man runs a great business on the foundation of this family recipe from Nam, and that's why people flock and fill his lil Bamburgh resto as long they they are open, whether it be brunch or lunch or 1am.

I've had pho in 6 countries and for the past 15 years this has been THE spot, with only comparable ratings back in the actual pho origin.

Broth - 5!
Noodles - 5
Meat - 5
Speed - 5
Fresh & hotness - 5

Down 1star for the amount of MSG though."}

 Always
#270 XL

So good but I have to deduct 1 for the cut eye stares and rudeness of one of the waitresses. She doesn't even give me a menu when I come lol. 
I don't know if it's me or she just doesn't have many good days at work. I have tried a few other things here and it's been all enjoyable. Someone needs to steal me the #270 recipe. 
Negotiating recipe trade for cash lol"}
{"text":"The place is a bit of a dive (not an impressive first date location) but the food is good. I always get #270 as mentioned by other Yelpers, one of their \"Specials\", it has a peanut/coconut broth and I don't think it's available at other locations. Although they share the same name I don't think this place has the same menu as the other Pho 88 locations and may be a separate entity entirely.

Overall, bad decor, mediocre service, but good food and open late! Note also that it's pretty busy around dinner time so you may have to wait a few minutes, but there's high turnover."}
{"text":"Great food, especially for lunch. Pretty clean and presentable.Service is very efficient and fast, which is a big plus during the busy lunch hours.  The servers literally run up and down ails carrying the big trays lol Def one of my fav pho places"}
{"text":"Came here again after checking out other places and after coming back because my usual to go place was closed, I find that my previous review was in need of a revamp. What I usually order is rare beef and tendon so I noticed that the portions of the beef and tendon isn't as much as my to go place. I noticed that the tendon tends to melt into the broth as you eat which helps with flavouring the broth, but personally for me, I'm not for it. The noodles are quite thin too so that's also a bit of a minus. It's mostly soup so I don't come here unless I've a terrible terrible hankering for pho. 

It's also pretty noisy at times which can be frustrating when you are in group and you're trying to have a conversation. I still think it's okay for a midnight meal if you need it."}
{"text":"Quick and dirty! Consistent and delicious, one of those go-to places for a cheap bite. The service is gruff, the floors are oily but I go there for the food!"}
{"text":"Service is fast but not very friendly. And it's happened several times where they didn't give me my change back assuming it's their tip. I shouldn't have to ask for my change. 

It's also not very clean to me. Tip: Do not use the washroom unless its absolutely necessary. 

For some odd reason, despite all my issues with this place, from time to time, I somehow end up coming here because of their fresh spring rolls. It's amazing, And at that point, I give in and order their pho as well. I find their fresh spring rolls is the best compared to other pho restaurants. Give it a try."}
{"text":"One of my favourite Pho restaurants. Not just for pho, but in general, Vietnamese food! =)  Love their spring rolls, pho, and their vermicelli.  Place is always busy and always have tables of customers whenever i walk in - even at 1am!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite Pho restaurants in Toronto! The spring rolls (Fresh BBQ Chicken and Deep-Fried) are really good. The Pho broth is not too salty and they give a good portion of noodles. Although the raw beef is a little tough and dry sometimes. If you don't like that, then I would advise to get the beef flank or beef balls instead. I usually get #116 (raw beef and tripe) and a milkshake. I really recommend their milkshakes, they use real fruits instead of powder. I've tried their mango, taro, avocado and durian flavours so far. For those that are more adventurous, durian milkshake is actually really yummy. Otherwise, the avocado or mango would be worth the try. The owners are friendly and makes you feel welcomed. Staff are usually less friendly and in a hurry to take orders and serve the food. However, the food is served very quickly, usually within 5-10 minutes of ordering."}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite place to get pho until recently when my last visit there with my young son left a bitter taste in my mouth and I can't bring myself to go there ever again after the way we were treated.
My son was 3 at the time and loved pho! We would eat pho almost every week. One cold winter's day my son and I went to eat pho here. During the middle of our lunch my son (who was 3) needed to use the bathroom. Without hesitation I grabbed him and my purse and went to the back to use the facilities. Of course we left our food on the table...we took only about 3 minutes at the most since it was only my son who had to use the bathroom. When we got back to our table, one of the waitresses was there cleaning up our food!! She saw us return to our table, but it was already too late! Our food was cleared away! And my son's toy was thrown away as well! I asked the waitress why she was clearing our food away...we're still here!! We were just in the washroom!! She told us she thought we just took off!! Really??? Our winter coats were still hanging on the chair and she thought I'd take my 3 year old son outside in the winter without his coat????? The manager asked what the problem was and I told him and he said we should have informed someone we were going to the bathroom because they thought we just walked out on the bill. My son was upset because his pho and his toy was gone. The manager didn't offer to look for it or even replace our order!!! I had to ask!!! And they had the nerve to charge us still!!!!  I was very upset by this because it was idiotic of them to think we left even though our winter coats were still on the chairs!!! Stupid!!!!"}
{"text":"Good food for a great price! Great place for a meal with friends. It's pretty noisy but in a good way. It's a good go-to place if you are in the area. My friends like the Pho but I usually get something from the Thai section."}
{"text":"Best pho I've had, owners are really nice. Too bad we moved into the west end of Toronto so we don't go there as much. Worth the drive though."}
{"text":"They have specialty pho. 
Peanut coconut pho ! And that's the only reason I come here. I don't go anywhere else !!!! The broth is creamy and smooth taste of peanuts coconut. It's absolutely delicious"}
{"text":"One of the best pho places I've been to. I got the rare beef and tendon noodle soup (Large) and my friend got the goat curry. Very busy but the pho is so worth it. Even when they are busy, the service was stil great. The goat was tender but the rare beef in the pho was very thin this time and was in very small pieces. It's not like that all the time but it only happened this time. I still love this place and would always come back if I had the chance."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time.  The place was about half full, so it was a pretty good sign for me.  I was going to order bun mang vit, but i wanted to try their pho first. So.  When the waitress brought the bowl of pho out, my sight and smell of the bowl of soup immediately sent me some messages to my brain.  I smelled a familiar strong aroma that was one of the dry ingredients used to my the soup base.  I don't know what it was, but they used to much of it.  Secondly, the broth didn't look like the usual broth i used to see - very light colored.  Sure enough, the soup was not the beef soup it should be.  It just lack the sweet beef flavor that makes a pho.  In addition, they didn't give gno gai - just bean sprout and basil. Vietnamese food is suppose to have lots of veggies, which makes it tastes very good.  i guess it is the norm now in the area? well, all in all, i was a bit disappointed with my meal."}
{"text":"Yes, its Chinese run, but one of the best pho spots in the Scaborough/Markham area. Don't go to other Pho 88's."}
{"text":"I wouldn't go here again.  I had the grilled chicken bun which is was served on rice noodle.  Didn't care for their chicken recipe.  I didn't like the noodles they used which was thicker than the typical vermicelli they use for this dish.  And I didn't like their spring roll.  I did like the sour sop shake that I got though.  The place is a dive."}
{"text":"First visit back in 2014 was good. The pho was good. The second time I came here was also decent. I remember that the spring rolls were quite good. Starting from 2015, this place started to smell really bad for some reason. Not a place to get a decent service, either. Customer service is embarrassing.

I would give 3 stars to my first visit here back in 2014. Now it's close to a 1 star."}
{"text":"I was really disappointed with the quality of the food here. The tripe in our beef noodle soup was SO chewy I gave up and just picked it all out my bowl. According to the menu, there should have been tendon with our noodles but I couldn't find a single tid bit of tendon in the bowl. The soup itself was okay though, which was a relief. 

We also ordered fresh grilled chicken rolls. It was  rice paper, a few pieces of chicken, literally three pathetic pieces of rice noodles (not even a whole noodle, not even HALF a noodle, I wanted to laugh) and a whole heck lot of lettuce. The fish sauce that came with it to dip the rolls in was overly salty in my moms opinion, I personally just found it too overwhelming with its flavours. It was $4 for 2 rolls. Basically we paid for shredded lettuce. 

The staff were friendly enough but when we asked for a takeout box, the lady I KID YOU NOT tossed the box and bag right on top of the food we wanted to pack home. Maybe she had bad aim? But either way, that was not appreciated. 

On top of the food and service, they were scrubbing the floors or something with bleach during our meal. Luckily, my nose was stuffy so I couldn't smell anything but my mom unfortunately had to sit through the whole meal with bleach fumes and her perfectly good sense of smell. Needless to say, she didn't like it at all. 

All in all, I won't be returning to Pho 88. I could list a few places with better pho, service, and atmosphere."}
{"text":"They have a special menu which has coconut peanut pho broth . 
I love it here .  I have tried their menu and it's clean . They are always packed .  Their Chinese donut is also on point which goes great with the coconut peanut pho. They have it in beef . Shrimp and seafood but arent thag spicy. Their tom yum soup is also one of the best I've tried . I tried their avocado milk shake and it's pretty thick . I recommended this place . They are also open till 1am or longer depending on business which is great for summer nights . Their regular pho is also fresh and taste not too salty or overpowering flavour."}
{"text":"Always my go to pho place when I'm in Scarborough.  It has all the loud atmosphere and old school décor and menu that you would expect, and is the pho that I grew up with.

The servers are quick, efficient, and as friendly as you can get given the lightning quick service.  When I get the #101 everything pho ($8.25), it comes in XL size only.  Cuts of tendon, tripe, brisket, and rare beef overwhelmed the bowl with beefy goodness, and I was dying in meat paradise trying to finish it.

Toppings are par for the course, with the usual suspects like bean sprout, lime, and basil represented, along with chili.  If you're looking for value for money and an authentic experience in Scarborough, this is it."}

{"text":"This is probably my favourite place for Pho in the Markham / Scarborough area. The service is quick although the restaurant gets quite busy at times.

The quality of the food is almost always consistent and the portions are very big. The broth has a nice flavour which isn't overly salty and the noodles are silky with a bit of chewiness. The BBQ Chicken Pho comes with a grilled and seasoned chicken on the side and the House Special Pho comes with a lot of beef, tripe, etc.

The only thing this restaurant is lacking is the environment and cleanliness. The washrooms are dirty and the staff don't provide the best service. This won't bother most people who come for a cheap and quick mea anyways."}
{"text":"If I were 17 years ago again, I wouldn't have noticed the shabby décor. The hole in the wall furniture wouldn't have gotten to me during my meal, and the dull as puck flavours of virtually everything Pho 88 served me would even have passed as acceptable. But I am not 17, I noticed all of those things, and it is unacceptable!

Ernesto & I were let off early from our duties in downtown, so naturally we drove to Scarborough Town Centre to pick up David, then we all headed to Bamburgh Circle for some Japanese food.
We changed our minds upon arrival, and ended up going into Pho 88 Vietnamese Restaurant. I don't think I mentioned this (enough), but I've been to Vietnam, and no parts of that Country looks like whatever that is going on here.
The table wasn't wiped off properly, so I ended up playing waiter and cleaned the table with whatever tissue I can find. 
Ernesto was from Halifax, and he has never been anywhere like this place, or wherever this place was trying to pretend to be. 
David ordered the large bowl of noodle soup with all the fixings, Ernesto ordered the chicken steak, and...I don't remember what I ordered. It was THAT bad. I have NEVER forgotten what I ordered...I think. But I tasted their food, and I was less than impressed. Even the fried spring rolls was below the average I've had. 
I never seen the fried spring roll in Vietnam btw...this could possibly be the Chinese American restaurant equivalent to the chicken-ball which also doesn't exist--and is considered a waste of food. 

Fake bamboo space fillers, fake granite wall..things. Televisions? What for?
I was not offered a single opportunity for eye contact with anyone working here.
I felt slightly embarrassed, but I thought this was not far off from a proper introduction to Scarborough to a domestic foreigner. 


Come to think of it, even a 17 years old me wouldn't even like this place, and a 17 years old me was anything from discriminating (that's a  lie). I rode in Civics, dyed my hair/bangs, drank domestic beer, got drunk in public, wore wife beaters, and considered LUGZ expensive. None of these facts has any relevance to food, I'm just reminiscing.."}
{"text":"Finally got my pho fix after weeks of craving it. It's been years since I've been to this Pho88 and it is still THE best.
We arrived at the Bamburgh plaza around 9pm on a Saturday and to our surprise, there was a ton of open parking spots and the restaurant was only half full. Then we realized that it's the eve of Chinese New Year and most people are celebrating at home.
We had our classics:
- Pho with rare beef and brisket
- Spring rolls
- Squid rolls
- Deep fried tofu
- Grilled pork chop on rice
- Grilled chicken with rice
- Sour sop shake
As usual, the service was fast and with a smile. The food is awesome and cheap. Can't go wrong with this place."}
{"text":"Its a 3.5 (but I rounded to 4) because this is my go to pho place in scarborough! It's good price for the amount they give and it's always as delicious each time. Really hits the spot. However, service isn't amazing but that's as expected. It's a good place to go with friends at any time of day when you're in the area and want a quick and cheap meal (and is craving pho). If I wasn't near I wouldn't especially trek here as it's pretty similar to other pho places."}
{"text":"I'm no pho connoisseur nor do i know what authentic is, I've probably tried maybe 5 other places but as far as this bowl of soup goes, this is up there with the best I've tasted. Along with Pho Dau Bo in Mississauga, this is one of the most satisfying bowls of noodles you can have. Prices are similar to other places at around 5-6$ for a small bowl (and I find small bowl to be a big bowl) and the fried spring rolls are highly addictive. Definitely a place you can visit regularly.  The place is big, parking is adequate, what more can you ask for!"}
{"text":"I remember this place being better, friendlier, cleaner. 

It was 11pm at night and the pho craving kicked in. Not wanting to drive downtown to the 24h pho place, my friends and I settled to come here. I ordered the bun bo hue (bbh) with pho noodles and my friends got the regular pho. I find their bbh to be good in terms of amount of spiciness (IMO) but because all I tasted was the spiciness, I couldn't taste the flavours of lemongrass, herbs, etc. Despite that, I still finished my bowl and most of the soup.

I would only come here if I'm craving pho at such hours."}
{"text":"I've been a patron of this pho for several years - they're very efficient, well priced, and exactly as they advertise.
They have a very large variety of vietnamese food but I mostly come here for their regular beef pho. Their fried spring rolls are also very good. The owner of the store is very friendly and always greets you with a smile. However, do not expect too many smiles from the waiters/waitresses. They're trained to be extremely efficient so they won't spend time to chat with you and can seem indifferent at times but they're just trying to work as fast as they can. They can seem rude if you're not used to this type of service, but don't take it to heart if they seem to be short with you - your food will come out hot and fast, which is great when you're hungry. It's a very popular pho place and has been around as long as I can remember. 
Be prepared to smell completely of beef noodle soup if you eat here - but it's a small price to pay for the great pho."}
{"text":"I love the satay beef noodle soup here. It's the only reason I go. Sadly I ordered take out and they packed the soup in a styrofoam take out container that completely disintegrated when I got home (I live 10 mins away). I was so disappointed and when I called to tell them, she wasn't even surprised. They said you're supposed to tell them not to boil it fully so it doesn't melt the container. Say what?!! Lol. On another occasion (today) I was ordering 2 items, and immediately after I ordered the first one, the lady said okok and hung up on me. I then called back and said I wasn't finished yet with my order. She said 'what do you want then' lol. So I completed my order. My husband picked up the food and said the lady was extremely rude as well. Rest assured we won't be going back here. We only order take out because clearly they use smelly cloths to wipe the tables as it has a really bad odour there. Pho metro (kennedy & 16th), pho com tam (kennedy & steeles), pho padthai (woodbine & apple creek) and pho Quinn (mccowen &7) have way better pho and Are enough for us never to return to Bamburgh. I'm sad to say this was a go to from when We were young and didn't know better."}
{"text":"The pho and deep fried spring rolls are amazing and comes out fast (mainly the former), but the staff is rude as fuck. Seriously."}
{"text":"Hands down...best pho restaurant I have ever been to! I've been going here with my family as one of top three restaurant choices since I was a kid! Must order is their house special pho and their satay beef. For my family of four, one XL, one L, and maybe a lemongrass chicken rice plate are filling enough. Never had to add any hoisin sauce to enhance the broth. Their fried springrolls are average...good batter but sometimes not as crispy as I would like them to be.

It is crowded, loud and not the cleanest...but for the quality of pho, it is definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"I used to come here almost every week since high school (10+ years ago). Once I asked for a little extra onion, the waitress said to charge $2. In grocery stores, a full bag of 5 onions cost only $1.99. When I said that, she replied that labor is expensive. If you see how thin they cut their onions, you will know that they use machine to cut the onions. I was really annoyed that they gave me such bullshit reply even when I've been their loyal customer since 10+ years ago. NEVER COMING BACK!!"}
{"text":"My ultimate comfort food = delicious delicious Vietnamese soup. If you are in the Toronto area, you have to swing by Pho 88. The place is always packed, but their menu items are the real deal. The food is extremely affordable, AND we received our order like 5 minutes after we ordered. 

I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I always come here for pho when I chill with my friends because it's cheap and pretty decent pho. The service is questionable, sometimes it's really attentive, other times the server almost completely ignores you (I suppose it depends on the person and if you come during peak times). Appetizers and drinks are pretty good from what I've tried. Overall, not too shabby, but falls short of being great. I would go back here, just because it's cheap and a popular pho restaurant around the steeles area."}
{"text":"I got the mango milkshake which I really enjoyed. I also tried the lychee milkshake which was quite good. I wasn't very hungry so didn't try the pho, but next time! I did however try the fish legs and although they tasted exactly like chicken at first, they have quite the fish stench and I wasnt the biggest fan."}
{"text":"i called to order takeout one day, and i don't know but something was wrong with their phone, i keep getting disconnected! so finally i got through, and the lady who answered it started to yell at me asking me why i keep calling but don't say a word.  i told her that i didn't even hear anyone saying hello, except for a \"click\" .. bottom line is, customer service needs a lot of work but food is good"}
{"text":"I've only ever had the Pho here (usually the rare beef) and in fact the first Pho restaurant I ever came to. The Pho always comes out fast and delicious and it always has a lot of meat. Just lay in with some hot sauce and hoisin sauce and you're good to go! The soup base here is pretty good: simple, but pleasant.
In terms of negatives, this place has a little bit of the grungy cafeteria feeling going on and although the food is fast and cheap it doesn't really stand out at all versus some of the other noodle options in the area. However, the cheap price, large quantities, and late night hours will probably keep me coming back."}
{"text":"Best pho in town - Hands DOWN!

For all you pho lovers living DT, before you start defending your fav pho places, come and try this out! And they are still in the 416 so you won't have to use any shitty \"venturing out to the 905\" excuses either! 

Although almost all the people I go with always get Pho 88's regular pho offerings, I always get the special coconut spicy pho. I love it. Can't get enough of it! 

You come here for a wicked meal under $10 and not for the ambiance or other stuff. So look past all what this place has and just focus on the food and you will leave extremely satisfied and having received your money's worth and some!

I don't think there is a better pho joint offering better value for your money in the GTA. Period."}
{"text":"Well for starters you can get a giant bowl of XL pho from this place for about $10, I mean giant, it is pretty big! Oh it was also mighty tasty! If you're looking for a quick decision I would recommend the special combination noodle soup, XL of course! or the rare beef with well done beef.
Fantastic pho place, especially the broth, fast and outstanding service, would be returning again for my pho fix!"}
{"text":"I've probably been to dozens and dozens of Pho (fa) joints in my life, and at least 5 different Pho 88 locations including Dixie/Dundas (est. 1989), Yonge/Shep, Dundas/Spadina and more recently Warden/Steeles. In my opinion the success of pho lies in the broth. The noodles and meat always have relevance, but if the broth isn't bang-on, fuggetaboutit.  

A delicious bowl of Pho is not a meal you can whip up at home on your lunch break. The broth is composed of meat bones and delicious spices taking hours and hours of simmering to complete.  The noodles are typically Banh Pho, the same rice noodles I and most purchase to make Pad Thai. 

Typical condiments and garnishes are hoisin sauce, sriracha, chili oil, basil, lime and bean sprouts. I am not the biggest fan of sriracha so I typically use just a tiny spoon or two of the oil from the bowl of chili. Common apps which I consume are their deep fried to sh!t spring rolls, as well as the cold shrimp rolls stuffed with shrimp, vermicelli, and some veg rolled in a rice paper. It's all about texture here. 

The menu at Pho 88 is rather gi-normous. They have many rice, vermicelli, and thai/viet dishes. I ONLY eat Pho and spring rolls from there, but I've heard the other food is solid. Back in the day I use to get the mother combination of steak, flank, fatty flank, rare & well done beef, tendon and tripe XL w/ double meat. Be warned if you order the XL you'll be tempted to take the bowl home to use as a flower pot, it is huge. These days my L bowl usually consists of simply rare & well done beef, or rare well done flank & tendon...Bang-on.

Ideal Order

West 88 Deep Fried Spring Rolls
Cold Shrimp Rolls
Rare & Well done Beef Pho
Hong Kong Style Tea (cold)
Fried Banana w/ Honey & Sesame Seeds"}
{"text":"I have been eating at Pho88 ever since I was in elementary school. The food is always delicious and good value. I have tried many different items and none of them have ever failed in my eyes. I usually share a large bowl with a friend since I can never finish it on my own (plus it's better value that way). The service is quick and even though there is a lineup during peak hours, it's never too long of a wait. 

One advice I give is that you wear your crappiest clothes there. You come out smelling like pho. While that sounds amazing, it's all the oil clinging to you."}
{"text":"Fair prices and good food. This is one of two go to places for me. It's not as good as home made pho but it's up there.

The service is super fast and the owners are really friendly. Go there a few times and they'll recognize you. They'll even notice when you haven't been in for a while."}
{"text":"I am somewhat biased by the fact that I come to this restaurant often and the staff treat me very nicely...on the other hand, that can also be seen as a positive recommendation of this restaurant.

This place is often quite busy at meal times but, because the food is always fresh and served quickly, wait times are rarely more than 15 minutes and often much faster.

There is a wide variety of traditional Pho as well as a wide assortment of rice and dry noodle dishes for those who are so inclined. As some have noted, the \"270\" Pho which features a slightly spicy coconut/peanut broth is a unique option I have never seen anywhere else and worth a try!

I often go here for a quick lunch during the work day with colleagues because an unhurried meal is done in under 40 minutes. However I do also come with my family from time to time as they all enjoy the food."}
{"text":"This is still my favourite place for Vietnamese Pho when I get the cravings for it. Conveniently located in the plaza with the Foody Mart supermarket, sometimes I would stop here to eat after finishing up grocery shopping since the car is parked already and don't have to fight for a parking spot again! Service is quick and efficient even though the restaurant gets super busy at times. 

The quality of the food is consistent over the last few times I came here and I like that their broth is not overly salty. The noodles served were still given out in generous portions which  filled me up. Super cheap and good value!

The restaurant hasn't been renovated in a long while including the washroom so it is best to only use it if it is really necessary!"}
{"text":"This is hands down one of the best pho restaurants there is! The best part about this restaurant is the delicious broth soup they offer and their extremely..extremely fast service. Service is typically what you expect at an Asian resto but who cares if you are that hungry, just give me food!"}
{"text":"I know how to appreciate a good pho but this location was slightly below the average expectation. It is located at the end, in the inside of a Chinese Plaza, and really hard to find a parking spot. Additionally, the interior isn't much better. Very crowded with poor spacing. Tables everywhere and hard to get by from door, to your seat, and even to the washroom. Environment is tight spaced with a slight above average noise level. Servers don't really speak English which is quite unfortunate for customers like myself. Not the cleanest restaurant with a poor interior design. My first experience here was quite disappointing and probably would not go back."}
{"text":"A very decent place for quick meals. Love their noodle, it taste different and better than other locations. The soup base is okay not outstanding. I have to specially mention their fried spring rolls, they were the most delicious spring rolls I have ever tasted (ingredients: vermicelli noodles, carrots, mince meats & vegetables). Fried chicken wings are one of my favorite dishes as well and it has to be eaten with lemon juices. Both the spring rolls and chicken wings are very crispy and tasty. I also recommend their strawberry smoothies. 
Approx. $15 per person, big portions, very worthy. 
Cleanliness is below average, I always like to wipe the table again with napkins. 
Very busy during lunch hours, expect some waits. 
Good place for late night food and drink !!"}
{"text":"Pho 88 is a classic Vietnamese crack in the wall, the restaurants atmosphere is live throughout most of the day but it can also get too loud, it's not the cleanest place iv been to but it isn't the worst.

Food wise iv tried a variety of items on their menu and one of my favourites is truly beef satay, the coconut and peanut soup base has this amazing refreshing taste and feeling, if you're looking for something with a bit more kick I suggest you check 127 it's a classic soup broth with beef and a good heat level to make out sweat as you eat. 

The prices and size (including the quality) are rather good they serve food that's up to my expectations for somewhere that's rather small and the service is rather nice, iv known the lady's for quite a while now and whenever I walk in they don't even ask how many anymore. The food arrives within 5 min of ordering which is amazing because I suggest you come hungry to this place as the size of the bowls are huge I usually settle for a Medium but if your feeling daring and I mean really daring get the XL it's massive and usually meant for 2 people. 

The reason why I gave pho 88 3 stars is for their cleanliness the bathrooms are rather first and something's sous the rest of the restaurant if they take a little more effort and clean the area a bit more it would truly become a 5 star location."}
{"text":"Have been coming here for over 15 years. Have always loved coming here. I always order the Pho Tai with the meet on the side as the meet tends to overcook when in the bowl."}
{"text":"12:22am Jun 4 2017
While waiting for Pho a small cocroach crawled to our table
My family and I refused the food and left with disgust"}
{"text":"Great beef pho special.

Noisy, busy joint with long wait times. Its always busy every time I visit this place. Guess that's because their Phos are very delicious.... And full worth a try!"}
{"text":"Great food at great prices. It's open late most nights and has become one of my favourite spots for late dinners. I recommend the vermicelli, and the pho is always ready to go."}
{"text":"Not a bad spot for Vietnamese, though it gets really packed during lunch time, some come early."}
{"text":"I always share the special beef noodle soup, spring rolls, and grilled chicken vermicelli. I love the owner and her sister - they make you feel welcomed and at home. It is fast food and your food comes within 15 minutes. The food is fresh and the broth is very tasty. I have tasted their curry beef before and it contains heavy coconut milk and strips of beef - it is very delicious. I have tried their appetizer too - with rice paper wraps and Vietnamese sausage! It was pretty good and for people who have not had Viet food yet - it is a must try!

To end off the evening, I had the avocado shake!"}
{"text":"This is my definition of comfort food. The prices are good, portions are respectable and the service is fast.
I can't help but assume there is MSG if you are concerned about that, each time I go, I leave very thirsty despite drinking a gallon of tasty broth."}
{"text":"I'm from California, but was in Canada for a wedding. Over the course of of a couple days, I got to try a couple of restaurants including Pho 88. Of course, I did not come in with high expectations because I have been severely disappointed by XL pho back home. 

HOWEVER, my experience at Pho 88 was competly different. The XL special combination pho was truly heavenly! The bowl was huge with generous amounts of beef, tendons, and noodles. The soup was not loaded with msg and tasted genuine. 

There are a couple of cons: no jalepenos, no sauce dish, crowded and one rude server.

BUT DON'T LET THAT DISCOURAGE YOU. I swear, if I had the money, I would fly to Canada just to eat that bowl fo XL pho. :)"}
{"text":"My go to pho spot. The price is amazing the food is amazing THE PORTIONS ARE AMAZING! Definitely get the house special if this is your first time going you can't go wrong with it. Also the sprig rolls were pretty good too. Highly recommend everyone to this place"}
{"text":"Disappointed, so many msg and chicken powder goes on that soup , destroyed that bone stock. , and the meat topping was messy , not tender  ,wasn't enough for that price . Sore throat after eating that soup"}
{"text":"I honestly love the food here but I dont like the fact that they keep changing the prices each time I order. Its not like I order different food each time. My boyfriend and I always take out (2) vermicelli noodles with pork with 1 extra a side order of pork because It isnt enough meat for both of us. When we pick up total is sometimes $30, $29, $28.. at one point it went to $34!!! its outragous! Hopefully we can find another viet spot that is just as good but lower prices"}
{"text":"Came to Pho 88 with boyfriend after attending Orfeo ed Euridice @ the Four Seasons Centre for Performing Arts.  I had literally come home, and with 15 minutes to glam up - skipped dinner altogether.  

Pho is always one of those things I enjoy - my mom's side of the family are Chinese, but grew up in Vit Nam.  So from growing up as a kid when my grandmother used to make it, to going out to eat it - its one of my fave things to eat.  

It is located in a plaza that also houses Foody Mart, so, as Jennifer K. stated, depending on what day of the week and time you intend on dining at Pho 88, parking CAN be a nightmare!

It was already about 9:30PM by the time we sat down at Pho 88, so we ordered a large Ph c bit (beef flank, beef tendon, beef tripe) to share.  An Avocado Milkshake and Sour Sop (Sinh To Mang Cau) milkshake were also ordered   

For me, the measure of a good pho restaurant is its soup base.  The soup base at Pho 88 gets 5 stars for intense flavour.  The pho noodles weren't the freshest (deduct 1 star), but they were quite tasty.  The beef tendons were not overly glutinous and cooked just right.  The beef flank was sliced thinly and the tripe had a nice crunch to it.  Condiments (hoisin sauce, hot sauce, hot chili oil) are found at the table.  All Pho comes with the standard bean sprouts, hot pepper, lime and basil.  

Sour Sop is one of those fruits that I would classify as an exotic fruit.  Most people haven't even heard of it.  Sour Sop?  Is that a new flavour of candy or something?  It is a white, pulpy fruit, that would be a hybrid of a citrus fruit and coconut... It has the tang of a citrus fruit, but is white and pulp-like as a coconut.  That's my best attempt at explaining what sour sop is.

Pho 88 definitely makes it into my books as a good place to get an authentic bowl of Vietnamese Beef Noodle Soup!"}
{"text":"Another day, another Pho restaurant! I love Pho.. Did I tell you how much I love it? Lol I don't have any check in for this place bc I haven't been eating around in this area, but this would be my go-to place for Pho. The staff are friendly but very loud. It's best that you sit away from the cash area bc like all older Asians, they're loud lol! I'm not sure if friendly is the best word to describe them because they have done some extremely friendly deeds to a few of my friends. During the huge blackout back in 2003, a friend and her family had no place to go to or eat (no food at home). They went everywhere for food but none of the restaurants welcomed them. So they happen to pass by this place and the owner asked them if they were looking for food. Keep in mind the restaurant had already closed bc of the blackout. The owner welcomed them in and fed them, prepped them food for the NEXT DAY all for free too (obviously they paid at the end). That is how goodness should spread and how giving should be, unconditionally. I always tip them more than I should bc I know the owner has the biggest heart I have witnessed in recent years! 

I'm giving this place 4.5 stars bc food, rep and goodness are not enough for a restaurant alone. I doc'ed 0.5 off bc the overall cleanliness of this place, especially the washroom, is unbearable. You can smell the washroom before you open the door and it's a pretty serious issue bc it's right beside the kitchen. Overall a very good place! :)

They speak Vietnamese, Cantonese and Mandarin (not 100% sure on the last one)"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite Vietnamese restaurant in Toronto. This is one of my favorite comfort food ever. I pretty much grew up with it ~ must be over 12 years. I've tried many places but always end up back here. I say it's the pho soup base that keeps bringing me back. It's also the quality meat that they use. The beef that they use are fatty but not too fatty. Its always consistent - even after all these years. As well, the portions here are great and prices are reasonable. However, decor here hasn't changed much and service isn't that great but at least they are efficient and food here makes up for it. This isnt exactly a place where you will stay and chat after eating. Just a warning though, it can be very packed during lunch and dinner, weekdays and weekends... After all, it's a pretty popular local spot. I'm addicted - I'll always be back."}
{"text":"I'll start off by saying I LOVEEE #270 on the menu.. Its a bit spicy, has a coconut and peanut flavour soup, and the usual Beef, a couple pieces of pineapples, Pho noodles.

It may sound odd but if you're not allergic to any of those ingredients, definitely try it! It's BOMB! =D

The only bad thing is Parking isn't great and the service staff are really busy and they have a nonchalant attitude. 

And the other thing is, they sit you beside strangers which is cool I guess But no privacy."}
{"text":"This place is dirty and quick, quality of the meat and broth is really below average but its OK for a quick bite and to satisfy my pho craving. Don't expect quality service or food when coming here."}
{"text":"I want to warn customer to check your bill before you paid, they don't write the price on the bill. We ordered 4 XL pho for 4 adults and a child but when we received the bill, noticed we got extra charge on bill and asked the lady, she was rude and raied her voice said because we were sharing 4 bowl of pho for 5 people, she tried to protect herself pointed us to see the note on the menu (only on the first page). They also extra charged if you change dry to fresh noodles. I had never heard exta charge on sharing dishes anywhere else.

One time i called in just for a take out, they charged extra on the take out container. Really don't understand the purpose of take out or i should bring my own containers.

Both ladies are running a robbery restaurant. It was horrible experience overall. I definatly not going back again and not suggest to come eat here."}
{"text":"I have been to this Pho 88 since university years. The soup is always consistently good. I ordered the seafood pho and I like it how they use beef broth. Usually, other places use chicken broth. We ordered the spring roll and that was good too. Will always be back when I have a pho craving!"}
{"text":"I'll give this two stars because the food is good. That said, the customer service is very bad here. On more than one occasion, we were charged extra just because we were sharing our XL beef pho noodles. How ridiculous is that? We gave this place a second chance and decided to order two things because it was two of us. We STILL got charged extra for the same reason. And so when we left a tip, we got called out while leaving because we didn't leave enough. I guess that's what you get for overcharging us without being transparent with your customers. I haven't been back here since."}
{"text":"Still one of my favorite pho places.  Most places use the cheap thinly sliced beef... But here it's nice and thick and tender. The broth this time wasn't as flavorful... But still very good. Wish this was closer to home... I'd visit more often."}
{"text":"Definitely my go to pho place whenever I'm visiting home. However I do not go so often because the soup base is salty and I don't eat salty food too often."}
{"text":"Pretty much an update on Pho 88, well I decided to improve my rating thanks to their amazing service when I went back again for another bowl of comforting pho."}
{"text":"Pho is a good size for reasonable price. It's good to get a large size and share it's good enough for 2 people. I also got the beef and rice it was good the portion of beef is a little small"}
{"text":"This place is my regular pho place because the food is always consistently good. I think what makes this place special is their rice noodles. They also have best spring rolls that are always hot and crisp."}
{"text":"Came with friends for Sunday lunch. Must say, this place hasn't changed: super busy and crowds everywhere.

We were seated not long after and glad we came at the right time. Literally after we were seated, there was a huge line up that formed. So we were given the corner table near the cashier, we noticed the walls aren't as clean as we thought: fruit flies on the wall. Hints of uncleanliness. I wonder if the city health inspectors will take a note of that or not. 

Onto the food: Once we ordered, the food came out not long after. So that's not bad in terms of speed. However, food is just okay and filling. Nothing much beyond that. You can't expect much from a place like this, and that's probably why I stopped coming. 

So another bad experience over the long weekend."}
{"text":"Went here all the time back in university days... late night and dependable. Quick, no nonsense tea slamming on the table, service... good times.

Not the best pho in town but when its late at night and you need your pho in this area, come on by."}
{"text":"The pho are really good and the noodles have a very nice texture to them. However, the workers are screaming from across the room and it's very chaotic. They are pretty rude as well my mom asked for an extra bowl for my sister and the lady literally smacked it on the table and walked away yelling(why am I not suprised). The price are the same as any other pho place."}
{"text":"I walked in and walked out no more then 1 min. I told the waitress table for one and she try to seat me with a woman that was seating on a table for 4. I ask there is so many table here open why do I have to seat beside someone I don't know. She replied it might be busy and need those table. What are JOKE!!!! I left. You think people have any common sense!!!"}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would definitely do that. When I walked into the restaurant, I was hopeful that this would be the restaurant to satisfy my pho craving.
 First, they told us to sit near the cashier, we didn't have much choice on where we wanted to sit because there was leftover food, plates, and bowls on eight or nine tables.   
   We sat down and it took them five minutes to bring us a menu. Then, we were ready to order, but none of the waiters bothered to serve us because they were too busy talking about their everyday dramas at work. 
 Onto the food: We ordered the special 101 and 102. I don't even know where to start with this. I lost my appetite just from looking at it. Before tasting it, I can already see half an inch of fat hovering on the soup.   I tasted a little bit of the soup and I can already tell that there is so much msg in this and it's not a good pho that had beef bones boiled for hours. The meat they gave was either a thin shred of beef or a big piece of fat. The food just wasn't there.
  The bill came, and they charged me for sharing? I understand some restaurants do, but they don't even tell you. 
   What a surprise! After the meal my whole family isn't feeling too well. I hope their issue of dirtiness is addressed with public health because I don't understand how they passed."}
{"text":"My go to place for pho 
I find the food decent and service is always fast. Service is your typically Chinese waiter pretty rude and little to no emotion, but that's not out of the ordinary."}
{"text":"I came here today for lunch and this is definitely my goto phone spot from now on... The spring rolls were huge and delicious and the soup broth is not too waterway and not too salty... It's just right!!! I thought this would be another one of those situations where the place doesn't live up to the hype... But I can say this place definitely lives up to it. 

The service leaves a little to be desired in terms of friendliness... But Speed on the other hand was insane!!! I made my order and then went to the washroom to wash my hands and by the time I got back and took off my jacket, my food was just rolling up. quick and tasty just how I like it.. 
WHAM BAM THANK YOU VIETNAM!  :)"}
{"text":"Summary: this go-to, late-night pho place offers efficiency, quantity, value and satisfaction in a grubby, old school, packed location. Service will be meh; food will be satisfying

Their 101XL (house special pho) is the standard by which all other pho is compared. No fancy frills, no cute add ons - just all their different kinds of meat, a ton of noodles, and some beansprouts and lime on the side.

It's cheap, it's got a good portion of meat, and it's filling.

It'll also come blazing fast. Friends who work there insist the soup/broth is made with zero MSG too... But things change and people change so don't take my word for it.

But it's the throwback where I always go back to."}
{"text":"Im not impressed with their service.  

Food is meh. Noodles aren't silky at all and the chicken is soggy! I've had better pho at Angus Pho House and Vietnamese Noodle Star. 

The waitress just grabbed our order form when we were ready. The other waitress didn't tell us what our order is,  she just put it on the table and we had to clarify.

This is not the best pho. Noodles aren't silky and the chicken is soggy!  Gross. 

I wasn't sour about the experience until we left to pay. Another waitress asked us \"Can you leave more tip for the waitress?\" Excuse me? I am not forced to tip, nor am I obliged to tip at all.  We were barely served.  Though we did tip,  I just found that gesture rude. I have never been approached by a waitress like that."}
{"text":"Was too loud. Definitely not a place for a nice conversation. But if you're there for food only it's good. Lots of options as for food wise but service was sometimes hard to get. But the good thing was they weren't rude and didn't rush you to give up your table."}
{"text":"Our family loves this place and visit often whenever we are in the area. Highly recommended.

Food: 4/5, great broth and tasty spring rolls but there have been times where the rolls are slightly soggy. The noodles are the best here and large portions of beef for pho tai.

Service: 3/5, not much as they just bring the food and unfortunately the servers look a little angry most of the time but it's quick.

Ambience: 3/5, seating is fine but you may want that it is not very well ventilated and can get very humid.

Price: 3/5, about $10-15 per person."}
{"text":"Look at this nasty worm. Horrible service, horrible nasty food. Once you ordered, the server will never come back until you request the bill. 2 servers working on a busy Canada day. If you can't provide good service, dont even open. Won't come back ever."}
{"text":"Lol 4 stars previously? Yeah.. ok.. 

I come here if I don't feel like driving further. The parking lot makes an artery pop each time I'm here.. I'm running out, man!! The quality of pho has deteriorated throughout the years.. the beef does not come rare anymore. Also they use the cheap part of the cow so it's not even good quality. When I did get beef pho here, I'd always ask for it on the side so I can shabu shabu my beef until it's more rare than the pokemons I used to collect. The noodles are ok. Standard- so, ok. The satay beef noodle soup makes me cough up a lung. Adding chili oil to a bowl of plain beef broth does NOT make it 'satay', ma'am. 

Crowd control is not their strong point. Sure, they're used to the crowds but can they handle it? Barely. We were sat down at a table on a busy afternoon, had a menu thrown at us and no sheet provided for us to order. Then my friend put his arm down and we realized the table had not even been wiped!! What kind of blasphemy is this? I don't mind waiting longer, dude, but please please please wipe your damn tables before seating people! When paying, I went up to pay because we had to split the bill and the lady was like \"can you hurry?\" when I was already walking through the crowd to the front where my friend was paying for his meal already. I paid about $11 for a $7 bowl of pho so the tip certainly was generous (for a pho place). When I got to the front, she grabbed my money and didn't say a word. Ok. Bye. 
Mind you, their service is not always so horrendous. Only some days. 

Tip: if you're vegan, there is almost nothing you can eat here. Even their 'vegetarian stuff' is only vegetarian."}
{"text":"What happened to the peanut noodles?! Just a year or so ago the soup was still rich and creamy and now it's just orange water. Come on, peanut butter is not expensive. 

The rest of the menu is still fine though."}
{"text":"A popular pho place in the Bamburgh Circle area. Usually quite busy here as lots of people come here especially on weekday nights. Usually you can get a seat as the turnover time is quick and they are very good at that. They have a good selection of your common Vietnamese dishes like pho, vermicelli, satay skewers and spring rolls etc... I ordered the spring rolls and the special XL Pho dish with lots of beef in it. Fairly good size for about $9. I didn't like the spring rolls though. I thought it was fried but it wasn't great at all as it was dry and it didn't taste great. The pho was delicious and had lots of beef and noodles. Overall, decent place for good pho and they give you pretty generous portions. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I came back here 3 years after my poor experience, and am pleasantly surprised by the food quality in comparison to the rest of the pho places around the area. 

House Special Pho - meat is plentiful and doesn't taste bad, good kind of noodles are used, broth is delicious but has too much MSG 

Lemongrass Chicken - good flavour, but meat was too dry, rice is microwaved, and veggies are soaked in oil and barely hot. yuck

Drip Coffee - super yummy"}
{"text":"Recommended - satay beef if you love spicy soups and scallop - bacon skewers. Kids prefer this than Macdonald's."}
{"text":"Been here twice now.  Not too bad.  Tables are a bit close so space is limited in the place.  Not good for groups.  Maybe two to four people per party max.  Tasty food but a bit stingy on the meats when it comes to the pho noodles compared to the competition."}
{"text":"This place is decent - I usually get the house special with all the different types of beef/tripe/beef balls etc. The rice noodles are okay, you can tell they just cook them in water and then when ordered they place it into the beef broth. It's pretty bland, I could put a bouillon in chicken/beef broth and it would taste the same if not better. They claim there is no MSG in their soup base but all businesses tend to do that nowadays. To add taste to their house special, most people have to load up their noodles with the oyster sauce & hot sauce. This place is also always busy.. You do get your noodles faster than cooked rice dishes for obvious reasons.

Their appetizers are decent, I get their rice roll wraps with shrimp or whatever, they give you fish sauce or oyster sauce with peanuts. 

I dislike that they give you your ordered cold drinks (milkshakes etc) AFTER you get your meal. 

Plus the service here is crap - the ladies are pretty rude and it's always busy because of the location and their hours. 

It's decent pho nonetheless, I would give it 3* but due to service it was a -1 for me."}
{"text":"Average at best. Meat quality in the phoisnt that good. Place is kind of dirty. Service is fast but will not return. There are tons of better pho places out there."}
{"text":"This is the best Pho place I have been to (nothing beats my mom's pho though lol) and I have been to numerous pho places all around North America. As soon as you walk in the aroma of the broth wins you over instantly.  The picnic bench style seating creates a social atmosphere which I love.  Order fresh noodles with your pho and you will be delighted by the difference from the dry kind.  A must go if you want to just get some tasty hot pho."}
{"text":"??plaza??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????!"}
{"text":"Over the years this place has been on the decline, expect the stench of ammonia based cleaners ever present in the dining area. Food is nothing to be excited about, the only thing this place has going for it is that it is open past midnight and is alright for desperation food after nights of bad decisions."}
{"text":"Good food, really loud and crowded.  Service is what you would expect in a restaurant like this.  Looks like I showed up at the right time, shortly after sitting down the lineup was out the door."}
{"text":"Despite all its faults, I'm always brought back to this place close to home. Agreed that the service and environment could be a lot better, but no frills great value that fills you up is something you can't hate on. House special 101 and the springs rolls are the classics that you cannot go wrong with here."}
{"text":"I always come here and order the same thing every time: Satay beef pho. It's the best in the city, in my opinion. Service is very efficient here... organized chaos, as some may call it.
There is plenty of seating, though parking can be a pain despite there being so many parking spaces. I also tried their vermicelli dishes... wasn't a fan. They use the thick vermicelli nooodles, which may be great for you if that's your thing. 

Try to notice when you go, the lady who greets everyone always says \"Haiiiii\", and she says that often (to greet people, to acknowledge someone's request, to give someone's bill, etc). The reason is because she's actually saying \"hi\" to greet people, and \"hai\" for everything else (\"hai\" is a Cantonese word to show acknowledgement). Get a good chuckle out of it."}
{"text":"Absolutely atrocious customer sevice from both the waitresses and the owner.

Come into the store the 1/3 full store at 3 pm in the day.  Go find your own seat.  Want a menu?  Go back to the front to get it yourself.  Tea and cup gets slapped onto onto the table without any eye contact.  Order gets grabbed from my hand without a word or eye contact.  

Owner deceitfully adds additional charge for debit card usage without informing the customer.  Card machine gets slapped down in front of me.  Both the owner and waitresses can't be bothered to interact or even speak. 

The result?  No tip.  It's only then the lady owner has the audicity to speak with a heavy dose of attitude about why there is no tip.

All the issues were explained to her and she refuses to accept it and continues to be belligerent.  Sorry, lady, I don't accept BS and strong arming, especially from people who don't deserve it.  You want tips for your waitresses?  Tell them to stop emulating your terrible behaviour so they can earn it.  I've giving plenty of tips but they all earn it by a simple smile and and eye contact, you and your people managed to do even to do that.

I'm not the only reviewer here who has noticed that the owner has revolting behaviour and think they can bully customers.

Beware of this restaurant."}
{"text":"3.5

This place in general is a pretty good pho place. You come in starving and you'll leave feeling really full. Let's talk portions here, they give a good ratio of meat to noodles unlike many other pho places. Taste-wise... it might not be the best but their chili oil is pretty good and it makes the soup taste good. 
Pho 88 is what you expect a pho place to look like. It's loud, dirty, and kinda smells bad honestly. So if you're coming in expecting some fine dining and fancy candlelit date... just don't come here okay?

Verdict: it's pretty good, you'll get full and it's not too expensive.
What you'd expect from a pho place!

That's all."}
{"text":"This place seems like a busy and crazy hot spot for locals...and for good reason, delicious!

Pad thai beef with a dash of hot sauce and I was in bliss!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere: floors were dirty, typical Vietnamese setting 
Food: 
1. Bun Bo hue: worst bun Bo ever. The soup was beyond bland, presentation was horrible, and the veggies that came with it were all wilted. 

2. Bun thit nuong, cha gio: so everyone was raving about their spring rolls and I had to try. This was also a disappointment! Spring rolls were filled with beans instead of actual meat. Their grilled pork was rock hard. Couldn't get through either meals 

Overall: definitely won't be bad."}
{"text":"My quest for a decent pho place in/near the Markham area continues. The large crowds and late night hours drew me into this joint. This place is lively with large gangs of kids that will remind you of your high school cafeteria. The Pho broth is clean, simple and it does the job. The noodles are done the way they should be; al-dente yet still soft. However, I did not enjoy the little bits of ground-beef like cuts of meat though. Not very impressive when you have to eat the beef with a spoon because they are too small to be picked up with chopsticks. The menu is larger than the holy bible (seriously, where do they even come up with all this stuff?). The prices bring you back a few years. Service is angry yet very efficient. A definite place visit when you are craving pho in the middle of the night or to revisit your high school years."}
{"text":"There is no comparison in Markham. I got off a 4 hr flight recently and wanted something that warms the stomach with no gimmicks or surprises and I always comeback to this place.
For the best pho, I would head down to Ossington but as I live in Markham, Pho 88 is pretty darn good.
The regular is raw and cooked beef with tripe. If I feel good. I'll also order a soursop, my wife orders the coconut juice which has coconut pieces.
As for the noodles, they are soft with a bit of chewiness. The beef is nothing amazing. The broth is tasty and you do get a hint of the MSG.
The best is the consistency. No surprises or issues, the same tasty hot bowl of noodles we've had for years.
FYI, surprisingly can be busy on weekends and late are night."}
{"text":"Been here since 2005 and it is safe to say everything's been consistent (aside from the price that's gone up-acceptable). This restaurant is my favorite place to go for pho in the GTA. It is owned by a nice couple from Vietnam who knows how to speak Cantonese as well. My favorite order is 119- Brisket Pho (Ve don) and the fried springrolls. Everything about the pho is perfect; from the noodles to the brisket and especially the broth. The service is mediocre but quick and waitresses aren't really friendly but it is most likely because of how busy the place gets."}
{"text":"Nice steady place to go for Pho and the owners are so friendly here.
There's nothing super special about their pho, but they manage to keep a decent \"comfort\" quality to their dishes that I like. 

Broth is not too salty and there's good flavour. I like that there's chilli oil.. a lot of places only have the paste or srirracha which I don't actually enjoy in soup noodles quite as much. :) 

It's just a nice place to get a really quick bite! Cheap food, good portions, and really quick service."}
{"text":"I've eaten pho at this place a few times over many years, and the quality has been consistent. Expect quick service; don't expect attentive service. Try the Vietnamese iced coffee if you've never tried it (takes a while to drip)."}
{"text":"My experience resonate with some of the comments below. My rating is half star for the soup base and the other half for the speed. The service was really bad. While they haven't been rude to us, we saw how impolite the two ladies were treating other customers. The whole dinner experience involved a lot of pushing around, yelling, shouting....

It was 6ish on a Friday night. And this place got busy shortly after we ordered.

We ordered a deep fried spring roll, one rare beef pho and one rare beef plus chicken pho.
We were so excited to see the picture on the menu that rare beef comes on the side. But it was sooo bad when it arrived. Not only was the beef not on a separate dish (which I can live with), but also it was all clumped together. They didn't even bother to loosen up the slices of beef. And the beef had the faintest pink that I have ever seen in a rare beef pho, essentially it's well done. The spring roll was fair though I found it tastes more like a potato patty. 

As for the bill that came there was no pretax subtotal so if you want to check the bill you may want to do the calculation when ordering. 

Bottom line, for this price I can go somewhere cleaner with better food, less yelling and most of all, more basic respect for customers. 

Not returning and definitely not recommending."}
{"text":"What can I say? It's a great pho place, nothing too special, but what separates this from the other places is the location. It's only two minutes from where I live! That will ultimately decide which places will eat at the most. So it's a good pho place to go to if you're in Scarborough. I love ordering the bowl that includes an assortment of meat, it works for me all the time. 
It can get a little tight in there when it's busy, I assume they crammed a ton of tables in such a small area to be able to serve a lot of people. Other than that, it's a solid choice."}
{"text":"One of my favourite places in Scarborough for pho, with the best thing on the menu for me being the coconut pho (#270) on the menu. The large is enough for two people easily. Always come back sometimes multiple times in the week because it tends to be that addicting.
Service is also very fast, and for $9 for a large...one just cannot go wrong!"}
{"text":"Firstly, let me say that I got here at noon sharp and the place was packed. Thankfully there is a lot of seating so we were able to sit down right away. There was tea ready at the table which was a nice touch that we didn't have to wait. We were quickly greeted by our server and knowing that we were going to order the rare beef pho and the deep fried vegetarian spring rolls. 

The food arrived promptly. The Pho's were accompanied by the tradition bean sprout, Thai basil and chili's. 

I have read a previous reviews comments about the bean sprouts being brown, but I can say that ours were fresh on this day. 

The broth itself was good and tasted fresh. There was a very healthy serving of noodles as well as beef. Most pho places I have been two serves about half as much beef as this place. 

The veggie spring rolls tasted good but I found them to become too soggy too quickly. The sauce that accompanied the spring rolls wasn't balanced properly and therefore there was too much of a fish sauce taste to the sauce. 

All in all I would return. The price is about $1 more than other pho places for a small pho but I didn't mind as this place is very close to my office. 

It's 1pm now and we still haven't been offered the bill - meaning that we've been here for an hour. I didn't feel rushed at all despite another reviewer feeling that way. 

My only real issue besides the soggy spring rolls was the men's bathroom. It was pretty dirty and I did point out to the lady in charge that she should have someone clean it."}
{"text":"Came here at 1AM on New Years Day. A nice pho place. I'm a fan of pho and this place did not disappoint! Not my fav place but I wouldn't mind coming back. Worth trying at least once."}
{"text":"I come here almost every time when I'm craving for Pho.  Love their broth, and of course, their deep fried spring rolls are pretty good.  

This place is always packed during lunch and dinner.  And still have so many people during off-peak hours. 

Service is efficient.  Price is good too :-D"}
{"text":"Dirty utensil, dirty plates, dirty bowl (always feel oily) when going there.

Better off going to pho 99 or the plaza at warden and Steeles"}
{"text":"I tried #270 after reading it on Christine Z's review ... and it's amazing.  This item is in a separate section on the menu and there was no description on the paper they give you to mark your orders, so it took a while to look up what it was.  It's basically the \"Special Pho\" on a coconut and peanut soup base and it's soooo good! I've never had this anywhere else!  I squeezed double the amount of lime juice in it and I think everything went together very well.

If you get the rare beef pho, ask for the raw beef on the side so you can put the meat in the boiling soup yourself.  You can control how well you want your beef to be cooked that way, and it's a lot more fun - just like hot pot!"}
{"text":"This is my go-to Vietnamese Pho restaurant because you can get a massive portion of soup noodle for less than $10. I highly recommended it.

Usually when my mom and I are doing grocery shopping at Foody Mart we would stop by Pho 88 to grab a lunch. We would order the XL size House Special Pho and ask for 2 small bowls to share it. The portion is massive, as the size of the bowl is as wide as my body. Not only that there is plenty of Vietnamese rice noodles but also tons of meats (raw beef strips, beef tripes, beef tendons, and beef meatballs). Also, there is a complementary plate of bean sprouts and mint on the side. The soup has nice flavour and usually I don't get very thirsty afterwards, so I don't think they put a lot of MSG in the soup. Sometimes if we order something extra on the side we can't finish the Special Pho so we would pack it and it's breakfast the next day. What a good deal. 

Other than the Pho I also like their rice dishes as the portion and flavour is really food as well. I like the chicken with fried egg and shredded pork rice dish. Additionally, I'm a huge fan of their iced Vietnamese Dripped Coffee. Vietnamese coffee is different because they let the coffee slowly drip from the container into a cup of ice, and then you add in condensed milk to your preferred sweetness. The flavour is not like any other type of coffee that I've tasted before, I really like the richness of the strong coffee and the sweet and creaminess that the condensed milk brings. 

However, since the food here is super cheap, the owners didn't invest in the renovation of the restaurant much. And yeah, don't expect much in terms of service. Usually you write down your order by your self on a piece of paper with the menu printed on it and they will take it back to the kitchen, then brings your food. There isn't much interaction between the server and the customer, but I don't really mind as I'm just here for a cheap and quick meal, and so are many of their other customers, as the restaurant has a lot of traffic throughout the weekend. One thing that I have some issues with though is that the place always feels kinda of greasy and icky, thus I'm deducting a star off of my rating."}
{"text":"Used to be a go-to for pho until my recent visit.  Ordered two dishes and they brought the wrong order for both dishes, but they insisted it was right.  They ended up only changing the soup base for one of the dishes after I asked the servers twice, but they didn't change the shrimp to the beef that I had ordered.  I also never got the plate of beansprout, and lime that their noodles usually come with after asking for it.  As for the curry chicken that was also ordered they gave me a bowl of noodles with no chicken in it and I told them I didn't order the bowl of noodles.  I was beyond frustrated at this point, so I just ate what they brought and asked for the bill.  As I expected they charged me for the stuff I ordered, but I didn't get the dishes that was ordered so they overcharged me.  I decided to give less tips, and while I was leaving, the lady chases after me to pressure for more tips.  Needless to say, I just walked away and will not be returning here in the future."}
{"text":"Overall 3.5/5.0

Every time we came here, this place always very busy. Service was very quick. We always order the large well done beef flank pho and Shrimp spring rolls. The pho was mediocre but we love the spring rolls very much. They also have deep fried banana, which is also a very nice late night dessert despite the calories:) Will still go back whenever we crave phos."}
{"text":"Boss lady was really rude and this place is disgusting. I've been coming in whenever I felt sick and needed some soup and didn't take the boss' attitude personally, but as I went up to pay, she literally ignored me to help the other person waiting behind me. I told her my table so I can get my bill but she didn't understand and yelled across the room to ask her staff where I was sitting. I paid and tipped them either way. Then, she came chasing me and tapped my shoulder roughly because apparently I needed to pay a $2 service fee for using visa instead of debit. I should have told her to take it from the tip I gave them. The food is usually good here but today it was gross and came with a side of extra attitude."}
{"text":"Food is good.
Prices are mediocre.
Service is awful.

I come here from time to time as I live five minutes away, however when I want actual good pho, I'll take a bus & go elsewhere rather than come here. I've been here at least a dozen times & it's always the same thing. 

Food:
Decent, comes out quick. I usually always order 'the Special' which is a bowl of beef in peanut/coconut broth (#270) & deep fried veggie spring rolls (#5). Sometimes the spring rolls with be cold as if they pull them out of the fridge or had them sitting on the counter, but they're always still tasty.


Prices:
For what you get, I find it pricey. You can get much better pho for the same price. 


Service:
It's unbelievable how they treat their customers. It isn't just a race thing either as I've seen them be incredibly rude to chinese customers. They throw your food on the table, sometimes making the food fall off or the soup splash out onto you. 

It's really hard to get the attention when you need it. Raising your hand doesn't seem to do anything, waving it either. Calling after them while they walk by you for the 4th time of trying to get their attention gets you a scoff, sometimes an eye roll, & a \"yes\" said through pursed lips.

However the worst experience I've ever had was about leaving a tip. I went up to pay for my 13$ meal & afterwards the attendant at the counter said I could leave a tip on the tray. I put down 1.50$ considering I always leave 10% even when the service is bad & I walked away. While walking out of the place, the lady followed me & my friends through the place saying loudly: \"You need to put a tip on the tray!\". I'm sorry, but that's so incredibly rude to do to a paying customer. I can understand you need to make money, but you can't force a customer to tip you. Makes me rather walk the 2 minutes to McDonald's than deal with it all."}
{"text":"Love the soup!  They have plenty of choices on the menu, but after visiting this restaurant semi-regularly over the past number of years, I pretty much order the same thing each time: soup and fresh rolls.  I've tried a couple of (similar) variations of both, but my favourites are the Pho with rare beef and the shredded pork with shrimp wraps (non-fried).  As a meat-atarian, I always order the small soup with extra meat (it comes on the side).  Sometimes they bring a small side bowl of broth which helps (pre)cook the extra beef because the meat is usually chilled and putting that extra cold meat in the main soup bowl brings the temperature down quickly.  

One other tip that someone else mentioned, the parking in that mall is terrible, so be prepared."}
{"text":"I came here with my bf to order pho after hearing all the raving reviews from my friends, and was greatly disappointed.  Even from the start from entering the restaurant, I noticed it was extremely dirty and the lady seated us at a table of four with a random man already at the table even though another table was getting cleaned already while another was completely empty.  Really? 

The noodles were inconsistently cooked, the bottom half was just right but the top half was still hard and not thoroughly cooked yet.  They use dry noodles, which is no problem for me but at least cook it properly? 

The beef had too much fatty tissue in it, resulted in a strange texture in it and the soup wasn't that great.  

Price is very good, but I would rather pay more for better quality pho."}
{"text":"Pho 88 is probably the most popular vietnamese food chain in Toronto.  This location along with the Alton Tower location are the ones I frequent the most in the past 20+ years I've lived in Markham.  

The pho here is excellent.  The best in Markham by far.  The soup is always tasty, the beef is thinly sliced and easy to eat, the noodles are always cooked perfect.  

Last time I went to the Alton Tower location with my sister, we ordered a combo meal which was a great deal for $12 (two phos, two cold drinks, spring roll).  I don't recall the name of the drinks (honey lemon ice tea?) but they were probably the best i've had at an Asian restaurant.

Definitely recommended for your pho fix!  :-)"}
{"text":"We came here on a Friday afternoon. We got the spring rolls as an appetizer and the \"pho tai nam bo vien\" to share. Our waitress was able to speak Vietnamese. Therefore, a possible sign of authenticity! Even though the spring rolls was our appetizer, it came after our pho. Not too much of a big deal for a casual restaurant in my opinion. The pho had a clear broth. However, it was overly salty and left us very thirsty after! The noodles were cooked well, still having a crunch to it. However, the \"rare\" beef was completely cooked by the time it came to our table! Then came the spring rolls. The wrap was too thick to our liking and was mostly stuffed with taro. We probably won't order that again. Overall, I would come back only if I'm really craving pho and in the area."}
{"text":"In terms of pho I don't think there is any place better. Lots of meat, good price and super fast service. The place is always busy and when I put in my order I don't have to wait more than a few minutes and my food is here. I always get the deep fried spring rolls and on most occasions I get the durian milk shake. What I like most is the option of extra large for big eaters like myself. Now that's what I call filling."}
{"text":"This restaurant is run by Chinese people, who don't speak a word of Vietnamese! Considering it's a Viet restaurant! The food sucks! I ordered rice dish. The fish sauce was off, the meats weren't marinated, it was bland. I never went back and always surprised me when it's packed, full of non Viets. I guess people haven't had authentic Vietnamese food cuz if they did, they wouldn't go to any of the pho 88 chains! 

The pho restaurant up the street at Warden and Steeles is authentic. They're way better than this place. Wouldn't recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place for like years! At least 5 years now! Holy smokes I'm old LOL. Anyways this pho place is good! Definitely not the best pho out there! Although this place opens the latest compared to other pho places in Scarborough and Markham.  

The xl is massive LOL. I usually go for the large because it's a good size! The small is small haha what can I say! Usually only order smalls if I don't feel too hungry. I always get the special and if not, then rare beef and beef brisket! So gooood.... but the rare beef can be a bit tough. You can order beef on the side so hopefully this will make it soft! The drinks are amazing! Love the avocado milkshakes! 

The staff are very friendly! Always greet by a hiiiiii. However it can get very repetitive if you go often... you'll realize it's the same tone toward everyone haha."}
{"text":"BEST PHO IN TOWN :)

Always hits the spot. Very generous, and run by the sweetest family. Ive been going for a while, and I'm always greeted with a smile. You can tell this business has a lot of heart into it, and you can see the work they put in. Always filled with regulars. No wonder they've been in business so long :)

Any pho is a good choice seeing as it always comes out steaming hot. My boyfriend always gets the house special, and I like the spicy satay pho. Both really hearty and filling.

Things to get besides pho: 
-fried spring rolls (#2 on menu)
-milkshakes!, pricey at $3.50, but definitely worth it)

if you're in the area, check this place out, 100% recommend it

Food: 5/5, for a pho restaurant
Service: 4/5"}
{"text":"Came back here and got the rice this time. Went for the pork and chicken since that's my go-to for the rice. Overcooked is all I can say lol. I've gotten this a few times overall and if it's cooked at the right temperature for the right length of time it turns out super tasty. Sometimes it's not fresh and it's like they made it and then just reheated it and served it. This time they cooked it for a bit too long. 

Portion-wise it's pretty good. You get the meat served on top of a generous amount of rice (cooked well), some diced lettuce and carrots and a side of sauce (like a vinaigrette) to pour over your meal. They upped the veggies a tad bit but even more would be nice. Meat flavour is still consistent and good. They just need to work on freshness and cooking it well."}
{"text":"This is our \"go-to\" place for dinner.  Great food. Friendly staff.  They know our faces when we walk in. The service is quick.  Every dish is consistent.  Flavourful pho broth.  Always comes hot and not luke warm.  Only downside to this place is that you can't hear yourself talk.  It is really loud with everyone in there as well as the staff constantly yelling orders and yelling to greet customers.  The seating is very tight.  They have maximized their seating capacity to a point where it has to be against fire regulations.  But still a good place to go for a tasty and affordable meal."}
{"text":"My coworker was celebrating his birthday, and we had considered this place with regards to another coworker. It was such a delight. Yes it was packed but, the food was worth it on a Fall Sunday night. The vermicelli number #216 with the beef was great, the noodles held together awesomely, the beef was seasoned and in great chunks, the broth and sauce suited it well. The second order was the rice dish with beef and chicken, a big bowl of rice, nice tender chicken. My friends and I could eat more, but we saved room for the shakes. The shake that I had was chocolate, it was rich and smooth, it was thick and it was just a great pallet cleanser.

The only confusing part was when one would go to pay, remembering all that you ordered could be hard if you are more then one person.


I shall return."}
{"text":"Got take out from here. I only live a few minutes away so my takeout was still nice and warm! I ordered bbq port and spring roll vermicelli and beef tendon and raw beef pho. The vermicelli was delicious! However the pho did not taste fresh, a lot of the meat was fat ."}
{"text":"Food is ok but service is very bad. The place was messy. The staff are very rude. I try wrap my food for left over. The staff was mad at me . It was very strange."}
{"text":"I love this place

I have tried the following

Regular beef pho - good broth flavour and good ratio of noodles to meat to broth 

Satay beef pho - AMAZING! I always get Extra spicy. Only downfall is it's to oily but idgf it's amazing.

Pad Thai - full of flavour bold flavour !

I eat here 2-3 times a week"}
{"text":"I heard so many people raving about Pho 88 so I had to try it myself. The place definitely has lower prices for Vietnamese food in the area. Ordered a large pho and lemongrass chicken. The pho was alright but the lemongrass chicken was nothing special. The food here was affordable and the food came very quickly. Their vegetable rolls aren't the best.. but I guess the restaurant is known for how cheap their pho is. 

I went to Pho 88 again the week after and ordered take out for this type of noodle soup. While eating it,  I found a rubber band in the soup. Not even sure how it got in the soup in the first place, I guess this restaurant isn't very clean.."}
{"text":"This place is so dirty, seriously plz check the noodle soup before give clients. Bugs. Flies. Eyelash. Hairs everywhere, the worst time I ate there was a toothpick in the noodle soup, a lot of clients saw that too but they still charge me the full price. People, do not go there and spend your money to the dirty food."}
{"text":"Their noodles are so thin and smooth and cooked to perfection. One of the best I've tasted. Price was decent. Got the regular pho. They have it in either XL or L. I got the L for less than $10. Food came in like 2 mins after our orders were placed. They don't give a lot of bean sprouts though. But the food in general was delicious. 

However, the people working there needs some basic manners. There is this one lady in particular who is just so rude. She rammed her cart into our table but didn't say anything and just kept walking. She then proceeded to ram her cart into another table and didn't apologize either. The table next to us got their order and I guess they added a request to their order and was asking her about it and her response was just a dead \"you didn't write it down\" (in Cantonese) and then just walked away. 

I went to pay and because I was there for work, I needed a separate bill for our two orders. The cash lady acted as if it was the most difficult thing she had to do all night because she had to separate our bill. Barely made eye contact with me even when handing me my receipts. I could not wait to get out of there. I just hate how we're still required to tip even after crappy service. They need to know that service matters because they can forget about me going back there. Hence, the two stars."}
{"text":"Parking - Free: Very big lot but it's usually packed and hard to find parking on a weekend.

Queue: This place is very VERY busy, majority of the time I've never had to wait to be seated but rarely it would be so packed you might have to wait a few minutes before getting a seat.

Bathrooms: Barely passing grade.

Venue: It's like a cafeteria style setting where you may end up being seated next to another group of people. Walkways are narrow and the place is okay in terms of cleanliness. This is actually the part where it's losing points because it's not up to my level of standard in terms of cleanliness. 

My cousin calls it \"The Best Pho in Town\", as this place has won awards for it's food. My friends and I use to be regulars here for the past couple of years, now we go to a different Pho place to get our fill. The Pho is really good and reasonably priced, as a vegetarian you can order the special pho that comes in a coconut/peanut broth with Tofu instead of meat. It's the only Pho place that I know that serves something like that. The avocado shakes are very good here too.

I cannot in good conscious end this review without mentioning an incident that occurred while dining there one night. My friends and I were sitting a table away from a mother and son couple who were seated right next to the drink bar. The co-owner of the Pho restaurant tipped over and spilled coke all over the boy and his mother his phone and clothes were soaked and the mothers jacket got hit. The co-owner (the lady without the glasses), handled the situation very poorly, things got heated and she kicked them out even though they did nothing wrong.

What should've happened was, the meal should've been on the house, and they should've offered to pay for dry cleaning. Instead now they lost 2 loyal customers. So that's part of the service review. If the other owner were present (the sister with the glasses) I'm sure she would've handled it better."}
{"text":"I was so disappointed... I ordered a drink that supposed to have red bean, yellow bean and green jelly. When the drink came I only saw red bean and jelly. I asked the lady and she asked me to stir the drink and look for it. she is sure it has yellow bean. I stir for for a while and saw one little yellow dot. The lady said, see I told you it has yellow bean... this drink is $0.5 more than the drink that just has red bean & jelly. So I pay $0.5 for a dot of yellow bean? I would never order this again at this place. 

Also the peanut soup base was so watery now compare to before. I know their service was not good as I visited this place from time to time in over 10 years. But now their food quality was much lower compare to before. Does anyone know why? May be change of ownership or something?"}
{"text":"Best pho I've ever had in my life! And im talking about the Peanut&Coconut pho! I highly recommend this soup! Please try it! Its awesome! LoL!"}
{"text":"Located inside the Bambourgh circle plaza,  this place is neatly tucked away.   As you walk in,  you will notice nothing special about this place.  It is your typical Vietnamese Pho restaurant to get Pho.  Prices are reasonable.   Nothing really outstanding or memorable.   Great place to just fill up your tummy."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years and it is still my favourite place for pho. The satay spicy beef noodle soup is my favourite item. Make sure to bring a friend to share the spring rolls. 

The staff are great, quick service and friendly.  One of the best restaurants in the area, and I'm my opinion the best pho outside of Hanoi."}
{"text":"This place used to be so much better. I used to come here all the time, but first time coming back in probably 3 years... it wasn't good. 

The soup is very salty now and I had to drink a lot of water that night when i got home. They also used to give you a lot more meat. Theres also only 2 people when every table was occupied, so service is spotty. Overall, i would probably not come back again, which is a shame."}
{"text":"Got my usual order of rare beef pho. The pho itself was okay but I got a little surprise in my bean sprout dish. The lime wedge had teeth marks all over it and it was clearly used. I was abhorred to find them \"recycling\" the bean sprout dish. When I confronted the waitress, she had the audacity to lie and said it was bad slicing by the cook. I pointed out that I saw teeth mark. She didnt even apologize. Urgh never going there ever again."}
{"text":"I was really tempted to give this 1 star but based on the food, I'll leave one extra star. 
Let me start by saying I've been here dozens of times back in my high school days where we'd drive up here for a late dinner or a cheap weekend meal. The XL pho with everything in it (I think 101 or 102) is around $7 and more than enough for myself and one of my girl friends as well. The pho here is consistent but a bit too salty in my opinion. I've also been to the Pho 88 on Spadina near my university and I'd say the flavours are pretty much identical. I do prefer the latter location no question. 
Fast forward to two years later, Pho 88 on Bamburg was the location my group of 4 decided on last weekend and the experience was very off-putting. I never noticed the service much but that night, we were treated so horribly. First, we had asked for a table near the windows that had 4 seats and 2 tables put together but were denied and told that table only seats 2 ( uhm what?). The waitress, if she should even be called that, forced us into 2 tables shoved between 2 other tables, very awkward. Also, the waitresses had very bad English and only 1 friend could communicate with them as the rest of us don't speak Cantonese. However, as there is an order form, there isn't much need to make small talk.
We ordered the usual, I chose a 103 small -- the usual. The bowls of noodles came out fast and hot but servers were barely present and when they were, they looked so miserable that it put a damper on my mood. When we paid the bills, we were shouted at across the register and left in a hurry. I still tipped but probably never returning."}
{"text":"My favourite pho place! Hardest working staff you'll find in the Markham area! Food comes quick, and it's hot and delicious! Always open late and always busy but the turn over is quick so you never have to wait long."}
{"text":"Good unique tasting soup. Good prices (e.g. $9.10 for an XL size bowl). Good quality meats. Good amount of seating + parking. Good (enough) + fast service. 

Go for: super duper large bowl of pho

Don't go for: fine dining, vermicelli bowls"}
{"text":"The pho is usually pretty flavourful but lately I've found the broth to be lukewarm at best. They also seem to be skimping out on toppings.

Restaurant doesn't appear very clean but that's usually to be expected in pho restaurants. Service is always quite fast.

The cashier lady who also makes the drinks is extremely rude which really makes me not want to come. Not only does she seem to charge whatever she wants (always check your bill), but also really has some attitude. She always treats you as if you owe her big money. Once she gave me the bill at the register and as I was paying, she started dealing with another customer, and so when I started walking away, she shouted that I dined and dashed so loudly that a couple tables turned to stare. Uncalled for -  no apology and just rolled her eyes when I pointed to the money."}
{"text":"The duck noddle soup is the best here. And their bowls of  Pho are huge. Their Hu Tieu soup was average, so I took away a star. Serve was good. Would eat there again."}
{"text":"the pho taste has changed. the beef and broth tastes like its rotten or about to go bad. i order an extra large bowl of beef brisket pho for my wife and i. when we received the bill, they charged us extra 50 cents for sharing a bowl of noodle with my wife. also the bill was calculated in a way where they were ripping me off by an extra 50 cents. people please please chekc the bill and stop overtipping these people because they are already getting extra money by charging you extra money."}
{"text":"Bad service. The waitress are so rude. Restaurant looks old and very dirty....One thing is very important before you eat. Utensil MUST check and wash ????

Also. Check the bill before you pay... They will Over charged????"}
{"text":"This seems to be one of the favourite pho places in Scarborough.  Been here a few times.  The soup is tasty and the food comes in fresh.  This place is always busy when I go there.  The wait staff gets your seat fast, serves you quickly despite it being very busy.  There's a reason why so many people like this place, food and service are top notch.  Been there 5 to 6 times, and the service is always consistent, this is how a restaurant should be run."}
{"text":"This resto is super busy during dinner time with a shortage of workers. It took a while to get our orders and if you need extra sauce, good luck getting the server's attention. 

When we finally got our orders, I look at the Nem Noung (Vietnamese pork meat ball) and I was dumb founded. Never have I ever got an order of Vietnamese meat ball deep fried in my 20 years of eating Vietnamese food. I decided to just try it out anyways and I wasn't a fan.  Deep fried should be save for spring rolls, not meat balls. Also the meat wasn't the freshest. 

When the bill finally arrived (after waiting for 15 mins), while we were still paying,  the waitress took the tray from us. As an result, we didn't give enough tip and an older lady (probably the owner) walked back with the change in the tray and told us to give more tips in a really loud voice. It was so embarrassing!  I explained the situation to her and she immediately proceed to the waitress and started yelling at her in front of all the customers!"}
{"text":"Quick, efficient, and delicious. The food does not get any better than this. By far my favourite pho place. The food is always on point, and I am NEVER disappointed.

The longest you'd ever have to wait is probably 5 minutes to get your food. On average, I'd say 3 minutes. I'm not kidding about how fast the service is. I've been coming to this pho for over 10 years now and it has not changed one bit. The turnover must be intense because this place always has customers.

However, it is not the cleanliest place. They use dirty dish cloths to clean the counters and it leaves that unmistakable dirty washcloth smell. The service is mediocre, pretty much ladies who just want to get your order done and over with (I have no problem with this, so long as I get my food fast!). This is the reason they only get 4 stars.

I usually get #114 beef ball noodle soup -- delicious. And my next favourite is #66 vermicelli with porkballs and meat. By far the best dish ever if you're not craving pho. Seriously would recommend it -- make sure you pour the sweet sauce all over! The springrolls are deliciously deep-fried and well portioned. The rice paper rolls are even better, especially topped with the peanut sauce that makes you want to quadruple dip. And the mango milkshake?! Trust me, order it and you will be dreaming about it later on.

Portions are generous! Small sized is equivalent to what a medium would be at a pho downtown plus a bit more noodles AND cheaper. 

One other downside? Once you leave the restaurant you and your clothes will reek of pho. I suggest going to eat before a shower, since the smell permeates the air and absorbs into your skin.

No other pho can ever compare to this jewel (so long as you're there for just the food)."}
{"text":"great vermicelli and pho. Actually pretty much everything is really good there. Can't give it 5 because it is rather a dirty place but the food is cheap and amazing!"}
{"text":"Never in my life have I been so hungry and so disappointed. Usually when your hungry everything taste amazing well my hunger tastebuds definitely didn't kick in today. 

My boyfriend and I frequently go out for pho (pho mi 99) when we are in my area. We decided to go out for pho in his area and I found pho mi 88 on my yelp app. Mind you, I have been to many pho establishments and I know they are not all equal and I know the one close to my house is probably my favourite so I expected it to be good but not amazing. Boy was I wrong.

My chicken had a lot of hair and straw on it. I'm assuming they pound up lemon grass and use it to marinate the meat but seriously it doesn't look appetizing on your chicken. I've had grilled chicken a numerous amount of times with lemon grass flavour sans straws. The chicken hairs are attractive either. I'm hoping they were all chicken hairs because one was a little longer than the rest. Some of my chicken and dry parts. Honestly the meat looked a day old. The fried rice was made with no love, the only vegetables I found in it were the carrots. I payed 1.75x2 to upgrade to fried rice to steam rice. Waste of 3 dollars and 50 cents.

My boyfriend  isn't super picky and e even said he wouldn't go back. He actually didn't even finish his food and he eats everything on his plate! Thanks for my disappointing meal. My highlight was my mango smoothie (but I've had better)"}
{"text":"Came here on a Monday night around 9pm. The place was about 3/4 full. Our waiter didn't give us any problems. We asked for water and the waiter brought it right away. I got the rare beef (115) and my cousin got the special (270). 

Portion size was generous especially considering the price. Taste of the soup was better than other pho places I have been too. 

The place isn't the cleanest, could do with some renovations and a cleaner/fresh look. 

We waiting for our bills to come, we didn't realize we had to get up and pay at the front. Overall not too bad, would come back again if I'm around the area."}
{"text":"Pho 88 is a great viet restaurant with variety of great dishes include Pho, pork steaks and more.
The Pho88 has one of the most tasty soup base in scarborough.
Fast service, and quality is what makes this restaurant sell 

only problem is during rush hours and dinner service they want you to leave asap

affordable and great food
 check it out if you are ever in scarborough"}
{"text":"Keep it simple and just order pho, anything else is gambling with a dish's consistency.

Pricing and service are reasonable but for the love of god, just come here and get pho."}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favourite places to go for pho! They have a spicy peanut beef noodle soup (item #270) that is out of this world!!! Their regular rare beef pho is pretty good but in my opinion, it's comparable to most Vietnamese pho restaurants.

It's normal pho noodles in a rich and creamy peanut and coconut soup. Super delicious! It's not very spicy either. I would say mild and maybe mild-moderate at its worse. There is a fair amount of beef but most of it isn't in slices, it was sort of like shredded lumps of beef??? I might be making it sound worse than it is. I didn't get sick from it and I tight it was fine. Depends on your preference. All pho noodle soups congee with a side dish of bean sprouts, lime and basil??? I believe that's what the leafy greens are. I might be wrong so don't quote me on it. It's for you to soak/cook in your pho soup. 

They're open late on weekends so it's a good place to grab pho after a night out."}
{"text":"Pretty standard pho place. Can't really go wrong here unless there is a long wait for a table.
I'm pretty picky with pho because my mom's home cooked pho is the freaking bomb so usually when I go to a pho place I'll order something different.
At this location, I usually get rice with 2 chicken cutlets, rice with 1 pork 1 chicken cutlet, both with a fried egg add-on, or braised beef stew rice noodle soup.
Always have to get an avocado shake. Tastes just like how I make it at home."}
{"text":"Went back to Toronto this time and had to come here again. The Special Super 88 spicy noodle is as good as I remembered it, and their pork chop rice was better than i remembered it. I wish they had one in Boston :("}
{"text":"This place has become a staple of scarborough in my opinion. Definitely a go to place when every other place has closed. But it isn't a last resort. The beef broth is actually pretty good in my opinion. Although their beef tendon and other toppings are not up to bar, the soup itself makes up for it. Also service is pretty quick so it's a nice quick meal with friends when you're hungry at night."}
{"text":"The service here is always very quick, the food never disappoints, and I love the way they always say \"hiiii\" whenever someone walks in. I always go here and I recommended getting the #270 (Spicy peanut coconut pho)"}
{"text":"My fave pho place in Toronto! Expect to come out smelling like their yummy pho, though, my hair always does. Always always always get the small 88 special pho, and fastest service ever ! In and out within 30 min.  Only gripe is the decor, or lack of."}
{"text":"Decisions, decisions, decisions... There are so many items to choose from then you have to choose the size it comes in.  For me, I make life simple, XL House Special.  Hits the spot every time and very consistent, never been disappointed in the food offering.  The seating situation feels like you are at a communal feeding station as you sit so close to each other and with the big steaming bowls of noodles over head, I am surprised or maybe I have not heard of any accidents to date.  Also be warned of the parking lot as the drivers there seem to drive any which way as long ad its their way mentality."}
{"text":"We have been going to this spot for a couple of years now.  It is an established eatery in the scarborough area.  It has all the required criteria of a good pho restautant, good food, decent price and good portion sizes.  On this night we ordered viet spring rolls, beef pho, and pork chops with rice.

Viet spring rolls: very good portion size, crunchy on the outside and flavourful filling

Beef pho: the broth was really good, noodles were perfect and decent amount of thinly sliced beef

Pork chop with rice: good flavour on the pork chops 

When Pho 88 opened up in Scarborough there wasnt much pho places to pick from, but now there are so much pho restaurants scattered around.  But they have managed to stay in business for this long. So that is a testament to their success."}
{"text":"Pho 88 Vietnamese Restaurant is like a Pho institution in Scarborough... Everyone I know been to it... and as a Pho \"Queen\" I have yet to pay a visit.

This afternoon I was in a rush.. and want something quick fast and cheap.. and since I never have a bowl of Pho at this restaurant, all I go!!

The parking here can just be a nightmare... with the busy Supermarket.. and driving in and out of the lot can be a stressful experience!

Only a few tables occupied on this Friday afternoon.. I was never given a menu.. maybe they think I know what I want?? The order sheets are hiding underneath the table.. so I just picked my usual.......while the waiter looking over my shoulders.

Pho with Rare Beef, Cook Beef and Tripes ($5.99) M
- It took awhile to arrive to the table... a lot longer than I would have suspect because the place is not busy and just a Pho??
- The soup I am glad was deceiving hot! the bean sprouts all tenderly cooked by the time I start eating
- MSG? Maybe.. but it is a good MSG... because I like it! :) good flavour.. salty enough for the noodle but too salty to drink on its own
- Noodle though is not the fresh type.. but was cooked properly, so don't have that funny taste!
- Beef, plenty of Beef.. (no one is going to ask me \"Where is the Beef?\") 

Not the best Pho I have, but I have to say it really hit the spot!! When I was walking to my car after stuffing myself, I feel nice and warm in my tummy.. that's always a good sign!"}
{"text":"I come to this place very very often and it's pretty much a go to pho place for me. If you're looking for a good late night snack, this is the place! I live very close so it's really convenient. I don't come here just for convenience, i come here for the awesome cheap pho and fast service. Sometimes they serve us so fast it's mind blowing, literally under 5 minutes even when it's packed (which it usually is) you'll never find it fully empty even at 11 PM. This place is pretty big and fits a good amount of people, groups including. 

If you have two people, I always just get their special XL and it's enough to feed both of us. The deep fried spring is also amazing, it's really crunchy and full of flavor. The service is really good too. They are always so attentive and fast. They might not always have a smile on their face but they're efficient! They give you tea pots so you don't have to ask to fill it all the time.
I'm taking off one star because this place isn't always the cleanest, I wouldn't trust their utensils (use the takeout chopsticks) but I haven't had food poisoning yet lol"}
{"text":"Not so good... The food is mediocre. Lots of MSG in the soups... The staff are rude and don't even know how to speak English. The place is loud and you cannot even hear your friend speak in front of you. The place is packed and it's hard to get spots. I've been there at least 100 times in my life and the only reason I go there is because of the decent value and prices for the volume you get."}
{"text":"Been coming here for about 6-7 years. Found it once with my Dad. The soups I get are always 'on-point' with seasoning and the owners always say hello. I Love coming to eat here either when I am alone or trying to convert someone to Pho lol. Only times I ever had complaint is when I had to stand in line to get seats...but it's well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Pho 88 is my go-to Viet place in the neighbourhood! It's in the same plaza as Foody Mart, which sometimes make parking a real pain.

Other than the parking issue, this place is perfect for a cheap, satisfying meal. The broth is great, and the noodles are nicely cooked (I can't stand soggy pho!). I also really like their spring rolls, which are delightfully crispy. Once, I put in the wrong order on paper (I copied down the wrong number for my spring rolls), but the staff was nice enough to change the order, even after the food has been made.

I highly recommend this place for cheap eats!"}
{"text":"Just went here for lunch earlier under the assumption that some of my friends were here (they weren't BTW).

Although this is still the best place for pho that I have been to.  It the dish itself still suffers from high MSG content.  I told the owner that was the reason I didn't come to the restaurant for a while.

I am not sure whether I got used to having that much MSG in my system again or not, or whether it was because of the 88 Special Iced Coffee Shake but I didn't really hit the MSG drowsiness this time around.

I got my usual #109 with beef on the side and chicken soup (to do this change write TR and chicken soup).  As usual I got small, since I don't want to feel too stuffed.  The main thing I like about this restaurant is consistency, and the food quality has been quite consistent since the first time I went here many many years ago.

In addition I got the 88 Iced Coffee Shake, this was the first time I tried this.  It's good, not \"super duper fall in love\" good, but still good.

Mind you although I normally eat the usual pho.  I would be amiss to not tell the \"normal stuff I like\" here just because I don't come here too often.  They are (based on vague descriptions):

* Shrimp on sugar cane
* Shredded pork and shrimp wrap (non-fried)
* Jack fruit shake
* Sour sop shake
* The complicated looking, drippy coffee with condensed milk and ice
* Steam egg, fried egg, rice, grilled chicken with some orange sauce (I'm usually too cheap to get this one)"}
{"text":"The Best.  

I've been coming here for years, especially since it's right around the corner of my high school.  Convenience and my taste buds aside though, I knew this place was the real deal when Vietnamese people would recommend it to me (after I already knew about this place though).

Their soup base is delicious.  The noodles are great.  They are also the only restaurant I know that offers the \"crisp brisket\", which my family loves.  I love their regular pho as well as the tomato & five spice brisket pho.

The rice platters are also amazing.  A lot of Vietnamese places serve really dry grilled meat - this place is moister than most.  I always get the pork and chicken chops with an egg on top.

Prices are also reasonable, even after several price raises, although to be honest, portions have gotten much smaller over the years.

Also, please note that this place is the Vietnamese equivalent to a greasy spoon.  The tables and some of the utensils are kinda sticky.  But foodists like me won't care that much if the food is good, which it is here."}
{"text":"The pho here is awesome! I ask for extra tendon and they gave me half a bag full! The only thing that sucks about this place is the parking it's in the grocery Asian market place so parking is really bad!"}
{"text":"My favourite Vietnamese place! Owner is really load but aside that food is really good try special pho88 and fresh fried spring rolls! Well priced! Busy! Load! Quick food 
Worth the visit even if take out!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what the big deal about this place is.  I have been here more than a handful of times because of my friends.

The spring rolls are soft and chewy (no not the fresh ones... the deep fried ones.)   The fresh rolls have no flavour and they seem to always use wilted lettuce in them.   The beef pho broth has a weird taste to it - I can't seem to pin it down.   

The service is terrible and the woman at the front cash is obnoxious and rude whether you sit in or take-out.

I think I've been spoiled at Golden Turtle downtown.   

I don't see any reason to go to this place unless a famine hits.   Honestly speaking, I'd rather get a pack of mcnuggets."}
{"text":"SO, after my first review I got a note from fellow Yelper, Chris T., to ask for fresh noodles in the pho. I'm thinking \"Do I really just ask them for fresh noodles?\" It's not written anywhere in their menu but ok.... 

My mom was craving pho last week so it gave me the perfect chance to suggest going to Pho 88. We ordered fresh shrimp roll, deep fried spring rolls, the special platter of stuff (where you have to basically make your own rolls), and two bowls of pho. We asked if there were different types of noodles available and it turns out that there are indeed fresh noodles!

I didn't know if I would be able to tell the difference, but we all definitely could. The fresh noodles have a better chew/texture to them. Thanks, Chris! 

The make your own rolls is cool. They give you the dry rice paper. a plate of noodles/meat/veggies and a shallow dish of warm water. I've done it many times at home before. They got water onto the plate w the dry wrappers.. all the wrappers kinda stuck together and it was hard to take them apart w/o tearing a hole. Then wrapping just gets a bit messier w a hole in the wrapper.

Aside from the pho, I love their fried veggie spring rolls and shakes. And one more note, they've replaced their grimy old falling apart menus w new ones :D"}
