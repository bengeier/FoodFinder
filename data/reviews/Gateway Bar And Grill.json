{"text":"BRETT!!!!!  It's your favorite person EVER - Kimmy!!!  What time are you opening for the Tribe's Home Opener?!?!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stopped in to grab a bite before the Cavs game last night. It was rainy and cold and I didn't feel like walking far, which is why we chose to eat here, literally across from the Q. Definitely glad we did. Super classy, but relaxed atmosphere. Food was quick, delicious, and plentiful. Tyrone was our server and was literally one of the best servers we've ever had. Will be returning, for sure."}
{"text":"Don't do it unless you have to. Asked for the bartenders to turn on a game(nine tvs are playing a cavs game, they are losing by 20).
They \"lost the remote.\" If Lebron James, Jose Mesa, and  John Elway were bar tending they would easily have a remote handy."}
{"text":"SECEN WORDS: Many Missed Oppotunities / Great Food Gone Wrong.

When we travel to Cleveland, one or two meals are always in order. We recently discovered the joy of staying in Cleveland after a Cavs game instead of driving back to Columbus and dealing with post-game traffic. Thank you Gateway Radisson for being so Close to the Q!

That being said, we tried out their restaurant, \"The Gateway Bar and Grill and were less enthusiastic.

We both preferred the NY Strip Medium Rare with Garlic Mashed Potatoes and Green Beans.

The meals came out around 10 minutes later, but absolutely everything was cold. I know beans are finicky with staying hot, but mashed potatoes and meat are not.

We sent both n.a.co and both came back lukewarm to cold. The waitress *DID* ask us to cut and bite, but both were still likewarm when they returned - as was our reaction - I decided to eat my steak cold, but only eat about one-third of our meals.

The bill was $55 plus tip and even though we went to our hotel room to reheat and eat our meals, we were quite disappointed.

Its too bad; hot meals could be easily rendered this meal a 4 or even a 5.

I'd be hard-pressed to give Gateway a chance aeat there again."}
{"text":"Great beer selection. Conveniently located steps away from Progressive Field and The Q. Plenty of TV's and awesome food."}
{"text":"Was just in the area and had dinner, table got mac & cheese app, pasta dish and grilled chicken sandwich, onion rings. Everything was good. Kind of like a sports bar and grill but a little fancier than normal (new place, modern look). Great service."}
{"text":"Great food (quesadilla and burger), good pour on the wine and a super server (Ty).  AND multiple TVs to catch the NCAA games.  I almost hate to post this as this is one of Cleveland's best kept secrets.  Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Gateway has come under new management and its a totally different deal. Its an awesome place to visit and enjoy your drinks. Mike the bartender is one of the nicest person you can come across along with Kevin who is the manager and makes sure that you are comfortable and enjoying the moment. The foods great and you're going to live this place. You have to be here every game day for sure."}
{"text":"Bought a groupon for $5 (for a $20 gift certificate) and it still was not worth it at all. Impossible to get someone on the phone to order for pick up. Was placed on hold two separate times indefinitely. Even if we had managed to contact them, prices are out of proportion to product. Would not go here again even for free."}
{"text":"Honestly this is my go-to spot for before or after Cavs and Indians games. It's a great spot to have a few drinks, get some food and have a good time. It's a lot cheaper than  Clevelander and City Tap, and you won't have to deal with an overcrowded bar!

The bartenders are the absolute best here. Neal and Mike are probably the best bartenders in Cleveland. I absolutely love this place!"}
{"text":"My family and I went here before a Cavs game (4 adults and 4 kids) We intentionally went for an early dinner to not feel rushed and were sat right away. Our server was great. I needed an ATM and he walked me over to the hotel lobby which was great. There were only a few tables occupied when we got there. We ordered rather quickly and then it kind of went down hill after that. Our food probably took close to an hour and all came out at different times. One meal was made incorrectly- and because of an allergy had to be sent back. However, because it took so long we just had them take off of bill. Another meal came when we were finishing up our meals. Fortunately with kids they were able to share. They said they would take that Neal off the tab and box it up because we needed to leave for the game. Well, they ended up charging us. They eventually took it off but the manager (I assume) didn't seem thrilled about it. Our server told us they were backed up in the kitchen and we overheard him telling another server they only had 2 people back there. All in all, the food was fine, our server was great but they don't seem to have the operations side of things. I understand when your short staffed but other than our server, no one else on staff seemed to have much urgency to get things done. Great location so if you're going to check it out- give yourself plenty of time. We got there at 4:30 for a 7:00 game and spent most of our time waiting for food."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed in this restaurant. My boyfriend and I were staying at the Radisson, next door, and we were going to order room service. Little did we know that the kitchen closed at 9pm. Who closes their kitchen at 9pm on a Saturday, especially in downtown Cleveland. 

The next day, my boyfriend and I got breakfast there, before we went home. We were also disappointed in that. They only offered a breakfast buffet. I got a bagel and wanted it toasted. The toaster wasn't even working. My boyfriend's food wasn't even hot."}
{"text":"My nephew and I picked a Sunday night with no games in town so the bar was quiet and we sat at the bar.  This was the final of \"Battle Bots\" and two other places we had visited that night refused to turn to that channel so we walked into this place.  When asked to turn one of their HD TV's to the finals they were happy to do so and so we placed our orders.  
    I don't eat meat so in order to give a total review my dinner night included my nephew who loves sports bar wings and is a great chief in his own right.  He ordered wings and onion rings and I wanted to taste the Lake Erie Walleye grilled and a house salad which I should have added shrimp to but forget this time.  My nephew noted that the onion ring batter had some sugar added to it which make diners have to finish the entire order because they are tasty treats.  His review of the wings were that they were better than any others he has tried downtown CLE.  My Lake Erie Walleye was a tasty change of pace for me as a filet because I normally love boned fish.  The lovely chief served the food to the bar and with the \"Battle Bots\" finals it was a fantastic night for a geek like myself and my sports loving nephew and we will be back again because the bartender and staff treated us like kings.  Bravo! #44112News"}
{"text":"Today me and my wife went here before the Indians home opener.  So being that it was busy, we expected to wait a little bit. Well wait a little bit was an understatement.  We waited 20 min to get a table.  It took what appeared to be the only server working about 10 minutes to come greet us if you call walking up and saying \"what do you want\" a greeting.  My wife was a little taken back, she is a server herself and gives the benefit of the doubt, so we ordered our drinks fast and a nachos as an appetizer.  When we got my coke and her bud light in a bottle 10 min after ordering it, we hurried and ordered our food figuring we needed to get our food order in quick and while our server was around.  It took about 45 min to get chicken tenders, fries, and a salad.  We never got the nachos appetizer and when we let our server know this she stated, \"I can put a rush on them\". We politely declined.  The salad came with bacon on it, though the menu did not say it came with bacon.  As well the lettuce looked like they went out back and grabbed the crappiest greens you could find off the nearest bush.  The chicken tenders made McDonald's chicken nuggets look 5 star.  The fries  were soggy and gross.  Disappointed, we hurried and paid and went to the Indians game and got $18 nachos there, but at least we got them.  They knew the Indian's opener would draw a crowd and should of been better staffed. I will say the hostess was busting her butt and was very nice.  The manager never came to our table to ask how our food was, though he had to of walked by 10 times.  In addition,  we watched our server put a dirty tray down on tables that were occupied and pass out drinks to guest at other tables.  She did this with food as well.  And when she refilled my wife's water she sat some other persons ice tea refill down on our table before giving to the proper person.  Just things better run places and servers wouldn't do.  Pretty sad random strangers apologized for coming in after us and were able to get and eat there food and leave before we got ours.  And this stranger was a restaurant manager and said our server was very unorganized and seemed very confused."}
{"text":"We had dinner here before the Cavs game last night. Although I'd emailed on their webpage for reservations, it was never answered. The manager was immediately apologetic and had a table for 6 right away.

Food wasn't anything inventive, but it was solid and quite tasty for all of us. There were 3 Game Day burgers, a fried walleye sandwich, a BLT wrap, and a chicken caesar salad. Portions were quite large, and their fresh-cut fries are peppery and very good.

Service was very good without being at all overbearing or cutesy, and they are directly across the street from The Q -- great location."}
{"text":"First time in Cleveland. After we got seated and ordered, we realized this is the Radisson Hotels restaurant. I ordered the burger medium/well. I believe it was a frozen burger which came on a wanna be pretzel like bun. I would rate my meal a 1 star. My son got the herb roasted chicken which he really enjoyed. Definately overpriced."}
{"text":"Really surprised at this find. The wings were fantastic, and the atmosphere is really nice. Drinks were well crafted and poured with a heavy hand. My wife got a quesadilla which was really good and our friend got nachos which also didn't disappoint. The beer selection is really ggod as well. Service was awesome! Will definitely come back here and grab some wings!"}
{"text":"Worst experience ever... it took over 20 minutes to finally get our DRINKS!!!! And we got 2 waters, iced tea, and a pepsi!!! luckily we ordered our food and drinks at the same time or we would have waited additional 40 minutes to order!!! Our food came out within 5 minutes of the drinks. I ordered the gateway salad and asked what dressings came with the salad and she had no idea. I specifically wanted to gateway salad because it had pork belly on it. When the gentleman came out with the food, he said side salad so I asked if that was the pork salad and he said yes. I looked at the salad and there was no pork. I told the server and she argued with me saying the other salad had pork on it. I then asked to see a menu and then showed her where it says pork, then she says \"oh yeah we're out of pork\" so I said yeah that would have been nice to know as I was ordering.. I then said I'll just take the chicken tenders with honey mustard. She literally left and came back in 45 seconds with an order of chicken tenders that were semi warm and tastes like they have been sitting out for an hour under the heat lamps... terrible terrible time here I would NEVER  recommend!"}
{"text":"Good, Not quite a 4, but didn't want to give a 3. The bartender was awesome, the space and tvs were nice, food was great for American! 

Fries could've used more seasoning!

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food. Seemed like a dive from the outside nothing fancy. Then you go in the doors. Very quaint. Loved the server. Will def go back. Will tell my friends. Really really have to experience!!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is nice and classy here, especially for an American bar and grill. The staff are incredibly nice and helpful as well. However, I have this place only three stars because of the quality of their food. Fries were a bit too soggy and under seasoned for my liking. The hoagie that I ordered was just okay - a little bland. 

I probably would recommend a friend here only for the experience of the atmosphere - not for the food!"}
{"text":"In town for long weekend and bought Groupon sight unseen. We were the only ones there on a late Sunday night. Food was good. Burger and chicken sandwich served on yummy pretzel rolls. Homemade chips were a good option. Bartender/Waiter was attentive but not pushy considering he was closing after we left."}
{"text":"Came here while staying at the hotel. Good food selection for a bar. Drinks were fairly reasonable and a huge selection. Would recommend to anyone going to the Q or to progressive field."}
{"text":"Food was terrible for the price. $16 for a burger and the patty tasted frozen, the bun is harder than a rock. Overall for the price the food is terrible"}
{"text":"Service is terrible! Never came back to give us more coffee or ask how the food was! Food was gross!!! Buffet had very minimal choices and the food was cold! There was a bug in one of our waters too. The hotel is nice but do not bother eating here! A walk to anywhere else will definitely be worth it, trust me!"}
{"text":"If you regularly attend Cavs games at the Quicken Loans Arena or Indians games at Progressive Field you probably walked right by the Gateway Bar and Grill and you should stop in. This is a nice little pub-like place near the athletic centers...one block from the Indians and 200 feet from the Cavs. The bar and grill is hooked up to the Radisson Hotel and on some hotel packages you get free breakfast...which is offered here.

We had the breakfast buffet and it was very nice. All the regular fare...eggs and sausage and bacon along with a half dozen different cereals. Toast and muffins are also provided. Choice of juices and lots of coffee fill in the dry spots. All the food was fresh and warm. We enjoyed the buffet and it is the perfect spot to kick off your morning adventures.

We did not have a chance to drop in at night for libations or dinner but if they are anything like breakfast we are sure they are a more than serviceable offering. If location is important and a nice place with ambiance and good food counts...this just might be your spot. Give it a try when in the Gateway District."}
{"text":"Went there after Disney on Ice at the Q.  A really nice place with unexceptional, overpriced food.  The hand cut fries are nothing special.  Our waiter was great and attentive.   Three adults and one 7 yr old ate for $67.  Items are priced $12 - 13 for a sandwich plate.  No kids menu so $12 for children tenders.  My bad, I picked the place,  should have gone to Arby's with the kid.  Got a good IPA for $5.50 though.  Not bad.  Tipped $10 so bill came close to $80.  Wife and I could have had quite a meal on that"}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in after an Indians game.  We're from Columbus, so we just wanted something close to the field.  We ordered appetizers, which were very good and came out quickly.  Nice relaxed classy atmosphere."}
{"text":"One server, one bartender and one chef was not anywhere near enough to serve this small venue. Most of the food was quite overdone. At least 10 parties left without being seated in the course of 90 minutes that we waited for our food. Don't bother!!!"}
{"text":"Went here for the breakfast buffet, would definitely take a pass next time.  Scrambled eggs were terrible and not much of a selection of anything.  Sausage was all burnt. The fruit that was there was in a small bowl. The buffet just wasn't good.  And the service there was very poor and slow.  We asked for refills of our drinks and the waitress wasn't pleasant about assisting us at all.  It's a decent size city, find another breakfast nook!"}
{"text":"Classy, clean and reasonable. The menu is diverse without being weird. They have game day specials and many tvs. But I wouldn't describe this as a sports bar. Very versatile."}
{"text":"TJ is a good waiter.

Don't order the fajitas, not worth the time or money.  They should stick with bar food"}
{"text":"Currently sitting at the table. Our server has not even been seen and we had not been acknowledged for about 10 minutes. It's so bad that a server who isn't in our section apologized grabbed our drinks, told our server, but then also got our food order. It is a Sunday at 1:30 in the afternoon with a total of about 4 tables."}
