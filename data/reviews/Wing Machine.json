{"text":"The staff are hit or miss. One or two of the guys are nice, the rest seem to absolutely hate it there. 
I (used to) grab slices from here because I live close and it's cheap, but I found every second time I did, I got really Ill afterwords.  I can only speak for the veggie or cheese slices, but if THATS giving me food poisoning, I'd be really afraid of touching any meat product here. Something is wrong with the food in this place.  You're also surrounded by mirrors inside, and I often find myself looking into them asking myself what fuck I'm doing eating there again."}
{"text":"Great wings, great ribs...

Get 10 x 2 liter bottles of pepsi delivered to your door as you're too tired from working all the time to carry them... ah well... they said they would. Thanks guys...

Their honey garlic wings are sticky and good... nice pizza box... very asthetically pleasing and practical in the fridge.. it fits.. thanks.

The ribs... fall off the bone delicious... Swiss Chalet, your ribs are dry and well not so good... edible but why..  you could learn something from wing machine about rib cooking technique...

Wanted rib recipe fit for eating in restaurants... tell all the rib places about it... if its new... make sure you get a royalty...

Cheers
Andrew

{"text":"Great freaking wings!!!  Ribs were fall off the bone and but size but not dry. VERY flavorful ribs."}
{"text":"I actually enjoyed the food I ordered there was really good tasting.. A bit oily however. The service was fine. I would come here for fast food again. As it's quite greasy not all the time however."}
{"text":"I love jerk style wings! Kinda spicy but really yummy! I cannot stop once I start. They are the best all over the world!"}
{"text":"Never again.
I paid 30 bucks for the Wings and Ribs Combo.  The wings were undercooked and almost felt raw, and the ribs tasted like they were boiled.  
I could only muster up the strength to eat 5 wings, and then the disappointment took over and forced me to put the crappy food aside.

If you ever find me considering eating from this place again....please cut my fingers off.

Im so pissed right now.
I hate WIng Machine."}
{"text":"This too is a delivery review but I won't even comment on the delivery itself and do always expect my food to be not as good when delivered.

The issue with this order was that EVERYTHING was undercooked. A whole order of wings non-edible, poutine el dente (ick!)and chicken fingers that I barely ate and really hope they don't make me sick.

Overall I would avoid this place in future."}
{"text":"We were very excited about the prospect of wings tonight and turned to yelp.  Sure enough: wing machine delivers.  The wings unfortunately were disappointing.  The were small, dry and tasted a little rubbery.  For the price - $48 before tip - (assuming 1.5lbs/person and fries) there are far better wings to be had in the city.  We had a handful each and tossed the rest."}
{"text":"Most recently I noticed a change. I frankly enjoy the flavor and how the employees help me , they are very fun! :)"}
{"text":"Worst customer service EVER. NEVER get food from there, it's absolutely HORRIBLE! Called to find out about my order and the guy was incredibly rude then HUNG UP on me! Uber Eats with them took an hour and a half to arrive even though we live less than a ten minute drive away. Food arrived cold and was terribly made. There is absolutely NO redeeming quality about this place, do yourself a favour and don't give them your business."}
{"text":"I ordered wings through UberEats. Right after I ordered, I decided I wanted to change the sauce from hot to medium. I looked up the number online for the restaurant. I called the number only to be told that it was a customer service call center and not the actual restaurant. I asked for the restaurant number. The woman on the line told me she could not give it out. I hung up and called a different number I found. It was for orders. I was told it was also a call center. THERE IS NO PHONE LISTING FOR THE ACTUAL RESTAURANT. I asked if she would call and change my order. I was told she could not do that. I finally called UberEats. They called the restaurant and it was by then too late to change. Fine. The wings arrived. I am a big fan of wings. These were LITERALLY the smallest wings I have EVER seen. They were tiny. The sauce was very good. Unfortunately, I also ordered blue cheese dressing and even paid for it. They sent ranch. Tiny wings, no customer service, wrong dipping sauce. I would avoid this place. Terrible experience."}
{"text":"I was craving something greasy, so grabbed a poutine from Wing Machine and took it home. I wasn't expecting it to be anything special...I'm glad I didn't have high expectations, because it was awful. Still, it was greasy so I was reasonably happy.
Until I was half way done, and noticed dead flies floating in the gravy at the bottom."}
{"text":"Realllllly good wings. My favourites are Honey Garlic (basic, yes) and Jerk (get ready to sweat). My SO often gets 40 Creek and medium and enjoys his. They are small wings, but good quality. I find they have a proportional amount of meat on them. I get a pound and it comes in a little cardboard pizza box and it's filled right up. They deliver them very quickly and are always still hot when they arrive. It's pretty impressive delivery service really. We've also ordered the spicy fries which are very flavourful. They staff is accommodating to special requests like splitting a pound of wings between two flavours. You just have to call them directly and ask. I wish I had a picture but we ate them so quickly!"}
{"text":"wing machine in the food court at 200 elizabeth street, TGH is absolutely to ve avoided. chicken wings were smallest I've had in several years and hey aren't sold by the pound. Flavor less  . owner will not pass te cocktail siracha,  instead he asks for 79 cents for 1.5 ounces calling it a dipping sauce.
not sure why anyone would put up with this crap.since food court doesn't have a pizza place, get rid of this bozo and install a real pizza kiosk. $ 7.89 for 9 wings. whoopee. 
I am so pissed I'm gonna write  the hospital president to saunter down there  for lunch  and sees  if he's proud of this safe excuse  for \" restaurant\"."}
{"text":"Decided to take a chance ordering through Uber Eats as it were only 1/3 that were open at the time. We got ribs, onion rings, and garlic bread with cheese because we didn't expect much, and you can't really go wrong with onion rings and bread. Gross. We were wrong. The ribs were like frozen No Name ribs with some sauce drizzled over them. The garlic bread with cheese was actually inedible. Thinking about it again is making me feel queasy. It was a 12inch sub SLATHERED in butter. It didn't not taste like garlic nor was it toasted. It came in a sub bag that was full of grease and when I took it out I realized they melted the cheesed then closed it so when I opened it only one side had cheese. Truth be told, I think they slathered butter on it, cheese, closed it and then heated it in the microwave in the bag it came in. I wish I checked out these reviews first!"}
{"text":"This chain has dropped in quality so badly in the last 20 years.  It used to be not so long ago that you'd get really good food from Wing Machine.  The last time I ordered last year, I got a horridly dried out meal.  I put the experience aside.  Today I tried again and ordered a half chicken dinner, and three drumsticks hoping the last experience was isolated.  Nope.

To be blunt, I've seen fresher stuff unwrapped from the pyramids of Giza.  It was cold on arrival, totally dessicated, and the \"dinner\" was pressed flat to fit in a pizza box.  The drumsticks didn't even look as good as something excavated from Giza.  They were obviously found in the Sahara, spiced to death and dropped in a box.  Two strikes, they're out.

Not sure if other stores in the chain are better but this is what the Bloor & Dufferin store are trying to pass off as edible food.  Save yourself the money, eat the menu."}
{"text":"Oh man... This place has been open for a long time, so I decided to try out their wings. 

As others have experienced, the wings are tiny. You get a tiny box, which was what my ribs came in too. The wings barely had any meat on them and everything was covered in sauce. 

Ok, the real bummer is that I found a piece of short hair glued onto the rib... I was so disgusted, I threw out the whole thing. Otherwise, the one piece I had prior to finding the hair was nice and tender. (See picture)

The fries were not bad, but HAIR on my ribs is a big NONO!! Never coming back hair (haha get it?)"}
{"text":"Pretty decent pizza. I like that they give you a free dipping sauce with their 8.99 carry out special...definately would order again. Way better quality than Pizza Pizza in my opinion, about Pizza Nova standard."}
{"text":"I almost didn't write a review because I didn't want to admit I come here. What a dive and I bet they sell more beer than wings and all food combined on any given day. The wings are good, some days better than others. What I like most is they bake the wings instead of deep fry. And for that reason only I come here. I avoid wings because they are not healthy but if you must then this place does them well."}
{"text":"*This is a Delivery Review*

I realize there are so many amazing independent pizza and wing places in Toronto but my go to delivery service for pizza and wings is by far Wing Machine. The wings are baked (never fried) and they have sauce on the side so if you are indecisive like me, you can pick a few options and change it up each dip!. I always get the People's Choice Deal, which is 1 lb of wings, 1 medium pizza and 1 sauce for $19.99. To me that's a great value. I've never had a bad experience with them and they are very quick with their delivery to our house. (usually 40 minutes or less). 

The best part about wing machine is that you get points with every order (who doesn't like racking up points to get free stuff!) so you can cash those in for anything on their menu. They always have a deal going on right now that if you register on their online ordering system, they will automatically give you 100 points.

I highly recommend wing machine for your late night pizza / wings / onion rings .... Basically anything delicious delivery service."}
{"text":"I must say that the new wing machine flavours are amazing. I ordered the jerk flavour. Loved it. The cajun flavour was amazing. Now that it is NBA playoffs, i usually never order from the same place in the same month. However I would definately order from this place now that im on playoff mode!"}
{"text":"I paid an absurd amount for dozen crappy little reheated wings. I don't mind paying decent money for wings if they are fresh, but these were reheated junk that had no flavour. 

Staff was typical, no acknowledgment of you as a customer, they are just there to take your money and get you out the door. 

Place wasn't very clean or inviting either."}
{"text":"It's changed to being more of a drinking place for the economically challenged - low brow clientele. Recommend House on Parliament instead."}
{"text":"What can I say, I love wings!

I normally have them at least once a week and have tried a variety of places in the downtown area. For a change, I decided to order in wings and had a very hard time locating a place which delivers good wings to my area. 

Wing Machine was one such place and I was pleasantly surprised when the order came in. I ordered a pound of wings Buffallo Hot with the Cajun side dip  and the Mushroom Melt burger. 

The wings were baked rather than fried, which added to the flavor without leaving the usual greasy feeling after eating them. I am a sucker for extreme hotness, but even the hottest wings they had, didn't raise my \"Rage\" meter. Nonetheless, the wings were tasty enough for me to keep ordering from this place. 

The burger, if not the best I had, was good enough with the patty being nicely done and still juicy after nearly 45 mins which the place took to deliver my food. 

I have kept ordering from this place and I would recommend it if you are not a born Wings enthusiast. For the price the quality is good!"}
{"text":"I ordered pizza through Uber eats and this is what showed up. Called the store, they blamed Uber eats and were so rude. Hung up on me twice. Would never order from this location again. Worst experience ever. Stay far away from this place. Yuck"}
{"text":"I don't remember what it was that my high school peers loved so much about wing machine. I was under the impression that they has some kind of magical wings, sprinkled with psychedelics and MSG. 

I go here for take out, it's extremely HOT and stuffy inside...horribly. To the point where I start to get dizzy just standing at the counter. 

The wings looks like frog legs...the only tiny, shriveled up thing I can compare them to and keep this PG-13. So dry and flavorless, even when fresh outta the oven.

I givez 1 star for the service, the guys here are sorta nice and sweet in their own way. 1 star for the large onion rings - 5 bucks for a big box and the actually taste nice and fresh. 

With the array of wing places all around Little Korea, this wouldn't (or shouldn't...) be anyone's first choice. I would suggest going a couple steps north to Wild Wing/Puck or a block south to St Louis. 

PS if you do decide to try the wings, as for a lot of sauce. You're gonna need it....and be prepared to pay da big bucks for that ranch dip."}
{"text":"It's such a shame this place doesn't get enough customers because they are so nice. 

The food is pretty good too. 

They have a special 5 premium beers for $15 right now which I think is amazing."}
{"text":"Save yourself some time, go somewhere else. Worst food I ever got in my life. Their burger was made of beef that seemed to be straight out of the freezer not completely cooked, it looked like dog food. A patty. The bread was cold. The lettuce had brown spots. Truly disgusting. Ive never thrown food in the garbage in my life, Never. But this, I tasted it and spit it out. Mcdonalds, Harveys, A&w burgers are king's food compared to what I received. And it was way more expensive. Their \"3 cheese\" bread, was cold bread with 1 cheese, cold, spread on it. It was awful. And the delivery was 20 minutes late. I had to call, they told
Me they never received the order. I had to call the delivery company, they told me the restaurant did get it, they didnt understand. The restaurant just didnt check properly. 20 minutes later than the one hour I already waited, I got it. And I had to throw it in the garbage. Even if their wing might be good, ive never tried them, but even then, if a restaurant can serve that kind of food, I wouldn't trust them for anything else. Just go somewhere they respect your money."}
{"text":"I work @Toronto General Hospital (HK Dept). I do have my meals at the food court in the hospital. I usually buy my meals from Wing Machine or Hero Burger. Wing Machine I find the staff friendly and the food good. I usually take their Jerk pork combo, or the daily specials like Chicken Tikka Masala.  I have been a happy customer for over 5 years, I would surely recommend the Wing Machine if you are visiting the hospital."}
{"text":"Some time ago, we ordered from Wing Machine and got their (entirely mediocre and forgettable) wings. That would've been fine, except we were double-charged on our credit card. I called them several times, and ended up even going in to the restaurant -- twice -- to talk to the manager, but never got a response.

The first time I went to the restaurant, the person had no idea what to do; the second time, the manager took my receipt and promised to look into it, but never did. In the end, I'd spent so long trying to get a refund for the double-charge that I couldn't even contact my credit card to do a chargeback, so I guess they \"got away with it.\"

If you're looking for mediocre wings and indifferent service, go for it. Otherwise, look elsewhere."}
{"text":"I had walked by this place so many times before I decided to finally try it. I'm sorry to say, but considering this is a \"wing\" place, it sucks at making wings. They're small, hard, not flavourful, and expensive for what you get.  I'm so surprised that this place is still around. It looks like an old pizza joint on the inside. It's dark and the sign looks dated too. I've heard that this place serves better pizza than they do wings, but I didn't come for pizza, I came for wings!"}
{"text":"Its not much to look at but the wings are phenomenal for the price you pay. We make sure to check this out whenever we travel to Toronto."}
{"text":"Ribs were so tough, they were crunchy and I could barely get them off the bone. I threw them out. Wrong soft drink. Pizza was so bland it was unpleasant and I threw it out too. I won't be back. Complete waste of money."}
{"text":"Soooo I came here during that really bad ice storm last winter. That was fun. Sacrifices for pizza, you know? I was arguing with my friend that this place wasn't a Double Double, but a Wing Machine. She was adamant that she was right. Eventually, I picked up the phone and called \"Wing Machine\" to ask if they were Double Double, and to my surprise, they were. They should have better signage indicating they also operate as a Double Double! My friend did the ordering and the payment so mannnn I did not do my due diligence as a Yelper! 

I remember she got a Hawaiian pizza with 10 wings and a box of wedges. With a single bottle of pepsi, this somehow came up to over $30. The food was really good. It does the job and it will fatten you up. Wings were crispy and slathered in hot sauce that I normally wouldn't like, but I ended up eating all 5 of mine really fast. The pizza crust was \"poofy\" and better than expected. The wedges weren't anything special.

I felt the price was pretty steep in comparison to Pizza Pizza, but worth the experience if you want to broaden your fast food pizza horizons."}
{"text":"The food is old, dry, and has no taste whatsoever. I work in the hospital. I have given this place several chances, and every time I come here I am incredibly disappointed with the food. The butter chicken has no flavour. I don't usually add salt to my meals. However, I had to add THREE packages of salt to my meal. That is crazy! The chicken legs looks incredibly dry due to sitting under the heat lamps all day. They should not appear to have wrinkles on the skin. My colleagues have bought the chicken legs for lunch, and the meat was stringy--not normal for chicken legs.

I was ordering 1/2 fries and 1/2 onion rings. Unfortunately, they no longer sell them this way. You would have to buy a side of fries and a side of onion rings. Therefore, they have lost my business forever.

The owners are fortunate that they get unsuspecting and new customers each day because it is a hospital. If their business were based on returning customers, they would go bankrupt very quickly. Also look at the lineups. There's lineups at Subway, Hero Burger, and Druxy's. The staff knows not to eat there because they know that the food is horrible."}
{"text":"It's one of those places where you get what you pay for.  Cheap food and big portions, but unhealthy and greasy.  It's a tiny place on the inside so don't expect to eat your meal there, and they're definitely more take-out oriented.  The combo's are good value if you like wings.

Overall the food's been good, but I stopped going because the wings were inconsistent.  Some days you'd get average sized wings, others you'd get scrawny tiny things masquerading as wings.  The ribs are ok but they're drenched in sugar-sauce."}
{"text":"Not fit for dog food

I was SHOCKED at how bad these wings were.  These were the WORST wings I've probably EVER had in my entire life.  90% of the wing was HARD AS BONE - and I was able to pull about 5% of the flesh off to try to eat that.  Words really can't describe how terrible the wings were.   They were dry as the desert and hard as rock.  Oh - and cold.  (I'm glad I didn't order more than I did because I tried to order the deal that was listed on the front of the flyer that I have - but the order desk said they'd never heard of such a discount - false advertising.)

The ribs were disappointing.  Fries and garlic bread were OK.

I guess my first warning of bad food was when the delivery guy shows up and he is probably well over 300 lbs.  I get the impression he prepared the food - and I also bet he hasn't taken any pride in ANYTHING he's produced in years.

$58 bucks wasted.   Thanks Wing Garbage"}
{"text":"There should be a term for that feeling you get right after walk into a restaurant about to collapse from hunger and place an order with the frenetic intensity of a meth addict, and then, calmed by the inevitability of food, you *then* decide to check the Yelp app and you see that establishment in which you stand has nothing but one-star reviews. Perhaps Yelp Lament? Yelp Remorse? Yelp-morse? I'm open to suggestions.

Wing Machine offers pizza, panzos, roasted chicken, ribs, burgers, subs, salads and as you would expect chicken wings. The wings here are baked rather than fried, but don't let that fool you into thinking this is some kind of health food. The wings are still kind of greasy, and small, and not very good. To add insult to injury they are over $10 a pound, which struck me as a bit offensive for a take-out joint. 

I imagine 99% of their regular clientele are inebriated students looking for a tall can of Arizona and some greasy meat to help them survive the night. The rest must be people who forgot to read the reviews. Don't be one of those people. Don't be like me.

Obligatory Title Pun: Rage against the WING MACHINE.

Menu Readability: Un-be-fucking-readable. That is to say, it took me more than a minute to find wings on the menu.

Need to mention: My downfall can be expressed in two words: open late.

What this place teaches me about myself: I really can't let myself get so hungry."}
{"text":"The food is dry and not fresh at all..everyone I know in the hospital knows this..but due to lack of choices still end up buying here. Last time I purchased the butter chicken and the chicken was stringy falling off the bone. Even the bone was mushey! Yuck! Had to toss it in the garbage after one bite. The food was probably sitting under the heating lamps for the whole day. The owner should know better not to serve that crap!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed. I've past by this place for years and haven't gotten the chance to try it yet until today.. I assumed because the place is known for just WINGS, they would clearly do them right.... I was wrong :(

When u got home to open my box of wings I was SHOCKED at the size of the wings. I'm no wing connoisseur, but these were shit. They tasted worse than frozen wings from the grocery store. The breaking tastes cheap, and did I say the wings are TINY!? 

Also, they give you this tiny tiny container of sauce for your wings. I think after two wings I was out of sauce. Also they charge you .85 cents for each additional \"tiny\" container of sauce. 

another thing to note... There is a tray of wings sitting on the counter already cooked. I feel like they were sitting there for hours. Not sanitary, not appealing, definitely not fresh. 

I would not come here again. I have no idea how this place has stayed in business for so long. Go to wild wings or at Louis 1 block from here instead."}
{"text":"I've been in the food business for 42 years. What I received from the swing machine was pre-cooked barely warmed up I could not tell how long they have been sitting they were so dry they were so tasteless. I phoned and they gave me. Five dollars off of my next order they should've come and replace them right away. So that five dollars is useless the kids I will not order the wing machine ever again"}
