{"text":"Gross!!!  The breakfast had no taste to it at all. Way better places out there."}
{"text":"Excellent Breakfast, and it is very consistent in quality. 

The atmosphere of Dawsons is very clean and comfortable, very much like your grandmothers kitchen, and even when the line up is out the door, The service speed is exceptional.

The Original breakfast is a great choice it has all the breakfast basics, and they do not over cook the bacon, though you can request extra crispy if you prefer. I have never had a request missed, or my meal over cooked.

Definitely my top choice for my Saturday morning breakfast, and Ranks as number 1 with me for all the diners I have been to in Durham region, and I have been to a lot of them."}
{"text":"An early day out we decided to hit Dawsons for a breakfast before we took on the day .
The place is small but has seating for about 40 people.
It seemed to be a good place to go judging by the lack of parking.
The tables are all \"ikea-ish\" four seaters (no booths) that feel like the hexagon bolts are in desperate need of that little tool or allen key tightening. 

The service is odd... No one seems to be able to commit to one table, a waitress for cutlery,one for coffee and yet another for taking your order, now this wouldn't be a bad thing if the sequence was at all flowing and not sporadic.
The food that takes a very , very long time, doesn't taste fresh at all and is either over cooked (eggs rubbery) or under cooked (raw potatoe). 

I believe in supporting the \"small guy\" but I hate to admit it... going to a franchised place would have been a better choice. The owner was collecting the cash on the way out... didnt ask how our meal was, but I felt compelled to inform him of the experience and his response was, \" I'll look into it\" .... well someone else will have to do a review on how that investigation turns out as no one in our group would ever dare to go back and waste our money and time."}
{"text":"The eggs benedict here is quiet good & was done perfectly. My mom's belgian waffle was damn good too. It stands up to the few local breakfast places i've been to. 

The restaurant was immaculate & clean probably one of the more neater ones i've seen in the area. It got busy in the morning, was here at about 10am on a Saturday & didn't have much issues getting a seat but they fill up quick & the turnover isnt bad. They also play Soccer on the television :) (which is a plus for me lol). 

Saw a lot of people had server issues but our server was very attentive and didn't have any issues with her

Def will come back again, it's a nice little find."}
{"text":"Dawson's was busy but I don't know why. 

The owner (I assume) was not warm or friendly at all. He was pretty surly as he pointed us at the free tables and told us to pick one. 

Our servers seemed to be playing musical chairs. One to take our drink order. And then we waited. One to give us our drink order. And then we waited. One to take our food order. And then we waited. One to serve us the food. 

The food wasn't much better. Pancakes were heavy. The bacon was soft (ick). The eggs were super greasy. The potatoes were mushy. Everything just tasted MEH and BLAH and OILY. 

Surly, scatterbrained and meh does not equate to a winning equation. I'm not coming back."}
{"text":"Went once and it was not very good and my over easy eggs were the same colour as my toast. 

T&D burger around the  corner is much better"}
{"text":"For a quick basic breakfast this is an ok choice.  Cheap prices with a limited menu."}
