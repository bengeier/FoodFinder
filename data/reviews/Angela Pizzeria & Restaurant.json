{"text":"Ordered a bunch of food for delivery from Angela's around 3 am. It arrived quickly and it was absolutely delicious! My friends and I ordered the chocolate cake, apple pie, BLT, western egg sandwich and everything was made perfectly. The delivery arrived within 35 minutes and was friendly. I recommend ordering from Angela's (especially for late night cravings!!) Cheap too!"}
{"text":"What can I say about such a staple restaurant for students and others who frequent Angela? The service is awesome so intrinsically you really want to love the place, but their pizza is just so not good that you can't help but wish you never ordered it even though you keep making the same mistake every time someone drags you there (I'm so totally obviously not talking about myself if you couldn't tell :p). That being said, prices are ok and service is good. Never tried anything but their pizza and garlic bread so my review is limited but let's just say that you shouldn't order the pizza, ok?"}
{"text":"I don't remember the last time I enjoyed eating from Angela's.  From the excessive amounts of cheap cheese they use on your pizza to the uncooked pizza dough and the poor quality pepperoni.  It's a huge miss and got sick from eating here."}
{"text":"Favourite place to order from when I get home drunk late at night. The service is questionable sometimes but the food is good so who cares..."}
{"text":"AVOID. it's decent if you have been drinking all night (open till 430), the pizza is mediocre at best. We arrived in town and ordered pick up, instead of eating outside (cold night), we POLITELY asked if we could sit at one of the many empty tables. We were essentially told to leave, not allowed. The old Grey haired grumpy looking owner a DOUCHE."}
{"text":"We arrived Montreal really late and was looking for dinner place. Our hotel told us we could order delivery from this place. We called to order around 11:30pm and the food was delivered around 00:25am. We order the meat ball pasta, carrot soup & chicken plate (1 stick). Everything tasted better than I expected. I'm not a fan of the meat ball but the pasta and sauce were nice. I like the carrot soup which was flavorful. My fav dish is the chicken pallet. I came with a chicken skewer, fries and rice. The flavor was good and the chicken was not dry. All the portions were decent. I was satisfied about out midnight dinner."}
{"text":"This place is alright. serviceable food. The cooks here make the food reasonably quick and the cashier provides decent service. I like the chicken pitas here and this place is a popular late night eat when bars close at 3am. This place closes at 5am, that's why its popular. My only gripe with this place is that waitresses here tend to suck and the poutine here is not that great.   This place also delivers."}
{"text":"Who knew it would be so difficult to find a decent tasting poutine in Montreal? I don't think melted on shredded cheese should even be allowed to be called a poutine, so the fact that it took over an hour to get to my house only makes it more disappointing. The souvlaki would have been good if it wasn't soggy by the time I got it, in their defence I live farther from the place than I realized."}
