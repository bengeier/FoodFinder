{"text":"Nice service, great jerk chicken and curry chicken. Very clean restaurant, and highly recommend."}
{"text":"What a great place! The staff is very friendly. My family and I went and ordered the oxtails, jerk Salamon, jerk burger, jerk chicken and rasta pasta. The food is tasty and authentic. I had never had jerk Salamon until trying it here and now I order it every time. The rasta pasta is a nice treat. I love the peppers and sauce mixed in it. Did I mention the portions!? This place serves great portions for the price. We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Very good Jerk Chicken. Good portion.Good service.  Price is good.  Paul is very nice"}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS AMAZING. Don't be deterred by the strip mall location. If you want delicious authentic Jamaican food, you WANT Kool Jerk. I first tried their food at the AZ Caribbean Jerk Festival, and thought it was yummy. So today, I ventured there for lunch... Even. Better. The sauce that comes with the jerk chicken meal is the BEST jerk bbq sauce I have ever tasted. Seriously. My husband is Jamaican and we travel to Jamaica a lot, so I like to think I have pretty high standards when it comes to the food. Kool Jerk is the only place in Phoenix that has wowed me, and my husband says 100% the same. Their dining room is friendly and spacious, so just ignore the outside area and venture inside. Kool Jerk is one-thousand-percent worth it."}
{"text":"Very flavorful jerk chicken, good amount of spice to it, but not so much that it's inedible. Plaintains were good too. The macaroni and cheese was so bland that even putting the jerk sauce on it didn't help, but there was a lot of it."}
{"text":"ZERO STARS. HORRIBLE HORRIBLE BUSINESS.
DID NOT ACCEPT RESTAURANT.COM CERTIFICATE!!!!

Came in on a Friday night around 7pm,  the business was completely dead. The woman waitress said they were limited to only a few items, apparently they were out of 90% of what was on their very small menu. The only reason we came was because they're listed on Restaurants.com, and we had a gift card. (When I redeemed the certificate, it mistakenly purchased 2  $15 for $30 worth of food...  2! I didn't want that!) So we went, and we ended up ordering 2 entr√©es, (stewed pork and jerk chicken) 1 soda, and 1 side of plantains.. food was decent, had good flavor. The plantains were not fully fried at all though, so soggy, tasted like they barely seared it.  When we finished our food, we thought surely this is only worth around $20, (didnt know the price of my entree, wasnt on the menu) let's order something to go because we need to get $30 worth of food! But randomly she brings us the bill without asking us for anything else..the bill comes out to $33!!! They charged me almost $13 for my entree. The receipt showed oxtail, when I ordered and got stewed pork. They literally hand wrote  /pork on the receipt next to oxtail. They pretty much charged me the most expensive entree they had, when supposedly they had only the 4 items available to choose from. When we observed the receipt,  she said, \"oh, its not on the menu, but its the same price as the oxtail\" 

Ok, whatever,  we're over $30 bucks now, we can use the gift certificate.. 
So I show her my phone to tell her I have the restaurants.com certificate, and without even looking at my phone, she quickly responded, \"no, we're not using that anymore, I don't know why that's still on there, sorry.\"    ARE YOU KIDDING ME???!!  My husband kindly asked, \"are you sure you can't?, how were we supposed to know, I mean, that's just business ethics.\" Her response, \"No, sorry, maybe if the manager was here, but he's not, so no,  sorry.\" 

Hmmmm, or maybe because we aren't black???(We're hispanic/asian)  Definitely racist, condescending attitude from this woman. (You can tell when you're not welcome the minute you walk in, they did not want us there, even though we're the only customers).. And i know for a fact they purposely over charged us..

We paid. Zero tip. Said thank you, and left. 

Will never come back to this business, I recommend everyone to steer clear from this kind of establishment (unless you're their \"kind\" of course)"}
{"text":"I came Kool Jerk a visit on a Sunday afternoon ... they're usually not open on Sundays but the owner told me this was there first Sunday opening.  The service was great!  The food was good ... really good.  The chicken was flavored so good but I must admit, it was a little dry.  I think it was cooked the night before.  The rice and beans were super hot and fresh, the chicken ... not so much.

Because I've been craving good Jamaican food for as long as I can remember I'm willing to give the place another try and possibly update the review to a 5 star :)"}
{"text":"I must say I looked up this place on Yelp because I wanted to try some Jamaican food you have to try this spot food was delicious service was great and make sure you tell Paul I sent you."}
{"text":"I almost thought I was back in Florida at my favorite Jamaican restaurant. Kool Jerk is amazing! The staff is very friendly! They even brought my good out to my car since I went back to my car to check on my puppy. Great customer service & even greater food!"}
{"text":"Greatness comes in the form of Chicken thighs marinated in Jerk spices..yum yum yum!!!!"}
{"text":"Three words, Oh My God. 
Absolutely amazing. The service is the best you can find, can't go wrong with mr. Pablo. The food, oh the food, tastes amazing, looks amazing, well priced. What more could you ask for.
I definitely recommend trying this place out and going back as I am for sure doing."}
{"text":"Kool Jerk is excellent. They're coming up on their one-year anniversary (at least according to my conversations with the staff) and if you haven't tried it yet, you're missing out. 

First, the food is outstanding. The rice and beans and steamed vegetables are on point, not just some visual dressing on your plate. And the chicken -- a little spicy but dead on. DEAD ON! I always order a quarter chicken and I always regret not getting the half because it's so good I just want to gorge. Oh -- and get the fried plantains. 

The service is also exceptional. Everyone is friendly and approachable. The service time is quick and the food always comes out hot.   

I really can't say enough good things about Kool Jerk! -- Oh, and you can also order on the Yelp/Eat24 app if you're in a rush or want to enjoy their awesome jerk chicken at home."}
{"text":"This place was AWFUL. We arrived and the place was dead except for a group of men sitting and talking in a booth. The lady who worked there sat us down and gave us their very small menu. She walked away and the group of men left. She returned and said that they were limited to only Jerked Chicken, oxtail, curry chicken and curry goat. 

My friend asked if they could make a burger and she said no. He then asked for a cheese quesadilla which she said she could do. The rest ordered jerk chicken, which was the reason why we wanted to eat there. Shortly after, she returned and said she didn't have quesadillas either.

When we arrived they still had almost 3 hours left of business hours and yet they were not serving/out of almost everything on their menu? Quesadilla is literally two items: cheese and a tortilla and she couldn't accommodate him. 

Needless to say, we left."}
{"text":"I attended the Jerk Chicken festival in Tempe today.  I decided to try Kool Jerk because the line to their booth was the longest.  I am so glad I did!   By far the best Jerk Chicken I have had outside Jamaica.   The special sauce they serve on the side is amazing.   If you are looking for a true taste of Jamaica make sure you make a stop at Kool Jerk!"}
{"text":"Definitely one the best places for Jamaican food in Phoenix. I was starting to get disappointed but they definitely delivered exceptional, fresh, authentic food. And the owner and chef are awesome. I have had their jerk chicken. I am going back to try their jerk salmon."}
{"text":"I had seen advertisements about this place for quite sometime. I then looked up this place on Yelp to see what the reviews were like. I love jerk chicken so when I found out this place was supposed to be quality home made stuff, I had to try it out.

The chicken literally falls off the bone. It was so delicious. The staff is friendly and welcoming. I felt a homely comfortable experience. I will be back and I highly recommend this place.

If you like really spicy food then ask them to make the jerk chicken hot and they will do it for you."}
