{"text":"We visited the Taverne of Richfield for dinner on a beautiful Tuesday night, so we took advantage and dined on the patio. Our whole experience from atmosphere to drink to food to service was excellent. This is our second dinner outing at the Taverne of Richfield, and it gets better every visit.  The patio is very large and nicely landscaped and sectioned with stepped up areas, trellises, and a fountain surrounded by foliage. The fountain wasn't running but I imagine it is on more crowded evenings. It seems like this would be a fabulous happy hour or night out on the weekend.  Our evening started off with a glass of Chardonnay with their complimentary warm house-made bread. An amazing blend of crusty on the outside and moist and buttery inside. This was accompanied with with a bright, lemon-basil olive oil dip. We would come back just for the bread and dip alone! Next we had an equally refreshing green apple / cabbage salad with goat cheese - a frequent and welcome ingredient on their menu. He had a generous portioned, pecan-crusted chicken with goat cheese on top.  Served with thinly sliced, crispy fingerling potatoes and baby carrots with a tasty butter-sage sauce. Moist and delicious, with nice presentation. I had gnocchi which was super flavorful and lemony with roasted tomatoes. My only criticism is I wish there were more vegetables in the dish to offset the denseness of the gnocchi. Don't get me wrong - they were very good, but another texture and flavor would have been welcome to lighten it up - especially as the only vegetarian entree.  As always, we asked many questions about the line up of evening entertainment, menu items and happy hour deals to which our server josh, never flinched. He was very knowledgeable and attentive and clued us into all the happenings so that we will surely return to try them out.  For those living in the surrounding areas of Richfield, this is a gem right in your backyard. Embrace it. The restaurant is located at the corner of Rt. 303 and Broadview Road with great parking and old inn vibe. Definitely worth the drive from anywhere. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Went a few months ago.. think they were still working out the kinks. It could be a great local restaurant (for me at least) because it's right around the corner. The food is good, our server was decent, the place was nice. The pricing seems a bit high for my tastes. I'll probably try it again in a few months to see if it's gotten better. It would definitely be great to have a \"decent\" local restaurant alternative to what's currently (not) there. There's definitely no shortage of \"biker joints\".. and I am a biker so that's cool. But it'd be nice to have some more upscale places as well. Heck, there's plenty of money around--sadly, just not many places to go."}
{"text":"Although we live nearby in Copley, close to the many fine restaurants in Montrose and Bath/Fairlawn, we were looking for somewhere special to celebrate combined wedding anniversaries with our best friends. We first checked out the Taverne for a lunch, and based on that very pleasurable taste experience, (a shared salt-roasted beet salad and Philly-style steak sandwich), and a charming \"country inn\" atmosphere reminiscent of Chautauqua, NY, we booked our anniversary dinner. The dinner was every bit exceptional as we had hoped it would be, on a perfect June evening. We began our fine dining experience with their unique Charcouterie board appetizer with a savory selection of cheeses and crostini, and couldn't resist going for the delicately-flavored beet salad again. The delicately-flavored dipping oil for the crusty bread deserves special mention too. We shared a delicious spinach, artichoke, salmon entrée (And yes, there is no fuss about sharing items for those of us who are light eaters. They willingly split the item in the kitchen, and still deliver it with the same attractive presentation as the full entrée.) We paired it with their refreshing white peach sangria, perfect for a summer evening, and finished with a yummy and not-too-sweet flour-less chocolate cake. We'd be remiss if we didn't also mention the pleasant and attentive server Sarah, who attended us at both our luncheon and the subsequent dinner. All in all, an exceptional dining experience, with just the right combination of atmosphere, culinary delights and presentation. We look forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"So incredibly disappointing.  The building itself is attractive and we were drawn in by the outdoor patio which is where we sat.  It happened to be customer appreciation night so we ordered a few things from that menu, and also from the regular menu.  I can honestly say there wasn't a single thing that tasted good.  We ordered the Flatbread with herbs and chilean olive oil and it was no more than cut up pita triangles with virtually no taste!  The texture on the Korean Sliders was abysmal..almost a ground liver consistency..yuck.  The beet salad consisted of lots of lettuce and mandoline slices of beets and a small amount of blue cheese.  Lastly, the mussels were nothing special.  Some were fishy, and many were extremely tiny.  The broth can sometimes be the best part for bread dipping, but it was thin and tasteless.  To make matters worse, our waitress, although friendly, was frantic and scattered and couldn't answer our questions without guessing at an answer.  We wont' be back."}
{"text":"Four of us went to Tavern of Richfield last week and we all raved about the entire experience. Sat outside on the patio, had an attentive and knowledgeable server. Our appetizers and entrees were all excellent. I had the ahi tuna and loved it. Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar for happy hour. Service was great and they had a decent hh food menu. Ordered of the menu.  Spinach ravioli  (vegetarian) & single filet . Excellent. Bar tender kept water glasses full. Friendly service. Looking forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"Great meal and I lucked out as Thursday's are Appreciation night and my meal was discounted quite a bit. I started out with hummus for an appetizer which was served with lightly grilled pita. Excellent! My main course was the Schnitzel with lingenberry gastrique which came with potato cake, and lightly seared green cabbage. It was a fabulous change to the normal grind! Loved it.  The atmosphere is great as the setting is an older building with a lot of character. Service was a little slow even when a very quiet night."}
{"text":"The reason to come to the Tavern of Richfield is to listen to the band in the martini lounge in the basement and have some great drinks! I have come here three times to see Blu Monsoon play with my family or friends and we always have a good time.   In regards to the food it is also very delicious bit I have only eaten here once. Their desserts are to die for though! I would like to try eating upstairs in the main restaurant but the whole menu is available in the martini lounge so we usually prefer to just sit down there. They also have some very interesting specials for the goodies out there like pasta from Ohio city or something the chef has cooked up. The food can be a bit pricey though, especially if you are buying their specialty cocktails as well. I recommend martinis and desserts with friends!  This place is rather quiet and small. It's not somewhere you go to meet people but rather a place to be able to talk to your closest friends in an intimate atmosphere. I plan on going back again!"}
{"text":"Tried to go last year, but got snowstormed out, so really looking forward to this.  Started out poorly; they did not have our reservation. Luckily the dining area was only partially full, so after a few minutes of fiddling with the computer, they were able to fit us in.  It was evident we were not the first occupants of the booth with the crumbs and staining of the tablecloth.  Followed by water service that provided either flat sparking water or 7-up scented liquid.  The hummus appetizer and side Caesars salads were good.  Service very attentive (Jackie).  Too bad the main courses did not hold up.  My prime rib must have been 3\" thick, buy not cooked properly.  It was the correct doneness, but they did a real bad job roasting it.  My wife's walleye was overdone and had a burnt flavor.  The bean/carrot medley was pure Birds-Eye.  Decided against dessert.  My overall reaction was an over achieving menu the kitchen could not deliver in a market that isn't that sophisticated. They should dumb down the choices and work harder on execution.  As for atmosphere, this place needs a makeover.  Badly.  In summation, the owners need to decide what the Tavern is, be consistent in both aesthetics and menu, then deliver.  At least one of the stars is for Jackie alone."}
{"text":"My wife and I enjoyed an early Valentines Day dinner at this restaurant and had a really great meal. The menu is varied as are the flavors offered. We started with calamari, it was lightly fried and tender, the banana peppers added a nice wrinkle. My wife had the apple and cabbage salad. It could have easily served 2-3, it was very tasty. For dinner she had the schnitzel and I had the Delmonico steak. Hers had a great combination of delicate flavors. Mine was awesome but I was glad I had the sauce served on the side. While the bleu cheese soubise was great it was incredibly rich and I used it sparingly. After dinner we went downstairs and enjoyed some live entertainment. We thoroughly enjoyed all this restaurant had to offer and I plan on coming back."}
{"text":"still not brave enough to do the restaurant again, but the downstairs bar at the Tavern of Richfield has Pier Pressure playing :-). The band was very cool and talented. Great drinks"}
{"text":"Attended Taverne's Easter Brunch. They had 2 \"buffets\" one upstairs, and one on the main level. We were seated upstairs and the brunch fare was one to mimic a school cafteria line. Sub-standard food, and at $25 a plate- a disaster. Food that was to be hot, was cold and vice-versa. Some dishes clearly had sat for a period of time due to the room temperature of most of their spread- meats, salads & salad dressings, etc.  Decided to forego getting a food-borne illness and ate elsewhere. Not sure if this was because it was a brunch, can't really vouche for their menu, etc. But this was enough that I won't return."}
{"text":"Had dinner there tonight. I really had high hopes for the current incarnation of this place. We have seen several generations of owners come and go. In fairness, our entrees and appetizer (calamari with Kim chi !?) were pretty good. Unfortunately, I had a Caesar salad that would have been mediocre except that the croutons, which appeared to be homemade, were completely soggy and unappetizing. So, the salad didn't quite make it to mediocre...  The worst offering by far was the drinking water and anything made with it. The overpowering iron and mineral taste made me abandon my water, iced tea and diet Coke. So....don't drink the water, or anything made with it.  Overall, the restaurant had that down at the heels, deferred maintenance is gaining ground, feel to it. Something about eating outside under an umbrella that is falling apart or has melon sized holes through it......."}
{"text":"EASTER BUFFET 2014.  I attended brunch today with a party of 7 adults and 5 children (age 5 to 9) Adults were $26.99 and kids $15.99.  I always take a few extra minutes before I write a negative review to think about past comparisons.  After getting a sense from our party about their evaluation of brunch, the vote was below average.  The brunch had one line for dinner selections and one line for breakfast choices.  On the dinner side, there were ham and prime rib choices plus baked fish.  Also, there was macaroni, rice, cauliflower w/cheese, Waldorf Salad, smoked salmon and a few other items. Most of our party commented on the prime rib that it was rare to raw.  On the breakfast side, it reminded me of a morning free breakfast in a good hotel.  Nothing to write home about!  Pancakes grilled long before on a stream table. There was quiche, unappealing home fries, very good bread pudding, bacon and a few other items.  Overall, based on good feedback from evening restaurant meals here in the past, our crew said the buffet was clearly not as good as ordering off the menu.  The moms felt $15.99 was high for young children.  The desert selections were very disappointing.  When I went to choose desert, they were out of plates.  Our server only gets two stars.  She took our drink orders promptly but I was never asked again if I wanted a refill.  When my silverware was taken off the table, I had to go hunting for a desert fork.  Since we were a party group, the tip was an automatic 20%.  The weak attention we received and compared to the work required if we had all ordered off a menu made the gratuity a gift.  I must say that the server's interaction with all of us was fine.  The food presented was just OK.  I was dragged to a Golden Corral recently and looking back, I liked it better than my buffet today.    I am not trying to discourage anyone from eating here for dinner but only cautioning you on your expectations from their buffet."}
{"text":"My first visit to the Tavern could not have been a better experience! The Tavern is a very unique and historical site to visit. Great food and drinks while sitting beside a crackling fireplace. The atmosphere is quite inviting and charming. Our server, Josh, provided excellent attentive service as well! I will definately be back!"}
{"text":"Great outdoor patio. Inventive dishes. Service was great just ask for Mike. Clam Bake was awesome!"}
{"text":"The food was very good however the wait staff could use more training. To start off with it took them about three to four minutes before a hostess greeted us, then we were approached by 2 more employees who didn't know we were waiting for the first one to come back and get us. We asked to sit outside  but when they sat us they gave us no utensils. When our lobster bisque soup and bread arrived there were no knives for the butter(anorher wait) and the soup was luke warm but it was very good so I didn't want to send it back.  When our meal was served we asked for more bread and tea but when it came we had to ask for butter. (Another wait...) she brought the butter but forgot the tea. (Another wait )  When she brought the tea she poured it while the glass was sitting on the grated table and the tea splashed feet and she didn't replenish the ice and it was warm. I'm sure if we had a.better trained waitress it would have been a more pleasant experience. Maybe the management should spend a little bit more time training the details to go with the more refined menu. I would give it another try because the food was very good."}
{"text":"We had the scnitzel.  Not good, very disappointed.  Greasy potato pancake, not much taste to the cabbage,  enjoyed the bread and olive oil and the red wine sangria.  The beet salad not enough beets, too much lettuce.  Waitress helper needed training,  She was serving the dinners without removing the salad plates.  Will try once more."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time in many years.  My wife and I arrived early and had Martinis in the bar.  Martinis were ok.  Started with the cheeseboard appetizer, the blue cheese was not a good choice.  The bread and oil is top notch.  The meals were incredible.  We waited a little extra as my delmonico steak was overdone, which the waitress was very communicative about, so no sweat.  The delmonico that came out was one of the best I have ever had.  My wife had the pecan chicken, which was equally outstanding,  both portions were large, we took some of each home.  The waitress offered us a complimentary dessert or champagne split due to our extra wait (it was not that long, props to them for offering though).  We settled on the turtle cheesecake, which was some of the finest cheesecake I have ever had.  The ambiance was quite nice.  Not a kid friendly place, at least for dinner time.  We were glad to do the taverna sans kids."}
{"text":"I met a client here for lunch one day and wasn't impressed.  The outside of the building looks like it would fall apart any minute, while the inside is old but decent.  I had lobster bisque soup and a Greek wrap. The food matched the decor, just decent. Not horrible but pretty bland.  My customer had their special which was a sausage sandwich and he liked it thank goodness.  I most likely won't be back considering I live out of the area and there are other options available that seem better."}
{"text":"We went for Christmas Eve. Now I've heard about this place since I was a kid. So I was kinda excited to check it out. Nice building and plenty of parking. Not hard to get to either.   They had a limited menu for the Holiday but it looked like it had all their most popular dishes. My Dad and I chose the shrimp and scallops. And my Mom chose the artichoke chicken. Also Mom got a side salad. I got a cup of wedding soup.   Side salad was huge. Dressing homemade and good. My Mom was very happy. The cup of wedding soup was just ok. Kinda salty and just ok. Lots of meatballs though. I like that. Not much chicken at all.  Dinners came promptly. The scallops and shrimp come with mashed potatoes and veggies. And you get 3 scallops and 3 shrimps with a homemade pesto. They were good. $26 for the dish. Might have wanted a few more shrimp and scallops though. It is not a filling dish. My Dad enjoyed it as well. Funny thing is they gave him a huge amount a the veggies on his plate. So many that my Mom and I had a few and he still had a ton. I did not get that many veggies just a scoop.   Moms artichoke chicken was not what she expected. She thought mashed potatoes and chicken breast on a plate. But it came in a soup type bowl and had lots of broth. Then the mashed potatoes were in the broth and the chicken on top. She enjoyed it. Just didn't expect it to be more soup like then just on a plate.  The service was good. The atmosphere was fun and casual. I'd go back. They have a bar area that looked good. Next time I'll try that out. See if they have a bar menu."}
{"text":"Oh please find a great cook and simple menu. I have tried liking this place 5 times in 2 years and I QUIT. So sad. Great drinks and patio but it stops there. Salmon and lamb - yuck.  Good calamari."}
{"text":"I met a friend here today for lunch. I thoroughly enjoyed the huge Applewood Bacon Melt sandwich, along with their Granny Apple Salad and a glass of Raywood Cabernet. The sandwich was so large that I brought half of it home. The bill was only $16.62, including tip. Our waitress, Jessica, kept us entertained with tales of the hauntings of the old building."}
{"text":"We had brunch here for Mother's Day. The food was mediocre at best. The quiche was sad and a little rubbery with a terrible crust. The mac and cheese was lacking flavor. The chicken was dry. At over $25 per adult I would have expected *something* in the buffet to have been good. I don't expect we'll go back for brunch."}
{"text":"always a treat to go tooooo,if most of you did not know the history of this tavern,well it used to be many things,in the early days this was used as the underground railroad,whereas the slaves who escaped from the south went thru this place,if you also need to know this place has special live in visitors,they never leave,oct 31st halloween night is special,,the spirits do show up,glasses break all of the time,doors open then they stick then they open.anyways you do not need to bring a guest,chances are you will have one there,the food is great,many people are taken by how rickity the building is.well its on the historical venue,"}
{"text":"Great find on a cross country road trip! Delicious potato dumpling soup, wow! Definitely check this out of you're in town or passing through."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great the food is descent and the staff are very nice. On thursday night the basement usually has really good llive music. I will definitly come back!"}
{"text":"This is the first time we have gone here, and the food and ambiance is great for a date or special occasion"}
{"text":"I have been going to the tavern of richfield for many years now and they have some of the best management staff I've ever come across they always try to accommodate and it's a shame that someone would even come on here and bad mouth them when I was there the day an obviously intoxicated woman screamed at the management and then had the nerve to have a friend come on here and write a poor review. They have great food and great staff no one there deserved what that woman put them through. it's too bad restaurants can't defend themselves and yelp against customers."}
{"text":"Went with group to the Ohio Beer pairing. 5 courses of well.thought pairings which pleased all palates.  Fun crowd in the basement, and food was top notch.  Service and management came together for an excellent experience.  Hopefully less bar chatter at the next one.  $75 a couple well spent, gratuity included.  Most of.us will return to spend our well earned gift cards....sorry Vik!"}
{"text":"We went to the Taverne after passing it many times and finally getting a chance to try it out. Friendly service. I got the chicken parmesan. It was good but chicken was too tough and chewy. I loved the ambiance and the history of the building. I would go again but order something different. Husband loved it."}
{"text":"2/16 update: second time back, don't know why but this time crab legs were on the salty side and smaller.  Did not enjoy it as much.  Going from 4 stars to 2 for inconsistency.   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  I cannot comment on their other menu items, because I have only tried their all-u-can-eat crab legs and they were GREAT!!  I think they charged us $21 or $23 per person, and the quality of the crab legs are way better than what I've tried around town.  The place is very interesting, feel very cozy.  We had to drive a long way from Cleveland Hts to get there but the crab legs were worth the drive.  They served the crab legs with a soup or salad, and two sides (I guess they attempt to fill you up with the sides so you can't eat that much crab legs).  We had the soup and salad, then put the sides in the to-go box and ate the crab legs like crazy!  The crab legs were large and they didn't make them too salty (like some other places around town) so we could actually enjoy them.  They only have this all-u-can-eat crab legs on Tuesdays, and we are going back again this coming Tuesday!  =)"}
{"text":"We will not return here again. Service was not very good. Free sushi night...sushi was hard and dry...and the waitress that I asked to refill the soy sauce dish acted like I was a huge bother to her. Our dinner was okay...overall Not impressed at all. Sorry to see that it has declined in service and food quality to the degree or has from our dining experience several years ago."}
{"text":"I just left the Easter Buffet and it was terrible in almost every way.  The service was very slow, the food was slow to be refreshed and stuff ran out and most the food was bland or over cooked.  They charged for every drink including pop and no free mimosas which are commonly given out for free.  The bacon was good, the ham and prime rib was very tasty.  There was so few choices of desert and most were old tasting or simple Danishes.  I'd go anywhere else for a special brunch."}
{"text":"Great place! We stopped in a Saturday around lunch and sat. There were a few others in there and it looked really nice inside. Since we had a 1 yr old with us we opted for the patio. The patio is a very cool area with plenty of space and trees all around. We both ordered burgers. They were great as were the fries they came with. We were in and out of there quick and for around $20. The staff was great, our drinks were never empty and they acted like they actually cared if we were happy. We are planning on going back sometime without the little guy so we can eat inside."}
{"text":"You have to keep up with the current state of the Taverne of Richfield, like watching the morning fix on silver from Zurich.  See, it changes, this time for the better.  Went to the basement open mic to see some really great musicians give it away.  Had a few bites of great food, downed a few great drinks, and overall had a very pleasant couple hours.  We'll head upstairs for a real sit-down in coming weeks, but I didn't want to leave my old, stale, out-dated review standing, when the new folks are working so hard and doing such a bang-up job.  (I know I shouldn't care so much about a restaurant, but I do.  This is one of the few places on earth that I really want to succeed.  Keep visiting, keep eating...)  \"There are no wrong notes.\" -- Thelonious Monk"}
{"text":"I took my boyfriend and my daughter here for Valentine's Day dinner. We went the day before to avoid the chaos and noise. Thursday's they have a customer appreciation menu with some great selections at reduced prices. We ordered the house hummus and it was FANTASTIC. Absolutely delicious. I crave it, in fact. Then my boyfriend and I each got a chopped salad. When it was brought out, we both looked at eachother and couldn't believe the size of it. It was a meal in itself and the house dressing was incredible. Him and my daughter both got chicken parmigiana which was delicious! And I got the chicken putanesca. I had never had anything like it. To finish the night off with a sweet treat we got the salted caramel ice cream. There are no words. We will absolutely be back. Serena, the owner, and her team have created something wonderful here! I would say our server seemed a bit out of sorts, like he was new. Serving didn't come off as something that he was \"a natural\" at. Or maybe he was just having an off night or there were other staffing issues that rolled over to other people. Regardless of this minor complaint, we will absolutely be back."}
{"text":"My dad and I had lunch here today and I want to start off by saying that this place has got some history. Been around before the old coliseum, where the Cavs use to play back in the day, and from what I've heard this place was always busy during that era. Nowadays, I have no idea.  Going for lunch, I wanted to find something a little different to eat and I'm glad we decided on this place. Got the (Grilled) Stuff Pepper Melt with their pasta salad. The sandwich was delicious - melted cheese, perfectly grilled bread, not to mention the sausage was perfect as were the peppers. Even the pasta salad side was great.  Only problem, I wish I had more! The portions aren't the biggest, but enough to leave someone satisfied for lunch but not over satisfied. The food was just so good,  I wish I could leave with a bloated belly.  The service was great, fast and friendly. The decor is definitely dated, but hey it's an old building. In reality, it always comes down to food, and if you are looking for a relatively cheap option for lunch with some different variety than your typical burger and fries, I would check this place out. I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"We held our office Christmas party and dinner in the upstairs space...outstanding! Jackie and her team did a great job of preparation and flawless service.  The food was very good as well.  I would recommend the Taverne for your event!"}
{"text":"What an awesome place!!  Been there a few times now.  I had the Taverne burger last night topped with a fried egg! Best burger i have had in a long time!!!  My friend ate the potato crusted walleye and said it was outstanding!  After dinner we went downstairs to the Martini Bar and listened to live music and had a few drinks.  Terrific service, friendly staff and a \"feel good\" atmosphere.  Highly recommended!!  :)"}
{"text":"Out of the way but worth it! Beautiful outdoor garden dining.  SeaFood was spot on.  Dipping oil was worth going to war over."}
{"text":"enough with the easter brunch already..there will never be a \"good one\" anywhere on earth; that being said i wonder if they still have the most wonderful, fabulous colonial style tavern down below in the basement area....it was the nicest place to hang and have a drink or two, cello music, snacks, candles, awesome......great food too."}
{"text":"We took my mom to lunch here on a Tuesday in early July.  We were the only people in the dining room.   We were all pretty happily surprised at this place.  The waitress was very nice and helpful.  The food was presented well and tasted good.  The dining room is really attractive.  After driving past this place on the way to mom's house for fifteen or so years, I'm glad we finally stopped in.  I'm not sure whether this would seem expensive relative to other places in Richfield, but for us it's reasonable and for the quality of the food, service, and setting.   We'll be back."}
{"text":"Crab legs!  All you can eat snow crab on Tuesday for $21.  I have to admit though, I am very bad at cracking those shells open (Just ask Joyce Y!).  I think I use up more energy than I consume by tying to get at the meat inside!  The crab comes with soup or salad, the daily vegetable, and some form of potato (mashed, baked, fries).  The crab itself would taste good if it weren't for the salty salty broth they used to boil the legs in.  Service was attentive, and the interior is cozy, kind of like eating at a ski lodge or something.  At the bar they had a guy playing country versions of popular songs.  You know you've heard it all when you hear a countrified version of a GreenDay song."}
{"text":"Hoped for a better meal. Everyone at our table ordered the ribeye and it was a miss.  Service was very good and place has charm. Kitchen needs help. Good for appetizers and bar food  Nice wine list. Had not been there in years and probably won't be back"}
{"text":"Very good, had lunch lobster bisque was very good.  Also had apple grilled cheese.  All very fresh, However the service was a bit slow (took about 40-50 minutes for lunch)"}
{"text":"My husband and I used Yelp to find good restaurants on a recent journey from Minnesota to the East Coast. We came across the Taverne of Richfield on Yelp by reading another recent review. We decided to try it, even though it was a few miles off I-80. Beautiful sprawling old building with a lovely outdoor terrace. Friendly and attentive service. Casual yet elegant (as we were traveling, we were in shorts and tee shirts and were nervous about a dress code -- not a problem). The food was wonderful. I had a beet salad with chevre and pecan encrusted chicken - both were exquisitely presented. Thanks to Jackie, our server, we had a very pleasant hour in the midst of a very long drive back to the East Coast. For all weary travelers who are in this area, I highly recommend getting off the Interstate and making a beeline to this treasure of a restaurant. I would love to return and maybe someday I will."}
{"text":"Tried the Taverne for first time this week, we were rather impressed. Had the Greek Salad with side of steak and their chicken parm. Quality of the food and portion is A+. We had thought a little pricey, but compared to Olive Garden it's just a dollar difference, so for the location it's also worth it. We did a pick up order and we're pleased with the staff on the phone (actually warned us about their large portions so we didn't order too much) and very nice on pick up.  Only gripe was we got two pieces of bread with the meal on one piece could have been substituted for a rock, literally shattered when my wife tried to break it with her hands. I get it was end of the night, but I would have been just fine with one piece which was edible."}
{"text":"Service a bit on the slow side for them not being so busy. I waited almost 10 minutes for a drink, 15 to 20 for my side salad and they brought me one roll in the bread basket,twice. I guess the waitress thought I could stand to loose about 10 lbs (I do) :-).  Funny review I spotted about dirty carpets, it's actually true. With the prices they charge they should cowboy up and replace more often or at least make a call to those fine folks at Stanley Steemer! Other than the carpets, the place has a cozy old hotel feel with pressed tin ceilings and a very classy ambiance.  I had the scallops. Very tasty sauce but the quality of scallops was a bit on the lower side (my fault for not being by the sea) and the largest one was not cooked all the way through. They offered a beer on the house which I gratefully accepted.  In all honesty I will likely not be back. There are other establishments I would like to try instead."}
{"text":"Went here with another couple for dinner last night.  Ambience is of old world charm mixed with a little oddity.  Thursday's happened to be Customer Appreciation Night with some reduced price food and drink.  We tried a few drinks from the menu--all were very good.  Next, the hummus with veggies--delicious!  I would highly recommend this.  We also tried the beet and the chop salads.  Both were excellent.  My GF and I split the potato-encrusted walleye entree.  They were nice enough to split the fish and make two plates.  The dish was amazing with cheese-topped brussel sprouts being perfectly done.  Highly recommend this.  The couple we were with had a filet and a pasta dish that they said were quite good also.  Moreover the service was exemplary.  All in all, a wonderful first time at this local restaurant.  Will be back most definitely!"}
{"text":"We had dinner here on a beautiful Tuesday evening .  We started with drinks and a cheese tray on the patio and then had dinner inside. It was a perfect combination and I would recommend doing this for a romantic dinner and evening. The food was amazing as were the martinis and wine."}
{"text":"I'm not sure where all the rave 4 and 5 star reviews came from. You can make a better burger and grilled cheese at home. Perhaps you might even have condiments at home (which they didn't offer us with our bone dry, under seasoned burger). We were left with empty water glasses at least twice while we shared the dining room with one older couple. I watched our waiter walk to that table 4 times before he came to ours. Perhaps if we had ordered a bottle of pricey wine we would have gotten better service. That's only the beginning. I ordered the French onion soup, which came without cheese or croutons on top. Just plain French onion soup... That was cold.. And very strong (bitter). The two stars is only because of the pommes frites. Yes, they managed to not screw up French fries. We don't live far but there are certainly far too many choices in driving distance to make the mistake of choosing this one again."}
{"text":"I took my wife to enjoy a romantic dinner and some live entertainment for our anniversary. Lovely ambiance, food was great, and the band was excellent. We were not the only ones celebrating...  There was a hot mess of a 50 something mother who thought she was as young as her youngest son who was (let's hope) at least 21. Who after a little bit of pre-game with her coworkers, she showed up after the band had been playing for at least a half hour.  The celebration of a 50 year olds birthday would have been fine if she wasn't dancing around with her newly gifted tambouring. She was so loud and annoying that even the acoustic band kindly asked that she stop. We had to leave before my wife had put that tambouring in an uncomfortable place for her. Don't worry we'll be back!"}
{"text":"I went here with a foodie meetup group of about 11 people. Happy Hour at the bar was good--the lemon fizz was delish. Then we went to the patio where it all fell apart. We sat at 2 tables and because some of our group had eaten inside, the server didn't bother to ask if ANY of us wanted menus. We sat a long time before questioning the apathetic server who said she thought we all ate. Uh, why would we have moved out here if we weren't planning to eat?? Finally we ordered and the food took so long we missed the tango lessons inside. I was starving!  The organizer of our group voiced her displeasure at the service and the mgr took her aside and accused her of being drunk! She wasn't...but was told a little while later that she was \"cut off.\" Then in front of the whole party, the mgr said to her that \"you were bitching at me.\" A mgr said that! I have never experienced such awful service--that may explain why the inside dining room was nearly empty.  This is all too bad because the food was good--the crab legs were perfect. I did ask for ketchup for the 6 fries that came with it...and it never came. Who serves fries with nothing for dipping?? And 6 fries?? Potatoes are cheap.  Please go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"If you are pathetic enough to have followed my Yelp reviews for any length of time (yes, I'm talking about you, Mom), you probably are sick of me reviewing the Taverne of Richfield. I've probably reviewed it a half-dozen times, each episode precipitated by another change in ownership or a new chef. It's open. It's closed. It's open again. The magic formula of how to separate the people of Richfield from their money has eluded this place time and time again. (Fortunately, I have been there each step of the way to make lewd, irreverent comments on the whole fiasco.)  So, I really hope this will be my last review of the Taverne. It certainly will be the most positive. Enter chef Jeff Fisher, formerly of Touch Supper Club.   Finally, finally....a bona fide talent in the kitchen. A chef and his cuisine worthy of ye grande olde Taverne. The new summer menu for the Taverne was released today. It is the most exciting menu anywhere around these parts. Jeff has formalized his influence on the direction the restaurant is heading, and the prospects are exciting. (The flaccid Ken Stewart's empire, with their virtual monopoly on fine dining in the Bath/Richfield/Peninsula/Hinckley complex, would be advised to take notice.)   Locavores will find plenty to rejoice in here, with a healthy injection of locally-sourced and seasonal foods throughout the new menu. (Jeff proudly brought out his Amish bee honeycombs to show me, for the new menu's almond panna cotta with honeycomb dessert. Kick ass, dude! ) He also likes to feature wild foods, such a freshly harvested wild leeks, when they're in season. The menu entrees are mostly classic steaks, chops, seafood, and pasta, but each with a unique Mediterranean- or Asian-inspired twist. He's performing a nice balancing act by giving the Taverne's traditional crowd something basically familiar (but often with a bold new ingredient to ponder) while also giving young foodies and locavores something to drool over, too. I think of his cooking as being straightforward, fresh and bold. There's usually not a lot of complex layering of flavors going on...nothing too foofy....but it's always well-executed and flavorful. (If I sound like a bit of wonk, well....the man catered a party of mine a few weeks ago, and I've been basically eating his frozen leftovers every day since then, so yes, guilty as charged. He's like my surrogate mother. )   Last night, we sampled the new menu, and ordered the lobster gnocchi. I usually stay away from shellfish/seafood/pasta combinations because they can be awful when poorly executed, but this was like a deliciously-deconstructed lobster bake, with the potato gnocci and corn providing a preview taste of summer, and blistered tomatoes punctuating it with freshness. It was hearty without being heavy. A real plate-licker.   We finished up with goat cheese ice cream and orange olive oil cake with blueberry compote. Yes, I said goat cheese ice cream. Chef Jeff clearly has an unhealthy obsession with goats and their lactations. (There is goat cheese everywhere on the menu, all courses, especially dessert.) Although this goat-centric worldview not a characteristic you would desire in, for example, a brother-in-law, it's something to be treasured when it comes to a chef. I love goat cheese. It's versatile as hell, and it makes dishes come alive. The goat cheese ice cream starts sweet like a golden vanilla, but trails off with that distinct goat cheese flavor, giving your dessert a savory quality that allows it to pair very nicely with any red wine imaginable. If you've got half-a-glass of cabernet leftover after you're done with your steak, it won't be wasted on this dessert. Very smart.  Throughout all these up and downs (and mostly downs) in the kitchen over the past few years, it's the Taverne building itself that has remained the consistent attraction. The historical old Victorian always provides a sense of elegance and tradition that is hard to find elsewhere. The bar and patio remain the most popular spots within the Taverne, with a friendly and boisterous energy during the evenings. It's a little country elegance in Shaq-ville.   Tremont hipsters: Take a break from inhaling those airborne industrial pollutants and come out here and breathe some fresh air in Richfield, where horses and cows live together in sin, and ice cream is made from goats. You won't regret the trip."}
{"text":"Came here with my Valentine. We were looking for a place we could dress up for but not pay $300 for a meal, drinks and dessert. The charm of this old house turned restaurant delivered a perfectly romantic evening. The lobster bisque was one of the best I've had (outside of true New England places of course). We both had pasta dishes, which were cooked to perfection. The drinks were well-made, and the dessert was rich and yummy. Service was okay (thus only 4/5 stars).  Definitely keeping it on the short list of places to return to! Looking forward to seeing their summer menu and checking out the Martini Lounge in the future."}
{"text":"You never know what you're going to get when you drive by a place, think to yourself \"That place looks interesting\", then you forget the name and actually drive to check it out a good couple of months later.    That's what happened, and well...I was pleased!  The whole drive there, I was thinking to myself, I hope this place actually exists and wasn't just an Insurance agency!  Yep, there it was, and it's named the Taverne of Richfield!    The valet gave us two options: Downstairs in the Taverne with a Jazz band or upstairs in the main dining area.  Jazz it was!  We walked down to the old basement, enjoying the cool air and the cool jazz beats.    In regards to food - I was pleased again!  I honestly had no idea if this would be a burger joint or a high-end dining experience.  It was much closer to the later, and we were delighted by the options.  I chose the scallops and my bf chose the lobster gnocci.  My scallops were amazing, finished off with a sweet and fruity sauce, that nicely complimented the dish.  I also had the pleasure of finishing off the gnocci which was more than enough to fill up one person.  The gnocci was hand-made, fluffy and just divine with the savory and creamy sauce.  I'd also like to mention that the wine-pours were very generous!    Overall, Wow!  I had no idea what to expect but I was impressed!  We hope to return soon!"}
