{"text":"I had the beat salad, short rib poutine and calamari and it was all very good. The portion size and value is great with polite service to match. It was only me dining so I had leftover which I can't wait to dig into later!"}
{"text":"This place is a gem . the food is amazing .portions are not huge but perfect for sharing . the service is so attentive too. And great drink list . will totally be going back . best tapas in Montreal"}
{"text":"Delicious tapas, generous portions for sharing, pleasant staff and stellar service!  We couldn't be more satisfied.  We sat outside - enjoyed the street view.  The owner stopped by our table to chat twice!  Recommend the fried cauliflower with truffle oil."}
{"text":"Nous avons particulièrement aimé le service. Les tapas sont généreux et vraiment bon prix; idem pour le vin.  Nous y retournerons."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious and wonderful service! Our favorites were the fried cauliflower, beet salad and the Scotch eggs. It's a perfect spot for an intimate dinner, or a great place to sample some tasty tapas with friends. If you're in the neighborhood, stop and sample!"}
{"text":"Bonjour! We are visiting Montreal and stopped in for dinner- so glad we did! Our waiter (who happened to be the co-owner) took the time to walk us through all of the dishes and make recommendations. The food was excellent- I recommend the croquettes and calamari as standouts- and service was impeccable. The atmosphere was homey and inviting. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Nice place but we dont feel is a 5 star restaurant. Service, food and place is nice but not wow. We order meatball, couliflower, cslimari, chorizo and croquete serrano, very sweet dessert (churros) which were good."}
{"text":"What a delightful surprise to have happened upon this charming restaurant!  We had never been to Montreal and chose it blindly after perusing the menu online.  Loved the variety and attention to detail.  The quail, cauliflower with truffle oil, short ribs and beet salad were amazing.  Prices very reasonable.  The atmosphere was so lovely--I wanted to stay all night.
The playlist was remarkable as well--the worldly combination of these fresh restaurateurs has given Montreal one of its finest dining experiences.

We shall definitely return!"}
{"text":"One of our new favorite place in Montreal !!! 
J'ai adoré! Ma nouvelle adresse pour souper dans une ambiance classe à un prix abordable. Beaucoup de style! Nous étions 2 samedi à 17h30 et nous avons félicité le personnel pour le travail en cuisine et en salle. 
La musique était au TOP, style lounge méditerranéen!
Nos papilles ont été ravies. Quelle surprise! Les pétoncles, les calmars, les crevettes étaient à tomber par terre! Je suis rarement dessert au resto... Alors là, Chapeau ! Les churros revisités étaient très bon!
Des prix super corrects. Et, détail d'importance qui nous fait donner une excellente note, c'est que l'espace toilettes est super propre et classe! 
Tous les 2 nous avons ADORÉ. Nous avions des étoiles dans les yeux en rentrant à la maison!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious and the presentation is impecable.  The restaurant has an eclectic atmosphere and it is family friendly.  We ordered the Croquetas de Serrano 4 times.  They were out of this world. The service is amazing! A gem!"}
{"text":"Excellent service!! every dish has its own distinct taste. The lobster croquetas was the best followed by closely by the crunchy, yet not too salty calamari. Any of the braised beef are good, make sure you soak the sauce up with the bread."}
{"text":"What a lovely find in Montreal. Lovely staff, quaint spot with exceptional food. 
Definitely worth a visit if you like tapas."}
{"text":"Wow! Quel bel accueil par le proprio qui nous a expliqué chaque plat et tout les plats étaient excellents! Du début à la fin, la fraicheur des aliments, gouteux et portions généreuses, on y retourne c'est certain! De plus la musique était parfaite, le personnel et l'ambiance. Quelle soirée exceptionnelle!!!

Wow! You have to go to that restaurant, the food is amazing, the staff is amazing, the ownner is amazing, the music is amazing, the portions are amazing...well what more can I say, an amazing evening we'll never forget, we're defenitly coming back!!!"}
{"text":"Nous sommes venus ici pour le dîner, pas d'attente pour obtenir une table, un serveur merveilleux et un service rapide. TOUS les tapas étaient incroyables."}
{"text":"Hautement conseillé! Je ne peux manger de gluten et le propriétaire a su nous conseiller sans hésiter! À découvrir !"}
{"text":"Le service est vraiment exécrable. Les tapas sont corrects, cependant, il a fallu attendre longtemps entre chaque tapas. Pourtant, il y avait 3 serveurs, le restaurant n'était pas bondé, prendre sa pause cigarettes lorsqu'il y a des clients, ce n'est pas acceptable. Ce n'était pas la première fois que nous y allions, mais je ne le recommande pas et je n'y retournerai plus."}
{"text":"We went out of the way to come here and it was definitely worth it. The food was amazing. We ordered four tapas for two people and it was very filling and satisfying. The drinks are amazing, the cucumber mojito was very refreshing and light. I'll be sure to return here the next time I'm in Montreal to try more of the menu! The service was great and the atmosphere was friendly. Definitely would recommend!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and friendly staff. Food was good, no complaints. Found a vegetable sticker in my salad unstuck to anything, so it didn't seem like unwashed veggies. Still ate the salad, has a nice vinaigrette dressing. Just a simple error and was comped for the salad. Ordered: Sorocco salad, short rib terrine, scallops, veggies of the day, shrimp, and scotch eggs. Scallops were likely the best of all the dishes, but for value, I would pick the short rib. For tapas the price is good, and you can order a decent amount of food for two for about $50."}
{"text":"Four of us went to Sorocco on a Saturday night and even though there weren't lots of people there, we had an amazing time and ate delicious food. The service was on point, the cocktails were great and very affordable, and we enjoyed a variety of tapas: truffle roasted cauliflower, croquetas de jamón, poutine, kefta sliders, chorizo, blue cheese salad, meatballs, roasted vegetables, etc. Not forgetting caramel churros!

Definitively recommend trying this place and the delicious bloody ceasars. I can't wait for the summertime to enjoy tapas and drinks on their patio!"}
{"text":"These tapas were delicious! We were able to try many of them: the lobster croquets, fried cauliflower with truffle oil, short rib poutine, and shrimps a la plancha. You need to try the short rib poutine, it was amazing! Yet all of them were!! We had the cucumber mojitos, which were so fresh, and we finished with the churros with chocolate. Definitely a memorable meal!"}
{"text":"An awesome find! I wish I had been there sooner. The portions are not big but delicious. I will definitely return for some lobster croquetas, perfectly fried calamari and a glass of bloody mary! The complimentary dessert cookie was the icing on the cake. I did love the lichie cocktail as well (i don't recall it's original name,my bad)."}
{"text":"In town for JFL show downtown. Searched Yelp to find this great little bistro. Reviews looked great and the idea of tapas sounded good. The reviews were spot on. Everything we ordered was fantastic and the service extraordinary. My only regret was we were constrained by the time of our show. Once I informed the waiter of our necessary departure time, he arranged the delivery of tapas in perfectly timed intervals that left us unrushed but ahead of schedule. The ambiance in this place lends to long evenings of sipping wine and trying another tapas. Next time no show just an evening with friends. BRAVO Sorocco!"}
{"text":"Sorocco is the place to be in Montreal. Being 1/2 of a young couple, we enjoyed the overall atmosphere, service, and price of the entire restaurant. The dim lighting, decorations, and entire ambiance felt very intimate--and created an illusion of expense. To our surprise, the food was very reasonably priced and affordable, everything felt as if it were a bargain.
The service was impeccable! A willing and kind host created a comfortable atmosphere and the server (who was the manager) delivered exceptional service. 
The food, to top everything off, was absolutely delightful. Server had an incredible recommendation to go light on the tapas due to the heavy portion size, and go for three tapas and a salad to share for two. It was absolutely perfect.
The calamari, to begin, was beautifully seasoned and breaded. It contained a sweet yet savory sauce. The highlight of the tapas was the cauliflower with truffle oil. The lightness contrasted exceptionally well with the heavy taste of other tapas.
Being tourists and finding this place on a whim was quite the fantasy. Highly recommend!
P.S: (Photos don't really do it justice due to the dim lighting.)"}
{"text":"Visiting Montreal and tried this place on a whim. It was one of the best meals I've ever had. Everything was A+. Flavors were legit. Bummed the owners can't open this up in Boston. It was so dang good. Can't recommend it enough. Chef deserves 5+ stars for her ability to provide such layers and depth of taste! Serrano ham croquets may have been my favorite... manchego cheese was awesome. Ugh gotta go back tomorrow and do it all over again. Goodnight."}
{"text":"Very friendly and welcoming place. We were a big group and liked all the tapas they brought us but one (paella) was not a hit with our group. The management was very quick to address this and offered amazing cookies made of pecan-caramel-chocolate. A nice gesture that was not necessary but extremely appreciated from our group! They have a few items that are vegetarian, cauliflower truffle is very good, they give a lot of olives, and the bread (baguette) tastes fresh and is crunchy. Don't forget to dip your bread in the truffle sauce, it's exquisite! This place is not too loud and is great for accommodating groups and people with various allergies by letting you know what you can consume and what you can't. Decor is warm and looks like a classic Italian restaurant."}
{"text":"Best tapas I've ever had. We were in Montréal for 3 days and got smoked meat and poutine, some of the more traditional dishes, but Sorocco was probably some of my favorite food on the trip. Everything was reasonably priced and delicious. 

We started with the Lobster croquettes, which I would have ordered another round if I wasn't so full. Next was the fried cauliflower with truffles - AMAZING! We also had the Fried Calamari, which comes with a sweet chili sauce that pairs perfectly, and ended with the vegetable medley. We also got the Cucumber Mojitos, which were surprisingly good, and a Bloody Caesar. I would have ordered it all again and gone back a 2nd time if we were there longer. Service was very friendly and helpful too."}
{"text":"Had a so so experience here. The good: portions are generous for tapas style, and prices are reasonable. The ham croquetas (3 per order) were nice and crispy on the outside and gooey on the inside. Very little ham, mostly a (tasty) bechamel sauce filled the little balls. But still our favorite of the night. The bad: service is very scattered, the owner welcomed us and explained the menu (a good thing), but was a little too forceful in insisting we try certain dishes. We don't like beets, but he insisted we must have the beet salad, and that he would bring us a small free side dish of the salad we really wanted to get (which never came), but we must have the beets. So we got the beets lol. In his defense, it was pretty good, but again, we don't really like the texture or taste of that veg and we ended up leaving almost half uneaten and picking out the yummy goat cheese. The ultimate vibe I got from this place is that it has a bit of an identity crisis. The calamari dish we ordered had a sweet Thai chili sauce. Why??? The calamari was ok, not super crispy like I prefer, and probably would have garnered a 4/5 from me if it had a good sauce, but this way, 3/5 at most. The short rib poutine was probably my least favorite, 2/5 because 1)the fries were soft, lame, and unseasoned, and 2) again, with the \"inventive\" mixing of different cuisines, had kimchi mixed into the pulled short rib and gooey cheese (the last twp ingredients being good on their own). Why why why? We also had the pil pil shrimp, which were 8 small shrimp in a garlic sauce. It was good but not great, and this one really deserve some crusty bread to sop up all the garlic sauce. There is also a scotch egg dish listed on the menu in a nod to the chef's background, which also seemed out of place to me. Lastly, we had the raved about cauliflower with truffle oil. My dining partner liked it, I felt it was nothing special, not seasoned or fried enough. A few tweaks could have made this a good dish.
Cocktails should also be avoided here. They are affordable but really light on alcohol. Your best bet is a bottle or glass of wine. The pours are generous on those. I can see this place being popular for a date night, since it's fun to share a bunch of dishes and it's affordable and has a liquor license. With that said, something was too off for me to want to go back, and the identity crisis rubbed me the wrong way."}
{"text":"This place was the perfect place to go for a last minute night dinner. Great staff, great food and a really really good cookie for a dessert. It's the one with caramel and it's Delicious. Some haters are gna say it's \"not awful\" or \"it's not bad\" but those haters don't know what's good for them. Or what's coming. Also, they probably wanted the churro. Make em eat the cookie and show em what's good!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing! We were in Montreal looking for apartments before our move there this summer and chose this place based on location and Yelp reviews. Although expectations were high, the restaurant exceeded expectations! We loved every. single. dish. What's more - portions are big for tapas and priced very reasonably.

I started with a cucumber mojito. The small pieces of cucumber were like bursts of freshness in my mouth!

The sorocco salad was made with extremely fresh vegetables and was topped with a generous portion of manchego cheese. The croquetas were crunchy on the outside with warm melted cheese inside. I have never had calamari like those here! The pieces were very meaty and cooked well, with breading to compliment, instead of overpower, the main feature. 

If you want one recommendation from the menu, definitely go for the fried cauliflower! I was worried we were getting too many fried items, but the cauliflower was not deep fried. It was cooked perfectly, with generous amounts of truffle oil.

We finished with the churros and, although good, I would highly recommend the house made cookie, which was served to us to sample. To call it a cookie does not do this dessert justice, in my opinion. It starts with a layer of dark chocolate, followed by caramel, and finished with a short bread cookie type base. 

We received excellent service from the owner of the restaurant who spent time welcoming us to Montreal and telling us about all of the things he loves about the city!"}
{"text":"What a fantastic tapas place! 
We were looking for our last dinner in Montreal when tapas came to mind and we found Sorocco on Rue St.Denis. 
We were early being the only customers in the place but we're old now and have to eat early so that never stopped us! 
There were lots of unique choices on the menu and our waiter cautioned us against ordering too much which we thanked him for later. Scotch eggs with chorizo was a lovely Spanish twist on the old Ecosse classic. Then came along mini burgers made with chicken and mediterranean seasoning and a fresh baked bun. We did get a beet and goat cheese salad, cauliflower seasoned with truffle oil and that was enough to call these little plates a FULL meal! At no point were we forgotten as more patrons came in with return visits to fill our glasses and invitations to stay and enjoy ourselves even after we'd paid our tab. A small bowl of sweets arrived despite our refusal to order dessert-what a nice touch (which we devoured anyways).
What else can I add here? The decor was thoughtfully chosen and the vibe of Sorocco was laid back and inviting. Oh and the prices were very fair considering the quality and service!"}
{"text":"An early Tuesday night in April, my family of 4 went to nearby Sorocco (we were staying in a nearby B&B for a week), for some tapas. We had the olives, house fries, meatballs, fried cauliflower, chicken sliders, marinated veges, and the fried calamari. The fried cauliflower (w/truffle oil) were great, and the calamari were quite different than I have ever had them, They were sliced not in rings, but in rectangles, which kept them light. The chef has a way with the fryer! Since we came early and Montreal seems to be a later night dining city, we chatted a bit with the owner Driss, who helped us select wines and talked a bit about his partner's techniques in the kitchen. Great place."}
{"text":"It was good, affordable and simple. They only lost a star because of the service wich was.. ordinary because of they were simply unexperienced. I'll definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Two things make this place special, creative ideas coming from the kitchen and genuine friendly service.  This is the sort of place that would quickly sort of feel like family, so very much wish this was a local place for me.  But at least we had a chance to enjoy the hospitality and yummy food during our vacation. 

The interior disinviting and stylish to my take.  We started with some great wine and got down to order interesting things.  Everyone raves about the cauliflower, and rightly so.  This is a nearly perfect treat.  I would order this every time no matter what!  The croquettes are nicely done and a good take on a traditional item.  The scallops were amazing as well. Nicely seared with a puree and lovely crisp and salty pork.  To be honest I can't remember if it was bacon or not, but the trick with the scallops is you need a bit of each item in the dish to make it work.  All three tastes combine make this a special dish, so be sure to eat it that way.  WE also had the short rib terrine which was fine, but not as wow as the other two things.  But this is also about exploring ideas, and sometimes it might not work for everyone, but the courage to try create non-traditional tapas and put them out there is appreciated.  A bowl of yummy chocolate brittle was a perfect way to end the meal.  Just wish I could go back and have more cauliflower and work my way through the menu.  

Locals, take note!  Go here and support them so when I come back to town I can again enjoy Claire's creations and Driss' friendly and joyful spirt."}
{"text":"Get there quick before this hidden gem becomes an overcrowded hot-spot. 

I read about Sorocco on MTL Blog and figured I'd give it a shot. Truthfully, it wasn't the first choice on our list, but none of the other places had space for a last-minute reservation. Our party of 4 arrived around 8 on a Friday night to an empty restaurant... literally, empty. We weren't sure what to expect, but were pleasantly surprised. In the true spirit of a tapas restaurant, we ordered a bunch of dishes to share:

Fried cauliflower with truffle oil: So simple, yet so delicious... 'nough said! 
Croquetas: This cheesy goodness was a nice bite, but could have used a little more seasoning to balance the deep-fried exterior.
Piri Piri shrimp: Perfectly cooked shrimp in a chili-based sauce... I'll be back for more of that!
Meatballs: Super moist meatballs in a sauce approved by Italians! Ask the waiter for extra bread to soak up the leftover sauce. You won't regret it. 
Scallops: I'm a big fan of scallops. These were cooked exactly as they should be, but they were missing a little something. Not my favorite dish, but definitely a strong contender with a little fix.
Scotch eggs: Deep-fried, chorizo-wrapped quail egg with a cherry sherry sauce... It was the perfect balance of sweet and salty with a touch of heat and a well-cooked quail egg. Definitely one of the top dishes. 
Niçoise Salad: Surprisingly, really good. They served the salad after all the tapas had come. The salad was really light and had a nice acidity to cleanse the palate. I highly recommend it. 
Seafood paella: Having been to Spain, I've eaten my fair share of paella from different regions. I had really high expectations for the paella at Sorocco, but it certainly fell short. The rice was excellent but could have used a little more flavor. It was really the seafood that left me underwhelmed. Like the scallops, a couple small changes will make this dish a big hit.  

Sure, there is room for improvement but, in its entirety, the food was delicious and we didn't leave hungry. We especially enjoyed how each item was brought out separately. It gave us the opportunity to taste each tapas without feeling rushed to get to the next one. We'll be back soon to try the menu items we missed! 

Without a doubt, the service was impeccable. The owner took the time to explain the menu, the waiter was knowledgeable and attentive to detail (filling up water before we had the chance to realize our water was empty, changing plates between the tapas and the main dishes, etc.), and they were both courteous. Seeing as we were the only table in the restaurant for the better half of our meal (a party of about 15 people came to the restaurant just as we were half way through), the real question is how well they will handle a full house (the restaurant seats about 50 people, with a few more at the bar). 

The restaurant has only been open for a few months, so they are still working out a few details (a cocktail menu, for example). Being in a prime location on St. Denis, I'm sure they'll do just fine, especially when they open their terrace in the summer."}
{"text":"Loved loved loved this place. We got a bottle of wine and three tapas for two people and it was enough for us. HAVE to try the cauliflower dish - so delicious. Reasonably priced for how great the food is. Will definitely be back next time in Montreal."}
{"text":"I found this gem on yelp during our baby moon to Montreal. We took our local uncle out to dinner. What an amazing experience! We had 5 tapas between three people and it was plenty! We started with the croquetas and beet salad. Very tasty! The favorites were the kofta sliders, shrimp, and cauliflower. I really liked the scotch eggs. What a treat! Ambiance was great, staff were very helpful, and everything was made with attention to detail and love. Thanks for the wonderful dining experience. Great to have tapas done well at reasonable prices. Looking forward to another visit."}
{"text":"Très bien accueillis par Ben et son équipe! Le service était très agréable et la bouffe bonne, surtout le choux fleur et les pétoncles. Et les calamars. Et les croquetas. Et le dessert au chocolat, caramel et fleur de sel :-) 
On y reviendra. Souvent!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner last night with a group of 6. Chose restaurant in large part based on the Yelp review. Did not disappoint. Great service and the food was solid. Tapas style. Some modern takes. Chicken burger sliders spiced like harissa. Great calamari with a sweet chili sauce. Roasted Cauliflower with truffle oil. And the lobster croquettes which were mentioned in an earlier review. All were really good. Highly recommend and agree with 5 star rating."}
{"text":"It can be really easy to miss the Sorocco experience on the busy St-Denis street. This establishment provides a Tapas style menu that I shared with my buddy. Here's my feedback :

Calamari - Out of this world good!!! 5/5. The calamari were prepped PERFECTLY. Crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. I was addicted to their slightly spicy Thai sweet sauce. It still resonates with me how GOOD it was.

Poutine Bravas - Mediocre. 2/5. Truth be told we ordered this for the Bravas name and not for the poutine. I loved eating Bravas potatoes while visiting Spain and while the sour cream and sauce were right putting it in a.... poutine was a letdown. Also it was slightly cold which makes a poutine experience less than desirable. Please consider Bravas fries.

Fried Cauliflower in Truffle Oil - Very good. 4/5. Originally just OK but my appreciation for this dish changed the more I ate it!

Paella for 2 - Very good. 4/5. The plate is very generous and could easily feed 4 people! I love paella and the dish hit the spot minus the rice tasting a little under-cooked.

Cucumber Mojito - Average. 3/5. It held too much alcohol and not enough taste to make me enjoy a cucumber Mojito. Truth be told, the tapas outshined this drink.


For dessert...


Caramel Sale, pecan chocolate cookies : Perfect! 5.5. That sweet and sour taste was the real deal. It was provided on the house, so kudos for that!

Mini-Churros with caramel sale : Very good! 4/5. Would give 5/5 if it wasn't mini.....mini and standard size taste quite different. It was crunchy but I like the softness of the inside and it was missed.


Service was great all night long. Our waitress was sweet and made the whole experience very welcoming. 5 STARS!

Price tag is about $40 per person which gives it decent value. I expect tables of 4 can really try out a huge amount of dishes.

In conclusion, an experience you must have. Would go back!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and amazing ambiance! We were served by the owner who truly loves his food. I'm a enthusiastic foodie and love to try new food and when I tried this restaurant I was blown away. Plus the prices are really reasonable and we drank 30$ bottles of wine (!!!!!) Great place for a date since it's dimmed but good to go for great food for your cash! Will definitely go back again and again!"}
{"text":"We came to Montreal for a bachlorette party weekend.  The food and service were amazing!  The staff were very accommodating and explained everything.  My favorite dish was the lobster croquette (as all the ladies in my group knows :)  The owner was generous and offered drinks to our bride to be.  If I ever make it back to Montreal, I would come here again to try their other dishes."}
{"text":"Great Tapas house. From the playlist to the imaginative menu, everything was top notch!"}
{"text":"What a delightful place to have dinner. Super friendly co-owner is a one man show. He was our waiter, the bartender and oversees it all with grace. The ambience is intimate, dim-lit and also has outdoor seating. The food is delicate and flavorful. We had the fried cauliflower (scrumptious), lobster croquetas, and the shrimp (spicy and delicious, I added a bit of lemon juice to mine). We also had the beet salad which had a generous portion of goat cheese on it and was my husband's favorite. The pineapple lion cocktails (2) were our choice for drinks; which were really good as well. The value of the entire meal was super, 3 tapas 1 small salad and 2 drinks under $50 :)"}
{"text":"Excellent service and food. Had such a nice time here. Tried the lobster croquet and shrimp tapas and both were delicious. The person who seated us (maybe owner or manager of the place??)was also very friendly and super nice. The waitstaff was also great. I'd highly recommend this place for anyone looking to grab a bite in this neighborhood."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant!!! First time and not the last. Amazing food, great service and lovely ambiance. I loooove the music :)"}
{"text":"The tapas we shared at this new Moroccan-Scottish restaurant were just what we were looking for on an early Montreal evening. The friendly owners checked in on us and the space was cozy and inviting."}
{"text":"Had a great meal at this lovely spot in Mont Plateau.  Had the calamari, cauliflower and the lobster coquettes. All exceptionally good. Would definitely visit again when we are back in Montreal. Excellent service by one of the owners. Tres bien!"}
{"text":"The food was absolutely out of this world: we were a table of five fussy eaters, and we loved everything we ordered. What really made this so special, though, was the ambiance and the great service. The owner made us feel so welcome, and if we weren't just visiting Montreal, we would be going back here on a regular basis. Great value as well."}
{"text":"Went here on a Thursday night when in town for my bachelor party.  The owner, Ben, was one of the coolest people we met while in the city.  We practically ordered 2 of everything on the menu and all the tapas were absolutely delicious.  The warmth and attention the owner showed our group was also wonderful.  Highly recommend this spot for delicious tapas."}
{"text":"This little gem was a few doors down from the Airbnb at which a friend I were staying during a recent trip to Montreal. We were looking for good food and atmosphere within a close walk from the apartment. Food here was great (we had the croquetas, cauliflower, and calamari - Thai dipping sauce was amazing!) music was great, and service was outstanding. The owner was so welcoming, friendly, and attentive. Definitely worth a return visit next time I'm in Plateau-Mont Royal."}
{"text":"Just had a fabulous meal here. Great service and great food. The cauliflower is not to be missed. Also fantastic were the chicken sliders, the tomato blue cheese salad and the lobster croquettes. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Menu: tapas et repas, choix intéressant et variés 
J'ai commandé olives, chou-fleur frit à l'huile de truffes, croquetas, calmars frit, un verre de vin et un blody cesar. Je dois dire que c'était beaucoup, mais j'avais envie de tout essayer! 
Bref, j'ai été déçue du chou-fleur... L'huile de truffes ne goûte pas du tout. J'étais hésitante à le prendre, je me suis fait dire que c'est une de leur spécialité ou meilleur vendeur, mais j'ai trouvé ça un peu fade en saveur et beaucoup trop salé. Par contre, j'ai ADORÉE les croquetas, le mélange de textures et de saveurs excellent! Les calmars étaient bien, sauce sucrée piquante (sans être très fort, mais juste assez). Olives... Ben c'est des olives! 
Suggestion ne prenez pas tout ces plats ensemble, car c'est très salé, il manquait une balance, mais ça c'est ma faute!
Service: impeccable! De A à Z j'ai eu un très bon accueil, bon explication du menu, bon suivi, souriants, et ce de la part de tous les employés. 
Terrace: c'est petit, mais plaisant. Désavantage pour les non fumeurs, les gens sont autorisés à fumer.
Ambiance: agréable, ni trop bruyant ni sans ambiance, beau décor chaleureux moderne... Je ne sais pas si ça ce dit, mais bref c'est sympa!"}
{"text":"Very nice small place. Everything we had was tasty. The service was very good as well. Very good value. Not expensive"}
{"text":"Excellent! We came here for paella and although quiet disappointed that it's no longer on the menu, everything else was absolutely amazing. Every single tapas plate exceeded our expectations above and beyond. Croquetas are a must! The atmosphere is very welcoming and the owner genuinely cares for his craft and his clients. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great attention from the staff. Nice atmosphere. Cauliflower and croquettes must definitely be tried. Would visit again."}
{"text":"We just finished up dinner at Sorocco and I was blown away. We had the beet salad, shrimp, short rib and fried cauliflower and they were all delicious. The service was exceptional, with wait staff on hand to very quickly remove empty plates, refill water glasses and replace our plates with fresh ones after the salad. We accidentally ordered something with something I'm allergic to in it on the recommendation of our server and when he realized, he went way out of his way to accommodate and ensure that I had what I needed to be fully satisfied with my meal. It was truly lovely of him and went way above and beyond what I would expect. I would highly recommend Sorocco to anyone in Montreal or anyone passing through. The food was absolutely delicious, the service levels phenomenal and the decor was really nice as well! Thanks so much to the staff at Sorocco for a wonderful evening."}
{"text":"Hidden gem!! The place has virtually no curb appeal and you'd miss it if you wouldn't know where to look for it. That aside, it's truly a gem. The tapas were the best we ever had! Every dish we ordered exceeded expectations. Well prepared, great flavors, good portions. Even our kids, who are very picky eaters, found something they liked. Waiters were knowledgeable and one was being funny with our 13 year old. We all had a great night with amazing food. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Didn't know what to expect. Lovely restaurant with outstanding food. Lobster truffle croquettes were fantastic!"}
{"text":"Went here with my friend on a quiet Tuesday night. Our waiter (which I later learned was one of the owners of the restaurant) was very nice and explained the concept to us, and took us through the menu. He even let us sample a few of their wines to help us decide which one we wanted.

We ended up ordering the house salad (delicious dressing, and sprinkled with manchego) , croquetas, cauliflower and their special poutine (with tomato sauce and cheese). They were all equally tasty, but I must recommend the cauliflower and the 'poutine'. 

The waiter kept checking in on us, and constantly refilling our water. Although we were completely stuffed by the end of the meal, I am happy that we found some extra space for some complementary pieces of dark chocolate with caramel and seasalt. What a treat! 

All in all we had a really nice experience dining at Sorocco - good value for money, interesting menu and great service!"}
{"text":"Delicious tapas with a delightful host at a wonderful price. Two  out of four in our party are gluten free and our host was able to very quickly recommend which items are prepared gluten free. The gluten-full two shared three plates: fried calamari, ham croquetas and poutine with short-ribs. The croquetas and flavorful short ribs were outstanding and the calamari with Asian inspired dipping sauce was delicious. The gluten free folk shared the delicious spicy shrimp, the fried cauliflower and the sausage, as well as a small salad. All were prepared perfectly it was truly the perfect amount of food for the four of us."}
{"text":"A small friendly neighborhood restaurant serving Spanish-style tapas. I would call it a hidden gem in the Mont Royal area, lying fairly north of downtown Montreal. 

For drinks, we got cucumber mojitos. Such a good choice! It was super refreshing and I loved that there wasn't too much alcohol and we can actually taste the cucumber instead of being overwhelmed by the taste of rum. 

With a wide selection of tapas, you really cannot go wrong. The lobster croquettes and fried cauliflower were my absolute favorite! The croquettes were cooked to a crispy perfection on the outside, creamy on the inside- absolutely remarkable. The cauliflower was coated in truffle oil and cooked with finely minced mushrooms and scallions. A little squeeze of lemon on top for a bit of acidity and you've got an unique dish that is bursting with flavor.  

The calamari was served with a sweet and spicy dipping sauce that is far from the traditional marinara or tartar sauce. I love that they added their own spin to a well known and well loved dish. The poutine was an overload of short rib, gravy and starchy goodness. 

To top off a great meal, the churros are an absolute must. With a choice of dulce de leche or a chocolate sauce, the churros are a delicious crunchy sweet treat that will satisfy any sweet tooth.

This place was absolutely amazing and was so well priced! I was quite shocked at how low the bill was at the end of the night. 120% recommend Sorocc to anyone in Montreal!"}
{"text":"Amazing place for dinner! The food was great and the service was impeccable.

We were a large party of 12 celebrating my friend's bachelorette. Rather than order off the menu, the manager explained that he could help us order since we were a large party and he could help us with the quantities. He did a great job! We had more than enough food and the bill was a reasonable split.

Highlight of the meal: the lobster croquettes. So delicious. I think we could've done with a few more orders of it! I also really enjoyed the beet salad, the cauliflower and the charcutterie platter with marinated (pickled) vegetables. We also had many pitchers of the red sangria, which was amazing! 

To cap it all off, we had the churros with caramel sauce and some sort of dark chocolate/caramel/saltine brittle. Both very good. 

Definitely would recommend this place for a night out!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here in our last night in Montreal and this place is amazing !!! The service is perfect, the food is so delicious. We order several tapas but my favorite was their poutine fries  !!!! OMG I'm still dreaming about. This place is highly recommended, it was so romantic just what we need it on our last night in Montreal ! 
Hidden Gem for sure !"}
{"text":"A group of us met at Sorocco after reading the reviews and wanting to explore the Plateau area. Our host  and wait staff were helpful and attentive from the beginning. The beet salad and Serrano croquettes were among our favorites and we were pleased with the affordable prices. We needed a cab to return to our neighborhood and the host called 4 companies to find one for us.  It was way beyond the usual level of service."}
{"text":"It was a sunny warm Sunday and I was walking on a busy St-Denis street looking for a terrace where I could have some drinks with friends. If you know St-Denis well as I do, you know it's not an easy task to find a good spot because it sure does gets crowded on the weekends. And to my surprise I found this place with a small but cute terrace and even nicer decor inside.

Their menu consist of tapas with a Scottish/Moroccan touch (because of the owners) and the food is wonderful! The service is also amazing, when we asked if they had a sangria, they made a very nice fruity sangria for us even though it wasn't on the menu just yet. 

I was really impressed with the service, the food and so did my friends. This place is surely on my \"places to go on sunny weekends list\"."}
{"text":"The service was attentive and very friendly deserving of five stars. The atmosphere was very much in line wth the neighborhood. Nicely priced. We ordered the beet salad, olives, short rib poutine, fried cauliflower, and calamari. 

A set back is the order the dishes came out. It should be lightest to heaviest. The poutine was brought out in the middle which was jarring to the palate and harder to pair wine. The short rib poutine was the best dish. The combination of savory meat with sweet salty kimchi was delicious. However, the beet salad was just beets and goat cheese. A two note dish. Lacking a bed of greens. The fried cauliflower with truffle oil while a good effort lacked the sweet acid to elevate it such as a balsamic vinegar or lemon juice. Calamari was cooked perfectly and accompanied with a nice spicy sweet and sour sauce. Would have been nice if served in a shallow dish so it not infringe on the crispy calamari."}
{"text":"Among the best meals I had here in Montreal. Every tapa we ordered was delicious. Our favorites were the fried cauliflower, croquetas and Sorocco salad. The owner was great and the staff very friendly. And reasonably priced!! - writing this yelp review for a reason - eat here!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem in the plateau.  The food is delicious!  As a group we got to try many different dishes which were explained in detail by the servers.   Must haves are the croquettas, cauliflower, calamari, beef terrine and beet salad.  Save room for dessert because the sweet/salty biscuit bark isn't to be missed.  This restaurant is extremely reasonably priced.  I can't wait to go back and try everything else."}
{"text":"Nothing to not like about this place! The owner is really sweet & makes you feel welcomed. For drinks, I had pineapple lion, which was really nice. We ordered cauliflower, lobster croquettes, shrimp and kefta mini burgers. 
The owner highly recommended the croquettes and he wasn't wrong, they're sooooo good. The cauliflower is scrumptious as well. The other two things were good as well but not as good as the croquettes and the cauliflower. 
My husband & I especially loved the churros with Nutella. I wish I could have them right now"}
{"text":"We were in Montreal 3 days and came here twice. Sorocco is a cozy restaurant (with outdoor seating) on a strip with lots of shops and restaurants. We never waited long to be seated and service was prompt and attentive. 

We ordered the house salad, veggies, calamari, meats, truffle cauliflower (takes a while to come out but well worth the wait) and some other apps. Food was very good and we were stuffed before the cauliflower came out. 

On the 2nd visit, we each ordered the cauliflower to avoid sharing, haha. 

Cocktails were good, too. Great restaurant in the Mount Royal area."}
{"text":"Sorocco has the best tapas, even better than those I've tasted in Spain!  Calamari is the best while the fried cauliflower, lobster croquettes, and spare ribs poutine are all very tasty!  Service is excellent and owner Ben even gave us a complimentary cucumber mojito.  The place is cozy and the ambience is great."}
{"text":"I went to Sorocco for my bday. We were around 15 people. They took charge and brought us food until we told them that we were full. Great amount of food for tapas + end with yummyy churros. Not really expensive either!"}
{"text":"Great service great food delish !!!! Really great choice in the variety offered and very particular with both Scottish and Moroccan influence."}
