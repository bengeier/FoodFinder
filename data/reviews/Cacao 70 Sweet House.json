{"text":"We found this place by surprise and we're slightly disappointed. My fiance got an Americano chocolate frappé but it tasted very watery. But the nice surprise was the waffle with the dipped ice cream cone, toasted marshmallows and pieces of tiramisu. It was mouthwatering and enough to share between 2 people. Service was good, the waiter was very accommodating. If you go, avoid the drinks! Take the waffle instead ;)"}
{"text":"The place is gorgeousssss, my buddy and I went for dessert post shopping.She had the Frappé matcha which was deliciousssss.The matcha taste was very present. I  had the waffle! The cocobo combo it was pretty massive!!! For the 1st time in my life I didnt finish my dessert.... I had to let the icecream cone go!!  The waffle itself was just ok not the best but I had waffle in Liege the mother place of waffle! So I am difficult with my waffle they makedl in  MTL but overall I enjoyed it! My chocolover self was satisfied.I will most likely go back!!

{"text":"Excited to learn about this Cacao 70 opening but let down as it was nothing like the one I've been to downtown Mtl.

Located near door #4 of Galeries D'Ajou,  this is a beautiful space with fresh and light decor, the restaurant has a tropical vibe and will surely do well during warm weather as the windows/doors open up entirely to the outside.

This sweet house offers counter service where you pay and order in advance as opposed to full table service you would get at the other locations. The menu featured on the wall is limited and much of their dessert or breakfast options are featured elsewhere on a paper menu. Upon entering we see that there is a lot of staff behind the counter however no one really present at the entrance to greet people or explain how it works. It was crowded for a Friday evening and I wish, especially with this new concept, that there was some sort of hostess to hand out menus or explain the offerings. I had to look at other tables and find my own menu. 

We settled for a shareable plate for 2 people described as a mix of a chocolate \"pizza\" covered with marshmallows, brownies, ice cream and wafers. For $17 I pictured a pretty generous portion of food but as soon as it arrived, I was questionning if it was the right dish as the portion was very small. You get about 4 tiny squares of brownies about 1 cm wide and only 1 scoop of a plain vanilla ice cream (not even the soft serve!), two skinny wafer sticks that look like they are from the dollar store and the \"pizza\" is a small quarter about the size of my hand.

I also ordered a cold frappe drink that was $6.50 and although prominent in chocolate, it was nothing special.

Paying almost $30 for two people for a very small chocolate dessert plate and beverage seemed excessive. 

There are similar competitors such as Juliette & Chocolat or Chocolat Favoris that are offering more generous experiences therefore I think this Cacao 70 really needs to change, either prices go down or portions go up. I can't justify eating here again until then."}
