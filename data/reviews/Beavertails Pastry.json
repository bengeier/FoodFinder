{"text":"This place is always extremely busy!! That's because it's AWESOME ! 

When you first walk in, you may get a tiny bit frustrated with the long line, but the thought of the gooey goodness of beavertail in your mouth keeps you in line, waiting for your turn. Once you get your order in, the wait is not much longer, as the beaver tails are prepared pretty quickly.

They are freshly made, in house. You can split the toppings! The view on the deck, overlooking the lake is beautiful. Or, you may opt to stroll down the harbour instead. Whatever you decide, beavertails at the downtown harbour front are a must every time I am down there!"}
{"text":"Quaint little place, very nice atmosphere, the beavertails were AMAZING. 

I'm a New Jersey native and a girlfriend from New York came up to Toronto for the weekend and we decided to try Beavertails and we were so impressed, we came back three times! 

Keep it up!"}
{"text":"I watched Sammuel and Audrey's video on youtube and they were talking about Beavertails in Toronto. It was true, Beavertails Toronto has lots of different flavors. I tried Gelato and Beavertail. Gelato was average. Beavertail with Apple cinnamon was so good. Fried donuts sounded high calories, but it was not so fatty. It is like funnel cake.  It was so delicious."}
{"text":"The beaver tails are made fresh each order. Simply delicious! I've come three times over the last three days-just that awesome. The ice cream is also very tasty. My favorite flavors are the Skor cheesecake and the cookies and cream -half and half. Very friendly staff as well, which makes this place a delight!"}
{"text":"It feels like most Canadians don't know about this place (at least the ones I've talked to) and we almost didn't go to the place but I'm sooooo glad we did. The same as everywhere we went in Toronto the people here were sooo pleasant and accommodating. The beaver tail is like a light funnel cake and was so good."}
{"text":"This place is packed! ahhhh \"beaver tails\". Heavenly deep fried dough with Nutella and banana....nom nom nom 

well that's sums it all folks. Grab it and Enjoy it by walking around harbour front."}
{"text":"Tried a beavertail for the first time a couple weeks ago and loved it! Only problem was I found a hair on mine, but they quickly replaced it and gave me a beverage while I waited."}
{"text":"You really wouldn't expect it, but these guys make a damn good poutine. Nothing like that Smoke's crap where all they do is smother the fries in meat to mask the fact that they're flavourless. They only offer basic poutine, but it's all you really need when it tastes this good.

The main attraction is obviously the Beaver Tails, and they're as good as always. I'm surprised it has taken them this long to get an actual store up and running in Toronto. For the longest time, you could only get it at ski resorts and places far beyond the GTA. They really need to expand, because the demand sure as hell is there.

Only thing I will say about this particular store is the seating is a problem. They could've picked a larger venue, but it is what it is. You may or may not have to enjoy your food by the lake, which isn't a bad thing except for when it's pouring rain or in the middle of January."}
{"text":"What is a Beavertail? Only one of greatest desserts ever! It's basically a doughnut in the shape of a beavers tail, only each one is made hot and fresh to order with your choice of topping. I of course couldn't decide on which one to try so the nice gentleman behind the counter offered to give me a half and half tail. I ended up going with half Oreo and half chocolate hazelnut with Reeses pieces on top. Can we say amazing!

While I really don't understand how Beavertails   haven't made their way to the U.S yet one things for sure. I'll definitely be back the next time I'm visiting Toronto."}
{"text":"Honestly a little too sweet for my liking but I should have expected that getting the triple threat beaver tail, since it was covered in Nutella, If I go back I think I may opt for a different flavor, but regardless it was good, service was quick, good location ....if you love sweet you will love this place"}
{"text":"Beaver tail is pretty much a flatten donut with customizable toppings! It's deepfried, crispy and if you have that sweet craving then this place definitely does the job well. This location particularly is quite small with a tight space and very few seats to sit and enjoy."}
{"text":"Must try if you're in Canada.
Great location by the waterfront. Busy place.
You can select to get a your pie split in half.
We've tried the Triple trip, the maple butter, Banana chocolate and Avalanche.
They were all amazing.
The triple trip was my favorite."}
{"text":"What's a beaver tail? Well for all you donut lovers...you'll love some beaver tail...because beaver tails are donuts shaped like a beaver tail, but not tough like a beaver tail, and covered in, your choice of several sweet sprinkles, sauces, sugars are fruits.  How many times did I say beaver tail?
A lot, because I loved my beaver tail...I did maple sauce with bananas...my beaver tail didn't last long...
Last word of advice, grab tons of napkins, because beaver tails are messy..."}
{"text":"We took a tour in Toronto, and our tour guide pointed out this place as we drove pass.  She told us how beavertail is a favorite of hers and it is usually only available in the winter, but now that they opened up a storefront here, they can enjoy it all year around.  The reason why it is called a \"beavertail\" is that the dough is shaped just like a beaver tail.  I thought it was such an adorable name, it's so Canadian!  I was intrigued, and made a beeline for this place right after our tour.  I LOVE sweets, and I always make a point to try the local desserts no matter where I am.  

My first impression of this place was that it is charming.  I love the pendant lights hanging from the ceiling, and the view is fantastic as it is right on the waterfront (as indicated by its name).  However, the service was extremely disorganized with multiple lines started to form as the staff members did not give clear instructions.  There were people waiting in line by the cash register, in front of the ice cream display and on the side of the counter.  Regardless of the confusion, I finally found my way to the right line and placed an order for the chocolate and banana version of the beavertail.  

Despite the initial disorganization, there were a lot of staff behind the counter and orders came out extremely fast.  I was surprised at how big my beavertail was!  The dough was perfectly crispy and just the right amount of sweetness.  I probably could do with less chocolate sauce, but the banana was a nice complement.  Overall, I loved my first experience with a \"beavertail\", and if we had more time, I would've loved to come back to try the plain version with cinnamon sugar.  I will definitely be back the next time I am in Toronto."}
{"text":"So good! Definitely a must-try when in Canada - plus, this location is great!

I hadn't had one of these in such a long time since they weren't so easily available - I would only ever see them at festivals and other special events... but having a location in downtown Toronto is amazing.

They are made fresh to order and are delicious no matter what kind you get. I wanted to change it up and try the sundae since I've never had it before, but unfortunately it wasn't available when I went. I ended up getting the chocolate hazelnut, which was just as good as I had remembered. If you want to indulge a little more, they have several other flavours like Triple Trip (chocolate hazelnut with Reese's Pieces), Coco Vanil (basically cookies n' cream), and Avalanche (Skor Cheesecake).

Staff were friendly and it was ready in less than 2 minutes. There is limited seating inside, but it's located right at the harbour so it makes for a  perfect snack while sitting by the lake or going for a walk.

Make sure to eat it while its warm!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love beavertails! And if you're in the downtown area by the waterfront you can enjoy it by the water! I would recommend this dessert for people who don't know what it is. Simple fried dough goodness that is coated with various options  like Nutella, or cinnamon sugar. If you're going very adventurous on what to top it off here's skors or Reese pieces! 

I usually have beavertails during the winter, but during the summer is so much better! It stays warm and fresh to eat!"}
{"text":"I was a little skeptical when we first walked in but this is an awesome surprise. If you love donuts and elephant ears this is your place. 
My husband had a beaver bite which is fresh donut holes covered in frozen yogurt and Carmel, omg yum. I had a smoothie with fruit and berries and they gave us a \"beaver tail' to try. Very friendly people and yummy!"}
{"text":"Yes. Yes. Yes. If you do not have a sweet tooth, do not get the Oreo or the skor. The employees were super nice and they were not stingy with the toppings. They came to $7.50 each."}
{"text":"Considering that this is a tourist trap, in a super touristy area, the Beavertails is actually a very decent spot. I've been there a few times, over the years, and again, considering the facts above it's quite alright. Toronto has better ice-cream to offer, but this is the waterfront, and so it's nice to have something refreshing after a long walk."}
{"text":"Beaver Tails. Quite the name, really. Don't you think.

Beaver Tails are one of my fave things about Ottawa. I first tried the location at the Byward Market about 10 years ago and have been back many times since. I've also had them in good old Niagara Falls ON and in Toronto. This particular location makes them perfectly well and deliciously, however their business hours are extremely limited, and they seem to be completely closed in winter, so for that reason they score 4 instead of the usual 5 I give to these amazing delights.

When you finally get to try one, have the regular (with lemon and sugar), they're freaking incredible. Make sure you eat it hot and fresh or it's not even worth it."}
{"text":"I felt super Canadian when I ordered the maple syrup spread beaver tail, all the while enjoying the view of the Lakeshore (and playing Pokemon Go). The maple syrup spread was perfection - just the right amount of sweetness and finger-licking good! I'll definitely be coming back again to try more flavours!"}
{"text":"For being always packed the service is quick and courteous. And the food is super delicious. And I don't need to drive to Ottawa to get one!"}
{"text":"Made the mistake of ordering the beaver bites. I saw that the bites were not made fresh to order but were only reheated in the oil. My order came out oily and soggy

I'll just stick to the traditional beaver tails next time"}
{"text":"This place is in a stellar location! 3 stars right off the bat for that. It's right on lakeshore and there are plenty of places to sit nearby with an awesome view of harbour front and billy bishop airport. Since the weather is finally getting warmer now, it is definitely the place to go! 

I love beaver tails. For those of you who don't know what a beaver tail is, it is usually a sweet dessert that involves deep frying a piece of dough and spreading whatever you like on top. Usually my go-to beaver tails are with Nutella or just the plain old cinnamon and sugar! Both are amazing and I've had them for many years now.

I wanted to try something new today so I got the beaver bites. Instead of like a flat piece of fried dough, they're like bite size balls of beaver tails - it's basically fried dough. Then, you get the option of gelato or frozen yogurt on top of that and there are more flavours of gelato at this location than frozen yogurt (vanilla, chocolate, or mix/swirl). I got the frozen yogurt this time (no particular reason). 

The beaver bites with frozen yogurt... I'm gonna be really honest, I thought it was going to be mind blowingly awesome but it wasn't. The beaver bites didn't really taste of anything other than fried dough, but the frozen yogurt was good. I got the vanilla frozen yogurt. Also, it's not super sweet if you're not much of a sweet tooth. You also have the option of putting caramel or chocolate sauce on top. I believe the chocolate sauce is Nutella but I'm not sure.

This is a good place to go by yourself and chill, go with family, friends, or even on a date!!"}
{"text":"Beavertails are always delicious but what kind of sweet fried dough doesn't taste good?! I ordered the killahoe sunrise and the boyfriend ordered the chocolate banana beavertail. We waited a few minutes for our order. 

With the killahoe sunrise, they give you small wedges of lemon to sprinkle on. It's basically the classic with lemon. Quite frankly, I would rather just order a classic beavertail to begin with. I had a bit of the boyfriend's chocolate banana beavertail. The chocolate spread added to the flavour. It was delicious. The boyfriend said he enjoyed it but would still rather order the killahoe sunrise next time. 

Overall, they were both okay. Like I said, what kind of sweet fried dough isn't going to taste good? I would give my visit 3.5 stars because it was alright and I would recommend. However, the service and quality of food did not exceed my expectations. 

(I wish yelp would allow you to give ratings by 0.5 star increments)"}
{"text":"Great location being right at the waterfront. Efficient and friendly staff; it's a good addition to the city's shore. How could you not love deep fried dough covered in sugar?"}
{"text":"Ok these beaver tail pastries are awesome. This is a must stop for a great view while you enjoy a delicious pastry. I had the skor bar cheese cake beaver tail with a coffee. Now take a coffee and walk on the dock for a cool breeze and pleasant view of the harbor."}
{"text":"Came by for a beavertail the other day and it made me smile reminding me of my childhood. 

Staff was super sweet and friendly. Beavertail was freshly made and had a lot of sugar. Pastry was perfectly fried and was crispy and fresh. 

At almost $6, it was definitely a premium to be paid for nostalgia! I guess at least we can have an Ottawa favorite in the middle of summer now too! 

...parking is rather squirrelly downtown...bring a wallet..."}
{"text":"Beaver Tails are absolutely amazing. They essentially resemble flattened funnel cakes with icing and honestly they are one of the best treats to have any time of the day. No, these aren't healthy at all, but it's nice to indulge on these while in Canada."}
{"text":"When in Toronto, MUST GET BEAVERTAILS! I got the oreo one with vanilla icing. So delicious and a great pastry! The pastry came out quick, maybe about 3 minutes after we ordered. I know they make it immediately from scratch right after I ordered so it's fresh as heck and warm. The oreo filling tasted so good when it's melted and the pastry had a taste of cinnamon toast crunch cereal (or maybe that's just my taste bud). Beavertails is a Canadian thing, but we need one in the bay area please. Service is quick and friendly."}
{"text":"I remember when Beavertails were almost exclusively in Ottawa and select events. I'm so glad Beavertails are now more easily accessible now throughout Ontario (maybe Canada?). In any case I got the classic Beavertail with butter and cinnamon. It was really fresh and crispy (deep fried right in front of me). Perfect for any season and time of day. The classic Beavertail is 390 calories (if I remember correctly), and I am surprised it is that low to be honest. 

They also have a nice selection of gelato, as well as soft serve ice cream and poutine. 
The raspberry gelato is perfectly tangy and sweet. 

The service was also friendly and fast! I will definitely return when I am in the area! Can't get enough Beavertails!"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service.   Staffs locked the door at 730pm.  Staffs were just inside and told my mother that they are closed already even if store hours states opens until 10pm. We were excited and droved from New Jersey."}
{"text":"Overpriced & disorganized.The best bevertails are in Ottawa while skating on the Rideau Canal.
A frozen yogurt cone was $3.29 each.What a joke! I ordered 2 for myself & my son.There was NO yogurt on it, just a smattering. In one lick, it was gone.I paid almost $7--for what?  Tourists are better off going to Tim Hortons on a hot summer day and having a delicious donut along with an iced capp supreme..It's cheaper & much more delicious where you can relax & be in an organized çomfy outlet, not like this tourist rip off. Over $ 6 for a pastry beavertail  is outrageous."}
{"text":"You used to have to travel to Ottawa or wait for the CNE to roll around before you could get your hands on a Beavertail. Thankfully these classic Canadian treats are now readily available in Toronto!

My favourite was always the maple flavour, but I gave the Skor Cheesecake flavour this time around and it was well worth it. Also tried the apple cinnamon - reminder me of an apple pie only with a better crust!

The location on the Queen's Quay means it gets pretty busy during the warmer months because of all the waterfront foot traffic. But when you're craving a Beavertail, nothing else will do and it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"Three stars for the great Lake view. But the food was too too sweet for me. But the plain beavertail is quite tasty, just the top up is sweet."}
{"text":"Love Beavertails! The staff are kind, and even though it's super busy, they get their stuff done on time. Personally love their chocolate hazelnut Beavertail, it's amazing! Their gelato also tastes good. A huge plus would be the location; the view of the harbour-front :)"}
{"text":"Loved the ambience of course with fun and frolic and the decorations. The staff is very courteous and cheerful. Tried the fried dough for the first time and fell in love instantly. We ordered the nutella hazelnut with chocolate. The calories are not that high and price is only 6.50$ which is decent enough. A very yummy sweet dish for which I am definitely going back."}
