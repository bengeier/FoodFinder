{"text":"I've tried over half the menu by now and everything has been delicious. The food takes longer to make than McDonald's, but it's well worth it. I usually go for one of the chicken \"Squarez\" but I like all of it."}
{"text":"Ordered here several times, good food and consistent quality. Tried their wraps and poutine - big portions for a good price. Very friendly service - the staff is super friendly and always smiling. Will be back, nice addition to our neighborhood."}
{"text":"This is not your regular fast food restaurant. Excellent wraps, made with very fresh ingredients from around the world. Friendly staff and good service. Definitely a hidden gem in the Church and Dundas area."}
{"text":"The burger wasn't the greatest, matter fact it wasn't good at all, just thrown around. I tossed it almost immediately when I got home. The staff  lacked professionalism and the place looked run down. Not worth the price and definitely not worth the time. Don't go!"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service! Customer service was dry as heck, no one said hello when we walked and dry stone looks on their faces as we placed our order. We are our from out of town so didn't think too much of it until a girl walked in in places her other after us and all of a sudden they customer service perked up for her. They also gave her 10% of due to it being her first time there.   Hold the hell up, where was all this happiness when we placed our order? Pure discrimination, which I called them out on but of course they denied it. BS!  After losing my our appetite, we asked them to just us our money back so we could take our business elsewhere. The \"manager\" said there was no return policy, once they make the food we have to take it. That's bad business buddy. So I kindly asked for a corporate number to make a complaint and now there is no number. He said I can just make the complaint with him.   We asked for one thing and that was to be treated fairly. This was our first time there and we request our 10% like the customer after us!!   All in all, the food was sh*ty!! :)"}
