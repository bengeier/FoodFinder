{"text":"My friend and I ordered a pizza with veggies (our own topings not the veggie pizza on the menu) and it was delicious. Crust was nice and crispy around the edges but not over cooked. Sauce, cheese and toping combinations were in perfect balance! We will be going back for at least the pizza!"}
{"text":"This place has an identity crisis. Now, as of 5/10, it is back to being called Boston's. 
The owners did not want to pay the franchise fee, but I guess they came to some agreement recently. So, the owner pays for all new signage, changes menu (not for the better), gets new uniforms, new cooking equipment, but never had his credit card system working the entire time the place changed names. I think the franchise won the battle on this skirmish. The owner probably has alot of egg on his face now. 
  Farewell fancy plates and parsley sprinkles. While you at it, get rid of the Thursday night trivia guy too. You really think people aren't checking answers on cell phones in 2013? The questions are often quite easy and the guy thinks he is some sort of comedian when he gets a microphone. (not a very good one either).

{"text":"If 1/2 stars were an option....
Ordered a burger and fries today for lunch off GrubHub. I'm pretty sure it was made-to-order, but then it sat around for an hour before being delivered. My burger was cold, bun was soggy, and extremely dry, my fries were cold, soggy, and chewy, and my soda was watered down because the ice had melted. The delivery driver was friendly enough, but definitely lazy and his appearance was unkempt. Needless to say, I'm so glad I had the opportunity to spend $18 on a sack of sh!t for lunch today. Thanks Boston's!"}
{"text":"they delivered a mac&cheese hot dog and a black bean burger to my home and it's wonderful. So fast and so tasty!"}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza from this place using grubHub - the pizza was HORRIBLE, expensive, took forever (longer than GH promised), and arrived COLD! Will NEVER order from this place again. The pizza was so disgusting that it seemed that they used velveta fake cheese on it, it was so bad that we had to trash it."}
