{"text":"Absolutely the best for a quick sandwich and a glass of wine! Friendly, clean, astute...with great food! Try the kettle chips, for sure!"}
{"text":"I have been to Jake's with family 4 or 5 times, and everyone has always enjoyed what we ordered.  

It's cozy with a smaller dining area, and if the TV is on, it can be a little loud.  

The food has been enjoyable!  Lots to choose from and something for everyone."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast on a Sunday Morning Everything was great. Had the pancakes, the standard breakfast with eggs a choice of meat, hash browns and toast. 

Best part was the Biscuits & Gravy. That will bring me back.

Only reason it's a 4 and not a 5. Staff seemed a bit on end. Not very personable, they weren't that busy that people were running around with their heads cut off, but seriously a little conversation goes a long way."}
{"text":"If your looking for a great perch dinner, look no further. Jakes has got you covered. I'm hooked on it to the point that I never try anything else. Service is always very good and the restaurant presents well. Very busy on the the weekends so get there early."}
{"text":"The veggie burger was meh. I used the top bun to soak up the grease from the fries which were soggy and limp. Will not be back."}
{"text":"I do not plan on returning.  Our server was great but the food wasn't anything to write home about.  It took forever to get our meals and when I could not stomach what I was served I heard the owner chiming in when the table next to us was making fun of me because it was their favorite dish.  He also did not offer me anything else or offer to remove it from the bill.  Although it was nice they offered us donuts when we had to wait for a table to be available, they were stale and I would rather have not been offered them at all.  Maybe dinner is better, but I was definitely not happy with breakfast."}
{"text":"Had dinner here last weekend.  Friday night fish dinner ( battered fish, cole slaw and fries for $9.95.)  So much food  on the plate, we couldn't ask for more - and it was \"all-you-can-eat.\"  Can't wait to go back and try something else on the menu.  I had wanted to go to this place for a long time and kept forgetting about it. They should increase their advertising.  It's fun finding a new spot you really like that isn't part of a chain. Great food, service, location and prices. Check for nightly specials."}
{"text":"Made the mistake of going on Friday for the perch. We remembered going a while ago and the perch was hanging out of the bun. Had some out of towners with us. Four of us ordered the perch sandwich. One had the walleye dinner. Wait was long, but the place was packed. Perch sandwiches came and the perch were lost in the big bun and underwhelming, at best. They gave us too many fries for any one person to eat, perhaps to make up for the paucity of perch on the sandwich. Walleye eater was pleased with the meal and raved about the grilled sweet potatoes. Won't go back very soon."}
{"text":"The girls and I had yet another great time at Jake's last night.  Place was extremely busy, but the servers always have things under control---it's obvious the owners only hire the \"best of the best.\" Our server, Tess, is always fantastic, and takes great care of us old ladies on half-priced wine bottle night!  And nice to see comfort food on the menu, like the stuffed cabbage---tastes like Grandma's.  We will give 5 stars when Jim picks up our tab!"}
{"text":"What can I say? When this place was Herb's on Lake, it was an Avon Lake institution.  I can't say so much for Jakes.  

The food is just ok.  I ordered salmon, which was fine, but it came with frozen veggies, which are not ok.  Even a hole-in-the wall, should have fresh veggies.  My relatives had sandwiches and french fries and the fries looked fresh at least.  

Service was fine -- it wasn't busy.  The bartender changed the channel so that I could watch the OSU game.  Outdoor seating is available during nice weather.  

Prices are average.  I think my salmon dinner was around $12.  Would I go back?  Yes, but I would not order anything with vegetables."}
{"text":"So I've always heard great things about Jakes. We went tonight and our meals were either hit or miss. My husband said his perch was incredible. My daughter had wings and they were average. My French dip was nothing special. My son had the chicken tenders and they were so burnt I was surprised they served them. When they brought out a replacement, they were just as burnt. When he didn't touch them you would think the waitress would take them off the bill. 
Our waitress was not great. Wrong dressing for wings, tomatoes on a salad when asked no tomato, and the chicken tender incident above. 
Wasn't too busy and service also kind of slow. I wasn't impressed."}
{"text":"We love Jakes! Casual atmosphere. Great for kids and family. Specials are always good - when Lake Erie perch is fresh, count on Jakes to have the best fish fry in town. Giant salads too!"}
{"text":"My husband and I finally stopped at Jakes for the first time to get brunch. Blown away. The eggs Benedict was amaaaaazing. The Baja -hollandaise like- sauce was the perfect finishing touch. Hash browns were awesome and I usually don't eat hash browns. The waitress was really really nice and the atmosphere was cozy and I loved all the windows! Obviously it would be amazing if they were on the lake but whatever I'm over it. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for dinner for our first time. It was small area but the was plenty of seating, being a Saturday night. The hostess said she doubted they would get busy at all. We were set in the  area that the servers went into the kitchen, so we had a lot of traffic near our table. I guess being an older house, every time someone would walk be fast our table would shake. The waitress was very pleasant and tentative to us. Everyone was very friendly. My husband ordered the red snapper, with rice and green beans, he said it was really good. The snapper was perfectly cooked. I had the house salad with salmon, and the mussels. My salad was good, the house dressing is really good especially when paired with the salmon that was cooked just right. I was disappointed in the mussels, some of them were tough and the white wine/olive oil sauce was not flavorful. Also it was suppose to come with a piece of bread according to the menu, which was not served at all. I may go back, but maybe for lunch instead of dinner."}
{"text":"This is a family friendly dive restaurant. The menu is standard american with salads, burgers and wraps. The food was decent with no complaints but our waitress on the other hand was where the experience went sour. Our waitress had zero personality and maybe spoke 5 words to us the whole time. She was very abrupt and when she did speak it was more of a \"what do you want\" instead of \"welcome, what can I get you\". The waitress that told us to have a good night when we left was the friendliest part of our experience."}
{"text":"The best part of this place was the company I came with. Otherwise, meh.

The location is great and the restaurant-in-an-old-house thing is super cute and I love it, but Jake's left a lot to be desired.

We asked nicely if we could sit outside, since the sun was beating down on the patio and the day was warming up. Everything was OK until our waitress greeted us. She was sassy and snippy. Like...hardcore sass. I asked if I could switch out the potatoes that were coming with my benedict and got a firm NO and glare. OK, not a big deal, I was just asking. The death stare was not necessary. When we had our food, she asked if we needed hot sauce and waters. She waited for one person to open their mouth and then ran away to get ONE water. When we asked for two more, she said \"I asked you if you wanted water and you didn't say anything.\" Uhhh...you didn't give us a chance before you stomped away! Pretty much all of our interactions with her were like that. Thumbs down.

The food was OK all around, except my poached eggs were definitely hard boiled. I ate them because I was starving and honestly a little scared of the whiplash I would get from our waitress. 

I was hoping that this could be an annual brunch spot when we run the Love-a-stray 5K every April, but I think we might end up somewhere else next year. It's not worth the abuse once a year."}
{"text":"As busy as this place was when we showed up, we waited less than 10 minutes for our table.  
We had a larger group but that didn't stop our server from promptly getting out drinks and orders to us.  
I don't have a single complaint about our food or service. Everything came as described and nothing was wrong with anyone's order at our table.
I can see us returning sometime to try other items.
TIP: the French fries are AWESOME and hand cut! You could easily eat 2-3 plates of them alone."}
{"text":"We had good service, and the patio was great for the kids. Fries and fried pickles were delish. My burger did not blow me away. Bun was dry. But the perch looked great, wings were crispy, and everything seemed fresh, so I can forgive the bun. Next time will stick to perch."}
{"text":"I had business is Avon lake and stopes here for lunch by myself.

The restaurant itself is very old and appears dirty. That being said, once I was seated it felt clean.

The restaurant looks like it's right on Lake Erie on a map but really it's on the other side of the street and you cans see the water at all which was disappointing.

I had the Lake Erie perch which is their specialty. It was wonderful! Not overly fried but crispy, and the bun was nice too. Their homemade tarter sauce and Cole slaw were so good, I could have had more! 

Next time I'm in Avon lake this is where I'll be going!"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Jake's! Solid local restaurant with a great kitchen and great staff! We love the perch dinners, French Dip sandwiches, fries, Chef salads and Hot Wing Sauce. The owner is one of the \"good guys\" and tries to make sure everyone has a great meal. (I've never had a bad meal here.)
I usually try one of the daily specials and daily soups and rarely get disappointed. The place is a nice old \"roadhouse\" and is a local favorite watering hole."}
{"text":"Have been here numerous times and always a good experience. Servers are friendly and the owner is always on hand. Food is always good with a great choice of beers and drinks. Wings are one of the best in the area. The days they have breakfast/brunch are a must to go in and try. Best restaurant in Avon Lake."}
{"text":"Cute restaurant, great food and service. The bar was really nice as well and it looked like they had cute events planned throughout the month as well. Happy we tried Jake's On The Lake!"}
{"text":"Older Crowd, reasonably priced, decent food"}
{"text":"Love coming here for a quick lunch on the weekends. Great location right by the lake. Place is smaller but gives off a good diner-like vibe. Food is really good and nothing fancy. Some of the best chili I have ever had. Their special and my recommendation is their Fish and Chips which you can also get as a sandwich. Fresh and always fantastic. They have cheap beer and good cocktail prices as well."}
{"text":"We love jakes for breakfast! They have the most AMAZING eggs Benedict, a must eat, I promise you won't be sorry! They always have interesting seasonal specials as well.

Jakes is great for dinner too if you are looking for bar food with a twist. They have a full bar and even some micro brews. The service is always quick without feeling rushed. They also have a nice fish fry Fridays during lent."}
{"text":"Eggs benedict, home fries, and mimosa made a great breakfast.  No view of the lake here but still a decent restaurant.  Worth checking out if you're in the area.
."}
{"text":"Great place. Relaxed atmosphere combined with good food made for an enjoyable lunch. Server did a great job, so attentive."}
{"text":"Ordered take out - service was poor and food was cold. I'm only 3 miles away. Very disappointing!"}
{"text":"Meh. It says it has a view. It doesn't. It's way across the street from the lake. Seems like a local hangout and not really meant for business travelers like me. I tried their special which was the pork steak with onions and dumplings and the pork came out rare which kinda grossed me out. Their clam chowder was good! Service was just ok. Not very attentive but not exactly neglectful either. I won't be going back. I was most definitely not wowed."}
{"text":"Local small get hearing place.  Friendly staff. Food on the bland side, had the chicken paprikash. Seems the clientele may be older so maybe hence the conservative spice factor.  Great area for potential."}
{"text":"Decided to stop in and try the Lake Erie perch sandwich with the family.  After waiting 15 mins for a waiter to stop by the hostess finally came around and got our drink order.  After another 15 mins the waiter stopped by to take our order with an attitude.  Food was delivered in a timely manner, but food quality was poor. The perch was over breaded and undercooked, nasty. Fries were cooked and looked good, but had no taste.  Wife ordered the hamburger and fries special, but could only eat a few bites.  Son ordered the Reuben sandwich and it was okay. Waiter never refilled our drinks and was absence forever to deliver the ticket for payment."}
{"text":"I  ate brunch here. I had a long black hair in my eggs....i was never offered a replacement ...no I'm sorry.the server never checked back. I paid my bill and left hungry. Horrible service !"}
{"text":"Classic American restaurant with bar food. My staff team comes here for lunch during our meetings. They offer some great standards (chicken caesar wrap, reubens, lake erie perch fry) and sometimes some Polish foods (chicken paprikash). I've had the pierogies (really good), spring salad with chicken (greens, candied pecans, raspberries, strawberries, apples), chicken caesar wrap and the Lake Erie Perch. All pretty decent. Definitely a go-to place for our team, nothing too out of the ordinary or spectacular.

Service is a little slow--we usually have about 6 or 7 people going though. Lots of tvs with sports channels.

Nice local establishment in the burbs!"}
{"text":"My favorite place for breakfast, lunch or dinner. Food never disappoints and neither does the service. Highly recommend! You'll be glad you stopped in!"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff. Walking distance from our house. Prices are a bit high for family dining, but the food is excellent and the menu is vast!"}
{"text":"I had dinner with a friend at Jake's on the Lake on Wednesday, Jan. 25, 2017, around 6:00pm.  The place was very crowded and several people were waiting for tables, though there was a table for two ready for us when we arrived.  I ordered soup and salad ($7.95), (creamy chicken and a nice side salad w/spinach, mixed greens, cucumbers, grape tomatoes and the option of red onion and croutons).  The salad was very fresh and ice cold, the soup was nice and hot and was better than I expected it would be.  Various crackers were served with the soup.  My friend ordered a rib eye steak dinner (17.95) which came with choice of potato and steamed green beans, red peppers, broccoli and mult-colored carrots.  He ordered the fresh, hand-cut fries, which I thought were excellent but he wasn't crazy about.  Service is very good.  The menu has lots of choices.  I will definitely go back to Jake's on the Lake.  I understand Tuesday is their \"burger night\" when burgers w/fries are $6.00."}
{"text":"Our favorite spot in Avon Lake by far. The meatloaf on special Tuesdays is exceptional. Always good beer options on tap- pumpkin ales in the fall, Christmas ales in winter. The buffalo chicken pasta as well as the fried brussel sprouts are to die for. Fast, friendly and inviting service. Owner is here and attentive. Five stars all the way."}
{"text":"Hit or miss, just like previous reviews.

First visit, ordered a salad for my entree.  My dining partner's side salad came chilled and crisp on a chilled plate.  My salad arrived warm and wilted.  The greens tasted kinda moldy like they came from the bottom of a salad bag.  My partner loved her entree; salmon.

Waitress was rude and never stopped by after someone else delivered the food.  Hardly saw her at all.  Very poor service.

Gave it another try.  This time ordered the perch, $14.95.  The fish tasted fresh and the coating was very light and tasty.  Well seasoned and not real bread-y like some places.  Coleslaw was exceptionally good.  House cut fries are pretty good, too.

The problem this time:  The plate had excess grease on it from the fish and fries.  The food was delivered barely luke warm.  Sad.

They miss on the simple things."}
{"text":"Went today and got the perch dinner with fries and onion rings.  Very disappointed as it was saturated in grease.  We went a few weeks prior and it was excellent. Not sure what the deal was .....too inconsistent!"}
{"text":"Really nice, quaint, atmosphere. Wings were good and saucy, and the Jake's Panini is a really good sandwich. The fresh cut fries are really good, and the coffee is really good. Will be back to try breakfast sometime soon. My server was incredibly friendly and always smiling.  Great place!"}
{"text":"Just went there yesterday for dinner with a friend. It was Burger night so I ordered a burger. It was average at best. Nothing special. The fries were pretty good though. The Miller Lite was weak. Maybe the lines need cleaned once in a while. The place ended up being pretty packed by 5:30 so if they get good business with the product they serve I guess that's good enough for them."}
{"text":"Best Lake Erie perch sandwich hands down! We take so many people here and always recommend the perch. Also like the very tasty buffalo chicken pasta, the 4 way chili pasta, their spinach salads with salmon are the bomb. 

Have Lauren make you a Moscow mule. Very yummy. Yes we go enough to know names now. 

Not a fancy kitchen but good meals that make you feel good."}
{"text":"You can (and usually should) judge a restaurant first by the exterior, then the interior, then the service, then the food, then the price, and finally take the global view and ask:  Would I send a friend here?

Exterior is just okay; it sits in a residential area on a state highway, NOT on the lake, although I bet if you could get up on the roof, you could see the whitecaps.  The patio in the back is even farther from the lake, but at least they do have outdoor seating.  

Interior is cozy, bordering on cramped.  Bar is teeny-tiny but comfortable.  We were in for that last-chance-at-breakfast-first-crack-at-lunch experience.  Jake's opened last year, but it already has a comfortable \"lived-in\" vibe, which is nice.

The service is erratic.  Plates left on the table for the entire meal.  Forgotten items.  They do that \"pile the napkins, pile the silver\" service trick, which is okay for a diner, but I think Jake's is trying for something a bit more up-scale than that.

The food?  Okay, this isn't good.  It isn't bad, though, either.  It's just passable.  As my partner said, There's really nothing wrong with this food, but it isn't anything special.  She had a Cajun burger and asked if it were spicy, hoping that it WOULD be; it was bland.  My perch sandwich?  Same deal.  Not much flavor.  French toast?  They could use some interesting bread with texture and flavor, which is the foundation of any good Froggy toast, in my opinion.  Again, nothing was really wrong with the food, I guess they have their market pegged as \"safe and sane\" eaters.  While the crowd was skewed just below middle-aged, most of the grub tasted like retirement home fare.

Price was about what I expected, middle-range for a sit-down brunch, but with the quality of experience noted above, about twenty percent off, in THEIR favor.

I can't recommend Jake's.  I'll try again next fall, or next year, but it won't be high on my to-do list."}
{"text":"We recently moved back to the area and have been looking for some good local joints for us to become regulars. I can say, without a doubt, that we've found our place at Jake's. We've only been there on two occasions, but we will be going back many more times. Let me describe both that were wonderful.

Visit One: Brunch after church. I had the Corned Beef Hash, which is made there. It was delicious, and I enjoyed every bite. The amazing part, however, was that my wife actually loved the sausage gravy. She's quite a gravy snob, and this was literally the first place I've been to with her where she actually approved of the sausage gravy that was not the place she grew up going to. This alone is proof this place is awesome.

Visit Two: Lent Fish Friday. My wife had the perch. Loved it. I had the Walleye Milanese. Holy cow, I will dream about that fish! Highly recommended. 

Overall we love this place. You may, too. If you're on the fence, give it a try; maybe you'll be lucky and love it like we do."}
{"text":"About as 'meh' as you can get. Completely forgettable food that seems like Sysco even if it isn't. Nothing really to recommend this place, although it isn't bad. Just disappointingly average, which is a real shame since there just aren't many good places in the vicinity. Service was OK -- not friendly, not rude, but not very interested in making things very good.

And it should be named Jake's on Lake, as it is on Lake Road but definitely not on THE lake."}
{"text":"This place is great!!! When we moved to Avon Lake we drove by this place and had to try it out.

They have daily specials and killer martini's. Perch dinner is great, my husband loves the burgers.

The atmosphere is fun. Try this place out it is truly an Avon Lake gem."}
{"text":"Nice neighbor bar and grill. Good burgers and specials. I had the seafood pasta (very tasty). Drink specials.  Great location. 

Can't go wrong with this place for casual dining."}
{"text":"We discovered Jake's while driving home from eastern Ohio along the Coastal route...and being hungry because it was well past lunch time.
Jake's looked like a good place to have lunch, and it didn't disappoint! 
I saw fried pickles on the app menu and immediately decided  Jake's could be my kind of place!
I had the Lake Erie perch sandwich-the fish tasted fresh, the fries were rough-cut skin-on, and it came with a good-sized bowl of cole slaw. My dining companion said his hamburger was tasty and cooked the way he ordered it (a big thing with him as he tends to like his burgers medium, or maybe on the medium rare side).
The place has only been open about a year and a half, but it seems to have established itself as a real \"local joint\". The servers seemed to know a lot of the customers, and a lot of the customers seemed to know each other (sounded like a lot lived in the neighborhood).
Service was very friendly, and we immediately felt at home ourselves.

A fellow came in toward the end of our meal who we thought might be the owner. He was joking with some of the customers about having just come in from fishing for perch on Lake Erie, and when a customer asked if he caught the fish we were all eating...he said, \"yup, we do it all here...catch 'em, cook 'em\".

Our only regrets? We were on the road and had a ways to go home, so we didn't have a beer. And we were so stuffed from lunch that we couldn't order dessert (cheesecake seemed to be a specialty here, and the Key Lime Cheesecake nearly made me crack!)."}
{"text":"Best Fish Fry I've had in the area! Great, friendly service. The owner Jim is there helping out and packaging up food. 

Cons: 
Diet Pepsi: flat

Chicken wings: dry, chewy and need more sauce (and it was wing night). The menu should say if they have a dry rub on them. They seem to be dry rubbed and then sauced. This makes for an odd flavor. Typically it's one or the other sauce or rub. 

Pretzel Crusted Chicken: nothing to write home about. Dijon sauce is thick and gross. Chicken is again, chewy. 
Red skin potatoes: still completely hard and raw. 

Pros: 
Onion rings: delicious! And the homemade ranch they come with is also something special! 

Fried Perch: crispy, flavorful and amazing!
Coleslaw: excellent! 
Fries: cold, but potentially would have been good."}
{"text":"Sometimes you wish Yelp had half-stars because I would give Jake's a 3.5. First, I think this is more of a neighborhood place than a destination place. So you east-siders looking for some west-side lakeside ambiance, not here. As one reviewer noted, it isn't on the lake side of Lake Road and the only Lake Erie views you'll get is driving there and wondering where the owners of those big houses got their money. I actually frequent this place regularly and get their wings appetizer with a side salad-both very good. Wings are piping hot and you can actually taste chicken. Don't laugh-some wings it's hard. The Prime Rib special used to be a real bargain but the last one I got was a little disappointing - not awful, but it didn't live up to previous visits. Also enjoy the Friday fish fry-all you can eat but unless you're binging due to a recent break-up or or in training to be a lardo, one portion is way enough. Oh, and lots of large flat screen TV's tuned to the latest sports. I like the place."}
{"text":"Always love the perch!  My husband LOVED the calamari.  Peiroges were excellent.  

Not a huge fan of the chips.

Waitress was nice.  

This is our second time and we will continue to return"}
{"text":"Was in the area for work and wanted to cruise along the lake and stopped into Jakes.
Glad I did. I didn't even try to look past their \"House Specialty\" Lake Erie Perch sandwich. It was probably the best I've had. Absolutely amazing with the slaw and tartar sauce. Will for sure be back to try again!"}
{"text":"I went with my wife for breakfast for the first time. It was just okay. Reminded me of an old person restaurant. The food was just average. There are better places for breakfast so I don't plan to likely come back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Jake's On The Lake was a big mistake!  I ordered the nachos and was served a plate of canned refried beans with cold, hard cheese and covered with canned sliced olives and fresh diced tomatoes that seemed to be there so you wouldn't notice the poor quality of the dish.  The ribs were an even bigger disaster to attempt to eat.  Ribs served cold with the side of cold, undercooked \"fresh cut fries\".  The only thing warm on the plate was the overflowing bowl of soggy cole slaw in which there was so much dressing it had overflowed and formed puddles in the areas the fries didn't soak up. 

The service, well... It was worse then the food.  Our waitress was serving other tables as well as ours.  A new couple sat down at the table next to ours and asked about specials.  She proceded to lie to them and say she had just started her shift and didn't know them yet (we had been there at lease 30 minutes and she was working when we got there).  Every few minutes all staff seemed to disappear for a few minutes and could not be found."}
{"text":"I've been here several times but just realized that I haven't yet reviewed this place this weekend. The food is great, but the staff here makes the experience even better. They are all so friendly and personable. The crowd at this place is mostly older, but what else would you expect? Your in Avon Lake after all."}
{"text":"The burgers are excellent and cooked to order - there are plenty of options for toppings too. I wasn't a big fan of the fries, but the kettle chips are very good. It wasn't too loud even though there were a couple large parties there at the same time we were.  A great place to grab a burger - we will be back."}
{"text":"Food was decent- only waited a half an hour for a table but wouldn't wait that long again IF I came back. Finally got the check after 35mins and asking the waitress 3 times. Service was average at best- not rude, but not very attentive.. just there to make their pay and go home."}
{"text":"Well, I thought I would try Jakes again. I enjoy sitting outside on their patio. I was very disappointed last year with their breakfast and with the server, who I noticed was there tonight. Still same stone face and still no smile. Anyway, Jakes usually always has a great perch dinner. Not so tonight. The perch was way overdone and tough and the fries were lukewarm. They do have outstanding coleslaw. I did tell the waitress, who, by the way, was pregnant and a very good server, that I wasn't happy with the meal. Very nice young girl, who right away got me some more fish. It was better, but not by much.No new fries though. In my opinion, Jakes has really went downhill. I love the location but am so disappointed in their food.  When we were walking to our car we saw a young kid come out from the kitchen, sit down and light up his cigarette. He was smoking near the patio, which was almost full. I'm glad we were done when he was on break because I certainly would not want to smell cigarette smoke while I was eating. I'm not sure if he was a cook or what he did there, other than work in the kitchen. Maybe they should spend more money and hire a decent chef and/or cook. He should not be smoking so near the patio. Come on Jakes get with it. I'm not looking forward to coming back anytime soon!"}
{"text":"It's not on the lake, #1.  The place is cute. It's an old house. The menu is generic as are the daily specials.  The \"bar\" area is done by 9:30pm on weeknights and is closed up by 10pm on weekends. Blue hair crowd."}
{"text":"So thankful we found this tiny gem!! Nestled on Lake road in Avon Lake with a beautiful view of the gorgeous homes and lake sits this awesome spot! It was the first perfect day of Spring and were able to sit on the patio which made it all better, but inside is super cute. Has a very island feel to it. It was small inside, but had a large impact on us. Our bartender was fabulous, super nice and gave us some insight to the restaurant history and the menu favorites. One being the perch, which we had to try, then secondly pierogis because well, I have to get pierogis whenever I go. The fish sandwich was without a doubt the best fish sandwich we had ever had. It pretty much melted in my mouth. My boyfriend and I split one and it was the perfect amount for each of us. It came with homemade fries and coleslaw, both were delicious. We also shared the pierogis which were good as well!! Great draft selection for such a small place, even had a beer we had never tried and loved it. Needless to say, we will be returning throughout the Summer because there is more that I want to try, breakfast is up next for us!!! Check this place out right away!!!"}
{"text":"The only bad thing about Jakes is that it's in Ohio and I'm in Maryland. I was visiting family when I ran across this gem of a place. Years ago it was Herbs Tavern on the lake, glad Jake has it now as it's absolutely delicious! 

I had the Chicken Paprikash..really, really GOOD! I started with a garden salad, completely fresh with crisp lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, onions, shredded cheese and croutons. Loved the Thousand Island dressing. Definitely not using bagged salad here, I was in salad heaven! My 3 and half yr old daughter had the grilled cheese and fresh cut fries.. Holy smokes, I could hardly keep my hands off her plate. She ate about half, which is saying something because usually it will only be a few bites. My boyfriend had a sausage and peppers sandwich... devoured it along with the awesome fries. The best part was the chocolate cake, my mouth is watering just thinking about it. I can't remember the exact name, it had a chocolate ganache in between layers of chocolate cake. It literally was the best cake I have ever tasted. 

I CANT WAIT TO COME BACK IN THE FALL!!!"}
{"text":"Jakes is nice quint little restaurant near but not on the lake. The nice house setting is unique and different from your average restaurant/bar. Try to get there early during the dinner rush because it is a bit small inside. Lake Erie perch is probably the best dish there. Lots of genuine Cleveland  dishes like porgies here. They often have special including the buffalo chicken pasta which wasn't really impressive. It was pretty much noodles in spicy buffalo sauce and that's it. The garlic beard it came with however was to die for. Good selection of beer and beverages at a decent price"}
{"text":"Great find for home cooking! We started with Fried Pickles, then the specials of Stuffed Cabbage & homemade mashed potatoes, and Stuffed Cabbage Soup with Grilled Ham & Cheese sandwich. So awesome!"}
{"text":"Great Food and good drinks.  When it was under Herb's management I quit going when I reconized much of the food was frozen GPS food.  Jake's is much better and drinks aren't watered down.  I admit that sometimes the service is a little slow, but not that bad.  Also the tables are very close together in the lower section...but they have to work with what they have.  I love going there and hope they have a long and profitable time in that location."}
{"text":"This is a busy place no matter the time of day. Food is really good for the price. Lake Erie perch is my favorite and some of the best Ive had in northeast Ohio. Fries are homemade.

Although it seems to always be busy, staff are efficient and very friendly. A great neighborhood place."}
{"text":"A nice mom and pop restaurant. Quick to be seated at least for us, a party of 3. We have eaten here at least a dozen times and can't really complain with the prices of food and the convenience of the restaurant."}
