{"text":"Magura's pizza is so flippin delicious! Oh em gee! I live in mountains edge and have driven here just to pick up a pizza from here. It is that good! I came across after some coworkers ordered in for us at Nevada Pure and we love the pizza, wings and fries. The ranch is the business too! They are so kind and helpful as well. Love this place."}
{"text":"One of the best hidden gems and my go-to ever since I moved to Vegas. I use to work at a wing shop so my standards are high and this place has the best wings I could find, Me and my roomate are obsessed with their garlic parm! Every other menu item has never been a disappointment either, these guys do not skip on quality. I get delivery or carry out and has never had an order wrong or missing something, which happens a lot with other places. Everyone is always welcoming and friendly and that kind of attention to detail is why I'm addicted. My only complaint is that they aren't open 24hrs but that's probably best otherwise I'd never eat anything else."}
{"text":"This review is based my latest experience. I have always ordered from Magura, mostly satisfied with my orders. I ordered Hawaiian pizza with bell peppers and fingers. Now Magura is a little over 5 minutes away.  I used the Eat24 app to place order at 1624 and was supposed to arrive at 1708. The food arrived 15 minutes later.  So it took 10 minutes to cook the food. Doesn't pizza take longer to cook? The bell peppers were missing from the pizza. It must  have been pre-made. The fingers were greasy and tasted weird. I should have taken a picture. The fries were good. Had to throw the fingers out. Won't be ordering from there for a while."}
{"text":"First time ordering from here. So happy we tried Magura! It hit the spot. Will order again. Thank you :)"}
{"text":"I was looking for a new pizza place and found this place on Yelp.  It's a small quiet joint and the guy behind the counter was polite and nice .  The pics on Yelp made me think it was going to be not so good pizza. I ordered a Hawaiian i must say the pizza is really good. The pics don't do the pizza justice. I'll definitely go back. Thumbs up"}
{"text":"Calzone was good, but I'm super unsatisfied borderline grossed out.. I asked for paper plates and forks and knives for 2.. Got one fork and some napkins.  The fork was dirty.. Like are you serious? Never ordering here again... Someone had obviously used this fork... And it's like plastic, so u could have thrown it away and given us a fresh one.  Chocolate cake was frozen stiff with ice on the outside... Awesome... I literally ate 4 bites and got depressed about my meal.."}
{"text":"What a welcomed business in our area ! Nice to have a family owned pizza shop in the area. The pizza has been consistently tasty and we have ordered pizza many times already and will continue to do so . Our normal order is always the large pepperoni with meatballs always good and the crust is always cooked well too ..... give them a try."}
{"text":"Ordered a pick up special, great pizza was  cooked just right, good customer service, I'll definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Best sandwiches, wings, and pizza that I've had in Las Vegas. Try the chicken parm! It's like being in NY! Fast delivery and the drivers are always really nice."}
{"text":"Best food I've had since I've moved here almost a year ago everything was delicious and the delivery was fast and will continue to order from here and everyone was very nice and friendly"}
{"text":"Have ordered from here quite often. Magura pizza is our favorite as well as the tuna melt. My kids always ask for the melts!  Also really love the fried mushrooms and zucchini. If not sure, suggest getting the appetizers with all the items to try out.  Highly recommend you giving this place a try."}
{"text":"Ordered simple pizza and wings with fries. Food was pretty good but they did not bring complete order. When I called and explained the situation the employee couldn't comprehend what happened, after several more attempts to explain she finally caught on, but wouldn't send out the food I paid for. Be careful, you may get ripped off especially if you order from Yelp as prices are different/cheaper than their menu and food combinations differ also. Won't buy from again. To be fair their delivery driver was fast and friendly.  UPDATE....After posting the above review, Hannah, from the restaurant, called and offered to send out the correct order without charge. I modified the rating from 2 to 3 stars, but not anymore because they still wouldn't take responsibility for the error. They blame the website for posting the wrong prices, but if they see an order come in from that website why not make a little effort and call the customer to notify him/her of the difference(s)....laziness or greed?  The only reason I've gone in-depth with this review is because I am absolutely fed up with getting ripped off so frequently by businesses, even if it's only for a few bucks."}
{"text":"I ordered online for a delivery order, I'm very disappointed actually. It took over half an hour just for the food to cook. I called the business to check on my order and as soon as I called he told me the delivery guy had just left. I waited 40-45 minutes for a takeout order!!! How freaking ridiculous. And the food wasn't very good either. I got the broccoli cheddar soup, it has absolutely no taste at all. I also ordered chicken wings, medium spice. I was very excited to eat these until I opened the box. There was literally no sauce on it. I also wanted blue cheese but they gave me ranch instead. The fries were soggy and cold, too. Definitely will be my first and last time eating this place."}
{"text":"I read something about this being one of the best pizza places in the U.S., representing the state of Nevada. That was surprising! I passed by it a couple of times in a shady shopping area and decided to try it out in my own. The pizza was good, but I wouldn't go as far as saying it's the best in Nevada. The people there are pretty nice. I went back a second time and it was just OK. The bottom was soggy, and I don't like that in a pizza!"}
{"text":"Wings in medium sauce are EASILY my favorite. Haven't had a bad thing from this place. They're quick. Pizza's are pretty good, even their salads are good. Give em a shot!"}
{"text":"I really like this place and have ordered from them about a dozen times or so.   For me, I order the thin crust pizza with just cheese or maybe one topping, cheese burgers, and the Romain salads seems to be made fresh, not premade.  It keeps me coming back.  Wish I would have come here years ago...  The Thai place next door is pretty good too."}
{"text":"Have ordered here multiple times pickup & delivery, all the boys are very nice. Their ranch is awesome & Philly cheese steaks are crazy yummy. Their fries are nice thick steak fries, love this place. Nice little hidden gem."}
{"text":"It has all the favorites and none of it is disappointing. My family will get the Hawaiian, pepperoni, and Margarita pizza along with trying most of the apps and chicken wings too. Everyone is always happy. I find the margarita is a little too cheesy for my preference. And all this food is of course greasy, but not as bad is other places. We do delivery and food is always warm / hot.  Price is is on point for the products."}
{"text":"This is 1 of my favorite to go spots for when I am in town in Vegas. They are a great value and their delivery guys are always fast. Their pizzas are also fantastic and you should definitely give 1 of their cheeseburgers a try. Magura gets an easy 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Order a pizza for the office today.  It was awesome!  Lady who took the order was very pleasant on the phone and the delivery guy was super nice.  We will definitely be ordering from them again!  Thank you Magura's :)"}
{"text":"This place is great, all the way this place had me awed.  it is a genuinely huge setting with a bar, high top tables and good eating. We were sat down quickly and our server was personable to help us explore the brews and helped with menus. I've had the pizza once before yet since it was all but forgotten to me. We picked a huge white style pizza, olive oil and mozzarella with garlic, with pepperoni . Wow it was totally awesome. Most likely the best pizza I've ever had. So yeah, really good Pizza"}
{"text":"They are so good and reasonably priced! We wanted Pizza, sides and dessert! All of it was better than we hoed for and I can't wait to go again!!!"}
{"text":"Good and yummy but felt like it was missing something. Had a small margarita pizza + meat pizza and cheesy garlic bread. Loved the inside, small dining area with open/viewable kitchen so you know there's nothing sketchy going on with your food."}
{"text":"I was in this strip mall, saw pizza, and decided to give it a try. I had a pepperoni pizza. It was a very good pizza that I have had in a while. The cheese was soft and moist, not dry or rubbery. Crust was the star, it had just the right amount of chew without being dry or tough."}
{"text":"With a vague name like Magura, it's hard to tell what cuisine is offered. Reviews emphasize the pizza but they have one of those menus with a little bit of everything from burgers to salads to wings and sandwiches, and even pastas.  Ordered takeout a couple times: first order of a salad and grilled cheese was dismal, with large, rough-cut veggies in the salad and unmelted cheese on the sandwich. But there was tons of chicken on the salad and their prices are reasonable.  Returned for the pizza, specifying half Spinach and Feta and half Philly Steak. Happily, they were able to accommodate this though they later told me they typically don't do half styles. The pie was loaded up with toppings and both sides were tasty enough to make it difficult to pick a favorite. However, the crust was somewhat soggy in the middle, which I didn't care for.  Staff have been friendly and the location is clean. I'll likely be ordering again (specifically the eggplant parm sandwich!) because they're quick, cheap, and convenient.  PRO TIP: Discounted lunch specials 11AM-3PM, 14\" pickup special for $7."}
{"text":"Amazing food and very nice staff! This is my 4th time here and I love the food. Their pizzas aro very yummy!! I ordered 14\" thin crust pizza and it was delicious; they always put just enough toppings and not too much sauce. Their pasta is amazing as well; last time I ordered Egplant Parmesan and was very tasty! I will definitely recommend the place."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Italian restaurant. I love the food and the owner is nice. It's always quiet so its a nice place to have lunch and possible get some work done."}
{"text":"Night before thanksgiving and the family was feeling particularly hungry. We decided to opt for something new and picked Magura as something quick and convenient only to be quickly disappointed. After looking at their entire menu, I placed an order and sat back to patiently wait. About 20 minutes later I get a call from an 800 number with a lady full of attitude complaining that I didn't answer her first call, (it ran twice and hung up before I could answer) only to say they didn't deliver as far as our location. Disappointed I hung up and checked their yelp page/directions to realize I lived only 2.7 miles away. Why offer delivery if you don't even go 3 miles for your customers. After that and a rude phone call don't think I'll be trying my luck at Magura any time soon."}
{"text":"Amazing place. Great food and such a kind staff. We order and pick up at least once a week and we definitely have our favorite things to order: Wings & fries, pizza, and salads.  But honestly last night we had the Bolognese ziti and it was awesome."}
{"text":"We love the marguerita pizza from Maggura's. It is particularly tasty!! Of course everything we've tried has been exceptionally delicious!! We order from here once a week, at least!!"}
{"text":"A friend stopped at Magura last weekend and brought two pizzas over to our swim party and they were great.  Last night we decided to try their cheesesteak special - two sandwiches and an appetizer sampler delivered.  The staff was very nice on the phone and when they delivered.  The food was hot when it arrived.  The app sampler was great and it had my favorite kind of onion rings - battered.  The steaks were good - nice amount of meat and cheese.  I look forward to ordering from them again."}
{"text":"I am so glad one of my co-workers discovered this place! We have ordered a couple of times and have not been disappointed. The first time we ordered, only one of us got pizza. She raved about how good it was (and she is from Chicago). They did forget the fries on one of the orders but quickly sent out another batch to us. The second time we ordered, three of us got pizza and we all agree that is awesome. Lots of topping, even on a one topping order. Light on the sauce, nice thin and crispy crust. Only downside was one of the pizza had a wrong topping than what was ordered. it was still very tasty but that along with forgetting the fries the first time is why this was only a 4 star rating. Good prices, quick delivery.  We will be ordering from here again"}
{"text":"Old-school family owned and operated. Thus they care about their product, and it shows you can taste it. I just wish they would stop calling me sir when I make my phone orders."}
{"text":"We wanted pizza and decided to try something different - Magura was close enough for delivery, so we gave it a try.   I ordered a Quattro fromaggio pizza, a meaty pizza, and an order of mushrooms.   Delivery was quick, much faster than expected. The driver arrived within 30 minutes. He wasn't super friendly, but he did have to wait out in the heat for a minute because I didn't hear him knock.   The two pizzas were tasty. The crust was thin and crisp. A number of reviews complained that it was soggy, but we didn't have that problem. They brushed some garlicky oil on the edges and gave it a nice salty tang. I loved the white pizza. No complaints.   The mushrooms were ok. I felt like it was a really small portion for the cost and they weren't special in any way.   I'll probably order pizza from them again, but no apps."}
{"text":"ordered delivery from them a couple times and it's safe to say this is my favorite pizza spot! delivery is quick and food is always delicious."}
{"text":"Best Pizza I've had in a long time. They also serve pasta, and other Italian cuisine. Open late and offers lots of specials. Centrally located in Vegas not far from the strip."}
{"text":"We were craving good homemade pizza and found this place on google maps.. very very good pizza and chicken fingers! Also was very decent priced. We will definitely order here again."}
{"text":"A friend of mine that lives in the area recommended Magura as a decent pizza spot. We were having a few friends over so we ordered delivery. We got the #8 special - 18\" pizza with 20 wings and a 2 liter soda. We got pepperoni and mushroom and decided to get plain wings with sauces on the side. We also added a 14\" four cheese pizza. Delivery took about 40 min. Our friends seemed more impressed by the pizza than I was. It was pretty standard to me. Above average greasiness, floppy slices. Loads of toppings though. Probably shouldn't have gone with plain wings. They were super crispy but seemed like a lot of skin, not much meat. They did give us 3 sauces each of ranch, bbq and hot which was generous. The favorite for me was the four cheese. The ricotta was really thick. Unfortunately the crust was just mediocre. Very floury and there were big pockets of air. I'd say for the price, this wasn't worth it. If it was a little cheaper I would probably eat this more regularly but I'll keep looking for a neighborhood pizza spot."}
{"text":"Pizza is always great!! Tried the subs and they are delicious as well.  We just moved to vegas an so far best pizza"}
{"text":"This is my go to pizza place for delivery. The pizza is really good and decently priced. Delivery is always quick and hot. This pizza is made in an oven and so much better than the vaporized stuff from Dominoes or Pizza hut!"}
{"text":"Our 4th order:  Fries were soggy Nd cold, wings tasted old & had no flavor, onion rings were also soft Nd warm. Philly was short on the meat and cheese was burnt. Just was all rushed and not fresh. I placed order at 9:15. Over all . Not a good order.   Good food. I have tried a few things. The country burger, was pretty good. The onion rings here are delicious but somewhat pricey to me. Philly was good. The chicken tenders are good size. Wings are good size and cooked well. Pizza was ok. The salad had plenty toppings and the garlic bread and garlic bread with cheese is good. Delivery was pretty fast!"}
{"text":"Great pizza and the other food is good as well. the delivery guy pisses of one of the resesidence down the street by driving a little too fast but thats ok..that guy is a jerk"}
{"text":"I think I've ordered from this place enough to throw in a review.  I don't eat cheese, but my family says the pizza is good.  I go for the shrimp basket and fries which is perfectly solid for the most part.  Take your business here."}
{"text":"Pizza is to die for! Amazing sandwiches! And I am simply in love with their panini. Food on budget and it's so delicious!"}
{"text":"One of the best pizzas I've had in a long time. And the onion rings were awesome. I ordered it delivery so I wasn't sure how fresh or hot it was but everything was great. I will definitely try other items on their menu."}
{"text":"Not the best pizza in town as they advertise. Tasted more like school lunch pizza to the hubby and me. The chicken tasted like it had freezer burn. Won't be back"}
{"text":"I have ordered from here three separate times at work for a lunch delivery and I have yet to be dissapointed!!  I was almost about to give up and having decent food during my work day!  I have yet to order pizza from them but it looks delicious! They are reasonably priced and the sandwiches I have ordered are always delicious!  Fries are great and their ranch is super yummy!  This place has all the makings of a great new lunch spot favorite!"}
{"text":"I keep coming back for the wings.not many flavors to choose from just buffalo and bbq  but they're good. not sure but i think there's two people who make the pizzas, one uses like cheddar on their pizza and its biscuit like not my fave. and one makes it juuuuuust right 100% mozzarella, good crust tasty pepperoni. overall i like this place"}
{"text":"They place advertisements on our front door, 2-3 times a month, googled and found they were minutes from home, figured we'd give them a shot, worst decision yet. Crust was raw, very little sauce, that tasted like tomato paste out of the can, heavy handed on the olives, but skimped on the pepperoni and mushrooms. I doubt we will ever return to give them another try. First impressions mean a lot, especially when it comes to food. Reminds us of another failed pizza location on Pecos/Flamingo."}
{"text":"Pizza is something that is very subjective.  Some people like it one way, some like it another.  What is great crust/cheese/toppings to one is not another's favorites.  That being said, I think I've found my new go to pizza joint.  There was an Eat24 coupon last week for $7 off so I said, heck yeah, let's give this place a go!  The delivery was fast, the pizza was delicious, and it was even great cold the next day!  The sauce was spiced right, toppings were fresh, and I had a great experience, I will definitely be back and would definitely recommend it.    As I mentioned above, each person looks for something different with their pizza; as for me, this place is finally the place I will reorder from because their crust has been my favorite in this city, and it has been the best tasting cold pizza I've had in this city."}
{"text":"My gf wanted to go to this place after having a few drinks. But I guess she mistakenly said this was the place. Best damn mistake she's made in a long Time! We both really do love this place. The calzone is our favorite. We love the sauce. Honestly best pizza I've had in as long as I can remember. This place beats Pizza Hut, dominos, and papa johns hands down. The staff is fairly friendly. The first time we came they didn't rub me the right way to be honest. But I'm sure the poor guys were tired. But the pizza was so good that we have come back a few times and hope to come many more times."}
{"text":"This place has great pizza and they are family owned and super nice !! I will keep going there for sure"}
{"text":"Best pizza in vegas. Reasonable prices, helpful staff. They delivered to me even though I was outside of their delivery area. Love them."}
{"text":"Made an order for some food on EAT24 before the restuarant closed. The resturant then reached out 30 minutes later after they accepted my order and informed me the restaurant closed early. Good job Magura"}
{"text":"I just ordered from here today. Initially, I was upset because online they have a different menu than what their updated menu is. However, upon returning to the website I noticed that if you click on the first icon for prices it will give you the old menu but if you scroll further down (almost to the bottom) it gives you the updated menu. This is something management, or the website moderator should look into since it's along the lines of a bait and switch.  I was going to leave only 3 stars for my review (this was before eating their food) solely based on 1 star for delivery, 1 star for the food and 1/2 star for ease of ordering, so technically 2.5/5 stars. Once we got the food, though, we were pleasantly surprised. We ordered the couple special, which on the old menu was suppose to have a 10\" pizza, chicken with fries, and 2 sodas; the updated menu is a 14\" pizza with salad and 2 sodas. The difference in price between the old menu and the new menu is only a few dollars but you are also given a little less; example- we weren't given soda. No big deal on the soda since we cracked open a couple beers, anyways. Also, since we thought we weren't going to be given french fries along with the chicken we were going to upgrade our chicken order from 4 to 8, this made the price jump nearly $10 & we decided against it. It's a good thing we didn't upgrade the order since the chicken came with fries. Now, food:  The pizza was the second best pizza I have had in my entire life. My husband took one bite and moaned, it was so good.  The chicken was BBQ chicken and was smothered in sauce. Flavorful sauce nonetheless, but way too much. They were also wide pieces of tender, which was also a pleasant surprise considering we thought they'd be no bigger than typical tenders.  The French fries were thick cut fries, fried to perection. My favorite kind of fries, to be honest. Our added beer made the food even more enoyable.  So, my rating is 4/5 stars: 1 for delivery, 2 for food,  .5 for ease of ordering and .5 for customer service.  The reason I am not giving 5 stars is because they wouldn't honor the price that was displayed on their online menu that they claim to be the old menu. It isn't that big of a deal, but honestly if you have it posted you really should honor it. I also recommend since it was called the couples selection #1 that they still keep this option and rename it couples selection #2 with a small upcharge to offset the cost of the chicken and fries.  Overall, I am happy with the food and fast delivery.  Will I order again? Yes. This is now my #1 place in Vegas for pizza, and I will recommend others to order from here...after first sending them the link to the correct menu. ;)"}
{"text":"The worst pizza ever... barely any sauce.. no flavor  at all... bland sausage.. bland cheese... just the worst.. I honestly don't know how they are in business... waisted 20$.. even the homeless won't touch this."}
