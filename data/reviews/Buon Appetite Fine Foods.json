{"text":"Too bad I can't give them no stars... these people need some lessons in Customer Service.  Come here once in a while to treat my kids... never again!  No wonder this place isn't busy.  Its funny because a parent from my kids school was asking me if I knew a place where they made cakes and goodies... this place never even crossed my mind.  I would never refer anyone to this place, desserts aren't even that fresh."}
{"text":"small mom and pop shop with an impressive cheese selection and lots of great imported italian treats. the owner was really nice and gave some great cooking tips. i will definitely be coming back again soon."}
{"text":"Hidden in a sketchy looking strip mall, next to a sushi restaurant that's also pretty fabulous, is this small mom-and-pop Italian grocery store that sells fresh cheese, bread, deli meats & Italian desserts, in addition to a small selection of imported goods. The previous review says the desserts aren't fresh, I would disagree. I've never had anything but great cannolis, cookies and pannetone from this place. The guy at the counter is always ready with recommendations for anything you might ask. The only complaint I have is the narrow-ness of the store. There is barely room for two people to stand back to back without getting in each other's way. That being said, there really isn't room to expand anyway..."}
