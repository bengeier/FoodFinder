{"text":"Le Phaal a l'agneau/buf est excellent et le plus épicé que j'ai mangé à Montréal.  Beaucoup plus épicé que le vindaloo - avis aux amants d'émotions fortes :)"}
{"text":"Food was not well spiced and the lamb khorma was sweet (sugar added). Service subpar."}
{"text":"About 45 minute wait for the food, which was cold when it arrived. The waiter wasn't very polite or helpful. The food was just ok; the butter chicken was too sweet. Expensive for the amount and the quality of the food."}
{"text":"Terrible food and service. When I requested a spicy dish I received a sweet dish. The waiter just got me to order to order over the phone and blamed the incident on me when I called again to ask why the order was messed up."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant several times because it is near the place I train. However, I don't think I will ever come back. 

We went there for supper with a big group. We were the only customers in the restaurant so you would expect good service. We waited for an hour before we were served. 15 minutes later, the waiter asked us if we were done and ready to pay. 

Really?"}
{"text":"BEST NAAN. 

Authentic curry, with the exception of their butter chicken (way too sweet). 
It is rather expensive for what you get. It'd be nice if their curry orders included either naan or rice."}
{"text":"This place served me the worst Indian food I have ever eaten anywhere in the world (I'm including my own cooking in this, by the way)

There's nothing much to say other than that the dishes are not authentic at all and taste nothing like they're supposed to. To top things off, the prices are quite expensive compared to what you'd pay for Indian food elsewhere in Montreal.

Avoid this place and check out almost any other restaurant in the city, you'd be hard-pressed to do worse."}
{"text":"Agréablement surpris par ce resto! Très bon accueil personnel poli et souriant 
On a reçu nos plats SANS aucun retard
Pas de musique d ambiance indienne
Tres large choix. Mais petite quantité c pour cela que le prix n est pas très élevé 
Sinon le meilleur pain naan jamais mangé
Allez y et commandez lamb karma !"}
{"text":"Worst Indian food ever eaten in Montreal! Poorest service ever..an attitude which is definitely not indian..Indians treat their guests very well..asha is not a good example..will never ever go back again..ill probably make some biriyani myself and serve it to them to show how it should really taste!"}
{"text":"We went here on Christmas Eve and we were grateful to be seated for an early (4:30 pm) dinner despite the restaurant not being open yet for dinner hours. Restaurant was warm and tastefully decorated. They have a large Indian centered menu in French and English. We ordered the tandoori chicken, beef, chicken, and eggplant curries, and a few orders of naan. Tandoori chicken was tasty and The garlic naan was particularly delicious. The curries did not have too much flavor. One other suggestion would be to have some Indian style music playing softly in the background to reduce kitchen noice and moments of silence (although this may have been due to us being seated early)"}
{"text":"This used to be my main restaurant go-to back in my college days with my buddies! The restaurant hasn't change at all, other than new owners. The chef, thankfully, has remained the same. We ate mostly vegetarian (I ordered Saag Paneer - not so great).

This is an ok Indian restaurant, well placed if you are on Parc Avenue, go to McGill or live in the McGill Ghetto. The service is nice, the restaurant quiet and child friendly! I do miss the burners they had to keep the food warm, however the quality was good.

Yes, you can get better Indian food elsewhere (on Jean Talon) but this will do and the memories that it brought back were immeasurable. :)"}
{"text":"I never dine-in at this restaurant, but I order take-out/delivery probably once a month from them. I love Indian food, and they're the only decent place nearby that delivers. I usually order the butter chicken. They always forget my diet coke. I don't think they've remembered it once. The butter chicken is really sweet and creamy. I like it, but of course it's not for everyone and it's probably not hugely authentic. Overall, this place is neither amazing nor horrible. It's decent. Also, the man who takes delivery orders is extremely grumpy, but I'm used to him by now."}
{"text":"Used to come here all the time back in college with my roommates.  Great Indian food with a wide variety of menu items.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I was shocked at how bad this place was. Although of Colombian decent, I was raised eating both authentic Pakistani and Indian cuisine. I was appalled at how inauthentic some of the dishes were. I came with a large party and we all shared our meals: 

The lamb korma was despicable, it literally tasted like they added a pound of sugar. The butter chicken is not authentic at all. It was also too sweet. The vindaloo and bhuna were very good. 

The service was awful. The appearance of the place is dreadful (if the food is good I do not let the appearance even be a factor) and there was no music. Just dead silence. The two waiters were rude and not friendly."}
{"text":"Great experience. They happily accommodated my wife and our baby with large stroller. Korma and butter chicken was sweet which my wife was very happy with. Chana masala was amazing. So good we ate here again the following night, close walk from the Hilton Garden Inn. Such friendly service, even gave us dessert on the house after a nice chat of our trips to India. Shocked by the previous reviews."}
{"text":"I came during lunch where you pay 9.99 for a small soup (nice), main course (ok) and a desert (was the best part of the meal). The naan bread is an extra 2.5$.
When I go to eat Indian foid I expect a blast of flavours, this was ok..I mean for about 5$ I would say ok..but I had so much better Indian food for so much less. I was very disappointed and I guess they wont get a chance to change my mind for this price or this food quality."}
