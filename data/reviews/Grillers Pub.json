{"text":"Great food. Great music. Great atmosphere. A true Parma Pub! Bring your friends."}
{"text":"Awesome food, karaoke on Friday night and live music on Saturday. Great bar with dance,floor, pool table and darts. Covered patio is great in the summer."}
{"text":"You wouldn't expect such a fantastic menu at a small little pub on state rd in Parma. But let me tell you Chuck and Rich are obviously foodies. The stuffed mushrooms with herb and cream cheese filling is better than any crab stuffed mushroom I've ever had and don't get me started on the Reuben balls holy cow. Fantastic juicy burgers and the Mac and cheese made to order WOW.  When the cook comes out and asks how the food was that says it all. And the eye candy bar keeps... Great place for casual fun with highbrow food. Thanks Grillers always nice to be surprised."}
{"text":"I had the opportunity to stop in on a rather lazy, late Sunday afternoon recently with a buddy of mine. The bar had a few patrons, and I felt very comfortable with the atmosphere. I had been here for drinks before, since they support live local music several days of the week. Around 5:00 PM, an acoustic duo began performing, and the crowd shuffled in. In no time, we were all engaged by listening to some great acoustic hits. We ordered some food, and I was very impressed with the menu. You have not only your typical bar food turned up a notch, but it also had some very interesting twists, to those usually simple dishes. The food was excellent, and it surpassed food found in trendier restaurants in the area. I later found out, Michael was the person who had prepared our food. He definitely has skills when it comes to food prep and presentation. I had the pleasure of being served by our barmaid, Kelly. She is awesome, with great people skills. She informed us of upcoming events, as well as a little bit about the ownership. Apparently, the owner is also a chef who had worked and managed other local bar/restaurants catering to live music. He definitely knows how to put a winning team together. The place is small in size, but not in performance. Do stop in, if you either like live music, but even more if your a foodie."}
{"text":"Fast and Courteous service was complimented by the mouth watering  wings and homemade onion rings. Their motto says it all \"small place, big taste\" or something along those lines. I will be going back for more. Prices are fair, the staff is down to earth and inviting, and the owner made us feel welcome by turning the fryers back on after the kitchen already closed.  Plenty of amazing micro brews to choose from at a good price point.  Great things can come in small packages, and grillers pub is a prime example."}
{"text":"Went there this past Thursday to check out their jam night. Stayed for 2 bands..which were both GOOD (that's why I even gave 2 stars.) Here's the downfalls for me; $4.00 for Capt. Morgan? I can go right around the corner & get it cheaper. 4.00 for 5 wings, I ordered garlic butter parmesan..I hear butter, I think SAUCE. Nope, dry rub & only 3 of my wings were juicy in my opinion. Lastly, the bartender was cute, but needs to smile more & pay attention to her guests more. The gentleman next to me kept getting her attention for me (he was a regular). I also forgot to ask for bleu cheese when I ordered & expected to get it when my wings were delivered, but she dropped my wings off & took off. Didn't ask me how I was until I was literally taking my last bite (wings weren't very meaty either) Sorry for picking this place apart, but I take great pride in good service as I am in the biz too!"}
{"text":"Two words: pickle shots. The service here is excellent and the bartenders are fun and lively. I love the music and the atmosphere. The outside can seem a bit sketchy, but go inside regardless! It's a great place to grab a drink."}
{"text":"Great food & great atmosphere!  I recommend this place to all my friends.  Great staff and Fridays are always fun with a great dj!"}
{"text":"I wish I could rate this higher.  First. Don't let the tiny non descript building fool you. Stop in and be amazed! This is the my favorite pub to eat at. They have a VEGGIE BURGER!! YAY!!!! With your burger ( of course they have traditional burgers) you can get  fresh cut fries, fresh cut chips, onion rings or TATER TOTS with it. TATER TOTS PEOPLE!!! The pretzel sticks they have..... words FAIL. The dipping sauce with it, omg I could eat it on anything. Did I mention they have tater tots? You can get them on their own a variety of ways. Black? and blue, hot and totts, BLT, loaded or build your own: cheese, bacon, onions, wing sauce, or tomato. If you're a meat eater try my former favorite the pub 'shrooms. They are big mushroom caps stuffed with a roasted garlic-herb cream cheese with bacon. The sauce with it is sublime. Another meat favorite was  the Shrimp Po' Boy. Hand-battered fried shrimp, tomatoes, shredded lettuce, and buttermilk horseradish sauce on a fresh hoagie roll. The also offer a wonderful mac and cheese with or without bacon. Also, let me say they have TATER TOTS. Where else can you get tater tots? NO WHERE THAT'S WHERE!!  Come in to eat and check out the impressive beer selection. This is a place not too be missed!"}
{"text":"All i need to say is wow best beer selection best burgers and wings ive had in a while great fun thanks grillers"}
{"text":"We came here to use a Living Social deal.  Sat down.  GREAT beer selection.  Ordered food.  Proceeded to watch the OWNER play with speakers..etc. ... then go and make food after not washing his hands!!!!  And then the other guy in the kitchen rubbed his sweaty face the grabbed buns that we were gonna eat!!!!!  We called then out at they remade our fried food after I said something.  Bartender was emabarrased...but its disgusting    Seriously.....do not eat here. I feel badly for saying..but they are nasty and Its disgusting!!"}
{"text":"We stopped on a Weds. which happened to be trivia night. It's a small room with a circular bar, 2 u shaped booths and 3 tables. There was only 1 bartender and she was working hard to keep up. They do have an outside patio for smokers, but we didn't go out. It's basically burgers but the home made potato chips were awesome.   The club sandwich was served warm and was delicious! I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Great homemade food! Especially recommend their Buffalo Mac and Cheese, it's out of this world! Tater tots come prepared many different ways. Happy hour on Fridays includes cheap drinks and free food from 5-7.  There are also 4 dart boards so bring your darts for a game or 2."}
{"text":"They have great bar food! If you are looking for a cheap beer, pierogies on your burgers, or a super tasty gyro, this is your place!"}
{"text":"Great  karaoke on Friday nights but try to get a drink you can the bartenders too busy stocking the bar only 10 people in the bar doesn't really care about our drinks.    Owner sitting at the end of our oblivious to everything that is happening.   Left them down the street to get another drink"}
{"text":"We go here for karaoke on Friday Nights. They are getting a new host, but Kidd Productions has a great staff so I am sure he or she will still be awesome. There food is AWESOME as far as bar food goes. I have only ever gone on Friday Nights, but a word to the wise: the super skinny blond bartender tends to skimp as far as drinks go and is often not willing to personalize an order. I would suggest the other bartender who is also blond, but looks like she eats and is WAY friendlier."}
{"text":"Great food, great laid-back crowd.  The bartenders are really nice and the craft beer selection is bigger than anywhere else in the area."}
{"text":"Very sketchy looking building. Old and dirty inside. Bathrooms are tiny and claustrophobic. The cook had some definite culinary skills as the food was presented nicely. The kitchen is tiny and did not look clean. Cook used his bare hands to prepare ready to eat foods. He used a dirty looking towel that was hanging over a pipe to wipe the excess dressing off a prepared burger. Our server was very nice and helpful. It did take nearly an hour to receive our order and there were only 4 in our party, plus we were one of the only parties in there. I have to admit I worried about getting food poisoning after seeing some of the things that happened. No one in our party did. I would not go back only due to the unhygienic activities that I witnessed."}
{"text":"We've gone here many times to catch up with friends and to grab a bite to eat.  The bartender Tara is amazingly friendly and makes you feel welcome. We have enjoyed all the different food we've ordered - it comes hot and tasty to the table. We will definitely go back."}
