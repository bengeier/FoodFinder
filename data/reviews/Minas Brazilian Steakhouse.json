{"text":"Excellent Brazilian Steakhouse.  13 different kinds of meat, hot & cold buffet items that are fantastic and dessert buffet my hubby squeezed in at the end.  I was too stuffed to partake in dessert but it looked very yummy.   I've been to the other Brazilian places in town and this one shot to the top for us.  We considered keeping this place secret but we just can't...it's that good.  Great service and wonderful ambiance rounded out this visit.  We will be back.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time after reading positive reviews on Yelp and other places.  Food and service were very good!  Would definitely be going back there and making recommendations to my friends."}
{"text":"In town for the week and wanted a great steak house.  This place had Great food! Great atmosphere! Great people!  Highly recommended when in Calgary!  The Parmesan Beef & Garlic Beef were phenomenal."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing! My friends and I went there for a nice meal last weekend, the place was packed with people. We waited a little to get into the place, but the wait was well worth it.  I'm glad that we came to this place, worth every penny we spent there.  Amazing service, amazing food, and the price is just right."}
{"text":"Was excited to finally try this place and was extremely disappointed with both the quality and quantity of meats. We were there at a busy time and it seemed like no coincidence that the good meats only came around a few times while the cheap ones were readily available. I understand the cost differences but when you are paying this much for a meal it shouldn't matter."}
{"text":"Excellent, Brazilian flavoured meats. Prepared fresh and juicy. The side dishes are more than just afterthoughts, they are excellent examples of real cooking. A nice selection of sweet desserts, good salad bar and overall nice ambiance. All this would rate 4.5 stars by itself, but the service is what really makes it 5 stars. Friendly and informal, yet attentive and quick. We are very pleased with our first visit. Looking forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"I'm honestly scratching my head and wondering if all the people who have written reviews for this place are friends and family of the restaurant owner or what? Starting off with what they call their \"salad bar\" had no salad. Everything on their salad bar was dry, stale, and frankly I don't think my dog would want to eat half the stuff they had.   Then comes the meats that they bring and cut for you table side. Every piece of meat they brought had a very strong odor and were extremely dry and don't even get me started on the taste. I have never in my life been so disappointed with a Brazilian bbq.   If you love meat then do not go here as it may turn you into a vegetarian. Absolutely garbage food. Will never return not even if they paid me."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful!  We are regulars here, and I can definitely tell you that the high quality meat is excellent and consistent! The sides make this place more authentic than other Brazilian steakhouses in Calgary. Their authentic sides are well done and they are generous each time they come around with meat skewers. Many places also try to only feed you lower quality meats but not this place!  Thanks Minas!"}
{"text":"The meat is too salty to eat as much as you can. I ate their meat just for one round but it kept me feeling salty and thirsty for the next two day.   The hot dishes and salad bar are pretty good."}
{"text":"Great place for Sunday brunch, and a good relaxed atmosphere it's great for socializing. Me and my wife eat a lot so for us it's a great value"}
{"text":"Not sure why this restaurant gets so many great reviews. Maybe it's my taste, but the experience I had was less than mediocre. The quality of the meat is not good. I know this because I recognize good quality meats by just tasting them. The ambiance feels a little \"awkward\" if that makes any sense, I can't really explain why. Maybe it was the service, not sure. The only thing that I would say is positive, are the portion sizes, they are adequate. Having said that, I wouldn't go back ."}
{"text":"Perfect for lunch! Great price and amazing meat, soo tasty and delicious. It was hard to choose - I wanted to eat everything! Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Location a bit hidden.  The food was great and salad bar had a good mix of hot food/salad options.  A variety of meats... My favorites were the pork and chicken.  Would highly recommend people check this place out.  Servers came around often with meat options."}
{"text":"We came in early for a 5pm dinner reservation on a Friday.  We were the first there and the staff was very welcoming.    The salad bar or more accurately, appetizer bar is very extensive and twice the size of Bolero.  There is so much variety, both hot and cold, you could have a great dinner there alone and I found myself having to hold back so I didn't diminish my meatarian opportunity.  Several highlights from the salad bar is the salmon sashimi and the excellent hard cheese.  Surprisingly, I had picked up some tomato/cheese salad. I found the tomatoes a great palate refresher between courses.  Something like the ginger at a Japanese restaurant.   The staff brought skewer after skewer of various meat selections.  Lamb, pork, chicken and of course beef.  The sirloin was my favorite.  The roasts were initially at medium rare, which is perfect for us, but they went towards well done by the time we were done.  I can understand that there was a slow start to the dinner rush and the roasts were on the spit for a while.    We were stuffed as to be expected and went with a light dessert, the mango mousse.  This was excellent and not heavy like a chocolate cake or cheesecake.    Service was great and the restaurant has as mentioned an outstanding salad/appetizer bar that is worth going to alone.  The restaurant also has an intimate atmosphere and more so than another Brazillian steakhouse, Bolero.    Several differences between the two of note are the Bolero has 1/2 the salad bar selection (which is still a good experience none the less), Bolero has perhaps 50% more roast selections and for my wife and I, several very desirable selections, specifically the glazed roasted pineapple and the roasted Halloumi cheese that is somewhere between mozzarella and feta in texture and flavour.  We prefer Minas for atmosphere and salad bar, but the greater variety of roasts, plus the glazed pineapple and roasted cheese are the deal breakers that lead us to prefer Bolero.  You certainly won't go wrong though to go to Minas and it's a very positive experience."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful experience at Minas this evening... Our server Sophia was on the ball, the food variety was plentiful and the flavours were amazing.  Love the contemporary decor and the ambient music  was at just the proper level for good conversation.  We would highly suggest this restaurant to others."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, fantastic service.  This might actually be my new favourite restaurant. The flavours are incredible and everything is cooked to perfection. Add to that the warm, courteous staff and perfect atmosphere and you've pretty much nailed it. Prices are very good as well. I'll be going back soon."}
{"text":"Best Brazilian steakhouse I've been too, including fogo de chao in Texas... Also some of the best quality food and service in the city. Highly worth a visit."}
{"text":"Giving this place one star is generous. It was awful. I don't know why it's so well reviewed. Every piece of meat was extremely dry and tasted very gamey. The salad bar and additional hot pieces seemed as if they were sitting there for days. We went at prime time dinner hours as well. I definitely won't be going back there again."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant ! The food is amazing, the servers are really sweet and generous and always have a smile on their face. I recently went here for a friend's birthday and I would say it was perfect, it's definitely worth the price. For two people it came up to $115 plus tip but I would for sure come back. I really enjoyed it :)"}
{"text":"Quality service and amazing food. I went with my girlfriend and we felt very comfortable and well received. The famous minas cheese bread is very authentic and tasty."}
{"text":"I guess I'm used to Brazilian joints with gigantic salad bars, which is why I like them. Mina's has a tiny salad bar, but the quality is good and there's a variety of hot side dishes to choose from. The pinto beans were incredible--as was the pork shoulder and the hot sausage."}
{"text":"Food and service were awesome! I haven't been to other brazilian places to compare but this will do just fine! Meat was a little slow to come around but worth the wait! Parmesan steak and brisket was soon good as well as the chicken wings! Service was just as good! Got a wonderful surprise when it came time  to pay... Tuesdays are lunch prices all day!"}
{"text":"The food was ok...the service was excellent. The meats lacked flavour and some of it was undercoomed as well....it was a decent experience but I will not come back."}
{"text":"Was in Calgary for a day and was really craving some Brazilian steak. This place was rated #1 for Brazilian steak in the city, so I decided to give it a shot. It was very good for Sunday lunch with a couple of friends. The meats were high quality and juicy and seasoned just right. The salad and side bar selection was very good and tasty as well and this is where I give them the edge over Gaucho Brazilian which is also in Calgary (though it's been over a year since I've eaten at Gaucho). Give them a shot! I've been to Brazilian steakhouses in Texas and California as well, and while I wouldn't say Minas is the best, it's best you'll find in Calgary."}
{"text":"Fantastic. Great deal on Tuesday night offering lunch prices for dinner. Make sure you starve yourself the entire day. They really nailed the food across the board. Friendly staff and very good service. Another great reason to visit Calgary. Bravo!"}
{"text":"My favourite place in Calgary, I go there every week, best meat and buffet, service is great"}
{"text":"I love Brazilian and travel quite a bit...so tend to hit up these places when I find them.  Tonight unfortunately I was quite disappointed.    Definitely a lower key setting than I expected.  Simple wood tables and neutral decor.  Clean and functional.  The service unfortunately was lacking.  No other Brazilian restaurant I've even been to have I been able to leave my chip on green until I was ready for the check.  It wasn't busy, but even so they appeared either understaffed or the staff was distracted elsewhere.    The salad bar was good with a reasonably good selection including some seafood and simple desserts which was a nice touch.    The meat selection was both lacking and varied.  Chicken hearts are new to me (and on the menu) but missing out on filet and bottom sirloin was odd to say the least.  Usually I expect 12ish cuts.  I believe we were offered 7 or 8.  The quality of the meat was mediocre at best.  For the amount of fat on the I would expect much more flavor (not to mention larger pieces served).  My coworker was pretty much unable to get a rare or medium rare piece of anything so settled for medium or skipping options.  Drinks and the check were equally slow to come.   While the price was moderately less than I've spent elsewhere, I'd have gladly paid more for a better experience."}
{"text":"Really nice Brazilian restaurant. The Parmesan crusted beef was fantastic, as were many of the other meat choices. They brought around only a couple different skewers at a time, which is good because the meat was always fresh and hot. The buffet had some good offerings as well, the cheese buns were soooo tasty.  We went on their opening night, which was busy but we still had great service and had a chance to chat with one of the owners who was just lovely. It's so nice to support these really high quality local restaurants. We will go again next time we are looking for a nice night out."}
{"text":"Out of all the Brazilian restaurants in Calgary, this is the one everyone should go to. It truly brings the tastes of home to the plate. It feels like it is a place made for Brazilians to enjoy a taste of home, where all Calgarians are invited and more than welcomed to come. The variety of the cuts of meat are equal to the other Brazilian steakhouses in town, but the difference can be seen in the quality and the execution of the churrasco. More traditional things like Fried Polenta, Pao de Queijo, Toicinho, and the Feijoada are done to perfection.  Specially on the Feijoada front, where Bolero believes it is a mix water and beans, with a few pimentos thrown in. Truly, Bolero is for folks without taste buds, and the issue with Gaucho is that no matter how hard they try, it's missing a \"I want to come back\" factor. Execution lacks and the salad bar is too minimalist without focusing on the best of the best. Truly, Minas is already our go-to Brazilian place in town."}
{"text":"This place was delicious!  I have been for my birthday the last two years.  Can't go wrong if you like a good Brazilian Steakhouse!"}
{"text":"Yummmm! A double date, led me to this little gem. There are a few of these Brazilian-style meat-a-rama's, around town, and this one does not disappoint. Fourteen different meats, delivered to your table frequently and the salad bar is nothing to sneeze at either (the mini-cheese muffins are perfect to make tiny tasty meat sandwiches).  And it is a lot cheaper compared to most. That being said, bring a $50 bill, enjoy your water and you'll be fine.  Go hungry and go with your boys, or your lady gals who enjoy a good pig out."}
{"text":"Steak is popular in Brazil and what a better place to have a steak than in a steakhouse. Although the house is not made of steak it is still a pleasant atmosphere."}
{"text":"Charges a small business fee after takes and also calculates tip after tax making it more. Sleazy business moves."}
{"text":"We have all by this stage been to one of the Brazilian BBQ restaurants in town. They all work pretty much the same way so wanted to let you know what I really liked about Minas.  First, in my booking I mentioned it was a belated mothers day lunch, and when we arrived their was a chalkboard sign on the table saying \"Happy belated Mothers Day\". Just a little touch but was lovely to see.  Service was excellent from our server. She was attentive but didn't crowd us. Never had an issue with a pile of plates in front of us waiting to be taken away.  Also really liked that it didn't feel like we were being pushed into buy more things from them. For example the waitress let us know right at the beginning that there are some desserts on the buffet, but there were additional ones on the menu if we were interested in those. Giving me options without the sneaky \"get you to order before you realise they cost more\" tactic some places have.  Good selection of salads and hot food. Nothing was overly rich which left a little more space for more meat.  Some of the meats were a little dry. But the pork shoulder was well seasoned and moist; the lamb had an amazing rub on the outside that was almost sweet; and the sirloin was soft and flavourful.  I can never really eat enough to justify all you can eat meat, but really enjoyed Minas. Would go back."}
{"text":"This place has a nice ambiance, though a bit noisy for those of us with hearing issues. The staff was professional and enthusiastic. The food was awesome. The dessert was a bit less than expected but we were in very late. We will go back!"}
{"text":"The service was great, but the food was so-so. I expected higher quality and better tasting meat, especially considering the price. Also, for a buffet, there were very few items to choose from and many items were already out by the time we went for seconds, especially the desserts.   Overall, I liked the vibe, but the restaurant could do better in terms of food quality."}
{"text":"First of all, I would like to state that I am not related to or know anybody who works with or is connected with Mina's. lol.  This being said, this is a gem of a place.  The \"sides' table was fantastic.  This alone would stuff you (maybe that was the idea) :  The only thing missing was a selection of....salad.  Would be nice to have a choice of lighter fare before chomping down on all the different meat selections.  BBQs tasted great but was favouring the lamb and wings a bit more.  Service and ambience was great too as our server was always around when you needed her.  Will surely make a trip back. Credited parking would have made it a perfect place to visit as your main parking options are all paid parking lots."}
{"text":"OMG everything was so delicious! So I arrived at the restaurant really early! But the staff was super friendly and they let me wait inside and have a coffee! Right on time they let me go in and take a seat ! And then BOOOMMM the food starts to come the salads were very good super fresh! The meat was cooked perfectly the beans were delicious and the deserts were like heaven ! All the staff was really friendly and the ambiant make me feel really comfortable! An absolute great experience!"}
{"text":"So this place is a Brazilian steakhouse meaning that the cooks come around with the meat on large skewers. There's great variety from chicken hearts to chorizo sausage to lamb. You have a little triangle with a red side and a green side. Green means: go ahead and lay that delicious meat on me while red means stop or pause.  The service was friendly and all you can eat buffet and mean was $42. On the weekdays it is $35.   Yelp rarely lets me down when travelling but in this instance the place was oversold. I'd recommend getting reservations for sure because otherwise you get a little spot in the back of the restaurant behind a cement pillar.   The side dishes had a nice selection of salads and potatoes. There was salmon sashimi and cubed ham and cheese salad so there was no unifying theme. The cold dishes were OK and then was also breakfast potatoes a sort of shepherds pie and a selection of vegetables and breads. Also a lot of desserts available.   The meat part was a bit of a letdown. With the barbeque selection just didn't have a lot of Flavor. The chicken drumsticks and chorizo of sausage record but the pork and the roast beef or flavourless and the pork was very dry.  When meat is the focus of the restaurant, it needs to be the star. I just didn't think that was the case here."}
{"text":"Great experience, I love it!!! It is amazing I truly recommend this place, the deserts are amazing too!!!"}
{"text":"We have been regulars at this place and we used to love it. But today, it has nothing been but the worst service we have had in all of dining out. So bad that I had to review as soon as I got out. Our waitress didn't greet us properly, did not ask if we needed any drinks, and didn't clear our plates. The host did that all. Despite the horrible service from her, I still proceeded to give her a tip as she stood with the machine. She didn't say thank you, and was so rude. There was another table next to us and she said thank you and have a great day to the other table- NOT US. She left without a word and grabbed the cash tip we gave her as if she was ungrateful that we were there. Whoever that server is today- we did not get her name, I hope she realizes how horrible she was today, and the fact that we are Asians and the people next to us were Canadians and got the service everyone deserved just shows how this can be a little if not wholly racist. I am so appalled by this service. I can't believe it."}
{"text":"Salad bar choices are average with a limited selection.  Selection of meats where limited, with emphasis on chicken and sausage and pork.  Service of meat was slow.  Some of the meats where dry and grizzly.  Desert bar was also limited.  We are here during The Calgary Rodeo.  Towns largest annual event.  You would've thought they would gear up for this week of business!"}
{"text":"This was the first and definitely not the last Brazilian Steakhouse if they are anything compared to here! It was absolutely fantastic from start to finish. The atmosphere was chilled, the restaurant seemed clean and the food was delicious. It's a really fun evening out as the chefs are continuously coming round with freshly cooked meats, until you tell them to stop it'll keep coming. They have a full Buffett with all your sides, but my tip is not to fill your plate with sides as there's so much meat. Next time I'm in Calgary I will definitely check it out again!"}
{"text":"I wish I had taken pictures but I was too busy eating to notice that I didn't take a single picture I could share and not because it wasn't picture worthy but it was just too good that a thought of taking a picture never even crossed my mind. The service at Mina's was very pleasant and I was very comfortable. The 14 variety of meats were served at a timely manner, and thier hot an cold buffet bar is what I call a dream buffet. Filled with a variety of hot and cold goodies full of flavour nothing frozen I was sad because I couldn't fit anymore food. There wasnt one item I didn't want to try having said that I didn't want to come out of my food coma. My first experience here at Mina's is definitely not the last and it's worth every damn dollar! :D"}
{"text":"We went to Mina's for dinner tonight. We inquired about ladies night before we ordered drinks, food etc. Server said it was and was very helpful at first. Food was amazing and all the staff were great.   Only thing that really threw us off was once our bill came, the 20% off for ladies night was not applied. (Which in this case is quite significant since our bill was almost 100 dollars). Once we told our server she forgot the discount she acted very irritated and didn't apologize for forgetting, she said nothing at all. We weren't upset about her forgetting and we tried joking with her \" I'm glad we didn't forget about the discount, that's quite a big difference\". She seemed very inconvenienced, and honestly it just seemed really shady. If we didn't bring it up, she definitely wouldn't have corrected it. We are just very annoyed since we asked about the discount before even sitting then she \"forgot\", and no apologies, just an immediate change in attitude.   Brought down what would have been an excellent experience."}
{"text":"Great place to go into meat coma. Very good and great quality Brazilian steakhouse. Staff were very friendly and you can still the owner really values customer services and cleanliness."}
{"text":"Valentine's dinner for two! Found this place on Yelp and decided to try it based on the awesome reviews. We made our reservations on Yelp too and the restaurant called us within minutes to confirm.  The service 5/5. Right from when we walked in the hostess was polite and friendly. The meat servers were so nice they help us check off our meat list and made sure any meats we haven't tried came out next. The servers came often and we never had to wait too long for the food.  For the food 4/5. They have a good selection of sides and salads. All taste great and accompanied the meats really well. We came for dinner and there were 14 meat selection. My favourite was the garlic steak and the chorizo sausage. But the other steaks were just over cooked for me (personal preference). Overall it was delicious.....BUT pace yourself or you might be too full for dessert!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Always a pleasure place to eat out Brazilian BBQ.  Friendly staff and great food, good location with lots of parking (paid)."}
{"text":"Beautiful food beautifully presented. Obvious attention to detail. Would comeback in a heartbeat. The trick here is pacing yourself. They keep bringing meat, and they will keep bringing it until the unthinkable happens: no room for dessert!"}
{"text":"This has got to be some of the best value that you  can get in Calgary. Not only because of the quality of the food but the variety is also great. From salads, salmon, lamb to obviously flawless beef Minas will not disappoint. I have only been during lunch but I've heard at night it's even better, with 13 kinds of meat instead of eight."}
{"text":"I eat for taste and Minas delivers in a huge way! From the chilled items on the salad bar to the 13 different skewered meats I was in heaven. The service is top notch and the atmosphere is relaxed and slightly more casual then other Brazilian Steakhouses we have been to but that is definitely not a complaint. My specific favourites were the avocado salad which I kept a constant supply of to break up the insane amount if meat I was indulging in, especially things \"bacon wrapped\"  and \"parmesan crusted\" it was hard to say no but it's even more important to pace yourself, after all its a marathon not a sprint. The drink/wine selection looked incredible too (Sommelier on hand) but I had to refrain as I'm with child, but my husband loved his cocktails that we could watch the bartender whip up. Also a decent amount of seafood cooked and raw for you to enjoy. Not really anymore expensive then going out for a steak in Calgary but so much more when it come to flavour and options. Everything was incredible. I recommend making a reservation if planning on peak times. My mouth is watering just thinking about how delicious it all was. ** also don't drive around forever looking for parking, its directly across from the Eau Claire underground parking which is worth the $5ish to park. Or walk, the jaunt home will help you process all that food)"}
{"text":"Fantastic food!! Fantastic friendly service. New (to me) service delivery concept.  Short-list this one!!"}
{"text":"Went at lunch and the buffet was delicious as well as the meat that came by.  My favorite was the Parmesan beef...if you like a little salty this was so good.  They seemed to be short staff and we finally had to go up to the bar to pay.  Will be back another time."}
{"text":"I really like this place. You get as much food as you want with only 24$! The food quality is great and people  working there are so friendly. I really recommend this restaurant, especially to those who love meat! But don't get coffee from this place, it's so expensive!!!"}
{"text":"Mina's is such a gem of a restaurant which I like to consider Calgary's secret amongst the steak loving community. The food is the best cuts of steak, chicken and all sorts of meat that you can have. If you go for lunch, the price is so low that I promise that you will be left stunned with the quality of food and service that you received.  Even though dinner is more expensive, it is still a place to be with a great vibe and ambiance for all occasions."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate at Minas in October, 2015.  We decided to make reservations ahead of time through Yelp.  I recommend that everyone make a reservation, online, as this guarantees you a table when you get there.  The reservation was for 1:30 p.m. on a Saturday afternoon.  We thought we would miss the noon hour crowd, but we were wrong.  When we arrived the steakhouse was filled with people.  We had obviously caught the end of the lunch time crowd, and the place was noisy and packed.  The restaurant started to thin out around 2:30 p.m. which is the perfect time to go on a Saturday afternoon.  Right across the street from Minas is Eau Claire Market.  After our mid-afternoon lunch, we went to the cinema at Eau Claire Market to catch a movie that we wanted to see.     The food at Minas Brazilian Steakhouse was excellent; we ate until we could not eat another morsel.  The only downside was the wine list which was on the expensive side.  The food itself was a little more than $50 for two people, which is a bargain by today's standards and we sampled all the varieties of meats and salads on offer.   The wait staff were attentive and friendly.  All in all, we had a great time and Minas is worthy of a return visit."}
{"text":"We came here for my son's birthday lunch to satiate his meat cravings.  Service was polite and appropriately attentive.  The meat options that came around to the tables were good- beef, sausage, chicken were all deliciously seasoned and tasty.  Buffet and dessert options were okay- just okay.  We ate a lot, but could have enjoyed a greater variety despite the limits of lunch service options here. We have eaten Brazilian BBQ lunch at Pampa as well and did note the fewer buffet selections here compared to Pampa.  I tried the Brazilian coffee- yum but strong, so be prepared! Not sure we'd come back here for Brazilian BBQ as preferred the greater variety at Pampa- but wouldn't be disappointed if we do."}
{"text":"If you are still looking for a delicious and fabulous BBQ and salad, you had better to try it!"}
{"text":"Average Brazillian Steakhouse. I was disappointed based on the high ratings.  Little option of desserts. Meat under heat lamp was dry.  The service from the kitchen was good."}
{"text":"The most authentic brazilian style barbecue out of Brazil yet. I say that because I've been in some brazilian steakhouses and Minas really surprised me! They really keep the quality as high as the most expensive steakhouses you'd find in Brazil, but with a very affordable all-you-can-eat of meat and buffet. Their parmesan crusted  filet is insanely good definitely a must try, the grilled chicken hearts are also very well done, loved it. The service is always good too. One of my favorite places in Calgary. 5 stars all the way!"}
{"text":"Was great a like costly, but great the lamb was my absolute favorite. I tried to eat anything that walked by almost impossible. Must try if in Calgary Canada."}
{"text":"The meats were moist, tender, and flavourful, but it was brought to our table at a furious pace - it seems as if we were expected to finish all the selections in the first hour! We arrived at 7PM; by 7:30 we started to feel stuffed. So a word to the wise: come here with a big appetite."}
{"text":"Authentic brasilian food with friendly staff. Great selection of typical brasilian foods Nice decor."}
{"text":"Our first visit to Mina's and it won't be our last!  We had their Sunday Brunch $24.99 and for seniors, it's 20% discount.  The buffet of salads, hot and cold sides was really good.  I especially like the palm hearts and tomatoes, cheese bread, grilled cold asparagus, potato salad and other salads like loaves of bread, salsa, Caesar salad and coleslaw.  I like the hot sides - especially the prawns, pork & black beans, brown beans, white rice & vege rice.  For Sunday brunch, there's also breakfast items like bacon, yogurt, cereal, made-to-order eggs including eggs benedict with a Brazilian flair!    Excellent cuts of meat - 9 if you want to count them all!  This is just for the Sunday Brunch:   Picanha - Top Sirloin - Love it! Alcatraz - Prime Beef Hips - Absolutely love it! Bife a Parmegiano - Beef Parmesan - A little tough for me. Asa de Franco - Chicken Wings - Really good. Curacao de Franco - Chicken Hearts - Absolutely love it! Linguica de Porco - Pork Sausages - Delicious! Chorizo Apimentado - Chorizo Sausages - Spicy little sausages - love the kick! Corte do Porco - Pork Loin or Shoulder - OMG!  Delicious! (reminds me a little of the Chinese \"siu yoke\" but more tender)  Peña de Carneiro - Leg of Lamb - Quite nice.  Desserts and fruits were the last items to attack at the buffet.  Luckily the desserts were cut in small little bites as then it didn't seem it was a lot if you ate these little bites after eating all that food!  LOL  If you're getting full, they provide a red/green sign for the chef.  Green - keep bringing meat.  Red - please stop bringing meat.  Restaurant is situated on the main level below a fairly new condo complex near the Eau Claire Market.  Parking is on-street or at Eau Claire Market.  Great customer service and very attentive service!"}
{"text":"Great food, but the meat came out a bit slower and not much variety to choose from in comparison to other Brazilian steakhouse places I have been to in Houston,  TX (Fogo de Chao). Their appetizers and sides were delicious, especially the mashed potatoes! Great hit with the family."}
{"text":"Ever since I heard Minas was a thing, I'd been meaning to check it out for lunch as I work downtown. Finding someone to go with me was like pulling teeth - everyone wanted a lighter option, and I can't blame them for that. I ended up booking off 2 hours on a Friday for lunch and found myself a willing partner in crime, and off we went!   The atmosphere of the restaurant was a really perfect blend between classy and comfortable - after all, I would hate to have to be on my best behavior whilst stuffing my face with meat. The décor was a good match and the spacing of the tables wasn't too tight.   All meals come with the buffet sides. The buffet sides selection was effectively a full buffet, with proteins, veggies, salads, and dessert. They even did a pretty cool sashimi style (Sweet soy?) cured salmon, which was awesome. Even that alone would be a good time, but for an extra 4-5$, why not get the full rodizio, eh?   The meat was excellent - my favourite was the parm beef and the garlic beef, followed closely by the lamb. My least favourite were the sausages. Overall though, it was all really really great - service is prompt and the pace is very suitable.   It was definitely at least a 1.5 hr affair, and I was definitely a bit snoozy when I got back to the office, but for $23, this was awesome!   I'd definitely come again soon - if I can scrounge up another person for a weekday lunch indulgence."}
{"text":"Wow wow wow!!! My husband and I went to this place when we were visiting Calgary during Christmas!! This place is awesome and impressed us so much with the food and it's options!! We feel we were in meat heaven!! The price was higher then average meals but for Christmas or special occasions this is sooo worth it!! I'm glad that I got a discount from Yelp for 10% off but you have to try this place at least once! I know usually for Brazilian BBQ usually isn't cheap but this place is actually the cheaper one in Calgary! ( instead of 3 dollar sign it's a 2 dollar sign! ) there are so many meat options that they bring to your table to slice it for you! However there are also really good gourmet buffet on the side with some amazing desserts!!"}

{"text":"Sunday night for a family meal... the resto is cozy and inviting and tables are well spaced.  The buffet had a decent selection but not extensive like other restos offering a similar churrasco experience,   The service was slow both upon entry after being seated and waiting for the bill. I expected the waitress to greet us fairly quickly to explain how the restaurant works etc. Even though we've visited all other Brazilian BBQ places in town and know how it works, they were not prompt.   Food was very good and the selection varied from Chicken drumsticks to bacon wrapped chicken, lamb, spicy pork, ribs and steak and Parmesan crusted beef.  I loved the rice and smoky black beans at the buffet and our son was a fan of the whipped mash potatoes.  We checked out dessert and I was a fan of the churros timbits as I call them With the coconut, and chocolate sauces and the guava jam. Hubby and son enjoyed the mini custard tarts and rice pudding.   Overall, this was a good night out and you can't go wrong with endless meats arriving at your table!"}
{"text":"Great service and customer service. Management and servers are very attentive to what the customer would like and always trying to work on making the place better. There are some good food choices like the Parmesan beef but what made me give them 4 stars was their customer service and how quick they were to help solving any issues that arose. The atmosphere was great! I was very surprised at how large and open seating they had for the night. They did a good job with the lighting the music for Saturday night was not my cup of tea but hey they had music verses no music."}
{"text":"Best taste of home in Calgary! If you've had churrasco in Brazil, you might have been a little disappointed around here. The black and brown beans were perfectly seasoned (in a way you'd only notice if you've had them in Brazil). I love that they had polenta and pão de queijo on the buffet as well. They were so good! I could come back just for the buffet! The meat was divine, and as soon as the servers learned what our meat temperature preferences are, they cooked meat specifically for our table - talk about great service! The alcatra was divine.  We went for lunch (though they call it 'brunch') on a Saturday ($25pp) and were happy with the available buffet and meat options, they even brought around lamb! There's a picture on here of their menu that shows the meat options they have available for lunch and dinner.  There's a variety of Brazilian desserts as well. I had the passionfruit mousse and loved it!"}
{"text":"I am visiting Calgary from US. My family took me here since my cousin wants to try the food here and we already tried Bolero.  We went lunch time. The wait staff are friendly. The salad bar is good consist of vegetables, beans, salad, quinoa, rice and they also have fried chicken and fried pork which taste so good.  I rspecially like the cheese bread which I always look forward in a brazilian restaurant. They also have desserts like different kind of pastries, sweetened banana. 4 stars because I am not that impressed with the meat they served and so little choices. They had chkn wings, sausages, pork, parmesan beef, and lamb which came later when we're almost done. Maybe I am so used to Fogo de Chao wherein they have varieties even on lunch time.  The taste too is just OK.  Price is abt $22 and deal for the day is 20% for all women which is ok for the food we had. I recommend this restaurant if you want to try brazilian style but i will not be back."}
{"text":"I'm Brazilian, born and raised and I live in Canada for few years now! The food at Minas is very Brazilian like , the appearance n flavor is very typical Brazilian , the caipirinha drinks made the proper way. I was sited away from the crowd per my request , but felt it was a mistake , felt I was forgotten many times.  Keep watching the Gauchos walk by with the meat n skipping my table. I manage to change that by telling the waiter , she was kind and talk to the staff making sure they didn't skip my table no more. Overall great experience n I'll def be back. Place is clean n the music playing was great selection of Brazilian MPB and jazz."}
{"text":"Since oct 1st, they now add an illegal 4% service fee to every bill, calling it a \"small business support fee\" This is in addition to everything else, including the expected tip. It will also be sales tax fraud if they choose not report the fee as sales for their GST filing because no GST is being collected at the time of sale on this service fee.  Watch out for the fine small print on the menu's because there's no transparency on this cash grab or any other future scheme they may invent. Very poor optics for any business. Taking my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Nice Brazilian streak house in calgary keeping in line with having one of the best sources of meat in North america. Well marinated and cooked very flavorful meats! Excellent service too!!"}
{"text":"We decided to give this place a try.  I've been to other Brazilian steakhouses in the city, and I had heard positive things about Mina's as well.  On walking in, the staff are quite polite and friendly.  The restaurant has a bit of a bistro atmosphere, not one of particularly fine dining, which was fine.  It felt like a place for a nice bunch or for a first date.  On sitting down, the service continued to be polite and usually quick.  We opted for the buffet and the offerings were mostly salads and sides because the meats will be brought to your table.  The sides were delicious, there really wasn't anything that I would specifically avoid.  The meats were brought to the table.  They had probably about 5-6 varieties of meats coming around.  The types of meats honestly were just okay.  The Italian sausage had a very \"pork\" flavour to it (not the good pork flavour, the more fleshy pork flavour).  The chicken was good, but dry.  The beef tasted very earthy, and the lamb tasted very rare.  Not their fault, but I think the meat just wasn't the types that I would usually like, or maybe they just weren't cooked the way that I usually like.  There weren't any sauces for them either, so you would typically eat the meats dry.  They had some desserts in the buffet area, as well, which were delicious.  You could order more items off the menu, but I think sticking to the buffet was more than enough.    In short, if I am downtown and looking for a good restaurant, I think I would come again.  But if I had a choice of any of the Brazilian steakhouses I've had in the city so far, this would second on the list (Bolero's definitely still is my favourite in this category)."}
{"text":"I really, really wanted to love this place but sadly, it fell a little short.   Let me begin by saying that Mina's is is fantastic! The service is top notch, atmosphere is lovely and the meats are phenomenal!! But where they fell short was the salad bar and sides... not many hot sides to choose from and a mildly lack lustre salad bar. While the options were above average for a buffet, there weren't too many to choose from. I will note that when the mashed potatoes had run out the floor manager did come to our table to let us know they'd been replenished.   I will rave again that the meats, as mentioned were outstanding! Every single meat that was presented was succulent, seasoned perfectly and cooked just right!!"}
{"text":"We went here for the Sunday Brunch. Amazing food. The steaks were delicious. And the pancakes too. Make sure you get it right off the pan when they are hot. Mmmm. And great service. Got a 10% discount too. Thanks Sophia."}
{"text":"Good service,  tons of meat,  and quality cuts. Only complaint is that the price is pretty steep. $300 for party of 3."}
{"text":"Ok ladies & gentlemen, Minas (not Mina's as some have labeled it) is the real deal. If you want authentic, delicious Brazilian churrascaria (rodizo = all you can eat barbecued meats) then you'll want to go to Minas. I rarely bother to do a review, because I read \"self-proclaimed experts\" spout off how great or lousy an establishment is )some are narcissistic snobs and I do not want to be associated with them. But Minas is so good, I'm sharing my experience with you and I hope if you go yours is as good or better than mine. The meats are delicious, ask to have them cut very thin, more flavor and more room for more to enjoy. Tops are picana' and prime. Go light on the salad bar, but have a little heart of palm w/drizzled olive oil, a tomato or two and mozzarella, a little feijoada (fa-shu-wada = Black bean, beef & pork soup. You can go back up for the grilled pineapple after the main course. Don't let the gauchos rush you, pace yourself and sample everything, even try at least one chicken heart. If you find a type of meat or two you like best, ask they will gladly bring you more of those. You have to try a caipirinha (like a mojoto only better (its lime, sugar cane, and cachaca - brazilan rum) national drink of Brazil. If you don't like alcoholic drinks, then have a Guarana. It's a unique berry fruit soft drink again from Brazil. To top it off you have have papaya cream w/liqueur drizzled on top, it's not on the dessert island, you have to order it from the kitchen. Last but not least have a Brazilian coffee (yes very strong but very small cup too) You can thank me later. So if you're looking for the closest thing to Brazil, outside of Brazil, this is it. Take it from a New Yorker who has traveled there many times, (Rio, Belo Horizonte, Porto Alegre) even lived in Sao Paulo Brazil for a while. I travel the world on business and search out the Churrascarias, I just found Minas and it tops the list. If you know or have been to Fogo de Ciao or Texas de Brazil, Minas is every bit as good and even better IMHO. Enjoy. I almost forgot the staff is fabulous especially Sophia ask for her when you arrive. Tell her Bob sent you. muito obrigado Sophia!"}
{"text":"This place suuuucks. It smells terrible in there. We were not seated at the obvious open table, the waitress made us wait for no reason and my wife is pregnant. It was very expensive and I felt sick afterwards. I heard the manager yelling at an employee, very unprofessional. I won't be back."}
{"text":"We were just visiting for Calgary Stampede. Found this place on Yelp with good reviews and reasonable price so decided to give it a shot. They got really delicious meats here, all tender and juicy. Many options for the hot and cold dishes. The atmosphere was lovely with live piano. Service was great as well. For the price we paid, it was absolutely a good pick."}
{"text":"We went to Mina's for my 30th birthday and it was so delicious! It's definitely the kind of place where you need to prep for days to ensure you can stuff yourself with as much food as possible."}
{"text":"Top Sirloin is everyone's favorite! Save your appetite for the good meats. If you're from a big city, it's probably not the best Brazilian BBQ experience, but it's decent for a small town. It really doesn't compare with SF or LA but it's quaint and affordable. They have a small array of sides, my favorite being the beef stew and caprese salad. I definitely advise against their dessert table, because it's left out long to dry, and I caught a fly sitting on their lemon bread..."}
{"text":"Great restaurant, cocktails, food, and service!  I went here for lunch to celebrate my birthday and had a fantastic experience.  There a total of 7 of us and every single one of us had an excellent time! Though a bit pricey if you get alcohol, all-you-can-eat meats, salad and hot bar, and some small baked desserts is a fantastic experience.  Everything we tasted was either outstanding or very good, and the kitchen was willing to make something a bit more special order due to some dietary restrictions from one of our party.  Overall, a great time and will be going back for special occasions."}
{"text":"The service can be slow here, but the meat is very tasty that's what she said. The server is hot as shit, friendly stuff the beer is free-flowing desserts are fresh and tasty"}
