{"text":"We were given the option of eating on the patio, or dining in.  We opted to dine in -- and were initially seated in the noisy bar area with all the TVs.  Though the hostess was happy to seat us in the quieter dining area instead of the bar area, I was surprised that we weren't offered the option.  The service was slow.  Our waitress was pleasant enough when she came to the table, but didn't come often.  Our food (spare ribs; wonton beef; and snow pea pods and chicken) was mediocre at best.  The coconut rice was good, but the chicken dish was dry, and not very tasty; the ribs were bland; and the beef was only so so.  We will not be going back.  $50.00 for three plates of bad food and one drink was too much to waste."}
{"text":"I live very close to AnSun, so I was hoping for a great new spot!  Unfortunately, after visiting with my bf and two friends who were in from out of town, I left disappointed.    I agree with many other reviewers.  My dish (kung pao chicken) was very tasteless and underwhelming.  Mine tasted nothing like what another reviewer talked about!  My bf was shocked that they could make a spicy dish...with no flavor.  Yes, they used nice pieces of white meat, but who cares when the dish is difficult to eat!    The menu needs to be reworked.  My friends visiting from CA kept saying that they thought the place needed to just focus on one type of cuisine, or at least integrate the foods a little better.  The menu goes from wings to American entrees to Chinese food.  I actually don't mind the variety...but it needs to be carried out better, and the design of the menu itself needs a huge upgrade.  I've never really taken much note of a menu's \"design\" before, but this one is just done so immaturely, I guess I would say, that it made the food items seem less appetizing!  While my kung pao chicken was pretty terrible, my bf and other friend really enjoyed their Southwest burgers! We also ordered potato skins.  They were really just four thin slices of potatoes loaded with potato skin fixings.  Tasted good, but I was very surprised/disappointed by how small they were! I was hoping that this place would be more than just another \"bar food\" place, but it doesn't seem like that is going to be the case.   Because of its close proximity to my house, I'm sure I will give AnSun another try in the future. However, I will definitely not be taking any more out-of-town guests with me!  P.S. They were also still out of nachos...weird."}
{"text":"Upon entering this place, it looks really nice. But, that's about it. The waiter was good, but the food wasn't anything special at all. My fiance and I ordered baked potato skins and buffalo chicken tenders. The baked potato skins were pretty bland (I never take it as a good sign when I have to heavily salt and pepper my food at a restaurant), and the chicken tenders seemed to be soaked in the buffalo sauce. It seemed more like a meal I'd pick up at a cheap-o chain restaurant. However, this place is waaay overpriced. Luckily we only spent about $15 (including a beer), but the other dishes I thought might be good were about $15. The menu is also very confusing. It's a nice idea, but this restaurant is putting on a facade and you're better off not going. Maybe for drinks. That's it."}
{"text":"I have only been here on Wednesdays but I am definately a fan. We always sit out on the patio (weather permitting). The reason I go on Wednesdays is because they have $3.50 top shelf you call its (yes you read that right) and $2.50 burgers and the burgers are great. I've had most the appetizers also and they didn't dissapoint."}
{"text":"I loved the inside of this place. It's really cool. I especially liked the couch and chairs in front of the plasma TV in the \"lounge\" area.   I ordered nachos but was told they didn't have any nachos. Darn! I was really looking forward to nachos. I asked our waiter if there was anything else on the menu that they didn't have so I would not order it. As it was a joke on my part he proceeded to tell me a few more items. Too funny. I ended up ordering quesadillas with chicken. They were not too bad but they weren't fantastic either. My husband had the Italian beef and he said it was really good.   My daughter ordered the kids mac and cheese and it was really bland and mushy. She doesn't like mushy food so she refused to eat it.   I had a mango margarita which was just OK. I can honestly say I would not order it again. I did however finish the drink so it wasn't horrible.   Bottom line is there was no wait to be seated on a Saturday night as opposed to some places on North Prospect. The atmosphere was fantastic and the food wasn't too bad. We will go back and try some other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Paul's review hit it on the nose: the menu has a personality disorder. I choose a restaurant based on what I'm in the mood for, and I don't think this menu hits on any one mood or taste. The TV commercials I saw for it suggested a slightly more sophisticated sports bar, so I thought I was going for a burger or steak and potatoes. I was so taken aback by the Chinese food section of the menu, I had to order from it.   I got the won ton beef. The beef was a little dry, getting most of its moisture from the sauce, but overall it tasted good. It was definitely different and unexpected.   I mean, it's not sweet and sour chicken Chinese food; it's definitely more authentic. Still, I say pick an identity. Let it be authentic Chinese. Maybe reinvent a few of the dishes in different ways for those Americans who can't handle authenticity. But be neighborhood bar food or Chinese. I don't think you can be both."}
{"text":"[In fairness, that's 3 stars on the same scale I would use in Chicago]  My wife and I ate at AnSun last weekend. To generally agree with other reviews, we liked the room a lot, especially the photographs on the walls. The furniture (tables and chairs) was a bit pedestrian. The service was still a little tentative, as might be expected in the first week of operation.  The food was good - the Chinese dishes maybe a bit sharper than I would prefer, but definitely good. The salads are very good, and you can add salmon to the spinach salad, which is a favorite way to avoid eating too much.  I'm not sure what the function of the long, very thin table in the bar areas is - it seems too narrow to have people on both sides even for drinks, but we're not bar people, so maybe it's obvious.  I wish they would work with a consultant on the physical appearance of the menu, which seems too random (boxes of various sizes, not arranged in any obvious relationship to each other).  We live around the corner and I'm sure we'll eat there often; I could see them getting another star better with practice."}
{"text":"My wife and I visited AnSun for the first time recently. The hostess offered us our choice of dining inside or out on their large patio. We elected to dine in this evening.  The restaurant interior is nice. However it could benefit greatly with some acoustical treatment. We found the sound level to be a tad higher than we preferred.  The service was OK. It wasn't bad and it wasn't great. I had the salmon that came with grilled asparagus and ginger rice. My wife had sweet and sour ribs with fried rice.  My salmon and asparagus were tasty. My wife's sweet and sour ribs were mostly sweet and not so much sour.  We both agreed our meals were good... certainly not bad but not great either.  Overall it was just good, not great."}
{"text":"Giving a new restaurant one star, as I did in my original review, is never fun. But I felt I should be honest. I got a very nice note from the chef apologizing for the bad experience and offering to pay for my next meal there if I'd give it another chance. I declined this kind offer but it did leave me thinking I should give it another go. Shortly after my review people associated with the restaurant started posting 5 star reviews in order to inflate their rating. You won't see those as Yelp has an automated system to filter those out. Then  another Yelp user posted and actually accused my boyfriend and I of being in cahoots with competing businesses and trying to bring AnSun down!  While my first instinct was to be annoyed with these sort of shenanigans, the fact of the matter is that opening a new restaurant is not easy. Keeping it open is even harder. I'm sure a lot of hard work and effort has gone into it and I'm sure it's frustrating to see such a negative review be the first one on a site like Yelp. The chef's response was the proper thing to do and appreciated. The rest of it... not so much. But the kind words in that first e-mail from the chef coupled with the sad sort of desperation of the other stuff led me to try AnSun out again.  I decided to go for lunch in order to get a price break. This didn't really work out all that well to be honest. They don't have a lunch menu persay. They do have some cheaper options on their main menu like wraps (around $8) but as I wasn't really in the mood for that I tried the Kung Pao Chicken. I will say, once again, the decor is very nice. There's still a faint scent of fresh paint that's slightly off-putting as you step inside but it is a new restaurant so there's not much they can do about that. My waiter was very friendly. He had a name tag that read only \"#138\" which, as a fan of TV show The Prisoner, I found a bid distressing. But maybe it's just a temporary tag until employees are well established and they decide it's time to make the an actual name tag. In any case, he was friendly and very on the ball with getting fresh drinks. The place was pretty dead for a lunch hour.  As far as the food, I was actually very, very happy. I want to be up front here - this place isn't cheap. It cost about $12  for my entree (served with your choice of rice, I got the coconut) but their portions are nicely sized. You won't be getting a second meal out of it but you will leave quite full. I honestly didn't mind paying more because their ingredients were very good.  Their chicken had a great taste and you weren't left wondering what part of the chicken you were eating as can be the case in some restaurants. It might have been all breast meat, actually. There were no \"filler\" vegetables either. Have you ever gotten a Chinese dish that had a ton of celery in it? Celery does not marry well with any Chinese dish in my opinion but it's cheap to throw a lot in to disguise the fact you aren't getting much meat. There was none of that here. There were bamboo shoot sections  but these were tasty and added a nice crunch. They also tasted very good and did not have the odd \"tang\" they can have when they come out of a can. The nicest part was that the Kung Pao Chicken had huge, hole chiles in it for the spice. What a great touch. I will say the dish wasn't quite as spicy as I might like but I'm sure you could request it spicier. There were a ton of chiles in it, but I think with those it's about how long they cook that determines the intensity of the heat and I'm guessing they were trying to make sure it wasn't too hot for many people's palettes. There were also a ton of peanuts which is always a plus. The dish leave a slightly oily feeling on my lips which was slightly unpleasant but it didn't feel \"greasy\" as I was eating it. I do wonder if the flavors were a bit more developed in the sauce if it wouldn't mask the raw oil taste better though. When you were eating the chicken itself you didn't notice this as much, however, because it was quite flavorful.  So while a lunch cost $17 with a fountain drink and tip I have to say I thought it was mostly worth it. I certainly wouldn't want them to sacrifice the quality of their ingredients to bring down their entree costs though.  So all in all. I would have given my lunch experience a \"4\" on its own. Coupled with my experience at dinner I am going with a\"3\" for now. Not sure I'm to the point where I can totally recommend it to friends, but  I would go back and try it again. I think with a little more work the restaurant definitely has the potential to go from \"Okay\" to \"Great.\""}
{"text":"This place is a mess. I'm not even sure where to start! A friend had asked me what I knew about AnSun, and speaking from memory I told him that it was something akin to Chinese gourmet. So, when we were seated this evening and given our menus, I was quite embarrassed to see that this place was more like gourmet BBQ with a Chinese portion sitting subtlety on the back page.   Before reading on, I want to clarify that this place does mix really good drinks, and their wine selection is so-so (the Pinot Noir is highly recommended), so if for no other reason this might be a good place to go to just for that. The service is pretty good, too, otherwise I would not be giving AnSun two stars!  Moving on...  Nothing on the regular menu piqued my interest, so I decided to try the Beef Wonton dish. My husband got the Szechuan Tofu. I loved that I had the option of trying coconut rice... until I put it in my mouth. It was so overcooked. My wontons tasted like stale tortillas, the beef can only be compared to bread that has been dipped in a tasteless gravy. Yet, the sauce that came with my dish was so salty, the flavorless beef remained as such as the alternative just wasn't worth it. I tried my husband's dish. It was just okay, and he concurs.  In fact, all members of our six-person party agree that it was \"okay\" but none of us will likely go back. Yet another example of a restaurant in Champaign-Urbana that thinks it can get by on its looks and mantra as being gourmet, but in actuality is just highly mediocre fluff."}
{"text":"We have been back several times since my earlier review. I still think they are great, but we really miss the dumplings.  On my most recent visit, I had the Crème Brûlée for desert. At first, I was surprised at how small the portion was, then again when I saw the price. But as I thought about it, I decided that the price was appropriate for the perfect Crème Brûlée, which unfortunately left me wanting more of the silky crusty caramely perfection.  It's possible that my wife and I just eat at weird times, but on our last visit the parking lot was so empty we weren't sure they were open. I hope they are busy and doing well. I will be sad if they close."}
{"text":"I've been looking forward to this place since I found so many stellar reviews on yelp a few days ago. Went there today and I was a bit disappointed.  For the price point, they could have afforded to put a bit more flavor into the food. I had the BBQ Pork Eggrolls and Sichuan Tofu, my buddy had the Beef with Vegetables. The eggrolls were really good. They were basically eggrolls filled with bbq pulled pork served with a side of really good bbq sauce. No complaints on the appetizer except that three short eggrolls cut on the diagonal to embellish their size cost me about 9 bucks.   The Sichuan Tofu, which I'm just assuming is the same dish that Ronald H. had (it was the only tofu dish available on the Chinese menu) was supremely disappointing. I've had a lot of Ma Po Tofu in my life and I'm accustomed to having a somewhat soupy mix of soft tofu in black bean sauce with bits of ground beef and vegetables. AnSun's version was more of stir fry of firm tofu in a spicy Sichuan style sauce with hamburger consistency ground beef.   Taking up about half of the real estate on the plate along with the tofu was my fried rice. The fried rice was decent, not much to expect when the rice is meant to be an accompaniment as opposed to a dish in its own right. It was lightly fried in oil and soy with a bit of chopped green onion but it seemed to be seasoned unevenly, with blotches of heavily and lightly coated rice instead of an even soy-colored sheen over the rice as I believe it should be.   aving said all this, it wasn't bad at all. The tofu was flavored very well and had a bit of heat behind it, also the fried rice with its apparently sloppy preparation was actually very good and was much lighter than fried rice I've had in a while, not as thick and greasy as other places tend to make it.   My friend's Beef with Vegetables was another story. The meat was chewy and overcooked, and the overall dish was underseasoned. Again, not much to expect from a dish simply called \"Beef with Vegetables\" but it's not too much to ask for decent seasoning on a 15 dollar plate, especially around Champaign.  Aside from the food, the restaurant itself had a really nice atmosphere. It's probably one of the nicest and classiest looking places in Champaign that I've gone to eat. It's not very formal though, it has more of a chic sports bar feeling to it with big flat panel LCD's showing sports and whatnot.  Overall my friend and I spent a little over 40 bucks including tax and tip, but for the same price I'd be more comfortable getting really flavorful, albeit high sodium and greasy, chinese food from some place like evo or golden wok. If you're the kind of person that values or enjoys a nice clean atmosphere in a restaurant, Ansun is definitely a place to try at least once. Don't miss the BBQ Pork Egg Rolls."}
