{"text":"The place isn't horrible, but is lacking in atmosphere and consistent food quality.  Different cooks use different recipes for certain items, so what you get depends on the day of the week.  Not a good thing.  

The food isn't cheap like your usual bar food.  It's  more restaurant prices.  The waitresses are personable, but I wouldn't call them stellar.  Pretty average for a bar.  I'm unable to drink beer, so I can't attest to their beer prices, but liquor's pretty average from what I've seen.  Maybe a teensy bit on the expensive side.  

Every time I go there, my hatred for Phil Lara is renewed.
(Phil Lara is the man that drove the Jigsaw into the ground and all but destroyed several beloved Cleveland concert clubs.)

If they could manage to have consistent food, I would give them one more star.

Additionally, they *do* have the patio open in the summer and it's much nicer than being inside the boring building.

Another gripe--  they have ONE bathroom per sex.  Who opens a bar, where people are drinking their livers away and thus using the restroom more often than would occur at a regular restaurant,  and then only provides a single bathroom for each gender?  Poor judgment call IMO.  I really don't enjoy having to wait 10+ minutes to pee because some chick is on the phone screaming at her boyfriend in the locked bathroom.

All in all, there is much room for improvement at Hive, but it's not terrible.  The food's a bit hit-or-miss, but a decent amount of it is tasty.  The menu has been revamped and is a HUGE improvement over the original one they had when the establishment first opened."}
{"text":"Service was good could have been a little better but seeing as it is a new restaurant I'll let being slightly short staffed slide. I had 2 appetizers spinach artichoke dip which was delicious and chicken tenders....not so much they were very dry and the breading tasted strange. The bar tender however was very good simply from the request of fruity and delicious she was able to make quite a few mixed drinks that were both fruity and delicious."}
{"text":"Great Angus burgers , not the typical Parma bar food. Great menu with a friendly staff for sure a definite return to try the rest of the menu. Thursday steak night dinner for 4.99 sounds like a deal can't wait to try it"}
{"text":"Recently visited Hive in Parma. It is located where the good old Jigsaw Saloon once greeted thirsty locals. Jigsaw patrons be forewarned - the place has been transformed to a comfortable, clean and new restaurant setting. Though the bar, patio and music club next door (in old Tuxedo Lanes) remain, the restaurant area is a total upgrade. Gone are the memorabilia, crowded tables, odd items and general dark grunge of the old place. I personally feel a bit sad sitting there remembering my old haunt with bright new paint and open floor plan. 

But life is full of changes, no? We went seeking food. The menu is what I'd call \"expensive bar food\" meaning $8 burgers with sweet potato fries for an extra $1. They have a small selection of ethic dinners - pork chops and chicken paprikash for example. 

We tried what they called an Onion Loaf for an appetizer which turned out to be a long pile of thin straw onion rings, not a \"loaf\" like Tony Roma's used to serve. They tasted like oil and breading, not onions. 

We ordered the Hive Burger (pulled pork and slaw on a huge burger) and the paprikash. We had wanted the Hive sandwich (brisket!) but they were out of it. The burger was delicious and huge and others reported their burgers of various styles were tasty as well, save one who found theirs a bit plain. The paprikash was quite excellent. Spaetzles were small, the chicken tender and the silky smooth paprika sauce well flavored but not overpowering. I've tried many restaurant versions of paprikash - this might be the best around Parma. 

My major complaint was the tiny draft beer selection. I've gotten used to a normal selection of domestics/imports and at least a few microbrews, falling back on a Dortmunder Gold when needed. With the Great Lakes tap empty (they had Lake Erie Monster apparently earlier, but no regular Dortmunder tap?!) it really only left only a few choices of summer \"flavored\" brews that I prefer by the pool not with food. 

Staff were prompt, friendly and kind, and the new restrooms easily helped me forget those nasty old Jigsaw stinkholes. Still I miss my pierogies and perch among the clutter and crowds. We will certainly visit again, maybe to sit outside on the patio..."}
