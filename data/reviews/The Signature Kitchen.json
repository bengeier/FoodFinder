{"text":"One of my favourite local sushi restaurants.  authentic cuisine, friendly service, quiet ambience and high quality food. Sushi is very fresh and bento boxes are very good as well.   Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This is the best sushi I've had in years.  Kids loved it too.  Try the pineapple sorbet great way to finish."}
{"text":"Hubby and I love this place!  We go once every week.  You have to try the bibimbap roll, the spicy tuna roll, the torched rainbow roll, the crispy shrimp roll and the lobster tempura roll!  So delicious and we've gone to a lot of sushi restaurants in Toronto.  The bonus is is that it is in our hood :).  Service is always great too."}
{"text":"Went there on a Sunday night, not expecting much.  However, was pleasantly surprised by the food.  Would not say that it was the most authentic Japanese/Korean establishment, but I could see it being good for people with a less adventurous palate.

We ordered the Sashimi dinner, Roll Combo, and Chicken Katsu.  Sashimi was decent but thinly sliced, while the roll combo was standard (deep fried shrimp etc).  The chicken katsu was actually very good.  A generous portion, nice and crispy and served on a bed of coleslaw.  If I went back I think I would order the Chicken Katsu again and veer away from the sushi."}
{"text":"We ordered the spicy pork dinner, a caterpillar roll and California roll for two adults and a child. Very pleased with the food. Sushi was fresh and beautifully served. The spicy pork was delicious. Service was great. Finally we have a good Korean restaurant on the East end!"}
{"text":"I went in to try at lunch time and although the place was new and clean and the server was friendly, the food was mediocre.  I'd rather go a bit further to get better sushi.   I'm so disappointed because I've been looking forward to decent sushi place at this section of Danforth.

They had $11 and $13 lunch specials but nothing was that appealing to me (mostly cooked things and California or shrimp rolls) so I thought I would try my favourite sushi item, Spicy Salmon Roll, to see how it stacked up.   I had my toddler with me so I ordered an avocado and yam tempura roll for us to share.

The salmon was that mushy chopped up kind as opposed to some nice pieces that you can bite into.  The texture was not for me and did not satisfy my desire for biting into a piece of salmon!  The avocado in the other roll was on the unripe side and not as creamy and sweet as you'd like it be.  The yam tempura in the roll was fine and was topped with a few slices of yam tempura.

The three rolls plus a pop, tax and tip was $24 which I thought was a lot for 1.5 people!  Because I didn't get the lunch special I didn't any salad or soup, which was fine, but just thought was worth mentioning.

Many of their sushi items had cooked items (crab, shrimp) and cream cheese (yuck!). I asked about their bibimbap and it does not come in a stone bowl, so I don't think I'll bother going back to try that."}
{"text":"So happy we found this place! Had Paul's roll combo. It was beautiful and just the right balance of crisp, sweet, spicy. Their sashimi was also really fresh and artfully presented. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh sushi. Extremely friendly staff. Love the pan fried spicy tuna roll!"}
{"text":"Just got home from The Signature Kitchen, I loved it!
Please go, give it a shot.. don't want this one to disappear.
Had: Bibimbap Roll.. totally awesome. Dynamite Roll.. really good. Spicy Salmon Roll... it's the chopped up fish kind, which frankly I prefer, so yeah really enjoyed it too.
Service was amazing. Super impressed."}
{"text":"we went friday night, i hope they make it. they didn't have 4 of the 8 sushimis on menu. and when the sushi dinner came all the fish was lukewarm. It wasn't good, much like a mall meal $19.99 for this,  $10 for a saporro, husband had korean beef, not good either. bill was $60. We were asked how the food was and did tell them our concern (it is early days). They did nothing or said nothing to rectify. nice reno though"}
{"text":"Spicy bulgolgi highly recommended. Great sushi too. Family friendly. Staff are always friendly and prompt. Awesome place!"}
{"text":"Went in with high hopes, but ultimately not super satisfying. The kimchi was the best part. The sushi had extremely dry rice on small rolls. I will say the ginger was tasty and fresh. The fish was fine, not great, not bad. Nearly all the rolls on the menu had crab sticks and tempura in them. I suppose this is due to it really being a korean place that make sushi. If this is appealing to you then by all means enjoy!

The staff was very friendly and helpful. (hence 2 stars, otherwise it's a 1)

The decor was dated and music playing was not so good. I don't ever want to hear country music playing when I go in for sushi. It's fine in a bar, but not appropriate for a sushi joint.

Hope this helps other travelers looking for sushi in the beaches area. I'd look elsewhere."}
{"text":"The best sushi on the danforth. We go once a week or more. And if you love Korean, their bibimbap is truly stunning! Served in a true sizzling bowl."}
{"text":"we went there on a Friday night. a very cold night. So i would rather think cold was the reason for being half empty. Then the menu came and we said Ok! that is why. The price for the clean but average place is a bit high. The reason I am giving it 4 star is 1- because the food was good although a bit expensive 2- They are in my hood and I really want a sushi place in walking distance so they better make it. we had basics like shrimp tempura, shushi , sashimi and maki. They were all fresh and in good size and shape. I believe they should adjust the price and people will come in for their few times a week sushi fixture."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place but I wasn't terribly satisfied. I'd been walking by for weeks and never managed to go in. I love both sushi and Korean food so was excited to see this restaurant in the neighbourhood. Walking in I noticed the place seemed very clean and all of the staff greeted me. I was seated and looked at the menu. The prices were about a dollar higher on rolls and nigiri than other places and the combos were several dollars higher. I settled on a sushi dinner for $18 (12 pieces of sushi, 4 pieces of california roll, soup, and salad). The miso soup came first. Blandest miso I've had in Toronto. There was no tofu (my fave) but it did have a few enoki mushrooms (my other fave). The salad came five minutes later which I found odd as everywhere else serves them together. Standard water-logged salad from a bag. When the main came I was a bit disappointed in the selection. Three pieces of salmon, three pieces of tilapia or snapper, two shrimp, two tuna... I was kind of hoping for something exciting... ika? tako? unagi? saba? When I found out it was just the very basic selection I could get from the mall I was really let down with the price point. I was also slightly annoyed they give four pieces of california roll. A standard roll is six. Are you feeding the other two pieces to the dogs or what? Speaking of the roll, every piece fell apart when I picked it up with the chopsticks. Extremely poorly rolled. The other common theme throughout the meal was bland rice. I think they missed the memo about vinegar and sugar. Worst sushi rice in memory. 

Two stars because it's clean, the washroom was ok, and the staff were friendly. I don't see myself going back."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious sushi for reasonable prices! The owners are amazing as well. Everyone must try their spicy salmon rolls, they're the best in the city and to die for."}
{"text":"great little restaurant serving japanese and korean food. i love that combination. all the rolls are delicious and the korean food is great. 

the restaurant is nice and quiet. service is great and chefs are very polite and happy to welcome all visitors.

it's a nice neighbourhood restaurant and will be going back again."}
{"text":"Craving Korean food and being on the Danforth, this place was number 1 when I searched on Google. Walking in, the place is very modernly designed and has really cool techno, EDM and deep house music playing the background. It was fairly packed as it was a weekend evening. 

The service here is amazing and as good as it gets. They are super friendly, accommodating and they constantly fill your tea up and ask how the meal is. I ordered the Dolsot Bibimbap which was top notch. It was evenly spread with rice and veggies. We had the Spicy Scallop Roll to start and it is definitely one of the best I've had. 

This place is definitely worth trying out! 5 stars :)"}
