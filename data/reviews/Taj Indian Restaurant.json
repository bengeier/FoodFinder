{"text":"Not bad food, but did take out andwhen phoning to complain about the half dozen small cubes of butter chicken swimming in sauce, the young punk on the phone was not accommodating and plain rude.  Never going back"}
{"text":"Good buffet, good service, good prices, and the food is 4/5 stars. My favorite can't miss meal is the butter chicken and naan...5 stars!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious food! We went with our kids, and they loved it as well.  The staff was very nice & accommodating.  Nice ambience and very clean.  A little pricey but totally worth it."}
{"text":"Admittedly, I've never had the lunch buffet; as for the dinner menu, though? Delicious! The Boy and I eat there at least once a week, often twice. We go through withdrawals if we're away too long!  Since we're both veg*n, I can only attest to the Vegetarian offerings, but between the two of us, I think we've had everything in the Veg section, and we've never had a bad meal here. Every plate has the option of mild/medium/spicy, and extra rice is always available free (even when you take half of the food home, as I usually have to do). The portions are perfect in that, if you're like him, it's a perfect stomach-stuffer -  and if you're like me, I always have leftovers for the next day!   Particularly good dishes are the Baingan Bhartha, Vegetable Mango, and Bhindi Masala (The cheese-eating Boy swears by the Saag Mushroom and Paneer Jalfrazie). The Samosas are wonderful, and the onion chutney is always amazing. Be sure to add a Taj Mahal beer for the perfect meal. :)  The prices are great (two meals, an appetizer, and a couple of drinks comes to less than $30 before tipping). The service is always prompt and friendly, and while the atmosphere is casual (we often venture in in hoodies and jeans), you could easily make it a nice date outing (the lighting is soft and the decor nice enough). Taj is an all-around great establishment with a great family-owned feel that's friendly without being overbearing."}
{"text":"I wrote a 4 star review of Taj after having been several times. But after going a couple more times, I really had to come back and change this to a 5 star review.  I can't even believe how LOW the prices are (compared to other Indian restaurants I have been to in Madison) and how great the food is.   I have never been to Taj's buffet, nor have I ordered any dishes with meat in them so I cannot attest to any of that stuff. But speaking for the vegan food on the dinner menu, I love Taj and never go to any other Indian restaurants in town anymore. I once went with a friend to Maharini (at the corner of Broom and West Wash) and we were so unhappy we went to Taj afterward to get some pakora!  The pakora (an appetizer technically, but usually makes up the bulk of what my friends and I order) is just the best thing in the world. The samosas are great (and both those items are so cheap) and the entrees I have ordered (usually spinach, eggplant and mushroom in various combinations) were great but not all that large of portions.  1 thing that would make this place even more amazing is if they had vegan naan, which I can never find anywhere!"}
{"text":"Pretty quiet Indian House, I think most don't know it is here as it is tucked into a corner of a small mall, on the outskirts of Airdrie.  Food was good, but pretty pricey - my wife and I have done takeout that cost over $60 for a reasonable meal.  The lunch buffet is good, but again $20 for lunch is expensive for Airdrie.  I would recommend as the food is solid, just watch your step as you order, or you might be surprised by the bill at the end!"}
{"text":"Very tasty and good prices on the buffet.  The only tiny drawback is the mazelike path to the restroom, but I didn't come for the potty, I came for the samosa!  Bring it on!"}
{"text":"I go here when I don't go to the Square for the other Indian places. Always my favorites are the chicken tikka masala and carrot halwa. The mango ice cream is always good. The chutneys are varied but mango chutney is extra. The naan could be better. The only other negative is the restroom. Its unpleasant."}
{"text":"Wow, revised for delivery... Okay portions are smaller and not great.  First our bhaji were under cooked, soggy and nasty not how they used to be.  Second my tandoori chicken was soooo dry it was un edible.  Thirdly our samosas were expired, I mean sour meat the lot.   After calling to notify the owner he tasted his meat called back and apologised.  We threw the whole meal out $70.00 worth.  Within 30 mins (10pm) the owner came knocking at the door, with a refund we would of thought if anything!  NO! He asked for the sour samosa I explained it's all thrown in a garbage bag, he demanded to see it! He dug through the bag and found the samosa and TASTED the meat!!!!!!  He apologised and told us next time it's free!  Forget it we will not be back. You ate out of the garbage and your food was the worst we have eaten from there! Will not be back!"}
{"text":"If you are an Indian, stay away from this restaurant. Hope we don't get sick. Anyone that says this is best, hasn't eaten real/authentic (I am not saying 'good') Indian food. The americanized version is not good either.   I should have read other reviews from Indians. :("}
{"text":"I like trying new restaurants and bought Groupon and decided to visit. Food was not at all good and at the end host behaved very rudely and was just trying to make up reasons to not accept Groupon. After lot of arguing she charged me extra $2.20 and rounded total up to 40. I really did not had energy to argue anymore and paid and got out of there. I wish I could give them 0 stars. I have attached the receipt that she gave me."}
{"text":"BEST INDIAN FOOD IN MADISON. I seriously went to almost every one in town. Best rice and best sauces and highest quality meat I have found yet. A+++ Taj! Thank You! :D"}
{"text":"Damn good Indian food, beating all the places I have tried in Chicago.  That may not be all of them, but I am working on it.  Anyways the highlight is the peshwari naan which is unique to this place as far as I can tell.  It has a raisin paste in the middle and has sesame seeds on top.  Puts all other naan to shame.  I see a lot of people complaining about lack of spice and I can see the complaint, but spicy is not a quintessential characteristic of Indian cuisine.  Some places serve creamy curries and others are like the Indian equivalent of Szechuan food.  What I am trying to say is that this place is not inauthentic because of a lack of spice.  Anyway of the many curry dishes here I think the Mughali is the best.  Sadly, they make a weak rendition of Bhindi Masala or I would probably give it five stars."}
{"text":"Visited Taj with group of friends yesterday. Seems like there is a change of ownership there. Much better service n good food. Would recommend to anyone for great Indian food at decent price in Airdrie."}
{"text":"Like the delicious vindaloo, slow start but incredible finish. Friendly service & fantastic food. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Taj is consistently fabulous. We always get the Chicken Saag, Baingan Bharta, and lots of naan. The naan is flaky (not like a flat pancake as we've had at other Indian restaurants), there's plenty of chicken in the saag, and the Baingan Bharta is full of vegetables and flavor. Very good quality and nice portions (especially with take-out!). Even though it takes us 25 minutes to get to Taj, this is our new Indian restaurant of choice."}
{"text":"This place can be a hit or miss. I like my curries \"super hot \" & usually have the vindaloo. Last time I changed it up & went for the \"kadai \" - super hot & it was on a Wednesday night - fantastic.  Ordered the same dish 2 weeks later on a Saturday night & I could have gave it to the kids it was that mild.  + the chicken breast looked more like thigh meat. Portion is small and not proportional to the price tag.  So it's just your \"Donald duck \" what chef  is serving on the night.   On the whole , dishes are good just a little small & pricey."}
{"text":"Was looking for a place to eat when going through Airdrie and found this little place. Really great food & I was pretty impressed with the service. Looks to be a local family business. Clean with nice atmosphere. I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"I always get the chicken tikka masala and it's always delicious.  The staff is pleasant and I haven't had a bad experience.  The price is a bit steep, but it's worth it for the occasional dinner splurge."}
{"text":"I'm reviewing this place since it's the best Indian restaurant in Madison, but my review applies to all the other ones in the city:  If you crave real Indian food, I would highly recommend you stay away from this place. The food in their buffet is very watered down to cater to American tastes since there's practically no spiciness or flavor to anything in their buffet. Heck, even the watered down Indian food places in San Francisco are more spicy (and better) than this place.   However, like any other Indian restaurant in Madison, this place has cheap/reasonably priced buffet lunch specials which makes it worth a visit if you happen to be starving and in the area, but if you have any real expectations about Indian food in the region, you're better off trying your luck in Milwaukee or Chicago instead."}
{"text":"Food is good, however customer service is not great.  Request for toning down the heat on the dinners fell on deaf ears. Once discovered there was no offer to remake the dinner or take it off the bill or a discount.  Pop is not refillable, and not disclosed on menu, for a place where a drink may be needed to help soothe spice it seems a no brainer."}
{"text":"I went here with two friends on a not-so-busy Saturday night for dinner. While the food was delicious (I had paneer cheese in tomato-butter sauce and LOVED it), the portion sizes were really good (I was able to finish it all but did not want any more), and the waitstaff was pleasant, service was slow even though there were not very many people there, and I can't help but feel slightly awkward when they keep coming back every couple of minutes to fill your glass of water (but that kind of happens a lot at Indian restaurants). It was pleasant enough, but for the combination of the atmosphere, how much it cost, and how long it took, I don't think I will be back any time soon, at least for dinner. I may try it again for lunch sometime if I'm anywhere near home in the middle of the day."}
{"text":"Best indian restaurant in the area with an amazing Fish Amritsari. I've been eating here for two days now & the food has been great. I've had the Chicken biriyani as well as the Thali the next day.They were both great & generous portions. The biggest surprise of them all was the Gulab Jamun....sooo good....reminded me of the ones we get in India."}
{"text":"The place is quite nice in appearance and seemed very clean.  The food was hot and the buffet was kept stocked nicely.  The food wasn't bad but wasn't that good either.  When I think of Indian food, I want a depth of flavor, some intensity.  The food here was none of that.  It was even somewhat bland.  The chicken masala had nice chunks of white breast meat, but there was hardly any spice in it.  Seemed like Midwestern chicken gravy.  And the beef curry was just as flavorless.  The nana bread was good as was the rice Brian's.  but that was about it."}
{"text":"Based solely on the lunch buffet, I'd rate this a 3 1/2 star establishment.  We came here for lunch to what I remember was a $7.95 buffet, but now I see they've raised their prices to $8.95, yet kept the offerings the same.  They have a cold buffet table, two hot buffet trey tables, and a dessert table. The salads are passable, the samosa and vegetable pakoras appetizers tasted dry/old, but the curries they offer are well done. We especially enjoyed the Saag Paneer (spinach cooked with tender cubes of homemade Indian cheese), Chicken Tikka Masala, and mixed vegetable curry.   We loaded up on the naan, which wins me over each time. I really appreciate the self-serve, Mango Ice Cream for dessert. The soft fried cheese ball, Gulab Jamun is a close second favorite.  The buffet tends to lean heavily on vegetables and chicken, so one might not deem it worthwhile for the price tag, but we were happily stuffed after our visit.  Tip: They offer a punch card where your 10th visit is comped. Make sure to ask for on at check-out!"}
{"text":"Great food. Friendly service. Great to find a good quality, family run Authentic Indian restaurant in airdrie. They have an excellent take out menu, and a fairly large dining room.   Quality of the food is excellent and is cooked properly. They are sensitive to the western pallet and will make any dish milder if you ask.   GF and I shared two curries, some dal, and garlic naan. Was an excellent, filling and satisfying meal.   If you are anywhere near Airdrie and like Indian food, I urge you to try out Taj Indian restaurant."}
{"text":"Best Indian restaurant in Airdrie!! Prices are reasonable and the food tastes great. The fish amritsari and chicken biryani are a must."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery when I was in town and got the vegetarian combo dinner. The delivery was fast and everything was delicious! I will definitely order from here again next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Found this place and wanted to try it out. It was my first Indian Restaurant to try here in Madison. Was taken here on my birthday with some friends and the service was just awful. We waited forever for someone to even really acknowledge us and get our orders. They didn't really come back to ask if we were needing anything and we had to go hunt them down to get our checks. Pricing was a little steep for the service and the food. Okay experience, nothing too exciting."}
{"text":"What are people giving good ratings talking about? For starters, the bathroom was disgusting: flies everywhere.  There are some in the main restaurant, too. They left the tikka massala unfilled until several people finally asked for it.  The Naan was obviously just heated up in a microwave. It was also pretty cold.  Yuck!"}
{"text":"First to arrive for the lunch buffet, so the food din't sit for long. Literally had one of everything (I shouldn't be allowed at buffets), so I got a good sense of what they had to offer.   the good - pakora: the vegetable (cauliflower) was better than the fish or chicken, crispy & well-seasoned - saag paneer: creamy, thick & rich, but not excessively so - kofta: nice soft texture, good flavor, well sauced - gulab jamun: not offensively sweet, good texture - kheer: same as above  the just okay - samosas, garlic naan, basmati rice were fine but unremarkable - watery dishes: chicken curry, chicken tikka masala, dal, raita (would have been much better if the sauce had the consistency of the saag paneer)  the wtf? - beef at an indian restaurant?!  - no lamb - no spice/heat - bathrooms are kinda retro but not scary  I recently just got back from a trip to India (Jaipur, Rajasthan) and the dishes listed under 'good' above were comparable. At less than $10, it was a great deal and will be back."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the food and the experience.  Super nice staff, easy to get in and out of the parking lot.  Reasonable prices.  Super yum, yum, yummy!"}
{"text":"I got Taj delivered to my apartment last night as I didn't feel like venturing out to a restaurant. It was super fast and arrived piping hot, I was very impressed!  I got the Matter Paneer and it was the best I have ever had. Super flavorful. The rice is also delicious as was the naan. I got an order of plain naan this time but would try a new flavor next time.   One thing I would note for next time is that the dinner options come with a side of rice. I didn't realize this as most places I have been to everything comes a la carte. So I ordered an extra order of rice but like I said it is delicious so I'm not complaining!"}
{"text":"Have eaten there a few times and it's great.   Absolutely awesome customer service.   Have been there with a group of 6 each time and everyone has loved it."}
{"text":"I have eaten here about 10 times and gotten take-out maybe another 7-10.  GREAT Indian food, excellent service, and a nice setting.  You know those places that have stuff hanging off the ceiling but it is greasy and has cobwebs?  Well this isn't it...Taj os bright and cheerful and c-l-e-a-n.  The vegetarian and \"meatatarian\" specials are both good (ask to upgrade the basic naan for a small upcharge to garlic or ginger).  The Indian wine, which I had never had before going here, was impressive.  Lighter fruits and various floral flavors blend beautifully and pair nicely with the dishes, and the wine is very reasonably priced.  Oh, and the only tandoori I have ever had that is moist - too many are dired out. Overall a wonderful value, and nice enough you could make it a special event dinner."}
{"text":"The food is solid enough. If you're unfamiliar with Indian food this place is a good entry level place. It has two main issues though...  First, the table are all glass covered. That's not bad in and of itself but the staff makes of point of cleaning the tables with Windex while diners are present, leaving window-cleaner stench hanging in the air to ruin the taste of the food.  Second, if you are planning on eating here for the love of god, BRING CASH! The last time I ate here I paid for it with my debit card, only to have the restaurant withdraw the funds over a week later! Seriously?"}
{"text":"Awful... simply awful.  I love Indian food, and while visiting Madison, I thought I hit the jackpot because I found some that delivered.  How sad was !!!!  Naan bread is one primary method to evaluate any legit place.  Theirs is tasteless.  I could have saved myself the money and got myself some wonder bread.  Tasteless also sums up the rice.  Anyone who goes Indian knows that the rice is very distinctive.  Sadly, this was also not to be.  Another money saving tip would have been to buy some instant Uncle Bens.  The rest of the food followed along similar lines.  My recommendation is to do without at your hotel room."}
{"text":"Yum!!! I have never really had Indian food before and me and my man went for the lunch buffet.  It is an $8 buffet and while it is not huge, what it had was diverse (at least for me).  I was up for trying anything, which I did and it was all good!  I loved the samosas and I dipped them in a yogurt sauce that they had available.  I tried vegetable korma which was tasty with just enough heat, and saag paneer, which was different but still good.  My favorite was probably the vegetable pakora... and of course, the naan!!!  I also tried the desserts, which weren't my cup of tea but interesting.  They have a gelatinous dessert called gulab jamun and I found out that it is soft fried cheese balls!!! i didn't love them, but I did love this place!"}
{"text":"Ordered takeout on a weekday. I tried the chicken tikka masala & ginger naan. The chicken masala was awesome, I thought the naan had too strong of a garlic taste (& I like garlic). I asked if chutneys were included with the naan & they said no, but told me they'd add some to my order! I enjoyed the food, service was fast, prices were reasonable, & portion sizes were large. I'd definitely order from here again. Check it out!"}
{"text":"I am purely rating the food quality as I have only ordered out and not dined in.  The food is very tasty, sometimes more spicy than other times but never overboard spicy. Never had any issues with them. Used an app for delivery. A little pricey but good portions"}
{"text":"Not too keen on Taj Indian, based on one visit. Two words: scary bathrooms (you have to walk down a long hallway at the back of the building to get there - it's right out of a David Lynch movie!). Two more words: slow service. We had to practically beg a server to wait on us, and there wasn't a big crowd to justify the wait. The food was good, but I would much rather go to one of the Indian restaurants on State Street before going here again."}
{"text":"Firstly, I should say -- this place does have delivery. In fact, more and more restaurants are offering a 3rd party delivery service called StraightToYourDoor.com . They are one such place at the moment. I have gone here a few times, dinner and lunch. The dinner experience I found slightly slow, even though nobody is there. Maybe its based on the way they prepare food or something but it feels like you wait forever. Even with an appetizer, I still waited a while after finishing it for my main course. Lunch is where it is at. For $7.95, they have a lunch buffet that includes naan. If you wanted to be el-cheapo, if you forgo a drink, that is under $10. I believe with a drink, it goes slightly over. But still, that is cheap for a lunch. It's a great way to introduce others to Indian food or give yourself an opportunity to explore other things you might not otherwise order for dinner. I find the wait staff very friendly and you can tell they take pride in their restaurant."}
{"text":"Great Indian food! Service was great, Butter Chicken was amazing, Naan was so good, the hot Beef Vindaloo was probably the best we've ever eaten. Go eat there!"}
{"text":"Went to the Taj a couple weeks back and I left unsatisfied. I typically eat until I can't eat anymore at other nearby buffets but I didn't even want to keep eating. The food selection was small. The dishes offered were mediocre. And the thing that worries me the most is that the food wasn't warm enough which isn't good for any restaurant especially those that have food sitting out for long periods of time."}
{"text":"I went here because of good reviews, but the food is recycled, it was bearly warm, so I would say it was the buffet leftovers. Because of that I would have expected athe portions to be more generous at least to justify the 12.00 a plate and 2.50 for naan, I tell you they are very stingy even w white rice. Thats probably why only three tables were filled on a Friday night, I thought these people were buisness smart, DONT THEY KNOW AMERICANS LOVE BIG PORTIONS, they eat big portions, but I guess some people are stingy and their wallet is more important."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite Indian food in Madison. Can't go wrong with the naan or tikka masala. They offer delivery,  which comes with slightly larger portions than dine-in."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery, and it ended up taking 2+hours and a phone call to get delivered. While the food was good, I'm not sure it was worth the entire wait."}
{"text":"The service is always fast and friendly. The Chicken Tikka Masala is my favorite dish, but is not the only good option."}
{"text":"It's hard to find good food in airdrie and this place does the trick. Authentic dishes done right!"}
{"text":"Very good food. I had a large take out order which included Fish Amritsari. This appetizer was really good. Entrees were  the usual naan, beef korma, lamb Tikka masala, butter chicken and beef curry. Some dishes we ordered hot while others medium spicy. All dishes were really good. I have had better Naan but all the other dishes were on par with the best I have ever had. Worth a try."}
{"text":"This is my first post on Yelp... my strange experience here compelled me to make the effort to post this: Service: This was my most bizzare experience, though the lady did give proper food service et al... but what really shocked me was that they treat Indians (me) like unwanted guests, i.e. forget a well mannered welcome hi/hello... all i got was curt replies, a kind of disrespectful vibe,...point is even a stranger would have the decency and courtesy when they talk.. lets not forget we are their customers! And not that the server was treating all others the same way, I noted that some american customers were treated like proper guests... this is really shameful of the restaurant staff.  I would suggest going to Swagat, Maharaja, Haveli... but never again Taj..you will feel the difference"}
{"text":"Went there for brunch yesterday (Sat) ... two words, stay away!  Yes, the owners look friendly ... but if its good Indian food you're looking for, Taj is a big let down. The brunch menu was sparse, most dishes watered down (tasted nothing like they should), food didn't taste fresh & to make it worse - my glass of water had stuff floating in it."}
{"text":"Discovered this place on Grubhub as a freshman a few years back. As most Indian joints go, this place is SUPER vegetarian friendly. It's on the cheaper end, too, especially if you go with the Chef's Special. I haven't gone to a place with better Malai Kofta."}
{"text":"Yummy yummy yummy! So many good choices, and the owners and workers are soooooo nice! Make this a place you go!"}
{"text":"I've been to Taj 3-4 times and have been consistently pleased.  I've never had slow service, it's always been very prompt and incredibly pleasant.  They bring you a neat little trifecta of sauces to use on your crispy bread starter.  I'm actually not 100% sure I've ever gotten anything other than their saag paneer (I dream about their saag paneer on my lonelier nights), but maybe someday.  ;)"}
{"text":"Very expensive food. Amount you get isnt alot.  Wait time to get your food much above average.  Food is good though."}
{"text":"Wow!  This place is a great pick for that night time date, family get together or just some place great last minute.  The buffet of course is the best but the evening menu is delicious.  I had a spicy lamb dish and my daughter had an amazing crab crepe!  Over the top good.  Lovely and elegant place but modestly priced.  No other place to go for lunch or dinner!  A Must!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Close to my work, tasty, and often containing a surprise. The last time I went, Taj was serving delicious goat curry! I took a colleague who was a bit uncomfortable trying Indian cuisine, and she liked that the food wasn't too spicy. Also, the price for a work lunch is fantastic! I haven't been for supper, but for lunch, it's a nice pleasure to break up the day."}
{"text":"In Madison for a couple of days (nice people around here by the way). Swung by Taj for lunch. Place was nearly empty but I was already here. Went with vegetable biryani. The vegetables were way over cooked and included some not listed in the description while adding some for the heck of it. Definitely had the impression they just threw some leftovers together and fed it to the guy in the suit (me) figuring I wouldn't know the difference. To make up for the crappy vegetables, they over-seasoned the heck out of the poor dish.   Disappointed.  Maybe they weren't expecting someone to order off the menu given they had a buffet."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE!  I would give ten stars if I could and signed up for a yelp account just so I could share my awesome find with others.  Hands down some of the best Indian food I've ever had . . . and I lived in India.  Great, friendly and fast service in a cozy atmosphere.  I've been for dine in dinner and take out and have never been disappointed.  Their prices are incredibly reasonable - I highly recommend the combination dinners - they have a vegetarian or meat combo that includes three curry-type dishes, nan, rice, pakora appetizer and dessert for under $14!  The chicken tikka masala is incredible - like everything else.  They give you generous portions (enough for at least another whole meal at home, YUM).  The only draw back is that the are a little off the beaten path on S. Park but well worth the extra five or ten minutes out of your way."}
{"text":"I'm amazed at some of the restaurants that opened up in Airdrie in the last few years as the city continues to grow along with good food. Taj Indian is one that I'd go back to when I'm up there.  Came here for lunch and had a Thali 2 (Beef) which comes with garlic naan, lentils, saffron rice, pakora, rice pudding, and a little bit of vegetables. I thought the price was a little high for lunch ($14) but once the food came out, I knew I wouldn't be able to finish it. There was a lot of food!  The garlic naan was one of the best I've had as it was very garlicky. Not too chewy either. The beef was tender, sweet, and spicy, although I would've preferred a little bit more spice. I thought they were generous with the beef compared to other Indian restaurants I've been to. The pakora was not oily. I enjoyed it along with the lentils and saffron rice. Vegetables were pretty plain. I had a little bit of the rice pudding and it wasn't too sweet. It tasted good but I didn't have much of it because I don't like to have too much coconut milk.  See you next time Taj!"}
{"text":"We recieved superb service and memorable food here. Rice, papadum, and a chutney assortment were all included with our meal, which I don't recall always being the case at local Indian restaurants. We will certainly return."}
{"text":"My wife and I visited to have supper. We both ordered supper for person, vegetarian and meat place, which include everything including dessert. tandoori was one of best I had in Canada. Curries are very good with both naan and rice. The dessert was sweet rice soup base, and it was also really good. The staffs are very friendly and nice. Price is just about right. We will definitely recommend this restaurant and will back for sure."}
{"text":"I feel like in Madison when you've been to one Indian buffet you've been to them all. The food here was good, tasty, but not memorable. It's a steal for 8 bucks though. The only reason I rate them an okay rating is that I think some other buffets around town offer some more interesting dishes during their buffet.  But they have all your basics and necessities here so you can't go wrong. And they are close to me so that is also a bonus."}
{"text":"My wife and checked this place out. First service is slow but when only 2 younger men are handling the whole restaurant...Well what do you expect.  The place lacks in communication,they do need to talk a bit more. Ok service has issues,check. The food was...well.... ok? This is not the best representation of an indian food restaurant, but not the worst. Maybe a good start for the beginning foodie.  Well check it out and you decide."}
{"text":"I went to Taj on friday driving all the way from middleton to way with my friends who work at UW. When i stepped inside the restaurant I can barely see any customers, we went for the buffet and it was horrible. All the dishes seems to be horrible they didn't look fresh at all. Only thing I liked is samosa which seems to be freshly made. I went to Dhaba, Minerva and swagat on west side and Taj seems to the worst of all. I will never goto this place and wouldn't recommend to my friends.  Stay away from this restaurant."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant with the best Indian lunch buffet in Madison for the price.  Gracious owners and linen tablecloths."}
{"text":"I found this place on the AA Dining Advantage website. I was the only diner on a Sunday evening, although several people came in for take out. The mild lamb shish kebab was spicy in a delicious way; there was enough for two servings. I also got a fresh side salad; nothing fancy. Service was adequate. Prices are fair."}
{"text":"*Try the Peshwari naan.* The chopped raisins give the naan a unique, subtle sweetness that goes very well with curries. All the curries I have tried are incredibly flavorful and well balanced. Their lamb is so tender. Like almost all Indian restaurants they can't cook the meat directly in the sauce since there are so many different sauces, but this lamb is very delicious in its own right. Same goes for the fish and chicken. Favorite curries so far: Lamb Mughlai, Chicken Korma."}
{"text":"I am relatively inexperienced with Indian food, and as someone who is very picky with food I am unfamiliar with, my experience here was pleasant. Service was quick and we were seated promptly. My SO and I came on a quiet afternoon after he stated he was craving some Indian food. There were only about 3 other people in the restaurant so it was pretty quiet. I had no clue what the chutney was for, and I didn't like the aftertaste of papadum (just in general), so I just waited for my order for the tikka masala and mango lassi. The naan and my mango lassi came first, the latter being very delicious. I don't like the taste of naan, but their tikka masala and the rice were excellent. The chicken was tender and I couldn't get enough. So as far as service and the quality of the food I ordered, I was very satisfied!"}
{"text":"I want to give it five stars.  I went here easily 25+ times over the past three years.  I've been here for both the all you can eat lunch and dinner (dine in and dine out).  I really like the people who own and run the restaurant, and I would love to see them keep dishing out food for years to come.   But despite my loyalty, I just can't go above three stars.  First of all, it is pretty pricey.  $11.95 and up for entrees, and an extra $2.50 for the almost obligatory naan ($1.95 for plain).  Granted, it's a lot of food- you get a big serving of rice along with a large, generous portion of meat and curry.  But it's madison....I can eat at some places very close for under $6.  Second, I know it's recycled lunch items on me for dinner take out.  It's not hard to tell.  Dried out, reheated naan just doesn't taste like it does when it's piping hot out of the tandoori oven.  I'm pretty sure i've had reheated lunch servings of curry as well.  It didn't happen every time, but it happened enough that I decreased my visits.  Lunch is probably better than dinner, with a big selection to choose from, and all of the food is good.  I'd definitely recommend it for lunch.  I feel like the chef needs to go on \"kitchen nightmares.\"  The food is great, but It just seems like somewhere along the grind of maintaining a restaurant the owners/chefs lost their passion.  Gordon ramsey, make them whole again.  Then maybe I can come back and update my posts after I get some fresh cooked food at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"With a smaller selection than other nearby Indian restaurants -- quality counts. Unfortunately Taj has consistently delivered only \"Okay\" levels of quality.   The price is on the lower end of average which helps make up for it and I haven't ever had anything BAD here at all but I've had some unfortunately fatty pieces of meat that did mar what would have been an otherwise good dish.  I definitely get the impression that their lunch buffet is just \"going through the motions\" -- perhaps their dinner service is better?   That being said I'll speak for the lunch buffet only -- unless you're only going because it is in walking distance for lunch -- you've got other options that will deliver better selection and better taste."}
{"text":"Great food.  The best Indian in Airdrie, but a bit pricey.  Good place for date night.  They also have a nice buffet.  Take out is good.  Often, when my family is visiting from out of town, we order a whole bunch of dishes and enjoy at home while the kids play."}
{"text":"Wow, excellent food, great attentive service. They are respectful enough to ask you how spicy you like it. You can actually taste that they grind their own spices. The food was hot, fresh and extremely tasty. The portions are good size, I definitely left full."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout from this restaurant. The food was great! Had the chef selection, which comes with three entree choices of the chef!"}
{"text":"I guess I'm not hating on this restaurant because I've never been to the bathrooms. :P  I have only gotten takeout from here (buffet for takout and dinner one time). Not the best Indian buffet ever, but good. If you're looking for spice, none of the buffet items are spicy in my personal experience.  You can get buffet to go for the same  price as lunch buffet--you can fill up a takeout container with food and also get naan to go.  My preferred Indian restaurant in Madison is Swagat on the restaurant, but the Taj is all right."}
{"text":"The food's good, no doubt there. Cleanliness and service earn the ding, however. It's common to be left at your table for a long period without checking on drinks, etc., and carry-out orders, even when the restaurant is slow, can sometimes take a lot longer than initially suggested.  The real ding comes from the woman we saw adjust a rug on the floor and then proceed to handle clean plates to put on our table. No handwashing in between!"}
{"text":"It was my night out with the family and we decided on Indian. Being that we aren't familiar with many restaurants in Airdrie, being mostly creatures of habit. Taj is located in a strip mall and as we came across it we thought it was closed because there weren't any lights and no one in the restaurant. We were seated right away and the waiter was very friendly. As we perused the menu they had mostly the classics :Butter Chicken, Tandoori Chicken etc..  Prices were higher than normal. Food was delicious what can  I say. The reason I'm giving it three stars is because you pay for Rice and Naan bread separately which I've never seen in any other Indian restaurant. Secondly the service once we received was average. Food was great but the fact that I had to pay for Rice and Naan separately really killed the experience for me and I doubt I'd be back."}
{"text":"Ever since my husband took me to my first Indian buffet in town, I've been trying other places like it.  Today we went to the Taj, and I was pretty excited.  It was very cozy, and the staff was so friendly.  But as far as food selection and food quality, definitely not worth it.  The one fish dish they had was so dry, I could barely chew it (and this was only an hour after they'd opened today, so you'd think it would've been fresh!).  I would not recommend this Indian buffet, and would instead direct others to either A. Swagat on Old Sauk Rd or B. Maharini on West Washington Ave.  I don't think I'll be back to the Taj though."}
{"text":"In town from Edmonton and looked for a nice Indian restaurant to go to.  Found Taj online and came to try it out.  The service was very personalized, like a family restaurant; the food was extremely good.  We thoroughly enjoyed the experience and would come again."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what made me think of this place today, but I miss eating there. Good food and the folks who own it are a real pleasure. It's not that Indian food in Philly is terrible - but it ain't great neither. Glad to see Taj is still doing."}
{"text":"We went here on a Wednesday night. There was like maybe 1 or 2 other tables around. Service was slow. The atmosphere is meh and lame at best. The food was horrible. It tasted so bland. I think they should visit some of the other prominent Indian restaurants in Madison and try their spices.  Additionally, if you're going in there to use a restaurant.com certificate, be aware. Good luck if they honor it.  They don't really treat you with much respect there. You'd think they would want more customers, and if a new customer comes in, you'd think they would try to wow you but they don't and they won't.  There is much better Indian food around Madison. I would stay way from this place. I would give 0 stars if I could."}
{"text":"Taj serves up the best Indian dinner in all of Madison. I have been on several occasions and have always enjoyed all aspects of my night out.   The restaurant itself is pretty small but very well lit and cheery. There have been several other groups dining during my visits, but I have never had to wait for a table. The staff is always attentive but never in the way.   The complimentary poppadom with three chutneys is a great way to start the meal off. All three chutneys are very flavorful and completely different from one another. The chai is wonderful; I'm pretty sure it's made with cream. Great naan too. For the main course, my favorite is the vegetable korma. It's the perfect combination of creamy and spicy. I am a little skeptical that the vegetables were frozen minutes before the reached my plate, but who's to care if it still tastes like heaven on earth? The saag paneer was also very good.   I have yet to try Taj's lunch buffet, but if the food is anything like it is for dinner, I'm pretty sure I won't be disappointed."}
