{"text":"This was probably the best seafood meal I have ever had! And in Pittsburgh!! Who knew? 2 locals on the strip recommended this restaurant when I asked where we should eat atop Mount Washington. They both stated Monterey Bay Fish Grotto. 
The drinks were excellent, as was the ambiance. The view was amazing and we weren't even by the window, but elevated to where we could see everything. Incredible! The appetizer was to die for, and the meal itself was superb! I had the parmesan crusted swordfish, my husband had the crabcake with sea scallops, and our daughter had the crabcakes. All were cooked to perfection and plated beautifully. Our server knew what she was talking about and was very helpful in our selections. For dessert, we shared creme brulee and the angel food grilled cheese. Oh my word, talk about delicious! If you don't eat anywhere else in Pittsburgh, this is THE place to try!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and everything from the starters to the dessert was absolutely fantastic! Everyone in our party of 8 tried a different type of fish and the vegetarian ravioli and nothing disappointed. The best part of the meal was the angel food grilled cheese for dessert. Our waiter recommended it and he was spot on. I would highly recommend it as well!"}
{"text":"I was there about two months ago, wanted to write the review but kept forgetting.  Anyway, it wasn't an impressive dinner at all, mostly because of the service.  That night was very easy to recall because there was a false alarm go off right after we got seated.  We went back to continue our dinner after things were clear.  Server, Jason, was nice and introduced himself.  However, his service was not so remarkable.  Didn't give us water until almost 20 minutes later.  I asked him to give me a taste of two different wine, he only brought one glass?!!!! Really? After I told him which one I liked, I waited forever for him to bring over the wine (it was busy at all btw).  Then soup was served, without spoon.... Main courses came, but he didn't clear the table first...  At the end, he gave us a check without asking me if I would like dessert.. SMH. I had dessert anyway.  I ended up tipping him 20% not because his service was good, just because I used to be a server, and I don't know how to tip less than that.  
I just think, a nice high class restaurant like that should have trained the server better.  I was very disappointed.  Food was good but unfortunately I will not go back."}
{"text":"Ok, so this place has amazing seafood and a fantastic view of the city too.  Probably one of the best views you find.  The entree portions are BIG, the plating is beautiful and the fish tastes great.  The fish is flown in fresh daily.  My wife ordered the Branzino and she got a full fish for her entree and it was prepared perfectly.  I ordered the red snapper and thoroughly enjoyed it too.  For starters we had a special combo platter that had swordfish and salmon skewers, lump crab cake (all crab, no fillers) and Cajun seasoned tiger prawn shrimp.  Great way to start a meal.  The service was superb too.  The only catch is that you get what you pay for and this place is definitely not inexpensive.  If you're thinking about going, plan to spend around $65-75 per person."}
{"text":"I liked the restaurant although the fake, painted poles supposed to look like palm trees are a little hokey.   The view of the city made up for that.   The food was delicious including the amazing crab cakes.  I'd definitely dine here again!"}
{"text":"My mom and I had lunch here yesterday in a spur of the moment decision. We were very happy with the food and the service. We remember when Monterrey Bay was on top of the Jennette Building and its predecessor, the Rodi Grill. 

We both had the scallops and they were wonderful...more like a scampi...they just melted in your mouth.

Our waiter, Robert, was attentive without being obtrusive and very polite. The manager, Karen, stopped by our table to introduce herself.

The d√©cor is not overly stiff or formal...we felt comfortable there wearing jeans, having just finished shopping.

As far as the prices go...for the satisfying potions of seafood we were served, the price was reasonable. I believe most lunch items come with a side dish."}
{"text":"Server was very professional, knowledgeable. 
 Arr on time for a 6:30 reservation made 6 weeks prior. asked for window table - denied although there were several empty tables.  NOW, there is a table wait list.  nothing more than a ploy for bar business.  Seated at an elev booth that was so tight couldn't move. View - of the other side of the booth, with a screeching drunk carrying on just above at the bar.  Poor waitress couldn't reach far enough to serve the meal or clear plates. so, we served ourselves basically. 1 drink, 8 scallops, 2 salads = $160 - not so much.  the remodel is grey, drab. 
Had 2 handicap guests.  No handicap bathroom on dining floor after remodel.  What's that all about!  entry benches are new, low modern style for kindergarten kids.  Had to assist both seating and rising for handicap.  the designer is clueless when it comes to handicap and senior citizens. 
Across the street, other Mt. Washington restaurant are superior, classy ambience compared to Monterey."}
{"text":"My wife and I stayed in Pittsburg on our way to a wedding.  A friend from Chicago recommended we try this place.  We sat at the bar on the upper level and the view was beautiful.  We had a few drinks and some excellent apps.  Mike was our bartender and provided, along with the great drinks, some information about the area.  The only thing better than the view and drinks, was the firecracker of a General manager Jennifer!  She was an absolute riot and could not have been a better proponent of her restaurant and city.  She said she might run for either mayor or governor and I think she'd win both! 
Highly recommend MBFG

{"text":"I LOVE Monterey Bay.  The restaurant is located high in Mt Washington and has excellent views of the entire Pittsburgh skyline.  The staff is polite and very helpful.  The best part though is the food.  If you like seafood, this is the place for you, if you don't like seafood, you will still find something you enjoy.  I didn't always like seafood so the first time I ate here I ordered the steak and it was delicious.  Now I like many different types of seafood so I can appreciate the cuisine even more.  They fly in fresh fish daily and you can tell.  The crab cakes are spectacular, they're my favorite.  They also have a great wine list and the last time we visited, their sommelier recommended a fantastic bottle for us.  It can be pricey especially if you are ordering bottles of wine, so we only go for special occasions, but I always look forward to it and leave completely satisfied."}
{"text":"5 stars for best crab cakes I've ever had!  Best views of the city and great ambiance for a date or large groups.  Prices are also very reasonable."}
{"text":"This place is amazing... the only downfall is the price, and sides are now a la cart. Entrees use to come with a salad and a side. They no longer do..."}
{"text":"As everyone before me mentioned this place has the best view of the skyline in the city.  Prices are high, but this is considered to be one of the finer dining experiences one can have while in Pittsburgh.

I would recomend this as a great location for a business meeting or a date.  While fish is the speciality on the menu, thier beef and chicken dishes are just as tasty!!"}
{"text":"There is just no arguing that the Monterey Bay Fish Grotto has amazing views. Simply spectacular.  Inside, it has a nice decor and comfortable atmosphere.  That is where things began to break down.  The wine service was disappointing for a Wine Spectator Award of Excellence restaurant.  I ordered a specific vintage of Pinot Noir and reiterated the year to the waitress. The wine steward brought the wrong vintage, very poor for such a highly rated restaurant.  She was able to find the right bottle after I pointed out the error to her, but I shouldn't have had to point it out.  I also ordered the fish special, which came at a premium price, but it arrived lukewarm.  Again, disappointing. The food and wine \"experience\" downgraded the overall evening and showed that you can't live on ambiance alone in the restaurant business.  It will make me think twice before dining at the Monterey Bay Fish Grotto again."}
{"text":"Perfect destination for a special occasion. The view of Pittsburgh's skyline and all three rivers is beautiful and complemented the amazing service. Our server was extremely personable and knowledgable about the menu. His recommendations did not disappoint. The warm, romantic ambiance of the dining room makes you want to stay even after you've finished your meal. Everything from the crabcake appetizer, lobster bisque, entrees, dessert and cappuccinos were delicious."}
{"text":"We had been wanting to try this restaurant for some time and are so glad we did. Everything was excellent.

The food was outstanding: We started with the featured appetizer special, which was simply outstanding. We also enjoyed the two dinner specials and a bottle of wine from the wide selection on the wine list. The service was impeccable.

The view was fantastic. We did not have a window seat, but sat in the \"second row\" on the upper level. I think the view was just as good, and we did not feel rushed. In fact, our server encouraged us to take our time and enjoy ourselves.

The service was great from start to finish: valet parking, reception, server, sommelier, etc.

We are looking forward to a return visit....."}
{"text":"Monterey Bay Fish Grotto was a wonderful experience for my girlfriend and I. The wait staff was friendly and attentive. We got the sampler for the appetizer which came with 2 large shrimp, crab cake, and a bbq fish skewer. The app was delicious. My favorite was the crab cake which was made with nice lump crab meat and paired with a tasty hollandaise sauce. We both ordered fish for our entrees, she ordered the swordfish and I got the chilean sea bass. The fish was cooked perfectly. The neat thing about the menu are the numerous ways you can get your fish prepared. For desert we shared a creambule which was just as good as everything else we ate. Overall we had a great time and I would recomend this place to anyone who loves seafood."}
{"text":"By far, probably the the best maryland style crab cakes ever. I've tried several other places including ones in Manhattan (where I live now) and no one can beat their crab cakes. The taste, texture and consistency is hands down the best I've had.  It's also a good portion so you're not left hungry.  

The fish is also pretty fresh and the dishes are delicious though as I recall, the fish dishes were uninspiring, offering very little creativity. The ingredients didn't jump out at me. Presentation and ambience is great for Pittsburgh, offering great views of the city. Nice place to take clients or your date. Next to the Original Fish Market in downtown, this is the only place I go for seafood in Pittsburgh because they do it right."}
{"text":"My first time in town and my boyfriend took me here for their well-known fresh seafood.

We ordered a sampler appetizer, two Chilean Sea Bass with Caribbean-Jerk spices with pineapple, red peppers and chives as well as a side of asparagus and red peppers.

Food:
The sampler appetizer included 2 tiger shrimps, crab cake, and 5 bite size pieces of swordfish, salmon and tuna.
- Chilled jumbo shrimps were fresh, bouncy and flavourful with the cocktail sauce.
- Crab cake was fresh and soft with loads of crab meats instead of breadcrumbs.      *Best crab cake I ever had. 
- Five bite size pieces of fresh swordfish, salmon and tuna taste very unique with the Ancho chili mayonnaise.
-The Chilean Sea Bass was very tasty, soft, fresh and full of flavours. It's sweet with a hint of spicy jerk taste.  
-Asparagus and red peppers side dish was delicious.

Atmosphere:
It has a spectacular city night view and the atmosphere is very romantic and classy. I really like the palm trees decors. It's a great place to celebrate any kind of special occasion.

Service:
Excellence service!! The waiter is very friendly and courteous. He's always on the roll of keeping our table spotlessly clean and our glass cups were never empty. Also the manager stopped by our table to ensure everything is going well.

Overall, this was a very memorable experience and one of the best highlight of my trip. Excellent quality of food and service! I'll be looking forward to my next trip to Pittsburgh for more delicious seafood food at Monterey Bay and hopefully we'll get the window seats."}
{"text":"My first trip here was for my cousin's rehearsal dinner in 2005. I had the crabcakes and they have had me ever since. 

My most recent visit was at the end of April. An old college roommate was in town shooting a video for a client, and our other roommate had recently moved back to the Burgh from DC, so I planned to come in for the weekend. Both friends are new mothers, and a dinner out- let alone with old pals- was a rare treat. 

I called the restaurant and let the host know of our special occasion. I feel like the host must have tweeted it or something, because from the moment we walked in, we were treated like gold. A manager even stopped by and ensured we were being taken care of! 

A great table with a spectacular view, attentive service (including accommodating my friend's dairy restrictions without missing a beat), and fantastic food. We shared an appetizer that came with roasted shrimp, a fish kebab, and a crabcake. Those crabcakes, damn! For my entree, I had the ahi tuna- it was fresh and buttery soft, yes!

We lingered and laughed and told tawdry tales and no one rushed us out. Our server even told us usually tables of women aren't her favorite but we were a joy to serve. We left smiling ear to ear. Bravo, Monterey Bay!"}
{"text":"I went here awhile ago and never got around to posting. My host (for my stay in Pittsburgh) took me to out to the most classic place that people need to go to for food and views. I didn't know anything about Monterey Bay, so I thought it would be another cool dig to chow down at.

Little did I know that this was for those who are looking for a nice, EXPENSIVE night out. Luckily having a full-time job helps, but families and savvy savers might want to avoid this one.

I'm sure everyone has mentioned the location, so I'll get to the food. We opted for the bar downstairs because it's self-seating, and much more intimate (honestly with better views, too). Skipped out on the drinks because I had an early start the next day, and my host and I decided to settle on the ceviche. I thought it was okay. Appreciated the ahi tuna, but the flavor was more than lacking - the taste was slightly pickled and nothing else. I've had better ceviche.

Running on an ahi tuna high, I went with that done sashimi style (seared rare) with pickled ginger and sesame seeds. That was good, much enjoyed and the cut was almost too huge for me to finish. It was worth it, the main dishes all around are worth it. Unfortunately, I forgot what my host ordered, but she said it was a go-to for her - so, I'm assuming she loves it!

Obviously, if we're breaking the bank, might as well get dessert. She did the angel food grilled cheese sandwich, which was absolutely heavenly and I'd eat that all day. I went with a favorite classic: cheesecake, which put me to bed because it was creamier than most I've had, and a little less sweet. 

I cried a little inside looking at the bill, but it was definitely for the views that you get. In all honesty, it reminds me of places like XIX or R2L in Philly, and it's great for a one-time date or a special occasion, but I could find better uses and places for my money. Worth it for the trip and experience, but you're not missing out on anything at all."}
{"text":"Horrible service and food. We received the lobster bisque and it was very dry and not even lobster it was crawfish. Also out Chilean sea bass I highly doubt was Seabass not flaky at all. Altius is right next door please go there the food never lets u down"}
{"text":"Made reservations the day of to celebrate our wedding annivesary. Never having been to this restaurant before we we excited to experience the fresh seafood this establishment prepares. Our waiter Chad was excellent in his recommendations for appetizers, Maryland crab soup and pistachio, mandarin salad with goat cheese in a blood orange vinegarette. Very flavorful and would have been satisfied with these as our main entrees. He suggested the Chilean sea bass with macademia crusted topping and the grouper with the artichokes.,olives and mushrooms. Loved both of these dishes as they were extremely tasty and full  of flavor. Sea bass was our top choice. They also provided us with a free dessert for our annivesary, the angelfood cheese sandwich. We usually sway towards chocolate for desserts but wanted to try something different.  Best non chocolate  dessert  we ever had. Definitely  was worth the two hour drive to get here.
Will come back after  they renovate in January. Palm tress are coming down. Can't wait to see the make over. Thanks  for a memorable evening  with the amazing view of the city !"}
{"text":"I came here with my family on the Friday after Thanksgiving.  We spent about $120 for the four of us.  A lot of the cost is because of the view, and not necessarily the food.  

There is a nice elevator ride up to the top of this hotel building.  They have some nice aquariums with bubbles rising for ambience, though I think the palm tree columns seem a little tacky.  

The fresh bread they served was good.  However, service was slow.  The place was quite empty, and yet somehow we still had to wait for an hour for our food.  

We started off with the crab cake and ichiban.  The crab cake had remoulade sauce and was very good.  The ichiban has several different fish.  The salmon was good, but it seems like some of the other fish were not cooked to the same consistency.  

For the main course, my family had several different fish.  I had the Yellow Fin Tuna stuffed with spinach, mushrooms and goat cheese drizzled with
a Marsala wine sauce (my waiter recommended it).  While the rest of my family seemed to like their Mahi Mahi for instance, my fish was a little dry and the vegetables inside seemed soggy.  

Mediocre food, but come here primarily for its location and view."}
{"text":"We suffered a very sorry meal at this allegedly highly rated restaurant.  The butternut squash tasted like almond paste.  My husband's crab claws arrived at the table, hardly cracked.  After serving us, the waiter disappeared and my husband had to get up from the table to ask for a claw cracker.  The waiter returned quickly enough, full of apology.  Apparently, this establishment expects their patrons to dig the crab out of the legs with a dinner fork and knife.  While the waiter was well-versed on the selection of fish available, when he was asked the size of the stone crab claws, he replied \"a half pound\".   The standard answer at restaurants whose specialty is stone crabs is \"small, medium or large\"......FAIL.   The owner would be well-advised to clean the carpeting and find an air freshener that doesn't smell like stale socks.   On the upside, the view of the city is incomparable.  Wish the food and service was close."}
{"text":"Great food, typically great service, great view. I have been a few times for special occasions and am always very satisfied with my meal. It is expensive, but you get what you pay for. The mangers have also helped me get a special table for a special occasion when it is not too busy. Valet parking guys are also quick and professional."}
{"text":"I've eaten here quite a few times and have never been disappointed! Great view, excellent food and friendly, attentive service. Each and every dish that I've tried has been perfectly prepared and tasted great and I loveee the lava cake dessert! I've moved to San Francisco since eating here last and even after living in a city that has really high food standards I think Monterey Bay Fish Grotto has excellent food and reasonable prices for the location and the view. This is definitely my favorite special occasion restaurant in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I was thoroughly disappointed with the restaurant.  Basically, we paid for a view.  The appetizer was good.  The main course was horrible.  I don't know how the lobster made it out of the kitchen.  It was cold and tasted sour.  On the inner shell, it was blackened and gray.  The kitchen dissected my lobster and came up with with the same conclusion. My husband's dinner (the tuna) was supposed to be seared on both sides and only one side was seated.   The Brussels sprouts were unevenly cut.  The main course was bad all around.  Not worth the money, don't go......,"}
{"text":"my expectations fail me again. the decor inside was beautiful. art deco grotto type feel with all the waterfalls and metal art.  the waitress was nice but knew nothing about the wine selection. finally the sommelier came and helped us out. the food was less than par for the price. altho they did have a pretty wide selection of different types of fish, the portions were a bit small and the sides were so BLAH. i definitely would not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Best view of the city I have scene thus far.  They do not take reservations for window seats however from my view it seems there isn't a bad seat in the house regarding the view.  The service was outstanding.  The food was very good.  The bar has a great view as well and is just below the restaurant so it is a nice spot to grab a drink and relax."}
{"text":"We had family in to Pittsburgh for the very first time from Indiana. The trip was planned for months and being from Pittsburgh myself I wanted them to experience Mt Washington and the incredible view as well as what I believed would be one of the best restaurants in Pittsburgh. We were a party of 5 and made our reservation for Saturday night September 21st at 9pm in order to not be in the busiest time period. We arrived at 5 minutes to 9 and were rudely treated at first by the valet parking attendant as the entry to the valet parking area is actually very tight and very confusing. He literally shouted at us to \"back up\" and in general just made us feel like school kids!!.....well up in the elevator to the restaurant itself and indeed the views are spectacular....unfortunately that was the last \"spectacular\" item of the evening. After checking in at the host stand it took another 15 minutes before out table was ready??....and it was NOT busy at this stage and as above one of the reasons we made the later booking. After being seated it was at least another 10 minutes before anyone came to attend to us other than getting served ice water???....the waitress finally came to the table and gave us the menus and told us of the specials....took our cocktail orders and was off.....another 10 minutes passed and finally we were served 1 small bread basket with one small dish of butter....for 5 people??....still no cocktails but we placed an appetizer order and also our entree order as well as we were really hungry at this point.....well another 10 minutes passed and still no cocktails or appetizers.....we had devoured the small bread basket long ago so we asked another different waiter if we could get another basket and it seemed like we were asking for something way out of line???.....finally our waitress came back to our table (after we observed her across the room at another table chatting for at least 10 minutes) and asked about our cocktails which by now had been ordered about 20 minutes ago.....5 minutes later the cocktails arrived and 5 minutes after that the appetizers arrived....had oysters rockefeller which were cold and just very bland in general. Approximately another 15 minutes later our entrees arrived and as 3 in our group had ordered steaks we found that all 3 were NOT at anywhere near the requested level of temperature other than the one filet that had been requested as medium well and since it was butterflied it had been cooked to a piece of shoe leather!!!....the other 2 were to be medium and were basically what anyone would call very rare to rare at best....with the length of time it had taken just to get served we were not about to try and send anything back....the one Chilean Sea Bass entree was very good....the salmon entree was again cold, bland and just not what one would expect from a establishment with the reputation the Monterey Bay Fish Grotto was supposed to have....oh and the $12 tricolor roasted potatoes were also cold, bland and tasteless!!.....we ate what we could and left after a $400 bill with significant disappointment!!.....I know some will say why did you go to the \"Fish Grotto\" and order steaks but thats what our group chose and if it is on the menu and at the prices charged they also should be nothing short of excellent which they were NOT....having dined all over the Pittsburgh area for the last 35 years I can assure diners who are looking for a great dining experience that there are FAR BETTER choices than the MBFG.....unless you want to spend $80 per person (with NO wine) just for the chance of having a table with the great view I highly suggest you look elsewhere even on Mt Washington....as per the title simply not even close to \"The Standard\" expected and deserved."}
{"text":"To start, this restaurant has some of the finest views of the Pittsburgh skyline. The large wall to ceiling windows allow diners to enjoy panoramic views from their table. I ordered the Chilean Sea Bass with a glass of Argentine Malbec and thoroughly enjoyed it. The desserts were great as well."}
{"text":"This is literally one of the best meals my husband and I have ever eaten. We considered moving to Pittsburgh after eating here. The sushi was fresh and delicious, and the entrees were nice portions but more importantly tasted amazing. Nothing about this place disappointed, including the view. Our waitress Casey was knowledgable and gracious. We're still talking about the grilled cheese angel food dessert. Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has a spectacular view of Pittsburgh from Mount Washington.  That gets it three stars before you even think about eating.  The decor is understated and elegant.  I was entertaining guests from 
Europe and the were impressed by the ambiance.

They have a diverse selection of fish flown in daily from various parts of the world, but mainly from the US.  One guest had the sea food bisque served over lump crab meat as a starter.  He indicated that it was good.  The other individual had the calamari which he enjoyed and I had the spinach salad.

For our main course one of my guests had the halibut, and my other guest and I had the crab cakes.  The waitress indicated that the crab cakes were a specialty.  They were very good, just enough breading to call them cakes barely holding together the jumbo lump crab.  They sat in a delicious sauce that was lightly applied to the plate.

Excellent warm bread was served with meal.

I am not a wine expert, but the list while not extensive seemed to span the range of wines appropriate for the menu and various budgets.  We had a chardonnay from the Columbia River Valley.  It was nice.

Often restaurants with great views have so so food.  That is not the case here.  It is a great place for a special event or to entertain business associates."}
{"text":"I went to Monterey Bay Fish Grotto for a friend's fancy birthday dinner. 

If you're dishing out $50 of appetizers and entrees, then shouldn't you be expecting something amazing? Unfortunately, I didn't get that from Monterey Bay. I ordered the scallop and shrimp teriyaki brochette, and the dish was extremely salty. 

I wasn't really pleased with the ambiance either because it had a gaudy interior design. Fake palm trees? Please."}
{"text":"Per their website they stop serving dinner at 10 on Friday, but upon arriving we were told they changed hours and now close at 9. 

Please update your website."}
{"text":"These people are totally stuck in the 80's. Blue plates? Decor anyone?

The fish is average and the view is great."}
{"text":"First off, the food is absolutely amazing.  A must visit. Plus the view is spectacular.  But tonight, my review is about the customer service - stellar.  There were a few mishaps with the meal, but if there was ever a way to salvage a mistake, MB did it with flying colors.  The management handled everything perfectly.  But the real applause goes to Jessica, who works in the lounge.  She is on her game, knows how to treat a customer, and, well, is VERY easy on the eyes...  She's the reason I'll definitely be going back.

Great food, great view, and amazing customer service."}
{"text":"Holy chicago this place is fire. The calamari the sushi the steak the ahi tuna the asparagus was all sexy. Well done. I recommend getting a window seat if you can. Sick view."}
{"text":"Excellent place with terrific views.  And the food is delicious."}
{"text":"Best seafood in Pittsburgh. Fresh and has so much flavor. Food was just amazing and the service was just as good. I will be definitely coming back with family."}
{"text":"An amazing view of Pittsburgh?  It's true.  This was my first visit to Pittsburgh and a client suggested we try Monterey Bay.  Located on top of what I guest is the Mount Washington section of Pittsburgh, Monterey Bay is located in what appears to be an older high rise apartment building.  At the entrance you take an elevator up to the main dining room on one floor or the bar on another floor or the wine cellar on another floor.  The view of the downtown three river section of the city is really quite exceptional, particularly as the sun goes down.  By the way the seafood was as good as or better than the view."}
{"text":"One of the worst dining experiences I have ever had in the city of Pittsburgh. Horrible service and cheap food trying to be passed off as high end."}
{"text":"We went here for a date night when we were visiting Pittsburgh.  The Food was Great.  We both had fish and they were done to perfection.  On top of the food being so good the service was even better.  We showed up right as the opened for the evening and we had no problems getting a table.  As a matter a fact we had the best table in the house.  Chad was our server and he was awesome.  The view from the place Is jaw dropping.      We also got the Angel Food Grilled Cheese Sandwich for dessert.  Best dessert I have ever had."}
{"text":"The first time I went to Monterey Bay, the only thing I remembered was the view. The second time I went, my salad had a hair in it. The third time, I was so displeased with my overall experience that I felt compelled to write something.

I usually don't complain about service or food but to be treated the way I was on all levels is disrespectful. I understand you're trying to maintain a reputation on par with the other establishments along Grandview Avenue, but you're failing, Monterey Bay. On multiple levels.

I've never made reservations for the dining room. Why should you when the bar downstairs is more romantic and almost always guarantees a view of the city? If you do ever venture to Monterey Bay, keep that in mind.

I, along with two other people, saddled up to the bar and patiently waited for a table to become available. Naturally, we wanted a drink while we waited. That wouldn't have been a problem if our bartender didn't act like we didn't exist. Ok, Mr. Bartender, I get you are busy but the rudeness and unwelcoming environment you created is truly unnecessary. While I may look young, my money is just as good as everyone surrounding me. And actually you should be catering to me since I'm at an age where I have a \"disposable income\" to waste on things like a tip. You might have known that if you taken the time to ask me anything other than \"drink?\"

We almost left after that. Unfortunately, a table opened up.

Fifteen minutes after we sat at our table filled with dishes and glasses, I finally waved someone over. He apologized and cleared the table and sent our waitress over. Have you ever been scolded at a fine dining establishment? I have. It was really... interesting. Our waitress asked if we planned on eating, if we payed our bar tab, and a myriad of other questions you might ask a group of teenagers looking to dine-and-dash.

She then proceeded to ignore us in favor of her 3 other tables (One was a couple celebrating their anniversary, one was a couple waiting for a table upstairs and the other was a family). She didn't make any recommendations, she barely engaged in conversation, and she gave us different dinnerware than everyone else. The last one is not a big deal but I notice these things.

When our food came out it was cold. Not even under a heat lamp cold. It was just cold. And fish is not very tasty cold. My scallops were gritty and missing ingredients listed on the menu. And for the price, I expected my knife to melt through the scallop like it was hot butter. But I guess sawing through a scallop is ok too.

It's a real shame I won't ever be going back to Monterey Bay because that snack mix they had at the bar was seriously amazing."}
{"text":"Stopped in on Saturday early evening for date night. We opted to park on the street versus Valet for $6, simply because we were able to get a street spot easily and had a feeling we needed a little walk after we stuffed ourselves silly with all the great food! 

We took the elevator up along with the crowd of people waiting, which had a large window overlooking the city so you can catch a glimpse if you enter the elevator facing the back. Since we had a reservation, we were seated promptly at a table in the main dining room facing the floor to ceiling windows. Although all the tables by the windows were taken, we didn't mind since it was foggy and rainy, there wasn't much of a view. 

I forget the name of our server, but he was polite and efficient. He let us know of the specials and recommendations and gave us enough time to look over the menu. We continued to order the Sakari Sushi Roll for our appetizer, which was phenomenal. It was probably my favorite part of the meal. The sushi tasted fresh and the texture of the tempura outer shell was crispy and light. Very tasty, indeed. For entrees, we ordered the Salmon special which was accompanied by a sweet potato and flash fried shrimp. My date thought it was delicious. I ordered the famous crab cakes, and boy the other reviewers weren't kidding about how good they were. The crab cakes had 90% crab and hardly any fillers. Well worth the $36 price tag. For the side dish, we shared the crab Mac and cheese. This was the only dish I wasn't crazy for. Especially for the $19 price tag, there was barely any crab and the cheese was overly creamy and the macaroni was a little too al dente for my taste. For dessert we got the Angel food cake grilled cheese. Although it was delicious, I regret not getting the Pineapple Upside down bread pudding instead. Another table had ordered it and I was drooling at the sight of it. And they were shoveling it down faster than I could blink, so I imagine it was tasty! :) 

Overall, with a couple of drinks and coffee, our bill came to just under $200. I think this meal was very good, but I think I would have saved it for more of a special occasion like a birthday or Anniversary. But the service was impeccable and the Manager Skylar was very nice and checked in a couple of times to make sure we were enjoying ourselves."}
{"text":"This place is great! I loved their seabass. They definitely did a great job. The tuna tartar and dessert were tasty too. Food presentation and spectacular view from the restaurant made this place a great place for dinner."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for a splurge

Excellent fish
Great view
Superb wines (but very expensive)"}
{"text":"Went there for dinner Friday night as a pre-Valentine's Day dinner. It was great. I haven't been to all of the restaurants on Mt. Washington but I've been to several and this is by far the coolest/best view.  The restaurant is on the top floor of the building so you get this cool view of the city on the elevator ride up. Once in the restaurant, it's just a neat view. It's panoramic and a different view from any of the restaurants on the cliff side of Grandview Ave. 
The food was awesome.  Service was great, food was great. For dessert I got the Angel Food Grilled Cheese sandwich. How weird does that sound? It was really really really good!"}
{"text":"We took some guests to this restaurant while doing business in Monroeville and we were very disappointed.   The restaurant was almost empty and for good reason.   The food was tasteless and the service uneven and unprofessional.    The only thing that was good was the ichiban and I still don't know exactly what I was eating!     The walleye was completely tasteless and had no seasoning - sauteed with a mealy crust that was colorless and unappetizing.   The steak and swordfish didn't look much better.   This place needs an overhaul, badly!"}
{"text":"This was one of the most disappointing experiences I have had in what should be a wonderful restaurant given the creative menu and the prices.  My food --- yellowfin tuna au poivre -- was heavy with pepper that was too finely ground and not fresh.  The mustard cream sauce was too sharp and had no finesse at all.  It was priced at $32.95 with a side dish and small salad which would be reasonable if it had been special.  The chef is not up to the challenges of the nice menu. The restaurant had beautiful decor but the staff and service were lacking in ambiance -- my server hardly had a smile, the tray service was stilted and dated, and the place was all but empty. Perhaps the location, at a mall, is the wrong place for this restaurant that is steeped in white table clothes, a fine wine cellar, and a terrific selection of seafood."}
{"text":"The view, service, and food are all exceptional.  Plan to spend some time here and enjoy the entire experience - it is great for special occasions or just a night out.

Just a few tips:
1. Make a reservation.  You can't request window seating until you're there so at least reserve a table and then ask.  There isn't a bad seat in the house, though.  They've built it so each table has some kind of view even if they're not right next to the window. 

2. It is a little more expensive than people lead on - for shared appetizers, entrees, one drink and one dessert, it is roughly $90 to $100 per person.  If you go just for the entrees, then you're closer to that $30 - $50 range listed.  If you're going, I'd recommend spending the extra money if you can.  The drinks, wine list, appetizers, and desserts are amazing.

3.  Take the incline to get there.  It is touristy (and only takes exact change in cash) but the views are amazing.  If you time it right, you can go up the incline during the day and go down at night so you get both views.

I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here with a couple of friends in town for business and we loved it. The food was absolutely awesome, we ordered the oysters which were really fresh and good. We also got the Lobster Bisque which was good but a bit too thick for me. We ordered sushi with came out beautifully presented, it looked like a flower and it tasted great and fresh. I ordered the SeaBass and it was so good I didn't have any left. 
My only one complaint is that we were there for awhile and were the second last table to leave  and my friend made a joke about something and our waitress made a rude comment back about how she deserved a glass of wine since she had to \"deal\" with us. Keep in mind we weren't loud or obnoxious we just stayed for awhile, which was too her benefit because we ate and drank the whole night so our bill was not cheap. Other than that we had a fantastic time and will definitely be back.

It's also a great spot for a date since it has a beautiful view of downtown!"}
{"text":"I only ate at the Monroeville location twice and order Lobster Tail both times.  If you like Lobster this is the best place in our area. It melts in your mouth. It's hard to find anywhere besides Red Lobster (which is awful) that serves Lobster Tail. The only negative is the price.  It's expensive and doesn't have that \"5 Star\" atmosphere and service you would expect for the price. Has a good variety of wines available and beers (recommend trying the Chimay beer if you never have)."}
{"text":"Overall, at Monterey Bay, you're paying for the exquisite view and stellar service that you are receiving.  

Drinks run about 10 -15 dollars.  As an app my lovely boyrfiend, Ryan B, ordered the Ichiban - 2, yes only 2, skewers of various fish cooked in a terryaki liked glaze.  Not bad...overpriced at $14.  Next, the lobster bisque.  Biggest upset of the year 2010.  Well presented, bisque poured over a chunk of lobster claw - however, the soup was cold and more like Cambell's tomatoe with some chives in it.  

Salads were next - loaded with way too much vinaigrette, a very Asian feel with crispy noodles and a gingery taste.  Ask for dressing on the side.  The bread is amazing, though!

Ryan's entree was a flash fried ahi steak, stuffed with spicy crabmeat and coated in penko.  Only one bite truly was spicy.  It was over a bed of rice - however, they called it couscous, and ONE head of bokchoy.  Also, a bit cold for my liking.  ($45!!! OMG)

I ordered red snapper prepared Oscar style stuffed with crabmeat.  Not bad at all!  Green beans on the side were delicious.  ($33, could have whipped this up at home for about $10.)

Sampled the calamari - very good, a great app for a group.  Crabcake was great too - but, best crabcake in Pittsburgh can be found at Willow in the North Hills!  

I would recommend drinks and apps here with out of towners.  Know in advance it is a lot of money for a restaurant whose view does not compare with its food."}
{"text":"Recently came here for dinner with a group of family who are big fish eaters.  The first thing to note is that the view is the #1 reason to come (especially if from out of town like us).  It is perched on the hill overlooking the city and after dark, it is nice to look down on the city.  

Unfortunately, the restaurant decor itself is fairly outdated, but to be honest the view dominates so much that we did not notice.

Service was consistent and attentive.  The wine list was nice but overpriced.

The food unfortunately is what got this place 3 stars.  While the fish was definitely fresh (they claim flown in daily), the preparations that were ordered at my table just didnt work.  Some of them (mahi mahi) were too sweet, some too buttery, some to nutty, etc.  They didnt highlight the fish as much as they could have and tended to overpower the fish.

All in all this was a nice spot for dinner especially for people from out of town due to the view."}
{"text":"I came to this restaurant on Saturday night with a co-worker and his wife during an un-expected weekend trip to Pittsburgh.   This restaurant has a great view and it was a great way for a first timer to Pittsburgh like me to see the various areas of the city and the way the rivers connect and the skyline of downtown.  I was impressed by the wide selection of seafood, both type and preparation on the menu, so much I was pretty overwhelmed making my selection.  I am always impressed by restaurants that have the date on the top of their menu, showing that they change their menu daily based on what is fresh and available.

I finally decided on the yellow fin tuna with the stuffed preparation, which had mushrooms, and goat cheese and finished with a marsala sauce.  Our party chose the fingerling potatoes and creamed spinach as our sides to split.  When my meal came I was extremely impressed by the presentation - it was a generous serving of tuna and the preparation with the mushrooms and sauce looked delicious.  It reminded me of a preparation you would normally see for steak rather than fish, but tuna being a meatier fish it could handle this preparation.

The waitress had explained when we ordered that all fish is prepared to medium, except the tuna which is cooked to medium rare.  Well that was probably my only complaint about this dish - my tuna was cooked to a medium maybe even medium well (one inch thick steak with about a quarter inch of sear on either side) and I would have enjoyed it less well done.

Our sides were also delicious!  I was unsure if I would enjoy the creamed spinach, but it was prepared au gratin (who doesn't love anything which has cheese on it) and was well seasoned with nutmeg and salt, but not too salty.  Overall my dining experience here was pleasant - good food and good atmosphere. Also the waitress was very well versed in the different preparation of the fish and took her time in lots of detail explaining their daily specials which I always appreciate in a higher end restaurant like this!"}
{"text":"The best crab cakes I have ever eaten. Fish is always very good. One of the few upscale places around. Have eaten here when they used to be at jonnet building."}
{"text":"We always dine at the Monterey Bay Fish Grotto, when we are in Pittsburgh. The experience is so satisfying. The people are so nice and the food is outstanding. Thanks for taking such good care of us."}
{"text":"Luckily the view grabs your attention before the poorly placed Palm tree paintings. My boyfriend and I had soup for an appetizer, very good. I had the crab cakes for the main course, also tasty. The shared dishes left something to be desired. They were not bad by any means, but I am in no hurry to go back.  Wait staff was great. Very friendly, and let us take our time over a bottle of wine."}
{"text":"I would definitely recommend coming here for the perfect mid-week date night.  We had reservations on a late Monday night and it was not packed at all.  Service was excellent.  The drinks were so-so.  I tried the two off of the specialty drink menu and one cosmopolitan.  The soup of the day was a fire-roasted tomato with shrimp and crab.  That was excellent, especially if you like spicy food!  I ordered the Mahi Mahi cape cod style, which was cranberries and orange in a very light sauce.  I think it would have been much better if the sauce had more of a thickness so it would stick on the fish.  The fish itself was cooked nicely.  Overall, the view was phenomenal, food was delicious, and drinks were alright.  I would definitely come back for dinner again!"}
{"text":"Great view and wait staff. Food was good."}
{"text":"Supposedly the best seafood house in Pittsburgh and if you really know fish... this place will sorely disappoint you.  That start positive and view is amazing but so what,  I am here to eat and not take $200 photos.  Let's start with service.  All nice but clearly not managed and trained well.  Forgot bread, did not show us the wine before pouring, clumsily dripped it on each refill.  Came in on wrong side with nearly everything crossing your face with his arm.  Ok to the fish.  Preparations are 1980s with heavy sauces, lots of \"crusts\" and side from an old steak house.  Assuming it is fresh, I want to taste the fish and not the sauce.  Seems like they are hiding it.  It would also help to know the fish.  Description of rock fish was like a red snapper, flaky but with meatier taste.  Wrong.  It is super dense like a swordfish so the preparation he raved about make it too heavy.  Apps were also average and uninspired.  Soup was ok but it is soup.  For over $100 per person in Pittsburgh it should be better.  This place is resting on its laurels and needs a total refresh.  With all the creative new Food coming to our town... this place is a pass and spend your date night enjoying something you will remember."}
{"text":"Entrees are too salty. Lobster bisque soup was a failure but Crab cake is one of those Must-Try."}
{"text":"Monterey Bay is a wonderful place! The food is delicious and above all consistent. I've been three times and have not been disappointed. It's definitely not a place I would be going once a week because it is a bit pricey, but for special occasions, absolutely! The view is to die for! Go at sunset. Magical!  The decor is dated but I think they may be changing this soon if they have not already. 
I definitely recommend this restaurant if you've never been. The food, the service and the amazing view create an unforgettable dining experience."}
{"text":"Awesome food. The table had crab cakes, sea bass, seared tuna, and bbq'd salmon. Each was prepared expertly, and cooked perfectly. The tuna was especially good, with a delicious crust and a perfectly rare middle.

The service was exceptional. The view was gorgeous. 

The bill at the end of the night was... well, for what you get, you know what the bill is going to look like."}
{"text":"We went here tonight for my birthday. Fantastic. The soup special was clam chowder and it was by far the best soup I have ever had. Not just the best clam chowder but the best soup ever!!! Loved our waitress, the appetizer for 2 is a must. I would literally eat this every day if I could! Monterey Bay is one of my favorite places in the whole world. You should eat here. As often as you can!"}
{"text":"First time back since the remodeling. It still has that out of touch feel to it. There's nothing hanging on the walls.  Put up some art to fill in all the blank spaces.   Enough if that.  The food was blah!  Come on, $38 for Chilean sea bass! The cut was thin, the taste bland.  The sauce was runny and just didn't do it.  They gave me lime that looked like it was sitting out for days.  I couldn't even squeeze a drop of lime juice put of it.  This will be my last time to ever visit this resteraunt. Dob your self a favor and go somewhere else it's just not worth it!  I'll buy my Chilean sea bass at giant eagle  and have a better meal on my back porch"}
{"text":"Fabulous food.  Best salmon I ever had.  The seafood sampler appetizer was wonderful.  You can't go wrong with anything on this menu.  They say that fish is flown in on a daily basis with I can believe!"}
{"text":"Beautiful view, quality service and delicious food!!!! My husband had salmon and I had stripped bass. The dessert was amazing...angel cake with cream cheese filling,caramelized almonds,fruit compote and vanilla ice cream on top."}
{"text":"I ventured here craving some fine dining fare. The elevator up offers very nice views of the city. The restaurant has a very chic ambiance and again offers beautiful views of the city. Since seating was booked I sat at the sushi bar, which offered full service. I ordered the Lobster Tail. I am probably going to come off as being very particular here but given the class of restaurant I suppose it's warranted. When I received my plate, it was placed by the edge of the counter very close to my lap, and the Madeira sauce was on the side of the plate towards the edge making it possible for the sauce to spill onto my lap. Also, the crab stuffing fell off the lobster slightly ruining the presentation. In any case, the dish was delicious and hit the spot. 

Looking at all the sushi forced me to cave in and order the Unagi Nigiri (eel sushi), which was also very good. For dessert I ordered the the mini chocolate guava roulades which was splendid. I loved how the mint leaves went with it. The service was very good and the manager came down to check on me and see how I was doing.

All in all, I very much enjoyed my meal and although I did not get to enjoy the view from my seat I'd say it was worth the price. When you do pay that price however, I do feel the criticisms are warranted, but this really did not detract much from the overall satisfaction of the meal and experience and thus stand as opportunities for improvement. That said, I'm glad I got to come here and enjoy this fine dining experience."}
{"text":"So my little brother graduated from Carnegie Melon this year and we booked a reservation here for afterwards.  Being my first time in Pittsburgh I was pretty excited to eat what my brother had chosen for his graduation dinner.  He later told me it was mostly for the view, he had never actually been there.  When we get to the place we start to park in the lot and the valet guy comes up to the car and tells us we have to check in at the valet in front of the restaurant.  We tried giving him our keys there but he told us to turn around and go back up front so as we did we see him running behind us to meet us at the front of the restaurant where he proceeded to then take our keys.  I guess he just wanted a quick sprint? lol.  

Pittsburgh is DAMN COLD.  It was supposed to be sunny out, but it starts snowing during the graduation in May! For this reason, after we took the elevator \"All the way up\" (cue music), we opted to keep our coats instead of checking them in.  That lasted about 5 minutes, as the restaurant was nice and cozy, and we quickly got warm....What a view!!!! We were seated right away and pretty close to the window.  It had stopped raining and a rainbow had come out over the water.  Very beautiful.  

I'm not big on cooked fish, I prefer my fish raw, but I opted for the Barramundi, which the waitress said was one of their specials that day.  It came with soup or salad so I asked for Lobster Bisque.  That Lobster Bisque and the angel food grilled cheese for dessert (more on that later) really stole the show for me.  All of the food was delicious, I had a little bit of fish off everyone's plate just to try out the flavors, but I don't think I'd be willing to pay that much money to eat those dishes again.  The crab cakes were definitely another highlight, and that's saying something because I don't usually enjoy crab cake, but again I'm not sure I would dish out the money to eat it again.  The flavor of the dessert, on the other hand, was completely unexpected, in a good way.  I would come back here just for the dessert and some coffee.  Not wine though, because each bottle of wine is ridiculously expensive.  My aunt said we were paying about $70 for a bottle of wine she had seen on a shelf at Albertsons in California for about $15 (not sure if she's right though).  But what the heck, we were celebrating my brothers graduation! So bring on 2 more bottles of wine!

All in all the food is good and the view is great.  The staff is very friendly and attentive.  This restaurant is extremely expensive, but you are paying for the atmosphere and it doesn't hurt to try it at least once."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. Delicious food and the best views of Pittsburgh. Exceptional and friendly service. Upscale and relaxing atmosphere. Great venue for an intimate wedding or special event. Also a perfect place for a romantic dinner."}
{"text":"Food's decent. The view is spectacular of Pittsburgh's downtown. They have a nice bar, in case there's a wait. For some reason, it seems to attract a 70+ year old crowd. But it's still a great dining experience."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a big night out or a celebration this is the place you need to go.  Took a date here that was her first time in Pittsburgh and was blown away! Chad our server was excellent and the food was phenomenal...there's plenty of fine dining around Pittsburgh but Monterey is hands down the best.  Also a great spot to stop for a drink/appetizer before or after a night out in the lounge.  Can't wait for the sushi bar after the renovation!!!"}
{"text":"Outstanding View, Great Food, Great Service !  MBFG did not disappoint.  Yes, it is pricey.  For special occasions or just a great night out with a fancy dinner it's worth it."}
{"text":"We decided on this restaurant for dinner for our family which included 4 young kids. We were able to get reservations at the last minute for 6:00 on a Friday night since we didn't think we were going to be in the city for dinner time. We were just coming from the Duquesne incline, and it's only a quick 5 minute walk from there. We noticed a lot of people were dressed up for dinner, while we had on casual clothes which was completely fine as we noticed later on as more people came in. They gave us a corner table right by the window, which completely surprised us since we didn't even think to ask and it gave us an amazing view of the city! The staff was very welcoming and helpful during our entire dinner! The food is delicious and they had a good kids menu to select from! We don't take our kids out to dinner often, but when we do they know it's a treat and they know how to behave! It is more of a fancy type of restaurant, so I would say if you have younger kids, only take them if they are well behaved. I highly recommend this restaurant when in the city!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has an UNBELIEVABLE view of Pittsburgh. The service is professional, courteous and friendly. However, the food is just average and detracts from this being an incredible experience. I had the Lemon Sole and it was dry and definitely not fresh. My companion had the Chilean Sea Bass and it was just OK--nothing special for a \"capstone\" evening. If you do go--make your reservations well ahead of time."}
{"text":"This review is from Dennis.  My wife will have to review when I make a special trip to take her to this restaurant (no small feat considering we live in Wisconsin!)

The view, service and food were all exceptional.  My waiter, Mark, was friendly and helpful.  I was dressed in jeans and work boots, but that didn't seem to matter (maybe to the other patrons who were dressed in suits it did).  I was told to expect high prices by a business associate, so I was prepared for the sticker shock. I had an appetizer sampler platter of a crab cake, sword fish, seared tuna, and salmon, cooked to perfection and just the right balance of a glazed sauce.  The crab cake was not like a traditional crab cake, with more \"cake\" (filling) than crab. Hard to find ANY filling as it was mainly crab.  Best that I have had.  The presentation of the appetizers and main meal (scallops) was also perfect. 

You should figure spending close to $100 per person for an appetizer, meal, drink and tip.  If it comes in less than that, consider yourself lucky.  Personally, I thought it was worth every penny."}
{"text":"Very fancy and the dining room makes it have a very nice atmosphere. The view of Pittsburgh is beautiful and the steak I got for dinner was one of the best I've had in a long time!!"}
{"text":"Our large party got a great table with views but I think all the tables have views!
Service was dead on as we were offered drinks immediately upon seating. Perusing the menu I thought to myself that I had not seen a menu with that many fish options in a long time. It was hard to decide!!
I had the oysters as an appetizer and then the ahi tuna from Hawaii prepared sashimi style as my main. Wow. Everything was so fresh. I would get it again! The desserts are a blur now in my memory but you can't go wrong. They were all good and disappeared quickly ."}
{"text":"We booked our reservation seamlessly through OpenTable same day.  When we arrived on a Monday night, there were plenty of window seats available to take advantage of the awesome city view!  Our waitress greeted us immediately with a kind and courteous demeanor.  Since it was my hubs birthday, I ordered him Oysters on the half shell, which he devoured. He also chased them with a Mojito. For our entrees, we ordered the Swordfish, which was tender, moist and devine. We also ordered the Jumbo Sea Scallops, which were okay, but we prefer them grilled. We ordered the Jumbo Shrimp that was stuffed with the signature crab cake, along with the shareable Lobster and Crab Mac & Cheese. Of all the entrees, we both really enjoyed the Swordfish the most.  The Lobster and Crab Mac & Cheese was decadent, full of cream and not enough cheese in my opinion, but good nonetheless.  Overall, the dinner was good, the view was spectacular, and the price is high as usual! I thought that I heard they didn't have the angel food grilled cheese sandwich dessert and I really wanted to try it, but other than that we really enjoyed the evening."}
{"text":"Monterrey bay is delicious! One of my absolute favorite restaurants. It is a little on the expensive side, but the view and food are absolutely worth it. Monterrey bay is the real deal and certainly a 5 star restaurant. The crab bisque is the best I've ever had. All the seafood is fresh, and the staff is incredible and very attentive. They will even allow you to bring your own bottle of wine for a small cork fee rather than ordering one from the menu. One of my favorite things is riding the elevator up to the top because it is glass and you get a great view of the city! If you haven't checked out Monterrey bay yet, it's a MUST!"}
{"text":"On a recent trip to I Pittsburgh happened to pick this particular restaurant because it was rated as one of the 5 best in the city for views. Otherwise, I'm pretty sure I wouldn't be looking for seafood in Pitts burg. Anyway, parked at the bottom of the Incline and rode that to the the top which was very nice. The walk to the restaurant was then maybe 3-4 minutes. Valet parking at the door was a reasonable 5 bucks but I was glad we rode the incline. After an unassuming elevator ride to the top of the building, I was amazed at what an absolutely awesome view this establishment had of the city! Almost every seat had a nice view as well. Since window seats could not be reserved we chose to be seated rather than wait it out and ended up in some descent seats that allowed an excellent view. The menu was quite extensive, the waitress extremely pleasant and efficient. Shortly after we sat down the manager stopped by for some glad handing as well. (nice touch). OK for the meal: First of all the wine list was excellent albeit pricey. We chose wine by the glass that was expensive (but very good) and quite honestly the pour was disappointing. They used the old trick of a small glass. This ended up setting the tone for a pretty much lackluster culinary night. We had the ahi tuna sashimi for an appetizer and french onion soup. The tuna was above average and the soup was excellent with just the right amount of cognac. Main course was Salmon and Halibut. Both portions were really small, very expensive, and just average in flavor, consistency, freshness and preparation. I asked for the Halibut to be a little on the dry side and it was no where near that. A side of asparagus was fresh and tasty. Finished the meal off with an incredible chocolate mousse cake and in the middle of desert there was an amazing fireworks display on the river just next to PNC park. Very cool! All in all this was just average food and below average portions at an above average price with a killer view. I loved the ambiance of the place. I guess I'd reserve this place for that occasional special event. I don't mind one bit paying for an expensive meal if it comes through. This didn't.  Again, not bad, but just between Meh average and OK, so I upped it to 3 stars because of the fireworks display! Looking at the other ratings, I honestly feel a 5 star rating is insanity! Go for the view!"}
{"text":"Ohhh what's happened here? Stopped in for a bite and a cocktail. Saw the restaurant was dead, so I said why not! Service was great but the food not good. Cocktail was tiny and bland! I am so disappointed. I won't be stopping here anymore :("}
{"text":"My friend did a little research on the city before we headed out to find grub. Grandview had several highly rated restaurants so we headed that way. First, the view on Grandview is beautiful! Regardless of the place you chose to eat at you will be blessed with a postcard worthy shot of the city. FYI - Directly across from the restaurant there's a little place with a historic write up and place to just sit and survey the city.
Honestly I wasn't sure what to expect from the outside. It looked simply like an generic restaurant on an older hotel but we opted to go inside. The restaurant is at the top of the hotel. At street level there is a gorgeous view, so needless to say going up several more floors you are provided with an even more amazing view of the city. The main dining room was booked up so we ended up eating at the bar which was below the main dining room. The bar isn't as pretty as the dining room but we had a table right next to the window (something you can't generally get in the main dining room). The atmosphere was rather intimate - it was quiet and dimly lit - which was really nice. We were able to just relax, talk and take in that beautiful view. The service was excellent - our waitress left us alone but the minute I even thought I might want something she seemed to sense it and magically appeared. I ordered the salmon with the strawberry preparation. Again, I didn't know what to expect but the idea of strawberries paired with salmon intrigued me....... It was phenomenal!!!  I'm not sure how to describe it - the sauce was not sweet, nor did it taste especially like strawberries but it was incredibly yummy. My friend got this scallop and shrimp Alfredo pasta dish - the flavor was incredibly light. Most Alfredo dishes are so heavy and rich but this dish had a delicate flavor - not overwhelming - and the pasta was also this ruffled ribbon-like pasta instead of the traditional fettuccine. The prices are a little hefty ($30 for my salmon which just a fish and sauce) but the view, service and intriguing preparations really elevate this restaurant to that higher standard where I felt okay paying that much. I will be sure to come back during my future visits - even if it's just for a cocktail in the bar."}
{"text":"Can I move in here?

Bobby surprised me last weekend and took me out to dinner on Saturday night. We made reservations and we got right in and seated. The service was lovely and the dinner was wonderful.

Unlike so many other places on Mount Washington where you just climb a set of stairs to have a second floor view of the city, at Monterey Bay Fish Grotto you actually get in an elevator and go WAY up. The views are beautiful!

Once inside the restaurant, you are greeted by a very friendly person who has the waitstaff escort you immediately to your table.

FI and I split the calamari. FI isn't a big seafood fan (I know, I know) but he took me here because he knows that I love seafood! I couldn't believe it but he actually really enjoyed the calamari!

After that, I ordered one of the specials of the night -- Chilean sea bass that came with butternut squash and some kind of tomato risotto. It was AMAZING! Seriously so so good.

As if things couldn't get any better, I ordered the angel food grilled cheese for dessert. It sounds weird, but believe me when I tell you this was seriously up there with the best desserts I've ever eaten (and I've consumed many, many desserts). Honestly, if I were to choose my last dessert on earth, it might be this.

Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"What a joke. My boyfriend made our reservations for us on Valentines Day because it's one of my favorite restaurants. Today I get a call asking about my confirmation for our reservation tomorrow. TOMORROW?? No I don't need reservations for tomorrow I needed it for Valentine's Day. This is why we purposely reserved a month in advance so we wouldn't be in this situation. When I called all they could say is we can't help you there's no more redactions for that day. Well obviously because we're a week before Valentine's Day and every other place I had in mind is booked too. So I just want to say thank you for screwing me over and make sure you check the dates when you book!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is a must for all looking for a great meal in Pittsburgh. As a tourist, it is the perfect experience: exceptional view (you can go up the Dusquene Incline and being on Mount Washington you can see the three rivers of Pittsburgh), excellent food (fresh fish flown in daily), romantic atmosphere, and great service (attentive and friendly). Of course, this comes with a premium price, but worth the splurge on a special night out.

It is difficult to get a table during peak hours (especially on weekends), so I definitely recommend booking a reservation through OpenTable - which was hassle free. Ask for a table near the window upon arrival for a better view.

Although pricy, I found that the entree was filling enough to skip out on the appetizers. We tried the lobster bisque, it was quite good but a tad saltier than I would of liked, but have a strong lobster flavor to it.

What you MUST order: the dish that was the biggest hit was the MARYLAND CRAB CAKES. Probably the best I have eaten. Absolutely delicious. Second place goes to the grilled scallops - not the most flavorful I have eaten but you get 5 large pieces so it seems worth it. 

By popular demand, I got the Chilean Sea Bass in Caribbean - it was good/buttery/prepared well but didn't really wow me for some reason. Personally thought the sauce was really good and does 'wet' my appetite, but overwhelmed the 'natural' taste of the fish. Yellow fin tuna was also ordered - unfortunately not my favourite as it had a steak-y taste and texture to it.

If you haven't been to Pittsburgh, I suggest this on your bucketlist."}
{"text":"Make sure you sit downstairs. Upstairs is fine, but ambiance downstairs is 100 % better. Preferably a seat on the far left, view overlooks the lovely Pittsburgh downtown skyline. Service was great. I did enjoy the swordfish. Shrimp appetizer was not bad. Food a little cookie cutter boring."}
{"text":"In Pitts for the first time and had an overall amazing experience here.The staff was awesome and the server was extremely knowledgeable (had dinner there with my dad who has alot of food allergies). There were so many good items to choose from that I found it hard to decide. Started off with the wedge salad which had pickled red onions, smoked blue cheese and sriracha red peppers which was perfect combination of flavors. Ended up getting the lobster tail for dinner and it came with a generous amount of crab cake stuffing. It was extremely delicious. Had a seat by the window and the view was out of this world. Vanilla spice creme br√ªl√©e was phenomenal! Would definitely come here again next time I'm in town"}
{"text":"As anyone who reads my reviews knows, I do not care for seafood.  But, on occasion, I find myself at a seafood restaurant and am usually OK with that because a lot of seafood places, at least the good ones, have alternatives to seafood for those diners who don't love it.  Like me.

We came here as part of a party, celebrating my sister-in-law's birthday- she and her fiancee (and most of the party-goers) hail from Morgantown, WV but apparently this place is so good as to warrant a 1.5 hour (one-way) road trip to experience.  In retrospect, it was worth it.

At first look, I got the impression that this wasn't going to be some ordinary restaurant.  It sits high above Three Rivers with a gorgeous view of downtown Pittsburgh- which was the first I'd ever seen of it, having never been to Pittsburgh before.  At night, it is positively beautiful, all lit up like cities usually are.  The restaurant itself is on the top floor(s) of a building sitting above the riverfront, access is past a guard's desk and onto the elevator.

Once the doors opened, you are treated to a frontal view of the restaurant, the hostess is right there.  The restaurant is multi-level; the upper level is the main dining area, with floor-to-ceiling windows offering a marvelous view of the waterfront.  There were tables of all sizes, we were sat at a long table close to those front windows.  The lower area appear to be private dining rooms, the rest room is also located down a flight of stairs just behind the hostess area.

Everyone working there was very polite, friendly and professional.  Wait staff were eager- from recommendations on food to the intricacies of the special cocktails offered from the bar, all requests were handled good-naturedly and with aplomb.

We started off with a round of drinks and a few appetizers, none of which I ate as they were all of the sea-variety.  Or cheesy.  The knight doesn't like cheese, either.  But I digress...

As luck would have it, they had a couple of steaks on the menu, so I opted for the filet.  As far as I'm concerned, every steak I eat is considered against the fine cuts at Stoney River in Annapolis, and with that in mind I will say this- it was a good steak.  Really good; tender, juicy - some places don't believe in seasoning meat and this is one of those places.  I like my steaks seasoned and seared, but that's just personal preference.  It was better than some I've had in other so-called steakhouses and that's saying quite a bit for a place that specializes in fresh seafood.  I ordered fried potatoes and a salad with my entree and I know I should've paid more attention to what the other diners had but, well, it was a party so I may not have been at my most...observant.  Everything that came out was attractive, plated to please the eye, not just the stomach and everyone raved about their food so I assume it was quite good.  Few if any doggie bags to return with us.  

We pretty much closed the place as we were a little late arriving to begin with; the staff remained courteous and friendly and saw us onto the elevator.  The security guards looked ready to go but wished us a good evening nonetheless.  The party bus pulled up and we were on our way back to WV, sated and satisfied.

While I don't see me traveling to Pittsburgh for any reason on my own, if I did- I'd probably look to dine here again.  It isn't a cheap, or budget-friendly restaurant by any stretch of the imagination but you do get what you pay for.  For seafood lovers, it is worth at least one visit!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I have never been here before but this is perennially one of Pittsburgh's best and brightest spots for a romantic evening. We were certainly not disappointed! (Valentine's Date) 

Valet: Quick and easy, high quality finishes in the lobby, well dressed staff (matching winter attire at the time). Nice backlit accents on the walls/elevator. 

Entrance: Beautiful introduction into the venue, vast views into the dining space, high quality finishes throughout. Coat check is quick and easy. Table was immediately ready at the allotted time. I was treated like a VIP, with respect and professionalism. 

Waiter: Professional with a touch of over-enthusiasm which is okay, talked extensively about specials and preferred choices. Again obviously rehearsed but still appreciated. Consistently checked on refills and if we needed anything. Wasn't obtrusive, perfectly balanced. 

Food: 5-star all the way, Crab bisque that I still can't stop talking about, beautiful sea scallops. Everything was top quality and tasted incredible. Ambiance: The pi√®ce de r√©sistance, the famed few of the city of Pittsburgh. Beautiful unobstructed views of the city at night through crystal clear floor-to-ceiling windows. We were seated one table away from the windows which was highly appreciated. 

An absolute must in the city of Pittsburgh, we eagerly await our second visit!"}
{"text":"Food is amazing and service is personal--received free desert for Valentine's Day :D will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time back in November while staying in town with a friend. First let me just say this place doesn't look like it was gonna have the ambiance it had. You first pull up looks like your going into a hotel but it's just a lil lobby where they come out to valet your car. Then you get on an elevator to go up that is windowed so u can see the view outside,(was so not expecting that),  you walk in and give your reservation and then are seated. The restaurant is surround by windows. What a view. We wanted to be seat near the windows, however, there was no opening,  but it was fine we had a great lil booth and still had a good view of the city. 
The food there  was amazing. I had sea bass and we also had a couple of appetizers. Which I was so caught up in my food and company and atmosphere I forgot to take pictures.. First date I didn't want to send back!.. Lol (you'd understand if you have read some of my other reviews.. Lol) Everything here was so good.  And the staff were nice and informative.
If I am ever in Pittsburgh again I would definitely come back! But make sure you have $$$ cause it ain't cheap!"}
{"text":"My sweet loving partner took me here for my graduation day celebrating 5 long agonizingly splendid years of college. I thought the elevator up was so very cool mind you I was scared of heights. We arrived mid-afternoon it was a pretty muggy day, the VIEW was still astounding and the interior was fancy looking at first. There were large awkward shaped pillars in the centers on the room holding everything up most likely. They didn't fool anyone by painting them like \"trees\" lol it looked silly and didn't fit well with their up-scale approach. The view is simply breathtaking and I can only imagine what it looked like at night. Its definitely romantic and fancy yet the servers are lacking skill. They aren't keen on refilling water I had to keep stealing my dates lol. They did bring out a glass of champagne because of circumstance I reminded them. They didn't have a good draft selection which baffled me, I would have thought they would have a nice selection of seasonal light beer to pair with their \"fish grotto\" dishes, MILLER LITE it is! Anyways, lets get down to business. We order fried calamari which was frigging awesome if I do remember correctly. I was expecting my thrill to follow suit on through with the dinner, I was thoroughly disappointed however. So both my other half and I order and filet with mash and baby whole potatoes. The meat for lack of better words was a \"chode\" LOL, it was the smallest steak ever, no bigger then a meat ball maybe 2 bites max. The meat size I could have gotten past if it were a delicious savory hunk of tender goodness, BUT Hell no it was like watching DORA the explorer trying to navigate around chunks of fatty tissue and Grissel. I guess this is what i get for ordering a steak at a \"fish grotto.\" Well you ask how are the sides? What goes better with a chode than a piping bag full of garbage pureed mash, eh. They were aiming for new york up-scale and hit mediocre home made at best. There was no flare, no taste nothing but disappointment. I really loved the ambiance of this place the only thing its missing is the food that FITS THE PART. Everything is upscale but my palette was yearning for MORE THAN they could offer us. Don't be fooled that sky-high atmosphere and encapsulating glass 360 view comes with a skyrocketing check. We paid a whooping 170.00-180.00 for the bill our ending balance for my special graduation escapade 600.00 but would have been much less if we ate elsewhere....Thanks for the read try le-mont same price bigger steaks :)"}
{"text":"This place could be good if they were not so cheap on delivery. The food had good flavor, but there was not enough for the price. When you spend $35 on Chilean sea bass, you expect a large portion if there are no sides. If everything is to be √† la carte, the entree has to be a reasonable size for the price. My sea bass should have been $15 for the quality and portion. Oysters Rockefeller was basically spinach dip with oyster flavor because the oysters were no bigger than an M&M. The drinks were good, though their bar is a little short, being that this is supposed to be upscale. I asked for a Hendricks gin martini and they didn't have anything but the basics.

Don't get me wrong, the food tasted good, but $150 dinner for 2, we should not walk away hungry and unwilling to take a risk on dessert being disappointing as well. For the price, I'd rather go to Sonoma Grill downtown."}
{"text":"As a disclaimer:  I never, ever, ever write reviews.  However, this place gave me the inclination  to make a Yelp account so I could do so. 

My boyfriend and I were in Pittsburgh just for fun, as we live a few hours away and just wanted to explore.   I looked at restaurants that would give us a nice view of Pittsburgh, and this place came up.  I believe when I made the reservation it said to ask for a view when I got there.

But I didn't need to. The hostess took us to a corner table with an incredible view of the city.  It was then I knew this dinner was going to kick ass.  The smell of seafood on the way to our table was more intoxicating than we had planned on getting that evening.  We started off with a succulent bottle of Amarone.  Most of their wine list are wines from the U.S., but I personally like to get down with the Italians.  Our appetizers were oysters on the half shell and seared Kobe; which the only complaint that I have is that they didn't just keep bringing to the table until we told them to stop.  Then we split the crab soup, which my boyfriend and I harassed our server about getting us the recipe because it was- The. Best. Soup. Ever.  For our entrees he had rockfish prepared the Thai peanut way and I had Caribbean Sea Bass. Both of us took the first bite and our legs went numb.  It was that weird erotic satisfaction only perfectly prepared delicious food can give you - that almost sexual satisfaction where nothing in the world matters except for the next bite, which you are almost afraid to have because you don't want the food to go away.  Both of us were fat and happy by the end of this, but we couldn't stop there. Dessert?  When in Rome... Or something.  Why can't they have a sampler of all of the desserts?  Sighhhhhh... Oh well.  We decided on sharing the Banana Foster cheesecake. Holy Moses was it delicious.  It made you forget about all the other food you just stuffed in your belly and focus on the magical piece of cheesecake in front of you. Neither of us could remember a more satisfying meal.  Maybe we both have the same taste in food, but it ruined the rest of our night because although the night had just begun, nothing was going to top this meal.

As for the service, I believe our server's name was Jane.  She was incredibly appropriate and wonderful.  She was knowledgeable not just about the menu, but about Pittsburgh itself, and really just was perfectly pleasant in every way. The entire staff seemed happy and like they wanted to be there.  

Thanks Monterey Bay!"}
{"text":"I came here for a pre-interview dinner, so I didn't pay for it. The food was really underwhelming, the view in the private room was very nice though. I had the house salad and ~50% of the lettuce was either frozen or obviously just thawed. I've never had this situation at a restaurant before and hope to never again. My entree was the yellow fin tuna which was supposed to be \"sushi grade\". The fish was under-seasoned and had the mushy texture of sashimi that's past its prime. The other sides on the plate could've come out of a home kitchen (in the sense that they were ordinary, not homey or comforting). I would eat there again for free but would never pay for it. This caliber of food would never fly at a \"fine-dining\" restaurant in any other metropolitan city I've lived in."}
{"text":"I would give this place 5 stars for the view and ambiance, 4 stars for the food which was absolutely fantastic.  I came here for my birthday and was absolutely \"wowed\" by the expansive views of the city and the chic environment.  I had only been in Pittsburgh for a couple of weeks by this point, so it was a perfect way to introduce me to the city.  The food was great and high quality, but the real highlight of this place is the location.  Definitely come here with someone you'd like to impress, its a scene to be seen."}
{"text":"This is one of the few places that has a great view of Pittsburgh AND great food.  We had drinks in the bar downstairs before dinner and I was shocked at how affordable the cocktails were.  A Manhattan was only $6.50!  And with that view...that's a bargain.  The smoked salmon appetizer was outstanding.  I ordered Parmesan crusted mahi mahi and asked the server if the chef would add capers to it.  They gladly accommodated my request, and I appreciated that!  My Dad had the lobster.  He said it was great.  I rarely order rice pilaf but much to my surprise it was delicious.  Service was great.  I will go back.  Our total tab before tip (for 2) was $132."}
{"text":"Somewhere between 3 and 4 stars. 

This is one of the best locations, if not simply the best, for a restaurant in Pittsburgh, and if you are lucky to be close enough from a window (as we were), you will impress your dinner guests! Now, not all tables are close to the windows, and some tables don't benefit from the view at all. I wonder how people are assigned to tables.

The food is based on fish, and the menu is impressive, with a beautiful list of fish. We had various fish dishes, but the clear winner was the sea bass (with pineapple - usually I am not a fan of pineapple in my food, but this dish was very successful). The other fish were good, but not nearly as tasty. Some were a bit bland. The risotto was good, the lobster mac and cheese not impressive.

The desserts are decadent - in a good and bad way. They are really very sweet and heavy, too much for the taste of our table. I'd recommend to share a few (we had 3 for 5, and this was too much, including angel food grilled cheese sandwich and macadamia mousse). 

Overall, the food was decent, but the prices - very high for Pittsburgh - call for something better and more interesting. Too many fish dishes were good, but a bit bland.

Finally, our waiter was terrible. She pushed to consumption, insisting that we take some appetizers; she lost track of our bottle, and pretended it was empty, while we had only drank half of it; she put water on one of us..."}
{"text":"I just went here for the first time in about 5 years for NYE and I was very impressed.  The food was delicious.  We had the crab cake appetizer, french onion soup, the salmon with strawberry sauce, macadamia encrusted halibut, and the white chocolate macadamia mousse.  Everything we ordered was perfection...there wasn't a single thing that we didn't like!  On top of the delicious food, the service was top-notch.  Even on a busy holiday evening, we were seated on-time and the server was very attentive and friendly.  I think this place is well worth what you pay for and I will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"This was a very cool place to go. First To get to the restaurant we took a cab to the bottom of the Duquesne Incline and rode It to the top the views were incredible!! It's then a very short 2 min walk up a hill to the restaurant. We had reservations so we were seated immediately! The views were just as amazing in the restaurant. My gf and I wanted to buy a bottle of wine but we weren't  sure what kind we wanted and did not want to waste money on something we did not like considering most of the bottles are some what expensive. So we asked are waiter and he sent his manager right over. the manager was very nice he let us sample 3 different wines before we made up are minds up. We then ordered our food which was excellent!! We were very happy with choosing this restaurant. You won't regret going here if you choose to"}
{"text":"Very upscale treatment.  Fresh, Well Executed  food. 

Steaks that are so tender and juicy and well seasoned. Seafood that tastes so fresh and decadent. Side dishes that were made to perfection.

Classic favorites with all the fixings you would expect or want.

We were on a business trip and they even accommodated separate checks.....

The view is incomparable!! Definitely will be returning here when I come back to Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Loved it all the food was fantastic the view magical the service outstanding the cocktails perfect"}
{"text":"We had a party of five dine there last evening.  Although very expensive and most entrees are ala carte, everything was delicious!  The wait staff was attentive and with an outstanding Mt. Washington view it was amazing!  We will certainly return to dine again, but probably with a smaller party.  I would also set a reservation for around 7:30pm so as to be able to enjoy the evening city view lights."}
{"text":"Traveled via cab to this new restaurant for all of us. Our reservation was for four, but six of us arrived. The restaurant quickly and politely seated us at a lovely large round table, allowing for excellent conversation. Service was excellent all night. The menu is a great mix of meals. All six of us ordered different meals and everyone was very pleased. My meal was large, stuffed scallops and spinach salad. The salad was excellent. The scallops were very good. The wine list is broad and with a nice mix of wines from OK to excellent wines. The pricing is aggressive. Wines are over priced, by any comparison. The foods were expensive, but this becomes more subjective. My meal was very good. It was very expensive. 

In addition to my meal, I sampled some corn side dish. It was excellent. 

This is a place that I would return to, but only for very special occasions. 

I am giving only four stars because the prices seemed too high, especially for the wines."}
{"text":"Came here with a couple of my colleagues while we were on business travel and this place was highly recommended. We all had the most amazing crab cakes chock full of real crabmeat and not a lot of filler. The Chilean Sea Bass was perfectly cooked and delicious! The 360 degree view was also amazing! The restaurant is on a hill overlooking the 3 rivers that intersect. Can't wait to go back one day !!"}
{"text":"Went here with a group of folks for dinner, and we all enjoyed it.  I had the Copper River Salmon since it was in season, and it was cooked very well (medium rare).  It was served with the sweet potato polenta which I enjoyed as well.

I can't wait to try it out again, they had a great selection of seafood - definitely recommend trying this place out!

And in case you care, the bread served was delicious!  Jalepeno biscuits and some other types of bread...  Our carb conscious diners ended up eating some as well because it was just that good.  ;)"}
{"text":"Holy smokes, what a great view of the city! The selection of seafood is exceptional, and my swordfish dish was delicious. The food prices are expensive, but in line with what you would expect to pay for high end seafood. The prices for wine are another story. It's a nice wine list for sure, but the wine prices are just over the top. The majority of bottles on the list are over $100 per bottle. Most seem to be priced at 3-4x retail. For example, we paid $75 for a (nice) bottle of California Chardonnay that you can find in a liquor store for $20-24.

One other complaint. Having a glass elevator with a view of the city is a nice touch. But you might want to consider washing the glass...it's pretty dirty."}
{"text":"If you are looking for fresh seafood and great service, look no further. 

Appetizer: combo platter... ask for it.  It will set the stage for a wonderful meal. Comes with crab cake, several small tastes of grilled varied fish, and a couple of Cajun grilled shrimp. Superb. 

Main meal: I had scrod, Monterey topping. Very fresh, light fish and the combination of olives, artichokes, tomato, mushrooms was a great addition to the mild fish. Husband had crab cakes and swears they are the best he's ever had. Big chunks of flavorful crab meat with remoulade.  Yummy, yummy. Side dishes are served family style and one is enough for two people. 

Extensive wine and drinks menu. Very enjoyable evening, killer views, and delicious seafood worth every penny. Don't pass it up if you get the chance to go here"}
{"text":"Food, 2 stars, let's be honest, one can't break the good food with a great view paradox.

5 stars for the view.

Round the average for the view.

Just go for the view people."}
{"text":"Note:  One star is for the view (at the location overlooking the city).  Thus the food only gets one star.

My husband and I dined at Monterey Bay on a recent trip to Pittsburgh to see family.  Though I wouldn't have chosen Monterey Bay myself after reading online reviews, I was happy to be at the restaurant to enjoy the view.  The welcome by the staff and the ambiance at the restaurant are a great way to start a meal.  Unfortunately, it was all down hill from there.  Our meals lacked creativity and balance, but they were abundant in salt.   Even the butter for the bread was salted almost too much!   I had a special soup- it was way too mushroom-y and almost inedible because of the salt content. Another person had shrimp scampi; it was a pound of pasta and about 6-8 shrimp.  It was tasty, but totally unbalanced.   As a meal I had an appetizer- the Tuna Sashimi.  Though I'm sure the fish was fresh, it was too \"chewy\" and unappealing.  I was not impressed.  My husband's meal- also an appetizer- was also too salty and totally uninteresting.  The prices are outlandish given the quality of the food.  I would never go back here!!

Go for the view, not the food!"}
{"text":"Highly recommend! The food is delicious, service is outstanding, and the view is gorgeous. The Jumbo Shrimp and Ichiban appetizer were delicious! We went for my boyfriend's birthday and it was a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"Review is for dessert only! We were contemplating dinner here, but chose another restaurant down the street. We heard about the fabulous desserts & view at Monterey Bay so decided to check it out. We ended up here about 30 minutes before close & knew we had to try the angel food grilled cheese (we didn't even look at the menu so not sure if that's what it is truly called, but our server knew).
The dessert was fantastic! Light, but sweet, with a little bit of tartness from the berries! Perfect!"}
{"text":"The only reason I am not giving this five stars is that my scallops were really gritty!  This is an amazing restaurant for the total experience. The service, food, and view are all fantastic. This is our \"go to\" place for special occasions. Everything else we ordered was wonderful. The total evening was wonderful. I didn't complain about the scallops while there because I didn't want to take away from the night. I didn't eat most of the scallops and brought them home. Just ate them for lunch and remembered why I didn't eat them last night. My advice is go with the crab cakes and skip the scallops."}
{"text":"Fantastic views, Great food, and Great service. I'd say it was one of the top 3 restaurant experiences in my life.
I had the Chilean Sea Bass and my wife had the Parmesan Crusted Halibut. We had Lobster Rangoon's as an appetizer. Food was hot and cooked perfectly, just delicious.
Holly was our server, and she was great: friendly, helpful with the menu and casino directions :)    She also took a few pictures and brought us a free dessert for our Anniversary. Never had better service.
And the view from Grandview Ave is great, but the restaurant is 10 floors above that, just awesome."}
{"text":"The food is very good. I wasn't particularity thrilled with my fish, because I like a little lighter fish, but the mixture it was cooked in, Monterey style, was delicious. And my friend's fish was quite good, along with the Caribbean style. The appetizer platter was fabulous, and I now understand why they are known for their crab cakes. The service was fabulous! April, our waitress, along with another gentleman that serviced our table, were very patient and kind with all of our needs. 
And the view.... Wow."}
{"text":"Wow. They have so many options (if you like seafood which i do!) 

The menu of specials was overwhelming as well. The server rattled on for like 15 minutes about the specials which was impressive. 

I am a scallop fan so I went with the crab stuffed scallops.  I was so overwhelmed by all of the fish options that I couldn't make up my mind.  The entree was delicious my only gripe is with the soup I ordered.  The server described the soup as a lobster butternut squash....sounds interesting and delicious. Unfortunately the soup was a overly sweet pumpkin puree.  I love soup but neither my sister or I could stomach it. 


Obviously, the views are incredible but the interior seemed a little cheesy for a $30+ entree place.  Fake palm trees? hmm... 

Pros: huge seafood menu, full bar, tasty bread, gorgeous views, actually kid friendly (for my nephew) 

Cons: poor soup description, cheesy interior, a la carte vegetables, pricey but you are paying for the view. 

Overall: I will be back for another special occasion!"}
{"text":"(11/11/2014)  Stopped in for dessert (amazing pastry chef) and the view.  Sat in the lounge by the windows and enjoyed the views from dizzying height with addition of some dizzying cocktails.  Drink specialties are desserts in themselves, but got the Angel Food Grilled Cheese Sandwich.  Bruleed slices of angel food (torched for sure) with a schmear of sweetened cream cheese and served with vanilla ice cream fresh berries in a puddle of berry coulis, so, so, good.  

Place has a little bit of a leftover 80s hangover vibe to it (Bladerunner-style ambient music, vibrant \"underwater\" graphic decor, zigzag martini glasses, Cyndi Lauper called and she wants her sweater back, she bop) even though the Pittsburgh location has only been open since 1996.  It's a lovely date night for first Match dates and dinner before the prom.  Service was very friendly and attentive.  It was a great way to end the night."}
{"text":"Our Valentine's Day dinner was wonderful. Great service, atmosphere and we were surprised we got a great window side table . Perfect romantic date spot."}
{"text":"We were visiting Pittsburgh and this restaurant was next to Duquesne Incline. We wanted to eat somewhere near the incline and there are a lot of options and Monterey Bay Fish Grotto seem like the perfect choice. We made reservations. When we arrived we had to take the elevator to the top floor. The elevator was a little slow. We were seated by the window that offered an amazing view of the city. The menu offered so many different types of fish. Finally we narrow it down and decided with the hawaii opah blackened Cajun and hawaii walu Caribbean. The blacken Cajun opah had a smoky taste and the texture of the fish was more rough. The Caribbean walu had a fruity taste and a much softer texture. Both fish were good but if I had to choose one, I would go with the Caribbean walu. I really enjoyed my meal here and it makes a great place for pictures as well."}
{"text":"Incredibly flavorful seafood where you can get real anchovies on your Caesar salad!!  Professional service you'd expect from the best restaurants is so refreshing from what your accustomed to. A beautiful dining room with a fantastic view of Pittsburgh. I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Yes its pricey but the food is amazing and so is the view. My family ordered the seafood platter as an appetizer, for our entrees we had the crab cakes (which they are known for), the stuffed shrimp and the strawberry salmon. We also had the risotto as a side. Everyone loved their meals. Out waiter was very attentive and the manager came to our table on 2 separate occasions to make sure everything was going well. He explained they are renovating in January and was very adamant about us giving our suggestions for things they need to work on or change. If you're are willing to splurge for a meal or are celebrating a special occasion, this place is great, probably the best seafood in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"We came to Monterey for our anniversary. We had a great time. The on street parking was not great because we came at a busy time but we found a spot. I think you can valet as well. 
We took the elevator up to the restaurant. We had to make a reservation so we got a table right away.  We were not right by the window, which are the best seats because of the view. We were super so honestly we could see the view fine. 

We had the crab cake appetizer and the shrimp as well. Both amazing and the crab was so soft. We ordered sea scallops and the tuna ! The meal was amazing and just so fresh . We were so happy.  
Keep in mind they did not come with sides so we ordered the lobster Mac and cheese and it was enough for two of us.

I thought it wouldn't get better but I ordered the  angel food grilled cheese ! I should have ordered this for my meal. It was the best dessert I have ever had honestly and I would come back just for that !"}
{"text":"Absolute four stars! With spectacular views overlooking the water from all around floor to ceiling windows, perfectly seasoned and fresh seafood selection, wonderful list of wines and drinks, uber modern and upscale ambiance with chill and relaxing low lighting in the lounge area, along with entertaining and friendly service, this place is a sure winner! Keep in mind, parking may be a bit dicey. But, they do offer valet options. I had the wedge salad, scallops and my boyfriend went with the artisan and the risotto. Portions are reasonable. Every bite exploded with the freshness of each dish. Applause for the chef! Perfect place for a classy and modern dining experience. Btw, kudos to management for hiring James, our waiter. He was an absolute sweetheart to my boyfriend and I."}
{"text":"Wow, this place is outstanding! We felt a little under dressed, seeing as though it was a Saturday evening and everyone was fairly dressed up, but no one made us feel like we should have dressed more formally. Our waiter was great, he knew EVERYTHING about the dishes on the menu, and recited a specials menu that was so long, I lost track of the many mouthwatering specials that he described in detail. Our drinks were fantastic, and the seafood was heavenly. My party finished off the meal with Irish coffees, and they were so strong (whiskey wise) that he had to warn us as he set them down. My Irish nuts and berries ( a cream chamboard drink) was so strong it made my head spin (in a good way). Very expensive, but very much worth it."}
{"text":"Wow! Wow! 

Beautiful views on top of a ridge overlooking the city.  In order to get to the dining room you have to ride a exterior glass elevator climbing the building! Cannot get any better.!!
Beautifully prepared fish, great wine selection, desserts, the views.  Rank this place high on my scale of ten.  
Excellent service, excellent food, you have to go here."}
{"text":"Was just on date night w my husband. Food great but after my husband ate his oysters  on the way home he got ill. He blamed the oysters not being served over ice! Bummer! But besides that let down my lobster n steak were cooked to my liking."}
{"text":"The renovations looks impeccable and were LONG overdue. Nearly every seat has an almost panoramic view of the city. The service is exceptional and the food is even better. Must try the crab cakes (almost NO filler, just enough to hold together the crab, the seafood trio appetizer and the angel food grilled cheese dessert -- flavor explosion!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best restaurants I have ever been to, and I have eaten here three times. First of all, the service is great. The food is excellent; Chilean sea bass and sea scallops have been some of the highlights. Of course the view is great, try to get a table by the front window. 

However, the best part is the phenomenal desserts - the Steaming Chocolate Latte is possibly the best dessert I've ever had. This is a warm chocolate souffle in a big coffee mug topped with Chantilly cream and \"chocolate steam\" (wavy pieces of chocolate for decoration), and the execution is perfect. I've also tasted a number of the other desserts which were all great. It's worth it just for the dessert.

The only downside I can think of is the cheesy decor (especially the columns)."}
{"text":"I was dissapointed . I have been wanting to go here for several years and finally made it last saturday night . The plusses were the view and great service . The negatives were small portions and hefty prices . I know , u pay for the view and I understand that . A nice place but for the money I would go somewhere else ."}
{"text":"Sadly going downhill.  As the Pittsburgh food scene grows and gets more interesting, places like this need to step their game up.  Instead, I think this place has sort of let itself go a bit.  The last few times I went, I had mistakes made with my order and a piece of ill cooked Chilean sea bass which was disappointing.  They have quality fish but lack consistency and creativity."}
{"text":"Yet another business dinner and yet another night of eating WAY too much food!  It's a rough life, I know.  Pity me...

One of THE most spectacular views of the city, bar none.  Most of the dining room has great/good views through the enormous windows, but I would even recommend the little bar downstairs for a drink and some great views.  Seemed to be not so well known, and a cheaper night than spending on the whole meal.

What can I say, the food was fantastic.  The Seared Ahi tuna was delicious with just the right amount of wasabi flavoring.  I ordered the salmon special on a cedar plank that was cooked and flavored absolutely right.  Even the steak was delicious according to some of my table-mates.

Wine list was generous (a bit pricey) but well complimenting the meals.  The serving staff was a touch slow, but it was nice not to feel rushed.

TIP:  Try their pretzel bread rolls.  They're delicious!

BIGGER TIP:  Not really sure about parking here, (I think there was valet service) but if you take a taxi there like we did, be prepared.  On a cold, snowy night we were waiting a good 45 minutes for a return taxi to the city.  Make sure to get your cab driver's number on the way over.  Give him an estimated time that you'll be done, and call him before dessert.  You'll save yourself a load of trouble. 

Absolutely a place to take clients/business dinners.  A little pricey, but the food and atmosphere will definitely impress.  It's a little out of the way, but still only a 10 minute cab ride from the Convention Center"}
{"text":"A romantic and fancy place to go for couples in celebration of special occasions. Get your money ready, it's pricey but worth it for the food and the view!

Appetizers are awesome! The ahi tuna was a very enjoyable experience as it was crispy/warm on the outside and raw on the inside.

Do NOT get the lobster! It's overpriced and overcooked!! 
Since it's called Fish Grotto, their fish are good. You can pick you favorite fish and have it cooked in any style you want (not limited to the menu).

MUST GET DESSERT! MUST GET the one with the white chocolate mousse!! BEST EVER

If you sit on the right side of the restaurant you will get an awesome view at night! Totally pretty"}
{"text":"So, we knew they finished the remodel but just hadn't had the chance to take a look until last night.  Gone are all the 1980's Miami Vice retro themed palm trees and the Sunset Boulevard themed colors.  This place is cool & hip with a friendly vibe and even their own sushi counter.  We were here with a local Happy Hour group that had arranged, ala Yelp style, for a cocktail & appetizer sampling and we were IMPRESSED!  

I'll spare you the 'intro' & 'outro' comps and get straight to their appetizer samplings.  The first and the biggest hit of the night were the Ichiban skewers.  They were a combo of marinated & chargrilled tuna, salmon & swordfish with an ancho-chili aioli drizzle.  There was a delicious Ceviche Roll which consisted of Oro King Salmon, apple, jalapeno peppers, red onion, red,yellow & green peppers with a topping of spicy mayo.  Then there was the Beef Tartar made up of Kobe beef, truffle oil, scallions and hard boiled egg over a fresh crostini.  last offering was a veggie roll for those in the group that were vegetarian.  There was a nice write-up of what was in those, but I'm not vegetarian so I didn't copy it down.  ;)

They had the bartenders create 3 specialty drinks for our group with a $5 price tag that made it feel like we were practically stealing them.  The first one was the Pittsburgh Aviator made up of Beefeater Gin, Luxardo Maraschino and cr√®me Yvette.  The second was a Three Rivers Smash made up of Woodford Rye whiskey, fresh mint and fresh lemon.  The last was a Strawberry Basil Pepino consisting of Hornitos Tequila, fresh lime, fresh strawberries and a jalapeno twist.  The last was MY favorite.  My adventurous wife prefers her cocktails served in a chilled long neck.  ;) 

This is not someplace I could afford to come to on a regular basis and that's ok.  But sometimes you gotta treat yourself and the next time I want to do that, I'm coming back...!"}
{"text":"Came to an event summit and dinner was hosted at this place. Great views which everyone talks about and could see that it is. Ordered their sea bass which was alright and that to me not as seasoned as it supposed to taste. Maybe because this was an event and had a catered menu i might have just ordered a dish that was not strong that night. I should have ordered their crab cakes which looked a bit more promising."}
{"text":"we have received good service and enjoy the food? It located in MonroevillePenna Mall  top service."}
{"text":"Pricey but worth it. Great views, great service, great food. The bread and butter with lemon vanilla honey alone is worth it. I had the salmon with lime honey butter and it was amazing. I was celebrating 2 year anniversary with my wife...definitely one of the best places to go to celebrate big occasions and splurge a little."}
{"text":"Disclaimer:  I like shellfish, but not fish.  I went rogue and ordered the special which was a rib eye with garlic fries.  The steak was a little fatty, but still very flavorful and tender.  Good drink selection.  The ambiance, service, and view make it a 4 star."}
{"text":"This place was unbelievable, beginning with the lobster nachos, the whole way through to the creme brule and steaming chocolate latte desserts. The fish selection was also incredible--the parmesan-crusted swordfish may have been the best fish I've eaten and the cape cod style mahi mahi was also great. My only gripe was the filet mignon, which was kind of plain and done automatically medium-well, without another temperature option."}
{"text":"Went to dinner for a birthday celebration.
Ordered a sampler of apps and all where extremely good,steamed mussols,tuna,fresh oysters,all great!
Fo my main corse they was out of the Opah and was very disappointed but ordered another Hawaii fish monchong was extremely good.
Only thing that was a PITA was waiting for the very slow elevator."}
{"text":"Amazing seafood! Absolutely love the romantic vibe and new renovations too. Had the best service from start to finish...I highly recommend this place to anyone. Living in Pgh or visiting from out of town. Reserve a window seat as the view of the city is great!! Parmesan crusted halibut literally melts in your mouth. The creamed corn is to die for...Spicy yet sweet and large enough for two people! The \"grilled cheese\" inspired dessert is absolutely delicious and big enough for two. Can't say enough about this place! 5 *****'s"}
{"text":"This restaurant is one of my favorites! The food, atmosphere, and service is awesome.  There is a spectacular view overlooking the city.  Reservations can be made on Open Table or by calling in.

Drinks: the cocktails were delicious, my only complaint was there was a TON of ice and very little alcohol in the glass.  The wine selections were wonderful as well.

Appetizers: the appetizers to order are the crab cake. The crab cake is all crab and very little filler, such a wonderful and the most perfect crab cake there ever was. I loved the calamari, so crispy and served with pickled jalape√±os on top, ohhh so good. The ichiba fish sampler blew my mind with the sauce seasoning. Caesar salad was served with real anchovies and perfect with the fresh cracked pepper.

Dinner: the special, the lobster ravioli was okay, pretty good but nothing memorable in my mind. Prepare to be blown away by the most tender flavorful stuffed scallops you will ever have.  Probably one of my favorite meals of the year.

Dessert: don't go home without having the best dessert in Pittsburgh (or your life). The grilled cheese angel food cake. Mind boggling and jaw dropping, not too sweet but the greatest array of flavors you will devour. The chocolate latte cake was pretty incredible as well. Heads up that it is really really hard to share these, don't underestimate these desserts."}
{"text":"The most amazing view... if you're lucky enough to get a table by the window. 

Unfortunately, I can't rate this place more than 3 stars because when we made a reservation we were told to come early to try to get a seat near the window, and when we arrived an hour before our reservation we were told they didn't even have a table large enough to accommodate us near the window. They even suggested we might not be seated on the lower floor a few tables away from the window. After a lot of anxiety and some moderately unpleasant interactions with the hostesses we sat in the lounge for an hour before getting a table on the floor a table back from the window. The lounge was great, with perfect views and perfect service.

The disappointment and stress we experienced at the hostess stand definitely dampened the mood of the night. The manager and server were very nice, but I suspect that they secretly hated us. 

We were eventually able to enjoy multiple appetizers, entrees, bottles of wine, and cocktails. 
Overall, food and view were awesome. If you make a reservation you need to be clear about what you're asking for/what you can expect to get. I'm going to assume this place would offer a 4/5 star experience if you didn't start your night in the same manner we did."}
{"text":"I can't explain how many times I have been to this restaurant and been disappointed. As a native Pittsburgher, I have been here many times throughout my life. 

The decor is just cheesy and lame. Fake painted palm trees? 

Service? Not what I would expect for a restaurant that runs at minimum $50+ per person. You have to pay for valet parking. When I arrived at the restaurant the valets did not even walk up to my car and open the door, or my passenger door. I had a reservation and still had to wait 10 minutes to be seated at an empty restaurant. (lets not forget about the elevator ride). 

Food? I have had better seafood from Costco. They serve FARMED salmon. What kind of seafood restaurant does that? The crabcakes are the only thing that is good on the menu. Everything else is just terrible. I ordered a special earlier this year that included three items: Filet, Duck, and Yellow-fin tuna. I ordered the meat and duck medium rare and tuna rare. When the server brought out my meal, the duck and meat were barely cooked to \"rare\" temperatures. They were could throughout. I will happily eat rare meat, but rare duck is awful. I asked the server if she could have them cook the duck and meat a little longer (to medium rare temps). She argued with me that I was wrong and shouldn't be doing that. She took my food and brought it back. The meat and duck were even colder than they were the first time. 

$150 later, I left the restaurant frustrated and disappointed."}
{"text":"Monterey Bay has very good food and service. The restrooms are very fancy and clean. Try to sit by the window'; it's a beautiful view. Everyone go to Monterey Bay."}
{"text":"Terrific view atop Mt. Washington. Terrible decor. Fake plastic trees, maybe wannabe art decor design. Disappointing decor given the view and high quality of food. 

Love the appetizers, including the crab cakes and seared tuna. My sea bass with pineapple and cajun seasoning was superb. Great drinks menu. Very, very extensive fish menu. All the fish is flown in fresh each day. I would without a doubt return."}
{"text":"Came here for a celebratory dinner last Friday night and it was so nice! The place has the best view (you take an elevator from the lobby to get to the actual restaurant/eating area).  We had our coats checked and were taken to a table right next to the window - the whole environment was very romantic and classy.  

We had the combo appetizer (wasn't on the menu, but our waiter informed us about it).  It had one of the \"famous\" crab cakes (incredible), two ichiban skewers (salmon, yellow fin tuna, and swordfish), and two of their jumbo shrimp (sauce was delicious). 

I had the salmon done the honey lime style and it was the best salmon I have ever had. It was so smooth and the honey was amazing.  My boyfriend ordered the yellow-fin tuna done port style.  The sauce was great but he found it to be a little too rare (but he is not too much of a tuna fan -- it would have been perfect for any other tuna lover).  We had the tri-color potatoes for a shareable side, the sweet potatoes were great, but found that we could have done without ordering the side.  

We finished off with the chocolate cheesecake which was amazing.  I was worried that it would be too rich or sweet, but it was just the right amount and the texture was great.  The pretzel and pistachios were a great complement.  

Overall, service, food, and environment made it a really memorable experience.  One thing that was a little hard to not mention was the constant refilling of our water glasses - I wouldn't even get 2 sips in until someone came over again to \"refill\" my glass!"}
{"text":"Here is another example of a review that I wish could receive a half a star.   I would give 3 stars for the view and a 1/2 a star for the food.  Don't get me wrong, the food wasn't terrible but it wasn't over the top either, and I expect to be wow'd after throwing down hat much money.   

I went to Monterey Bay for a friend's birthday last night, and ultimately is was a great dinner because of the occasion.  However, I don't think that I will be making a repeat appearance.  Everything was ridiculously over priced but I paid it without complaint.   We ordered the appetizer platter and shared a bottle of wine while waiting for our other dining partners arrived.  The crab cakes were all that they were advertised to be and the sauce was creamy and delicious. 

I had the Basil Garlic Yellow Snapper with rice pilaf for my entree and it was ok.  Nothing too inspiring.  Overall, I felt their menu was a bit old school, which works for a specific sect of dinners.  A lot of people don't want to try anything too fancy or challenging.  I am just not one of those people."}
{"text":"I'd probably really give this 2.5 stars.   Fabulous view- definitely ask for a window seat.  I love Chilean sea bass, it's my favorite - but for some reason it wasn't great - it tasted a little overdone. Lobster Mac n cheese was good. Asparagus was forgettable as was the grilled wedge- I was hoping for a little more char to it - the dressing was good though.  Can't beat the view just wish the food matched how great the view was.  Service was good- a little stuffy but ok and the wine was great.  For it being a fish place I expected to be blown away with the sea bass but was sadly disappointed."}
{"text":"We went here for our first anniversary. I could not imagine having a better night than what we experienced. Everything from the hostess to the bartenders while we waited for our table by the window was absolutely perfect.  Our server Anita was fantastic and the general manager, John, made us feel like they were open that day just for us. I had the Tuna which was amazing, and my wife couldn't give higher praises to the Lobster Bisque. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"This restaurant relies totally on it fabulous location and not at all on its kitchen which is badly lacking,.  Our waitress was arrogant. The food was soso. Special requests were dismissed. Prices were way too high for the quality provided. Enjoy the view from the bar, order sushi or an appetizer and take the rest of your business elsewhere."}
{"text":"We had dinner with a business associate.  This was a fantastic suggestion.  First, the view is AMAZING.  It speaks for itself and I couldn't possibly do it justice.  I was extremely happy that we went to a seafood restaurant instead of the usual steak house.  We had drinks in the lounge first.  AMAZING VIEWS as well.  After a few glasses of wine, we moved to the dining room.  It is very classically vegas meets 50's dinner club.  Over the top yet classy.  We tried the shrimp cocktail (which is served with dry ice smoking underneath) and the tuna tartar.  For dinner we had the crab cake (which was served in a deconstructed manner) and sea bass macadamia.  For sides we tried the creamed spinach, potatoes, and lobster mac and cheese.  The place has a great energy and while large, is not too noisy.  I would recommend this for a business dinner any night of the week.  It is a bit pricey. With drinks the bill was closer too $100 a head."}
{"text":"The view of downtown is great; the food? not so much -- very limited ingredients on the plate, we both ordered fish and neither dish was good enough to match the view. The fish was too tight and overcooked, and the source didn't work that well with the fish. Overall it's just fine"}
{"text":"One of the best views you'll have eating. The food itself is above average. Still completely worth it."}
{"text":"Stopped here with my mama for a shopping break/late lunch before we headed over to Ross Park. I ordered the lobster nachos and she got the crab cake. My mom thought her crab cake was decent, but nothing to rave about, especially since it was one modestly-sized crab cake for $20-something. We both thought the lobster nachos were delicious - you could actually taste the lobster unlike everywhere else, and the portion was enormous (looks like it's not on the menu anymore, sad). Overall, I thought it was good, but it was pretty slow. I would stop in again, but definitely not when I want a quick lunch."}
{"text":"Food was good, view of the city was great. Many options on the menu for whatever you might be in the mood for. Even a Gluten free menu."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints!

The food is excellent. Absolutely order the angel food grilled cheese for desert you won't be sorry.

The view is amazing on the city side. The other side is fine but there isn't nearly as much to look at.

The waitstaff and management have always been very friendly to myself"}
{"text":"Awesome! I've never been here before. It is quite a few floors up, you take an elevator to the actually restaurant. I took my boyfriends mother. We were sat by a window with an amazing view of the city. To start, we had shrimp cocktail and oysters. Best shrimp cocktail ever. For dinner, she had halibut that was in a sort of orange basil sauce and a colorful potato mix. I had tuna that was stuffed with spinach and goat cheese with a marsala sauce, and crab Mac and cheese. Everything was delicious, and our server, Jeff, who was PERFECT, even helped me pick a great drink. It was a martini with makers mark, and I believe peach liquor, simple syrup, and lemon juice? I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I had heard mixed things about monterey bay so when there was a family gathering at this venue I was excited to see for my own how this place is like.  Entering the restaurant you get a feeling of elegance and nice, upscale atmosphere.  It sets your mood for a great culinary experience.  However, personally, I think that the my expectations were met only at the space itself rather than the most important thing which is the  food.  Not that the food was not good, but it was overpriced for what it was.  I got a chicken-dish (I know this place is a fish restaurant) but still you would have expected a fantastic dish.  Nonetheless, the food was a bit dry and definitely not of the high-standards one expects from these type of venues.  The rest of my party - that actually tried fish - were underwhelmed as well.  Having said that, the service was great and fast but I think I will not choose to go back again (expect if there is some sort of gathering/meeting again)."}
{"text":"Quite honestly the best restaurant experience I've had in a looong time. EVERYTHING about our night was absolutely perfect! I'll start by saying that Pittsburgh's food scene has been exploding as of late with lots of new trendy spots popping up in hipster neighborhoods around town. But Monterey Bay has been a standard in the Burgh for a long time, and I feel like it's only gotten better. Some of the restaurants on Mt. Washington coast by on the views, but that's not the case here!

The views are excellent of course, and the decor is contemporary but still inviting. I think the last time I was here they had a tropical theme going on, but the remodeled interior is beautiful.

We had the ceviche appetizer - I didn't expect to love it as much as I did. It was light and refreshing, and we could tell that the kanpachi was fresh. I had the crab cake and scallops as my entree. The scallops were simply prepared but SO good. If you come here you need to experience a crab cake! They use practically no filler at all. Just enough to keep it together. They are also broiled instead of fried. I honestly don't know if i would ever order anything else here! 

My fianc√© went with the shrimp tagliatelle which was also fabulous. The sauce was delicious and the tagliatelle noodles were cooked perfectly. We were surprised that the pasta dish was so delicious! For dessert we went with the angel food grilled cheese and the hype is real - it's amazing. The portion size was quite large so I think this is perfect to share. I love dessert and this is one of my favorites.

The service was just excellent. Jane our server was so friendly and knowledgeable and the manager stopped by to check on us as well. I can't wait to come back!!"}
{"text":"Amazing views, but high prices considering the food quality; you're really paying for the view here, not the food. Food wise, I've had better fish at Umi and Penn Ave, Fish Company.

Service was prompt and friendly, although the decor was surprisingly tacky - palm tree pillars? Really? Probably won't go back again unless someone is visiting from out of town who really wants to see the view."}
{"text":"My husband and I went last evening for a big celebration and it was fantastic. The waiter was attentive and kind, and immediately noted that I had a gluten allergy indicated on my reservation. He brought me gluten-free bread with a separate dish of butter to start (gluten-free bread is essentially never offered at a restaurant). Our seafood trio appetizer was spectacular: a gluten-free crab cake with marinated fish pieces and two jumbo shrimp. Our lobster bisque was great. They pour the soup in with the cream at your table. The flavor was not salty (as some lobster bisques are). Did I mention their lobster bisque is gluten-free?
By the time I got to my main course - lobster risotto - I was too full to heave more than a few bites, so I took most of it home. It was equally good, if not better, re-heated in the oven! 


Our experience was fantastic. It was the most expensive meal we've had in years, but it was well worth it for a big celebration."}
{"text":"This place is a must if you're living in or visiting Pittsburgh. Or if you want to have an outstanding meal! The tables by the Windows go early, but we sat on the second tier and I think that was actually a better view. Everything here was perfect from start to finish. We tried sushi as an appetizer and it was great! For our entree, we had salmon and sea bass. This is the best meal we have had in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"So far, Monterey Bay Fish Grotto has been the best restaurant we've been to in Pittsburgh. I visited with my wife and three other couples, all new to the area. 7 of the 8 of us are from Miami, Florida and most of us fish and lobster dive, so we are used to excellent and fresh seafood. This place was a hit for all of us. I would like to give it 5 stars, but a couple of things knocked it down to a 4 for me. I'll start with the good, though. 

#1: The view. Obviously, among the best views from any restaurant every where. Everyone at our table had something beautiful to look at (besides their lovely partners, of course), from the Sunset on one side to the city sky line on the other. It was the kind of place where every table had a great view. The decor was also classy, and created a very nice ambience. 

#2: Most of the food was phenomenal. We had calamari, crab cakes, and a sampler appetizer which was delicious. It combined Ahi tempura and Ichiban served on a skewer, each with wonderful texture and flavor. The dessert was a lavender creme brulee which was as delicate, aromatic, and delicious as it sounds. All of my dining companions enjoyed their entrees. My friend to my right had the crab-stuffed giant scallops and couldn't finish them. Thank goodness for me! I got to share some of her left-overs, and it was one of the most perfect bites of food I have ever tasted. the scallop had been seasoned and cooked perfectly, so it had the perfect texture; smooth, not tough or rubbery as it can be when over-cooked. The crab inside was perfection - large chunks of moist delicious crab without any hint of fishiness. It was clearly fresh off of the plane, just as the waitress promised when it was introduced. 

The bad:

#1: The grouper. Again, I am from Miami, and most of the grouper I have eaten in my life went from my own fish hook to my plate, (or maybe my uncle's fish hook if I was having one of my more typical bad luck fishing days). When I've eaten grouper in restaurants, it's always been fresh off of the boat in places like the Florida Keys. Perhaps that's why I found this particular grouper very disappointing. It's hard to explain what was wrong with it, but it just wasn't nearly as good as other grouper I've had. It didn't taste quite as fresh, delicate, or mild. It may have been the way it was prepared. I had it, \"Monterey style\". This meant it was prepared with artichoke hearts, black olives, tomato, garlic, green onion and mushrooms, saut√©ed in a Marsala wine sauce. This was a definite fail. The flavors were good, but completely over-powered the fish and brought out all of the wrong flavors in it. It seemed like a better seasoning for something like chicken, not grouper. I probably should have gone with Mango pepper style.

#2: The cost. I might have been less dissapointed if I hadn't paid 50-75% more then I ever had for much better grouper in Florida. Well, I guess the flight from MIA to PITT isn't cheap. While I think most of the other dishes were well worth the cost, my entree was less then outstanding. 

I'd still go back, but I won't be ordering grouper, or \"Monterey style\". I'll probably have more of those incredible scallops all to myself this time. Also, it will probably be for a special occasion, given the price."}
{"text":"Best seafood restaurant in Pittsburgh. Always an amazing experience and a wonderful treat. The city view is incredible and very romantic atmosphere. My absolute favorite place to go to dinner. Love it."}
{"text":"Amazing food to go along with incredible view. creative desserts and cocktails. The seafood is the star. Well worth the trip. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We come here eat and drink quite often. If you are looking for a sea food dinner, this is the place! All the sea food here is freshly made, I can taste the freshness! Once you go fresh, never want go back to frozen fish. Angle cake is my fav desert here! Grilled cheese sandwich with sweet almond, yum! Writing this review is making me want go back there right now! In the summer. They have my favorite watermelon mojido. I understand people think that this is a standard/common drink, however, it is hard to make a easy drink prefect. A lot of place either have too much syrup or too much alcohol.  Too bad it is a seasonal drink."}
{"text":"I am somewhat conflicted by Monteray Bay. I want to absolutely love this place, but i honestly can't. 
  My wife and i went there recently celebrating our anniversary. It was a pretty big deal to us. When i made the reservation i noted this and hoped to get a window table. I purposely made the reservation slightly off peak. When we arrived, on time, we had to wait almost 15 minutes to be seated. I was disappointed in the seats we were given. I asked politely if there was a chance we could be seated by a window, and was told that would require at least an hour wait. We sat in such a way that my wife had a decent view. I had virtually no view unless a turned almost sideways.
   Oh well, this happens, and i wasn't going to allow it to taint our celebration. Our server greeted us and reviewed some of their specials, bit dinner and appetizer.  They suggested a combo appetizer that had a small crab cake, 2 shrimp, and a skewer with several small pieces of Tuna and Salmon on it. That sounded like a nice light appetizer to share, so we ordered it. We got our drinks and perused the menu. 
   Obviously their focus is on seafood, and they offered a nice selection on their menu. While we were trying to decide, one of the managers came to our table and greeted us. He wished us a happy anniversary(nice touch), and when my wife asked for some input on her choice, he suggested a particular fish. She decided to order what he suggested.
   We received our appetizer, and it was indeed small. Just enough to take the edge off, and very very tasty. My wife wanted to taste their lobster bisque, but didn't want too much food before the entree, so we agreed to share a bowl. The server actually brought it to us already divided into two separate portions(another nice touch). Awesome. It wasn;t quite as good as a local restaurant that we visit, but it was certainly good. 
   The server had taken our order and we were relaxing and talking and enjoying the night.  Then, the server came to our table and informed my wife that her fish choice was not available. Seriously? The recommendation of the manager was not available? Not cool. SHe made another choice and kept her fingers crossed.
   The entrees actually came out pretty quickly. We had ordered a few side dishes since everything there is ala carte.  The food was delicious. The vegetables were cooked perfectly, and everything was very flavorful. We enjoyed our dinners.
   We had a second round of drinks and finished our dinners. The server informed us that since it was our anniversary, if we wished to share a dessert it would be com0plimentary (yet another nice touch). We have the angelfood cake cheese sandwich which was unique and quite good.
   All in all, it was a very nice dining experience and we enjoyed it. So why not 5 stars? Nothing huge, just some small things that added up.
   First of all, i am no stranger to fine dining, and to the cost of fine dining. That said, Monteray bay crosses the line into slightly overpriced. That little appetizer was $27 (had no idea when we ordered it) The Lobster bisque(which had a few small langostinos) was $15. They charged us $7 for water. 
  With all of the competition for fine dining dollars in the area, i think they may be in trouble down the road if they are not careful. From everything i have read and heard, Altius offers a superior dining experience for around the same money. There are other choices too. certainly MB offers a great dining experience, but I am not it is quite worth the check at the end of the night."}
{"text":"This was the one fancy restaurant I had planned for our trip to Pittsburgh and my buddy made all the arrangements for everyone. Pros first.. cons later.

Reservations are highly recommended! FYI, we were seated immediately upon our arrival.

So here goes with the pros:

If I could make a comparison, I'd say this is the Pittsburgh version of Atlanta's Sun Dial in the sense that you get an AMAZING view of downtown (minus the nauseating rotation). Luck was on our side and we got the best table in the house. Often times, a corner table wouldn't be considered ideal, but it is when you've got floor to ceiling windows that open up to two phenomenally beautiful (and almost completely different) views right as the sun was setting, the sky began to darken, and the buildings were beginning to light up.

To start, the gentlemen all ordered stiff drinks while we waited for our complimentary bread basket. One of my friends went ahead and ordered a wine for his entree and asked the waitress for a good pairing. She then brought out a couple of tastings for him until he found one he liked.

We ordered the combination appetizer (not available on the menu - ask for it!) with jumbo Cajun shrimp, crab cake, and Ichiban (tuna, salmon, and swordfish grilled on a skewer). It was unanimous that the crab cake was the star, for it was almost completely jumbo lump crab and no filler. A hint of lemon would be my only suggestion for it.

As for entrees, we had a TOUGH time choosing. All their fish are caught fresh and flown in the same day and the menu offerings are slightly different depending on what is caught. If there's a fish they don't have that day, their menu will reflect so with an \"NA\" but they like to leave it on in case you want to come back to try it in the future. The preparation options below each fish choice are their recommendations, but you can actually choose any preparation with any fish at no additional cost except for the \"oscar\" option.
-Enter.. my strawberry prep Chilean Sea Bass -- Chargrilled, finished with fresh peppered strawberries in a red wine sauce. The men were jealous, yes.. jealous of my fruity concoction and voted it best dish at the table. 
-Beau ordered the Swordfish Oscar and it was perfect for him. Swordfish is very dense and it was nicely grilled, so it had a very woody / manly taste to it hahaha. 
-You can never go wrong with surf and turf (also not on the menu, so you should ask for it): filet mignon, a large lobster tail, and cheddar whipped potatoes. My friend said all the food was great but the filet mignon was best of all and cooked to the perfect medium rare.
-Parmesan Chilean Sea Bass was the last of 'em. My friend enjoyed it, but all the cheese is very filling and he couldn't finish his meal, especially with the sides we chose.
-Sides are meant to share here, so we went with the lobster mac and cheese and the seasonal vegetables.

We shared two desserts - a lavender cr√®me brulee and a white chocolate macadamia mousse. I'd skip on the cr√®me brulee unless they have a different flavor. The lavender seriously made it feel like we were eating an air freshener. The mousse looked unappealing because it looked like two mounds of mashed potatoes. But looks can be deceiving, as I learned through the entire dessert round. Heaven.. in.. your.. mouth. Seriously! You must order it.

The presentation for everything was very appealing and well thought out. Portion sizes were very generous, with our fish entrees taking up most of our dinner plates.  You will not leave here hungry, folks.

Service was wonderful. Our waitress was incredibly patient, explained the menu, offered her personal suggestions, and answered all the questions we had. Our drinks were refilled quickly, under the watchful eyes of the water guys. The manager even came over personally to ask how our dinner was and if there was anything they could do to make our dining experience even better (to which we said no). 

They offer valet service for a fee. I'm not sure what it was because we opted to park one street over for free.

After all that's said and done.. what could I possibly have to say that is less than radiant?

- My buddy told me he got a LOT of grief for changing the reservation from 3 people to 4. I understand how it might be a hassle to change a reservation from 4 to 5 since all the tables sat 2 and were pushed together to accommodate more.
-We were promised our complimentary bread basket but it took a very long time for it to arrive; even the waitress thought so, too. We were starving and drinking on empty stomachs.
-You ride an elevator up to the restaurant and there's a bit of a wait, since there's a small limit as to how many people can be inside at one time. Going down was much quicker.

Perfect for a romantic evening or when you're in your fancy schmancy mood and want to get dressed up to eat something delicious. Hey, anywhere they use a comb brush to clean the table is entitled to using the term \"fancy schmancy\" okay?"}
{"text":"5/5 for view (Get a window seat!), absolutely stunning views. 

5/5 for waitstaff, friendly and professional. We ordered a plate of oysters that my mother deemed not fresh enough, and they they immediately took it off our check

3/5 for food. What do you expect from seafood this far inland? The sauce on my halibut was a little too sweet for my liking, and the oysters weren't fresh, but otherwise it was fine, not amazing"}
{"text":"The food here was delicious and well-prepared, but be prepared to pay a bit more for the lovely views overlooking Pittsburgh.  The service was attentive and not overbearing, fairly knowledgeable, friendly, and it's a white cloth sort of place, albeit not stuck up.  I give it a four star simply because I think it's rather overpriced.  

Onto the food:  
- Beef carpaccio with a dash of truffle oil:  Solid but nothing to write home about.  Truffle oil isn't too overwhelming.  
- Lobster bisque:  Beautifully done classic.  No complaints here. 
- Whole fish with olives and other veggies:  Mine was black bass and it was delicious, just barely cooked, lightly seasoned.  
- Redfish curry:  Pretty light on the curry and not really a Thai or Indian or Japanese or any traditional curry, but tasty. 
- Angel food cake grilled cheese:  Yes, it sounds bizarre, but my dining companions said it was the star of the desserts.  
- Chocolate cheesecake and chocolate mousse dessert:  My dining companions said these were quite good.  

For drinks, the smoke Manhattan was more like a decent traditional Manhattan."}
{"text":"We go to MB for special occasions!  Saturday night we sat down and it was about 10-15 minutes before anyone even came by with water.  Drinks and appetizers were fine. Our fish preparation was delicious as usual. We had the tri color potatoes and corn for the sides. They were not hot upon arrival.  They were cafeteria quality. We each tasted the potatoes and left them. Our waiter swung by a time or two. Our water glasses were never refilled.  MB is an expensive restaurant and the service was always fantastic. The service wasn't even close to fantastic on our most recent experience.  It's time to find a new restaurant to celebrate our special occasions."}
{"text":"Excellent view & service, somewhat 'dated' interior (still acceptable) - 4 stars 
Appetizer: jumbo shrimp cocktail(5), ahi tempura, crab cake - all pretty good, 4 stars
Entr√©e: hawaiian ahi tuna sesame style, Chilean sea bass, and another fish whose name I cannot recall. They were somehow all so salty. Wish they put less salt in it. 3 stars.
Got chocolate cake for dessert-Okay.
It is a pricey place. 3 adults paid $300 for dinner including a bottle of wine."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in Pittsburgh! If you love fresh fish you must try this place! There are fish from several seas from all over the globe. All of the sides are a la carte and somewhat shareable for maybe 2-3 people. The date salad is to die for! I've never had the same thing twice and I've never had a bad experience!!"}
{"text":"I've been lucky enough to eat here twice in my life. It truly is a wonderful experience
 from start to finish. I agree that the decor could use a little refresh, but it's not bad enough to turn me away. 

On my most recent trip there (2/24/12) my bf and I both walked away feeling like the money spent there was well worth it. Our waiter, Glen, was outstanding, the manager came to our table twice to make sure we were having a good time, and the food was out of this world. Considering the variety on their menu, I already can't wait to go back! I have 3 things lined up in my head.  

P.S. The Gentlemen's Cocktail is the best drink on the menu!"}
{"text":"I've been to Monterey Bay multiple times.  Four years ago we had terrible service and haven't been back.  Fast forward to now.  We have decided to have a small wedding ceremony and reception with just family (10 people).  We wanted to come into Monterey Bay for our small reception dinner.  We didn't need a private room, just a nice table that we were hoping would be near the windows for the best view and a little more private.  

I called and spoke with the hostess. We explained that it would be our wedding reception dinner and that we were just interested in ordering from the menu.  We asked about seating and if they would accommodate a window seat, or what they would suggest since it is a special night out.  The hostess bluntly informed me that they do not reserve window seats and it is first come first serve.  If someone before our 6:30 reservation requested that table, they would receive it instead of us.  Ok... I can understand that. I can appreciate that policy.  But, this is a small wedding dinner. This is a special day for us, even if we aren't planning on spending over 25K for a full blown private reception, we feel that we should get to have a special night.  We made the reservation and I continued to search for other options.  

Yesterday, we found another restaurant on Mt. Washington that would accommodate us, gave us the information for their pastry chef so that we could have a special dessert created, and was excited to have us as patrons at their restaurant.  I called to cancel our Monterey Bay reservations and I explained why we were canceling.  The hostess replied with, \"OK - we'll cancel your reservation\" and hung up.  Guess they don't really care that we will never be back, or that they have zero customer service to patrons that were planning on spending up to or more than $2,000 on dinner, drinks, and desserts..."}
{"text":"simple .menu choices good fresh sea food, good service worth the money. ..great city view to dine at night"}
{"text":"We had dinner here for my wife's birthday on Friday August 26. She was greeted with Happy Birthday's from everyone which was nice. Our server was Jane who did a very nice job of pacing our dinner, we take our time. Also good with pacing our wine pours. She helped to make our dinner very comfortable. Our dinners were delicious. A sampler platter with shrimp, tuna and crab cake, salads, the crab stuffed scallops and parmesan halibut were all excellent. My wife received a birthday dessert and was the angel food grilled cheese sandwich and that was wonderful. They go all out to make your occasion special. The manager came over to introduce himself. Not an everyday restaurant because prices are not low but for special occasions great to go. $6 parking with nice attendants. Great views."}
{"text":"I want to give this place 5 stars for the crab cakes!!! Unfortunately, my review has to be comprehensive. Hands down, best crab cakes I've ever had! I had them as an appetizer and a main! Anyone who goes here must try the crab cakes! 

Overall, all their seafood is well done, but nothing you would crave for. The only two things I crave - the crab cakes and the butter served with the bread basket! And believe it or not, these are enough to keep me going back!

Service was good, as it should be for a fine dining restaurant."}
{"text":"A romantic spot for special occasions. Spent almost exactly 200 for myself and my fiance but it was worth every penny! We had crab cakes, swordfish, asparagus, Au gratin potatoes, bottle of wine, and split a peach cobbler cheesecake. Everything was amazing!"}
{"text":"I haven't been here since their remodel and revamp, so I was interested in seeing how the restaurant had changed. The aesthetic here now is much more modern and reflective of the high end dining experience you get here. As I'm sure you already know, don't dine here unless you're prepared to pay at least $50 per person. Entrees here vary in cost, but average probably around $35. There are also a variety of appetizers, soups, salads and side dishes, as well as alcohol and dessert. It adds up very quickly. I had the Lobster Bisque soup as a starter. The server brought the bowl to me, with the lump lobster inside and then poured the soup overtop into the bowl in front of me. It was a really nice and flavorful soup with a considerable amount of lobster meat. For dinner, I had the Crab Cakes. The cakes were very generous in size and had more meat than filler. I would definitely recommend them just like many other Yelpers here have. I also got to try the lobster mac and cheese. This was also delicious. It is on the sides menu, but was big enough to have as an Entree."}
{"text":"One cannot review Monterey Bay without first mentioning the incredible view of the city. We took the trolley up Mt. Washington and walked to the restaurant during the evening and were fortunate it was a clear night with an incredible view of Pittsburgh while it was lit up with lights and a Pirates game in the background. The restaurant offers great views with an abundance of windows. I can't think there's a better view in all of Pittsburgh. The food also was delicious. The rockfish was fresh with excellent seasoning and I would also recommend trying the dessert menu, which offers some unique and delicious twists on traditional desserts. There are two negatives of note: first, where we sat they had tables for two that were arranged length-wise so you sit very far apart from each other--I think this was done to cram more tables into that particular area of the restaurant; second, once the waiter saw that we were only ordering less expensive entrees with no sides (which are priced individually), he was dismissive and perturbed and not interested in serving us. Otherwise, I would highly recommend as a required stop in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Amazing views and a decent menu no sushi. It was the whole reason we went because of the pictures of sushi we saw when we looked it up. Rating not reflecting that our stupidity of google. I'm not a seafood lover but they do have a couple very expensive steaks. My filet was good not great $45 worth but good. And our calamari was awesome, I do like calamari. And cocktails weren't as expensive as I thought which is good but our waiter was not on top of our drinks at all. I was finding myself with an empty glass too often and had to flag him down every time to get one. In all we had a good anniversary dinner."}
{"text":"Maybe it was an off day but 3 out of 3 things we tried just weren't that great. The view is AMAZING but the food was pretty mediocre unfortunately (Three strikes you're out!). It's probably better to just come here for drinks to be honest. At least the service was very friendly.

Chilean seabass with korean bbq preparation. It sounded great... but.. it didnt taste very impressive. When I think seabass I think flaky, buttery tasting fish. This was kinda dry and mostly tasteless. Maybe they cooked it too long, I dunno? But it didnt taste like anything special, ESPECIALLY for $39. Probably the worst seabass I've had to be honest.

Lobster mac and cheese. The mac and cheese was runny and just not that good. Usually mac and cheese is rich, gooey and tasty but not this one. It ended up with a bunch of watery sauce in the plate and while it wasn't terrible, it def was not good.

Fettucini with salmon. Of all the things this was probably the best... of the worst. It was ok. If it was 12 bucks id probably be like \"you know that wasnt so bad\" but it was nothing to write home about. My pasta ended up stuck together in a huge mass that practically needed to be cut to separate. The salmon chunks that came with it were ok. Nothing special.

Basically I would NEVER eat dinner here again. They've won awards so maybe I just had an off night. Regardless, I just can't recommend you eat here. Come here and go downstairs and get some drinks and enjoy the view, skip the food."}
{"text":"Great service please eat the red snapped Cajun style. It was great!! First time in Steeler Country."}
{"text":"Monterrey Bay is easy to praise, mostly for the extraordinary view and attractive dining room. The praise is well deserved. However, I can't get to 5* because the food is only good, not great. Last night we had two different preparations of sole as mains, the gratin potato side, and the signature desert, 'Angel Food Grilled Cheese Sandwich' to finish. Everything was fine, but nothing was remarkably good. Service was just right and the wine list offered a couple of fairly priced California Chardonnays, a must for me, although they were well hidden. This is obviously a special occasion restaurant, with a very memorable view and prices to match."}
{"text":"I had the crab cakes as usual. My wife had the halibut.  Everything was awesome as usual!"}
{"text":"Went here recently with my boyfriend for my birthday. We both loved everything! We had a beautiful view of the sunset and our food was delicious! Definitely pricey but worth it for a special occasion and nothing we didn't expect. Can't wait to return"}
{"text":"Spectacular view. average food ran out of mahi didn't discount halibut. No way a halibut filet ought to cost $33.  shrimp scampi more like soup grab the lounge corner table closest to the city!
50% premium on food for the view
Supercrabcakes"}
{"text":"We just had or 19th anniversary dinner at Monterey and it was outstanding
The service is top notch
I made the reservation through open table and asked for a window seat and noted it was our anniversary. From the second we checked in every one that greeted us congratulated us!
We were taken to our beautiful seat right at the window
The waitress was the best I ever had Cindy! Cindy was with the company as long as we've been married and was knowledgable and friendly
She was funny and even took or picture without asking.
We had the trio appetizer which was the famous crab cake, ichoban and a few Cajun shrimp! 
For the entree We both had the fresh halibut, mine was prepared with apples and chorizo sausage and crusted with a finely ground granola. It tasted like fall!
My wife had hers prepared with the parmesan sauce and it was also outstanding  
Then as a great surprise we were given a complimentary dessert for our celebration !
Although you do pay for the view, the food is excellent
Fresh and perfectly prepared"}
{"text":"Not bad.. high quality steak asked for medium came out medium rare.. had the Brussels sprouts not bad.. the view and the ambience are a 10/10.. It is the highest point in Pittsburgh I would have to say.. you can see far back to homestead... Def pricey"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. I had my rehearsal dinner in the private room here and they were amazing. All of the food came out incredible, the service was terrific, and everyone had only good things to say. It also has the greatest view of downtown Pittsburgh and I like to come here for special occasions. The fresh fish can't be beat!"}
{"text":"The first time I came here for a date night.  The service was great, the entrees (Swordfish chop was somewhat bland and salmon was very flavorful) where decent and the desserts amazing (Angel food Grilled Cheese and the Chocolate Guava Roll).  My first experience was 4 out of 5 stars; however, the second time was a 2 out of 5 stars.

So my second time here was for a birthday party (8 guests total).  Upon arrival, for a 7:30 reservation, we had to wait in the lounge as they didn't have s table (there were a great deal that said reserved) which makes no sense if we had a confirmed reservation.  So we had a few drinks and then they sat us.  Our server was great; however, lack of communication from the kitchen made the night frustrating.  Several of us ordered a Chilean Sea Bass; however, 30-45 minutes after ordering we are told that they were out.  They were also out of the lobster mac and cheese that had been ordered.  We decide on another entree, but guess what, they were out.  We finally found something that they had (I got the yellow fin tuna) and then continued on with our conversations.  So some members of our group decided to order more wine, but guess what, they were out of the wine they wanted.  I wanted dessert as did my girlfriend; however, they were out of the chocolate guava roll (the only dessert my girlfriend could eat).  It is a good thing that we had brought an ice cream cake!  Oh but they managed to botch that up slightly because the hostess staff member who originally took it back to the kitchen had placed it in the dairy cooler!  So instead we had something between a piece of cake and a milkshake for dessert.  They even ran out of bags to put leftovers in!  Long story short, they were unable to provide 16 items that we requested.  I understand that they could be running low on items by Sunday night, but they could have informed us in a reasonable and timely fashion (improve the communication between the wait staff and the kitchen).  The wait staff was great and we actually were able to joke with them about being out of everything.  My biggest issue is that we didn't get anything comped, and with all the issues from the kitchen, I would have expected the chief to come out and personally apologize.

I am actually going back this Saturday to try their Sakari portion of the restaurant.  I hope it is smooth sailing or it may be the last time I dine here."}
{"text":"Average at best.... We came for a birthday celebration based on the wishes of the birthday'er, but I found the food to be overpriced and generally not so good. The view of the city is great and the service is generally pleasant.

So what missed the mark? Lobster bisque was an epic fail. I'm a fan of seafood bisque and this worried me. The texture, consistency, and look reminded me of butternut squash soup. It was chunks of what was supposed to be lobster and soup poured over. It was quite tasteless.

For the entree, I ordered the red snapper with lemon and brown sugar sauce. Hubs got swordfish with chimichurri sauce. Our companions had a lemon sole with strawberry sauce and another halibut with parmesan crust, who enjoyed their fish. Unfortunately, hubs and I found ours undercooked. Not good for swordfish when the texture is suppose to be meater. The chimichurri sauce was minimal as plating decoration. The fish covered with jalape√±o and cilantro and parsley.... The red snapper was a bit worrisome, too soft a texture. The skin still on and the sauce way too overpowering by the butter.

We also ordered sides: brussels sprouts with bacon (oily, but good), potatoes (fine, as expected), and asparagus (bad! Hubs thought the bottom could be trimmed, I think they were pass their prime).

We had steaming mocha latte, Angel food grill cheese, and strudel for desserts. The Angel food grill cheese was the winner.

Service was attentive, but incredibly slow. We waited a long time for our entrees. Very long. No one came to check on us during that time, but they comped one dessert for the wait. Unfortunately, dessert was another wait.

Not sure I get it. Definitely doesn't live up to the hype."}
{"text":"Amazing view and excellent service . I had a Rosemary Greentea cocktail and it was delicious ! The food is really good . My husband and I tried the cevich ( i have had better) and I got Chilean sea bass and Ahi Tina 

Must Try the Brussels Sprouts 
My waitress her name was Christina -she was so sweet."}
{"text":"Excellent crab cakes, service staff.  Valentines dinner was a great experience. 

Shrimp cocktail and asparagus were good.  Really nice portion sizes on the side dishes."}
{"text":"My fianc√© surprised me with dinner at the Monterey Bay last night. Our server Jeffery was absolutely amazing. He was friendly, prompt and very knowledgable of the specials and menu. We had a seat right next to the window so we were able to watch the sun set as we enjoyed dinner. Food was delicious you could tell the fish was fresh. Only downside is that I wish the dinners came with a side or even a salad for the price that you're paying. Definitely would go back again though."}
{"text":"Went here for a business dinner. We were seated in a corner table with amazing views of Pittsburgh, best seat in the house. Service very attentive throughout the meal, really top notch. Food, however, not quite up to par at this price point. Appetizers were not plated such that they could be easily shared and entrees were, by most accounts, on the bland side."}
{"text":"The food was amazing, the views were spectacular, and our waitress was really knowledgeable of the menu and bartenders' specialties. This was by far the best dining experience I've had to date."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I recently went here with my girlfriend. It was the first time I was here since after their renovation. We each had a few cocktails and dinner. The view is second to none, being it is overlooking the city on a high floor in Mt Washington connected to and apartment complex. The server was very knowledgeable about the food and was good to answer any questions we had about the menu. My girlfriend got some sushi. It looked and tasted amazing. She has lived in Florida and Baltimore and she said it was some of the best she's had. Both presentation and taste wise. I got some crab stuffed shrimp which was also amazing. There fresh fish selection is so good. It is always tough for me to pick something because I want it all. If you are having some drinks and dinner, expect to pay at least $150.00. It is well worth it though for a nice dinner out. We live in Mt Washington now, so we will be back."}
{"text":"As a born and raised Pittsburgher, it's astonishing that this was only my 2nd time visiting Monterey Bay. Monterey Bay is an old staple, and has been around for a long time, and it sometimes gets overlooked with all of the new and trendy restaurants in Pittsburgh now. It did not disappoint. Even though I live on Mt. Washington, there's something special about taking the elevator up to the restaurant while observing the city. 

Dinner starts with a delicious selection of bread and a homemade butter. We started with the Kanpachi Seviche. I was shocked at how tasty it was, especially for someone who is a pretty picky seafood eater. One thing to note, this starter has a little kick to it with the jalapenos, but you can easily eat around those if you don't like them.

For my entree, I ordered the Brandied Shrimp Tagliatelle. Delicious sauce, pasta cooked perfectly, and more than enough shrimp. If this is your first visit, you must try their crab cakes as that's their specialty. I was lucky enough to have a taste of my fiance's. 

In addition to delicious food, restaurants that provide top notch service always stand out. Our server, Jane, was amazing. The GM stopped at our table to make sure everything was okay, and that is much appreciated. 

We shared the angel food grilled cheese dessert. Great way to end the meal. Must visit in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"This is a must! For all you seafood lovers out there! The view is amazing, it could not get any better! The food was excellent, and an affordable price:) it was very classy, you will have to dress up~ no
jeans!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend's parents took us here a few days before Christmas and it was just amazing. The ambiance is wonderful and the menu is mouthwatering. The views of the city are beautiful and it was nicely decorated for the holidays. 
There is a kabob fish appetizer that is killer- I believe it was called Ichiban. Amazing. I never saw the wine list as his dad ordered, but both bottles we got were great!

Everyone got a different fish prepared in a different manner. I got scallops with a lobster sauce. It was tasty but SO SALTY, which is why I cannot give 5 stars. Everyone else's meal was really good. The dessert was also amazing! I had the creme brulee which was fantastic, and my boyfriend's mom got a bailey's cookie cheesecake which I could've eaten 5 of! 

Our waiter was SUPER duper attentive- almost annoyingly so, but I know he had good intentions! lol. All in all, it was a wonderful experience and great Saturday night treat. It was pricey, but worth it for a special occasion!"}
{"text":"One of the best, most memorable meals of my life.  We had a party of 10 and everyones dinner was outstanding.  I had the sea bass with red curry and jasmine rice.  I still dream about it."}
{"text":"Until last night,  it had been a while since my husband and I had eaten at Monterey Bay. We had always enjoyed the food. Unfortunately,  that was not the case this time. On a positive note, the server was professional and very attentive; and of course, the view is magnificent. To start, I ordered the Caesar salad which arrived with wilted lettuce that was drenched in a flavorless dressing. For the main course, I decided on the Coq au Vin which proved to be the wrong choice. When the dish came, all I could see was a miniscule piece of chicken drowning in a sea of a heavy dark brown sauce, accompanied by no garnish, nothing. My husband ordered the stuffed shrimp which included 4 petite overcooked shrimp. Needless to say, we were exceedingly disappointed. Again, the view is spectacular, but it's not worth the high price of the lackluster food."}
{"text":"My friend brought me here to celebrate earning my masters degree and a major birthday.  We had a reservation for 5:30 and got the last window table.  You cannot reserve a window table specifically, FYI.  The view here is definitely amazing.  You will be lucky to walk out of here for less than $100/person, but you are definitely paying for the atmosphere as well as good food.

We started out with the Seared Kobe ($25) and a sampler platter that had Ichiban, crab cake, and something else.  The platter was delicious, and we especially loved the crab cake and ichiban.  The seared Kobe was not really my thing.  It is a cold, tender, fatty beef, and while the quality was good, it was too salty for my taste.  The meal also starts with fresh bread and a delicious chive butter that was amazing.  I regret not eating more of the bread.

I ordered the stuffed shrimp ($32) for dinner.  It was four shrimp with plenty of crab and tasted really delicious.  It was one of the best stuffed shrimp meals I have ever eaten.

Sadly, our server was SO rude throughout dinner, and I have no idea what her problem was.  She tried to rush us through the entire meal.  Our appetizer came out 5 minutes after we ordered it, and the entrees about 10 minutes after the appetizer.  When the food came out, it wasn't hot, and we didn't have time to eat it before it got cold.  The server never came back to the table so we asked a manager to heat it up.  He ended up having it remade, which was above and beyond what I expected.  But after he did that, she was even ruder throughout our meal.  It was fairly off-putting.  Luckily, the guy refilling the waters was a gem.  The manager did a great job as well and was really nice, but the server was just inappropriate for this kind of place.

All in all, aside from our weird server, this is a nice place to come for a celebratory dinner."}
{"text":"Dinner was amazing I highly recommend the crab cakes for an appetizer with the house salad to follow. For your entree go with the Caribbean sea bass and a bottle of Jordan cab to go with it. Make sure you save room for dessert bc you ate going to want to try grandmas carrot cake as well as my favorite the Oreo lollipops."}
{"text":"Been here a total of 3 times, all for different occasions. Have been satisfied every time. Probably the best Jumbo Lump crab cakes you can find in Pittsburgh. Freshest of fish, one time I got the Halibut with a mandarin orange finish and it tasted really fresh and very well done. Most recently, I ordered the Mahi Mahi with cranberry sauce and it was also very well prepared and tasted awesome. Every time I stop by, the service is impeccable, i'm always surprised at how much the wait staff have memorized for the every changing menu. I definitely recommend ordering some side dishes, you can't go wrong with a few Oysters on a half shell to start and then some Lobster Mac & Cheese to compliment your meal. Finally, they have a great Dessert menu, twice now i've gotten the White Chocolate Macadamia Mousse, honestly there isn't much better you can do to finish off a wonderful meal. Big enough to share with 2 or 3 too."}
{"text":"One of our all time favorite restaurants. The seafood quality here is the best I have ever had. We usually do a few appetizers and then default to tuna for dinner. Desserts are also phenomenal. The wine menu is pretty broad, with most starting in the $50s. Both food and service are always very consistent. The restaurant overlooks the three rivers and is probably one of the best views in the city."}
{"text":"This place is definitely worth the higher price you pay.  The view is amazing and the salmon was the best cooked salmon I have ever had.  We started with the calamari, which was extremely tasty. The portions of the main course were great (huge piece of fish).  We also had a \"shareable\" side.. which is most definitely shareable!  Everything we ate was phenomenal.  To top it off, the view is stunning, and the atmosphere is wonderful."}
{"text":"I've been here twice for two special occasions and I've been highly satisfied each time. All the guests I brought with me were blown away by the view and the food. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I haven't been in here in almost 10 years and it's just like I remember it.  The food is still excellent, the view is still gorgeous and the decor is exactly the same.  I would give the restaurant five stars on food and view alone but the place just feels so outdated and needs a face lift.  The giant bubbly fish tank when you walk in, the faux palm trees on the ceiling, the dark and dingy entrance way before you take the elevator up....

but on to the positives.  I went here for lunch and it wasn't crowded at all so we got a great window seat.  I ordered the rodi grille salmon with a side of green beans in a sweet chili sauce.  The salmon comes in a teriyaki sauce and was grilled to perfection.  I also ordered a glass of the Riesling and it was on the sweeter side but really good.  For dessert, I opted for the birthday cake cheesecake and it went beyond my expectations.  If you don't have a sweet tooth then this dessert isn't for you because I'm pretty sure I got a sugar high.  It was a cheesecake with birthday cake layers.  The icing was delicious and it looked a bit like a mini confetti birthday cake.  YUM!

I also sampled the crab cakes that my coworker ordered, which they are known for.  Fabulous.  All in all, good experience although I'll issue fair warning that it's a pricey meal even if you opt out of wine and dessert.  Good service, awesome food, I just can't get past that awful outdated 80s decor....."}
{"text":"Delicious food! Great service. The fish is really great, nicely cooked and very delicious.

Their iced tea is really great too.

We had mac and cheese with bacon and I think pumpkin in it which was amazing. 

The view is wonderful. Super happy overall with this restaurant."}
{"text":"The food was amazing - very fresh and well balanced. The service was even better! Shane took care of us and literally made us feel like we were the only ones in the restaurant. He is so pleasant & warm. So genuine in his delivery & recommendations. Ask for him when you're here!"}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to go here to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary. First and foremost its killer views of Pittsburgh, we managed to get a window set, just amazing views. Now the service was very good, what I would expect for fine dining, the decor felt like a throwback to the 80s, the place needs a serious remodel, I notice these things being a contractor. The food is average and way way way overpriced! First I ordered oysters on the half shell, there where 6 oysters literally the size of a dime for $18, next came the lobster bisque, it was good, I've had much better for half the price, then came the scallops on a bed of gtits and some fried okra which was a signature dish of the chef, I could have swore the waiter said there was 6 that came with the meal, it came out with 4  for $38, are you kidding me? I assume because of the view of Pittsburgh it allows them to seriously overcharge for everything.    I love eating fine dining and I expect to pay for the experience, service and atmosphere that comes with fine dining, but I also expect outstanding food and reasonable portions, this was very average and terribly small portions for the price, oh and I forgot about the really bad and very small cup of coffee at the end of the meal that had obviously been sitting for awhile, $3 for 1 cup, folks there are much better fine dining restaurants around town than this one, although the view is still killer here."}
{"text":"Filet mignon was great and the night view was tooooooo awesome! The atmosphere in the restaurant was romantic!!"}
{"text":"I had my husband take me to Monterey Bay Fish Grotto for our wedding anniversary. We rode the inclines up and down Mount Washington to get to and from the restaurant. We were lucky enough to get a seat in the restaurant near a window. We did not have much of a view of the downtown area, because those tables were already taken, but we still had a very good view of the stadium, rivers, etc. We had difficulty selecting our appetizers and entrees because the menu had such a vast selection of fish. Eventually we made up our minds. The food did taste good. I appreciated that the restaurant gave my husband and me a free dessert to share because of our anniversary."}
{"text":"Came here after going up the Duquesne Incline. Had drinks and appetizers at the bar. Drinks were excellent as well as the appetizers. The main thing about this place....the view. It is spectacular!"}
{"text":"***This review is for the angel food grilled cheese sandwich--I enjoyed dessert but not a full meal here.***

During the five years that I lived in Pittsburgh, I rarely made it up to Mt. Washington.  Because of the stunning views, however, I made sure that my last meal in PGH was there.  I was able to try not one but *two* of the high-end restaurants on the Duquesne Heights side, and Monterey Bay Fish Grotto was one of them.

Having heard that the angel food grilled cheese was reputed to be the best restaurant dessert in PGH, and given that I have a serious sweet tooth (hence my Bakery Queen status), I knew I needed to try it before I flew the coop for good.  Although my dining partner and I were quite full from dinner, a hearty walk on the trail leading down--and subsequently up--the mountain freed up some precious stomach real estate.  I asked my dining partner if we could get dessert at Monterey Bay so I could try the angel food grilled cheese and he agreed, so we ascended the elevator and took a seat in the lounge by the bar.

When we asked for a dessert menu, our waitress explained that the angel food grilled cheese ($10) was their signature dessert, but I required no convincing because I'd already done my research, as usual.  When it came, it looked exactly as the photos of it I'd seen had led me to believe that it would look--beautifully plated and scrumptious!  The pound cake bread was bruleed (toasted?) using a blowtorch, just like a creme brulee, and its warmth and softness complemented the cooler, creamy sweetened cream cheese interior.  It was served with a flavorful berry compote that was well-balanced in its sweet-tartness, as well as a scoop of vanilla ice cream that provided a chilled, creamy foil.  The entire dish was sprinkled with toasted almond slivers, and was garnished by a sprig of fresh mint leaves.

The variety of flavors and textures was everything I'd hoped for--and more!  The variations in sweetness between the different components, as well as the textures ranging from soft and airy to smooth and creamy to light and crunchy, made every bite fascinating.  Without a doubt, I agree that it's easily the best restaurant dessert in PGH, and it rivals Prantl's burnt as PGH's most unique and delicious dessert.

My dining partner ordered the chocolate torte ($9), which also had a nice variety of flavors and textures, though it wasn't nearly as extensive.  It reminded me of a similar dessert I had at Bartram House Bakery near the South Side Works, but the ingredients and overall product were superior in quality.  If you're a diehard fan of dark chocolate and can't fathom the idea of a dessert without chocolate, it's worth a try.  If you're adventurous like me, however, get the angel food grilled cheese and don't look back!

As I'd expect at a restaurant of this caliber, service was knowledgeable and attentive yet unobtrusive, and had the class not to play hooky (no pun intended!) upon learning we were dessert only customers.  Aside from the food and service, the obvious selling point is the view, which was quite unique from our vantage point.  From where we were seated, we had an unobstructed view of both the front and back of the mountain, which was quite unique and special.  Looking out at the twinkling lights of the city skyline one last time from my comfortable chair while enjoying a unique and delicious dessert, for a few magical moments, I felt like a high roller rather than a lowly postdoctoral researcher, endowing me with a special lasting memory of my final evening as a resident of Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"A classic Pittsburgh dining experience with the most amazing views of the city. On the top of Mount Washington you have one of the best seafood restaurants in the city of Steele. Food is always fantastic, the atmosphere busy, loud and welcoming. This is an ideal place to take clients for dinner, or a business dinner. Also not a bad spot for date night. Do what you can to get a table with a view, or at least grab a drink in the bar enjoy the views of downtown Pittsburgh and the rivers. The food is outstanding. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Always enjoy our dinners at Monterrey and the views are amazing.  

Here's the secret... Eat downstairs in the lounge area.  It's quaint, you have the same menu and amazing views! Oh and it's quieter too."}
{"text":"I've been gluten free for the past few years, and people are always asking what I miss the most. It's probably a good crab cake. Most crab cakes have bread crumbs or something to hold it all together. Monterey Bay knows how to do it right without the gluten. You do have to tell them when you order, but they are friendly to people with allergies or special diets. (I guess they should be very friendly at that price point).

Or course, the view is wonderful too, and there's not a bad seat in here. The restaurant is tiered so there's tons of great views of the city. Try to catch a sunset up here for dinner. It's certainly a site to see. I can't tell you too much about the food since we always order the crab cakes! So - I'd highly recommend getting them!"}
{"text":"ask the server for a favorite...when I went I had a \"blackened\" fish entree and it was like eating charcoal. Others at the table all said there food was excellent so I must have made a poor choice. Don't order anything blackened and you'll probably be happy."}
{"text":"The seafood here is DELICIOUS and FRESH and FLAVORFUL. The portions are reasonable and we probably over ordered on the appetizers and side dishes, but our eyes were bigger than our stomachs. They were able to sit us close enough to the table, since we had a big party and see some of the views. We had friends from out of town and wanted to show off parts of Pittsburgh to them.

We started with the crab cakes, tuna sashimi and mussels HK style. The crab cakes were the BEST and LEGIT all crab. I could skip the mussels and tuna for next time. The wasabi on the tuna was really potent and the mussels weren't plump this time of the year. I had the black cod sable fish and it was perfectly cooked. Each bite was filled with happiness and the meat was just a perfect combination of tenderness, juiciness and joy. The waiter service was friendly and played along our jokes. All of the other dishes of fish were also delectable. We're big sharers at this table. For the sides, we got the pumpkin risotto, brussel sprouts, lobster mac n cheese and sauteed greens. The risotto was great with a little bit of sweetness. The mac and cheese was well done with a hint of lobster. I didn't enjoy the brussel sprouts as they were too soft for me. I would definitely come back for more."}
{"text":"Super overpriced food and wine, but wasn't terrible so it's ok. The Views were breathtaking and loved the romantic ambiance. We were lucky enough to get window seating and UGH it was amazing. My two favorite things in the world: views and wine. The food wasn't the best, but everything else made up for it.

Ordered:
x ROCKFISH (parmesan coated, lemon peppercorn cream sauce) - yummyyyy. I love fish and this was so different than what I'm used to eating. 
x GRILLED WEDGE (baby iceberg, smoked blue cheese, pickled red onions, pancetta, sriracha red peppers) - A little too much dressing for my liking, but wedge salads are my favorite! I always feels like its extra fresh.
x Brussel Sprouts - Too mushy, but the flavors were AMAZING!! Brussel sprouts are one of my favorite veggies :0)
x ANGEL FOOD GRILLED CHEESE SANDWICH (caramelized angel food cake, cream cheese filling, seasonal berry compote, vanilla ice cream, toasted sweet and salty almonds) - I'm not the biggest fan of desserts, especially in restaurants as I prefer to devour a box of chocolates instead... but this was super yummy! I love angel food cake! We shared and still did finish it.

Cute date night spot. We took the trolly up and it made the experience that much better :0)"}
{"text":"This restaurant has a great view of the city from pretty much every table.  We took the incline up, and the restaurant is only about a 5 minute walk from the top.  We were 30 minutes early, unsure of how long it would take to get to the incline and up to the top so they had us wait in the bar until our table was ready.  The bar has a great view of the city too, and it took only about 10 minutes for them to get our table ready. 

The service was very good, however, our table was in an awkward spot.  There were two tables with large parties behind us, so they had expanded those tables making the waiters and waitress' jobs difficult, often squeezing between my chair and the chair behind me.  It seemed like our table could have been moved to accommodate the large parties and the service lanes needed.  (the first chair I sat in also had a nail sticking out, but since there were 4 chairs and only 3 of us, i switched chairs and let our server know). 

We had the Ichiban, crab cakes and jumbo shrimp for a starter and all were delicious. We all had different kinds of fish ( salmon, rockfish, halibut) which were great.  The salmon was good, but I like it more well done and it was rare in the middle.  

For desert, we had the chocolate latte cake (which may be one of my favorite deserts ever) and the key lime tarte.

I would recommend this restaurant to anyone for a fancy dinner, with a beautiful view."}
{"text":"An incredible dining experience overall.  Great food, great service (thanks Kayla), and fantastic views.  I was disappointed in how the mgr dealt with a minor issue.  They served a dessert wo the listed ice cream.  I realized that a few bites into it.  I ment I need it and Kayla said their ice cream had melted and she just found out when she picked it up.  I would have expected a restaurant to ask if I still wanted it before serving it.  So I asked for a discount and they said their policy was they don't discount food. What?   Is it also their policy to occasionally not serve items as listed?  It was a minor issue but it really bugged me how they handled it.  They did offer me a free tree or cappuccino.  Bit that aside I would highly recommend the restaurant."}
{"text":"summary: the spectacular view will distract you from the food anyway.

The food is actually not bad. As long as the fish is fresh, it's hard to go really wrong (just forgo the over-priced desserts). The kitchen can be uneven when busy (e.g., overcooked tuna or lukewarm side dishes on separate visits). But the staff seem eager to help if you bring the problems to their attention.

The restaurant strives for an upscale dining ambiance, and their success is, in no small part, thanks to the lovely view. The service is attentive, if a bit overly scripted/rehearsed.

Good for business meals (especially when you're not sure what everyone likes, and when someone else is picking up the tabs).

3.5 stars"}
{"text":"This restaurant is my absolute favorite restaurant on mt. washington.
They not only have amazing food, but they also have stunning view, exotic interior, and tasty cocktails. 

FOOD - I have tried many fish dishes and almost all appetizers and I was never disappointed. However, I didnt really like their steaks. Also, their cocktails are all great(flavorful and not so strong). Oh and one thing I hated that I had was their lobster bisque. It was too salty, so we asked them if they could make it less salty, but we still couldnt eat it because it was way too salty.

SERVICE - I went there for my friends' bdays and my anniversary, and every time, they gave us free desserts with special writings on them. Also, servers frequently ask us if we need anything, and they are pretty quick and very friendly.

AMBIANCE - its a great place for big groups, couples, and families in special events."}
{"text":"I had a wonderful evening, it was far more than I expected.  First I took the incline up from the Sheraton on Wednesday evening last week.  It was a short walk from the station.  I was pleasantly surprised to find upon entering I would be taking an elevator UP further to the restaurant the view from the elevator was even more spectacular than from the incline.  The place was busy but the hostess told me I could enjoy the same view and menu from the bar.  The view there did not disappoint, nor did the staff.  I found out about this place from the cab driver that drove me to the hotel from the airport, he raved about the crab cake being better than the ones in MD.  I did try the crab cake as an appetizer, it was very good, delicious, not as good as one from Faidleys but it was very good, quite tasty.  The bar staff was very receptive, very helpful in my wine selections.  I had a brut with my crab cake and a Murphy Goode sauvignon  blanc with a grilled salmon with their house remoulade and a side of broccollini.  It was perfect and the wine suited the meal.  Did I mention the view?  from my seat in the bar it was great.  I also want to comment that one of the staff, maybe a sommelier came down, popped open a bottle of wine and asked the bartender and wait staff to taste it, think about the flavors and he'd be back to discuss.  I really enjoyed listening to him and the staff interact and learn something they could share with a future customer about a bottle of wine.  Anyway, the staff was pleasant, view was magnificent and well worth the walk a mile down to the other incline to take me back to the Sheraton.  If I ever come back to downtown Pittsburgh, I will definitely stop and bring others up to this great place."}
{"text":"Holy fancy pants Batman! This dish cost as much as my last pair of pants! ...but it was delicious.

Like many others, we dined here for a special occasion meal. The view is spectacular. The prices are too. The menu is comprehensive (assuming you're here for fish). The decor is totally Miami 80s...complete with a large, lit water tank with bubbles and if memory serves me correctly, jungle leaf motifs all over the carpet. For the prices, you would think they would update the decor. Whatever...onto the food!

The crab cakes are all crab, no filler, and completely delicious. The oysters were totally disappointing. We had better oysters that afternoon at the shadyside market than we did at Monterey...and the shadyside ones cost $1 a pop. All the fish dishes were good. My macadamia encrusted halibut was delicious. The vegetable sides were totally disappointing and appeared to have little thought or effort put into them. I understand if they were going for simple and fresh, but even if that was their intent they missed the mark. They were bland and uninspired. The salads were good and the desserts were good, but not to die for. The fancier cocktails were good to meh.

Our waiter was wonderful. He was a great fine dining waiter with all the bells and whistles, yet he was not stuffy or condescending. He knew how to relax and help his table relax. He made our dining experience great."}
{"text":"Highest level dining experience, top 3 steak all-time

Travelled to Pittsburgh and wanted to try a fine dining establishment.  Monterey Bay fish grotto came up so made reservations.  Valet is a must in the dense Mt. Washington district, but not a big deal at all.  Because you are literally on a mountain overlooking downtown pittsburgh, the view from the restaurant is breathtaking.  There was a concert with all kinds of funky lights and after the baseball game fireworks!

  The food was absolutely delicious and the waiter did a great job.  The steak I had was among the top 3 best I have had all-time at a restaurant.  Their crabcake was delightful as well.  A great dining experience that I wouldn't hesitate to repeat."}
{"text":"The view of the city Pittsburgh, and the food are AMAZING! the best part is that the valet parking is only $7!"}
{"text":"Great view, great food, and great service. Upon arriving, there is a $7 valet service, which was nice. And the view up on Mt. Washington is beautiful. Then we took the elevator ride up, with an open view. But there is only one small elevator, which is very slow. We were there to celebrate a graduation dinner, and we had a nice time. The food is very expensive, but delicious! The sides are large and serve 2-4 people. I highly recommend the lobster Mac n cheese and the Kanpavhi Seviche. I ordered the Chilean Sea Bass with Chimichurri and it was really good. It didn't wow me, but it was definitely very good. I took a bite of the Brandied Tagliatelle with chicken instead of the shrimp, which was fantastic. However, there was too much fatty pieces of chicken in the dish. Also, I don't usually like crab cakes but my boyfriend ordered it and it was actually delicious! I think I ate too much bread and butter before my dinner because the butter was some of the best butter I have had... it was sweet and flavorful. Overall, we had a wonderful dinner and I highly recommend Monterrey Bay for any special occasion. Afterwards, the valet was super nice and willingly took a few photos for us outside."}
{"text":"The fish is OK, given the expectations. Their crabcake is their signature item, and is DELICIOUS; make sure to try it."}
{"text":"We went here to celebrate our anniversary from out of town and it was a fabulous experience. Not only did we get a great view, the food was spectacular. I had the Parmesan Rockfish and it was perfectly delicious. My husband got the Port Tuna and it was a heart fulfilling meal. We got the special Crab and Lobster Macaroni & Cheese and it was delicious as well. Our meal was very fulfilling but we made room for the should be famous Angel Food Grilled Cheese Sandwich. Every bite was simply amazing!!! One MUST try if one dines here, simple must! 

Overall, a great experience from valet parking and wait services. Our waitress Caitlyn and manager Rob were great company with their expertise. Thank you for an amazing experience, we would definitely come back if were in town."}
{"text":"Come for the views, come back for the food.  Monterey Bay is hands down one of the best restaurants in Pittsburgh and one of the best seafood places anywhere!

The crab cakes and stuffed scallops are phenomenal and the staff is very knowledgable and attentive.  If you're looking for an unforgettable experience, you can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"This is a great experience holistically.  Have your car valeted.  It's only $4.  Very affordable.  The elevator up to the Grotto gives you a great view of the city.  When you make your reservations, you need to ask for \"view seating\" but outside of that, getting a reservation is seamless.  You can reserve online through their website.

I went with a mentor/colleague to \"celebrate\" a job termination (don't ask) and we had the whole experience.  Our waitress was very nice and tentative.  One of the managers, who is a wine afficianto, helped us pick out a good wine on the moderately priced side.  The wine was fantastic.  

We ordered steamed clams as an appetizer and -oh so good- with their hot bread to dip in the sauce.  The manager learned I lost my job and brought us a \"chocolate cake\" drink, on the house, which was very nice.  

House salads were fresh and a nice size portyion.  I ordered the mahi mahi and it was fantastic.  Nice size portion, fresh.  Only complaint was that the lemon wedge was too small to put over the fish...

Finally, the dessert...  I had the white chocolate macadamia mousse.  To. die. for.

Certainly the restaurant is pricey, but the food quality was good, the atmosphere is nice, and the staff are very friendly.  This is a good special occasion restaurant."}
{"text":"Best view on Mt. W.   Let's be honest, this is on the top of Mt. W. AND on top of a 8 story building.  So yes, it has the best view among restaurants in that area.  
Sitting-arrangement-wise, if you have the downtown view window side, that's great.  The middle-of-the-room view is not as good.  So it's like 4 tables out of the entire restaurant get a perfect view, the rest are just \"ok\" view.  Overall, Altius has better table arrangement with like 75% getter a great view.

food-wise, we had their oysters before, it was great.  Ali-tuna comes in both starter size and dinner size.  We like their starter size better. (maybe a different chef the other day, maybe just a better fish(?))

They have some of the best fish in town, most of them are great.  Salmon, tuna, trout...  
Crab cake was better than average. (sorry, the best goes to Philly's XIX Nineteen.)
Scallops were great. recommended.

Sidenote, if you like sashimi fish and ok with them raw, get \"rare\" instead of \"medium-rare\" for their grilled fish.  A friend and I had a rare and medium-rare salmon side-by-side and we both agreed the \"rare\" one was better.

Their house special - Angel Food Grilled Cheese Sandwich is a must try.  (5/5), go for it."}
{"text":"they were very accommodating for a vegan diet, all 3 course were wonderful with no trouble. they made me a special vegan risotto...one of the best dinners of my life"}
{"text":"Gotta give it 5 stars.
Service was the best. Rae helped me to arrange a dinner for our CMU 50th reunion.
We arranged for separate checks for the various parties. They did it perfectly. Everything was smooth from the seating us in the cocktail lounge as guests arrived, to giving us a great location so that we had a beautiful view the entire dinner, to giving us an excellent server.
We all enjoyed our dinners. Side dishes were ample to allow sharing.
Valet was helpful.
Next time we're back in Pittsburgh, we'll be back."}
{"text":"My bf took me for my birthday this year, and I really enjoyed it. The views were ahhhmazing and the interior decor was fun and classy at the same time. There was a little mix-up when we first arrived, however - they gave us a buzzer to wait for our table and we went down to the bar (which also has amazing views). I guess they forgot about us because when we went upstairs to check on our table 45 minutes later, they looked surprised and apologized and seated us immediately.  

We ordered the crab cake appetizer (highly recommend the crab cakes, in fact, probably recommend just getting the crab cake entree). I got the seared ahi tuna stuffed with goat cheese, mushrooms, and spinach.  Honestly, cheese and ahi tuna dont belong together, but once i moved all the cheese to the side it was a really good entree. It was all expensive: for an appetizer, a (cheaper) bottle of wine, 2 entrees, 1 dessert, the bill came out to around $200, eek.  All in all, I would definitely return for another special occasion."}
{"text":"This place doesn't deserve five stars. Three is about right.

In short: the view is excellent but the food is merely good. If you want a view, come here, but if you want great fish, I'd recommend other places, such as Casbah, Park Bruges, or Umi.

At Monterey Bay, I had the trout almondine, which they promised to be lightly sauteed, but I found it to be overcooked and heavy with butter that left an oily aftertaste in my mouth. The caesar salad and dessert I shared were good but not great. When this place wins best seafood and similar awards, it's not for the food, but for the view.

Our meals were about $53 per person including tip, but without drinks."}
{"text":"This is a great place for the view, the romantic ambiance, and the service.  The food, unfortunately, is hit-or-miss - especially considering the price.

We had a reservation at 9:30 on a busy night.  Fortunately, the dining rush was dying down by then and we were quickly seated by a corner table (tables on the northeast side will get you a better view of the Pittsburgh skyline).  The waiters were friendly and courteous, and the manager came out to deliver our wine selection.  True to the restaurant's name, the menu featured a copious selection of fish.  (I'm pretty sure that being at the top of a tall building on top of a hill overlooking a city is the opposite of being a grotto, though.)

We started with a sampler of various appetizers that included shrimp, crab cakes, and a fish skewer.  These all had great flavor and texture and paired well with their respective sauces.

I had the whole bronzini classically prepared with tomatoes, onions, capers, and olives.  The kitchen delivered a solid performance on this one - crispy skin with tender flesh and a good balance of flavors.  I managed to sneak a few bites of my date's lemon sole, which was unfortunately overdone and in want of a sauce.  If you don't mind eating whole fish, that's what I would recommend - it's much harder to screw up the preparation.

We shared the chai tea cake for dessert, which was also perfectly acceptable.  There were many interesting choices available, though, and we had a hard time deciding.

Moral of the story - this is a great place for a fancier date or night out, but don't expect amazing food.  Oh, and the wine list is fairly extensive and expensive, even by fancy restaurant mark-up standards."}
{"text":"I read a lot of reviews and, yes, you do pay a premium for the view but the sashimi preparation of the ahi tuna was fantastic and I gladly paid for the view.  Ride the Duquesne Incline for the full experience!  The host and server both did a great job and I'd recommend the MBFG to anyone visiting the 'burgh!"}
{"text":"Monterey Bay lives up to its reputation as an amazing restaurant that has a great view. Or is it a restaurant with a great view that has amazing food? Either way, you can't go wrong with anything on the menu (Butternut Squash Bisque over lobster, Crab stuffed jumbo scallops,etc). It's pricey but worth it."}
{"text":"This review is somewhat curt because Firefox crashed on me before it autosaved, and I'm too lazy to retype everything.
-----------------------------------------

Simply an amazing dining experience. 

Went for a dinner with my girlfriend, and we arrived around 30 minutes past our reservation time, but they were very courteous about it. Our server was knowledgeable and courteous and made the night a very enjoyable experience. 

All the food was amazing, but the crab cakes were ridiculous, so much so that I feel the need to comment. Usually I avoid crab cakes at restaurants, because you get some stringy crab meat mixed with bread mixed with generic mixed vegetables (read: defrosted peas, carrots, and corn), which has been the case even in fancy upscale restaurants. In fact, I only got the crab cake because it was part of the appetizer sampler. This turned out to be very fortunate for me, because the crab cake was huge chunks of tender, juicy lump crab meat, loosely held together, with nary a defrosted frozen vegetable in sight. Truly amazing.

The Irish coffee is a tad too strong for my liking; it was more like drinking shots with a bit of coffee rather than the other way around.

The view is the best in Pittsburgh. Make sure you get the side facing Heinz Field and downtown.

I would absolutely recommend it to everyone."}
{"text":"I just ate at Monterey Bay Fish Grotto for the first time this past weekend as part of a wedding party reheresal dinner.  Let me just mention that I hate seafood and seafood restaurants most of the time because I find them to be stinky!  This was place did not smell fishy at all!  The service was excellent!  I had the half chicken with rice and mixed veggies.  It was FANTASTIC!  Other people who did order fish raved about the crab cakes and the sword fish.  After dinner we sampled a few different types of desserts and I highly recommend the New York style cheesecake- it was the best cheese cake that I have ever had!  We were accomodated with a small private room for the rehersal dinner and had a fanstastic view of the city.  I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Cajun snapper, stuffed tuna, she-crab bisque - awesome. Don't get the lobster mac (I know this sounds counterintuitive, trust me.)  It's the worst mac and cheese I've had, ever. A greasy mess.  Don't they know how to make a roux?"}
{"text":"Located in Duquesne Heights, you must visit this restaurant.  If for nothing else, just the night time view of downtown Pittsburgh.  It was wonderful.  There is an upper and a lower level to this restaurant.  The upper-level is fairly pretentious and filled with lots of glitz and suits.  The lower-level is where the bar is located and it contains a small amount of window seating.  Many people go to sit upstairs.  Why?  I don't know.  It is so bright and contrived and you cannot get a very good view.  I prefer the darker lower level where people are more down to earth and real and the fact that you can actually see the city lit up at night. Don't let the coat check fool you.  If you feel uncomfortable, just head to the lower level.

We were greeted by our server and handed the menus.  We were able to look through and asked our server for her suggestions.  We placed our order for the recommended  appetizer that was not on the menu: 

Combo Platter: Ichiban (tuna, salmon, and swordfish grilled on a skewer), Crabcake, and Cajun shrimp

I was continually distracted by the view.  You can see the Duquesne Incline, the Southside, Downtown and the Northside and it is amazing how the night coupled with lit buildings can create such a sublime and dramatic image on the horizon -- Beautiful.   I had to focus, though, and was ready for our server when she returned with the appetizer:

French onion soup
Butternut squash soup
Mahi mahi with garlic- feta mashed potatoes
Yellow fin tuna with, garlic-feta mashed potatoes, and tomatoes with balsamic vinaigrette

The tri-partite appetizer combined three of the more popular appetizers on the written menu.  I was quite glad they had this option tonight since I would have been very disappointed to have ordered the Ichiban and the Cajun shrimp as their own dish.  Both were not great and were lacking in flavor.  The fish cubes on the Ichiban skewer were somewhat tough and overcooked with very little flavor.  The shrimp were slightly rubbery and did not taste Cajun.  The price of this appetizer was only $1 more than the crab cake appetizer.  The crab cake was quite good.  It is the best crab cake I have had in the Pittsburgh area.  It was well cooked, moist, tasted of lump crab and had minimal filler.

As we were finishing the appetizer the soups and tomatoes appeared.  My butternut squash soup came in a two-part series to preserve the scant heat in the soup itself and to protect the crab that came at the bottom of my bowl.  The soup was poured over the seeds and crab at the table.  It tasted very good, but unfortunately it cooled rather quickly -- this is on of the issues with Creme Fraiche, you cannot over heat or it will curdle.  I thoroughly enjoyed the flavor of the squash in the smooth soup coupled with the fresh crab, pumpkin seed, and creme fraiche.  The French Onion soup had a good flavor. Not over-seasoned, the onions were actually cooked, and a good consomme as its base.  

Our dinners arrived and I was surprised by the size.  The portions were quite large for both entrees and one could have easily been split between two people.  A bit apprehensive after the Ichiban, I tried the tuna to find that the flavor was much better for the entree.  The same held true for the mahi-mahi.  The tuna was cooked to a nice medium rare, had good texture and flavor and was not filled with gristle.  The mahi-mahi was tender, moist, and flavorful.  The blackening seasoning had a good flavor and was mildly piquant.  

I moved on to the mashed potatoes and my tomatoes.  There was just a hint of the feta and garlic in the potatoes that complimented the potatoes very well.  The tomatoes were good and the vinaigrette was also tasty.  I do wish that they would have used a better oil and vinegar, though.  The oil was a cheaper brand without much flavor and the balsamic was fairly weak, but with good flavor.  

Unable to finish our meals, we decided that we wouldn't bother with desserts.  Next time -- and there will be a next time -- the appetizer will be crab cake only and we will be splitting a meal.  With more than enough food for two, this will also cut the bill considerably.  I will continue to sit on the lower level and I hope that I get our server again."}
{"text":"OhEmGee... possibly the best meal ever. Where do I start? The view. Insane. Incredible. Cannot be beat. Overlooking one of the most beautiful cityscapes that I've ever seen. 

The service:  Cannot be beat. We started in the lounge for drinks and appetizer. (Did I mention the view?)  Very friendly, professional, courteous service. I had the Salted Caramel, my friends had wine, The Gentleman, and The French Kiss. All were delicious. 

We moved upstairs for window-side dinner reservations, where we enjoyed fantastic service. The manager stopped by several times to make sure all was going well. 

The food:  Holy shit, the best. I had the Chilean Sea Bass (macadamia), which was cooked to perfection. Perfection. Collectively we had Brussel sprouts, lobster mac & cheese, and crab mac & cheese. My friends ate stuffed scallops, surf and turf, and I cannot remember what else. All were delicious. 

Highly highly highly recommend. I will be back."}
{"text":"Fish, Fish, ch- and more Fish. This place has fish. if you like fish come here. The restaurant itself has an astounding view of Pittsburgh. It is definitely a fancier restaurant. Very few people come in with jeans on... The service was pretty good the server and manager did a lot of advising to navigate us through their tremendous menu. IT WAS HUGE- how am I supposed to know what to choose from?!?! 

Venue is a pristine and clean they do a tremendous job making it look good. Elevator takes you to the dining hall after you valet your vehicle. 

Food portions were small. but tasty we got the swordfish and yellowfin tuna in a Parmesan and mango curry sautees. They tasted very good, I would go with parmesean over mango in hindsight. we got a deliciously soup, that was also quite salty. And the rolls- they were astounding. we got a skewer appatizer with an array of different fish, which was good but entirely too small. 

This is a nice classy place to come to celebrate something with somebody special, has a killer view, and well cooked food. 

Still it is not the best fish I have had- i would give it 3.5 stars.

Next time i will try the lounge right below the upper level."}
{"text":"Excellent night out.  Met friends here to celebrate.  The renovations are beautiful.  The (tacky) palm tree decor is gone and now it's all clean, with modern accents.  The tables are now all carefully tiered so that the skyline is viewable from all seats (nice touch).

I had the ahi tuna, medium rare, done sashimi style, with a black sesame seed crust, wasabi and brown sauce, topped with pickled ginger.  It was carefully prepared, well portioned and elegantly plated.  Easily the best fish I ever had.

Ambiance was great (good place to impress) and the service was good.  Only complaint is that the tables are a bit too big for the booths, making them feel a bit cramped."}
{"text":"Took myself on a date here since I was in Pittsburgh for a night traveling solo. Had a nighttime reservation for dinner. Great service, was seated promptly upon arrival and got the perfect window seat and a table to myself. Beautiful view of the river and city skyline! Classy, romantic atmosphere- highly recommend this for a date or special occasion. Tried the crab cake which they're known for, per waiters recommendation and was not dissappointed- it was broiled, and made up of real juicy chunks of crab. The sauce complemented it well. For my cocktail I ordered the pepino diablo, jalape√±o infused tequila with cilantro cucumber and lime juice- slightly spicy and delicious! Also waiters recommendation (he has good taste). For dessert ordered the chocolate latte, chocolate flourless cake with cinnamon and chocolate steam. Would love to come back here!"}
{"text":"I came here for a birthday of a friend of mine.  We ordered the mussels as an appetizer.  We sent them back as they were way too fishy tasting.  Yuck.  But we got the Lemon Sole and the Shrimp and Scallop Fettuccine.  The Orange Basil Halibut was just OK and lacked much flavor.  The Shrimp and Scallop Fettuccine was OK as well.  However, the scallops were a bit sandy (I hate sand in my seafood!) and the shrimp had an overpowering taste of iodine.  However, the pasta itself, was great!  Also, our server was phenomenal, I just wish the food was a little bit better. 

This place is great for the view though.  I suggest if it's a busy night reservation wise, try to get a table down at the bar, as the view is just as great down there and less unobstructed."}
{"text":"I had a salad with baked chevre, mixed greens, cranberries and balsamic vinegarette on the side.  It was very yummy!  Good portion size too~ 

Then for my main course I ordered the New England clam chowder special... mmm~ bad choice.  It was clam chowder poured table-side over pork belly and one whole shell-in clam.  First of all, the table-side presentation might sound like a good idea, but when you have gritty yellowish clam chowder coming out of a tiny tea kettle spout... it's not that appetizing.  I decided to be open minded and try it~ and i get blech grits in my mouth.  Where's the creamy white clam chowder I expected?!  ugh~~ not cool.  

I couldn't lie when the waitress asked me if I liked my meal, so she took it back and instead I got a steamed latte dessert!  Oh it made up for the nasty clam chowder~  It was a chocolate souffle topped with fresh whipped cream and a cute chocolate piece that looked like steam coming from the ginormous coffee cup.

The dessert and the amazing view from the restaurant saved me experience.  If it weren't for the clam chowder, I would've given it 4 stars."}
{"text":"Went here for a business dinner tonight.  The location is great - top of an apartment building at the top of Mt. Washington.  View was fabulous, but would have been better if they washed the windows.  My companion and I split an appetizer, each had a salad and entree with no wine and the tab came to $125.  I very much enjoyed the meal, and it was way more than I could eat, even though I didn't have lunch today.  I had the stuffed tuna which was very good but a bit over cooked and swimming in a heavy brown sauce and mushrooms.  The fresh string beans also came with their own heavy cream sauce.  

I would have given this 3-stars, but when I returned to my hotel I had to rush to the restroom several times...."}
{"text":"Me and a friend arrived early for dinner so hostess seated us at the window. Wonderful view!!!! We ordered fried calamari, crab cake and scallops, lobster mac and cheese and coconut rice! The coconut rice, lobster mac and cheese, and fried calamari come in portions that can be shared comfortably with 2-3 people. The service was good. Didn't have to ask for refills as they have wait staff always looking out for that kind of stuff"}
{"text":"This was our 3rd time visiting Pittsburgh, and our 3rd time at Monterey Bay Fish Grotto.  Just like the prior 2 times, it was excellent.  Great food, very good service, and spectacular views of the city.  You can't go wrong with this place."}
{"text":"I made NYE reservations to celebrate my fiance's birthday, 12/31.  We arrived at about 4:30pm and our reservation was for 5pm.  We had a drink downstairs, which was very nice and warm, I must say.  

When our buzzer went off, we headed upstairs and were seated at a 4-top table by the window.  Beautiful view of our city!!!  Diante (sp?) was our server and he was fantastic the whole night!  

We started off with the appetizer trio, which included 1 lump crabmeat, a skewer of tuna, salmon and swordfish and a couple shrimp.  Everything was so succulant and delicious!

For our 2nd course, we both had a salad with fresh bread and a specially made whipped butter.  He had a caesar and I had a house salad, both very good!!

For our main course, we both ordered the Surf n Turf, which consisted of 6oz filet and 6oz lobster tail stuffed with a lobster cake.  Let me just say that the filet and lobster were the best I have ever had.  Filet was cooked perfectly as was the lobster.  Also, there was broccolini with hollandaise sauce.  The only thing I would have change would be for the broccolini to be cooked more.  It was a little hard, even to cut with a steak knife.  

For his \"free\" birthday dessert, he got the carrot cake and I ordered the Meyer Lemon Ice Box Pie, which was outstanding."}
{"text":"I came here last night with my rents to celebrate my mom's birthday, and it was a disappointing experience overall! The view and service both get 5 stars, but the food was mediocre at best.  

We started with two apps:  the Calamari & the Mussels (Limoncello style).  Both were \"eh\".  The Calamari was soggy and greasy, BUT the dipping sauces that accompanied the dish were tasty.  The mussels were ok - the flavor itself was actually unique and interesting, but the portion size was weak.  Huge shells with tiny morsels of meat inside *sad face*

Although our apps were weak, we had high hopes for our entrees.  I was stoked to get my Monterey style Cod (with artichoke hearts, tomato, garlic, green onion and muschrooms, sauteed in a Marsale wine sauce).  

My dish was a serious mess.  There was absolutely no flavor, and my fish was severely overcooked.  I was pretty unhappy (understatement of the day).  I had to douse my food in tabasco to fork it down.  Sad times all around.

My parents ordered stuffed Scallops and crabcakes, and although their dishes were much better than mine, they weren't particularly impressed either.  

Monterey Bay's supposed to be a legit seafood restaurant, but the only good food I had was the French Onion Soup and bread (which were both awesome).  I wish I could give this place a better rating because the waitstaff was amazing and the view was spectacular, but the food just wasn't up to par."}
{"text":"My wife and I dined here for our anniversary. We had Not been back to the restaurant in a few years since we had a few kids but time has only made the place better. We both had a fantastic meal. She had a grilled Seabass and I had a barbeque mahi-mahi. Both pieces of fish were cooked to perfection. Our server was timely and never made us feel we had to hurry up. Our drinks were expertly prepared and served to perfection. We had a great night. Someday they should update the elevator, sooner the better."}
{"text":"We went for my birthday best restaurant I've been to in Pittsburgh. Service, staff, hospitality and food were outstanding. Stuffed jumbo shrimp so good and the calamari was great. Good swordfish if you want something filling and meaty. Great desserts. Would recommend for any occasion."}
{"text":"Never had bad seafood here. However. The service is sometimes not very good. The bar is subpar. I would give 3 stars for bar and service except the seafood never disappoints. Lastly - either valet or park on one of the very crowded side streets"}
{"text":"Good view by the window and good service in this restaurant. Especially the desserts! The crab cakes are yummy and served in a perfect size!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. Always immaculate service, drinks, and food. Plus the view is outstanding. Best crab cakes I have ever eaten. Definitely will be returning in the future."}
{"text":"Awesome place for a date with great views.  This is near the Duquesne Incline.  The restaurant is on the very top of a building.  You can get great views of the entire downtown Pittsburgh, you can see Heinz Field, and the bridges to the left and right of Point State Park.  The night view is amazing.  You can get up here by driving or taking an incline and walking over. 

We had the Opah (Blacked cajun cooked) and Walu (carribean cooked).  These are 2 types of Haiwaiian fish.  The opah tasted a little dry and the Walu was very juicy.  This place is not cheap and the portions are small.  Service is good and you need to make a reservation because it does get packed.  One option is to sit in the lounge (no reservation needed) and have your food there.  They have a dress code but they are lenient on this.  

Try to request for a window seat if possible."}
{"text":"Tonight was the 3rd time we've been here. Both times before I definitely would have given a 5. For the price you pay, our particular server was not great at all. Barely smiled. Took at least 10 mins for my second drink. The temperature of the food could have been hotter. The lobster Mac and cheese was good. (Would have been better hotter) I got the crab crakes, wasn't impressed. I will say the grilled cheese dessert was wonderful. The view is beautiful if you can get a seat by the window. My husband and I have celebrated our birthdays and anniversary here for the past year and won't be back for the next celebration, seems like it definitely went down hill."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance and view, but their cooking fell short. Our red Snapper and Swordfish were both over cooked and dry. Very disappointing considering the price charged. I will say the Lobster Mac and cheese way a surprise and delightful. The corn was also a surprise presenting many flavors."}
{"text":"Brought the in laws here for dinner. Very pretty set up with a beautiful view. If available, you could ask the waitress to give you a table by the window. Food was pretty good. In laws loved it."}
{"text":"The food was amazing.....very friendly and inviting staff. A most that I visit again in my next trip."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh. The view is incredible. We normally hang out in the bar area. The service and food are the best!"}
{"text":"The views are to die forrrrr. Well not to die but to instagram af for. Amazing panoramic views of Pittsburgh from across the \"three\" rivers. You can see it all from here!

Definitely go with a crab cake add on if you can, get some Brussels to share (), and any of the fish dinners are incredible.

Dessert is a must! Get their version of a grilled cheese! WOW 10/10

Service was super friendly and professional. Look cute for the gram with those entrees!"}
{"text":"The view is worth the hype! But I was really surprised how dated this restaurant was. The sides were an additional cost- my dining companions raved about the lobster mac n cheese. Overall I don't think the value matches the price. I like Eleven better for special occasions."}
{"text":"This place is a must if you are coming to Pittsburgh! The views the food and the cocktails are all phenomenal. Previous yelp reviews recommended the crab cakes so that is what I choose. They blew me away! Very comparable to Maryland crab cakes, no filler and just piled on for a great crab cake patty. For dessert I ordered the grilled cheesecake. His again was another yelp recommendation! It is a crispy cheesecake glazed with ice cream and a raspberry sauce. You can also just come here for this dessert and be impressed. I saved the best for last with the view. The view at night is amazing. You get to see all the buildings and all the bridges which Pitt is famous for!

It's very pricey but the food and view are worth it. So if you are looking to treat yourself give this a try."}
{"text":"Perfect for special occasions. Always ordered something difference at each visit and always great."}
{"text":"We were a large group so we had a separate section to ourselves.  The restaurant was more empty than I expected for such a terrific spot.  Even though the group was large, we were served well and despite lapses in service (slow to bring drinks etc.) it was an overall positive experience.  

The set menu was very nicely laid out and he salad was fresh and crisp with a lemon dressing.  We were served exceptional bruschetta which I must say was very refreshing and had little or no onion (my preference) so it was a big hit for me - and a great way to cleanse the palate...  The crab cakes were exceptional.  They were mostly crab and very little other stuff, so they tasted more of the sea and the crab itself rather than the stuffing.  Recommended highly!

The choice for me was Chilean sea bass and I must say it was cooked perfectly.  The meat was flaky and moist and the greens and vegetables surrounding it were crunchy - just how I like them.  Overall a delightful dish and highly recommended

I would love to go back.  The service speed and somewhat dryer ambiance make it a 4 for me.  Or maybe a 4.5.  I need to go back to check it out again.  

I recommend this spot!"}
{"text":"Simply Amazing! Try the swordfish parmesan...you won't be let down."}
{"text":"An unimpressive experience. My date made reservations for 8:30 PM on a Friday night. Now you would have thought they'd have their best servers. Wrong! The food was very good, except for the bisque. Very little crab meat and not a tasty broth to spoon into after all the meat was gone, which only took two spoonfuls. They brought me more crab to add to the broth, again another two spoonfuls before that was gone too. The bisque itself was okay, not something I wanted to spend time sopping up.
All the rest of the dinner was very tasty. 
Now, the service...... They seated us at a table in a far corner. We waited 10 minutes for anyone to come over to our table. No one to even fill our water glasses. When I asked someone if I could get water, we were then asked if we wanted it by our waitress, who finally showed up, she then had to go get it. 
She said she was going to bring bread for the table. Another 10 minutes and my date asked for more butter, which never came.
We waited constantly for our waitress. I had to wave at her to come over so we could order appetizers and then had to wave down the floor manager to ask him to send our waitress over so we could order our main entrees . 
I complained to the floor manager after we completed our meals he asked if there was anything he could get us, then offered dessert. Really? I didn't want dessert! I wanted an exceptional evening with a great guy at, what I thought was an exceptional restaurant.  They complimented the meals which was ok, but we can't get the evening back. We went there to relax, talk,  have some great food and not have to worry about such things. 

I do have to say, that the valet were awesome and the bartenders were exceptional. My date ordered a drink he concocted himself and I ordered a dirty martini. Both were perfect!!!

Don't think I'd take a chance going again."}
{"text":"One of the best meals ever! My fiance and I ate at the Monterey Bay Fish Grotto for a late Valentine's Day dinner tonight. We had a reservation and wereseated promptly. Our server, Holly, was pleasant as can be and very efficient. I ordered the swordfish with cajun seasoning and orange marmalade sauce and my fiance had caribbean halibut. We both agreed that while both were delicious the swordfish was the better meal. It was cooked perfectly and melted in my mouth. We shared a side of lobster mac and cheese. It was good, probably could have cut back on the cheese a tiny bit as it was super rich. Now, we opted against dessert because I was pretty full, but when she brought us our check, Holly also brought a piece of the angel food grilled cheese to go because we were celebrating. Very sweet gesture and we tore into it as soon as we got home! Such an innovative and delicious dessert!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here for my birthday dinner last year when we were in Pittsburgh for the weekend. We chose it based on the glowing recommendation we received from the Maitre D' at our hotel. 

It's in a pretty cool location atop Mount Washington which overlooks all of Pittsburgh. We took the incline plane most of the way up and then a cab from there which was nice. Once you arrive at the restaurant it kind of feels like being in an apartment building. You take an elevator up to the very top to enter the dining room. 

My first impression of the dining room was that it is huge, crowded, and very early-90's in decor. I felt like I should have teased and sprayed my hair and given my bangs a nice blowout before I put on my shoulder-padded jean jacket to come to this restaurant. The lighting is cheesy, it's a mix of tables and booths, and I am almost positive there was a paper placemat on the table. Needless to say, Monterey Bay sort of felt like what my 6-year-old self always thought \"fancy restaurants\" were like until I actually was old enough to go to one. 

Other reviewers don't lie, the view is amazing, but I have to admit it felt like the windows needed washing that night. It was a little hazy. 

As for the food, it was priced like any fish restaurant--in the mid-$20's-$35 per plate. This is perhaps a personal chip on my shoulder, but I am never impressed by places that offer to butter-sautee or broil fish when that's not the ideal way for it to be prepared. It feels like a way to cater to not-so-savvy diners who don't really appreciate what good fish is. Our portions were ENORMOUS for everything which is annoying because I hate leaving fish uneaten, but it was just too much. It was prepared well, but our sides were pretty unrefined. 

All in all, not a terrible dining experience, but I was not in love with it either. If you could do half-stars, this would get a 2.5 from me."}
{"text":"Fantastic view and awesome seafood!  I had the combo platter appertizer which consisted of 2 shrimp (I subbed cocktail for the spicey ones),1 large crabcake and a skewer of tuna,salmon,and a 3rd fish. I highly recommend it; even for the $22.  

The caesar salad was giant and awesome.  Ask for Anchovies.  I packaged most of it up or I wouldn't be able to eat my Mahi Mahi Cape Cod style (highly recommend it).  No room for dessert.  

Great for special occasions or for travelers.  It is not in-expensive but in-line with Mitchell's and McCormick and Schmick.  This beats the others."}
{"text":"Been here a few times in the past with great friends and a beautiful view of the city. More recently, visited with my boyfriend for our 2 year anniversary. Since they knew it was a special day, the service was spectacular. The hostess was the sweetest woman and they accommodated our every need. We even had free dessert! The Chocolate Steaming Latte is the best dessert I've ever eaten. It's warm chocolate-y goodness will bring me back again!!!!!"}
{"text":"Being completely honest, I was not all that impressed - mainly with the food. The service and actual restaurant were very nice, but I didn't enjoy my main entree or the sides which really was disappointing. The view from the restaurant is pretty awesome though, so that does make up for a the not great food. 

For dinner I had the crab bisque (which was the best), the halibut cooked parmesan style, crab mac and cheese, and brussel sprouts (very good too).  The crab mac and cheese was really dry, and not cheesy/creamy, it was all just stuck together and hard to scoop out of the dish. And perhaps I ordered the wrong style fish/way it was cooked but just didn't really think it was worth the price and didn't taste that great.

Overall we had excellent service and again, the location was really nice."}
{"text":"5 Stars!  Found this place on a whim, dined solo for a late lunch and it blew my mind. View = amazing. Table = amazing Service = AMAZING Food = also amazing!"}
{"text":"We have never been disappointed here. Food and service was always exceptional. A bit high so tend to use for special occasions, birthdays, anniversaries, etc. Our joint birthday's are coming up shortly and anticipate celebrating here, assuming no unforeseen issues."}
{"text":"I could talk about the view, the tuna, the atmosphere, any of the obvious things that made this place great.  But the brussel sprouts...wow.  I'm a meat and potatoes guy, but even the brussel sprouts were perfect.  Pricey?  Yes.  But I felt I got every penny's worth.  It's a real gem."}
{"text":"After our last experience that was less than 5 stars the manager invited us in to have dinner again.  This time everything was fantastic.  

We tried the She-Crab bisque and really liked it.  Hopefully this special will be available again in the future.  My sea bass was perfect and my husband's crab cakes were excellent as usual.  

He had the grilled cheese for dessert and I had the chocolate latte.  Both were great.  I am so happy to see the chocolate latte back on the menu."}
{"text":"Went for an anniversary dinner this evening.... Our waiter, John, was fantastic! He was so helpful, polite, and welcoming...We got the lobster Rangoon appetizer which was fabulous. Each of us got the crab cake entree and they were the best I've ever had! The fresh fish menu looked great, but I'm just super picky! Definitely would recommend the crab cakes, though."}
{"text":"Very happy with dinner experience at Monterey Bay tonight. The atmosphere is elegant and romantic with an awesome view from Mount Washington. The service was superb and our fish cooked to perfection. Valet parking only, cost $7. Coat check service. Menu a la carte. 

We started with their special appetizer and holiday cocktails. The snowstorm mojito had a delicious coconut and mint flavor and was like starting dinner with a dessert! The appetizer special was perfect for sharing. My favorite part was hands down the crab cake and next time I'll definitely be getting that as an appetizer or an entree! For entrees we chose the barramundi and red snapper. Both cooked to perfection with the coconut macadamia crusted option and pina colada sauce. If you like a sweet dish, this style of cook is for you! For a side, we had the fried brussel sprouts. After cocktails, appetizer, salad and entrees, we unfortunately had no room for dessert! 

I highly recommend Monterey Bay Fish Grotto for any seafood lover! Portions were large and we were not disappointed! It is a pricier place but well worth it. Our bill with tip was $200 which included 1 appetizer, soup, salad, 2 cocktails, 2 entrees and 1 side."}
{"text":"On my reservation I requested window seating because it was my birthday and because I just moved to Pitt. You usually can't request window seating because it's first come first serve, but when we arrived they said they heard my request and sat us at a window table and told me happy birthday. The waitress took our picture with the skyline in the background and was very polite about answering our questions about the city. We ordered oysters and the crab cakes as an appetizer. For the main dishes we ordered the Chilean Sea Bass with the Chimichurri prep, the Salmon with the honey lime prep, and the Rock Fish with the Parmesan prep. We ordered the Asparagus, Lobster Mac and Cheese, and Roasted Potatoes as sharable sides.  I tasted all of it and it was all so delicious! As a birthday gift they gave us a free dessert of my choice. I selected their award winning Angel Food Grilled Cheese Sandwich. Easily one of the best desserts I ever had! Definitely a great choice for a birthday/ welcome to Pitt dinner with loved ones!"}
{"text":"Chose this restaurant strictly based on the fact I love seafood and the view of the city.  Our waitress was cold and didn't engage much.  We were celebrating my birthday and engagement, I read all these great reviews for celebrating but our experience just fell flat.  (She didn't even bother to ask.) She also seemed annoyed we didn't want mediocre looking $12 asparagus to share with our meals.  Another waitress brought out calamari and dropped half our plate & promised to have more made but it never came.  Entrees were small and just ok, not very hot served.  Food 4/10.  I regret leaving and above avg. tip.  However the views (10/10) are to die for, but we won't be back. We frequent nice restaurants and weren't afraid of the price tag either.  There are so many other great restaurants and experiences that we still rave about, this isn't one of them."}
{"text":"This is the place to go for the best fish in Pittsburgh. The melt in your mouth kind. Love the unique chimichurri option on the Sea Bass. Brussels sprouts are the best side. They serve the freshest bread to get started. Dessert wise the angel food sandwich was great. I would not get the chocolate cake in the cup. Was cooked a little too much. Tasted a bit burned. But everything else was delicious. Can't be the perfect view of Pittsburgh as well. Valet parking available for $7."}
{"text":"This is an upscale fish place, and it's worth it when you want a really nice dining experience.  We've gone here 4 times and have loved it every time.  Food has always tasted awesome, and the view is one of the best of the city."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had dinner at Monterey Bay to celebrate his birthday during a recent visit to Pittsburgh.  First, the view is truly outstanding.  The place is quite pricey, and it's clear that the view is a big part of what you're paying for and arguably worth it.  The service was very good, and the food that we ordered ranged from so-so to excellent.  The appetizer of lobster rangoons was our most disappointing dish.  The portion was very small; the presence of lobster inside was barely discernible; and it simply wasn't especially tasty or memorable for the price.  We also shared a caesar salad to start, which was fine, typical of any caesar salad.  It was nice that they pre-divided the salad onto two plates to make it easier for us to share.  For our entrees, my boyfriend chose the coq au vin, and I ordered the parmesan rockfish.  All of the entrees are served a la carte, so we also ordered a side of the gratin potatoes to share.  My rockfish was excellent, with a simple, flavorful, and unfussy preparation to showcase the fish nicely.  The potato gratin side dish was also very tasty.  My boyfriend was disappointed in the coq au vin, though.  Although the portion of chicken was generous, he ultimately found the preparation to be a bit too minimalist.  Traditional coq au vin is typically a hearty, rustic, comforting dish with a lot of richly flavored broth and vegetables -- the kind of dish that you want to dip your bread in to soak up all the extra goodness.  The preparation here, though, had almost no broth and, in turn, minimal flavor.  We also found the wine list a little disappointing.  There were a number of wines that were priced quite high yet are pretty common and easy to find elsewhere -- and thus we know how inexpensive they typically are when purchased at a store versus in an expensive restaurant.  If you're going to charge a high mark-up on wine (as all restaurants do, so that's to be expected), it would be nice to focus on providing interesting and special offerings that one might not be as familiar with and which aren't easily found at many other stores and restaurants.  Having said that, we eventually settled on one of the few white wine options that was both interesting and reasonably-priced, the Pine Ridge Chenin Blanc-Viognier blend, which turned out to be pretty enjoyable -- offer more wines like this, please!  At the end of our meal, the restaurant very generously brought my boyfriend a complimentary dessert of his choice in honor of his birthday.  He opted for the angel food cake grilled cheese sandwich, which was unique and decadent and quite delicious.  Overall, we had a very nice experience here.  It would be nice to see a little more variety on the wine list, and it would be even better if all of the dishes were equally satisfying and flavorful.  However, the view is outstanding, as are the service and the atmosphere.  It's definitely a nice place to celebrate a special occasion."}
{"text":"Went for the first time for my birthday & it won't be the last! Excellent service & phenomenal food!!!"}
{"text":"This is an extraordinary restaurant. The ambience, the view, the service, and the food are all tremendous. 
Beer, wine, and drink list are all solid.
We started with the calamari appetizer. It was perfectly made and the accompanying sauce paired perfectly.  For dinner, I had the Bronzino and it was amazing. It's served as a whole fish which may sound challenging to eat...it was simple. 
My wife had the salmon, which she said was very good. We ordered the scalloped potatoes and chipotle creamed corn as our sides, again, both were very good. My wife also had the she crab soup as a starter and she stated it was as good as what she's had in South Carolina. We really love Monterey Bay, it's a top notch establishment!"}
{"text":"Wow, to start, you have to take an elevator up to the restaurant! SO COOL! Once we arrived at our floor, we were greeted with friendly staff and an amazing view!  I made a reservation online for my boyfriend's birthday. Window seats at this restaurant are a hot commodity (and you can't reserve with your reservation), so if you want one I would get there early, because they have a first come first serve waiting list for anyone wanting a window seat.  We were able to sit by one of the side windows which was still pretty cool if you ask me! The service was awesome! Our waiter was really nice and was able to give us great descriptions of the menu items we asked about.  

We ended up ordering:
Scallops and Crab Cakes - Everything cooked to perfection! The crab cakes had huge lumps of crab in them and the scallops were buttery deliciousness!
Caribbean Halibut - I honestly didn't care for this meal much at all.  It was pretty bland and I was expecting a lot more of the fruit salsa.  

When I booked the reservation online I added a note saying that it was for a birthday.  After our meal was finished our waiter told us to pick 2 desserts on the house!!! SO NICE!

We ordered:
Angel Food Grilled Cheese - The hype is totally real! Grilled angel food cake with a cream cheese center...soooo gooood!
Pot de Creme - Sweet and salty and oh so delicious! It came with some fruit that was so yummy when dipped in the pot de creme. 

Overall, this was a wonderful experience! The view, the food, and the staff made this a great place to celebrate!"}
{"text":"\"Monterey Bay Fish Sky Tower\"

This was an awesome way to continue our journey after riding the Duquesne Incline.  Just a short walk up the hill, take an elevator to the top and step off into a dining room with stunning panoramic views and vaulted ceilings.  The decor was slightly reminiscent of a Vegas hotel lobby.  It wasn't very busy when we got there but it was in between lunch and dinner hours.

We decided to go to the lounge area half a flight down.  We were the only ones sitting at the bar and got A+ service from our bartender.  He might have been one of the most engaging and entertaining bartenders I've ever met ( I feel terrible I cannot remember his name)  He truly appreciated the joys of being a mixologist and made some killer drinks.  The drink menu is extensive and we got their just in time for their 'Executive Hour\".  Okay, I giggled at first too and thought how pretentious, but it actually is quite clever since their clientele during this time was a lot of suits.

We must have tried 3 different drinks each, my favourite being the Jalepeno Martini.  Talk about a kick in the mouth!  The other drinks were incredibly tasty too and all used a variety of booze so their is something for anyone. 

As the night progressed not only did the view become even more beautiful as Pittsburgh lit up we decided on a lil nosh.  So we tried the recommended Cajun Shrimp.  They were great and not too oily like other  places.  The rest of the menu looked like a \"To-Do list\" of fish.  Trust me you'll want to go back and check them off.

When we left the dining room was packed and a wait queued in the lobby."}
{"text":"What a treat this place is for an out of towner.  Such an experience that I will definitely remember of my trip to Pittsburgh.  This is one of those places you go for a special occasion or if you have money oozing out of your pockets.

Situated on a hill overlooking downtown you won't find better views of the city.  While dining looking out the window it almost feels as if what you are looking at is a post card of a night time scene of Pittsburgh.  I included a picture that shows exactly what I was enjoying.

The service I experienced was impeccable.  Server knew everything about the menu and helped with the meal selection as well as the wine.  The maitre de also made sure that I was having a great time as well.  That's always a plus in my book when someone in charge performs table touching helping patrons enjoy their time.

The food was very good, but not the greatest.  I didn't fall in love with what I had and this is the reason I can't give this restaurant five stars.  While dining at this type of fine dining place the food should be near the top of what you have had before.  I'm not saying the food is bad at all, just could be a little better.

Overall I have to say the prices aren't that bad and the view is absolutely spectacular.  I think this is a great choice for anyone looking for that dinner that will \"wow\" them while visiting Pittsburgh!  And if you live here, it's one of those places you go every so many years."}
{"text":"The entire evening made for a wonderful date night. The location is scenic. It was a beautiful summer evening, so we actually parked at the bottom, rode the cable car up and then walked up the hill to the restaurant. 

This place gets a five for the seafood entrees, view (we had a window table), and the service. As far as menu items, everything else gets a two. I don't know what I was thinking ordering a chicken dish at a seafood restaurant but ewww -- it was completely flavorless. However, my date (who grew up on the east coast and has had fabulous seafood offerings his entire life) said his dish here was the best he's ever had. He had a yellow-fin tuna, stuffed with feta. Two years later he still talks about it."}
{"text":"Way over priced for the food. Additionally, couple of people from or group got sick eating the salmon here.I My food was excellent but the cocktails were all way to sweet. Ithink you're really paying for the location, the view and the classiness, in spite of those three, I still think it's over priced and overrated."}
{"text":"Just enjoyed my graduation dinner at Monterey Bay and had a truly wonderful experience. The view, ambience, service, food-- all amazing. Holly was our waitress, and she was incredible. She was friendly, attentive and thoughtful. I love it here because it's fine dining without it being pretentious like some other restaurants. The grilled oysters, crab cake with shrimp, lobster Mac n cheese, saut√©ed spinach-- all absolutely delicious. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"4.5/5 if I could

I chose this as the \"big night out\" dinner for during a recent trip to Pittsburgh. I ordered the wahoo with Caribbean jerk seasoning. The seasoning provided a nice tangy sweet citrusy kick to the fish. The atmosphere and preparation of the fish made me feel like I was on a tropical island somewhere. The peanut butter chocolate cheese cake was excellent. The cheesecake had pieces of pretzel baked inside which provided for an extra crunch. 

I loved the view of the stadium and the city too. From our seat you could see the scoreboard at PNC park. The staff knows that the window seats are prime real estate and will work with you to get you a good seat if you have a reservation. 

For people not familiar with the city, getting to the restaurant itself could be a bit of a challenge. We took the incline but there may have been a more efficient way. I would say it was worth the trip though!"}
{"text":"We dined at Montery Bay Fish Grotto while as a treat for our freshman daughter who attends Pitt. My college student felt very pampered by the elegant atmosphere and the fabulous view, The food was impressive- we especially enjoyed the appetizers- the ahi tempura and the crabcakes were both standouts. The fresh fish choices were a bit overwhelming- too many choices! The salmon strawbery style came recommended by our server and was very good for an unexpected combination. We also tried the orange basil halibut which was very tasty (though my husband swore the fish was cod); the swordfish oscar was amazing; and the grouper monterey style with black olives and artichokes pleased my husband very much. Also enjoyed a side of lobster mac n cheese. We don't usually get desserts but they were all so tempting and made for a sweet conclusion to the meal. The service was attentive and overall it was a memorable if somewhat overindulgent dining experience!

Definitely recommend for a special occasion!"}
{"text":"This has been our go to spot for celebrations.  We haven't been here since the remodel.  Last night was to celebrate our daughter's/niece's graduation.  The positives:  we had a great table which wasn't technically the \" windowseat\" but once the sun started to go down we had the best sunset!  Our server was wonderful as well.  She was attentive and made us feel welcome to stay to socialize.  The not so positives:  No specials.  Just the menu. In the past there were chef specials that included sides and extras.  We ordered side dishes of potatoes and asparagus...potatoes were over cooked and the asparagus was average. Our entrees were good. Crabcakes were great...scallops were dry, sea bass was good but was lonely on a big plate. Swordfish Parmesan is what drew our grad.  They changed the recipe and now it has a breading and fried. Still good but not what we remember. No more complementary salad. Good food but for the price?...  We live closer to Off the Hook and find the chef there ( who was at MBFG) has it down. The desserts were good but the Steaming Chocolate late  was smaller and not as good as Off the Hook.

Still enjoyed the ambience and the view. But not surprised that they were half full.  Next occasion will be at Off the Hook. May be back for college graduation with a cocktail. Sad that the food didn't stay or improve with the remodel. I'd take 1980's palm trees for the old chef."}
{"text":"THE GOOD:
The view and the service. Specifically request a view by the window, and you'll be awestruck the whole meal by the amazing view of Pittsburgh - the restaurant's main redeeming characteristic. Our waiter was also very pleasant and attentive. 

THE BAD:
The food, yo. And the prices. I am continually disappointed by the food at upscale, pricey restaurants. The food just doesn't live up to the hype, and the Fish Grotto was no exception. I didn't like the meal I got at all (one of their more expensive fish), and enjoyed my salad appetizer and the free bread significantly more, in fact. 

THE UGLY:
The atmosphere. It's themed like the tropics, I guess? With huge fake palm trees everywhere? It sort of reminded me of the cheesy casino in the 1990s movie The Mask. Not really the upscale atmosphere I look for in an expensive meal out. 

IN SUMMATION:
If you want to cruise up the duquesne incline and end at a restaurant, I wouldn't really pick this one, especially since you can see the view of the city for free outside. The food isn't worth it, especially for these prices."}
{"text":"Wow, 5-star experience for my first dining experience at Monterey Bay! We had a private room for our dinner program. Lovely decor, excellent service, and delicious food! Cannot wait to return for a special occasion! The view from the main dining area is spectacular!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing...the view, the service, the food was all on point! I had the wedge salad, it was phenomenal!! I could have ordered 2 more and just ate it. The flavors were incredible. Our party all got different fish and everyone loved their entrees."}
{"text":"Seriously?! 
Is it your best restaurant in Pittsburgh?!! 

Yeah, the view is super nice.
But neither foods nor service were not enough for the price!!!!!! 
I think I can make better foods than here. 
And the server had no idea with wines at all......

Yeah.....if I am an owner of that restaurant with that spectacular view, I would make everything better. Oh please!!"}
{"text":"Ate there last night with my wife for our anniversary.  The staff was excellent and treated us like royalty.  The appetizer was very good and the special soup (crab creole bisque) was very spicy and excellent!  The food was very good and it's really hard to complain about a $10 corkage fee.  They also gave us a free dessert for our anniversary.  The carrot cake was incredible and my wife enjoyed her chocolate latte cake thing.

My only complaint is that the shrimp appetizer and my chilean sea bass were not really hot.  They were not cold, but not hot either.  

We'll go back again for another event."}
{"text":"I had a wonderful time at Monterey Bay Fish Grotto. Obviously I expected amazing food, a spectacular view, and exquisite service. They exceeded my expectations in every regard. My date inquired about a substitution and the server was very accommodating. Not only that but a manager also followed up and made an additional recommendation. The brandied shrimp with tagliatelle and cream sauce is the best pasta dish I have ever had. The cream is light, well-balanced and vey flavorful. The shrimp is prepared butterflied and there is a generous portion. The pasta is served al dente (of course) but is also clearly freshly prepared. My date enjoyed the halibut with a jerk seasoned preparation. Also was very good. There is zero reservation about dining here and I look forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"Ordered a $15 old fashioned. Bartender emptied a sugar packet and topped it with a cherry & orange wedge."}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate with my family and had a genuinely wonderful experience.  The views and service are spectacular and what you expect from a fine dining restaurant like this. Over all the food was very good, though some dishes were better than others. My family had all different cuts of fish and they were all prepared expertly. My scallops stuffed with crab were the only minor disappointment, and they were fine, just not exceptional, nor worth 38$! The prices are seriously up there, but within the realm of reason for most things. Definitely only a special occasion restaurant but still very good. Only thing I'd change today would be their music! Odd pan flute selections made me think I was in a yoga studio, not a restaurant. So strange!"}
{"text":"Let me preface this post by saying that it has been awhile since I have dined at Monterey Bay but I am new to Yelp and just had to write a review.  I have been here quite a few times (at least 5 without really going back and counting).  Each time I have gone to the Monroeville location (first in the old office building and then at the mall).  My first time was there was in high school and my idea of seafood was lobster and crab, so I was disappointed that those dishes aren't on the menu, but that did not take away from a wonderful first meal and every meal since.  My staple go to dish is their peppercorn yellow fin tuna.  I have always been more of a meat and potatoes kind of guy and love a good steak.  The tuna is as good if not better than any filet that you would order at a premier steak house.  The decor and the wait staff are also compliment the experience.  Since I live in Rochester, NY now, Monterey Bay is a must go to when I go home to visit."}
{"text":"Wow wow wow! We had reservations at le mont but we went there the last time we were in Pittsburgh..so I requested something different. We had a 5:30 reservation and decided to go a little early to ensure we'd have a window seat. Luckily we did because we got the last one! And I honestly think it was the best table in the house!

Our server Kerri was super friendly and helpful all of her suggestions were on point! She helped us through the wine list as well as the menu. My only complaint is the wine took quite a while to arrive but we were really soaking in the wonderful views so we hardly noticed!

First up we ordered the calamari..seems generic but it's definitely a step above..the dipping sauce was great..the breading actually stuck to it and it was nice and tender with very little chew. We then shared a Caesar salad..she actually brought it out split up for us..I couldn't believe it was only 1 salad as both of our portions were huge and it was only a $10 salad!

For my entree I landed on the crab cake with jumbo scallops and lobster sauce..perfect! Crab cakes have so little filling just all lump crab..they come with an awesome homemade remoulade..just perfect..dining partner landed on sea bass with the chimichuri preparation. It was good..but mine was better! 

The atmosphere was absolutely perfect..breath taking views and a modern sleek space. The hidden gem is really in the lounge on the mid level. They have an expansive bar with and amazing view plus a few tables along the windows..if you can't score a window seat upstairs..or if you just want a little more relaxed atmosphere with the same view..hit the lounge!

Can't wait to go back! Thank you for a wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"Lovely views of the city with impeccable service. We had reservations at 7:00 and enjoyed watching the sunset during our dinner. Slow paced with upscale ambience. 

Food was delicious and the desserts were perfecto!"}
{"text":"When I lived in Pittsburgh, this was my absolute favorite place to dine for a special occasion. Apparently there's been a remodel and a change in ownership? Whatever the case, it just wasn't the experience we had in years past. Disappointing. Service not bad, but not great. View still excellent. Calamari delicious. Grilled angel food sandwich dessert delicious. Butter they serve with bread was the favorite item of some in our party (in a seafood restaurant...should be the seafood, no?) Ahi tuna dish apparently not as good as it has always been. Even the famed crab cakes weren't getting rave reviews at our table. Everything else was good - but not great like we'd come to expect from this place. Not even sure if we'll go back."}
{"text":"Excellent Restaurant with great customer service.
Here is what I thought was excellent....

Drinks:  All American Old Fashioned
Appetizers:  Calamari
Soup:  Lobster Bisque is some of the best I ever had.
Dinner:  Chef Special - Jumbo Scallop over Grits (Cajun style) - Amazing
Dessert:  All were good but the Angel food grilled cheese won the prize.

Portions are small but typical for an upscale restaurant.
Bring your wallet cause it can get pricey!"}
{"text":"With spectacular views of Pittsburgh, stellar service, and incredible food, Monterey Bay Fish Grotto is definitely a \"go to\" for that special occasion dinner (an anniversary, milestone birthday, graduation, etc...).  After coming here with the family to celebrate my brother's college graduation, I came away extremely pleased with the quality of the food, the service, and the overall experience.  Really terrific all around.

Everything I had that night tasted terrific and was presented beautifully.  My spicy tomato soup with crab had just the right amount of heat, complemented by a good amount of tender crab.  The seafood sampler allowed us to taste their savory crabcake, jumbo shrimp, and ichiban.   I also very much enjoyed my Chilean Sea Bass carribean style (with pineapple, jamaican jerk spices, and peppers), and the white chocolate mousse dessert was terrific.

My only complaint is that despite the exceptional flavor the food, the menu does not seem to be terribly inventive or original.  Yes, there are good dishes and drinks and everything looks and tastes amazing, but the fare here is by no means unique.  It doesn't seem terribly out of place at any other upscale restaurant, banquet hall, or steakhouse.  Otherwise, it's definitely a great place to go for that special occasion, and also when you want dinner with a view."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I celebrated our anniversary at Monterey Bay Fish Grotto, as a lover of seafood, I was quite skeptical that a seafood restaurant in Pittsburgh would have fish that tasted like butter, without an overwhelming fishy flavor. However, I was glad to find out that I was quite wrong, and I was more than pleased with the food that arrived at my table. The fish was phenomenal and tasted very, very fresh. For dessert, we split the angel food grilled cheese sandwich which was so beautifully presented, and it tasted just as good as it sounds!

Our reservations were at sunset so the view before, during, and after sunset were unlike any other in the city. It was such a fun spot to go to celebrate an anniversary or a special occasion!

The only drawback with this restaurant is the price tag, but you won't find a better seafood restaurant with such an incredible view in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"I took my wife for our 6th wedding anniversary, and our experience was wonderful throughout the whole evening.
Starting with the valet, very courteous and welcoming!
The elevator ride up to the restaurant was nice, once you get a grand view of Pittsburgh downtown.
The French onion soup was okay.
We both had the Chilean sea bass, Caribbean style, well done - was lovely, very well prepared.
Finally, the Cr√®me br√ªl√©e arrived with \"Happy Anniversary\" written in chocolate on a plate... very thoughtful.
Overall, a wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"Many times I have thought to myself... if only I had more disposable income so I could come here more often. Not many restaurants have inspired this line of thinking in me, Monterey Bay being an obvious exception. 

The absolute freshest and best prepared fish/seafood in the Pittsburgh area hands down. Also, do yourself a favor and get the white chocolate, macadamia nut dessert thing. It's life changing. 
A few note-worthy observations...
1) Reservations strongly recommended, use the same name every time you come [reasons/explanation below in 2, 3]
2) I noticed a strong correlation between number of attendances and preferable seating. While it's simply a theory, I would venture to guess this hypothesis could be proven. The first time I came here we were placed in the most remote corner from the best views... with each time we came back we noticed that we got closer and closer to the best seating in the house (near the 3-rivers view). 
3) Client profile? During one return visit, we were discussing wine selection and couldn't remember what we had chosen last time. The bottle was so good, we wanted to indulge again but couldn't remember what it was. Much to my surprise, a profile had been created under our reservation name and every wine bottle selection we had previously made was documented and recorded in a 'client profile' so to speak. This kind of service is unprecedented. I was somewhat in shock.
4) After frequenting Monterey so much, the manager had somewhat come to know me and my husband a bit. He didn't remember our names necessarily, but remembered our faces and previous conversations we had. As a result, we were granted dessert on the house while dining in celebration of my engagement."}
{"text":"We were visiting from Cleveland for Memorial Day weekend. We had reserved online and requested a table by the window . When we arrived all tables by the window were taken and I must say the lady at the entrance was not very welcoming which put me off at first  . We were then shown to our table and were introduced to our server Andrew , who I must say by far is the best server I have ever had the unique experience of meeting. He rearranged our table so we face the windows and have a fabulous view of the city. He then helped us with our menu selections and made excellent suggestions and finally served us our dessert. The food was good very well prepared I had the honey lime salmon which might have been cooked a bit too rare for my taste but still was good. My fianc√© had the paramesan halibut which was phenomenal. We had Creme br√ªl√©e for dessert which was delicious and came with a very moist buttery sugar cookie on top. Our experience overall was great and made superb by this very nice man Andrew. It is the little things he did and the little details he tailored do that made the night so enjoyable. We enjoyed chatting with him between courses and he genuinely turned the night around. Should we visit Pittsburgh again we would definitely come back and ask for Andrew. Everyone should ask for Andrew !!!"}
{"text":"Pretty amazing....I know people will complain about something.....but I'm not sure what!! Amazing view, good service, and good food. If you like sushi the sakari roll rocks!"}
{"text":"I lived 1/2 a block from this restaurant, but I only ate here a couple of times when I lived in Pittsburgh. I always felt out of place here.

It always felt like I should have my grandparents with me to fit in. My grandfather in his Sunday suit and my grandmother with a purple orchid corsage on her dress. Maybe then I might have felt more comfortable.

I remember the food was very good and the view was spectacular. 

But it felt like a really good restaurant attached to a retirement community. Definitely NOT your hip joint, nor even just an upscale dining experience. 

If my grandparents ever come visit me again, and we just happen to be in Pittsburgh, I will probably take them to another restaurant that is a little more lively.  Even they would appreciate it."}
{"text":"So delicious! Im not usually a big seafood person, but I enjoyed every single dish here. My friends and I got a window table and were able to see the beautiful Pittsburgh skyline while eating dinner. We ordered the Brandied shrimp tagliatelle, Moroccan spiced eggplant, Monterey Bay signature crab cakes, Halibut with Parmesan crust, and the Lobster mac and cheese. The tagliatelle dish was amazing. The noodles were chewy and the sauce was perfectly balanced with the shrimp. I've honestly never seen shrimp that huge in my life, esp in a pasta dish! They are most famous for their crab cakes, and I can definitely see why. They were soft and flavorful. There was some sauce on the bottom of them, but definitely was not necessary. We also ordered two desserts- Angel food grilled cheese sandwich and the maple tiramisu. We had a hard time deciding which desserts to get and almost ordered every single one on the menu! To be honest, I think the prices are a little cheaper than other seafood restaurants I've been to, but the quality of food definitely surpassed the price."}
{"text":"I never thought I would say this, having lived in Boston for 8 years, but this is the best seafood restaurant I think have ever been to (not counting assorted clam shacks and places of that ilk). At my table we had tuna, grouper, and oysters, and all were amazing. The view is sensational, and the bar area is a cool little nook for a drink. The food is pricey, but the quality of the meal merited top dollar. I strongly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. All around great experience.

My boyfriend and I were visiting Pittsburgh for the first time and we're dying to satisfy our seafood craving. We decided to try out Monterey Bay and I'm so glad we did. We arrived 45 minutes early hoping to just sit at the bar for a few cocktails before dinner. Our table was ready when we arrived so we were able to eat earlier than planned. Our waitress, Casey, was excellent. Very knowledgeable about the menu and assisted me in my dinner indecisiveness. She did not steer my wrong! We had the appetizer special, the seafood trio, and it was mouth watering. The lobster ravioli was to die for - not thick and creamy like you would expect. LEAVE ROOM FOR DESSERT! I promise you won't be disappointed. The angel food cake grilled cheese has been voted the best dessert in Pittsburgh twice now (fun fact by our waitress Casey) and now I know why. 

Definitely a must try with a breath taking view of the city."}
{"text":"One word. STUNNING. From the view to the Wine to the service to the food. We had a large group (about 15), adding difficulty to the staff already. They killed it. They kept the wine flowing and were very attentive. They boasted about the crab cakes and I was craving scallops. Luckily they had a pairing of 1 crab cake and 4 large scallops. The scallops were to die for(still thinking about them). 

We got several different sides, my favorites being the lobster Mac and cheese and the Brussels sprouts. 

Appetizer wise, the calamari was light and crispy and delicious. 

Like I said, they kept the wine coming and we never had to turn around constantly looking for a server. 

From our table was a gorgeous sunset view of the city. If you go downstairs to the bar, there's some lounge chairs with another spectacular view of the city. 

Yes, it is expensive but TOTALLY worth it. High class service, food and wine."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I recently celebrated our one year anniversary at Monterey.  And I have to say we definitely chose the right place.  Our reservation was for 7:30 and we were sat as soon as we walked in.  

  The food was wonderful we started off with an appetizer sampler that included a crab cake, Skewered fish, along with Cajun Shrimp.  I ordered the Stuffed Yellow Fin Tuna and my girlfriend ordered the Shrimp and Scallop fettuccine both were excellent.  

  However there was one thing better than the food and the view.  And that was the service.  Our Waitress, April was great.  She was friendly as could be and very knowledgeable of the menu and made great recommendations.  
 
 Overall I was very satisfied with Monterey and will without a doubt return in the future."}
{"text":"3 star food, 5 star view, and 1 star value.  You'll pay a premium to be astounded by the view of downtown Pittsburgh while you dine at Monterey Bay.  The menu consists mainly of exotic or expensive fishes prepared a variety of ways.  The preparations are either boring (\"blackened\", \"seared\") or strange (\"au poivre\" w/ cognac sauce, \"black and bleu\" with gorgonzola).  The sides are also uninspired, with the mashed potatoes being my least favorite.

Of note, the prices are somewhat ridiculous.  A bottle of Yuengling for $6.50?  Give me a break!"}
{"text":"I took my boyfriend for his birthday dinner & I'm pretty sure he will never forget it! We had an amazing time! We went on a very busy Sunday night but we were still able to get a table right next to the front glass window. The view is absolutely amazing. 

Our server was very knowledgable about the different types of wine we were interested in. The maitre de came over to help us select the bottle that would accompany our meals with the best flavors. He could not have been more correct. We selected a Pinot Noir from Oregon and it made the night completely worth it!

We started with a salad, of which I can't remember the name but it was good. For my entree I selected the Walu Escalar from Hawaii. It was prepared with a parmesan  cream based sauce and it was to die for! My boyfriend selected the Chilean Sea Bass prepared the Caribbean way. He was more than pleased. 

I had called ahead just to ask for the window table for his birthday dinner. Our hostess must have remembered and made a note of it because once we ordered the banana foster cheesecake, it came on a platter that said \"Happy Birthday\" in chocolate. It was the perfect touch to our amazing experience. We will be returning this summer for our anniversary & I cannot wait to see what the seasonal selections are."}
{"text":"Outstanding fish restaurant with amazing views.  Stellar service and comprehensive wine list.  I had the Virginia Striped Bass with mediterranean sauce.  Excellent on all levels and highly recommended."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants. The food, service, view, and atmosphere are always on point. They remodeled since the last time I had been there after moving away from Pgh. The renovations are perfect for the atmosphere. I highly recommend crab cakes and shrimp or scallops. My only request would be that they bring back the chocolate cake. Other than that, this is perfection in a restaurant. It is worth the price."}
{"text":"Great Views.  
Good Service.
Really nice food presentation.  
Stopped in for a celebration.
Started with the Caesar Salad that was very good with some white anchovies.
I had the Crab Cakes that are perfectly cooked and oh so good.  
Everyone really enjoyed their meal.
We shared a couple of the sides.  Brussel sprouts and asparagus were good but not as good as mine.  The Lobster Mac was a big hit.  Some nice pieces of lobster were evident.
For desert we shared a couple including the Passion Fruit rose Icebox Pie and the Steaming Chocolate latte.  Really enjoyed the Passion Fruit.  The Steaming Chocolate is definitely a chocolate lovers dream.  
When we arrived the hostess made sure to congratulate the person who we were celebrating but was surprised they were not offered or given a small desert or something as does another restaurant just down the street always does."}
{"text":"The ambience is amazing. The lounge offers the best view of the city. The staff were very friendly and the food was amazing.  This is a high class experience so prepare to dress nice. It sits on top of a hill overlooking all of downtown Pittsburgh.  The lobster mac and cheese had to be my favorite although it's hard saying that because everything was the best."}
{"text":"Monterey Bay Fish Grotto seems a little off into the distance compared to the other restaurants on the street, giving it a slightly more unique view of Pittsburgh. We loved our view. It was gorgeous and definitely one of the best views I've seen of Pittsburgh, especially at night. This is the place to go to for an amazing view. 

The food, however, was just okay, from the calamari to the sushi rolls to the dessert. We tried the Cathedral roll, Carson St. roll, and 446 roll. The best was the 446, which came in 11 pieces and had shrimp tempura, spicy salmon, eel, and avocado. We thought the other two were eh, okay. Dessert was the apple tart--good, but didn't blow us away or anything. 

Service was very good! Our server seemed to really care about us, and the manager went around introducing himself to tables, chatted a bit, and came back to check up after we got our food. And--I have to say it again--the view is one of the best you'll get of Pittsburgh. Come here for the service and view, but there are definitely a few disappointments on the menu. I would say still worth the trip though!

{"text":"Overrated and expensive. 

They heavily promote the fact that they fly all this fresh in from around the world, but it is so over-prepared with sauces and spices that you cannot enjoy the actual freshness of the fish.

Portions are moderate, but the prices are high. Most wines are at least $10 a glass. They do go out of their way to work with people who are gluten intolerant, including having tapioca rolls, but everything adds up very quickly.

In my opinion, you are paying for the view. For quite a bit less money you can enjoy much better food at nearby La Tavola."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I am not a seafood eater.  The only seafood I like is shrimp.  With that being said, this is my new favorite restaurant.  We went here on Saturday night and everything from our drinks, our food, the service, and the view made for a really wonderful evening.  We arrived an hour prior to our reservation to have drinks.  I had the Dragonberry Mojito and this is my new fave drink.  It wasn't overly fruity, but just right.  We had the sampler as an appetizer which included Cajun sauteed shrimp, crab cake, and a hibachi skewer.  Since I only eat shrimp, I had the Cajun sauteed shrimp, and this was the best shrimp I have ever had.  I am also not a spicy person and the cajun seasoning was just right for me.  My boyfriend enjoyed the rest of the appetizer.  He also had the  butternut soup with crab meat and was ready for more.  I ordered the ribeye special and he had the blackened and cajun chargrilled salmon.  We also got shrimp fried rice as our side.  I can't even begin to describe how enjoyable and tasty all of my food was.  It was incredible.  Our waitress, Pam, was pleasant and funny.  The decor of the restaurant is a little strange, but with the view of the city and all the restaurant offers, that hardly matters.  (My mouth is watering just thinking about this.)"}
{"text":"Everything at Monterey Bay is executed from high-quality ingredients and with near perfection. I've never had a bad waiter - even average - and service is always prompt. I recommend making a reservation in the attempt to get a coveted seat by the hug bay windows; however, check out the bar downstairs, as the views are also amazing, and there is normally no wait time to just eat there. Dinner at Monterey Bay is a sure thing: You're sure to have a delicious meal, excellent service, and amazing views."}
{"text":"This restaurant has the best  view of the city Pittsburgh!  Its been newly remodeled with a nice clean more modern design.  We got there a little early so we sat in the lounge its very nice , it also has great view of the city.   No matter where you sit in this restaurant you'll have a great view of the city, all thanks to the way its designed, with floor to ceiling windows.   I had the swordfish for dinner it was very good!   Are waitress was very nice and we had great service."}
{"text":"Monterey Bay is somewhere that I keeping come back to. My family has been coming here for years and their standard of food has not got down.

We always start with the appetizer trio. It is not listed on the menu, but is a great combination of blackened shrimp with a sweet chutney, an ichiban skewer of swordfish, salmon, tuna and a jumbo lump crab cake. Their crab cake is hands down probably the best in the burgh. There is jumbo lump crab in every bite and the aioli with it complements it so well. The skewer was also perfectly cooked and is in an ancho chili aioli. 

For dinner, I had the lobster stuffed with jumbo lump crab, spinach, and a Madeira sauce. The lobster was perfectly cooked and tastes great with the sauce. Probably did not need the crab. My dad got the Chilean sea bass prepared tropical curry style. The mango salsa was delicious with the fish. He also had the potato au gratin and loved it. A side dish definitely shareable for two. 

Finally, for dessert I had the peach cobbler cheesecake. The cheesecake was delicious but the topping was a little thick. Also, they lit a candle for my birthday and the desert was on the house which was nice. 

Overall, I give this place five stars because of the countless times we have come and had delicious food and service. Also you really can't beat the view!"}
{"text":"Even though I didn't give this place 5 stars, it's still really good!!! The fish is so clearly fresh and the preparations are great. For fish lovers, the less you do is more. The chef really does seem to realize that. The chef uses earthy whole ingredients that work really well. I had the Chilean Sea Bass and my husband had the halibut. We both loved our dishes. For an appetizer we had the sampler that included crab cakes, fish skewer, and shrimp. All Sooooo good! The crab cake had so much crab! The sauces everything was paired with was perfect!
For dessert we had the steamed chocolate latte. It was so creative and cute and it tasted fantastic! We devoured the whole thing!!! 

Now onto why I to why I gave this place 4 stars instead of 5. At this price point, I think a stronger critique is more informative. In my opinion, the chef really knows what they are doing with the fish and the sauces, so I wish they would make full entrees. At steakhouses I understand doing sides family style, but I was hoping the chef would prepare a great side that would pair nicely with the fish and sauces. Perhaps other people might prefer a la carte sides, but I prefer the chef to pick it if they know what they are doing and this chef really does! We got tricolor potatoes which were really good. We also got flash fried Brussels sprouts, which were a little greasy. I thought they'd be nice and crunchy, but they were more soggy with grease.

All in all I will definitely go back next time we are in town, but they can stand to improve a few things to make this place perfect!! Oh and service was really good as well. They didn't bother us too much but they were attentive. Definitely the best seafood restaurant I've been to in Pittsburgh and possibly ever!"}
{"text":"To me, this is more of a special occasions restaurant.  And everyone comments on the wonderful seafood, blah blah blah.  But you are going here for the incredible view of the city.  Admit it.  As for me, I really thought that I was going to get that big fat romantic proposal.  But if you've seen my finger, it's still bare naked."}
{"text":"Fabulous view, cozy atmosphere, delectable cuisine.  Seafood is amazing.  Service very good.  I drop in every time I come to Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"First off, the valet parking was only $6.  My gentlemen's cocktail (a modified Manhattan) was too sweet, and my wife's and sister in law's cocktails not cold enough.  The view is world-class, the service was excelent and the food may be Pittsburgh's best."}
{"text":"I'm not familiar with Pittsburgh at all, but me and my fianc√© were downtown and decided to google search seafood, and this is where we landed! 
After pulling up and dropping your car off with valet and taking a glass elevator up several floors, you arrive at Monterey Bay Fish Grotto, overlooking the heart of Pittsburgh while you eat the best seafood around. It's a very nice, presentable, classy atmosphere. We ate in the lounge, it was dimmer with candles lit on the table.

We just ordered a bunch of appetizers, our table was over full for just the two of us, but we managed to eat almost all of it! Our drinks were a sparkling ros√®, we liked them so much that we saved the name and when we got home ordered 6 bottles from a local wine dealer.
All the the food was fantastic, then we got to the part I wasn't expecting... dessert. There on the menu was something called angel food cake grilled cheese, I had to have it. After one bite, it became and still is the greatest tasting thing I've ever put in my mouth. Now, I live probably 80 miles from this place, and probably for a good reason, I would be eating angel food cake grilled cheese every day. 
This is a quality place with a quality price tag, we enjoyed an afternoon of fine dining and spent around $200 for the two of us. Given what we got, it's worth every penny."}
{"text":"Perfect view, great food, had the grouper and loved it!  I thought the sever in the downstairs bar was inexperience, but loved our sever for dinner, can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"One of the best meals I've had! Took a couple clients here - the views, service and quality of fish rivals that of any on the coast. Halibut with Thai Peanut, risotto, beet salad with the angel food grilled cheese (yeah, really) - absolutely amazing!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and the experience is always top notch. The menu is always full of delicious options and the new sushi bar is serving up some of the best sushi in the city. I highly recommend this restaurant for a great meal or a special celebration."}
{"text":"Best scallops I've had in a long time!  Service was great and friendly and the atmosphere was a great balance of trendy, sophisticated and comfortable.

We got the calamari as an appetizer, which was just fried enough to have a good breading, but still enough of a calamari chew that you lost that flavor.

For our entrees, we got the Jumbo Scallops and the Swordfish (parmesan style).  I wasn't sure how you could stuff scallops, but they were just cut in the middle, and stuffed with Monterey Bay's famous crab cake.  Both were seasoned and cooked to perfection.  The parmesan crust on the swordfish was perfectly crispy and the fish was cooked to melt in your mouth, truly \"the filet mignon of the sea.\"

After eating bread, the app, and our entrees, we both were very full and satisfied, when usually I'm left not feeling overly full after eating seafood.

Highly recommended for any special event or just a nice night out.  The price is worth way more than just the view, the entire experience was unforgettable!"}
{"text":"Really nice place. The view... oh, the view is best in town! The food is amazing .  Try the fish - best selection I have seen! Try the dessert.  Very original! Reasonably price for a place like that!"}
{"text":"Worth a visit just for the view! This is definitely the spot to bring visiting friends or relatives. 

The food was quite good. We ordered the filet mignon and the swordfish, which were both tasty. The saut√©ed zucchini and squash medley was a bit bland and disappointing. Angelfood grilled cheese for dessert is a must-try!

I actually liked the giant painted palm trees in the dining room (admittedly, they looked much better at night), but I do agree with other reviews that the decor needs updating. The rope lighting and blue neon lights around the bar have got to go. The place has an overall feeling of being outdated (and not in a classy, ironic way)."}
{"text":"Food, service, and location was excellent. I feel like they may charge more on the food due to the beautiful view, but it was worth it. I had the crab cakes and my fiance had the filet. Everyone was friendly. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Went here while visiting Pittsburgh and boy were we wow'ed. We went without a reservation and they we able to get us in right away. The view is amazing!! Service by Holly was great. She was helpful with making our dinner choices. I had the parmesan crusted halibut and hubby had the caribean sea bass. Both were great. And since we were celebrating our anniversary, Holly brought us a dessert on the house. Rocky road cake! Amazing. If ever back in town, we will be back here."}
{"text":"I had the most positive and best birthday dinner I could ever imagine here. I was joined with a girlfriend who was treating me. Our waiter was very professional and gave us dining recommendations.

We started off with a glass of wine. I had the signature crab cakes with a side of asparagus and red peppers. My girlfriend ordered the surf and turf. Both meals were exceptionally delicious. We had bread with our meal as well. Please note that everything here is ala carte and there is no Wi Fi. Valet parking is $6.00. There is no self parking.

Before I ordered dessert the waiter told me it was on the house and I ordered a while chocolate mousse with praline cookies. It came with a candle and two plates for us to share. It was very good. We sat at a table that overlooked the city and had pictures taken.

Our waiter did everything to make my birthday special. This is one of the best seafood restaurants in Pittsburgh and will gladly come again."}
{"text":"I find very few places in Pittsburgh in regards to fish and seafood as good as Monterrey Bay. Mitchell's is good, buts lacks the ambiance. 

First, how fresh can it be having to be flown from all over the globe to get here? Which leads me to the Crab cakes. This has to be all crab, I see no filler whatsoever. And it tastes like it's right out of the ocean. Pricey, but let's be honest, how can you put a price on the delicate, flakey jumbo lump crab cakes? 

The view is second to none. The wine list is superb, the service is wonderful. I wouldn't hesitate to bring even the staunchest seafood snob to Monterrey Bay. 

Valet parking available at the entrance."}
{"text":"Best city view in the U.S. And best crab cakes ANYWHERE. And I've had crab cakes. Prices are decent, considering the quality of food. We sat in the bar and had a very knowledgeable bartender wait on us. Although I was tickled to be able to add to his drinkology database.  But back to the food: AWESOME!! So fresh, nicely seasoned and well prepared. The gulf shrimp in Cajun sauce is killer. And the mixed fish kabob challenges you to choose a favorite of the tasty morsels. (I have the names wrong, but you. Ant mess up) The ambiance and service are top notch. This is a must anytime I'm in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Way over priced for mediocre food at best. 

Our party of five found the skimpy Caesar salads wallowing in way too much dressing and so salty it was almost inedible. Of the sides, the best were the fingerling potatoes while the asparagus and beet/butternut squash dishes were flavorless. The oysters on the half shell were the smallest we've seen. Our salmon and crab cake entrees were acceptably good but the whole fish was laden with bones and the calamari was downright awful. We declined dessert and coffee because we feared another over long wait only to be, once again, disappointed with our choices.

We chose Monterey Bay to celebrate our daughters birthday and were expecting to be overwhelmed by a decadent experience. Sadly, Monterey bay gets one star only for its fantastic view of the city and the helpful wine expert."}
{"text":"I went here for my 20th birthday and had an amazing experience. I was in a group of six and we were sat immediately (with reservations) at  a table appropriate for our party. The service was excellent from the hostess to the coat check chick. Each piece of food I had was a delectable morsel of goodness. I had a bite of most of my friends dishes; my favorite was the crab cake that I ordered and the barbecue tuna. As I've said in other reviews, I'm a calamari lover, and theirs didn't quite measure up - but it wasn't terrible enough to take off a star and every other dish on our table was incredible. I would recommend however, taking the trip to the Pittsburgh location if you want an even more luxurious atmosphere."}
{"text":"I went here for my 21st birthday/Valentine's Day. My date and I had reservations and got sat right away. You have to take an elevator up to the restaurant, where there are gorgeous views. We were sat right next to the window, which I highly recommend if you can get it, and had a great view of the city while we dined. I can't comment on the drink selection too much since I was a newb when we went - I had my first alcoholic beverage here. I got the strawberry mojito which was too sweet for my tastes. Our server recommended a wine to pair with the grouper I ordered and it was successful! My date got tuna over forbidden rice and that was delicious too. The server realized it was my birthday and we got the lollipop cake trio for free as well as the manager stopping by to wish me happy birthday. I can't say enough good things about this place. The location, food and service are all at a level that the prices aren't painful. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I was in town for a conference and took one of my customers out for dinner and drinks. I found this place on Yelp and the quality of the service, food and Drinks was outstanding. They have a great wine list with a bottle that will suit any palate. 

The she bisque was outstanding, crab cakes were pure crab and the Salmon preparation was delicious. We finished off the night with the Fosters Banana Cheese Cake and Angel Food Cheese Cheese Sandwich. 

I will warn everyone this is a pricy dining experience so if you are in a budget keep that in mind before making reservations. We had 6 in out party and ordered 6 cocktails, 1 $70.00 bottle of Merlot, 3 Apps, 1 salad, 1 Sushi Roll and 4 She Bisque Soup, 6 entrees and 3 deserts. Total check came to a littleOut bill was was over $650.00 without the tip. However, in my opinion it was well worth it!"}
{"text":"I've been to Monterey Bay once for a business lunch and once for dinner with a large group.  Both times were very good--food was good, service excellent, and obviously the views are spectacular.  I read the comments about the outdated decor and agree, but I don't find that a major detraction, and really, it's all about the views, anyway.  

The crowd on the Friday night I went for dinner included a lot of very well-dressed older men and very pretty younger women, people obviously on their first dates, to couple who looked like they had been married for 60 years.  It was pretty good people watching.    

I wavered on 3 or 4 stars only because right now I don't go out of my way to visit there--which is what I typically have to do at minimum to give something 4 stars.  As I was sitting here writing, though, it occurred to me that I SHOULD be going there more often with out-of-town guests--it is probably the best thing I've seen up on Mt. Washington, though I haven't been to Isabella's yet (and know it always gets pretty good reviews, too).  And that is a great way to enjoy one of the most livable cities in the world!"}
{"text":"This was my first time there, and I will definitely be back! We got the jumbo scallops & the lobster & crab mac n' cheese. Both were delicious! Our waitress was extremely efficient and helpful! The food is very pricy, however; it's all fresh. The view from our table was absolutely beautiful."}
{"text":"We took my Dad to dinner for his birthday. The food is very delicious with breathtaking views of Pittsburgh. The waitstaff was wonderful and takes very good care of you. It made for a very special night. We had reservation for a window seat, I highly recommend this restaurant with its stunning views."}
{"text":"The food was delicious  and the menu design allows for you to construct a perfect meal for you (you choose your fish and can pair it with and prep you would prefer, and order your side separately). The desert makes the night, you have to get the angel food grilled cheese sandwich (it sounds strange but it's to die for)."}
{"text":"This place was AMAZING! My family and I have been to many fish and steakhouses before but this one was truly remarkable! 

First of all, it's a beautiful restaurant with a gorgeous view! Unfortunately, we didn't get the view of the city but we still got to watch a beautiful sunset as we enjoyed our meals. This place is so accommodating. We walked in without a reservation and luckily someone just canceled their reservation so we got their table! We were so lucky! The staff was very polite as well. 

On the menu, there were over 15 different fish to order. It was amazing! My father got the Walu cooked in the Caribbean style and loved it! I got one of their specials, the Surf and Turf. It was absolutely amazing! For dessert, we all shared the Angel Food Cake Grilled Cheese. OH MY GOD IT WAS SO GOOD! Give this dessert a try because it's absolutely amazing! 

I strongly suggest going to the restaurant. It was a great experience for my family."}
{"text":"Full Disclosure (We were the guests of my fiances employers i.e., didn't pay)

As for the decor, we were seated in a private room with a lot of floor length windows looking out at the wonderful view so I wasn't really paying attention to what some refer as outdated decor. 

We started off with a drink at the bar he had a rum and coke (very strong!) and I had a very well balanced cosmopolitan made with fresh lime juice (huge plus over the bottled stuff)

They had set up a menu for us with a salad, choice of entree and shared dessert platter. 

Even though the bread looked like just the take and bake variety they were wonderful (someone at our table even wanted to steal the bread basket from the other table to get more)

The salad was excellent and had a passion fruit dressing that I would love to buy and use everyday on my salads. 

For my entree I had the grilled swordfish oscar style (crab meat, asparagus, and hollindaise (spelling?))  this was excellent, there was just enough hollindaise to add richness, but not to much that it was swimming in it.  The fish was also cooked perfectly.   

My fiance had the tuna seared rare with some type of sesame sauce that was out of this world.  I am not a huge fan of tuna and I stole two pieces :). 

The portion sizes were outrageous.  I can't speak for the everyday portions, but these were more than generous. 

The dessert platter had key lime tarts, mini cheesecakes, truffles, and a chocolate mouse. 

I tried the key lime tart good, but a bit to sweet and the chocolate truffle which was just the perfect size and sweet bite to end the meal. 

Now being on the budget we are on and saving for a wedding, this place is not one I expected to be able to try for a long time, but the food was wonderful and I am glad we had the chance to enjoy it!"}
{"text":"Have been going here since it opened. Always loved it.  Since they changed owners and made massive changes in their dining room and menu, it is mediocre at best.  Extremely pricey. Dinners average $38-40 and that doesn't include anything. A salad is an additional $8-10 and sides start about $8.  The selection on the menu has been significantly reduced as well as the optional choices they always gave you in how they prepare the food. Very disappointing.  Seems like the new owners bought the name only. There are better restaurants of this caliber which have a better selection and less pricey."}
{"text":"High quality food, good service, and a view of the golden triangle that's hard to beat.  It's not the kind of place for a regular meal because the prices are helping to pay for the view, but great for a special occasion.  We came here for our 10th anniversary and showed up as soon as it opened to make sure we got the table w/ the best view - guaranteed to remove panties.  Crab cakes are delicious and the \"angel food cake grilled cheese\" desert is something we'd never seen before, but highly recommend!  Our waitress was a hoot and was there anytime we even began to think of needing something.  The ambiance was nice and we'll definitely be back, but only for a special occasion."}
{"text":"First time since the remodel and its a step up but antiseptic not chic.  Ordered drinks and for the one cocktail the bartender just waved the bottle over the glass.  Grilled wedge was OK at best.  Scallops and crabmeat was OK at best and minimal in portion.  Filet was bland as bland could be, ahi tuna was ok but nothing spectacular, gratin potatoes were best part of the meal.  Service was lackluster, water filler was totally annoyed being there that the hostess podium was the hangout space for the unused servers....restaurant was 2/3 empty and for good reason.  If you want a meal with a view go to Altius"}
{"text":"Went here for grandsons graduation dinner. Amazing food,service and views. Would go back again."}
{"text":"Great view and good food; nice for a business lunch or dinner"}
{"text":"This place is beautiful. The food is okay but very expensive. The reason for one star is that one of our party became violently ill after dining there. We believe it could be food poisoning related to the walleye. When I called to report this to management I did not get an empathetic response. The message I got was essentially \"not our fault\". No caring whatsoever. In looking at other postings I saw other reports of possible food poisoning. While we do not know if our food poisoning was related to the restaurant be forewarned that you will not get a sympathetic ear if you report it."}
{"text":"This review is only for the M'ville location.  The quality of food here is just as good as the Mt. Washington restaurant.  However, the service and location are another story.  I went there today for a nice holiday lunch with friends.  We usually eat at more pedestrian places when we have lunch like T.G. Mcfunsters.. .and the like, but it being a holiday weekend.  Anyways, we get there and the place is relatively empty, but they still try to seat us at the worst table in the place.  I object and incur a pretty sarcastic \"Well sit wherever you want then\"  After being seated it's almost 20 minutes till we get our water.  I'm guessing punishment for my request.  The server arrives we order a variety of appetizers.  The crabcake is excellent and a must order whenever you  visit.  The calmari is pretty average and the ichiban is good.  The salads are pretty weak (typically this small item can tell you a lot about a restaurant).  One of us gets the Swordfish parmasan style... and as much as I would like to say it wasn't good, it was awesome!  Definitely not a light dish,  but really well executed.  I get a salmon dish with crabmeat and a cream sauce and again cooked perfectly and delicious.  I know by now I'm sounding Bi-polar with this review.   We also had another salmon dish that was perfect.  The food did make up for the service which continued to be off with us waiting for much of the food and the check.  I think we spent almost 2 hours here for what should have been an hour tops.  The location is attached to a mall, which makes no sense at all and really takes away from the food.  I really don't understand the choice to be located next to a JCPenny and a starbucks.  Anyways, bottom line they really do have some of the best Fish in Pittsburgh (maybe the best).  But, I definitely don't recommend this location go to Mt. Washington you can have the same high quality food without the poor service or location."}
{"text":"So, I find myself spending more and more time here lately since a friend recently moved into the apartments in the same building.  I've been going here for years and am definitely a a fan.  The valet parking is good, however a pet peeve is that you have to pay to valet.  I always think this should be complimentary with fine dining.  The elevator takes a fortnight to arrive to the top floor dining room is another small annoyance, but everything else is pretty close to five stars.  The main dining room is gorgeous with the best view of the burgh' or any city for that matter that you can have.  The hand painted palm trees are very nice and relaxing and the furniture is adequate.  They have plenty of space on the lower floor for big functions. I've had events in these big rooms for 50 to 100 folks multiple times.  However, a must visit is the wine room.  It is amazing.  You have three oak tables in a small room with wine bottles and floor to ceiling glass all around you.  Ask for Pat he is a great server and a true pro with respect to his craft.  He also always remembers me even though I haven't used the room for years.  They say the room seats 27 (3 tables of 9), but I don't suggest more than 24 in this space.  If you use this room you need at least 8 folks' and you have to choose one of the wine tasting menus.  They are $95 or $120 I believe for each 5 course wine tasting.  I suggest if you are going to use this room to splurge for the $120.  It's much better wine and includes a champagne toast.  This obviously is not a room I'd use often, but perfect for special occassions.  More and more I find myself simply sitting at the bar.  It has a great lounge and bar area, with plenty of seating.  If you find yourself in a bind to get a table in the dining room you can almost always find a table in the lounge with the same menu.  I've probably been here almost once a week the past couple months.  The bartenders are really good and definitely take care of there regulars.  As an aside, this place is also like the \"melrose place\" of Pittsburgh with many single folks choosing to stay in this building which has the restaurant located on the top floor.  The food is pretty much the best fish in Pittsburgh and less pricey than the some of the other fish joints like \"original fish market\".  My only complaint with the menu is that I wish they offered more shellfish options like crab and lobster and not just crab cakes (which btw are probably the best in the city, which is saying a lot for a town that loves crabcakes).   Some recent menu highlights have been the oysters rockefeller. I'd say skip this.  It was super heavy with a thick hollandaise, too much cheese and breadcrumbs.  The \"ahi\" tempura was really great and I found to be somewhat of a paradox in that it's close to raw great quality fish, but they find a way to put a light breading on it and deep fry it without the fish being overcooked.  My new favorite menu item.  The ichiban is good which is just a skewer of medium rare fish.  I also found the filet to be of great quality and reasonablyu priced for a \"prime\": cut for $37 for 10 oz.  You literally can't go wrong with any fish dish you choose, I'll just offer a couple suggestions.  If you want something rich and deeply flavored try the swordfish parmasan style.  It's very rich, but soooo delicious.  If you prefer something lighter with a lot of flavor try the Ahi Tuna sashimi style.  It's fantastic.  The prices are reasonable, service is good, and it's the perfect spot for out of town guests.  Definitely one of my Pgh. favs'."}
{"text":"Digusting red snapper! Dry salty just disgusting.  My only regret was not returning the 30 dollars dish.  However, everything was good except for the darn frozen red snapper they served me.  I ate Garbage.  The Chilean sea bass was excellent.  The lobster mac was amazing!  I just feel robbed cause the red snapper tasted like dead fish they bought from Florida.  I would stick to the Chilean Sea Bass.  I wouldn't go again....so mad with the freaking red snapper which tasted like dry salty ham from Aldi's."}
{"text":"Went here with a group. Setting is nice, with a phenomenal view overlooking the city. All the men in our group wore slacks and a button down with a suit-jacket, and all the women were either in nice (but casual) dresses, or dress pants. Our waiter was certainly knowledgeable, about both food and drinks.

We started with a seafood appetizer trio (crab cake, sashimi, Cajun shrimp) that was all excellent. The shrimp particularly had a strong (and a little spicy) flavor. We also had the oysters and bread. The butter was definitely a hit at the table.

For the main course, I ordered the sesame tuna. They give you sizable portions, maybe even a little too large (at least for me, after all the appetizers). Not much on the tuna, so the flavor of the fish certainly comes out.

For dessert, I had the pot de creme. The vanilla flavor came out beautifully, and the biscuit and berries that came out with it paired well. My partner ordered the rhubarb strudel, with two large pieces -couldn't finish it. That said, the flavor was great and there a little brulee action on the bottom that gave the strudel a nice crunch. 

This would be a great place for a special event. Probably a little over-priced, but the view truly is worth it, and overall, the food was excellent!"}
{"text":"There is no finer place for seafood in Pittsburgh. I go with my wife every year and only expect it to get better as the new renovations are completed. try the Ahi Tuna sesame style. Good God! It is however, a bit expensive. Expect to drop about $200 there but in my world its worth every penny!"}
{"text":"Came here with some co-workers for dinner. It was not really busy. When I first walked in, it was a bit outdated. When we got to the top floor I as surprised to see how big the restaurant was. The views are amazing, we got to see the sunset which was really nice. They have a great wine list. The food (I got the sea bass) was really good and cooked perfect. I can see why people recommend this place, they do have great seafood. Everyone at my table enjoyed their meal. The waitress we had was very attentive and manager checked in on our table as well. The desserts they have were good too. I really like this place but they do need to update decor. The have on the lower lever of the restaurant a bar area which is a great place to look out at the view and have drinks. Very laid back but classy atmosphere."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in Pittsburgh. Tasteful and elegant. Staff is very friendly and the food is always delicious. Great wine selection and atmosphere. Definitely a place to try when in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"The view is undeniably amazing. The service is shockingly average considering the price point. The food is par for the course. Perhaps the average fish/seafood diner prefers wine, but when you ask if there is a draft list or what exactly the seasonal beers are, you would think a server in such an establishment would respond with more than just, \"I don't know. It's what's listed there.\" I guess it's too much work to find out the answer? The Ichiban appetizer is tried 'n true. The fish selection and preparations are still somewhat unique, but the portion size was small and overall a far cry from the day of yore. The roasted, tri-color potatoes were average and monochrome. The dessert was the only thing keeping this review from two stars since a birthday was being celebrated. Disappointing."}
{"text":"The view is amazing easily carries the issues I have with the palm trees. The best place to take visiting guests who you want to be impressed with our city."}
{"text":"I went here with a group of coworkers for our staff holiday lunch arranged and paid for by the chair of our department. All I can say is WOW and if you go you absolutely MUST order the crab cake. This is seriously in the top two crab cakes that I've had in my life.  We also had the eggplant rolletini and calamari appetizers which we shared and both were excellent. A few others had The salmon as their entrees and one had the she crab soup. The desserts were equally spectacular as their savory counterparts. The choices were the angel food grilled cheese sandwich and The dark chocolate truffle cake. No one was disappointed by the end of lunch and everyone left full and happy. They also have a very nice wine list. The view from the party room was spectacular and the wait staff were very happy and attentive. The overall decor if the restaurant is still reminiscent of when it was Christopher's back in the day and that is honestly the only criticism that I have is that the decor is a bit outdated."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here, as he's never been to Pittsburgh. The first thing I have to say is definitely make a reservation and ask and wait for a window table when you arrive. Our reservation was for 8:30 and we were seated at a window table by 9:00. It's worth the little wait!! Amazing view!!!! While we were waiting, we had drinks in the lounge area. We had a nigiri/sashimi plate and an incline roll for appetizers. Both were great and SO fresh for being sushi in PA. For dinner, we split a crab cake entree because we were getting full from the apps... which was easily the best crab cake I have ever had...it's not really breaded like most crab cakes...it's slightly torched. Our server was also great! The entire staff is so professional and make the experience. Also...the green onion butter is to die for! It's sometimes a gamble with upscale restaurants bc sometimes the atmosphere is what you really pay for while the food is subpar...this is definitely not the case here! Worth the prices!!"}
{"text":"To start, the views are impressive! If you gave stars for that it would be a 5. But the food was unimpressive to say the least.

The tuna was fishy, slimy, and so off putting I had to step away from the table.

I can not believe that a fish house would allow that level of fish to be served.

The other only good note was the service."}
{"text":"Very good food prepared the way it is intended to be enjoyed. 
One of my table mate's ordered Sushi grade tuna but for what ever reason chose to have it cooked well done or heated through. In my opinion that destroyed everything that makes sushi/sashimi food unique taste and mouth feel. He should have just ordered the blackened swordfish. My Scallops were awesome, cooked perfectly with not a bit of chewing gum style shellfish."}
{"text":"I love fish-- any kind of fish. And moving from the Jersey shore to Pittsburgh was a hard blow to my fish-loving self. However, Monterey Bay is THE BEST place to get seafood in Pittsburgh. Come prepared to spend money, because good fish in Pittsburgh is not cheap. I really enjoyed their Chilean Sea Bass, oysters, swordfish, and blue-fin tuna. 

Try to sit by the window-- especially at sunset. A gorgeous view of the three rivers is the perfect complement to a delicious meal."}
{"text":"My wife and I made reservations almost a month in advance after doing some extensive research. I was in Pittsburgh on business a few weeks ago and it happened to coincide with my birthday weekend so she joined me for a couple of days.

The ambiance is fantastic, modern and sophisticated and its location offers views that are hard to match. 

We started the night with the Roasted Butternut and Beets Salad. Because it was not really in season it did not have butternut squash but it was still a great, earthy and sweet salad.

My wife followed with the Two MB Signature Crab Cakes which were perfectly seasoned and had great texture, something that many restaurants struggle with.

I had the Chimichurri Chilean Sea Bass and being from Argentina I must confess that I am very particular as to what carries the \"chimichurri\" label. That said, I am excited to report that it held true to its roots. The outside was firm, almost crispy while the meat remained soft, moist and flaky. A little salt and not much else was used to prevent the combination of the chimichurri and other spices from overpowering this sweet and delicate fish. I added two Seared Jumbo Sea Scallops and they were expertly prepared and accompanied by a lemon wedge wrapped in fine cloth.The presentation of such a simple dish was perfect.

As a side we shared the the Fried Brussel Sprouts which were cooked with bacon and a balsamic reduction that complemented them very well.

I was, at first, a bit worried about the wine list as I didn't see anything I would consider a high end wine, by the glass. I was pleasantly surprised, however, after trying a Malbec from WA (again, being from Argentina I am a bit of a snub when it comes to this wine) that left me wanting more and so I enjoyed a second glass. Try the Waterbrook Malbec if you like a medium body wine that pairs great with almost everything.

For desert we were served a complimentary Creme Br√ªl√©e that was delicious. We decided to take it back to the hotel for a midnight snack.

If you find yourself in Pittsburgh and want to enjoy more than just a great meal, Monterrey Fish Grotto should earn a spot on your short list. Chin Chin!"}
{"text":"It's my 500th review! What better way to commemorate that than with a 5-star review?

For my xxth birthday (after all, you're never supposed to ask a woman her age. I'll leave the actual number up to your imagination), my boyfriend took me here for dinner. It's right up the Duquesne incline so if you're sitting by the window, you'll get an amazing view of Pittsburgh.

Everything from the beginning to the end was fantastic. Our waiter (I wish I could remember his name but I did have a few birthday drinks that night after all) was really attentive and nice - he even helped us snap a few pictures at the end of the night, even though I'm sure he was super busy.

For my entree, I went with the parmesan rockfish (Parmesan coated with lemon peppercorn cream). It was amazing. The cream sauce wasn't too heavy, which is something hard to find when ordering something with a cream sauce.

My boyfriend had the chimichurri swordfish (cilantro, basil, chile lime sauce), which tasted really refreshing. It would have went really well with a side salad.

None of the fish dishes come with sides, so we decided to get the lobster crab mac and cheese to share. This came out piping hot and cheesy, and you could actually taste the chunks of shellfish.

We ended up eating a little bit of everything and we were stuffed. To top it all off, they gave us a complimentary birthday dessert (anything from the dessert menu). I chose this pineapple cake thing which was pretty good, and not overly sweet. We also ordered the angel food grilled cheese sandwich, which our waiter said was their most popular. It's caramel iced Angel food cake, cream cheese filling, berry compote, vanilla ice cream, and toasted almonds. This was a little too sweet for me but the vanilla ice cream definitely helped balance it out a bit.

We ate our leftover fish the next day and it still tasted great - not something you can say too often about day-old microwaved fish.

Who knew you could get such fresh seafood in Pittsburgh?! Would definitely recommend if you're in town and are looking for dinner with a view."}
{"text":"The view is awesome.  Fish was excellent.   Had the grilled cheese sandwich  (yes that is what they call it) for dessert.  Treated our anniversary dinner very well."}
{"text":"Amazing view. Superb appetizers. Great wine list and fabulous food. The standout was, of all things... Brussels Sprout, which I hate!!!!, but tried. They were delicious. 
Pittsburgh is not known for great food - but this restaurant was AMAZING!"}
{"text":"This visit was amazing! Great food and great service . Sit high and view the city. If there were more stars I would give them"}
{"text":"We eat out 4-5 nights a week so are familiar with local restaurants and pricing. We thought it was very overpriced. It was a Thursday night and the restaurant only had 3 tables filled between 7:00-9:00. The fish was priced from $28-$36 for average sized portions and did not include a starch or vegetable. The side dishes were priced around $8.
The food was nice and the atmosphere lovely. Our server simply tolerated us.
$125 for dinner for two which included only 1 glass of wine."}
