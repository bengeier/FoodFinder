{"text":"One of the worst dining experiences EVER!  Spicy Thai Noodle dish tasted like bad takeout, Curry Noodle Soup was bland and flavourless, Udon noodles were disgusting.  Service was slow and terrible.  Made me and my spouse really sick and waste the rest of the afternoon."}
{"text":"we enjoyed our meals their coconut soup was not very good but the other one was OK, they have the same desserts like any other asian place but their green tea ice cream is ace and the vanilla one with fried banana is amazing their main courses were really nice, i did not get heartburn they were not oily..."}
{"text":"The atmosphere of Green Basil is quite welcoming and lends itself well to intimate dining as well as parties of 3-6. I would advise parties of more than 6 to call ahead, unless you don't mind the possibility of being split up.  Dress attire is casual to classy. The staff is very friendly and informative. I am endlessly impressed with how they take orders without pen and paper - pure memorization, even when customizations or substitutions are requested.  A knife and fork is provided on the table when you sit. Spoons accompany any soup you order or at request. Chop sticks are available upon request, and often you will be asked when severed your meal if you would like them.  The kitchen is not visible. Washrooms are clean and well maintained. DÃ©cor is Thai-influenced and upscale without being pretentious.  The menu (also viewable at their website) is large without being bloated. The food is very fresh, not salty, and quite delicious. I've sampled several items from their menu and all have been excellent. I enjoy the multiple tastes they blend into each dish. I am also pleased by the fact the food is quite filling. That said, I believe their portion sizes have shrunk a little since they opened, and their prices have crept up a little in the past few months. I no longer visit them as often as I used to, but they are still a favourite place to bring guests or visit for special occasions or dates.  The desert menu is modest, at the time of this review only 3 options. In light of the variety of appetizers and main dishes I'm surprised they don't offer more in the way of desert.  Green Basil is located in a lovely neighbourhood with plenty of interesting shops and cafes (can you say 'after-dinner desert'?) and just steps away from the beach. Convenient buss and streetcar service makes getting there a snap, and there is plenty of nearby parking on the street, side-streets or Green P.  Note: The actual restaurant is larger than the pictures here indicate. There is another set of booths on the other side of the middle row. Check out their website for better pictures."}
{"text":"If you want the ultimate bizzaro dining experience, this is it.  My wife and I went there for a second time this past Monday. Our first experience was marred with having pieces of foil in her pad thai. This time, it improved a touch, but was as strange a dinner as we've had.  Both of us ordered soups to start - she had the Won Ton which was great. I ordered their version of the Tom Kha Gai, which was anything but. Better half ordered the red chicken curry, I ordered the Curry Pad Thai.   When my soup did arrive, it basically should be called \"some curry in a soup with a ton of floating mushrooms\". It was essentially tasteless.  So the main course was my appetizer, the soup was bland and the service was spotty.  Compared to uptown places like Joy Thai, this place really needs some work. As well, the chairs almost all have worn leather and are falling apart.  Time for a revamp of more things than one here. The table across from us also complained that their food was cold, and staff were seen having a terse conversation that could be heard by all.   All in all, a strange visit."}
{"text":"Our server introduced herself as Miss Good Looking and it was all fun and games from then on plus some good food. The mango salad was good and the red curry chicken was a winner. Make sure to ask for Miss Good Looking on Friday night she is a blast!"}
{"text":"This place is the best! I ordered a lunch combo of green curry and it came with everything for only 10 bucks! Delicious mango salad that was very fresh. Green curry was so flavourful! The best I've had in months. This is going to be my new go-to place :)"}
{"text":"We used to get take out from Green Basil on a reg basis, but the quality has slowly been getting worse. The last time we ordered, there were almost no shrimp in the shrimp pad thai and the chicken in the stirfry tasted like it had freezer burn. It was actually bad enough that we called to let them know, but the person on the phone was indifferent and didn't offer any compensation, although we'd been ordering from there for years. Too bad:("}
{"text":"I had The Pad Thai- it was a generous portion, very tasty. It's a nice looking place and the staff was attentive. I would go back."}
{"text":"I like their coconut chicken soup. Unfortunately the rest of the food has been pretty hit or miss for me. I had an excellent pad Thai there a few weeks ago, with good consistency and big shrimp.  Today I had a pathetic pad Thai with no shrimp, that I only had a few bites of and left the rest there.   I do not plan to go back there for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"I don't know why it took me so many years living in the Beaches to try this place. Somehow I had a prejudice that Asian food in the Beaches was not going to be right. Well my wife wanted somethings spicy so we had the Spicy Thai Noodles with Chicken, and  the Yellow Beef Curry. OMG! Really awesome. We'll definitely be ordering here again."}
{"text":"Compared to the vast majority of restaurants in The Beach - this one is at least clean and has a contemporary and welcoming design. Their Tom Yum Soup with Chicken is pretty great. I order it via takeout all the time. Big portion size w/ excellent flavour. The price is typical ($10-12) and on par w/ other Thai restaurants. Their chicken and vegetable spring rolls are also quite good. I haven't been impressed with their Chicken Pad Thai - it's a little too saucy and a bit too bland for my taste. I wish it was spicier and drier. Their Mango Chicken is also only okay.  I've eaten at better Thai restaurants in Toronto, but it's definitely the best one in The Beach. Service is good for both takeout and sit down."}
{"text":"I had the pineapple fried rice and I was so disappointed.  I ate less than half of it and didn't even want to take the rest home.  It was soggy, clumpy and flavourless.  I have had Thai fried rice at many places even in Thailand so I know what a good fried rice should be like and this was just unacceptable."}
{"text":"Had a great experience as usual last night - ordered through the JustEat app and got 20% off my order. Even with it being New Years, my order was exactly on time, accurate and delicious!  The Beef Curry and Crispy beef are ultimate.  Also had green curry chicken, chilli chicken, mushroom soup, and mango salad. All were awesome!  A lot of food for 2 people but the best part of take out is left overs!"}
{"text":"Love this place, especially in the winter - big sunny windows are perfect for people watching. The Green chicken curry is fantastic. I loved LOVED the mango salad, but I think it's off the menu now, which is a shame. The crispy beef is also great, but the rest of the salads are not my taste. I would be over the moon if they brought back the mango!"}
{"text":"Best Thai food in the beaches in my opinion! Green curry, cashew chicken, pad thai, and mango salad are all fantastic. Portion sizes are good and the service (delivery included) is super fast and efficient"}
{"text":"The food is ok (The Thai House across the street is better), but the service is extremely lacking. It's like nobody who works there care about customer service - customers are a bit inconvenient. The last three times I've tried this place, the following has happened;  - ordering take out: twice I've had to bang on the kitchen door after waiting for 5 mins at the counter, because the counter and wait staff were back there laughing and joking and NOT checking on tables (meanwhile there were dirty dishes etc., on tables).  - ordering delivery: ordered at 4:30pm, received confirmation email that order would arrive by 5:30 or sooner. It arrived at 6:15 with no apologies. When we phoned (3x) to enquire about the order, we were told that we only ordered it at 5:30 (in spite of our email confirmation to the contrary) and THEN that it was on the way. And again, 15 minutes later it was still on the way but they didn't know where the driver was. When I asked for a refund I was told the Manager would have to do that, and they didn't know where he was. Oh wait! They remembered! He was the delivery guy. Aiyiyi. Anyway, the food was only in a plastic bag but still warm which means they didn't get it ready until shortly before they delivered. Needless to say, it was a lot of work for food you can get equal or better at places where customer service actually exists."}
{"text":"This place is OK, but not great! There are a few items on the menu that are delicious and other items that are sub par. I highly recommend the Green Chicken Curry. It's the best Green Curry dish I've had at any Thai restaurant! Their Crispy Beef is also pretty good along with the Red Peanut Chicken Curry. I do not recommend their Pad Thai or the Cashew Nut Chicken. If you go to this place, check out their deals on Menu Palace."}
{"text":"Found the food to be drowned in \"sauce\". Noodles were over cooked and mushy. There wasn't one \"whole\" noodle in my plate as they had all broken apart. If I hadn't eaten all day, I would have sent the food back. There was no taste to any of the sauces and it seemed to be right out of a bottle."}
{"text":"Stopped in for Lunch Friday and was pleasantly surprised. More than enough food for a quick lunch.   I had the Crispy Beef with the Mango Salad, tasty. Tried a bite of the Cashew Chicken and the Green Curry and it had no complaints. Nice little place to grab a bit of Thai while visiting the shops in the Beach,"}
{"text":"Great service, awesome food. We went here in a very busy Sunday afternoon. The green curry is on par with the best I have had...maybe even better. The shrimp toast, however, is the best. Just for that, I will come back here again and again. Great place in the beaches for some awesome Thai food..."}
{"text":"Always consistently Delicious food! Lemongrass soup is usually a bit too oily but still keeps me going back.  Pad Thai is cooked to perfection everytime and the Basil Chicken is to die for! I love that they serve shrimp chips everytime and replenish quickly when I bring my kid. The prices are very reasonable, the atmosphere is comfortable and cozy ( esp the booths). Service is always good! Def one of my fav places in the Beaches area and you can always get a coupon from menupalace.com (2 for 1)"}
{"text":"Awesome lunch menu. Very friendly service. Thier curries rock!!!"}
{"text":"Best Thai food in the beaches ! Try the peanut chicken curry! It's a must ! Quick and friendly service. Food is consistently great. Prices are very reasonable and decor is nice. Definitely worth the hype !"}
{"text":"There used to be an amazing Thai place on Queen E. closer to Neville Park. When the place closed down I started my search for a new Thai favourite and after trying all the options found in the neighbourhood I became a regular here.   Location is great and the restaurant has a really nice layout. Booths are super comfortable. Food is amazingly tasty and affordable. The service has always been great. I can't think of anything bad to say about the place."}
{"text":"Great place for a quick fix of you tai cuisine craving"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed Green Basil. We had beef satay, chicken in coconut milk curry with peanuts and pineapple and curry pad thai. The chicken and pad thai were excellent, the satay was pretty good. The dinner was very good value as well - $30 total bill. The service was ok, although it was a busy Friday night so somewhat understandable. One of our best Thai dining experiences, especially for food quality."}
{"text":"I have to go with three stars. My wife thinks I'm being a bit harsh but once you've had truly great Thai food it's hard to compromise. Green Basil has some good dishes though.   The fried glass noddle is good and the pad thai is tasty (although pad thai is like pizza and sex even bad is usually pretty ok).  Some of the curry dishes are also worth mentioning like the peanut curry chicken.  Their downfall is the add unheard of amounts of bell peppers to most of their dishes. So if you like your thai food with lots O bell peppers then you are in for a treat.  If not you might be a bit overwhelmed."}
{"text":"The menu can be a bit hit and miss, but the red curry chicken with a side of coconut rice is amazing!  The chicken is fresh, and plentiful. I usually substitute the long bean for bamboo shoots to add a little extra flavour and texture.  The downfall is the delivery time. You can expect your foid to arrive 60+ minutes from your order."}
{"text":"This is our \"go to\" Thai restaurant when we are in the Beach neighbourhood.  The pad thai is to die for.  We always order the Thom Yum soup which is usually enough for two people.  If you like it spicy, you should let the waiter know this when you order. LOVE their Mango Salad!!  I could just eat this alone for dinner.  All their curries are great, but my fav is the green curry.  We usually order too many dishes and end up taking the rest home for lunch or dinner the next day.   We go there sometime during the lunch time because they have great lunch specials.  We order one lunch dish and my hubby and I split it between the tow of us.  It is that large!  And the price is only $8.95.    I agree that their desert menu is not great but we usually end up with the fried banana with ice cream.    We like the decor and the restaurant is very spacious.    Overall, the service is good but the food is delicious.  We'll be back soon."}
{"text":"I ordered take our from this location. The food arrived hot and was delicious. The delivery also came much sooner than expected! The pad Thai and mango salad were amazing!"}
{"text":"This is not Thai food.  Ordered here for delivery twice.  Second time got sucked in by the complimentary mango salad....regrets. Have had their soup, salad, noodles, fried rice, beef, seafood.  Basically, it's take-out Chinese with a sprinkle of spices here and there to appear \"Thai.\" I guarantee you there's not one Thai employee/owner in this establishment. That ubiquitous balance of sweet/sour/salty/spicy is lacking....actually, non-existent. 1st place ever (in my history of eating out) to serve mushy fried rice. Large portions, but I'd prefer 3/4 the portion for delicious food. Why oh why is this area cursed with such mediocrity in the food scene (wait, what food scene)?  On the plus side, the delivery kid was sweet."}
{"text":"Warming Thai chili spices on a frigid afternoon. Fresh and fast. Cold rice paper spring rolls and grilled chicken. Very tasty."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, clean restaurant.  Descent prices. Great portions.  Great service. Quality of food not up to par, very bland, no flavor."}
{"text":"I always come here on lunch! I think for the price I pay I get a more than fair plate.  I really like the Pad Thai which comes with mango salad and spring roll, but also have tried others and the presentation is always great the stuff is amazing and the taste is very good!  I would recommend if you are around!"}
{"text":"Was OK but not somewhere I would go again but I have to say their spring rolls and manga in sticky rice was good"}
{"text":"Came in today for a little birthday dinner.  At 5pm it wasn't super busy so we were seated quickly at our choice of tables.  We ordered the cashew nut chicken (less spicy), the yellow curry beef which was thicker than I'm used to, and had a good amount of beef and potatoes, and the Malay noodles with chicken.  I didn't like the Malay noodles as much they were a bit uninspiring.  Upon checking in on Yelp and offer for a free mango salad came up.  The restaurant didn't honour it though they said it was old.  The meal overall was just ok."}
{"text":"We love this place. We have been ordering from them for over two years! Great service and our orders are always delivered hot and accurate. We love their crispy beef and there cold rolls. We also love the extra shrimp chips that they always throw in!!! Thanks for being a staple for our takeout in the beaches!!"}
{"text":"Meh. About as good as the one on the Danforth. They don't use jasmine rice and I would honestly pay a few more bucks for the option. Food is good, very generic Thai food. But they have mad cheap lunch specials for 10 bucks."}
{"text":"Solid Thai spot with nice people.  Pick-up orders are ready in about 15 minutes, and the Pad Thai is under $10, all-in.  The standard Pad Thai is a bit ketchupy, but they have an option to use oyster sauce instead (or, go for the curry option).  The restaurant is recently renovated and looks really nice.  High ceilings and nice booths.  Had a great evening on a date there, and the place always has people in it.  I'd definitely recommend going, it's easy on the wallet, the food is good (especially for the price) and it's great to just watch people go by on Queen Street ..."}
{"text":"This restaurant was disappointing for a Thai Restaurant. I went with my friend for lunch. I had a Groupon for $30 to use there. We ordered the Cashew Nut Chicken and Phad Thai. The Cashew Nut Chicken was ok and Phad Thai was not good. The Phad Thai was not authentic and not that good compared to Spring Rolls or Salad King's Phad Thai. They also didn't put much chicken or shrimp on it, I guess they were being cheap with the ingredients. I also ordered these appetizers: Calamari, chicken skewer and beef skewer. The Beef skewer was not good, it was very chewy and I couldn't even eat it. Chicken was ok and calamari was good.  Anyhow, overall I wouuldn't go back to this restaurant. The service is ok. The waiter didn't seem to like the fact that I had a groupon to be used. I only went there for the first time to try it out b/c of my groupon which is like a $30 gift card I bought online for $15 so the meal was like 50% off.   There's much better Thai restaurants out there and this place was not worth the drive for me to drive from the West end all the way to the East end for mediocre Thai food."}
{"text":"Went for lunch today and it was a great deal!  I ordered chicken pad thai lunch deal with mango salad and spring roll, food presentation was well done especially for a lunch item.  Food was quick to come out but server still brought over prawn chips for us to eat while we waited.  They had Sapporo on tap which is always appreciated!  Pad thai was pretty standard, it had a lot of meat in in it compared to other thai restaurants though.  Mango salad was a generous portion and fresh tasting.  The service was good , only issue was when we finished we sat for a while before finally getting up and just asking for the bill.  Restaurant was empty except for us, server could have prompted us to pay at front or brought bill when we said we were done.  Very minor complaint all in all!!  Great thai, great beer, great price!"}
{"text":"We ordered delivery from Green Basil, and sadly, we were pretty disappointed. My wife ordered Pad Thai, her usual choice at Thai restaurants, and it was quite sweet and somewhat ketchup-y. (I've been told that some types of tamarind, the primary spice used in Pad Thai, can taste ketchup-y, but to me it just tastes cheap.) I ordered a \"peanut curry,\" which was apparently their usual red curry with added peanuts, and an order of coconut rice to go with it. The curry was reasonably tasty, but not spectacular, and the coconut rice was tasty enough (it's sort of hard to do wrong.) Our order also qualified for free spring rolls, which were eminently 'meh,' and the (seemingly) standard sweet & spicy dipping sauce, which was also meh.  Delivery, though, was reasonably fast - significantly less than the 45m-1h we were quoted.  I had high hopes for Green Basil, but we were unfortunately disappointed. With better options (like Thai on Danforth) significantly closer to us, I don't think we'll be ordering again."}
{"text":"Great place. We order for pick-up all the time and have never had a complaint. We switched to the Green Basil due to the mouse infestation that had taken root at the Thai restaurant west and on the south side of Queen St. (Just steps from here). Green Basil has not disappointed. Fresh, hot and prompt service!"}
{"text":"Really good place, attention was great at all times to everyone, leave aside the food and the portions. As for the location it is very clean. Would most definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Really good Thai food and the service was great.  Atmosphere in resto was nice too.  But this is a four star because the restaurant was too frigging cold.  This happens regularly at many restaurants.  I guess they're trying to save money on heating costs but damn....turn the f-ing heat up so I can enjoy the food and service!  Oh, they have a win a free mini iPad contest on now....so run down there and eat and drop your ballot in the jar."}
{"text":"Very friendly and attentive service. Clean. Fresh ingredients but unfortunately I have to agree with pad Thai comments from other yelpers : not tasting like a Pad Thai. Too saucy of their in house sauce. It's not that bad tasting it's just that I prefer the original recipe."}
{"text":"This is my favourite Thai restaurant in the city. Food is delicious, very flavorful yet not overpowering. Ingredients are fresh and taste of dishes is very authentic. My favourites are Mango Chicken, Crispy beef, Curry Pad Thai, and Thai Style eggplant. The place also has great service. The owners and staff are very friendly and care about every customer. They also have a beautiful interior and a nice vibe. I have been a regular customer at this place for 5 years and will definitely come back here whenever I have a craving for Thai food!"}
{"text":"Good food. We had their basil rice and beef with bamboo shoots.  They brought the food quickly and the plate was pretty large, more than enough. definitely going back there again."}
{"text":"We stopped for lunch.  The lunch special at $8.95 is good value for money and the quantities were perfect for a light lunch.  My wife had the mango salad and cashew chicken.  I had the  crispy sesame beef with veggies.  The mango salad was excellent, just like I remembered it from our time in Cambodia.  But the meat dishes were not as good as what you'll find at most good restaurants.  My veggies were boring.  The steamed rice was limp."}
