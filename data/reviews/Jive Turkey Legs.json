{"text":"The best smoked turkey leg that I have ever eaten! You can tell that it was cooked from fresh turkey and not those reheated frozen turkey legs. The funnel cakes are also amazing!"}
{"text":"Was looking forward to having a smoked turkey leg at the charlotte Oktoberfest yesterday. This food truck was one of the six food trucks that were participating. They didn't show. The owner said he overslept. Unbelievable. He had 6000 potential customers as a captive audience.  Hard to believe anyone would pass up that opportunity."}
{"text":"Wow! Fantastic food. Fantastic service. Being from Chicago it is hard to find a hot dog I enjoy. Now I know the crazy yet very delicious Carolina dog. The owner was an absolute pleasure to meet. I had expressed that I've never had a turkey leg and he insisted I try! I am glad I did. The meat just fell off the bone it was so nicely cooked. Luxurious flavor and wonderful texture. Next time Jive is around me I will definitely be going!"}
