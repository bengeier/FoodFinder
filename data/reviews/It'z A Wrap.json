{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. I'm regretting that I didn't try this place earlier.  Great choices of ingredients, fresh, and all very good. Good customer service as well. I work nearby and it's been always difficult finding a good meal (quick, reasonable and great taste) in this area. Now I know where to go and where to tell people. Looking forward to many more visits."}
{"text":"I've walked past this place 100 times and have never gone in. Today was the day we finally tried it and what a pleasant surprise.   First, the service was spectacular. The owner was entirely attentive and made my wrap with very fresh ingredients. He even let me substitute certain toppings with others which I thought was nice. The wrap was big and came with a salad with homemade dressing. All of it was very tasty.   I wish I would have tried the homemade chili and will definitely be coming back during my next trip to the neighborhood.   The prices were very reasonable for the amount of food received."}
{"text":"Lived close to here for a year and never knew this place existed. Or else I would have gone here a lot more. I only discovered this place after I moved away, when I watched a YouTube video of shay Carl going in here. Had different experiences each time I went here. The first time the wrap was really good. The second time I got a vegan wrap. I didn't like it. The third time I had the southwestern wrap and it didn't taste as good as the first time. The chicken tasted like it was left over chicken. But a good spot, not a lot of people went here it was hidden. Kinda upset they moved cause I'm never in liberty village."}
{"text":"I had the jerk chicken sandwich on whole wheat with avocado, mushrooms, cooked eggplant, tomatoes, cheddar and arugula.  They grilled it and added butternut squash soup.    Staff was quite exuberant and helped explain the choices.   I would definitely go back.  Very comparable to Sandwich Box.  I'd say its a dollar or two less per sandwich combo."}
{"text":"Love this place! It is truly a hidden gem. It needs more recognition. The wraps are delicious. The first I had this place. Every. Single. Day. I came here to eat for 3 weeks try out everything on the menu and every time I was delighted. I brought alot of coworkers to this place that all enjoyed it.  I recommend getting the chocolate cookies they have on the counter. They are the BEST cookies I've ever had. No joke, try it and see for yourself."}
