{"text":"This is one of the places I go to if I'm craving pasta. Absolutely one one of the best places I've been for great pasta. I ordered the vongole and asked for garlic and oil sauce as I'm not a big fan of any tomato sauce. Friends tried pizza and it was awesome. All six of us at our table loved whatever we had ordered. Only complaint would be that we were tightly seated. We were six at a small table table and we basically had to choreograph our fork movements. We couldn't lean back. If we had to go to the bathroom, we all had to get up. For this reason I would give it a four. It's my only complaint."}
{"text":"We Visited Al Denté on monk-land after many years last night. I have to say the quality of the food is really outstanding and the service is very good our waiter was very friendly and knowledgable. Our food arrived minutes after we placed our order, it was pipping hot and tasty. Our waiter even divide the pizza and the pasta my wife and I were sharing, without me asking (he suggested before he did of course) 
I have to say though, is this place needs a MAJOR MAKE OVER!! Guys please charge a bit more and redo the restaurant, especially the bathrooms,Bad. I won't go back because of that. We were three couples last night."}
{"text":"Solid restaurant that's been around for ages. My parents love it because it's bring-your-own-wine. The pizza is a go-to. Pasta is made on-site."}
{"text":"A wonderful place to bring family or go on a date. The ambiance is well suited to all needs.

The food is splendid and quite original. Yum!"}
{"text":"Wow what great warm crusty bread, nearly filled up on it.  Had the lunch special menu with a choice of salad or soup.  I took the soup, tomato and lintels.  Very good, not too salty.

As the main course, I had the Fazzoletti Con Arragosta.  It's a GIANT pasta filled with lobster and ricotta cheese in a rose sauce.  When I mean giant...think two lasagna strips folded over and closed.  A bit too much sauce for my taste, but people who love tons of sauce would adore this. Skimped a bit on the lobster, tasted more cheese than lobster.

They advertise fresh pasta, it was definitely fresh pasta...cooked perfectly, just like the restaurant name \"Al Dente\" :)  Would give it 4 stars if they had put a bit more lobster and didn't put so much sauce on it, but that's personal taste (sauce amount).

Would eat at this place again and try something else with less sauce in it.  Tough to find parking sometimes because it is on Monkland, to find free parking, go on a side street off Monkland. Easy to miss the sign for the restaurant since it's \"slightly below ground level\"."}
{"text":"I went to Al Dente with my boyfriend and his parents because one of our friends told us it was excellent. I ordered the Risotto Primavera and was disappointed because it lacked flavor. My boyfriend had a different type of Risotto and I tried that to see if it was better but it wasn't.

will go back to try the pizza, because I think that might be better."}
{"text":"We went here with another couple for dinner and chose Al Dente because you can bring your own wine.  It was a first visit for all of us.  The place was very crowded and noisy.  They have an a la carte menu but the four of us chose the table d'hôte which came with soup or salad and coffee.  Everyone enjoyed the food very much.  Service was good and the waiter friendly.  The only negatives were the tables were very close to each other and because of the noise level, we had a difficult time making conversation."}
{"text":"Wasn't too happy with the food but the service was okay. The bathrooms were horribly dirty and out dated. I was trying to was my hands, and there were flies all over near the sink. I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"We've been here for quite a few birthdays, reservations are a must as it's always packed. Their online menu only has pizza and pasta but they always have a table d'hote menu with a choice of salad/soup then fish, osso bucco, and more pasta.
Food and price quality is good but the place is super tight and very loud."}
{"text":"Pizza was good but tiramisu cake was a disaster. I was sick for 2 days, having horrible stomachache. Never take any sweets there!"}
{"text":"I had the white pizza with clams.   It was very good; thin crust and not too oily.  My husband had the spaghetti carbonara but complained the pasta was thinner than regular spaghetti.   The kids enjoyed the cheese pizza and the bread."}
{"text":"Six of us went here for dinner the other night. I hadn't been here in about 4 years. The restaurant seems to have changed ownership, but I cannot confirm that. The service was inconsistent and frustrating. 

Upon sitting down we waited with our menus for at least 10 minutes without any water being poured or glasses for our wine being provided. The waitress came to take our order without any water having been poured. After ordering, no bread was placed on our table. The salads then arrived at a staggered pace. First 3 people had salads, 2 minutes passed, a fourth salad appeared, another 5 minutes brought with it the remaining two salads. This is not rocket science. Coordinate the service. While eating the salad, I asked the waitress for some bread. She returned laughing saying that they had run out of bread. While I understood the meaning of her words, their placement in a comedy routine escaped me. An Italian restaurant should not run out of bread on a Sunday night at 7:50pm. If they do, they should send someone across the street to Provigo to buy more. Again, it's not rocket science. 

The main courses followed the same pattern as the salads. They were served in a staggered order leading everybody at the table into a rousing version of \"Please start eating......no that's ok...where's your food......no I insist...please start before your dish gets cold\" There must have been about 3 minutes between service of the first two dishes and the second one. The remaining 3 plates took another 2 minutes. The waitress then disappeared leaving us staring at the parmesan cheese grater on a counter nearby. I got up and took it myself to pass around our table. The waitress showed up a minute later and acted surprised that we had the cheese grater already. 

The food was ok but not spectacular. My wife ordered a tomato bocconcini salad that was basically all tomato with 5 coin sized slices of bocconcini placed on tomatoes 5 times their size. My caesar salad was passable, but for 10.95$, it was basically no more than a handful of lettuce on a plate. My pizza was quite good, but not spectacular. My wife's Gnocchi however was flawlessly executed.

I had always liked this restaurant and I hope they can improve."}
{"text":"Went here today on a whim with a friend, we were craving pasta. Boy were we not let down. 
We ordered the pasta with scallops. We got it with linguini which was perfectly cooked. The scallops were amazing.
Everything was cooked perfectly and a perfect blend of seasoning and sauce. 
I will definitely return for future pasta cravings."}
{"text":"This spot was much better than I had imagined.  It's a block away from my house yet I have never bothered to try it until now.  There were no kids the night I went...(not that I m ind kids that much), but found it a different experience than some who've reviewed.  We sat on the patio for the evening, had a great time, a great meal, it was packed.  The bill was remarkably cheap, you bring your own wine and I always forget how much alcohol adds to your total dinner bill.

I ate lobster filled pasta something or other, it was awesome, lots of sauce and I love the sauce.  I also tried a sample from the two other dishes at my table and was equally impressed.  I'll definitely be back.

Service could have been a bit faster, my water glass was empty for most of the meal.  They do not take reservations for the patio, but make a reservation anyways because if you have a reservation for inside, you go to the front of the line if you want to wait for a patio table to open up.  It seemed to annoy the people who were already in line...but c'est la vie.  We waited a whole 6 or 7 minutes for a table to free up at 7:30pm on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"Great Pizza and pasta. I recommend the Seafood Linguini. Friendly service. What's not to like?"}
{"text":"I was surprised as this was one of the best wood fire oven pizzas I've had in Montreal. I would even say it's as close as what I've had in Italy.

I highly recommend this place and I will defiantly come back here again to try the rest of their menu.

Another bonus is its bring your own wine!"}
{"text":"Restaurant that is packed with families on the weekend. It's a BYOB as they don't have a license. 

I have gone here occasionally for family dinners. it's not a favourite of mine - cramped small restaurant were you feel like you are sitting next to the patron across from you. I mean, don't think about starting up a private or sensitive conversation - 4 tables will hear you.

The food is fine, served warm and nicely presented. Personally I feel the price is on the higher side - i'm not a NDG local so maybe this is 'the place' to go that is within walking distance.

Service was great from everyone.

Service: A
Food: B"}
{"text":"NDG family restaurant packed to the brim with kids and aunts and uncles and such. The terrace out front is ground level with the street and has a very chatty neighbourhood feel. We made a reservation two days before and were seated with our chairs partially obstructing the hallway the waiters were using for taking orders out of the kitchen. The food was fine, fresh, very hot, quite tasty, not spectacular. The bathroom did not scream 'clean.' The waiter we had was amazingly prompt, attentive and friendly; and I was surprised to notice the owner of a great Montreal lunch place here having dinner with his entire family. Overall, if I lived in the area I'd probably find myself coming back, but I don't think I'd go out of my way to bring people here to eat if it was their first time in town."}
{"text":"Service is a hit or miss, as is their seafood. Fortunately its a BYOW and their pizza is delicious (real pizza oven)."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now & it's ok. One of the perks is the BYOW option. The terrasse is street level & the indoor portion of the restaurant is below street level. Decor is crisp & fine,nothing spectacular. The staff are kind but not as attentive as you would expect. Bread & butter are served as you are seated. They do offer delivery & take reservations.

The first time we went,we ordered the risotto con funghi (mushrooms) & the quattro fromagi pizza. The risotto was fantastic. Perfectly cooked & flavourful. I would order it again in the future. The pizza was equally tasty. We finished our meal with dessert but it's not worth the mention,it was meh.

The second time,we ordered the caprese salad (comes with bocconcini) & 2 pasta dishes. We originally wanted to order the antipasti app but the waiter was kind enough to smoothly let us know we should get something else because it was not good (he got a 20% tip for that!). The caprese was bland & unpalatable. We had to season it ourselves with some salt. I ordered the carbonara with linguini pasta & I enjoyed it. The bolognese tortellini was a horse of a different colour. It was way undercooked so the texture was off & unpleasant. The bolognese was ok but I wouldn't order it again.

Overall,I'll stick to the risottos & pizza & avoid the pasta."}
{"text":"Hands down the best pizza in NDG. I've tried everywhere: Atlas, Pinoli, Carvelli, Double, B&M, etc.. This is the best, hand crafted, wood oven cooked, pizza.

Either go to the place with some wine, as it's BYOW, or order delivery, pizza is excellent. Salads are great too.

Haven't tried anything else really. But this pizza is excellent and yummy.

The place itself does have a bit of a family dine feel, which we didn't expect, just a little bit, but that was fine. Server was really nice too. Will always get pizza from here from now on."}
{"text":"Al dente seems to bring a diverse range of folks, from families to dates and work parties. Word of caution: their in-restaurant menu is more expensive than what you see online! That being said they have a table d'hôte in the evenings with some pretty elaborate meals (the sea food pasta platter looked very filling, and was delicious according to my table-mate).
I opted for a pizza (brocoli, mozzarella, sun-dried tomatoes and...something else?), and...couldn't finish it. It was delicious, it was thin-crusted, it was generously coated in cheese. Nom! I got to sample the bruschetta (recommended) and their pasta. I'm not a big fan of al dente pasta, I prefer mine super cooked through, but that's on me. If you still have some room for desert, go for the cannolis!

My gripe with the place is how cramped it is. You can barely pull your chair all the way in or out, and my whole meal ended up being a choreography, since I was elbowed left and right. You dropped your fork? It's gone for ever, you can't possibly have enough space to get under there! The waiter was patient, and we were a rowdy group, bless him."}
{"text":"Food was absolutely delicious.  Service was slow, but courteous if not competely charming and professional...
The resto was very busy...A beautiful Friday night on Monkland after all. We'll be back, with wine this time!"}
{"text":"I was excited to happen upon this quaint little family restaurant and get myself a fresh wood oven pizza

Pro
- Food was quite tasty. It didn't blow my mind, but nicely satisfied a craving.
- The menu had a great selection of mix and match pasta and sauce options as well as a large variety of pizzas

Cons
- Service was far too slow. Not sure if it was because of our waitress or because they jam packed way too many tables into that place.

Comments
If I find myself in the area and it's not too packed, I may drop in again to try their pasta dishes."}
{"text":"I eat here at least once a month and I haven't been disappointed. We mostly order take out -- one pizza and one pasta -- and share among two people. I've tried most of the menu and recommend that you get out of your comfort zone and try something new. They do a great job of creating oven baked simple yet eclectic pizzas. Portions are large for two people, but probably small for three people, nevertheless, they are fast and the food is always reliable.

I've dined in restaurant with a group of friends and with family about half a dozen times. It's a nice ambiance, the restaurant smells great, and they are pretty good at accommodating picky eaters. I don't really have a bad thing to say about Al Dente Trattoria."}
{"text":"Il n'y a pas que dans la Petite Italie qu'on trouve des bons restos italiens! Al Dente est un très bon resto du NDG qui a au menu 26 sortes de pizzas, environ une vingtaine de choix de pâtes et autres mets italiens typiques. En fait, vous choisissez la sauce et le type de pâte désirés, donc le nombre total de combinaisons devient encore plus époustouflant. Les pâtes sont fraîchement faites sur place et elles sont délicieusement cuites, al dente! En plus, c'est un apportez votre vin - n'oubliez pas de passer par la SAQ avant d'y aller. L'ambiance est chaleureuse et même si les tables sont très prêt les unes des autres, une fois assis on n'a pas trop l'impression de coller les coudes. La seule raison pour l'étoile de moins est le temps que ça pris pour prendre la commande et nous donner notre facture. On a eu le temps de manger un panier de pain au complet avant de commander puis à la sortie, il a fallu qu'on demande à deux reprises pour avoir notre facture."}
{"text":"Remember to BYOB as no alcohol is available.  Although the cannoli was a bit underwhelming, I imagine few people make it to dessert as the portions are substantial.  The gnocchi with pesto was sublime... as was the penne \"al dente\" and the pizza was a great hit.  This trattoria is a keeper!  Reservations recommended as the place was packed with happy, boisterous clientele."}
