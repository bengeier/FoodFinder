{"text":"The restaurant is very good. Very good falafels. Dedicated fryer for falafels. Does not mix meat with vegetarian dishes. Flavourful food, freshly prepared. My 9 year old nephew would rate this as a 4.9 star restaurant. The consistency of hummus was perfect. Baba ganoush had a smoky eggplant flavor, good seasoning and smooth. Dolman had right amount of tartness and salt. Tabouleh salad tasted fresh and vibrant."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for several years and the food is always great. Everything I've ordered has been fresh and delicious. The service is fast and friendly too. I highly recommend this restaurant for authentic Lebanese and Middle Eastern food either for take-out or to dine in."}
{"text":"Exceptional customer service . La kabob is very clean. Food is aways fresh and made to order. The owner / chef gives each entree a touch of Lebanon that you will absolutely not get any where else. This place has become the new \"nates deli\" if your looking for authentic Lebanese/ middle eastern food. Meat eaters must try the la kabob mixed platter. Tabouli is to Die for. This place is A 1"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious food!!! The chicken shwarma, the baba, and the garlic sauce are my favorites!!  The owner is very kind and servings are more than generous.  Definitely a must-try in Strongsville."}
{"text":"Fantastic, authentic and fresh!  Stopped here on a friend's recommendation and I can't wait to go back.  I had the fatoush salad and chicken kabob wrap.  Wonderful!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here with a girlfriend. The owner was super nice, so I want to give it 5 stars, but it took a long time to get the food, and when we did it was fine but nothing memorable. I had a grilled veggie dish and a lentil soup and my friend had the sauteed green beans dish. We both agreed that we've had better.   I wouldn't be opposed to going back, as the food was okay, but it wouldn't be my first choice when I'm in the mood for Mediterranean."}
{"text":"Nothing comes close to how good La kabob is, Aladdins is like McDonald's compared to La Kabobs authenticity! I've been a regular patron here for a few years now, there isn't anything on the menu that I've tried that I haven't loved. I also have a ton of food allergies & this place is a total haven for me."}
{"text":"Last night was my 2nd visit this month to this mecca of gastronomic delight. Thanks to the fine folks here on Yelp, I had to try it out and I'm a fan for life.  On my first visit I had the shish kabob and that hooked me.  It was delicious.  On my 2nd visit, last night, I had the chicken shawarma platter and my buddy had the beef version.  Everything is cooked to perfection and absolutely superb.  The owner/chef is an absolute sweetheart of a gentleman, and a treasure.  Everything is very clean and neat, and pleasantly quiet!  Having a table conversation is effortless.  AND, great wi-fi!  :)  go there, and eat!"}
{"text":"I'm not so well versed in Lebanese cuisine, so we were just looking for a nice place with lighter fare, and decided to check out La Kabob based on other reviews.  Needless to say, we were really impressed!  We tried the La Kabob platter, which will likely feed us for the next couple of days.  Everything was absolutely delicious!  We'll definitely be frequent customers from here on out. :D"}
{"text":"Stopped here for the first time for lunch today. The food is very fresh and tasty. The owner is friendly and attentive. We ordered the vegetarian platter everything was homemade very good. I ordered the Mjaddra wrap never had this before it had fresh lentils and rice with cucumber it was good. My friend ordered the beef kabob platter she really enjoyed it said the beef was cooked perfectly but wished there was more beef to the platter. She also got fries instead of rice for extra charge, the fries were very good. We ordered the homemade Baklava yummy!! Very nice experience, highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great food, all made fresh daily.  Especially love the garlic hummus!  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Great place, with friendly service, and tasty food. No need to say more, other than try it."}
{"text":"I love La Kabob! I've been coming here for over a year as it's quite close to where I live. I get the Mediterranean salad (with gyro meat) and always get garlic labneh, a greek yogurt/garlicky dip sprinkled with za'atar served with pita. Hummus is delicious, and the La Kabob platter has an amazing rice pilaf.   -Owner Tony and his daughter are adorable! They are very personable and will chat with you while cooking. -Interior (and bathrooms) are extremely clean, virtually spotless.  -Portions are great for the price; you leave satisfied, not stuffed. -Has always had plenty of other customers inside while I'm there.  Some qualms: -pita is not very fresh. -ordering process is kind of strange (order - they bring food out to your table - you pay after eating).  Overall, I love that La Kabob is a local business. Tony cares about his customers and really serves amazing, home cooked food."}
{"text":"My husband and I were looking for a nice date place that was casual, under $10/entree and NOT American/European cuisine. We found the perfect place! After eating at La Kabob, we've decided we're definitely going back. We often visit Middle Eastern restaurants and ask for Turkish coffee because many times that is a sign to us of how authentic the restaurant (and not as Americanized) is. This place served Turkish coffee and it was good quality too. We liked the casual setting of the restaurant, with Arabic music playing in the background, the friendly and expedient service and the cleanliness factor. The quality and taste of all three dishes ordered was phenomenal considering how quickly they were served. Good quality food+ time efficiency = Points in our book. Their baklava was also a perfect pairing for the Turkish coffee. While we were sipping our coffee, the owner also had coffee with one of his friends and patrons. We always like seeing a restaurant owner enjoying his business and clientele. Relaxing environment, quiet and perfect for conversation.  Their menu is online at http://www.lakabobgrill.com.  We ordered:  Garlic Labneh, Kafta Kabob Plate Entree, Grape Leaves + Hummus Wrap, Turkish Coffee, Baklava"}
{"text":"Real, authentic Lebanese food. Absolutely delicious. We just moved to Cleveland a couple of months ago and finally found the perfect place for delicious and authentic Lebanese home style food. I highly recommend the Beef Shawarma and the Chicken Shawarma. The Gyro was delicious as well. Hummus was homemade and fresh, not from a can. The owners greeted us warmly and made us feel welcomed. Definitely going back!!"}
{"text":"It's hard to imagine Lebanese cuisine better than La Kabob's take on it.  Being a big fan of Aladdin's for a while I thought that was as good as it got, boy was I wrong.  I don't know if it's ingredients or the preparation, or just Tony's (owner) magic touch but every item tasted better than ever before when I tried it here.  This place is definitely going on my gems list when it comes to Lebanese or any food for that fact."}
{"text":"Thanks Goodness a place like this opened!!! real middle eastern food finally. I grew up overseas and have yet to find a authentic place to eat untill todayyyyyyyyyyy!!!!! Christmas came early. and AWesom service. family run and operated."}
{"text":"Compares to.other middle eastern places im giving it 3 stars. I travel alot and the best places are in texas, and Chicago.  However, in the cleveland area, there are limited options so this might be all we got. The meal i got was chicken shawrma with soggy fries."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I have been coming here for the past 1.5 years or so and I have yet to have a bad dish. The guy who owns it is incredibly nice as well.  If you enjoy coffee make sure to ask for a Turkish coffee!"}
{"text":"I had really great expectations for this place, but unfortunately, it just doesn't meet them. The shawarma, gyro meat, and chicken varieties of the same are all dry and not particularly tasty. The zatar fries aren't very well seasoned. Overall, in one word, this place is incredibly bland, which is an incredible shame. I refused to believe this and really wished that this place were better, but after a couple disappointing experiences, I'm giving up.  Service is also not particularly fast, and it takes quite a while to get all of your food. I'd recommend calling ahead if you wanted to try it."}
{"text":"I've been eating here for more than a year now, and it has NEVER failed me. It is the best Mediterranean/Middle Eastern place around.  The closest comparison is Aladin's. I like Aladin's, I eat at Aladin's. La Kabob  is better than Aladin's."}
{"text":"First off, i called to place an order for pick up. I came in to pick the order up and everything was fine. I pay with my debit/credit card and I'm on my way. I get home and my card was charged $4 more than what I signed and agreed to on my receipt. There was a tip line on the receipt.  I'm guessing the employee wrote in a tip. I'm dealing with that in the morning with the cops.  The falafel was terrible. I've had better falafel at a fair, carnival and even The parking lot of a phish show. The hummus was the worst I've ever had. The spinach pie was good, but not $3 good. It was fairly small.  I absolutely love mediterranian/ lebonese food. So I'm no stranger to it.  I asked for the tahini and got none. The falafel was so dry and crumbly.  The hummus looked like potato soup. It was salty and had little flavor.  The grape leaves were ok. They lack feta cheese.  I will not return here except to settle the money that was stolen from me.  There are 3 alladins around. They are pricey, but we'll worth the quality compared to here. Downtown Cleveland also has a few great mediterranian spots.  Sittoos in parma has it right.  If you want fallafel and hummus and spinach pie, go to Sittoos.  And the prices there are very very fair for the amazing taste and quality. Avoid at all costs. Save your money. Worst $20 I have ever spent in my life."}
{"text":"I'm just wondering why I waited so long to try this place! I got a falafel wrap and the Mediterranean salad (so I could have it for lunch the next day). Everything was delicious and tasted fresh (even my next-day salad!). And you can't beat the price. I'll definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"I was recently introduced to this Lebanese Restaurant through a recommendation by a friend. What a treat it was! The meals I've tried so far were delicious and I was told it is all prepared and cooked in house. Try the Kebob player, you wont regret it. Been back since and will go again with some friends next time."}
{"text":"My family and I did not love this place.  If you really want some good Mediterranean food go to Alladin's instead.  The quality of the food can't be compared."}
{"text":"Truly one of Strongsville's hidden gems! I kept driving by this place and finally had an opportunity to go inside! We had a beef shawarma plate and a la kabob plate. The meats were very well marinated and extremely tasty. You can taste the spices. Another plus, their items are very reasonably priced. Finally, the place provides WiFi!   Overall, I'm very pleased and look forward to next time!"}
{"text":"We eat from here weekly.   Always delicious, always quality and always friendly!  The rice, the garlic sauce and the chicken are our favorites."}
{"text":"Great, fresh, made to order, authentic Lebanese food. Lebanese wine and beer complements the menu for a complete experience. Even something for the kids. Try it once, you will definitely come back for more."}
{"text":"My husband and I love la kebob! Great food, great service and great people running it. Love our chicken kebob with the delicious garlic sauce ! Could use a little more chicken though..last time we went it seemed less and less. Leaves you feeling nice and light so you know it's clean food!"}
{"text":"Great food and service from a friendly and welcoming family.  The  was fresh and well spiced."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and the service absolutely fantastic! Everything made from scratch, perfectly seasoned and cooked. Very accommodating on special requests and accommodations. A+ hospitality! Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Easy to get to and delicious food!  A friend and I love middle eastern food and we were not disappointed.  The staff and owner were available and made us welcome - very friendly!"}
{"text":"Dropped in for dinner because of the higher than average reviews than other restaurants in the vicinity while visiting from out of town.   Service: excellent...attentive, friendly, and repeatedly asked how each course was.   Food: above average...considering that most pita wraps are under $6 and most entrees are under $9, I'm not complaining, but I will say it didn't exceed my expectations. (However, we have several great Lebanese restaurants in Raleigh so maybe I'm spoiled.) I ordered the gyro platter and baklava for dessert.   Overall: a great place to drop by for a quick meal with great service. I would imagine if you were not pleased with something, the staff would be glad to make it right or provide something else on the menu."}
{"text":"don't ask me why but for some reason I find Greeks uglier brother my fall back when I can't find asian or Greek. I stumble into these little places hoping for the best and at 2:30 when you've eaten nothing ALL day and you're cold calling auto dealers...almost anything hits the spot. this did better than just hit some spot! And when pleasantly surprised it has to be told. This title place near the end of a strip center did just that. The food was good, the rating is for the small portion size. The owner is a VERY nice man and his food is great. He may want to increase the size of the chicken kabobs in the future. Great tomato salad too, the parsley really added to it. Saying all of this I would go back when in the area."}
{"text":"Fantastic affordable ethnic food! I can't say enough about the place. I go here all the time. After moving back from Seattle in 2013, I really missed having access to great food from around the world, until I found La Kabob!"}
{"text":"Was there last night with the wife and kids. Friendly, inviting place. Nice decor. The owner Tony is very friendly and obviously takes a lot of pride in his work. and the quality of his ingredients. Everything is made painstakingly and the labor of love is evident. The prices are very reasonable.  I have eaten better Lebanese, but not in the US. The Kibbeh balls were excellent and his rice pilaf is the best in Cleveland. The Kebabs were tender, moist and flavorful.  The service is on the slower side, but that's because a majority of the cooking process starts after you place the order. But the pay off for the wait is in the flavor and freshness of the food.   I'll definitely be going again. I love the fact that the owner takes pride in the food that he serves."}
{"text":"Delicious food! Love the hummus, hope you like garlic ;). The owner is super friendly and welcoming. Portions are perfect and at a good price. The kabobs were kicking! Definitely a nice new spot in the area."}
{"text":"Nice little place, with lots of reasons to go. Laid back, friendly, clean, easy to get to, convenient parking, open on Sunday. Kind of like a sit-down deli -- you order at the counter, they bring food to your table. Nicely priced so you can try a number of different things without spending way more than intended. Fresh, simple, tasty Leb-Med items, pretty much all your faves. Overheard owner talking with some customers -- guess they've been here for 6 years, so that's a good sign. Try it!"}
{"text":"Just finished the chicken kabob wrap and some \"actually home made\" stuffed grape leaves for lunch! Delicious! Friendly and clean atmosphere. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Hands down my daughters favorite restaurant and my husband and I don't mind! Delicious, authentic food made with love and served every time with a smile! We eat there at least 1-2 times a week!"}
{"text":"For the price.. YUMMY!!!!  Loved it!! Do try the shawarma, I tried a bit of the veggie platter, I guess it was not meant for me..  But my aunt LOVED IT!  Guess we all have different palates!!"}
{"text":"Love this place!   My go to sandwich is the falafel wrap....my meatatarians  get the chicken swarma. ....yum.   Very friendly,local restaurant,clean, and convenient!   Highly recommend."}
{"text":"\"Fast food\" Mediterranean / Lebanese in a tiny strip mall?  Yep!...and it's quite tasty!!!  This spot was an old Quiznos when we first moved here to Strongsville, and it has been several other places in the meantime.  Recently, this places was taken over and converted into the current spot and I'm sorry it has taken me this long to give it a try.  All of the \"classic\" dishes you'd think of, they have...stuffed grape leaves, delicious salad, kabob plates, mixed plates, gyro sandwiches, hummus and pita, etc.  We came for lunch and left very satisfied...both in the stomach and the wallet.  We will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"A great price for a healthy lunch and the owner is very friendly and cares about his customers opinions."}
{"text":"I placed a carryout order today for lunch, and I was certainly not let down.  Everything is fresh and flavorful.  I ordered the Stuffed Grape Leaves and Garlic Hummus, and my coworkers got Gyros (1 was chicken).  They were also both VERY impressed as well.  I can't wait to place my next order to try more menu items.  What a great experience!"}
{"text":"I wish we could give it more stars because the staff was so sweet and attentive. The food was \"alright\". The chicken shwarma was the best out of the orders we had and if I would recommend it to whomever comes to eat here.  We just found it to be overall a pleasant location but mediocre in comparison to other Lebanese restaurants we have eaten at."}
{"text":"Simple homely ambience, friendly Lebanese hospitality and of course the food was not just good, it was heavenly! Had Kibbi and Chicken kababs with rice and onions. Delicious. A must for anyone visiting the area. Will be back here soon. The Lebanese Pilsner, Almaza, was also great. Oh and I should not forget, very very friendly and courteous owners. Amazing experience indeed."}
{"text":"La Kabob has surely turned into one of my favorite restaurants after just a few visits. The food is fresh, consistent, and absolutely delicious! The service is also impeccable, they treat you as if you are guests in their home and you are always greeted with a warm smile. I would definitely suggest stopping in here for an authentic and healthy substitute before pulling into the next chain restaurant."}
{"text":"upon first impression i would not have given La Kabob a good review. we walked in after 3pm on a Sunday and the place was a disaster. there were dishes all over the tables. nothing had been cleaned in a while and you could tell.  sadly, there was one person there - the poor guy was all by himself and he just hadn't had a chance to clean up. eventually another customer actually helped him clean up (very nice of him).  i really liked the food. Danielle got  a chicken shwarma wrap. she liked it but eventually tore it open and picked through the fillings to remove the onions and pickles. i got the small version of the La Kebob platter. the falafel was a little overcooked for my liking but still tasted great. i didn't love the chicken kabob but the kafta kabob and the beef kabob were really good. the rice pilaf was delicious but very oily. the hummus here is incredible and i wish i had more of it right now. do yourself a favor and check this place out. you'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"Really like schwarma here. I did not like the original hummus which is important for this style of restaurant so losing a star only for that reason will try garlic next time"}
{"text":"This place has decent food.  I think it's comparable to Aladdin's, but their meat is much juicier than Aladdin's.  One thing that turned me off is that the pita bread weren't warmed up and was given in plastic bags though I was eating inside.  Also, I felt like a lot of the food had a little too sour of a taste from lemon or lime.  Overall, if I were in the area and had Aladdin's too much, I'd come here."}
{"text":"Dropped by yesterday with my wife and daughter around 2 PM.  The restaurant was quiet but tastefully decorated and the owner was very friendly.  We got the kabob platter, some baba, a green bean appetizer dish and grape leaf rolls.  Everything was delicious.  I especially liked the rice, the perfectly seasoned and cooked meat, the baba and the leaf rolls.  My wife and I go to Aladdins a lot and for my money, this place was better.  Critiques?  I think that I like the Aladdins humus better.  Other than that, I can't think of anything.  Food is delicious, the owner seems like a great guy and enjoys doing what he's doing and its locally owned.  Now I just wish they had a branch in Broadview Heights!"}
{"text":"We had dinner at La Kabob. It was delicious and freshly prepared. The loubie was the best I've had. The 2 gentlemen who run it were very friendly."}
{"text":"A friend posted a positive review in fb and I really trust her opinion. She was right! This place is great!  Loved the lunch! Had shawarma and the chicken gyro and split and order of heavenly fries! When you can get delicious authentic food at a decent price why would anyone do fast food!  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Great food and nice music! We had the kafta, shwarma, falafel, and grape leaves. Everything was great. The owner is very friendly. I would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"There's a reason why this is one of the top rated restaurants in Strongsville.  Great food and a friendly owner who loves his work!  I'll be back with my family!"}
{"text":"The food here is decent, though I wouldn't call it the best Mediterranean I've had. The Lebanese salad is really refreshing, so that was a high point. The falafel was on the dry side and didn't have great flavor. My kofta kabob was just ok. They were weirdly stingy with the water glasses, as four of us were eating and they gave us two glasses. We asked for two more and got one. Strange. Every surface I touched felt sticky (tables, bathroom door and handle, chairs), so it didn't feel like the cleanest place. Not my fave place."}
{"text":"My wife and I eat here fairly often. The kabobs, hummus, and rice are actually really good. We usually split the La Kabob Platter which is enough for two. I usually get extra pitas and place a little bit of everything in it and top it with the garlic sauce (delicious!).   Only draw back is the felafel is almost always a bit too dry and I sometimes get tomatoes in my order even though I've mentioned I have an intolerance, to which they gladly redo my order.    Overall, I would recommend this to anyone looking for good Lebanese food for a decent price."}
{"text":"Excellent food and friendly service! Wonderful flavorful food and fast service. Just a very short detour off the Ohio Turnpike. Stopped there on our way back to Chicago from New York. Will definitely stop there again on our way to the East Coast!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing!! Gosh I recommend ANYTHING! Everything made fresh. Even taboulee is prepared fresh to order! Chicken or beef shawarma is to die for. My absolute favorite though has to be the falafel and tahini sauce. Such a nice family running it too! Very authentic and yummy."}
{"text":"My first visit was last night with a group of 8. The restaurant is super clean and the staff was courteous. The food was amazing! Several people had the Vegetarian Platter, which looked delicious with generous portions. I had the Chicken Salad, to which I added feta and falafel, and it was fresh, tasty, and extremely satisfying. The chicken was well seasoned and very flavorful.  The falafel really blew me away. It was so fresh and herbaceous. The owner stopped by our table to say hello and make sure we were happy. He explained that he uses a separate fryer for the falafel, and I could really taste the difference that made. We had a lovely time and I'm already looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"Solid place. Very well run.  Food spicy and good.  Chicken pita was flavorful.  Service a hair slow but not too bad.   We stopped in on a whim (we were stuck at a basketball tournament at the nearby high school) and were pleasantly surprised.    Not my kind of food.  But it was decent. Owner seemed nice. Place was clean.  Give it a try."}
{"text":"The best tabouli, falafel, gyros, hummous, kebabs, outside of Lebanon. Even the Lebanese beer was delicious. I highly recommend! Took the parents (who had never had Lebanese food before) and they loved it too! Can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I love La Kabob and now our 8 month old does too. He tried some chicken from our chicken shawarma wraps and then some rice and he could not get enough. We have been coming here for years and the food is always excellent. The owner is very friendly and always makes you feel right at home. I highly recommend starting with the grape leaves. They are IMHO the best around. They have the perfect amount of olive oil to lemon flavor ratio. I also recommend the chicken shawarma wrap or platter. The chicken is always tender and the tahini is dare I say it...out of bounds! So happy we brought the little guy in today. Made some good memories."}
{"text":"Owner is super nice and food was good!  I hate to say it, but, the hummus is not the best I've had. We were served our lunch quickly and would probably go back"}
{"text":"My mother and I went there a few weeks ago and while my food was good, my mom's food was not so much. My mom ordered a salad and wanted chicken instead of Gyro meat - the man cooking kept saying it was chicken. My stated he was very rude to her and while he did offer her something else- she asked him nicely if he didn't mind giving her money back. He said he did mind because he made what she ordered and he proceeded to get very nasty with my mother. Mistakes happen and why I think this is a great business- having an attitude like that towards a customer will not want people to return.   The man did give my mom money back but showed how annoyed he was. My question is it really that big of a deal over $6.00 dollars to have someone ( being my mom) never want to come back because of the way she was treated."}
{"text":"This is our first check in but not our first time eating here. Whenever we are down in Strongsville the pull to La Kebab is strong! We have never had a bad meal here and their Rice Pilaf is the best! Everything is made to order. There doesn't appear to be any warming trays or premade items. Everything looks fresh. Tastes amazing. When in town, check them out. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This place is wonderful.  They have a nice selection of items.  We had a combo plate for two and there was plenty.  The staff is friendly.  This is not full waiter service.  You order at the counter but they bring your dishes to the table.  It is in a plaza that you may miss.  It is just south of 82 on Pearl on the right.  ."}
{"text":"Can only speak to the food as take out. The kafta platter is excellent and a good price. Served with a smile too for the bonus."}
{"text":"In town from Cincinnati and thought we would try something local. Picked up 4 appetizers and they were all wonderful. Gallic Hummus was our favorite. Chicken Shwarma had incredible flavor. Everything was made fresh, no microwaves or freezers. We will be back."}
{"text":"Service was superb, it was a slow Saturday afternoon and there was only one worker there, an older gentleman. My wife, my son and I stopped in to grab a snack and my son needed a diaper change and a bottle.  No diaper changing station in either the men's nor woman's restrooms.  Ambiance was appropriate and ample seating area, nice music, food was fantastic.  Main area is modern and nice but the restrooms needs modernization and diaper changing station to earn my 5th star."}
{"text":"Rumor has it that I may have eaten here twice in one day.  Rumor also has it that I am eating some right now as I write this review.  Damn these rumors!"}
{"text":"Very fresh and delicious food. Can take a little time to get your food from the moment you order so it's usually best to call ahead. Portions are not too big yet not too small."}
{"text":"We happened upon this place 10 till close after our initial dinner plans didn't pan out while passing through.  We suggested getting food to go in an attempt to inconvenience what turned out to be the owner as little as possible.  Not only were we encouraged to eat there but we received fresh made delicious food and fantastic service, all with a smile and conversation.  The tabouli was fantastic!  This is def a place you should check out if you like Mediterranean or would like to try it for the first time."}
{"text":"Great family owned local restaurant. I'm upset with myself that it took me this long to try this place out. Had the Gyro Platter, the gyro lamb meat was the best I've ever had. The cucumber sauce that it came with complimented it very well. The Falafel was phenomenal. And the hummus definitely did not disappoint! Also, the service was great! If you live in Strongsville or nearby, you must make this place one of your go-to lunch/dinner spots!"}
{"text":"Got in before lunch rush, tho wasnt really one. Had med salad...good size with ample toppings but hardly any dressing. Had some med pizza...this was really good. The fries that had the seasoning on them were really good, otherwise just average.  Prices were fair.  Im afraid that if they were much busier, service would have been too slow, but for us it was ok...I should have left some of the onions on the plate-in dire need of a mint:)"}
{"text":"Loved La Kabob! Garlic hummus was excellent, everything we ate was fresh, delicious and authentic.  The staff was warm, friendly and checked in on us several times, they are very passionate about good food and good service.   I also noticed the whole place, the food prep area and kitchen were all spotless! We'll definitely be regulars!"}
{"text":"The chicken was tender and full of flavor.  Not a big Mediterranean food person but if you like this kind of food you will probably like this place."}
{"text":"I really love this place. The food is always fresh they really do go the extra mile to make sure their customers are satisfied. My favorite is the fattoush salad with chicken. My wife always gets the chicken kabob wrap which is also very good. The service is always friendly and consistent. I recommend this place to all my friends. I'm very happy to have a place that serves this type of cuisine so close to my home"}
{"text":"The food here was wonderful!  The grape leaves the best I've ever had. I would say this is like the cafe version of Aladins minus the elaborate desserts, but they have much better food and better prices.   If you want some strong (not starbucks like) good coffee, try a pot. I'd never had Turkish coffee before.  It kind of reminded me of mixing coffee beans with cocoa beans and making a stew of it.  And it did not irritate my stomach.    I only wish I was a little closer to this place... I think I could eat here every day!"}
{"text":"Being a middle easterner myself I was a bit skeptical about the reviews this place was getting. Went to it, tried it out, and loved it. The food was delicious, good portion, and great service. The place is family run and they are very friendly with the customers. Definitely worth a try if you want some solid kabobs for lunch."}
{"text":"I stopped here for dinner while on a road trip after reading the Yelp reviews.   This is the best Mediterranean food I have had in some time. I shared the kebob platter which was plenty for 2 people. It included hummus, falafel, rice pilaf and 3 grills - chicken, ground beef and steak. The meats were tender, flavorful, and cooked perfectly. The hummus was creamy and homemade. Even the rice was noteworthy, fluffy and delicious. Despite all the wonderful food, one of my favorite parts of the meal was the garlic butter. I put it on EVERYTHING and it just made it all the better.   If I find myself in the area, I'll certainly stop by again."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch and talked to the owner. Everything is made in house by family members. Food was really fantastic!  Gyro plate hit the spot!"}
{"text":"Visited La Kabob today for the first time.  Casual grill with healthy flavorful menu items.  Shared a lubieh bezait, la kabob platter small, and a veggie kabob wrap, and glass of Ksara blanc de blanc wine, a very generous pour.  Everything was great.  The owner was preparing the food and it was made to order.   This is my second visit to La Kabob. This time I brought my brother in law and sister in law. They are in the food industry and were immediately impressed by the cleanliness of everything. All  four of us enjoyed everything we ordered along with a bottle of Ksara blanc de blanc. We had the gyro, kabob platter, chicken kabob platter, lubieh bezait, and then shared some baklava and Lebanese lady fingers.  We'll return for sure.  Mandy and Tony have created a warm welcoming atmosphere along with delicious food."}
{"text":"Simple interior gives way to delicious food. The lamb was well marinated and the side salad very fresh and delicious. The tahini sauce was just a little bitter how it should be. You can't beat the price, come on over you won't be disappointed. I got the beef shawarma platter with a side salad. I also tried some of the rice pilaf which was great and has a nice grilled onion flavor."}
{"text":"Nice family owned, owner run self service styled Lebanese cuisine with an emphasis on quality and service.  On a Saturday night around 8:30pm surprisingly without a wait we were provided quality service and freshly prepared food.  Very nice vegetarian option especially the falafel wrap and the yummy 'Mjaddra' a must have.  The chicken kabob wrap and the chicken shwarma wrap were juicy and very tasty.  I am sure they must be getting a lot of take out order but dishearteningly the restaurant wasn't that busy.  There is no hype to this place unlike an Aladdin, the food speaks for itself .  Give it a try and am sure you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Really good, healthy, flavorful food without a lot of grease.  I don't live in the area, but I know I will stop here next time I'm close by.  If you like really greasy food, this may not be the place for you - If you like healthy food with good seasoning, you will love this place."}
{"text":"The first thing you notice when you walk in is the decor, which looked welcoming and calming. The owners are extremely nice and enjoy talking to their patrons. The food was delicious and tasty. The hummus appetizer has a fair amount of hummus and pita. I ordered the beef shawarma platter and the meat was well seasoned and was plentiful. My wife ordered the chicken pita pizza and it was very good. My son got the meat pie and said it was unbelievably good. Whenever we are back in town we will be visiting here again."}
{"text":"Very tasty, very solid food. Stopped in on a Sunday mid afternoon and were the only ones in there and that turned out to be to our benefit. We ordered hummus with pita as an appetizer and it was made to perfection. As main dishes we ordered the gyro platter and the beef kabobs both with rice pilaf. The gyro platter came with sliced onions, tomatoes, lettuce, delicious rice pilaf and probably the best lamb and beef I've eaten in a long time and the cucumber dressing was addicting. The beef kabobs were grilled and tasty, but a little chewy, and placed atop that same rice pilaf along with tomatoes and a side of that same awesome hummus. We were waited on by Tony, the owner, who was extremely friendly and accommodating  and made the dining experience most enjoyable. If you have been considering eating here, try it. We did and we will return."}
{"text":"La Kabob has firmly taken a hold of my weakness for lebanese food, and now Aladdin's just doesn't cut it for me.  Don't get me wrong, other lebanese places, I'm sure, are good.  La Kabob has something great going for it.  IMHO, this family operated restaurant offers up food that's prepared with care and always only after your order.  After your order at the counter,  the food is brought to you.  The menu ranges from Salads, to Pita Wraps, to Pita Pizza, to Plates.  The usual offerings of Falafel, Hummus, Baba Ganouj, Kabobs of variety.  Check out the menu on their site.  What sets La Kabob apart and ahead of other such eateries is the freshness of their kabobs that come out steaming bursting with mouthwatering flavor, freshly cooked atop Rice Pilaf.  I could eat two pounds of their Rice Pilaf - this is no out of a bag microwave kind pilaf - their pilaf is clearly made on-premise and contains freshly cooked rice with vermicelli mixed in.  This steamy and fluffy concoction is definitely not be missed, that is you are fan of rice pilaf.  Even if you are not, indulge to taste what you have been missing.   Don't miss the Hummus with extra pita.  They serve up a great recipe of this favorite dish.    The ambiance is definitely that of casual atmosphere and pair that with great tasting food is recipe of great times and good eats."}
{"text":"This is by far the best Lebanese food I've had within the US.  This is a family owned and operated business that very much deserves your support and patronage.  The owner is so very polite and accommodating to no end.  His daughter is quite pleasant and very friendly.    My go to's are the beef shawarma wrap and kibbie.  Omg!! The best I've had in the states, hands down.  Everything is so fresh, vibrant, and flavorful.  I have yet to have anything here I wouldn't recommend.   Stop by and enjoy the wonderful flavors, the only regret you'd have is not coming here sooner."}
{"text":"Great spot for Mediterranean. Wonderful service by the chef owner.  Casual spot...nothing fancy, but great food. Had the hummus, the falafel, chicken kabob, and tabulie salad.  All great.     Try a Turkish coffee!!!"}
{"text":"The tabouli was delicious - tons of parsley, light on bulgur, wonderful flavor.  I also loved the grape leaves, baba ghannouj, and thin lebanese style bread.  A really excellent lunch!"}
{"text":"I am on a quest for fresh food that is made with care and fresh whole ingredients. This place is absolutely wonderful. The owner and his daughter served us a delicious lunch. The homemade sauces and dishes are a delight. The restaurant is clean and bright.   A new favorite place where I will be sure to take my friends."}
{"text":"The first leg of our recent trip to the East Coast landed us in the Cleveland area. Because my traveling companion's maternal grandparents were Lebanese we were on the lookout for Lebanese restaurants (which are pretty much non-existent where we live in Wisconsin). La Kabob was just a ten minute drive from our hotel so we had to try it. (BTW - on our return from the east coast we stayed at the same hotel -- so guess what? -- we ate at La Kabob again!)  La Kabob is a \"mom & pop\" operation located in a small strip mall in Strongsville. You can eat in (which we did) though it seems like much of their business is take-out. The menu coves a lot of territory but you can order just about everything you might find in Lebanon or the surrounding region. Lebanese beer (which is a bit bland but way better than any major brand domestic beer in the USA) and Lebanese wine (by the bottle or glass) are available to complement your meal. You can also select a standard fountain drink, coffee, tea, water, or (only if you dine in) Turkish coffee as your beverage.  I am not an expert in Lebanese food though I have cooked and eaten many mediterranean dishes that are quite similar. I thoroughly enjoyed the kafta kabob platter on my first visit and the beef shawarma platter on my second visit. Each platter was served with rice pilaf and an assortment of sides and garnishes including something I never tasted before -- pickled turnips. The turnips were an outstanding touch. I plan to search out a recipe and make my own!   But -- and here is the most important part of my review -- my friend, who fondly remembers his grandmother's Lebanese cooking, loved the food. Maybe it wasn't quite up to grandma's standards, but for him the food was authentic and it captured all the tastes and textures he remembers from years ago. As I recall, his favorites on our first visit were the stuffed grape leaves and garlic labneh. He ordered them again on our second visit!  I generally give restaurants like La Kabob three stars, but considering my traveling companion's Lebanese heritage and how much he enjoyed the food -- four stars -- \"Yay! I'm a fan\"!"}
{"text":"Another disappointing place that I would love to like because it's a six minute walk from my home.  I would never eat inside here because of the uncomfortable seating and the blaring Lebanese (I assume) music.  It's bad enough sitting there for a half hour with no other customers while the staff prepares your food with absolutely no sense of urgency.  When I got home the meals were neither warm nor fresh.  My wife wouldn't touch her gyro platter, my small La Kabob platter was completely bland and uninteresting.  While the prices are moderate the portions are small."}
{"text":"I'm pretty sad to write this review because I have had La Kabob bookmarked for a long time and I finally got a chance to try it.  The food was so terrible that I would not return.   I ordered the sampler plate for 1. It came with chicken and beef kabob, and kofta. The kofta was tough but oily, the beef kabob was undercooked (almost raw in the middle), and the chicken was over cooked.  I subbed salad for the rice which cost an extra $1.45, no big deal, but the tomatoes were not fresh.  My husband had rice with his dish and said it was hard.  The worst part though was the hummus. It had no flavor but a tingly sensation which makes me think it was spoiled. I could only eat a few bites of that.  We left very disappointed. I am just so surprised! Anyone who knows me knows that Lebanese is my absolute favorite food!"}
{"text":"Awesome food at an awesome price. Establishment is well maintained.  Plenty of indoor seating. Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"I love the food, it is made fresh and tastes delicious.   The owner is always there and always has a smile on his face. Great customer service too. That is half of the reason why I continue to come back.   Ambiance is great, music is middle eastern so gives it an authentic feel.   I come here for lunch with coworkers periodically and is my go-to."}
{"text":"Very good food made fresh when ordered. I love everything about La Kabob. You can't do better than this place."}
{"text":"This place is so good!! Mom & Pop...they're both always here when I come, he's cooking out front and she's prepping in the back.  I love the vegetarian platter (hummus, falafel, pita, tabbouli, baba, grape leaves).  Everything is always so fresh and yummy!"}
{"text":"Delicious Lebanese food, family run, open everyday for long hours... What's not to love?   Their hummus and baba are perfect appetizers, freshly made and  plentiful enough to share. The tabouli is flavorful enough for me to eat it for lunch or dinner with nothing else.   I'm still working my way through the menu one takeout order at a time. The shish tawook (chicken kabob) is good, but not up to old standards like Nate's. Obviously it depends on how aggressively garlicky you want your chicken.  Don't forget to ask for a side of their hot sauce. Very delicious and a fine complement to the baba or hummus.   I can't comment on in-house service as I have taken food out each visit, but the place is clean, there's ample parking and staff has been polite and friendly. I usually go to Aladdin's or Mezza for this cuisine, but close proximity makes La Kabob my new go-to place and a fine addition to the already good selection of middle eastern food in the area."}
{"text":"Very average Lebanese food.  Nothing special to claim here......  the food was just average and our order of grapes was lost in translation....I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"3.5-stars. It's good. Go for carryout though. Not much to see as a sit-down restaurant. Like so many of these little \"ethnic\" places; a little paint and fabric would go a long way to warm it up.   The food is good with all the standard Lebanese flavors you would expect from Tabbouli to Falafel, and Kabob to Shawarma and everything in between. Definitely worth stopping in for."}
{"text":"Had the pleasure to meet the Father & Daughter duo running this fine establishment. The food was delicious, prices were very affordable, the speed was fast and the two were very friendly. If you haven't stopped here, please do to support a family run business."}
{"text":"I was driving through town on a long trip and found this place on Yelp. My wife and I went and got the beef shawarma and kefta platters. Both were delicious. I usually don't notice rice, but I was blown away by the rice pilaf. Perfect moisture/texture and great flavor that complimented the shawarma quite nicely. The place is family owned/operated and the owner/chef is very friendly. He said that they cook everything including the rice, to order. They don't own a microwave. As a result, it does take about 20-30 minutes to get food, so make sure you're not in a rush. The price was also very reasonable ($8-$10 for an entree). I'll definitely try to return on my next drive through OH."}
{"text":"The food was great. I got the veggie soup and a veggie wrap, and both were excellent. The food took longer to prepare, but it was worth the wait. I compare all Mediterranean food in Cleveland to Aladdins, and I would say this is the fast casual equivalent of Aladdins. It would be GREAT, though, if they would offer a combo type meal. Think Panera's Pick 2 menu. I ended up ordering a bowl of veggie soup and a wrap, but took half the wrap home since it was just too much for lunch. It would have been nice to be able to get a smaller size soup and half a wrap to make a lunch size.  However, there was this one thing...So the restaurant is set up with a certain type of flow that we are all familiar with these days. You order in one spot, then slide down along the counter to the register and pay. Then you sit down and enjoy your food. For some reason, even as the restaurant is set up with this kind of flow, the guy behind the counter told us to pay AFTER we ate. So we detached from the counter and sat down and waited and there was a girl behind the counter who brought us our food. After the meal, we weren't sure if we were supposed to bus our own table or not, and we heard the ladies at the table next to us whispering to each other trying to figure out the same thing. So we bussed our table and then went to the counter to pay, and had to scratch our heads and wonder, are we supposed to tip the young girl that brought us our food? (We did tip her).  I think next time we will order it to go. It really is good food for lunch, but the prep time and the confusing eat-in experience is a deterrent."}
{"text":"Always good, fresh food that is worth the little extra wait! Friendly service whether you are dining in or picking up."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to get clean, fresh, healthy food. I didn't know what to expect or if I even liked Lebanese food. I am now a fan. I eat there regularly and the chicken shwarma wrap is one of my favs. The staff are friendly and the prices are fair."}
{"text":"Delicious and very fresh ingredients. The Fatoosh and the Kebab platters were fantastic. Everything was perfectly seasoned and delicious. Great place! Put it on your list :)"}
{"text":"AAAHHHHMAAAHHHZING. just really good. dont pass this one up.  and say hi to the family when you are there because they are super sweet and provide some awesome quality service. You wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"Will come back many times! Everything made from scratch to order and so yummy! Hummus was awesome and so was beef shawarma!"}
{"text":"The food here is really fresh, and they have every type of Mediterranean food you can think of. It is all homemade. It takes a little longer to get your food, but it's worth it. The owner makes it right in front of you right after you order it. Also seemed very clean."}
{"text":"Food was wonderful. I wife had the falafel wrap and I had the Kafka kabob plater. Very tasty. Everything was very fresh, and did not taste like it had ever touched a freezer. Owner took our order and served us. A very nice and charming man.  Pricing was very affordable and food portions were plentiful. Restaurant was very clean. My wife is very picky and she loved the experience. Would highly recommend! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"La Kabob is a sweet stop for a quick Lebanese lunch or dinner.  I usually have the Mujadara or veggie platter.  Either way is a decent lunch."}
{"text":"I had the beef shawarma and the grape leaves and they were absolutely fantastic. The restaurant inside is very clean and comfortable to eat in. The staff was very friendly and you can tell they really cared about the quality of their food and service. Definitely going to make La Kabob a regular."}
{"text":"Have eaten here a number of times. Our standard order includes the La Kabob platter (large), which includes a nice variety of items (chicken kabob, kafta kabob, beef kabob, falafel, hummus, rice pilaf, and pita bread). This family of 5 (including 3 youngin's under 10yrs) rounds out the platter with a nice salad (the spinach one with house dressing is GREAT), and one chicken and rice kids meal. Makes for an economical, tasty, and healthy dinner! Service is always very friendly and fast."}
{"text":"I stopped in here to pick up some food to take home to my family.  While waiting I decided to order some hummus and pita while waiting (the amazing smells coming from the grill made me hungry). The hummus was the best I've ever had.  In talking to the owner and his daughter, I learned that all their dishes are homemade.  The food I took home was delicious too.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch, ordered too much. Also had the Turkish coffee. Everything was good, the Pilaf is some of the best I've had, spinach pies were lacking but nothing is as good as moms sometimes."}
{"text":"We have had a couple good experiences with this local spot. We carry out each time. Service is quick and friendly. They make items from scratch very authentic. I would highly recommend: Chicken Shwarma, Gyro and Tabouli. This is now one of our go to places."}
{"text":"Definitely a fan of La Kabob in Strongsville! Passed this place up for months and finally gave it a try today. A great family run business that were very friendly in helping me get a better feel for the menu. However, I had to go with what I know and ordered the traditional Lamb Gyro Entree. I didn't expect this to be a put-it-together-yourself sort of meal but glad it was after seeing the generous portions included. The meat was perfect and juicy, the cucumber sauce just right, and the veggies helped fill up this surprisingly great gyro. I now know where I will be getting my gyro fix around town. Try it out!"}
{"text":"Really good food here, much fresher tasting than Aladdin's! We love the vegetarian platter, kabob wraps and gyros. The baba ganoush and taboli are great, the falafel is good but a little too dense. Gyro meat and beef kabobs are both very flavorful and tender. The two sauce options on the sandwiches are also both great, we usually get them on the side so they don't make it soggy. Beware that the hot sauce is really spicy so taste it before pouring it on! We also have always had stellar service here and it seems like a local, family owned place which is nice. Definitely one of the best healthy, fast options in the area."}
{"text":"update :)  It is very possible that I went back again today for lunch.  Today I got the beef shawarma wrap and the seasoned beef was so tender.    I took a lunch order for 6 other people in the office today and called ahead for pick up - They make everything in front of you so call ahead if you are not planning on eating there."}
{"text":"Omg I love this place. Food is great. We had the fatoosh salad, chicken kabob (shishtawook), and gyro. Everything was delicious. Service was phenomenal."}
{"text":"Amazing food so happy I found this restaurant! Definitely the best Lebanese food around this area. Had the chicken kabob platter and I'm addicted. Chicken was tender and rice was awesome. Owner was very friendly as well."}
{"text":"I will definitely come back to this place!!! Not only was the food amazinggggg, but the whole experience from beginning to end was perfect! The owner introduced himself and was very polite and patient even though it was busy. The prices are unbeatable as well!!! Devoted family owned businesses like this should be encouraged!"}
{"text":"Nice family owned place with friendly service. Food is great and freshly made. Their menu has a wide variety of vegetarian dishes (marked by a green cedar tree), and their chicken kabob is delicious. A great place for anybody who is looking to try Lebanese food."}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant last week. There is a great welcoming feel. The gentleman behind the counter (I'm assuming the owner) is very pleasant. Every dish is prepared when you order and the food is great. I also had a Lebanese red wine which is also great.  I will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Fast service, kind staff, great food!  Lots of vegetarian options and some for us meat lovers too.  Great place for lunch, and I plan on visiting VERY regularly."}
{"text":"My wife's family is Lebanese so that makes my wife fairly picky about Lebanese food. Our first experience back this past summer wasn't the best at the time due to a problem with some of their kitchen equipment (I think they had just opened not too long before that day and were still ironing out some of the issues with serving the lunch time rush)  That being said though, even the slow service that one time has made me want to come back for more because of the food. Not to say I don't like variety, but hands-down my favorite dish there is the Beef Shawarma plate. The spices used on the meat bring out a burst of flavor that is hard to find elsewhere. Having lived in the New Jersey the past couple of years, I know of a few Lebanese Restaurants in Brooklyn that I felt set a standard....after going to La Kabob I think that I may have to rethink what I know about Lebanese Food.  If you are near Strongsville or even just passing through Cleveland and heading south on I-71, take a time-out to get off at Royalton Rd towards the mall, then left at Pearl and pay La Kabob a visit. I have yet to be disappointed or dissatisfied with the quality of the food served here.  Great stuff, 5-stars!!"}
{"text":"Delicious. I got the veggie falafel and really enjoyed it, probably my favorite falafel ever actually, especially with the sauces/dressings and tabbouli on the side."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this place quite by accident after some Sunday TJ Maxxin' in Strongsville Ohio.  It was set back in a little plaza and would have been easy to miss. Gladly we didn't, because this place is fantastic. The first thing we noticed were the very reasonable menu prices. The next thing was how friendly and conversational the staff were. This is a family owned business and they really give it a personal feel. To start off, Jen and I shared a Fattoush salad, which was light and refreshing.  Jen had the Mjaddra, which is steamed lentils mixed with rice. I was having trouble picking one thing, so I had the La Kabob platter (small) which is Shish Tawook, Kafta Kabob, Shish Kabob, Falafel, Hummus, & rice pilaf. Each bite was more delicious than the next. The tahini sauce was perfect, and I also recommend their homemade hot sauce. We left feeling absolutely satisfied. I will certainly be coming back here. I agree with another reviewer that this is like a cafe version of Aladdin's, but with a more personal feel."}
{"text":"I come here almost everyday after work. The food is healthy and affordable. They have the best rice pilaf I've ever had. The chicken has a great taste. And the owner is a great guy."}
{"text":"One of the worst parts about moving from NYC back to Strongsville was the lack of great unique restaurants that NYC had! I was so glad to come back and find a new Lebanese place, because Lebanese food was one of my staples in NYC!  The beef shawarma wrap was so good, the tahini dressing wasn't over powering and the beef was so tender and juicy. And the wrap all together was so much larger than anticipated, which was a nice surprise.  The falafel appetizer was also something I will be back to have again! It comes with tahini dressing, lettuce tomato, and onions. Along with some pita bread! The falafels are crisp and fresh, these blew Aladdins out of the water!  The owners are super nice and fun to talk to while you wait!  I was so relieved to discover this place when I first got back, now it is one of my new favorite places n Strongsville!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for years. Absolutely the best Lebanese food around. Hand prepared every day. Amazing falafel and shawarma. The owners are some of the nicest people you will ever meet. If you are in the area, you owe it to yourself to stop here and eat."}
{"text":"Great food. Something for everyone. We started with the Vegetarian Platter, yum. Pita bread soft and fresh. The Gyro platter was delish and my daughter fell in love with the falafel wrap. My sometimes picky son raved on the chicken kabobs. All in all a great experience. If you like Mediterranean food you will enjoy this little spot."}
{"text":"La kabob is situated in a plaza in Strongsville. As we were in the area, we decided to try it.  It was okay. I think we have high standards, coming from Dearborn and the east side of Michigan, but the food was decent. It wasn't anything like the places you see in Dearborn or even Dolce Wraps, but it was decent.  You go to the counter to order first, they bring you the food, and then you pay at the end. We ordered the baba ghanouj, chicken schwarma and the falafel schwarma. All were okay. I think they could have upped the quality of their pita as well as increased the garlic sauce, but it was okay.  Would I come back here on my own? Meh. Would I rave about it! Meh. But if you're looking to grab some fast Lebanese food, this restaurant is the place to be!"}
{"text":"My 15 year old son and I stopped in for a late lunch. He ordered the Gyro and I had the Falafel Wrap. Both were amazing! It was the best Falafel wrap I've ever had and he claimed the same about his gyro! Everything was so fresh and definitely homemade. You can tell great care is taken in making every dish!  We enjoyed chatting with the owner. Can't wait to go back again and try more things from the menu!"}
{"text":"There's definitely better Mediterranean food out there, but La Kabob is easily accessible and fast as well as quite tasty. I had the falafel wrap (which has PICKLED TURNIPS in it!) and my mom had the Mediterranean salad. Both were good and I would definitely be a regular here if I lived or worked closer!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat!! One of the best places to have a great meal. Place is clean! Would definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"Very, Very surprised this place was rated so high!!  It was clean and nicely decorated. Staff was friendly...but I knew it wasn't going to be good when they pulled the frozen Gyro meat out of a box.   My son got the gyro wrap nod I got the gyro platter, which was nothing more than some rice, a little lettuce, sauce and heated up meat.  There has to be something better around here!"}
{"text":"We happened to be in the area, and stopped at La Kabob Lebanese Grill because of the reviews, and because we haven't had good Mediterranean food in a while.  I ordered the Gyro platter with salad, husband ordered the Beef Kabob with veggies.  Both dishes were delicious - I loved the Gyro meat, on a freshly made salad (nice to get a fresh healthy meal) and my husband's beef kabob with veggies was also delicious.  Even though we don't live in the area, we will be back.  Oh and the prices are reasonable, finally a good restaurant, fresh food at a reasonable price!"}
{"text":"I love la kabob!! It's a family run restaurant which makes it so much more enjoyable.  They will recognize you when you frequent there, and they are so happy and grateful when you do so.  The food is so great and authentic!  You can never go wrong with a gyro.  The tabouli is phenomenal.  And if you ask they will even brew you a cup of fresh Lebanese coffee!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here tonight for the first time.  The owners were very friendly, coming by to ask how everything was, and checking on me, even though I was speaking distance from their counter.  The food I tried was similar to my normal Aladdins order, but this was surprisingly different and very fresh tasting.  And the prices were fantastic!  It was a bit cold inside for me, but today was one of the coldest days we've had so far this fall, so I won't hold it against them."}
{"text":"Think of it as a Mediterranean food joint that took over an old Quiznos-esque shop. But the food doesn't come as quickly though the workers are quickly and diligently working. Fresh ingredients prompts slower service and I'm willing to wait for it. But not this long (30 minutes). Perhaps it's a busy night and the open kitchen and a toaster gives the impression of a quick service. But I'm hungry and 2 people behind the grill is not a fast service.   Ended up with the chicken shwarma platter ($8). Dirt cheap especially if it's for dinner. Wasn't particularly blown away from the chicken, sauce, or the rice. But I did kill the meal in 3 minutes. The pita bread came out cold.   Pay at the end of your meal. Left unimpressed."}
{"text":"I've been visiting my mom in Strongsville and can't get enough of this place! The hummus is so delicious as is the Lebanese Salad. Everything is so fresh and so flavorful! Wish they had a restaurant by me in California!"}
{"text":"Excellent combo platter. Everything made fresh and hot. Nice people very clean modern dinning room.  Pita could have been warmed but was fresh and good with hot falafel."}
{"text":"Best Lebanese food I've had and I've been to at least a dozen or two in my life. The prices are great and Tony and Mandy are very sweet and do an outstanding job making you feel at home. I just moved to Strongsville last week and have already eaten here four times. I couldn't recommend it any more. Good job guys!"}
{"text":"This is an unassuming shopping mall restaurant. The inside looks like it had very recently been a Quiznos sub place, right down to the standard sub shop conveyor oven. When we got in the store there was no one there in terms of workers. We looked over the menu and both decided on what we wanted before a worker appeared from the back. When he appeared he was carrying a tub of food so I guess he had been in the back room preparing it. The restaurant is set up, like I said, like Quiznos. There is a counter with little tubs containing food - a sandwich assembly line. He placed the tub he had brought out into the counter and then took our order. We both ordered platters so we didn't go down the line. We ordered and sat down. Shortly he brought out our hummus app and my salad. Both were good, but the hummus won't be winning an award against other Lebanese restaurants. When we were nearly finished with those 2 dishes he brought out our entrees and cleared our dishes for us. Later he offered us to go containers. When we were ready to pay, we walked up to the counter again and the worker followed us from the table he had been sitting at talking to someone. I won't drive out of my way to this restaurant but if i am nearby I would choose it as a unique, pretty fast service, healthy option."}
{"text":"Amazing place for Lebanese eats to pastries. Healthy and vegan options as well! Definitely making it a habit of going in!"}
{"text":"We stopped in here while driving through the area on a road trip. Thanks to the previous Yelp reviewers for saving us from the monotony of fast food.   La Kabob's food was delicious and fresh and the service (which I believe was offered by the owner) was kind and attentive. Prices were reasonable and the portions were refreshingly reasonable as well. I'd rather have a smaller portion and high quality and that is what La Kabob offered. I had the falafel and my husband had the chicken and both tasted great."}
{"text":"I've been eating here since it opened.  This place has the best food in Strongsville.  I just ate there and had the La Kabob Platter.  All the meats were grilled and all were very moist and tender.  I don't know how they get such small morsels of chicken so tender and juicy, but they do.  The beef kabob had a wine and garlic marinade taste to it.  The falafel was crunchy on the outside and tender on the inside.  I could really taste the cumin and a touch of cinnamon.  Rice pilaf was fluffy.  Tender.  Pita was soft and tender.  Hummus was very good with a nice lemon and garlic flavor.  The side salad was also very fresh and had a hint of mint to it.  This place easily makes the best and most consistent food in Strongsville.  I don't know why there isn't a line out the door all the time here."}
{"text":"This little spot is fantastic! I've eaten at a few of the more well known Middle Eastern restaurants in the area, but this place blew me away! Customer service was amazing, and the food surpassed that! Everything, but the pitas are made in house. We had stuffed grape leaves, and baba, both were outstanding. For the main course, we enjoyed the gyro platter, the chicken kabob platter, and the kafta kabob platter. We all agreed that everything was seasoned and cooked to perfection. We concluded our meal with the baklava, which was great as well. We will definitely be back and would highly recommend to anyone looking for traditional Lebanese food, with a home cooked feel."}
{"text":"What an amazingly nice family serving up some of the most delicious Lebanese grub I've had.  We ordered a few catering-style plates for a family get together. The wraps are HUGE, and with the intent of serving two people. The meats were beautiful (jucey) and the the garlic sauce? WOW. There was also this tahini sauce with a bit of spice that was out of this world.   The platters of veggies are great if you order a la carte style kabobs to build your own  pita sandwiches. The falafel is some of the best I have eaten in the U.S.; Crunchy on the outside, and that lovely green tint on the inside. Herbs, my friends. Herbs.  They really should serve beer and wine. :) And if you are having an event or party, you'll get a wonderful deal on some extremely fresh food created with lovely ingredients. The pricing is great.  Support this great local business!"}
{"text":"Friendly ownership and a clean restaurant.  I visited while in the area for business.  They seemed to be doing some carry out and call ahead business but I was first in the door to eat in the store that day.  I ordered the chicken shawarma plate.  I would go to this place again but have to admit that it was really salty.  Overly salty.  Other than the salt the flavor was good.  Some people had the carry out gyros and that's probably what I would go with when back up in that area."}
{"text":"Family favorite. Great food, well prepared at reasonable prices.   Baba and Hummus are consistently good."}
{"text":"I was very excited to try this place based on the reviews posted here. I got the chicken gyro sandwich. To be honest, it was a little bland and had a TON of sauce on it. We also got a Chicken Shawerma Sandwich and that was better than the gyro.  It had a nice flavor and was served on a good pita bread. As far as side-dishes, hummus was pretty good, but not the best ever. But, to be fair, I'm pretty picky when it comes to mediterranean/ middle eastern food. I'd go back again, but would like to try something different next time."}
{"text":"Beef Kabob Wrap was good but Beef Shawarma Wrap was even better! Definitely best Lebanese since leaving NY."}
{"text":"Everything is delicious and service is superior!  Can't go wrong with anything! The hummus is my favorite here. Very garlicy, but exactly in the right amount."}
