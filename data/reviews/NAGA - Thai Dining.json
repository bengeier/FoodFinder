{"text":"After reading the previous reviews I thought I would try eating at Naga,  I love Thai food, I placed an order for delivery and sat anxiously by the door for my food to arrive.   I ordered two dinners, when my meal finally arrive, after paying, I found that the servings were lunch special servings.  I called and asked if they serving sizes were correct, the lady apologized for taking my money but said that the servings were correct.  Including tip I paid thirty dollars for a small soup bowl size of curry and about the same amount of Pad Thai.  If they continue to do business this way, as most restaurants at that location, Naga will quickly become a thing of the past."}
{"text":"I had a dream about chicken panang last night, is that weird or awesome!"}
{"text":"One my favorite places to eat. The Pad Thai is fantastic and we love the Panang Curry as well. Small and quiet place."}
{"text":"Naga is one of our staples.  The food is great.  The rama noodles are worth a try.  The atmosphere is nice.  Definately good for a date or a business lunch."}
{"text":"Our family loves Thai food, but we have made our last visit here.  We were waiting for more than 1-hour for food that was mediocre at best."}
{"text":"There was only one occasion where I experienced a negative at Naga.  An Asian man's voice hollered from the dark that \" THE KITCHEN CLOSED!\",  yet the restaurant was still open. I left that day very upset and swore never to return. Well, a year later, I had a hankering for Thai, and decided to give Naga another go. Naga is by far the very best place for Thai cuisine - their tom kah kai is devine and their chicken satay is delightful. Haven't a clue who the yutz was who yelled at me from the dark, but the friendly staff have drowned the voice of the petulant man from the past with their melodic hellos in the present."}
{"text":"Made reservations for my birthday and arrived to a swanky, fun atmosphere. They had a table reserved for my husband and I. The dining room was about half full in the middle of the week at 2pm so people clearly like to eat there. They took EXCELLENT care of us, answering any menu questions, were very attentive and the food was out very quickly. I ordered a Thai iced tea and it was great. We ordered lunch specials- both the peanut and ginger salad dressings were delicious. The corn chowder was also tasty. My husband had fried rice and he said it was really good. I ordered red curry and it was divine. They even brought out a scoop of coconut ice cream with a  candle and sang happy birthday to me. Also, the bathrooms were immaculate. Overall a great experience with fabulous food and service!"}
{"text":"Superb food, incredibly rich and tasty Panang curry unlike any we have tasted before. All the other food from the crispy tofu to the thai rolls were super fresh. The server is immensely charming and her service and attitude is absolutely wonderful. A gem of a Thai place!!"}
{"text":"I love this place! My husband and I adore Thai food and we were anxiously awaiting the opening of Naga. We went in for lunch yesterday. I had a Thai ice tea, ( which was very good ) my husband ordered the Chicken Par Ram with peanut sauce ( the peanut sauce is organic )
I ordered the Beef Pad Thai. Both entree's came with a soup and salad with your choice of 2 different dressings. 1 was a peanut based dressing and the other a Ginger base, it also came with these great little crunchy tid bits. 
The soup was a corn chowder that was so tasty! You. Can really taste the fine ingredients the use. The salads, for bring salads were great too. The entree's were of perfect portions and extremely delicious. I was sad that I couldn't eat all of it. 
Not only was the food on point but everyone that works there are extremely friendly and prompt. I'm big on customer service and this place really caters to their guests. I'm looking forward to going there on a weekly basis and hope this place stays around for a long time."}
{"text":"Best Thai place I've found in Henderson! I love ordering for pick-up and all of their vegan options. I recommend them all the time!"}
{"text":"Amazing! Best Thai in Henderson. They cater to all eating habits such as gluten free, pescatarian, vegetarian, even vegan! They have a little chart I noticed by the register so that they know when you call in. Spring rolls are very flavored. Pad Thai is the best."}
{"text":"I'm so in love with this place! The decorations are incredibly beautiful, and so peaceful. I ordered spring rolls here hoping they were the ones with shrimp in it, but I was slightly disappointed that they were the fried ones... until I actually ate the crispy spring rolls. I then completely forgot about the original appetizer I was actually craving! Everything was perfectly made- the sauce, the spring rolls, the Boba I had with it. I would strongly recommend this place if you're ever craving Thai food. Best Thai restaurant I've been to so far!"}
{"text":"I came here with my husband and our family for our wedding anniversary.  On a Tuesday with what appeared to be minimal staffing.  We are a large family (7) so my husband specifically asked the server if they adjust the food to family portions.  Most Thai and Asian places I have eaten at usually do that and adjust your check accordingly.  We ordered the combination plate ($11) as an appetizer, it was good but skimpy for $11.  We also ordered Pad Kee Mao or the Drunken Noodles, Green Curry, and fresh mushroom curry.  I thought it took a long time to serve us.  We waited 45 min for our food to arrive.  I saw people who had come in after us eating before us.  When the food finally did come it came with two small single size portions of rice.  Really???  A family of 7 and we were assured that the portions would be adjusted.  I had to order everyone their own bowl of rice.  The food was cold and over salted.  It actually tasted like it had sat out before it was brought to us.  All I could taste was salt.  I rarely write comments, but this was so bad.  I have had good Thai and bad Thai, but this wasn't even Thai, it was like some Americanized version of Thai.  Over a $100 for that meal for the 7 of us and three of us left hungry.  Isn't Thai dining about making sure you feed your customer enough?  Isn't Thai dining about taking pride and showing that pride in the food you prepare?    I left hungry and angry.  This establishment is very lucky my husband paid the tab because in my opinion a tip was not deserved, and he tips well.  This is NOT a good place for good Thai."}
{"text":"Just went here for the first time today for lunch. Great thai food - also, they were very careful, because we are vegetarian, not to put fish sauce in any of the dishes. Flavors were very good - we got a spice level of 2 for everything (hubby doesn't like very spicy food) and then I added some sambal oelek to that to get a very spicy set of dishes! The drunken noodles were especially a standout. Service was efficient and friendly. The only drawback I could see has to do with the dining room layout - it is a small space, and many of the tables are very close together. Otherwise, a great thai place!"}
{"text":"I went to Naga Tonight for dinner. I ordered the Chicken Pad Thai and the chicken Tom Kah soup. The pad Thai was really good. The Tom Kah soup, on the other hand, was more like onion soup. There were so many onions in it, that it made it inedible. There were supposed to be mushrooms and tomatoes in it, but there was literally only half of a cherry tomato in it, with a couple of mushrooms. I won't be ordering the soup again, unless I can request that there are NO onions."}
{"text":"The decor is amazing and sets a relaxed mood for dining. The food was outstanding and I finally found a place that has spicy food! The Thai coffee is a must to try."}
{"text":"Oh, this...this hurts to write because the food is so good. I went in today (Sunday) and there was nobody else there except a party of four. The waitress first asked me if I was picking up a to go order, and once I said no, I'm here to dine in, she brought me a menu and then NOTHING. She paid attention to the party of four (she's probably the same lady Sanaz S. wrote about) but literally did not even take my drink order, and I sat there for over five minutes before I walked out. Again, literally no one else in the restaurant besides me and this group. This is completely inexcuseable and I will not be going back, no matter how good the crab rangoons are."}
{"text":"First time at NAGA Thai. I had the salad rolls and the Pad Pak prepared vegan. They were amazing. The place is very modern and contemporary. It is a relaxing ding experience. Prices are very reasonable. Love that meat eaters and vegans can dine together with so many tasty choices for both."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite local places to eat. The pineapple rice is a family favorite. It's always pretty full so call ahead or order out. So yummy"}
{"text":"\"Thank you!\"  Thai food gods. Finally a great Thai place in \" Real\" Henderson. No need to drive to spring mountain anymore. 


Phang (sp?) is my favorite waitress there."}
{"text":"It was delicious! I ordered the yellow curry ( my standard go to) and was thoroughly impressed. Dad loved the panang curry. Wonderful service and quiet, upscale atmosphere."}
{"text":"Food was very good. I had the panang curry with shrimp. They offer spiciness at levels 1-4, but honestly, 4 is not very hot. If you really like some heat, I suggest you order level 5+, or you can ask for hot sauces. There's a powder that they give you that gives a good spicy kick.

The ambience is very clean and modern, dimly lit. The service was very friendly.

The music was very nice. Great downtempo electronic music. Created a very relaxing atmosphere."}
{"text":"There were 5 of us in our party, we went for dinner on Friday night and we called in advance to make a reservation. We had been here twice before and thought it was very good, however, it's been over a year since we last went. We walked in and were seated immediately, which is great but, the booth they seated us in was very odd...shaped like an L so that the person sitting at the end had no room for their legs because of the person seated next to them, other than that, the decor is still very nice. We ordered a cocktail, two had beer, two had a glass of their house (least expensive) chardonnay and one (my daughter) ordered their house Pinot Noir, I believe all were $6...not bad right :) The drinks come and the server sets down what was supposed to be the Pinot and says here is your glass (of something else, that I can't remember the name of) which was a nice wine but, it was $9 a glass not $6 as the the one she ordered. We all looked at each other and my daughter says to the server, this is not what I ordered, the server tells her we are out of the Pinot Noir but this is very good, my daughter said, Ok that's fine but it will be $6 right? The server said oh, I don't know, let me check with someone and took the wine away. No one came back so when we ordered another round we asked again (this was a different server) about the wine price (this time I was going to order a glass of red as well) and again the server said, let me check, she came back with the other cocktails but no red wine and no reply to our question, one more time we asked and this time the server laughed and said nooo we can't do that....by then we were disgusted and we both ordered a beer. The food was good. We ordered the Kratong Tong (Golden Cups) and the Crab Rangoon. Golden cups were as good as we had remembered although a bit smaller and the Crab Rangoon was outstanding...I have never had it with so much filling, very very good! Two had the Panang with chicken and it too was very good, not as spicy as they wanted (husband eats VERY hot food and always orders \"Thai Hot\") but still good. Someone ordered the Laab which was just as described, light and well seasoned. Daughter ordered Pad Kee Mao, which she always orders no matter where we go, and thought it was good but thinks it's better at another place we go all the time. I had Pad See Eiw and thought it was better than I've had at other places, noodles were perfectly cooked and the sauce was wonderful. The ambiance is nice, the food is good, service was okay but we were very annoyed when they didn't inform us prior to ordering the wine that they were out of basically their house red, and then brought a substitute without asking, that was a lot more expensive and then refused to go ahead and give us the substitute for the lower price and laughed at us for asking! So for us, we have a very good Thai restaurant in the neighborhood where the food is as good and the service is excellent, we probably won't go out of our way to return."}
{"text":"This food is so delicious!  I have gotten both the yellow curry and pad thai many times and they are consistently fantastic.  The ambience is super relaxed and chic, especially in the evening. There is always cool music playing as well!  For pick up orders, my order is always on time.  For dining in, the staff is very attentive and professional.  The lunch portion during the day is perfect, however if you get the regular portion, be prepared to share the meal or have leftovers!"}
{"text":"Food is delicious and service is outstanding. I had the panang curry and it was fantastic"}
{"text":"The food is fantastic, I could eat the Catfish Dynamite every time I go there, but then I would miss out on the other fantastic dishes. I highly recommend having a Singha Beer with the Catfish, it definitely enhances the flavor. The Fried Bananas are cooked to perfection, still firm yet soft and with a fantastic flavor. 

I do have to warn you, when you go don't expect to get out in a hurry as the service is \"relaxed\" some would say slow, but I enjoy sipping some Sake after my meal and having a nice conversation with my company so I don't find it to be that big of an issue."}
{"text":"I normally don't give any restaurant a 5 star coz I am really picky. But after coming here for twice, I have to give this restaurant some credit. The green curry is very good and authentic. I think it's the best in henderson. So far everything we've ordered are pretty good. Will definitely come back again. The serving is a bit slow though , probably because it's still a relative new place. Hopefully will be improving I n the future"}
{"text":"This is an amazing find... The Pad Kee Mau is the best I've ever had and the Full Moon Animosity is fantastic....I have yet to find something here I don't like."}
{"text":"Best food ever! Absolutely love all their appetizers, you really can't go wrong! My all time favorite entree is the Rama noodles. Anybody I've taken there loves them. I also like their boba shakes and the corn chowder. Oh and I wish I could buy a bottle of their chili sauce, it's the best!"}
{"text":"Excellent food!  The chicken Pad Thai and the Rama Noodles were both very good.  The hint of pickled veggies on the Pad Thai is a nice touch.  The Naga salad has a lime dressing that's definitely worth trying.  And my favorite, Tom Kha chicken soup was very well done.

The lunch special includes soup and salad in perfect portions and at a good price."}
{"text":"My husband and I LOVE this place! We've been here so many times, while we lived in the area. The staff is friendly the atmosphere is awesome and the decor is very nice. Our favorite appetizer is by for the Chicken Satay. I had the Prawns in Tom Yum Noodle Soup, there's a wait for it, but it was so worth it!! We've also tried several of the noodle dishes which was absolutely divine!"}
{"text":"Outstanding food.  I placed a small to go order and I showed up 20 mins later to find that I was not ready.  The women there are very nice.  They recently hired some white guy that is a complete douche and needs to fired that runs the register.  that ass hat was just standing there sizing me up the whole time I was waiting.  I thought I was going to have to throw down in the thai restaurant!  Anyways, the dude was unpleasant, rude, and just put me off to the whole place and unfortunately I will not be returning.  Wahoos next door is excellent though :)"}
{"text":"NAGA Thai is good for date night or if you're looking for a more upscale dining experience. The decor is very contemporary as well as the dishes and the presentation of the food. The service was good, and the food was good too. For the times you are craving Thai food, I would go elsewhere cheaper. If you want something a bit nicer, then I recommend this place."}
{"text":"Haven't eaten at your restaurant yet because your prices are just to high for a Thai restaurant. Your prices scare me. The best Thai restaurants I know don't charge that much. For those prices you better have large portions. Or all the ingredients you guys are using better be Certified organic, grass fed beef and free range Jadori chicken. I bet your food is delicious but not at white table cloth fine dining prices."}
{"text":"Great food, service, ambiance...just love dining here. Love their chicken panang, moo ping, shrimp and vegetable fried rice, n of course their signature dish which Is lemongrass chicken and for dessert their mango with sticky rice. I often go here n tell my friends about it. if u haven't tried their food, u should come n check it out :D"}
{"text":"Great place. We order from there all the time. If your in the mood for Thai this is the place."}
{"text":"Visited Naga Thai for the first time for dinner on Friday evening. We usually go to Lotus of Siam or Weera Thai, but I have to say Naga Thai is now at the top of our list. Though it's almost 20 miles for us to drive, it's worthwhile. The service is warm and friendly (they wanted to know our names), and the food is excellent. I usually do not like catfish (it always tasted like mud to me), but the chef at Naga Thai prepares it in a way that is ..... (I have no words!). Had the Rama Noddles with Seafood (Catfish, Shrimp, Squid, Mussels), and when I go there next time I will have it again.  Probably every time.

Also, my wife has special dietary needs. The waitress was happy to ask in the kitchen, and chef was happy to tweak a dish so my wife could eat it.  Not every place does this.

Congratulations to Naga Thai for great service and quality food!"}
{"text":"Nagas food is pretty good, if you like spice go with a higher number. The rice dessert with coconut ice cream is a must!!!"}
{"text":"Food is great! curries, mango sweet rice, noodle dishes - very authentic. 

Owner/management is in question (see below)

I had an issue with service from the owner during my latest delivery. I was upset that no one told me about the up charge for shrimp. $4 up charge for shrimp. OK not a big problem in the grand scheme of things but tell me about this up-charge...
No, instead it's glazed over by the lady taking my order who lacks in communication skills. What is clear is that the owner hasn't trained their employees to communicate fully to customers when taking a delivery order.

Exhibit A: the owner's own communication skills 

He delivered the food to me and I questioned the charge. I told him that never was I told about it and that is it a large charge not to be told about. He did not apologize. Instead, he asked me if I asked the lady taking my order what the charge was for. I told him I asked what the delivery charge was, but didn't know I needed to ask about a charge I was not aware existed...he then told me all the prices are online. So not only is he arrogantly wanting to argue but here he automatically justified the service error by assuming that all people have access to their menu online and thus will know every charge that should ever come up. NOT an ok assumption to make. 

There was a completely different way to approach this issue but you failed with a staggering lack of communication! And thank you for giving me 4 $1 bills to make up for your errors. You need service recovery training."}
{"text":"If I had to choose 2 out of 3 of the following life punishments 1.) Eat at Naga one more time 2.) Eat a bowl full of bull excrement 3. Or get kicked repeatedly in the nuts by an NFL Punter...--I'd say out loud, \"shine that bowl and bring me my support cup\".  Sincerely, very disgruntled patron.

After waiting One Hour and Twenty-Five minutes with still No Food...we called it quits.  The last straw came when our own waiter approached our table and asked if we were ready for a Dessert Menu. We had never received our Dinner?  The Naga staff is as scattered brained as they come...."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and got the yellow curry chicken lunch special. Came with salad and soup. Everything was really tasty and flavorful, and I thought the service was excellent. It's a solid Thai restaurant. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Well...Naga is definitely back to four stars.  The owners have addressed the service issues to an acceptable level, and each of my last four or five trips have been downright pleasant.  The food has remained consistently great, and the only roadblock to a five star rating for me is the high price of dining here.  Regardless, I will still be making a couple trips a month to enjoy the Naga goodness."}
{"text":"So glad I found a great Thai place near my house, you know for those unexpected cravings for a spicy Thai soup or curry. Coupled with the awesome services, even for take out, there is very little lacking in this wonderful restaurant.

The papaya salad here is perhaps some of the best I have had especially since they do not add the dried shrimp or crab that other Thai places do. Just the vegetables, peanuts, and tamarind sauce is all that is in this dish and it is perfect as is. 

Since I was in a soup mood, I ordered the Tom Yum with Shrimp. This soup was absolutely delicious and the onions were thoroughly cooked. The one thing that threw me off was the addition of tomatoes which perhaps I had never had before or noticed in other Tom Yum I've tried. Even as left overs, the soup did not lose any flavor and tasted just as fresh as if it had just been cooked.

The service at Naga is the best I have had in quite sometime. When called to place my order, the lady on the phone asked me how my day was before getting down to business(who does that now a days??). When I walked in, they instantly knew I was there to pick up my food and were so polite. The service did not end when I left the restaurant. Each item was in it's own container that was wrapped up tightly in a plastic bag which was then placed in a larger bag. This attention to detail is outstanding and along with the food, will be having me back to try more."}
{"text":"Holy NAGA
ABSOLUTELY the Best Thai food ever. Even Taiwanese people say it's better than home. Start with the Spring Rolls and Golden Cups. This food is soooo good it may be illegal."}
{"text":"Driving up to Vegas from Phoenix--this is the perfect lunch spot. Just off the freeway in Henderson, super easy to get to and lots of parking. 

The special spinach appetizer is the most unusual Thai dish we had--really great combination of flavors, including dried shrimp and coconut, lime, and super hot chilis. 

Veggie dishes were in order so we had the Evil Forest Noodle--packed with basil and red curry. The yellow curry was also full of veggies and just the right spiciness. All around everything was great. 

So, stop for lunch or take a break from the Strip, it is worth the trip for sure."}
{"text":"We drive to Henderson from Boulder City to eat at Naga. It's worth the trip. Food and service is awesome. I really love the drunken noodles. 

Naga brings back fond memories of my many trips to Thailand where I met the friendliest people and ate the most amazing food."}
{"text":"We stopped for lunch last week. We enjoyed your Basil Chicken, Satay and Panang curry.  Your food taste like authentic Thai food.  Your Thai tea is very good, not too sweet unlike other Thai restaurant. Atmosphere is very modern and welcoming."}
{"text":"Their pad Thai and chicken satay is the best! 

I love to go at lunch because they have great deals. 
The portion is a little smaller but still very filling. The entree with the lunch deal also comes with a small salad and delicious soup. My go-to Thai restaurant!"}
{"text":"I can honestly say that my boyfriend and I eat here weekly. Anytime he asks if I want to go to dinner, Naga is the first place I think of. Every dish I have tried I have fallen in love with, which makes it hard when it comes time to decide what to eat. We usually start out with the combination plate as an appitizer, which has tofu eggroll, rangoons, and chicken satay. My top favorites dishes to order are evil jungle, pinapple curry, and pad thai. My boyfriend always gets the Rama noodle and has to swat me away from trying to eat off of his dish.  The customer service is awesome, and I never leave dissappointed, only full!"}
{"text":"I had the Panag Red Curry with chicken and it was soooooooooo good. Their curry is a bit thicker than normal and I liked that because it coated my chicken well.

Their spicy levels go to 4 and I chose a 3 because I like spicy! If you want to feel the heat go with 4. My curry was a level three and it was spicy enough to feel a little heat but not too spicy that I couldn't taste or enjoy the other flavors in my dish. If you can tolerate only a little bit of spice go with 1.

The restaurant itself is very small so if you are going during Lunch perhaps you should make a reservation. We got there around 11:45 and it wasn't full but by the time we were done the place had every sit filled.

The décor is very modern and simple. Very cute.

Our waitress was very helpful in telling us about the dishes we ordered since it was our first time and their lunch specials.

I plan to go again soon."}
{"text":"3 spitting Nagas.

Finally came in after driving pass this place a million times. When I think of Hendertucky, I don't think of Thai food, I definitely don't think of good Thai restaurant. What a surprise! 

The food here is 4 stars, it was very good. I got the Chicken Pad See Eiw and it was a generous portion for $11. The chicken was perfectly spiced. 

My gf got the Salad Rolls, and Chicken Tom Yum soup. Neither of liked the Salad Rolls, we thought it'd be like Vietnamese Spring Rolls, but they're not. It's exactly what they say, a bunch of lettuce wrapped in rice paper with a tiny piece of chicken in the middle. 

The Tom Yum soup was a generous portion for $6.25. She said it was good. 

There were alcoholic cocktails too for those that like to imbibe with their meal. 

The place is trendy-upscale, not what we were expecting. We would've liked a homier mom-and-pop place with cheaper prices. But that's not their fault, however that's why I dropped a star. The food and location didn't justify the prices. But it would be a good place for a fancier date."}
{"text":"First time eating at Naga and it was extremely DELICIOUS. The service was extraordinary our server was friendly, polite, and quick. He also helped us order our food. I didn't know what I wanted to eat so I asked him to help us choose. I thought he was only going to choose one but he gave a item he liked under every category and I thought it was very polite of him. Food came on time. never had our drinks empty and the food was GREAT!!!!! I will definately be returning to NAGA again thanks to the service and FOOD!!!!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Fantastic service. Perfect music in the background. They had fantastic fresh fried noodles to snack on with a yummy selection of dipping sauces. The soup was out of this world. The curry was tasty and they added some vegetables I have never seen in Thai food before like green beans and broccoli florets. They added a nice crunch that was refreshing. The only drawback I had was that they did not make my dish spicy enough. Even though I am a white boy I enjoy authentic Thai 5 star spice. The problem is ever getting some Thai chef to believe me... So I had to add crushed red pepper, which in my opinion always detracts from the flavor .

Overall it was a nice change to the typical bar food choices in Henderson."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Very friendly staff. Didn't give us the stink eye for coming in right before closing. I would highly recommend the fried rice!!!"}
{"text":"Great lunch menu, fast service and excellent quality of both Thai and Asian-fusion dishes."}
{"text":"This place is tucked away on the side of black mountain
I think this place is a five star but this is because it is in
My hood. Very consistent spot

If you live in Henderson take advantage 
Take out is a good idea 
Good customer service"}
{"text":"This place is located close to where I live.  It is very clean and modern.  The seats are close to each other so plan on talking about general topics and hope that you do not offend someone sitting next to you.  Other than that, the food is good and the service is excellent."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. My girlfriend and I have been coming back almost every week for just under a year. Their red curry is phenomenal. It's by far the best Tai food I've had in the 8 years that I've lived in the Las Vegas area. I look forward to continuing my patronage at this wonderful establishment."}
{"text":"My husband and I come here frequently because it is so delicious! He always orders Pad See Ew and I Order the Chicken Pad Thai. Not only are they fast, yummy and have a clean environment, they are so kind! Tonight I came to pick up my To-go order and accidentally locked my keys in my car. So sweetly they gave me a table, made my meal for in house and they gave me complimentary snacks. Thank you!! Seriously the best Thai around!"}
{"text":"4.33 Stars!
Okay, so I couldn't give them the whole row of stars but was tempted. 

Unfair to Naga that Thai restaurants within relatively close driving distance of Lotus of Siam will be graded on a bell curve. Quite the curve and when I say relatively close driving distance to L.O.S. I mean using any number of interstates to get there is sufficient. 

Been to Naga a number of times since their soft opening a few months back with some dudes from work. This was the first time we've dined here since they rolled out their new full menu. We all were pleased to see the vast variety of items offered along with a few items that we hadn't seen other places and we're curious about trying possibly in the near future. We all played it safe with ordering from the \"Lunch Special\" menu.  

First impressions are pleasant. As you walk in you can't help but see the attention to detail in their decor. Your welcomed to a trendy yet not in an overbearingly ultra-loungy annoying way (I think I've heard the term \"simple-sheik\" used on the DIY Network once). Very good use of space as they have quite a few table-tops for the amount of space given without the feeling of claustrophobia. They have spared no expense to their look, even on down to the fresh flowers that adorn the center of each table. As a side note, their decor even lends itself to your post-meal entertainment as you frolic, I mean navigate, through the steal beaded curtain that separates the dining area from the restroom hallway. I've never had so much fun walking to the bathroom, but I digress. 

Service! The service is refreshing. The owner and our server greeted us very warmly as has been the case with every other visit. THIS visit however really solidified my contentment with Naga. On this visit we were the fortunate recipients of \"The Four Spirits\". What are the Four Spirits you might ask? Naga uses a spice rating for their food on a scale of 1-4. Each level of spice is represented by a spirit. For Example, 1 is represented with the title of \"Sleeping Spirit\" , 2=Walking Spirit, 3=Running Spirit and 4=Angry Spirit. The Four Spirits were presented to us in a sweet and sour sauce on a classy partitioned dish (see photo of The Four Spirits) as an appetizer along with fried wonton noodles to help you fight the urge from using your drink straw as a delivery device. Perfect and creative way to demonstrate their heat rating system. 

The trio of soup, salad and wonton noodles starts the meal off quite well. The Corn Soup is uniquely tasty and the ginger or peanut dressing on the salad brings a nice balance to the soup. Between  the three of us we ordered Yellow Curry, Pork Pad Kee Mao and Garlic Pepper Chicken. All three of us agreed the quality, freshness and distinctive taste of our meals were top-notch. Our drinks were refilled without request  and seemed to have a constant flow, which is a good thing since we always eat Thai food as an excuse to eat Prik Nam Pla (Thai peppers in Fish sauce).
 
We looked for a negative and had a hard time really finding one. For a brief moment we thought that the portion size for lunch leaned more towards the small side but quickly realized our regular place spoils us tremendously and that we were gluttonous American's whose serving size equates to a large ethiopian village feast. Then we hobbled out the front door to our large vehicle stating that if we ate anything else we'd be in severe pain."}
{"text":"Mom and pop little restaurant, food is good, staffs are very attentive. decent price. will go back"}
{"text":"Yummy curry chicken, and the pork fried rice was delicious as well. Clean and very quaint restaurant. I'm glad I stopped by to try it out."}
{"text":"Ok this place is a little odd.  It does not look like a typical Thai restaurant at all.  It look modern and sparse.  Service was a bit slow, but when the food arrived it was EXCELLENT!  Don't let the non appearance fool you!   The food is great and I will be back!"}
{"text":"I love this place the people and the food. Try the Pad pak for a healthy vegi dish. The jungle noodle are great on a cheat day. I crave the Tom Ka chicken soup all the time. I turned so many people on to Thai with Naga. It's always reliable for a good meal."}
{"text":"This place is a really great place to go for some really great and affordable Thai food. I was here for the second time with a friend and the food was really tasty. 

The thing that most impressed me was that when we went there was a very strong and disturbing sewer smell in the complex where the building was located. Even though we knew the restaurant can't really control this we decided to simply ignore it and continue to eat our awesome food. 

We noticed a lot of people complaining and talking to the management about the smell and the Naga Team were courteous and very professional about the situation. 

When we asked for the check, a man who seems to be the owner came to our table apologizing for the smell (which was not his fault) and gave us a discount on our meal. 

I was super impressed and pleased with the service and the team at Naga. I would highly recommend this place to anybody who is looking to try a new Thai place. 

p.s. Try the peanut sauce!"}
{"text":"Food were delicious and tasteful..

Waitress is nice and accomodating. Took them a while to get the orders but its ok. 

Caramel coffee shake taste and blended well, not too sweet. Just right amount of coffee 

Will definitely come back"}
{"text":"Best Thai food I have ever eaten! Love the modern decor and ambience. The Tom Yum soup and Rama Noodle are my favorites. The peanut sauce is delicious. If you frequent the place, they actually remember your name. 

My only complaints: 
1) When dining there, my soda was flat so I asked to change it to an ice tea. The server charged me for both the soda and the ice tea, which I thought was odd.
2) One time when I ordered takeout, I ordered my soup #4 spice level. When I got home my soup was more like a level 0/no spiciness. They were closed by the time I noticed the error. I went in the next day, ordered another soup, and informed the server of the error with my takeout order from the night before. She barely offered an apology  :( I was pretty disappointed considering I used to frequent the establishment several times a month."}
{"text":"Last night I ordered the crab fried rice. The flavor was just OK.There was barely any crab. I ordered here because it is closer to my house. But I will take the extra drive and stick with Thailicious. More flavor, more for my buck and they fill it with crab. I was underwhelmed by Naga. Eh"}
{"text":"7pm Thursday 8/30. OUCH! I guess the chef was not there that night. Pad See Eew Chicken was nasty... My Thai wife was stunned how bad it was. Some white guy standing at the POS system (register) all night. Maybe it was just an off night.  No Chang Beer sold out. Hmmmm. The servers pretty good that's about it.  We will not be going back...."}
{"text":"All food here is amazing! My favorite is the \"evil jingle\". I get it extra spicy. This means I will have exiting issues later, but it is totally worth it.. The staff here are very nice and on top of things. I love their accent. Love the environment here. Best Thai I have ever had!"}
{"text":"I'm pretty much addicted to their Rama lunch! You cannot beat it! Always tasty & fresh. Family owned and super friendly staff! The atmosphere is great! Does not feel like your in a strip mall."}
{"text":"Love brown rice option! Veggie options are abundant as well.. Thus far every dish was amazing."}
{"text":"Amazing place , friendly and accommodating staff.  They bent over backwards to accommodate my celiac disease gluten intolerance .  The owner/chef personally went through what items she could make gluten free!

Thank You ! :-)

Highly Recommend"}
{"text":"Enjoyed munching on the won ton chips and four sweet, hot dipping sauces while we looked over the menu. We had the combination plate, Tom Kah soup with chicken, Pad Kee Mao with pork (otherwise known as 'drunken noodles'), and the Pad Pak with chicken. 

Everything we ordered was a hit: well-prepared, carefully presented, and a nice amount of flavor and spice. We went with \"level two spiciness\" on everything, which was more than enough but not \"call the fire department\" out of control. Definitely will visit again when I'm in town."}
{"text":"I never write reviews but this place is a mess. 10 minutes to even get water. They weren't busy. Only one other table with two people seated. Another couple came in and were seated but not attended to so after 5 minutes of them sitting there and not even getting service they left. Our food took 25 minutes to come out and our waters were empty by then but not even a refill on the waters until half way through the meal and only got checked up on once when we finally got a refill. Trying to get anyone's attention is impossible. You can shake your hands in the air since they don't come out of that backroom and they will see it and ignore you. I got a chicken satay and asked for more peanut sauce because it was like one teaspoon of sauce for 5 satay sticks and was told it's $2 for some sauce. WTH. Ordered $85 of food and you still want to charge for a teaspoon of sauce. I can understand if it was a huge amount but for a teaspoon. Are you kidding me. The panang curry was literally like 5 tablespoons of curry and when I told the waitress there is no curry in here only chicken that's coated with curry, her response was that's how our Panang curry is. That's the first time I've ever seen chicken coated with sauce called panang curry. And I mean literally 3 to 5 tablespoons of curry. Truly the food was good but the service was soo crappy and the portions are to laugh at. I will never come back here again. Many spots that are just as good with much better portions and the biggest thing in a restaurant business, SERVICE!"}
{"text":"Really good drinks.  Coconut bubble shake is wonderful. Fried rice is Very good.  Love the place"}
{"text":"I've lived in this area for 6 years now and always seen it getting off the freeway ,it wasn't till my husband became a yelper that we decided to try a few of the eateries that are in the same complex we always walked by till we finally decided to walk in ,first imprecision was like wow fancy and small felt a lil under dress since we been shopping and were in sweats lol but employes are very friendly and the food was amazing all so very clean is a nice small and quiet place  for a date night  I will defenatly be back ."}
{"text":"One our favorite digs in Henderson.
Currently on a mission to try the entire menu and so far, nothing has disappointed!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to Naga yet so this rating might change but the delivery service was great! The woman on the phone was really nice and spoke English which is always a plus. The food arrived in a timely manner and the guy that delivered it was very courteous. The fried tofu I thought was quite bland but that's all I have to complain about. The Moo Ping (grilled pork ap) was delicious as were the spring roles, Crab Rangoon, Chicken Satay, and red curry with chicken. I however can't give this place a 5 star until I go and judge the service and atmosphere but I expect this will happen soon!"}
{"text":"Why Over Priced!!!! Dont get the chicken in your dish it is so Blaaaaa, No seasoning and on the rubber side....You guys need to season your meat then cook it then put the sauce on! The sauce isnt going to make unseasoned meat taste good....And use chicken Thighs the breast meat is way to dry for this kinda food.."}
{"text":"I tried the Thai Burger  (as a double) which was unusual to find. First, it IS spicy (which I love), if you don't or can't do spicy, that is unfortunate for you because you'll miss out on one of most flavorful burgers I have ever tasted!
I look forward to coming back and trying some of my usual favorites, but I will definitely be back for the burger!"}
{"text":"This is now our favorite local restaurant.  Love the crab rangoon, shrimp in a blanket, moo ping and chicken satay appetizers.  Best crab rangoon I have ever had!  Rama noodle and Pad Thai are so super super good.  The cucumber salad is very refreshing and excellent palate cleanser.  The one time we did have a mistake in our order, the manager corrected it immediately.  We have only gotten delivery from here so I cannot speak to a sit down experience; however, our experiences are always good ones.  Thank you Naga!"}
{"text":"Great service, Great Atmosphere! Never disappointed everytime I'm here! I recommend anyone who loves Thai food to stop in \"Naga\"!   you will know what the great fuss is about!"}
{"text":"If you love Thai food, chef Nan is amazing, authentic cuisine and delightful cozy atmosphere, one of my favorite places to dine!"}
{"text":"Food here is unbelievable. We used to go to Pin Kaow bit this place blows it out of the water."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff! We went here in preparation for our trip to Thailand. They explained the dishes to us, the spices, and even let us practice our Thai. Affordable and very very yummy. Cute little dining area that is intimate."}
{"text":"Love the pad see yew and the Rama noodle.  The atmosphere is pleasant and does well as take out as well"}
{"text":"Thai is each our favorite foods and having ordered at many restaurants, certain entrees are better Thai than we've ever had.  Recommend: Tom Kah soup, Panang, Evil Jungle Noodle and sweet sticky rice."}
{"text":"I consistently order Pad Thai when I go to Thai restaurants and this did not disappoint!  Its a quaint little restaurant, its everything a quiet dinning experience should be.  I approve!"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times from the soft opening, lunch and dinner a few times.

I was initially confused by the lounge style decor and wondered what the overhead must be as opposed to just placing some tables and booths and just serving Thai food.

The first couple of visits the food was pretty good while the service though polite was slow as another Yelper previously noted.

Upon my last visit the employees working that night totally changed any notion I had about the proficiency of their service.

Out waitress, Fang was absolutely adorable and was quick to suggest new items.

I went with one of the staples, that being the Tom Kah soup.  This time around it was eaten with shrimp.  It was just as wonderful as it was when eaten with chicken.

Another staple is the Pad Thai which is absolutely delicious.  

Looking to branch out I tried the Yellow Curry.  I am by no means any type of curry expert but found my curry to be very flavorful and enjoyable to eat.

Fang offered up her favorite dessert suggestion of sticky rice, coconut ice cream with fruit and it a great way to finish off the meal.

The owner stopped by our table to see how things were.  This is a nice touch as she is consistently looking to improve her restaurant.

A suggestion for those looking to spice up the meal, you can ask for a spice tray and set your meal on fire (not literally) if you desire.

Please take another suggestion of putting out the flames (not literally) with a cool glass of Thai Tea.

Please support local business and support Naga!"}
{"text":"Excellent experience from beginning to end! It was elegant inside, looking much more modern than usual Thai restaurants. The woman who took our order wrote it down then closed her notepad, and while taking our menus, repeated the orders back to us, off the top of her head, getting them all correct. The food was very good! We ordered 4 different dishes and they all had delicious flavors, none being under or over seasoned. I had a Thai Tea with the meal and it was tasty as well. I'll definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Honestly I can't say anything bad about this place, but I also can't say anything particularly good about it, either. I've forgotten about it, which means it was neither bad or good. I'd eat here again, because it wasn't bad. 

I know that sounds like it isn't really an endorsement, but it's better than remembering this place for being crap! So I wouldn't expect some major mind-blowing meal, but it's definitely worth the money they'll charge and it'll be just fine."}
{"text":"Really good food. Great presentation, the decor is modern and clean, prices are reasonable.

The lunch specials are great, too.

I highly recommend the combo platter or crab rangoons. They are the absolute BEST rangoons I've had. Homemade deliciousness."}
{"text":"After working 12 hours under the sun with no break and lunch, so excited to try this restaurant. Which was a nice place, very clean, our food took so long 45-60 min. For two pp and my 1 year old baby. My baby was getting tired and bored. Even the manager thought we were done eating, he asked \"can I get anything else for you\", I answered \" we are just waiting for our dinner still, we haven't started yet\". If the place had a movie Netflix on the TV for entertainment , I think we would go back. But nah.... There so many Thai food out there that this place is rated two thumbs down. Taco shop next door looks good."}
{"text":"Pad Thai was more expensive than most places I've found in town but was rubbery and all stuck together in a bland glob. Not worth the price at all."}
{"text":"A big plus they  run their lunch special on Saturday.  Soup, salad and entree for under $8 is a good value. For a Saturday afternoon I thought the place was busy with 3 other parties of 2+  but I got seated and server got my drink and took took my order within in the first few minutes. It has been more than a month since I last was here, but amazingly server still remembers my drink order and choice of dressing for my salad. It was a short wait for my order to come out.  Had Pad Woon Sen w/Tofu. Servers attentive,  got my check and was in and out of there in less than 40 minutes.  I can always count on having a nice lunch experience here."}
{"text":"Over time we decide to give Naga another shot purely due to its proximity to the house. We had take out about four times after the incident and there were no more issues. The food is okay to good, but portions are small for the price. Their panang curry is actually incredibly delicious, but make sure to order extra side of rice."}
{"text":"Food is really good. I've only had food delivered to me from this place. They charge for delivery. 
There was a mix up with one of the deliveries, and I was overcharged,  but they gave me a free extra order of beef fried rice. Soooooo, that was nice. I love Thai food, I'd keep ordering from here."}
{"text":"Really happy a client told me to stop here if I was ever in the mood for some Thai food. The service is really attentive and sweet, that is always a huge plus. The food was also very good! Overall a good lunch spot and I will defiantly be coming back with some other clients after looking at potential homes, friends, and the family."}
{"text":"We've ordered delivery from this place two nights in a row. It's that good!

I was just excited to find a Thai restaurant that delivered in our area, but I wasn't expecting everything to be so delicious!

The first night we ordered the green curry and combination appetizer plate. Their chicken satay is the best I've ever had, and the curry was on par with some of the best curry I've had over the years. The next night we ordered basil fried rice with shrimp, glass noodle soup, and golden cups (kratong tong). Again, everything was amazing!"}
{"text":"Mangoes are in season...right?!

The moment they are, my boyfriend & I immediately think of Naga's mango & sticky rice dessert. If you haven't tried it, you aren't missing much. That's a lie, you'll be missing the focal point of this whole review! Don't read any more till you've tried it. Wait. Finish reading, then head over there. You need to know what to have before dessert.

What have we tried? A little bit of everything...

Salad Rolls
Chicken Satay
Crab Rangoons (fresh crab)
Moo Ping w/ Sticky Rice
Tom Yum soup
Papaya Salad
Catfish Dynamite
Lemongrass Chicken
Pad Thai
Evil Jungle Noodles
Thai Fried Rice
Yellow Curry
Basil Stir-Fry
Pra Ram

And of course... Mango & Sticky Rice for dessert. Yes, you say you've had it at many Thai restaurants. Naga does an AMAZING job, as they do with all their dishes. We've never sent anything back, their food presentation is gorgeous, and so tasty. A special note about their peanut sauce, try it. You won't regret it...

Located in a strip mall off W Horizon Ridge Pkwy & W Horizon Dr close to the 95, there's lots of eateries close by. 

They offer lunch specials Tuesday-Saturday from $7.75, served with house salad and soup. You ever thought corn soup made at a Thai place would be delicious? It is, and I'm not even a soup person!

We've eaten there numerous times (as you can tell by my long list of food I've tried) and called in phone orders to-go. The staff is VERY friendly! At one lunch w/ Terri R, they were willing to place an order to arrive promptly as she sat down, so we didn't have to waste her short lunch hour ordering and waiting.

I have noticed is at times, the food does take a bit long to come out. Usually, I'd deduct a star for this, as I'm one to get very grouchy waiting for food when I'm hungry. However, the quality of food I taste and the good service otherwise makes me forgive the wait. Let's just say it's a 4.5 rounded up to 5 stars. I still always look forward to my next visit.

P.S. Their spice level is 1-4, interestingly. I don't know why, and I always forget to ask. They're also very vegetarian-friendly!"}
{"text":"wow I think I just had my first real thai meal.  The Miang Khum appetizer was out of this world.  8 or so different toppings you roll into a spinach leaf.  The Larb was nice and flavorful.

Minus 0.5 star because our waiter disappeared but the bus boy took care of us.  But 0.5 star added back because my wife did not like her wine by the glass the manager took it off the tab.

also the tray of different levels of hot spices was  a great introduction to the heat level,  go one up when you order your meal"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and service. I can easily recommend the Rama with tofu. Tofu was perfectly crispy and the peanut sauce was awesoooome! If you like Thai, you'll like this place. 2 thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Chicken Satay was dry and un-edible, house salad was old and dry, Rama shrimp , slop that I could not eat. Green curry was weak and watery hardly any chicken. 

This place was expensive and not worth it. Half of the food went into a doggie bag. My dogs were the only ones that seemed to like it."}
{"text":"We have been looking for a good, local Thai restaurant and we think we've finally found one. Plates are around $10-$12 each. The food is fantastic and the decor is very nice."}
{"text":"Uh.....one question.

What the hell happened to Naga?

It's been a late night work and personal wise for my family and I, and we had not come up with a dinner idea. Needless to say, at 845, I did not feel like starting to cook dinner.

I looked on their website, and they stated that they do their last seating at 930. Perfect, we will arrive there before that.

We walk in, and there are four other parties dining. It does take one girl a considerable amount of time to even notice us come through the door...which is pretty interesting to me, because when the door is opened, you hear all the traffic and noise from the yogurt place next door. We almost considered seating ourselves.

The girl (that we have never seen before) hands us our menus and walks away. Doesn't offer us water.... silverware, or even a napkin. We are approached by a different girl (also one that we have never seen before) she takes our drink order. 

My guy ordered a beer, and I ordered a soda. She comes back with the soda (that's flat) and informs us that they are out of beer. We ask for water and extra ice. Only one water comes, so, I guess I'll just suck on these ice cubes.

We order, and she asks how we want it \"put in\". I couldn't even understand her...she was mumbling something about food speed. My guy just said, what ever is quicker. We had asked for just one bowl of their chili sauce to go with their crunchies that they serve... I mean, the four little spaces on the combined plate is cute, but you can't accomplish scooping any up.

Well, we wait over fifteen minutes for water, refills, and crunchies. No one comes by to check on us, they are in their own little world. The other party still dining actually had to walk up to their counter, with their glass, and physically ask for a refill..... I mean, seriously? My guy wanted to get up and walk out....why Pay to be ignored...? I convinced him to stay.

Our food, appetizer, came out. But we still didn't have any silverware, or napkins. I guess my guy was supposed to eat his curry with his hands..

We re ask for water, and our crunchies with sauce. We ask the original girl who seated us if we could have silverware and napkins. She said sure......she never brought us any.

Our \"waitress\" did end up bringing us 2 forks, and 2 napkins. The paper ones, that is. I looked around and saw that other tables had black cloth napkins (used). So, we got one paper napkin for the two of us and our baby. Gee thanks, but I wipe my buns with more paper than this....(sorry if that's TMI).

The food, was good. I've had better at Naga personally..... I've been able to clear my plate before...and this time I left about half. Something was missing. 

I was too tired and it was getting too late to even ask for a manager. Our daughter had been good the entire meal time, up until the check came. I just knew that it was in my family's best interest to fill out their little opinion card, and be on our way.

The girl who sat us was bringing in their chalkboard sign when we were leaving.
Did she say \"goodbye\" or \"thanks\" or even a \"go to hell\".... Nope, not a single word.

 This staff was so rude, clueless and they should be trained."}
{"text":"The kitchen is a little slow BUT the wait is worth it.  I love the Rama noodles and the lemonade is amazing!!"}
{"text":"My husband placed a to-go order in the restaurant. Was told it would be a 10 minute wait. 
He waited 45 before approaching the person he ordered from and the guy forgot that he was there waiting and grabbed the food that had been ready and sitting for quite some time. (All we ordered was Yellow Curry and Tom Yum Soup). We had to microwave the food at home because it had been sitting for so long. 

What happened to this place?!"}
{"text":"It's hard to find a decent Thai restaurant in Henderson.  Like, it's really hard.  Everywhere I'd tried in the area either smelled funny or looked like the den of some kind of seedy crime syndicate out of a Hollywood action flick.

So I couldn't have been more happy when I found this place.  Very nice owner and servers, great food, and best of all it has a great atmosphere.  The interior design is really impressive for a small strip establishment. 

The Panang curry is some of the best I've had in town.  The catfish dynamite is a delicious piece of fried/marinated catfish that's just that - dynamite.  And the complimentary crackers and unique dipping sauce are just enough to take it to the next level.

For any location, but especially this far out in Henderson, Naga Thai dining delivers."}
{"text":"A co-worker and I went here for lunch today. I have big props for this place, but also a couple of things leaving them off the 5 star list for me. 

The cons were really nothing terribly major - we were on a lunch break, so we were in a hurry - NOT a place I would suggest risking on an hour lunch without calling ahead to find out if they are busy (or possibly even placing your order so it might be ready when you arrive). This is the ONLY con I can really harp on much. 

We were seated right away, with 3 other groups/tables already seated as well. Our drink order was taken right away and the drinks brought out shortly after. 

My co-worker ordered the Thai Iced Tea, then had a mini heart attack to see the price (I believe it was something like $3 or $4. Soda is $2.50 (with free refills). After tasting her drink, she felt better about paying the price, apparently really good. 

I had just water, and had already made it through a full glass and a half before our food made it out (and I was making sure to take it slow). Our food arrived more than 30 minutes later, giving us only about 10 minutes to eat. We asked for the check as soon as our food hit the table (to try and save time). 

She ordered the chicken pad thai, spicy level 2 (out of 4). I ordered the yellow curry with chicken (spicy level 3 out of 4). We both got lunch specials, which came with soup and salad. The salad had either peanut dressing or ginger dressing. We both opted for ginger and were both happy. There's some acidity to the dressing, but it is no overpowering at all. It complimented the soup very well, which I believe was a chicken based vegetable and broth soup. It was a very cozy soup that hit the spot just right after the salad. There was also a serving of wonton strips to have with the soup (my favorite, and honestly, not enough places offer this). I like a little crunch in my soup. You could also see that they used the same riveted clicer to cut the wonton skins before frying them, as they had the decorative edges, a nice touch I'm sure more people won't notice. You could tell everything was made fresh.  

Our entrees finally arrived and they were beautiful! The use very decorative dishes here and make sure to serve the food in a great arrangement. I will post some photos later (sorry, they're cell phone quality). 

The curry was nice and hot (temperature), but I could have used more spice. I felt like they maybe softened it up a little because I am not full Asian. (Many places do this - make things hotter for Asians even if you order the same spice level). I would have liked more bite to it. The chicken pad Thai was also good (and also not spicy) as we both tried each other's dishes. 

The decor is very nice and fresh - contemporary style that made you feel at home and cozy. They have a small seating area, so hopefully they can keep up with demand if word continues to spread about them. There is a water fixture on the wall to the left as you enter, soothing for the lucky couple to gets to eat at the table next to it. My co-worker fell in love with the overhead fans. There were nice reflective decorations, but nothing was overdone. 

I even went to check out the bathroom specifically for my yelp review. The bathroom is a single occupancy and very clean and cared for. There is a lovely diffuser next to the sink to keep things fresh but not overpowering. The decoration is well done and if I actually had to use the restroom, I would have felt very comfortable doing so. Oh, and the bathrooms are down a hallway separated from the main area with a beaded curtain. There's a small sticker-like head (male and female) above the entry instead of the usual blatant \"restroom\" sign. 

Overall, I really enjoyed this place and would definitely go back. I might just call ahead though, to make sure I have enough time to REALLY enjoy my food. 

The staff was all very nice and prompt with refills, etc. I think they just got hit with a late lunch rush (we were there around 1PM), and they didn't have enough people in the kitchen (I think there's only 1 cook). There were probably about a dozen of us there, and from the looks of it, we all arrived around the same time. Which makes the delay in food more acceptable, I just wish I didn't feel like I had to scarf it down. 

Oh, and lunch specials are $7.50, many dinner items looked to be about $11, and some of the more extravagant meals were between $14 - $19. The portion sizes are appropriate to their prices, though - from what I could tell from the meals around us. 

They open at 11 on the weekdays, I didn't take the time to catch the rest. You can check them out online, though at nagathaidining.com"}
{"text":"Lunch special is a good price for the portion. I have been here twice. Food is awesome. It's a modern/yuppie atmosphere, but good food. I had the chicken Rama this time. I now have a new favorite. 8.25$ for lunch specials"}
{"text":"This is a great little Thai place. I personally enjoyed the food here. Whenever I'm craving Thai food, Naga hits the spot. It is a small restaurant but it makes for a comfortable ambiance and is nicely decorated. We always start with the chicken tom yum soup before our meal. It is SO good!"}
{"text":"Initial impression when I first walked in,  was like boarding a Virgin America flight. 

Very chill and laid back vibe with cool lounge style setting, lighting and equally cool music playing. A perfect place for a date night. 

Great service. 

Ice cold Singha!

Delicious pad thai. 

Good times in bloody hot (but it's a dry heat) Henderson!"}
{"text":"Naga is a place that I probably would not have eaten, simply because it is so far from me. I happened to be in the area, so I stopped in to grab some food to go.

It was a Tuesday night, and they were not busy at all. I was promptly greeted and given a menu. I decided to get the shrimp pad thai and an order of cream cheese wontons. I also added 2 sides of peanut sauce ($1.25). I looove me some peanut sauce and Naga's is gooood. It was served warm too, even better. I usually drizzle it over my pad thai, and I really love the extra flavor addition. If you haven't tried this, do it now. 

While I sat and waited, I was given a glass of water which I thought was nice. It only took about 10 minutes and then my food was done. I got into my car and was about to leave, but I figured I should check my order and I am glad that I did because I was only given 1 side of peanut sauce when I paid for 2. I went right back in and the same guy who helped me, the same one who gave me water, and the one I was sitting in front of for some time, looked at me and said \"are you here for pickup?\" LOL. It was kind of funny. I was JUST there. I told him he shorted me the sauce and he apologized and got me another. No big deal. I would have hated to have gotten home and not had my extra sauce though. 

So the food was good, I ordered it mild, (1 on a scale of 1-4) but I could have probably ordered a 2. The meal had lots of plump, juicy prawns and I really enjoyed the cream cheese wontons. They came with a sweet dipping sauce. Those are little bites of heaven if you ask me. I don't live anywhere near this place, but I would recommend it to others who were in the area looking for good Thai food, or to take a date."}
{"text":"Food is still absolutely delicious and I'm so happy to report that their service has improved amazingly. I've brought a couple people to lunch with me here and they are always impressed with the food . They are prompt with their service and always have smile!"}
{"text":"I've been here a total of 3 times. It's literally right down the street from my house, so I come here more so out of convenience. 
I think it's just a tad too pricey. 
It would be understandable if the food was amazing but it is actually quite average, the service is just okay, but the decor and restaurant itself is very trendy/modern. They did a beautiful job decorating. That's the best thing I can say about the restaurant, otherwise, nothing really exceeds expectations."}
{"text":"This will be my last time dining at Naga. I was craving Thai food and though Komol is my go-to, Naga is much closer. However, the service lacks and the food is meh..
Today I was dining solo and so the waitress gave me a dirty look while she tended to other tables w more people seated..I would gladly tip well and has she seen how much I eat?? But, she shunned me for being a one person table and she laaaaaged with everything the entire time I was there. I had to ask for chopsticks twice, had to ask for my drink refilled 3 times before they finally did it. And dressing for my salad took ten minutes. They weren't that busy. And there was another server. This has been my experience the past few times but today I gave  it a last go for goodness sake ..and they failed. 
So, komol, I love you and I'll never stray again!"}
{"text":"With my mom no longer being able to cook (She's a 100 star) and this being my first visit since that sad fact. I began in earnest to find places make yum yum for the tum tum as in Thai Basil Fried Rice w/chicken no veggie extra spicy.

My first attempt for Thai turned into a great find, Naga!!! It was quiet, staff was very friendly and the spice was nice!

they have four levels if spice with special names or 1 - 4, 4 being really spicy, it had the name 'angry something' and though I have had it spicier, Naga had a spice I really enjoyed.

The lovely bride was not with me but I was told they have non spicy aka boringgg items on the menu for her sensitive innards. The location is close to my mom's new digs so Naga Thai dining will be a return visit."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I eat Thai food a lot so we feel we know what good Thai food tastes like and this place rocks. We ordered the Thai iced coffee, salad rolls, fried spring rolls, basil chicken and chicken pat woon sen.  The ambiance of the place was very cute and the waitress turned out to be the owner, and she was lovely.  We had a great experience and highly recommend this little gem in the desert. Thank you!"}
{"text":"This place is in a little plaza that you could miss easily. 

Came here for lunch at noon on a Tuesday. It was busy with a few open tables. Took a minute to get seated and waited 10 minutes to even get a server's attention to take my order. Ordered the lunch special green curry and thai coffee.

Green Curry
5 stars. The lunch special came with fried wonton strips, salad (your choice of peanut or ginger dressing), and a creamy soup. The green curry was creamy, flavorful, and abundant with thai spices and chicken. 

Thai Coffee
5 stars! Much much better than Archie's

Pro
Clean and beautiful restaurant 
Food (5 Stars!)
Plenty of protein in the lunch special, not skimpy like other places
Thai coffee

Con
Service was awful!
Brown rice is an additional cost

I was slightly hoping the food was bad so I wouldn't want to come back because the service was beyond terrible, but the food was sooo good! They need to hire more servers.

Get to-go if you have time constraints for lunch. Expect sit down lunch to take at least an hour."}
{"text":"Wow. Such a nice place with great food in an unexpected place. 
Thanks to the yelpers we found it and enjoyed a lovely dinner. 
The food is very authentic and the spices are added to the diner's personal preference."}
{"text":"We went for dinner on a Tuesday night at around 6:50pm. They were nearly full, but luckily we were able to be seated right away.

Service was friendly and fairly prompt. We were given some wonton crisps and gave our order of chicken rama noodles and black pepper tofu.

This is where things go awry. Yes, they were busy, so I expected a bit of wait, but not an HOUR wait for two dishes. And when we were done with our wonton crisps, instead of giving us some more to chew on while we waited for our meals, the server just took it away. If you're running slow, you give your customers something to chew on.

So, our entrees eventually came. The black pepper tofu was good, but we only got about half of a bowl of rice to go with it. The sauce and rama noodles tasted good, but the chicken was dry and chewy. The sauce helped cover up the subpar chicken.

Overall some good flavors, but faulty details made it underwhelming. The entire experience felt stingy and slow."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today and it was ok. Food is amazing as always, but the service was not softest. There were only 2 of us in the whole place and it took so long to get silver wear. I couldn't understand it. I was very disappointed because I have never had a bad experience here, but I have never been there for lunch. So sad. I'll stick with dinner there."}
{"text":"Still love the food here. Can't miss on the lunch special. Husband loves shrimp fried rice, I still go for chicken Pad Thai. Corn soup and salad and crispies are yum."}
{"text":"Naga is ok. Actually the food was good. But, you dont get what you pay for. There are other Thai places with just as good food or even better that give you more of it for your money. Plus, the seating is ridiculously close together. I felt like strangers were sitting right at my table."}
{"text":"Just had to add a 5-star review for this place. The food, ambiance & service are all top notch. Love the retro 60s design. Drunken noodles and Pad Thai were great, green curry was good (not a favorite though) and the mango & sticky rice dessert was perfect!"}
{"text":"This was our first visit to Naga.  The food was incredible and service top notch.  We had the Lemongrass Chicken, the Pad Thai and the Crab Fried Rice.  Everything was excellent and the spices customized to our desires. We will definitely come here again when we are in the area."}
{"text":"My new favorite Thai place I found in Henderson, so happy I tried them out. Service was great! The waitress was able to give me recommendations and substitute dishes to accommodate my shrimp allergy. The food was is so flavorful and tasting! It's a jewel hidden in this shopping center."}
{"text":"Hidden treasure! We found this place by mere accident and so glad we did.....wonderful, wonderful, wonderful! There was a small wait because we didn't know we needed reservations so FYI....ca ahead. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant so much! The food is delicious and they are aware of what gluten is ... so I can trust that they are preparing food I can eat safely! If you are vegan, they are familiar with this and vegetarian cooking as well. The ambience is very cool and chill. The staff and chefs are friendly and talented. Not sure I could ask for more, honestly!"}
{"text":"Ordered the yellow curry and it tasted pretty good , I asked for medium on the spice level and it wasn't quite there but it did have a tad bit spice to it but overall it was good . The Thai tea boba is one of the best I've had by far , they don't over fill the cup with ice which is good but I will be coming back ."}
{"text":"I'm really thankful for having this great Thai restaurant near my home in the Mission Hills neighborhood. The quality of the good is excellent and the preparation speed of take-out orders is amazing. The only reason that I didn't give it 5 stars is the hit-and-miss service when dining in; my wife and I were literally forgotten about one evening as person after person came and went with their take-out orders. Regardless, I'm still a patron and highly recommend the Pad Thai (make sure to request the peanut sauce with it), Evil Jungle Noodles, and Panang Curry. We're vegan and this restaurant does an excellent job at catering to our dietary choices."}
{"text":"Some of the best Tom Yum we've ever had. Also had the Rad Na noodles with seafood--delicious! Excellent friendly service with water glasses never going empty."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Southeast Asian cooking, and this is probably the closest you can get to authentic Thai for its price. 

Best to try: Tom Yum, Lemongrass Chicken, and (the best) Pad Thai. This is perfect for 2-3 persons.

One Con: They say the close at 9, but they tend to close earlier. It's best to eat earlier than 8:30 here. I might be part of their culture to close shop early."}
{"text":"Finally Henderson has a Thai restaurant close to  our house! The decor is trendy and there were enough options for me and my family's vegetarian tastes. My only recommendation is that they soak their boba in the green tea drink for longer since it was a little hard but I haven't returned since I mentioned this on their feedback form so I'm sure their boba is now on par with the rest of the delicious food!"}
{"text":"My absolute favorite Thai restaurant. The food is incredible, sauces are to die for. Decor is modern and upscale, but prices are incredibly good. My favorite dish is Rama noodles- just can't get enough"}
{"text":"Loved the ambiance. Friendly staff. I'm not huge on Thai food but I had the Pad Thai with chicken at I think a medium level of spicy. It was good and I had some left over to take home."}
{"text":"BEST. THAI. FOOD. EVER. Service was exceptional, and the food is delicious! Love it!(:"}
{"text":"Excellent  authentic food! A bit pricy though. And probably the only thai restaurant that serve roti with ice cream in Henderson! :D"}
{"text":"I love this place!!! The service is great! They're fast. The environment is really cool! The hours are fine. Great location. I love their chicken fried rice!!! The chicken has a great flavor and is nice and moist. The rice and vegetables is an awesome blend which just adds to the taste!!! I get excited to grab some take out after work, because I also know I'll have half left over for another meal!! Great portions!!! Crab rangoons were also delicious!!! Wonderful spot!! 5 stars!!!"}
{"text":"i loooove thai food and this place is pretty damn good. the staff is very friendly and the atmosphere is nice, kinda trendy! i just had the pork fried rice, but i loved it and i'm kinda picky with my fried rice. would definitely go there again!"}
{"text":"Did a to go order from here as its nearby my house. The gal that took the order was so friendly and sweet. Food came out relatively quick and so very fresh. I love that they cut holes in the boxes to prevent the food from getting soggy. A must try!"}
{"text":"Not Lotus of Siam good-- but close. 

My wife first met the owners at Costco right about the time the restaurant was about to open. They were so nice, that we decided to give the food a try. The food is prepared fresh daily, and is so flavorful. Our favorite is the basil chicken ( ground chicken, onions, basil, peppers, and spices). They have a variety of chile sauces to choose from to add to any dish you select. Prices are moderate, and portions are substantial. Bottom line, NAGA is a nice option in Henderson for authentic Thai food......"}
{"text":"The Shrimp Pad Thai was great serving size for the take out was smaller than expected! Thus the 4 stars!! I will definitely be back because I want to try the Yellow Curry next!!"}
{"text":"I frequent the Yogart Bar next door and kept wanting to try this place out. When I read Greg's review I decided I needed to give this place a try.

1.The restaurant is very modern and has a sexy ambience. The chairs were very comfortable, made a big booty girl very happy. I think this is a good date night spot.
 
2. The service was great. VERY friendly. Even if I could barely understand my waitress I'm sure she was saying nice things in her broken English. She had a big happy face kinda like this :-D

3. The restaurant was clean which is always important to me since I dine out with my kids.

4. The food:
Chicken Tom Yum Soup- I ordered the regular which was on the smaller side. It would be perfect for a regular size guy with a skinny girlfriend to share. The soup was pretty standard. 5 1/2 out of 10

Naga Beef salad- steak was cooked a bit tough but flavored good. Salad was pretty it had fresh vegetables. Nothing wilted. 5 out of 10

Pad Kee Mao aka Drunken Noodles- I only tried it cause Greg said it was good. It had very little flat noodles. I wasn't crazy about it, actually a little disappointed. I was wanting to have total foodgasam. Nope I was let down.  4 1/2 out of 10

Yellow Chicken Curry- I love yellow curry and order it everytime I have Thai food. The chicken was tender, potato, and carrots cooked just right. I was a happy girl. I took most of it home for later. Several hours later it was just as good. I felt my belly smile. 8 1/2 out of 10

Don't get me wrong this place isn't bad, I just had better. I think you should give it a try. I'd probably come back again one of these day but it won't be soon."}
{"text":"I get carry out from here all the time. Simply the best!!!  Evil Jungle Noodles are sooo good!!"}
{"text":"Tried this place last night. Wow so so good . Got the pineapple curry and  the evil noddles  wow awesome never have had better food mango sticky rice  is great . I have a new favorite restaurate"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere and food! Service is always great! Curry is delicious and ginger  dressing is yummy!"}
{"text":"What a good restaurant. Thai food was great. I got the Sweet sour chicken with the extra vegetables I loved the flavors. Jim got the basil stir fry chicken and of course he added all that hot stuff!"}
{"text":"Delicious Moo Ping - the sauce is perfect.   Service impeccable & prices quite reasonable.  Love it!"}
{"text":"It took me multiple times dining here to decide how to judge this place. However I keep returning, and the kids liked it, so 4 stars it is! Especially considering Henderson lacks good Thai food. Location is probably quite the drive for many, but the people in the area appreciate it I promise. 
A few of the items I have tried are: lemongrass chicken, crab fried rice, drunken noodles, dynamite catfish, basil fried rice, and the shrimp in a blanket. 
FAVORITES. Lemongrass chicken, my 13 year old daughter and boyfriend enjoyed this. It comes a peanut sauce. Drunken noodles, classic favorite done well here. Shrimp in a blanket, bomb appetizer of large shrimp wrapped up in a wonton a deep fried. 
The only dish I DID NOT like was the crab fried rice. It was fishy, and salty like from an unclean crab, salt. I don't know what it was. Maybe a bad batch or a bad crab. But I won't order that again! 
Service is decent. Above average for Thai food. Prices are good to slightly high. However, if you dine for lunch, or only want noodles, you can keep it cheap. 
Oh yeah one last thing. On my most recent visit, I was given somewhat of a sauce definition tour. We were able to sample four sauces from mild to spicy. They had nicknames like sleepy, angry etc. I enjoyed all four, and wish that happened to me every visit."}
{"text":"This is my favourite Thai place in all of the Vegas valley. I personally love the Pad Thai and their salad with peanut dressing and corn chowder soup or heavenly. I've also tried several of the other dishes and they are all excellent. Lunch specials are awesome and a great deal. Ambience is nice and staff is great!"}
{"text":"NAGA is a new trendy Thai restaurant on the other side of the world from me.  The restaurant, just like the neighborhood, is beautiful.  Young waitresses are polite and native English speakers.  The atmosphere screams of The District and good date material.  But how's the food?  I got my first clue when I had to flag my waitress down and ask how spicy my food would be after realizing she never asked!  

I ordered the Crab Rangoon ($8.50) and one of the house specials, the  Seafood Curry Coconut ($21).  Lunch specials are $8.50, which isn't a bad price, but I like to try the dishes that Thai restaurants are proud of.  

The Crab Rangoon were small and wrapped with a very thin pastry.  I usually dislike Crab Rangoon when it is prepared this way, but these had a nice crab flavor.  I believe they used real crab.  With only 6 small pieces, don't expect to fill up on these.  

The main course was the Seafood Curry Coconut.  Served inside of a hallowed out coconut shell, this curry came with mussels, squid, fish (catfish?), shrimp, etc.  The curry itself was interesting.  I expected a Northern style curry, but this was something different than I have ever had before.  It was a thick almost chunky paste.  The flavor was very creamy.  Thankfully I ordered my food spicy hot, as I think this curry would have been a little boring without it.  That said, the curry was very well done for what they were going for.  It lacked the complex Thai flavors that I am used to, so I guess they are going for a more Americanized Thai food.  For that, they've done well, but I got a little bored of eating this curry towards the end.  The squid was a little chewy for me, but other than that the preparation was very well done.  

While not my style of Thai food, I can appreciate their culinary efforts here.  The food matches the neighborhood and their non-Thai clientele.  I would stick to the lunch specials though, as I don't think that the dish I had was worth the price."}
{"text":"Went there for my birthday dinner. I had the pineapple curry, my husband had beef stir fry with veggies and cashews. The food was amazing and very fresh. Took them a little but it was worth waiting for. Very generous serving!  The waitress was very nice but left a big spill of sauce on our table and when asked for a towel or napkin to even clean it up ourselves she pointed at the fresh napkin next to me. That really ruined it for us. Would we go back?  Absolutely!  But with a different server please! Food: 4 stars, service: 2 stars."}
{"text":"Outstanding Thai restaurant.

NAGA has a very interesting and comfortable space (the seats are great), although I'm not a fan of banquette seating which dominates one side of the restaurant.  We sat at a two-top near the front.

Salad roll appetizer rocked. I've never had anything quite like them. Very fresh ingredients and a tasty sauce. Catfish Dynamite and NAGA salad with tofu entrees were equally good. The salad in particular was nicely spicey, as requested.

We were just passing through, but we do that every year, so we may be back."}
{"text":"This use to be amazing when Ink was there... Now the service and food is sub-par to say the least... Service was terrible!"}
{"text":"I have been here several times and I have never been disappointed.  The service is friendly and excellent.  It is immaculately clean.  The food has always been terrific.   They have great lunch specials. I am partial to the Thai Teas and currys.   It's Henderson's little Thai jewel."}
{"text":"Whenever we are in Las Vegas we have to come here to eat. Their food is delicious and their mango sticky rice is a great closure to a great meal."}
{"text":"Great food! Always quick and polite! Two favorites would be the vegan fried rice and Pad Thai!!"}
{"text":"Very bad service. We waited over an hour for our cold food. Water refills took 35 minutes. It took 30 minutes to get a pepsi. I understand I'm a vegetarian and I might be picky. I didn't like the tofu or my dish \"veggie stir-fry\". Even though I only ate 1 tofu and 1 broccoli they still charged me for the food. I was never asked why I didn't eat my food. I will never go here again. 3rd time is a charm."}
{"text":"This place is five minutes from my house and I am happy to report that it is a great find!  I will admit I have never been there during any lunch or dinner \"peak hours\" so I can not speak to the wait or service timing when it is busy.  I have gotten two or three different entrees and everything has been very good.  We had to wait longer than I expected for our entrees the first time we visited, but the food was quick to come out the second visit.  New place, I'll let the first one slide.  I would recomment the appetizer sampler, from my limitied memory it includes: egg rolls, crab rangoons, chicken satay, cucumber salad, and I think one other thing.  When my wife and I go in we usually split the sampler and one entree and it is the perfect amount of food.  The regular menu price is a little high for a quick lunch, but a good selection of lunch specials come to the rescue including many of their popular dishes like currys and pad thai.  Overall, great little restaurant with friendly staff that I hope sticks around for a long time."}
{"text":"My husband And I come here a few times a year when I want a night without the kids, and want to feel just a little fancy without going too far or paying too much. On top of the intangibles, the food is really delicious. It's a small piece place with great low light and an upscale modern vibe. Someone actually designed the room rather than jut plunked down some tables. Great date spot, even though it's essentially in a strip mall. Everyone raves about the food, but I like the curry so much I've never had another dish! Go for sure. You won't be sorry."}
{"text":"Been going to Naga for a few years.  Always good food and friendly staff.  Take out is easy and quick and their lunch menu is super nice.  Decor is quiet and pleasant.  Would definitely recommend to friends and will keep coming here!"}
{"text":"Great for dining in and take out! A heavily reliable source for delicious Thai food. My go to meals are the Pad Prik King with chicken, and the Panang Curry. I enjoy their level of spice with out the overkill of the dish."}
{"text":"Food was mediocre and overpriced. Service was slow. It's a pretty restaurant, but that's about it."}
{"text":"Came across this restaurant from Yelp, and I was not disappointed. Great curry, nice modern decor, and really nice staff."}
{"text":"I wanted so badly to give this place 5 stars but it's for sure a sold 4. I went here on a pretty busy Friday night. The dining area is small with maybe only about 10 tables and 4 or 5 table/booth combos. It makes for an intimate dining experience, which was a plus. The lighting was dimmed and the decor was nice-clean lines and simple colors. 

Although it was almost full, we were seated almost immediately. We had one of the tables that was literally smack dab right in the center of the restaurant. It almost made us feel like zoo animals but whatever-the absence of waiting for a table was worth it. We were greeted right away by a kind but super busy guy who quickly took our drink order. Another person showed us the menu which was pretty predictable-all the usual Thai fare. 

My friend and I ordered the crab Rangoon appetizer and were very impressed. It was a generous portion of a perfect ratio of cream cheese to crab - which, by the way, was real-no imitation garbage that a lot of restaurants use. They were fried (sinful, I know) but weren't greasy or heavy at all. 

We both had the panang curry for dinner. I was so optimistic after the awesome appetizer but it left me pretty underwhelmed. I consider myself (maybe I'm wrong) pretty knowledgable about Thai food, specifically panang curry. This was the strangest I've ever had. First off, there was broccoli in it. I love broccoli but it just seemed off and the fact that it wasn't thoroughly cooked was even weirder. What really caught me off guard was that there were no bamboo shoots in it! Huh? That's almost my favorite part! I asked for them and was disappointed when I saw a $2 charge for them on my bill. That seemed excessive for an item that's normally in this dish at every other Thai restaurant I've ever been to. We got it 2 stars out of 4 and the spiciness was perfect. The portion was huge but we for sure needed more rice. 

Here's what the real problem was. The smell. Yep, the whole place smelled like there was a serious sewage issue. It was almost overwhelming and when we first walked in it was so bad that we almost didn't stay. I'm not sure if it's an issue in the entire area or just this restaurant but it was really, really bad. I'm pretty sure we became \"nose blind\" to it after a while but it was just so awful that if I come back and smell it again, I'm afraid I won't be able to stay. 

Bottom line it's a good little spot-close to home, intimate, priced fair (other than the bamboo shoots!) and the service is good. Support small business and give it a try!"}
{"text":"So Awesome!

I'm torn... I don't want to review them because I want to keep this gem as much a secret as possible.  :)

So... went here for dinner last Saturday evening.   
Arrived a little after 6pm and it was pretty empty inside.
(Note: They are a small establishment.  I think they have a dozen tables and can probably sit about 40 or so.)
By 6:45pm, the place was almost completely full.
So, my recommendation is go early like we did or order take out.

The service was prompt and friendly.

Upon sitting you get some won ton chips to munch on along with a sweet, hot dipping sauce.

We ordered a Regular Sized Tom Yum (chicken) soup.  It was a good size for the 2 of us.  3 people could have easily shared it since between the 2 of us we each had about 3 helpings of it.  Great Soup!!  Wonderful flavor and light with a bit of heat. It had chicken of course, but also mushrooms, onions and tomatoes in it.  

I had the Green Curry with chicken and the hubby had the Seafood Curry.
My Green Curry was delicate yet rich and full of flavor.  I'd further describe it as elegant (in terms of flavor). It wasn't oily nor was it heavy like it is at some other Thai places.
The hubby's Seafood Curry (one of their specialties) was a coconut filled with lots of seafood... mussels, shrimp, squid and fish.  His curry was thicker and seemed to have a touch of heat and sweetness to it where my Green Curry was more earthy.

Anyways... we will totally be back.

Note: they are closed on Mondays."}
{"text":"I was at the frozen yogurt place next door when I was leaving I noticed the restaurant. It had a romantic feel to it with the lighting and decor is what caught my eye.  My husband and I ordered the lemongrass chicken. It was amazing it had the right amount of everything. The rice was even served heart shaped. Great place. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"The restaurant is small and clean and the food is good, but somehow the service always falls short. They staff is friendly and consistently conscientious of vegan and vegetarian orders. Takeout orders are always at least an hour, if not more. Don't even think about delivery. We have a theory that they only have one wok to prepare meals and that's why the wait is so long. We keep hoping the management gets it figured out but it's been years. It is the best Thai in the area and we enjoy eating it."}
{"text":"My favorite Thai restaurant in Henderson. Lots of vegan options and knowledgable staff. 

The panang curry and pad thai are especially amazing, although I've never had a bad meal. They do spicy level 1-4 so be careful! 

Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I found this Thai restaurant last summer.  My husband and I have eaten here  (lunch) many times and are never disappointed.  Wonderful food, nice ambiance, and great service.  There are only twelve tables.  It is quiet, comfortable, and very clean.  My favorite dish is Pad Kee Mao (aka, Drunken Noodles), and my husband enjoys the curry dishes? I would definately recommend to anyone who enjoys Thai Food."}
{"text":"Love it. The service is good and the food is great. If you don't want to wait very long, go for lunch. There is a reason this place is packed at night. It's great! The end."}
{"text":"Awesome everything here. Great food and service. Its way out of my way living in summerlin but i will definitely be making the trip back. Server Alexis was extreamly helpful and fun."}
{"text":"To date the best Thai food I've had!  Delicious curries and the catfish dynamite is well ....dynamite!  Presented in a very artsy way.  Looks as good as it tastes!  The dinners come with a side of white or brown rice in a heart shape. The lunch specials come with salad and soup of the day.  The atmosphere is very romantic and cozy, clean and contemporary.  The service isn't the quickest so do go with time to spend."}
{"text":"Wonderful!

  I love this place.  I would have never tried it on my own, but a friend introduced me to it and I have loved it ever since.  They have a cool decor and great food.  I recommend the Panang Curry and Pad See Ewe.  Both are delicious.  

  They have weird hours with a gap during the afternoon and are closed one day a week I think, but definitely a place worth checking out.  You wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"The service was great, the food was great, and the atmosphere was great.  I can't wait to go back!  I had the Tom Yum soup and Red Curry chicken dinner.  Both were delicious.  I had both at spice level 5 and it was spicy, but not too spicy.  The chicken was all good quality white meat and everything was fantastic."}
{"text":"Great good! Reasonable prices for food portion! The server was helpful in explaining the dishes and what was popular. My Thai tea was great! & mangos with sticky rice was in season so we got that, it was yummy! Cute restaurant & great service! Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"I friggin love NAGA!! I have eaten there as many as 4 times a week for lunch! Would do 7, but I spare my husband's off days to avoid a money smart lecture ;) . Any who! I always order the yellow Curry with beef. Its divine darling! So coco-nutty and deelish! I also have tried the combo pad Thai (up charge for combo meats) Fried rice, Tom Yum Shrimp, as well as the Thom Kai chicken! All of which are WWW dot THABOMB dot com! 

Now the only reason I deducted a star is because they mixed my order up two times now! I sucks to get home to what I thought would be sweet succulent, juicy, and o sooo divine -d literally lol) shrimp, but get ground chicken .. (aaahhhhhhh mannnn) Or, nothing like expecting beef and get chicken chunks (NAGA -2 Joy- goose egg!!) . Hence, I am deducting a star! (witch laugh). 

Lucky you....... the end! 

Go to NAGA !! Its great and everything is delish... just check your order before you leave! :)"}
{"text":"Love it here. Their curry is outstanding, so much so, that I can't bring myself to try anything else. Luckily my husband doesn't have the same issue so I get to taste his. Everything has always been fantastic. It's a really small place, but never busy so we rarely have to wait.  Love the ambiance, quiet, dim lit, and very clean."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, great Basil Chicken!! Very friendly service! Food served quickly & was fresh. I will be returning for sure!! Also tried my husbands Basil fried rice with chicken & it was really good! Give this place a shot, I believe you will really enjoy it!"}
{"text":"Really great food, service, and ambience! Bonus star for the green tea boba and the garlic edamame, both of which were fantastic. We also had the tom kha soup with chicken and the panang curry (both \"level 2\" spicy, which was plenty for us). The curry was fantastic but the tom kha was not my favorite ever (though it has some stiff competitors from my home back east). The restaurant is small with fewer than 20 tables, but it is simultaneously cozy and pretty posh for Henderson. All of the other customers seemed to be really enjoying themselves and it was pleasantly busy without being packed and noisy. My mom is vegan and was really happy to have several options from first glance at the menu. Overall, a very nice dinner and one of my favorite new spots. We will definitely be coming back for more!"}
{"text":"It's possible they were short staffed when I visited. After a short wait to be seated, it was five minutes before they visited our table to bring some fried crisps and four various dipping sauces. I then requested menu's, and our waitress later returned with our menus and drinks. After that we waited for 15 minutes before she returned to take our menu. She and the other staff were hustling, and even on a Thursday night people kept showing up to the almost packed, small restaurant. 

Food began arriving after 22 minutes. The food was good, but I feel was overpriced. Hotness was on a scale from 1-4, and 4 was hot but not nearly as hot as I would have liked. Try the Rama Noodle if you like noodles and peanut sauce.

We were done and waiting for the bill for quite sometime during which I wrote this. Honestly, I probably won't be back. I've had better food, service and prices at other Thai places."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood gem!!! Fabulous food and service. The decor is really nice!!! I highly recommend this restaurant. Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here since it opened and love the ambiance here, celebrated birthdays and other events too.  The food is the best Thai ever! The staff is always friendly too!"}
{"text":"My uncle and I stopped in for an early dinner on a Sunday night. It is a cozy restaurant with a classy decor. Our server, Ink (sp?), was very friendly, patient, attentive and made us feel welcomed.  My uncle was only there once before and she remembered his name, which impressed me.   Drinks came out right away.  They have a large selection of food options,  all of which sound delicious. The food came out faster than I expected,  and it was hot and tasty.  With great service and good food, I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I've always liked the food here, but Naga why advertise you deliver when the last 3 occasions I have called. No delivery is available?"}
{"text":"I'm really impressed. I've driven by this place for 2 years and just finally stopped in. Great friendly staff. Nice clean establishment. The decor is modern and clean. The crab Rangoon was so delicious. The waitress suggested a Thai beer, Singha. I loved it. The crab fried rice had so much crab! Every bite. The flavor of the glass noodle soup was amazing. So going back soon"}
{"text":"LOVE this place! Excellent service and the food is delicious. We started off with the cucumber salad & spring rolls and then shared a noodle dish and a peanut chicken curry dish. Way too much food for 2 people but the leftovers were fab the next day. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Such a cute place! The staff was amazing and super friendly. I got the pad Thai and it was a pretty good portion and super yummy. I'll deff be back!!"}
{"text":"I have been searching for some time for an excellent Thai restaurant near by and this is it! This place is on the smaller side so weekend evenings you may need a reservation. My favorite dish is the Rama noodle. Big Styrofoam like noodles with a peanut sauce and some vegetables. Add chicken and its amazing.

Definitely recommend going for the lunch special as well. For $7.99 you can choose a smaller portioned dish and it comes with soup and salad. 

Dont forget to try the sweet sticky rice with or without mango for dessert.  :)"}
{"text":"Lets describe these dishes from the top. This is an intimate little thai diner that is rather fancy inside and makes real attempts to win over the foodie crowd. The previous review is accurate in my opinion-- this place offers authentic thai seasoning techniques served in an aesthetically pleasing interior representing a westernized flair.

Beef Fried rice-- the fried rice is much better here than you would find at a cheapo generic thai restaurant. It doesn't have that  \"sitting in the fridge\" taste.

Edamame here is tasty and well seasoned. Try not to fill up too much on it.

Lemongrass chicken--  this is one of their specialty dishes and it is well crafted. The chicken is juicy and there are plenty of tasty crunchy vegetables in it. This dish has a pretty unique taste (despite the rather generic sounding name) that you won't get at other Thai restaurants so it is well worth ordering.

Prawn Tom Yum Soup-- this is another one of their signature dishes. The tom yum broth they prepare is excellent, but I could have gone for a bit more prawn cuz I absolutely love the stuff. I've made my own Tom Yum soup before at a cooking school in Thailand and I'm quite familiar with how it should taste. Believe me when I say this place gets it right.

Pad Thai- the pad thai is pretty excellent here as well. Plenty of ground up peanut to accompany the dish, lots of tasty bean sprouts. The peanut based glaze is just sweet enough without being overly sugary, and the portions of meat in it are pretty solid. I still think I had slightly better pad thai at a place slightly closer to the strip but you won't regret ordering this stuff.

I vow to return to this establishment with my girlfriend because it is easily the best you can find on this side of Clark County."}
{"text":"NAGA Thai Dining is like stepping into a spaceship, with bold curves and backlighting elegance. It's both contemporary and intimate. Intimate not only in terms of the dimly lit ambiance, but also that you might accidentally overhear your neighboring table's conversation. Kinda like a double-date, I guess? The more the merrier...

We stopped in for dinner, but as other reviewers have stated, service was pretty slow. It took awhile for waters to come out and we didn't have silverware/napkins until much later. These were a couple setbacks, but the food makes up for it. 

First of all, the chicken in my pad see ew was delicious -- it was barbecued so it was different than what other Thai places serve. They use regular broccoli instead of the traditional Chinese broccoli, but I'm guessing it's to better complement the crinkle cut carrots they have added. 

My bf got his usual chicken yellow curry, which he said he enjoyed. The rice was served in a heart-shape, but it was far too little for the amount of curry. Come on now! We had to order a second one. On a spicy scale of 0 to 4, we both opted for 1 in our respective dishes. It had just the right amount of flavor and kick."}
{"text":"Best Vegan Pad Thai I've ever had! They give you wonton chips with spicy sauce for heat testing which is awesome, we always ask for extras..... :) I love this place, their ambiance is great too!!"}
{"text":"So glad I stumbled upon this place! Ordered crab rangoon and chicken pad see ew, two of my favorite Thai dishes. Restaurant is small, but quick as well. Portions were large-I had plenty to take home with me."}
{"text":"Nice interior decor. Fast service at 7pm... no crowd. Wonton sauce sample is tasty. Tofu Pad Thai is perfect!"}
{"text":"Great food and great customer service. My family and I will defiantly be coming back. Desert amazing too!!"}
{"text":"I had it a second time... just nothing special... it prices itself as high end thai food... it's good... but slightly overpriced... if everything was about 1-3 dollars less on average per dish or the portions for take out were slightly larger... I would probably give them another star... but value has to come into play."}
{"text":"we just happened  was actually going for mexican and decided to try this since none of us (4) have ever tried thai, it was wonderful! I had the red curry,awesome and don't remember the names of what friends ordered but everyone was happy and full. wish I lived in the area cuz this would be a regular."}
{"text":"Grabbing lunch on the way out of Vegas, and was happy to find this place in a strip mall off the interstate.  Lovely soups, good standard Thai in a clean chic atmosphere.  The waitress was efficient and polite.  She added extra salad for the parties who couldn't have the corn chowder due to lactose intolerance."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time but probably wouldn't visit it again...

Ambiance- very intimate and small. The decors are very nice and they definitely care about presentation of the place itself and food.

Pricing- a lot higher than most Thai places. I believe their that tea was $5. The quantity and quality was not worth it in my opinion. I've been to several Thai places and some offers a delicious large one for that price. They are definitely a bit pricey than other places. We ordered a papaya salad and chicken panang curry and our bill came out to about $35.

Food- it wasn't memorable. I felt like they were just another Thai place, nothing special. With the prices they have, I was expecting a bit more. On the bright side, they give you wonton chips and dipping sauce with different spice levels so you can gauge how they spice up your food. 

Service- very friendly! I can't say anything bad about them. They were not one of those serves who keeps bugging and asking \"is everything okay\" like a million times.

Overall, I'd recommend to give it a try. Maybe I didn't order the right items or I've been to too many Thai places (I love Thai food!!) but I definitely wouldn't travel just to get food from here."}
{"text":"I was in the area and decided to get some Thai food to go. Walking in there is no one to greet you as the counter is across the small dining room. There is a very small waiting area with a few seats available.
 After looking over the menu I decided on the Pad Se Ew and I ordered Pad Thai for my wife. my dish had good flavored and I selected a number 2 spice level. It was smoggy to make my lips tingle, but I don't do well with much more heat than that. The noodles were different than I ever had. The were balled up in a log like presentation with the sliced beef on top, over all I enjoyed it.the Pad Thai on the other hand was very good. Lacking some of the expected flavors it was a memorable dish, in the wrong way. I wouldn't order it again. This isn't close to my house and with plenty of excellent Thai options in the valley, I wouldn't go out of my way to come back"}
{"text":"I've been a huge fan for a few months now...Today, I ordered the food for delivery and it was still delicious! The Tom Yum soup and Pad Thai were perfect! The delivery guy showed up about 20 minutes earlier than the time they estimated. I will continue to go back to Naga!"}
{"text":"wow...ive eaten a lot of thai food in my day, but let me tell you that this place was awesome!  Everything I ate here was excellent.  We tried almost everything on the menu.  The crab rangoon, chicken satay, tom yum gai, cucumber salad, papaya salad, Pad Thai, Yellow curry, Basil Chicken, some other noodle dish.  The nice thing is that you can tell them how hot or mild you like it.  They even give you some wonton's with 4 different dipping sauces to snack on when you arrive.  The next time I am out in Vegas, I will definitely go back.  I will also be sending all of my friends here when they visit as well.  If you are in Vegas / Henderson and in the mood for Thai food, please try this place.  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"We just enjoyed another excellent meal at Naga. Everything was fresh and flavorful. The service was pleasant and attentive. The ambience soothing and relaxing, especially because we got to sit next to the hanging water fall. We started off with one of the best  Thai iced  teas in the valley. Then ordered fresh salad rolls and a combination appetizer platter. We followed it all with Tom Ka soup with steamed tofu, brown rice shaped like a heart, and Beef Pad Thai. After all of that, we had no room for dessert, though the Mango Sticky rice was quite tempting!  We are repeat customers, so we will be back! 
Thank you Naga for consistently being perfect."}
{"text":"The food at Naga is the best thai I've had in the valley so far!  The restaurant is small inside but beautifully decorated.  It is sometimes a little too quiet - I think the ambience would benefit from some louder music...so we usually opt for take-out.  My favorite dishes are their panang chicken curry and beef pra ram - but everything is GREAT!  Their fried rice is amazing - and you can add any protein to it for a few dollars more.  One great tip:  You can add extra meat (or chicken) to any dish for just $2 or $3 - worth it every time!  The servers are all very kind and helpful.  We eat at Naga at least once every few weeks.  It's awesome!"}
{"text":"Just moved here from Philly and was so happy to find a great vegetarian option so close to my place! 

They are always super friendly! 

Only Vegetarian tip: make sure you say that you're vegetarian bc sometimes it doesn't state meat on the menu but its topped with a meat product."}
{"text":"Success!!! Found a Thai place I really like.

Ordered 3 dishes:
Rama noodles with chicken: 5 stars--peanut sauce was so good I used the vegetables to scrape it all up. The noodles - and I rarely like noodles - we awesome. Loved them! Ate it all. And for the money...!
Pad pik with beef:  4 stars -- great vegetables. Light sauce. Beef wasn't the best but overall very good. 
Fried rice with crab: 3 stars -- good fries rice but if we ordered it again we would get a different type of meat. Wasn't bad but far from memorable.

Good service. Very reasonable price especially for the quality.

Overall: happy and satisfied and will definitely return!"}
{"text":"I'm so glad to have found this place especially because I live right down the street.  The atmosphere is modern and interesting.  The few times I have been here the staff has been friendly and happy. I have only been for lunch and have only eaten from the lunch specials, so I cannot offer any insight on the rest of the menu.  I have had the sweet and sour stir-fry with chicken which I really enjoyed. I also tried the Rama which is pretty interesting and amazing. It is a soft noodle that is crispy at the same time (hard to describe-just try it) I would recommend both.  You can't go wrong with the lunch special. Soup, salad and entree for $7.75."}
{"text":"Great local Thai restaurant.  Lunch special is a real deal.  Yellow curry chicken is great, could stand to be a little spicer."}
{"text":"Not sure how I missed it in my first review, but they have the best Tom Kha Gai we have ever had! Closer to traditional than some other dishes, and just a perfect balance of sweet/sour/spicy flavors! I could eat just this soup for a meal.

This is a smaller restaurant, so be sure to call ahead for a party larger than 4 people."}
{"text":"Just got home from yet another amazing meal at NAGA. From the crunchy fresh spring rolls, delicious Rama noodles with chicken, perfectly prepared pad thai with sea food, to the very good service, we enjoyed another wonderful meal there. When given a choice of \"where do you want to go for dinner tonight\" Naga is in our top 5."}
{"text":"The food was perfect, really tasty, i had the Pananag chicken (Thai Red Curry), my wife had something different, i forgot what it was called but it was awesome.  The service was polite and friendly, the food could have arrived a little faster but other than that it was great!"}
{"text":"Love the crab stir fry house special & tom ka!"}
{"text":"Visiting in Henderson for family reunion/gambling camp. We all came here for Tuesday lunch. So pleased with the experience all the way around; service, ambience, food.  Rama Noodle was my favorite, also enjoyed green curry with tofu. Would definitely recommend. I had no complaints, and that's a miracle in itself! Wish it wasn't located 225 miles away from home."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in Henderson! We love coming here. Their Lemongrass soup is the best I have ever had and their Pad see ew is delicious. This is a favorite spot for us and we frequent it often. They also can make a ton of dishes vegan which is amazing for me. It is also owned and operated by a small family and they are so very sweet!"}
{"text":"I have brought my family here a handful of times, I really enjoy the ambience and atmosphere. Mother's Day 2016, I brought my wife, daughter, and mother. Like any other time, we enjoyed it, as the food filled us well. I paid the bill, and tipped 15 percent, brought the amount to just short of 100 dollars. I'm trying to express to the curious consumer how we have enjoyed this place. Well, after dinner and dessert, our bill is paid, the owner comes to our table as we're having a conversation, to tell us to leave because they have a party of 9 waiting. I look around, and there are empty tables. I couldn't believe the owner/management's decision, I immediately responded that we won't be coming back. My wife approached the manager, and let him know that his decision was disrespectful and that this is no way to run a business. He responded with 'this restaurant isn't for us, and that we aren't welcomed back.' Laugh out loud! I went back and took off the tip from the bill. There are multiple unfavorable reviews on Google maps and Yelp, so it's a culture and the philosophy of this owner. It is sad and unfortunate, but I'm glad he exposed himself, so I won't contribute my money to this owner's pockets any longer."}
{"text":"Pros: server was very nice and attentive. 
Food came quick. 
Interior is very pretty and classy. Black and orange sophisticated look. 

Cons: food was just OK. Husband ordered the mussels in the sriracha sauce and I got the pad see ew with chicken. Both dishes tasted a little.....dry and stale. Sort of like reheated dishes. We get that you mussels aren't fresh but they tasted microwaved. My dish was very dry and not much flavor. This place has great potential, but the food is seriously lacking right now. 

Would not come back if ever in Vegas again. Food isn't worth it."}
{"text":"This was actually not good at all, but Thai food is Thai food so I'm bumping it a star. 

I was really sick and wanted to eat some majorly spicy food to clear out my sinuses. I ordered my drunken noodles a 4 out of 4, and drove to pick it up. When I took a bite, it was probably a 0 spice level. It not only had no heat, it had no flavor really at all, plus the noodles were in these massive clumps. The portion was small, but it was only a $7 lunch special. 

Thai spice is always a gamble but I was seriously needing the spice this particular day and Naga couldn't deliver. I don't think I will waste my time trying it again."}
{"text":"I had the yellow curry with chicken. I had it level 3 on the spicy scale of 1-4. SO good!!"}
{"text":"I moved to the area something like eight months ago and was without a good Thai place for what felt like forever, until I found Naga that is.

As a vegan it can sometimes be challenging to find a restaurant that can accommodate your dietary needs, but Naga passes every test with flying colors with a plethora of vegan options!

The staff is always friendly and welcoming and the restaurant's interior is clean and modern. I love bringing my friends and family here when they're in town and showing off my favorite spot!"}
{"text":"First the \"negatives\": I can't believe the average rating is only a 4 star! Service can be slow at times but more time to relax and enjoy the meal, company and Singhas! The food is amazing! My wife and I have backpacked throughout Thailand so we had our share of food there . We go to Naga regularly because it is authentic and the best Thai cooking we have ever experienced! We are usually too full to have dessert but can hardly pass on the Mango and sticky rice when in season. See you tonight!"}
{"text":"Living in LA for the past two years and way overdue to update my reviews of our favorite local places. NAGA is and should be the first because somehow I end up here be it a birthday celebration for a friend or an alone getaway for delicious Thai. NAGA is an experience because the food is original and delicious, music unexpected and decor minimalistic. It's cozy & has a menu everyone can find something they'll enjoy in. Nan, the owner/operator is hands on and cares about the food and the service given. We have two favorites on the menu, Evil Jungle Noodles & Pad Pak. The noodles are decadent and in a curry based coconuty broth and we usually have them with chicken. Pad Pak is a delicate gingery sauce with many veggies stir fry best for me with tofu. Many we've brought here love the curries and the Rama noodles so check it out, doubt you'll be disappointed. Takeout is also a great option. Must have Mango with Sticky Rice.
Excellent place for romantic night out, too."}
{"text":"Love this place! If you order for pickup, they make it pretty quick. It's convenient for me to call them from my job in Vegas and to stop by to pick up dinner on my way home to Henderson. Great service too!"}
{"text":"Not for me. The employees were nice, but the food was way too creamy and kind of gross. As in, we were hungry, so we ate a bit and then threw the rest away. I will not be going back. Disappointed that it didn't live up to our expectations."}
{"text":"Service is absolutely terrible, go there to eat if you have a half hour to even order a drink or appetizer and good luck if it even shows up. Their wine list has stuff they don't have any longer, and everything seems very overpriced. The fried wontons and odd plate of varying spicy sweet chili sauce makes no sense at all (they're not even Thai); except maybe to munch on while you're sitting around with your thumb up your ass trying to order.  The restaurant is also so overpriced it's not even funny, and for what? Probably their expensive location. I'm sorry but $16.50 for crab fried rice is ridiculous...I've had it multiple other places and never paid that much. Also, don't waste your time on their \"Thai street food appetizer\" what u get are little tiny portions of various ingredients and 5 leaves of wilted spinach...you're supposed to wrap little tiny spinach leaves to your liking when by the end of finishing it all I wanted to do was wrap my bill up and throw it in my water glass.  Only reason we would ever return is because is convenient... but 70$ for drunken noodles , a beer, and some vegan food is outrageous.  P.s. until recently they used Mexican chilis and chili powder, not a bird chili in sight... hopefully they learn to cool with them soon considering the spice difference... but if you'd like you can enjoy your overly spicy food while sitting in an extremely uncomfortable orange chair while the music skips, trying to flag down your waiter, then overpay and leave disappointed...




Revised in August 2017 - I've changed my order and go with the Rama noodles.. which at first seem weird as they're a block of coagulated noodles stick together in a brick and coated with coconut curry sauce, broccoli, and carrots.. sounds gross, but it's actually awesome , completely changed my mind about this place.  Give it a try, just make sure they're actually using real Thai chilis in your food"}
{"text":"I have only used their take out service, so I cannot review the waitstaff, but they are always very nice when I order and pick up my to go orders.  Make sure you look up their hours before heading over.  I have accidentally tried to order take out on a Monday (closed all day).  They are also closed between the lunch and dinner services.

All the dishes I have tried have been very tasty and the spice level is good, although they do 0-4 instead of 1-5 like some places, so keep that in mind if you are spice intolerant. When you first walk in it seems odd that there is no host stand, but if you are picking up, just go to the register in the back and they will take care of you."}
{"text":"This place was amazing. The food was incredible, the ambiance was great, and the service was wonderful.

I arrived here as one of six people, so seating was a bit tight as it isn't exactly a large establishment. However, it all worked out and, thankfully, the waitresses were on the ball, quickly taking away our used plates and utensils as new things were brought forth.

Their food is wonderful, definitely one of the top three, in my experience, Thai-based restaurants of both Phoenix and the Las Vegas area. I am personally a big fan of their Rama, and their Crab Rangoons are some of the best I've ever had. 

Naga has definitely become a family favorite ours and we look forward to coming back again and again!"}
{"text":"The first time I went to Naga, I thought my wife and I found our new spot for a yummy Thai lunch before heading into work and we did for a couple months. Unfortunately, we will Never be going back to Naga again because of our last visit. I understand that businesses like to close between lunch and dinner to reset and prepare for dinner service especially since I have been in this business over 15 years. But when you drive 20 miles to patronize an establishment and arrive 15 minutes before their closing time for lunch you would expect to be seated and served. This was not the case and to turn your business away at the door with so many options out their I wish you luck."}
{"text":"This is our favorite Thai restaurant. Been going here at least once a month for 1+ years. The food is great. The servers are worked so hard. There is never enough help. Plan to wait forever to get a water. Longer to get your food. The management needs to do a better job"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner last night and the service was a little slow but the servers were very attentive and polite. I had a party of 10 and this place a a little small to begin with so they really had to move seating around for us but did it very quickly and politely. I had the beef pad Thai and it was a huge serving and so delicious. I also ordered the fried rice and the cheese rangoon and I have to say they were the best I have EVER had in my life!!! Definitely recommend this restaurant for Thai food!!! Will be visiting again soon."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh this place has some amazingly good Thai food! They offer a great lunch special (M-Sat) and a very extensive menu. We came in a large group and ordered lots of food and it was all delicious, the curries, the noodles, the rolls... everything was amazing. The Rama Noodles were freakishly good! If you try anything, try the Rama noodles!! 
The location itself is very clean and nice and the staff was incredibly attentive and friendly. This is an amazing little gem tucked away into a random shopping complex, but don't let the low key location fool you!"}
{"text":"Ok. I have never had thai food before but I can tell you that I LOVE peanuts and I LOVE spice. So I was thinking this would be a great combo. I picked up the phone and ordered delivery but the woman taking my order had a very hard time understanding what I was saying. 

Because she had a hard time understanding what I was saying she asked if she could hang up *half way through my order* and then call me right back. I was a little surprised at that but sure...so she called back, it was easier to order. 

I ordered the \"best thai noodles\" and had them deliver it to my house. It took over an hour, and after being 30 minutes over an hour the lady who delivered my food yelled at me for not telling her the access key to our apartment complex. What!? Excuse me!?

Anyway, moving on. I was excited to dig in! But I have never tasted anything that tasted exactly like vomit. I am so sorry - I know that is gross, but it was literally that awful. The noodles were greasy, the flavor was awful, my noodles were cold. Now I'm not a conesuer of thai food so I may not be the best one to ask about the taste of thai however the customer service was less than acceptable. 

I will not be ordering from Naga again."}
{"text":"We live NAGA! Everything we have eaten has always been fresh, perfectly flavored with decent portions. The staff are really friendly & remember us when we pop in. We often pick up take out more than dining in which says a lot for their food because we are outside of their delivery area & will drive up the freeway to get it ourselves! Pad Thai, Basil Pork Stir fry, various fried rice dishes, chicken satay, panang curry...its all been amazing! They do close later in the day to transition from lunch to dinner so make sure to clarify when before heading over."}
{"text":"Stopped in on my way home from McCarran airport because I had some work to do and I needed some brunch. Yelp is my go to and a HUGE Thank You to my fellow Yelpers for posting reviews. I sometimes forget ... well a lot of times I fail to check in and post reviews but I have been trying to do a better job lately since I rely heavily reviews in my travels.

I love Naga Thai for a few reasons: great service, very nice ambiance, and excellent food. I ordered Pad Thai a little spicy off the lunch menu which was served with a little cup of yummy soup and a salad w/ginger dressing. What a perfectly portioned meal. The flavor and heat were a perfect blend of sweet, spicy and sour! I had work to do and decided to order dinner to go since I was packing a cooler. Ordered the pineapple fried rice with chicken and pineapple chicken curry!  Both were full of flavor, fresh ingredients, and all ingredients perfectly balanced. I will be eating here again!"}
{"text":"BOOORINGGGG.

It's cute and all, but I prefer quality food over quality atmosphere. 
That little heart shaped rice formation is cute too, but i'd prefer to have a legit bowl of rice, please. I need my rice::curry ratio to be on point.

I've been there numerous times and have had yet to write about it because it was so unremarkable.  Why frequent a place so much that isn't that good? Because I wanted to like it. A real live Thai restaurant in good old Hendertucky, Nevada? I actually wanted  to love it, but after trying a variety of curries, pad thai, and noodles, my palette was left unimpressed and perhaps still a little hungry (I rarely leave a place without leftovers).

Here's what I'd suggest: if you're in the area, it's not the worst place to stop by FOR LUNCH. At least you can feel like you're getting what you paid for with their decently priced lunch specials. Also, they are closed on Mondays and closed from 3pm--4pm."}
{"text":"Naga is amazing!!! The staff there are so nice and we have always had great service. We usually order take out but, on occasion, have eaten at the restaurant. The food always tastes fresh. 

As a pescatarian (vegetarian that eats seafood), I'm so appreciative that they will make dishes meat free for me and forgo using chicken broth, etc. I have so many faves here; salad rolls, pad prik king, pad thai, spring rolls, crab rangoon, basically all their stir frys. I was so sad before Naga came to town, now I have great Thai in my backyard!  

I tried another Thai restaurant down the street on a Monday when Naga was closed, it was horrible, learned my lesson... Naga reigns king!"}
{"text":"This place has become my new crave. The lunch specials are $8.50 I get the chicken pad thai and it comes with soup and salad . The flavors keep you wanting more."}
{"text":"The food here is so good! We always order take out and the service is wonderful. They're friendly and never get our order wrong. I always get the Thai fried rice and it's the best rice I've ever had. Obsessed!"}
{"text":"Great Thai cuisine in a chic atmosphere. We've always enjoyed the service, their number one girl Ink provides. The food tastes wonderful and presentation is beautiful. This is a great place to go that offers a feel of the strip without the drive or tourists. I love the black pepper chicken and drunken noodles. A definite must try."}
{"text":"Whether you are looking for some comfort food like Fried Rice or want something spicy, I couldn't recommend any other place for the finest Thai dining then Naga. I always get the most delicious spring rolls along with my favorite dish, Pad See Wei. Everything taste so fresh and the staff delivers some of the best service. I would highly recommend this place if you want Thai dining experience!"}
{"text":"This place has great food. Really nice atmosphere, and amazing service. Only My only complaint is the prices are a bit high."}
{"text":"I absolutely love their food! Best Thai food I have ever eaten. The staff is always very polite and friendly. I frequent the place quite a bit and they actually remember my name.

My only complaint is one time I ordered some takeout food from them, extra spicy (level 4), and it was a 0 spice level. They were closed by the time I got home to eat my food, so I couldn't call them to tell them about the issue. 

You should definitely try this place!!"}
{"text":"I wanted to love NAGA, but the spark just isn't there. At best, NAGA will remain a friend, nothing more.

NAGA had been on my radar for a while. I live fairly close to it, and for those familiar with the area, we don't get new eateries over there all that often. The first time I tried to eat at NAGA was with my husband, we walked in and had to walk right back out due to the overwhelming, horrid odor. (My guess is one of the businesses in the strip mall was experiencing some plumbing issues). 

The smell was a huge turn off so NAGA fell off my radar for a bit... I finally decided to give NAGA another try this past weekend.  When NAGA isn't smelly, the first impression is a pretty good one. It's a very nicely decorated space, very sleek and modern feeling. 
 
A sweet waitress brought me some complimentary wontons with dipping sauce and took my drink order. I had the Thai Tea which was $4 (no boba). I was disappointed when looking over the menu to see that while the lunch specials are offered on Saturday, they were not offered on Sundays. 

I ended up ordering the mushroom stir fry dish with beef (additional $1.50, I have never been to a Thai restaurant that charges for beef!). For $12.50, it's pricey. The portion was decently sized, but it was served with a VERY small amount of rice. I ended up taking about half of my meal home to go, and was offered additional rice to take home, but that was overpriced as well ($2!!). 

The waitress brought out a comment card for me to fill out with my check. I circled yes for everything because the service was good, the portions were decently sized and the food tasted ok. I just don't see myself returning for anything other then to try the lunch specials with the prices where they are. 

I wish I could say it's me and not you NAGA... but it's you. Start offering your lunch specials on Sunday and maybe we can try again?"}
{"text":"Wow!  Artistry in flavor and presentation.  It's been a long time since we've experienced Thai food with layers upon layers of flavor.  Plus the food was soooo pretty, we had to debate our priorities:  taste or take photos?  (Note - you don't see any pics here.)  We had the green mussels, basil rice, and pad prik khing.  Phenomenal.  We were also impressed with the care taken to accommodate our food allergies.  The decor and music just added to to the cool dining experience.  After the first bite, we let it be known that we'd be back."}
{"text":"First time at Naga! The atmosphere is really modern and trendy. The tables are all black with candles. They also have some modern fixtures inside. The food was delicious. My bf and I ordered chicken pad Thai and Panang with fried tofu. They also gave you spicy and sweet dip with fried wonton strips. 'Twas good!  Looking forward to trying out more dishes from there but I wish it wasn't so far!!!"}
{"text":"Definitely a fan of this place.I have now been to this place at least 5-6 times now.  I love their food and ambience. Service is different from day to day. But i think it has progressively been getting better. Their pad thai is absolutely delicious bursting with flavor. Their sweet and sour chicken is also a delicious healthy option. Since it is more like grilled chicken and not deep fried with skin. 
The best part about this place is that for my vegan and vegetarian friends they not only have the option of tofu but if you let them know they will take out the fish oil and broth and make it vegetarian friendly. I love how accommodating they are."}
{"text":"Not only is the food absolutely delicious,  the staff are very attentive and simply delightful. .. Great dining experience. I would recommend the evil jungle noodles or the Rama noodles. The array of flavors are well put together and very authentic."}
{"text":"This Thai cuisine restaurant is located in a small plaza with various restaurants. It is pretty close to the Horizon Ridge Parkway and the sign was easy to see. From the parking lot which is right in front of the restaurant, I can see people carrying out boxes of foods from the door continuously and I can smell the classic Thai-food aromas, sour and sweet, coming out of the restaurant. Inside the restaurant, there were not much people dining in. 
     The dining room was quiet, yet I can hear the voices from the kitchen. There was an open window where customers can see the kitchen operation. What's more, the small window helps delivering the cooking sound and aromas from the kitchen. They made me really look forward to my dishes. The bar was small with several selected wines and some Thai drinks. 
     I ordered a Thai Tea first. The Thai Tea looks like other Thai teas I normally drink. It was thick with really bright color and served in a beautiful glass, which give me good appetite. It was sweet with strong milky flavor and the texture was really smooth. As for my entrée, I ordered the Lemongrass Chicken. It was the best Thai-flavor chicken dish I have ever had. The whole-piece chicken breast was served on a big plate with some vegetables and half lime on the side. The chicken breast was white and round with some black smoked grid lines on it. There was a strong smoky aroma with a little citrus aroma. The texture of the chicken breast was moist and really easy to cut. Although the chicken seemed like there was not much flavor in it, the taste was rich and incredibly balanced. It was spicy, sweet, sour, salty, and smoky. Every flavor was balanced in my mouth. My mouth felt hot and soft. After the entrée, I ordered the Mango Sticky Rice as my dessert. Mango Sticky Rice is a very traditional dish in Thai cuisine. It was served with a small portion of white sticky rice topped with some diced mango. The sticky rice was cooked in coconut milk. As a result, it smelled milky and sweet. The appearance was bright because of the color of mango. The flavor was interesting, because it combined the sourness of mango with the sweetness of sticky rice. Mango was soft and the sticky rice was chewy. The flavor for me was not very balanced. I hope that the mango to be a little riper. It tasted a little sour for me. 
     Overall, the experience at NAGA Thai Dining was perfect. The atmosphere and aroma of the whole restaurant made me comfortable while dining."}
{"text":"The food aren't that great as I have heard. The price was way expensive for such a small restaurant."}
{"text":"Food is consistently delicious and timely.  I love the real crab rangoons and yellow curry.  Prices are reasonable as well."}
{"text":"This place is consistently great! We eat here regularly, and I have never been disappointed. Have tried several of the dishes, and while they are all fantastic, my favorite is the Thai Burger...WOW I could eat 5 of those things!!!

Highly, Highly recommend Naga !!!!"}
{"text":"Bad service. Can't accommodate patrons and filled to-go orders before dine-ins. Must have lost our ticket amid the confusion after over 30 minutes we received our appetizers. Fried crab wontons were dripping in grease and soupy on the inside. Soup was good, but received a dirty spoon. The Rama noodles were not as good as previous visits. We have NEVER left a restaurant with out tipping EVER, this was our first time. Until they can staff the restaurant better and handle their patrons we will not be returning."}
{"text":"Yum! 
Would give them 5 stars if they were open Mondays.
Lunch special is great, although their corn chowder soup isn't Thai, it's really tasty."}
{"text":"Worst service.  I placed on order over the phone and the worker there said they didn't know how long it will take because it was a busy night.  I called back an hour later and asked the status on my order and they replied agiain not sure.  It was then I asked for the manager and explained to him that I have been a loyal customer and I just needed an estimated wait time.  He checked my order and said it still wasn't ready.  I decided then to go somewhere else to go grab dinner.  I called an half an hour later and I told them that I wanted to cancel my order.  It was then when they told me it was ready and I said it should be free because it took nearly 2 hours.  To end this review the manager didn't seem to care and will never eat here again."}
{"text":"Been here once with a friend who enjoys ethnic foods. Im not too much of an enthusiasts so i was out of my element. The food was alright and it was fairly priced. The service was good . I just dont have much of a taste for this type of food so i doubt ill be back."}
{"text":"This place looks really nice inside. I was surprised when the food was mediocre. My husband and I sampled quite a lot too. We heard good things about this place so we were truly disappointed."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious with top notch service. One of my favorite places to eat in Henderson! Authentic Thai cuisine... give it a try you will love it!"}
{"text":"The rama noodle is literally the best Thai dish here and I've never had anything like it anywhere else highly recommend"}
{"text":"Their signature Lemongrass chicken is fabulous. The restaurant is very well decorated - small, but has a nice charm to it.  
Food does take a long time.  Did I say the food takes a long time?  They got my to go order wrong twice.  If they tell you it will be rady in 15 mintues plan on 30.  Three times I have had to wait over 20 mintues, and that was after the 15 mintues they told me.  
If they could figure out what they were doing, we would eat here a lot more.
I will not order take out there again.  But the food is good enough to go there and dine in - only if I have an hour to wait....."}
{"text":"If Lotus is the best Vietnamese in town, this is probably going to be the best Thai in town. Points for décor, dietary options, and simply put, some of the best Thai food I've ever had (including in Thailand). They have a great selection of cocktails as well."}
{"text":"I have heard positive things about this restaurant and was really looking forward to enjoying a nice meal. We waited about 10 minutes before being acknowledged by the understaffed server, dressed in yoga pants no less. The pad thai that I ordered was good, but certainly not worthy of the term fine dining. My son ordered the Tom yum soup, which was not good at all. At no time did the server acknowledge the uneaten soup or the fact that I split the entree so my son could eat too. The couple at the table next to us had an uneaten entree as well, so this must be a common occurrence. There are better Asian restaurants within minutes which I will continue to enjoy, but Naga is not one of them. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Yeah a good local Henderson restaurant.  My daughter and I visited here for lunch and had an amazing time. The look of the place is beautiful and peaceful. We had edamame, crab rangoons  (a 10), pad tai, and Rama. Great meal for a reasonable price. Lunch special is awesome."}
{"text":"After a couple years of coming here, I must revamp my review. I am so pleased Naga's made it through their growing pains. The food is excellent! The staff like \"Ink\" and \"Pam\" are always welcoming and friendly. I've ordered several dishes and my favorites are the red curry with chicken, garlic black pepper chicken, Thai fried rice and drunken noodles. For some reason, the last times I've ordered the catfish special or crab special, or crab fried rice, we've had stomach aches. Probably issues with the seafood...specifically the crab.
Atmosphere is elegant and tranquil. Food presentation is beautiful. Expect to wait for your food as the kitchen still needs to ramp up their speed, but well worth the wait.
If this were a chain, it would be the PF Chang's of the Thai food world."}
{"text":"Naga is cute and modern. When you walk in it's a small restaurant with one dining area. The service was friendly and the food was delicious. We ordered the Pad Thai lunch special and Tom Yum soup. The lunch special includes rice, a salad, and soup. The soup came with crackers and a dipping sauce. The food can be made to order with a spiciness level 1-4. I had 2.5 and it was perfect. 

4 stars because it was a little slow at lunch."}
{"text":"Love love love. A family favorite. The Rama Noodle (not Ramen-- Rama!) is the best thai dish I think I've ever had. Ask for them extra crispy with extra sauce! The service and atomosphere are great. My only complaint is that they recently raised their prices by about a dollar a dish. Still, it's worth it."}
{"text":"We always have a great experience at Naga. Whether dining in or taking it to go, the food is great and made fresh every time. We like the Tom Yum soup, nice spice to it and fresh ingredients. I get either yellow or red chicken curry which I always finish ALL of. The crab rangoon was great as well. As far as the restaurant itself, the decor and layout is great, nice ambiance. The waitresses always take great care of us and are helpful if we don't know exactly what we want. 

Can't go wrong here! I'll be going back tonight. Keep up the great work Naga!"}
{"text":"They have a great selection for vegans and vegetarians. The curry is homemade and the soups are to die for! The only reason for 4 stars is the service at times, the ladies seem to just want you to leave."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. I've been here a number of occasions and it has been consistently good. The flavors are complex and bright which is what you want with Thai food. I usually go during the lunch hour and order the lunch special. The lunch portion is perfect and presented very nicely. The service has been consistently friendly and prompt. I will definitely continue to come here."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service.  A big plus is the place is extraordinarily CLEAN!   I like the coconut shrimp curry at a \"3\" for hot.  It will clear your sinuses.  The sauce \"sampler\" they give you as a free appetizer is very good with the Thai fried noodles.  This place is worth a try if you like any kind or oriental food.  I keep going back, even though it's quite a drive away."}
{"text":"This place is still amazing. The service this time was pretty good.  Amazingly to us the food came out faster then normal, not sure if they changed the kitchen staff but the food was quickly prepared and tasted really good as always.

There were two new people there on this visit we have not seen before and the attention to customers detail was nice to see.  She came out and took our drink orders and brought that right out and took our appetizer order.

The appetizer came out pretty quick and then we ordered our food.  Just about the time we finished eating our appetizer the food was at our table which was rare in the past.  

Not only was the food prepared to order and tasted just as expected with the right amount of heat, our server came back several times to check on us and to see if we needed anything.

This was a very pleasant visit and even though we were short on time, we got in and out in record time.   I really like this place as I have several checkin's here and will continue to come back even though we now liver farther away from this place then we used to.  It is worth the extra miles to drive here."}
{"text":"We decided to try this because of the good reviews on Yelp. It, like many places we found on Yelp, was an unexpected surprise to be found in a suburb strip mall. The decor is a chic fusion which was very interesting and pleasant to dine in. The food was very good. We started with a combination sampler that had great mix of flavors. The peanut sauce was excellent. We also shared an entree of the Basil Chicken. The chicken seemed to have been cooked in a light sauce that had many spices including basil (that flavor came through very strongly) and had the consistency of ground beef. In addition, there were green and red peppers and onions that were cooked perfectly.The Thai tea and lemonade were excellent though expensive. We could've used a little more rice too. We asked for another serving of white rice and were surprised we were charged for another portion (maybe because we were sharing?) In addition, they only had one one waitress and a bus person. The waitress was clearly spread too thin and was unable to attend to her customers properly. Though we didn't mind having a leisurely meal the family behind us left before ordering because it was taking too long. The restaurant wasn't even full. She was clearly overwhelmed.  Worth a try."}
{"text":"This traditional Thai spot is one of my absolute favorites. Luckily for me it's in my neighborhood. Dining in here is best because the atmosphere is intimate and romantic. Their dishes are so delicious! I highly recommend their thai tea, Panang curry, Tom Kah, Pad see eiu and lychee boba. On a bad day, they are busy. Needless to say this does not ever change the quality of the food. It can be pretty spicy (which I LOVE) but be careful if you are not used to spicy food. Do not fear, vegan options are plentiful here, veggie friends!"}
{"text":"Evil jungle noodles & panang curry w/ pork was delish!! Great presentation and good service."}
{"text":"Naga has food that is pretty damn tasty. At first glance, it seems pretty deceiving in not having much, but they can unpack and deliver some amazing food. It's modern black and orange design and dark ambiance feels relaxing as it allows you to focus on your food and company."}
{"text":"Went for the first time and was pleasantly surprised. It's a cozy place, but with some background music you weren't talking over people. 

Staff was friendly and attentive, without being overbearing. 

The food was out quickly and was very good. I had the \" perfect\" pad Thai with shrimp and she got the panang curry with chicken. Good portion size, we were full when done, but had to try the mango sticky rice. Leave room for this if you go, it was excellent!"}
{"text":"This is a great place for some very tasty Thai food! The service is fantastic with friendly staff! The corn soup at lunch is the best ever, could eat two bowls of this stuff! The portions are not huge but still adequate for lunches!"}
{"text":"In Vegas from out of town and found this place on Yelp. The green curry is the best I have ever had! Also loved the Evil Jungle noodles and the Pad Pak. Will definitely come back next time I'm here."}
{"text":"Best thai place in Henderson . Great lunch specials nice fresh food.  Enjoyable atmosphere . Check it out."}
{"text":"We love this place! Their Thai food is wonderful and my children enjoy their fried rice so much they will only eat it from there!"}
{"text":"This place is a JOKE! I've eaten here several times a week for over a year because I love, well used to love, their basil chicken. Unfortunately they are inconsistent every time with the spice level, so much that I have to order thai chilies on the side because it is NEVER hot enough. I order the hottest they offer (4/4) and I still end up needing two, 1 ounce containers of fresh chilis to even get a mild sting. The owner had the nerve to say she might have to charge me for the extra chilis next time!!! WTF, is she fucking crazy!! First of all it shouldn't be the customers responsibility to add to the dish in order for it to be the heat originally ordered, second of all its thai food therefore charging to make it spicy is ludicrous!! I am ALWAYS disappointed with my food when eating here and only stopped going several times weekly because it was such an ordeal to get my food as ordered! I will NEVER eat here again, the lack of consistency and gratitude for loyal customers is unforgivable..save yourself the disappointment and go somewhere else if you want REAL thai food!!!!!!"}
{"text":"A beautiful interior makes one forget that this is located in a strip mall. But while the decor was beautiful the lack of service offset NAGA's appearance. I walked in Saturday night intending to order carryout and I don't mind a little wait. But when people already seated said they've been waiting 45 minutes plus for their food and at the 9 min mark nobody's even paid attention to me to take my order much less acknowledge I exist I left. 

Yeah this review may get flagged as I didn't eat their food. But when I walk in the door I expect to be acknowledged. It's not like you can't see me, I'm not a small guy and at 6 ft 4 I block the sunlight pretty well when coming through the door. When the service is so slow that they miss customers coming and going, they've got problems. The food may be as good as everyone claims but if the service sucks or is non existent...why bother. 

When I left I called Penns Thai House from the parking lot. I made the drive down the 515 and my food was ready in under a 90 second wait. And it was just as good as ever which means it was perfect. Meanwhile I bet people were still waiting for their food at NAGA. 

I hope to try NAGA again and maybe, just maybe this time they'll notice me, show me to a seat and take my order or politely ask me to wait and do so in under 10 minutes."}
{"text":"Naga Thai has a very modern look. It looks and feels very clean. 

The service was quick and friendly. We were immediately greeted and sat. 

I ordered the Naga Salad with Tofu. The dish was just OK. The portion seemed small and there wasn't much flavor to it. The fried tofu blocks were also harder than it should have been. 

I'm giving it 4 stars because my boyfriend's dish was great. I think they do Thai food well. I wouldn't recommend ordering the Naga Salad. I bet the papaya Salad would have been a better choice at a Thai restaurant. 

I will be back to try other things."}
{"text":"This was our first time at Naga but def not our last. When you walk in you are taken aback by the new, contemporary decor. Modern elegance in such a little strip center. We were warmly greeted and were immediately brought water with lemon and their appetizer of crispy wontons with varying degrees of spiciness. Uncertain of Thai beer selections, the server (who we later learned was the owner) offered her critique and we chose her recommendation, which was quite good. We ordered the Tom Yum soup (best I've had in a long time), the chicken parang (insanely good, perfect texture, all white meat chicken - TONS of chicken, and I added pineapple.) I would say the panang could have been further amplified by the addition of more veggies. My husband ordered the beef pad Thai and was extremely happy with it. The portions are huge so I had plenty for lunch the next day. We also were offered white or brown rice, which I am always appreciative of (brown please) and was a good consistency with a mellow nutty flavor. Lastly, the service cannot be overlooked and show be showcased in this review. Rarely do I go to a restaurant where soooo much emphasis is placed on the customers feedback. Not only did they come by regularly to ask how our food was but also were prompt in pouring more water, clearing plates and proving the bill quickly. We were even given a comment card customized to the restaurant to fill out. In closing, I HIGHLY recommend eating at Naga. Best in Henderson by far!"}
{"text":"THE best Thai food in the Vegas Valley!

I have tried lots of Thai restaurants in the valley but none as good as Naga.  They have one signature exclusive dish that is amazing.  It's called Rama Noodles which is nothing like 'ramen noodles.'  It's a must.  Naga is a little far from the main part of the city but it IS worth every minute of the drive."}
{"text":"A little bit above the average Thai place you go to for lunch. The food is four stars but the service is a one and a half. Try the Lemongrass chicken. Grilled marinated chicken with a sweet peanut sauce. Honestly one of the best chicken dishes I've had. Even though it's not traditional I suggest you give it a try."}
{"text":"Lovely. Great atmosphere. Rama noodles with chicken were AMAZING! Tom ka delicious as usual, little heavy on fish sauce though. Overall A++++!"}
{"text":"Update: 3/25/15...had lunch today at 1245, slowest service I've had since coming. Soup serving was small today as well. Chairs are falling apart in the corner....not impressed today at all"}
{"text":"I stopped at this quaint Thai restaurant and was pleasantly surprised by not only the ambiance, but the friendliness of the staff. The food was spectacular and the desire of the Naga staff to make sure everything was toy liking was bar none. I'm from Chicago and will definitely make a point to visit again."}
{"text":"Decent Thai.
I like they bring you chips and the sauce for heat testing.
Don't like that all the heat is from oil and not actual chillies, I think you lose flavor that way.
I like the interior and the staff was really nice to us."}
{"text":"Great food great service great atmosphere, you can't ask for more, except maybe seeing an elephant walking down the street with green rice fields and mountains in the background. Definitely suggest trying this place."}
{"text":"The jungle curry is amazing! Very fast and great service. I go to Nevada State and it's a great off campus place to grab some yummy food"}
{"text":"This place is right up the street from me. I am an avid thai food addict and tried this place after meeting the husband and wife owners at costco one day. I tried their basil chicken and thought is was phenominal! Their peanut salad dressing is a home run flavor, also. Lunch specials are fair priced and it is alot of food per order. Love the decor, love the owners."}
{"text":"Pad thai, Rama, and Eggplant, coconut soup with shrimp, clear noodle soup with chicken scrumptious. Cindy and the staff provided excellent service thank you so much we will come back again."}
{"text":"Holy Cow Batman.  Ya gotta check this place out.  I am on a Thai food kick after 45+ years of avoiding it and this place is one of the best for sure!

1.  Ambiance - Very nice, trendy, modern place good for dates or the family, trendy or casual.  Located on Horizon Ridge and Horizon Ridge in Henderson near the 215.  Easy access and parking.

2.  Service - Pleasant, welcoming, just perfect.

3.  Prices - Extremely reasonable. Not cheap, not expensive, just right.

4.  Food -  What a great experience. We ordered all spice medium as to not get blown out and not be able to really taste the food.  Medium has a great kick to it, but not overpowering.  As they grade from 1-4, we actually ordered 2.5

a.  Tom Yum Soup - We ordered a small, just enough to share for two. Tasty, tender chicken, and just right.

b.  Eggplant with Ground Pork - This is my comparison dish.  I order this at every Thai place and here, it was very, very nice. Tender eggplant, succulent ground pork. Could not ask for a better flavor.

c.  Pad Kee Mau - this noodle dish they describe as \"Drunken Noodle\" what Thai people order after a night of drinking. This is an amazing dish. The wide noodles are the right firmness, the sauce very flavorful, the chicken mean was very tender alsos.

d.  Red Curry Chicken - WOW. You cannot go wrong with this.


5.  Dessert - Sweet Sticky Rice with Mango Ice Cream.  Hubba bubba.  I am rolling out of this place now. Call for a tow truck.  I am gonna burst.

Delicious.  GK says, check it out!
Overall,"}
{"text":"I recently moved back to Henderson from the Bay Area and have been on the search for really good Thai food so, of course, I turned to Yelp. When I found the ratings for this place and read what everyone had to say I knew I had to check it out.

I went there last night (11/21/2015) and it wasn't that busy, We were seated very quickly and we were brought menus right away. The restaurant was very clean, and the ambience itself is very nice. Modern and perfect to bring a date. Nice, soft music playing in the background.

Our server asked if we had any questions about the menu and the spiciness levels. She also recommended an appetizer (the shrimp in a blanket - which we had, and were excellent). My date had never had Thai food before so we spent a little extra time looking over the menu, but our server wasn't pushy at all. She allowed us the time we needed and that was much appreciated. 

I chose to have the Basil Chicken at a level 3 spiciness since I love spicy food. And my date had the Beef Pra Ram at a level one. Both dishes were excellent. I probably could have done the level 4, but no big deal. Maybe next time. I brought home TONS of leftovers since the portion was huge! 

I would (and will!) absolutely recommend Naga Thai to everyone I know. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Love it here! It's definitely a hidden gem. Quality food every time and awesome service. They also label items on their menu if you want to make your meal vegan! I would say about 50% of the menu can be made vegan. Makes eating out much easier for herbivores! I would eat here all the time if I could."}
{"text":"The only complaint I have is that they are closed on Mondays and sometimes too busy for fast service. The food is so yummy! Some of my favorite Thai food in the Las Vegas area."}
{"text":"This review is for delivery. We placed an order on a Friday night. We got Combo plate appetizer, chicken Pad Thai with peanut sauce and Pd Prie Khing. The lady on the phone to order was very friendly. They advised us the order would take 45-60  minutes to arrive but it got to my house in about 30 minutes. All the food was still very hot when it got here. They gave all the utensils we needed and sauce. The food was soo good. I have never had Pad Thai with peanut sauce (the ordering lady recommended). It was very yummy. I will definitely order again."}
{"text":"Great food had the golden cups for appetizer very tasty and then chicken pad Thai very good!! Service was great super nice staff very attentive next time will be trying the curry"}
{"text":"Crazy-unexpectedly good Thai food for being so far away from everything. We had one the thai curries and soups and we loved it!"}
{"text":"I was craving Thai food.  I saw that my friend Dyanna had went and enjoyed it, so my husband and I decided to check it out.  We ordered the food to go.

I ordered the Rama Noodles with chicken and a spice level of 3. The mix of veggies was nice and the amount of chicken to noodles was also good. The peanut sauce was just a bit to sweet for my liking. My husband got the Pad See Eiw with pork and a spice level of 2. His was yummy. Totally made me wish I had gotten what he had!!! When he finished, he said he want to eat it all over again. We will for sure be returning to Naga soon for the Pad See Eiw!

I would go back & eat in the restaurant. Nice seating and very sparse decor, but it totally works. The staff was nice and attentive. Even though we were waiting for a to-go order they asked us to sit & gave us glasses of water! Naga u be yummy! It's not the absolute best Thai place I've ever been to, but the short drive from our house in Henderson will make it worth going back."}
{"text":"Yummy food! The Rama Noodles with Tofu is awesome! The staff is very friendly and the restaurant is clean."}
{"text":"Awesome find! Love the music and ambiance. Service was excellent and food was very good. I highly recommend  if you like Thai and want to give a new place a try. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Most amazing local Thai dining place there is! This place is even better than some of the over priced strip Thai dining options. We order take out at least 1-2 times per week and have always enjoyed it. The yellow curry, drunken noodle, pad thai, and several other dishes are at the top of our list. We have dined inside at least 5 times and it is a very cute small place with great service and amazing food. The portion sizes for the price are huge!"}
{"text":"Every once in a blue moon, I get this itch to try Thai food.  I KNOW in my heart of hearts that I'm just not a Thai fan.  However, in the interest of being open-minded, I always like to think that I will suddenly discover a hidden affection for this cuisine.

Nope.  NEEEEEVER gonna happen.

Well, I can definitely say that I just don't like Thai food.  I've tried many things at many different places with no success.  NAGA had the best-tasting Thai food I've had in the coolest environment with the best service.  I have no doubt that this is a top-notch Thai establishment... no doubt.  My fiance and I split the yellow Thai curry, Tom Kha soup, and a couple of Thai teas.  I found the Tom Kha soup tolerable (that's about as good as it gets for me).  I love Thai tea, so that was no problem either.  The yellow curry turned my stomach, but much less than other Thai I've tried.  So that's a plus.

I guess it's strange to give a five-star rating to a restaurant that serves food you hate.  However, I'm all about giving credit where it's due, despite personal preferences and quirks (see Sushi Imagine review).  I would definitely go back to NAGA for a Thai tea and to watch my fiance eat.  It's not NAGA's fault that I'd rather eat a can of Fancy Feast than Thai food.  They can't be faulted for that.  Five stars all the way around."}
{"text":"We had the pad thai, pad see eiw, and chicken satay via delivery. The food was exceptional!! I had the best satay of my life when I was in Indonesia and have been searching every US city I go to for satay like that. This place nailed it. Delivery time was quite long, but worth the wait for these high quality, amazingly flavored dishes. They are also always very polite when I call in."}
{"text":"Place is closed..too bad because I ate here before and it was good. I hope it will reopen as we need more restaurants in this area"}
{"text":"So good, so healthy so tasty- unique, make sure you try little bites appitizer"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Thai restaurant. Tom kha gai soup is both beautiful and delicious! Glad it is in my neighborhood. The staff is pleasant and super responsive , and if you go a couple of times, they will greet you by name. The small dining room is comfortable and stylish, the food is insistently well prepared and presented very nicely, and the service is familiar and attentive without being cloying. Strongly recommend. :-)"}
{"text":"We love NAGA! My daughter is Vegan & they have so many options for her. It's so great to be able to go out to eat as a family, with all of our carnivorous eaters & our vegan, and we can all leave with full tummies! The food is delicious! The service is friendly. I also love the local feel! If you love Thai, you'll love NAGA!"}
{"text":"I wanted to find a new Thai restaurant near me because I haven't been happy with my experience at my previous favorite spot. This place will be my new go-to spot for Thai. The atmosphere is comfortable and a little fancier than some Thai places. The server was very nice, attentive. I like that they give you chips with dipping sauces to give you an idea of their range of heat options. I went with one of the soup options and Panang curry. Both were very fresh, perfect portions and a good heat level of 3 out of 4. We will be back to try more!"}
{"text":"I'm hooked!  This is the best Thai restaurant in Henderson.  It's very small, so make reservations and they are closed on Monday. If you call in for a pickup it, remember it's not fast food.  It's fresh and saucy...  So, it will take more than 5 - 10 minutes. The service is amazing!  FIVE STARS FOR FOOD, SERVICE, AND CLEANLINESS. They always remember me and my order.  :-)"}
{"text":"I have been to Naga many times and I enjoy their friendly staff and the great food. The Ramen is awesome, I recommend trying it."}
{"text":"Food is amazing! Best Thai I've had in nevada. I had the chicken fried rice and spring rolls and honestly, it was THE BEST. The only downside was the price. A little higher than most places..."}
{"text":"Great Thai, very close to home, at a fair price.  Menu is pretty extensive, so there is a lot to choose from.  Decor is modern."}
{"text":"A  hidden gem amongst the sea of Thai restaurants in Henderson/Las Vegas. Their menu is full of amazing and they even have Vegan friendly options! I haven't tried all of their dishes (I'm hooked on their Green Curry), but everything I've had so far has been full of flavor and love. 

Besides the atmosphere and great food, the service is also on point. The servers always greet you with a big smile and they're willing to answer any questions you have about the menu. The kitchen folks also do a great job of getting the food out quickly without having to sacrifice the quality of the food.

The only thing that I would change is the portion size of the rice that comes with the curry. I would rather have too much rice than not enough. Other than that this place rocks!"}
{"text":"This is my go-to thai restaurant. So far everything I've tried is great. But I keep coming back to the drunken noodles and the rama noodles. 

When friends come into town I bring them to NAGA."}
{"text":"The best Thai food in Clark County. Every dish we order is right on. Real happy with the staff. They take great care of you when you arrive all the way to when you leave."}
{"text":"We came here on a Tuesday afternoon to eat during their lunch special 
1. Pad Thai - Chicken, 7.75
2. Yellow Curry - Chicken, 7.75
3. Thai Tea, 4
for $24 

- Naga is a deity taking the form of a king cobra. At first, I was thinking naga viper peppers! That'd be really spicy.
- Like an oasis in the desert. This is probably the only Thai restaurant in a 10 mile radius! Good location to serve Non-Asians. Haha. 
- Modern atmosphere. Almost like a bar/lounge appeal.
- Lunch comes with soup and salad. 
- Soup of the day was corn. Nice cream corn taste, but muddled that they even serve that in a Thai restaurant. No tom yum? Probably justified by the demographic...
- Spice level from 1-4. We got 2. Tolerable and not spicy. We should have gotten a 3. I wasn't expecting a spice level for pad thai. haha. Weird. 
- Great Lunch special deal. For around $8, I can try some of my go-to Thai favorites. The portion is small, but makes up for it with cute plating. 
- $4 Thai teas without refill fail. 
- Yellow curry was delicious. Creamy coconut flavoring. Potatoes and carrots chopped artistically. 
- Pad Thai was a bit confusing. I appreciated the effort that they grilled the chicken, but it didn't bode well with the sweet tinge of the pad thai. I enjoyed them separately. They used the thinner pho-like noddles. 
- Service was fine, but unremarkable."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with Heather N. with good reviews in mind. After walking inside you could tell this was the lunch rush but nothing you couldn't handle. We stood at the servers stand for a few minutes before being asked how many needed to be seated, not being formerly greeted. She seated us at the table and that is as far as our visit got. The waitress proceeded to help every other table around us and never acknowledged us or even mentioned being with us in a minute. After 20 minutes of being ignored we got up and left. The food may be great here but I'll never know. 

We walked down the way to Sultans Grill and are having some yummy greek food!"}
{"text":"We are new Vegans, and last night we went to Naga for the first time.  I was very impressed with the waitress and her knowledge.  We also can't have oil or nuts, so she told us that is not a problem. 
We had vegetable dishes (can't remember the names) with brown rice, and the rice wraps with lettuce and tofu.   Absolutely delicious,  cooked to perfection and abundant with flavor.  The perfect amount of  spice also!
We will be returning soon:)"}
{"text":"The place was busy when we arrived.  There were only two tables open.  It was a good sign until we were actually served our orders.  Because we were avoiding carbs, we ordered the Full Moon Shrimp, Chicken Satay, Tom Kah Chicken and Shrimp and Lemongrass Chicken.  The Full Moon Chicken's mushroom was tough.  You can't pick up the ball like how it should be and bite into the shrimp, ground chicken and mushroom all in one bite.  The mustard sauce doesn't go with it too.  The Chicken Satay was tender and cooked properly, however, I was not particularly a fan of the peanut sauce.  I like my peanut sauce to have a more creamy peanut flavor than coconut milk.  Naga's peanut sauce was runny and leaned towards a more coconut milk flavor.  The Tom Kah was good except, the smell of fish sauce was too powerful.  I think this dish needed more coconut milk.  In addition, I think the chicken pieces in it were not cooked thoroughly as it felt velvety and somewhat slimy in my mouth.  If you're getting the Chicken Satay, then don't get the Lemongrass Chicken because they are basically the same thing only you get dark meat and the meat isn't in skewers.  The sauce base is the same, satay.  Lastly, what is up with the website's home page.  The voice over that says, \"NAAAAGGAAAA\" is kinda creepy.  Oh well, it is almost halloween, so it kinda goes with the season.

One good thing is the staff.  They were prompt, and warm."}
{"text":"Good food the only concern I have is the lighting. It's a bit dark and hard to see but other than that the food and service is great. I enjoyed the food I ordered."}
{"text":"I've been to NAGA twice now.  The first time I saw that it was on Horizon Ridge and because I'm geographically challenged I assumed that meant it was close to the area I'm familiar with near Eastern, Green Valley Parkway, etc.   It's not.  It's way east, near the Henderson Campus of CSN.   The 2nd time I had to work at the aforementioned Henderson Campus so it was a no brainer to go back for lunch as I find the majority of options in that area offend my delicate palate.

The food here is VERY good.  The first time I did a Tom Yum soup with Shrimp, and found it to be a nice version of the dish.  I liked the touch of them removing the lime leaves prior to serving to save me from that extra step (my laziness continues to show no bounds)  I also tried the NAGA salad with beef, which I found to be very similar to most restaurants' versions of a simple Thai Beef Salad.   The ingredients were fresh and everything tasted nice.    The 2nd visit I tried the Basil lunch special with pork.   Again the ingredients were fresh and everything tasted great.  The pleasant surprise was that the lunch special came with a little salad and a cup of lovely creamed corn soup.  Anyone who knows me knows I tend to hate salads, but this salad had several of those wonton crisp strip thingies that I adore so much which raised the bar considerably.  

Service has been nice both times (once dine in and once take out), but I did find it a little slow each time.  My biggest complaint though would be on the spice levels, as they ask for it out of 4.   I can't tell you how much I hate spicy scale levels not out of 10.  I like a 7 or 8 out of 10, and always find that a 4/4 is too spicy and a 3/4 is not spicy enough, and I never feel like restaurants take decimals or fractions seriously.   Do I really think they'll write down 3.67 to give to the chef making the meal?  No.  

The lunch specials are nicely priced at about $8.   I also ordered a \"Fresh Lemonade\" because I cannot resist it on any menu.  It cost $3 and while tasty, I felt the size didn't match the price charged.   

All in all, you should consider NAGA if you're ever in the dining hell that is east east Henderson or if you're tired of the other 523 Thai restaurants you can choose from."}
{"text":"This is the epitome of Thai food. Love this place and have had their food many times now. Staff is very polite and the atmosphere is great. Thai food is my favorite and I actually went to Thailand solely based on the food and culture. My one critique is their pad Thai is not as good as many others I've had. My favorite here is their pineapple rice and curry dishes. Thai iced tea is also very good here."}
{"text":"OH MY GOOOOSH! We are from out of town and tried Naga last night from reading reviews on yelp, and it was SOOO GOOD!!! I told my husband I was already sad we were just visiting because I know I will crave this when we get back home from our trip! Seriously, I have tried a LOT of Thai places (living in the Bay Area, you have PLENTY of choices) and this one is hands down my favorite! I loved the clean, modern decor, and the staff was very friendly and fast. I ordered the chicken pad thai with the peanut sauce on top.. you HAVE to order the peanut sauce on top! Its maybe a buck or 2 extra, but so worth it! It was sweet, but not too sweet. The chicken was prepared perfectly (most chicken in pad thai runs a little dry, but it was so moist!). Seriously, my mouth is watering just thinking about it! My husband had the red curry with chicken and his was great too.. I was almost sad I didn't order that... almost ;) We both got sodas and our total came to just over $30 bucks... even better!! If you know your thai food, and even if you don't, you will not walk away disappointed with Naga!"}
{"text":"Naga has some good thai food, especially if you like Pad Thai. I've also enjoyed their vegetable springs roles, cucumber salad and Thai Iced Tea. The service is always good as it's a tiny place and their staff has minimal tables to oversee. They are closed on Monday's and tend to get busy around 7ish every other night of the week so make sure to go early if you are hungry!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. The staff is nice and the atmosphere is cool. It's clean, unlike a lot of other thai places I go. It's usually not very busy. Their menu is typical. I've been there a few times and everyone I've been with enjoys it. The curry is always a little too spiced for me despite asking for a level 1."}
{"text":"Food is hit a miss. Some is excellent and some I would never order again. I've been here for dine in and came here for take out. It has a modern look and the staff is friendly. However service isn't anything special. They messed up on my order and had to wait another 20min to fix it without compensating anything or even letting me keep what they messed up. I recommend eating inside rather than getting take out unless you call your take out order ahead. They will always tell you 10minutes even though it will take double that time. When you find something you like stick to it. You don't want to experiment too much here."}
{"text":"Ambiance was nice. Food was just okay. They have a range of different appetizers that I've never tried before so that was different in a good way. I liked how they brought a sample of the levels of spice they add to food. I had Pad Thai for my main dish, but it was probably the least favorite of any Pad Thai dishes I've ever had."}
{"text":"Great Thai food. Much better than other Thai places listed on Yelp. Service is spotty. Sometimes great and fast, other times slow, even if the place is not busy."}
{"text":"I'm new to the Vegas area and simply love Thai food. Found this place on yelp and decided to give it a try. The atmosphere is very nice. Small yet cozy and the servers seems really nice. I ordered the combo appetizers with the spring rolls, crab ragoons and chicken satay delicious. Once it was time to pay the server swiped my card for another tables order. Wasn't happy abt that but accidents happen. The next night I went back and ordered to go. Chicken and shrimp fried rice with no spice. When I arrived home it was so hot I couldn't even eat it. I called and they told me the chef said he didn't add any spices and they wouldn't replace it. Needless to say I'm never going back here again. Good food when made correctly but horrible service."}
{"text":"Enjoyed lunch meeying eith colleagues. Super fast service with a smile. Spicy level just right..."}
{"text":"Man I love this place.  I am a big fan of the Pad See Eiw and the Pad Thai.  The kids love the chicken in both dishes and I love the overall flavor profile of both dishes.  The \"Drunken Noodles\" are also awesome. Be careful on their spice.  1 is hot and 4 is ridiculously hot.  The only complaint I have is dining in can be a lengthy process.  We have become take out people here.  Also, they don't give you the tale noodles if you do take out :("}
{"text":"This place is very good, love there lunch special. The yellow curry is my favorite and I order there delicious boba!"}
{"text":"If you want atmosphere this is the place for you, very upscale but all the focus is on presentation. Too small portions for the price you pay, and food was ok, won't be going back, wish I could say differently. Please know that this is my opinion, to each there own. It's important to support local businesses so don't take my word for it, go try it out and see for yourself"}
{"text":"So we have eaten at the Naga. I'm always leery of Thai place's  because they just never seem to get it right. The curries are always watery, and my personal preference is a thicker Currie. This place is the exception. I had several of their dishes. Chicken panang, with a spicy peanut curry and it was thick and rich I only wish they would have garnished it with peanuts on the finished dish, but otherwise it was very good .We also had Rama noodle with beef and  it was D Lish us. The chicken satay is some of the best I've ever had. And overall I was very pleased. Like MacArthur said, I shall return, and the  girl that took our order was very nice to. Thank You Naga. Thefooddude."}
{"text":"Always delicious, my favorite Thai food in the valley! The Rama noodle is my go to, I just wish I lived closer!"}
{"text":"Hands down best Thai food in Henderson 
The ambiance is beautiful 
The meals are so flavourful 
I can't remember the full name but under appetizers something called basket is so amazing and the lard salad rich in flavour and noodles dishes are amazing"}
{"text":"I've been to Naga  few times now and the service is always excellent. The dining area is not huge, this is a great place that has a small, intimate, cozy feel. I come back and will continue to dine here because each dish I've tried is a winner. 

I have a gluten intolerance, so Thai food is usually a good choice. I often order curry dishes because any sauce that has soy sauce would not be typically gluten-free. So it's best for my stomach to avoid them. On my first visit, I mentioned my gluten intolerance and my waitress explained that the tofu or shrimp was my only choice for meat, since the chicken and beef were marinated. Since then, I've asked about certain stir fry dishes being gluten free and my waitress was very knowledgeable and was willing to check with the cooks. This is why Naga Thai will continue to get my business. 

One tip, though, please close the door behind you when entering or leaving. Sometimes the door gets stuck open and it's hard to believe some people are so unaware that they leave the door open."}
{"text":"A frequent stop for us! What an awesome place. I was intrigued from the first time I walked in! Dark and nicely decorated. Awesome menu. Authentic food. The vegan options are clearly marked! We can't eat the complementary chips because of the egg, but what a cool concept! Prompt and friendly staff. The sake mixed drinks are nice twist and delicious. Cool place!"}
{"text":"Pretty disappointed...simply, Meh! It was close to my new work so gave it a try. Lack of taste overall. I'd say their ingredients are pretty fresh but the execution of combining the sauces and the ingredients needs serious work. We tried combo appetizers, pad thai and pad see ew...pretty common thai dishes. A word of advice, esp. for a guy with normal appetite...don't go there hungry! Or make sure you don't order their lunch special. The portion is really small and you'll most likely leave there hungry. Even with $12 combo app + pad see ew lunch, I'm so unsatisfied! Quantitatively and qualitatively speaking! And don't think I'm a huge Samoan or something... I'm not a big guy any means, 5'9\" 150 lbs. The service was prompt and friendly tho. I'm just glad I can find better Thai restaurants near where I live. And with better price too!"}
{"text":"Really delicious food. They have a wide variety of flavors and choices. The chicken satay and fried rice are my kids' favorites. Curries from here are amazing, you can't put them down. The evil jungle noodle with seafood has a ton of seafood in it. I love that they deliver too! Highly recommend Naga."}
{"text":"Quick friendly service with yummy food! I got the yellow Thai curry with chicken and was completely satisfied with it! My fiancé got the Rama Noodle and loved it! He wouldn't even let me try it at his last bite! And when other customers came in the hostess remembered their orders! It was a really great experience"}
{"text":"I come to NAGA mainly for the convenience and for their lunch specials.  I work about ten minutes away so I usually call in my order before I leave the office and it's enough time for my food to be ready when I arrive and get served quickly. Plus, it's a great place to meet up with my favorite Henderson friends, Shirley B. and Suzy H.  I usually get the chicken Pra Ram with brown rice lunch special.  With the upcharge for brown rice, it's $8.75 for a lunch that comes with a side salad and a small bowl of their corn chowder, plus won ton crisps.  There are other standard Thai dishes on the lunch special menu, as well, but not Panang curry, which is disappointing because I'd get that instead.  Service is always friendly and attentive.  Unfortunately, I have just enough time to chat a little and eat my food before I have to get back to business.  One day I'll come for dinner or on a day off so that I have time to try the sticky rice and mango that Suzy says is to die for!"}
{"text":"We come to Naga frequently. Their menu is very friendly to dietary restrictions, gluten-free, vegetarian, vegan. The wait staff is very friendly and are always happy to make recommendations.The food is very good, and generally pretty quick."}
{"text":"Excellent service, excellent food, decent prices. Restaurant is ultra modern and trendy and the owner is so friendly! I loved the chicken pad se ew (medium spicy level 2). George had the green curry chicken and the portions were huge! Definitely the best in Henderson and we're only 5-minutes away! It's a new restaurant so their signage isn't up yet---they're next to a froyo bar."}
{"text":"Came here with the hubby for some Thai dining. I usually frequent Le Thai downtown, but this is closest to my house so I wanted to give it a shot. 

Hubby had the Thai spicy noodle dish, and I ordered the Thai basil fried rice. Our glasses were filled promptly, but interaction from waitstaff was severely lacking. 

We waited approximately 30-40 minutes for our food. The place was a little busy, but not bad (it is small, so I get it). When the plates came out we were left to eat our food - sans utensils. It took me about 5 minutes to get forks. 

The food was good. Almost as good as Le Thai. I'm happy to report that there IS a good Thai Restaraunt in Henderson. Although they still may be working out staffing issues and waitstaff training, the food here is pretty solid - 3 stars."}
{"text":"I've had Naga bookmarked FOREVER.  I talked my Dad in to taking me to lunch there on a Tuesday afternoon, and was surprised when he agreed!

First of all, the decor and atmosphere are very nice.  I was impressed.  The neighborhood needs more places like this.

It was around 1pm, and there were quite a few tables already seated.  We stood at the door for a couple of minutes and then were approached by a young man who sat us at an available table.  

It appeared as if there was a large party that had just been seated and the waitress was assisting them with their order.  Unfortunately, she was the only person working and we, along with 3 other tables, had to wait for her to finish with them before she assisted any of us.  This took about 15 minutes.  Needless to say, the service was overall very slooooooow.

We both got the lunch special for $7.75.  I had the yellow curry (chicken) and my dad had the drunken noodles with pork.  I find it very strange that they charge extra for beef and for pork, but whatever...he loved his noodles and my curry was very good.  I got it at a level 3 (out of 4), and it was the perfect amount of spice.  Each meal was served with a small salad (choice of ginger or peanut dressing) and soup. The soup of the day was corn, and it was so delicious, creamy and buttery that we chose to take some home as well.  The salad was very plain, basically just lettuce with a drizzle of dressing.

The portions are smaller for lunch, but I found it to be very filling.  I really enjoyed my curry and would definitely go back for more.  I also ordered a thai iced tea, which was really good, but a little overpriced at $4 (half the price of our entire lunch entrees!).

I love supporting local, small businesses, so I will definitely be back.  Hopefully the service isn't as slow when I return!"}
{"text":"Horrendous service, tiny portions, rude employees.  We wanted to try a Thai place closer to our home so we decided to try Naga.  What a mistake.  My \"bowl\" of curry was mostly bamboo shoots with a quarter inch of broth.  The only good part of my meal was the brown rice - best rice ever.  We wasted a lot of money on lackluster food with the slowest service ever.  It took 30 minutes to box my son's leftovers and during that 30 minutes no one came to our table to refill water or see if the rest of us needed boxes.  The only speedy service came when the check arrived and they wanted a tip.  Save your time and money...go to Thailicious!"}
{"text":"Great food, service is vey friendly and great atmosphere! Definitely come check this place out, authentic Thai which is hard to find. A little expensive but the food presentation and taste is well worth it!"}
{"text":"Small, but quiet and trendy eatery. Very delicious and affordable lunch menu! Pad Thai was amazing!"}
{"text":"If you have time to waste, this is the place for you! There is not a lot of seating. There is only 1 server and one waitress. The food was good, but because we had to wait so long, we wouldn't go  back!"}
{"text":"I wanted to love NAGA, but unfortunately, I was left underwhelmed after my second time dining there. The first issue here is that they are S L O W. It took over 10 minutes to get water and an additional 10 minutes to order. Dinner was another 30 minutes later and we were not checked on until nearly done. This is noteworthy since my mom did not like her food, could not inform the server, and was instead stuck eating something she didn't care for.

As for my meal, something was also very off. I ordered the Laab prepared with tofu at a spice level of 10. The spice was not hot, but was seriously irritating my sinuses and had a bitter/charred taste. I inquired with the server about the type of chilis used, and why I did not see any Thai bird chilis. She told me they use Mexican-yes, you heard correctly-chili powder. WTF is Mexican chili powder doing in my Laab? That explains the bitter, off taste. Anyway, upon further inquiry, I was informed that they do not have Thai bird chilis in the restaurant AT ALL! 

Thus, this is not really a Thai restaurant in the slightest. If you don't mind Mexican-Thai fusion, this is your place. If you're thinking WTF just like I was, I suggest a different, more authentic location."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing the service is great they are very extremely clean and make sure that your experience is absolutely perfect and the food is cooked to perfection everything about this place is absolutely wonderful I would recommend it to anybody"}
{"text":"This is our favorite Thai place in Vegas!! Modern, clean, and great music. They have done a great job creating a nice and relaxing atmosphere. The food is always so fresh!!! The Tom Kah, ginger tea, and yellow curry are our favorites. Followed by the mango sticky rice. Fantastic service!! We love our server, Ink!! Tons of vegan options- my husband loves that. We come here once a week!!! Can't say enough! Best kept secret  in Vegas ;)"}
{"text":"Decided to drop in for lunch here. It was 12:15pm when I arrived and the place was full. Had to wait about 8 minutes to get a table. They have a nice selection of dishes for their $8.25 lunch special, I went with the stir fry Pad Pok with chicken and a Thai Ice Tea. First they bring you a salad (lettuce) with either a peanut sauce or garlic dressing. A small bowl of soup which was delicious and sweet. The main course was really flavorful as well, with plenty of chicken mixed in with the vegetables. I enjoyed my meal very much and will come back! Service was quick and friendly."}
{"text":"This is an adorable little boutique restaurant with a really hip atmosphere and friendly service. I've never ordered anything from here that I didn't like! Perfect for a date night or an outing with friends. My personal favorite is the pineapple curry with shrimp!"}
{"text":"This is based on the lunch special:
For $7.95 you get soup, salad and an entree. There was a fairly large number of choices for the entree- 4 stir fry dishes, 3 curries, 2 fried rice and 4 noodle dishes. Also, if you want any other meat besides chicken it is a little extra. The portions are pretty small, especially the soup and salad, but it was still a pretty good deal for the price. For the entree I got the green curry with chicken and I was very pleased with it. Only complaint is that it stated it has eggplant in it but I sadly only got a few tiny slivers. I'll definitely be back to try some regular menu items."}
{"text":"I have been to Naga a few times in the past and have always enjoyed the food as well as the service, tonight however the service was lacking. We placed an order for the combination appetizer and a bowl of soup. After finishing the appetizer, we were asked if we had more food coming; I mentioned we had soup coming. The waitress came back to the table and said she was sorry that she had not heard us order the soup, although when we did order it, she had asked how spicy we wanted the soup. The soup finally came about fifteen minutes later. The food was still very good, however  I believe management could have offered us something for having to wait for the soup due to their error. Our waitress apologized for not hearing us order the soup, however it was another waitress that stopped by our table that showed more concern for the error. I believe our waitress could have shown even a little bit of empathy."}
{"text":"A small, cute Thai place in Henderson. The place seems brand new, I'm not sure how long it has been there, but by brand new I mean extra clean! They bring you wonton chips and sauces so you can see the different heat levels before ordering. The prices are decent and the food is good! I had the pad Thai with shrimp, although I wish I had gotten it without the peanut sauce because it was over powering and made it a little one note (just my personal preference though!) other than that, just yummy food. Would return."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time with local friends. Wish it was in So Cal. Delicious, extremely fresh, staff friendly and caring. 

We had basil fried rice, Pad Thai and eggplant stir fry. All was delicious; veggies SO fresh!

Long drive from Summerlin where we started, but well worth it!!!

Do yourself a favor and go!!!"}
{"text":"Love this Thai restaurant!!!  Best pad Thai in Vegas...by far!!  Also love the consistency!!

Like how friendly the service is and how quick they are.

Dislike how far away this is for me but I am always willing to make the drive.  

Favorite dish is definitely the Perfect Pad Thai with chicken spicy number 3 (1 to 4 spicy levels). The Thai iced tea is a perfect drink to go with a perfect meal."}
{"text":"I'm disappointed in my experience because of how my sister said they were really great. I was expecting a lot more out of this thai restaurant.

This place has the potential to be considered 5 star dining because of the quality of the food and kind of fancy interior design atmosphere, however, 5 stars is not what I believed was represented. 

The remainder of the reviews are true, the service isn't quite up to standards of a regular restaurant, and because it is a small \"mom and pop\" kind of shop it's important to have quality service since you are also competing with a bunch of thai restaurants. Yes, this is the only one in the area, but if you continue to give such insufficient service, I don't mind driving out 15 more minutes to go to another thai place with better service.

We walked in and it wasn't even busy and it took at least 15 minutes for us to be sat. They just kind of looked at us and continued on what they were doing. Mind you, this is our first visit here, no hi or hello, so do we seat ourselves? There was also a guy who came in after us, and he was also waiting to be seated as well. I was so tempted to ask him if we were supposed to seat ourselves.

After we stood awkwardly we sat down on a small couch to the side and waited a little more. Finally someone approached us and got us sat. The chairs looked all beat up and were peeling... get rid of them. The girls were constantly walking back and forth helping other tables and even the guy that sat after us already had his drinks on his table and his order ready. I'm confused, so I closed my menu, hoping they would come up to us, and just wondered if they even realized we were still sitting there.

At this point, I was about to tell my boyfriend let's just get up and leave. But then this girl comes and asks if we're ready to order...... Ok yeah. But she didn't even ask us what we wanted to drink. So I stated my drink and ordered my meal because I felt like she would never come back and asked about their \"new appetizers\" they displayed outside of their shop. She looked at me all confused and didn't know what I was saying. She made me feel a bit stupid and didn't know at all about what I was talking about nor could she answer my question. Why have a sign with information outside if your servers don't even know what's on them? That was a waste of my time.

What do you know.. our food came out pretty quickly by another girl. She seemed quite shock that we didn't receive our drinks yet so of course she had to ask us what we ordered and then had to grab them for us. What was going on with the other girl? Anyway, the food was great. We got the green mussels and the lunch specials. The green mussels came out hot and in a sriracha based broth. The lunch specials came with a small salad (peanut or garlic based dressing), small what seemed as corn soup, and some fried wontons. They were all delicious! It made up for the horrible experience of getting a seat. Then our main dishes came out. We both had pad thai with beef. I really enjoyed this. The flavor was spot on. The beef however was very chewy. Other than that, it was a good portion for lunch and I came out feeling full and satisfied with my food.

Like I said, the quality of food is possibly the best part of this place. It's such a shame that the service didn't make me a happy camper. But hey, at least the cooks know what they're doing so I guess that gets them 2 stars."}
{"text":"I went to Naga the other night at a friend's suggestion. Loved the atmosphere and decor. The food presentation was unique and satisfying. In comparison to other Thai restaurants I have frequented, the pricing is very reasonable, especially since the food is so good. I would recommend the green curry for a main dish and the fried banana for dessert."}
{"text":"I wanted to give this place another chance, I really did. I went around 8:40 pm on a Sunday and the place was already closed! The manager looked like she was counting cash and closing shop.

Why not change their time to 9:00 PM? I think this has been one of the worst reviews I've ever written for any establishment. Being the son of a former retail mom and pop store, I know customer service and this place lacks! Combined with my last experience with this place, I have nothing, but a salty impression of NAGA."}
{"text":"I've never actually been in the restaurant itself, so this review is for their delivery, which I order often!

I always order tofu as my protein source for noodles and rice dishes, so I can't comment on any of the meats with the exception of the chicken laab. So far, I have had the pad thai, pad see ew, pad woon sen, rama noodles, pad kee mao, chicken laab, crab rangoons, pineapple fried rice, thai fried rice, crab fried rice, tom yum soup, and panang curry (like I said, I order from here a LOT). 

All the food is consistently delicious. They are not joking about the spiciness. I usually get a 2-3 spiciness level (out of 4) and that is plenty for me. I highly recommend the rama noodles and chicken laab, if you can't decide what to order. 

The wait time for delivery is usually 45 minutes - 1 hour. It used to be the same little Asian lady who would deliver my food, but they have a new delivery person now. One time they forgot about me, so they comped my entire meal, which was nice. 

The only complaint that I have is that their delivery availability is inconsistent. I'm always disappointed when I call and they say they don't have delivery that night. I assume it's because they only have one delivery person and it's his day off or he's sick, but I never know if it's going to be available or not until I call and am already all excited about getting my food. I mean, I literally live 10 minutes away and could easily go pick it up, but sometimes I just don't feel like going out into public and delivery makes my life much easier...."}
