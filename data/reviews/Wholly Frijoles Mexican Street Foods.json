{"text":"My favorite food truck! Their vegetarian option, the calabacitas is so good! It's zucchini, yellow squash, bell peppers and onion. I always get the chipotle crema and hot salsa. If you're sensitive to spice, ask for the hot salsa on the side so you can add as much or as little as you'd like. They're also the nicest people ever, and very fast. Love!"}
{"text":"Stopped by Wholly Frijoles Mexican Street Foods at the Cleveland Flea. Overall, it was good, but not great, though it is possible I just ordered the wrong thing. Pros: potential to create healthy, non-fried options, fast-moving line, generous portion. Cons: lime-spiced chicken was quite bland and lacked seasoning, guacamole seemed processed/store bought.   Perhaps if I had ordered the nachos or chosen a different meat, I would have been happier. Willing to try again."}
{"text":"Tried this truck at Walnut Wednesday and was impressed with the quick service, even with a long line. Their hot salsa was good and had a sort of sweet flavor to it. It was a great compliment to the Mahi taco that I ordered, along with chips that same lime flavor as the chips from Chipotle. The main reason they aren't getting more stars from me is the fact that their \"guac\" is more of an avocado sauce rather than traditional guac, which was disappointing since it is a Mexican staple. It's still pretty good though. If you're looking for some tacos in the Cleveland/Akron area, give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Had some very fine corn tacos with carnitas at this truck one Saturday at Rubber City Harley Davidson. Rivals the best Mexican food you can find in the area, if not better."}
{"text":"Gluten Free!  I asked and the pork and lime chicken are gluten free.  I got a burrito bowl with the pork.  It was very good and I didn't get sick.  Kinda like Chipotle but with A LOT more flavor.  Look forward to eating again."}
{"text":"OMG..just drove 20 minutes to find this food truck. First time eating out of a food truck and my wife and I were blown away. The chips and queso is a must ...simply awesome. We each got a burrito, she had chicken and I had beef. Everything possible was in it rice,beans,cheese and salsa verde. Out of this world!!!! Needless to say we loved it, definitely go back. Very nice people on the truck.Thanks guys"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this food truck.  I have never gotten bad food here.  The nachos, burritos, tacos and soup are all amazing.  You can tell everything is made fresh and with high quality ingredients.  Juan and his crew are all awesome.  Follow them on Facebook or Twitter to see where the food truck is going to be for the week.  They also have a new truck coming out this year - Boca Loca Burrito Factory.  Really excited to check that out also."}
{"text":"This was my go too truck for walnut Wednesday. Disappointed there were no taco salads. No Options today. If there aren't options next week I'll be moving on."}
{"text":"My husband ate here at the Cleveland Flea and oh my gosh, I can't wait to go back for another chicken burrito. I usually like chipotle, but after trying Wholly Frijoles i'm not sure that ill ever be able to go back. We also had the steak nachos. The chips were the perfect amount crispy and held well up the generous toppings."}
{"text":"Food is always great! Long lines but always quick service, service is also great. Good authentic Mexican food."}
{"text":"Eating my first ever Wholly Frijoles burrito bowl and I could not be happier. Super fresh, GREAT heat and spice, creamy queso... absolutely wicked meal. Totally unexpected from a food truck. The portion was super generous as well; definitely worth the $11 (+$2 for a drink). Would recommend again and again."}
