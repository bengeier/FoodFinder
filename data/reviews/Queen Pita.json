{"text":"Super friendly. Great food, what more do you need to know. Oh, yes, it is cheap too!"}
{"text":"Great food and nice friendly people. Whenever I'm in this part of town I stop here for one of their tasty falafel sandwiches."}
{"text":"If you're in the mood to just gorge on a massive pile of cheap shawarma and such, this isn't the place. But if you want the most deliciously prepared shawarma in town, you have to go here. I took an American ex-pat friend the other day and his verdict was that it is the best shawarma he's had outside of Israel. The falafel is good too, and everything is less than $10. It's family run and the folks are super friendly. The restaurant actually features in a chapter of Joe Fiorito's Union Station, an excellent book of non-fiction stories about Toronto.

Recommendation: try the plate before you try the sandwich, and get lots of their hot sauce because it's amazing."}

On the North side of Queen, across from the Beer Store, this pita place serves sharwma pitas and falafel pitas for lunch. There's beef, kafta, chicken - can get a pita or a plate. Also a bunch of dips, baba g, hummus etc etc. Usual stuffs. 

Take out or sit in, there' actually quite a few seats, and they serve you. 

Super friendly and good prices. Today we both got Falafel Pita ($4.75+tax) The small was tasty, crunch yet soft and filling, surprisingly. They will it with onions, hummus, pickles etc. We were in an out in about half hour. It started to get busy around 12:30pm. 

I did notice the batter for the Falafels were lighter colour than normal. How does it compare to Mystic Muffin? It's not as huge, and the chickpea balls are softer.
Honestly, once all stuffed in pita, it's all a mush of tasty goodness."}
{"text":"I really like the falafel pita here.  It's also very close to my house, which might be a contributing factor to my enjoyment.

The first time I ever had falafel was at the infamous falafel drive-in in San Jose, and the falafels on Queen are not that good, but they're still darn fine falafels.

I really like the father & son who work here.  They are friendly, they always ask me about the NHL draft (I have no idea why, but they recognize me and ask every time!) and they accommodate my falafel pita special order everytime (no turnips, no tahini, no tomatos, extra taboulee).  Note that taboulee is a topping here!  and turnips, if you're into that sort of thing!

Finally, a falafel pita with a pop is 5.75 taxes in, which is sweet.

They have other food like schwarma and other associated products but I have only ever had pretty-good falafels."}
