{"text":"I arrived at about 6pm for dinner at the bar for myself.  It took about 10 minutes before someone came over to take my order even though it was not busy.  I ordered a beer (great selection) and the Angus Burger.  The beer was delivered promptly.  After 30 minutes, my burger and fries arrive.  I ordered the burger Medium and it came out quite well done and very dried out.  I was offered ketchup or a side of mayo to \"help\". The obvious question you just asked is, \"Why didn't you send it back?\"  A) I didn't want to wait another 30 minutes for a burger and B) by then a large group had arrived and the wait staff was in a frenzy. The fries were crisp, not greasy and not over salted. Very good.  Needless to say, I finished I the beer and fries, not so much the burger. Lower rating also due to the waitress showed no interest in being proactive with the food and was solely focused on boosting the drink orders. I even had to ask for the  check after sitting there for 10 minutes with my plate covered with my napkin."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Irish pub in town.  It has a very authentic feel for being attached to a casino, (probably due in no small part to the fact that the interior was reassembled from a true Irish pub deconstructed and shipped here,) and it doesn't try to be more than what it is - a pub.  No gimmicks.  The service is good and the appetizers are in my opinion better than the entrees, (as it should be for a pub.)  Try the sausage bites or the fries with white gravy.  Depending on when you're there, the atmosphere can get lively, too.  Lots of locals.  For the person looking for an honest pub, this is your spot."}
{"text":"Had the worst Angus Beef burger, It was all bread. I could not taste the beef, lettuce tomato or onion. The bun is meant for a full 16 oz burger. The buffet steamer hamburgers are better. By the way, I'm an Elite player."}
{"text":"Our retreat from the walkers and blue-hairs that surrounded us in the Casino.  We had no idea that we would be the only people between the ages of 21 and 60 in the hotel/casino.

We had an absolute blast here! They do have live music and the band was great.  We ordered some bar food - potato skins and chicken fingers - and they were just a greasy and delicious as I hoped.  

And to my surprise, they make awesome cocktails.  The best sidecar I have had to date!
I was glad we found this place, it definitely made our night."}
{"text":"Just received a fraud alert from my credit card issuer.  They traced a suspicious charge back to this pub.  Attempted a charge of $3.18 to \"Tudor Hotel\" then cancelled the charge, presumably as a test.

I stayed at this Marriott three weeks ago for a wedding.  Started a tab with my card at this pub and left it overnight.  Upon checking out the next morning, realized I left my card and came back to JC to retrieve it.  Bartender told me they sent card to casino security.  Casino security returned my card.

Thought all was good until I received a fraud notification from Chase Visa today and they were able to determine that the charge originated from some entity associated with this pub.  

Some unscrupulous piece of trash must work here; now I need to be issued a new card.  By the way, I had the misfortune of eating lunch here during my stay.  Fish and chips were soggy, slimy, disgusting."}
{"text":"I read mix of reviews about J.C. Wooloughan Two things I read negative comments is about prices and being waited on. I can agree with them they are Higher price and not the Fastest service BUT Get a coupon and don't be in a rush. I think they have great(above average) Fish & Chips. The Calamari Is the best I've had in Las Vegas its tender every-time!! Now during football is only $5"}
{"text":"The first time we ate here, it wasn't bad.  Tonight, however, I couldn't eat my food.  I ordered a corned beef sandwich, which came on rye with jack cheese.  I also ordered a small green dinner salad.  I was disappointed that the salad seemed to have only the \"leftover\" type lettuce found in the inside of iceberg lettuce, near the core.  Worse was the corned beef.  It had no flavor and definitely was not salty like it should be.  I told the waiter that the meat tasted like it had been sitting in water for 2 weeks.  He did not apologize, but said he would tell the \"chef\".  No one came to apologize and nothing was taken off the bill.  The sandwich was so bad, I only ate about 1/3 of it and left the rest.  Service was pretty slow."}
{"text":"My hubby and I came here for a late night snack during our stay at the hotel. There was no entertainment while we were there so it was a quiet and warm atmosphere. We ordered potato skins and the pretzels with cheese~not Irish but it was very tasty and hit the spot. The service was a bit slow but we weren't in a hurry so it didn't bother us. Overall it was a lovely experience :)"}
{"text":"Decided to have lunch here on Saint Patrick's Day. It took awhile to get our drink order after being seated, and it wasn't too busy. We ordered 3 Green Beers and Corned Beef and Cabbage.  For some unknown reason they were playing loud hip hop music in an Irish Pub. We asked the waitress why there wasn't any Irish music playing. She stated,\"I don't know, I just work here.\"  We thought this was odd because it was St. Patrick's Day.  Our meal was brought to us before our Green Beers.  The Corned Beef and Cabbage meal was amazing! Our Green Beer finally arrived in a Plastic Corona cup. Really??? Isn't this an Irish Pub??? Overall, this was not a very good experience."}
{"text":"Still looks like a cool pub but the management has a knack of ruining the menu.  First, the took out the potato croquets... probably their most popular appetizer type item, they've switched up their bangers and mash with new bangers that aren't as good, they don't have soda bread anymore and now they got rid of the Franziskaner Hefe which is my favorite so I'm back to going to YardHouse to get it.  I used to like to come by here, place a few bets on a mon. night football game and watch the game to some Franz and irish food... but now I'm going to find somewhere else to hang out."}
{"text":"Love this place. Friday nights have live music, and smithwicks is the beer to get. Great authentic feel and the very friendly staff."}
{"text":"Fun! Great service and premium beer and drink specials! Finally, a place with great deals for those of us who want better than domestics!"}
{"text":"We come here for the happy hour specials. Great drink and food deals during happy hour. Service is always excellent. I always order the chicken fingers. They give you a lot!! I haven't tried anything else on the food menu. Only gave it 4 stars because the overall atmosphere is kinda meh. This is definitely an old folks casino... But I'll still keep coming back for the happy hour specials!"}
{"text":"Fish and chips typical irish fare, have some good bands that plays there as well great for happy hour and hang outs great staff as well. U2 tribute band Joshua tree usually plays out there."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good food!! Not usually a fan of Irish food, but I'd go back to this pub. We had the steak tips, shepherds pie, & beef/ Guinness pie. All good."}
{"text":"This used to be a great place to grab a beer and eat some good food. Sadly it has declined drastically and it has also been taken over by fruit flies.

We complained to our server about the bug problem and when she mentioned it to her manager she said \"maybe they should sit somewhere else\".

Truly disappointed by how bad this place has gotten. 

PS: gave it two stars because my Guinness was delicious!"}
{"text":"This is another one of the better restaurants at the JW Marriott resort. They really pulled off the irish pub atmosphere and had a great traditional Irish menu. The staff were also very friendly and accommodating.

Unfortunately when I was there for lunch at 11:30, they were out of the dish that I wanted (a Guiness beef stew). I settled for the shepherds pie which was good, but not great. I would give it another shot if I am ever staying at this hotel again."}
{"text":"I judge a bar/restaurant by the drinks and food.  Happy Hour has great beer prices, but wine is $8.00 a glass and it's cheap wine.  My husband and I went there today because we wanted Corn Beef and Cabbage.  All I can say is that an Irish Pub should have good Corn Beef and it wasn't.  It was like think sliced processed lunch meat. 
with a cream gravy on top, yuk.  They can afford to stock better wine for $8.00 a glass.
and put a roast in the oven people."}
{"text":"This was our time there. We walk in not knowing what to expect. First, we were looking for a hostess counter or somebody to seat us. Did not see one nor any signs that said \" Seat yourself\". So, I immediately turn to you a lady that had dirty dishes in her hands and asked her, \"Do we seat ourselves\".....her response was \" If you can find one\".......rather rude. We then ventured in and found a table. After waiting about ten minutes, mind you there were no silverware or napkins on the table, the waitress appears and takes our drink order. That went well. She then takes our order which included an appetizer. Shortly, a server comes with our appetizer, potato skins, but no small plates for the appetizer, AND our meal??!! She asks, \" Did you want the potato skins as an appetizer\"? Of course, a little puzzled, we responded \"Yes\". The server says, \" I'll keep your meal warm for you\".....huh...what? After the appetizer, we are served our \"warmed up\" meal, which was, not surprisingly.....dried out from the heat lamp. Subsequently, probably won't return."}
{"text":"Your typical Irish Pub, Wooloughan's is located inside the Rampart Casino/JC Marriott Hotel on the far west side of town at Summerlin Pkwy & Rampart.  

We arrived about 8pm on a Friday evening and the place seemed fairly busy.  We waited at the door for a hostess to serve us, but after several minutes with no acknowledgement of our existence, we walked in and got the attention of a server, and she sat us in her station.  She was very friendly and seemed to be in good spirits.  It is always nice to have a server with a happy disposition!

We both started with a cup of their roasted corn chowder with bacon and it was thick, flavorful and very satisfying. For my entree, I went with their grilled vegetable salad and added grilled salmon to it for $3 which was a bargain, because it was a good-sized filet (about 6 oz).  Our server said the salad was really good, but I am going to have to say it was just good.  While the salmon was cooked perfectly, the vegetables were just OK. Some were rather bland and the lemon caper dressing was a little boring too. Salt and pepper helped, but couldn't make up for an uninspired salad.  And while the menu lists asparagus as the first ingredient, there were only 3 very skinny spears, which was a bit disappointing.

My date chose the shephard's pie, which was a bit of a let down too.  It tasted like canned chili with mashed potatoes on top. I've had shepard's pie before, and they usually have a beef stew flavor, not a beef chili flavor.  Oh well.  He ate all of it anyway.

Our dessert was actually quite good ... We shared the apple crisp and it was a generous serving of Granny Smith apples baked with cinnamon and sugar and topped with pastry crumbles and served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  Very tasty and the apples were cooked just right.

Overall, it is an \"A-OK\" place and I would eat there again if I was in the area, but I don't think I would make a special trip for the food."}
{"text":"Alex at the bar created an exceptional experience. He's very professional and on point! Always checking if customers need anything. I had one of the IPAs which I got to sample before committing. I had the salmon which was very good (not exceptional). But then again, it's a bar. Price for quality of salmon was fair. Finished off with a Frangelico with decaf back. Sweet!!
Nice evening in Vegas! Alex made it special!"}
{"text":"Had a great St. Patrick's Day event! The entire staff worked hard to make sure all the customers were taken care of despite the busy, crazy and very fun atmosphere. It was great to have the Jameson and Guinness girls there and the 2 bands were awesome. Once again, kudos to the entire staff and also the managers for all the hard work to make this a fun and safe event for everyone!

Just to let everyone know, the best Happy Hour in Las Vegas is at JC's. Hard to beat $2.50 for the beer (all of them, not just crap like Bug Light) and they have food specials too. It's a bit of a local's secret but check it out between 3pm and 6 pm."}
{"text":"Came here for St. Patty's Day March 2016.  Wanted a pub \"feel\" to the night.  Place was packed, but as expected.  But the band came and went by 6:30pm???  We wanted music and half way through our meal, they packed up and left.  C'mon, if you are calling yourself a pub and doing St. Patrick's Day - you have music all day and night.  Staff was great, I'll give them that.  Quick service and very friendly.  Don't like that you have to go to the bathroom down the a ramp outside the bar/through a bit of the casino.  None inside the bar?  Wouldn't know as we sat outside the bar and couldn't get in - only VIP's (I guess) were in there for the St. Patty bash.  Sitting \"outside\" is kind of a joke.  They have it fenced like you are on a patio, but you are just in the casino.  Hate that closed off feeling.  No windows and every body walking right past you as you are eating.  I'd rather have been inside the bar.  But, it was the place we picked for the night, so it is what it is. Drinks were okay.  Food was just okay.  Prices as expected for Vegas.  I would not go back here for St. Patty's Day.  Maybe we'll check it out for a happy hour and actually get into the place."}
{"text":"1:17 PM Thursday, I ordered the hamburger Rare, no bread, no tomatoe, no fries, coleslaw. Total $7.02+Tip.   It was called 1/3 lb. Angus beef.
It really was the frozen, supermarket patties, not that great. The place had about 4 other different parties, so it was kind of dead. 
I stayed about 10 min left and went across to the Promenade and ate lobster/steak.
The Best Place to go for burgers?  The Yard House.
I tried to search for JC Wooloughan's since it's  printed on the receipt and shop sign. Nothing, it's re-listed on yelp as JC'S . Trying to hide bad reviews.
Pro's : They have Guinness draft."}
{"text":"It has become a tradition for my hockey family party every St Patty Day here at the Irish Pub. I know there are lot of others Irish Pubs or lets be honest any Irish Pub on St Patty Day is going be great time! I just review the things I like about this particular Irish Pub. Its located in the Rampart Casino first of all so if you feel like getting some gambling in same time that always plus or minus. They have beer garden set up right in the courtyard area right outside the Pub with stage and have band (usually U2 cover band) plays that night. Unfortunately you could not have asked worst weather so this year they shut it down all night. =(  

Restaurant inside or the bar area not that big so once it gets packed. Crazy. They have lot of different beers on tap and even have table personnel tap pour Guinness (think couple other options; charge by the amount) fresh. Lot of widescreen tv around the restaurant keep you update with sports. Think most nights sure on weekend they have live band plays in the Pub. I like the food although mainly go here too drink. I had the reuben sandwich. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Plain... We ordered the buffalo sliders and beef soup.  The soup was salty and the sliders were just buffalo wings n a biscuit :/"}
{"text":"Nothing terribly special about this pub though it was pushed heavily by the hotel staff as the place to hit when there.  

I had the vegetable beef soup and a hot turkey sandwich which came on Texas toast. The soup was tasty but the sandwich was kind of meh. My husband had sliders which werent cheesed. Some places cheese the sliders, some don't. I think that those that don't should ask if you want it cheesed. Just your basic courtesy. ;)

Considering we were the only people in the restaurant who were eating anything, I was surprised at how slow the service was. The other 3 patrons were all drinking beer and watching the game so it was very low maintenance. Our server was nice enough though and kept my drink full.

So while some people get their panties in a bunch over 3 stars, for me, 3 stars just means that it was an average place doing average stuff. Nothing special, nothing bad...just average. And JC wooloughan's Irish Pub was average at best."}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times.  If you are in the Rampart then by all means you should stop in for typical Irish grub and Irish beer...If I am heading out with an Irish pub in mind however, I am not coming here."}
{"text":"Great corned beef sandwich with cole slaw.  I would eat here the next time I stay at the Marriott.  This meal was surprisingly tasty and a good value for the costs.  Was kinda quiet and empty so 3 stars instead of 4 but it was 4 star food."}
{"text":"Good food, good live music, good service & good prices.
Try the hot dog with your beer, you wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"DAILY HAPPY HOUR 3 p.m. to 6 p.m. and 10:30 p.m. to midnight
- 50% off draft beers
- Daily special $5 appetizers
I have alway's enjoyed this pub.  I think HH should last until 7 but other than that JC is alway's a winner."}
{"text":"The service I experienced here was unbelievable. I was here for roughly an hour. During which time I was approached by a server just one time and after that had to go to the bar to order food and return to my table. The place wasn't even half full. When I was ready to leave, I went to the bar to get my check and the bartender/waitress could not have been ruder. I waited over 10 minutes for her to come to me, when I asked for the check she said I would have to wait. She then proceeded to chat with other patrons and even went from behind the bar to hug a couple that just entered the restaurant. Still waiting, I asked another employee for my check. At this point, the bartender came storming back around and tossed the checkbook at me with a scowl on her face and asked if \"I was happy now\". I was in total shock. I gave her my card and asked to speak to her manager. She then took my card and went into a back room. The manager kept poking her head out from behind the door, looking at me. After the second time I asked her if I could just pay my bill and leave. Just a totally unreal experience. Eventually the manager gave me my card back but STILL hadn't rung up my bill! She said she didn't appreciate her staff being treated this way. She doesn't like her employees doing their jobs? At this point, another patron in the bar who had witnessed this whole mess threw down $20 and told me he couldn't believe this and he would take care of my bill. The manager was clearly in shock that someone else was privy to their terrible service and treatment of customers and I got the hell out of there.

This place is a joke. There are plenty of other Irish pubs in Vegas that actually treat their customers with respect."}
{"text":"We are in our own private cabin.  For captain use only! Orders drinks & waiting on burgers.  Laid back atmosphere, own t.v. & friendly wait staff."}
{"text":"First time at this pub. Its inside the JW Marriot back in the shop and restaurant area. But you pretty much go thru casino to get there unless u know back entrance. Don't try it.

Parking kinda sucks. So do all you can while inside the resort.
Authentic Irish pub feel and decor. 

Bar was busy but alot of seating and barstools so no problem. Tv's going with sports and emphasis on soccer but when not on all games open.
Bartender was friendly and poured a couple different beers for to try. I always ask the barkeep to recommend a local or favorite to try something new. Sometimes you find a gem.

They had food but I was just taking a drink break. From what I saw it looked ok but wasn't feeling the food.

Good happy hour deals. 

Overall experience I liked the vibe, the feel was good and priced right. Will repeat."}
{"text":"Good beer place.  Had soup and it was fine, not home made for sure but ok. The bartender was efficient but not friendly."}
{"text":"I'm going to assume our poor waitress has experience with people walking out without paying because during both times I was there she brought up the question: \"so who's paying for all this\" to our group.  A little odd to me, you don't usually get asked that in a restaurant.

The service was quite slow, notably when it's not busy.  The bar is in a resort though, outside a Casino, so maybe I just don't understand their clientele and norms there.

The beer still tasted great.  I can't see you spending much time here though, unless you're grabbing a beer after a long conference or meeting...I'd rather head to the strip for more selection and location."}
{"text":"I have only been once to this bar, but I will definitely be back.  They offered $3 craft beer from local selections in Las Vegas and even some from California.  This alone is one of the best beer deals in Las Vegas.  We got this deal on a saturday night while listening to some live music (I believe they also have live music on friday nights as well).  The place was not crowded at all so the waiter was very attentive to all of the people and constantly was ready to get us some more beer if needed.  I did not eat anything here but the burger looked fine.  The prices are on par with other restaurants, if not a littel cheaper since it is not on the strip.

Come here for some good craft beer.  I will definitely hit this bar up in the future to watch some baseball and drink some local selections."}
{"text":"This is a happy hour review.

Hub and I came here on a Friday night to grab a few bites on the cheap to wash good Irish beer down with.....this hit the spot!
Got here at 5pm, our server, Jack, let us know that 16oz beers were on happy hour for 2.50.   All of them I exclaimed? YES!  Black and Tan please.....while the hubby got a Smithswicks...(likely spelled that wrong...)
Delicious beers arrived as we asked about the five dollar options for happy hour.  We decided to get the chicken fingers with buffalo sauce and the pretzels.   Food arrived.....was delish!
The star of the show were the piping hot pretzels with a beer cheese and mustard dipping sauce....so dang good!  I neglected my chicken fingers in order to eat my pretzel. (2 come with an order and they were big)!
We ordered one more set of 2.50 beers.....pinch me please!
Not understanding the bad reviews...great beer, great pub grub and an awesome Jack to take care of you......we are definitely coming back!
Oh yeah, my tab for 2 people: 2 beers, 2 apps...20 dollars!  Plenty of food!
Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"Wife got shrimp po-boy, i got cheeseburger on pretzel bun. Burger meat tasted like something you would get out of school cafeteria. Cheese wasn't melted. When waiter saw I only took 2 bites he knew something was wrong and apologized. Wife called in sick today GI symptoms. But we got our ice tea for free...."}
{"text":"We used to have decent service here.  The last few times, although the food is good and arrived in a reasonable time, the service has been either awful (ignored-so, we left), quite blasé, or just really slow.  
Tonight, for example, we waited ten minutes to get our bill and another ten minutes for the credit card to get processed...and there was only one other group, at the bar.  
Frankly, they just seemed understaffed and, at least in the busy times, a host(ess) is needed. 
Otherwise, prices are fair but menu is quite limited."}
{"text":"The decor is nice, like an Irish bar.  I had the cuban sandwich and it was good.   Nothing to blow my mind ,but i finished it along with the crunchy fries.  Good in a pinch, but I would not go out of my way to really come here."}
{"text":"Food was ok but the service was horrible !!!! Went to the bar to get a to go order and was told couldn't take happy food to go , so ok decided to take seat with a friend .. You would think we would have been offered a drink ?  The bar server Tamara who was understandably busy on a Friday night but was absolutely not friendly and did not ever ask if we needed anything , didn't stop by until it was time to let us know that the food would be right out .. Sat there and had a few bites and had to ask someone else for hot sauce and for a box . We saw her again and asked for the check which we received in a very quick manner .. If I were to ever go back I definitely would not sit at the bar !!"}
{"text":"Went here on a comp with my wife.  We were seated and our orders taken relatively quickly.  It wasn't super busy, but we literally did not interact for our server, Aileen (or Ilene) for the remainder of the time we were there.

It took nearly 30 minutes to get our food, and the appetizer we ordered -- a large soft pretzel -- was actually the last thing that came out!  We never received refills and after 25 minutes of my wife having an empty glass I finally went up to the bar to get a soda refill myself.  I'll note that the place was not more than half full and that the server went multiple times to the tables around us.

As for the food, it was OK.  Pretzel was decent and the shepard's [sic] pie was OK, but we weren't big fans of the sausage rolls.  

At the end of the meal we were getting up to go find a manager and finally our server said \"do you need your check?\"  We spoke to the manager who apologized, but then tried to defend our server THREE TIMES by saying she was busy in the kitchen trying to get our order.  Perhaps they made it wrong and I can understand that -- it happens.  However it's inexcusable to never return to your customers to tell them about delays.  Furthermore, the manager should absolutely not have repeatedly defended the server's actions.  Unbelievable.

We gave her the comp slip and left.  Oddly enough we bumped into the manager later in the casino and she gave the comp slip back.  It's a nice gesture, but probably one that should have happened while we were talking to her in the restaurant, not half an hour later.  She also informed us that this place is shutting down in about a month or so.  

I'm sure our experience isn't indicative of the level of service most people receive here, but still it was pretty awful for us."}
{"text":"Man, I just don't like this place.  I've tried it 3 times now, and every time I leave disappointed.

The food isn't great.  It's an Irish bar, but their Shepherd's pie is bland!  That should be one of their specialties!  Tonight, I had a teriyaki chicken sandwich.  The chicken patty was one of those frozen ones that have the fake grill marks on it and the teriyaki sauce was so salty, I had to scrape it off.  And the drinks aren't that great a price, either.  My glass of house wine was $8!!!!

Also, the service just isn't there.  We waited at least 10 minutes for a waitress to come by, then heard the couple next to us ask for their check.  This is how that conversation went:
\"Hey, we haven't seen our waitress in a long time and need our check.\"
\"OK, what's her name?\"
\"Ummm, I don't know.\"
\"Well, if you don't know her name, I can't get her.\" (umm, wtf?)
\"We just want our check.\"
\"I can't access other people's checks.\"
\"Can you just get a manager to give us our check?\"

...and the waitress walked away.  They were just left there, hopelessly waiting for their waitress to come back.

Just go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I went to this place when it first opened and many times thereafter. I also enjoyed some of the best Irish food to be had in Vegas at Wooloughan.  I went back a few days ago and what a surprise, remember this is supposed to be an Irish Pub, but it was and is no longer such a place. The new place has the same decor but that is where it stops, 
     The menu had a total of 5 Irish dishes on it. The rest were plain bar food, hot dogs,hamburgers, and stuff like that. I ordered potato soup leek soup and got a thin soup with TexasToast !. Asked for soda bread and was told they don't serve that any more.  I ordered corned beef and cabbage and got chopped cabbage,fried in bacon grease and sliced deli corned beef that was over cooked. It WAS AWFUL. 
     If you want Irish food, DO NOT GO HERE."}
{"text":"Had a great time there. Took my Family for some Irish beverages and eats. Sports crowd was a bit rowdy, but we enjoyed everything else. I will return!"}
{"text":"Really really slow service. We waited at least 20 minutes before anyone even acknowledged us. Food is fairly expensive for a bar, and quite mediocre at that. I doubt we'll be going back."}
{"text":"This review is strictly about the food... J.C.'s is a nice pub and is a fun place to hang out with friends...That said, the menu has been pared down significantly.  They used to have an awesome thatch (sp?) salad and more Irish breakfast items.  For \"bar food\" they are fine BUT I wouldn't drive to J.C.'s for the food.  My husband had the fish & chips.  He said the batter was \"gross\". I had their chicken tenders which use to be awesome  (they weren't your ordinary tenders) but now they are sadly, ordinary indeed.  The \"chips\" were nothing to write home about either... My husband ordered the apple crisp desert to go.  He thought that was the best part of the meal.  Our server was very pleasant and confirmed that the menu had been reduced.  

I still prefer J.C.'s to Three Angry Wives atmosphere wise but if Fado's were still open, there would be no contest."}
{"text":"underwhelmed. granted, i haven't had bangers and mash for more than 25 years but after this? i doubt i will anticipate going out for them again. 6.25 for 20 oz of bass is a good deal and my wife (who i have never seen order fish and chips) said the fish and chips and the cosmo were good. as far as authentic irish pub? it looks like they took a picture from a magazine and hired a crew from home depot parking lot to build it (wood trim falling off the wall) .  the band was ridiculously too loud and sounded like cats in a blender. drummer needs an electronic kit so he can turn it down."}
{"text":"Eh. I love me a good Irish bar, and the atmosphere was definitely fun, but the food was just ok. They have a veggie burger that is just ok, nothing fabulous, but definitely edible. I got a side salad instead of french fries and it looked like salad from a bag with 2 tomatoes and a few cucumbers as toppings, it was extremely disappointing."}
{"text":"Good pub food, large portions at a good price, and a nice atmosphere. Most times you can seat yourself. Nuria was a great waitress who always kept an eye on us and our drinks."}
{"text":"This place just. Keeps getting worse by the day! Told myself I wouldn't be back cause the service was awful.  Then they somewhat took care of that only to make this IRISH BAR the least IRISH BAR in town.  Here's a suggestion....if you call yourself an IRISH BAR, how about some authenticity?? Your bands are terrible and your food is anything I can find at any dive bar.  You guys should be ashamed to call yourselves an Irish pub.  Just close down already and make room for anything else that will surely be better than you"}
{"text":"We've been going to Wooloughan's for more than five years, and discovered it even before we decided to move to Vegas.  We like the food a lot, especially the special burger, which has a lot of good seasoning.  DH really likes the Shepherd's Pie.  The best part of the food, though, are those fabulous potato croquettes, which you can get as a side instead of the usual fries that are served everywhere else.  If I could order a plate of those, I might consider killing the diet for them!

Our favorite attraction, though, is John Windsor, a British/Irish singer and guitar player, who's terrific.  He plays on Wednesday and Thursday nights, and does a lot of traditional and fun Irish numbers, as well as a lot of contemporary stuff.  He has a really nice voice and is a very accomplished guitarist.  

My rave for Wooloughan's doesn't extend to the Rampart Casino.  It's close to where we live, so we were going there quite often for our low-roller gambling adventures.  But it took me too long to realize that the Casino does not value its loyal customers.  All those visits and never a single freebie or comp or anything.  Unfortunately, this has translated to many fewer visits to the Pub, since it now requires an AHAH moment to remind us that it's there, it's nearby, and that we haven't been there in a while.

Maybe tomorrow night!"}
{"text":"I came in here looking for something other than a typical Las Vegas buffet and found J.C. Wooloughan. It is a quaint Irish pub that serves great food! 

My husband and I found this cozy nook to sit in that had it's own television. It's nice having privacy after a long day at work! The inside is practically all dark wood . It looked so warm and inviting It made me feel like I was stepping in from the blistering cold into a warm cozy pub. We all know it was like 109 degrees outside though! 

The waiter stopped by to get our drink order. I asked for Mountain Dew he gave me Sprite. My husband said they might have not had Mountain Dew and just replaced it with something equal . In my book nothing is equal to the Dew! I found out later while we were paying our bill that they do have Mountain Dew! It's okay though the waiter was tending bar too so it was an honest mistake. 

The appetizers looked yummy so I ordered those instead of a full meal. I started with the Potato Croquettes which were like fried mashed potatoes . They served them with Ranch sauce and their home made mustard. The mustard was really good! 

I had the Pretzel which was okay it was like the ones you get at the movie theater. They served it with what tasted like a beer cheese sauce. I found myself dipping more into the mustard then the cheese sauce. The sauce tasted too bland for me. 

We ended the meal with Sticky Toffee Pudding . It was plum cake drizzled with warm butter toffee and served with candied walnuts and Devon cream. It was delicious! 

I would want to come back and try their other offerings on the menu like their Steak Tips or their Corned Beef and Cabbage. I'm always up for something new!"}
{"text":"First time here! My boyfriend and I decided to watch the Blackhawks (foul it up) as we heard it was a Chicago bar. Chicago? I am not so sure about that. We had to ask twice to have the volume turned on for hockey. But decent food and service, yes indeed. 

The decor is very irish and they have a stage in the dining area. I like the authentic Irish feel to the place. 

We started off with fried pickles.  I was expecting them to be round sliced pickles but these were large pickle spears.  The breading tasted homemade. I'm not usually a fan of fried food but this stuff was pretty good. 

Our server was Jasmine and she was on top of things the entire evening. Boyfriend and I shared some Dublin nachos next (no meat, natch!) They were not typical irish nachos (thank goodness) - you know the kind, with potato chips instead of tortilla chips. No, this was much better! They were multicolored corn chips and melted cheddar cheese, plus black olives, salsa, guacamole and sour cream.  The guacamole was disappointing. It tasted like it came out of a bag and had zero flavor. The salsa I ate was very mild. My boyfriend had salsa with red pepper flakes and it was pretty good. I didn't overall like the cheese. Why cheddar cheese?? It is the greasiest cheese ever and doesn't seem to belong melted on top of chips. And then it cools off and hardens like shellac. Yuck. 

We were full after the nachos (and I was sick to my stomach watching the Hawks get beat) but overall this was a good experience."}
{"text":"This a cool place to hang out and have a beer. They have excellent fish & chips. It is inside the Rampart Casino. I like to go here in Sundays after I put a few bets in at the sports book on some NFL games. I would recommend you try this place if you like fish & chips."}
{"text":"Good place to stop in for a Guinness! Nice little Irish bar with decent food and drinks. The soft pretzels are a good choice. The service here is kind and prompt."}
{"text":"I love coming to the Rampart to get to this cool little pub. This restaurant is so cool. I just love the feel for some reason. The dark wood tables, the decorations its just so different. Its not a big restaurant, in fact its a bit small, but that just adds to it's charm in my opinion.

Jasmine our waitress was fantastic as always and our food was delicious. I recommend the appetizer platter because it comes with steak strips, onion rings, mozzarella sticks and zucchini sticks which offer a little something for everyone. :)

Its not the café, its not the steakhouse, its an Irish Pub that's what I like about it  :) Totally worth giving it a try :) Enjoy :)"}
{"text":"Had a great lunch here.  I really enjoyed the Shepard's Pie, as well as the outstanding customer service from our server, Rebbie.  She was very knowledgeable of the menu selections and help me and others in our party figure out what the better items were on the menu.   The fish and chips looked really good and I plan to order that the next time."}
{"text":"Two different lunches, same great results. Split pea soup was great, cream of broccoli even better. Rock solid burger, but save room for sticky toffee for dessert. Dependable friendly service - best lunch in hotel"}
{"text":"Pretty underwhelmed.  Service was pretty good and servers offered suggestions, prices are reasonable, however the food was a major let down to me.  I judge an irish restaurant by their corned beef and cabbage and this left much to be desired.  Corned Beef was dry, cabbage was a little undercooked, and I am used to the traditional mashed potatoes.  JC offers fried mashed potatoes and cabbage cooked with bacon.  While this experience wasnt horrible... I have had much much better."}
{"text":"Service was decent--we were in a hurry and were hungry, and the food came out fairly quickly. Our waitress was on it with refilling our water.
Chicken tenders were hot and tasty, minestrone was hot and okay, salmon was cooked well and tasty."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place but sadly I didn't at all!  The food was horrible. I ordered a glass of Cabernet Sauvignon, pretzel and a corned beef sandwich. The best thing I had was the fries. The wine was borderline undrinkable. The pretzel was decent but the cheese sauce was gritty and almost flavorless. The sandwich is where the meal went downhill! First it comes out with soggy bread. The meat is dry and has no flavor. The inside of the sandwich was cold while the rest was burn-your-mouth hot. I took a bite and spit it up because it had a half of an onion on it. Imagine the outermost layer of an onion on your sandwich not sliced at all!  

The whole thing was bad!  The service wasn't horrible but the server wasn't around much! I would rather go hungry then try to eat here again. Yuck!"}
{"text":"I went there for their st. patrick's day kickoff, and it was terrible. I didnt eat the food, but I ordered a smithwicks and guinness black and tan. The bar tender sank the guinness, and left a head that filled half the glass... then tried to serve it to me. When I sent it back she made an excuse about the guinness coming from a new keg and she couldnt make me another one. Then when I complained again, she went to the back to talk to the person in charge. Out walks some Italian guido who tells me that this is how guinness is SUPPOSED to be poured. Being an alchy, ive probably had a pint at 200 different pubs between the UK and US, and i've never seen incompetence like this. How do you own an Irish pub if you cant even pour a proper pint? Never again will I enter this cheap excuse for an irish pub knockoff."}
{"text":"I'm struggling to find something redeeming about JC Wooloughans.  The bartenders were oblivious and when we did place our order it took 15+ minutes whether it was beer or a glass of water - while sitting at the bar.  We asked for menus, which took a while to get too.  So, when we attempted to place our order the bartender told us the kitchen just closed 5 mins ago.  Seriously, wouldn't that have been important info to share when we asked for menus?"}
{"text":"I like the bar...the specials are great for football. It's a fun atmosphere with plenty of room and tvs, and the bertenders are some of the best around!

My gripe is their mnf raffle drawings. It's always 2 jerseys, and somehow for the Lions/Seahawks game it was mysteriously just the Seahawks jersey. As a lions fan I'm used to disappointment,  but there was no lions jersey this week. 
When I asked management about this, the response was \"well, sometimes it's only 1 jersey\". That's not good enough. I was excited for my chance to try to win and had no chance. Consistently would be nice, and I feel pretty let down by the lack of shits given by managment. 
I hope I get a response to this review, and it's better than the one I got from the clueless manager here. 

On a side note, again, the service is fantastic, the bartenders rock, and overall it's pretty nice here."}
{"text":"Great service and an awesome happy hour. For just $5 I got this huge chicken finger basket! It was so big I couldn't even finish it. The waitress was very nice. I didn't expect to find such cheap food in vegas. Not to mention delicious! I am definitely coming back for dinner to try their mac n cheese!"}
{"text":"A good stop on the St Pattys Day pub crawl."}
{"text":"Worst onion soup I had (and it was part of a special), bad service, we never got the dessert (also included in our menu), the ribeye steak was very tough and the mixed vegetable consisted of a spoonful of peas with two thin slices of carrots. We aren't going back there for sure."}
{"text":"Irish pub you say? Ummm...No corned beef hash, no bangers n mash, no shepherds pie. We tried to order an appetizer platter and substitute one of the items on it with an appetizer of the same exact price, and got told a blunt \"No\".

On that same platter, the steak tips were chewy and almost uneatable. Everything else was mediocre at best - not worth the $15 they charged for it. 

I'm still sitting in here finishing my guiness, then I'm outta here.  Never coming back. Good riddance."}
{"text":"The Irish food menu has gone downhill.   The beer is still good and so is the service.  You would expect more from an Irish pub inside a J. W. Marriott.  Food portions are generous.  They make a good stew and the fish and chips aren't bad.  When they have music it gets crowded and crazy with lots of lads and lassies bumping into each other in a noisy venue with little room for dancing.  Go early on St. Pat's Day."}
{"text":"Where every one knows your name! Potato Skins are a must every visit. Bird, Tamara and their colleagues treat me like a VIP. Over the years this has become a special Pub because they have provided great memories. Great Service, Delicious Food, Fun Entertainment. Make it your Cheers!"}
{"text":"They had approximately three Irish dishes on the menu. What a disappointment. The Guinness beef stew was pretty good. The fish and chips left a lot to be desired. The fish was actually tough."}
{"text":"We almost passed up eating at this diamond in the ruff.  We were staying at the Marriott and one night it was late, we didn't feel like going out, so we were picking between the places there... we picked right!  This is a quiet little place tucked away down restaurant row at the Rampart Casino.  While unassuming from the outside and the setup, the food was great!  While I can't say that its the best pub food I've ever eat, its defiantly in my top 3. If you are looking for a decently priced simple place in Vegas with good food, then check it out.  While its probably not worth the drive from the strip just for the eats, its great if you want a change of pace."}
{"text":"This pub is buried deep inside the Marriott in Summerlin, so park your ride in the back of the hotel and you can walk right into the restaurant area without breathing in the exciting smells of a Las Vegas casino floor.

Quaint decor, dark wood  dart boards, it's what you would expect in a reproduction Irish pub. It's fine.

Seat yourself in a booth or table, your choice. We were served by Monika, a delightful server who made us and our angelic boys extremely welcome. 

Food; it's ok, the menu is not large but has the staples expected in an Irish pub. Bangers, Pies, Fish & Chips. I had a steak, nicely cooked with mushrooms and onions and a side of mash. Wifee had sausage rolls which she raved over. Kids had chicken tender/finger/nugget things. What else?


Guinness was cold, there were a table of noisy New Yorkers adjacent who kept us amused. Great night, we will return."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times over the years, and usually used an Entertainment coupon, and the food was always good.
This time I had a $10 food comp, and got the Reuben. They make a decent Reuben, but with not enough 1000 Island for my taste. I like my sandwich swimming in 1000 Island.
My request for extra dressing was met, to my delight. I sat at the bar, as they added gaming 3 or so months ago. So, comped Guinness & Fruli (that's a chocolate strawberry) to boot, that makes my day. And, good luck finding a decent draft at the casino bars. So, I applaud the casino for adding those machines right under the taps! 
There are many beers to choose from here, and for a pseudo beer snob like me, I will be back to try other Guiness concoctions while playing a little poker. 
There was a decent crowd here, and the bartender was busy and took care of me and the one other person at the machines. This really is a quaint, inviting place with better than average food, drinks, and NEW- NOW WITH GAMING!"}
{"text":"Very nice manager (Tamara), pretty nice staff, good whiskey selection (including Scotch), good specials, and definitely the best place to eat at the Rampart Casino. I am staying at the JW Marriott next to the casino. The casino staff will tell you 9 times out of 10 that this is the place to go on the property. The chips or fries are very good. The fish and chips is pretty good but if you are in Las Vegas and love fish and chips, go to Ri Ra at Mandalay Place. The tar tar sauce and coleslaw are nothing special. The breading on the fish is tasty and crisp. The fish is good but only 3 small fingers come underneath the chips. It's a friendly place but tends to get only business conventioneers who tend to be clique-ish. Try the weekend crowd to socialize. I originally gave 3 stars but would like to modify to 4 stars because the price is excellent."}
