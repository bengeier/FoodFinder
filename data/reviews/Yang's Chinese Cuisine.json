{"text":"I would say this restaurant is a BIG SCAM.  Be aware of what you have ordered.  We were there over the weekend and the seafood set menu was ordered.  On the set menu, the lobster should be 4lb; and the geoduck should be 2lb.  Guess what?  After we ordered the food and an order slip was placed on our table; my mom picked it up to check again, the lobster became 6lb and the geoduck became 4lb.  We quickly asked the waitress to verify our order and we were told that they do not have a 4lb lobster and 2lb geoduck available which means that we need to pay extra to make up the difference - that's a $120 extra to the bill!!  The waitress said that a 4lb lobster is too small and it's better to have a bigger lobster - then it quickly came to my mind \"then why is that on the menu and not a 6lb?\"  First of all, if they do not have the size indicated on the menu; they should notify the customer of that so that they can decided whether to go ahead with the size available due to the extra cost.  Second; if a 4lb lobster is on the menu; then they should make that available - if you are saying that they don't recommend a 4lb; then change your menu to a 6lb and don't say things like a 4lb is too small.  Same as the geoduck - 2lb became 4lb?   Anyway - the food - it's just okay.  The geoduck did not seem that fresh and it did not have much taste.  Steamed Chinese yellow eel - again, not much taste and I had better elsewhere.  The lobster - way too salty.  I drank a can of coke for this and even after I got home; I still felt the strong MSG.  We also had shark fin soup, Chinese yellow eel, steamed fish, pigeons, vegetables and souped rice.  I would say I have had way better seafood elsewhere and this meal is totally not worth over $500.  Sorry but never again....."}
{"text":"4.5/5- Came here for dim sum with friends, based on location alone.. the 5 of us spent about $115 including tax and tip! We all left super full and satisfied! Service was fast and the place was relatively clean. Their options were quite good and had a few unique features! The only thing that we missed were a few things that you would find a traditional dim sum like tripe, and that most of their dishes were considered \"large\" or \"extra large\"   They also offer a lobster special, where you can order lobster congee and lobster dumplings for approximately $29.99!  Would definitely go back"}
{"text":"We went here for dinner and noted that the food quality has drastically decline. Vegetables are not cooked, seafood have poor textures, and even the feature lobster dish is poor quality."}
{"text":"Service: The waitress was rude & was not professional at all. She was flicking water at my table without apologizing. She spilled everything on the table and just walked away like nothing happened; didn't bother to clean it. We requested for some utensils however we never got it. I wouldn't come back here again.    Food: The food was not good nor bad. However there were flies all around the table."}
{"text":"The first time I went to this place was when they first opened ..the dimsum was good ..it was quite expensive because it costed us over 100 for four people. The service was good and food was good. It was 4 star.   Today I went there again... They had 3 tables ahead of us and I figured that it should be okay. Since I was waiting, I bought a newspaper ..(there is a story about it :)  While we were waiting, we observed that one of the patrons who was waiting was very anxious and she kept  checking the waiting list. We sort of found it odd but figured she must be very hungry.   After 30 minutes of waiting and saw that the captains and hostess kept sneaking the newly arrived guests in, and leaving us waiting, I realized why that woman was upset.   I do understand that there is a preferred guests system in most places, but at least do it more discretely. Golden abalone does it, Skyview cuisine does etc...but at least they place the waiting clients and preferred clients in an alternate order.   I heard the captains just brought 4 tables in front of us (these patrons talked loud enough that I could hear them ).  The poor hostess was left explaining to a few of us irate clients.   I finally gave up and told them that we are leaving.  Notice to the owner: you may keep all our favorite mainland clients , but once they leave Canada, us locals will not be visiting you. There are better restaurants with better service.  About the newspaper : I found out that the newspaper was from November 28 but they kept in their shelf so that you will pay for garbage. What does it tell you about this place ? They are poorly run and they just want to make a fast buck! Even small restaurants cleaned up their papers  Imagine what their washroom or cleanliness in the restaurant ...  little Things tell you a lot about a restaurant..."}
{"text":"Service has dropped.  Made a reservation for 12noon for 5ppl and still had to wait 20 min to get a table.  What's the point of having a reservation?  Then they twice forgot to bring us our water and tea ...and this was already after our food had arrived.  The standard with dimsum places is to have your hot beverages served right after you sit down, so we were not impressed when they forgot twice.  Not in a rush to visit again."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch with my parents. We didn't get the dim sum but lobster and a few other dishes instead. Overall, the food is kinda meh. Not really outstanding. The prices are okay if you get the specials. However, decor and service are excellent. Maybe I'll come here again.  P.S.-location is a bit isolated (behind a hotel) but there's plenty of parking space."}
{"text":"Made a reservation for noon, waited for 40 mins and our table still wasn't ready. We were given a lot of excuses, but at the end of the day others were sat and we were not. We left as there are plenty of other places to eat in the area which respect reservations. Very disappointing considering Yang's considers themselves \"fine dining\"."}
{"text":"Came here a few time for early bird dim sum (the price has went up from $3 to $3.10) , which, while not awe inspiring, still decent and nicely made. The food arrives hot and quick, so the table is filled with yummy dim sum!"}
{"text":"Awful service. Below average for Chinese cuisine. Plenty of choices in the area. This is a waste of money and time."}
{"text":"Tried both dim sum and dinner here.  Dim sum is rather mediocre for higher end quality dim sum, not worth the drive unless you live nearby.  For dinner it's much better.  Got to try the mountain of lobster with the crunchy garlic bits.  We were all just scooping it up by the spoonfuls.  Forgot your cholesterol pill at home?  Too bad!  Other dishes were also very good too, the steamed whole fish, sweet n sour pork (sauce on the side without me asking, thank you very much!), stir fried veggies.  Cash only, so bring lots if you plan on eating from their wall of fresh seafood tanks."}
{"text":"Just as I've said in previous review, lunch experience were so much better!  It is as different as day and night.  The dim sum were superb, and so were the noodles.  If you order before 11 am, there is the early bird rate.  They also have set lunch seafood menu at special rate which were great.  I will return, only for lunch."}
{"text":"I had a 1.5 hour wait for a table for 4.   There is no time limit, therefore customers are allowed to stay as long as they want and enjoy tea, even after they pay. This causes everyone to wait longer.   I witness many customers leave before even getting to the front of the line to be served. In this dimsum restaurant, it takes 30+ minutes after ordering for food to be delivered.  I ended up wasting a quarter of my day just waiting for food."}
{"text":"Unorganized. Host is useless in managing customers waiting. Told us that there was a table ready and gave it to others. Come here if you have lots of time to wait around. Not good if you're here on your lunch hour."}
{"text":"The Dim Sum at Yang's Chinese Cuisine excites me in a way that is unnatural for Dim Sum to excite a healthy man of my age and \"maturity.\" Yelp GTA Chinese cuisine aficionados Jen K and Wayne C introduced a group of us to the magic that is their $3/item (any size) weekday special (which you must take advantage of before 11AM).  And take advantage we most certainly did!  At first I wasn't too sure about this place, it's basically a really nice looking banquet hall packed with circle tables with one wall lined with tanks for the live crabs and lobsters. It's located in what I think used to be part of Le Parc Banquet hall located just south of Hwy 7 and Leslie in the Markham portion of Thornhill. Le Parc still remains to the right, but Yang's is attached, so be on the look out for both of their signs.  Agreeing with my Singaporean brother from another mother (David L), the standout dishes were DEFINITELY the Har Gow, Sui Mai and the Steamed Chicken Feet with Supreme Sauce - Ya I eat chicken feet, they're gnarly (in a good way).  There were so many dishes that I wish I could remember all the names for BUT, the one constant between all dishes was that the quality was unmatched. Portions of shrimp were abundant, the size of dumplings were easily double many others I've had and even small things like the quality of the flaky pastry used to make several baked items were bakery quality. I noticed this right away.  The bad reviews for this place revolve around their pricy dinner options which can run between $50-80/person, but this isn't an issue if you've got the extra scratch to spare. In terms of Dim Sum, this was easily a top 3 I've ever had in my honest opinion!  Dim Sum Special is CASH ONLY (I was unprepared).  Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"Extremely expensive, but decent place for sea food. Service is one of the most complicated among all other Chinese resturant. Plate change every 15-20 mins. Do not feel bad to stop the server if he tries to take away your plate with a major lobster piece still in there. Haha."}
{"text":"Belated review for a UYE at this location. Perhaps I have become a dim sum snob but even with the early bird pricing ($3/dish) I only found the dishes A-OK. I didn't really find a dish that I can definitely say is above and beyond any other dim sum place which is slightly disappointing from a restaurant that poises itself as a more high end dim sum restaurant. One sort-of stand out was the durian pastry because they were really generous and used a real piece of durian, but I wasn't too impressed with the pastry that surrounded it and found it slightly disappointing. As a result when I contrast it to other high end dim sum places like Skyview or Spring Villa, to me the quality and uniqueness of menu items pale in comparison.  Some positives though is definitely the ample parking. This is one of the few dim sum places where you don't have to get a number and wait for 20 min to get a seat, or circle the parking lot five times to get a parking spot in the middle of nowhere.   In essence, if you hate crowds, aren't too picky or spoiled about your dim sum, and you're willing to wake up early for that early bird special (or you're just ballin' and don't care about paying that much) then this might be the place for you."}
{"text":"Terrible service!! I left them a 13% tip even though they were rude and then on my way out the lady came up to me and said I didn't tip them enough and asked for more money!! Would not recommend and would definitely not come again"}
{"text":"I told my friend I wanted to try out authentic dim sum in the Toronto burbs. So she brought me to Yang's. We came here two days, once time after 3 pm so the dim sum service had ended. So we came back the next day for lunch before my trip out to Montreal. It looks like a Chinese banquet Hall, I felt bad seeing the fish and crustaceans in the congested aquarium- it wasn't something a person craving dim sum wants to see. I put my thoughts aside and made my way to our table. The place was packed!   The menu was hard to read so I didn't order, my friend did. I was in for a surprise - check, dumplings with flavours such a foie gras and truffles. AAAHHH, I know right? I don't think anything could have topped my dim sum experience than this one, I contently finished off my green tea.  Toronto totally does Asian food.. Mic drop."}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday celebration and had the whole restaurant booked out. Honestly food was medicore - ive had much better Alaskan king crab elsewhere. Clean venue though"}
{"text":"Staple in food - no good!  So for early dim sum on the weekend, this place has a special where you can get any S, M, or L dim sum dish for the same price of an S, which is $3 I believe. For a table of 4 guests, we ordered 8 dishes and this was enough. We were satisfied but not super full. It's a very good deal.  Ha gao - steamed shrimp dumplings. When my cousin bit into hers, she discovered a tiny staple in it. Disgusting, how could that get in there? Also a major health hazard as it could have punctured her mouth or tongue. We brought it to the attention of the captain and he offered to replace it. He claimed that it was a staple that was used to secure the bamboo steamers. If you take a look at some photos, the staple is thinner and smaller than those...  The siu mai was okay, nothing special. The taro spring rolls were quite bad. I did not even finish my piece. The skin was very hard. The taro puffs were quite good. The portuguese pies were so so, not as good as the other ones I've had at dim sum here. The rice rolls were okay, and the dumplings with pea tips were pretty good.  For the price, I can't complain. The food was meh to average. As for the staple, I don't think so. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner the night before my wedding with my family of 25. I have to say the food was decent, and the pictures reflect that. However, with only 1/4 of the restaurant full on a friday night, it took them 1.5 hours to get us any food. We ordered at 6pm and didn't get served until 7:30 and we had to go complain when everyone else got their food first. Other tables also got similar dishes, so this was very disappointing.   I usually don't give low stars due to service and base mostly on food quality, but the quality was only a bit above average, so 3 stars tops for dinner. Will not come again, and go to dragon boat instead"}
{"text":"This place is way better than its 2.5 rating (SERIOUSLY?!).  Great dim sum, nice atmosphere, good service.  The con is that it's in the middle of nowhere, I'm pretty sure this area used to be a field when I was in HS circa 2002.  Their har gow with vegetables (they have two types) is better than the plain har gows.  The plain ones are still good, I just enjoy the extra veggies & flavor of the mixed shrimp & veggies.  Everything that had shrimp was delicious.  Large & fresh shrimp in wonderfully made  Their durian puffs are amazing.  In fact, all of their pastries are amazing (kudos to their dim sum pastry chef!).    I'm not sure about other reviews complaining about service.  My mom is pretty demanding in Chinese restaurants and Yang's staff and managers dealt with her in a way that made her happy.  She is not easy to please and very vocal if she is not happy.  We came pretty much at opening time on Saturday morning for dim sum and there were a fair number of open tables, but it quickly became packed.  My aunt told me this place opened up pretty recently and here's to them sticking around until my next visit home!  I would highly recommend this place for dim sum if you have a car."}
{"text":"Came here for dimsum. Expect to wait for a table, especially for smaller tables of two. It took them 30 minutes before the first dish came out too when it was semi busy after 12:30pm on a Saturday, their kitchen was pumping out single dishes verrry slowly. Minus a star for speed.  Dimsum prices are higher than average. Most dishes were L or XL. Costs are L for $5.90 and XL for $8.80 and SP for $9.80 each. Tea is $2pp. We spent $55 after tax/tip for two people and finished six dishes feeling full. They may have pre 11am specials.  Would recommend their har gows (huge and tastes fresh), pan fried seafood crepe (unique and crisp), and runny custard filled glutinous \"dumplings\" (they were definitely not dumplings but rather fried sesame balls - still good but can do with more custard yolk and be careful not to eat them when served to prevent burning your lips like I did). Puffy egg tarts good as always. Curry squid serving was tiny. Everything tasted good so would be 4 stars if not for speed."}

This place is loud; you can barely hear the person sitting across from you without yelling out.  The food overall was so-so.  For the same price, I much prefer other places like Shangri-la, Crown Princess, or Premiere. I'll let the pics speak for itself."}
{"text":"Early bird dim sum here is decent, but dinner is extremely overpriced for what you get. Very small portion sizes, extremely slow service, and the food quality is mediocre at best. Won't be back for dinner..."}
{"text":"I think this restaurant wants to be what O Mei, Fishman Lobster Clubhouse Restaurant, and Fishman Wharf are. They have a lot of special seafood set menus (think Alaskan king crabs, giant lobsters, abalone, oysters, etc.)  Dinner here is pretty expensive, but the food's not bad.   The pork belly in the pork belly and preserved vegetables has the right ratio of meat to fat. It's not too fatty and not too meaty. The meat parts are still tender. I also appreciate that the pork belly is cut into bite sized chunks. There's also plenty of preserved vegetables for mixing into my rice. Yum.  The stewed bitter melon and fish belly had a fairly standard ratio of bitter melon to fish. The bitter melon was a tad strong for me (duh. Bitter melon), but the dish was still quite good.  The green chili peppers and pork neck slices had more green chili peppers than I'd have liked. More pork neck slices are always appreciated. Some of the green chili peppers were not spicy. Some of them were quite spicy. Care to try your luck?  I heard dessert was pretty good, but I didn't try it. Service was also quite good.  These three dishes plus rice came to $74 something before tax. Thankfully, I had a $75 gift card."}
{"text":"The restaurant is good, seems like their Chef is a really dedicated person who spends its time experimenting new stuff for its customers.  Overall rating: Place: Pretty simple Chinese Restaurant, the decoration could be better but it's a secondary thing for me.  Service: Very friendly Staff, the chef knows my family and came out often explaining what he did, how he cooked the dishes, and so.  Food: We tried all the specials regarding with Sea Food. All type of cooking methods and favours about Lobster and King Crabs. Some were good some were ok.  Final Comments: This place worth to go for groups, is like those typical Chinese restaurants where you will enjoy chatting and family reunions. The food is not bad at all and you will have a good experience for sure."}
{"text":"Came here to try their dinner on a Thursday night. We got the $168 combo which included half a soy chicken, malay oyster pot, broccoli stir fry with lap cheung, 4 lb lobster, steamed eel, and sweet and pork. When we went they didnt have eel so we got the steam tofu with some sort of seafood instead. Out of the entire meal, that was the most disapponting dish. Everything else was amazing. We changed the cooking method of the lobster to maggie sauce instead. The lobster was so fresh and cooked to perfection. I really enjoyed the oyster as well, a bit salty but goes really well with rice. Everything was good. Their portions are a bit smaller than other restuarants but the flavour and quality of ingredients were on point. Service was friendly and they kept changing our platea every 5 minutes lol. The dessert was amazing. It was red bean soup with taro. So good. The entire meal including tax and tips was $210. I will definitely try their other seafoos combo next time."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with family on a quiet Tuesday night.   Food - taste and quality ok. I would say comparable to most of the well known Chinese restaurants out there. Portion size is relatively smaller. We ordered a 8 ppl meal and had to order 2 more dishes for 9 ppl and some of us still left feeling hungry. I was pretty surprised by how small the dishes were given my experience with places such as Skyview and O Mei  Service - not so good. The place was relatively quiet and well staffed (about 6 - 7 staff serving just 5 tables). However, they all seem to be blind. It's one of those situations where you are at your seat waving your hand in big motion and the staff seems to look through you when they walk past you. When you do get their attention, they will come over and literally throw plates and food down on your table. When I was looking at the menu to order, the one lady staff kept on standing behind me pressuring me to order the most expensive meal out there, even though I already politely asked her a few times to give me some time to look through the menu.   Price - everything requires extra cost. Omg... I can't remember the last time I heard a staff say this to me as many times as I did here. Changing the type of veggie = $8 extra, changing the cooking method of lobster = $8 extra, blah blah blah blah, paying with credit card on a set meal of $598 is 5% extra ....wow! The last time I heard, the interchange fee for credit card payment is not 5%. They tried to up-sell me by saying they didn't have any 6lb lobsters available and I had to pay more. I insisted that I would not pay more and finally they gave me a 6lb one. At the end, they had the guts to over charge me $80 or something I didn't even order. Talk about cash hungry owners and staff!   Overall, I'm confident I will not be coming back again and wouldn't recommend this place to my friends. Ps: for some odd reason, there were so many Mosquitos and flies flying around all the time during dinner. I actually for a few mosquito bites on my body."}

{"text":"Went here for brunch on this very busy Chinese New Year Day with my family. We came here at around like 12:10 pm. The wait wasn't TOO bad, but we still had to wait at least 40 minutes (if not longer). What really frustrated me was that they served people who made reservations AFTER we came. So basically they got tables before us which come on that doesn't sound fair at all. I would understand if these people made reservations a few hours earlier or something like that, but no they literally called in 5 minutes before they came, and got tables. Am I being overly diva for thinking that is wrong? Like we came here before their calls, so why do we have to wait extra long for our tables? A big BOOOOOO to the woman who was in charge of the front desk cause you're a turd. Also, she gave us attitude like HOLD UP WUH?!? HOLD MY EARRINGS GORL YOU ABOUT TO GET SMACKED.  Anyways, food wise it wasn't too bad. Here's a list of what I ate and thought of them: 1. Steamed Seafood Dumpling in Supreme Soup with Shark's Fin - mediocre - this seemed like a rather big portion (it's usually quite small at other places) - soup was good, but the dumpling itself was disappointing - it was so dry and overcooked - the dumpling skin was like RUBBER - too salty  2. Steamed House Special Shrimp Dumpling - okay - way too oily .... (literally the sheet at the bottom was drenched in oil; its fking disgusting) - pretty big, pretty worth it  3. Stuffed Chili Peppers - pretty good but could have been better with a little bit more salt to knock up the flavours  - it wasn't served hot...it was like warm, but more on the cool side of warm - stuffed with minced shrimp which was interesting (cause its usually like fish paste)  4. Fried Rice Noodle with Beef and Vegetables - it's alright - pretty standard - i felt like for $18 they couldve been more generous with the amount they gave us; they served it on such a big plate, but there wasn't a whole lot - beef was meh. - i mixed the noodle with a bit of mustard and surprisingly it wasn't too bad   5. Double Doiled Milk - gross  6. Mango Pudding - gross - 100% do not recommend - gross  These items with a few others (I didn't try), it came to a whopping total of $157 which was pretty damn expensive ngl. I could've went to a buffet or AYCE restaurant, but whatever. Would I come again? Meh, not really. While the food was okay, the service was questionable. Don't get me wrong, there were a few good servers. (Shoutout to the girl with red lipstick and a ponytail cause you rock mate and one of the older male servers with the pink short-sleeved shirt you rock too!) But the woman at the front desk was a literal turd. Oh yeah, I wanted to mention something about the teapot thing. I was literally in awe when I saw them have a candle burning underneath the teapot cause like !?!?? WOW WARM TEA IS AMAZING. BRIlliANT A+ INNOVATIVE WOO COOL"}
{"text":"I won't probably go back any time soon.. unless someone else organize a dim sum there.. However, I will stop suggesting going to this place or even organize any future dim sum events .. after the atrocious customer service that was provided by one of the so-called manager..  We were a group of 11 people and all I asked was simply if we could sit inside one of their private room because it seems to be so noisy outside and they pretty much have space and wasn't busy at all since it was so early .. I was a supporter for this establishment and it isn't the first time I went there ...actually, I went there a few times with big groups and never really had any trouble sitting inside a private room (meaning a regular)  and therefore, what was the big deal.. also, I knew the room wouldn't be all completely private and we had to share with a few tables.. which was fine by me..and usually when the place is super busy they would allow their customers to sit in the private rooms with no minimum charge,.. no big deal, rite?  but nope..  they told me.. I had to spend literally $300 for dim sum if I wanted the private room and they told me that was the same case of the other group that supposedly reserved the private table for 11 people and was told that the reason they could sit in the private room because they made a reservations and a commitment to spend $500 (that was a table with kids!) and that person literally walked in like 10 seconds before me but that person was able to get the private room table.. give me a break!  Resto had no reservations that day for the big tables and I simply do not understand the restaurant logic with the so-called minimum spending behind many of these Chinese restaurants when you want a room .     we all know that no one in their right mind will spend $300 to $500 for dim sum alone.. A big group comes to your establishment and is ready to spend a lot of money..one thing you could have done is give the private room upon request.. if the customer asked.  I have been to so many establishments which had no trouble giving me a separate room with a table..just by simply asking and not being told to having to spend a minimum of a certain amount.. and even if there was a minimum spending,  it would be waived ...  THough I like their dim sum and their establismenta bit of a high class,  I am not willing to go back any time soon.. There are simply too many other good dim sum places that I can go to.. I organize a least  many dim sum a year..   and this is one that will be put off on my list..  I will bring my business elsewhere..I was also planning to bring my out of town family but forget it!!!"}
{"text":"I booked a week in advance for this place for a family birthday and was hoping to change my thoughts on the horrible reviews and unfortunately that was not the case. It should stay as 2 stars and/or below...I was sitting at 3 stars until the end of the meal which deduct a star...  We were seated in a table and knowing this would be a seafood replica close to all fisherman's lobster clubhouse and all those million other ones out there...we ordered a 3 person meal for 4 adults and 2 kids....the amount of food could feed another adult in my opinion...  The service wasn't attentive as I had to wave my hand a few times before I was being attended to. When people always ask why I tip chinese places lower, here is the reason why..they don't give a crap about service unlike any other canadian place I go to...where they are attentive, courteous and pretend to care about their jobs even if they don't truly...  been here once for dim sum and once for dinner so I can pretty much rate it...2 stars is fully due to my generosity...  The food came out and the time was on par with each plate...I find that they fried alot of the foods so it is quite difficult to know the actual taste of things...as it was likely drenched in oil...  I was not informed that we had to pay in CASH when I booked and I didn't have enough cash on me. I asked if I can use debit and/or credit card but they said it would be 5% on top of the bill...I WAS LIKE \"WHAAA..? CC companies only charge the vendors 3% so they are making 2% from me for paying by CC\" how does that logic work again?  So my friend had enough cash (quite embarassing) for me and I had to go to the bank to get money to pay her back....just when we were about to leave, one of the ladies came back and said we didn't pay enough. I was like \"WHATT...our bill was $305, WE PAID $330\" SHE SAID ITS NOT QUITE 10% TIP...i was ready to flip...is it legally written that we need to tip 10%, I tipped less cuz your service sucked....and they were being so loud about it..so we just left an extra $10 and left.....  if you are ready for bad service and mediocre food, you have found the place....let me present YANG'S CHINESE CUISINE....LOL!!!"}
{"text":"I came here for dinner twice.  I have the same thoughts as the other posts alleging that that scam you on the weight on the seafood.  Service is ok.  Check your bill carefully as our waitress tried to convince us tips is never included when it clearly says it did.  Food is decent."}
{"text":"Came here two times for dim sums.  To be honest, the dim sum is not wow but definitely good enough for when I am  craving for dim sum.  The food quality is pretty even.  The service is so far way acceptable to me.  They have early bird $3 each for S/M/L dim sum.  Some other places do offer better deal of their early bird, but those places would always be crazily packed with long waiting time.   The Crown Prince Fine Dining is my favorite dim sum place but I will choose to come here if I don't want to wait in line and struggle in parking."}
{"text":"Epic fail. Made a reservation a week before for the following Sunday, came in on Friday to check and confirm the reservation. On Sunday arrived 15 mins before the reservation, hostess gave me a number, asked me to wait. 45 mins later, (30 mins after the reservation time) - the hostess called the number after me. I asked her what was going on and she said she wanted to give me a table but it had no chairs. Why accept reservations if you won't honour them??  I saw an older lady slip a red a pocket into the hostess' pocket - and she got a table right away.  I asked the hostess what's going on and why the other party was seated before us, all she could say was \"sorry\". Basically we were SOL.  Not ever going back. Extremely disappointing experience."}
{"text":"Good food & very good service but over priced. We had the UK style Lobster & King Crab combo with a veggie dish and soup. Bill became $700 including tips bc they didn't have smaller lobster & King Crab. Restaurant was 1/2 empty. Better value & price at Fisherman's Clubhouse Seafood where this meal would only cost $400-500 only max."}
{"text":"We made reservations for dim sum and the restaurant did not bother to write down our name so it was almost as if we did not make reservations. We waited for a while and eventually our group was the last one to get seated.   Overall the aesthetics of the food was nice, however there was not much taste to the food. It seemed like they forgot to add salt to a lot of the food we ordered. It's safe to say my family would be okay if we never went there again."}
{"text":"I would give it a big zero if I get to pick. Obviously this is another restaurant trying to gain some high price market share by marketing their lobsters, geoduck and seafood dishes.  Don't even try their regular dishes and they won't do them right. Ironically even their steam fish wasn't done right.  I understand they are from the same group as the Yang's restaurant on Bayview. However this place is no comparison to that one, in terms of service and food quality.  There are many other better seafood restaurants around if I crave for great lobsters, geoduck, and abalone dishes.  I would avoid this one once and for all."}
{"text":"They sell quality traditional dim sums.  The quality is comparable to Dragon Boat in Richmond Hill.  Prices are really high, unless you order before 11am.  It is still cheaper than Elegance on Warden, though."}
{"text":"I had a completely disappointing experience on my last visit because of their service. I made reservations over 2 weeks ago for the private room that seats 20 on table. A couple of days prior to my reservation I called to confirm that it was still available which they said it was. When I arrived, they forgot about my reservation and tried to make excuses that they do not take reservations. We pointed out our reservations on the list and advised that we have booked the room before. I am giving them 2 stars because the food was still good."}
{"text":"We had the king crab and lobster special, and the food was delicious! Would go back again. Service was great too!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday morning. You have to make a reservation or else you will be waiting for 30mins or more. Came with 5 people and it was great!! Loved all the dishes we got . Especially loved the flavours of the truffled dumpling."}
{"text":"A group of friends (20) want to have Chinese tea gathering.  We end up going to Yang's Chinese restaurant.  They serve typical Chinese dim sum that is similar to other Chinese restaurant with similar taste and quality.  However there's one thing I don't like about this restaurant.  We came here with a VIP card thinking we will have 10% off plus chinese tea charge waived.  However when we looked at the bill, only 50% off for the Chinese tea charge plus they charge us each and everyone for hot sauce.  Each table only have 1 small plate of hot sauce but they charge each person $1 dollar for the hot sauce.  Total $20 dollars.  Other Chinese restaurant would never charge hot sauce.  Plus only takes cash and no credit card or debit card.  I feel it was a big scam and would never want to come back again."}
{"text":"Good value at $3 an item on weekdays for dim sum.  I'd call this place unremarkable as I had no recollection of having been there before for a special occasion (one month dinner).  The food was good, service was standard and the dining room was bright and clean. China was nicer than usual at dim sum.  We had a lot of food for nine people, but I didn't sample everything: Har gau Siu mai Turnip cake Deep fried shrimp wontons Chinese sausage steamed bun Meat pie (baked, chicken and turmeric filling) Cheung fun - beef and shrimp  Squid tentacles Bread donuts Deep fried tofu/eggplant with shrimp Chicken feet Fried rice vermicelli noodles with beef and greens - this was crunchy and delicious Rice"}
{"text":"Was back in the GTA for one day and had to go for dim sum before going back to Winnipeg. I let my parents decide as I haven't been back in the city for months.  The prices here are higher than other dim sum places I've been to, however they do have weekday specials that you can take advantage of. The place was also busy for the lunch crowd, which made sense given the plethora of offices nearby.  As for the food, however, I didn't find anything stand out. The siu mai and glutinous rice were great, as well as the curry octopus. The beef tripe was not as great, and I found the rice rolls to be too thick. Everything else we had ranged between \"meh\" and \"A-OK\".  Service was definitely lacklustre from start to finish, and it took over 20 minutes for us to get our bill. Considering I was heading to the airport right after, I was definitely in a huge rush t the end.  If you have over an hour to kill, this place isn't bad. However if you're looking to finish dining in an hour, I suggest looking beyond this place."}
{"text":"Socially pricey.  Fresh ingredients. Quality food. Nice decor. Seafood called just right.  Friendly service.  Good selection on menu.  Will come again."}
{"text":"Came here for morning dim sum on a Thursday..   Sat down with mom and grandpa who was visiting from HK..   Ordered about 11 dishes.. Bill came to $65.. I took the bill up to the cashier quickly to pay, cashier took my money.. Put it into the cash register.. And I'm thinking mission accomplished, I paid for the bill, this is a Chinese thing to fight for the bill during dim.. Grandpa was like let me pay for it.. I'm like no, I already paid. Cashier got annoyed that we were fighting to pay for the bill and got grumpy.. Gave me back money and took grandpa's money instead... And told us thank you which means it was the end of it.. wTF!!  The food was average I my opinion...   I would say the \"ha gaw\" were super big and the shrimp inside was nice and \"springy\" but the wrapper was ok.. This was the only dish that stood out as good in my opinion..  Dishes that stood out as bad which we didn't finish not pack to take-out were cha Sui bun, toro springs, and especially the beef tendon"}
{"text":"The wait for a table was about 20 minutes, which wasnt too bad, but the service while seated was missing... We asked for hot sauce twice and by the end of our meal there was still not hot sauce. Dim sum here is suuuuper pricey compared to other places. My favourite was the salted yolk in deep fried balls."}
{"text":"Came here for dim sum on a Thursday morning with relatives. We didn't need reservations (but probably wise to do so on weekends) and because it was before 11am, we were able to get the early bird specials $3 for S/M/L dim sum.   Ordered Steamed dumpling with pea sprouts leaves & king mushrooms - this was my fav! Almost had the entire one myself.... Steamed glutinous rice with dried scallops wrapped w/ lotus leaves - great Steamed chicken feet w/ supreme sauce - didn't eat it but looked good Steamed shrimp dumplings - great  Deep fried taro spring roll - great Pan fried bun w/ beef tenderloin in abalone sauce - can't comment didn't eat it Congee w/ dried oyster - loved this  The food came out very fast and it was excellent. My fav was probably the congee with the oyster & the steamed pea sprouts. We all had a great time at lunch. We were always taken care of and I believe all tables were as well. The manager Ben also stopped by our table and we got a 10% off card for future visits.   I'm definitely coming back. Good food and service! No problems finding parking.  The decor isn't tacky. I mean there is still gold... but at least it's not covered in the ugly red we normally see at Chinese restaurants. I could see people having a wedding reception or even a 100 days baby banquet here. Enough for 20 tables."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the fancy décor of the place and the live seafood at the front of the restaurant.  This restaurant may look appear to be a high class establishment, but their service and attitude are worse than any fast food place I have been to.  We were a party of 8 people on a Sunday night.  We placed our order at 6:50 pm.  After half an hour we asked three different servers to check on our order. We had to ask three different people because the first two did not come back to us with an answer.  The manager explained that our order had not reached the chef yet as there were several larger tables that ordered the set menu (more expensive) ahead of us.    We asked to have the rice served immediately as there were hungry children at the table that needed to eat.  Well that didn't happen either, and the first dish came out at 7:50 pm exactly ONE HOUR LATER. In summary, a flimsy excuse and no action taken.  Given that this was a service issue, our tip reflected this.  Our waiter had the nerve to tell us that the tip was not sufficient.  REALLY???? Apparently the concept of tipping based on service has eluded this place and clearly, this guy knows no shame.  There are so many good Chinese restaurants out there, the food here was average.  Bypass this place and spend your money elsewhere."}
{"text":"The service here is better than other Chinese restaurants but one thing that never fails at any Chinese restaurants is, you make a reservation but still have to wait 30 mins.   I find the taste of the dim sum to be inconsistent. There are certain dishes that's tastes amazing while others are quite salty. The price is also a bit on the high side. We had 16 dishes mostly M and L sizes with a couple of XL and the bill came up to be $113 excluding gratuity."}
{"text":"So apparently Yang's had an old location, but this review is for the new location (Hwy 7/Leslie) and the dim sum here is off the chain! It's definitely a hidden treasure amongst some heavyweights like Ballroom and Dragonboat, but I can assure you, it's very legit!  I was not disappointed with any of the items we ordered. From unique items like shrimp and foie gras dumplings, to perfectly braised tripe and tendon, I haven't been to a dim sum place in a while that left me this satisfied. Make sure to get the egg yolk filled steam buns too for dessert!   The space itself was well decorated and chic, with   a couple private rooms/dividers for more intimate gatherings.   Would like to come back and try the seafood special dinners they hold once in a while."}
{"text":"its'a nice place but they don't over fancy dim sum. the durian dessert is bomb. sorry to those who can't stand the smell but sat in the table next to mine."}
{"text":"There is a reason why we drive all the way from Mississauga to have dim sum at Yang's - it's cuz the food is AWESOME! We always complain that there's no good dim sum place in Mississauga, and as a result, we don't mind the hour-long drive for good food. We try to place our order before 11:00 am to get the early bird special (all small, medium, and large dishes are charged at the small dish price). My fav is the shrimp ball covered with almond slices. Their rice noodles are fresh, congee is nice and thick, deep fried shrimp dumpling is always hot and crispy and is packed with shrimp. If only this restaurant was closer - I would go every week! The decor is modern with chandeliers and high ceilings, without being tacky, service is excellent - the waiters are attentive and comes to refill our teapot frequently. First Markham place is close by, so there's a place to walk off the dim sum afterwards :)"}
{"text":"4.5 star  This review is based on Early Bird dim sum special before 11 am $3 for S/M/L at this newest Chinese restaurant in Richmond Hill.  Yang's Chinese Cuisine used to be Yang's Izakaya. The change over is definitely for the better, much better. The interior's decoration is just impressive: high ceiling and  everything so plushy!  The dim sum we ordered were all well prepared with care. Some of them has a much delicate flavour with no MSG.   ????? (L) Steamed House Special Shrimp Dumplings ????? (L) Steamed Shiu Mai with Minced Shrimp and Roe ???? (M) Steamed Dumpling in Chiu Chow Style ????? (M)Steamed Chicken Feet with Supreme Sauce ?????? (L) Stuffed Melon Ring with Dried Scallop ????? (L) Steamed Yam Roll with Mushroom ????? (L) Steamed Rice Roll with Shrimp ????? (L) Black Sesame Glutnious Rice Balls ????? (L) Malaysian Durian Pastry - this is so good with \"Real\" durian!  Service here is extraordinary good. Everyone so polite and I never need to wave down anyone for service! Someone even came over and changed my dirty plates!  For dinner, the menu is mainly made up of fresh seafood set of crab, lobster and seafood. A little pricier than other similar restaurant: Omei or Fisherman but maybe worth the extra $ for a more upscale experience.  Cash or Debit only for the the time being as they are in the process of setting up their credit card payment system.  And for sure I will have to wake up early for some more Early Bird Special!"}
{"text":"Came here for a UYE organized by Jennifer K together with a bunch of Yelpers.  Who can say no to Dim Sum specials!  We tried quite a large selection of dishes as you can see from my pics...  The stand out dish was the har gow (Shrimp dumplings) which was spectacularly large with pretty large shrimp in them. Larger than most places that I have been to.  There was not one bad dish amongst the 3 dozen of so we had.  Let's just say it is definitely worth the drive from Mississauga!!"}
{"text":"We were here for dim sum this weekend. The room was nice, and we showed up early so it wasn't very hectic. Service was friendly, above average for dim sum, and there were no problems having kids at the table, including one high chair.  The food was above average too. Ha gow were packed with springy shrimp. The kids loved the BBQ steam buns. The tea was strong and excellent.  However, this place is really expensive. $100 for two adults and a few kids. Even worse, we felt a little misled. Their website prominently advertises early bird prices, weekends included. However, we were told when we got our bill that this deal is no longer honoured. Take it off the website then! We won't be back."}
{"text":"We waited quite long on a Saturday afternoon, which was surprising because it wasn't even the early bird special.  The decor and vibe is definitely more upscale, this isn't some hole in the wall spadina Chinatown dimsum place. I actually thoroughly enjoyed their tea. Not sure if the water was at the right temperature or the leaves were of good quality but i could really taste the difference.  Food was good, but not likely worth the outrageous prices. Btw prices aren't even listed on the sheet, I only found them out from another Yelp post"}
{"text":"This place should be ranked higher but this one experience ruined it for me. I have been there many times for dim sum and dinner and it is ok but on the pricy side. The bad experience came from one dinner, where I know it wasn't going to be great since there was a wedding going on in the other half of the restaurant. The first dish came out after 1hr of ordering...they started to tease us by bringing our gloves and wipes for our lobster but food was no where close to being served. When our lobster came, I was fortunate to get the claw...which was extremely raw...to a point where the meat was still translucent. So obviously we told them to take it back, but they said it was only the claws that were on the raw side and they will recook the raw ones. When the recook parts came back, to my surprise everything smell like dish detergent or bleach. Instantly had to toss all those pieces.   From this one experience, would I really recommend people coming? No. Food should not smell like bleach in any way."}
{"text":"I used to come here at least once a month for dim sum. Moving forward, it'll be zero times a month.   I came here the other day for dim sum. I waited 50 mins to get a seat (wtf), 25 mins until we finally sat and our food was delivered to our table, and another 15 mins until we finally got our bill. The service here is absolutely dreadful, they seat the people they know first (despite all the other people waiting patiently in line) and they wouldn't know good customer service if it bit them in the ass.   Don't come to this shitty dim sum place, there are plenty of better ones in the area and just a short drive away."}
{"text":"Service sucks right at the door! don't ever come here unless you know someone that works there. We got a number with 2 tables before us. 3 tables came up and only called one number.  The rest of the tables went to 'buddies' at the door."}
{"text":"A reservation at 7pm means you 'make a table available at that time', not \"I think I'll give the table to 'MY FRIENDS FIRST\" jerks. waited 45 minutes for our reservation. Was told other customers had reservations as well. Don't lie to me... I understand cantonese and that crappy Taiwanese mandarin you guys throw around.   We overheard everything.  You'd think with the prices these guys charge and the attitude they have, the food would be great. Not so....  Flavour shouldn't be 'salty or saltier' and texture shouldn't be greasier than the last plate. If you like decent food at a decent price go elsewhere... Markham has a lot of nice places. If you like to partake in circle-jerking staff who are all self-congratulatory and disrespects the customers, then go here."}
