{"text":"Wonderful food at a reasonable price. Great vegan options as well!!! The location is a bit hard to see from the road but it is worth looking out for."}
{"text":"Absolutely outstanding. The quality of food is beyond reproach. Huge portions, fair price, great service, and delicious. While there is an option to sit and eat, the space is very limited. I highly suggest take out."}
{"text":"So happy there is another Thai place in this area. Our fave is drunken noodles and pad Thai for the kids. Fast, friendly, delicious, and inexpensive. New go-to."}
{"text":"Great food ... as close to authentic as you get in Ohio suburbs! Will go back again and recommend. This place has become my local favorite"}
{"text":"What a treasure! So glad we stopped by this little restaurant in a strip mall. The food tasted super fresh and flavorful, seemed homemade. We had pad Thai and vegan drunken noodles with soy chicken- both were excellent! Portions were also large. Great service, great value. Bubble Thai tea and Thai iced coffee were also excellent, with tender bubbles and fresh tasting tea and coffee. Definitely worth the few minutes' detour if you're driving through town on 90. Best Thai I've had in Ohio."}
{"text":"I have tried their foods today. It's tasty and fresh cook. You won't regret."}
{"text":"I was so impressed!! I'm hooked on Pho and I couldn't believe how well they make it. Also, I was able to order delivery through Uber eats. When it was delivered it was still piping hot. With the pho, they separated the broth and noodles which tuned out perfect once mixed together. The seasonal veggies were so fresh and steamed. There was so much food!! So delicious! I'm in trouble that I can get such great food delivered to my door!"}
{"text":"Anyone who knows me, knows I love and smash Thai food. I travel for work all over the country and have easily eaten at 100 Thai spots. I have eaten here about five times and have been really happy with the food. Very authentic flavors and no joke spicy (if you want it). All of my meals I've had here  can hang with the top 10% of places I've eaten at easily. We are really lucky to have this right in our backyard, just wish I ate out more when home."}
{"text":"I stopped in at 999 for a take out menu and ended up ordering mango with sticky rice and a scallion pancake. The food was delicious!  I can't wait to go back for pad thai!  Very clean place and good communication."}
{"text":"I visited Thai 999 Express when in town for work and was very pleased. I ordered the Tom Kha soup, veggie stir fry wok, sticky rice with mango and Thai iced tea. Coming from someone who eats Thai frequently on business trips, I can confirm that everything was delicious and very well made. I will definitely return here next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Delicious and so quick. Get the drunken noodle. Spicy and just enough to not feel.like you're going to explode afterward."}
{"text":"We had the yellow curry, had Thai, some soup and fried rice. I thought all of the dishes were too salty."}
{"text":"This is a great spot to get Thai take out.  We ordered shrimp dumplings, pad Thai with chicken and massaman curry with mixed seafood.  Everything was excellent!  Large portions so we had plenty leftover for lunch the next day. My only disappointment was with the shrimp dumplings.  They were shumai and not what I think of as dumplings. So even though you get 7 of them, it's just a few little bites.  They were tasty, but I don't think I would order that again.   However we were so glad we found this place and we will definitely order from them again!  Fast, friendly service and great food."}
{"text":"This place is very reasonably priced. Clean inside. Quick service. Amazing, traditional Thai food. Vegan and vegetarian options available."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! Omg their Thai bubble tea is delicious! I drink it and immediately want another one . I had the pho and it was great! The owner is such a sweet lady!! Try it out!"}
{"text":"Amazing food (got the Drunken Pad Thai 9.8/10), polite, and 10 minutes from call to pick up! You get to customize the spiciness of the dishes. Additionally, the various vegetables were tastefully seasoned and cooked so they had a very nice texture. Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"I still have no idea if you're supposed to call this place Thai 9-9-9 or Thai triple 9 or Thai 9 cubed but regardless it rocks. They have a ton of menu options and good sized portions with friendly service."}
{"text":"Pad Gra Pow Kai Dow.  I try a lot of food and new places. But let me tell you this Ground chicken in a spicy Thai basil sauce with peppers, carrots, onions, w a fried egg is to die for!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is terrific! There are quite a lot of gluten free and vegetarian options too. Everything I have tried has been amazing. You won't be sorry. There are only a couple of tables so it is primarily a take out spot.  Super friendly service too. I am going to try and remember to take a picture of the food one of these days, but it is so good that when it comes I always forget about the pictures!"}
{"text":"This place is right by my boyfriends old place. I've frequented the plaza it's in but never would have noticed this place because the sign was so small. I heard from Facebook about it and that they had an entire vegan menu and could actually make additional items vegan on request. I'd never had tai food before this but was very pleased. Lots of veggies, option for brown rice and the sauces were delicious. The food tasted really fresh. The girls that were working were super friendly and helpful and the food was amazing. I only wish it wasn't a 20 minute drive from my place. I can't want to have it again."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Thai restaurants in 40 miles. I consider myself something of a Thai food Aficionado and this stacks up against any  Thai restaurant in the area. The owner is a sweetheart and will accommodate you in any way she can. This is primarily a takeout location, however, they do have two tables where you can sit and enjoy the food right where it's made. Can't recommend this place more highly. I had the pad thai noodles a number 2 spiciness and they were perfect. My son, who likes a little spicier, had Drunken Noodles number 4. Another at our table ordered the basil chicken and this is a repeat for him every time he comes. Give this place a try. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Perfect for what I like. My first steamy food pics taste as good as they look. Summer rolls with chicken skewers at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"This place was so great! They offer a full vegan menu as well as the regular menu and every dish our group ordered was delicious. Very clean and fresh tasting with a wide variety of vegetables in every dish, plus brown rice as an option for everything including the fried rice - so much healthier! Such a great find and incredibly well priced. Wish I lived in the area so I could make this a regular spot!"}
{"text":"Absolute gem. Whenever I'm in the area I WILL go here. VEGAN MENU! The vegan pho is amazing with veggies"}
{"text":"Excellent choice! Great fresh food full of flavor and the right amount of spices. We had fried rice with crispy chicken, green curry with jasmine rice and drunken noodles: all were outstanding and unique. Small seating area; next time we might do take out"}
{"text":"Honestly I'm shocked at the great reviews. The vegan pho is terrible. Absolutely flavorless. Have you ever tried Bowl of Pho in Woodmere or Superior Pho in Cleveland? That's Pho! This was terrible. We will not be back."}
{"text":"Mainly take-out very small \"dining\" area next to counter. Good selection of items on menu including vegan/ GF. If you want it spicy make sure you tell them extra spicy. I had the drunken pad Thai with scallops and it was pretty good. I know it's a noodle dish, but it was 93% noodles. I'd like to go back and try the crispy duck, just worried it won't be crispy by the time I get it home. It's good, glad we have another Thai option in Lake County."}
{"text":"We got take out for the family here. I love that they have a vegetarian and meat menu. I'm a vegetarian and the family eats meat so it's nice to have a spot that pleases everyone.   I've tried a few things but the drunken noodles are solid and I love the rice paper rolls. The pineapple rice was amazing. The food is great for left overs.   If you like spice, this place is no joke. I tried a 3 and I like heat and it was hot. I loved it but people that don't like spicy may have a problem.   Overall it's great to have a Thai place that is healthy and so close!"}
{"text":"Finally great Thai without having to drive to Pepperpike. This place is amazing and fresh and clean! The prices are great. They don't mess around with the spice levels. I asked for a 3 and it was intense (and I like spice). So excited for this new option in Concord. Love the fact they have a Vegan menu, finally someone understands that fish and oyster sauce are not vegetarian/vegan.   Wish they would carry bubble tea."}
{"text":"Probably the best Thai food in town!"}
