{"text":"So today we got cupcakes from this bakery, and I'm not sure I'd do it again. The cake flavor we tried were chocolate, vanilla, and red velvet. The red velvet was best flavored but was dry. The icing on the red velvet was good, and it tasted homemade. That could be good or bad if you're like me and could have made that at home and wanted something more from a bakery. The vanilla cake tasted like a pretty good from scratch recipe, which again depends on what you're looking for. The chocolate cake was under mixed and had little white clumps in it, and had a crunch on it that we determined to be caused by over baking. Over all, my favorite part was the cream cheese/ powdered sugar frosting. But I don't think I'll go back again, because it's just underwhelming."}
{"text":"My friend loves this place and she brought me here today for the first time and the cheesecake they make is amazing. I will be coming back for sure."}
{"text":"I love the openness and space inside the building. That's about all I loved. The employees weren't rude but they certainly weren't friendly. They have an area set up for kids but seemed annoyed that we had kids playing there. Also, having an area set up for kids, I was expecting to find a diaper changer in the bathroom but there was not. I'm a scone fanatic and the one I had was well cooked but flavorless. My kids split a chocolate chip cookie and neither of them finished...a definite first for them. If it was just the sub-par food, I would go again and try something else but the chilly customer service was enough to keep me away."}
{"text":"I called the bakery requesting a carrot cake, 2 days before I needed it for Easter. The Girls were fabulous and accommodating & when my 9 months pregnant brain forgot to pick up the cake they kindly called before closing to remind me! They were gracious to wait a few minutes past closing for me to arrive. The cake, it was amazing and it looked just as good. No one was as excited about carrot cake as I was but the whole family had at least 1 piece. It was delicious! I will definitely be returning to 2 Girls for any bakery needs I may have in the future."}
{"text":"Service is fast and friendly and the food is great.  I had the Southwest chicken wrap and it was awesome.  A big wrap with lots of tender chicken and just the right amount of seasoning. I like supporting local businesses like this and after trying them, I'll definately be back."}
{"text":"They have amazing cinnamon rolls, muffins, cookies and coffee cake but it doesn't just stop at the bake goods! They have DELICIOUS pulled pork and mac and cheese! And it's not instant mac and cheese either it is homemade mac and cheese it is to die for! I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"My toddler daughter and I had lunch here today and we'll definitely return. Something for everyone, which is often hard to say as a vegetarian. Skip terrible Panera and support a local restaurant with actual homemade food and even a nice little play area for children. Everything from the tea to lunch to a cookie treat for dessert was a perfect end to a long week. So tasty and a great value too!"}
{"text":"Cute little place just getting started on Steels Corners. I was disappointed to find it totally empty when I walked in on a Friday morning, but once I settled in with my laptop for a bit, I was pleased to see it fill up by lunchtime. The owners are very friendly & welcoming, inviting customers to have a seat, grab a bite, & take their time.   I was hoping for a selection of coffee drinks, but at this time, all they offer is regular coffee in a thermos & packaged hot chocolate. Still, if you want a wrap, a cupcake, or a cup of soup (the broccoli cheddar was great!), this is a nice little place to get something to nibble on & sit & chat with a friend. It's also a nice space for those looking for an a place to camp out for an hour or two to get some work done. I hope to see them expand their menu & thrive in the area."}
{"text":"A bit disappointed the case was pretty bare and I really wanted cheesecake (35 weeks pregnant) so instead I got some vegan chocolate chip cookies and they were just ok."}
{"text":"I ordered lemon poppy seed muffins, and they were delicious! The staff is friendly and the prices are great. It doesn't get much better than that. I will definitely be back.   I ordered a yellow cake with chocolate frosting for my girlfriend's birthday, and it was perfect! My girlfriend was really impressed, and everyone who had a piece loved it.  Also, ordering and picking up the cake was easy and hassle-free. I can't say enough about how much I like this place."}
{"text":"Had their Conni mom rolls at Weathervane Playhouse.  The food at the cafe is fantastic!  Especially love the chicken pot pie."}
{"text":"Solid pulled pork sandwich. I got extra coleslaw. The owner prepared the sandwich and wrapped both halves so they wouldn't be so messy. :) Great customer service. Baked goods look and smell amazing!"}
