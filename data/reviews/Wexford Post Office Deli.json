{"text":"When I left I thought this would be much better than it was. The line was very long. After I almost made it through the line the person ahead of me was ordering a salad but they were out of almost everything. This was my first sign that this place would not be that great. I was getting some chips while waiting. When I noticed there was almost no seating inside I head home to eat. The chips tasted good. But the sandwich was terrible. I could not bring myself to eat much more than a few bites. I would have rather made myself PBJ than eat that sandwich."}
{"text":"Wexford Post Office Deli used to be my go-to lunch place but anymore everything tastes the same and I have found better places to get a Boar's Head deli sandwich.  When you become a regular the friendliness of the staff fades and they seem too busy to take your order."}
{"text":"Great nostalgic deli that has been in the Wexford area for a historically long time. Boars Head deli meats and sandwiches. Menu changes and typically offers very unique sandwiches. Pricey, but still under $10 for a sandwich. This facility also caters. You will be surprised of the at home feel to Wexford Post Office Deli. Wonderful summer retreat for a Turkey and Swiss on Marble with Russian dressing, macaroni salad and side salad."}
{"text":"Great little deli!  My wife and I have gone on a few occasions and love it. The quality of the food is great as you would expect from Boar's Head meats, but not only that, they have the best bread, deli salads, and cookies.  Their service is also great, the service is fast and friendly and the food is always extremely fresh.  One warning, there are only two tables with two chairs each, no if it is cold or rainy, there may be no seating.  There is a great outside patio in the summer though."}
{"text":"I ate here this past weekend for lunch with a dining companion.  The shop is what I assume to be an old post office based upon the name and has lots of tchotchke around on the shelves.  Inside there are two small two tops for eating there while outside has a decent number of picnic tables.  For lunch I decided upon having the Turkey Reuben while my dining companion ordered a Turkey Club Wrap.  My sandwich came out on marbled rye with a decent helping of turkey.  Overall it tasted pretty good but half of my sandwich was lacking in sauerkraut.  For the $7 or so per sandwich you would also think that they would throw in a bag of chips or a side of fries but that is not the case.  The bottom line for me is that I would not come back here without the help of a bogo coupon.  The place is cute and the food decent tasting but the overall value is pretty terrible."}
{"text":"This is a GREAT deli located in an old post office. I arrived around 3:30 pm after an appointment for a late lunch. There were no other customers in the place, and the two women behind the counter were VERY FRIENDLY!!  I got the special for the day: turkey, swiss, and bacon on a roll along with the home made chips. The sandwich was HUGE with real/fresh turkey meat and a great/tasty roll. I ate all of it because I couldn't help myself, but I only ate 1/2 the home made chips that were just as good.  EXCELLENT lunch spot, wonderful service.  Sandwich $6.95 Chips .95 Gatorade 1.60 Brownie 1.65 (for Fabian)  Total - $11.93 -- not enough for how GREAT it was!"}
{"text":"The Wexford Post Office Deli is amazing.  My friend and I stopped in so we could have a picnic in North Park.  I ordered a buffalo chicken wrap, and it was a cold buffalo chicken salad style wrap.  Totally unique and delicious!  The price was super reasonable as well.  The cookies are amazing!  The deli also makes ADORABLE picnic baskets!  They had a Steelers themed one, but the not themed ones would be adorable for a date night.  The baskets were priced great, and you get to keep the basket.  Awesome deal!  Here is the bad news: I heard from a friend that the deli will be closing!  I don't know if this is true, but they are talking about only running the catering business now.  I hope it's just a rumor!"}
