{"text":"I've been enjoying Snowdon Deli since I was a kid and now I bring my own kids. They have the best smoked meat in town, more moist than Scwartz's and just as tasty and authentic. And this place is Montreal's best kept secret for brunch - big portions, great pancakes, very reasonable prices, family friendly and no lineup!"}
{"text":"Grew up in Montreal and used to go here as a kid on the occasional Saturday morning, with my dad and his friend, after a morning of playing chess with them. They would get the \"regular\" more fatty smoked meat sandwich. I always opted for the leaner one as I had quickly developed an aversion to gobs of fat in my food. It was still a very good and formidable sandwich for a young kid, and the last one I ate must have been 25 yrs ago. I remember marveling at all the interesting looking preparations behind the counter and wondering what they were and how they tasted...    Fast forward 25 yrs and to San Francisco where out of the blue last week I developed a bad craving for smoked meat.  If anyone knows where I can get some in the Bay area, please let me know."}
{"text":"Meilleur smoked meat en ville! Lorsque tu sort de la tu te sens vraiment comme un américain!!"}
{"text":"Great place for a bowl of matzah ball soup and all your other Jewish comfort food favorites!"}
{"text":"Snowdon Deli is the perfect stop for amazing fried and smoked meat! If you order takeout don't forget to get their party sandwiches.. they are the best in the city!! Matzo ball soup bowl should be bigger in my opinion it looks a little pathetic in a tiny bowl."}
{"text":"21$ for a smoked meat sandwich with fries, dill and slaw, not even very good. Much better smoke meat in this town."}
{"text":"Excellent smoked meat!! Ne vous fiez pas au look du resto, c'est trompeur. Tout est bon!"}
{"text":"Best smoked meat in town. Eases past Schwartz's on the typical visit. Neighbourhoody, without the crazy line ups! Excellent danishes too."}
{"text":"This is the best deli in Montreal. Snowden deli has been a family favorite of our for 50 years, and my grandparents first took me here before I could walk 25 years ago.   My favorite is the old fashioned smoke meat sandwich and an order of fries. See you soon Snowden deli!"}
{"text":"I would like to rate it 10 * if I can!!  Way better than Schwartz!  While going to Schwartz was for its popularity, Snowdon Deli is real quality!"}
{"text":"Another one of Montréal's great delis. This one however is much more lowkey and away from the hustle and bustle of downtown. Food is very good and I've personally never had a problem with consistency. A benefit of Snowdon Deli over some of the other ones, they do breakfast and so it well. Personally I go for the pancakes which are huge and on par price wise with other breakfast places but larger."}
{"text":"Definition of heaven: Hot old fashioned smoke meat sandwich, with fries and black cherry soda at Snowden Deli. Maybe some chicken soup, Karnatzel? Yum.   Take out a box of 'party sandwiches' and knishes and your set!"}
{"text":"Perfect in every way. I'm originally from NY and for years have been missing Jewish Deli, Snowden Deli made me feel at home.  Every Jewish comfort food you can think of is here, they even have gefilte fish! Their benny menu is creative, my co-diner had the smoked meat benny with Matzah ball soup and I had the latkes benny. So delicious. Food made with love and flavor.  The staff is super nice, food tastes great, and they have a great amount of things to by for home like their bakery section.  If you are in Montreal you NEED to stop by here and eat, no questions about it."}
{"text":"Beaucoup de choix à petit prix. Leurs sandwich à la viande fumée ou au saumon sont nice. Une place à visiter souvent!"}
{"text":"Popular kosher-style deli in a not so glamorous neighborhood but hey few things can get your bubbi and zaydie out the door as fast as a meal at the Snowdon Deli. It has better smoke meat than Schwartz- consistent and never dried out. And the fries are better too. Now that's saying something! They have plenty of great quality food on the menu and pickup at the counter even if it ain't terrifically healthy for you. Just go - your arteries and stomach will negotiate some kind of deal afterwards. Oh and it can get loud during weekend brunch hours in a Jewish way. You're either immune to it or you'll find it quite annoying."}
{"text":"One of the best delis I've ever been to.  And I've been to a lot of delis..."}
{"text":"Not sure why Snowdon Deli doesn't typically make \"Best Montreal Smoked Meat\" lists. I would rate at least as good as Schwartz's, if not better and without the attitude.  Nice old-timey interior without being uncomfortable. One of Montreal's best kept secrets?"}
{"text":"This is a busy, local deli in the Snowden section of Montreal. Typical deli layout with a counter for takeout and smallish tables. We wanted to have the Montreal smoked meat experience so we ordered the smoked meat platter to share. There was a huge platter of sliced smoked meat, which looks like a combination of corn beef and pastrami, and tastes a little like both, but milder. It came with a mound of fresh french fries, not the usual frozen and fried kind we get in the US. We also ordered the matzoh ball soup, which was outstanding. The food was delicious. The atmosphere meh. Glad we went and would definitely return. I might add that parking was a bit of a challenge."}
{"text":"medium fat, old fashioned smoked meat sandwich with a fry and matzo ball soup. amazing! while this is my go to,  they have a slew of other amazing items on the menu...one of my other favourite things is their eggplant dip. an order off eggplant dip washed down with 5 slices of rye bread. mmm good!. also they have amazing apple/cherry strudel ...amazing chicken schnitzel! just go..."}
{"text":"Oy vey! - have the kreplach soup and the gefilte fish platter. Almost as good as Bubbe's."}
{"text":"Best deli in the west end! Much better than Dunns. If you don't want to wait at Schwartz's this is the place to go."}
{"text":"What a time to be alive.   I recently swung by Montreal, coming from Ottawa, and bringing Snowdon Deli home to my family warmed my heart. Everyone has favourite there! It's such a classic spot that is even a favourite of my Montrealer parents, and all of their parents.   Picked up some bagelah (sp?), which are like little bagel/blintz clouds, for my mom. She loved them and they're exactly the same as from her childhood days as a lil' Montrealer. Basically, it's bagel dough wrapped around the cheesy filling for a blintz. We also picked up some latkes and knishes. No complaints. Just classics.   Also! They were open on Dec. 26th. These guys just don't quit it."}
{"text":"Very good breakfast place and worth the travel early in the morning!  I'm a huge breakfast fan so whenever I travel it's always a must-do for me to visit a good local breakfast place.  We almost weren't even sure if we were at the right place because the outside doesn't look eye-catching.  I ordered the Smoked Meat Benny and I think my husband ordered 2 Eggs with smoked meat.  We loved everything about them.  The home potatoes were especially tasty.  They weren't dry and flavorful, almost mashed.  I would definitely recommend this place for any breakfast lovers!"}
{"text":"Walked in and wondered if the median age was dead.... a very old crowd, but then the menu is very old. Nice that they have tongue still available, but standard, not pickled. The smoked meat was acceptable but not special. The fries were well done and it was nice that they have diet Cherry and not just regular. Service was good."}
{"text":"for smoked meat, i don't think it's better than Schwartz's, but it's the only place that's even in contention... (FWIW i've never had Smoked Meat Pete's)... nice old school deli atmosphere and food, the sides were great and the rest of the menu is much more varied than Schwartz's..."}
{"text":"I've given this place several chances, but it just doesn't live up to its crosstown competitor Schwartz's.  The advantages it has over Schwartz's is that it is more convenient (right off freeway) and has more parking and there is usually not a wait, but I go to restaurants for the food.  The food is only so-so.  There is nothing exciting about eating here.  Also, on my last visit, I had the distinct impression that the server was trying to rush me out.  Perhaps if you picked this place up and dropped it into the middle of Toledo or something, I would like it better; the thing is, on a trip to Montreal, I will only be eating at one Jewish deli, and I would only pick this place over Schwartz's if time were really tight.  If I had an evening to savor the dining experience, it would be no contest."}
{"text":"Tried the smoke meat very very very small sandwich and expensive...and taste wise nothing special..would not go again.."}
{"text":"This is where your family goes to meet with your grandparents on the weekend. One of the few Montreal deli's really that feels like the community deli.  Really nice waitstaff, and the deli counter staff is more than happy to explain some of the Montreal foods that we dont get in the States. Smoked meat is done in house too."}
{"text":"Overall classic deli spot  excellent smoke meat. Take the lunch special. If you order à la carts it can get pricey. Particularly if you order the cheesecake. That was almost $10 bucks.   \"Whoa camel. I said whoa camel\""}
{"text":"Spicy smoked meat and chopped liver with mustard on rye, a whole kosher dill pickle on the side and rugelach for dessert: the perfect to-go meal for a flight out of Montreal. The combinations of favors and textures is a venerable party for mouth and tummy. It's off the beaten path away from the downtown near University of Montreal, but perfectly situated on the way to the airport.  Hard to stay out of the whole Schwartz vs. anything else debate, but Snowdon can stand on its own merits. Food, service, old deli ambience were all great."}
{"text":"I came here on the recommendation of a friend, and while I still think Schwartz's has the better smoked meat (more gooey, has more flavour, spice and texture if you get the medium end fresh rather than nearer to the leaner parts), I think the smoked meat sandwich here is good but not better.  The smoke meat is different from Schwartz's in that it is more like a coldcut and less like a meat, if that makes sense. That's what I tasted anyway.  I'd HIGHLY, HIGHLY recommend getting the smoked meat sandwich with liver. OMG. Chopped liver. SO GOOD. That kind of sweet, gooey liver (it has caramelized onions in there, I can taste it), contrasting with the smoked, slightly salty meat is a match made in heaven.   Totally delicious.  I also tried a few pastries. Stay away from the danishes, and the apple turnover was okay but they didn't peel the apples so I got a few bites of apple skin (yuck). I could tell it was homemade though, the sauce inside wasn't cloyingly sweet like the packaged stuff, and it wasn't an apple puree but had actual little chunks of unpeeled apple in there.  I'd come back for just the smoked meat sandwich, with the liver. SO GOOD."}
{"text":"Who needs the long snaking line of worldwide tourist geekage at Schwartz's when you can get a just as good (if not better) smoked meat sandwich at this authentic Côte des Neige deli? This place is filled with Real Jews fressing away on smoked meat, matzo ball soup, kasha knishes, and other delicacies. I'll take Snowdon. You take Schwartz, ok? The only negative was chockablock service where our order was messed up and our meals came out 20 minutes apart. But the cool little old lady hostess was a show in herself bouncing and buzzing around in total control directing the show.(see photo)"}
{"text":"Great authentic Jewish food. I really loved the matzo ball soup and the bagel with lox. They are open early for people who want an early breakfast.  The staff are friendly and bring everything quickly. I noticed they also had a take out counter for people who are in a rush and need to take food to go. Yum! :)"}
{"text":"As a disclaimer, I went for breakfast and ordered a dairy item. Other reviewers have looked more favorably upon other items, so those might be better. If I were to go again, I'd go for lunch or dinner and order some combination of smoked meat and kreplach.  That said, I went for breakfast and ordered the blintzes. The inside cheese filling was ok, but I've had better. The outside was a bizarre shade of yellow, and the dough's flavor and texture were a bit heavy relative to most other blintzes I've had. That said, they were definitely tasty enough that it might have been a regional style. I also tried some rugelach from the dessert counter, and those were very good."}
{"text":"Every time I am in the area I have to hit up Snowdon Deli. The food is extreme good and cheap!!!! There is never a crowd and the service is very old school and friendly. It is good for both sit down and take away.  I would say the quality of meat is better than Schwartz but the quantity is not up there."}
{"text":"As soon as I was seated, I was offered coffee. This is a nice touch that I really appreciated.  I wanted eggs and smoked meat, and as I was fumbling through the menu my waitress guided me to exactly what I was looking for.  I like the overall staff involvement in your dining experience at Snowdon Deli. A lot of places will plop a menu in your hands and leave you to your own devices. That wasn't my experience.  The serving size is generous but not excessive. I ordered medium smoked meat and found that compared to say Dunn's it's on the leaner side, which I don't mind. The scrambled eggs weren't quite as fluffy as they could be, but the potatoes were great. Crispy on the outside and cooked up with oignons.  Overall, I'd say Snowdon Deli is a decent local place to go for breakfast (served all day) with great service and all the classic Deli fare you might want.  I'll definitely be back, and would bring friends and family here."}
{"text":"One of the best delis in the city a true Montreal landmark and institution. Best staff amazing owners!!!"}
{"text":"Great authentic deli ! Decided to give it a try instead of our usual visit to Schwartzs on our way into town for annual boxing day shopping extravaganza ! Definite pro is no line up ! Schwartzs is great but standing in line outside when its -20C is not fun. I would say Snowdon is better,  creamed herring is amazing ! Smoked meat is delicious and they give you the option of lean of medium and regular or spicy. A little out of the way from downtown but worth the small detour."}
{"text":"I've ordered stuff to go from here, but this was my first time eating in. Apparently this place has a reputation for, how do we say, \"service with personality,\" which is probably why I avoided dining here in the first place. But i was feeling adventurous, no to mention craving smoked meat, so off we went. The place was busy but not full, so we were seated relatively quickly. Our server, while seeming a little pushy, ended up being super sweet. Ordered the two eggs with smoked meat. Solid. They know their meat. The rye toast that came with it was also exceptional. This place has been around for a while and you can tell. But that's the charm of it, right?"}
{"text":"The service was really good and the staff was very friendly. I was a little disappointed in my \"club sandwich\". I was essentially a turkey sandwich with an extra slice of bread. The cheesecake was delicious though!"}
{"text":"Favourite deli in Montreal. Juicy smoked meat, brisket and salami. Good prices. Portions on the platters are huge. The kzitzel is home made.  Friendly servers. I can't say anything bad. I wish London Ontario had a location."}
{"text":"Awesome Jewish deli.  Don't miss the varenikas."}
{"text":"Before I came to Montreal, my friends swore that Montreal style smoked meat would blow my mind. My experience did not disappoint. It's very similar to pastrami or corned beef but different enough to warrant it's own name. I opted for it lean and old fashioned with plenty of mustard. It's delicious - warm, salty, beefy, and juicy. The staff is friendly and the no fuss presentation suits their signature items perfectly. Besides the smoked meat they have your regular deli fair and Jewish food."}
{"text":"best breakfast in Montreal in quality and selection. Opens at 5am. Staff do the job right."}
{"text":"Amazing Service & Helpful staff, food  wasn't the best but got exactly what i ordered,  reasonable priced,"}
{"text":"My favourite breakfast place at the moment . They are open at 6am and close at 7:30pm every single day except Fridays. They close an hour earlier on Fridays.    Visited this place on Saturday morning , the place was still empty when we arrived. I ordered the breakfast place with 2 eggs , smoked meat, home potatoes, fruit garnish and white toast. I also got 2 latkes with sour cream and apple sauce and sour and half-sour pickles.   The home potatoes were tasty , they give you a big portion of it. The smoked meat was decent, the fruits tasted fresh and the white toast was so good, my partner got the rye bread and that was even better ! My favourite part of the meal was the potato latkes. They were amazing ! So crispy yet chewy and gooey inside, with some sour cream and apple sauce , delish !!! I would come back just for their potato latkes.   The server was also super friendly."}
{"text":"Went twice for breakfast/lunch to go during our four day visit.  What can I say?  A great Jewish deli/diner with excellent breakfast food (now if only they had real bacon...), perfect coffee, giant portions, and great service.  We took some chicken salad, tuna salad, chopped liver, and bread to go for lunch and it was also delicious.  I've been to Montreal twice and this place three times.  Coincidence?"}
{"text":"Typical dinner experience with somewhat friendly staff where they haven't updated or renovated and never will.   They do have excellent smoked meat which is because rare these days. Based on food only it gets 4 stars but I have mixed feelings about atmosphere   I can't help to wonder if they will survive forever with good smoked meat and resistance to any change"}
{"text":"I love Snowdon's and finally had a chance to get back there this summer on a day trip up from upstate NY. If you like Jewish delis---then by all means make the trip out to Snowdon's. The smoked meat sandwich was amazing. I can't remember what style it was--traditional? Something that sounded like the less healthy option. GET THAT ONE! Yum. We did take out and got so much from the case. There isn't a deli that good out here in San Francisco and there certainly isn't any smoked meat. Can't wait for our next trip east!"}
{"text":"worth a trip for the experience.  while I much prefer NY deli to smoked (no pastrami / no corned beef) meet - I'm glad I made the trip to a less traveled local in Montreal"}
{"text":"So here goes my first Yelp review.  I just moved back to Montreal and I had this crazy poutine craving that needed satisfying ASAP. I've always heard of this deli but it was always out of my way as I lived downtown.  So I bravely typed up the words poutine near me on google to find that Deli Snowdon was the closest and best reviewed near me (thanks for the yelp).  So I sat down in a booth and was swiftly handed a glass of water and a menu by this old lady that moved faster than me (clearly I won't be this mobile at that age, she must be icing her ankles in the back)  I look at the menu and decided on the premeditated victim and added a smoked meat sandwich, with pickles of course.  I glanced at the beverage section and couldn't find the beers so I asked for one anyways but sadly I was denied by a smile and a head swivelling from left to right. I therefore retreated to a coca cola. As I was waiting for my order a gang of old people rolled in and they all knew each other, I felt I was watching a senior remake of save by the bell.  Shortly after I was bombarded with my order. As I was scarfing down my poutine without even looking at the smoked meat sandwich I soon realized there was no way in Hell I was fishing all that food and also thought to myself that there was even less way in hell I was waisting any food; something had to give. In the end I was victorious over the smoked meat but the poutine over me. I left the deli slightly disoriented not even realizing I just paid 28$ for a sandwich and a poutine, but I must say that it did the job; a craving was satisfied."}
{"text":"À chaque fois que vais à snowdon deli c'est pour manger la viande fumée. Je la trouve très bonne. Les serveurs(es) sont très sympathiques et et le service et très rapide. Dommage que ça ferme très tôt"}
{"text":"Delish! Best smoked meat in Montreal."}
{"text":"It's a classic Montreal deli/restaurant. Great smoked meat and tons of other stuff on the menu. These types of delis are few and far between. The fact that this place is still around is a testament to the quality of their food."}
{"text":"I was in the neighborhood (going to my fav Vietnamese pho shop Sen Vang). I dropped in on a late Saturday afternoon for a take out sandwich and it was not busy.  Staff was friendly and made the recommendation of a smoked meat sandwich. They asked me what cut I liked and I said for them to make the choice.    Sandwich was $9 cad which was fair. I got it on rye but you can get it in a bagel or other bread for an extra fee. Good sized portions. The taste of the sandwich was okay. It wasn't warm or hot which is a negative. Also the cut he gave me was too tender and didn't have that crusty taste to it.   Worth a try but not sure I will come back."}
{"text":"I've tried many and Snowden is possibly the best deli in the world and easily the best value, on par, or better than any in New York or Baltimore.  My only regret is that I did not buy more takeout - which made the trip well back to Washington, DC and I had no problems with the sometimes intrusive border inspectors.  Great delis are an endangered species.  Snowden has a rich and varied menu -- more so than crosstown tourist favorite Schwartz's (also an excellent deli).  I ordered the smoked meat (less dry than Schwartz's and a bit less spicy), corned beef, latkes and kasha kinishes.  All were among the best I've ever had.  Snowden is sort of hard to find, not downtown, but is about 3 blocks from the Snowden Metro stop.  Everyone at Snowden was also very friendly to an USA resident who knows little French.  I'll be back the next time I'm in Montreal and next time I'll take much more food home to the USA."}
{"text":"Top notch food at this Jewish style deli.  I had the smoked beef, while wife had the Bagel and Lox sandwich.  Both were great quality.   The smoked beef was so tender that it literally just melted in my mouth.  Decor doesn't look like it has changed in the past 50 years or so."}
{"text":"The highest quality of food...everytime...all the time. We have never had a bad meal...the consistency is always top-notch. Best damned smoked meat in town."}
{"text":"For so many years....a winner...I left Canada 40 years ago and visit this place on each visit to Montreal...the food is always great..the smoked meat clearly now the best in Montreal (better than Schwartzs). The staff is perfect...they know the menu...the service pleasant and professional...a must visit if you are coming to Montreal...Bravo!!"}
{"text":"This is it. My favorite Jewish deli, anywhere on earth. I admit, I was late to the party. But I'm here, and I'm... lovin' it. I had the best smoke meat sandwich ever, and I'm old! Never tried chopped liver before, but I will again. Great friendly staff too. This is the only FULL Jewish deli left for a reason. This really is a top pick for me."}
{"text":"Smoked meat, smoked meat, smoked meat, smoked meat!  Yes, Schwartz' is the classic traditional touristy spot to go -wouldn't change that for the world. Snowdon Deli is still better food.   If you need a recommendation: lean old-fashioned, side of fries. Boom, done.  Also great: chicken soup, cole slaw, pickles, turkey sandwich, karnatzel (with mustard!).   Parking in the area is tricky, be warned."}
{"text":"Still the best! Visited Snowdon over Passover (they were open for takeout only), and what a great experience! I ordered some smoked meat to take home and they sliced it right in front of me, even gave us some to taste while we waited! We also got some side dishes, matzo ball soup and they even had matzo rolls to make a sandwich on! Everything was perfect, I can't say a bad word! Long live Snowdon Deli!"}
{"text":"I like it, but not as much as Schwartz'.   It's good though and you make it spicier.  Big fan of that."}
{"text":"Premiere visite a ce deli qui existe depuis les années 40. Décor de deli typique.  Beaucoup de clients réguliers. Moyenne d'âge de 60 ans. Nous avons tous les deux de la viande fumée. Mon ami en assiette et moin sandwich. J'ai bien aimé mon sandwich. Viande fumée juteuse et le pain de seigle est super frais. Mon ami lui a aimé mais sans plus. Pas impressionné par la viande. Nous avons mangé les frites, beaucoup de frites, trop de frites. Meme si nous n'avions plus faim, nous devions goûter à un dessert. Notre choix s'arrêta sur un délicieux Strudel aux pommes et fraises. Excellent avec un Cafe. Le service etait excellent. Amical, courtois et rapide. Le stationnement sur le boulevard Decarie est difficile mais les parcomètres ne sont pas trop gourmands. ."}
{"text":"Amazing smoked meat. The best part? It's never crowded! I've come twice at the peak of lunchtime and always immediately got a table. Great portions. I'd only go here if I wanted my smoked meat fix."}
{"text":"I've heard good things about this place and I always wanted to try it. I was in the neighbourhood and felt like a smoke meat sandwich so I decided to give it a try.  Snowdon Deli is located on Decarie Boulevard near Snowdon metro. It is on the same side as the old Snowdon movie theatre. I went there around 11:00am one morning on a rainy day and it wasn't crowded. In fact, I was the only person at the restaurant portion of Snowdon Deli and I was seated immediately. There were some people at the counter ordering take out.  I was given the regular menu along with a lunch menu and took a look at both. I was somewhat surprised that I didn't see a smoke meat special/trio on the lunch menu. As such, I decided to go for the smoke meat platter (~$15). The smoke meat platter came with some bread, 2 pickle slices, fries, and of course smoke meat. I had the choice between lean or medium and I opted for medium. I also had a choice between old fashion and regular and decided to go with the old fashion which is generally the tastier/spicier of the two options at most smoke meat places that I've gone to.  A few minutes after ordering, the waitress brought my smoke meat platter. It looked and was delicious. The only thing is that I got the end of the bread slices so my first 2 slices of bread were not that large (you can see the picture). This made putting the smoke meat between those first 2 slices of bread difficult.  The only thing missing was some coleslaw and a drink if I decided to purchase it.  I thought that the food was very good. My only complaint about the service is that they don't automatically refill the water at the table since I believe that the water is already in the glasses so they just put the glass of water on your table. My glass of water was empty for a few minutes before I had to ask for more water even though the waitress passed by my table to ask me if everything was okay (and at that point, my glass was almost empty but she didn't refill it or replace it with a full glass of water)."}
{"text":"A classic Montreal Jewish deli, maybe the last really old school authentic one in town, worth the travel out to Snowden area (where I grew up) to go get into it. It looks a bit like something out of a movie and the service has character, which can be cracked to friendly if you hit it just right. The important things to eat here are pickles, smoke meat, latkes and everything. Writing about this now is making me hungry and grumpy that I am not in there eating all the things right now."}
{"text":"One of the best Jewish delis in Montreal  I have been coming here since i was a little girl and have always returned for a yummy lunch or dinner.   My favourite items are: matzah ball soup, smoke meat sandwich, french fries, grilled cheese, hot dogs."}
{"text":"Classic deli fare in a classic deli environment with experienced staff. The restaurant has both sit down and deli counter take out. The smoked meat is solid Montreal style and the breakfast and lunch menu very broad. I love the Greek omelette with black bread."}
{"text":"I came in for a smoked meat sandwich, medium fat, traditional style (\"more spice, more flavour\"). An increase in the price of brisket has sent Schwartz's sandwich price from $5-ish to over $9 in the last few years, but Snowdon's was around $7. It was wonderful, as always. Snowdon's fat spectrum maxes out at medium, so while I do like the fatty option available at Schwartz's, I think that both places should share the \"best smoked meat\" crown.   This visit, I noticed a plate of smoked meat arriving at the table next to me as I bit into my sandwich. The slices were lightly marbled with fat, glistening, sumptuous, bulging, and I found myself wondering if I too should have ordered the plate -- the better to apply the smoked meat directly to my mouth, with no bread intermediary.   I was floored when the customer complained bitterly about the meat, describing it to the waitress as carelessly sliced and \"prepared as if it was dog food\". The waitress and another staff member were unflappable, replacing the plate with more uniform slices and explaining simply that if something was not right, they would fix it. No one in any line of work deserves that treatment; I'm not sure what we've all done to earn their tolerance or their beautiful food. But it's there, and you should go eat it if you're the meat-eating kind, and please be nice -- it doesn't get any better than this."}
{"text":"I have been a client for over 50 years. Great food .Breakfast ,lunch or supper. Just like home and the staff are great. I highly recommend this restaurant to anybody who loves to eat good food."}
{"text":"Awesome smoked meat sandwich!  I think Snowdon's meat is even better than Schwartz: more juicy, tender and flavorful.  You be the judge."}
{"text":"As near perfect as perfect can get. Jewish comfort food at its best. Where do I start ? As you enter you go through a time machine and you are in the 60s. The tables the waitress the sounds the busyness of the place are gold. The smoked meat is the star here. Have the old fashioned my auntie says.\" So who am I'm I, to question her?\" She oders up a storm of fries, smoked meat plater , tougue plater, potato knish, kasha knish, pickles rye bread like a conductor of the Symphony. You want tongue? So you should try it. What a performance! I have been to the famous Katz deli in  NYC and this is without a doubt better.  The smoked meat, melts in your mouth, butter should melt this good. 6 stars if I could give it."}
{"text":"Today, Bry and I got:   2 smoked meats on Rye, 1 fries, 1 pickles and it came to under 20$  we got a free pepperoni rolled in some fluffy bread while we waited.  It's an awesome Jewish deli/ restaurant and it's literally one of the best meals I will remember Montreal by if not the best. Fast, simple, awesome and service isn't even a question it's a standard of excellence.    Bry and I walked back to where we were staying. I had some wine with my meal and shabam! we had to go to sleep. The food was outstanding! It was comforting in the most innate form. We're going back and you need to go here ASAP."}
{"text":"A few days ago I stopped by this Deli with the goal of experiencing my first authentic Jewish deli in Montreal. I left not only achieving that goal, but also feeling beyond satisfied. Located far from the tourist hub of Montreal, Snowdon Deli is a real delight. The food was authentic, the service rapid, and the environment meticulously matching my past experiences of visiting New York Jewish delis. I enjoyed Matzo Ball Soup that could only be improved by adding more vegetables and having alternative broth. The latkahs were amazing and are a must try. If one are looking for an affordable, quick, and authentic Jewish-Canadian experience, Snowdon Deli will not fail."}
{"text":"Aucune critique en français à propos de Snowdon Deli? Honte à nous les francos! Je cherchais un resto à smoke-meat dans le coin, et voilà que Yelp m'indique cet endroit dont j'ignorais l'existence. Je peux y lire à son sujet beaucoup de critiques positives, toutes en anglais, et plusieurs photos de sandwich à l'aspect appétissant. Convaincu par les mots de mes confrères yelpeurs, j'entre donc dans ce resto situé sur le triste et délabré boulevard Decary.   J'ai opté pour le sandwich traditionnel (un choix qui ne se retrouve qu'ici) et qui signifie une viande plus épicée qu'à l'habitude. Je n'ai pas regretté mon choix. Le gout d'épice était franchement plus prononcé sans être trop fort ou dérangeant. Les tranches étaient tendres et juteuses, sans ces morceaux de gras blanc que l'on retrouvent souvent dans d'autres resto. En bref, mon sandwich était parfait et gouteux comme je l'aime.   L'ambiance? Il s'agit du seul point négatif. Néons blafards, décor défraichi, clientèle locale qui vous met un peu mal à l'aise (genre groupe de p'tit vieux qui se tait et vous dévisage à votre arrivée). Comme pour bien des restos Deli de Montréal, le décor et l'ambiance générale laissent quelque peu à désirer.  Le service est rapide, mais sans trop de sourire.   En bref, Deli Snowdon est encore un resto qui offre un bien meilleur sandwich que Schwartz's. Je le dirais donc encore : éviter les files interminables de ce resto sur St-Laurent qui se prétend \"incontournable\" et venez ici. Votre expérience smoke-meat sera franchement meilleure."}
{"text":"A little on the expensive side for deli food but it is definitely worth it. I'm not a huge fan of smoked meat to begin with but this place had me doubting my own inclinations. On point!!"}
{"text":"Very good Jewish Deli with excellent Montreal smoked meat. We also had the matzah ball soup which was hearty and delicious."}
{"text":"Went here to try to find the authentic Montreal deli experience. It was pretty good! Shared poutine & had the chicken soup. Selections were decent,service was prompt and food was good."}
{"text":"Deli Snowdon is part of Montreal's culinary history.  It is a traditional, Jewish deli that opened way back in 1946 and is still around today.  You'll find all the staples of the Jewish deli on the menu like matzo ball soup, karnatzel and smoked meat.   It's in a bit of an awkward location lying along Decarie with not much around it.  There is some street parking available but that is about it.  Inside the place is a little dated and could use a bit of a facelift.  It is pretty big though so getting a seat is a breeze.  On this particular visit I thought I would go with something traditional like brisket. This came served to me on rye bread and it was drenched in gravy.  The meat was juicy and tender and I really enjoyed it.  I also had a side of onion rings which were only so so.  There was a little too much batter and the portion was pretty small.    Also they have cherry Coke and I mean Coca Cola, not some imitation brand!  This is one of my favourite soft drinks yet it is hard to come by here in Canada.  I always have no trouble finding it in the US but here you really have to go looking for it.   Needless to say this made me happy!  The prices are reasonable and I paid about $16-17 for my whole meal which is what I would have paid anywhere else.  It's an interesting option if you find yourself in the area but I'm not sure it is worth a detour."}
{"text":"Well historical or not,  we're far from the juicy old fashioned traditional Smoked meat here.   About an average well made for a connaisseur & surely above average for an amateur.  Service: Très bon service alla'real Montréal en Franglish  :)  Loved it.  Very kind & experience lady.  L'accueil par l'hotess un peu brouillon. Service rapide et efficace!  Amusant.  Food: Pour goûter un smoked meat rien de mieux qu'un platter!  & I asked Medium fat!  She replied Old fashion -  I already knew we were in trouble :) Belle assiette, viande juteuse mais je ne suis pas renversé par Lester B Person et on cherche le medium fat ou old fashion. Pain sec et froid Pickle peu goûteux. Frites parfaite bien que mon comparse trouvait que la montagne serait lourde à monter!   Le strudel aux pomme-fraise est tout simplement divin!!!  J'ai jubilé demander à Jack!  Ambiance, tradition et ... Deli Snowdon fait sans doute partie de l'histoire locale du Smoked Meat de CDN et attire inévitablement une clientèle nostalgique à la retraite des quartiers hébraïques des alentours.  J'ai adoré mon expérience et l'ambiance!   Un vrai Deli counter!  Je veux y retourner pour goûter leur délicatesse hébraïque et leurs autres desserts qui me semblent succulent!  Oh!  J'adore le fait qu'ici y a du coke au cerise!  A classic with a smoked meat!   Better then black cherry cott!  Trust me!  An International Delight & Real Old Fashion Smoked Meat Enthusiasts & historian!  Merci Deli Snowdon to be there! Long Life & See you soon for other goodness but no: you ain't get in my Top 5 of Montreal & NYC Hébraïque Smoked Meat list!  Pete's Main Steakhouse still lead for the real experience!"}
{"text":"Better than Schwartz's? Close. I went with the medium fat, old fashioned smoked meat sandwich. It was juicy, tender, and packed with flavors . Something that all good smoked meat should be like.   What I also love about this place are the historical achivements framed on the wall. It really does give it some sort of magical charm which is translated to its staff because my waitress was the kindest person ever.   If you don't want to wait in queue for a huge lineup at Schwartz's then Snowden Deli is a solid alternative."}
{"text":"It's ok just ok , Montreal is the kingdom of smoked meat and the kingdom is ruled by SCHWARTZ  What we tasted at Snowden deli is just whatever smoked meat had no flavour I don't think I'll go again."}
{"text":"As a native New Yorker, I have been to my fair share of Jewish delis. While I agree that there are some subtle differences between The pastrami that a nyc landmark like Katz is serving and the smoke meat in Montreal, for all intensive purposes they are the same thing.  With that being said, the smoked meat sandwiches BLOW AWAY ANY AND ALL NYC JEWISH DELI SANDWICHES!!! Large in stature and short on price, you would be hard pressed to find a better value!!!   While my last two trips to Montreal have only lasted a combined 6 days, I have some how managed to eat 5 smoked meats from the Snowden deli'nn  I would be remised not to mention the out of this world matzo ball soup or the show stopping Montreal staple of pountine.   In closing, this place is awesome. Great food, great decor and great service. If provided the opportunity, do not miss the chance to eat at this Montreal institution."}
{"text":"A 4 for the food, but minus points for the space. The food was really good. Smoked meat sandwich was delicious; almost as good as Schwartz's, but just lacking a little bit of texture. We also had a grilled deli meat sandwich on a hamburger bun. A little one note but really tasty.   I'm a big fan of grubby classic restaurant interiors but there's a fine line between character and dirt. Snowdon edges a little too close to the latter for me. Service was fine but spaced-out. I might come back but wouldn't make a special trip."}
{"text":"I have to admit i don't think I really like Montreal smoked meat so take this review with a grain of salt. I've had some Montreal smoked meat twice before but all I presumably wrong places (once in Vancouver over poutine, once at a fast food joint in a mall in Quebec City).  My SO's car got rear ended while driving from Quebec City so we stayed an additional night in Montreal when we intended to go to Maine. We decided we ought to try a proper Montreal smoked meat sandwich but no way in hell was I going to wait in -19 degree weather for Schwartz's (not to mention I tend to avoid cliched tourist trap restaurants) so I did a little googling for what would be a good alternative. I found many comments about this being as good if not better than Schwartz's so we headed out here for our last meal in Montreal for the time being.   I ordered a regular (less peppery) smoked meat sandwich, medium fat on rye, with a side of fries and some coffee. The SO ordered his \"old-fashioned\" but otherwise the same and with a matzo ball soup instead.   The coffee was fantastic- this is great deli coffee and they're generous with refills. We don't have weak brown water coffee where the refills come only with the check. This ain't no Stumptown roasters but might I say this is a damn fine cup of coffee.   The matzo ball soup- not so much. It was literally a mushy bland matzo ball in a pool of neon yellow chicken broth made from bouillon. Avoid at all costs, it tastes like a ramen seasoning packet.   Now for the sandwich- it's pretty good! The meat is piled high and served hit which is fantastic for a cold winter day. Unfortunately I don't think I'm sold on Montreal smoked meat. It was like a blander version of pastrami. It doesn't have then complexity and smoke of pastrami, not to mention I wasn't a fan of the bread. I like my rye to taste very much like rye and peppered with seeds. Good bread on a sandwich is half of the sandwich battle in my book.   Now my favorite part is this whole meal was the fries! One thing I love about Canadians is that they know fries- no shoestring crap, no nasty inedible chalk coating, amazing crisp yet tender golden brown fries. Amazing. The perfect texture.   I'd return for some fries and coffee in a heart beat (and excellent service!) but I wouldn't be sad if this is my last MTL smoked meat sandwich ever. Maybe it's the greasy patriotic American inside of me but I'd choose pastrami over MTL smoked meat any day of the week."}
{"text":"Great smoked meat.  On par with the better known deli ;)"}
{"text":"Great Deli. Smoke Meat traditional, Cucumber salad, Karnutzul - all fantastic."}
{"text":"AMAZING! Delicious and excellent value for money. Without a doubt better than any other smoked meat place in the city that I have tried."}
