{"text":"Freshest sushi and sashimi in town ! The service is great, the food is absolutely deliciousss!!! A bit out of your way when you live downtown, but definitely worth the trip. Also, it is a bit more pricey, the service can be a bit slow in the evening (because there is only one chef) But once in a while, treat yourself there, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"If you are looking for an authentic Japonese restaurant, that serves fresh sushi, this is definitely the place to be.  This restaurant serves probably the best sushi and ramen in town. All the foods come fresh and prepared with great care.  The owner of the restaurant, who is also the chief, demonstrates great passion in the art of making delicious food.  The food is little bit pricey, but it definitely worth every cent spent!"}
{"text":"Amazing price, Amazing food, All you can eat, and not that expensive if you decide to take out, Food quality is good, and their service is usually fast. Only thing they could improve on would maybe the they're decorations inside the restaurant."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this restaurant for a few years now and haven't been disappointed! The makis are beautiful and so flavorful. The sashimi is great with its large pieces of fresh fish. The service is really good and the restaurant is clean. Definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"Best ever quality for GREAT prices!! Try the menu with discounted prices instead of \" all you can eat \" better variety and higher quality sushi!! I would definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. One of my all-time favourites. Kyoto is an amazing no fluff sushi restaurant. They only serve authentic Japanese dishes. Their sushi is absolutely amazing, along with the plates such as the chicken teriyaki. I love their tempura shrimp and vegetables as well as the miso soup. The restaurant is small and cozy with cute decor. The service is impeccable.  Everything is incredibly fresh and delicious. One thing I would say though is that it takes quite some time to get your food. The sushi is hand-prepared in front of you by the owner so it takes quite long-but the wait is worth it!"}
{"text":"BAD: - slow service  - waitstaff seemed to be pretty pissed off - waitstaff avoided eye contact with us, had to try hard to get their attention and it's not like we were pigging out like sushi was going to be extinct by tomorrow - gave us random dishes that we did not order - did not give us dishes we had ordered - sashimi was OK quality, definitely below par when compared to other AYCE sushi places -sushi rice was soggy and mushy - \"teriyaki\" chicken looked like it was boiled in water and then dipped in teriyaki sauce.    GOOD: -seafood udon was good  Summary:  this was our third and last time eating here."}
{"text":"I always go to this place for take out orders because they close at 11:00. The food is good but not wow!! Sometime we go for dine in, but I have to say that the service isn't that good and the servers had no attention to details and service etiquette. So no more dine in.  My advise order take out the food is good."}
{"text":"I've ordered for pick up on their discount menu multiple times now and this is by far the best value sushi restaurant I've eaten at.  The quality of food is quite high.  It sits comfortably above typcial sushi buffets and slightly below the authentic japanese sushi restaurants (although those are hard to find in this area).  The variety is also fantastic.  What gives this restaurant a high value rating is the fact that the prices are also quite low relative to what they are serving.   I haven't ordered the all you can eat so cannot confirm if they serve a different grade of fish for that meal option like some restaurants do.  A simple comparison method between salmon sashimi that I usually do is to compare their salmon sashimi. A la carte salmon sashimi will be firm, dry, room temperature, and 'crisp' to the bite, while buffet style is usally wet, cold, and a bit mushier to bite into."}
{"text":"We had a reservation for a big group of people for a birthday. We were there 5 mins after our reservation and they gave up our table to another party. With no call, or anything to confirm if we were coming. What sort of customer service is this?! We ALWAYS come here for birthdays and events because it's good and the pricing is good. But never coming back here again. No apology, nothing worst customer service ever! Avoid it if possible. You can lose a loyal customer very easily if you don't give them good customer service. Bye."}
{"text":"We were there for dinner last night. My hubby had been here with his friends a few months ago and was wanting me to try it because he really liked the place.  We were seated promptly as they weren't overly busy. Water was brought and menus were left at our table. We got our sheet marked and then waited 10 minutes for someone to pick up our sheet. The first platter came out with all the rolls just stacked on it. No presentation and a very horrible roll job. The rice and fish didn't taste as fresh either. My husband swear that this is not the quality he had received before. So the quality was just not there and we were really disappointed as we had driven from Mississauga. Now the service other than the prompt seating nothing else is worth talking about. The servers kept throwing the dishes at our table. We found that very rude. They wouldn't excuse to reach out to fill water and the one time she had a small spill on the table which caused a few drops to fall on our rolls as she wasn't looking while pouring.  We will definitely not be going back here again."}
{"text":"I'm sorry buy I have to go with one star for this place. After reading some good reviews we decided to go there on a Tuesday night. It was a friendly place cheap price plus a 10% discount, and because of that it was busy.  The green tea came 10 min after we sat down  . We ordered and got our rolls but no wasabi or ginger. So we asked for them got them quickly but just wished they'd just know like all other places. The food was not good. That's all I will say because I don't want to be disrespectful to the people who made it nor to the people who like it . But as someone who loves sushi I couldn't have it.  Overall I'm sorry but not worth the discount or the time ."}
{"text":"One star in terms of service. I would even assign no star if that's possible. If not for their food, I would never come back to this place. Their service is horrible! They don't care, seemed rush and doesn't acknowledge you even when you wave your hand to their face. You're best bet is to order take-out. Worst service ever!"}
{"text":"I've been to this place twice. First time I left thinking it was alright of a place. Not the best, but it wasn't the worst either. After my second visit, I've drawn the conclusion that this place is RIDCULOUS and will never ever be coming back.   Food was EH... and service was SHIT.  Food wise, they always cheap out on food. We ordered 50 salmon sashimi pieces, they gave us 30. We ordered 30 red snapper sashimi pieces, they gave us 20. So on, and so fourth. Everything they gave us was way less than what we ordered.   Service was super slow as well, and the workers lacked manners."}
{"text":"The service was really bad. First and last time there. The sushi wasn't great. It was ok.  They don't serve Alcohol. They don't have a regular menu. All u can eat only.  It looked seedy. The washrooms were dirty.  Don't go."}
{"text":"Overpriced below average Sushi. Sure..if you're comparing it with terrible buffet style \"sushi\" like Kanda's then yea..it's better.  We tried different types of their Maki and sushi.  I keep getting disappointed with the sushi in Montreal or near it and this is the most recent installment.  Save your money and palate."}
{"text":"I have been going there for years, and I could tell you with all sincerity it's one of the best authentic Sushi restaurants in Montreal. No Fancy fusions, only well balanced, well prepared, Japanese Sushi.  The chef is the only one who makes the Sushi. He prepares each piece in such a meticulous and precise manner, which can take a little bit of patience when you're eagerly awaiting your meal. But waiting should never be an issue at Kyoto, knowing that the final result is nothing less than a skilful and masterly composed dish of perfection. So don't expect it to be done in 5 min.  \"Nothing but the best\". If they don't have it fresh they wont serve it.  If a certain fish was out of season or simply not up to the chefs rigorous standards of freshness. It will be removed off the menu, and Although I might have been looking forward to that specific sort of Maki, I find comfort in knowing that \"Mr. Chef Kyoto\" only uses the best ingredients. Besides, variety isn't whats missing.  I brought many friends to this place along the years and even if some of them disliked Sushi, or ran the other way at the thought of eating raw fish. This place has made it easy to make converts of all of them. they've all adopted Kyoto as a reference of what Sushi outside Japan should taste like. (NO More Kanda)  The ambiance is exactly what I need when I want to have a relaxing meal with a few friends, or a romantic evening with my girlfriend enjoying some wonderful and artfully crafted Maki, Onigiri, Sashimi, Temaki, Karaage, Tempura...etc. Some Jazz playing in the background and a good Kieran Ichiban beer, what more can you ask for.  I always feel welcome by Mrs. & Mr. Kyoto. Unfortunately I don't know their real names, and foolishly never thought to ask, but that never stopped their customary in synced greeting of Hello and Goodbye. Making you feel remembered and appreciated.  FYI, I felt I needed to clarify what I read from other reviews. Despite what some people might think, you do not need to be Japanese to make great Sushi. I don't know if this misrepresentation of his ethnicity is an issue for the owner but I felt like I needed to stress this fact."}
{"text":"Have been back a couple times since. The food is still good. The prices went up slightly. But overall the big change is in the service.   No one expects a sushi place to have good service but to have service that ruins your dinner? That's unacceptable. We had 3 servers help us over the course of the night, one kept forgetting to bring the things we asked her for, such as water and napkins and soy sauce (seriously they forgot soy sauce at a sushi place?!) another was so rude I couldn't believe it. And then the third was yelled at by a family at another table for sneezing in their food and walking away, and then they sent her our way!!! No thanks I don't want your sneeze near me.   After we paid and left we yelled back, \"thanks for being rude.\" Now I really won't go back."}
{"text":"Very very very disorganized for pick up orders. The kitchen can't keep up with orders but they keep taking orders. The food isn't worth the wait."}
{"text":"I order here almost weekly since it has opened for take out. Sat in to eat once.   All experiences, can't complain. Sushi is always good. Stir fried udon is good as well.  My go to sushi place is this neighbourhood. Keep it up"}
{"text":"Went: 8:30 pm Sat Aug 22 2015 Ordered: Kyoto Roll, Red Snapper Roll, Veggie Roll, Tuna Roll Cost: $16.00 There are some really excellent prices here. We had take out, so can't really comment on the service. There is something off about the rice that you do not find in good sushi restaurants. The red snapper roll was too heavy and the veggie roll did not have enough flavour, but the Kyoto and tuna roll were good enough to distract from the below-par rice. My date's family members come here a lot and say that the rice at those times are a lot worse. Bottom line: I like the value, and would try again because of the value, despite some bad reviews and anecdotes. If you are looking for good to excellent sushi, you should probably look elsewhere."}
{"text":"This is one of those great places to eat for cheap. They serve quality food at low prices and is also open quite late which is awesome. I highly recommend this place as they often give free rolls when you order take out."}
{"text":"Disappointed by the quality control and customer service there. First time there yesterday and wanted to order a la  carte instead of the AYCE. We ordered a spicy sushi tuna roll, and as I finished a piece, I noticed a sharp, hard thing  left in my mouth. I pulled  it out trying to figure out what it was. I flagged the server and she told me \"it's just the scale from the tuna\" and walked  away. I was speechless  1) why was hard, sharp fish scale in my food? 2) why was there a lack of an apology? Or give us a replacement  dish?  Needless to say, I would not go back. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"by far the worse sushi ive had. sushi was falling apart before eating it. service was horrible! they were rude. never coming back here and dont recommend it."}
{"text":"Went for dinner a couple of times, turned out okay. Service was a bit slow and the sushi was alright, nothing special. It's a nice place, would come back sometime."}
{"text":"I very rarely give below 3 star reviews, and for this place i considered a 1 star. I came here for dinner, which was 19.95 per person. Obviously this price was too good to be true, and its amazing how much of a quality difference a few dollars makes in this area. We started with some dumplings and spring rolls, which seemed straight from a box in the freezer. Our rolls that followed were small and definitely not fresh. I have posted pictures that show how little fish you actually get in each roll as well.  For a few dollars more, you can get 100x better sushi than this For the same price you can also get better sushi.  I can't believe how busy this place is, guess people just don't know better.  I wouldn't pay $10 for this ayce sushi."}
{"text":"The salmon and the tuna on the sushi is very easy to eat. You can slurp them down and it melts in your mouth. The sushi is very fresh and prepared on the spot by the chef. Even though there can be a long wait for the sushi, it is worth it. The staff is very kind and friendly, and the service is very good. Thank you for this delicious experience! :)"}
{"text":"Very good sushi restaurant. Try the matcha cheesecake for dessert, it is delicious. Staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"Best place to eat sushi in Vaughan. Great food at great prices. The only problem that I ever had was waiting for the food to come, it took a long time but it was worth it."}
{"text":"I`m not a fan.  The shocker: Amongst my Vaughan local friends & family, I`m probably an anomaly.  But seriously! As an \"out of towner\" who has access to much better sushi elsewhere, I don't see the appeal to this place.  The sushi is mediocre. Even the word 'mediocre' is an understatement in this case.   Don't get me wrong - this isn't a 'one-off' for me. I've frequent their establishment more than I should have. You know, those times when you're hanging out and you happen to be super starving, don't want to drive far and ubereats just won't cut it.   It's cheap, that's about it. That's the only reason why I could see people coming back.  However, when it comes down to the extremely mediocre quality, terrible (TERRIBLY grumpy all.the.time.) service, sticky tables with flies everywhere, is it reaaaally worth it? Is the value really still there?  Locals are well aware of the unadvertised/unspoken 10% percent discount off your bill. I`m not referring to their take-out, cash-only deal. It exists, 10%off your AYCE lunch or dinner meal. You may get it, you may not get it. Depends on your server and how they feel, even if you ask about it.  At the end of every meal here, I`m filled with regrets of not attempting to persuade my group into paying a few dollars more and going elsewhere.  TLDR; Go somewhere else. Even sushi at Nations is fresher than this."}
{"text":"Terrible service had to argue with the workers there of the pricing. Food is not fresh. Dirty and awful communication."}
{"text":"Some of the worse service I've ever gotten. We got food that we didn't order and when we asked what it was our server said it very quietly and when asked to repeat she gave us a very dirty look and walked way. For the rest of our time there she did not acknowledge our existence and walked away from us when we asked for anything, even though we weren't a large group ( just me and my sister). Also the food is mediocre."}
{"text":"Party of 5 ordered this awesome sushi platter for 4 along with salmon salads and udon. Awesome!  And huge portions!  My cousin and his family come here all of the time and probably us. If we lived here, we would be coming all of the time too!"}
{"text":"Worst service. Sure you get good prices but the servers are way too slow. Never going here again. Dining in sucks, take out sucks, KYOTO SUSHI SUCKS"}
{"text":"If you're looking for AYCE sushi, do yourself a favour and drive a little east to Hockey Sushi. The food is very mediocre at Kyoto, the service is terrible and the ambiance feels like a diner. We came here on someone's recommendation, but I realize now they probably don't get out much.   We definitely won't be back. Save your money."}
{"text":"I tried this place about a year ago and had dead fruit flies in my salad.  I thought I would give it another chance and actually sit and eat however this time I had hair in my salad.  When I told them they didn't seem to care like it's a normal thing over there.    Noodles were good, ribs had so much fat on them.  Calamari was good.  Ice cream was good.  The sushi was not rolled properly actually the worst roll I have ever come accross.  I ordered a fried banana for desert and it was so cold and hard not mushy like normal places.  I told the waiter it was not fresh and she barked at me saying it was fresh and walked away.  As we were getting up she tossed another one at me.  The very worst customer service I have ever seen, not one hello, can I get you anything, tables were not cleared.  Not worth a penny"}
{"text":"It's cheap but you pay for what you get. I found a fruit fly today in my spicy mayo... I wonder how it got there. I seen a worker going outside a lot to smoke and he was wearing the aperain still .. not really hygenic"}
{"text":"Great food.  We usually do take out and we always end up with a surprise roll as an extra.  The extra service attention is great.  Best sushi place in the area"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times and today I found that their food has dramatically improved from the last time I was here. It was only $21.95 for all you can eat on a Sunday! Which is definitely a steal considering AYCE on weekends are $25+. Their food definitely doesn't reflect their price. It was amazing for $22 AYCE especially the beef teriyaki and salmon pizza. The only reason I'm giving them 3 stars was because their service was extremely slow and avoided eye contact with my entire family."}
{"text":"Love, love, LOVE this place. Been living in the city for 2 years and I still come back to this place whenever I want excellent, fresh tasting sushi for a great price. Been a lover of sushi since I can remember and no AYCE sushi joint even compares to Kyoto. Service isn't the greatest but the food comes out quick and never fails to impress. Great quality (and incredibly inexpensive) take out too. Good luck getting a table anytime after 6pm - the place is always jam packed for dinner, for good reason. Not a doubt in my mind, you gotta eat here!"}
{"text":"I hope Kyoto means AMAZING in Japanese because this place served me the best sushi ive ever had. I got it to go, they told me to wait 15mins (gosh they had so many customers) but still finished early. The sushi was reasonably priced and OMG the portions were very generous. The staff was so friendly, needless to say i recommend this place for everyone!"}
{"text":"The food was just OK. Beef short ribs were very tasty and same with their soba noodles. However we had hair in our salads and the service was HORRIBLE. These people need to take a course on customer services as it was terrible."}
{"text":"I'm so glad that this place was recommended to me. The price point for the sushi is more than fair for the quality of the rolls that you are receiving. Each time I visit this restaurant I leave about five pounds heavier than when I arrived because I can't help but pig out lol. It is hands down one of my favourite sushi spots in Vaughan!"}
{"text":"Excellent sushi, best price in the area. What I like about this place is the competitive price and the fact that I've been there 3 times since the grand opening in Jan 2012, and they keep getting better everytime. If they continue on this track, they'll really be on top of the game in the area. Changed my rating to a five star after the most recent visit."}
{"text":"One of the worst sushi places I've ever been too. Sushi was not fresh what so ever, so for the people saying it's fresh, I really don't know if we are talking about the same restaurant. The waitresses were all so rude, pay the extra few bucks and go someone good. The sushi here literally tasted like complete crap. Not to mention i felt sick, when I left. The menu seems like it is so big but if you genuinely look at it and read it, everything is the same just a few stuff was added to make it seem different. Disgusting place, and I also saw the waitress drop the soy sauce lid off the container and she put it back on as if no one saw. Hygiene here needs to be improved, this is exactly mall sushi in a restaurant, but mall sushi is for sure better than this place. Please pat a few extra dollars and go somewhere good."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend for the lunch AYCE menu on Friday afternoon. It was a pretty small restaurant and packed, but the inside is nicely decorated. A downside is the size of the restaurant, as we sat between two tables that were very close together which did not give us much privacy.   I found the sushi to be quite good and fresh, however, the rolls tend to fall apart, as the rice was harder and \"grainier\" than other restaurants. I also found the AYCE lunch menu to be more limited than other AYCE establishments I've been to. The portions of the sushi were also slightly larger than other places, which filled us up quicker.   The service here is also lacking (not sure if this is the usual, since it was packed when we came). Food took a while to come out, some orders did not arrive, and the waitresses were scrambling around every table, confused on which table ordered what. We also had to ask for a bottle of soy sauce (was not on our table) and a fork twice before a waitress arrived with the items.  Overall, I found the food to be good, but there are many better AYCE sushi establishments in the area."}
{"text":"Honestly. My boyfriend and I always try new sushi places. And by far this beats everything. And the price is actually rly good. I went there last night and I was so full the meat was actually delicious and so tender and juicy oh my. It was amazing. I don't live near here but I'm sure gona travel the 25 mins just to come here that's how freaken good it is. I love it"}
{"text":"The rice is very plain and tasteless. I don't think they season it at all. Everything they have is just meh. I am a frequent AYCE sushi eater and visit 7-8 of Woodbridge's sushi places (except I haven't been the mushroom place on 7/pine valley), and this is the least favorite one of all."}
{"text":"The salmon on the sushi literally melts in your mouth. Would go to Montreal again just for this :P"}
{"text":"The sushi here is decent quality and VRRY CHEAP ($2.95-3.95) and for that it is a great place to stop at for a quick roll or two. But the service is horrendous. There is no system in place for seating and I was confused the second we walked in the door and the hostess blankly stared at us (should I leave?). When we were finally seated it was next to the aquarium at a tiny table in the corner and given paper menus and pencils to order. The girl helping us at that moment seemed friendly but she was the only one.  When I saw our order was ready, the servers were just mopping the floors around guests and laughing and ignoring the prepared food. Since I was seated so close to the food prep area, I had the opportunity to watch my order stand there for several minutes before someone finally broke from their very important and humorous conversation, and noticed it was ready.  As we were eating the girls continued to mop the floors around us, my table was surrounded by wet floor. It reeked of cleaning chemicals in my food while I was trying to eat and I couldn't get up to go to the washroom. It seemed as though they were trying to kick us out so they can close faster, but this was at 8pm and they close at 11!  The food was good and fresh and for the REALLY cheap price, I would recommend you go here with zero expectations of service and only for the sake of getting some cheap food (and inhaling some cleaning chemicals while you're a"}
{"text":"I love this place.  IMO, best price to quality ratio you can find.  We keep looking for other places to mix it up but we keep coming back to Kyoto because we're always disappointed with the other places that we find."}
{"text":"Great sushi place. Very small place. The outside and inside are not the anything to write home about, but that doesn't matter once you try the sushi. The menu is basically soup, salad and sushi... So if you want more don't waste your time!  All of the rolls we had were wonderful and the amount of fish in each roll was bigger than I have seen in years. They had very good flavors and selections. I loved the simple salad and the miso was not bad.   If I am back in the area I would for sure go back. I would love to have a place like this down the street to hit up once a week. Do yourself a favor and try it."}
{"text":"Of all the AYCE sushi places I've been to, this place has to be on the bottom of my list. The service was not the worst, but also not the greatest - as expected for AYCE.  The main reason I'm giving this place only 1 star is because the food they served us was not as fresh as they could be.  All of the deep fried items seemed to have been pre-fried, and left until someone ordered. It was disgusting, to eat tempura.  The rice was cold and hard, causing most of the rolls to not only taste weird but also fall apart.  With the combination of my two complaints, the yam tempura roll came out really bad. I don't think I am asking for too much but I expected the yam tempura to be freshly fried before being put into my roll.  Near the end, I finally got my deep fried scallop order, and to my surprise, this is the ONLY thing that came freshly fried - and it was nearly burnt!!  With that, I conclude that for the most popularly ordered tempura/deep fried items, they pre-fry it and leave it until someone orders it. I understand they want to provide speedy service, but it is unacceptable to sacrifice the quality of the food to achieve it."}
{"text":"I'm conflicted.   Quality and quantity is no issue at this location. However, customer service is what it lacks.   Beginning with food,  kyoto offers AYCE or a large cart with heavily discounted rolls. I like Kyoto because the sushi is above part for an AYCE. You can taste the different elements of the sushi and the rice is mildly sweet.   In terms of service,  it was nearly nonexistent. I found myself calling over the staff and they would walk past unacknowledgingly. Lacks common manners as well. However food comes out in reasonable time.   To end what I began, I'm conflicted. Good sushi,  terrible service."}
{"text":"This place is perfect if you want a value lunch, and want options to choose from.  The price here is amazing for AYCE sushi.  All the standard rolls, appetizer, tempura and dishes are available for lunch.  I recommend the Green Dragon roll, the avocados on top were perfectly melt in your mouth ripe.  The amount of rice per sushi piece is a little too generous thou ;) This is a nice no frill place to grab a casual lunch."}
{"text":"Made a reservation for a large party, and after arriving 5 minutes late, they had informed us that they gave our reservation away! The manager said they couldn't wait for us! They care more about $$$ than customer satisfaction! We've been here before and the sushi is ok for the price, but you could probably get something similar elsewhere."}
{"text":"The sushis were subpar - unevenly sized and not wrapped properly. There isn't too much variation here."}
{"text":"Best Price for sushi I've seen in a while. This is our go to sushi joint. Only problem is the seating time after 6pm SO LONG."}
{"text":"It's a very nice and calm restaurant, almost chic kind of, but you can still go there in casual with friends or your loved one. The staff there are great and the chef is awesome! In my opinion, the price isn't too high compared to some very high class restaurant."}
{"text":"I had a large order as I was entertaining some guests and they go the extra mile to do a wonderful job in the presentation and they included some extra items no charge. It pays that they remember the frequent customers."}
{"text":"Really amazing place for sushi after work. A lot variety of sushi, noodles and hand roll. Sadly few options for sushi. Customer service is great here. Place is very nice too a bit small if you cant wait you can ask for take out menu."}
{"text":"Graffitti on the walls and it seems to be accumulating, staff that is inattentive at best and rude at worst. Continually recieved food we did not order. Server stuck her thumb in all the soups. Food got extremely sloppy when closing time neared to the point of being inedible.  Do not go. Ever."}
{"text":"Once you've been to this restaurant you'll never want to go back to sushi buffets again (unless you have to for some group activity). The food is awesome, the service is wonderful (I've been there so many times that the staff recognizes me) and the place is very warm and welcoming filled with lovely Japanese decor. If you're a sushi lover, you definitely have to go to this place. It's like being in sushi heaven!   P.S. I highly recommend the Sushi Pizza. It's not made like any other!"}
{"text":"Kyoto is by far one of the best all you can eat sushi places in Vaughan! The fish tastes fresh compared to a lot of the other sushi places iv been to. It's also not as expensive as other sushi restaurants and their all you can eat menu has a large selection!  You have to try their pink lady speciality roll! It's my favourite !!!  Their take out menu is great and cheap. Pretty much the same selection as all you can eat and you can get rolls for as cheap as $3!  Kyoto is my go to sushi place. Try it, you won't be disappointed !"}
{"text":"Honestly the most overrated Japanese restaurant in Vaughan. Service slow, the restaurant is filthy, and the food is mediocre."}
{"text":"Giving them a 4. The place is nice as it has nice decor and I like how they played kpop.  My only problem with this restaurant is the rice on the sushi. It didn't taste soft but more grainy and harder than usual. This made all the rolls fall apart which was unfortunate. The reason why I'm giving them a 4 is because of the price. I got 3 six piece and 3 eight piece sushi for only $24 because of their 50% promotion. It was a good place to eat but not the best."}
{"text":"Second time here. First time around the service was great, got food very quickly and the staff were very friendly. This time around, not so much... We had to order rolls 3 times in order for us to get the proper order. Still the food is really great. Still recommended this place to my friends & family."}
{"text":"The place is packed on Fridays.   Very small for the crowd it gets so it's very noisy and little kids are easily distracted.  It's really a sushi making factory pumping out lots of food quickly and tables turn over relatively quick.  Not a first-date place and not a relaxing place on a Friday.  Dine-pay-leave. The food is very good.  Try the salmon, avocado and strawberry roll - delicious."}
{"text":"I'm from Seattle where \"All You Can Eat\" sushi isn't a thing, so coming here got the inner fat girl in me super excited!  I was warned beforehand that the service wasn't that great and I would say that was somewhat true. They don't really speak to you; just throw your food down and move on. The friendliness part of the service is non-existent but at least they're quick at getting the food out to you.  I'll admit, I'm a bit of an American snob and believe American food is a whole lot better than Canadian food. However, the sushi did not disappoint! It was extremely fresh and well made. Definitely a place I'd come back to."}
{"text":"Best sushi in all of Montreal the best food. Fresh sushi made the day of. Amazing service they are so polite and kind. The ice cream is homemade and delicious. The sashimi is delicious have never had anything so fresh in all of Montreal. Their menu can get $$ at night so if you can go for lunch its best they have combos that are not as $$ as dinner. They have a nice selection of sake and beer. I ave come back here many times and the service and quality of the food is amazing. I recommend you make a reservation on the weekends as it is a small home like feeling restaurant. And its worth the wait for the food."}
{"text":"pretty good food, i don't really like the ordering system though, staff is mediocrely friendly"}
{"text":"Good food great service decent price.  They must have removed Eel but they have great sashimi.  My favorite fish would be the butterfish.  I've never heard anyone call it that before.  Some say Whitefish, white tuna, and some say albacore definitely not that.  Taste it it has a Cream flavor like coffee creamer best thing to get there."}
{"text":"By far the best quality sushi I have had in Vaughan!! The prices are extremely reasonable and cheaper than most other places that do not compare in quality. In my opinion the decor and service do have room for improvement but the sushi itself is absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"Their AYCE prices cannot be beat, 15$ for lunch and 22$ for dinner. The crispy crab rolls are the best!! The menu isn't extensive (look at the price!) very roll heavy, a few vegetarian options. Staff aren't too friendly but that could be because the student clientele can be jerks. Drinks are extra, about 2$ for pop. Desserts are all ice cream and a banana tempura (the green tea is always the best)"}
{"text":"Listen I've said it before and I'll say it again: BEST VALUE AYCE IN WOODBRIDGE  There is not a single AYCE place on Woodbridge that can match this place for quality, freshness, speed, and price point. When we have places charging near $30 per person this place is still tremendous value at both lunch and dinner at $12 and $19 respectively.   The real value lies in the selection of rolls which are $3, $4 and $6 depending on the list you get them from. Unheard of ordering a la carte. Their best values lie in their take out platters.  No other place can give you that amount of quality maki rolls for that price. Not that I've found anyways and I've nearly tried every place in Woodbridge and Markham.   They've won \"best of Vaughan\" awards and owner is all about volume and quality. If you understand this is Chinese made AYCE, then it's really hard to do better than this place.   My favour place and I try to make it a point to come here for take out or AYCE everytime I visit my family in Woodbridge or go to Vaughan Mills."}
{"text":"Kyoto sushi did a home catering at a party I attended and I must say it was pretty awesome. Everything was fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"We decided to drop by one day after work as me and my colleague were craving some sushi - or rather, LOTS of sushi - and opted for their AYCE dinner. Around $20, which is great as other AYCE usually charge well over $25 for their dinners. You'd think that because their price is low, the quality of the food would be too. Yet nope! You'd be wrong. One word - yum! Oh my god, the food! The food was delicious and came out quickly, and you could tell it was fresh! I think we nearly had 20 plates, if not more! The fried scallops were divine, and the green tea ice-cream is a must have here.   While unlike other AYCE, Kyoto does not (yet) have iPad ordering, their traditional method of check marking your order on a piece of paper and handing it to your server was very humbling in this age of electronics. I'll be honest, the seating is not much, but even so, the atmosphere is familial and tight knit without being claustrophobic and too close. I disagree with the previous reviews about poor customer service; our server was lovely despite there being an obvious language barrier between us which is no problem for me as we were there for the food  - which certainly met, if not exceeded, our expectations and that makes it worth it. Would recommend to anyone and everyone looking for an AYCE after a long day of shopping at the local mall."}
{"text":"When it opened it was better. They would forget stuff, but they would apologies. The fish was good back then, the cooks most of the time were more diligent.   As it got busy, quality cost and service kept getting worse. Last times we went we spaced out the visits, but it was consistently worse and worse. So we will no longer go back.  The BAD  - Always forgetting orders, you will be told its coming its coming, then they will ask you to write it out again 20-30 minutes later, many times saw it happen to others too. - Mixing up table orders, putting it down on wrong tables, walking away.- If people touch food and send stuff back, it seems they will SEND IT OUT TO ANOTHER TABLE, keep an eye out !!! - Sushi immediately falling apart - Sushi having less fish more rice, and tempura mush - Fish itself tasting cheap   The GOOD:  + Location... not much around there  This place and AYCE but otherwise not worth it anymore."}
{"text":"I love kyoto. Food is amazing. Spicy crab roll with a side of spicy mayo is my fave. When it's busy, they're bound to mess up, thats ok. They always bring it out when you ask. Drink glasses are old and dirty. I use to skip class just to make it for lunch.."}
{"text":"Kyoto is a hidden gem, that serves delicious fresh sushi.  It's a very cozy Japanese restaurant, perfect for a date or even a family dinner. We took the maki combo for 2 people and added extra sushi rolls, which you can order à la carte. The portions are perfect, the prices are affordable and the wait time was decent for what we ordered and considering the restaurant was full. The sushi was delicious, and you can definitely taste the freshness of the ingredients.  Extra tip: if you plan on coming during a Friday or Saturday evening, reserving ahead of time would be a good idea as the place can be full."}
{"text":"ordered cali rolls and spicy tuna. pretty good rolls.    Service was terrible but I went here to eat not to judge the customer service."}
{"text":"Not my favourite place for lunch sushi visits.  The service was awful - we asked our server three times for our drinks. There wasn't much of a veggie selection either which threw a wrench in the gears for my gluten free friend. They would not make an exception or alteration to the menu so she asked for a la carte instead which they did not take well what so ever.  The kitchen items were duplicated and at one point we had to ask the staff to stop bringing things out as they were already received (and eaten!) The food we ordered tasted alright, nothing to complain about there. The menu is a bit misleading though, for example: the spicy crunchy salmon description says green onions and is served without. I am not a fan of the green onions so I was happy but others who do like it may end up disappointed. Kyoto also uses so much rice in their sushi! 3/4 of us had plates full of rice but thankfully we were not charged or harassed about this.  They do have high ceilings so be warned, it can get very, very loud during peak hours.  I likely won't return only because there are other great sushi spots near by that are 5/5 in my books."}
{"text":"This little gem in the heart of St-Laurent walking street is the bomb!  I'm an avid sushi lover, have probably tried all the high end sushi places in Montreal so trust me when I say that this is the peak of price for quality. You won't find any fancy fusion rolls here or elaborate sauces, but if you love good quality sashimi this is the place. Everything was really fresh and the sashimi servings were very generous. Probably the biggest eel piece I've had in all of Montréal! The eel towered over the rice ball that held it up.  Basic rolls also but well executed. Quiet and laid back atmosphere with serves well for a casual date or night out with friends. Only critic I have is that the service is tremendously slow ... It's a mom and pop joint and only the pop makes the sushi so be prepared to wait! If you want something to compare it to, it compares to yasu sushi in Brossard, but much closer to where I live :)"}
{"text":"This small unassuming sushi bar is very nice. Decor is on the basic side but the food is great. Nice salads and delicious rolls. Fish is very fresh and service friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"Over the years, the quality of Kyoto's food started to waver. It is definitely more fresh than Masa, the sushi restaurant at the plaza across. However, I wouldn't say Kyoto is the best sushi place in Woodbridge anymore. I used to love coming here all the time. Great price, and decent service. I only do take-out now. They are pretty fast, and their prices are competitive. Sometimes the rolls are really small, and the rice breaks very easily, but the sushi itself tastes pretty good for its price.  Should you decide to dine in at any day of the week, you are supplied a sheet to write your orders on and wooden chopsticks. I recommend the seaweed salad as a starter, ans teriyaki salmon for an appetizer. It's hard to get a waiter to notice you sometimes....I only know one of them is friendly. The rest started to become a bit desensitized from years of working here, I suppose. When you finish your meal, its still hard to get a waiter's  attention unless the place is 1/3 full, or less. Ironically, if you finish your meal and start chatting, you are given your bill without asking for it. I'm not insulted by this practice, but I know there are a few who are.   I would still return for the factors of efficiency and cost."}
{"text":"Poor customer service, the lady at the front desk was probably having a bad day but she didn't have to be so rude to her customers. Ordered 5 rolls, and asked for 3 sauce. They never charged me before, but the lady didn't like us and started arguing with us over 1 sauce for .50 cents. Her name was Lily.  update:  Previously gave them 4 stars."}
{"text":"I'm giving them a 4.5. I'm taking half a star off because the rolls didn't stay together that well. That being said, the sushi was delicious. So far I like this one the best in terms of taste for my sushi lunches in Vaughan. I can tell a lot of other people do as the place was packed! It's a bit small but we were seated very quickly after we arrived. There were three of us and I was sitting beside a fish tank. Awks but whatever.  The food took a little while to come out at first so it's best to order as soon as you get in there. I really enjoyed the spicy salmon and the few other spicy rolls we had.  The ice cream was good but small. Order two! I will definitely be visiting this place again! 10 % their all you can eat menu for being rated #1 sushi in Vaughan (in 2012 I think). My lunch with tax came up to $13.33. I was happy with that!"}
{"text":"I've been to Kyoto several times, and its one of the best places in Vaughan to grab high quality sushi at a more than reasonable price. It's a very popular restaurant in Vaughan that has always been packed to the brim with people when I've sat to eat.   The seating is slightly cramped. There's a lot of ambient conversations in the air, but not so much so that you can't carry on your own conversation. The servers are plentiful, and are quick with service.   I have always had a high quality of fish when I've dined here. Recently, I would say that the sushi rollers are being put to work with all the customers, so on my last two occasions in dining here, my sushi has been rolled loose; however, having said that, the meal is always fantastic.   All in all, great sushi in Vaughan that I will continue to frequent. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Sushi here is good, except they never seem have the spider roll (soft shell crab) whenever I go which is crucial for me. The service sometimes hasn't been the best, with servers being rude. But it's not a big deal, other than that I enjoy eating here."}
{"text":"Clean, well appointed restaurant. Friendly service in both languages. We ordered the sushi combination plate. The food was of excellent quality and presentation. Our server was very busy handling the entire restaurant of more than 20 patrons by himself and he did a superb job. We look forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"This is my fav neighbourhood sushi place. I go once every two weeks and I've never had a bad experience. Fish is always fresh, and the sushis always taste good. The fish selection is more elaborate than other small restaurants (squid, crab) and for the same price as other generic sushi restaurants, you get better tasting and fresher sushis. Def my go-to sushi place.   Also, the sushi portions are very generous here."}
{"text":"Kyoto is one of the many all you can eat Japanese Restaurants in Woodbridge. It's prices are definitely better than its competitors in the area and the staples are decent.  One of my favourite appetizers is the soft shell crab. And seeing as we went for lunch, we decided to order off their à la carte menu to see if there was a difference in quality. There is definitely more selection. E.g. the AYCE does not include sashimi, nor my soft shell crab.  We decided to order the soft shell crab, the spider roll, and the hibachi chicken which are not on the AYCE menu. Then we added some items which were. These we mainly rolls: spicy salmon, black dragon, and dynamite roll. We also added Shrimp tempura to see if there were any differences between à la carte and AYCE. There were none.  Bottom line, if you plan on ordering any type of combo box, bento box, or set dinner, go for the AYCE, it'll be a better value in the sense that you can have more variety. If you're into specific dishes and those are not on the AYCE menu, you'll need to find a more expensive place that will have those items on the menu (e.g. beef tataki, sashimi, etc.). Lastly, if you plan on AYCE, try to go with a group of 6 as you can't order many items by the piece. The larger group will allow you more variety if everyone has some of each dish.  I give Kyoto 3 stars because of the super competitive pricing. The food is nothing spectacular, and the AYCE menu is limited (at least to the items I enjoy); furthermore the inability to order items by the piece punishes small groups and those who wish to try new items (the menu states that wasted food will be charged full price, but ive never heard of this being reinforced). I've included the menu in my pics, see if the AYCE suits you and decide for yourself."}
{"text":"We were a group of 8 and we got there by 11:30 a.m.  We were the 2nd group there but the largest group at the time.  It still took a while to get our food.  It took close to 5 mins to get our appetizers.  One person ordered a couple of hand rolls and it took close to 25 mins to get them.  Sometimes we got sushi that we didn't even order.   I would highly recommend the shrimp tempura, crispy mayo crab, and the mango ice cream."}
{"text":"I've eaten here since their grand opening a few years back, usually getting take-out nowadays and occasionally sitting-in. This place is as good as it gets for AYCE sushi in this area (sorry not sorry Masa sushi/Ginza). Reasonable prices (where else are you going to get fresh sushi at $3/roll?), fast service and yummy food. Sometimes they skimp on eel but that's okay - just order more.  People complaining about the service obviously don't know what to expect when eating an Asian restaurant. Service is brisk, there's generally no up-selling and patrons shouldn't be expected to linger long after your meal. Eat and get out (not saying I ever felt rushed because I didn't). My measure of good service in an Asian restaurant is how quickly I'm acknowledged, take my order & bring my food. If you're looking for the waiter to ask how your day is going - you're in the wrong place lol. It can get pretty packed here during lunch/weekends so be prepared to wait!   Recommend: try the chicken yaki (fried udon noodles) and dynamite roll!"}
{"text":"This place is growing on me, but there are many things that bother me. The service is absolutely horrendous and their soy-sauce isn't the greatest, but this place is improving in terms of quality.  They do have great tasting sushi/rolls, and their menu is quite large - which is great.  I do go here from time to time as my friend lives close and chooses to go here, but by all means, I would not go out of my way to come here.   Still ordering off papers as opposed to iPads like most sushi places are now.  I think what frustrates me the most is that when I want 10 salmon.. I want 10.  Not 5 - not 8 - not 7... I want 10.  And I ordered 10 for a reason... so I'm not sure why they don't bring you what you ordered - especially when it's not an absurd request.  And every single time I go, there is always at least one item (whether a roll/salad) that just never comes. No matter how many times you re-order it.  Not sure if there is a misunderstanding, or they don't have that item in stock - but there's no communication about it.    All in all, I'd recommend going here to give it a shot. Price is very good -- $22 including tax for AYCE dinner on a Friday night. So its a great value, but you may not get everything you ordered... but when the food is good, you might be able to overlook it."}
{"text":"I'm a sushi lover and if you are too this is the place to go ! I always ask for the assorted plate for two people and three people can eat from it as the portions are generous.  This is a family business so you know the service will be the best.  One tip when you go there: don't go if you're starving because the service might be slow since there's only one chef. Still the wait is always worth it as the food is delicious !!"}
{"text":"Dined here for lunch based on a friends recommendation and will definitely go back.  This restaurant sits where Bronx Burgers once was, near a Turtle Jacks and a Starbucks. As it's in a plaza, parking can be a problem, but it's worth the hassle.  Once seated, at your table you will find an order form of what they have available...it's just a simple matter of selecting what you want ( they even provide pencils) and the quantity. The waitress picks the form and shortly thereafter your food arrives.  With this format, you can be as adventuresome as you want, or stick to tried and true favourites.   We took a friend who was in from Windsor to this place and we thought she had died and gone to heaven....amazing price, fresh food, wonderful flavours, great ambiance, friendly staff, generous portion sizes. She ordered a wine and the glass was filled to the brim.....don't know if this is the norm, but it provided a cheap buzz on a fairly decent, reasonably priced, white wine  The only issue we had is that some items we ordered never arrived....and when we reordered them a 2nd time...it didn't come as well. I guess edamame was scarce that day, as was spicy tuna rolls.  Despite this small hiccup, we will go back again, and again, and gain."}
{"text":"I have been here many times and the sushi always impress me, from freshness of the avocado to the quick service. The price lunch time is great. Will be coming much more to get my sushi fix!"}
{"text":"I go here almost every week because it's affordable and satisfies my sushi cravings every time. The food comes out super quick and the quality is quite comparable to other  expensive AYCE places. Without ordering a drink my bill is under $16 for lunch. The crispy crab, pink lady (only available at dinner) and 007 roll are my favourites."}
{"text":"This is by far the best value you can get in the GTA. It's not the best sushi I've had, but it's really decent while being incredibly cheap. The AYCE lunch is insane at like 12 bucks taxes in, especially since the hand rolls are included."}
{"text":"Surprise de la qualité des assiettes , des bons saveurs , bien presenté, service attentioné. Jolies baquettes. Quartier à découvrir."}
