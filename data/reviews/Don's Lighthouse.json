{"text":"save your money.. i was there last nite. the server was great an d very cordial, but the food was way under par...the potatoes were hard, no carbonation in the 2 soft drinks i had to return , asked for the dressing for my salad on the side of course the opposite, the salmon overcooked. i didnt say anything about that. ill give the restaurant 2 yrs to survive w/ food like that. time for a kitchen overhaul of the staff. terrible for 83 bucks, should have went to wendys"}
{"text":"Let me start with we were giving a $250 gift card as a gift . We used every bit of it   We started with 20 raw oysters,  then lobster bisque.  Then we ordered king crab legs , and double large lobster tails. Having lived in Maine  I will say I have never been to a seafood restaurant  that was as spot on with serves and food as Don's lighthouse  is. It took us back to our time in Maine ."}
{"text":"Just got in from my maiden voyage to Don's Lighthouse....   Walked in at 8:30 p.m. to the sounds of Chicago, don't know what song or record but had to be one of their hits, from the 70's. The only thing more empty than the song was the restaurant. Never afraid to state the obvious, I ask \"How does this place stay in business?\" Sea-faring obviously isn't in season so I give them the benefit of the doubt.   We are seated in the ubiquitous hunter green table trimmed with the equally offensive wainscot effect; the same type of combination that is responsible for doing in countless other eateries throughout the midwest. Service is speedy and efficient. Beer is quick to follow and cold and the salad is seasonably fresh with ample fruit strewn about. Two for two.   Shortly after the $5 burger arrives with more than a handful of fries. Perfect. I've easily paid double before but that argument isn't even worth having. The burger was a top five entry. The fries were also delicious. The Monday night special did not disappoint...still, I'm left wondering how such a massive place has managed to stay afloat?? Does the city of Cleveland support these guys financially as some type of a historic landmark or grant? You could fit the graduating class of Strongsville High inside the place yet there is only me and my guest and maybe three other tables requiring service; one of which hosted a guy talking about politics... \"This country is five years in the hole but I'm confident Obama is the guy to get us out.\" I decline to announce his term is only four years. I guess from the looks of the decor the management at Don's Lighthouse is equally as bad at judging time. I digress.   Overall though I am equally impressed by the service and common sense to try to bring people in to sample different items at \"the nice price\" much the same as by the unintentional nice job of making the place hipster-unfriendly. The place is simply too huge though and they could really trim down or maybe offer a tour or make some extra dough and turn the place into a haunted lighthouse around Halloween. Dunno. Place would be smart to at least get creative; sell some sampling of micros, (selection consisted of Labatt, Bud and Great Lakes Dortmunder) and possibly update the tired (but clean) decor. Property has to be through the roof.   From one to ten:   Service: 9 Atmosphere: 3 Alcohol selection: 5 Price: 6.5 Food: 9 Amentities: 9 (on site free parking access to the highway)  Overall: 7.5"}
{"text":"For the first time, I visited Don's last night in hopes of picking up some takeout.  I have heard good things about Don's and decided to give it a try.  Unfortunately, after waiting for 15 minutes for service after being given a menu at a deserted bar, I decided to take my business elsewhere.  No matter how good the food may be, it does not make up for poor service."}
{"text":"Great food, friendly wait staff. Due to noise level only gave 4 stars. Will definitely go again though."}
{"text":"Oh Don's.    I've been here twice, the first time for lunch and the second (more recently) for dinner.  When I came for lunch, I believe it was on a Tuesday, we were one of the only tables at the bar and the service and food were both quite good.  I think I had the French Onion soup and a salad.  However, I am basing this review on my dinner experience there.  Four of us went, during restaurant week, and all chose to go with the three course prix fixe.  First, however, we had an order of shrimp cocktail.  Now, I don't know what the white sauce that comes with it is (it's vaguely tartar-y, but not quite?), but it was out of this world!    For my three courses I tried the bistro salad, pretzel-crusted walleye and the bread pudding.  The bistro salad was tasty, a standard mixed green salad.  The massive portion of walleye was quite good, and was served with a dijon sauce, mashed yukon gold potatoes and some kind of corn succotash.  The bread pudding was alright, served with chocolate and a few strawberries, but nothing to write home about.  Overall the meal was large and good, 4 stars for the food-definitely worth the $30 price tag.  The service, however, left a bad taste in my mouth.  Now, I realize it was busy, but my god, man.  Our server first brought out the wrong beer for the only one my dining mates that ordered an alcoholic beverage (I mean, there are only three beers on tap, c'mon).  Everything came out vvvvery slowly after that, and after sitting for nearly twenty minutes after our entree plates were cleared, she came to ask it we wanted to see a dessert menu (ummmm, we already ordered our dessert, thanks).  It probably took another 20 minutes for our dessert to come out and then another 20 for our check.  The restaurant had all but cleared out at this point, so it was getting super irritating.    Summary:  good food (nothing special), bad service.  I will try again because I see that other yelpers have given the service glowing reviews and it's close to home."}
{"text":"I read the reviews and picked this for my birthday....a standby for good food in Cleveland is right!  Our party of six is hard to please...rarely is everyone happy with a choice (we go out for six birthday a year...in laws and us). Start with the bad...the cocktails took a little too long..the calamari was obviously frozen outta the box and not great..we ate it but not great and the Thai chilli sauce is good but not homemade..our waiter..a bearded Bruce Willis (moonlighting Bruce Willis age). Had excellent recommendations with scallops in a fantastic risotto...walleye was good with a strong pretzel mustard flavor..crab legs cooked perfect...nothing left of the cedarlank salmon..two lobster tales at the table mine was perfect the other was a bit under (said it was a bit slimy). Two of us got the prefix $33 meal which is a salad or app, meal and dessert...excellenT value ...atmosphere was a bit odd with crappy old speakers playing 80s music and grandpas galore at the bar...one had his grand kids that was inappropriate for my tastes...hey it's the west side....definitely go back and everyone was pleased..."}
{"text":"My husband surprised me with a nice Sweetest Dinner. We had never heard of this place before and had a great night!!! The food was wonderful, the atmosphere was fun and the service was very friendly!!! I was also impressed to see gluten free options on the menu. The lobster bisque and chowders were the best we had found in Cleveland!! Definitely five it 5 stars!!!!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour. Great menu. Great fine dining experience. A better value & service than near buy \"Pier\" . A true cleveland staple."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and each time it keeps getting better.  Ordered the seafood pasta, it was great, ordered the duck, it was great, ordered the steak and lobster, it was the best steak I've ever eaten.   The martinis are pretty excellent also.  This is by far one of my favorite restaurants in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Perfect service.  Excellent food.  What more could you ask for?  This old favorite never fails to meet or exceed my expectations."}
{"text":"Lame, food was underwhelming,  i got the catch of the day which was some type of snapper and I swear i could have got bettwr seafood at red lobster.  The service also i was not impressed woth, our waitress was very rushed. And i felt often we were being ignored.  Decor is outdated,  we dont plan on going again."}
{"text":"Service: 2 stars Food: 4 stars  My wife and I had wanted to go to Don's for several years, and finally went the other night. It is considered a Cleveland classic for good reasons: iconic building, lakeside location, interesting menu, nice wine list. After an inordinately long wait for our glasses of wine to be delivered (more on the service later); I ordered the Portuguese seafood stew and the bistro salad, and my wife had the rainbow trout and the iceberg wedge. We also \"shared\" a bowl of the French onion soup (wife had mostly the broth, I had mostly the fantastic cheese on top). The soup and salads were great, as was the bread served at the table. The stew was definitely 5-star, with a broth that was so savory, we were fighting over \"dipping rights\" by the time there were only a few drops left. The trout itself was very good. The dish is normally served with horseradish creamed spinach. My wife, being neither a fan of horseradish nor creamed anything, asked for Brussels sprouts instead. This is where the service started to tank (again, after the long wait for the vino, so it had really already started).  The trout was served on a bed of the creamed spinach, the flavors of which  infused the whole dish. This was not a good outcome for someone who likes neither horseradish nor cream. My wife reminded the server that she had asked for Brussels sprouts instead. When the sprouts arrived, they were lukewarm and largely unseasoned. There was also a service snafu with the bread. As I mentioned above, it was great--the problem was getting enough of it. The first additional serving arrived without incident, albeit only half the amount of the first batch. When we powered through that, two subsequent requests for more went unheeded. When the server was reminded of that, she became defensive. An apology would have gone farther than defensiveness.  Will we be back? Definitely. Will we make sure we don't have the same server next time? Absolutely!"}
{"text":"Three adults and one tween enjoyed dinner there. We shared orders of stuffed mushrooms and bruschetta, both tasty appetizers. Three of us enjoyed our fish dinners; the vegetarian was very satisfied with the vegan ravioli. Great, timely service, great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Don's is one of the most consistently great restaurants I've been to. It's pricey but they have weekly specials and a great happy hour. The service is always great as well.  I always get their filet because it's so perfect so I can't speak much to the rest of the menu :o)"}
{"text":"I will not support a business who turns away business!!! Went for happy hour, entered and waited about 5 minutes before being greeted by anyone. Servers walked by, bartenders stared at me, and a man who appeared to be a host looked at me and answered a phone before saying a word to me. I saw a packed bar with two open tables with reserved signs. I asked him what our options are for seating-he said 'none.' I thought he was joking then I realized he was as serious as he was rude.  The entire dining room was open and there was only 30 minutes left of happy hour-I asked if we could get it from a dining room table. He laughed and told me 'absolutely not.' I asked for his name, he told me it was Craig. I will not return to see Craig and I regret giving this place the opportunity to get my business. I will go out of my way to share the unprofessional, rude treatment I received here to ensure it doesn't happy to a colleague or friend. People have lots of choices of where to dine-Dons Lighthouse gave me a reason to stay away."}
{"text":"We just love Don's, especially for lunch. It's almost impossible to list the many reasons why, but I will give it a shot. Should we start with the friendly welcome? Valet parking if you need/want it? The management is extremely observant and professional. The bar is one of the best in Cleveland. (TV is not too loud and music is under control) For one thing, it's right at the end of the Shoreway, and there is free parking, which makes it an ideal spot for downtown workers. If you live in Lakewood, Don's is 5-10 minutes from your house. But these are not the real stars. The staff is exceptionally professional. They anticipate your every whim.  You can tell when you walk in that they are like a family, and they open their arms to you and treat you the same way....or better! But what about the food? It is consistently good. The emphasis is on seafood, and there is always a creative special in that arena. One thing I love about Don's is that they don't use the same veg and starch for each plate. The dishes are creative and unusual without being \"way out\" for the average person. Their salads are always fresh, as are the dressings that they use. Don's is always changing the menu to keep people interested and coming back to see what's new. In the summer of 2007, our favorite was the \"Summer Crab Salad\" (sadly, off the menu now). Beautiful whole Bibb lettuce leaves, fresh, sparkling hunks of lump crabmeat, homegrown-tasting cherry tomatoes and a creamy lemon-chive dressing. It was the perfect storm. The soups are consistently delightful, from split pea to leek and potato to chicken gumbo to tomato basil. There is something different and homemade every single day. They don't make a huge vat of soup and keep it in the walk-in for a month. It's FRESH, and it shows. That's so important, and that is what Don's does. They do it so well it seems like falling off a log, but it is not easy to do."}
{"text":"Food is great. Went here for our rehearsal dinner and our two year anniversary. The food was great especially their filet minion and french onion soup. Our service was very good and she noticed we were here for a special event cause my wife gave me a card and they gave us a free dessert to end the night on. Parking during the week is easy and on the weekends they offer valet parking. The typical attire I see is business casual all the way up to suits. I haven't seen much in the way of jeans and t-shirts in there. I also recommend them for a group event. They had 25 people for our rehearsal dinner and just did great! They had 3-4 servers waiting on us at all times and helped make Don's Lighthouse my favorite place for special occasions. The food is on the more expensive side since it is a higher class restaurant but my filet was cooked right and so was my wife's steak and lobster tail. Try it...you won't regret it."}
{"text":"I always have the best experience at Dons! We sit in the bar and Terry is the best server!! We bring our little girls and the happy hour is the best!!"}
{"text":"I've got to start by saying I don't often write a review, but the experience I had at lunch required the praise.   My parents used to dine at Don's Lighthouse when I was a child. I heard of the place growing up but have never had the privilege of dining there until recently (moved away for 15 years). A friend and I had both been wanting to try it so we decided to go in for lunch.   We started with a bottle of the Paco & Lola Albarino. The wine is delicious, not too floral like some Albarino's but just the right balance of sweetness and minerality. Our first dish was the Calamari and what a delight! It was FANTASTIC! The Calamari was very tender and is served with a delicious lemon curry aioli, a definite win. Secondly we tried the Escargot... Though not our thing, I think it was more our personal taste and not the dish it self. The dish was tasty none the less, lots of garlic and parmesan. For my main dish I ordered the Portuguese Seafood Stew. I think by saying that I can't wait to go back and have it again says enough. It was filled with homemade pasta and a generous portion of seafood.   I can't wrap this up without mentioning our incredible server, Laurie. Laurie went above and beyond to make our lunch a great experience. She knew the menu very well, offered suggestions and answered our questions in detail and with excitement.   Thanks again Laurie for the awesome time! I hope you get to read this and know how much special you made our lunch!"}
{"text":"Happy Hour Update!  Finally made it there.   One word:  Go!  The house Cabernet is smooth and tasty (did I reaeeaaalllyyy down 3 of them?).  The nibbles were quite nice ....a work colleague and I shared the sliders, artichoke dip and stuffed mushrooms.   All were good - with the 'shrooms being tasty but my least favorite.  Classic old school C-town favorite for a reason."}
{"text":"My husband and I tried this place for the first time because we were looking for a nice seafood restaurant.  Overall our experience was very very good.  The service was excellent and the staff were all very friendly.  I opted for the wedge salad as a stared and requested ranch dressing - this item is the only thing I would not recommend.  I expected homemade dressing at such an upscale place but that was not the case.  I ordered the Alaskan King Crab legs and they were excellent.  They cut the crab legs for you which is a nice touch.  The entree is 1.5 lbs which is about 3 legs with claws.  (The entree is market price which was $58).  The crab legs are served with melted butter which includes a candle warmer- caution- the butter did boil & splatter a couple of times.  My entree was served with mashed potatoes and fresh green beans- both very good in their own right.   My husband opted for a 10oz Texas sirloin & you could tell it was of good quality.  The dinners are served with fresh bread which is also good.  They have a nice wine selection too.  The only thing preventing me giving this place 5 stars was the sub par salad and we had a fly buzzing near by us the whole time."}
{"text":"I have experienced better! Over priced! I ordered the buttermilk chicken breast which came with Cajun spinach and polenta. The chicken was cooked just right and the polenta served to balance out the salt in the spinach. Too salty!  The bread and butter was tasty. The after dinner root beer was tasty also. My side salad was a joke and came with very little dressing already mixed in it. For the price of the meal I believe the salad should have come with it but it was an extra $6.00. I have no desire to ever come her again. If I am going to spend big on a good diner i'll take my business elsewhere!"}
{"text":"It must have been off tonight.  Server was inattentive.  Had to ask for appetizers. Food is OK, nothing to write home about.  For the money they charge,  we could have done better.  We haven't been there in years and was invited to go there.  We won't be returning for years."}
{"text":"Went here for a congratulatory graduation dinner with my boyfriend's and my family (10 of us in all). The wine selection was excellent, the sauvignon blanc that we ordered especially. Our server was very diligent about refilling our water and making sure that we had everything we needed.  The appetizers we ordered were the bruschetta and the stuffed mushrooms, and they were very savory and yummy. I had the scallops; they were a bit unevenly cooked but still had the right texture and a good sear. They risotto was a little al dente for my taste but it was still very good. I tried my boyfriend's salmon and it was very, very good, likely due to the sweet sauce they put on top of it, which complemented the salmon very well. My sister and her boyfriend both ordered the steak, which was well-prepared and tasty. The only thing I did not like was the fact that it smelled so fishy when you walked in the door of the restaurant - that's to be expected, obviously, because it's mainly a seafood restaurant - but I always thought that fresh fish did not have a distinct fishy smell, and the degree of the scent threw me off a little at first. Overall, it proved to be a wonderful setting for a great family dinner. It's been in the area for a very long time - my dad said he went to a birthday party here when he was only five! - it's obviously a staple in the area, and after this experience it's obvious why it's remained so popular. A very good restaurant for sea-food lovers."}
{"text":"Good food and very good, professional service.  Nuf' said."}
{"text":"The food was really good, but the service was TERRIBLE.  Our waiter was very rude, bailed on us when a larger party came in and never apologized for keeping us waiting.  When I asked for some boxes to take the rest of our food home, he never came back.  We then had to flag down another waiter to ask if we could see our waiter.  When he finally came over, all he said was that he was with the bigger party and never apologized to us for keeping us waiting.  I told him that we had been sitting here waiting for my check and boxes, all all he did was roll his eyes and said nothing.  From that point on, he was very curt and still never apologized for keeping us waiting.   And where the heck was the manager????   He or she was no where to be found.   In a fancy place like this, I would expect the manager to come around and assure that everything was to our liking.  I get better service at Longhorn Steakhouse, and for a lot less money.   Needless to say, I won't be visiting Don's any time soon."}
{"text":"Went last Sunday for dinner - very pleased.  We walked in around 1800 and were seated immediately.  Service was very good and the waiter was knowledgable about the menu, specials and wine list.  Food was prompt and very good.  I had the Steak and Lobster special, cooked to order, tasty and the lobster was done to perfection.  Everyone else's food was very good as well.  Overall, nice atmosphere - bit dated and if it weren't that I've had some of the best steaks Texas and Japan has to offer, this place would have rated a fifth star.  I would recommend and go again."}
{"text":"Very good seafood with large selection and unique ideas.  Fish is always cooked through as requested.  Burgers are pretty good too.  Patty is a great waitress who makes you feel welcome.  Best Creme Brûlée ever."}
{"text":"Went to Don's recently and had the Portuguese Seafood Stew.   It was just OK.   For $25 I expected much better.  Another person had the steak and lobster.   He said the steak was ok, a bit overcooked, but the lobster tail was way overcooked.  Again for $40 he expected the food to be cooked properly.  But the drink prices are ridiculous.  We were charged $8.30 for one grey goose and tonic.   I think Don's has priced themselves as a  high-end restaurant.   Clearly, they are not."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to this dining experience but was semi let down...  Pros Nice decor, friendly and attentive bar staff and wait staff.  French onion soup and crab cake were excellent.  Crab cake featured a chipotle honey underneath the remoulade sauce and it was delicious.  Crusty bread and herb butter was yummy.  Cons Weird 'old' seafood smell to the place.  I know all seafood places smell like seafood but this was an \"off\" odor.  My mom's chive crusted tilapia was completely tasteless.  She said it tasted watery and it made us think it was a piece of frozen fish.  Come on, Don's.  Are you serious?  Frozen fish?  A seafood restaurant needs to deliver on major seafood dishes and not just appetizers and bread and butter in my book.  So we left with an 'eh' opinion of Don's, sad to say."}
{"text":"Gross! Happy hour mussels did not taste good at all. I think there was something wrong with them. Staff was also very rude. Pier W happy is so much better and their mussels taste great!"}
{"text":"It ha been years since I was last here.  Wanted a special daddy daughter dinner.  We drive from Wadsworth.  First, watch your GPS as it can take you through some very sketchy neighborhoods (I grew up in Cleveland off W25th).  Parking lot well lit.  Host greeted us and server were very nice.  Chicken was outstanding.  Kobe meatloaf was amazing. Salmon was very good.  Filet Mignon was over cooked and on the dry side. Appetizer was Calamari and mushrooms which were very good. Watch price as dinners are alacart.  Decent wine list.  Overall a bit pricey.  Watch what you order.  And Sheri was on point as a server.  I will come back and bring my wife."}
{"text":"Went here for their participation in the Cleveland Independents price fixe menu for $33.  Our server was very good and knew her information. I got the chowder soup, the crab cake entree and the chocolate mousse. The chowder was good. Just good. Not spectacular. The crab cake was a good size but it was very well done. Very brown on the bottom like it got away a bit from the chef. It had a fair amount of crab it wasn't bad, just over cooked. Now the chocolate mousse was a spectacular dessert. Honest it was worth the dinner. One of the best I've ever had.   My partner had the bistro Salad which was larger than thought and she enjoyed it. She also had the steak oscar and enjoyed that as well it looked good! And the chocolate mousse, she was as impressed with it as I was.   Overall we had a good time and it was a decent meal. They appear to have specials throughout the week. I'd definitely try those."}
{"text":"For many years I wanted to try Don's Lighthouse. It looked like such a \"fancy\" restaurant. I finally had the opportunity to go as part of a work function.   Food: My colleagues had lobster tail, and I had baked cod along with the French onion soup. Everything was good, but not great considering the prices.   Atmosphere: The dining room was nice and clean, but kind of outdated. The service was very good too.   Some other things to consider:  -They have free valet parking  -Males can not wear hats in the dining area (waitress asked male to remove his baseball hat) -Restrooms are in the basement which is NOT ADA COMPLIANT"}
{"text":"Was not impressed with this place. After years of wanting to go here maybe I had high expectations. We went here for a work meeting, the service was ok. The bartender would not even look at us. She seemed to have favorites, which is fine but I would have liked to been acknowledged. The food was just ok. With all the new restaurants downtown I feel like they have to step it up. Wouldn't bring anyone back here again."}
{"text":"Was surprised to hear snarky toned comment from person at reservation desk regarding the fact that we should have made a reservation for 7 instead of just coming in. Come on, Sunday evening? There was plenty of room. Did NOT appreciate the comment. Our out-of-town visitor also commented on the attitude. Meal was just ok."}
{"text":"Very disappointed! First time there! Poor service, maître d' was rude, and it took forever to get our meal!  Waitress had to many tables and could not keep up, she was very nice and very polite. The prices where way out of line for the quality.  Sorry to say I would not return."}
{"text":"I don't agree with the Yelper who ate the fishmarket salad and thought it tasted like Miracle Whip. I've had that twice here, minus the blue cheese. The baby shrimp in it are great. I just went with my parents to dinner at Don's before a fabulous production of Thornton Wilder's Our Town by Blank Canvas Theatre. (That's a fantastic play that you should go see if you haven't and if you're reading this at the appropriate time before August 29th, 2015, go see Blank Canvas Theatre's production.) For my main course, I had the lobster tail and steak with my steak cooked medium. It came with mashed potatoes and green beans, which were both really good. None of us had alcoholic beverages or coffee or tea, but I had dessert. I had the bread pudding, which had vanilla ice cream. It was excellent. All in all, a very satisfying meal. The service was good, except the server forgot to discount the lobster tail and steak, which is $10 off on Sundays; he promptly gave my dad a new check when my dad brought it to his attention. Go see or read Our Town now, fellow Yelpers and Yelp readers! I read it years ago, but hadn't seen it before. Also check out Gray's Auctioneers which is nearby."}
{"text":"Stopped in for happy hour.  The food was great, and the place itself is cozy and classic.  But the service was the worst we've had. The first bartender was nice enough, but was very inattentive and told us at one point she had mentally checked out bc her shift was almost over.  The other bartender stood in the corner talking to the hostess most of the time, and when she did do a round of the bar she never once asked if we needed anything.  Then she would return to the hostess and talk again. We had intended to stay for a couple hours but ended up getting the check after one drink bc we couldn't wrangle up a second."}
{"text":"Don't get the Salmon. Overpriced. I was charged over $90 for a piece of fish the size of my pinky!   SAD!"}
{"text":"Do you like seafood? If the answer is yes, you need to try this place out! The menu options for Don's are amazing and none of it disappointed us. We got the seafood sampler for an appetizer and the scallops and the salmon for dinner. The seafood was really very good, as was the service. I tend to have a tough time deciding on dinner and will ask my server for their opinion and our waitress had great thoughts and tips to help me decide. (I went with the scallops and they were just as flaky and buttery as she promised.) The service continued to be good throughout the entire meal, impeccable really, and the food continued to pack on flavor after flavor of deliciousness. If you could pick up Don's lighthouse and place it in a newer, hipper location or restaurant, I would promise I'll be back. But right now, it's really just the food and service that are worth returning for, and I agree with other reviewers that have said you can spend just as much on similarly good food, but with better ambiance. Don's needs a facelift, the decor updated. You're sure to get really great food here, but you may find yourself feeling a bit like your parents before you leave..."}
{"text":"Everything here was excellent.  I got the lobster and steak, and my girlfriend got the special that night which was swordfish.  Everything was done perfectly to order and served promptly.  Our server was top notch (she even ran out to the car when we forgot our leftovers)."}
{"text":"I had a party of 4 . We tried to call for three hours to make a reservation and no answer on the phone  . We drove over 15 miles to come here as it was a great reservation .  The Manager said it's a 4 hour wait and refused to work with us . We ask to split the party and he said no can do !!!! Can't help you   Very very bad service ."}
{"text":"My boyfriend, his family and I went to Don's Lighthouse for a night on the town. When we walked in, we were amazed with the decor of the place. The clientele is definitely older, but I didn't feel that out of place coming in with the parentals.  The best thing we ordered that night was the mussels. They were cooked in such a delightful sauce! I had to use the bread to sop up all that juice! I hear there is special pricing on Sundays, so I'll definitely be back for more.  One thing that detracted from this restaurant though was the service! For such an expensive place, our waiter was not too nice! When we asked questions about the food, his responses were curt and he made us feel like we shouldn't be asking him anything! I felt nervous eating with him serving me because I felt judged the whole time. That's really not the way to feel when eating out! Better service next time, Don, and I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Visited this neighborhood icon this evening and to say the least was not disappointed.  EVERYTHING, from the cocktails, wine, soup, and entrees were excellent.  Perhaps the only thing that exceeded the food and drink was the exceptional service provided by our server Terri.  Very knowledge, attentive but not overbearing.   Price wise it was below any other venue offering this caliper of food and service."}
{"text":"Group lunch with 25 ladies...presentation was lovely of all the dishes. I enjoyed a delicious French onion soup. For an entrée I enjoyed a salmon BLT which was very tasty. This lovely restaurant is an institution and very well maintained in appearance and service was excellent."}
{"text":"I've wanted to visit this restaurant for years and we finally made it there to try out their offerings for Cleveland Independent Restaurant Week.  The place is nicely decorated and the service was very good.  I started with the stuffed mushrooms and my husband had the seafood chowder.  Both were good although my mushrooms were a little cold.  We both had the steak Oscar for our entrees.  The steak came with creamy mashed potatoes and asparagus.  We both enjoyed the entrees but my steak was under cooked.  I didn't send it back but it was fairly red for a medium well done steak.  We both had the chocolate mousse for dessert and it was delicious!  Very chocolatey!    I'm not sure if we will head back to Don's Lighthouse anytime soon.  Our meal was good and, since it was Restaurant Week, the price was great.  But, based on the prices of the other offerings on the menu, there are a lot of other places I'd like to try in the same price point."}
{"text":"Had a nice Sunday night out at Don's Lighthouse. We arrived at approximately 6pm after a matinee show at the Playhouse Square to find the parking lot very full. The hostess was able to seat us in one of the booth right away, good crowd in both the dinning room and at the bar. I've always enjoyed going to Don's - unique building with great interior decor. The murals on the main dinning room wall does help set the mood.  Our waiter was spot on with first rate service - checked in offen enough to meet our needs without hovering. Cocktails and a shared app, stuffed mushrooms, were served quickly, a glass of wine and Dewar's on the Rock is not a hard drink order for any bartender to complete. We both ordered the Fishmarket salad an interesting combo that included baby shrimp and blue cheese that somehow works better that you would expect. My wife's stuffed trout was meet with positive reviews, the skin was nice a crispy while the trout and lobster stuffing was properly cooked. I went with to scallops as per usual, golden brown on the outside while still being fork tender."}
{"text":"I had a fantastic, juicy, perfectly grilled burger and fries at Don's Lighthouse on 10-8-16 at around 6:30pm.  I was with a friend who had a burger and a bowl of Don's French onion soup.  I've been eating at Don's Lighthouse since the late 70s--always great service and excellent food.  I am pleasantly surprised that the burger & fries are priced so reasonably: $10.90.  The onion soup is about the best in the area.  I love Don's Lighthouse as I have never, ever had anything but delicious and properly prepared foods here.  Their steaks are wonderful, but I'm more of a great burger freak. The only other places that can make almost as good a burger are Don's Pomeroy House and the Cabin Club.  If you love good, juicy, steaky burgers, order one at Don's Lighthouse.  You will be happy."}
{"text":"My guy had his company Christmas dinner and the steak was cooked well-done perfect no pink. The lobster was delicious as well as the bread. The Servers are stuffy and kind of rude if you go on Wed. for steak special.  My guy and I used to go here on Wed. for $12.95 Steak dinner special 1/month but the steak chef was inconsistent and our steaks were not cooked to our preferences."}
{"text":"I've only been to Don's twice in the past two years, each time during Cleveland Independents Restaurant Week. You pick 3 courses for $33 - starter, main and dessert. Of all the restaurants on the list, Don's has the best bang for the buck.  As my mom used to waitress here before I was born, I know this place has been around for awhile. So don't expect modern or trendy. Expect more like historic and dim, yet cozy.  Every year, one of my girl friends and I go for her birthday dinner. We get a bottle of wine, take our time, and catch up. Our waiter last year was fabulous. This year, our waitress was a little odd at times, but ended up being very nice and accommodating.   This last time, I chose a salad, the steak oscar (strip steak topped with crab and bearnaise sauce) and the chocolate mousse. The salad was fine, the steak was amazing (albeit a little bit under cooked, but I prefer that), the side of mashed potatoes and asparagus were tasty, and the mousse was a perfect cap to the meal. My friend and I both enjoyed ourselves and were surprised that 2 hours had passed by the time we left.  Overall - a great place for a special occasion to just relax, take your time and enjoy a good meal.  One last tip: you can make reservations through Open Table, but Don's does not award any points like other restaurants."}
{"text":"We stopped in here on a Sunday evening and ate in the bar area. We decided to order tapas style and had: Walleye small bites for a starter, soup, escargot, beef & crab sliders and a Caesar salad. Everything was very good, but perhaps we enjoyed the Walleye small bites the most because they appear to be a local specialty and were quite tasty. All was washed down with an Argentine Malbec and a Reisling.  A delightful place. The service was excellent as was the ambiance."}
{"text":"I went here with a friend after running 6 miles so I was hungry. It was a Tuesday so it was steak night. $13 for a really nice steak with some veggies hits the spot. I have a problem with restaurants who can't make what I order like when I say \" I like to have it cooked medium rare\" It comes out medium done. I can't say it for this place. They make it to what you order so when I say medium rare, it came out medium rare. So kudos to Don's.   The place looked like the bar in that old show called Cheers. Very low key and quiet. Full bar and good food. On Sundays, they have $2 dozen mussels so definitely have to come back to try that. When a place makes their steaks well, their other food must also be good too, right?"}
{"text":"Went here this past weekend as a group date. The service was good. All entries start around $20. Everyone liked their food. Except for the coffee drinks. So so gross. And we paid $10 for those coffee drinks.. They were some sort of speciality kind. They had a baked cheese dessert thing, ( don't know exact name) which my sister had gotten and the whole table shared it. It had fruit on it as well.. It was so good!!!! Will be back in the future."}
{"text":"I haven't had a meal here in well over a decade. Don's is a Cleveland landmark and has been around forever. My husband   said his walleye was the best prepared he has ever had....high praise as he is flirting with age 65. My lobster tail was excellent and my sons filet perfect!!  I think we won't wait another decade to return."}
{"text":"I came to Don's Lighthouse for my 25th birthday dinner and got the twin lobster tails which was  the perfect birthday dinner!!! And reasonably price for the quality, I might add. A few weeks later, I brought my friend here before seeing Wicked and got the filet. I ordered it medium and it seems a little charred on the top, but still good nonetheless.   This is one of my favorite Winter dining spots. It has such a cozy and quaint feel and I love the look of the inside, as well as the outside. They offer valet parking, but I have always been able to find a spot to park without needing to use the service.   I heard they have great happy hour special in the bar area, and on Tuesdays they have a lobster tail dinner for $15!!! I just recently found  this out and can't wait to take advantage of it. I have always had great service, too!"}
{"text":"We stopped here after a day at the rock and roll museum on Saturday. We took the Lake Rd home which is about 45 minutes west and as we were stopped in traffic, I spied Don's Lighthouse. I hadn't eaten there since the 70's and we decided to stop in. They had just opened for dinner and since it was early they had room for us. Well we weren't disappointed. Our server was top notch and helpful in every way. We started off with a cocktail and escargot. Both were perfection. Our steaks and the accompanying veggies and potatoes were delicious. Old school restaurants like this are in short supply and I'm happy to get reacquainted with this one. I'll definitely make it a point to return soon."}
{"text":"i come here roughly every 6 weeks or so...sometimes for the surf n turf special and other times just to go, as i live in the area.  i enjoy the wine, the soup du jour & typical dishes like salmon & cod.  the two recurring issues i have w this place are: 1) the greeter/manager can be rude and somewhat condescending.  you're the first person people see when they come in.  your attitude sets the tone for the rest of the dining experience.  2) most times ill order an entree w steak.  recently, every single steak i order medium or medium well comes out very chewy and almost gummy.  i understand that places cook steaks differently.  however to get the same kind of steak each time out is pretty concerning and it makes me wonder if the cooks back there can cook steak to the level the fish comes out...no complaints w the seafood on that end."}
{"text":"Went tonight for dinner with three friends.  The weather was horrendous and when I entered the restaurant, I said to the manager \"This had best be a good meal.\"  I was delighted with my meal as were my friends with their meals.  Fantastic experience!"}
{"text":"Just pulling up, I knew I was going to like this place. It's cute and quaint from the outside, warm and inviting inside. My dining companion and I each got a soup and salad. My tomato bisque soup was wonderful, seasoned just right and served piping hot. The salad was fresh and the dressing not overdone.  Our wait person was not overly attentive, but did answer all the questions we had and arrived exactly when we needed them.  I wouldn't say there is anything overly special about Don's Lighthouse in terms of the menu, but it seems like a Cleveland Institution and for that I'm glad I stopped in."}
{"text":"Stopped in for Happy Hour last night and was impressed with the menu!  Happy hour is a great deal on great food. Half price appetizers, $5 martinis and $1 off select beer and wine. I tried 5 different appetizers and enjoyed every one.  Stuffed mushrooms, Don's sampler, escargot, mini burgers and mussels. The bowl of mussels was huge, way more than I was expecting for $5! I highly recommend happy hour at Don's Lighthouse. I want to come back and try the regular menu now. Service was prompt, our waitress could have been a little more friendly but I can't complain.  Parking is easy. They have a big lot."}
{"text":"I could not find nothing wrong with this place. It was my first time here and the experience was great. The food was delicious. The wine we ordered couldn't be better. I was very happy with everything we got. After dinner before dessert the lady even combed the crumbs off the table which I only see that at upscale places. The wait staff was on top of things. Its a little pricy but you get what you pay for as I believe. I think this places needs another dollar sign next to its name to make it 3 total lol But its all good."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a fabulous Sunday dinner with my family, a party of 7. Our waitstaff was attentive and friendly, and really made sure we were enjoying our food and their service. The food was delicious and I would recommend this place for a good time."}
{"text":"I went here for Tuesday happy hour. Happy hour lobster tail is $8 off on Tuesdays which is $19, NOT $15. That's why we went but whatever. It's small but good and comes with mashed pots and green beans. It's still worth the price. Martinis are $5 on the HH menu list. $4.38 for stuffed mushrooms and there are only 4 of them, and mussels are also $5 for a bowl. Pretty good deal. Food tastes good and service is great! I'll be back again to try some other options."}
{"text":"Everything was ok. The manager who sat us at our table was frenzied and didn't say anything other than \"follow me\" which seemed very informal for such a high end setting. It took a server over 7 minutes to greet us. She then let us know that she was covering for another server who was weeded and was sorry for the wait - I really appreciated that. She was very polite and a lovely server for the rest of the evening. I had the Chowder which was just average. No noticeable pieces of clam in it. Then had the South American tilapia which was entirely over cooked on the bottom and tough to cut/chew. The rice and julienned veggies it was served with were both okay, the mini crab cake was absolutely delicious but was overwhelmed by a sour avocado sauce on the plate. I was not impressed with any aspect of the meal besides dessert. We had a fantastic caramel bread pudding that was to die for. Abigail, our server, luckily was very sweet and saved the experience from being completely awful. Maybe we'll come back in a few months and try again -- I had higher hopes."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! Their 1/2 price appetizer for happy hour is phenomenal. I had an order of crab cakes, mussels, stuffed mushrooms, and a bowl of seafood chowder. Some places will give out half portions or smaller versions during their happy hour, but not Don's.   The mussels were on the smaller side, but there were probably two dozen of them! It was wonderfully flavored in garlic wine sauce and only cost me five bucks at half price. Seriously, what a steal. I'm not sure that my photo does it justice. The crab cakes ($6.95, half price) were  also very good. They were on a sweeter side (drizzled honey I think?) but very well balanced with the creamy sauce. The mini salad also went well with it. The stuffed mushrooms had sun dried tomatoes and artichoke in them, covered in cheese, and sat in a sherry cream sauce ($4.50, half off). Again, amazing. It got to the point where I made my way to the ginormous bowl of seafood chowder ($7, not part of happy hour) and was too full to eat anymore. No worries, I had it wrapped up to-go.   I can't believe that I walked away with all that food for under $30. Everything was very flavorful and I highly, highly recommend the mussels appetizer. The mussels are completely worth it at the full price of $10 too. Sherrie was my waiter and she was fantastic. Super friendly and great atmosphere. I'll definitely be back the next time I'm in Cleveland."}
{"text":"I'm writing this from a conversation I had last night with a very good friend.  He took his girlfriend there for dinner after he had proposed to her earlier in the day. I have not been there since the place was called Don's Lighthouse Inn. The food and service was always excellent. His fiancee always wanted to try the place so he made reservations at my recommendation of what I thought was the same venue.   They both tell me they were disappointed. The food was....eh, mediocre at best. His lake perch was...well....just terrible. I'm not sure what she ordered but they both said one try was enough. ."}
{"text":"I left disappointed with the Maine Lobster Tails at Don's.  The broiled lobster tails were cooked fairly well, preserving the delicate nature of the meat, and far from the awful, rubbery lobster tails I've had at Ken Stewart's East Bank.  On the other hand, the lobster tails at Red, The Steakhouse and, for what it's worth, Red Lobster were prepared better.  What was really unfortunate at Don's, however, was that the tails were inadequately cleaned, with one of the tails even having some very significant portions of the lobster's digestive tract remaining after plating.  While it was a Lenten Friday, the restaurant did not appear too busy and, even then, there isn't any excuse for not performing this basic skill even among the midst of a weekend dinner rush.  The French Onion Soup was decent, providing a rich (albeit over salted) broth topped with a combination of three cheeses.  As for non-food aspects of the restaurant, the dining room offers a tranquil, dressy-casual environment.  Alternatively, the happy hour at the bar seemed to offer a vibrant scene; not too unlike Pier W.  Service was friendly and attentive--maybe even above par for restaurants at this level.  Complimentary valet parking is a plus, though there was plenty of parking around the corner from the restaurant."}
{"text":"Came here Saturday with high expectations but were not impressed. I ordered clam chowder and 6 oz filet mignon and my husband got the catch of the day red snapper. The clam chowder  was really good. But the filet mignon was pretty dry for being medium and lacked flavor. The sauce that came with it wasn't too good but it was my own fault for not asking for a replacement. My husband's snapper sauce it came with was good but fish had no flavor.   Overall we spend around 85 dollars and were very disappointed. Maybe our pallette is not sophisticated enough but essentially everything lacked flavor. I expect steak to at least have some salt pepper and some butter but I didn't even taste that much. We regret not just going to Longhorn for steaks which cost less and has way better food."}
{"text":"I had a lovely Sunday Evening Dinner Special -- Superb steak and lobster, beautifully presented and perfectly grilled.  Attentive bartender and waiter-- atmosphere is just right for groups or dining solo.   Cushy, earth-toned dining room, and a menu that's got a little something for everyone.  Bonus: Safe, well-lighted parking.   Urban Lady"}
{"text":"Don's deserves a 5 star rating due to it's quality and consistency.   I have never had a bad meal here, and typically it is outstanding.  Efficient, knowledegable staff, fresh deliciously prepared food.    My wife and I had the Portugese  Seafood Stew, which was fresh, tasty and perfectly seasoned.  Our son had the surf & turf for his birthday, and would have ordered more, but he was stuffed.  We are typically able to get a table at the time we desire. Likely because the restaruant is not in the 'burbs, or in one of the trendy restaurant districts, it is not  wall to wall people. Take advantage of it's easy access and enjoy a great meal in a relaxing atmosphere."}
{"text":"Oh Don, we need to talk about this Lighthouse restaurant of yours...  Decor was fine, sat in a booth by the bar, so more of a chill-smoke a cigar-have a bourbon-bulky-dim atmosphere. The waitress was nice, although she could have come around more often towards the end of the meal. The food though, eh. A big EHHHHH.   Pros: Fat Heads Bumbleberry Beer. Jumbo Lump Crab Cake - Very tasty, sad I had to share. Not fishy nor full of breading.  Cons: Bread for the table - Not warm, hard crust, not my mouth's idea of a good time. Fishmarket Salad - Disgusting. Tasted like I was eating Miracle Whip.  Crab Mac & Cheese - Disappointing. Bland and flavorless."}
{"text":"I have not been to Don's Lighthouse in many years...Still just a beautiful as ever.....But this experience was not charming at all....We sat in the bar dining area.....Ordered 2 Steak & Lobster tail dinner's @ $46 each...and a few drinks......She brought out the butter warmers for our lobster tails....I ask the server if the butter was real..she informed me that is was real butter....This was the same kind of butter oil they use to make popcorn....it had no settling on top of any cream ..nothing ....Just one consistency..STRAIGHT FLAVORED OIL....I'm not sure what's going on here.....but for 2 Steak & Lobster tail dinners @ $46 each I would definitely expect real butter with my lobster tail....Has anyone else encountered this ??????"}
{"text":"Went here for a friend's birthday dinner and the ambiance is very nice great mood for a nice date. The food was average. The black grouper and potatoes were salty and the portion size was small especially for the price. The service is amazing though! Our waitress was very nice and attentive making this an enjoyable visit."}
{"text":"My family has had many dinners at Don's Lighthouse, including my wedding party in 2015!   Had another lovely dinner with my parents, hubby, brother, sister-in-law, 2 nephews and our niece yesterday evening, a holiday tradition that sees us at Don's many Decembers...  We go all out! Five courses. First course shared apps: dozen oysters on the half shell, dozen clams, calamari, bruschetta. The oysters were plump and tasty, the clams were consumed in minutes, the calamari is a favorite every time, bruschetta tasty.  Second course, soup! French onion soup for 4 of us, seafood chowder for 2 and chicken noodle for my nephew that considers himself a connoisseur! I had the French onion, which was SUPER cheesy in the best way, and was so flavorful. I heard good things about the chowder and chicken noodle as well!  Third course, salads! A couple wedges (hubby loves it), a couple Caesar's, and the BEST, the \"Winter Salad\" featuring shaved Brussels sprouts, roasted cauliflower and goat cheese - DELISH!  Entrees - the steak and lobster was on special, so a few people had that with good reviews (my nephew had never had lobster before, and decided it should always be ordered), dad had the mahi mahi special and cleaned his plate! My brother, mom and husband ordered steaks with accouterments - either \"Oscar\" style with crab and hollandaise or with bleu cheese. The only misstep in the evening was my Delmonico steak ordered medium, and came out almost raw. I had to send it back, it still wasn't quite right; but made for good leftovers that I could reheat to the right \"doneness\".  Desserts included a very light and fluffy peppermint cheesecake that was quite refreshing, lots of dark chocolate mousse that Don's does a smash-up job on, creme brûlée, key lime sorbet and a VERY delicious looking peanut butter and chocolate bread pudding!  Our server was attentive, and funny with the kids. Overall, Don's Lighthouse has always treated my family quite well!"}
{"text":"Best restaurant we visited in a one-week vacation to Cleveland/Akron/Oberlin/Canton Ohio.  Enjoyed the food so much, we ate there twice. Both Brian and Tara provide excellent friendly service.  Enjoyed the very  fruity Pomero  salad; the poppyseed dressing (which I requested on the side) was OK but not great. For dinner, enjoyed the VERY tasty Faroe Island honey-glazed salmon (the yummy glaze tasted to me like maple syrup) with roasted butternut squash, broccolini, pear chutney and candied pecans.  The salmon was cooked to perfection--crisp on the outside; moist on the inside.  Possibly the best fish entree I've ever had.    For lunch, enjoyed the pan roasted honey-glazed rainbow trout with roasted butternut squash, candied pecans, green beans and pear chutney.  The trout on the lunch menu was a small portion priced accordingly; the salmon for dinner was a larger portion priced accordingly.   Dessert was tangerine sorbet; a tad acidic but sweet and very tasty and a flavor of sorbet that I've never seen on a menu.  The restaurant is in a very beautiful historic building.  Easy parking in their own parking lot, attended by a valet at busy times."}
{"text":"First meal in Cleveland: no to the salmon. No to the Mediterranean chicken \"stew\". Just, no overall."}
{"text":"Just an overall three star experience. I had the Miner Viognier wine and it was really good (very crisp and fruity--as described). I also had a great crab cake the honey that is served with it really made all the difference, but the clam chowder is bland and very potato heavy, and the bread is so thick and unruly. It's very crusty and hard to manage, crumbs get everywhere and it's just not a great dining experience. Also the service was slow, I felt ignored for a long time before we got to place a drink order and then again before we could place a food order.   Might revisit for takeout. A lot of people around me were ordering lobster tails that looked good and the seafood stew was a hit with another member of my party. The decor is more of a miss for me, but I don't know that 20 somethings are really the target audience around here."}
{"text":"Stopped by recently for Happy Hour while killing time before a concert outing.  Drink deals were great considering the atmosphere inside the building.  The vaulted ceilings inside the main dining hall add an extra bit of elegance to a night out.  Unfortunately, food quality is what is knocking this review down to a two.  I ordered the bruschetta to go along with my drink.  The bread was quite soggy from the very wet tomatoes that appeared to have been sitting in its own juices on the counter for quite a long time between when the dish was finished and when it was brought out.  Yellowish-browning lettuce brought the review down even further.  Might stop in for a drink again in the future if the time and location is convenient to my plans, but will not be trying the menu again."}
{"text":"Great place, people and food!  I tend to dine here a lot with friends and family, and it's never a disappointment. Some of my favorite dishes are definitely the mussels, scallops, and apple pie.   Love the wine selection also!"}
{"text":"I found Don's Lighthouse to be pretty OK. Parts of my meal were good and other parts of my experience were not.  I opted for the three course meal special. I had the Brie and crackers, served with nuts and dried fruit, as an appetizer. That was good/hard to mess up.  My entree was good too. I had the salmon, which perfectly crisped on the outside and tender on the inside. It was served with a healthy portion of sweet mashed potatoes.  Dessert was a delectable cup of chocolate mousse.  Now the not so good, our party included a vegan. They were out of seitan, vegan sour cream and made her vegan veggie stroganoff super watery. Ultimately, she just asked for a plate of veggies. The nice thing, though, is they owned up to their vegan shortcomings and comp'd her meal."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service every time we come here! French onion soup is incredible... As well as the entrees... and cheesecake... perfect!"}
{"text":"Went to eat here on a tuesday which is $15 dollar lobster tail night in the lounge area. The lobster was served with mashed potatoes and green beans.  This is normally a $25 dollar meal so it was good value.    For an appetizer I had the calamari for $10 and was sorely disappointed. It was on the level of any pubs calimari and not up to an upscale seafood  restaurant.   My dinner mates had a wedge salad that he thoroughly enjoyed and the other had escargot that he made no comments on.   II would go back as the staff were attentive and professional and polite."}
{"text":"So my theory of \"if there is not a wait, there's probably a reason \" proves to be true once again. My other theory of \"never had a bad meal at a 4 star restaurant \" proved to be wrong. While finding ourselves in the peak of dinner hour 7p in Rocky River area. After yelping and missing a restaurant on lake ave. We decided to go to Dons lighthouse.  Friday night, 7 ish and not busy.  New England clam chowder was clamless and brownish, while the grouper looked and tasted over cooked and lobster mashed was old and warmed over and asparagus soggy.  Waitress did not bring our drink order before or during our meal and then charged us for the drinks at the end.  I must say we did order the fried cod and shrimp and it was hot and tasty.   2  for this upscale bombshell."}
{"text":"$2 for a dozen mussels?! YES PLEASE! I'm not the biggest fan of mussels, but these are so so fresh, and in wonderful sauce/broth. Dipping this sauce with bread afterwards, is a must!!   The restaurant is cute, and very close to the lake. It's clean and classy, and the staff are very welcoming. The handful of times I've been there they had great specials, so make sure you take advantage of this. One time they had a surf and turf special for $15! You can bet I took advantage of that deal, and boy was it worth every cent! The lobster was fresh and amazing with butter, and the beef was pretty good too.   I will definitely be back for $2 mussels on Sunday. If you haven't caught on to this great deal, you don't know what you're missing out!!"}
{"text":"Don's Lighthouse definitely has one of the best happy hours in Cleveland!   They have wonderfully well-balanced drinks, fantastic bartenders, and food specials that are delicious treats at a wonderful value!   They have half off appetizers, you can make a meal out of them by ordering 2-3. I love the bruschetta, mini burgers with onion straws, and the stuffed mushrooms! Also their french onion soup is top-notch and not overly loaded with salt for once like most onion soups tend to be.   My mother absolutely loves the lobster tail special here on Tuesday nights!  $15 lobster tails and she says they are great quality with a lot of flavor! It gets served with green beans and mashed potatoes. Their green beans are also cooked perfectly and have a delicious crunch.   Other great highlights would be the filet mignon and their house salad which has a fantastic white balsamic dressing that is wonderful!  Oh and before I forget, they have the BEST chocolate mousse!  Try it out on your way home from work one day! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Don's Lighthouse has a great atmosphere first of all... Me and my date had to sit at the bar because of lack of the reservation which I didn't think was necessary because it was 2 o'clock in the afternoon. But none the less even though we sit at the bar I would give her waitress 4 out of 5 stars. I ordered surf and turf which was in my opinion very good. The only problem I had with I was the vegetables that came with the surf and turf we're not cooked that well. All in all my experience at the lighthouse was definitely 4 to 4 and a half star experience. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Lobster special was very good at $15. . Bread is out if this world. Ate in bar. Good atmosphere. Going back next month."}
{"text":"Tried it out based on positive yelp reviews, somewhat disappointing. The ambiance is dated, but perhaps could pass for a neighborhood spot if it had good food. I got sirloin steak, which was one of the most flavorless steaks I've ever had. The sides were fine. The chocolate cake for dessert was again below my expectations. Prices are rather steep for what you get. I understand paying this at a top notch steakhouse, yet it's simply too much for here. Not likely to return."}
{"text":"Great dinner and wonderful ambience. Pricey though, so bring your card."}
{"text":"The service here is amazingggggggggggggg. I'm still new to the city and got super lost on the way to the restaurant. I called to let them know that we were running late since our reservation was near closing. Usually they just say okay see you soon and hang up. However, to my surprise the guy who answered gave me directions and stayed on the phone with me until i had no chance of getting lost again. When I arrived he came up to me to make sure I was the one who called. THEN on the way out, the same gentleman actually caught up with us at the door to make sure we knew how to get home [which we didn't]. You can't beat that kind of service  Now for the food. They serve warm bread that is pretty good, not the best I've had. I went on a Sunday. $2 for a dozen mussels on Sunday and they were big and delicious!!!!! I couldn't believe the price! I also got a dirty martini and they made it so strong I felt it after TWO SIPS literally. For the entrees I got sea bass which was about $28 and the slice was about the size of an ipod nano, maybe an 3/4 inch thick. I was very disappointed of the portion for the fish, but it was really good despite that. My friend ordered surf 'n turf which was $10 off [$27] that day. He reported deliciousness all through the night.   I would give them 5 stars if my fish was a bigger portion, but by far the best service I've ever had."}
{"text":"We dined here last night for my brother's birthday. I would have to say this is some of the best seafood in Cleveland.   The calamari was outstanding; cooked to perfection, nice portion size, great for a starter.   The seafood chowder was INCREDIBLE; hearty, fresh, and honestly left me wanting more.   The Portuguese Stew was a really nice balance of scallops; mussels, and shrimp. I was really impressed by the quality of the scallops.   Overall a nice place, our server was knowledgeable and professional."}
{"text":"The crab cake appetizer was delicious. I got the scallops which were good but the sauce that came with it was gross. I found myself eating around it. The waitress was very slow. Our appetizer came out right away, but our main course took forever, she gave us the the wrong drinks and it was pretty hard to flag her down. The place was crowded so reservations are recommended."}
{"text":"We had Easter Brunch  at Don's Lighthouse.  The water poured in our glasses smelled like Lake Erie on a bad day and had a metallic taste.  Not good. Our waitress replaced our water with bottled. I have serious concerns on how the water smelled. (My opinion). The Brunch was extremely limited. It was dark in the room. Nothing was labeled or decorated.  I could gave eaten eggs and bacon anywhere. The prime Rib was outstanding but nothing to go with it. A scalloped potato, twice baked potato...something to make it a brunch lunch. Nothing resembling lunch. Very limited!  The dessert was just embarrassing. All in all I would skip this brunch."}
{"text":"Dearest Don,  How do I break this to you gently.... I don't like you. I think if I was 34 years old in 1997 you would be the hot spot. But alas, I am 28 and it's 2018. Let me list the ways this won't ever work out.   1. You hoodwinked me with your happy hour offerings. The martinis ordered were so bad, none were finished and one was even sent back.  2. The food was... uninspired. Not even your basic dishes were that great. Nothing was poorly made mind you. Just so... lackluster. Warning: any future patrons, do not order the stuffed mushrooms. I also don't advise the bruschetta, crab cake, cocktail shrimp, or escargot. Or mini burgers.  3. Your spinach/artichoke dish was only cheese and spinach. WHYYYYYY. I want the good stuff.  4. Even the butter was tasteless. I am not even sure how that happens?? It even looked seasoned.  5. Your bathroom is in the basement. Have you ever even heard of the ADA??  This has been a very hard decision. I will miss the quality server who took my order and really was very considerate. But I have to accept that casualty. OK! See you never.   Sincerely, Lin"}
{"text":"the food was not what kept this from being a 4 or a 5 .. the service we got personally at our table was not the reason .. the reason is the seating we were given .. they should not have the table we were offered in the location it is in if they continue to want to squeeze all the people they can in that place .. the seat (table w/4 chairs) was right outside the kitchen door which was not the actual problem .. the chairs stick out in the way of traffic & not only does every patron knock them around but the servers do as well .. w/out any apologies made .. hard to enjoy a dinner at the prices charged when you do not know when the next bump behind will be coming from .. nearly spilled wine on my dress & my husband nearly chipped a tooth when putting a forkful into his mouth .. next time .. should there be one .. we will ask specifically for a booth .. our server even commented that no one ever wants the table we were seated at (all others were full so we could not be moved) .. that alone speaks volumes"}
{"text":"If you are in the mood for quality seafood this place has got it. The food was incredible! We shared the calamari and I ordered the twin lobster tails for my birthday entree, which affordable and delicious!! The atmosphere is classic and clean and I loved the updated decor!   The gave me a complimentary birthday dessert. What a great meal for my birthday. I heard they have an awesome happy hour too! Can't wait to try it."}
{"text":"I'll preface this by saying that nothing I have ever had here was \"bad.\" I've never walked away disappointed or upset. That being said, there's a lot of room to improve, but I haven't seen them expend the energy to improve it.  The dining room and lounge area are a bit dated. They're not particularly well-lit, but comfortable. The blinds always seem to be drawn, though, so there's not a lot of natural light.  The menu is fairly standard fair. Certain things could be better; I feel like the fish fry was a miserly portion, but still rather good. Their happy hour fare knocks it out of the park with half-priced appetizers.   The kitchen staff really shines on specials. I had a soft-shell crab BLT here once, and it was criminal how little publicity it received. When I go, I usually get the special because I know it's something truly special and creative, not just a menu dish with a slight twist. That being said, most of the menu items are good. The seafood delivery truck is there daily, so you know it's all fresh.  The staff is knowledgeable, friendly, and professional. They are prompt with food and drink, and know about the menu.   The big problem, though, is that the place seems a bit dated and avoidant of change. It is a chicken-or-egg question with the largely older clientele. It's such a shame that so many people pass on this place because it seems so stodgy when there's such creativity and vitality in the kitchen."}
{"text":"This place has been here at this location for ever. I was going here in the 70's when I lived here in Cleveland.Thought I would check them out on my recent visit. They still have good food A-OK. great selection of seafood items will not disappoint you. But do not expect to be blown away either. Service is good. If you are a walleye fan they always seem to have it."}
{"text":"Best wedge salad!!! Non-salty French Onion Soup!!! Great Cocktsils!!! Lobster Mac & Cheese was phenomenal!!! The bathrooms need updating. That's my only complaint."}
{"text":"Dinner was fantastic.  Appetizers, bread with honey thyme butter was out of this world, dinner of filet and lobster and filet was great.  Depending what kind of crowd you are attracting, you might want to have the servers wear shoes other than tennis shoes, they should have a better personality and the window ledges next to booths should be dusted and cleaned more often.  The \"old\" atmosphere did not interfere with the dinner served, however when you pay the kind of money to dine at a well known facility and it is your first time there, you notice these things. Not sure if I would make the venture out considering we traveled from the East side suburbs."}
{"text":"Go online and check out their weekly specials such as $15 lobster tail nights on Tuesday and dozen mussels for $2 on Sundays.  I love the food here, really a great place right outside downtown Cleveland.  The broth from the mussels was delicious, I could fill up on the soaked bread alone.  Sundays order of mussels are only a dozen but if you order it off the menu for $9.50 you get a shi* ton of them.  Nice big bar with seating EVERYWHERE!  Service is top notch, beer is cold, wine options vary in a good way, and the drink I had was good and stiff.  This place falls right in line with the kind of bars / restaurants I love going to and am just as excited to hear about others visit to Don's.  Bring the family there or pony up to the bar, good times will be had by all!!"}
{"text":"One of the best happy hours around!  The bar area is charming in its decor.  Servers are very friendly and helpful.  It is an older crowd but make no mistake, on the night we were there, it was a lively crowd which made it fun.  The happy hour drink menu is great - a lot of options including $5 martini's.  The happy hour food menu is not to be missed!  It has everything from shrimp cocktail to crab cakes (small, but very good!) to artichoke dip.  If you order food at all, they give you a bread basket.  If you leave hungry, it's your own fault!  All in all, a great place to hang out during happy hour."}
{"text":"Either this or Blue Point has the best happy hour in Cleveland. Other places (Hodges or Pier W) have better atmospherics and good food - but the happy hour food at Blue Point/Don's is simply excellent and a great value. Check them out!"}
{"text":"This is a very cool, underrated spot in Cleveland. Great place for a date. Everything I had was delicious. I recommend the crab cake appetizer."}
{"text":"To those who enjoy an elegant meal with all the atmosphere and service, THIS IS THE  PLACE!!  The food is to die for - I had one of the finest salmon dinners I have EVER had. My daughter and her husband had steak dinners.  The steak could have been cut with a paper fork and the fish was out of this world.  From coffees and teas to the dessert menu, the same high quality was true. Although we did not have any, the wine list was very good.  My daughter's husband is blind, and the waitress was most descrete in assisting him as that no one but we knew what was going on.  For example, She would whisper to him that she was placing his coffee at 1pm and the dessert is at center. and so forth, you get the picture!  She made a good dining experience a great one and one to be remembered.  If you are in Cleveland, you must stop and enjoy  the experience!!  Their website is:  www.donslighthouse.com."}
{"text":"Went for a bday dinner. Six people were in my party and it really started off so so. Drinks were offered and they came out. Food was ordered and everyone meal came out in about 15 mins, not bad for a Saturday night. I ordered one of the special entrees ( corn meal crusted perch = fried fish) broccolini and risotto. After eating a piece of fish I removed the stalk from the broccoli and hair was in my food. A lot of hair around the broccolini stalk. Yuck!!! The manager did comp the meal but never apologized and neither did the server, which he was subpar for the start and was not welcoming at all. This was not my first time there, but likely my last.  One friend sent her steak back unprepared, the other four loves their meals."}
{"text":"This is such a great date spot. It's intimate, cozy, fine dining. The food is wonderful. I have had the salmon, lobster, lobster bisque, steak Oscar, tilapia... Never been disappointed. Nicely decorated at Xmas too!"}
{"text":"A co-worker and myself met for happy hour at this location after work one afternoon. I had arrived first so I went in and got us a table. Upon walking in the hostess was very friendly with a big smile on her face. She asked if I preferred dining room or lounge seating, I chose lounge seating so we could take advantage of Happy Hour. After getting seated I waited and waited and waited for someone to come over to me. After someone brought me water then I waited and waited and waited for the server to come take my drink order. About 10-12 minutes later the server finally came to me to ask me what I wanted to drink. This is the reason why I didn't give the place 5 stars.   The food was great! We had the: Spinach & Artichoke Dip Smoked Gouda, cheddar and cream cheese, served hot with pita chips $3.75  We both thought it was amazing (and we've tried a lot of different restaurants around Cleveland)  Stuffed Mushrooms Spinach, sun dried tomatoes, artichokes, sherry cream, Asiago cheese $4.25 Personally I wasn't too crazy about these mushrooms.  Prince Edward Island Mussels Sautéed with sherry and garlic butter $5 AMAZING! Probably the best mussels I've ever had.   Overall, the food was amazing, the drinks were good, the service was OK."}
{"text":"Absolute perfection. This is hands down the best restaurant in all of Cleveland. Whether you want scallops or steak you will not be disappointed. Eat here for fabulous food and a great date night!"}
{"text":"For my entire time living on the west side of Cleveland, I'm not sure what took me so long to try out Don's- but at the suggestion of a friend this weekend, we went to try it out.  Now, the Sunday mussels deal was worth it- $2 for a dozen of mussels??? How in the world is that possible? Plus, you get that nice crusty bread to dip in the sauce....it's a spectacular deal that lasts all Sunday (just sit in the lounge for it), and sure saves me a lot of effort of scrubbing and make mussels myself! Plus, the size of the mussels are actually quite decent- I thought for that price, I would get tiny little mussels- but they were good size!  My friend ordered the lobster tail- it was decent, in my opinion- and pretty good for being in the Midwest. I, however, ordered the lobster bisque- which was like drinking a bowl of salt. Way too salty- absolutely way too salty. So, don't order it- my fingers were just bloated the next day from all of that salt.  Stop by for that Sunday deal- it's a good price for all of you who are mussels fans."}
{"text":"Service was great!!  Was in on a Friday night around 8pm and the place was dead. The menu and decor just seem so dated. The food was blah. I can spend just as much money at newer restaurants, get more food that has more creativity and flavor. These are some of the reasons I most likely won't be back."}
{"text":"Another recommendation from a Cleveland friend and we enjoyed it very much.Good food and very good value."}
{"text":"Man my experience here was terrible my girl had grouper an I had the fried shrimp .the fish we didn't pay for cause it was spoil an my shrimp taste just like bread with no season  on it I definitely won't go back. That grouper was awful"}
{"text":"Slightly overpriced.  Quality is questionable.  Nice looking building.  No lake view.   I I ordered four sandwiches.  Burger was undercooked.  Chicken cordon bleu was juicy in the meat but dry overall.  Cuban had less meat than what you get at any fast food joint.  It was mostly pickles. The bread was reminiscent of a gas station sandwich. They had some higher price meals, but I didn't want to risk it, so I can't judge that.  You might want to go there for that."}
{"text":"Why can't restaurants get the bread right? This bread was boring. The butter was boring. There are restaurants (Rocky River's Salmon Dave's) that have GREAT bread. This should be a given. I ordered the grouper - which was great fish - however, the roll was as hard as a rock. The fries could have come from Mickie D's and the cole slaw had a bit too much horseradish (to the point where your sinuses cleared). All in all, I have to give the whole lunch a 2 out of 5 stars."}
{"text":"Don's Lighthouse is a Cleveland landmark found where the Shoreway begins. It is an old and reliable mainstay on the food scene. The clientele is usually an older post-work business crowd. The staff is professional and polite. Don's is within a short walk of my apartment and I have been visiting mostly on Monday nights for $6 burgers and the $13 steak on Wednesdays. I come here almost exclusively when I have a hunger for steak. It comes with green beans, carrots and garlic mashed potatoes. The steak is always cooked to temperature and I have never regretted it. The bread that accompanies the meal is some nice crusty bread. Bypass Red and XO. Save money for retirement."}
{"text":"Among foodies it is promoted that cheese and seafood don't mix.  Today I had the King Crab Macaroni and Cheese that I thought was very tasty.  While I understand the adage about cheese since the crab flavor was lost in the rich cheesy cream the four grilled shrimp on top did provide a nice seafood connection to the rest of the dish.  The decor dates back to times gone by but maintains an degree of sophistication."}
{"text":"I went for restaurant week. The night I was in the place was completely full in the dining room and the bar was standing room only. That said, while our server was friendly, service, mostly from the kitchen, was slow.   I order the stuffed mushroom appetizer. The flavor was great with the spinach, tomato, artichoke and creamy cheese sauce. The presentation however was a lacking. There was no garnishment, the two stuffed mushrooms were sliding around on the plate and the sauce looked a bit congealed.   The Salmon entree was good, but the protein was a bit overcooked. There were two corn cakes accompanying the dish which were very heavy and dense; not a favorite item of mine. The accompanying salad was good, but it had raw onion on it - good, but very potent for little added value. The aioli on the dish was good and the flavor of the salad with the salmon went well together.   All in all a bit of a disappointing evening. I've been in before when the restaurant was practically empty and gave a 5-star rating, so I would hazard a guess that restaurant week overwhelmed the staff."}
{"text":"I frequent Don's mostly on Wednesdays when they have the $13 steak dinner, which is one of the best steaks I've had in Cleveland and it's a great deal.   Also, the sea food is excellent. You can't miss with the shrimp cocktail. Don's has been in Cleveland a long time. I remember going there with my grandparents for a special family occasion. I believe I had my first clam chowder experience there.  It's a great place to relax and enjoy a great meal. The atmosphere is soothing, the staff is fast and friendly, and parking is easy."}
{"text":"We ate here on my birthday this year.  They have excellent steaks and food.  The atmosphere is uniquely cozy.  I would recommend this restaurant as a  once a month or special occasion.    Great Food---Great Service---Great Value"}
{"text":"Always pleased with my meal here . Tonight's special was $10 off surf N turf so I had that and it was so tender and yummy . My only complaint is that they don't offer baked potato, but the whipped tators are delish .   Our waitress was so friendly and accommodating ,that's always a plus !"}
{"text":"We just celebrated my Aunt and Uncle's 52nd wedding anniversary and wanted to find a place close to home for them.  Don's Lighthouse turned out to be a great choice.  The onion soup and salads were excellent.  Most of us ordered fish or seafood (sauteed scallops to nut crusted pike fish) and were very pleased.  Though we were guided toward seafood (Don's specialty)... some in our party ordered soup and sandwiches and felt that their meals were just average.  I'd highly recommend Don's... but would advise to stick to the seafood."}
{"text":"Still great food, but I stand corrected on interior remodeling. When I wrote my review, In my mind I  picture the inside as the same as when I went there long ago, plus it always pretty dark.  Note:  I always sit inside the bar area to take advantage of the happy hour. Anyway, I stand corrected per the manager's reply to my review: Thanks for taking the time to comment.  Certainly glad you enjoyed your meal. but ouch on the decor.  In May of '16, we gave the old gal a facelift...new color scheme, new booth upholstery, new DR carpeting, re-finished the bar floor, new photos on the walls of in and around Cleveland, even a new Cleveland mural in the back of the dinning room.  Perhaps the lighting was too dim to show it off.  Come back for Happy Hour, and please, take a second look at the DR decor...I'd love to hear back from you.  Kraig\""}
{"text":"This is definitely an iconic restaurant in Cleveland. Living here all my life, I have visited Don's many times over the years.   This particular visit was my first in about two years.  The place still has that old school polished restaurant vibe to it. There are so few restaurants left that are like that so it is charming.   It was Restaurant Week but we had to ask for the RW menu, which really irritates me as I think it should automatically be offered. Several Cleveland restaurants do this though and I'm not sure why.    My tilapia seemed a little overcooked. However, the salmon and scrod were both done to perfection according to my dining companions."}
{"text":"Very good waitress and great sliders, mussels need some work tho were bland and just not good. I really liked the crab cake tasty and Cesar salad was great as well :)"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try Don's since I moved to Lakewood 2.5 years ago. The iconic building is beautiful, historic, and hard to miss during my commute downtown from the west side, but I figured I'd save it for a special occasion. My birthday was this past weekend and my parents are big seafoodies. I'm constantly trying to get them to come up to CLE and try new things, so I figured now was as good a time as any to finally check it out ...   Reservation was at 6:30 on a Sunday. The restaurant was relatively empty but had an upscale, welcoming atmosphere with white, linen tablecloths and candles lit on the tables. We ordered a bottle of chardonnay, the shrimp cocktail to share, and a round of salad and soup (lobster bisque and one seafood chowder). They also brought out complimentary bread with herbed butter.   Everything was simply \"okay.\" The amount of lobster in the bisque was somewhat substantial, but the consistency was very oily. Wine was wine. Shrimp cocktail was shrimp cocktail, but came with extra horseradish (yum). Salad was meh, although they did split it without my bf and I asking because we implied we'd share (props). But the most memorable thing up to this point, to be honest, was the free butter.   For entrees, my mom and I went with the freshline scallops, my dad got the crusted walleye (looked good), and my boyfriend ordered the seared salmon (looked a little rare). Again, I wasn't blown away by the food. I actually started feeling a little sick while I was eating my entree, but I thought maybe I was just full or tired (it had been a loooong weekend). So I sort of just picked at it some more and asked for a box. Big fan of leftovers anyway!   Service sidenote: Our waiter seemed a little off -- he flat out didn't answer me when I asked him a question and at one point dropped a menu -- but being a former server, I gave him the benefit of the doubt. He also brought me a chocolate eclair with a candle in it for my birthday. It was delicious, much appreciated, and hands down the best part of the meal for me.   The rest of the table also wanted dessert, so my mom ordered tangerine sorbet, my dad got the chocolate mouse, and my bf went with the creme brûlée, which was really good at first but looked a little undercooked and congealed towards the end.   THIS IS WHERE THINGS SHIFT ...  An overall okay experience took an extreme nosedive when we got home. After watching TV for 20-30 minutes, the bf suddenly became very sick. Without going into too much detail, it was very obvious he was suffering from some sort of food poisoning situation that he needed to flush out of his system. After he did and got some sleep, he was back to his normal self.   Sighhhh. I'm incredibly supportive of local businesses and I'm not one to normally be negative, but this was really unfortunate. If the food had been incredible, I miiiight attempt a return. But as much as I hate to say it, we probably won't go back. :\"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place, especially for Happy Hour!  The service is always great, prices are good and the ambiance is very low key. Parking is never an issue and the food is delish!! I come here at least once a week."}
