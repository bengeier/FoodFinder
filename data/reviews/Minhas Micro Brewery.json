{"text":"Great place. Major flaw is how early it closes. I would have given 5 star if it was opened later. The pizza there is very good and I would recommend the tour."}
{"text":"The best fresh pizza and selection of micro brews in Calgary! I went here for the first time last week and was amazed at how yummy everything was! Can't wait to go on a beer tour next"}
{"text":"Bought the Groupon for four people and pizza. The pizza was great! Our tour guide Jonathan(I think his name was) was awesome!! The only thing that was super disappointing was that we only tried three different types of beer and didn't get to try any of there hard liquor. I've gone on other brewery tours and tried almost all of there beers and had lots of refills. I suggest maybe doing for then three beers to sample cause other wise it's not really worth it."}
{"text":"We went to Minhas with a coupon for a free pizza and a free growler (just the bottle). The atmosphere is surprisingly great. Located in a more industrial area near the airport, one doesn't expect a pub atmosphere with good food. The pizza was one of the best we've had at any price in Calgary. It was hot, fresh, thin crust with just the right amount of toppings.
We ordered beer and wine and the prices were excellent. I had the Dutch inspired beer which was refreshing. It was so good that I had my new growler filled with  it for consumption at home.
We'll be back with friends next time. 
Note that they do not accept cash here, only credit cards."}
{"text":"Michael was an awesome tour guide. Learned a lot of information and he was very bubbly, like the beer! The pizza was good too."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. We went in around 4:00pm not knowing that tours were at 7:00pm but we had a big enough group where the owner let us do a tour. Its a super cheap tour but super informational and there's beer tasting involved!! We tasted 3 really good beers. Michael, our tour guide, was AMAZING!!! He was super funny and even though we accidentally kept interrupting him, he soldiered on and made the tour super fun and informational! He made a super funny American joke which wasn't even offensive and it made us all laugh. 10/10 STARS FOR MICHAEL!!!! If you ever go on a tour, ask him to be your tour guide :-)"}
{"text":"Went for the tour and found was an awesome guide. Unfortunately missed out on the pizza but getting your growler filled for $9 was definitely worth it. If you have a chance I recommend going for a tour."}
{"text":"I'm a lightweight so I couldn't keep up with the tour tastings :D but it was enjoyable nonetheless. Jonathan was a good tour guide. I love how interactive and informative the tour was. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Last night we used our Groupon for 2 Pizzas, 4 drinks and a tour of the Brewery. The Fat Cat Pizza (Honey ham, pepperoni, genoa salami, Italian sausage and bacon) and Mountain Crest Blonde (chicken breast, roasted sweet peppers and caramelized sweet onions) were delicious! Both pizzas were full of toppings, had savoury white & red sauces and tasty crusts. The Dutch beer was light, refreshing and went really well with the pizza!

Our tour guide aka Jonah Hill was hilarious even though some of his jokes were very bottom of the barrel and in poor taste. We learned so much about the brewing process and the pride that Minhas takes in their distillery. The brewhaus was clean and well labelled and easy to manoeuvre around to the different areas. 

The best thing about this tour is the bottle openers (we bought 3) and the SWAG. Every person on the tour gets 3 bottles of beer to take home and the opportunity to buy as much beer as you want for one buck! The only caveat is that it has to be one of the featured beers on our tour. Our son who is a student loaded up. It was a great entertaining Friday night!"}
{"text":"THE BEST!  Michael was awesome and I highly recommend this tour.  MUCH better than Big Rock."}
{"text":"I love this place. Good food and oh my gosh so many choices of beers. Nick was a very informative tour guide. I just wish they'd stay open till late. Not a lot time for a a few pints with the boys after work."}
{"text":"I was convinced that I would hate beer all my life, but thankfully I can say I was wrong. I happened to come here with my boyfriend while he was on beer refilling trip, not really expecting anything from this place. My boyfriend urged me to try come beer here, as according to him, its the best in Calgary. After much refusal, I gave in and tried some Sunshine Lager. It went down nice and smooth and tasted great. Also had some of their pizza there, which was also amazing, The pizzas are a burst of flavor with a crispy crust. I recommend everyone to go, beer and pizza, a great combination. 
A bonus, they sell their brews for very cheap, much cheaper than getting it at a regular liquor store."}
{"text":"Very cool tour of the brewery. It was quite interesting, and the tour guide was super nice. The pizza is OK, if the pizza was better they would've got a higher score rating for sure. The beers are good, super interesting, well worth the visit I think... Crank up the quality that pizza and you've got a five star!"}
{"text":"The IPA put me off.

Service was mediocre at best.  The kid working the counter was missing for the first five minutes we were there and he kept disappearing.

Pizza is mediocre.

Nachos are big, fine."}
{"text":"This was an awesome tour! Our tour guide Michael was very welcoming and enjoyable. A very good deal for how many drinks you get to try and take home. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This is a pizza restaurant and brewery. They offer tours of the brewery and sell discounted craft beers to you afterwards. Some of the beers have to be consumed in the restaurant. (More on that later - pay attention because that's something they DON'T tell you during the tour.)

The restaurant:

Service from the restaurant guys was pretty good: friendly and quick. They greeted us as soon as we walked in and they were knowledgeable about the menu. I ordered the 12\" Fat Cat pizza, which to my knowledge isn't made from the meat of felines. The crust is thin and brittle and the whole thing was kind of salty. But they're not pizza connoisseurs here - they're all about the beer.

The tour:

First things first: this \"tour\" is just a glorified sales pitch for the beers that this brewery and their other location in Wisconsin makes. It's like being at a Tupperware party. They start off with a 10-minute video which extols the virtues of the brewery before the host gives you a song-and-dance about all their products. This song-and-dance does include samples of three of their beers though. 40 minutes later (yes, 40 minutes) they take everyone a few steps beyond the front door of the brewery and basically say, \"Here it is!\" If you're seriously interested in how beer is made and would like an in-depth view of the brewery, this tour isn't for you. They do pass bottle caps around though so if you've never seen a bottle cap before, you'll be in seventh heaven. At the end of the tour you get to keep your sample glass as well as two bottles of beer and a bottle of specialty pop.

You also can buy certain flavours of beer for a dollar each and walk out with them: Sunshine Lager, Dutch Nation Lager and one of the IPAs (I forget which). We decided to support the brewery and buy a few cases. If I had known the guy working the counter was in the middle of his monthly mood cycle, I wouldn't have given them a dime. The beer that is discounted and at regular price is not clearly communicated during the tour. And the beer that you are able to walk out with and put in your car is not communicated at all! There were certain other brands that they sell which I wanted to try:

Moody brewery guy: \"Are you drinking that here? Anything that's imported, you cannot take with you.\"

Me: \"I can't take all this with me?\"

Moody brewery guy: (rudely) I TOLD you that you can't take any imported beers out of here. They have to be consumed here.\"

Okay - I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S IMPORTED AND WHAT IS DOMESTIC. Nor am I familiar with idiosyncratic laws imposed on us by the beer police. Nor were these instructions passed on during the sales pitch (oops, I mean \"tour\"). I told him to forget about it - I'm only buying what I can leave with.

This business has an internal communication problem. I don't have an issue with their upselling but I can't tolerate having an employee bitch and complain at me because the tour guide is giving partial info. Unscrew yourselves!"}
{"text":"This was my first brewery tour, and Minhas has set an incredible high standard of tours. Our tour guide Michael was real thorough and always ready for any questions.  We got to sample a few beers, learn more about beer itself, and then see the entire process of brewing along with packaging! Highly recommend this tour!! Also a tip-check groupon for a great deal on this brewery!"}
{"text":"We had a very knowledgeable tour guide named Jonathan who gave a great tour. They had great beer, especially the White Wolf, without any preservatives  ."}
{"text":"Ordered the Reuben sandwich with fries and the marbled rye came out burnt. Flies buzzing around the restaurant, and the servers seemed confused as where the food was going. 
Brewery tour was about as underwhelming. Started off with a 9 minute video on how they make the beer rather than having the guide explain. Not allowed to go near the equipment as there were, \"too many spills, hoses and chemicals\" to let the group have a proper tour. 
Tour guide was young and not overly experienced with the brewery and spoke in monotone. 
Long story short, if you want a g brewery tour, head over to Wild Rose Brewery."}
{"text":"the tour was fun and I formative the beer samples were great the pizza was good all in all great time"}
{"text":"Last summer the Minhas' siblings opened this micro brewery to focus on craft brews in Canada. There was some controversy at first because of a tax subsidy and they've had some setbacks getting going, but everything seems to be almsot fully up and running now.

For $10 + tax, you can get a tour of the brewery. The tour begins in their tasing room, and extension of their restaurant, with a slide show about the basics of beer, the process, and some trivia. The slide show was good. They covered the basics and gave a few historical examples. If you've done a brewery tour before then this information may not be new to you. Beer is a pretty simple process afterall.

Next, the giude takes you into the back where you go upstairs to the gift shop which overlooks the brewing area. After an explanation of what the various vats and equipment is you have a few minutes to browse through the gift shop and ask the tour guide any questions. 

Following this, you go back to the tasting room to sample the beers. During the tasting process you get about one pint total. The samples that were offered on my tour were Boxer Lager, Swiss Amber, Imperial Jack IPA, and Chocolate Bunny Chocolate Stout.

At the very end of the tour the guide gives everyone a gift pack. The pack includes two bottles of Blumer's sodas, a bottle of Gluten Free Lazy Mutt beer, and the glass that you were using to sample the brews with, which they will rinse out for you.

In general I find Minhas beers to be boring. Their flavours don't really wow me and fall flat. They seem very simple and don't provide me with anything unique. Boxer Lager is what it is and I probably wouldn't be able to taste the difference between it and any of the \"big\" lager brands. Swiss Amber was the best of the samples but still nothing really impressive for me. The Imperial Jack is the one that really let me down.  I love IPA's and this one just didn't have the hoppy-ness that I like in a good IPA. Finally, the Chocolate Bunny was good, but it was a very mild stout. It didn't really stand on its own like I would expect and I just felt like I was muddling through the sample.

Overall I'd give this place a 3-star rating for the beer but everything else was pretty great which bumps it up to 4-stars. 

Great job by our tour guide."}
{"text":"Michael was superrrrrr coool! Best tour guide ever! This tour was superrrr informative and super fun.

{"text":"Fun tour! You see the entire production process from grain to can! Absolutely loved the samples we were given and was blown away by how delicious the beers were. I'm not too much of a beer person, but I think Minhas is going to change that real soon."}
{"text":"Michael was outstanding and a great tour guide for the brewery !!
