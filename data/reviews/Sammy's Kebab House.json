{"text":"They have a great food and taste is truly authentic. After a long time got a chance to have such a nice food. I would definitely recommend it!!!"}
{"text":"The food was great! I had the seekh kabob wrap. It is hands down the best wrap I have ever had; the meat was spiced wonderfully. The bread was fresh. The sauce tasted of a bit of tamarand. My husband had the vindaloo, medium spicy. Another great dish along with perfect rice and naan. Very good value. The ambiance was not great, but the food more than made up for it and the service was friendly too."}
{"text":"Had lunch this week. Good price for Indian buffet.

Offerings were very tasty, but limited in number. More selection down the road at India Garden, but I liked the spicing at Sammy's more, which is what Indian is about, to me.

Food was more lukewarm than I like, but I was the only customer when I came in, and only 2 more came in while I was there, so I guess it's hard for the steam table to keep it hot.

Service was attentive."}
{"text":"WOW what a great place!

As the old saying goes... Don't judge a book buy the cove!  The building doesn't look like much from the outside but the food is very good!  The menu they offer inside the restaurant isn't as detailed as the one on the website but the food is still excellent!  The service is also very good.  The next time I am in town I'll be glad to visit a second time."}
{"text":"Excellent Indian and Pakistani dishes! Had the goat kahari (sp?) with medium heat and WOW tender goat, delicious sauce and perfectly titrated heat. I'm still burping deliciousness as I write this.  

We stopped here on the way back to Lancaster and while the place has some frayed edges like the bathrooms and forgetting to give us the chick peas side, they nailed my dish."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice so far and have been pleased with the food each time. The butter chicken is really good, in fact, I really liked everything that I've tried. They have a lunch buffet on weekends, which is a great opportunity to try several different menu items for a reasonable price. 

The outside of the restaurant is rather plain, which makes it easy to overlook. The restaurant is in the same building as the Sunrise Inn. 
This place is definitely worth seeking out if you want to eat Indian food."}
{"text":"Just wasn't what I expected. With the array of food choices on the menu I expected the buffet to be a little more varied. It seemed more like the expected saucey dishes with 3 chicken dishes, 3 veggie dishes, rice, nan, and veggie pakora. The taste was fine but just not satisfying or impressive @ $10."}
{"text":"I've just read several glowing reviews of this restaurant.  I have to say I disagree. Perhaps the food was poor because I went mid-afternoon, mid-week and was the only patron there at the time. I had bought a Groupon for the meal. That's what brought me there. The outside appearance is shabby, but the interior is interesting: strangely sloped wood-paneled ceilings, stone work, murals, etc. Very nice. I ordered the lamb kebab. You'd think with a name that includes the word \"kebab\" the lamb would have been good. But no: It was just awful. It was overdone, dry and tasteless. The chickpea side was okay, and the bread, pan, was excellent. But I couldn't enjoy it. I would have sent the lamb back, but for some reason I didn't. I asked that it be wrapped up; I through it out when I got home."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Sammy's a half-dozen times and never seen more than one other diner in here, which is a real shame; this place is a gem.  The naan is absolutely perfect: puffy, chewy, crispy, and a tiny bit charred at the edges.  The Chicken Karahi is one of the best Mughlai dishes I've ever had.  As with any place that's not crowded, stay away from the buffet.  

The exterior is admittedly a bit grim, but I found the inside pleasant and the food superb."}
{"text":"The previously named Bismillah is now reopened under a new name, owner and chef. Although the exterior and interior decor might still look the same as before (for folks who may have visited Bismillah) and might not be to everyone's taste, the food is lightyears ahead of its predecessor and is finger-licking good! 

Been here a couple of times and I must say I haven't been disappointed so far. One of the best mutton karahi (spiced goat meat seared on a wok) I've had in the US. The butter chicken is well-spiced, not too creamy, not too spicy and the beef seekh kebabs with a buttery naan do pack a punch. Vegetarians should try the Lahori Chhole / chaana. 

All in all SKH serves good mughlai food at affordable prices in an unpretentious setting.. 

It's a force to be reckoned with!"}
{"text":"Nice Authentic Indian food. Their Chicken Tikka Masala is something you wanna taste. Services are slow but good. My wife tried Lamb curry and it was extremely scrumptious

Must eat out if you are in that area and wanna try Indian food. !"}
{"text":"The food here was really authentic Indian food. My kids and I loved it.  We ordered mater paneer,  Chicken Biriyani and Beef Shikh kebabs.  I am anxious to try out some of the other entrees.  We chose carry out and I'll probably do that again in the future.  The idea of eating in not very appealling.  It's a little rough in there.  Floors were stickey and overall dirtish, by American standards.

It was also on the expensive side.  $30 for the 3 entrees which were NOT over sized.  But again the food was VERY good!!"}
{"text":"So glad this place exists, even if in the suburbs. I have no qualms with driving the  20 minutes to Monroeville in order to feast on some of the best Middle Eastern food Pittsburgh has to offer.

I know very little of the Islam faith; but, I'm willing to bet Sammy's Halal cuisine is enough to pacify all religious sects into believing and understanding the importance of the kebab.  About these kebabs: (my favorite being the chicken) are all supremely juicy, perfectly seasoned, and slightly charred to perfection - served with fresh onions and green peppers for a crisp contrast, your choice of rice or naan, and always a side of spicy chickpeas.  And i didn't even mention the portions for the price. The mere thought of it all makes me salivate. This is the comfort food your mom or grandma doesn't know how to make unless you grew up Muslim...

Beyond the food, I'm honestly delighted to see the business picking up at the somewhat awkward location.  Having eaten here when it was previously Bismallah and again as it is today, I've seen this location from the sight of the only occupied table to a moderately steady influx of people both dining in and taking out at 9:30pm on a weeknight. Whether it be by word of mouth or the fact that their largely lit 'Kebab House' sign shines brightly along Business Route 22- across from Miracle Mile Mall - there's no denying it's great to see Sammy's Kebab House is finally receiving the patrons it deserves...the food alone certainly warrants every visit, and return visit, and did I mention they cater? Whatever the occasion, next time you're in Monroeville, skip the TGIFridays or Mad Mex, and instead, treat yourself to some kebab(s) at Sammy's. Your suburbanite life will feel a whole lot spicier afterwards, I promise."}
{"text":"Good food, good value. 
For the buffet.
We have not ordered off the menu yet, but thanks to Groupon, we hope to soon.
So, that means, we are willing to go back and spend our money on what we thought was good quality food, which is why we go out to eat.
The space itself, well,let's face it, it's a room to eat in, not much more.  But, not bad.
It could be, the more people support this restaurant, they will have the funds to improve the inside but for now, go, and enjoy the food....it will be an inexpensive vacation to appreciate another's culture, if you are not of that heritage, that is!"}
{"text":"Just WOW.

I have NEVER had a better Indian meal.  EVER.  I had the goat Kahari - perfectly spiced goat with potatoes and veggies in a thick, dark Spicy sauce.  I ordered a 6 in terms of spiciness, and my face was dripping with sweat.  Perfect!

The naan was amazing (though I've rarely had naan I didn't love).  Staff was very friendly, even though I was in a hurry.  The music was pretty cool as well.

I will definitely be back.  Well worth the trip."}
{"text":"Nice place and music is a good experience...I ordered the lamb kabob and the lamb was really drive and they didn't have any extra gravy...they only make the gravy with certain dishes. Service was ok the guy was gone from our table for longer then 10 minutes when I actually needed him...

Chick peas were great tho very tasty with garlic naan. Other than that I was an ok experience."}
{"text":"What an unexpected find in strip-mall infected Monroeville this is. Kay and I came here for lunch while waiting for nearby NTB to replace a tire on the Kaymobile on New Year's Eve no less. 

Having not one clue as to what to order, we went with Vegetable Pakora for a starter. I had for myself the Chicken Achari, and Kay had Goat Kahari, which I didn't sample. 

The Vegetable Pakora was an expertly fried and starchy success that went on famously with the green and brown chutneys we were given for dipping. Sadly, I cannot identify those sauces. My Googling isn't helping much. 

The only thing I didn't like about my Chicken Achari was that the chicken, which came on the bone, wasn't plentiful enough. Only one piece had an ample amount of meat on it, and I really had to scrape to find more of it. Sammy's offers a boneless version of this very dish, and I regretted not ordering it for the chicken I did have was sublimely tender and spiced. Nonetheless, it was exotic, tasty, generously-portioned overall, and vacated my sinuses but good. The slightly charred naan acted as a fine picker-upper for the excess gravy. 

The atmosphere is akin to an upscale diner and thus is very laid back. We were surprised to find that our server was a born-and-raised local with a Pittsburgh accent and streetwise demeanor. She took the time to get to know us, her eyes  widening with shock and later sympathy when we recounted our rough day to her. 

She asked me while Kay was in the bathroom, \"After all that, yinz still goin' to her grandma's? I think yinz should. It ain't THAT late!\" 

We're a \"nebby\" lot y'know? God love her. 

Nope, we weren't at Eggs N At but a kebab house/Indian/Pakistani/Halal kind of joint. 

Only in the Pittsburgh metro area..."}
{"text":"My brother swore by this place and it didn't disappoint. I was greeted by the typical confusion of a middle eastern/southwest asian restaurant where there was ethnic dub-step, Egyptian hieroglyphics, and pakistani urdu on the walls.  For food, I went through the tandoori chicken like a pittsburgh snow plah'. 

On a goofball note: The visit was also memorable due to my Dad's typical shenanigans. We arrived 10 minutes before opening. He thought that by parking right in front of the main window and constantly looking in, it would force the staff to open for us. Being Christmas Eve, im glad they never noticed us - and they were really great considering they were working on everyone else's holiday."}
{"text":"I think this place is closed looks pretty run down and there is two signs for two restaurants"}
