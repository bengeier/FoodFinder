{"text":"This was such a pleasant surprise. We had never been here before, friends and I went for a buffet lunch and we were really impressed!!  They had a lovely selection and brought us a basket of delicious warm naan bread. One of the best we have ever had. Loved that the intensity of spice wasn't overwhelming in some dishes, like at other buffets. Their desserts were so fresh and delicious we couldn't resist seconds.  Service was great. We highly recommend this restaurant and will definitely be back. Thank you!!"}
{"text":"I found this little out-of-the-way spot on Yelp. I've had a taste for Indian food since I arrived in Calgary nearly two weeks ago. Hailing from Los Angeles we have some of the best Indian food I've ever tasted in the United States. I will say this place did not disappoint. At a bargain price of around $11 American it's an all-you-can-eat lunch buffet that has a vast variety of Indian dishes. I literally tried a bit of everything but the Goat Curry, Butter Chicken and Tikka Masala are the standouts. Fairly prompt service , very clean and enjoyable environment, traditional Indian decor and Indian music. My overall experience here was really good... Although that last trip to the buffet I probably didn't need. Easy parking as it's in a strip mall and seeing its a buffet you don't really need to wait to eat. Definitely a thumbs-up on this place all the way around as it exceeded my expectations. In the words of my former Governor I'll be back."}
{"text":"This is by far one of the best Indian restaurants I've ever been to. While alot of the Indian joints around town are good, I've found the service to be lacking. Gate of India is the exception. The host/waiter Umesh was amazing. He took the time to explain the menu and engage us. We had the Lamb Rogan Josh, Goat Curry and Butter Chicken. The flavours were rich and delicious. To top it all off we had Kheer or Rice Pudding for dessert and oh man was it delicious. The owner is also the chef. It's very apparent that he takes great pride in his restaurant and his food. We will definitely be back. HIGHLY recommend."}
