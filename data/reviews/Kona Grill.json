{"text":"We just returned from a great meal at Kona Grill. The macadamia nut chicken and teriyaki ribeye were perfect.  From the moment we walked in the door we had outstanding service from Trevor and Bud.  We could not have asked for a better experience. Thanks for a great evening.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":".  Came with clients for happy hour and immediately got a bad vibe from our waiter Jason.  He got obviously irritated because our party of 6 took up 2 tables and declined to move all of our drinks etc, to a single table for 6'once it was finally open.  He was rude and openly unhappy that we were taking up space.  When our sushi was delivered, a few people said the tuna rolls didn't taste like  tuna and when they mentioned it to Jason AND the manager, they both argued and acted as if we were ignorant and just wanted not to pay for the rolls!  Even with the sketchy treatment I tipped him 20%, only to have one of our party overhear him and the manager talking trash about us on their way back from the restroom!  I'm a regular there and Kona is not cheap and neither am I!  However, I will NOT be back to this location and both waiter Jason and unprofessional manager can choke on their tuna rolls that are not real tuna!"}
{"text":"was there a month ago horrific experience, the manager called me to apologize, I reluctantly accepted an offering of two gift cards, they were never sent, go figure.  Called today to ask them how that is possible, got hung up on. Stay away!"}
{"text":"My Grandaughter Haley and I went here for dinner while shopping in the mall. We love the atmosphere and the Sushi. We had the catapillar roll and chopped salads which were huge and delicious.The service was friendly and quick and we always enjoy this place."}
{"text":"I happened to be at a nearby restaurant for their happy hour when another person sitting at the bar watching a baseball game on the bar TV struck up a conversation with me and told me he worked here. After listening to him talk up the place and finding out they fly in fresh fish daily and sometimes twice daily, I decided to head over and check them out. I found a seat at the sushi bar and enjoyed some of the best sushi I'd had in a while and definitely the best I've had anytime while in AZ. Kona Grill has great ambience, good food and a wonderful helpful staff. Check them out!"}
{"text":"The Kona Grill at Scottsdale Quarter is fantastic.  New, clean and extremely large portions.  My favorite is the Poke bowl.  Lots of Ahi tuna and salmon with lots of avocado.  The servers are knowledgeable and make sure that you have a great experience.  Austin and Jewels are two of my favorites.  Be sure to check it out!"}
{"text":"I was disappointed after dining here for a Sunday happy hour. The bar area was crowded and loud so my party decided to try to sit at a table on the patio. The outside table had not been wiped down thoroughly and there were a few flies swarming around so we decided to wait for a table to open up in the bar/lounge area so that we could order from the happy hour menu.   We ordered the calamari, which was probably the best item we tried but was not that impressive compared to many others in the area. We also ordered the cheeseburger sliders which were too pink, and the fiery shrimp and crab crunch rolls which were just ok but nothing special.   Our food was delivered before we received plates, so we had to get up and ask the bartender to provide some for us.  And our server, who was rushing around did not return to ask how our food turned out or if we would like to order anything else.   I don't plan on returning here."}
{"text":"Planned a beautiful lunch today at Kona Grill at Fashion Square mall. Approached the front desk hostess to be completely ignored to where I entered looking to surpass her and find some type of service at the sushi bar. Returning then to the front (Mackenzie) quickly ended the phone call she was still on after I gave her a questionable look. Being that she didn't place the caller on hold. (only assuming it was a personal phone call). Then after asking for a booth for my friend and I to enjoy our lunch. She repeatedly gave me excuse after excuse why we couldn't get a booth. When they had two full booths in the front room and a all most full open room in the rear half. Sarcasm was strong with this women. Haha.  Now, after being seated in a booth. We were introduced to a lovely waitress who, for the whole meal, made the lunch return back to my past amazing outing at this restaurant. Our food was on point, out fresh and fast with out sacrificing a sliver of excellence. Great environment, supreme chefs, pristine dining. I will continue to find myself for a welcoming lunch or lightly elegant dinner."}
{"text":"Sat outside, watched the European Cup Soccer match.  Had great iced teas and tasty veggie flatbread pizza.  The server was fast, nice, efficient, and friendly.  Even though we were outside under the huge covering it was not hot despite being 108 degrees outside.  Had a great time even though I did not drink any alcohol!  The sushi veggie rolls we tried were excellent and fresh...."}
{"text":"I don't drink alcohol so I don't find the bar atmosphere appealing. I actually find the meat market vibe annoying. But they do a good job of keeping the bar and restaurant separate.   Now, as for the food, I used to love their food. I have been to the san tan location as well as the scottsdale fashion square location. I have had their sea bass and famous macadamia nut chicken. It USED to be incredible. The sticky rice on the side was a delicious side dish.    I went to this location today and was dismayed with the entire experience. Something must have changed in the last year because, the service was slow, the food was bland and not nearly as good as it used to be. I am sad to say the sea bass, which used to be on my top ten list, was not as tender and needed a lot of salt."}
{"text":"This is really a great place to relax and have great food. I always meet my friends here for get togethers. The service is excellent. I highly recommend them."}
{"text":"Just got over a severe case of Food Poisoning from this place. Do your self a favor and STAY AWAY!!!!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good! The basil sausage fettuccine something I had was really good, just spicy enough to make me happy and not overwhelm the dish. My daughter had a hamburger, French fries, and rice. It was served in a bento box with a cute bear shaped orange for dessert. Good service, and we loved the giant fish tank we sat next to. So pretty and fun for the kiddo."}
{"text":"Kona Grill really surprised me with how great their happy hour is! And on top of that I love any place with reverse happy hour on a Friday night!! Cheap drinks and great food always make me happy!"}
{"text":"Good place when you have a mixed group of Sushi and non-Sushi eaters.  They offer a gluten free menu and are accommodating at making changes to your order.  I particularly enjoy the Blood Orange martini, or two, and the Salmon Special Roll.    However because they are a chain restaurant they recently changed their menu based on the nationwide popular choices.  For me that means no more Hana Salad which I loved, and my partner was sorry to see one of their noodles dishes go, but he has learned to order a new noodle dish and ask them to make it with Ramen noodles."}
{"text":"Being from California, I was hesitant to try sushi in Arizona.  I mean, how fresh could it be?  Well, I'm glad I did because it was really fresh and really delicious here.  The variety of food that you can order here is so interesting!  My husband and I have enjoyed sushi, pad thai, and pizza all in the same meal.  Some of my favorite items include the edamame, salmon nigiri, Philadelphia roll and the Macadamia Nut Chicken."}
{"text":"Kona Grill is a tough place for me to review. It's in a great location and is upscale, comfortable, and has excellent service. The outdoor seating is well laid out and has misters that make it very tolerable on a warm day.   But.... the food is vastly overpriced and the portions are smaller that I would expect. I went there a few weekends ago with a large group and we ordered a mix of dishes. I had a Cuban sandwich and a CA roll.  The sandwich was meh, just ok. The wife had pork tenderloin and did not like it. The CA roll was good, but anyone should be able to get that roll right.   For the price, I was a little disappointed. If you are looking for a place to hang with friends, this would be a good choice.  For me, I was looking for a great meal and Kona did not quite deliver."}
{"text":"The one star is for the remodel and my son's chicken linguine.  My first experience at Kona Grill was in June  of 2014. I came to Las Vegas for my grandsons graduation.  After graduation a group of family and friend (16 of us) went to the Kona Grill for lunch Grandson's graduation , family and friends (16 of us)  I had the Big Kahuna cheese burger and it was the best burgerI I have ever had.  My son had the Kona chopped salad . We continued to go there often. I moved to Las Vegas last winter and was anxious for the re-opening.  Yesterday was my son's birthday and I wanted to take to lunch.  He ordered the Kona chopped salad and it was one-half the size--I ordered the burger  it had NO flavor--the onions were not carmelized they were grilled absolutely NO flavor"}
{"text":"If I have to choose- I prefer not to give this place any star based on the service. I love kona grill and had such great experienced with old town scottsdale location. Since old town was too far, I decided to try this high street location instead for the first time. I went there for my bday lunch on a weekday afternoon. The restaurant was completely dead with no more than 10 diners in the restaurant. My sister and nephew was on their way there to meet me. I came early and I wanted to sit outside cause the weather was beautiful. I asked the hostess if it was open seating outside- she said yes and I went to grab a table. I sat for 20 mins without one waiter/waitress coming by. The out side bar was directly in front of me. So I waved the bartender to signal her I need service- she nodded and never sent anyone.. I sat there for another 15 mins and finally the hostess that I spoke to earlier came and ask me if I've been help. I told her no and she said she'll get someone. At this time my sister and nephew was running late but they finally arrived. Once they got there, I told them what happened and I suggested we leave. But they were strap for time to go drive and find another place. So we sat for another 10 mins and I finally flag down a waiter and told him I've been sitting for 35 mins with no service. Turn out that waiter was my waiter and he not once apologized for what happened. We were all hungry and decided let's order and eat and get out of there. We ordered 3 entrees and one appetizer. The appetizer came out along with 2 entrees. We share our food but was waiting for the 3rd one. After waiting for 20 mins to find our waiter to ask about our 3rd entree- he finally came by. We asked him about our missing dish and he said we never order it (keep in mind I repeated our order 3 times) he didn't apologized for the mistake or suggest to us that he will put it in. He just gave us this look like \"oh well\" and stood there in silent. I was so upset and said never mind. At this point we want to get the hell out of there. My nephew decided to go speak to the manager about our experienced and all he did was took $10 off.. I didn't care about the $10 , I was upset how we were poorly treated. I will never go back to this location again."}
{"text":"Bama rolls are very good.  Also try the Volcano it is awesome.  The macadamia nut chicken is superb.  Service is always good."}
{"text":"Had the worst experience today at Kona Grill.  My wife and I went in for lunch.  There was no one to greet us at the door so we went and sat at the bar.  The bartender came over and dropped off menus and left.  We sat there for a while and he continued to serve everyone around us but never asked what we would like to drink.  I finally got his attention and he came over.  He said he did not like to bother people when they were on the phone.  I told him I was on hold on a business call and it was ok we could give him our drink order.  He then told me he would not be serving us alcohol at the bar and we could go find a table and be served.  I told him we were there for lunch and did not want alcohol. He proceeded to take the menus and told us again to go find a table he would not be serving us alcohol at the bar.  We got up and I asked to speak to manager.  I believe he did not want to serve my wife and I because my wife took a call from her mother and was speaking Spanish while on the call that lasted about 2 minutes.  Just did not want to service Hispanics today I guess."}
{"text":"Awesome happy hour and great patio bar space. It can get packed, but being right when happy hour started there wasn't too many here. Chicken lettuce wraps are really good, they really give you a lot in that small bowl. It is a bit pricey for regular priced items, but that's why I came during happy hour. One thing I felt under-dressed because there was a lot of professionals with business attires here."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here when the weather was nice out. They have outdoor dining and thought it would be a nice date. We stood around for about 8 minutes before anyone helped us , they sat us at a dirty table and had to wait even longer for menus. I ordered sushi, and my husband got a meat dish. We were both disappointed with our meal. Not to mention I had to get up and get my own utensils. It looked a lot better than it tasted. Not impressed and would not recommend this to anyone."}
{"text":"We were in Vegas over the President's Day long weekend.  We did not want to stand in line in any buffet knowing it will be packed.  We decided to try out this restaurant due to it offered variety of food.  We ordered the Kona chopped salad, sweet-chili glazed salmon, and basil pesto linguine, the dishes were delicious and very well prepared. The price was also reasonable.  We sat at the corner with a very nice purple lighting back ground, the pictures came out make us look like we were dining in an expensive restaurant :)) Definitely will go back to this restaurant next time we visit Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Came to Vegas for the weekend from the California Bay Area. My girl and I were looking for a good late lunch/happy hour spot and came across this place. SO GOOD. Not even kidding, we came back the very next day. Awesome decor and atmosphere, nice open-air bar with outside patio seating. AMAZING happy hour! As I said I'm from the Bay Area so I'm used to tiny bite-sized portions for the money you pay, you get so much here! BBQ flatbread was basically a full-sized pizza for $7! Love the fusion of cuisine, with plenty of sushi and non-sushi items. I manage at a high-end Japanese restaurant and I have to say the sushi was great and reasonably priced. Everything we ate was delicious. Manny was a great bartender, very friendly and even gave us \"tourist advice\" as far as cool stuff to do and check out. This will be a mandatory stop whenever I go to Vegas. My only drawback is that the 2nd day we went there (which was a Saturday) they don't offer happy hour but the menus are still on the table and bar top. We had a different server that day and he didn't let us know until we got our check and I asked him about it. Not a huge deal, but he saw us order off the happy hour menu and didn't tell us that we would be paying full price. Simple solution - take the happy hour menus away if it's not happy hour! Other than that, definitely recommend. 5 stars"}
{"text":"Yes this place to the eye is very nice music is good but the tvs are way to high and as for you sushi some are good and others look like it came out of a can but other than that the service was on point and bathrooms are clean."}
{"text":"Great restaurant at Boca Park in Summerlin.  The sushi here is fantastic: fresh, great portions, and very high quality.  I've had the spicy tuna roll, the yellowtail, and the salmon.  It's all delicious!  And for non-sushi fans, Kona Grill has an extensive menu of \"favorites\" including meatloaf, pizza, burgers.  I had a bite of a friend's pepperoni pizza and it was really good with a nice, thin crust.  Only bummer is that the place got rid of its amazing banana pudding.  It was one of my favorite desserts anywhere so I was upset to see it removed from the menu."}
{"text":"Kona Grill was once my favorite place to eat, the menu was exciting, and always freshly prepared. Boy have things changed! The place was once cozy and dark, classy and relatively quiet. Now... there are big screen tvs on every wall, most of the booths are gone, and the atmosphere is one of a cheap sports bar. LOUD is an understatement. I ordered Brandy and ginger with a lemon twist, what I received was brandy and water with a rind from a completely rotten lime wedge... yuck.  So they don't even do the bar scene well. I ordered the macadamia nut encrusted roasted pork tenderloin in a mushroom sauce... what I received was probably days old, pan seared DRIED out pork something... no macadamia nuts... no mushroom sauce, 4 tiny slices of shriveled mushroom on the plate covered with fried onions and a mountain of potatoes with completely limp bok choy. Terrible meal. The only reason I gave the place 1 star is the waitress was very sweet, very apologetic about the drink, and I didn't have it in me to tell her just how awful the meal was after she was so nice."}
{"text":"Food was amazing, great service, nice atmosphere.  Lydia ansel words can't even describe the talent this  young lady possesses."}
{"text":"I went here to celebrate a friend's birthday.  I'd say there were about 20 guests with 3 servers.  The service wasn't memorable.  On more than an occasion cups were completely empty.  Our food came out relatively quickly considering how many of us there were.  The food was what was expected.  I ordered miso soup and a crunchy crab roll.  Nothing special about either one.  The ambience was nice and I noticed they had a good happy hour.  But when it came to getting the check, we each had to ask for our own.  I do appreciate that they were able to slit a check for the size of group there were, but thought it was odd how the checks would randomly come in doses.  All in all I will probably go back when I'm feeling like typical chain sushi. :)"}
{"text":"My wife and I came here looking for something slightly lower-key that what we'd found elsewhere on the strip. Our waitress was lovely, but unfortunately the food was quite mediocre. The steak was overcooked (we did ask for well done, but it was still over-done) and the sushi was meh."}
{"text":"Ate here last Friday and although I was tempted to have sushi, I forced myself to try something new... and went with the miso-sake marinated sea bass ($23.95).  The dish came with a decent sized fillet of grilled sea bass, grilled broccolini spears and some (surprisingly) tasty fried rice.  The food went well with my glass of pinot grigio ($7), and although the fish wasn't as fresh as I thought it could be, I was still satisfied with the order.    My friend ordered the sweet-chili glazed salmon ($18.95), which came with a generously sized grilled salmon piece, grilled broccolini spears, fried rice, and green onion curls.  I took a bite of her salmon and found it to be tasty; there was a little kick because of the chili glaze.  (See photos)"}
{"text":"Staff was great; drinks were ok. Management suxs! Got coupon for free appetizer from info desk in mall adjoining restaurant. After we got our drinks and the appetizer, the waiter tells us they won't honor the coupon. He was nice and I felt bad for him. The waiter tells us to check in on the Yelp app and the appetizer will still be free, so we do. Life is good. The waiter comes back over and says Management won't honor the Yelp offer either! The waiter was so apologetic. I said nevermind about the entrees just bring me my check. I'm sure I'll never go back despite this being the first day of my 2 weeks in Vegas. Poor manager will probably put them out of business."}
{"text":"I love it here! The staff is so friendly and the atmosphere is the perfect mix is laid back but nice. The sushi is pretty standard in terms of rolls and nigiri, but always so yummy! I just wish they would not have gotten rid of the Albacore Tataki app- that was my fave. The patio is amazing, especially when the back patio is open! TVs and fire pits. I'll keep coming back :)"}
{"text":"Nice ambience, reminded me somewhat of PF changs. Although kona was asian fusion, I decided to just stick with plain old sushi and rolls. It was mediocre, but I'm still eager to come back again next time to try out their other menu!"}
{"text":"My experience this evening was so lovely! The happy hour pricing was really affordable and the portions were really nice. Nacho, our sushi chef, was nacho average sushi chef lol. Very kind and helpful and the rest of the staff made sure we had what we needed always."}
{"text":"Pretty good place. We ordered a lot of food. The waitress did not seem to pleased with the desserts and couldn't really recommend a good one, so we did not get one.  We had 4 people total eating, with 1 child. The child's chicken nuggets looked really tasty and I almost wanted to ditch my sea bass for her mac n cheese.  The appetizers were swell, as we ordered the diablo shrimp (I recommend getting the diablo sauce on the side, its spicy) and the dumplings. The meat inside the dumplings was dry, but it still was seasoned well and came with traditional dipping sauce.  We did not order alcohol, so I cannot comment on the drinks. I had the miso-sake seabass, cooked medium and it was very soft, buttery and tasty. The shrimp / pork fried rice was not to-die for but it was a good side to fend off the tasteless ratatouille.  I would probably not come back if I returned to Arizona, but it was still a good experience."}
{"text":"All I've gotta say is if you haven't already tried the house Margaritas, you are missing out! This is my favorite location out of all the Kona Grills. Amazing Happy Hour from 3-6pm! Haven't tried anything I don't like!"}
{"text":"O.K.  So Kona Grill is just another chain that puts out ok food at way to high of a price. Everything is just about average or slightly below. Nothing outstanding about it, which in this day and age is not ok. Although i do have to say that there happy hour is the best thing they have going for them. All in all i just find there food to be boring. I had the Sea Bass with a misu bbq glaze i think. i found it to be cook ok but that was the only thing about my meal that i found to be worth mentioning. oh well perhaps i will give another try some time."}
{"text":"Okay, so Kona is all new shiny and clean inside.  The menu is the same, at least the Happy Hour menu is.  However, the prices went up!  The service is the same BAD service that Kona has always had.  The new and improved shiny Kona Grill is nothing great.  If you want the same old, same old then definitely go there.  At least there is more bar seating.........."}
{"text":"Perfect service. Charlene was very warm and welcoming and she had a big smile on her face the whole time! Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"I still can't figure out why people love this place.  Food was below average in my opinion and priced very high.  The atmosphere is cool but that's the only thing they have going for them."}
{"text":"Very disappointing food quality. Three out of four diners were dissatisfied with their meal.will not return."}
{"text":"While I was extremely hesitant to post this it's amazing that this establishment is still doing what ever it is that they do. I had the worst service ever. We got the wrong food, which also came out cold and my burger came out moldy. I could care less about the food but the way management handled the situation was unreal.too bad there are no negative stars for unsafe food handling practices. Hope no one else gets sick."}
{"text":"Love the food here! The best time to go is during happy hour because the sushi is super cheap! Nice atmosphere and the staff is always great!"}
{"text":"Stopped in with my friend who had never been there. Sat down and never got waited on. One bald gentleman was very nice and kept checking on us and he was very busy. Finally our waiter came over. He had tattoos and I think his name was either Kyle or Tyler.  He was not very nice. We never even got water. My friend and I who was visiting from out of town looked at each other and decided to leave. I have never had such a bitchy waiter in my life. We went over to Cheesecake Factory and had great service and will never go back there. Terrible service."}
{"text":"I order for pick up. Pan seared tuna dry cooked medium rare. No rice. No bok choi. Substitute seasoned vegetables. This is what I got. You be the judge. Now I'm at lunch and have to get the correct order! So annoyed."}
{"text":"Great happy hour prices and food! The spicy fried tempura, margarita flatbread, Philadelphia roll, and avocado egg rolls are all things I tried on the HH menu and all delicious. There are tons of other items too. The drinks are great too and the HH menu has red sangria, beers and Moscow and Kentucky mules. I was there in a really large group of 15-20 and the waiter was attentive, friendly and  polite and didn't feel panicked by the large crowd. He had a great memory and remembered everyone's orders when the time came, making sure everyone got individual bills. Once the group got super large the food started coming out ridiculously late- one item I ordered didn't come at all and one came after 45 minutes. Both items showed up on my bill, but they took them right off without any hassle which I truly appreciate!"}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat in Vegas.  In a town full of buffets, and celeb hot spots, Kona Grill is my go-to restaurant.  While not the cheapest place, you certainly won't break the bank here either.  The service has always been good, and the food is consistently delicious.  My favorite dish is the pork tenderloin.  Never overcooked and the white cheddar mashed potatoes are scrumptious!  Tried the lemon grass crusted halibut this past visit and loved it.  Great texture and flavors.  I stop here every trip to Vegas, and would definitely recommend it to anyone!"}
{"text":"I usually have a great time at Kona Grill.  I went in last week with a group of  6 and the waiter we had on the patio was completely unprofessional.   We had a group of 6 people, so we pulled two tables together.  He had an attitude because we wouldn't just wait for the ONLY table that seats 6 to become available.  To add insult to injury, one of the appetizers we ordered had a strange taste, when we notified the waiter.....he argued with us.  He got the manager on staff and he also argued that we were incorrect and there was nothing wrong with the dish.  Based on this experience, I don't see myself going back to Kona anytime soon."}
{"text":"The staff here is nice and so is the food :-) happy hour on the balcony is tips and a decent price. If your looking to rub elbows with some interesting people while enjoying great cuisine give it a go!"}
{"text":"I love sitting on the patio for happy hour. The Lettuce wraps, Gouda fondo and sushi is awesome."}
{"text":"I don't know how else to say it the service was wonderful, the Caterpillar roll was almost too cute to eat.. ALMOST!! The service was wonderful.  I love their food .. will go back"}
{"text":"Eh. I really don't like this particular Kona Grill. It's in the mall which is convenient for shoppers, but the times I've gone the service was slow, I don't like the look of it, and it smells really bad inside. The menu is nothing special, just a mix of all sorts of different things. It's unoriginal. They have a sushi bar, and I have had the Rainbow Roll there which was okay, but I wouldn't recommend this to anyone at all."}
{"text":"All day happy hour on Sundays?! Chee!! Came by for lunch after work on Sunday and was pretty stoked to hear they had happy hour all day! You either have to sit at the bar or outside on the patio for the HH prices. Luckily, it was a nice sunny day so we sat outside.   The bf and I were craving sushi (although not the BEST place to come for sushi) -- their sushi was suffice. Ordered some salmon nigiri and spicy tuna roll. Also got the tuna nachos which was seared sliced ahi on fried wonton chips.. not what I expected but nonetheless delicious. Also, got a couple martinis and beers to wash it all down.  Service was overall mediocre.. Took us a while to even get a menu.   Overall, Kona Grill was enjoyable. Food was fine nothing spectacular. Just pretty cool they have HH on Sundays.."}
{"text":"We went for a friend's birthday party, with a large group of 9 people.  Of course, this makes service difficult, so I'm willing to cut the server some slack.  He didn't do a bad job..He gets 1 star for that.  Another 2 stars for the amazing appetizer! I would return just to have that sweet and spicy shrimp again.  3 starts in total so far...  I wouldn't get another entree there, though.  It's overpriced.      While the steak was cooked perfectly medium and juicy, there were no seasonings on it.  That was in direct contrast with the \"seasonal veggies\" which was just broccoli with 2 tiny pieces of what I think was eggplant...it didn't matter, because all I could taste was sesame seed.  I actually spit it back out. I've never done that before. I've also never left a large amount of food on my plate without requesting a to go box.  Waiter asked if I wanted one...I said no, told him I didn't like it because it was a bland steak and just not good.  He took the plate...no apology and no offer to make it right.  3/4 of that meal was thrown out and I still had to pay full price...$31! Plus the appetizer..my bill for just me...over $50.  1 star lost for the bad food and another lost for the lack of attention to my feedback about the quality of my meal.  Down to 1 star again.  The manager was rude. We called her over to discuss issues we had with our food...I wasn't the only one with substandard food at our table.  They served one party member old french fries and another item clearly sat under the heat lamps while the rest of our meals were finished. None of us felt she handled herself well under the circumstances.  That's 1 star lost...but that's 0 stars...and we can't give 0 starts on Yelp.  So I'll give another 1 star for the ambiance and another for the location...but take away another because the ladies room was gross.  That's 1 star.  I really want to give them more than 1 star, so let's give that amazing shrimp a 3rd star...it really was THAT good.  All in all, I may go back for happy hour sometime and have the shrimp and give this place another chance, but I'm not in a hurry.  I really wanted to like this place, but it was disappointing."}
{"text":"The Picasso roll is awesome. I have had it three times. I have also had the Cuban sandwich and it's great. The sweet potato fries that come with the Cuban are also good. This is a good restaurant at Chandler Mall and San Tan because it rarely has a wait."}
{"text":"This is a great place to meet friends and we are definitely fans of the happy hour at Kona Grill. Not to mention that happy hour is all day on Sundays!  I always get the sliders which consists of two large sliders and fries. It's a ton of food for the happy hour price. A lot of my friend's rave about the sushi. It's a fun atmosphere but can get a bit loud so I recommend sitting on the patio."}
{"text":"Awesome service, food was cooked to our special requirements and just scrumptious. great job Server, John, and Mgr. Brian. Great decor! Friendly staff and satisfied customers. We'll be back soon. Road weary travelers and shopping retreat!"}
{"text":"location, location, location  that is what most people think about Kona - but actually other than being in the mall; the location is horrible. It opens up to a fume infested patio rank with car exhaust. how clean is it to have car exhaust fumes settling onto your food?   most entrees are between $10 and $25  flashy place that is a good meeting place. Food is average at best.  We sat on the patio at a hi-top table and the service from some blonde was WAY BELOW responsive or even adequate. In fact, the patio was 60% full and she did not keep up at all and when she did show you some attention she showed actual contempt for her customers. sad - very sad. I sat for 12 minutes before she even approached me, I ordered a draft beer - she forgot it - I had to flag down another server to get my beer - then I was double billed  very frustrating experience on a night that was less than busy. I am sorry but Scottsdale is way to competitive to repeat at a place that really was average at best"}
{"text":"Every time I come here the service is excellent, the food is always good, and there's never any issues! The happy hour is awesome by the way!"}
{"text":"Kona grill is never a disappointment.  Sushi, the regular menu, the atmosphere.....  The staff is very friendly and the food is very good!  We like to create our own sushi dishes and the chef is always ready and willing!  I highly recommend Kona Grill for consistently good food!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour. I'm a vegetarian and they have delicious options for me. Sushi and egg rolls are my favorites!"}
{"text":"I ordered the beef bulgogi, Atlantic roll and spicy tuna . It was delicious EXCEPT for the Very SALTY BEEF BULGOGI TACOS.   Manager Nick was cordial about my input. Waitress  tried  to justify the SALTY BULGOGI TACOS By saying its \"Korean BBQ\" ! Really ??  Like I dont know what a good bulgogi would taste like. Other than that she was pleasant too.   Manager was gracious. I will try this Bolgogi Tacos  again next time because it might have been just this  batch of Bolgogi that was bad.   Cheers !"}
{"text":"Honestly we probably would not have come here because of the horrible atmosphere that is created by all the creeps renting fancy cars so they can park in front of kona and make women feel uncomfortable by the way they watch them. ( much like a dog watching a treat)....but it looked empty so it must have been too cold for them and we thought it was happy hour so we said why not?( we were hungry)... We sat down waited, waited, waited, (first sign we should have left) only had the happy hour menu so we figured it was happy hour ( there are no times posted on the menu and if no one is going to give you a different one then you would probably just assume).... Anyways started ordering food and he said oh it's not happy hour yet, (its about 9:35)okay we can see past that so we ordered chicken satay (way over priced for four tiny skewers) and the ahi tuna.... The tuna came out quick it was okay, but by the time the satay came out it was already into happy hour (AND the place was EMPTY)... So my friend started eating it, one bite in... RAW CHICKEN!... The waiter just cut off what we were saying and said \"I'll get it fixed\" no apology, no manager, no nothing... We didn't even want it then but because we didn't see him again until that came out another 30min later and we were hungry so we ate it (and it was totally burned on the outside, but again extremely hungry)... We are in the industry and we understand things happen but WOW... Time to pay we figure he was just being silent about the situation and it wouldn't be on the bill, but it was... So, we got no apology, no manager, potential food poisoning and/or salmonella, horrible service, and sub par food, all of which we paid for...there are so many great restaurants in Vegas and this is bottom of the barrel. Don't risk eating somewhere that doesn't care about your health and safety!!"}
{"text":"Not impressed. My wife and I have been here a few times for happy hour. Today my mini burgers were not seasoned at all. The fry portion was for a child. My wife bit into her pad thai and spit it out immediately. Went to alert management that they were serving inferior product. He could not be bothered. We asked for our money back and will not be visiting again."}
{"text":"I'm really disappointed :( my boyfriend and I had our first date here and have been back several times since then. However, when we went last weekend our experience was very disapointing. The dining room was pretty much empty, but it took our waitress forever to get us refills on water, and to bring us our check. We were handed paper menus, and when I asked why the new menu, the waitress told me that they were just trying new food items. However,  the truth was they RAISED THE PRICES.  We got 4 rolls, and an apitizer. I expected to pay around 50 dollars or so, as what we usually paid. And our check was 85 dollars!! And truth be told, the quality in the sushi went down. That is ridiculous for 2 people. Sad to say, but we will take our business elsewhere."}
{"text":"First time here.  Really enjoyed the HH specials.   So much to choose from!  It was so crowded upstairs but I guess that just means people like it here.  Will defiantly be back!   Great place to go after work and take a load off."}
{"text":"I was not impressed even a little with this place.  The sushi was bland, and the waitress was completely disinterested.  I felt like there was no personality in this place. We had the picassa, which was the only redeeming quality, the bama (it had no flavor) and the yamasa (terrible).  We also had the avocado eggrolls.  Those would have been tasty with a good dipping sauce but we received a very sweet sauce that did not help the flavor  and without a sauce they were very bland.   I would suggest going to the Blue Wasabi instead.  Not only is the food better but the customer service is awesome.  I will not be returning to this or any other kona grill."}
{"text":"Nice! I know it's been open for a while, for whatever reason, I never made it here for Happy Hour! What in the world was I thinking? What took so long? Hum...  The the Asian/Hawaiian theme, the food is on par with many of the places I've been to, without the stuffiness of a white table cloth place.   This is only for Happy Hour, so I can't really say very much for the al la cart portion of the menu. Great deals on the drinks and food. What I usually get is the sake bombs for 6.50 and some maki rolls for 3 bucks. For a dollar more, the beef sliders and tacos is pretty good for that price! The only thing I probably wouldn't get again is the calamari, just a bit too soggy and bland for my taste.   The vibe is pretty good, with a mixture of professionals and blue collar working stiffs like me.   The service is good, but like many busy places, it can get a little slow during prime time, i.e. 7-9pm.  But how can you complain when the value of the food and drink prices are this good?   Chow."}
{"text":"I was there last night, and sat outside.  The food was ok, service was friendly and everything was served in a timely fashion.  There were no salt and pepper shakers, except for the waitress to put pepper on with a peppermill, which makes me uncomfortable.  I like to have the option to do it myself, how often I want , without having someone on top of me, doing it.  I ordered a Margherita, and it came in a short thick men's glass, instead of a Margarita glass.  I am a woman, and it was too masculine for me, and ruined my Margherita experience.  My drink was watered down, and tasted like lime-aide.  Also, the music was too loud, and it was hard to have a conversation, and we went home with headaches. It seemed like the music was playing very loud inside, and we were hearing it loud outside.  I wouldn't be anxious to go there again, and will not recommend it to anyone else."}
{"text":"Happy hour food & prices are the best.  Just really really hard to find a table (no reso for HH). We ordered 2 frozen margaritas, 3 beers, lettuce wraps, fish tacos & spicy tuna roll for $35!!!  Wish they would turn music louder like at chandler location & it seems harder to get table here. Don't go at 6pm on a Friday- perhaps 5pm would have been easier.  There were people standing everywhere fighting for tables-kinda funny. But we are out in Gilbert & prices, food quality & atmosphere are pretty sweet so u guess that's to be expected.  A hostess sitting people from a list as they arrive  Would prob clear up the prob"}
{"text":"Stopped in hoping for a simple fresh, lone diner dinner after a day of shopping.  Hadn't been in some time and found the decor quite stark, and it was quiet in the restaurant.  Clearly a sushi place, I hoped for fresh cooked fish dinner, nice glass of wine.  Very cheerful server, patient with me, took my rather specific order, and I was served delicious simply prepared Salmon with wonderfully fresh garden green beans, off menu.  there were far more exciting offerings, the bar was busier and seemed cheerful.  I miss the scallops, and had hoped for sea bass.  Was impressed with server, and chef, wine never came from bar staff."}
{"text":"Madison A was our server today and she was amazing! She was so personable and very patient while we worked out figuring what I could eat with my food allergy. Our food was delicious and we will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"We stopped at Kona for lunch on our way from Carefree to Scottsdale.  Weird menu, everything from sushi to flatbread pizza.  We were underwhelmed by the food but service was friendly and attentive.  Would not recommend if you're into good food."}
{"text":"Not sure how others can rate this a five star restaurant.  Even in it's better days I would only rate it a three.  I guess its what you are comparing it to.  We have been going here here for nearly three years and up until our last visit have been happy with the food and services.  Our last visit will be our last.  Food was not what we had been getting in the past, pork dish was totally different and salty.  Manager did not respond to our concerns and only through our server offered a free desert.  We refused and paid full price for the meal that we did not eat.  This restaurant has quickly fallen out of favor and I am sure we are not the only ones feeling this way when you look at the amount of people eating here.  The only way they can get anyone in the door is by offering a discounted price for drinks an appetizers in the bar."}
{"text":"The food was good and the prices are reasonable. We got 6 rolls, edemame, a large draft beer and 2 deserts for less than $70. The deserts were huge! I ordered the key lime pie and my husband ordered a brownie. I could only eat about a third of my pie. The dining room was pretty empty for 5:00 on a Saturday. It was happy hour, but only in the bar and outdoor area. That was packed. I guess having a super crowed bar is more important to them than a full restaurant."}
{"text":"I've been going to Kona grill for quite some time and as always a great experience,but I was very disappointed because they removed my favorite dish basil,pesto linguine from the menu.Please put it back on the menu....."}
{"text":"happy hour from 3-7.. and reverse happy hour 9-11 (m-th only though). Appetizers, pizzas and sushis half off, plus drinks. My suggestion, stay away from the calamari. I wasn't a big fan of it mainly because it tasted like starch... blech. Bbq chicken pizza wasn't too bad, though maybe a bit too tangy for my taste. Spicy tuna roll was alright, but what's up with the dot of wasabi? There was no wasabi on that plate...  If you eat outside, you can see all the nice cars pulling up to the valet, but that's about it. Overall, good pricing, atmosphere was ok, service wasn't too bad. However, I have to say it's nothing out of the ordinary."}
{"text":"Happy hour, cool atmosphere. They have the best strawberrie mojito. Very convenient with outside sitting.. Nice place to get away from the strip."}
{"text":"Stopped by with a group after work for a week-ending celebratory happy hour.  We sat in the nearly-empty restaurant area rather than in the rather crowded bar or either crowded patio.  We were advised that the happy hour specials were only honored in the bar area; at least they were upfront.  As our group slowly filtered in we enjoyed drinks and appetizers, but mostly the company.  The starters were followed up by a variety of mains and sushi and finally a few desserts.  The food quality seemed to vary quite a bit from dish to dish.  Some were better than others, but nothing was spectacular.  The service matched; good but not spectacular.    Overall, the experience wasn't memorable; much like my last visit to a Kona Grill (Scottsdale Fashion Square) many, many years ago (which I honestly don't remember).  Appetized the eyes, but not the palate."}
{"text":"I had sushi and a couple of drinks here last night, Valentine's Day and the ladies working behind the bar were amazing. Fast friendly service."}
{"text":"Just left. Sat waiting for service for 20 min and had no one look out general direction. Mid day, not busy, no reason to not be at least greeted. We went to Ra next door and we're sat and served drinks within 5 min!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome. Wife had the salmon and I had the ribeye. Servings were generous and our server even split the soup for both of us. Excellent service. I hope you open the CA branch soon."}
{"text":"Kona grill has to be the spot. Visiting Vegas from New York brings a welcome of awesome food great service and total enjoyment of the time at this great eatery. Ask for Shawn as your server she is the best there... That is one girl who earns her 20 percent  and then some. Ty Shawn."}
{"text":"I must compliment on the management team of Kona Grill, they certainly do care about customer satisfaction by following up with me.   I went back to a 2nd visit 2 weeks ago for a team lunch and found both the service and food were very good. Everyone in the team (6 of us) like their dishes and had a good time at Kona Grill.  We ordered a variety of dishes from Salmon to Salad to Pasta... everyone is happy :)   Maybe it was a miss of what I ordered last time but seem in general they do hold up their quality."}
{"text":"I come here a lot.  Food is always good.  Had the Kona chopped salad,  yellow tail,  crab crunch roll and angry soybeans.  Everything was delicious and came out perfect.  Great atmosphere.  The staff is always friendly.  Bethany was the bartender and she was awesome.  She was fun, friendly and very attentive.  I highly recommend this place and location."}
{"text":"Excellent dinner for four. Excellent service from Leslie. We appreciated her attention to detail.    We made our reservation on OpenTable. We were seated as soon as we walked in.   The Sea Bass was incredible.   We all agree that we will be back again."}
{"text":"\"Reverse Happy Hour\" (3-7) food is great, location couldnt be better."}
{"text":"Excellent sushi. It was very fresh and flavorful. Service was a bit lacking, but the manager made up for it when he made his rounds to ask how our meal was. Very nice wine service, desert selection and food choices for those who do not want sushi. The beef skewers were also great as was the house salad. I would return."}
{"text":"I usually order from the happy hour menu.  My favorites are the spicy tuna roll and the yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno.  The fish has been super fresh every time I went.  The prices are decent, especially with the happy hour discount.  Not much to say about the decor.  The inside seating is comfortable and not as tacky as typical mall joints.  The patio is always packed so go early on busy nights."}
{"text":"Food came out relatively fast and the service was good.  Battered fried calamari was horrible. Totally missed this time. Tasted like undercooked flour. It was surprising bc I really liked this dish last time. What happened to the chef that cooked the last time :(  BBQ chicken pizza was okay but not as good as I remembered.  Atlantic Roll (salmon wrapped in rice and topped with tempura flakes and eel sauce) was pretty good.  Sweet and sour shrimp was amazing. It was served in a crunchy shell which I enjoyed munching on w/ the flavorful sauces of the shrimp."}
{"text":"Horrible experience.  Ordered chicken satay kids meals for our kids.  Chicken was not well cooked or well seasoned.  Fruit was past its prime.   And the white rice was soft and overcooked.  (How do you screw up white rice?!?).  My pad Thai was mediocre.  Only modestly bright spot was that my wife said her sushi rolls were \"decent\".  But the worst part of dinner was the service.  We finished our meal and waited 20 minutes for our waiter before I gave up and went to the hostess.   It was another 10 minutes before I got my check.  Our waiter finally came by and mumbled a half-hearted apology and then walked away looking annoyed.  In the words of my 7 year old: \"this restaurant is terrible.\"  We won't be back."}
{"text":"Great food and do a mean miso soup if u go for the sushi! Everything else I have had here is good too but they do a better job on there sushi"}
{"text":"Ok, let me tell you that I have been going to multiple Kona grill locations for many years now, and this is the first time I have had negative things to say.  I go there to have sushi and saki bombers especially when the weather is nice.  I like the seating and the feel of the restaurant.  Typically, I get good service.    The most recent outing to Kona was a let down.  Usually, the sushi quality is average.  On this occasion, I was given mostly rice balls with no filling in the center.  These were the smallest \"sushi rolls\" I have ever seen.  To compliment the sushi I was served my saki and beer in dirty glasses.  The saki shot glass looked like it had black mold at the bottom, and the pitcher had hard food stuck on it.  My glass was similarly disgusting.  I refused my saki shot glass and received another equally moldy one as a replacement.  I eventually just wiped it out with my napkin and proceeded to drink away my cares.  **An update:  Kona management contacted me and assured me that they take this feedback seriously.  They have talked with the staff and taken steps to try to avoid this happening again in the future.  ***I visited Kona again, and this time everything had been corrected.  The dishes were clean, the food was good, and the service was good!"}
{"text":"Went in to Kona this past Saturday night April 27  8:00ish it was unbelievably empty in there (very unusual). We wondered if we missed a memo sent out about Kona. However it was very good as usual"}
{"text":"The Scottsdale Kona Grill has always been a favorite of ours, so we were surprised by an unpleasant incident at the Chandler restaurant today.  We approached the Hostess' desk at lunchtime and, although the hostess clearly saw us, she was unable to even greet us, because 2 or 3 very self-important managers were engaged in some sort of discussion, right there behind the desk. They went on and on, ignoring us, keeping us waiting for a remarkable amount of time, and making us feel as if we, and our business, were simply too unimportant to even notice. We very nearly left, thoroughly disgusted.  Having told the hostess (who was clearly not at fault) that the incident had very nearly cost Kona Grill 2 customers, stuff obviously began to hit some fan. Our lunch was interrupted a number of times by managers, apologizing, but also trying to kiss up to us in ways that were excessive, intrusive and, finally, really just annoying.  The food was excellent, as was our server, and we were given an unasked-for 25% discount on our bill, but the entire experience wrecked what was supposed to have been a quiet, easy-going, husband-and-wife treat, a special \"date.\"  So we would caution others that the management of this particular Kona Grill is not at all up to the same standard as the restaurant in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Went here with my girlfriend on happy hour and I was very impressed. The food was delicious and fresh, and the deals during happy hour make it very cheap. The interior is very nice, clean and modern. I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Gee, the Happy Hour Menu looked amazing - Sushi Roll descriptions and Prices...  It's a shame the taste was just average.  A bunch of better options on Spring Mountain."}
{"text":"It was our first time last night  My wife and I love it sushi was good, food was tasty,  great customer service Angela was really nice  and knows about taking care of the customers."}
{"text":"Not a good experience. My boyfriend had the spicy tuna and fiery shrimp rolls and he is now sick. We told the server that the sushi didn't taste right and I called the restaurant tonight to let them know that he got sick so others wouldn't get sick too. When I spoke with one of the managers there she was dismissive and rude to me. She said there was no way he got sick from the sushi even though our server said the sushi looked strange tonight as well! Because of the manager's rudeness and the food poisoning we will NOT be going here again. I'm surprised by management's combative nature in dealing with customers at this establishment. Not a way to treat your customers that's for sure. If she would have handled it differently and been polite I would not be writing this review right now."}
{"text":"I visited here for sunday happy hour with my husband. we sat at a table at the bar and a table was sticky. I wasn't sure it is because of weather but menus or anything I touch felt sticky. We ordered two happy hour rolls,sea bass entree and sake sangria and margarita. all the food came out pretty quick. The rice of rolls were too packed when they roll, and it was so much rice. No taste but just pack of rice. sea bass was okay but sides were really oily. Sake sangria and margarita were too sweet as well."}
{"text":"Wish I could give a negative 5 stars! The general manager Eric Christiansen is arrogant and should not work with the public.  We arrived at 3pm on Friday. We asked if an exception could be made so we could sit at a low top table as my 82 year old mother could not get into the higher chairs. He basically said no and and said we could sit outside on the patio. When I asked    If there was shade or misters he said he didn't know \"cause I haven't been out there\" and turned to walk away with a \"have a nice day\".  Disrespectful jerk! I don't care how could the food and drink is here. Avoid this place - I bet he treats his mother and wife this crap to! There are tons of other places to patronize that offer respectful service!"}
{"text":"I didn't go during happy hour... I knew I wouldn't be able to find seating.  I went for lunch. Had fried calamari in a creamy spicy/zesty sauce which was surprisingly good.  Entree: Pad thai. Its aright, a lil too soy saucey/ awkward teriyaki for my taste  ~*I give it a four stars for the calamari (look for it during happy hour. get there early at 3 PM)*~"}
{"text":"i like this place... the saki bomb.. is great with sushi!! happy hour an the environment is great... good service an good people.. an u welll have a great time... go on a weekend... i recommend it...!!"}

{"text":"MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE SPOT TO EAT AND DRINK DURING THE DAY!! The atmosphere is so fun! Great happy hour prices, great service, strong drinks, delicious food..what else can I say?!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to Kona Grill for a while now. Servers and managers are always very accommodating. The voodoo roll is my favorite! Definitely recommend it. I usually go to the summerlin location but as we all know it is temporary closed.. They are both great locations with excellent service. BEWARE of the margaritas at Kona Grill! They are very strong and addicting! My friends and I always stop by here before the club to pre game. Great atmosphere! Love it."}
{"text":"Shadi Zaki was most accommoding, and friendly. The service was outstanding.  The food was excellent and hot when served. We will be back. Thank you Shadi, the lady from VT."}
{"text":"ALWAYS very consistent. Food is ALWAYS good.. but lately I have noticed that with the new management and chef.. the service has been a little slow. I highly recommend the Macadamia Nut Chicken! So yummy!"}
{"text":"Sushi is decent, but service is very slow. Restaurant was not that busy to make patrons wait so long for drinks and then for sushi and then to pay the check. Managers running around doing everything except making sure good customer service is happening. A miss for me."}
{"text":"Ate at Kona yesterday after a long time away and first time after the remodeling. If I could give 5 stars for anything it would be the service. Our server was awesome and extremely attentive. I would also give 5 stars to the decorator, great job on the remodeling. Where Kona grill is failing is the food, the food is bland, the sushi rolls are just okay.  The ambiance is great at Kona grill, but I can't taste ambiance. PS: at least one of your floor managers seemed a little tyrannical,  ease up on the servers.  They are great people."}
{"text":"I'm writing this as I sit at the bar . We have come here several times and never experienced  the Wrath that is angry girl bartender Sonia. She's a red head, in her 20's and does indeed have teeth.... surprisingly enough when she smiles at the customers she actually chooses to like.  Not sure what the beef is today except that we moved from a high top table to the bar within 10 minutes of our visit. We came here to pig out and watch the game,( Go Cards) but after we moved to the bar we were ignored! What's the deal.... .? I'm a former waitress, bartender, worked in the industry for more years than I can count and as far as I'm aware servers tip out the bar. So Sonia what is the deal?, why are we ignored, disregarded, shot evil girl looks in our direction, left with empty water, dirty plates, etc.... You're behaving in a non professional way and as though we did something personal we're not aware of. Did we steal your first boyfriend? WhAt is the deal?   We had to speak to the manager, Peter who addressed our concerns whole heartedly and remedied the situation and addressed our concerns.  So in summation: Sonia needs a hug. We like to pig out and watch football. We leave 20% when we receive service. Peter the manager is nice. the food at Kona is good. There's no \"I\" in team... Sonia I'm talking to you!  The End."}
{"text":"The food was good but absolutely the worst service imaginable. A couple of us never received our food. The waiter did not check on us at all. Our drinks did not get refilled.. Not at all. We asked for the manager and waited over 10 minutes for him to make it to our table"}
{"text":"After taking the girls shopping at the mall we decided to try Kona Grill. The menu had a wide selection of food to satisfy everyones taste. We ordered the basil pesto linguine, the chefs salad and various sushi. The wait time on the food was a little long for the amount of business they had. The flavor of the dishes were average with nothing standing out.  Typical mall restaurant, average food for above average prices. I dont know why I was expecting anything different."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful time during HH! Our server Jacob did a wonderful job serving us- he's the BEST :) we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"***Updated Review*** Thank you Jose for your reply, and I also feel sorry about my experience at Kona. My intention to write the original review was to find out if this practice was taking place under the management 's disregard, and presumably by what you meant by having a diverse work environment, I should conclude my concern was borrowed. However, I wanted to address I brought up this question because it is true that Asian tourists do not share the same culture as Americans do, which may frustrate the servers at times. Some restaurants on the strip encourage them to tip by displaying a little sign next to the checkbook holder, which consists of 4-5 different Asian languages. So to be honest, I am not really getting what you meant by \"nationality issue,\" unless you intended to categorize Asians as a single national. Furthermore, I bet you had an adequate conversation with your staffs about the addressed issue before you commented here, but I still wonder how having staffs of 20 different nationalities can assure you that the service given by a particular individual was free of any issue. An Asian American who is an American national may choose to provide a bad service to Asian customers due to the listed reason. Here, I am not implying that my server's behavior was based on her racial prejudice or anything, but your comment does not seem to be a satisfactory explanation of the incidence. Instead, I am getting a much more reasonable answer from fellow yelpers than from your comment as you can clearly see, several customers of different ethnicities have attested to the worst service of life at Kona Fashion show as I did. Nonetheless, I admit I have made a hasty judgement on this matter and also want to clarify that my experience/opinion does not reflect or represent the management's stance as a whole. Hope this review would benefit future visitors for their best.  *** Original Review Visited here on 3/31/17 with my boyfriend, and as vegas locals it was first time we visited fashion show location. It was rare to see high ratings at restaurantes located on the strip so our expextation was high. We were sitted after five minutes of waiting until the hostess showed up from somewhere but had to wait even longer until our waitress finally decided to take our drinks. The restaurant was half filled, and seeing that other customers food had already been served got us wonder why the service was super slow but we were okay because my boyfriend is in FB industry, and we have a lot of other friends that are as well. We are really generous about mistakes and have never been peculiar customers. We ordered the ones in the picture as appetizers, jambalaya, and two sushi rolls. After appetizers, we had to wait for 20 minutes with no one checking on our table. My boyfriend's water and my iced tea had been empty for a while, but they were not taken care of until jambalya was served. I was seating there expecting my rolls to be served soon. We waited so long by ourselves until the server decided to show up and asked us for any dessert. My boyfriend gently reminded her that we were still waiting for our sushi, and she just blatantly replied oh! Excuse me? No apology or anything. She did not even seem regretful or apologetic. She then went over to POS machine which I though she was checking on if our orders were made correctly, but turned out just spending time there minding her own business (she was not in the middle of helping any other customer)  . Like I said, we always do our best to avoid a commotion or anything so waited for our sushi rolls for another god knows how many minutes that finally had us realize our waitress did not have any intention to make up. We then waited her to ask for a check and canceling on our sushi orders but she never came back to our table. We ended up grabbing a different server and asked him for a check and a pen to write these which obviously got him wonder if we wanted to pay with a card. Oh well, that being said, we were not able to leave any tip because at this last moment, our waitress was only directing this other server to deliver our check and refusing to check on us. Considering our tip had never been under 20%, this incident was beyond shocking to us. I had a chance to talk to one of my friends the other day, and she carefully suggested that some servers choose not take care of Asian tables because they are not familiar with tipping, and I should have talked to the manager if that was the case. We have been really curious why the server chose to act like that and did not try to think about it much. But I could not help but leave this review for our first and will be the last visit because I swear to god I do not want to believe, but kind of start to wonder if that was really the case. Thanks"}
{"text":"When the weather gets nice everybody always wants to go sit outside on a patio and have a couple of drinks.  There isn't a better place in town for good drinks and food at a good price!! Great Happy Hour Also!!!"}
{"text":"I went today to meet my daughter for lunch.  We are both big sushi enthusiasts.  The interior and atmosphere was beautiful.  Well appointed. The service was excellent.  We ordered edamame, was good...nothing to rave about.  Not much you can do to mess that up.  Drinks were well poured but exspensive for what you got.  Ordered five different sushi rolls. All five were bland, not much flavor and stale.  The fish was not fresh. Paid $12 for a soft shell crap roll and it tasted days old.  Will not go back. Did here they have good pizza and a happy hour at three.  My daughter says to give it another try.  We'll see... I'll let you know if I do."}
{"text":"I'm a creature of habit and pretty much always get the Macadamia Nut Chicken, which is beyond awesome.  The sauce on the chicken is awesome and the mashed potatoes are really good too.  Service is hit or miss, sometimes they have an attitude problem lol."}
{"text":"This Kona has a new phenomenal waitress her name is Day.  She was super attentive and very personable. She won't leave you hanging"}
{"text":"Good American sushi. I don't really order anything else here. Been going here for years. Only to get the sushi. Service is fantastic. Great place to go bring work people or even have a work lunch if you need it. It's inside a little shopping center in Boca Park, a part of the Summerlin suburb in Vegas. Summerlin is not a city. Are you from Summerlin? You're the only one who thinks it's a city. Prices are pretty fair here. They are very quick, friendly, and helpful. For the cost, you're getting some upscale treatment. Grab a rainbow roll and enjoy!"}
{"text":"We love coming here for happy hour! Good food and drinks (except for they got rid of the delicious white sangria and replaced it with something not so awesome). It is a fun atmosphere and they have a couple of big TVs in the bar for watching games. The sushi is always fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"Disappointing. The food was so bland and overpriced for such mediocrity.  It's a shame. This place used to be really good and had drool-worthy burgers among other things. Not any more. They've redone their menu; maybe it's a new chef or different management. I didn't bother asking.   They say hunger is the best condiment, but it didn't help my food at all. It neither tasted bad nor good. Very unsatisfying."}
{"text":"Be careful when you go to Kona.  My girlfriend and i went on a Saturday afternoon.  The waitress was soooo nice.  Too bad she has to work with horrible people.  After my cousins pycho ex girlfriend (who apperently is a waitress there.) spotted us she had the manager kick us out saying she has a restraining order against me!  Total lie.  I hardly even know this girl except for the horror stories that i have heard.  Whats even worse is the the \"manager\" actually did it.  Cant comment on the food considering we got kicked out before it came to the table.  Yikes!  hopefully there isnt any imaginary restraining orders on future guests that go in there."}
{"text":"I probably should have only given this Kona 3 stars but I'm feeling generous today and I think our server \"Zack, Zach he's a Lego maniac\" deserves the extra star as he was attentative and a on top of everything. I like the food but I really can't get over the prices for some of the stuff they serve on there. I'm not a cheapskate, but c'mon. $17 for pasta? During lunch? Get over yourself Kona Grill. You're just a trendy name. I'll still probably go back though. It seems I never get to pick where we eat lunch. Ha ha."}
{"text":"Can't beat the Happy Hour prices! Nice selection on rolls and even one sashimi menu item (delicious).. My personal favorite is the strawberry margarita with sugar on the rim.. This place can get extremely busy. Wait staff is very friendly and courteous. One of our favorite places to go to in the North Scottsdale/Phoenix area."}
{"text":"We didn't even get to order food because the bartender ignored us. We didn't get her name either, all we got were to happy hour margaritas that were pre made. Not coming back."}
{"text":"Okay.... update!  District Manager, Sean just called me.... like a little \"better late than never\" gift full of validation, accountability and apologies.  He was very nice and offered me many options.  After explaining that we have already now made other plans, he offered to send me gift cards, which I gratefully accepted.  Love it when a wrong is made right....thanks, Sean!"}
{"text":"Kona Grill's sushi is comparable to the sushi that is available in grocery stores.  Which is terrible. For some seriously incredible sushi try Hiro or Yasu.  Kona Grill is best for Happy Hour finger foods and cocktails."}
{"text":"Great menu choices. Sea bass was amazing and Bulgogi flatbread killed. Went back next day to have it again. Server Caitlyn was outstanding, best we've had in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Consistent great food and service.  Tonight, Bob, the Manager, and Craig, our server, provided excellent, personal customer service.  Try the meatloaf!"}
{"text":"I would give no stars, if I could.  Kona Grill - you should be ashamed of yourself!  There is no excuse for what happened to me.  I made a reservation on Open Table for 4 this past Saturday night.  In the reservation I  clearly made a note stating that I had a small service dog that needed to sit next to me - I also noted we were celebrating a birthday! If they had a problem they should have contacted me ahead of time!   When I arrived I was told we could only sit outside ( in 114 degrees!) with my service dog!  When I explained we were allowed by law to sit inside, they then told me ok but he had to sit on the floor.  He is small, so needs to be by my hands for my condition.  I always carry a mat with me, so he is not sitting on furniture.  I was told it wasn't possible.  The GM gave me a gift certificate to come back, but I told him that if he couldn't  accommodate my needs, I wouldn't be coming back.   I have been to the finest restaurants in Phoenix and this has never  happened before.  Not only was I upset and humiliated, my friends birthday dinner was ruined."}
{"text":"I made a Yelp just to come do a review for the \"new\" Kona Grill. First off the remodel is great however I feel like much tables could be added when I went into the restaurant is was extremely busy and every table was taken. Even the bar and sushi bar was full. The host staff was not very helpful. There is clearly all new staff there including management. They should really work on who they hire because I continuously saw a lady manager being rude to her employees and even some tables. I sure wouldn't want to work for her it made us extremely uncomfortable. Besides that we finally found a table and enjoyed happy hour. I would have given this review 2 stars but it earned 3 since our server was very attentive."}
{"text":"I made a reservation  for me and my wife for her birthday? And I am so glad I  did. The night was fantastic starting with the great server we had . He was very knowledgeable about the menu and even suggest  a few of his favorite things .  Now to  the food it was the best sushi I have had in a very long time . And the pad Tai noodles with chicken and shrimp was really good as well . So I would go back and try all the different  and great things on the menu again and again."}
{"text":"Cool place to hang out, should let dogs on patio. I would have given them 5 stars but they took away the tacos on the menu! Many people are not happy about this! Dog rule is silly!!!"}
{"text":"Food and drink is great. I highly recommend their lobster mac and cheese!  I do not recommend bringing a party larger than 4. They play techno music over speakers making it impossible to have a conversation. They also had a hard time prioritizing small requests....like a to go box that took 30 minutes to get, or any drink refills."}
{"text":"Kona Grill has two different atmospheres: Inside, it is a classy, yet casual, relaxing place to have great food. Outside on the patio or in the bar, it is a great place for socializing during their great happy hour.   The location is great, right in the mall. And their service is very good. I had their goat cheese pizza and it was marvelous. Their sushi, not so good, but decent when you're looking for $3 rolls for happy hour.   I recommend Kona Grill if you're looking to socialize at their bar with friends, or looking to relax in a booth after a long day of shopping."}
{"text":"Craig was our server today 7-19   I had never been to Kona grill before but he showed me some great things to eat. He let me know it was happy hour and the items we had decided we're half off in the bar or sushi bar area. He moved us over there and continued to serve us. We ended up choosing the cheeseburger sliders, shrimp tacos, potstickers and some cheese fondue with apples.   It was amazing and a very inexpensive meal. He was quick and our food was out just as fast. Great Sunday meal. Craig was amazing definitely takes care of his customers."}
{"text":"I came to Kona Grill especially for their ahi tuna crisps... Then I was told it's no longer on the menu. I am very sad about this it was my very favorite thing on the menu. I liked it so much many times I would eat two plates of it. Light tasty and wonderful... Please put it back on the menu every time I come to Kona Grill I always hear people trying to order ahi tuna crisps..."}
{"text":"My partner and I came for a Saturday afternoon lunch during happy hour. Plenty of options included for the happy hour, many of them half priced. We split the beef bulgogi tacos and the Gouda fondue. Both good and flavourful. Would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"OMG!! The food here was absolutely DELICIOUS!!! The Hostess and the Servers were exceptional!! We were a party of 7 and our Server was extremely attentive. The atmosphere was warm and welcoming. We WILL be back!! Thank you, Kona Grill!!"}
{"text":"Loved Happy Hour with my Hubby! Sushi rolls half off?! Yes please! Staff really friendly, the music and atmosphere was great, definitely going again!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour, not so great dining room experience.  If you are looking to have a drink and some reasonable priced apps in a fun Boca Park environment, swing thru during happy hour.  Reasonable prices, and pretty good food.  All I could notice in the dining room was a musty carpet smell. Oh well, the bar area and the patio are where all the fun is at.  Swing by with some co-workers after a long week to have some drinks and people watch from the patio."}
{"text":"I wish there was an option for less than 1 star for this restaurant, but there isn't. Tonight my wife and I met family at Kona Grill for dinner. The server sat us and apologized for being short- staffed in the kitchen. We were told that our orders might take longer than normally expected to arrive.  The front of the house was very packed with customers. However, when I went to use the restroom, I noticed that at least half the house was empty...? They had seated customers in the front to give the illusion of a full house-- when in reality they were about half full.  It took for..ev..er for waters and drinks to arrive. I am not sure how being short in the kitchen would effect the ability of barbacks to run drinks in a half-full room . It took us about twenty minutes for them to finally arrive. I am sure it must have been fancy water for it to have taken so long.  The part that chaps my hide however, was not the failure to bring water. It was that our food orders arrived grossly staggered. We waited nearly one hour for things to *begin* arriving. Two of our party received meals while the rest of us waited. My 90 year-old grandmother waited too patiently for a meatloaf while my wife sat in front of a plate of awful, dried out sushi for what felt like an eternity-- hoping someone else's food would show up. It was a little uncomfortable to sit there waiting. Another twenty minutes passed between the arrival of the first and last dishes.   The sushi was an affrontery-- for reals. It arrived looking somewhat dried out and the fish was not moist-- it was tacky. How long had it been sitting before the hapless server wandered back to bring it up? Who knows. Eww. I wouldn't have eaten it but my wife decided to give it a whirl. I hope she doesn't spend that night in the bathroom. I'm completely serious about this worry. Alternatively, my lobster mac and cheese was alright.  The final blow to any sort of compensating for crappy service and icky food was when the server brought back my grandmother's leftovers after boxing them up. For some reason, he thought it a good idea to set her left overs ON THE FLOOR next to her. On the restaurant floor amidst crumbs, tromped in and unrecognizable wet former food items, whatever is on the bottom of peoples shoes and who knows what other delightful utter grossness. WTF?  The prices were too high for this much negligence. I'll not be back, nor will I recommend this place to anyone else. Not even people who deserve misguidance out of spite.   Thanks for reading this true life adventure."}
{"text":"Love Kona! Bar and cocktail service is always great. Rolls are awesome. Happy hour is great. Awesome patio. The only thing is sometimes it's a little busy and you have wait for a seat, but clearly means they're doing something right! Reverse HH is my fav, all the great deals and less crowded."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant. There Happy Hour food and drinks are very good, plus the price is just right. I'm here every chance I get."}
{"text":"I have been going to Kona locations for years, this experience makes me wonder if I will ever be back. To start it didn't feel like the air conditioning was on, but we found a bar table pretty quickly.  Our server approached pretty quickly and took our drink order.  He didn't seem to be on top of his game, but still was attentive at first.  We ordered two cocktails that were wildly under poured.  We didn't bother to order any more.  Not that it would have been possible because our server apparently our server had tables all over the restaurant. We finally ordered and then waited 45 minutes for our food.  The restaurant was not busy and we were two of ten people in the bar area. The food was cold and pretty devoid of taste for Pad Thai.  I didn't finish the meal.  We decided that we should just call the experience bad and get our bill. We waited 10 minutes for our waiter to check back and another 15 for him to bring our check. I am shocked at the quality at this Kona."}
{"text":"Went on a date to this location. It was appealing inside, but very loud and poorly lit. I had orderd the lemon garlic shrimp penne. This dish had an over abundancy of hot chili pepper in it. Whew! It was very over powering. The creme brulee was interesting. It had a lemon zest note, so it was ok. It lacked richness. And the cafe latte was nothing special. Just a coffee with foamed cream. All in all. For the price of the menu, I would expect a higher end of food prepared."}
{"text":"This new location is great and best happy hour in town! Thanks for opening up a location in the quarter!"}
{"text":"Had a great experience a few nights ago, sat on the patio enjoying the weather.  There were a few rude customers arguing over a shade, but the manager handled the situation with professionalism.  She even came over to our table and made sure we were good.  The food was amazing as usual and our service was stellar."}
{"text":"Good food and good atmosphere! They have a menu with a lot of options and are kid friendly for the most part l. It's perfect for the area around desert ridge and it's nice to just grab a drink as well."}
{"text":"I love this spot. They have some of the BEST sushi, and the Happy Hour drink/food menu is hard to beat. There's always a good crowd, and we've never had any issues with the service. Nice spot to grab a light dinner - and I recommend the Saki Sangria!"}
{"text":"I went to Kona Grill for the first time this past weekend, after having it recommended to me MANY times.  I have to say I was a bit disappointed.  Maybe because of all the hype.  The food was pretty good (I had the chopped salad with macadamia nut crusted chicken), but not great.  We also ordered a sushi roll to share as an appetizer, and that was good.  The three others in my party all said their entrees were \"good,\" too... but no one was raving about any of it.  Our desserts were GIANT and tasted good.  The really bad part of our experience, was definitely our flaky waiter.  As I said, we ordered our sushi as an appetizer... and he even asked if we wanted it before our entrees and we said yes... but after waiting a long time (probably about 20 minutes), our roll came at the same time as our entrees.  Then after we ate our entrees, we sat and sat and sat and sat, waiting for the dessert menu.  After about 20 minutes of not seeing our waiter at all (not even at tables around us), we finally asked a busser if he could find our waiter.  We watched the busser look for him all around the kitchen and the dining room.  I'm not sure where our waiter was hiding, but it took another five minutes just to find him.  When he finally did show up, he gave us our bill without even bringing the dessert menu.  He took the bill back and finally brought us a dessert menu, and we asked him what he recommended.  He said \"let's be honest... I'm gonna tell you everything on the menu is good.\"  Umm... ok.  So I don't really want to judge the restaurant on this really bad waiter... because I am sure not EVERY waiter there is that awful... but with so many other great places to eat in town, we definitely won't be going back any time soon."}
{"text":"My fav sushi spot in Vegas. You gotta try their angry edamame, coconut mojitos and surf and turf sushi."}
{"text":"Great happy hour! Sushi chefs were entertaining"}
{"text":"It was our first time dining with my son at Kona just because we didn't know if they can accommodate my son's food allergy restrictions.  My husband called first to find out and were told by manager Shadi (not sure with spelling) that the kitchen should be able to cook a kid's meal that is safe for him and told us to ask for him when we get there, which we did.  Shadi came to our table and assured us that they can make my son's salmon kid's meal allergy free.  Shadi even brought my son's food himself.  We had a wonderful dinner as a family.  Thank you Shadi!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend & I decided to try this place out after they recently remodeled. We walked in and was lazily greeted by a young boy who looked bored as shit with his job. He asked us how many then told us he would go look for a table for us? Came back and said we had to sit outside or at the sushi bar. We decided outside even though it was cold. We were directed outside and had to find our own seat after about ten minutes someone finally came up to us and asked to take our drinks then cut us off and asked if we were 21. We aren't so she told us we couldn't sit there and she would show us to the sushi bar the only place we could sit? Then we were walked over there where all the spots were full of dirty dishes and unpicked up tips so we just left. Terrible service and they were offensive. They treated us like we were 12 which we are 18 and look and act much older. Give me the same respect as everyone else."}
{"text":"This was a great dinning experience food was fab. Great service . cooks wore gloves friendly staff..Manager was the nicest man.. We will be back."}
{"text":"We initially came under the impression that HH was all day on Sundays. Bummer to find out that that is only extended at the Chandler and Scottsdale locations only. Not an issue, therefore my review is not based on that.   Service (5): Danny was awesome and honest. He told us what was good, bad, and iffy. Although I don't know him personally, he appeared very honest and knowledgeable about the menu, which is a huge plus. It is extremely important that servers are familiar with the menu items.  Danny continuously came back to check on us, which was much appreciated.  Environment/Vibe (3): For the location, my expectations were set higher. I would've expected the bar area to have larger t.v.'s; that area (including) outside is larger than most. They definitely could benefit from larger screens; especially when they tend to have games on.  Food (4): We ordered 5 rolls: - Sunshine  - Shrimp Tempura - Shrimp & Lobster - (2) King Crab  All pretty decent. The avocado was fresh (super plus); over ripe avocado is not tasty in sushi.   Drinks (4): My Moscow Mules were decent; sent first one back because the ginger beer was flat. But, replacement and 2nd round were delish. The parental unit ordered  Chambord Margarita; must've been good cuz she had another round.   Overall, everything was decent. Food was a tad bit pricey for not being a standalone establishment (total bill before tip was $135). I may try again as there were other 'non-sushi' items on the menu that caught my eye."}
{"text":"Seriously, their happy hour prices can't be beat.  A beer, a spicy tuna roll, calamari and avocado egg roll for under $20 including tip.  Service was attentive and friendly.  We had to lurk around the bar area for awhile to get a table, but that only speaks to how popular this place is.  If you are looking for an inexpensive dinner out that doesn't involve Denny's or Olive Garden this is a great choice."}
{"text":"Been here twice, food is pretty tasty, but a bit pricy.  I came here with some friends after watching a movie from the Harkins nearby.  Got the stir fry chicken dish ($16).  The dish was tasty, a bit spicy, and you can taste the hoisen sauce base per the flavor.  The ingredients seemed fresh. I thought it had noodles but it came with rice instead. The sauce was pretty strong (and I like my stuff strongly flavored), but there wasn't enough rice to dilute it to the perfect level.  I decided to order an extra cup / scoop of rice. To my surprise (I should've asked for the price beforehand), but that extra small portion of rice cost an extra $3.75!  Other places you can get extra rice for free, and rice is cheap (maybe a few pounds for that price if bought at a grocery store), so I was not happy about the overpricing.  The service did seem a bit slower than I would've liked.  Our group of 4 arrived around 9pm, then moved outside when we heard happy hour only applied to the outdoor seating areas.  The place did not seem overly busy (maybe 25-35% seats filled), but I felt I had to wave someone down to take our orders, where other restaurants seem to have the timing down better.  After the orders were placed, the service and food came at a good pace (servers came by less often than other restaurants, frequent enough per my group though, I requested multiple things at a time to compensate).  The atmosphere is nice and would work well for a date night.  The dish I chose was tasty, but needed some extra base (rice) to go with it to counter the strong flavor of the sauce, unfortunately adding rice was particularly pricy. I don't recommend it for more casual meetings because of the price, but for more formal/romantic occasions it could work well."}
{"text":"This was our 1st time going to Kona Grill, and judging by the reviews was pretty hesitant.  But so happy we decided to check it out anyway, because the food was fantastic!   We started with the pot stickers, and calamari, I ordered the Macadamia Nut Chicken, my wife had the Sweet Chili-Glazed Salmon, and mom had the Scallops from the low cal' menu.  And all items were cooked perfectly, and tasted amazing.  Plus the service wasn't bad either, our server \"Sean\" with the tatts on his arm was very knowledgeable and our glasses never ran empty.  We would definitely recommend this to anyone we know, and when in the area will visit again!"}
{"text":"Great afternoon at Kona Grill Summerlin.  Jen has made it a great experience regardless of the heat."}
{"text":"Went out and decided to eat at Kona because usually my experience has been positive at the Chandler location. This time at the San Tan location, not so much....  It started as the hostess greeted us. She greeted us and then took a phone call. Instead of putting the call on hold and handing us off to to someone else, she ignored us and began taking an order. Thankfully an attentive 2nd hostess came over after a couple of mins and took over. Once seated we ordered a couple appetizers and cocktails. Cocktails tasted like juice due to very little alcohol. Advised waitress and ordered a long island. This too tasted like juice. Very disappointed with cocktails. Flat bread arrived and one of the shrimp still had a shell on it as I began chewing it up. Our waitress was present as I had to spit out my mouthful of food.  She advised it was unacceptable and would make another one. I said no, we'll keep it and she said she would talk to the mgr to do something. So no biggie right? Mgr talked to us. No concession was made on the bill like the waitress advised. I was not looking for anything for free, but maybe make it half price or something which the mgr eventually did, but I had to send the bill back to get it. Order the jalapeño poke appetizer which was an outrageous $14.50 only to receive about 1/4cup of meat and bean sprouts in a martini glass. Very delicious but  a VERY TINY portion for that price. I was soo disappointed with this Kona. We paid our $100 tab and took our business over to Gordon Biersche for some real drinks and appetizers.   Do yourself a favor and go to Chandler Mall location for an amazing dining experience and stiffer drinks. Side note, our waitress was good and attentive and was tipped accordingly."}
{"text":"Food is okay. Happy hour is a great deal. This place is the best for peeping on new rich who get dressed up to go to the mall, rolling up in expensive cars."}
{"text":"My cousin told me about this place & I have been hooked ever since. This is the only place I go to for happy hours in Vegas.  If your going make sure you get there early because this place fills up quickly.Their Happy Hour is Monday-Friday from 3pm-7pm. During the summer they have tables outside & there is also a bar inside. I know there were a few times we had to wait for a while because the place was P-A-C-K-E-D!! The Happy Hour Menu is the BEST! My favorite happy hour  sweet & spicy shrimp,calamari and their sushi rolls. The prices are all reasonable (approx $3-$5). It gets pretty busy & chaotic in there, but the servers(at least the ones I've experienced) have consistently been very patient, calm & friendly.   If your in Vegas this is definitely one spot worth going to."}
{"text":"Sushi here is great.  LOVE the Checkerboard roll (spicy!).  The passion fruit crème brulee is also great. I've been going here for years, and will keep going."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants.  Great sushi, passion fruit crème brulee.  Have been going for years.  Will continue going."}
{"text":"Came into Kona w/ a party of six, manager came out and claimed someone's ID wasn't valid simply because it was flimsy/bent. They asked us to leave, all of us are so obviously of age. Never going back again."}
{"text":"I have to say my family and I received the best service from Amanda at Kona Grill.   My family and I were celebrating our 10 year anniversary in Vegas and after all said and done we both wanted to eat at a place that wasn't a buffet.  Kona grill came up in our search within the top 5 and with the ability to make reservations via yelp we decided on this place.   We met a sweet and bubbly personality by the name of Amanda who was very attentive to our needs. She really made us feel welcomed and wasn't hesitant to answer all our questions or provide recommendations.   Amanda you get to read this. Thank you from my my family and I for being so polite thoughtful and for providing the best customer service one could ever ask for."}
{"text":"Always order the chicken with shrimp lettuce wraps.   My go to is the pad thai with shrimp and chicken you can always request to make it spicy.   It is kid friendly.   The only thing is depending on who your waiter/waitress is how your overall experience is going to be. They seem to be sorta harried at times. If you're looking for a bright and airy environment this is not the place for you it is kinda dim and dark inside.   We love the large wall fish tank!"}
{"text":"I love Kona grill. It is important to me that I find excellent kid friendly service and this place goes beyond my needs with a great menu and service. I love the coconut roll. So so so yummy"}
{"text":"Regular here during my lunch breaks at the mall with coworkers we are always pleased with the service and the happy hour! Not a bad experience once. Love this place with friends."}
{"text":"We went for happy hour. The margaritas were good! (Upgrade to patron). We also got the spin dip (it was okay), the lettuce wraps (pretty good), and a couple of sushi rolls. Our favorite was the spicy shrimp roll. The waiter was nice, the manager was kind of rude to us. I would go back, but I'm not eager to."}
{"text":"Some close friends of ours are big fans of this place. I believe part of it is due to the fact that they have really good happy hour specials here.   Those two factors, the friends and the prices, are what keep us coming here. If it's just me and my husband, we never think to go. The food is pretty good, and for us, it's been pretty consistently so since we have been going (quite regularly, I might add).   The service is good. I've never had a bad or weird experience here.   The drinks I've had here are really good. And like I said, good happy hour specials. So if you're into drinks, this place is nice."}
{"text":"I've been hearing such great things about this place from friends for a year. I finally make it I've and I'm SOOOO DISAPPOINTED!!!!! We sat on the patio. The hostess didn't really help, she didn't even say Hello! I had to go back up to the front to get a menu.   Once we sat down it took a little longer than we expected to have someone come over. But once he did our drinks came out fast. We asked about specials and the young man was knowledgeable about them but didn't do a good job of \"Selling\" them! We finally settled on two steak sandwiches... Very bland, very fatty piece of meat, little dry and wasn't cook to the temp I had asked for! The bread was good, and the garlic aioli was good but all the rest of it I could pass in life and not care!!   *Our server did keep our drinks filled ( that gets a star)!  Dessert: hmmm... Yeah another little disappointment! Red velvet cake was dry. But key lime was decent!   All n all I think this place was all hyped up for nothing. Disappointed! Won't go back. But that's just us!   GOOD LUCK HAPPY EATING"}
{"text":"Every weekend I like to \"try new restaurants\"...kona grill makes that hard to do as you can't beat their quality food, atmosphere, and customer service. We've been coming here for years and although I like to branch out and try new things?!? Kona grill is in the constant rotation as its good every.single.time...can't beat their happy hour either as great quality and great prices."}
{"text":"Have never had a pleasant experience at this location. If you enjoy being ignored by the staff waiting an extremely long time for mediocre food then Chandler Kona is the place to go.  Do not sit at the bar at this location even worse. Staff AND management turn over speaks volumes. I have called in orders that never get placed. Managers that don't care if your food is undercooked or the wrong thing. I'm so over this location would rather McDonalds in the food court or going to BJ's Brewhouse a few minutes away then that hole of a place.  Even tried one last time called and asked the \"manager\" what time they closed he said 11 we got there at 945 and bartender told us we missed last call for food.  If like me and enjoy Kona at least the Gilbert location is well managed."}
{"text":"They finally opened so excited  Just walked in place looks amazing  The 2nd floor is insane  Great crowed same happy hour menu  Most of the old staff are still here  Let's do this"}
{"text":"Wow! What a surprise! I have to say I wasn't expecting much being a chain, but I was very impressed.  I'm not a huge salmon fan, but for some reason I ordered the miso glazed salmon salad for lunch. I really need to be in the mood to order salmon and today I was. Kona Grill did not disappoint. The salmon was cooked perfectly and melted in my mouth. The dressing on the salad is amazing! I would love to get that recipe!  The portion of salmon was huge, something I would expect for dinner. I loved it!  My companion ordered the tacos, a combination of the macadamia nut chicken and the shrimp. She really loved the macadamia nut chicken tacos, but said the shrimp was a bit bland. She said the fried Rice that came with the dish was OK, but not great.  We started the meal by ordering an appetizer calamari.  It had a light dusting of chili on it that was nice and came with a side of aioli.  The calamari was tender and very fresh. The batter however, needed more seasoning. We added a lot of lemon and salt. Once we did that it was delicious.  Something I don't normally comment on are the drinks. We both ordered iced tea. It was probably the best restaurant Ice-T I've ever had. I also want to complement the staff. They were very attentive from the moment we walked in until they said goodbye when we left. If it weren't for the seasoning issue, I would give Kona Grill five stars. I will definitely go back and try something else."}
{"text":"I would like to commend the host staff and our server, Julie, for making our dinner a memorable night! We walked into an incredibly busy establishment with 14 starving teenagers and still managed to be seated within a half hour. The food all arrived at the same time and every one of us was extremely pleased with our plate."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here after doing some power shopping in the mall.  We sat in the bar so we could watch the end of the Saint vs Sea Hawks game.    There was a bit of a funky, sewer type smell in the bar area.  I was worried a first, but they opened the doors to the patio area and a nice breeze came in.  We ordered the avocado egg roll appetizer and a Houston sushi roll.  The eggs rolls were good, but the honey dipping sauce is probably what makes them stand out.  The houston roll is made with ahi, fresh jalapeno, and cream cheese and was just delightful.  We split the Salmon entree with rice and broccoli.  It was moist and flavorful,  and a bit sweet.  Overall a very good experience.  We were dressed in athletic clothes and brought in our shopping bags and felt completely comfortable.  Service and food were friendly and prompt.  After I had already ordered a glass of wine, I noticed a \"skinny\" drink menu with cocktails around 100 calories.  The mojito and margarita sounded great for next time."}
{"text":"Love this place and the happy hour! Sushi is delish! Happy hour is fun and lively and the drinks aren't that bad either"}
{"text":"Overall good experience dining here. Great HH that's worth trying out, especially the calamari. Really love the huge saltwater tank they had, just wish a few employees would have known the type of fish in it!"}
{"text":"Happy to have a Kona at the Quarter. Food was on par with the other locations but the service was deplorable. We didn't order more food or drinks because the service was so slow. We waited a long time for the check as well. Won't be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"OMG!!! Samantha!! What a great server. Attentive, polite, pleasant smile, good sense of humor. Love Kona Grill and privileged to have Samantha as our server!! Thanks Kona!!"}
{"text":"Awesome happy hour!  Lots of people there all the time.  We had to wait a while to get a seat at the bar, but the manager Bob made sure we eventually got one!  Server Brandon was also awesome, recommending a butter-cake dessert which was delicious.  Service was great, food is great, atmosphere is great - on the couches or outside on the patio!  Get there at 5pm if you can, to make sure to get a great seat for happy hour! We go here at least once a month now!"}
{"text":"Had a great time with my beautiful wife. First date since our anniversary last year. Grandma watched the baby which allowed us to have some freedom and stay out late. Bottle of wine, sushi, perfect!  A little cold and way too bright in the main dining area. Overall though a good night."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this restaurant while visiting nearby REI. We were visiting from the Pacific NW and I was having a sudden problem with the extreme heat. I needed food and water quickly so my problems didn't get worse. I have dietary restrictions so these sudden food issues can be a problem. We usually plan our outings a little bit better. We decided to chance it. Our service was great, menu was good and I was able to find a wonderful salad on the menu. My husband's lunch was just as good too. Since being back at home we have both commented that we wished Kona Grill was in our area."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times and the food is good and a great happy hour especially for sushi, but the service is TERRIBLE. Some of the worst service I've seen coming from the service industry myself. I understand being busy or if something went wrong with a table but our server was nowhere in sight and when we finally flagged him down, he took 2 out of the 5 people in my party's order and then started to walk away. Really disappointed by the service."}
{"text":"Sat in open seating bar and had the at server ever. Even offered someone in our party a vegan menu. Very welcoming and good pricing and amazing sushi!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure where to begin, looking back on our experience seems like a bad dream.  After waiting for drinks for so long we forgot if we'd ordered them or not, finally being asked an hour later if we'd like to order food, the final straw was being told my filet had \"missed\" the plate in the kitchen and fell on the floor.  The owner needs to be in on the hiring of staff from the managers to the waiters."}
{"text":"Big fan of their $3 happy hour sushi. It's fresh and made to order, as it should be, and tastes great. Also like their $5 happy hour pizzas, great crust. Outside of happy hour, they have a lunch menu that allows you to pair 2 items for about $8 and change. Their regular menu is a tad pricey."}
{"text":"While in the men's room Friday May 8, 2015 an employee came out of a stall and HANDS WERE NOT WASHED.."}
{"text":"What a great place to go in Vegas.  Not one of those buffet places.  Not one of those hoity-toity restaurants.  True, it's away from the Strip, but you get excellent food at reasonable prices (and you don't have to maneuver around slots and tables  to find it).  My favorite item as the albacore tataki.  My friend finished off the sauce by pouring it into her rice.  I was surprised to hear that it was a chain.  Unfortunately, they don't have any close by.  Los Angeles is missing out for sure."}
{"text":"Very bad service and management., they are very bad food was ok but service was really mean I like the Scottsdale,AZ better"}
{"text":"Had lunch at the Kona Grill @ San Tan Village this past weekend and it was an overall terrible experience. I've been going to Kona Grill restaurants for years and never had an experience this bad, and that includes one time having a twist tie in my veggies at the Scottsdale location.  We were seated straight away because we arrived around 1:30 or so. Our server greeted us within a minute or so and we ordered drinks but weren't ready to order our meal. Our liquid refreshments arrived within less than a minute. So far, everything is cool.  Then things went downhill. It took another 10 minutes, after getting beverages, for our server to get back to us to take our meal order. Since we don't typically order starters, we expect it to take about 10 minutes or so to get our meal. After 30 minutes, however, I had to hunt down our server and ask on the status and was told that they had to make a new batch of mashed potatoes and they were waiting for that. I told her that the rest can be served and then give us the mash after it's ready.  Our meals arrived, but they had apparently been sitting under a heat lamp for quite awhile because they were lukewarm at best. Then the potatoes came a few minutes later and they tasted like cleaning solution.  If I could give 1.5 stars, I would have, because the server did knock off 50% the cost of one entree which made me a little less irked. But, all-in-all, I probably will never go back to this Kona Grill because of this experience."}
{"text":"The remodel looks fantastic. I stopped by for lunch the other day and I had their chicken basil linguine dish. Omg I was not expecting the flavors coming from this dish. It had a slight spice but it was good. I also had one of their \"seasonal\" sushi rolls. I wasn't a huge fan. It was way too spicy."}
{"text":"A few of us needed to grab dinner on our way to an event so we decided to try the Kona Grill Happy Hour. I follow a special diet and loved the chicken kabobs  and sushi on the Happy Hour menu.  We were there on a Friday and this place gets nutty at happy hour. Best tip is probably to arrive early."}
{"text":"The food was good, we had mostly sushi.  The sex and the city 2 promotional rolls, the carrie and the miranda and we also had sashimi from the low cal menu.  We didn't care for one of the orders from the low cal menu though, it tasted like grape jelly with fish, yuck!  The service was ok.  Our waitress was nice, manager brought my husband the wrong beer though.  The BIG problem though was the GNATS!!!! We sat inside, on Memorial Day,  it wasn't crowded which was nice because we brought out 1 year old.  But there were a significant amount of GNATS flying around us all night long, gross, I won't go back no matter how good food or service.  Food good, service ok, ambience, yuck!!!"}
{"text":"Shopping through fashion square on the 17th, my boyfriend eagerly suggested we eat here and after our experience he couldn't even understand what he was so thrilled about.   First off the hostess was impersonal and seemed to be not only more preoccupied with the boys working there, but slightly bitchy. I may retract the bitchy statement seeing as how I live in Phoenix and this may just be a Scottsdale thing.  Once seated our Server Chris was prompt in getting our drink order and our dinner order- this may have just been the only thing he did correctly. I ordered a Phili Roll with a side of rice and my boyfriend ordered soup and some Chicken and mash potato meal. Here's where it went from slightly unsettling to what the hell am I doing here.  My Phili Roll came out about two minutes after ordering it.. I work in a place that serves Sushi and there is no way you can get it that quickly in a fairly busy place. I was weirded out and slightly afraid to eat what I would assume was a roll that had been ordered by mistake. My boyfriend then received his soup seconds later- now mind you, because I work in a restaurant, I'm a fully aware that our server has two tables- INCLUDING US. He didn't bring out our food, food runners did. My boyfriends soup was splattered around the edges and not the best he's had. About two bites in he received his chicken meal. All of this has been delivered about five minutes after ordering. If I wanted fast food I would have gone to a fast food joint. His chicken meal was mediocre as I had tried a few bites and my sushi was by far the worst I've ever had. Oh and by the way are you wondering where my side of rice is? Yeah, I was too! Through this our server didn't check on us, didn't bring out our food and his manager had to refill our drinks. Oh, but all of this should be okay since it looked as though Chris was in a deep conversation with the large group of servers standing near the stairs, and boy was he thirsty because he completely forgot his manners and drank down multiple drinks throughout his conversation. I made eye contact with him multiple times trying to get him to do his job- and every time he just turned his head back to the conversation.   Once finished eating it was a different manager who boxed up the remainder of my boyfriends food. The server came over about 15 minutes after we were done to help the busser clean the table and bring us our check.  Oh no Chris, thank you very much for asking, but we didn't want more to drink, nor did we want dessert. Not only did he hardly speak to us, not offer us dessert, not check on us, not refill our drinks, not bring our food, or our check in a timely matter but he took our drinks away and completely rushed us out of the place. At this point it was time to get a manager involved in our horrid experience. Being the manager of a restaurant himself, my boyfriend explained all the wrong doings of our experience.  And boy did I have to hold back a chuckle when the manager responded with a, \"well that's weird.\" REALLY? He kindly took 10 dollars off of our 50 dollar crap meal and told us to enjoy the rest of our night.   Ten bucks off the worst meal, worst service and worst experience of my dining life? You're kidding right? And to top it off the guy could have cared less. Cute, really cute. At least we also knew tipping was out of the question at this point. I have been wonderfully trained in giving good service at the restaurant I am currently employed at. This goes for my boyfriend as well. Our management and training teams have given us a good eye for great service, and in turn this goes for terrible service as well. So, maybe that makes us individually spoiled in some way? Ehh, no, the experience was downright screwy.  Oh and don't let me forget the hellish diarrhea we both experienced once home.  But hey, at least we were able to get some delicious caramel apples from the beautifully serviced rocky mountain chocolate factory. You couldn't pay me to come back to this place and trust me the majority of the people we have told about our experience won't be dining there either."}
{"text":"If there is a wait at the other nova park restaurants. Better to wait.   This is my third try at this restaurant as its a terrific location and great environment. The outside bar is lively and this review does NOT pertain to that.  The menu always poses a dilemma for me.  Is this a sushi restaurant with a completely empty sushi bar, or do they specialize in Hawaiian entrees or pasta. The menu is a confusion at best.  Thinking I had ordered the wrong thing the two previous visits I had the Hawaiian rib steak. How can that be bad.  It was tough and full of grizzle, the mashed potatoes not mashed and unseasoned, and the entire plate was covered in not completely fried onions.  There won't be a next time for me"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the happy hour menu. The lettuce wraps and the barbecue flatbread was great. The taco trio was not worth eating. The service was excellent."}
{"text":"So ... Not only do we have the greatest food and service last night at the best happy hour in town! ... I dropped my wallet on the floor and I get a call from Michael! The manager today and last night and... Drum roll please !!! I have my wallet and all monies in it intact! YEAH !!!!! There's hope for humanity!!! Have a great weekend !"}
{"text":"Oh Kona Grill, how you bring back memories.    I first discovered Kona Grill's happy hour back in college, the lure of the $2.50 Ladies Margarita and the half price happy hour menu fit right in to my college budget!  Although the shopping after too many $2.50 Ladies Margarita's didn't, but that's a story for another day.  I went to Happy Hour at Kona yesterday for the first time in awhile, and oddly enough, it was with some of my old college buddies.  We were excited for cheap food and drinks, because even though we aren't in college anymore, we still love cheap eats!  It was a bit cold and rainy yesterday, so we were able to easily find a table on the patio (HH is only available on the patio and bar....so getting a seat sometimes turns into a stakeout!). We were a bit disappointed to see that the HH menu was a bit different than before; instead of just all the sushi and apps and pizzas being half price, they were bunched into groups by price.  Some of the prices were still half off, but others, like the Edamame ($4.00 regularly and $3.00 during HH) were not that great of a deal.  Being that it we were quite hungry, we ordered some sushi, edamame, calamari, chicken tacos, avocado egg rolls and the potstickers.  All of the food was much like we remembered, with the calamari being our overwhelming favorite, so crispy with the spicy sauce, yum!  We were a bit disappointed to see that the tacos no longer came with the yummy fried rice like they used to, but it wasn't the end of the world.  The sushi was good, but not the best I have ever had, but fresh nonetheless.  The biggest bummer about the sushi was that most of the rolls that we wanted weren't on the HH menu, especially since they were only $6.00 to begin with the HH sushi rolls were all $3.00....didn't make sense to us.  I know I will go back to Kona, but only during happy hour, I don't love it enough to pay full price!"}
{"text":"Fast, friendly service! My mother and I had a quick lunch and let the hostess know we were in a little bit of a time crunch and she made sure to tell our waiter and sushi chef. The food was amazing and presented so well. The manager, John,  even stopped to check on us. I personally love that from a manager. Our waiter, I don't remember his name, had a great attitude and vibe about him. Love, love, love this place!"}
{"text":"This location is CONSISTENTLY PHENOMENAL! We have been there about 8-10 times over the last 6 months and we love everything about it. Waiters have great personalities and are very responsive. The food is very consistent with quality and taste. We would highly recommend this location!!  The Macadamia Nut Chicken dinner plate is what we typically get and the chambord Margarita."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to go for sushi. The happy hour is amazing and I love the California Crunch roll, avocado egg rolls and BBQ chicken pizza! Matched with a red or white sangria, makes the perfect meal!"}
{"text":"This is the most family-friendly restaurant we've encountered in quite some time.  That alone deserves 4 stars.  Only people who have raised young children will be able to understand how commendable that is.    When we were looking for places to eat near the Strip, we specifically pick based on how appropriate it would be for kids to be there(since we have two young ones), and whether or not the food offered would fit their picky palettes. On Yelp, Kona Grill is not listed as being \"Good for Kids.\" However, we saw on their website that they have a kids menu, and the options seemed pretty tasty and diverse. So we ignored Yelp's designation and made a reservation. First, the tables are very spacious. In a rectangular table for a party of six, we had adequate space to seat three chairs plus a high chair on one side of the table. Had we needed, we would also have been able to utilize the space on the ends of the tables, as there were no other tables closely aligned next to it. Second, the sensitivity to kids that Kona Grill exhibits is a plus. They do not just plump a kids menu down onto the table. They bring drawing pads out for them to play. They also know to bring out the kids food first. Third, and this is the most impressively--they have a family restroom(separate from the usual men/women's rooms). With a changing station. That appears made of stainless steel. Only parents who have raised young children will understand what a game changer that is. For Kona Grill to put this kind of effort into welcoming children, when most of their customers are probably not children(at least not at the time that we frequented), speaks volumes about the type of chain they aim to be. My wife and I were blown away. Oh, and the food was great too. A diverse select was offered, from Chinese-type cuisine on the main menu to pizza(for the kids). They were all executed to great quality. The ambiance is very hip as well, and ought to be attractive to young adults and the like.  It is rare to encounter a restaurant with such a hip feel that puts so much effort into reeling in families as well.  Kona Grill executes this perfectly on both ends of the spectrum.  This is my new favorite chain."}
{"text":"We ate here yesterday for Happy Hour and it was fantastic. The Margaritas were delicious and the Satay Chicken were perfect. Great ambiance and the misters make it cool while sitting outside. Our server Alexis took exceptional care of us. We will be back soon."}
{"text":"Seriously the best happy hour in Summerlin, which they not only have during the normal week, but also on weekend afternoons. I really like being able to get sake and a roll and not breaking the bank."}
{"text":"Bobby the manager is awesome. We live across the street and stopped coming here 6 months ago for a few reasons. Today was a nice reintroduction to a nice place with renewed potential. We will definitely be back. A few months ago, not a chance. Thanks Bobby, for listening to us.  You do get it!"}
{"text":"Three of us had lunch. We ordered fried calamari, shrimp tempura rolls, and crab rolls. Our hostess was pleasant, attentive, and prompt. We gave good for calamari, but sushi chef needed to improve the rolls. We gave below average on the rolls. We may like to try other stuff later."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch on a Sunday and the food and service was pretty good. They have some  gluten free options but they list it on a separate menu with no pricing so matching things up is a bit of a pain. Just putting a gluten-free symbol next to options on the regular menu would make things easier. They do have gluten-free soy sauce for sushi and sashimi which is nice. Lots of food options from burgers to salads to sushi and sashimi so it is a good place to come to if there are people in the group who do not like raw seafood. Having lived in Hawaii for over a decade I am not sure where the Kona theme comes in as there is little Hawaiian about the place. That said the restaurant is nice though and the water tank behind the sushi/sashimi chefs adds to the atmosphere."}
{"text":"My mom and I went here for lunch today. The food and atmosphere were great but this review is mostly to tell people how awesome our server Johanna was! I ordered the pepperoni flatbread and asked for paper napkins to dab the grease off. Most servers forget that detail but she brought tons out with a plate to put the dirty ones on so I wouldn't have greasy balls of napkins all over the table. She brought us to go drinks without us asking, she was quick and polite but was also able to joke with us. I'm a server/bartender myself and I soo appreciate great service. Thanks Johanna!"}
{"text":"I'm so disappointed in this entire experience.  It started out poorly, with the table we were shown to being dirty.  There was food debris and it clearly had not been wiped down.  Our drinks took a long time to arrive but were fine.  The appetizer took a long time to arrive also, and it was way too salty.  We had to request clean flatware and plates, as the first set weren't clean either.  This was followed by sub par sushi rolls that left a lot to be desired.  The crab mix was a bit mealy and the soft shell crab was over fried and under seasoned.  The pool of eel sauce they were swimming in did little to help.  I was unimpressed with the quality of the food, the service, and as a result the value."}
{"text":"I've had the pleasure of going to Kona Grill twice and both times I was not disappointed. The most recent excursion was this past Friday for a friend's birthday get together and we had the best time. I ordered the eel sashimi and split a Philadelphia roll with a friend and both were phenomenal. I also took the opportunity to finally have desert as I usually don't get the pleasure of sampling deserts at restaurants due to being full and ordered the banana cream pie. I received a massive piece of pie and the presentation of the plate was stunning and delicious. Definitely got my money's worth on that one!  As for drinks two friends ordered wine and seemed to be enjoying them immensely, I myself has a lovely Cos[medic] Martini and I got the sample a friend's chocolate martini which was simply delicious.  The server was friendly and attentive, prompt to show up when a party guest would trickle in here or there to make sure they were served, and even helped us order a surprise sampler plate for the birthday girl from the rest of us. Speaking of the birthday girl, she got a complimentary miso soup and I believe a cupcake as well.   We had a slight billing mix-up which was understandable since we were all splitting checks and our party came in over a period of time which I'm sure made it slightly harder to keep track of everything. They were quick to sort it all out with minimal fuss which was appreciated.  On a closing note Kona Grill does offer other cuisine besides Japanese which is helpful for someone like me who loves sushi but has a boyfriend who does not. Definitely a place I recommend going, especially if you need a break from wandering the mall and don't want to battle for a spot in the food court."}
{"text":"The manager on duty couldn't have been more rude!!!! Been to several Kona locations this one being the first that doesn't have all day Sunday happy hour, so we thought we would ask why?? Just out of curiosity considering most chain restaurants like to keep things consistent.... Well not this one! The manager came over and entertained our question and simply said \"cause we don't have to!\" Then just stands there and says anything else!!... Umm, really!! So again he says we don't have to, we are to busy. Keep in mind this is at peak hours and every other restaurant surrounding him was busy that's why we ended up there. Needless to say there were five people there and the bartender couldn't make a drink if his life depended on it. So next time I'm thinking Kona sounds good I'll think again before going back to this one. Good luck to Mr. Personality  have a feeling the restaurant biz isn't for him"}
{"text":"So I have eaten here several times now all at happy hour. While the menu selection and pricing for happy hour is attractive and the potential atmosphere on the patio is inviting...the food consistently underwhelms. the very first time I ate here was over a year ago and i was pleasantly surprised with \"good\" quality rolls, satay, pot stickers (not the best but good), and decent drinks. I resolved to try it again. Fast forward 7-8 months later we move to Mesa AZ and I excitedly tell my wife about this \"great happy hour place near our new house!\" What ensues is like some farce or comedic nightmare. Happy Hour 4 x times in 2 months. visit #one...poorly constructed rolls falling apart, greasy calimari, and super sweet drinks. Not good...chalk it up to a bad night. Visit #2 same experience with the same menu. Hmmm. that was pretty disappointing. Visit #3 Birthday Happy hour with wife and daughter...but again, poorly constructed rolls (loose and falling apart), gamey tasting sushi, avocado rolls had no flavor and almost cold, calamari barely fried...pale white batter full of grease yet again (oil not hot enough), edamame almost raw and hard, drinks tasted like sugar water, to top it off we all got sick that night (yep out the back end) ..AND our mathematician of a waitress somehow calculated a super great tip... charged our card 70 dollar tip on a 90 dollar bill. this was saturday night and didn't catch it until Sunday when I looked at my bank account online Receipt was accurate but input to till was wrong....walked in to restaurant on Monday to get it fixed and share my experience. Had to call them again the next day just to get an answer on the overcharge. 1 week to fix charge and sent us two 10 dollar gift cards. Way to serve the customers who got sick, overcharged and underwhelmed experience. 4th visit. Wife and I decide to use the gift cards and give it one more try (you know, we are hopeful because we like the concept and we think the recent \"spank\" woke them up)...happy hour. wave roll, voodoo roll, margehrita pizza, edamame, drinks. I'll cut to the chase...no one there gives a \"Sh&t\" about the food. Not the cooks, managers, or servers not quality control...very evident... Drinks are a watery, sugary mess, kind of like hopped up Powerade Zero, sushi cooks (not chefs) need a lot of help and training and someone going \"Gordon Ramsay\" on their ass, rolls are loose and look like they are thrown together by a toddler...do they even know what a roll is?, pizza crust soggy and wet with balsamic vinegar (it's called \"crust\" folks) and once again edamame hard and raw. Sorry 4 strikes and you are out. Too bad, because if the food was made properly by someone who cared (and perhaps even tasted it before sending it) and the drinks were made by a bartender that knew how to balance alcohol with juice and syrup...you might actually have something. Do not waste your money here because of half price apps and drinks...i would rather pay full price somewhere else and have an enjoyable experience. I don't know what the other locations are like in this chain, but this location is riding on fumes of past success. Don't waste your hard earned dough."}
{"text":"The service is ok, not really a sense of urgency. The hostess kept double seating the guests causing some to appear to wait longer than necessary.  As for the meal, the spider roll was good. The side salad was plenty for the money.  NY Strip, not good. In fact, it was upsetting. Ordered medium it arrived very well done and had multiple tough parts, for $31 I'd expect better.  The question as to whether I would return... for drinks sure and maybe the rolls, not the steak."}
{"text":"So, I been here countless times I really like the \"Kona Calamari\" the only bad thing about  this place is the inconstancy in cooking the food sometimes its great sometime it's good and sometimes I feel it was just ok. I would have gave them 4 star if they were more constant. But It's a place I will go back too"}
{"text":"I really love this place!  They have really good sushi and the best Onion Soy salad dressing ever! The service could be better, I usually sit on the patio and there is one girl who is a waitress there who pretty much doesn't smile and is short when she comes to the table to wait on you but other then that I can't think of anything else that I would be able find as a con to this restaurant...I wont knock them a star due to this one girl...I love the place and they deserve the 5 star rating!"}
{"text":"I went here for the first time yesterday during happy hour! It was definitely cheap and so many rolls, omg. The place was really busy and I like how there's a choice to sit outside or inside. The feeling of this place was good. As for servers, maybe they should hire more. The waitress came to the table about 4 times and I ran out of water and it didn't get refilled. Anyway, it was a pretty chill first time here. Aside from the amount of rolls, they tasted good, if only they had some type of eel rolls on the happy hour menu... Overall, I like this place."}
{"text":"Great service. Potstickers are delicious. Sushi was very fresh. Kids had fun with Etch-A-Sketch. I'll definitely be back for the happy hour specials."}
{"text":"Yummy! I have eaten here several times and it is consistently very good. Everything is freshly prepared, seasoned well and very tasty. I have it four stars instead of five because it's very loud in there...but putting that aside, the food rocks. Good service, too."}
{"text":"The service: Janay was an absolute delight. Her personality was warm and welcoming. We didn't ever have a moment where our drinks were empty or wonder \"where on earth is our food\". She updated us on the status of our food multiple times.   She went above and beyond to make our visit as relaxing and enjoyable as possible! Hope to get her again when we come back! The food: We ordered the Dragon roll, lobster shrimp roll, and coconut shrimp roll. I have only had sushi this incredible at one other location!!! If I could give it a rating of 10 stars I would.  The atmosphere: The place is so  aesthetically appealing. No harsh or obnoxious lighting. The music isn't overwhelmingly loud either. The only thing I would say could be improved on is employee clustering around the bar area. Other then that the Manager came by 3 times to see how we were doing!   I will definitely recommend this restaurant to others!"}
{"text":"Host aren't friendly or welcoming ever, they sent out a bitchy vibe. I always sit in patio. There was only dirty tables available so we sat and waited to be cleaned. Maybe 15 mins later server finally came, forgot her name but anyways she asked for ids and said she'll be back to take order. She didn't give us a menu. So we waited for her to come back and then about another 15-20 mins passed and she didn't come around. The place wasn't busy for her to take so long. I'm a server myself and this would be unacceptable , it's all about customer  service wether ur having a bad day or not u should give ur 100% to each guest and give them a great experience for them to come back, right? So I suppose u don't want regulars back. I finally got up and left, didn't find a manager but told the other servers about the horrible service the patio had hopefully bring some attention to it and fix it. Prob won't be back to this location, strip location has amazing service."}
{"text":"Great service freat staff.  Wasnt to busy. But everyone seemed to have a sense kf urgency to get oit our order will come back again"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, some of the worst sushi I've had. Very sub-par. Small portions, huge prices. I understand most people go for the drinks and the scene (eek!), but the food was so far below standard I was very upset that I spent so much. The ahi tuna was completely tasteless and one of our rolls was dry and flavorless (and made with imitation crab, I'm assuming). The miso was good (probably a mix) but at $4 for a 1/2 cup portion, it wasn't really worth it. Another $4 for about 15 edamame - really?? Guess I'm spoiled from having lived in a great sushi city (Seattle) where quality matters."}
{"text":"This location is the best Kona Grill I have been to.  It isn't noisy or a 'bar' feel like the other locations.  We had a very peaceful nice dinner and enjoyed their amazing Oriental Salads with Macadamia Nut Chicken - mmm.  The best!"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch with a g/f.  I had their sushi sampler and she got their Bama Roll with a house salad.  Both were excellent.  The house salad is a wonderful mix of freshness with the lettuce, tomatoes and cucumber and the light onion and soy dressing and richness with the generous touch of bleu cheese.  The sushi was all fresh and really good.  It was a tad more expensive than I generally pay for lunch but, I would go back."}
{"text":"The food was excellent, service was mediocre and the atmosphere was poor (WAY TOO LOUD!)  Get the Oriental Salad with the macadamia nut chicken - way good."}
{"text":"I got food poisoning here. It was the worst experience of my life. Don't eat the chicken!"}
{"text":"Love kona grill....well...usually. Went there after work today with some friends for their great happy hour as I do often. Unfortunately the patio, bar and cocktail area were all full. We stood up by the hostess stand for a good ten minutes waiting for someone to leave but no luck. I then asked the hostess if there was anyway we could sit in the dinning room and receive happy hour pricing they said no. Mind you not one person was sitting in their huge dinning room. We finally left and went somewhere else after 30mins; not even being offered a drink. Why turn away business when you have an abundance of empty tables in your restaurant just because they are 4 feet from the bar. Really disappointed in the service I received today."}
{"text":"This place was average at best.  While the place has a nice hotel resort like decor and the service was excellent, the rest of the place lacked.  The restaurant was super noisy for a Saturday night making it hard to enjoy conversations at my own table. The  oriental salad I ordered lacked presentation.  It looked like a big bowl of cole slaw and nothing else. No garnish to dress it up to look like it came from a sit down restaurant kitchen. The flavor was okay, but nothing that knocked my socks off.  My husband got a seared tuna sandwich he said it was good, but lacked flavor.  The sauce was globbed onto the bread on one spot so one bite had mega flavor and the rest lacked.  I would say this place's quality is more on par with fast food.  I doubt we will be back."}
{"text":"A great place to grab your Americanized sushi rolls and/or a delicious entrée. Come to down this place and you will surely feel at home. With their beautiful pricing on both food and drink along with their commitment to consistent quality service, you will love this place. Head down to Kona Grill at around 4:00 pm, sit on their patio, stay for about 2 hours, and you will be able to look out across the horizon while sipping your alcoholic beverage, and feel an overwhelming sense of wellbeing while you watch the sunset turn the sky orange with stripes of red. Then...take a bite of your coconut/mango sushi. Wow...You can't go wrong people!!"}
{"text":"Kona has an amazing happy hour.  Its so amazing that you wont be able to get a seat, unless you are lucky.  We tried going at around 4:30 pm on a Friday, and it took about 30 minutes to get a bar table, however we had to use our charming wives to get us the seat.    The location in Gilbert is pretty small, the happy hour is only valid on the porch.  I have only been to this Kona once, and that was for happy hour.  So I cannot comment on the majority of there food.  We ordered some spicy tuna rolls and they were pretty good.    Overall, if you get out of work early go here to get some amazingly cheap drinks."}
{"text":"Hands down the worst food I have ever tasted . Ordered the potstickers, calamari, spicy tuna roll, and the rainbow roll. It was ALL inedible and I'll eat just about anything because I hate wasting food. The potstickers were dry, flavorless and were filled with dry chopped mystery meat, I assume chicken?? The calamari tasted like it was frozen and thawed 15 times, over cooked and then left out overnight and microwaved. It was extremely dry and chewy and tasted very old. The rice on the spicy tuna roll was crunchy and the fish on the rainbow roll was definitely spoiled. This was many times worse than grocery store sushi. Besides all this it was all extremely salty... Salty sushi? What is wrong with this place? Don't waste your money here. Honesty, I wouldn't go here if someone paid me to."}
{"text":"My family and I came here for a \"pre\" pre-wedding family dinner celebration. We decided on Kona Grill because we learned they had a decent selection of dishes, which was what we were looking for with our large group. There was 13 of us in the group (we had reservations from a week before), and every one of us was talking about how much we enjoyed the food and service once the night was over.   We ordered 3 appetizers, 3 bottles of vino, 13 dishes, and did not have a single issue with anything over the 2 hours we were there. Several servers helped us, and all were friendly and attentative.   Overall, we had a great experience. 5 stars all the way for the food, service, and experience we had. We're still talking about the great time we had almost a week later!"}
{"text":"Soooo good!!! The food was great! The service though was FANTASTIC! We had Rick (AKA Collin Farrell doppelgänger) as our server and he was awesome!! We mentioned that he looked like Collin Farrell and he was really fun about it. He was very knowledgeable as well. Did I mention he looks like Collin Farrell? He even joked about us calling him Collin. Regardless of his dashing looks it seemed like he knew the ins and outs of the restaurant so I was surprised that he was new at the restaurant. He was extremely flexible and investigated whether hot chocolate could be whipped up even though it wasn't on the menu. Above all he was extremely nice, chill and made the whole experience very enjoyable! I will definitely be back!         P.s. I'm pretty sure he's Collin Farrell."}
{"text":"Yes, the 'in crowd' is definitely at Kona Grill, after all they do it so well with the flashy cars parked up front and the clientele is a mix, with lots of singles who are ready to mingle.  I recently took some friends from San Francisco there and they loved it. You can always count on Kona to be a hot spot, with something for everyone and who can resist the people watching. When the weather is good, make sure to get there for happy hour, dig into a little sushi and their flatbread pizza is great. However, once you claim that outdoor seat, think carefully before you leave since the seating becomes rare as the evening approaches."}
{"text":"Horrible food, slow, over priced and rude! No thank you, go to cheesecake next door and avoid the middle life crisis crew."}
{"text":"I had lunch there yesterday, loved the veggie flatbread, friend loved the Kona chopped salad, full of good things.  But especially the service was excellent, sorry I didnt get her name, she was so nice, not intrusive but very helpful."}
{"text":"I've been to this Kona Grill a few times, and usually it's okay. We don't typically have any issues with it, and the food is usually great. My boyfriend and I showed up for happy hour recently, but the bar/patio seating was completely full so we opted for the dining area. We spent $50 on sushi, which would've been fine, but it was completely half-assed. We waited a good amount of time--probably about 40 minutes--which we were willing to cut some slack on since the bar/patio area was so busy, but two of the rolls were room temperature by the time it was served to us. This wouldn't have bothered me too much if it weren't for the room-temperature raw fish that topped the rolls and the resulting change in consistency of the food. I feel like that's kind of a picky thing to be bothered by, but at the same time, it was warm, extra soft, raw slices of fish. The Vegas roll (usually our favorite) was sloppy and sliced really thin. We would usually be happy to spend a good chunk of money on some good food, but we left Kona really disappointed and unsatisfied after this last experience. I don't think we'll be back for awhile because of it."}
{"text":"I love the Kona happy hour. Great indoor/outdoor atmosphere and I am always glad I went."}
{"text":"First of all, the happy hour is amazing! The margaritas are so strong and I get drunk off of 2. And xavier is the best server"}
{"text":"My wife and I had a wonderful experience!  We each had a calamari appetizer and then shared the spicy tuna and yamada rolls.  The calamari was cooked and breaded perfectly.  The sauce was awesome.  The spicy tuna roll was great.  The yamada roll was incredible (exactly as promised by other Yelp members)!!!  My wife had the Kona Sangria which she really enjoyed and the Creme Brule was, according to her, \"soooo delicious!\"."}
{"text":"Went here today for Happy Hour with my friends.. Some Sushi are 50% off and we took beers and a glass of white wine. Service was.. ok. Waitress looks so unhappy. Sushi are super dry , missing some sauce ! I probably be back but just for a drink in the patio."}
{"text":"The entire dining room opens to the noisy bar.  I wouldn't have thought it possible to talk over the \"music\", but several of the foul mouthed patrons in the bar managed the feat nicely.  Those of us in the front part of the dining area were regaled with their fascinating life experiences.  No stars for ambiance.   I had the lemon grass swordfish on my waiter's recommendation. My dinner consisted of a 2 oz, piece of swordfish, a small scoop of white rice and an absolutely inedible portion of bok choy.  For this I paid $24. Ridiculous.  No stars for my food.  Ms. Whodotoo had the macadamia crusted chicken.  She liked it.  I'll give them a star for that.  The waiter managed to add an extra $5.50 to our bill for a beer we didn't have.  He corrected the error when it was called to his attention.  Given that there were four items on our bill (two dinners and two beverages), I suppose the waiter can be forgiven for his confusion.  All in all, a poor experience."}
{"text":"The food was actually excellent but I'm giving 2 stars because I left a tip and then I was charged an additional tip on the total which is of course a rip-off. I think Rebecca was my server last night"}
{"text":"We went here for New Years Eve and had to wait for about an hour, but they text you when your table is ready. We sat outside on the patio bar to wait for our table and had a martini out there. Very good. Our wait time didn't seem that long. We were seated in a booth and had a lovely, professional, friendly waitress named Tiffany. We split our meal and they brought it out on 2 seperate plates. We didn't finish our bottle of wine, so they will recork it for you to take home with you. Nice"}
{"text":"This 5-star review is all because of Mick, our waiter on Monday evening.  He was very pleasant and extremely knowledgeable about the beers and wines that are served.  His recommendation and knowledge about Tenaya Creek Pilsner was not only spot on, but really interesting to here.  He also did a great job with wine's for my wife.  The service was attentive and outstanding.  We enjoyed the food and the overall atmosphere of Kona.  It was a great trip and we'll certainly be back!"}
{"text":"Have been going there for years and always had great food and service. Went there this last weekend, Sunday, with a couple of friends and we spent over $120 combined and will not go back again until they improve their service.  They brought an appetizer we told them we were going to share and they didnt bring any additional plates until we asked them to do so. Through the whole meal we were not checked on and had to continue to ask for refills on our water and iced tea. Never saw a manager anywhere.  The food was still good but going up in price and fast reaching the point of no great value. Service was poor enough that we dont really care to go back after years and years of going there. Sad to see a good place go down hill."}
{"text":"When we arrived the hostess was putting on her lipstick at the front desk.  No greeting, no hello, nothing.  Finally we asked for a table and opted for the outdoor seating.   The waitress brings us menus and seems to be a little frazzled.   So there are 8 in our party why would you bring 4 plates, 4 chopsticks, and 6 sets of silverware????  Sushi was rolled loose and looked like it was done in a rush.  We heard such great reviews of this place, but this was not a very good impression!!  :("}
{"text":"The wave roll was pretty good. The other two rolls weren't. The service was terrible, and I got food poisoning. We won't go back."}
{"text":"The Kona Grill at the Chandler fashion mall is of standard quality to say the most, the service and setting of the resturant is of good quality. However on a Saturday night expect to be bombarded by underage kids running wild and being dropped off right in front. The Kona grill offers perhaps a better setting for a lunch-in.  The menu is of standard taste an quality of which the calamari, Yamada roll, and checkerboard roll where ordered and served in a timely manner."}
{"text":"Love sitting outside on the patio & looking at High street while eating dinner. I got the BBQ chicken flatbread and it was great. But I'd have to say my FAVORITE meal is there Pad Thai! The best I've ever had! A huge portion so I enjoyed the rest of that meal for lunch the next day!"}
{"text":"So they remodeled Kona Grill as of last week they made it two stories high. The atmosphere seems a lot better than I used to be I like the open floor. I went with a party of 4 and we wound up having a blast. We ordered a bunch of sake. we also have an appetizer the shrimp. I didn't really like the shrimp it had too much mayonnaise on it I definitely wouldn't recommend that. But the sushi rolls are really really good and the dessert was spectacular we had on the Snickers pie. And we also have the chocolate fudge brownie. Which was both delicious overall I had a great experience am I getting 4 to 5 stars."}
{"text":"Kona is great.  Nice patio with misters.  The service is always great.  The crispy shrimp roll is amazing.  The pot stickers, and the ribeye steak.  Come to think of it... Pretty much their entire menu is delicious.  It's not too expensive either.  Great cost.  High street location is a great spot. Don't forget the butter cake for dessert! You won't be sorry."}
{"text":"Many thanks to Madison A who definitely helped make our dining experience A+!!  Her service and professionalism were impeccable!  All of the staff we came into contact with were very welcoming and helpful!  Our appetizers were excellent, with our favorites being the lettuce wraps with a sauce to die for, the chicken satay with a peanut sauce out of this world and avocado rolls with the perfect texture of smooth and crunchy!  Our entrees were just as delicious with pad thai full of flavor especially with the lime juice and encrusted chicken with perfect mashed potatoes! Our take home entrée of pork sliders with sweet potato fries was a big hit with my husband.  Still thinking about the flavor of all the sauces! The recipe designers and the cooks know what works!  Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night about 8 with my wife. I have had this before and it was good. But this time it was horrible. The food was bland and under cooked twice and the waitress that helped us at the beginning just came over and said I'm not going to be helping you anymore. No real reason on why. But that is okay with me she was rude to begin with anyways."}
{"text":"WOW! What a disappointment. We went this past Saturday and we have always loved Kona Grill. They have remodeled and the inside now looks and feels like a cafeteria style restaurant. We asked for a booth (the place was more than half empty) and were told they were \"reserved\". When we finished eating all the booths were still empty. I had the macadamia nut chicken and it had no flavor at all. IF we go again we would probably just go into the bar area and order the oriental salad. So so disappointing."}
{"text":"I have had a few dinners here and they were great but the last few times we have tried to sit in the bar area and the service was awful! Today 6 servers walked by us as we sat at a dirty table....nobody acknowledged us, cleaned the table or took our order. There were several servers having fun chatting at the bar though....we walked out and nobody even noticed."}
{"text":"Love Kona Grill for ambiance,  great appetizers on happy hour and friendly staff. Not on happy hour,  but my favorite app is the yellow tail sashimi with jalapeños in a ponzu. What a perfect bite! Talented executive Chef."}
{"text":"This place reminded me of the Gaslamp district in San Diego. Love sitting outside, and their Sushi is really good.  They have a Asparagus Salad that blew my mind. The only con. was that they are a little pricey."}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving this place two stars instead of one is because of the food (which was pretty good) and the friendly sushi chef.   When my boyfriend and I arrived, we were ignored by the hostesses, who asked us if we were there for happy hour& then instructed us to sit at the bar. They didn't point us in the right direction or (god forbid) show us where it was in the oddly situated restaurant, so we wandered past the host stand and sat at the sushi bar.   After we sat down we asked the sushi chef if happy hour was only at the sushi bar, and he said no, that it was also at the main bar and on the patio. The hostess could have told us this, or at least given us menus. We ended up ordering off the tiny happy hour menu that was already on the bar.  Our server took FOREVER to take our order, and even longer to bring our drinks. They looked semi-busy so I can overlook this, but I was missing a share plate and chopsticks for half the meal, which I had to ask for twice.   Apparently a lot of people ordered sushi, but there was no food runner, so at one point there were TWELVE plates of sushi up in the window and no one to take them to the tables. During this time at least seven people walked by and did nothing about it.   At least the food was ok (we ordered the ahi tuna crisps, the spicy tuna roll, the wave roll and the apple Brie flatbread) and the sushi chef kept checking on us."}
{"text":"Went for wine Wednesday because they have a killer happy hour! Our server was amazing! We were being so picky because we were deciding on wine but she recommended some wines and didn't make us feel rushed at all. Our food came out perfect and out dessert was even better! Very happy we went there!"}
{"text":"Awesome food! We had both sushi and entree and both were delicious! Define glycols recommend!"}
{"text":"This was much better than I expected.  Went at an off time on a Saturday afternoon - the dining room was pretty dead, but I think the patio was busy.  I had the flatbread - the steak one - it was delicious  great truffle oil, cheese, basil - got to say one of the best flat breads I have had.  My partner was recommended the fish tacos by our waitress - she went for the ones with sea bass - she said they were awesome.  Looks like we will be going back to Kona Grill sometime soon !"}
{"text":"I'm sure all the locals in Las Vegas know about Kona Grill but if you are visiting or just moving here this is a great place.  Their sushi rolls are to die for.  I've never had a bad meal there.  And it's a party like atmosphere especially on the weekends.  But get there before 5:00 because it gets crowded fast."}
{"text":"So I really liked coming to Kona Grill during their happy hr! $6 sushi and shrimp tacos, I loved it. But lately, the food hasn't been so good. It tastes different, and I would know because I order the same things every time I come. The past two times I have left with my stomach hurting.  Plus, I hate how it's always busy and the servers show you no attention. I work in a very fast paced restaurant so I know what it's like but seriously, I can walk out and they wouldn't notice. Last time I came with a group of friends the server gave really poor customer service. He did not greet us, he went straight to asking the orders and only checked on us one time.. when we were all done eating. Very disappointing to say I won't be coming here anymore."}
{"text":"This is a great place to have lunch with friends. The fact that the restaurant has a second floor bar and seating make for a good time."}
{"text":"Awesome experience, from staff to managing! Great atmosphere and of course always food and drinks are a plus. So glad that it's in multiple locations. Way to go"}
{"text":"We come here frequently as a group and especially enjoy the happy hour. We typically have issues with splitting the bill or when changing servers however today was different! The service was seamless and there was no issue with splitting the bills even with people in our group coming and going! Kudos to Manny, the manager on duty as well as our great servers for making it a great experience!"}
{"text":"First time experience was great!  We had a warm welcome from the hostess and were seated in a nice booth for lunch.  We were greeted with a smile & pleasant introduction by our server Grady who was knowledgeable about all of the menu items and we settled on the dragon roll and California roll.  Both selections were impressive and fresh.  Grady was an amazing server who balanced the amount of attention he gave us and our desire for quiet conversation.  We were visited by the manager who asked about our experience, which was appreciated.  We look forward to dining at Kona again and will ask for Grady!!!"}
{"text":"Walked in the restaurant from the mall entrance and you could smell fish. You shouldn't walk into a sushi restaurant and have it smell like it did. We should've walked out, but we didn't. We ordered the macadamia crusted chicken which had no flavor, Hawaiian ribeye (very fatty) and caprese sandwich (that was fine). Service was just okay. Not personal at all. Bathrooms were super dirty and weren't stocked. As I was walking back to our table you could see the floors were dirty throughout. Overall, we'll never return and we should have went elsewhere."}
{"text":"Love this place. I had the coconut shrimp sushi roll. It was so good. Lobster mac and cheese and the taco trio. I'd come back just for the taco trio for sure"}
{"text":"SERIOUSLY, the best happy hour prices I have ever seen. I've been here 3 times and my bill is always around $20. Always packed, food is perfect and always a cool vibe. Dont know about the regular menu during lunch or dinner, but Happy Hour RULES!!!!!"}
{"text":"Kona grill never fails. Its definitely the hot spot for locals! I love this place It has been one of my long time favorites & everytime I go i am pleased. I usually make it for the reverse because I love the deals they have. Their food & sushi rolls always above expectation. Sometimes though the place gets extremely packed.. but I cant  blame them who wouldn't wanna be there"}
{"text":"When was the last time you had a meal and commented \"this tastes as good as when I had it the first time\"!  I imagine not very often, maybe never.  When I arrived in the valley some 15 years ago I was visiting downtown Tempe on Mill St.  I happened to stop into an interesting restaurant called Saki's for dinner.  Checking the menu I saw they had a dish call Miso-Sake Sea Bass, that sounded delicious.   I gave it a whirl and it was straight out fantastic in every way.  Buttery melt in your mouth fish with its edges seared in a miso paste and nori flakes sprinkled over the top.  Accompanied with Hawaiian Fried Rice and a salad that had/has the best onion-soy dressing ever it was a most memorable meal.  This was almost 15 years ago; I had the same meal last evening at Kona Grill in Chandler and commented the opening line in this paragraph.  Way to go Kona Grill, as I say about old soul records, it just gets better with time."}
{"text":"Food was good but i felt like i spent more time there than necessary. waited awhile for beer and wife with her wine.......lunch time and not to busy. well it worked out fine and of course we will go back."}
{"text":"Mere words cannot describe how much I love Kona Grill at San Tan.  We go there, and usually get the same thing. Last night, we split a Grilled Chicken & Pear Salad, minus the chicken & the dressing.  We subbed in the honey dijon dressing on the side.  It was delicious.  Very fresh with cranberries, walnuts & bleu cheese.  We even had some extra to take home.  For our entree, we each ordered the miso-sake sea bass.  We substitute the 2 sides with mashed potatoes & green beens.  Everything is so flavorful and good tasting.  The sea bass is marinated for 72 hours in the miso-sake.  It cannot get any better than this.  Again, we have some leftovers for tonight to add to the salad.  Kona also has a great beer and wine selection.  Now, one of the best parts to add is the service and personalized attention that we always get at Kona @ San Tan.  We had a server named Brayton that awesome.  He was attentive, made sure that everything was correct on our order, and took the time to share a bit about himself.  We had a great conversation with him.  He is one of the best servers we have had in a while.  Carol is one of the bartenders.  She is always there to give us a hug.  I take someone who is permanently disabled who adores her, and I love the beautiful smile and goodness that she always shares with us.  Shadi is one of the managers.  He has always done exactly the same thing.  He takes the time to come to our table to chat and thank us for coming in.  Somehow, he always brings tears of goodness to my eyes.  He is just a very good-hearted man.  Now we have gotten to know another manager named Don.  He is just as fantastic.  He comes around, chats, and always checks to make sure that all is good.  I LOVE a place that we can go to that has fantastic food, quality, caring people to serve us, and truly show their appreciation of their customers.  Thanks so much Kona.  Keep up the great work."}
{"text":"Good part: Nice interior Server was nice  Not so good part: We ordered two specials that server told us. Albacore tuna was supposed to be medium rare, but cooked through.. Rice was dried. Is this left over one? Another was tuna w/ fried roll. Maybe 70-80% was rice. Is it special because too much rice in it?  I would probably give two stars but add extra for server."}
{"text":"I can't say enough great things about this restaurant - we have been to many sushi places in Washington DC and New York - this one is by far at the top. Service was great - special kudos to AJ! Sushi was outstanding and lots of healthy options as well - very creative!"}
{"text":"While the food was good, the service was abysmal. Although it was Mother's Day, there was only one other table that was occupied in the area we sat in, so they weren't busy. We ordered sushi rolls as an appetizer, but even after we were done with them it was a good 20 minutes before our waitress reappeared asking if we needed anything. WE had to tell her we were ready to order entrees! At this point, everyone's drink was empty, but she failed to notice this and didn't even come back to refill the drinks! Dinner did take a while to get to the table, with the entire experience lasting almost 2 hours. I don't mind lingering over appetizer/dinner/drinks but the insanely slow service meant drinks weren't being filled and food wasn't served timely. Not likely to go back, especially not for a special occasion."}
{"text":"Love this place! I stopped eating at Stringrey Sushi because of this place. The people are so nice and the food is always delicious!! I eat here twice a week, $60 per order to give you an idea of how great this place is. See you this weekend Kona Grill!  If you have any specials or coupons you can send me, please do.. My sushi budget has gone way up since trying you guys!"}
{"text":"I was disappointed. This location does not compare to other Kona Grill locations outside Vegas. The calamari was oily and the oil was not fresh. The margarita was mostly lemon and water. Sushi was very good though, and the cheeseburger sliders."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I ate here this past weekend, not for the first time. The food is pretty consistantly good! The service is about the same. Nothing phenominal but definitely consistant (not a bad thing by any means). A good convenient spot with a large variety of food and a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Frankly, I used to enjoy this place, but the new menu is bunk and service went down hill.  Our waitress botched our drink order multiple times, but we had no recourse since they add 18% gratuity to parties of 7.  They even charged an extra $2 for adding ice to my scotch!!  The Omikase sashimi combo claims to have 18 pieces, but I counted 14.  What's with all the sauces?  They're trying way too hard with this: since when does sashimi need to be drenched in sauces?  Rather than accentuating the fish, the sauces ruined it.  Plus the pizza was greasy.  I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Awesome food, even better when it's happy hour! Totally recommend the ahi tuni crisp and cucumber mojito. Really good! For the most part, the atmosphere is decent, just gotta watch out for affliction wearing/ed hardy type of clientele that make their weekly, sometimes, nightly appearances."}
{"text":"I went to Kona Grill on a Thursday night. The service was impeccable and the food was phenomenal.  The first table at which we were seated was right in front of a side door that let in the glaring sun directly into our eyes.  The hostess noticed this right away and moved us to another table immediately.  Our server was friendly and helpful.  I was trying to figure out which sushi roll I loved that I ordered three years ago, so I was describing it to the server.  She took the time to help me figure out a sushi roll that I ended up loving.  I ordered the Atlantic roll, which met all of my requirements in a very tasty way.  It had baked salmon, spicy aioli, cucumbers, tempura flakes, and eel sauce.  It was well worth the $7, and I will be a repeat customer just because of the Atlantic rolls alone.  For my meal, I ordered the Basil Pesto Chicken Linguini, which is extremely delicious.  My dad copied my order and was well pleased.  My stepmom is a vegetarian and ordered a flat bread with roasted vegetables.  The pizza-like dish was large enough for two to share and had asparagus, mushrooms, red bell peppers, and opinions on it.  We all ordered wine that nicely complimented our meals.   Since I was there for my birthday, I was given a super tasty red velvet cupcake with a buttercream icing and fruit garnish.  Although I don't have much of a sweet tooth, it was gone in about 17 seconds flat.   I will return to this Kona Grill again and recommend it to others because of the excellent service and amazing food."}
{"text":"This used to be cool place with good food. Now sushimi with slice of lime is called ceviche....ahhh"}
{"text":"Since we always come here for happy hour, I thought to stop by for lunch one day for sushi.  Um, yeah, there aren't very many sushi specials for lunch.  The only thing on the menu was 4 pcs sushi with soup for $10.  The menu was puzzling - had clam chowder, burgers, and non-existent sushi options.  Very disappointing."}
{"text":"One of the best happy hours in Vegas.  If you're looking to hang out with some friends between 3pm - 7pm for pretty cheap, this is a good place to go to."}
{"text":"Another in a long line of eateries in Phoenix that have gotten me really, really sick due to cross contamination.   I'm highly allergic to fish, so I understand the risk in going somewhere that 1/2 the menu revolves around fish. However, when I order something made out of, oh... beef, then I expect them to use proper food handling procedures to avoid cross contamination.  And yet, there I was, 1/2 through my sandwich, throwing up to beat the band in the bathroom stall.   I guess this isn't a point that the local Departments of Health like to stress. However, this is also the sort of thing that can very easily kill someone. Fish, peanut, and other allergies of the like are the kinds that can end someone quicker than a bullet.   Won't be going back there, no matter how much the GF needs a sushi fix."}
{"text":"This place is way overrated.  I've eaten here several times, wanting to enjoy the food, and the menu is just overpriced and tasteless.  This restaurant also has an identity crisis.  Is is a bar and grill?  Is it a sushi bar?  It doesn't really matter because it doesn't do either particularly well.  I'm not a great sushi chef, and I can make better sushi than this place.    Their happy hour is affordable and is the only reason this place doesn't get one star."}
{"text":"Located at the fashion square mall it is so convenient for after shopping! Happy hour is great as far as drinks! Food is decent! Great afternoon spot!"}
{"text":"A friend recommended this place to us and even recommended the Hawaiian ribeye. We went on a Saturday night at about 5:15. Upon ordering, the waiter returned to say the chef just informed him that they did not have that item available this night that I would need to select another item. I would say that was poor planning on the chef for it to be the weekend and one of you Hawaiian dishes was not available. What I ended ordering was very good. Prices a little high on some things but overall it was good. We had good service."}
{"text":"Was having a horrible trip to Vegas when the wife suggested we try this place out. Had a bit of a hard time getting there as we got conflicting addresses from yelp but when we arrived from the moment we got there the service was top notch! The food was great and our server John went above and beyond! I'd recommend this place to everyone! Turned my whole trip around!"}
{"text":"I went there with my hubby for lunch 3 days ago.  I went to the one in the mall in Scottsdale.  And I believe that we won't go back again.  Not to mention how much they charged, their services were really hollow.  So, I ordered a cheeseburger and I was so surprised that they couldn't even make it right.  I mean it is supposed to a simple meal.  I mean if you cannot handle the fundamentals, how can you handle special dishes.  So, going back to my so called cheeseburger.  For one thing, I couldn't taste any \"cheese\" out of the cheeseburger.  For another, the patty is just bland.  Also, they also seemed to run out of onion.  I was very  disappointed.  My hubby, too, found it strange that they could make his chicken sandwich so dry.  The pineapple and chicken were like 1000 years old and the bread was cold.  Sometimes, I just wonder how these guys can survive. If I were them, I would be extremely worried especially we are now in an economic downturn."}
{"text":"good food. consistently slow and lousy service.  I had forgotten that it was nearly exactly a year since I'd been here,  and had the exact same experience (and my companions remembered too).  Very attentive manager,  but indifferent servers ... unbelievably slow.   It took an hour and a half since we arrived to go from order to meal.   Twice I had to get up and ask the manager about the status (oh and we ordered sushi, which doesn't need to be cooked!).   Food was very good though.  So if you want great food without caring about the wait,  or attitude of the staff then Kona Grill is the place for you!"}
{"text":"Only been here for two happy hours.  Nothing special.  Happy hour food was okay but the drinks were pretty empty of flavor.  With all the other happy hour choices in Summerlin I pass on a 3rd Kona Grill happy hour experience.  I bet there dinners are better."}
{"text":"Their sushi is horrible, their food is like an old lean cuisine meal. I feel bad for the waitresses that have to work their. Their food is beyond over priced for the horrible taste that is left in your mouth."}
{"text":"Great sushi and service. Also, great kids meals for $7.50 including one item, two sides and a drink. Will come again when in Vegas."}
{"text":"Four of us went here for lunch today.  We sat in the outside patio area which was very nice.  Our waiters name was Eddie and he was great.  We had Sweet & Spicy Shrimp and Ahi Wanton Crisps for an appetizer.  Both Delicious.  For the Entrees we had Sweet Chili Chicken, Chicken Pesto Linguine, Halibut and Shrimp. All 4 meals were delicious.  We shared a brownie & Ice cream dessert that was also very good.  The entire meal including appetizer s, dessert and several rounds of drinks was only $102.00.  I would definitely recommend trying this restaurant.  The atmosphere, service and food was great."}
{"text":"My first time coming to Kona and I'm leaving beyond satisfied! Mainly because of our service by Angelica, she was superb! My husband and I both walked in a little hangry lol just extremely ready to eat! Her up beat attitude put us both back in a happier mood! She was perfect I can't tell you enough how amazing she was! She came back to check on us multiple times refilled my drink without asking and brought ranch to the table when she saw it was empty because I was still eating. Not gonna lie her service was the best service I have probably had in the longest time! The food was great too we had the bbq flat bread and sandwich to share which Angelica was kind enough to split for us with out us asking for it. Food was delicious. Totally will be coming back to sit in her section! Thank you for making our first time there a great one!"}
{"text":"Really good California Rolls and the Crab Crunch Roll! The sauce they put on the Crab Crunch Roll was super delicious! I have not tried any of their other food but I definitely would recommend those two rolls. They also had really good tea as well."}
{"text":"Just discovered this place... (As I'm new to vegas) EXCELLENT sushj!!!!! Happy hour here is just awesome! $5 sushi! You can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Brilliant ambience and avocado egg roll is delicious"}
{"text":"We were hungry.... We were thirsty....We were starving for football... So we went here for happy hour on a Saturday, just to give a new place a go. Ended up getting pretty plastered but was a great time. Had awesome sushi and watched some college football. Bartender was very friendly, knew her drinks and made them well. The sushi was in decent serving sizes and was very good. The bar has a decent alcohol selection too, we able to make all the drinks and shots we thought of. Will 100% be going back!"}
{"text":"Kona grill's raspberry ice martini is the best martini I've had in my life! The service was great. I had a flat bread that was pretty good. The hamburgers are average. We didnt try the sushi. I'm giving it 5 stars for the martinis...I will travel a lot of miles to come back here"}
{"text":"Great bartenders and servers  always. Very affordable happy hour and a huge menu with a large selection of sushi. Great casual spot to meet for dinner near desert ridge. Cam and Glenn the managers are super friendly and helpful as well!"}
{"text":"First and last time going to this place. I got there at 12pm ordered a jerk chicken sandwich and a salad for my wife. At 12:40pm the manager comes and tells me its going to be a few minutes more. To which I replied \"What\" you mean to tell me it takes u 40 minutes to make a salad and a sandwich. And the place was not even full of people. Bad service do not recommend going there."}
{"text":"We had the sea bass it was outstanding. Louis the server was awesome. He stayed engaged and recommended some great appetizers and meals."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place the service is good and the rolls are great.  Happy hour is the best this is our date night on Fridays we have a great filling dinner and drinks for 30 bucks.  I totally recommend happy hour"}
{"text":"Kona Grill is great! Great food and great atmosphere and our server Elissa was the best! She recommended the New Banana cake! It was amazing!! Really amazing!!! Loved it!!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour! Their sushi is so soft and almost falls.apart - but in a good way. You can tell how fresh the ingredients are . The salad wraps are AMAZING!! Can I get the recipe?"}
{"text":"I really should know better by now... If it's not a dedicated sushi restaurant.. Don't order sushi!! It's like ordering fish at a burger place!  Sushi looked amazing but the rice on their rolls was a bit hard.  Needless to say I didn't finish the meal otherwise I would have hurled!  I also had their pot stickers which again I did not enjoy.  Sad to say but lean Cuisines have better potstickers!  Lastly but not least, their brownie desert was ... Meh.  Perhaps had I ordered a different entree I would have had a better experience."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Right in the middle of the happenin' part of Boca Park. I ordered the Basil Penne w/Chicken and Sausage. It was delicious! It was also a perfect portion - not too small, not too big. My stomach was not wanting more nor was it going to explode. The server was polite and readily available. The managers also came around and asked how everything was. The prices were appropriate for the type of restaurant and quality of food. Excellent dining experience!"}
{"text":"All the other restaurants were lined up but even so we had great sushi and great service  A little dark inside but still really nice atmospheres"}
{"text":"Woo braddah! What a place to find myself while I'm here all week for business! From the cloth chihuly umbrellas hanging from the ceiling, pages of menu to some pretty original pacific fusion.  First night here had the volcano and the lobster and ahi flat bread. That was it, sushi pizza, even in Hawaii, never had this combo done right. Seared tombo, langoustine usugiri avocado and tomatoes drizzles with yuzu aioli, piled on top of a fresh baked crispy flatbread... My mouth is broken, I can barely speak. Delicious. The Waitress was very friendly, she brought me a special sauce that she likes on the pizza, a spicy aioli. She might as well given me a bottle of \"give me a giant tip\" brainwash juice.  Love it. I'm planning to come back for one more taste... If it's good as it just was, I'm gonna have to give it that last star."}
{"text":"Great food! Amazing service!  Our waiter, David was pleasant,  attentive,  and knowledgeable. The service was Fernandez fast. The Lobster Mac n' cheese was fantastic.  Great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere.  We sat in the new upstairs seating.  It was great.  The happy hour is a good deal for food and drinks.  The service was awesome.  We will be going back."}
{"text":"Excellent seared ahi plate and macadamia nut chicken plate. However, service sucks, on NUMEROUS occasions (4 consecutive occasions, to be exact).  The dinner prices versus the lunch prices are ridiculous. And unfortunately, due to the lack of good service, I will take my business elsewhere. You are not the only good restaurant in town.   FYI: A few of us pay to be treated with respect, and the food doesn't make up for that. And I forgot to mention, we also tip very well!"}
{"text":"This place had decent food. The prices are too high for what they sell and the service was not all that great. I wont be coming back to this place again. The best thing about this place was the calamari for the app. I would not recommend this place, unless you are on a date trying to show off your money by spending way too much on way too little."}
{"text":"Very good dinner! I really enjoyed the new roof top deck. It has a great atmosphere both inside and outside and the views from the rooftop deck were beautiful! The service was very good and very helpful.  I ordered the chicken and broccoli stir fry. It was really good!!! I split the dish with my boyfriend who ordered the special fish which was swordfish that day. Both were delicious and the fish was prepared very well. Also the happy hour is great and has a lot of good sushi rolls on it for half the prices."}
{"text":"I love taking people here for a quick happy hour lunch. We get 3 items and end up taking most of it home. 2-3 people we end up paying $20. Wait service kind of ify but it depends who you get"}
{"text":"Food was sooo delicious! Went in for lunch with a friend, had great service and great food. Waiter suggested a few good sushi rolls and they were so good that we asked for seconds! Also, its very beautiful inside the restaurant. Nice way to end our shopping trip in the fashion square mall at Kona Grill. Will definitely be going back. Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Gregory is the best bartender.  The frozen margaritas are strong.  I loved the cheeseburger sliders and the fries."}
{"text":"Horrible. This Kona at the mall, these people care nothing about service. Waited forever for food, looked around 7 tables were waiting as well, not at peak lunch time! Lady next to us complained, so her tables food came out before ours, we were sat before them and same size party. Our server never checking on us!!! Worked in restaurant industry before and were looking at our sandwiches under the heat lamp not being brought to us. Called our server over because she was not checking on us and she said, \"chicken takes longer\". ..no \"sorry it will be right out.\", We had already ordered 40 mins ago... We walked! First it's hot inside at this one, feels like no A/C and 114 outside. This is an open to outside restaurant even when sitting inside it's too hot!!!! Life to short for this nonsense. When leaving I let them know why and server says okay buh-bye! Yep that's right buh-bye to my money!! You won't be employed long if people don't eat at your restaurant. Get a clue."}
{"text":"I visited during reverse happy hour and the lemon drop and moscato were amazing! I also ordered the salmon and pork and shrimp fried rice, it was pure deliciousness!!! I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I'd give 5 stars for the food! The sushi and burger were great! Our service on the other hand is a different story. It's a Friday night and we were in and out in under an hour not by choice. I wanted the pina colada and our server quickly responded with we don't have a blender and its crap if get the mojito...ok...they have a brisket burger special which my husband ordered only for our server Destiny( really a pleasant girl who really is a good server) to come back and tell us they don't have any brisket...it's a Friday at 650 and you are out of a special...poor planning on the managers part. So we get our sushi and the regular burger which was all fantastic. We aren't even half way through the entree when Destiny asks us if we are having dessert. Can we finish our entrees and see how we feel? We decided against dessert rather quickly and within two minutes of us saying we weren't going to have anything else she had dropped the check. My husband was in the middle of his burger. Nothing worse then feeling super rushed on date night. We paid in cash and she quickly picked up the bill just has my husband finished his burger. We most likely would return for the food cause it is really good but probably stick to the bar area. I love dessert and probably would have had some but feeling rushed put a damper on things so we went to the Cheesecake Factory next door for some nice cheesecake."}
{"text":"Half off bottles of wine on Wednesdays! Yeah!! Great food, great happy hour prices. loved the calamari."}
{"text":"Delicious food,  awesome happy hour.  We love it because it's a place where we can go and my wife can have her sushi and I can enjoy a burger or a Cuban sandwich at the same time."}
{"text":"Every time I come here the bartenders are just awful. We sat at the bar at happy hour today, and it was ridiculously difficult to get our bartender's attention. Then the happy hour food we ordered took 20 mins."}
{"text":"Food was really good here. ummm service ehh not the greatest we've experienced but overall it was decent. The chicken shrimp lettuce wraps were delicious!"}
{"text":"Calamari, with leggy pieces,  which I love.   Lighlty battered with aioli sauce. Kids meals are incredible, grilled salmon, grilled cheese and sushi roll options. Jalapeño yellowtail sashimi.   Hawaiian ribeye, one of the best steaks I've ever had.  Tacos with mac crusted chicken or shreemps I'm stuffed and satisfied. A new phx must do."}
{"text":"Quality of food has taken a beating. It used to be so good - I'm talking about the Macadamia nut chicken. We probably won't go back."}
{"text":"We held our son's and daughter-in-Laws Wedding luncheon at the Gilbert,AZ location.  They worked with us so well to make sure all details were tended to.  The food was great! (we had 30 people in attendance and all thought it was a great place...so many comments on the food)   I would definitely recommend this restaurant for small groups or larger groups. When we received the bill-they did not charge for the bride/groom food or the wonderful desserts we ordered to be shared at the end of the meal. We were quite taken back by the generosity of the management at Kona Grill."}
{"text":"It a convenient location on the strip, and the food is fine.  I just couldn't figure out the decor theme, and it kind of made my head swim."}
{"text":"Food was good but service was horrible. Hunter was our server we waited 15 mins for a glass of wine and beer a ticket time for drinks shouldn't take even half that long. Once we got our drink order I told him we were ready to order he told us he will be right back and he didnt come back for another 10-15 mins. Server only came to check on us once. He was more tentative to his larger party on the patio. I understand happy hour is a busy time but you should pay attention to detail. I work in the industry and I know how busy it can get but their is no reason for taking this long."}
{"text":"I had the Picasso Roll. It was like my mouth was reborn in a volcano made of orgasems."}
{"text":"I got the coconut shrimp sushi roll with macadamia nuts and mango. Very delicious and a bit sweet! I also got the simple tuna roll, which came with a bit more rice than I would have liked. Still fresh and tasty though."}
{"text":"This is the sushi happy hour you've been looking for! Cheap, delishish and beautiful. Driving through San Tan Mall you notice empty restaurants and chains. But im always looking for full restaurants! Kona is fullish, which means I was seated right away. The patio, bar and sports TV's make it our new favorite Monday happy hour. We downed our yum Moscow mules and split our Philly roll, sashimi, and Las Vegas roll. All on happy hour! I would skip the passion fruit creme brulee...I mean it was good... I ate the whole thing but too expensive. Wish I would have gotten another roll instead."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to this location over the 4th of July weekend. We were staying at the JW Marriott nearby and wanted to get out to a nearby restaurant, so we chose Kona Grill. Our time there was just about the best we've ever had at a restaurant. We were greeted kindly, sat promptly, but the best thing I can say about the restaurant, besides how good the food was, is about our waiter, Jeff. He was absolutely outstanding. He helped my boyfriend pick out the best sushi and sashimi he recommended, and my boyfriend loved it. I wanted something that wasn't exactly on the menu and Jeff said, \"What is it you want? I'll make sure we get it made for you!\" And they came through like he said. Mine was perfect. It was such an enjoyable experience. The manager even came by to see how we were doing. We even got to enjoy some dessert on the house! The food is excellent, the staff is amazing, and if you can get Jeff as your server, please do!! We will definitely be going back again!"}
{"text":"We came with a group of 12 with reservations.  We even received a confirmation call.   When we got here we were told there was no reservation.  The manager apologized over abs over but did nothing to try to accommodate us.  This once is poorly managed. The staff is not trained on the rules."}
{"text":"I was brought here on a date and thoroughly enjoyed myself. Excellent wine and an excellent burger. Everything was pretty much cooked to perfection which was nice given that it was a late lunch date and sometimes that means sub par service. The atmosphere was lovely because they have a gargantuan fish tank and the decor inside is just kind of cool. Over all I would give it a thumbs up."}
{"text":"The location appears to be a classier alternative to the food court. The patio may have a different setup as far as the staff goes though. Our table got the vibe that the busboys were also our servers. I don't have a problem with that as long as they're attentive (not the case though). It literally took 20 minutes to get our drinks we ordered from when we sat down. The waiter forgot our appetizer completely and we never received anymore drink refills. Pretty disappointed in the sushi portion as well. Just grab something quick at the food court if you must, otherwise go to one of the other restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"I can only speak for one thing here it is the only thing I ever order. The oriental salad with the macadamia nut chicken. The dressing is the perfect amount and I love the crispy chicken with the crunchy cabbage. I am not a sushi fan at all but my husband always enjoys his dishes. I did have a blushing geisha cocktail that was to die for. But at almost ten dollars I thought it was over priced. The red velvet cake did taste like a freezer, that was my first time ordering desert there and most likely my last time."}
{"text":"Decent food at a decent price. For a chain it's pretty solid. I've hit this place for happy hour a time or two after wandering around the mall and it serves it's purpose. Decent specials, friendly service, pretty good food. Sushi was tasty, not on par with some other restaurants near by (Stingray, Geisha a go go) but freshly made and good flavor. Attentive staff help with recommendations and keep your glass full. I wouldn't make this place a destination but if you work up an appetite shopping in Scottsdale you could do a lot worse."}
{"text":"Okay so, it's been a few years since we have eaten here.  The last experience was so-so but, after the movie we agreed to give it a go. We were SO pleasantly surprised, I just had to Yelp about it!! The first person we saw when we walked in was the GM, Bob...he greeted us with a warm smile and got us set up with a table outside. Next came Erica, our server. Erica was awesome. We fired our drink orders at her and she handled it with ease. She got us our beverages and let us be for the right amount of time. We ordered the lettuce wraps and a bunch of other stuff off of the \"happy hour\" menu and before we knew it, everything we ordered was right in front of us. We are on a low carb lifestyle and the lettuce wrap chicken/shrimp seemed to have some kind of sweetness to it and were like, uh-oh.  Just then the GM, Bob came over and we told him about the sweet sauce not a good thing for low carb eaters.  He immediately said we could get this wonderful mixer without the sauce.  Bingo!!  Great customer service!! The rest of our experience and food was outstanding.  Kudos to GM, Bob and Erica our server!!   Thanks for changing our minds about your Kona Grill.  We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Great place for tourists and locals alike!   Angela was a wonderful server and definitely understands customer service.  Our first visit and as locals we will be back!"}
{"text":"Just ate at Kona grill for lunch at the sushi  bar  was so fresh and it came up very fast and the chef is amazing and I would highly recommend for sushi as far as the other area of the bar I have not had that great experiences supercalifragilisticexpialidocious OK"}
{"text":"Excellent service as always! Ryan was very helpful and quick! Food was amazing, I love the avocado egg rolls and flatbreads! Everyone is always very friendly and professional. Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"I have a wonderful lunch there today with the hubby and may I say that the food is always good and we don't have to wait that long for the food to come out. Our server was wonderful made sure we have what we needed. Very thorough and quick, especially on a weekend they are always very busy.  No complain on our part. Always a pleasure to eat here. I hope it wont change."}
{"text":"I love this place because of the outside patio and all-day happy hour on Sunday. Good environment, good food, and good service to go along with it. I always get the sushi and a cocktail. If you are looking for a good place to go for lunch or dinner on Sunday, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Sushi roll (Wave Roll) was delicious and tasted  very fresh. Would go back!"}
{"text":"I love Kona grill! The sushi is always amazing and tasty. The Picasso roll, checkerboard roll, and sunshine roll are some of my favorites. Appetizers are also yummy like the potstickers and chicken satay. The atmosphere is nice and modern love the huge fish tank.. Happy hour is great too!!"}
{"text":"Rarely give a restaurant 5 stars. This one is lacking nothing. Service was incredible, atmosphere is fun and the food is amazing. We had a larger group so we ordered a variety of dishes. Everyone was happy with their selections even our pickiest eater."}
{"text":"the food was incredible, we got sliders, avocado egg rolls, and macadamia nut chicken. however the service was borderline rude. we felt criticized for not splurging on alcoholic drinks at lunch... the waitress seemed new but that is no excuse to be rude! i would only get takeout here in the future."}
{"text":"Happy hour and otherwise is a Good time in Asian cuisine . I started out with a good margarita blended . Recommend the calamari appetizer . The tuna ahi wontons were amazing . Wanted more but had to leave room for the grand slice of snickers ice cream pie ."}
{"text":"Kona is a go to place for us but is hit or miss on how the food comes out. Sometimes it's perfect...not always. They no longer have the fruity Cosmo drink which is a total bummer...so during HH I only get water because there is nothing exciting/fruity to order. Overall we enjoy kona for their crab crunch rolls, calamari and potstickers!! :)"}
{"text":"This place is still a Solid Happy hour place. Especially when the weather is nice outside. They have a new happy hour menu with some diet conscious drinks and food. Awesome place, great neighborhood that will not break the bank.   $3 and $5 for select food.  $3 - $7 for HH drinks Good sushi items!  Fish Tacos and calamari is awesome.  Cute bartender named Christy SAT and SUN day!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been to Kona many times and I must say that the food is consistantly good.  The sushi is exceptional as is the service.  The Patio remains a staple place for Summerlin moms to get turnt.  Always providing a fun party atmosphere.  For a more subdued experience the dining area inside the restaurant is the place for you.    My only issue is with the restrooms.  I don't know that I've ever used their restrooms and found them clean.  They are always in need of some attention and are a constant source of dissapointment when dining at Kona.  So much so that recently members of our party opted to leave so that they could use the facilities just down the sidewalk at Panera.  That speaks volumes."}
{"text":"My staff was invited to the private grand opening by John.  He was extremely hospitable.  The food was great and the service was good. The portions were generous.  We will definitely return."}
{"text":"This location is brand new, but has most of all the same specials as the other locations. Manny the bartender and Lane the server were friendly. Great patio and atmosphere. Worth a visit."}
{"text":"Kona grill was my favorite happy hour spot! I have been dining at this restaurant for over 5 years and it is one of my favorites. The happy hour prices were fantastic! You could get a delicious margarita flat bread pizza that is mouth watering for $5. They also have wonderful sushi rolls and very reasonable prices. The atmosphere is fun and laid back. Beware that showing up right at 5-6 during happy hour is prime time and seats are very limited! It has recently been renovated and happy hour prices did increase. It is still worth visiting, but not as good as a deal as it used to be."}
{"text":"We had an amazing waitress that took great care if us.  We only did sushi, and it was all amazing.... The dragon toll,  rainbow roll,  coconut crab roll and tuna tower were all outstanding. I definitely recommend this place,  it made for a great date night!"}
{"text":"Had a great experience at Kona Grill last night. Happy hour 3 to 7 Friday night . I knew it would be busy on the patio ..but. The staff was amazing helpful patient the place was buzzing and they were all great Grace got us a drink while waiting for a table. Christian was attentive  ( remembered us from previous visit.) There are 2 gentleman 1 is Christian I think the other is Grace that work together like pros made everything smooth. Bob the asst. Manager was friendly kind and very gracious. I have a broken foot and everyone took great getting us situated. And food was great as always .The new Gouda fondue is very good  and the frozen Margaritas best in town. Great experience all around. Thanks to all of you at Kona Grill !"}
{"text":"This place never fails me. And sushi chef Juan is super helpful and attentive. I told him what I was craving and he picked the perfect thing. Everything I wanted and so much more!"}
{"text":"Worthless sushi. I can't believe the kind of sushi these people get away with. Took too long. Sushi was not fresh. Never coming here again"}
{"text":"Great for Happy hour, but the steak sandwich is delish! Their Margaritas are not as good as their neighbors (Z'Tejas) but they are strong enough to do the trick and pretty much have the price.  Staff is always great and we always have a great time here."}
{"text":"Good happy hour specials, staff however need to be friendlier and learn to smile and be polite not just when giving you the bill."}
{"text":"This is a hard review to write because on one end, they get very high marks, and on the other, bottom of the barrel.    Service was actually very good on Mother's Day, a day which could try even the best server's patience with large tables filled with children, parents and grandparents.  (There were quite a few of these.) - 4 stars    I love their salmon wasabi sashimi  topped with fresh wasabi root. It is one of my favorite sushi style dishes in the Valley -- 5 stars   My husband had two different rolls, the crab crunch and the soft shall crab.  I told him he would be disappointed compared to the rolls we normally have at our local Japanese restaurant in North Scottsdale, Toyama, but he insisted.  He was definitely bummed - 1 star  We also ordered the grilled veggie flatbread.  That was divine . . . so much so , I went back with my girlfriend today to have it again.  The flatbread is huge, about 6 x 14 inches and it was loaded with grilled mushrooms, zucchini, asparagus, pesto, mozzarella and balsamic vinegar. It's enough for two for lunch, or as a starter to share with the table. - 5 stars  Definitely a great place to go for sit-down in Scottsdale Fashion Square, but stay away from the rolls and stick with the main menu, except give the salmon wasabi sashimi a try. It is the only for sure on the sushi side!"}
{"text":"I'm teetering between three and four stars because the food and drinks here are excellent. Everything on the menu always seems so enticing, but honestly, I never stray from the happy hour selection (more about that in a minute). But I'd have to go with the three stars because the service isn't always the best at this location. I feel like  it's hit or miss. Either we get decent service, or we're forgotten. But maybe that's what I get for sitting in the bar during the packed happy hour.  Right, happy hour. It's one of the better in town, food-wise. Pretty much everything on their HH menu is half-priced during the twice daily happy hours. I went to the 3:00 start yesterday, and the bar was packed already! By the time I left, everyone was borderline hammered... and it wasn't even 5 p.m. yet. My favorite orders off that menu are the sushi rolls and flatbreads. You can get good sushi for $3-4 a roll during HH! And they have a big selection of decently-priced drinks. From cocktails, to sake bombs, and good ol' beers on tap, this is a happy hour not to miss! Just don't expect the service to be out of this world every time. The bar does have a high tolerance for loud groups too, so people come here to enjoy good food and get rowdy. For this reason, I prefer to sit on the patio."}
{"text":"Always come here for their happy hour. Ahi wonton crisps and avocado rolls are the choice items.  It does get quite busy for happy hour and you have to fight and/or stalk a table to get a seat.  Otherwise, great food, great prices."}
{"text":"Only been there once but so far so good! We had about a party of 40.. Great service and great food! They made up special menus and it was great! The lobster mac-n-cheese was amazing! I loved everything about this place.!"}
{"text":"As previously mentioned before, the happy hour at Kona Grill (3-7pm) is awesome. 8 pieces of sushi for $3? Can't get better than that. I had the Atlantic Roll and Fiery Shrimp Roll and they were both absolutely delicious, I could've eaten it all day. For dessert I shared the Ultimate Fudge Brownie and the thing is HUGE. Its a gigantic piece of brownie, with a scoop of ice cream on top and raspberries as well. There could have been a little more ice cream, but otherwise it was great.  The only downside was that the sushi order was messed up, and they brought the shrimp and california rolls, but they had out the Atlantic within 3-4 minutes."}
{"text":"Avocado egg rolls, chicken satay, sushi rolls, pizzas, chicken romaine wraps...all for less/over $20?! Try their happy hour specials, 3-7pm and 9-11pm.  Their happy hour specials are great value but very LIMITED selections, especially the sushi rolls. That said, the sushi isn't really fantastic. Nice atmosphere, though. Kona has an outside patio where most of the happy hour crowd sits. It gets pretty busy. Friendly servers without rude service."}
{"text":"I have never encountered a restaurant such as this inside of a shopping mall but I was very surprised. I was very impressed to see that the kitchen staff used gloves while cooking the food. There was a beautiful aquarium near the sushi bar. I don't think that there is a breakroom for the staff, however, because those that were on break were milling about near the kitchen talking and joking around. It really ruined the atmosphere of our dinner.  The food was tasty however the sushi was bland. I've had much better at actual sushi restaurants.  If I ever find myself back in the Scottsdale area again I'll probably eat here."}
{"text":"First time coming here.  I've heard good things about it and some coworkers and I wanted to check it out. The setting was really nice and modern with a touch of cool and classy on the side. They had a table ready for us and our waitress Jamie was awesome! She was super attentive and made us feel welcome. The food was fantastic and reasonably priced (Calamari for an appetizer and Thai noodles for the entrée). I would recommend this place for any one looking for a nice place to entertain some friends while having some great upscale Asian American cuisine."}
{"text":"A friend and I tried here the other day and i wasn't impressed. I thought it was too dark and the service was all out of whack especially considering the fact that the place was practically empty.  The hostess and the runner seemed to be frenimies and it was a lil ackward! We sat down and looked at the unnecessarily complicated menu... nothing really outstanding. The usual overprices Japanese-y selection with the occasional hit of Hawaiian... but it was just Americanized Japanese cuisine. I've had Hawaiian food, its wonderful... what the heck was this?   The people there kept giving us the once over and threw their nose in the air... just to get a lil revenge, we put our Louis Vuitton and Tiffany bags on the table and went over our recent purchases (those reviews coming soon!) and the looks of snobby angst turned to jealously like THAT! lol... I could see this attitude if it were some high priced exclusive resturant that required a jacket for dinner serivce... but a freakin' wanna-be Hawaiian that's in a MALL?!? Are you serious?! Ugh Scottsdale! *eye roll*  I had the rainbow roll and the dumplings, they were good, decent. No serious complaints, but still not great and stellar. I don't think I'll go back and sit in the resturant. I think I'll go to my local sushi place down the way from my place. Same food, same quality, different price! To my yelpers I say: skip it, you're not missing much... and though it may be Scottsdale, do you REALLY expect to find a good meal at a freakin' mall??"}
{"text":"Always busy. A bit of funky smell every time at the bar but I love the food there and service is very average due to it being busy all the time. Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Patrick, the manager, is amazing.  He's able to bring smiles to faces.  If you are having a rough day (or if you just want to end your day on a high note) I would highly recommend going here, they will definitely turn your day around.  Food is great and service is great as well."}
{"text":"Love it here! Spontaneously stopped in here while out shopping with my family and we couldn't have been happier with our experience. The staff was on their a game and so polite. My husband ordered some sushi and the miso soup. I ordered the chicken satay and we got our son the chicken tenders with Mac n cheese/french fries. Every single item exceeded our expectations. The chicken satay was so delicious that we almost ordered a second round had we not been so full! My son rarely eats his entire meal but devoured the entire thing. The kids Mac n cheese wasn't just your standard boxed Mac n cheese... It was so great I had to steal a few bites! The waiter was very attentive and helpful with choosing what to order. I highly recommend coming here. My husband and I live across town but will go out of our way to come back. I also recommend trying the jasmine green tea. I don't like ice tea but after trying my husbands I had to order one for myself. Great experience!"}
{"text":"Great lunch with family.  Miso soups and sushi for most.  Roast beef sandwich for one kid and chicken fingers for another.  Great service.  Very warm and friendly.  Server was Grey.  Ask for him."}
{"text":"When I went to Kona Grill for lunch today it was clean and the staff / management was very friendly. I got the Kona Chopped their signature salad. I was not impressed. The tomatoes were so old the skin was falling off  and greens were not fresh. I wouldn't recommend this place  for food but is has a nice atmosphere. That's why I gave it a  3 star instead of two."}
{"text":"This place is terrible! To be honest the food was great, the service on the other hand was awful. Our waitress from the get go was extremely rude, we had a party of 11 and had multiple people coming. At one point we had to get drinks from the bar because the waitress was missing for long periods of time. Towards the end of the night (keep in mind the restaurant was empty) she decided the best decision was to sit a row away from our table and start chatting with the other employees. All in all bad experience not even the manager could make it right."}
{"text":"I dined at the Kona Grill twice while visiting from Northern CA.  First was April 9th at about 9:30 p.m with 4 friends; second was April 13th at about 3:30 p.m. with just 2 of us  Both times we sat on the patio (3rd table from the small gate I believe) unaware of happy hour.  We didn't care what we were spending.  I think perhaps the management needs to address training.  Neither server seemed to care that we were there.  We received adequate service but the ONLY time we got a smile or felt the least bit valued was when they brought us the check. Of course...we are about to tip them.  None of us either visit felt valued.  To those servers (who will remain nameless here; you know who you are) you are not doing us a favor waiting on us; we are doing you a favor choosing your restaurant.  A smile and some enthusiasm will go a long way and help line your pockets.  You are in a service industry and should be trying to sell food (get your average check UP)....act like it.  Food was good but stop with the \"crab mix\".  Increase the price and use the real thing. Also, I had 2 appletinis both visits (specifically: Skyy, a splash of Apple and nothing else). The second time (again) I was very specific; both cocktails had cherries.  Not a big deal but you are supposed to be listening to us.  Overall, the first visit was a little better than the second.  If you are having a bad day, we don't care.  Leave the attitude at the door when you start your shift."}
{"text":"This will be my last time to this location ... I've been here b4 when happy hour was going on ... And not but I surely had no idea it was based on where you are seated  and unlike other customer I wasn't told while walking in !!!!"}
{"text":"Very veeeeeery good food! Decent service :) All day happy hour in Sundays :) lovely patio ! love all that :)"}
{"text":"For those of you you who have had a bad experience at this restaurant in the past I encourage you to give it another try.   I have been back three times since the grand reopening and wow, what a difference. The food and service has been top notch every time. Can't go wrong sea bass or macadamia chicken, both amazing dishes."}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday celebration with my boss and his wife. Decor is very nice, kind of like a lounge. We ordered the kona filet steak, miso sake sea bass  and the sweet chili glazed salmon.  For appetizer we had the chicken and shrimp romain lettace wraps which were good. The filet steak was very tender and the miso salmon was cooked perfectly.   There was a mistake in our order (my boss ordered the strip but ended up with the filet steak) but Chris our waiter was more then happy to adjust our meal. The manager even came to apologize personally. The service alone made me boost the rating one star.   For dessert, the boss man and his wife shared an ultimate fudge brownie and I had the red velvet cupcake. What I liked was there were two sizes of dessert, one size for yourself and one size to share. I should have gotten something else since the red velvet cupcake was dry and stale tasting.   Overall, I don't think I would come back because the food was decent but nothing extraordinary."}
{"text":"We called at about 7 on a Saturday night and were told there's no wait. Walked in with 2 kids and were seated within a few feet of the patio door, which is open. It was 50 degrees outside last night - the wind was blowing in right toward the tables. The kids were freezing so we went back up front and asked for a different table. We waited 10 mins only to be seated 2 tables from the original seating. We were told it's warmer. It was still uncomfortably cold. Adults refused seating at these tables. People were wearing jackets inside. We complained to wait staff and no one would close the door. Our food was just ok. My wine never came, I reminded the waitress. The manager finally brought it when we were almost done with dinner. I declined it and asked for the door to be closed - she said no, it must stay open. What's the plan when it's 115 degrees outside?  We just wanted to pay and get the heck out of there. Their other locations have always been great."}
{"text":"Very cool environment but the worst and slowest service. If you go just plan on drinks."}
{"text":"To be honest I might be bias since Kona Grill is where I first tried sushi but still one of the best when it comes to quality of food."}
{"text":"Good food & service I was pleasantly surprised at the kids meals just $6 and served in a cute bento box with healthy choices  a main course 2 sides and fruit cup shaped like a teddy bear, super cute!"}
{"text":"We all had different items from sushi to chicken. It was all amazing. Our server was friendly and fast. The prices are a little high but we thought the food was worth it! The coconut shrimp roll is amazing!!"}
{"text":"Love coming here. The two sushi chefs behind the sushi bar on Friday nights are my favorite. Always super great and attentive. They always have my order memorized and perfect every time! :)"}
{"text":"Amazing flavorful food. Ordered the potstickers, avacado egg rolls, yamada roll, and the Atlantic roll. All items were delicious. We would definitely return again the next time in Vegas."}
{"text":"I was just in here a few weeks ago with my boyfriend and my experience was just atrocious.  It was a nice day out so we wanted to sit out on the patio.  We sat ourselves at a small high top table next to the bar.  We should've known to leave when no one greeted us or brought us menus after we had been seated for about 5 minutes.  It looked like business was steady, but by no means were they busy or understaffed.    We finally got menus and we ordered drinks and an appetizer to start with.  It took quite a while to get our drinks, which sat on the bar counter for quite some time.  My boyfriend ordered a whiskey ginger, but whatever was brought out was definitely not that.  I know some bars try to make their own gingerale, but this was nowhere close.  It tasted like a whiskey sour - with a TON of sour.  We are talking margarita amounts.  We sent it back and he ordered a different drink instead.  We had probably been sitting at our table for close to 20 minutes before even ordering our main meal, and that was not due to us not knowing what we wanted.  Right before our sushi arrived, a wine bottle dropped off of a table about 20 feet away from our table, and I was shocked at how many employees just sat there gawking and how long it took before someone finally walked over there to help this lady with her broken bottle of wine.  All the employees sat around the server station (really close to us) and just kept huddling together and talking about it.  Really inappropriate.  Our sushi came roughly about 5 minutes after the wine ordeal.  The employee who dropped it off at our table was so eager to go talk to other employees about what had happened that they didn't even care to ask us if we needed anything else, or to notice that we did not have any utensils or chop sticks at our table to eat our meal with.  We had to flag someone down to even start eating our meal.  The sushi was sub-par but I had already expected that.  The 2nd star on this review is because the spinach artichoke dip was delicious.  If not for that I would've given this place 1 star."}
{"text":"I went here a few weeks ago with a group of 6.  The patio was packed, so we had to sit inside...of course there was no happy hour inside so that was a major bummer.  There is plenty on the menu to choose from...I go the chicken pad thai and it was okay.  It had a strange flavor to it...I think there was black beans in it...and it was slightly smokey.  Not your typical pad thai and definately not what I was expecting.    Food-wise I'd give it a 2, and I wouldn't go back for dinner.  Not all that good, especially for how expensive it is.   I'm giving this place a 3 because I hear the happy hour is pretty amazing, and from the look of the happy hour menu it is!  Next time I'll plan on going a little earlier, and just the two of us so it's easier to get a seat."}
{"text":"Extremely slowwwwwwwwwww!!! Hit and miss with this place. Here now and it's dead. Waited at least 20 minutes just for service to acknowledge us, then another 17 minutes to get us 1 beer and one Bloody Mary."}
{"text":"We've  been there many times.  Happy Hour is great. ..in the bar area.  Lots of apps to choose from.  We make sure we get there at the beginning of the happy hour because it gets busy and fills up quickly.  Service is hit &miss...but the overall experience is good. Parking garage is across the street which is helpful. They take reservations in the dining area. Only drawback is...it get extremely noisy, when busy."}
{"text":"Really great sushi - the bama roll is amazing has a good kick to it!  I am really picky about sushi and this place never fails.  They have a good happy hour - really great deals!  We recommend this location to everyone."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years, they have one of the best happy hours in town in my opinion, but I just don't know anymore. Newly remodeled with an extended patio and second floor. It looks very hip and modern. The prices are good and I really enjoy the BBQ chicken flatbread along with the Moscow mules on Happy hour. Sliders and rolls are all good too. The service just continues to get worse and worse however. Lauren was my server most recently and after waiting for 50 minutes for a sushi roll, she brought a different tables sushi to us, then took it back after realizing her mistake. Not once did she apologize, it was almost like she avoided our table because she knew she messed up. AN HOUR AND 10 MINUTES after ordering, we finally got our first plate, and the entire meal came staggered. Water and drinks were empty the whole meal, never got offered a refill. It was so bad that I actually wanted to walk out and I've never done that. The lady manager kindly apologized (I'm glad someone did) but our experience had already been ruined at that point. There's way too many other options in Las Vegas- even in the same shopping center- that you can get good food AND service at."}
{"text":"Food was below average. The bbq chicken flat bread was too sweet, way too much bbq sauce. The sushi was okay. Pasta was under seasoned and absolutely bland. Overall, the food quality was extremely poor.   Service was again very mediocre. Our server didn't show much enthusiasm. Just did the job. Didn't know much about the menu either.   Was excited to try the place out because it looks really nice from the outside. What a waste!"}
{"text":"LOVE the Kona Grill!  It is one of our favorite places to go to dinner and it never disappoints!   Order the \"Las Vegas Sushi Roll\" and \"Macadami Nut Chicken\".... YUM!!!  That is what we get pretty much every time we go.  :)"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great food , friendly and attentive server. Hostess could have been more enthusiastic and friendly , but she seemed like she does not like her job at all."}
{"text":"They have good food, it is a little pricy for take out, but I haven't eaten at the location.  I would recommend the wasabi sauce, shrimp, and fried rice are all amazing."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is nice but service was slow . Staff could have been more attentive . Slightly disappointing. Tasty drinks and bar service."}
{"text":"As a mall employee I order food from here quite regularly and Shirley is AMAZING! A++ service. She is always willing to go above and beyond and is so sincerely accommodating. The food is also always delicious, especially the chicken club and sushi."}
{"text":"Went here for a quick lunch a few days ago. It was our first time here, and our waitress was very friendly and assisted us with choosing a good sushi (me and a friend had only had sushi a few times and still needed some help choosing a non-raw fish one) The service was very nice and the food came out very quickly and was very good. Will be returning here again"}
{"text":"Okay, I am definitely a Konavore.  I go here at least 3 times a month for happy hour and it never disappoints.  Last night was my birthday, so to celebrate we went (sans kids!!!!!) to happy hour.  We had the fiery shrimp and california roll, calamari, avocado roll, and vegetarian roll as well as a few ladies margaritas and Kirins.    The service is always top notch and the food delicious.   Getting a table is another matter, but we always seem to luck out. Though my husband hates standing over people waiting for them to leave :-)"}
{"text":"There are so many Japanese restaurants that are so far superior that you should just skip this place. Here's my latest and last experience: We walked in and the hostess was kneeling down below the reception counter. When she saw us, did she spring up? Of course, she stayed hidden until I finally asked if we could be seated. We went to the sushi counter. Did we get menus? No. Did we get chopsticks? No. Did we get napkins? No. Did anybody take our order? No. I finally \"interrupted\" the sushi chef to order. A simple order of tuni sashimi, tako and unagi. Did it ever arrive? No. I sat there while he made 4 other orders for those seated in the restaurant. When he started on another order, I interrupted and asked him if my order was in process? He looked at me blankly... He disappeared and returned with Tuna sashimi. I'm not sure where it came from and then tako. Unagi never made it to me. Sushi was average at best. I didn't bother ordering anything else. So many other better places! Go elsewhere...."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and probably my last.  I went with a very large meet-up group and service was paaaaaainfullly slow.  C'mon managers, when you have a large group, staff it appropriately!!   Drinks took forever to get there and getting the bill was just as painful.    BTW, you might ask your server what they do with your credit card once you give it to them.  Our server put ours in a huge batch with others in her pocket and then asked me to pick out which one was mine.  No ID check at all.  Really?      Too many other restaurants around here that have better service - pass."}
{"text":"Horrible experience. Had to request for hot water repeatedly. Was chased to settle payment even before we could complete our meal. And if all of that was not bad enough, we were handed the bill of another table that was more than double what we had to pay. Not professional at all. And the last straw was that they actually have the audacity to specify a scale on the bill  showing the amount of tips that they expect you to pay. Needless to say, these are way over and above the industry standards. They expect exorbitant tips for disgraceful service and try to put you on a guilt trip if you are unwilling to pay their specified scale. Name of our server was Louis, if that's any help. Would never ever go back.. Would rather stay hungry than go back to Kona on the strip. Horrible experience in a place where we've been treated exceedingly well in all the other restaurants that we went to on the strip.."}
{"text":"Food is good, service is great.  The atmosphere is much better since the remodel.  Love the angry edamame and the lobster roll."}
{"text":"Came in to kona grill for the first time as we intended to eat at the Cheesecake Factory but the wait was too long. So glad it was. Food and service were awesome! I had the avocado rolls which are a favorite of mine at cheesecake. Kona's was better! Will be back again. My daughter loved it as well"}
{"text":"Great restaurant! I first came to this restaurant in 2006 and the best part I liked is the HAPPY HOUR! Really nice ambiance inside and out. Cool place to relax and down some sake. The price isn't cheap and its not too expensive. If your not too hungry - just order from the appetizer menu its very full filling! esp during the happy hour its a lot cheaper too.   I really like the location. Located at Boca Park in Summerlin. So if you live near the area check it out and for anyone who wants to get away from the Las Vegas \"strip\" and the hype then definitely."}
{"text":"We sat at the bar waiting for the rest of our party to arrive.  Ordered a Drink, the service at the bar was fine. When our friends arrived we moved outside on the patio. There were other people sitting near us. The wait staff was getting drinks, meals, and checks etc for the other tables.  We were totally ignored.  We waited at least 20 minutes.  Still no service.  We walked out. I told the hostess and she just looked at me and said \"sorry\".  Going down hill.  Too bad."}
{"text":"Took 45 minutes to get our food. The kids ordered Mac and Cheese, wife ordered salmon and I ordered the spicy tuna roll. Why the delay? No explanation, just an apology and they comped the Mac and Cheese. Unfortunately we won't be back. Service here in the past has been brutal... Too bad."}
{"text":"Watch your drink orders here - the bartenders squirt eye drops in your drinks if they don\"t like you - which makes you very sick!!"}
{"text":"Fun place to go for happy hour.  Their sushi is very creative and all the appetizers we have tried are very good too.  Service has been hit-or-miss.  The last time we went I tried the steak and lobster roll.  It is not on the happy hour menu, but it sounded intriguing.  It was delicious and I recommend you try it if you don't mind eating a little raw beef."}
{"text":"Good happy hour prices.  But food is just ok.  It's obvious chain like sushi \"Asian\" food.  Nothing exciting.  Drink menu is good.  Vibe is fun, loud, super social.  Lots of sports on the TVs.  Great for socializing & just being out."}
{"text":"Most of the meal (sushi and sea bass) was good. The veggies with the sea bass were inedible. No big deal but when they redid it (15 minutes later), it was still bad. We told the nice waiter. He relayed the problem to the manager, Patrick.   We waited for Manager Patrick to make an appearance. Nope. Two tables of patrons in the whole restaurant but no Patrick. We waited and waited. No Patrick. Lousy, lousy manager.   On the way out, we met Manager Nick. He was awesome. We usually enjoy Kona Grill, but uneven performance from kitchen and management was disappointing. Patrick is a HUGE detriment. They must be desperate and/or foolish if they keep him on."}
{"text":"Never had a bad meal here. Sushi has always been fresh and the happy hour drinks are great. Love there Salmon Salad!"}
{"text":"Went in on a Sunday when there is happy hour all day. I had the calamari and trio tacos, both were delicious. My girlfriend had the sliders that were great except the pickles were bad. After we removed them and added ketchup and mustard it was great. Our waiter Tyrone was an excellent waiter and always checked on us without being overbearing. This is a great place to have HH at the bar or patio on a lovely day."}
{"text":"Had the worse food and service today . Will be a long time Before I go back there :(.  Was my favorite place"}
{"text":"If you can get past the service wait from your waiter or the 2 waiters coming one after another trying to help you with the same service, or just the wait....then you're in for a decent ride at Kona Grill.   First of all, the first time I came here with my sister (maybe about a year or two ago), we sat down and was not serviced or acknowledged until about half an hour later. We were going to leave (surprised we didn't) but we decided to give it a chance. So we've decided to give this place another shot.  Well, we waited about five minutes (not as bad as before) and our waiter came and asked for our drinks. About a minute after him, another waitress came by and asked for our drinks again...we were confused and clearly, they did not have that plan out.  Secondly, know the location of the restaurant, I knew it wasn't going to be cheap. However, we were celebrating the fact that one of my good friends got into law school; so I figured, why not? I just wished the quality of the food met the expectation of the prices. When the food arrived, it looked really good; I was excited! However, the calamari was a little too greasy and not enough crunchiness; the vegas roll had too much sauce. The only thing that was pretty good was the pad thai; but would you pay $15.50 for an okay portion of pad thai? I wouldn't; but I did since one of us wanted it.   I liked our waiter, he was an ex-Wildcat! Woohoo! He was nice enough to give us the creme brulee on the house (i think it was our charmed that he fell for :P); so I gave him a nice tip.   If you ask me if I would come here again...the answer would be yeah. However, not anytime soon."}
{"text":"Well first off the sushi is ok but a major pet peeve of mine is when cold sushi is put on a hot plate and it makes it warm-ish. Sushi combo plate was so weak it's not even funny, 8 pieces of California roll, 1 piece salmon, 1 piece of tuna, 1 piece shrimp and a salad with freaking blue cheese on it?!? Anyways, potstickers were good and the edamame was great(but pretty salty). Here is the kicker of the whole evening that will insure I never go back. My friend left his brand new iPhone 5 on the table by accident, came back literally 2 minutes later and it was gone. Table had been cleared and no phone in sight. We asked the manager about it and very rudely, and almost annoyed with us, just kept reiterating that nothing was turned in and that her entire staff had been there 10 years with no incident. Really? That's a lie just in the fact that our waitress was probably 22 so she would have been working since 12 years of age. Nice! The manager did not apologize even once for the situation. Very disappointed in the way she handled it."}
{"text":"Excellent service always at this location. Enjoyed a beautiful birthday dinner tonight with an amazing server. Great atmosphere. This is always by far my FAVORITE sushi place. EVER."}
{"text":"Yummy sushi, the husband and I were on our way to one spot when we stopped to check out the menu here, no regrets here! Staff and food were amazing!"}
{"text":"Have always loved Kona but really had a bad experience. Rude waitress and dirty glasses and silverware.  Waitress spilled a drink and didn't even apologize."}
{"text":"First time here and loved everything, chicken satay, jalapeno yellowtail sashimi appetizers and entrees macadamia chicken and Kona churrasco steak all so yummy!"}
{"text":"Husband and I went to happy hour tonight. What a great deal and delicious selection of food for happy hour. We had a couple of sushi rolls, sliders and chicken and shrimp lettuce wraps. Service was friendly and prompt. We sat at the bar, which is our typical spot. I would have given 5 stars however I was disappointed that the virgin mojitos were $5. A virgin mojito is simply sprite, lime juice and mint! Virgin mojito was more than the drinks on Happy hour. Overall good spot!"}
{"text":"Totally disappointed at this dinning experience, the food here even worse than the school cafeteria. Not worth to spend money in here."}
{"text":"I love this place... I've been here so many times I can't even help. Today I went with my sister for a fun lunch and we had the best cucumber three amigos sushi rolls! Light and refreshing! Followed by the calamari and we finished with splitting the salmon salad with me so dressing... Our favorite and it was no disappointment this time as well! Our server nick la bomb was great and super attentive! We will be back... Again and again and again..."}
{"text":"Jennifer had amazing suggestions along with awesome wine pairing. Great food as always... But now elevated to a different level with their new menu. You can go in the bar and try their new menu... The three amigos sushi was the bomb!"}
{"text":"Extra star for great service! Our server, Erin, was so pleasant and accommodating. Fantastic service from her!  Came here for lunch with a friend and her toddler. They put the toddler's order in first so that her food would come out faster. Very thoughtful! They also encouraged her to \"visit\" the fish in the fish tanks which she loved.  Pineapple honey mojito was BOMB!  Our food (chicken caprese sandwich with sweet potato fries for my friend and a shrimp sushi roll for me) was good. It wasn't spectacular, but it was good. The sushi roll was a little expensive - $10 for 5 pieces - but I enjoyed it.   I would come back for their happy hour!"}
{"text":"Kona Grill is not at all what I remember growing up!!  Our server was friendly so that's a plus. However, food wise, ICK! I've ordered sushi this time & 1 other time previously, (different items on menu) and they were both the most flavorless sushi I think I have ever had. I'm not generally picky about sushi either, because I usually think everything is good. This was not!!! And for the price?? I don't think Kona should serve sushi...it is just not up to par compared to other places around here.. NORI SUSHI= YUM! Located in Desert Ridge Marketplace  My fiance' had pad thai which they couldn't make more spicy because \"We don't want you to say it's too spicy then decide to bring it back.\" HUH?? Not very accommodating?? I feel like if you have pad thai on your menu, you should offer different ranges of spicy for people who are ordering it.. As predicted, wasn't spicy at all (Using hot sauce does not have the same effect as when it's cooked in extra spices).  Luckily we were a few drinks in so it didn't matter too much at the time, just disappointing. I will stick to thai places for the pad thai, and sushi places for sushi. Maybe Kona grill again if I want, like, chicken?? Wait, I can make that easily myself. Oh well"}
{"text":"I haven't written many reviews about anything here or any other website but I feel compelled to write one for Kona Grill.   While in Vegas we wanted sushi and so  we sought out help from Yelp. The reviews for this place were excellent. But I have the habit of reading the poor reviews so I can get an idea of why people don't like a particular place. Let me just say this, if you're coming to a sushi restaurant for a burger or a chicken sandwich and they don't serve you the best sandwich you've ever had who's fault is that? Yours! I don't go to a steak house and ask for sushi, why would you go to a sushi restaurant and get upset because your burger wasn't the best?   As for the food here...excellent!! We started with the Angry Edamame. Edamame tossed with a citrus and chili sauce. I enjoy citrus so I liked it. The first roll was the Spicy Tuna roll. A good roll with good flavor and quality tuna. The second roll was the Picasso. An excellent roll topped with a slice of jalapeño with a citrus flair, again, I like citrus so this was a favorite of mine. It also came with a Japanese relish that was great! The third roll was the Spider roll, soft shell crab and a nice glaze over the top. Our group favorite was the Voodoo roll. So much flavor and a little kick at the end.  All of it was so good.   Some of the complaints were that the rolls weren't very tight. This may be true but the pieces were small enough that you were able to enjoy each one without wrestling with the roll.   So in summary, don't come here for a burger, come for the sushi!"}
{"text":"Bomb.Org!! Highly recommend you check this place out of you love sushi and you're near Fashion Show. Service was excellent and atmosphere was relaxing. The sushi was delicious and the Las Vegas roll is my favorite here. Eat at this place and you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I made a reservation advance of two weeks and than went there to get seated. But instead was told they gave my table away to someone else. What also pissed me off was that she said you can go look for a table outside. Wow horrible service"}
{"text":"This chain restaurant has a good happy hour. That is until you look around and realize every view is a parking lot. (Gilbert).  Of course the deals are so good, why not bring the whole family? I am not happy drinking sake bombers with lots of children looking at a parking lot, 'twas rather depressing."}
{"text":"We went to the restaurant after watching a show and there were only about 4 tables of people in the restaurant. The checkerboard roll was definitely worth a try! My mum had the miso-sake sea bass. She said it was really good too. The turkey burger though was nothing special, according to my dad."}
{"text":"Very noisy. Poor service.  Made a reservation and still had to wait almost 60 minutes for our entree. I would not recommend this place unless you have lots of time.  Kona Grill in Phoenix"}
{"text":"Go for happy hour! Haven't been in the main restaurant but happy hour is great. Good sushi and other things like dip and flat bread pizzas. Try the crab crunch roll. Voodoo roll is never the same heat wise so be prepared for spicy!!! Spinach and artichoke dip is a little runny but still good!"}
{"text":"I'm feeling very conflicted about giving this place 3 stars because the service was so bad. We sat for like 10 minutes without being acknowledged. The food is decent though and way better than what I had expected from mall sushi. Tasted fresh. Side note, they had no idea what a Roy Rogers is..."}
{"text":"Ordered a Greek salad to go. Paid $10.00. And this is what I was given. I didn't check the bag before leaving because I figured a salad wouldn't disappoint me. I get home, open the box, and see just little pile of cut up tomatos onions and a pinch of feta cheese. No lettuce in a salad? That's new to me. I wasted $10.00 on what.. not even $1.00 worth of produce and cheese?"}
{"text":"I love this place. It's truly a local spot that I have been coming to for years. I'm so glad that they expanded this location. Great food only typically come here for happy hour which is one of the best happy hours VEGAS has to offer."}
{"text":"The dining room was upscale & beautifully decorated with jazzy music in the background. The food was incredible with great variety & extremely fresh. Service was fair. A few blunders with timing between salad & dinner (they were on top of each other) and an unexpected ingredient in my salad that wasn't mentioned when I ordered. All in all, our waitress was friendly, pleasant & attentive.   For our entree we split the macadamia crusted chicken with mashed potatoes & green beans as it was fairly pricy ($19). Upon arrival & after the first bite though, we discovered it was worth every penny. Absolutely mouthwatering & flavorful with a delicious gravy & peach marmalade compote that added additional flare, complimenting the chicken wonderfully. Accompanying chunky mashed potatoes were also yummy with just the right amount of seasoning. Green beans were also good although a bit too crispy for my taste. Half portions were more than enough to satisfy two adults & the chef split them up beautifully in the kitchen for us.   We also had a Cesar salad that was disappointing because of anchovies hidden in the dressing. Who does that to Cesar salad! I thought it tasted fishy & when I asked the waitress she confessed to the anchovies saying this was \"authentic Cesar Dressing\" & made fresh daily. This added ingredient was NOT mentioned on the menu or by our server; an unfortunate oversight in my opinion cause I never would have ordered it had I known. I've had Cesar salad in hundreds of restaurants & none of them EVER snuck in Anchovies. Ewe :-(  Thankfully dinner & dessert completely made up for it. Topping the meal off, we had Raspberry Creme Brûlée' that was exquisite; absolute culinary perfection! It was a very light & fruity pudding with a thin, crispy top served with 3 fresh raspberries. Best dessert I've had in years! My only regret was not snapping a picture before devouring. Next time 4 sure..."}
{"text":"Great location at the Quarter with nice open air area and bustling Happy Hour.   Good service and atmosphere.  I like the sushi and they make good cocktails as well.  Very clean place too."}
{"text":"I used to love this place. The love started 7 years ago.  After several visits to several locations, the passion faded. I believe it wasn't my fault but oh well.  I had a couple of bad experiences and I quit going for a while.  In the last month I've been to the one in San Tan Valley and this one at Fashion Square and they've get better than the last couple of times.   I'm sure there's enough room to improve but I believe they're in the right track.  Time will tell.  Cheers"}
{"text":"Came twice in one week. Happy Hour is the time to come.  Managers are on the floor helping the servers. Food is great...The server suggested something on their secret menu and it was so so good.F*!k this place is delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Happened to be at the mall around 6:30pm and decided to go to Z'Tejas for dinner. It was a 25 min wait. Looked across the way and saw lots of open tables at Kona Grill. That ought to have registered as a red flag but since I was starving I guess my mental acuity was off. The hostess sat us in the back of the restaurant with a clear view of the hallway leading to the restrooms. We commented to our hostess that we were awful close to the restrooms. She chirped, yeah. End of discussion. I ordered a grey goose on the rocks, you know, vodka and ice in a glass. What I got back wasn't grey goose and it was mixed with soda, but it was in a glass though. My wife ordered a rib eye sandwich, medium. What she got was still breathing. My Korean chicken was almost warm but I attribute most of that to the spices. It was good but not great. I will say that our server was terrific and the manager did come by to check on us. This used to be a good spot but seems to be going through a transition period to become mediocre. Too bad."}
{"text":"This restaurant was a great find for us!  We were hungry and it was getting late for us. Figured we would try out a new place as we walked by. Happened to arrive at happy hour...and my husband and I ordered draft beer and four happy hour appetizers including fish tacos, potstickers, chicken lettuce wraps and shrimp tempura.  They were all fantastic....at a great price. And...the ambiance it wonderful.   Contemporary patio/lounge/restaurant areas. We will surely be back."}
{"text":"I am amazed that this place is still open! This restaurant is absolutely FILTHY.   I've eaten here on multiple occasions,  and each time, the food, service, and cleanliness is worse than the previous. Because of the nice ambiance and reasonably priced happy hour, I attempt to justify returning again, but without fail, this restaurant continues to disappoint. Not only is the floor covered in food and trash, the placemats are LITERALLY STUCK to the tables. I only noticed this after the table was haphazardly wiped down by one of their disgruntled employees, and I went to flip my placemat that was crusted with food debris. Big mistake. After prying it loose from the table, I find that I was apparently looking at the \"clean\" side. This has occurred not only once, but three times total.   Needless to say that at this point, I will no longer return. If this is the way the front of the house is maintained, I can only imagine the numerous health code violations in the back of the house. Extremely disappointing for a venue with ample potential.   Oh, and the service- horrific."}
{"text":"Ugh is all I want to say about my experience at Kona grill today. Unfortunately, this was my second bad experience with the food here. My party ordered the asparagus salad and a house salad with salmon. Both salads were not satisfactory. The lettuce was very wilted and disgusting. One salad was also soaked in dressing that made it unpleasant.  As usual, the drinks were a hit or miss. But the citrus punch was a winner today. Three stars only for the cute waiter, Amir! He was the bomb! Give him a raise.   My salads should have been comped btw. Barely touched my old lettuce dinner. Will come back for drinks ONLY & amir."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner during their happy hour, was not greeted when we entered. I had to ask the hostess where we could seat for happy hour she told me to grab what I need from the counter such as kids menu and dinner menu and it's open seating in the patio. I asked about seating at the roof top she said 21 and over only. I checked in here on yelp to get the free appetizer but server said I couldn't combine with my birthday reward, which didn't make sense. When we left the hostess didn't even smile nor say thank you or have a good night as we walk out the door."}
{"text":"Very clean and nice environment, which is expected and received at scottsdale quarter. I really appreciated the mixed staff instead of the overly flirty and attractive all girls wait staff that you find at a lot of places nearby. Food was really fresh and brought out promptly. Although the service was almost a little too fast! We came during happy hour and had one busser came by our table mid meal while we were both in the middle of the bite asking if he could take any plates but literally every plate on our table still had food on it as we were still eating. I politely told him thank you but that we were good at the moment. About 5-10 min later our server came by and picked up dishes, again we were still eating but some of the roll plates had become empty so at first I understood. But then he grabbed the personal sushi plate in front of my boyfriend literally as he was trying to maneuver the end piece of a loose roll into his mouth and asked if he wanted a fresh plate. I quickly said yes and put another plate on front of my bf and we carried on but my point is.. let people enjoy their time out and take their time eating instead of making us feel rushed to get out... please!!! We met here for happy hour after both of us had a long day at work so I wish the pace would have been as relaxed as the environment. Good food, good service, we'll be back again some day."}
{"text":"Came here last night during Happy Hour. We have been here quite a few times now. Always a nice experience I must say. I love the fish tank inside. It is very soothing!  Last night was a little cold, but one day it will be just right to sit on the Patio. Heheee Our service was prompt, all our food came out hot as well. I tried a Sangria they offer with Saki in it. I could not really taste the Saki, but it is good. Tacos are wonderful, since I do not eat Pork, they switched them out to fish and shrimp.  It is a great place to stop in anytime. But, Happy Hour is really nice."}
{"text":"My Mom and I ordered takeout tonight. We didn't get all of our food, and the sushi we got was terrible. It fell apart, and the eel smelled rancid. I have been in the hospital for a few days and my Mom wanted to treat me to sushi, sad it wasn't good. I don't know if we will ever go back. I called to talk to the manager about 25 minutes ago, and they left me on hold for 15 minutes. I guess they forgot about me ?"}
{"text":"Glad to be able to add a star to Kona.  New menu,  food back up to higher standard,  attentive staff and management.  Could be an addition to the regular dining rotation again.  For sure a couple more visits soon."}
{"text":"If its your first time going to this place make sure to look for Layne. He has excellent service and knows and good recommendations with regards to food. When you are around and likes Japanese food make sure to visit Kona grill."}
{"text":"I forgot how much I like Kona, having gone to several throughout the valley especially for reverse happy hour in Scottsdale.  The patio at the Chandler location is really chill.  Jalapeno yellowtail sushi and salmon wasabi sashimi are awesome from the Chef's menu... I'm so glad someone else ordered it during Happy Hour, cuz my cheap toosh probably wouldn't have.  Sooo good, will order those next time and eat it all for myself!"}
{"text":"gotta say that i love this place.  i go for lunch all the time.  the patio is great to sit on and relax after a long day of shopping.lol.  my husband wouldn't be so happy.  great food and a great happy hour."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner, we had the avocado egg rolls as an appetizer and the Pad Thai chicken has an entree. The portion was generous and delicious. Service was very good."}
{"text":"So how do you kill the best local's happy hour and fun spot? Remodel from a tight, cozy setting to hightop seats and tables with incredibly uncomfortable seats at the outdoor bar section. If raising prices by a lot and cutting items from HH menu weren't enough, they moved happy hour ending. back from 7pm to 6pm. The place used to be awesome but no longer. What a shame."}
{"text":"I new remodel looks amazing. I was super excited to get back and check it out and it does not disappoint! There are now 2 stories and the stairs kind of suck so take the elevator. The prices did go up ( I think about a dollar) but for the atmosphere and it being a new hot spot, I can swing it. The food was good, Upset that they got rid of the tacos however. Our server was Hunter who was great and seemed to want us to party because it was the opening week. Our drinks came out after a little bit of a wait, but we were assured by Hunter that the restaurant was still working out some kinks because it was new with all new staff. Management came by and checked on us which is always nice. We love this place and will continue to come back."}
{"text":"Best happy hour 3pm - 7 pm! Ask for Marco's secret menu...raspberry martini, grape faderaid, and the raspberry lemon drop shot."}
{"text":"Location, location, location...it's at a great location but I don't know if the food is to be raved for.    It's definitely a place to gather in groups and perhaps to be seen at but not so much for the food.  Price is decent but I've been to other places where it's consider mom & pop shop and had better and price is reasonable.    I ordered the pad thai and was very disappointed on the (lack of) flavor and the drink wasn't too impressive as the description had it.  I really can't say much for this venue.  It would not be a venue I would want to host an event and may think twice about attending a hosted event by friends.  I will probably go if it's hosted and I don't have to pay for anything.  I know it sounds bad but again, I think it's the location of the place that makes the place but once again I was very disappointed on the food and semi-lack of service."}
{"text":"Cool inside outside bar with misters. Very clean restrooms. The bartenders were all very friendly and quick to ask if you wanted a Cold beer. I ordered Shrimp Tempura Roll and it was delicious!  I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"I have always had good to great service here and the happy prices and rolls are right on time.  My favorite is the Bama roll-- add crunch and it has all the good stuff I crave."}
{"text":"Really good happy hour! Great ambience, good food, nice cold beer! Can't really go wrong unless u get bad service whe much that hasn't happened! Happy camper!"}
{"text":"After a long day of work, we all went to Kona Grill and were seated immediately. Our server Miles was awesome: he was on top of everything from drinks all the way through appetizers and our main courses. Good advice on eats, friendly and professional. I had the spider roll and the checkerboard roll both were spicy and very tasty.  Highly recommended for food, service and ambiance here in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Had a great time at Kona last couple times I've gone so am updating my review. Service was very friendly, and got good feedback from waitress when I asked for suggestions. They have a new coconut Mojito that is to die for. There was no wait, we were served promptly and the food got to our table surprisingly fast. The food was really light, and healthy, veggies cooked just right.  Seems like a great place for happy hour too. Good job Kona!"}
{"text":"Love the City North area -- not so crazy about the Kona Grill there...  I guess its pretty typical, I've eaten at only one Kona Grill that I thought was good for food.  My hubby and I had drinks there - just ok.  The beef noodle dish truly was like I opened a bag of ramen noodles from the store and added some meat to it.  It was ok but for that price, I should have just gone to Safeway and gotten ramen noodles!  Put on your must miss list everyone - just go for drink and maybe an appetizer but go somewhere else for your main meal..."}
{"text":"Great calamari! We had the peppered tuna roll and the coconut shrimp roll. The tuna roll was by far better. The coconut shrimp roll lacked flavor big time! Great atmosphere though!"}
{"text":"I try to go to restaurants that are less busy and kid friendly.  They have a wonderful kids menu.  I love the panda shape oranges and how neat my kids food looks.  It actually looks better than mine.  The service is good.  It's well kept but kind of crowded compared to the Scottsdale location.   I really love the restaurant decor with waterfall walls and the fish tank.  The menu is pretty straight forward the food is good and their a variety.  The sushi is good too.  One of our favorite chain restaurant to go in the area."}
{"text":"So disappointed in the food here. It's been awhile however I don't remember the food quality being this poor. Very nice outdoor seating upstairs. Nice view with fans for your comfort. I ordered a oriental salad with chicken. The salad arrived literally with just cabbage, no green onions, 2 red pepper strips, didn't see any cilantro or carrots, one small \"cube\" of ramen and NO chicken. Of course the lovely waitress took it back but I was disappointed that she served it in the first place. The \"free\" appetizer is only valid with an order including an \"entree\" so I guess that was my bad for overlooking the fine print. Bottom line ~ I'll go elsewhere next time."}
{"text":"After moving to the North Phoenix area, the Kona Grill has quickly become one of our favorite places to go for a quick snack and/or dinner.  Great assortment of food choices and drinks.  We've only tried the sushi items so far and they are above average overall if not just a tad pricey but more-or-less in line for type of restaurant.  Service has been good so far and the back outside bar area is quite relaxing to hangout and night with out being overwhelmed by crowds"}
{"text":"This place has the best Happy Hour menu and atmosphere. I would recommend this to anyone who loves to hang out on a patio at a nice place and enjoy a great value for the$. Me and the family come hear often. Keep up the great business guys!"}
{"text":"found this place on yelp and we headed straight here after a 4.5 hour drive from san diego.  we arrived at 5 pm (for happy hour) and only had to a wait for a few minutes for a table to open up in the patio.  happy hour is in the patio or bar area.  it was a lovely day in vegas (sunny, mid-60s) so sitting in the patio was wonderful.  we were quickly served by a super friendly waiter and given the menu.  i was surprised at how fast we were served, because the place was PACKED.. but that is expected on friday at happy hour right?  we ordered the sake bomb, a few rolls and a few apps (calamari/shrimp).. we were HUNGRY!  the sake bomb is just that.. the bomb!  it was delicious.  this was all wonderful.  the food came out quickly as well and the presentation was nice.  unfortunately, that is where it ended for me.  the calamari (and i do love all types of calamari) was kind of soggy and tasteless.  the rolls (shrimp and crab) were mediocre, but filling. the saving grace was the sweet and spicy shrimp. this was good, but not great.  i really enjoyed my time here.. the service.. ambiance... location, but the food did not blow me away.  because of this, i rate kona grill at 3 stars.  i don't know.. perhaps i came on an off night (in regards to the food preparation), but this will not deter me from returning.  i was thoroughly impressed with everything else, and when i am back in vegas, will definitely return."}
{"text":"Disappointing.  Our server was pretty good but our experience not so much since there have been many changes from the 'new COO'.  A favorite Macadamia Nut Chicken is prepared differently and no longer a favorite or good.  They've also stopped the celebratory desserts. We were celebrating a birthday and even though we had a party of 12 so you know at least a couple hundred dollar ticket, they wouldn't do the comp dessert.  They used to be so nice with the plating and the crème brûlée. Instead we paid $8 for an okay brownie. Just disappointed. We likely won't be coming back and this is somewhere we've been coming for special occasions for ten plus years... it's just not the same."}
{"text":"Came in for my boyfriends bday. He got a sushi sampler and I got vegan friendly pasta and a side of white rice. . They have a gluten free menu. And big ups for me a vegan section!!!! VEGAN section. That was awesome. Waitress was Amanda. Great service. Great food. Great atmosphere. Overall Amazing"}
{"text":"What can I say... I live on the strip and this place has amazing chicken chili and cornbread and Lewis is my favorite server so I come here all the time to have dinner and look at his beautiful beard . They're always quick and super friendly ."}
{"text":"First off I have to say I've always been a fan of Kona Grill. I've never had a bad experience with the food or staff. I recently went to this new location to check it out and the inside is stunning. It felt really comfortable and has a fun atmosphere! The best part at this location is our server we had, Ruben. He took above and beyond care of us. I'm a server as well so when I go to restaurant I sadly look at things other people probably don't. He was on top of his game making sure everything was right, had great conversation, and knew exactly how to communicate with us regarding any questions. His food knowledge was on point which made me and my family feel like we were in good hands. I'll always go back and ask for Ruben. Great hire on your part Kona, he's a keeper! THANKS RUBEN!"}
{"text":"Went for happy hour. They have decent prices for food (the sushi sucks), but limited drink selections. The happy hour martinis and margaritas have no alcohol in them at all. Our server was one of the worst I have ever experienced. He was in a foul mood and took it out on everyone. Even the managers were too busy drinking and flirting, they had no clue what was going on. The place seems to be a hang out for loud obnoxious girls that have to scream when they talk. I would not go back to this place when there are so many better places to choose from."}
{"text":"Just saw an episode of \"kitchen nightmares\" where a hair was found in the food and Ramsay shut down the whole place- reminded me of my nightmare at Kona with the hair and all I was offered was a free dessert. That was 2 years ago - no response from the review ever. Shitty management- have not been back since ."}
{"text":"I've eaten here multiple times and have liked everything so far! Quality food with good service."}
{"text":"We went to celebrate a friend's birthday and it was not an award-winning experience. I'm not a sushi girl, but the rest of the girls said the sushi was \"okay\" but they've had better.   First, my friend's Saki cup was dirty and she had to request a new one. Then our sushi plates/soy bowls arrived and mine was dirty. When I asked for a new one - there was a pause and she didn't reach for it to take it and replace it - she told me they didn't have that many . . .  seriously? I would take a coffee cup instead if it was clean! She finally took it from me and returned with a clean one hot from the dishwasher.  Overall, we had a good time - the drinks were good - the people-watching didn't fail . . . but I'm not in a hurry to return.   I spoke to another friend who said she had the same dirty plate experience there a year ago - why is it always so crowded?"}
{"text":"I don't know what it is about their food, but it's so delicious and unique to me. I really can't get enough of it!  Happy hour offers some great prices on apps and drinks as well. The only thing this place needs help with is staffing.  We sat at the bar and were mostly ignored, and had to flag down attention when we wanted something. Bartenders were gossiping about another customer and quite loudly. Was bit surprised how open it was. They seem kind of stuck up too. I thought it was a bit unprofessional and immature. Think they need better customer service there.  So, to complete my review. Delicious food. Not so great staff.  Update: I have raised this review to 4 stars from 3. We went back to give it another go.  It was a slow night there. This time we sat in the dinning area instead of the bar and had above superb service. Our waitress (named Karen) was on top of everything and very sweet. So, best bet might be to sit in the dining room rather than the bar. They seem to care more in this section! Overall I recommend Kona, if nothing else, at least for the delicious food and apps."}
{"text":"Wow! What happened to this place? The remodel is beautiful but what happened to the service and the good food? I went here Sunday and sat down at a table on the patio. It took at least 10 minutes for someone to approach our table. The gentleman said he could ONLY take our drink order because it was transition time and someone else would get us food. We finally got our \"actual\" server who took our food order. We ordered calamari and chicken satays, both were disappointing and we sent our chicken back for being dry and disgusting. Locals love this place because the food was once outstanding and the happy hour prices were unbeatable. I don't think the food or service were enough to make me come back. Very disappointing experience!!"}
{"text":"I came home to Las Vegas to spend time with family for the holidays. My mom and stepdad decided to take me here for dinner while I'm here. The two of them kept raving about how it's \"sooooo gooood\" and that there is \"nothing bad here at all!\" Naturally, I kept a clear mind and tasted everything they ordered to add to my Yelp review.  We came on a Tuesday evening around 8:30pm. It was aesthetically pleasing at night time. Dim lights, gentle colors, very nice decor, sophisticated. I'd say it's a pretty nice date place. The front area to the left was the bar which was separated from the normal dining area by glass. The noise level wasn't too distracting and you could just hear the music. But it wasn't obnoxious or anything like that. They played a lot of music that I used to listen in in the early '00s.   We ordered the Crab Special sushi roll as an appetizer. It wasn't very impressive. Maybe I've just had my fair share of sushi places, or maybe it was a bad night. But it was a so-so roll for me and I probably wouldn't choose to get it again. Then again, it was a simple crab roll, so maybe it's just me. As for entrees, my stepdad ordered a caesar salad with the macadamia nut chicken added in. He had upgraded to an entree size, and I must say that it was pretty big. They added in these cheese cracker like things that added a nice touch to the salad. My mom ordered the Pan-Asian Noodle dish because they had gotten it before and fell in love. It was a warm udon noodle with seasoned beef. I only tasted the noodle and it was really, really full of flavor. The presentation made the dish seem small, but don't let that deceive you! There's quite a bit there to fill you up. I had the Macadamia Nut Chicken entree. It had two large pieces of crispy chicken covered in their shoyu-cream sauce. The combination was delicious! Not too creamy and not too bland. The chicken was also very tender. There was also a side of string beans which were a little too salty for my liking. It was cooked with a lot of butter and garlic. Luckily, there was a side of garlic mashed potatoes to balance the flavor. The pineapple-papaya marmalade was really refreshing as well. If I had to score the dish itself on a scale of 1 to 10, I'd give it a 7. The serving size was also very generous, I ended up taking half of it home even after offering my parents some.   Although I missed her name, the waitress that served us was very kind. She made sure to check on us often and answered any questions that we had. She also provided more info on other dishes and gave recommendations. So based on her, I'd say the place had pretty good customer service.   So with two sushi rolls and three entrees, we spent a total of about $70. Not too bad. I wouldn't go all the time, but every once in a while would be nice.  Next time I should try to go with a few friend to check out the happy hour. The people there seemed to be having a lot of fun!"}
{"text":"Love this place. I honestly can't think of a bad thing to say about them, except that their patio needs to be bigger!!!"}
{"text":"Decent food, definitely worth it during daily happy hours! Good sushi and apps; they come out fast!"}
{"text":"Went there for dinner tonight service was terrible food was mediocre. Ordered drinks and finished them before dinner was brought to the table they then sat empty through the entire meal, waitress barely came over and asked once at the end, we were already done and ready to leave. I had to call another waitress over to ask where the sauce was on the chicken. The shoyu sauce and mango pineapple salsa doesn't play well with that macadamia nut encrusted chicken.. I've had better calamari at a cheap Buffet. The sushi was drowned in ponzu sauce not good most likely will not be returning. this place was good now it's not"}
{"text":"The food was great but the service and server was less then desirable so sad never come back to this location"}
{"text":"It is sad to say that one of my favorite places as continued on going downhill.  We have been going there three to four nights a week and then they changed their Happy Hour menu and the service went down.  Now we find out that they no longer offer Happy Hour on Saturdays.  Now I see why the place is so dead at night.  Sad that corporate has become so money hungry."}
{"text":"Kona Grill - Boca Park management and staff did an excellent job for our group event.  Everything from the soup and salad, the entrees, and dessert were delicious. In addition, service staff was attentive throughout the meal.  It was also nice to have a separate area for our group of fifteen."}
{"text":"I've been going to kona since 2004ish. I've seen it change through the high times when the 1%s hung out at the bar for Friday happy hours, to the dip and then depression when zero ferraris were parked in front, to the remodel and now the new normal.  It is now definitely more corporate in my opinion. They food and drink selections are not as nearly inventive or fresh as they once were.  But if I'm having a business lunch or happy hour with some 40-50 year olds with a known taste for middle america it's difficult to beat this place.  Just the hint of an Asian spine on Americana. Sushi seems fresh.  Cocktails are decent upper middle of the road.  Beer selection needs work. I'll be back for more business meals."}
{"text":"Only 2 stars because the service was horrible, the waitress clearly didn't want to be there, not friendly, did not offer drink refills and couldn't recommend what was good.   The food was so slow to come out, 50 minute wait. The Sushi was good, but the other dishes were overcooked with a very bland taste, and the bread was stale.  I wanted to like this place, the location is great. But we didn't see a single smile from any member of staff. And the wait for food is just too long. Drinks were finished before the food came out, and was not worth waiting for."}
{"text":"I think the food was just okay.  I don't remember what I had.  I don't think anyone of the six of us was wowed but  I heard that the happy hour is pretty good there.  We went to the Scottsdale location once a couple of years ago and it was just okay as well.  We thought we'd try Chandler."}
{"text":"I generally prefer the Scottsdale Quarter or sometimes the Fashion Square location even though this spot is closer to home. There's nothing really wrong with it at all, but I think it's placement at the extreme end of the City North complex hampers it's ambiance and appeal, at least for me. The service is not lacking, staff is generally quite friendly ( I usually post up at the bar ). The sushi rolls seem to not be as tightly wrapped as other locations I've been to, but the flavor is just as good. If you're in the mood for some sushi rolls and a glass of vino while you're in the area, it's a decent place to spend a little time.  #konagrill #northphoenix #sushi #citynorth"}
{"text":"Popped in to Kona Grill at Scottsdale Quarter for a quick bite of California Roll and a glass of wine just before Happy Hour ended. It was pretty crowded, being a Friday night after all, but as we got inside we were informed after about a minute that the inside bar area and high tops were open seating, so a table was available right away. I'll have to say we weren't really greeted in any way until we asked about the seating, but once at our spot service was very good. We quickly were given water and our order was taken. Within a minute or two we were asked if someone had helped us and over the course of our stay several people stopped by, including what looked to be the manager, to see how everything was. It wasn't intrusive, but just added a nice touch to show that the staff was engaged.   The layout of the restaurant is great, with the bar area open on one side to the street and wrapping around to the inside where there are some high tops and booths. The California Rolls always seem to be just right. It's basic stuff, but quite good. I had a glass of the Spellbound Petite Syrah that I'm rapidly becoming a fan of. Nice flavors without being too intrusive anywhere. My buddy Jim chose the Portillo. The wine selection is nicely varied between the reds and whites so you should find something to satisfy your tastes.   This is a good location to enjoy some sushi or other fare, have some drinks and enjoy time with friends. The scenery is nice, the restaurant has a good vibe and the service, for us, was just right. Kona is a nice offering among the many choices at Scottsdale Quarter.  #scottsdale #konagrill #sushi #scottsdalequarter"}
{"text":"Of the dozen or so times I've visited Kona, I can't recall any instance that was particularly memorable, aside from sitting next to a certain local celebrity who shares title with a vegetable.  And that was only mildly entertaining.  Kona has a good quality standard, that rates with many other mid-range chains.  I do really appreciate the indoor/outdoor bar layout.  That's a good design and works well for quite a few places here in town.    Negative points for Boca Park's parking situation.  Sorry to pass those along to Kona, but I would do so for any of the establishments in that strip.  Nothing like parking at REI and walking across a blazing parking lot to have a beer and appetizers.  Sufficed to say, I will likely return to Kona on occasion, as it's a good central meetup location for most people on the West side of town.  Maybe something will surprise me one day and I'll up the marks on my review."}
{"text":"Love this place, need to come and try the avocado roll, and all the drinks this place has to offer. Yuuuuuuuuuummmmmmmmmmmoooo"}
{"text":"Glad I didn't read these other reviews before I stopped in.  We skipped the sushi because we have a favorite great sushi buffet spot. The sushi bar was vacant except for a lonely women in LBD.  My date didn't want me to flirt, so we sat inside the dark dining room.  Service was fine, no complaints, no problems, everything on the order correct.   I was buffeted out and wanted some good food.  My cheeseburger was perfect.  A large thick patty on a toasted bun with fully melted cheddar cheese.  They didn't put lettuce on the burger, which is just fine with me.  I rated this the best burger I ate this year.  My date had shrimp penne pasta which was plentiful and tasty. Pasta al dente, not mush.  The other diner had the pork steak and it was perfectly done. Very thick and flavorful cut of pork steak.  I'm surprised by the negative reviews here.  This is Kona Grill, with a laid back Hawaiian ambience.  This is now my favorite Las Vegas eatery.  I recommend this to anyone who enjoys Hawaiian influenced food style without the leis and hula skirts.  Why didn't I give it 5 stars?  I reserve those stars for a truly exceptional experience. This is a place to hang out once or twice a week.   Price normal to slightly high side, but not over the top."}
{"text":"No happy Hour on Sundays here!  That's the only reason why we stopped in because we were looking for a nice Sunday Funday spot.  After sitting we found out that this location only has happy hour during the week.  She said Chandler and Scottsdale locations are the only have HH during Sundays.  We decided not to stay.  I'm not a fan of Kona Grill enough to dine there outside of Happy Hour."}
{"text":"It was my wifes Birthday, and the weather was great, we decided to sit in the outside bar area.  The food was great.  We tried a little bit from different areas on the menu.    The sushi, mac and lobster, was great."}
{"text":"Overall the place is ok and the food is good, but the service was not the best, we were waiting for our food for 55 min, only after calling the manager we got out good and the we didn't get the full order."}
{"text":"Desapointed in the new version of \"Lina\" that place was awesome before and being local we used to gather friends and we were regular clients.  They tried to make it way to FANCY ... that's were they missed out the point in my opinion.  If we want fancy and inflated prices we just drive 15 min down the strip !!!  The quality of food is ok, but price wise ouchhh ! Really expensive and the portions are extremely small. I don't think we will come back."}
{"text":"Very excellent service!  Our server was fantastic at his job!  I wish service was that fantastic everywhere!  As far as the food goes we ordered calamari which was great!  My boy ordered the salmon......soooo good! I also ordered a house salad that had the best dressing and a green apple and Brie flatbread........DO NOT ORDER THIS.  That is the only complaint I have.  It was not good.  Also, for a drink they make their sangria with champagne, AMAZINGLY DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"Went there with friends the meal was nice but I ordered my go to drink - a midori sour, it was all midori and no sour apple pucker, I asked the waitress if the bartender could put more sour apple pucker in it so the drink can be right, she told me the midori liquor is a melon liquor...duh. This is my favorite drink and I know how to make them myself, the ones I make are better and I didn't ask for a liquor tutorial I asked for my drink to be made correctly, it's not supposed to taste like a melon.    The waitress brought me back a taller drink that still tasted like the melon midori liquor. So instead of a midori Sour I got a melon drink. The bartender didn't know how to make it obviously and that's my favorite drink. If I go to this location I know not to order any mixed drinks because it won't be made correctly. I've included the pictures of My midori liquor from home with the sour apple pucker. This is how it's supposed to be made not the fruity tutti crap they gave me."}
{"text":"This was definitely one worth my review! We drove here all the way from the other side of town, it's Valentine's Day not to busy for a sit down lunch. Incredibly calm atmosphere, and the service is impeccable! David was our server, checked on us just the right amount of times. Got us everything we needed and explained the menu perfectly. It's been rare for us to have a good dining experience, from start to finish and were so pleased to have finally found a place with reasonable prices and above and beyond customer service! Thank you."}
{"text":"5 Stars for Kona Grill's Happy Hour.  The menu is the best I've seen. It's both cheap and extensive. Prices range from about $3 for sushi rolls to $5.50 for personal sized pizzas.  The wait staff is SSSLLLLOOOWWW, thus the 4/5 rating.  My Faves? The Atlantic Roll - delicious and ONLY $3! The other sushi rolls are all pretty mediocre.  The Avocado Egg Rolls - MMMM-azing and their dipping sauce even more so. I would be willing to add this to my list of \"Last Meals on Earth\".  Hawaiian Pizza - The best of the pizza options.   The only thing I've had from the HH menu that I didn't thoroughly enjoy was the Chicken Satay.   I go here about every other week with friends. Happy hour runs from 3-7.  Come enjoy a late lunch or early dinner. My total bill typically comes to around $8. Can't beat that!"}
{"text":"Always a great happy hour spot.  Good food and drink specials, fun patio, and the remodel of the bar area feels like Vegas.    Tip: Get there before 5 if you want a table in the bar for happy hour - fills up quick around 5pm on Fridays.  The manager, I forget his name, even gave us a free dessert as he said he remembers seeing us in there a few times.  Wanted to thank us for coming back in."}
{"text":"Just like all of Scottsdale, I have a love hate relationship with this place. I used to come here with my bitchy blonde Scottsdale friends and get up sushied and liquored up, but now that has pretty much lost all its appeal.  I'm not sure if it is the mediocre sushi, the ridiculous people hanging out there or just the general air of douchiness that hangs around the fashion square mall but this place just wreaks of stay away.'  Last time I came here I ordered tuna sashimi and it was kind of chewy and fishy. I hate that. The eel roll was soaked in too much sauce. That was kind of yucky too. The spicy tuna roll and squid salad were good though. The Macadamia Nut Chicken Salad is pretty good too and so are their kind-of-gross-but-good fried tuna appetizer thingys.  I guess I'll still eat here on a whim or if I want to get drunk then wander around the mall. Which I suppose could be fun on a whim too."}
{"text":"I haven't been to this Kona in years. I love the redo & the sushi was fresh & yummy. I tried the coconut mojito & it's very refreshing but didn't pack a punch which was exactly what I was looking for. The staff was a bit slow for a Sat afternoon (not so packed) but what are ya gonna do? Fresh, good sushi in AZ. If the staff behind the sushi bar & out of it had been more attentive this would have been a 5 star review."}
{"text":"This place has been a staple in the landscape of NW Vegas for over 20 years now, and still seems to be going strong. They seem to recognize that their patio vibe and generous happy hour selections, along with the see and be seen drive by location in Boca Park are a winning combo.  Lately, I see all new faces within the staff, and the last couple of visits I've noticed some fairly heavy hip hop music being played in the bar/patio area. I hope this isn't the telltale sign of the demise (or last ditch effort to pull out of a slump) of the bar. The reggae or house music that used to be the regular is what set the tone for a great time (think beach vibe on a beautiful Sunday, and trendy lounge on any summer week night after 9pm). The \"older\" Summerlin singles were even able to tolerate it, and those guys are in there spitting some major game on the regular. Rumor is, the restaurant is closing soon for a remodel to make a second story patio. As long as it isn't constant rap and hip hop playing through the speakers, I look forward to some fresh changes at Kona! Lets hope they dont lose sight of why their patio has been such a hot spot for over two decades."}
{"text":"Honestly it's the weirdest sushi combos ever. The fish was also VERY fishy. It wasn't bad just not for my palette. I'd suggest sticking to the traditional rolls."}
{"text":"The best part of Zona Grill is the Happy Hour, dinner I'll pass.  Nothing special to me.  In fact, I've been a few times for both happy hour and dinner and I don't have any favorite or memorable dishes besides the burger sliders during happy hour.  Zona Grill seems to be a favorite amongst work lunches and dinners, that's the only reason why I've dined there so many times.    This location in Scottsdale is ALWAYS crowded during HH.  Always!  Especially Sundays. It's crowded, the servers are unattentive and the Margaritas just aren't that dern good.  I've mentioned this to friends in the area and they all say something like that \"Yeah, it's a little hit or miss.  It all depends on what bartender is working that day\". I'm not up for dining at a place where I have to call ahead to see who's bartending for the evening.  I'll pass!"}
{"text":"The freshest place I'd been to in AZ...not that it says much since I've only been to 3 but I love sushi and this place is up there.  I ordered my staples: seaweed salad, spider roll and salmon skin rolls.  Way yum...  But it's not just the food, the ambience is terrific.  The decor is trendy, music was great and they had an outdoor patio area.  I went back there a few days later and sat at the sushi bar.  We tried this fantastic roll, I think it was the calamari crunch roll that they used cucumber instead of seaweed, wow it was fantastic and very refreshing especially since it'd been in the triple digits that day.  One interesting fact, people don't sit at the sushi bar.  My friend and I were the only ones at the bar for our entire meal.  It was fine by us but I'm used to seeing it full in other restaurants.  The sushi chef was great, very friendly and even pointed us to a great country dive bar called Tom Ryan's where I tried to two step very unsuccessfully.  I'll write a review on them also (but I won't rate my own dancing!)."}
{"text":"Great place for good food & drinks! Happy Hour is one of the best in Vegas!!! Our Server Layne----what can I say he's got the best/happiest personalities I've ever come across, he made our night!!! Thanks Layne for your great service!!!"}
{"text":"My favorite weekly Sunday happy hour!! Great and friendly staff and the food never fails!! Great menu whether you are in the mood for sushi, a burger, or something a little different."}
{"text":"Bombbb spot for the happy hour. Gotta go with the bama roll and spicy tuna roll as far as sushi goes. Also the chicken+shrimp lettuce wraps. The cucumber and seaweed salad and sauce that it comes with is on point!!!!! Their drinks specials are also great. I'll be back for sure"}
{"text":"This place was amazing it was very fast and very clean and the waitress was very friendly and very attentive. I have the flat bread. I had so many different flavors on it I think my favorite part was that they used goat cheese. I also had a California hand roll. That was free by the way with the Yelp check in. My friends had of meals that they loved as well. Definitely be back!!!!"}
{"text":"Good stuff and the Kona Grill.  Staff is very friendly.  Everything I have ever ordered has been very good.  I recommend the fish of the day or the chicken."}
{"text":"Love love love Macadamia nut chicken. I think they also put crack in the green beans, how are they so good?Fast service for lunch."}
{"text":"This is kind of an impromptu review but since I didn't plan on being here today I thought I should leave one. We were down the way at Cheesecake Factory and they ran out of high chairs so we came here. This is the second time since the remodeling and the service and food are as great as they were before. I had Sushi, my wife had pesto linguini and we had one kids meal. Everything was great and we will be back!"}
{"text":"Loved the sweet deals my friend and I scored for sushi during happy hour! We ordered the spicy tuna roll, rainbow roll, and the crunchy crab roll; all were good, but could have used a touch more spice in the spicy tuna. We spent only $16! The bill would have been at least double at any other time; and happy hour is super long, from 3-7pm! The only down side was that service was slow; our waitress was kind, but she didn't have that many tables to wait on, yet we found ourselves waiting for her..."}
{"text":"Not A very positive attitude.  The sushi was just okay.   I had to flag down the waiter.  3 star restaurant."}
{"text":"The service in the bar was slow, the waitress explained she had been on break.  Not the best beginning but she was somewhat attentive after her break.  We did have long pauses...you notice it most when you need/want something more.  Happy hour proved to be cost effective.  The pot stickers ae terrible.  They are obviously frozen somewhere far away with little car in preparation.  I would return but my choices would be different...no pot stickers for sure."}
{"text":"Food was ok nothing special  Service nice & Sweet  Drinks: Strong flavorless whats wrong with Vegas its Not so Hard to make Good Drinks.   Crowded& busy"}
{"text":"I really enjoy Kona Grill, and there's a few reasons why. For starters, the most important part - they've got some great food. I'm a huge fan of their happy hour selection. I always get the avocado egg rolls, and jalapeño yellowtail sashimi. My last visit I had an amazing server by the name of Lissette - awesome waiter and very personable. The ambiance is nice as well and accommodating to all occasions - a great place for a date night, or just to eat out with friends or family. They also have a killer drink selection. Not the most economic choice as it is a bit pricey, but you get what you pay for - quality."}
{"text":"My take on this paritcular Kona Grill location:  Fantastic for happy hour - if you just want to relax and not eat anything too filling and have a few drinks, it's a great place. Especially if you've had a long day or are one of those funky people watchers, a table on the patio would be great for you.  For lunch or dinner - not the greatest menu, but the food isn't horrible. Just make sure you know what you're ordering and be aware that the portions aren't exactly generous.  Servers are usually nice, although i must say they have gone downhill in the last few years. I prefer the servers at Chandler Mall, but oh well."}
{"text":"When we lived in Vegas this was absolutely our favorite Sunday brunch place because of the happy hour pricing and quality of the food offered. We were expecting the same thing at this location but that is not what we experienced.  After a day of shopping all we wanted to do was sit down and relax.   We ordered our usual which is the sliders and the pepperoni flat bread pizza. We decided to eat outside on the patio and was served by a nice waitress but then the food arrived and for the first time ever for a Kona experience it was disappointing.  Our sliders came out over cooked and drier then dry even though we ordered it medium rare and our flatbread pizza was loaded with salt. Hungry we just munched on our fries and called it a day. Not sure what was going on at Kona this particular day but one day we hope to return as it's a convenient location near our home."}
{"text":"Great food great service, Luis was a great host and helped with all our food needs. Great drinks and great staff. Very pleasant. 10/10 will come here over and over again. Thank you kona grill!!!"}
{"text":"Great food, friendly staff, and fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"Really peeps!?!! 3-4 stars? Blehk!!!....Scottsdale has so many other Sushi places to go to!  Yes, it's in a convenient place, HOWEVER ....do yourself a favor and walk across the street and eat some tastier, fresher, healthier food!   Had the ceviche...brown avocados and tiny pieces of unidentifiable seafood...oh wait, I could see the mini pieces of octopus....bland, a fruit fly flew out of the bottom of one of the  chipped, white, ceramic, square dishes (they give you 3). Inexcusable!  The sushi....obviously they don't know a thing about making sushi rice and I had to ask for Wasabi and Ginger just to \"clean the palate\"!  I was desperately hungry after walking that mall and looked at the reviews here on Yelp....... you guys have it so wrong! Walk across the street ....your money will be better spent!"}
{"text":"We received an gift card and had never been so we gave this place a try. I wish I could give more than 5 stars. We came late night and the patio was packed so we took a seat at the bar. Much to our surprise it was late night happy hour. We couldn't believe the prices! We were quick to order some cocktails and 3 different appetizers (lettuce wraps, tuna wontons, & potstickers). The drinks were strong and the appetizers were nothing short of amazing. We were so stuffed but really wanted to see what more they had to offer. The bartender said if we were to try 1 entree it must be the sea bass. We took his word and ordered. Wow! This dish was out of this world and the fish truly melted in your mouth. We couldn't stop eating! We are SO pleased with our service and experience we're just bummed it took so long to try this place out!"}
{"text":"Always a good time  absolutely love the view and the fresh air on the roof patio... Great food, good Service and One of my favorite Happy Hours"}
{"text":"Horrible service the waiter can not do two at the same time. Not too sure what the problem was with the waiter but the dude had to be on drugs. Drink service, was weird, he had a hard time bring 3 ice tea's and one diet soda. He brought the diet soda but didn't bring the ice teas, then it took 15 minutes to get the ice teas, when we ordered our food, we wanted appetizers BEFORE our meal,  which was explained to him but NO, he brought my partners lunch out and that was it. We sat there wondering what was going on, after 30 minutes (I went to the hostess stand and ask to speak to the manager) after 20 minutes the manger finally came over (BTW we sit had not received the rest of our food OR drink refills) we told the manager was had happened, we got a new wait staff who was on top of it, and in about 15 minutes our food started to arrive. After this service and food was excellent...  The Manager comped our meal.  This all took place at 1130am on a thrusday afternoon."}
{"text":"Ordered for pick up here and my french fries were still frozen & hard :( The pad Thai we ordered was also not very good. Not sure we will be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Love there happy hour!! My husband and I go there as often as we can.. The seared ahi which is on a wonton skin is delicious and crab special roll is so yummy and all very reasonable."}
{"text":"My favorite Happy Hour place in Summerlin. A Sunday must go-to! Their sushi is so tasty and so are their flatbread pizzas and sliders.   I have had most everything on their happy hour menu and it is all delicious. During the summer it is nice to sit on the patio as they have the misters on and have a nice glass of chardonay! I love going here!"}
{"text":"I've loved Kona for a long time, my friend and I used to come get some happy hour drinks and some sushi rolls more than once a week! Last night was the first time in a little while that I'd been there and I'm so upset at how much they've changed the happy hour menu! They don't even have the margarita anymore! All the traditional rolls have been taken off and that definitely discourages me from returning. I'm bummed Kona! Bring back the good stuff! Quit trying to fix something that isn't broken."}
{"text":"Food was fine.  Not memorable but fine.  Our server was awful.  Never cracked a smile ever.  When we asked questions about an entree, she read the menu to us.  The entire time her face said 'i cannot WAIT until my shift is over!'   Not prompt, not intuitive, not friendly, and had to be asked to refill our water.  Manager, however seemed genuinely helpful."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever. Came here to celebrate my sisters 21st birthday, and received the worst service ever. The guy checked her ID, and didn't tell her happy birthday. When we ordered the server didn't take everyone's order before he left the table. The food was okay, but way too pricey for \"happy hour\" . Literally the worst experience ever for the price I paid. Server brought our check with the food practically, and we felt very kicked out. Overall not satisfied, and disappointed we chose this place to celebrate a birthday. Would not recommend to friends!"}
{"text":"The Kona Grill at the Chandler Mall is the location that I prefer! Nicer servers and for some reason unbeknownst to me, better food.  As someone previously said, good luck with getting a table during happy hour here, but sometimes you luck out and get a decent seating. The seafood here seems fresher to me than the one at Scottsdale, who knows why. It's also a place to people watch if you're sitting at the patio, but then again, that's sorta creepy.  Other than that, it's a recommendable place if you just want to throw back a few drinks over good food."}
{"text":"First off dessert and wine were great. Went there with a group of five. Had drinks, dinner and dessert. Shared the creme brulee and red velvet cupcake. But two of us also shared a bout of violent food poisoning. Although we didnt eat the same thing we both were spewing not much later and one of us even took a trip to the ER. Not a clue what was contaminated that made us both sick. Maybe it was the edamame, who knows. But for sure, will not be going back."}
{"text":"Love this place and everything on the menu, at times service can have that \"hey I'm to cool for this job\" attitude.....but all in all it's a great lunch spot.."}
{"text":"I like this place I truly do however they do not have enough seating and I dislike happy hour any be had inside away from the bar. You can get there at 4pm and all tables are filled but the inside is empty. The California rolls are awesome though and great martinis just come super duper early!!"}
{"text":"We found this place on yelp and gave it a try based on the great ratings and pictures.    We walked in and were instantly concerned, as the place was empty (it was a little early for Vegas dinner) and the greeter was extremely uninviting. She never welcomed us, made any eye contact, and just dumped our menus off at the table and walked away.  We sat down, talked about it, and almost left.  Thankfully, the server made up for it entirely. He was very welcoming, very engaging, and even had   conversation with our young kids. He made great suggestions on drinks and food.   The food was excellent. The calamari appetizer was very good, the Seabass was amazing, and the sushi was very creative and unique.  Between our server, and the quality of food, this is one of the best places to eat in Vegas, and we have been just about everywhere.  They need to breathe some life into the greeter though."}
{"text":"Pretty darn good appetizers. I'd definitely go back. I like the margerhita flat bread. I love their fondue appetizer. Sangria could've been better - aka more alcohol."}
{"text":"My husband and I LOVED kona before the remodel. The first time we went after the remodel we had no idea there was a while new staff and management. It was pretty hot outside and the happy hour seating was packed and in the past before the remodel and old management the manager would let us sit inside with our kids and still give us the happy hour prices. We asked to sit inside and the waitress told us we had to go outside for happy hour and wait for a table and didn't offer us any drinks or anything. The manager came and told us to go outside because they don't allow happy hour menu inside and had no exceptions. We went back in forth for a while him telling us how he asked a family before us to go outside and wait for a table as well. Bottom line the new management sucks or at least the new manager."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service, racist. They said they didn't accept ID from our country in specific."}
{"text":"Went to try happy hour a few times, always end up leaving because we never get recognized, but then again it's also been pretty busy. Went back on a week day around 3 so that there wouldn't be a big crowd. Server got there right away, although we were the only table. We ordered food immediately with our drinks.. But then we literally never saw him again. He forgot my salad. My veggie roll had no asparagus in it. We had a buy one get one entree that we never got to use because we never got a chance to see him to even ask about it. Had to ask the servers standing around for pretty much anything we needed, including refills. My veggie roll was on the bill twice. The food was good... I wish I got the salad I ordered though... the Moscow mules were disgusting. And the service was horrible. Thought third time would be the charm."}
{"text":"I came here and we choose to sit outside, that isn't really outside since it is covered next to the mall entrance. Service was nice and everything I had to eat was very nice, and I had the pot-stickers and shrimp and salmon sushi rolls. The shrimp tempura was the nights personal favorite. The right amount of rice and flavor for what you pay for - nothing experimental or crazy.   Outside has a nice feel, but is louder and doesn't invite for any easy conversation. Inside it is quieter and they have nice tall stuffed seating arrangements, that I did not make use out of this time. Overall it has a nice vibe, even if I perceive it as a little manufactured.   I am having some issues defining this place, are they trying to sell an upscale experience and yet call themselves a grill? Focusing on seafood but having almost anything else on the menu. Yeah, it is a little too eclectic for me - but then again both service and food is good, and I will come here again so I guess the undefinition joke is on me."}
{"text":"Good casual food, the tuna is good."}
{"text":"As always this place rocks, the new Thai beef salad is so good and spicy but the big huge surprise was the big island meatloaf.  If you like pig and beef mixed together with a crispy crust then get this piece of heaven."}
{"text":"I went out to Kona with coworkers and I usually love this place.  My coworkers recommended seared tuna and I decided to give it a shot and ordered a medium rare..    My dish came out and by the look of it, it doesn't  looked medium rare.  I ask the waitress to take a look and she took the tuna back.  Shortly afterwards,  the manager, Bob brought the same dish back and stated it's medium rare and asked me to cut it open.  I did and it looked medium-well compared to my coworker's medium rare dish.  The manager kept saying it's medium rare and I have snap a photo for everyone to review.    Afterwards, chief came out to deliver a dish to another table.  I asked him over and asked if my dish is cooked as medium rare?  He Immediately said no and ask to replace it for me.  I said no but he insisted.  Shortly afterwards, waitress bought my dish and it was cooked to perfection(check photo).    The manager finally came back and have removed the charge from our bill.  Maybe the manager had a bad day earlier but he ended with an excellent service to our group."}
{"text":"While the food was great the service was lacking. A friend had to ask the waitress her name to start, we were served by Reyna, and for a slower Thursday night it still took a while to get our drinks and when they came they were wrong. When we asked for the bill because we had a show to get to our waitress said ok and walked away... we don't know where she went but we waited a while until we asked another waitress to help us.  The location is perfect for this restaurant and with a check in you get a free app! Still service could be improved!"}
{"text":"Love the sushi and drinks. Your manager Eddy rocks too!"}
{"text":"Omg so disappointed in the food. We got takeout so cannot comment on service FYI. The pad Thai was tangy and nothing like pad Thai should be. I could barely taste any peanut. And the seaweed salad was $6.50 but barely half a cup portion. Will not be ordering again"}
{"text":"I have to say, every time i go and visit my brother in Phoenix -  not once have we missed out on a night eating at Kona. I love this place!! I tend to stick to their sushi and I have never been disappointed. Who would think seafood in the desert could taste so delicious and fresh!  The Sashimi was perfect, and the spicy tuna roll had just enough punch to keep your taste buds happy! The prices aren't anything scary either so that's always a bonus. I like the feel of this restaurant because you could show up in a party dress or down in jean shorts and a t shirt and either way fit right in! Good for a date night, birthday party or a quick drink and something to nosh on. The Kona Grill in Scottsdale is a little more dressy and club like, but this one in Gilbert has always delivered, and I always look forward to keeping the tradition on!!"}
{"text":"Decent Sushi, slow service, sitting outside makes it tolerable."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday evening for a friend's birthday.  A reservation was made ahead of time for a party of 6 and a baby. Most of our party was already seated, but my other half and I arrived a little later than expected. I walked in to the restaurant, and was not greeted at all by the hostess, who seemed to be having a conversation with someone sitting next to the host/hostess stand. Anyways, we got to the table where the rest of our party was seated. What I didn't understand is that 6 adults were assigned to sit in a booth that seems to only comfortably sit 4 people. I would have appreciated a much more comfortable seating arrangement especially because we had put in a reservation.   Staff- Our waitress was kind and took care of us. She brought us refills before we were finished with our drink. Our waitress was probably one of the only things that I could walk away feeling satisfied with.   The food- I ordered the Lemon-Garlic Shrimp Penne, which turned out to be much spicier that I anticipated. In the description on the menu, the entree consisted of Parmesan, Baby Arugula, Roasted Tomatoes, Lemon Cream and Garlic Bread. In my opinion, a little note of the spice should be added Just in case anyone has a problem with spicy food. I toughed out the kick of the spice, however, another person in my party needed to return her entree because she cannot eat anything spicy. It was tasty, just a tad too spicy for my liking. Yes I could have returned my plate to ask for the dish to be less spicy, but i chose not to since it was busy and I was hungry."}
{"text":"Not a newcomer to the Boca Park KONA GRILL.  It has been a  very good experience until a week ago.  The service was beyond unsatisfactory however the food was every bit as good as customary.   Getting up the nerve I spoke to the GM (Jose) who listened patiently, validated my feelings and apologized for our experience.  He could not have been nicer!  The GM went above & beyond in resolving the issue.  No doubts, I will continue to be a loyal customer."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Kona grill in Irvine and am always happy. Decided to try this location since I was in town. Ordered the hamachi sashimi and a plain philly roll. Fish was fresh as usual. The sashimi melts in your mouth.   I sat at the bar, since it's where I'm the most comfortable. And as a bartender for over a decade and a half, I must say that the one solo bartender GUS was excellent. He was in charge of the whole bar and service well and did all of it while maintaining his bar customers all in a timely manner and still had enough time to converse. Very impressed. I ordered an earl grey old fashioned from the cocktail list and it was excellently crafted. See photo attached. Thanks for everything Gus, I'll tell people to come in and ask for you. Try the Guinness IPA when you can. Mahalo."}
{"text":"A joke.... Bad service, disgusting menu and extremely priced. But the ambience was not bad. But it's not good enough to justify such awfulness."}
{"text":"Food was very good, atmosphere not so much.  It was very loud inside and the staff did not seem to be very kid friendly."}
{"text":"There new re model is beautiful! The menu is great! So yummy. Service was good   The only down fall would be the music. It sounds like a night club out here with rap music. No good for dinner with my children. I don't think chris brown singing about big booty bitches is very good. Other then the music it's a great spot. Patio is beautiful"}
{"text":"I LOVE the Kona grill Happy hours!  A great place to meet friends for a drink, and who can complain about half-price apps and sushi! Love the Mahi Mahi, crunch rolls, Cali rolls w/jalapanos, calamari, and avocado egg roll! Yes, you WILL need to get there early to get seats, but worth the extra effort!"}
{"text":"This place is okay to start off, you get 6 small pieces of sushi for $2 a piece. Took about an hr to get someone, not our server to give us our bill and boxes. The only thing that was good here was the amount of food they give you on the plate.   Wish they would give larger sizes at least for the prices given on the menu."}
{"text":"Save room for dessert! We went here while in town because I have been to other locations. Food came out in a reasonable amount of time, flavors were good and great atmosphere. For appetizer the angry edamame is delightful and dessert the carrot cake!"}
{"text":"I have been to this place a couple of times and since we are neighbors now, we thought we would check it out. The sushi is subpar at best and over priced. The rolls are small and pretty boring compared to the real sushi restaurant I usually go to. The service was neither great nor poor but we definitely needed to ask when we needed something. I think we will stick to Happy Hour at this place, and keep our sushi dates to the professionals.   If you are looking for expensive, not great, slow service sushi, this place is for you!"}
{"text":"As I sit here, preparing for the wheelchair ride out, I can't help but reflect on the events that just unfolded. First, we were greeted warmly by a hostess that was being pulled ten ways, kudos to you for keeping it together. Second, we were seated in a huuuuge booth to make room for the 4 appetizers we ordered for two humans.  Our server was absolutely phenomenal, always refilling our waters and seeing how we're doing. \"chipping away at it as best we can, I'll try to make you proud\". A sushi roll, fondue, bbq chicken flatbread & avocado egg rolls later, here we lay. In a state of euphoria over the amazing service & meal we just experienced.   Thank you to the staff and chefs at Kona Grill for making it a pleasurable first experience. We appreciate you!!"}
{"text":"Went there for happy hour today, have been before and service and food was impressive, hence why I returned. To say the least I was very disappointed this time around. The food and prices were very good, however was constantly ignored by our waitress and felt as if they didn't care about customer service at all. I would go back just for the calamari, but wouldn't hesitate to find a new place for food because of the lack of customer care."}
{"text":"Stopped in with a friend recently and found the newest change at Kona (other than the higher HH prices)   is to NO LONGER include THE BASICS of wasabi and ginger on a platter of sushi. WTH???  I was craving the crab crunch rolls, ordered two, my friend ordered a few rolls, and then we had to wait 10 minutes to get the now 'special order' of wasabi & ginger. WTH?!? What moron suit came up with that ridiculous idea??? Does anyone realize how utterly lame (and hideously tacky) that is?? NO WASABI or ginger on a platter of sushi?? Hello..knock..knock..knock!!!  Here is a free clue for Kona...IF you actually feel the restaurant is being adversely effected financially from wasabi waste... A)Serve a smaller portion to start and provide more if wanted/needed B)Provide a small crock of wasabi w/tiny spoon at the table...(crock could even be shifted among tables if need be) C)Have server ASK guests if they would like wasabi or not D)Understand that you can actually stretch your wasabi further by adding more water (it also makes it light and fluffy) E)Stop serving Sushi all together F)Cut to the chase and just fire the crazy fool who actually thought NOT providing wasabi/ginger to sushi lovers was a viable option...(on any day, ever!)  Please note: When our 'special orders' of wasabi arrived,they were HUGE, easily 4-5 times more that we could have possibly used. That my friends is called \"a penny wise, and a dollar short\"... Stop obsessing over wasabi!!!   (I still love you)"}
{"text":"nice place to go for happy hour the bbq chicken flat bread pizza was very good and on happy hour they are half off over all a good experience the service was a little slow but it was busy"}
{"text":"Food was excellent. Had the potstickers and sushi sampler. Karen was our server. However was disappointed waiting 35 mins for our check after table was cleared and dessert was already refused. Plus, excessive chit chat while waiting for our bill while still in plain sight is very unprofessional."}
{"text":"I love this place! We were just here last night! The atmosphere is relaxing and fresh! It has a sophisticated yet \"young adult\" feel to it. (BTW, I'm 37 and still consider myself young, ok!) the sushi is delicious! Spicy Tuna Rolls are my fave! My hubby regularly orders the BBQ flat bread and pot stickers, which are cooked and served to perfection!  We ordered dessert for the first time and they were amazing! The brownie has got to be the best this Valley has to offer! Check out the photos! And the pineapple upside down cake has the perfect balance of rich and sweet.   Our friend ordered a cheesecake and to his shock, no cheesecake on the menu! He couldn't believe and was visibly disappointed. That's when he settled for the brownie. After his first bite, he never mentioned cheesecake again.  My spouse and I ordered the pineapple upside down cake but got to taste the brownie too! Oh-My-Goodness! I'll be ordering the brownie next time for sure! Not too sweet, it has the perfect amount of chocolate, moisture, and deliciousness! Mmm, Mmm Good!"}
{"text":"Happy Hour was just that, very happy. Nice to find a happy hour on a weekend. Erin our server was excellent! Great food and delicious drinks. Manager even stopped by to check on us. Very impressed today with a great local spot I tend to forget about,with all the options in the area. Two thumbs up today Kona"}
{"text":"So, we thought we'd head down to the brand new City North development today for lunch and see what all the hub-bub was about, BEFORE it got crazy over the weekend. We knew that several new restaurants were part of the development, so we were excited to try something new.   Well, 3 restaurants have yet to open. Ocean Prime, a very posh looking steak/seafood restaurant, is only open for dinner. That left Kona Grill. Sigh........ Not exactly what we had been hoping for, but there we were.   As you would expect, the restaurant is very hip inside, with cool blue lights over the sushi bar. The \"booze\" bar is half open to a corner patio, which will be a prime location for happy hours, especially as the City North project grows.   Being that it was only their second day open, there were some kinks in the operations. It took our server 10 minutes to even deliver menus (we had to ask twice). The food (2 sandwiches) took aver 30 minutes to be delivered (other tables that seated after ours were served before us). To be fair, the manager did come over and apologize to us.  At least he cared.   The food was good and what you'd expect. I enjoyed my Barbecue Pork sandwich and the sides that came with it were yummy. The bread seemed a bit old, which was odd for a 1-day-old establishment.   Overall, Kona Grill is what it is. I would definitely be inclined to go back for happy hour. However, it'll be other restaurants that bring us back to City North; not Kona Grill."}
{"text":"As it turns out this place is not a restaurant with a bar, its a bar with a restaurant. Made the mistake of bringing my 8 year old. One look at the kiddie menu and i knew i should have left. Instead of just making miniature meals from there menu they did the old, don't bring your kids here again, they are not welcome routine. I know ours popular in this obese children's society to feed kids crap but who the hell feeds their kids macaroni and cheese for dinner? Isn't that a side dish? When did this become a main course from hell? How lazy can a parent be than to serve a kid macaroni and cheese. Oh yeah, order macaroni and cheese. So as it goes we order from the main menu. Chicken with mozzarella sandwich and i had the salmon. It was way too much to pay for frozen meals. The rice was swimming in soy sauce and pineapple. I'm a carb addict and if i can't eat it, its not worth eating. The green beams i have to say were the highlight of the meal. They tasted like the ones at outback which i just love. The salmon, just more frozen fair. Parmesan fries uneatable, sandwich, just not worth it. The ciabatta roll was dry and tasteless. I think since thus place failed so miserably at a restaurant they note solely cater to the bar. Its a shame they can't handle both."}
{"text":"This review has been long overdue! Love coming here! I actually brought my boyfriend here for his birthday. And the staff did a phenomenal job and executed the surprise! They don't sing happy birthday but they give you a crematory brûlée :)"}
{"text":"Good food located in a good area. The crowd is great food is americanized Japanese"}
{"text":"Wow. This place has seriously gone downhill. A few months ago, I was on the way home from school one evening and was really craving a good ol' oriental chicken salad. I went in to get one for takeout, and they told me I couldn't have it because it wasn't on happy hour. What?! Never in my life have I been somewhere that they told me I couldn't order a certain item because it wasn't on a happy hour menu. O_o So, out of self-respect I did not go back, although I really missed their food.  Just yesterday, a friend who I hadn't seen in a long while wanted to go for lunch, and I agreed, thinking \"Well, enough time has passed...maybe it'll be okay again.\" First of all, our server seems to severely dislike her job and gives every indication that she does not want to be there. I am always exceedingly and genuinely polite to servers (I work in the industry) but this lady was not having any of it. She was full of fake smiles and just had an air of being pissed off and not caring at all about the service she was providing.   I got the sushi sampler which is a dish I had always liked and it was as good as I remembered, although the salad could do without the weird cheese they put on it. There were flies buzzing around the table....awesome.... and one landed in my tea. Since I was in the middle of my food, I needed it to be replaced quickly, but our server was nowhere to be found for a good 10 minutes. Since I couldn't wait any longer, I flagged down another server to get me a fresh tea. He apologized and went to do so....yet it still took another 10 minutes for him to come back with it. This was a little after 4 pm, so they were not busy either. Our server was with him but said nothing. After we had finished eating, our server did not drop off the check or come to ask if we were ready for it for a good 15/20 minutes...rather irritating.   I feel as though no one who works in this place actually wants to be there. The atmosphere is pretty but just does not feel very inviting. It's unfortunate because their food really is fantastic, but everything else is lacking."}
{"text":"First of all I'm not one to write reviews on Yelp. But this one made me do it! We came to watch the Golden Knights play their playoff win so we sat at the bar. We were told by \"management\" that we could not disturb the violinist outside...what?? We also talked with management and the manager basically told us she'd be back to check with her \"supervisor\"....LOL The place on the strip is a tourist trap, and will always be one apparently because the management doesn't care about quality of service or integrity. You can go any day or time of the week, it's empty and dead and losing money even on the strip? It's no wonder why"}
{"text":"best Chopped Salad in town and I recommend the Philly Roll with it- especially at happy hour's during Sunday"}
{"text":"Hubby & I stopped by for a late lunch yesterday and had a very mixed bag of quality.    Ordered two nigiri, the smoked salmon was excellent but the albacore was so vinegared up that it even disgusted me.. and I love vinegar.  Informed our server, Justen, and he said he would inform them of this problem.  Then, entrees arrived.. hubby's Grilled Ribeye Sandwich worked for him, but my Seared Scallops & Bacon with Citrus Aioli was beyond boring.  While I didn't expect much flavor from the scallops, there was absolutely none from the aioli, and barely any even from the bacon.  It was ridiculously tiny, four small scallops that were butterflied and then topped.. less food than any one nigiri.  I added a bit of lime juice from the plate decor, and that helped a teensy bit.. but not enough.  In the meantime, our server has disappeared on us.. we haven't seen diddly since our entrees arrived and I mentioned the vinegar overdose.  Neither of us had any soda left in our glasses, but nothing we could do about it.    We finally flagged Justen down and requested our check, at which point he offered us soda refills.  Really?  There was no attempt to offer a replacement on the failed nigiri, there was no service while we were dining.. hope he enjoyed the tiny tip, as I deducted the nigiri from that portion of the tab.  Will we return?  Nope.  One good nigiri and one decent sandwich doesn't make up for boring food and pathetic service."}
{"text":"Adrian was our awesome server for this trip to the Kona Grill.  She's very pleasant and professional and the food was delish!"}
{"text":"I have had better sushi rolls. The food was just ok. The salads were the best. The service was great. I would go back to try happy hour next time, and explore the menu more."}
{"text":"Let's cut to the point...this place sucks. Sprite was flat, whisky with  sprite was flat, Calamari was chewy, service was extremely slow. Sushi was ok but definitely would not recommend or be back."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I am only giving it 4 stars because I love their happy hour and reverse happy hour. I have only gone once during non-happy hour times and felt ripped off. Okay now that all the negativity is done, the happy hour is great. Love getting sushi rolls for almost half price. That always gives me an incentive to try roll I would not have tried for $15.00. The other happy hour items are pretty much regular bar food and they are just as greasy.  My wife also loves mixed drinks during happy hour, but let be serious, that's the appeal for most during happy hour. Here's the bad news, the happy hour is only in the \"bar/patio\" area and gets super full, super fast. This is true at this location and the one at Chandler Fashion Mall."}
{"text":"Kona Grill is located at the Scottsdale Mall and is a combo sushi/asian fusion restaurant.  For those outside of Phoenix, Scottsdale and Kona Grill is the \"hang-out\" place for the late 20 and 30's crowd on the prowl.  As for the food, it is typical and ala Cheesecake Factory quality.  Large portions and competent.  There are no award winning meals here.  It is all about the scene....lamborghinis, luxury SUVs, etc....Scottsdale is fast becoming Orange County."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place, and for a few reasons. 1) A great Happy Hour, and 2) some really good fusion food.  They have a huge bar, a huge area for seating, and a decent size sushi bar.  I've eaten at all three areas and the service has been consistent.  There are a lot of standouts on the menu so you can get whatever you like and expect good food.  I've had excellent sushi and a noodle/beef stir fry that was out of this world.  This is not fine dining but I'd go here again in a minute.  The decor is nuevo Japanese (if there is such a thing).  The hostesses and the waitresses are smoking hot.  I woulda loved to have them feed me the food, nothing like being pampered (damn, time to wake up)."}
{"text":"A warm spring evening on Kona's patio is always an enjoyable experience.   The food and drinks are great. I'm known for being very picky about sushi, but I absolutely love their selection (they use a lot of great flavors and sauces, and it never tastes too fishy). The main menu has a lot of great options as well, and the happy hour specials are a really good deal.   It's also worth nothing that I've never had a bad server here. They're always so friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Wow, I've had a few disappointing visits to this place in the past, but my most recent was just awful on a number of levels. After a long wait, our waitress informed us she'd been \"cut\" for the night. Our replacement waiter was nice but obviously overwhelmed. Our drink was watered down, and our waiter showed no interest in rectifying the situation. Food for each member of our party arrived at different times, and my salad and flatbread arrived at the same time (a pet peeve, and a sign nobody's minding the store). The sushi was passable, but my Margherita pizza was blasphemous and awful. Empty plates sat on our table for 20-30 minutes and even after asking other servers to ask our server about the check, it took another 10 minutes to get it. The agonizingly slow service was clearly the result of poor management, as servers were over-tasked. A series of small annoyances (soy dishes, but no soy sauce; having to ask multiple times for silverware; long periods of inattentiveness) added up to a disappointing experience on what was supposed to be a special occasion. Poorly-trained staff, inept management, lack of attention to details and customer service, mediocre food and inflated prices are not something I will endure again."}
{"text":"Late night dinner.Fresh seafood. The wait staff is very friendly. Good atmosphere and quick service. Waiter was helpful in recommending a few dishes.DELICIOS!! Will def return:)"}
{"text":"Don't go here!! My family and I got so so sick after eating here. Met up with the manager asking questions about my receipt and food poisoning she could of cared less that we all got sick and told me that someone else has called about getting sick that they ate the same night as us. Didn't offer me anything in return told me that the manager needs to investigate. Investigate what? Checking food delivery storage and dates on food etc shouldn't you already be doing that? Terrible just terrible!!! Never again will I waste time and money on this dump!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The service is great and the food is 50% off all day on Sunday! I love that I can sit outside and enjoy fresh sushi and sangria. The sushi chefs are really fun as well if you can get a seat at the sushi bar. Try the tuna wontons SO YUMMY!"}
{"text":"Why do people like this place? Why is it always packed?  I came here over the weekend to grab a drink in between rounds of afternoon shopping.  My friend and I wanted a quick glass of wine (yes, I know, this isn't the place to go for great wine. But I thought we could quickly grab something decent). Let me start off by saying I tried to totally different wines that tasted exactly the same -- sour and rotten. Then we wanted an appetizer. SO I got California Rolls. Now, I know that's kind of lame, for people who are into sushi. I'm not into sushi. Our waitress actually ROLLED HER EYES when I ordered it. Kona Grill, come off it! You're like the Olive Garden of Sushi, and you're judging ME for ordering California rolls??? Then they weren't even very good. And my stomach was upset for about four hours after I ate it. And our waitress took about 30 minutes to bring us our check. And our table was sticky and smelled of beer. Ick.  Never coming back."}
{"text":"We met up with some old friend to catch up for appetizers and spirits.  I love the location and atmosphere of the restaurant.  It is open and a surprising nice view when looking outside the bar.  We went before Cinco De Mayo and saw a group of people riding their bike cruisers to another restaurant.  As they rung their bells and made noise, it definitely enhanced the cool factor as we sat down.  We ordered some sushi and dip.  The food was ok, but nothing to go crazy about.  Definitely something I did not remember.  Therefore, this review is short.  I give this place a cool factor for the ambience and environment.  However, the food is not the best.  I would be back to hang out again, but not for a sit down dinner for the wifey.  There are definitely better sushi places around in Phoenix."}
{"text":"The food was great! We mainly came because of happy hour.. The hostess even said it was happy hour when we came. So we sat and ordered about two or three rolls and some drinks. When the bill came, I was shocked! It was about a $75 bill.. Totally confused about it, so I asked the waitress. She said happy hour was only in the bar.... But when we sat down she even said it was happy hour!! SWe paid the full price, pretty annoyed with what happened. I feel like we got ripped off. I wish I would of talked to a manager. Very disappointed"}
{"text":"I didn't know about the happy hour here until after coming here for the first time. The first time I ordered the Macadamia Nut chicken which was very good, but too pricy for me. The next two times I came during happy hour which I believe starts at 8pm. The calamari, and avocado egg rolls are my favorite on the menu. The calamari is crispy and I love the sauce you dip it in. The avocado egg rolls are filled with fresh avocado, cheese, and tomatoes. SO GOOD. The sushi is pretty good too, but not the best I've ever had. But for the price which is about 3-5 bucks a roll of sushi, it's pretty darn good. I always want to come during happy hour, but it's not exactly the most ideal time of the day to go eat. Can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"People only leave reviews, when they are not happy Why not leave one when you are Thankful!!! Came here with kodos for dinner, happy hour is great! Delicious & Service was perfect Thanks Kona!!!"}
{"text":"I will give this Kona 4 stars. It was almost 3 based on my previous visits when we did happy hour on the patio and service was not real great. Our waitress seemed distracted during our visit. The food and drinks have always ben good and happy hour pricing is also good. Specialty drinks have been very good on our visits. Our last visit the California rolls, edamame and pot stickers were very good and our server Kristen made up for our previous visit server. She kicks ass.   The big ass TV over the bar helps if you want to visit during a sporting event. We got to watch cry baby LeBron in actual size sink the Bulls with a buzzer beater while getting our drink on, good times."}
{"text":"Had booked reservation two days pior and Did not accommodate their mishap for not finding us in their reservation because someone didn't write it down and was unwilling to correct it. Made us wait when we had reservation. Manager glenn unwilling to help"}
{"text":"This was our third stop during our Sunday bar hopping schedule. Typically, I read up on the places near by as we munch an appetizer and savor a tasty beverage. On this occasion we skipped that formality as the previous bartender said that Kona had great food and cheap happy hour prices.  When we arrived, we quickly found two seats at the outdoor bar. I will have to give them a nod for places to people watch. Across from us was a Wilem Dafoe look alike in a black wife beater. He kept muttering to himself (I secretly suspect that he was arguing with himself). A couple of seats down from him was a dude that was rockin the full beach dude hair...party on bra  Ok back to Kona, happy hour drinks were ok, and they were cheap ($5), but the ultra lounge bartenders seemed busier than necessary. We finally settle on a sushi roll for our obligatory app.  Now sushi is one of those dishes that takes a great deal of finesse and precision. You are basically buying about A cup of rice and some uncooked tasties for wrap and filling. Our roll was a happy hour special, so $5 for what would normally cost $10.  What we got was a sad mangled roll. The pieces were so poorly cut, from the side it looked like a cell phone add showing how many bars you can get in this area. The taste was ok, if a bit bland, and the serving temp was decidedly too warm for sushi.  Ok, bottom line here folks, stop buy Kona for happy hour drinks, watch the carnival of lost souls huddled around the bar, and skip the food."}
{"text":"Really nice place and excellent service. Food is great, the atmosphere is very pleasant."}
{"text":"Although RA at Fashion Show is usually my go-to for happy hour-sushi/Japanese food cravings, Kona Grill is a nice alternative when in Summerlin, and it's cheaper than RA!  Just recently we went to Kona for happy hour and although the bar area was crowded (they only offer the happy hour menu on their patio, in the bar area, and at the sushi bar) we were able to find stools right at the main bar. There was actually very ample counterspace (something you may or may not get in certain restaurants when ordering food at the bar) and service was very good.  We ordered items off the happy hour menu: -chardonnay -spicy tuna roll -bbq chicken flatbread -chicken lettuce cups -steak wrap  My favorites were the flatbread and lettuce cups, although everything tasted very good. The best part was the bill...$28! You really can't beat that."}
{"text":"Super yummy.  The Tomato Basil Bisque is my favorite first impression followed by the Chicken Avacado Club. The Applewood bacon is nice and smoky. The Chipotle mayo is the best I've tasted. The Ceasar Salads fell short though. The parmesean chips are good but the actually ceasar sauce was bad. Too much oil and not enough of everything else.   Overall, I'd definitely go back. I'm excited to try the flatbreads. I would've tried one today except their oven is broken. They were nice about it and gave me a discount to accommodate! :D"}
{"text":"First time here and I'll definitely come back. Great service and delicious food. I highly recommend the pork sliders and sweet potato fries! For sliders, you get plenty of food and lots of flavor. The drinks were also made well. I ordered the Cucumber Southside and sampled the Manhattan. Come early for happy hour - the bar and patio fill up quick!"}
{"text":"Yum! We ate here on a Saturday night and it was nice & busy which I always like to see. Our server was very attentive. We told her we wanted to take our time and she didn't rush us at all. The fried calamari was a little greasy, but the delish spicy aioli dipping sauce was definitely worth it. Highly recommend the Bama Roll. Great ambiance as well. Two thumbs up Kona!"}
{"text":"There is something about sitting outside, sometimes under the misters, drinking a 1/2 off drink special, scarfing down appetizers with a table-full of friends and/or family, that makes my heart happy.  Kona, I'm not a big fan of lunch or dinner, but you've got me for an occasional happy hour!"}
{"text":"Very good food, nice atmosphere, very efficient in the happy hour, would go there twice a month. They are very generous in amount of food and they are really good in the quality as well!!!! Recommended!!!"}
{"text":"Came for happy hour and dinner with my kids. I can't order happy hour items in the restaurant with my kids. I have to pay full price for same items ordered 20 feet away. Not an issue at other restaurants. This place is off my family friendly list."}
{"text":"Kona Gill bar/patio area Happy Hour = 4 Stars Kona Grill Sushi Restaurant = 2 stars  Sad but this is a great place with an outdoor patio geared for good HH drinks but not sushi. They now have one of the worst quality/price sushi ratios in the valley.    Icing on the cake is  the fact that the only Japanese beer they have is kirin ichiban. which happens to be my least favorite of the major Asian brews .... oh and it was flat.    Kona Grill may be a fine Grill but they should consider sticking with cooked food.    Take your sushi lust elsewhere but if you just want a drink...don't hesitate."}
{"text":"Who is delicious, service wonderful, Love the food here specially steak. We come here every single time when we stop in Vegas."}
{"text":"Today's experience was super disappointing. I ordered the chicken and shrimp lettuce wraps and there was a small hair in the bowl of chicken and shrimp mix. Unfortunately I didn't see it until after I had one taco which was just yucky. I felt like I had to drown it in sauce to make it taste good. Thankfully they did remove it from my bill.   My daughter ordered California rolls which she said tasted fine but afterwards we went shopping and she had to use the bathroom three times because she suddenly had diarrhea. Wouldn't recommend it or go back!"}
{"text":"We went here for happy hour & before a movie around 4pm on a Sunday, and the hostess  seemed more annoyed to greet us, rather than excited to have guests.   Once up in the bar, the service was great. The food on the other hand wasn't anything to write home about... The avocado egg rolls were filled w/ just avocado, and no seasoning. The potstickers had pre-cooked crumbly chicken filling inside, rather than being raw & seasoned, before cooking through in the fryer...just a weird way to do it... The sushi was a joke, and shouldn't even be called sushi.. Pass on the wave roll & the  bama roll.  But really, it's my mistake thinking that i could find good sushi at a place like this. It's built more for ambiance than food quality.    Great pl for a drink & non-Asian food..."}
{"text":"I'm not generally a fan of restaurants located within a mall, especially if it's a chain restaurant. I just don't care for the mall dining atmosphere. However, Kona Grill really surprised me! Especially the seafood. For a restaurant located in a mall... in Arizona... the seafood was awesome.  There are 3 important things you need to know about Kona Grill:  1. The Sea Bass is melt in your mouth, oh my god, foodgasm, amazing. Our waiter recommended it to us and I was highly skeptical. I thought that he was pushing this dish just because it's the most expensive one on the menu. Well, aside from the fact that it's the priciest item at a chain restaurant, it tastes more like a 5 star dish that would cost double the amount somewhere else. I'm telling you, YOU MUST TRY IT! It has this pan seared taste that is to die for. (I also can't forget to mention that the Salmon is super tasty as well).  2. The Cool Cucumber Mojito is not only refreshing and delicious, but it is also less than 100 calories! It's pretty strong too. This drink is pure heaven for a mojito lover like me, and it gets extra bonus points since its low calorie!    3. Happy hour!!! It's the best and it's always packed. Kona Grill has great deals with always changing specials (I suggest checking their website before heading over).  Just try at least one of these 3 things and you'll see why I'm such a fan of this place. Overall, when it comes to dining at Fashion Square Mall, Kona Grill is pretty impressive."}
{"text":"I went here to celebrate my 50th birthday.  The manager met us at the door and it was an excellent visit from the start!  The macadamia chicken salad was amazing! Customer service outstsnding! Then they topped it off with the best carrot cake of my life! Talk about having your cake and eat it too. Thanks Kona We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in around 10pm last friday and the place was dead!! What happened? Buddy of mine sings Kona's praises but it looks like I missed out. The happy hour specials are definetely sweet, but if you stop in here during non-happy hour times your drinks and food can start to add up. Beer selection was a bit lacking though with the usual craptastic american drafts; but beer is beer."}
{"text":"Food was great but as others have said the service is super slow...do managers even read all these negative reviews about their lack of prompt service?  This was out on the patio Sunday night so maybe the fact it was happy hour meant just take it easy for staff.  Expect at least 10-15 minutes to get a refill and 45 minutes to get food."}
{"text":"ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PLACE!!! One of my favorite Happy Hour spots! Great Vibe, Good food, Awesome sushi, and descent happy hour prices.  The Patio and Bar area is a fun/social setting, however you still have the option to have a nice quiet more personal dinner inside!"}
{"text":"I am sorry that the establishment was so overwhelmed, this is the second time that this has happen, this is a shame because my girlfriends and I adore this place for happy hr  And my bf and I enjoy it for a date night  Waited over 30mins for food and server forgot to place the order, then once they placed the order waited even more time for our food, we nearly missed our evening event. This is truly unacceptable, and most unfavorable review of this old town establishment, great consideration  will be taken when choosing a happy hr place in the future"}
{"text":"Been here once awhile ago. Service is great. Sushi is not that great, too much rice on the rolls and little sashimi. The sushi doesn't seem very fresh. Maybe just this location. I also ordered steak and calamari. Honestly, I'd come for a drink or watch the games, otherwise this is not a dinner place nor do they have good food."}
{"text":"Had craving for the macadamia crusted chicken and stopped in for a visit after having not been here for a few years for lunch.  It was as tasty as I remembered it!"}
{"text":"Good food.  More on the expensive side.  I don't know if it's worth the price but a nice atmosphere and like I said, good food."}
{"text":"Honestly I wish that Kona would extend their happy hour to their dining room... Sometimes it is soooo hard to find a table during happy hour and we have to wait forever to eat... But the food is so good and the prices are so great.. I guess it's just part of their business.  My favorite thing to get is the crab crunch roll.. I could prolly eat three whole rolls by myself... But I shouldn't. Frozen margaritas are super strong if you like you're tequila. Usually have a pretty good beer for the Sam Adams Special which is only 3.50   Rolls and appetizers are half off, and there are other plates for $6 bucks---only the ones onthe list tho (found onthe outside tables)   It's pretty good deal but it def adds up esp if you get to excited! Lol  More food: Bbq chicken flatbread is cheesy and yummy but it is spicy. Avocado egg rolls yummy!! Lettuce wraps are great too.  I recently just tried the bulgogi tacos the tortilla part was good not sure what type they used. Didn't like the sauce tho, it was too salty.  Love Kona HH!!!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed the Sushi Sampler for lunch as always.  The waitress was very accommodating when we told her the chicken lettuce cups appetizer were very salty and had the kitchen give us a newer bowl with less salt.  Very good service."}
{"text":"5 stars are hard to get...  Kona Grill Scottsdale Fashion square is a tasty place to reboot during a marathon shopping day. The mall has a lot of tasty food choices, but the Grill's mix of chique plus sports on TV is perfect for any shopping couple.   Food is ALWAYS excellent and even better on happy hour (3-7, Mon-Fri, 11-2 Sat, and ALL DAY Sun). I'm a big fan of the chicken satay.  Drinks are fresh, though I'd skip the red sangria next time. Full bar w/ $4 well drinks at HH.  On the patio you can people watch all the Fashionista as the arrive at the valet parking are for the mall OR catch up on the games on any of their dozen or so flat screens hung around the bar. Just look up and you get your sports fix.  Kona is the must stop whenever you shop Scottsdale Fashion Square."}
{"text":"I just moved to Arizona from California and I'm an avid sushi connoisseur. This is only the 2nd sushi spot I've checked out so far. I went to Kona Grill yesterday around 3pm which is when their happy hour starts.   You have to eat within the outside patio and bar in order to get the happy hour deals on appetizers, rolls etc. If you dine inside you'll only be to order from the regular menu. $6.00 appetizers, and half price on select sushi rolls.  The outdoor patio is directly under the parking structure and have misters going the entire time to ensure you stay cool while you dine. A heads up for parking! I parked in the regular uncovered parking lot for free. If you choose to park valet in the covered parking its going to cost you $7.00.  This is what I ordered: Drinks: 1 water and 1 diet coke Appetizer - Kona Calamari  Rolls - Philly Roll, Atlantic Roll, and Fiery Shrimp Roll  My take on the Kona calamari : The calamari was presented on a bed of shredded lettuce, and was a mixture of the octopus legs and rings. It also came with a dipping sauce. The calamari was not salty at all kind of bland but that was fixed with a few dips in the dipping sauce which was a bit tangy and  a few dips in  a soy sauce/wasabi/ginger mix.  My take on the Philly Roll: I liked their Philly Roll. It had a nice smokey flavor to it which I'm not sure if it was the cream cheese or salmon.  My take on the Atlantic Roll: The crunchy tempura really makes this roll, it's not the best roll we've had but it was pretty good over all.  My take on the Fiery Shrimp Roll: I expected it to be hot based on it's name, but it's quite deceiving. First off there was next to no spice or fire and there was little to no shrimp.   Service: Service was actually quite good as the waitress kept me hydrated. The only thing that I seemed to notice was the lack of napkins at every table, The only napkins provided outside were the ones for our drinks. If you want them you got to ask for them. Also I had to ask the server for utensils after they dropped off the first round of food. Other than that my overall experience was good. I will definitely be back again to try out other items on their regular menu.   They had some pretty decent adult beverage deals going on during happy hour.If you are looking for a spot to do business talk or just hang out with friends and have a few drinks and affordable sushi then I would recommend you checking this place out.  Until next time cheers and Happy Eating!  CC"}
{"text":"My favorite sushi place, period. Atmosphere is good, food is good, service is good and I'm always happy when I go. Better than RA!"}
{"text":"The coconut mojitos are my all time fave!  The avocado eggrolls are a must!  We love Kona Grill because my hubby can get sushi, while I can get the macadamia nut chicken!  Use Opentable to make a reservation!"}
{"text":"Not a real sushi bar. Rolls were unimpressive. No uni. Service was good, as they were able to accommodate lots of re-dos, specific requests, but I got the feeling multiple waiters tended to suggest higher priced items so maybe there's incentive to move some items over others."}
{"text":"This is a great choice for Happy Hour if you're in the area.  It goes until 7 PM, which is very nice, and there are tables inside and outside.  Service is terrific, and the Food/Drinks are great as well.  We tried the Cheeseburger Sliders, the Chicken Satay, and the Spinach & Artichoke Dip.  I also had a Margarita.  All was delicious and not too pricey.  Nothing is mind-blowing here, but nothing's bad either, so if you're in the area looking for a good place for Happy Hour, I would definitely recommend Kona Grill.  ENJOY!"}
{"text":"Yep, this place is crazy busy.  And like many observations confirm....the appeal of the basement dwelling, exhaust fume-smelling, valet-adjacent eatery escapes me as well - but I keep on going.  The truth is - the singles scene, convenience, taste and value of a Kona Grill happy hour has many people coming back as well.  I was just there on a Monday night - and couldn't believe how busy it was.  And considering the number of reviews this place has is another case in point.   The sushi rolls (california, crab and tuna) are surprisingly good - not amazingly good, but more like \"wow...I can't believe this is $2 sort of good.\"  A friend I usually go with is a calamari junkie - and always orders her own.  I guess it's that good.   I usually get the Maui wraps (i think that's what it's called) with your choice of either halibut or chicken in some kind of slaw - it's great.     Service leaves a bit to be desired.  It's usually pretty bad either because they are so slammed, or because we have some stuck-up blondie broad pissed that she actually has to lift a finger.  Either way it's still a good deal to check out, and I'll be going back again."}
{"text":"No different from the other Kona Grill locations.  I've sampled the sushi and a variety of cooked dishes here and at the other locations over the years and it's all pretty ok, if a bit pricey.    This location is rarely busy, and the service has been fine in my experience.  It's a nice, new location with convenient parking."}
{"text":"The service at this location was really awesome. It always makes me happy when my beverage is refilled without having to ask. As for the meal, I went with the Avocado Chicken Club sandwich, it was delicious! Instead of the taro chips I substituted the garlic green beans, highly recommended! The meal was very flavorful and reasonably priced.   Give this place a whirl if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Okay Kona, you redeemed yourself. After my last experience i didn't think i would be coming back anytime soon, but my friend talked me into happy hour this evening. Our waiter tonight (in the outdoor bar area) was great, he was constintly checking on us to make sure our drinks were filled and to see if we needed more food. Since there were half price items on the happy hour menu of course we went with those items.   Margherita Flatbread: cooked perfectly.... the crust was crispy, the ratio's of tomato & mozzarella were spot on and the balsamic reduction gave it just the right kick.   Crab Crunch Roll: yum, yum and yum.....crab special roll with tempura flakes drizzled with eel sauce. Super delicious.  Philadelphia Roll: smoked salmon, cream cheese and cucumber is a lovely fresh tasting roll.   All in all this dining experience took me from never wanting to come back here to a-okay and will be back to try more options."}
{"text":"Not the best, not the worst but a solid spot you can always go and know you are going to have a good, solid time.   I would and will go back if that helps."}
{"text":"I like this place mostly for the great happy it offers and outdoor seating that's fun during the day and on wonderful summer nights.  The food is priced well even when it's not happy hour and the menu does satisfy varying tastes regardless of who you choose to bring along.  Some of my favorites are the avocado egg rolls and sweet and spicy shrimp along with the chicken satay for appetizers.  As far as the rolls go I haven't had one I didn't like, but what I do like is they have a great selection of cooked food for those that don't enjoy sushi.  I like to meet here for lunch or dates when you want some privacy and you can just get a booth to have to yourself."}
{"text":"Giving an extra star for customer service. Within hours of posting my review, a district manager responded very politely, thanked me for my review, and took my feedback.   Nice work Kona....way to stay in touch with your audience. I'm definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Great food.  Staff was not in the best mood.  Awesome time, never the less.  Would check them out again."}
{"text":"Some reviews on here are strange. I don't exactly think that important factors are being taken into account.  I've been coming here for happy hour and date nights and each time I am happy with the customer service and food. The last time we came, this very nice gentleman helped me out with something on the menu, he knew what he was talking about and it made me feel confident in what I ordered. Of course, our food came out delicious, gorgeous, and on point. I couldn't be happier! This has been my experience every time I come. They have great cocktail options as well, the moscow mule is most recommended. I just go with the kirin + sake. We've never had to wait long to get our orders, we've been surprised that even when busy, someone notices us and mentions they'd be right with us."}
{"text":"Food was decent, service was lacking...entirely. Went in on a Sunday night with my family, there was already a couple groups waiting, but nobody seemed to know where the hostess was. Ten minutes later a girl comes out and seats in a not very crowded restaurant at all. With about maybe 15 empty tables. We only ordered only three things off the menu. 35 minutes later and there is still no food. I go back up to the front of the restaurant looking for the manager, still no hostess at the front. I wait about maybe 10 more minutes until this lady comes out, I didn't even know she worked there because she was wearing regular clothes. I told her my concern and she gave me an attitude about how she just dropped off the food a second ago. That's still about 40 min for three plates. She doesn't even apologize for the wait and gives me look as I walk away. Only thing that saved this dinner was the miso sea bass. Not worth it though. Will not be coming back."}
{"text":"The food was ok. Wouldn't come back. Service was ok. Didn't make up for the basic food."}
{"text":"AMAZING! The service was fast. Food was fantastic. The interior decorating is phenomenal (I don't know about you, but it made me wanna cry, I loved it). Overall a great experience. I came on a Thursday and the place was booming! City atmosphere without the obnoxious people. they have a patio area and I definitely look forward to enjoying the upstairs lounge area once I'm 21. definitely going to be back!   THANK YOU KONA and keep up the amazing quality and service!"}
{"text":"This place has made a 360 from past reviews.  This place was hit and miss.  The food has been right on now.  I have been getting the pork medallions and it has been kick ass good.  The service has been good too.  I will be back."}
{"text":"The food at this location seemed to be better than the Kona I normally go to at Fashion Square. Julez served me at the bar and she was so friendly! She was so much fun to chat with at the bar, she made sure my glass was never empty, and that my food came out quickly!"}
{"text":"Finally stopped in to eat here after saying I need to try that place. Wow do I wish I had come in sooner. The lunch menu prices are great. I will have to come back for dinner soon."}
{"text":"My sister and I went to Kona with the intention of just hacving a few drinks but ended up having dinner.   The weather was so nice so we decided to sit outside, and it was packed! It took quite some time for the waiter to take our order, but he was working on at least 10 other tables, so we understood.  Appetizer- The yellow tail was a little bit more fishy than I like, but the ponzo sauce, cilantro, jalepeno, and crispy rice strips  made for an awesome array of textures! Meal- I ordered the pork tenderloins with mashed potatoes and bok choy. WOW! Simply the best I've ever had. Tender, juicy, perfectly seasoned. A job well done.  We also ordered the Strawberry Basil Lemonade with rum. WOW, DANGEROUS! SOOOOO GOOOOOD!"}
{"text":"The food here is some of the best I have had at fashion square and the surrounding area here in Scottsdale. We got seated fast, food came fast, but the server was MIA for most of the time while we were eating our meal and needed more water for example. Besides that I would recommend Kona and especially the sushi! The rolls are great here"}
{"text":"The new renovation made a whole difference in the atmosphere. Always loved this place. Great food amazing service,  making seating in and out perfect and the upstairs seating area is so gorgeous !!!  the raw tuna ahi is to die for, mouth watering yum. Amazingly sooo good and the mahi-mahi awesome."}
{"text":"I wanted to give this place a one start but because the food was not bad,  I am giving it two. The bad part part was the service,  simply horrible. The table was not well cleaned,  the waiter got an attitude and ignorant. I am not sure if I will go back."}
{"text":"Beautiful renovation. Still the same sub par staff and confusing dumb seating rules. For some reason you can't get happy hour if you are seated at a normal table. And if you are under 21 the ONLY place you can sit is at the sushi bar. I feel like it should only matter if you are 21 if you are sitting at an ACTUAL BAR. This is Kona GRILL not, Kona nightclub. Acting like this is Hakkasan or some shit. I'm 20 years old, I shouldn't be made to feel like I'm a child and need to be separated from other adults. I find this extremely ridiculous. Also it's nearly impossible to receive service. I sat for 10 minutes before a waiter even took my drink order. Our waiter wasn't even polite in the slightest. Every time I thanked him he couldn't even take the time to say you're welcome.The food is good and is the only reason I put up with everything. This is probably the reason I only come every once in awhile. My advice: appeal to EVERYONE, not just rich mid-life crisis summerlin old people that pretend to be young people. Also note that the price of happy hour has risen slightly."}
{"text":"Stopped by here for an early dinner with my husband as we both wanted poke. I ordered the original which included tuna and salmon. My husband ordered the one with shrimp and crab.  It was a bit pricy for the portion but you're on the strip so that was expected. The poke did include generous amount of tuna and salmon, however the sauce was an overkill. I think half of the amount of sauce would have been sufficient. The service was nice and the atmosphere was great. Perhaps, if we end up coming here again, I will order something else."}
{"text":"We were at Kona for their happy hour which is from 3-7. They have a great selection on their happy hour menu and everything we had was excellent. The portion size of the chicken and shrimp lettuce wraps are awesome and very tasty. The drink specials for happy hour aren't as good of a deal imo but still not too bad. It was very crowded and service was average. I would go back in a heartbeat though because the food is delicious!"}
{"text":"We arrived and were promptly seated. We were greeted by our server but she never introduced herself throughout the entire experience. She seemed pleasant enough and warmly asked us what we would like to drink. She left and got our drinks and then returned with a root beer and a sierra mist with no ice for my fiance. My fiance let her know it was out of syrup and she apologized and quickly grabbed another. Note: We are both servers in town so we extraordinarily understanding of service type things because we do it for a living. We put in a order for two of the flat breads and our server disappeared and returned soon after with our share plates. Seems great, right? I thought so, up to that point. She came back and took our order, a burger medium well for my fiance with an extra side of mushrooms and onion straws so she could add them herself and a order of sweet potato fries. As for me I ordered three sushi rolls: a Caterpillar Roll, a Wave Roll, and a Soft Shell Crab Roll. We received our two flat breads relatively fast and were excited to try the new one we'd never had before. We already loved the Margarita one and were looking forward to trying the veggie one. My fiance mentioned to me that we needed salt and napkins. I looked around and saw our server talking to the booths next to us for quite a while each time. Again, understandable. We are servers also and understand some tables are more demanding or maybe they are just friendly. We waited for about 5 minutes until finally I caught her as she was walking by our table and asked for the salt and napkins. If I had not stopped her she would've been gone and I know this because I caught her at the end of the booth almost past us without her checking on us. She finally returned with our napkins and salt around 10 minutes later. I salted my flat bread and dug in. As usual it was tasty and my fiance really enjoyed the steak one that she got minus the bleu cheese. I started to run low on my bottled root beer and again I looked for our server and she was either nowhere to be found or she was talking to another table for like 3 plus minutes. This wouldn't bother me but she never once in our entire dinner did the same with us. We were treated as second thoughts and this was reinforced by our entire experience. My root beer finally ran out and I was starting to get annoyed. I set it to the end of the table next to the glass with just ice and watched her talk to yet another table for about 4 minutes. Finally she walked by and noticed my drink and asked us if we wanted refills. I ordered two root beers this time around because my pet peeve is to not have a drink while I am eating and I predicted I wouldn't easily get another root beer if I ordered just one. She brought these out and we went about eating our starters. We decided to behave ourselves because we had lots of great food coming and didn't want to fill up on the flat breads and that's when my fiance first noticed her burger sitting in the window. We could see because our booth was pointed straight to the kitchen. I took out my clock and marked the time, 7:24pm. The food and burger didn't actually get delivered to us until 7:32. Her burger just sat up there dying in the window. When our food was finally delivered they dropped the burger, fries, and the extra side of sauce that comes with the sweet fries and the server explained it was great. As for my food they plopped down the plates in front of me without ever identifying which rolls were which and then left. My fiance asked for some ketchup and mayo and the server returned with it rather quickly. My fiance was blown away by the size of the burger and despite being in the window for such a long time she said it was tasty. She did notice that the grilled onions that are supposed to come on the burger were not there but made peace with it. Our server did check back on us a few minutes after we began eating and asked us how everything was. This was the only time she came and checked on us until we were almost finished. Note: My fiance didn't know the grilled onions were missing until after this check back. We both enjoyed our food and watched what was going on around us as service industry people do. We both commented on how every single other table she had got loads of attention except us. Maybe she looked at us and thought, young, two top or maybe something else. In some way or form we were marked as being not worth while. We finished up and literally stacked our plates and silverware together so she would get the hint that we were finished and in her industry. She grabbed the stuff and came back a few minutes later. We got a dessert to go and our check. We liked the food and will return again in the future but we will never have this server again. I have referred to her as our server because until we got our bill and saw she had no name she told us. Our server's name was Hayley. Our entire experience was ruined by us being overlooked and ignored."}
{"text":"This Kona Grill is conveniently located inside the Fashion Show Mall. After walking around the mall for a couple of hours, my friend and I decided to make a pit stop here and fuel up on some yummy food. The pictures on Yelp do it fair justice.  For reference, Rome was our hostess. One thing I noticed about her and the other hostess working the area of the restaurant we were in was the very personal service. Genuine smiles the whole time they took your order and if one of them was busy, the other would check on other tables. Wish I knew the other lady's name. A+ for service.  The food was excellent too. I definitely recommend the avocado egg rolls on the appetizer menu. They were served with a honey cilantro sauce that I haven't been able to stop talking about all week. Plus, it's so unique: never seen anything like that on a menu before. We also ordered tuna sliders, Cuban sandwich, and the passion fruit creme brulee. They were all good. I really admired the wide selection of fresh food available here at Kona, especially during these hot summer months.  Chances are if I'm in the area again for shopping, I'll be stopping into Kona for a bite to eat and you should consider doing so too."}
{"text":"This is the only place where I will get sushi. Can't go wrong getting California rolls or crab crunch rolls here! The calamari here is amazing too. My family and I try to come at least once every 2 weeks for their happy hour and we always enjoy ourselves."}
{"text":"The Manager Patrick is absolutely wonderful. The staff is very hospitable and who sushi is unreal. Recommend it for drinks, happy hour, if you want to watch the game. Oh and the ambiance is great too!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place for ages during happy hour. Great, discounted sushi and sake bombers. The only thing besides the servers changing are the prices. I remember when calamari used to be $3! The good old days. Today; however, was the first time a lady gave me the wrong order and I've been here many times. Not only did she apologize for her mistake, she comped me on her mess up. I appreciated that gesture. Great to know that even though pricing will change, the great service I've received will not."}
{"text":"Very busy at lunch yet did not feel crowded.  Opted to sit inside which felt open and airy. Food was good. No complaints. Service was friendly and attentive. Manager was walking around and conversing with patrons.  We will probably go back."}
{"text":"Love this place what can I say ?!! I can't say I have ever had bad service or food served as well. Go try the macadamia crusted chicken and shoyu cream it's to die for and = yummy!!"}
{"text":"Kona Grill has delicious sushi. Every time I go here, it is during Happy hour and I get the Las Vegas roll. I love the fact that on Sunday, they do all day happy hour!!!   I also love their brownies! It is a big brownie and I would suggest splitting it with someone. But it does have ice cream and milk chocolate syrup on top!!!"}
{"text":"First off, no sound on your tv.... for the first Stanley Cup playoff here in Las Vegas.... make that..... las vegas. # no caps......   Add to that a total drenching on the Patio from the Misters, and YES we were told they would be off several times. IE..... see photos, no one has offered one Comp yet!!!!  I will not be back for ANY.... ok my bad, I used CAPS...... for any game....."}
{"text":"Five Stars Yet Again!!  I held my daughter's sweet sixteen birthday party here (this is her favorite place to eat).  I reserved part of the back patio (North end).  Prior to the event, I was a bit nervous because I wasn't sure what to expect for a party of 20 kids and 7 adults.  I've only come to Kona for lunch with a couple other people.  Both Zach (mgr) and Michael (gm) were helpful and prompt in answering all my questions.    On the evening of the event, Zach made sure our party had enough \"private\" space as possible from other patrons on the patio.  We had two waitresses assigned to us full time and the food was plentiful for all.  And super delicious!!  We chose the buffet style, so the kids had a variety.  There was a live band that night and the singer was kind enough to take song requests and sing Happy Birthday to my daughter.  The kids had such a good time eating and mingling that I had a difficult time getting them to leave when the party was over.   Overall, I was more than pleased with the experience and most of all my daughter was happy.  A special thank you to Zach for all that he did to make this a special birthday my daughter will never forget."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in for lunch and we are so pleasantly surprised. We live in MN and have a Kona Grill in our town (Eden Prairie) and we seldom go there bc the food is not all that great. Our server, Jen W, was so great! I am pregnant but really wanted sushi so I was looking for some compromises on the raw. Jen went thru the sushi menu with us and helped us customize the perfect rolls to suit our needs and wants. We also split the Kona Chopped Salad, it was delish! Overall a lovely easy well taken care of lunch. We will definitely be back. Thank you to the wonderful and talented sushi chefs and Jen W for making it a great visit!"}
{"text":"Just had dinner with my coworker. Food was good. Service was great (Thank you Ryan). Over all pleasurable experience. (:"}
{"text":"LOVE the staff especially Nicky, Lorren & Blain... and Matt!!!  Great food!  Fantastic happy hour!  GREAT prices!  PS.. I REALLY like that mojito they have.. YUM!"}
{"text":"I actually have no particular reason I like this place.  The hostess said if we wanted to sit outside we had to find our own seats.  The waitress assumed what we wanted.  Our food took incredibly long to come out given that it was not cooked. On the bright side, the sushi was better than expected; we even wanted a second round of sushi, but  our waitress assumed we were full and finished; feeling like \"pigs\" we asked for the menus back, luckily unbeknownst to us, it was a reverse happy hour starting at 9 pm. Finished off our second meal and left just before the \"20-somethings meet-up club\" event...just kidding but it did become a singles scene."}
{"text":"4 of us went there for happy hour a week ago. This was the first time after the restaurant was remodeled. Looks very nice and modern. The food was good, prices right. The only thing is the waitress upstairs on the patio was in a bad mood. Not sure why. So we asked to be moved downstairs and then we enjoyed our dinner."}
{"text":"Went to this new Kona Grill for our anniversary. Good choice. Very cool decor. Food was good, and service  pleasant and attentive. Highly recommended. Will return."}
{"text":"There is no reason for me not to give the place five stars.  I do you have to come doing happy hour on Saturday from 11 to 1. I tried to wave and chicken wrap and let us tacos and it was delicious. Great service with a smile. Thank you"}
{"text":"Haven't been here since the remodel. It's very nice. Sat at the bar during happy hour. Had the crunchy crab roll. It was mediocre, too much rice and eel sauce. Also had the sliders, it was good, they give 2 decent size burgers. And I also had the sake sangria."}
{"text":"Love this place, great food, great atmosphere and an awesome staff!!!   Fabulous date night place but great to bring the kids also!!!   Happy hour is a must!"}
{"text":"Our server Paola was amazing. We were in a little hurry to get to a show on time and she provided fast and excellent service. Waters were always filled. Food was out extremely fast and was great. She recommended excellent fresh drinks and made sure we were out in time for our show while still being sweet and professional. Many thumbs up for Paola."}
{"text":"Stopped by here since it was convenient and there was no wait. Restaurant was pretty empty on a Saturday lunch hour. We were seated promptly and orders taken quickly. Our server was friendly and attentive which I appreciate. Service was great!  The food was mediocre and overpriced...but that's Vegas. I wasn't expecting anything spectacular, I was just looking for someplace with healthier options. The sushi rice was undercooked, the ahi in the sliders were covered in sesame and masked the flavors of the fish, the chicken club was decent. Overall the food was ok and it did it's job.  If you check in on Yelp, you get a free sushi roll up to the $14. Or get a coupon at one of those discount coupon stands spread around Vegas."}
{"text":"I wasn't sure what to expect after reading the reviews here....while I wouldn't say it's in the basement I do get the whole car fumes thing.  However, we were sitting fairly far back and didn't have any issues with it.  The happy hour offerings are just ok as far as drinks go.  It's a rather limited drink selection, and not really containing anything I drink.  I went with a cosmo which was surprisingly (and thankfully) not too sweet.   My husband was happy to see Sam on a menu, even if they charged him $4.50 for it instead of $4.00  The food sounds interesting but is fairly standard flavor wise.  The chicken macadamia nut tacos didn't really have a mac nut taste to them.  The onion rings were gigantic  (seriously) and were fairly tasteless.  The calamari was decent, but very spicy, and the satay was average.  Perhaps we should have gone with sushi, but being in a place named the Kona Grill I was hoping to get some Hawaiian flavors in there.    The great thing about their happy hour is not just that it's in the mall, but that they do it twice a day.  In theory you could sit there all afternoon drinking, at 7 go into the mall and shop, and come back at 10 to drink some more."}
{"text":"We came back! I knew it wouldn't be long before we did. This was one of our regular spots. Food here is great.  We always sit in Karen's section and she is awesome. If you go request her and you will get great service. Suggest you only dine in here. Have done pick up orders and its ALWAYS a mess. Girls at the front aren't very well organized."}
{"text":"I have been here twice now and loved the food both times. Our server, Roy, was awesome! Recommend the Picasso roll, avocado egg rolls, and tuna wonton crisps!"}
{"text":"Lewis is the man!! Great customer service! Top notch. Great food, excellent drinks, suggestions were spot on.  Perfect spot to people watch and eat outside."}
{"text":"Our server Tana was great even down to making sure my wife's tea was correct and my BBQ sauce was heated I love Kona Grill this is a nice location and the lay out was well thought out"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service!!!! Worse managers I've ever seen. Can't believe such big fancy restaurant  they can have bad service! Food was freezing and managers didn't seem to care. NEVER GOING BACK AGAIN"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and great selection of food. My husband was able to enjoy American while I enjoyed their sushi selection. I really appreciated that our waitress gave a great recommendation of rolls for me to try...yummy!"}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service, food was good. Would be nice if all the prices were posted on the menus. I ordered a sushi / sashimi combo with salad and the creme brulee. I really enjoyed the salad (feta cheese and dressing went very well together) and sushi was good."}
{"text":"Service is absolutely the worst. I have been sitting in the bar at a table with a friend for 15 minutes without anyone even asking if I wanted a glass of water. My friend had a drink with him prior to my arrival. Still no excuse. One waiter and one waitress have walked past at least 5 times each not a word. Now the waitress is serving a father and son who just sat down 5 feet away. The kid is like 12 signs all around that say Person under 21 not allowed in lounge area. INCOMPETENT STAFF LEAD BY INCOMPETENT MANAGEMENT."}
{"text":"Kona to me is the trendy Scottsdale bar that isn't in Scottsdale. Everyone dresses up and gets all fancy to get their sushi on. Fish swim around and watch you eat their friends, which is kind of sad. Good food. OK service."}
{"text":"Michael was an amazing, attentive, informative server. This was my first time here and I was thankful to have a server who cared enough to inform me of what I might enjoy. All my selections were superb! I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I had been to the location at Fashion Show and remembered it being decent. Went back for happy hour with 2 of my friends last week, and I don't think we'll ever be back.   You seat yourself for happy hour in certain areas, so we made our way to the top and found 1 open table in the back. The waitress noticed us fairly quickly and took drink orders. After ordering a few appetizers and rolls, we didn't see our waitress for at least 30 minutes. It probably took over 20 minutes for our drinks to come out and over 45 minutes for the food. The least our waitress could have done was check on us, and let us know our food was on the way.  One of our rolls (the voodoo roll) was so disgusting. Normally my friends and I aren't ones to complain and send food back, but this one was unbearable.  We were hesitant on ordering a replacement roll as we knew it would take a long time to come out. We ordered it anyway, and of course it took at least 20-25 minutes to get our 1 roll.   Then, another 20 to get the check.   Now that I'm thinking about it, restaurants normally do a \"last call\" when happy hour is coming to an end, and that was not given to us either.  It would be one thing if our waitress was stacked with tables and was apologetic for the wait, but she was so nonchalant, and didn't even smile.   Only reason for 2 stars is the crab crunch roll!"}
{"text":"Happy Hour is definitely your best bet.   We stopped in for lunch one day. White truffle lobster mac n' cheese was as comforting as it sounds.  If you order the carrot cake like we did, please be prepared to share, it's huge!   Overall, a great place to eat!"}
{"text":"We love Kona and it is a place we go quite often. The patio is awesome, great happy hour and we love the sushi. We also love the frozen margaritas... come to find out they are taking a new direction and have removed the frozen margaritas from the menu after 25 years! I can't say how disappointed we were and apparently we weren't the only ones because the server said he's heard multiple complaints hence since the new menu. He did make efforts to offer us the new frozen Mai tai with chili pepper which was hideous not my cup of tea but maybe it will do well for them. Unfortunately, we left."}
{"text":"I love going to this place and hanging out at the bar. Sabrina is the coolest bartender ever. She's great at taking care of every customer even on a busy evening. Her sharp wit and sarcastic humor makes conversations enjoyable even though she may mumble at times.  The food is good and always fresh. I recommend the firecracker Sashimi.  Give that girl a raise!"}
{"text":"My husband and I like this place a lot. He has been going to Kona for over a decade. I have only gone been two times. He is a sushi lover-I am not, but they do offer non-sushi foods for the sushi-aversive people. I especially like their happy hour. They have a regular happy hour and then a reverse happy hour, which is great, since I like to eat later in the night. The times I have gone, the service has been pretty good. The staff was friendly, and pretty quick with service.   I think the decor downstairs is beautiful. It reminds me of nice restaurants in Las Vegas.  This place will soon be one of our favorite eating venues."}
{"text":"This was my very first time and I was very impressed. I took my daughter for her birthday and she loves it. Laura was our server and she went above and beyond. Our glasses were never empty and she kept coming back to ask us if we needed anything else. The manager came by and asked how everything is. I like that and I think that's very professional. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Another successful night out at Kona, we had a new bartender tonight who was amazing, Marco, you are awesome!! Now we can come on more nights than just Thursday when Skippers working. We still love Skioper but Marco is right up there!!! Thank you Kona, your atmosphere makes all the difference!! We will always be back!!"}
{"text":"Great service from my server LeAngela she is the best!!!!!! Thank you for being so nice to us and to be so friendly with my little daughter the food is really yummy and service is quickly the spicy edamame is bomb, and passion fruit cocktail is"}
{"text":"I ate lunch here at the bar, on a quiet Tuesday. I have been here many times througout the years, never gotten around to writing a review until now..  I always order the Jalapeno yellowtail sashimi to start - always a 5/5 - good quality hamachi with minimal sauce.  Salmon sushi is ok 3-4/5 (consistently good even if its not the best quality)  Anago is pretty good, be it on a caterpillar role or nigiri 4/5  Rice is fair 4/5  Service was very good 5/5  Never tried the hot food, but all others I have eaten with have never complained  Beer served is nice and cold - better be, as it was an open bar (with air conditioning and fans) but it was 110 degrees outside.  The place is nicely done, perhaps not as nice as the remodeled Chandler location...but that covered location at the mall seems a bit inferior to me....  For a sushi chain, I have always found it to be consistently good all the way around!"}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time last night and was impressed with the food. Although rather pricey, everything I tasted had great flavor and was a decent portion of food. I could not come up with a complaint about any of the menu items I tried, which is about as nice of a compliment as I can give a restaurant. While everything passed the taste test, nothing I ate knocked my socks off and made me want to come back ASAP.  Aside from the food, the staff were friendly, the restaurant looked beautiful and our wine was half off due to happy hour. I was impressed with nearly everything about this restaurant and had a nice time dining here.  So why the 3 star review? Everything seemed to cost $5 more than I would have liked to pay. Yes the food is good, but not THAT good. $10 for 5 above average pot stickers is not something I can see myself paying on a regular basis.  All in all, this restaurant has pretty tasty food and provides a nice environment for a fun night out. If you are dining on a budget, you should probably seek another establishment."}
{"text":"I've eaten at this location a few times and in Scottsdale, AZ. Each time I have never been disappointed. Its just a great place to get a meal with a bit of ambiance and not over priced. I've never been for dinner, but I hear its quite a scene. I always order the tacos and its enough to split with my friends. We also order appetizers so when the tacos come out its the perfect portion. Service is always great. Nothing bad to say."}
{"text":"Food average. But the restaurant was so dirty the bathrooms were gross paper everywhere, missing seat paper covers in every stall. We sat on the patio and the tables were all sticky and the soy bottles, noticed the floor too. Need to step up the cleaning game because what a turn off. I can't even imagine what the kitchen looks like. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Great food! Great service! Alli  makes the best cosmopolitan in town! Carrie would be proud!"}
{"text":"Sunday is all-day Happy Hour for food and drinks- that's reason enough to give this place a try. Grab a cheap, light lunch here between stops browsing the shops in Boca Fashion Village with some friends.   HH eats menu has several sushi rolls half-off and a list of others priced at $6/each- opted for the BAMA ROLL (crab mix, cream cheese, jalapeño, tuna, avocado, soy paper, spicy motoyaki sauce), which I enjoyed and the VOODOO ROLL (spicy crawfish mix, avocado, habanero tuna mix, smelt roe), which was both falling apart and had unbalanced flavors.  Would come back with a group to try more of the HH menu, but the sushi options here seem to be hit or miss based on this and vague prior visits- nothing in particular stands out. The macadamia nut chicken is a tasty dish if you're in the mood for a non-seafood entrée.  Interior is a little swanky, seating available at the sushi bar, alcohol bar, or patio, as well as regular indoor seating. Service is friendly and dishes have nice presentation. Not sure I'd return outside of HH times though."}
{"text":"Finally went to Kona Grill after hearing my friends rave about it for years!!! And had an amazing time. We got there during happy hour so it was even better. Not a  sushi person so I got a bbq chicken flatbread. Tasted awesome and the barbecue taste was very strong. Also shared a snickers ice cream pie? Something like that, it was pretty good! Our waitress Cecilia was great and kept coming over to check up on us. Can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"The best meal we have had in years!!! Athon was an excellent waiter and recommended the Miso Chilean Sea Bass and the Sweet Chili Glazed Salmon. Both meals were fresh and good portions. The flavors of both fish were amazing! The sides were great too! We will definitely be back. Our new favorite restaurant"}
{"text":"Only a few gluten free friendly choices!! So sad!!! Like the place the new seating.. but it's seems the menu is do Limited for us!!"}
{"text":"Tried to eat there with family for lunch.  Only had 1 server who couldn't get to our table to get us even water.  We finally got up and left after 15 minutes."}
{"text":"The service was good and so was the food. Had dinner with my brother for his bday last night. I'd go back...   I was a little disappointed in the overall menu but it got the job done!"}
{"text":"Kona grill is a solid place to hang out and munch on decent japanese/hawaiian/mexican food, especially during Happy Hour!  The one thing you will always notice is that the outdoor patio is perpetually busy and crowded.  We've dined inside and outside and you definitely want to dine outside when possible.  The vibe is totally different and sometimes depressing when dining inside.  Its a little dark and kind of generic in terms of interior design.  The food is pretty solid because they the chef knows that tasty dipping sauce is the key to any tapas-style plate.  Their sauces for all their plates are tasty and flavorful.  Recommendations: chicken lettuce wrap chicken satay Red Sangria Calamari  We will frequent this place often because its close to our house and we can kinda pig out without overloading on carbs."}
{"text":"I think this is a fantastic stop for happy hour appetizers, sushi, and casual drinks.   Everything was very tasty and portioned well enough to share!   You can sit outside and the service was friendly and attentive.  I really enjoyed myself here."}
{"text":"Love Love this place and cannot wait to come back. My roomate and I randomely stumbled upon this place while looking for a lunch spot and what do ya know! its Happy Hour and although we werent going to drink they had a great selection of food on happy hour. Like most happy hour places the portions are small, well not this place. I cant wait to bring others here as well =)"}
{"text":"Great lunch! Hostesses, service staff, waitress and chef all very accommodating. I'm a picky person and I sent my sushi back, chef personally came out, with a brand new cut of the yellowtail; it was absolutely great! Thanks to all at Kona!! We will be back."}
{"text":"Big rolls made here!   We frequent the Scottsdale location more often, which makes  smaller rolls than this location.  I've always enjoyed good quality, consistent sushi at Kona, with attentive service.   They are a bit on the pricey side, bit you can get 2 $50 gift cards at Costco for $80, so makes it more affordable."}
{"text":"I was taking my wife out to dinner and we wanted to something a little different for atmosphere, etc. We decided to go to Kona Grill in Gilbert. Got a table outside, under the misters so we could deal with the heat and the atmosphere was relaxing and we were in a great shape.   The waitress was great and took care of us. My wife ordered what she wanted and I decided to try the sea bass. What a disaster that turned out to be. The plate was delivered and I could already see \"black\" fluid coming out from under the bass. I took one bite and then turned it over. It was burnt, and whomever plated the bass turned it over to disguise it was burnt. I had visions of Gordon Ramsey!  The second attempt was a \"Bass\" covered in butter to disguise any taste whatsoever, but it was not burnt. I did not complain to the manager, as my wife had had a harrowing day with sad news, hence the need for a relaxing dinner. Needless to say, I will not be going there again.   Carl T."}
{"text":"This place has the worst customer service with bad stale food. In addition, the manager Don is incompetent. I would never go back and I do not recommend this place to anyone not even my enemies."}
{"text":"Wanted to check this place out and wanted to be out in the patio but it was packed! The three girls in the front didn't help much at all and one didn't even seem to want to be there. That alone was off to a bad start... Then finally decided to get a table and that took some time and then finally sat. our waitress was attentive so I will add another star just for her. Food was all right, and the mojitos were pricey and could of been better. Wasn't able to be apart of the happy hour so that's that.   People watched and notice the girls in the front seem to pick and choose who they want to help look for a happy hour table. The hospitality from them sucked and I don't think I will be back."}
{"text":"Food here is legit. While the costumer service needs improvement, I'll give them the benefit of the doubt because I think their food is awesome. Prices are high by my standards, but partially due to uptown locations. Slightly disappointed that management removed veteran food industry workers, shows weak management. Won't let that news effect my food rating, price drop would give it a 5."}
{"text":"We tried the lobster and asparagus roll which was good.  The black cod was moist which is how I like my fish cooked. It was a tad salty though but I still finished it as the sauce or soupy liquid it came with was delish.  It was good that we at least tried the place. Nothing extra special to rave about though. Good customer service."}
{"text":"We got food poising. The eel sauce on our food looked very old and thick like it sat out for days.  The water tasted like sewer water."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go for happy hour, great specials.  Seating is tricky but possible."}
{"text":"Great place located in chandler mall. Always have very good service. Plus food is brought out perfect.   Had staffers Madison, and Joe. Both were great also, will-continue to eat here"}
{"text":"This Place was nice, clean, and the staff was friendly. I had their sushi sampler with a side salad and my lover had their beef bulgogi tacos. I felt the tacos were a bit on the sweet side but it was good. sushi sampler was good too."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend recently. Got the MOST SPICY sushi roll that they had to offer. It had like jalepenos, habeneros, siracha, chili sauce, wasabi, horseradish, wrapped up with tuna and rice. Freaking best experience even if it sparked a tear in my eye or two...  I came here during happy hour and it was badass. Drinks were decent, beer selections are solid for a Japanese grade restaurant and the servers were wonderfully attentive to our needs, making our overall experience very much worthwhile.  Washed down my spicy sushi with some classic sliders cooked medium rare. I have to say, they were the damn best burgers I've had EVER. Like ever in my brief 24 years of existence on this planet.  Would come back to this restaurant with friends. MAYBE a date.  BTW, I find this review by Bree B. on 6/29/2014 humorous as hell: \"At Chandler Mall - it got a little old. No one was too weird, or too skimpily dressed. There was no drama or good eavesdropping or relationships ending.\" People break up at sushi restaurants in Scottsdale? What??"}
{"text":"VISIT DATE: 1/14/2017  In my experience, fusion restaurants are a challenge. You have to find a right central pallete to reach the highest number of customers while not alienating a large chunk of them. Kona Grill attempts to find the the balance between western \"steak-and-potatoes\" fare and eastern \"sushi\" flair. But in their attempts to reach this balance, they find blunder instead.  First, the good:  -The menu is organized between western offerings on side of their large menu, and eastern selections on their backside. -The dining room is slick with low lighting while appearing trendy, not divey. -The sushi bar is against the left side when the customer walks in and faces the outside. -Outside has misters for summer, gas lights for winter.  And the bad: -Way too many menu items. As soon as I see the many items that Kona Grill has, I get weary and start wondering if the seafood items are fresh. Which, to my dismay, they aren't. It's Arizona after all, but I figured with the high price point they'd offer fresh seafood like Bluewater Grille does in Phoenix, AZ and Irvine, CA. -Eastern offerings need help. Seriously, I don't know why people order sushi in Arizona and call it \"fresh\". Sure, maybe the fish they have will pass some state or even federal inspection, but you're talking about fulfilling the minimum standard. When you're shelling out $10+ a plate for sushi, don't you want fresher than minimum standard? -I found bones in my atlantic roll (baked salmon roll basically). Literally. Every. Piece. I had to stop eating it in fear of choking. -The filet mignon dish ordered was seared on the outside (good) but completely rare in the middle. Wasn't asked to be cooked rare. Considering how busy the place was at the time, flagging our server was nearly impossible, so we just didn't want to talk about this at all while on-site. NOTE TO RESTAURANT OWNERS: Don't blame the servers on this one. Your restaurant was incredibly short staffed that night. A good manager takes responsibility instead of passing off blame to their subordinates.  TAKEAWAY: The worst thing a restaurant can do is try to focus on too many things and be terrible at all of them. Gordon Ramsay and In-N-Out may appear to be opposites, but one thing they have in common is they focus on simple menus and as a result, do great things with the limited selections. In turn this focus allows the establishment to lock down other elements of the restaurant, like having the right amount of labor and ensuring your back-of-house kitchen staff feel great to be part of the team. From the lackluster quality of food that I received, it sure suggests the worst.  Kona Grill desperately needs to simplify and focus on the core elements of what makes a great restaurant customer experience.  Yelp's rating system sums up the 2 star summary nicely: \"Meh, I've experienced better.\""}
{"text":"Happy hour is great... Good prices, nice selection. Love the flatbreads and the ahi burger is soooo tasty! Great for the kids, too, as it's dark and loud inside."}
{"text":"My husband and I have eaten here a number of times but this time was not good.  Service was great, we were there at happy hour on a Wednesday and he did a great job.  The quality of food was not there, the calamari was tough and chewy, over cooked, the sushi roll was  crunchy tuna roll was mostly sticky rice and a tiny filling in the center, flavorless!  The pig wing was just OK but not great and out of place on an Asian menu in my opinion.  Disappointed in how the quality of food was not there!  Makes me hesitant to ever go back!"}
{"text":"I could barely hear myself think let alone carry on a conversation.  I know some people like that - and I do too if I am at a concert - but to have an early dinner I found the place pretentious, expensive, and so loud that it irritated me which irritated my date and we left before eating anything."}
{"text":"I love this place! The servers are nice and suggestive and the food is great! They have a nice menu with lots of choices! I wish they had a location in San Diego because my wife and I would frequent there!"}
{"text":"Tonight we ate at the Kona Grill (Las Vegas) location. We wanted to take the time to commend Nikki on her outstanding service. She ensured that we had the five star experience. She was very knowledgeable about the menu and gave us outstanding recommendations. A big thank you to Nikki for being one of the best servers we've had here in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Kona is average.  It's a tough area!  There are soooooo many good sushi places in Old Town/Downtown area---Kona usually does not compare.    The food is just okay.   They are not bad, but they are not great either.   Price points are on the high side.  The service is fine.  If you are in the mall, and want sushi, I'd say go to Kona.  You will have a good experience.  But if you aren't already at the mall, their are many places in the town where you can have a great experience."}
{"text":"Great food ! Happy hour is great and they have late hours that I was shocked about ... We walked in around 10:30 Christina our waitress was so cute ... Will def return on future Vegas trips and although I didn't know this was a chain and having found out they will open other locations I'll keep it in mind ... Lovely Decor and the music they play is great ... Overall great experience for sure :)"}
{"text":"Ordered the sushi and thanks to our waiter Megan who suggested the Macadamia Chicken we left full, happy and will definitely be back.  Atmosphere, food and service was EXCELLENT!"}
{"text":"I went to this establishment a few days ago the Ambiance is lovely and the environment is visually appealing. After appetizers are served and I'm about three-quarters of the way into my blue moon I noticed a very obvious cockroach in my orange wedge that comes with the blue moon this immediately disgust me. The Cockroach was about the size of my pinky nail bed which made it a little difficult to identify I showed it to my friend who confirmed it was a cockroach my appetite was immediately ruined and we called for the waiter I already had it down on the plate to show him. As I'm showing him he says no it looks like a fruit fly and I responded by saying this is absolutely not a fruit fly unless this fruit fly is on steroids and moonlights as a cockroach. I told him my meal was ruined because it really was and we shouldn't have to pay for anything because we haven't even eaten I had maybe two pieces of my spicy tuna. The manager came over I explained the situation he was very negligent of my concern did not seem to care that I was clearly upset to the point that I was ready to vomit. He looked at my friend and rolled his eyes as though I was being dramatic excuse me there's a cockroach in my drink! He then proceeded to say that it was a fruit fly and I said no it's not can I see it he told me they threw it away already and I said well then I want to see the fruit fly please bring the orange back to the table he refused said they threw it away and he wasnt going \"dumpster diving\" and he wasn't going dumpster diving my response was where is the dumpster I will fish it out myself because that was not a fruit fly. At this point he's very intimidated with the conversation and practically trembling I told him we should not be required to pay for a meal that we didn't eat and I was definitely not going to pay for a drink that had a cockroach! We hooved it over to BJs Brewery...  Ambiance was better the service was extremely better and I had the blonde Pale Ale (less the cockroach). the service was fabulous. At Kona I tipped the server double the tab that I didn't have to pay because it's a matter of principle if somebody says There's a Bug in my drink or a hair in my food Hospitality means you don't question that you just take care of them I was very disappointed by the overly priced sushi roll and extremely condescending attitude from the manager. I won't be going back to Kona but BJs Brewery was awesome!"}
{"text":"Service at the bar from the bartenders is outstanding.  My experience with the service from the wait staff for the bar tables and restaurant is usually slow and not great.  Management is always nice and quick to make corrective action upon customer request but sit at the bar if you can."}
{"text":"Ok, I don't Yelp a lot but, I got to give these guys 5 Stars! Sunday: Macadamia Nut chicken rocks and I'm a beef guy! Monday night: Manager Ron was very attentive and cool as hell. The staff are awesome! The Tuna Crisps are crazy good! Tuesday: Slept! Wed: beautiful people everywhere! Welcomed like family. Great staff, again! This outdoor bar is something else! I will be back again! Thanks Ron and staff!"}
{"text":"awful food slow service okd tasting fish mayonnaise on everything. just awful. would not go back again"}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere and good bar service.  This is a good place to stop and watch a game or have a beer if Yardhouse is too packed on a Friday night while shopping with your lady.  The bartender is friendly and there are plenty open seats at the bar.  Unfortunately, they only have 1 IPA on tap and its not a very good one.    It's 2016...every bar should have a decent selection of local craft these days (brewed AND owned locally unlike those sellouts at Fourpeaks)."}
{"text":"Overall, service is terrible and food is average quality. We ordered several entrees and they messed up my order twice. I ordered the Kahuna Cheeseburger with the meat well done.  The order came out and I asked for Ketchup. The waitress never came back with the ketchup. When I cut my burger in half, it was medium rare. The chef fixed it and brought it back 20 mins later. When I bite into it, it was so bitter bc apparently the chef burnt the pattie but felt the customer will not taste the ashy burnt pattie? If I could, I would have made the chef eat it and see how he like it. It took them almost 30 mins to remake the order again. By then, I have totally lost my appetite from waiting almost an hr for my entree and requested for my food To-Go. Towards the end, the Manager did come to our table to apologize. He gave us a coupon for 2 free appetizers for the next visit which we gave to our neighbor. May be our neighbor will have a better experience than we did. But we would not return to the Kona Grill in Scottsdale Quarter due to poor service (0.5 star)and the food quality did not wow us (2 stars) and since the Manager acknowledge the situation and try to make it better, we gave another 0.5 star so total, they get 3 stars from us."}
{"text":"Kona Grill was pretty good but I expected more based on the reviews. Service was outstanding and the venue was great, but the sushi was mediocre in my opinion. Had the tuna crisps for an appetizer which were good, our favorite roll was the Picasso roll. Can't remember what the other roll was but it was just ok."}
{"text":"Food is over priced and not that tasty. Stay away from the sushi. The service was good everything was fast"}
{"text":"Horrible sushi or food took forever OK sort a friendly staff The food took forever to come out.   Sushi was horrible. It took forever just to get ketchup"}
{"text":"I freekin love the sliders and the pot stickers...Definitely a big thumbs up"}
{"text":"The food is absolutely delicious. We had the chicken caprese and sushi, AMAZING. Love the fact that happy hour is early, and easy access to shopping after. I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!  We went in for Happy Hour and we got the Philly Roll, Atlantic Roll, potstickers, edamame, AND calamari.  It was awesome, and so was our bill.  The service was amazing, and the manager (Eddie) was on the floor helping out and assisting with the servers, which is something I always notice.  We left very full and very happy!! If you like sushi and happy hour, I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Great service !!! Delicious sushi !! We just moved from Honolulu and are so excited to see some familiar food.  Great happy hour prices and kid friendly.   Will come back a lot!!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Came here once for dinner and returned the next day for happy hour during our recent trip. Food is fresh and portion is good, service is great (thanks Jason!) and price is reasonable ( happy hour price is even better). Lots of drink choice. There is a yelp coupon for free appetizer or sushi roll. Our favorites dragon roll, chicken&shrimp lettuce wrap and grill sea bass. This place is in the Fashion Show mall, outside patio looking at the strip across from Wynn. Definitely will come back again next Vegas trip!"}
{"text":"The Happy Hour at Kona used to be a great value for the food before the remodel.The remodel is nice.  They have raised their prices but I don't think the quality went up with the price increase."}
{"text":"I'm from Hawaii, so I guess I have pretty high standards for seafood. I got the abalone and scallop ceviche. The abalone was very tough. It was like chewing on rubber. The flavor was good. I liked the lime and the capers. It would be better if the abalone was pounded out. The Moscow mule was decent. Sake was basic stuff you could get anywhere. Service was good. I got four drinks and an appetizer for over $60. I would rather have gone to four peaks."}
{"text":"This chain has a tiny menu with limited choices and the choices available are generally not good. I had to abandon my chicken club sandwich due to fatty and inedible chicken cutlet. It was like trying to eat a rubber chicken and the sweet potato fries ($1 upcharge) were not hot either. The chicken should have been pounded out more, but even then it may have still been rubbery. The free appetizer of shrimp tempura roll was pretty average and tasteless. Two other people at table had somewhat blase salads with the main ingredient being lettuce and not enough toppings. I ended up not even eating. High Street restaurants are junk and this chain has way too many valley locations."}
{"text":"We were starving when we came here! We got to sliders and it was happy hour so they were eight dollars down from $12 however we had a get one free appetizer because you can go to the website and sign up. We also got the lettuce wraps along with California rolls and tuna rolls. There was so much food we had to take a burger and some lettuce wraps to go. And lettuce wraps come with two different sauces. I asked for extra barbecue sauce on the side, It is kind of spicy but it adds a little bit of a kick to your burger and is delicious!. The service was really good we had two servers that were helping us during happy hour however it was a bit slow."}
{"text":"Went there with a co-worker today Ordered spinach artichoke dip which unfortunately I did not like at all.  Our main entree was the caprese sandwich It was pretty good considering better than the appetizer.  The service was great  But overall I would not eat here again. The sushi looked amazing but everything else is bland and needs some taste."}
{"text":"It is absolutely gorgeous decor. A beautiful fish tank, unique wicker lanterns and huge dinning and patio area; definitely a different feel from the original location.  The food did not disappoint either. Sushi rolls her are delicious. You've got to try the Yamada Roll!!! It's tempura sea bass!!!! Also the yellowtail sashimi with jalapeño! The pad Thai was a weird flavor. Sea Bass was good, just a small portion. Lobster Mac and cheese was savory as well. If you order the carrot cake, be prepare to dear with a few people because the slices are huge!   Staff was very accommodation to my temporary wheelchair needs. They even moved furniture around in order to seat me. My only issue was that the runners didn't seem to know which table was which and who ordered what. We received a calamari that we ordered about a minute after we ordered it and that's because it belonged to another table. After we received our pad Thai, they brought over two more that we didn't order. They were also coming around asking if we ordered some of the plates they had in their hand.  They need to get this together and read tickets, study table numbers or something because it was light weight annoying."}
{"text":"Very good food, somewhat limited menu, service sometimes good sometimes slow, can be very noisy unless you sit in the back, somewhat pricey, parking can be difficult."}
{"text":"This place is good because of its atmosphere and looks. Honestly the food here is whatever for it being such a good restaurant. Sushi here sucks, not real sushi quality unless you like your rolls plain with no dressing/seasoning. Drinks and appetizers are the only good thing here. Fried calamari is amazing"}
{"text":"Really like this place and it's happy hour especially ! Great food and atmosphere , especially  if  you want to watch sports . All day happy hour on Sunday too! Nice people , warm ambiance, and good service !"}
{"text":"Met friends for Bachelorette dinner; disappointing! Poor service, Kona Chopped Salad was uninspiring AND NOT CHOPPED!"}
{"text":"I love their happy hour. Their menu is super. The following items are on my list of favorite items at Kona: margarita flat bread, the tuna crisps and avocado rolls. Unfortunately, the drinks are not so good. The cocktails taste like cough syrup but if you stick with beer I think you should be fine. The tables for big groups are hard to come by but for groups of 2 or 4 people it is usually fine. The location is so much fun because after happy hour you and your friends can go shopping which is an activity that is highly enhanced by being tipsy :)"}
{"text":"HAWAIIAN.    That categorization usually sends me running: Kona Grill has your burgers, Asian Fusion and sushi.    I should have stuck with anything but sushi.  But sushi always is my weakness.    The rolls were mediocre, but the prices were fair, about $8 a roll and the service was great.  They really cater to all age groups: from the young hipsters to the one's toting kids: a kids menu, crayons, no-spill cups and special plastic pieces to make chopstick maneuvering easier are provided."}
{"text":"Pet peeves of mine include expensive sushi that doesn't wow me, oh, and snobs. The customers who drive up in their super expensive cars and think this place is the s***? Hmm.. doesn't impress me. That's Scottsdale for ya.  I do have to admit that the Sweet Chili Glazed Salmon was pretty good (shrimp and pork fried rice, with veggies), but the California rolls were just meager and overpriced. Kris had the pad thai noodles, which he says was pretty tasty. Very white-washed, don't expect any type of authentic asian food. I believe I said this place is like a P.F. Chang's, but Japanese style."}
{"text":"Thank you to everyone at the Boca Kona for making my experience exceptional! We were wowed by or complete experience!!! Loved the Earl Grey Old Fashioned and the happy hour is fantastic. Try the avocado egg rolls or the jalapeño yellowtail sashimi!!! The GM Jose Perez came and visited our party of 7 sitting outside on the patio to make sure we got the best care. Also BIG SHOUT OUT to Ryan our server who was on point and never made us ask for a thing! Thank you to everyone my family was very impressed by the delicious food and drinks and even more so with the welcoming staff and management team!!!"}
{"text":"Had lunch today after kids' dental appointment across the street. The service was great - server was friendly, the hostess was kind to ask us if we needed more refills for the drinks. One of the managers was super kind and gave my kids some wet pipes that they use for sushi bar (pour some warm water over the paper hand wipes). My kids enjoyed their kids lunch menu - mac & cheese and flat bread, they were tasty and I had yummy sushi & roll lunch. Overall, we had a great lunch experience there. Will go back there again!"}
{"text":"Very good happy hour, but service was just god awful. Water was always empty and server was never present. Maybe after 20 minutes of waiting we finally got our check. In all, good food, poor service."}
{"text":"I made a reservation at the Kona at City North on a Sun. night for a party of 8 to celebrate 3 birthdays and an anniversary.  When I booked the reservation, we all decided that Sun. would be great because they offer happy hour all day so we could enjoy the HH menu for our appetizers before dinner.  I confirmed with the girl who took our reservation that we would be doing HH & having dinner.  She asked where we would like to sit & I told her the dining room since there was 8 of us, 2 of which were kids.  AT THAT POINT, THE PERSON TAKING MY RESERVATION SHOULD HAVE TOLD US THAT WE CANNOT ENJOY THE  HH MENU IN THE DINING AREA....THAT WE WOULD NEED TO BE SEATED IN THE BAR IF WE WANTED ANYTHING FROM THE HH MENU!!!  Well....that was not the case.  Once we arrived & were seated in the dining room, when I asked to see the HH menu to order our apps, the waiter informed us that we weren't allowed to enjoy any HH menu items in the dining room.  If we wanted to we could be moved into the bar area which was literally 15 feet away from where we were already seated.  Our waiter, Colin, was very nice & apologetic about the issue.  Eventually, the manager on duty came over & said there was \"nothing else he can do about this issue\".....meaning we would have to get up & move our entire party with the 2 kids into the bar area that was only 15 feet away from the table we were currently at.  We ended up staying at our table in the dining room but told the manager how ridiculous that HH menu rule is, especially when we were literally the ONLY people sitting in the empty dining room the ENTIRE 2 hours we were there.  Our food was ok at best.....took forever to get one of the flatbread pizzas for my boys.  At least our waiter was very nice & apologized again for the HH menu debacle.  We told him it was not his fault & that the manager (Trevor) should have made an exception this one time due to the miscommunication of how our reservation was booked.  Moral of this review.....if a restaurant manager is not willing to do the right thing for that situation, get up & leave!!!!!"}
{"text":"Happy Hour is extremely reasonable!  I always get their pizza margarita, crunch roll sushi,  and calamari! And of course their mango margarita!    Outside dining is fabulous and spacious. There is a TV to watch the game too!  It's locate next to Tivoli Village... very nice area!"}
{"text":"We always enjoyed Kona's food and staff for many years. Recently, our last four visits have been grossly disappointing. Very poor staff attention, food ( old, frozen and inedible chicken parts were a horror) when we mentioned this to the server she didn't offer to present another plate nor did she mention it to the manager so that our needs could be met. Not good at all!! Not an acceptable restaurant practice.  Portions are also decreased in size, prices have gone up not in accordance to the fare and dining experience,  individual waitress attention is very poor (table was not cleared after our dinner) and then, to top it off, we were charged for an extra drink that we didn't order. When we pointed this out to our waitress, she said well ok, and then charged us anyway. The once huge sushi rolls are now the size of a nickel and mostly filled with rice. All in all, this is not the Kona we loved for 12 years.  Seems like once they \"upgraded\" they also upgraded the cost and the selections offered, especially on Happy Hour (as noted by many). One waiter mentioned that \"we are trying to get people back\"....not working at all.  Kona also shortened their Happy Hours as well as, closing earlier every day! Things must be bad. Not ever going back!"}
{"text":"Kona is the epitome of restaurants. Super well run corporate restaurant with an undeniable local feel. Staff hires are top notch and trained to high level just not available at other places.  The food is just awesome, pricing is super reasonable, there is something for everyone. The execution from management checking in on us to the bar backs hustling, they execute on all cylinders and the reality is few do these days. They will gladly make whatever you want or any combination of the ingredients with out a glitch or at least a quizzical glance followed by, okay anything else? Marco is the man tonight"}
{"text":"Excellent place for lunch or Dinner.  Every food option is great and the employees are well trained.  The manager Eddie is super cool too and he always makes sure you have a great experience."}
{"text":"Food was great as usual but waitress needs to find a job she enjoys. Avoid this place at all cost!!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best Kona Grill in town. The atmosphere of this location is always great. Music selection is great. Staff is great! Always very attentive. Oooh and can't beat the happy hour specials (half off rolls). Extremely happy customer keep it up"}
{"text":"The last night of this vacation in LV, my son didn't want to walk too far away from our hotel, so we found this restaurant on yelp. The Pad Thai noodles is better than our expectation. It's a little bit sweet and not so spicy as a regular Thai cuisines. The lobster mac & cheese is also great, it's not so salty as the similar courses that we used to have in other restaurants. My whole family like this place. We'll probably visit here again when we come to Vegas next time."}
{"text":"Being a sushi lover, I was a bit skeptical about ordering sushi in Scottsdale, AZ...but I'm so glad I gave in!    The albacore tataki appetizer and the spicy hamachi roll here was delicious! I have to say I probably liked the tataki dish here better than I do at one of my favorite local spot in San Jose.  This is a definitely a must try! And I will definitely come back here again during my next visit..."}
{"text":"Kona Grill is the go to spot if you're looking for a place to eat in Boca Park. Their Happy Hour is incredible, offering calamari, flatbreads, and sliders for $6 a plate. I had a table of 3 very hungry people and our bill was under $50."}
{"text":"Kona grill never disappoints me!! Always on point, it is my favorite place to eat. Whenever I have friends in town I always take them to Kona Grill because I know that they will just love it and they always do! I always try a new item on their menu and it is always amazing and delicious, so glad i live in a city that has Kona Grill!!"}
{"text":"Kona grill is by far my favorite restaurant in Arizona. I just love this place. One of my favorite dishes is the macadamia chicken nut such an awesome dish. It was great as usual however i was disappointed when i learned that they replaced the zucchini mix salad with broccoli or brussel sprouts. I think Kona grill is such a special restaurant and these sides are very simple and not Kona grill material. Anyone can offer steamed broccoli as a side but Kona grill is not like any other restaurant and shouldn't settle for regular options to stay distinguished in the market. I hope you bring back the zucchini mix side and keep doing the awesome job you always do :)"}
{"text":"Came here with a buddy after leaving another place that had VERY rude customer service.  Service here is EXCELLENT. We were greeted with smiles and out waitress has excellent timing as well as shared a few laughs with us. NICE!!  We ordered a 5-spice Grilled Chicken BBQ pizza. The crust was light and crispy the way a pizza should be. The wait was amazing, under 15 minutes and the pizza came out. The sauce tasted more like Cattlemen's BBQ sauce then anything 5 spice but overall it was excellent.  Will likely return for a more serious mean."}
{"text":"Wow. Just wow. I am a very needy customer, as i am dairy free. While i often find restaurant staff either unwilling to accommodate me, or doing so with a bad attitude, Kona has impressed.  Sophie is MY server, and she is always fantastic. She is on top of my dairy allergy, and is very clearly concerned. Sophie always makes sure that i am happy, and has immediately rectified anything I have seen as an issue. Always ask for SOPHIE!  The reason I came here originally it was just to get a happy hour drink. Now that I know that they'll accommodate my dairy allergy I will continue to patronize Kona Grill, for drinks and food, aa long as Sophie continues to serve me. This is an excellent restaurant, and i only have great things to say."}
{"text":"The restaurant is brand new.  Great food. The staff are trying to find their ways around.  Ambiance is great.  Management was on top of it if there was any issues.  Hard working staff.. I think they will find their rhythm and momentum.. best wishes..."}
{"text":"Not a fan, will update later, but I definitely felt that this needed to be put up ASAP!!"}
{"text":"If there was a zero star I would rate it such. I wish there was something good I could say about it but there really isn't. I had one of the overall worst experiences at a restaurant. It was homecoming night and my date and I had a time crunch along with our friends. We told kona grill before we showed up and our waiter that we needed our food quickly. However, we ordered and our food and it didn't come out for a very long time. We watched people that ordered after us get there food before we did. I asked the waiter where our food was multiple times and each time he ignored me. When we ended up getting our food, it was not even close to the correct order that we had asked for. However, we didn't have time to say anything since we had to box up our food and eat it at our dance. I am very disappointed and would recommend any other restaurant besides this one."}
{"text":"I went to kona grill - around happy hour and sat at the bar by myself- idk if the drain was clogged but the bar could not have smelled worse. It was appalling- I initially blew it off thinking maybe it would change - then I lifted my arms and my sweater stuck to the bar - i ordered a bud light - happy hour price was average. I did not stay to eat though- could you blame me?"}
{"text":"Enjoyed my first experience and good food and solid service with my babe!! #SushiDate"}
{"text":"In Vegas with family and wanted to try a new restaurant. Kona Grill looked good on Yelp and didn't take long to walk to. This place definitely did not disappoint!  Walked in a bit after 7pm and there was no wait. Our server (I believe his name was Jason), was superb. Very courteous and recommended the yamada roll (which we got free for checking in!).   Other dishes we ordered:  1) NY Strip: medium-well was a bit more well done than medium, but not bad. Came with mashed potatoes, grilled Brussels sprouts, and bacon bits. All very good! 2) Lobster Mac N Cheese: my FAVORITE! Super cheesy and they do NOT skimp on the lobster. Extra cheese baked on top was an added bonus.  3) Lemon-Garlic Shrimp Penne: average. Good but nothing overly impressive. Decent choice for my mom who can't have too much spice/fat/etc.  4) Avocado Chicken Club sandwich: not quite my cup of tea but my sister loved it. Comes with snackable taro chips.   Overall this place is pricier than we would normally go for, but we can't really complain. Food was delicious, service was excellent, and location is convenient!"}
{"text":"Ok ... I going to raise my rating to 4 stars due to the food is so good and it is close to the house. Service for our table was better than the last few times for lunch. The remodeling is done and it looks great. Humongous TV in the bar section for watching sports. New pictures on the walls in the dinning room area and a fresh coat of paint with colorful accents in the right places. Food was again consistently good and arrived quickly. I could eat the Kona Calamari starter over and over again with their spicy aioli dipping sauce. Kona Club Sandwich with the yummy taro chips was giant and very tasty as well.  My only disappointment was having to watch some of the apparently not busy servers gathering up around the cute front hostess and acting like a group of HIGH school students horsing around in the hallways at school. I expect a little more of a HIGHER end experience at this location. After all it is located on HIGH ST. Good thing the food rocks! See you next time."}
{"text":"This place is always awesome. They have comfort food, healthy food, allergy friendly food, sushi, delicious cocktails, and a great wine list to boot. The restaurant is sleek yet comfortable, lively, and there are two patios to choose from for outdoor seating. Mike the bartender is my favourite,  but basically all of them are pretty cool.  It tends to be a 30 and up crowd that is ready to party."}
{"text":"Definitely a place I would recommend. Service was excellent. Came here with group on 12 and no one had any complaints. I personally had the Rainbow Roll and the Kona Churrasco. For desert I had the Butter Cake. All of it was excellent."}
{"text":"This is the newest Kona in town. I've been to a Kona Grill in Kansas City and the one at the High Street, and this venue is by far the nicest. I came here for a yelp elite event prior to their grand opening where we sampled almost everything on the menu. We also got to meet the manager and staff. It was so good I decided to come back for more on opening day.   The venue is large with plenty of seating, so we didn't have a wait. We got the outdoor shaded patio seating. There are TVs available so we were able to watch the NBA finals.   Their service is world-class and second to none. My server, Anthony, was attentive and remembered my name (just have a look at my name and you'll know why that's impressive). He was able to explain everything on the menu in detail and gave great recommendations. Plus, the servers here all look like they are models.   Let's talk drinks. They have mixed drinks, beers, sake, and wine. Summer in the City is a must have, gin-based with pineapple. If you haven't been to Kona Grill before, their menu is super diverse. From burgers to sushi, they have it all. For appetizers, we ordered the lettuce wrap. They also have the \"fish of the day\" special where they offer the freshest fish in town. It was literally swimming in the ocean the day before. We ordered one and it was the sword fish with a sweet and sour Caribbean sauce smothered over. DELICIOUS. We also ordered the eel based sushi, caterpillar roll. YUM.   They are happy hour happy. M-F 3-7p; M-Th 9-11p; F-Sat 10p-12a; Sun -all day. On Tuesdays, they do half price wine bottles. Overall, I've had a fantastic experience at this Kona Grill and will probably become a regular here."}
{"text":"I had an excellent experience here! As soon as I walked in, I was greeted with a smile by the hostess, Morgan I believe. I was sat down, and my server Emily was definitely the best one I've had in years. Always had a smile on her face and even though she was busy, she frequently checked up on me and asked how I was doing which was great! I had the potstickers which were delicious, the churrasco steak was a bit over done for my liking, and the passion fruit creme brûlée; which, was almost as sweet as my waitress. 10/10 would recommend!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at this Kona Grill several times. It's the only Kona I've been to so it may not be reflective of the rest. But I'm really disappointed with it and not going back.   The service has been exceptionally slow recently and the quality of the sushi (while not great to start with) has gone down.   I'd highly recommend skipping this restaurant in lieu of its neighbors - ZTejas or Yard House - if you need to eat while at the mall."}
{"text":"Miles!!!  Go see our buddy Miles!  Well, he wasn't our buddy until we benefited from his awesome service. He was not only super informative about the menu but he was also a lot of fun! We like our dinners out and Miles was the best! Cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the creativity of my sushi rolls, they were delicious. I ordered a Flight of Sake that was really good. My hubby got the burger and spicy endamame, which he really enjoyed. Our server was attentive and accommodating. The only negative was our table was sticky when we were seated and asked for it to be cleaned and bathroom was a little dirty. I would definitely be back."}
{"text":"Their happy hours are great. Service for the most part is good. I gave 4 stars bc sometimes it's slow and sometimes their sushi for happy hour doesn't taste as fresh as it should.  Overall I cant complain too much. I typically walk out stuffed for $10-$12 bucks during happy hour"}
{"text":"I get that this isn't a steakhouse, but if a restaurant is going to charge $32 for a NY Strip, then it should at the least be reputable. Order medium rare, came out medium well.  Found a small piece that they managed to season, but the majority of the steak was pretty bland.  The waitress came out to explain, after placing my order, that the mashed potatoes were gone, so I switched to french fries.  Then she came out to let me know the steamed vegetables were also out, leaving me with some corn dish that they destroyed with what looked like oysters.  I doubt I'll go back."}
{"text":"This is another one of those places that you don't visit for the sushi.  You go to get cheap drinks, at happy hour, and fill up on sushi to fill the void that the alcohol has caused.  The sushi is sub par.  Period.  I hate saying that because I do enjoy going to Kona but it's the truth.  I have had their dinner and had a nice experience.  I had the salmon and it was cooked well, not over cooked or at all dry.  I have also had the macadamia chicken with mashed potatos.  Now, that's delicious.  I've also had their pizza and potstickers and was pretty satisfied.  Not the best but you get your monies worth.  I do enjoy a cosmo and theirs is good.  And cheap.  Cheap is always good, right?  I would recommend this to someone who is looking for happy hour and might have a friend that doesn't want or like sushi."}
{"text":"I love this place...easy access at the mall, great menu, and sushi specials. I've driven all over Maricopa County to find great sushi but in fact this is just plain easier and a great atmosphere. All kinds of Friday happy hour specials and outdoor seating when the weather allows. I know it's a chain, but this one is run like an independent but with high end touches. Only a chain could afford the rent here. Try it if you are in the area...my go to place for healthful eating!"}
{"text":"Kona Grill has been a staple in the Chandler Mall area for years and years now. Years ago it was known as a more hip, trendy, bar type of place you go out to on a Friday night, now it's more of an eatery. They did a total redecoration and re-do on the interior, and the overall style and look is more modern and calm, it isn't the hip, trendy bar/sushi stop it used to be. But, that is not a problem, as the new style and look of the restaurant is clean, simple, and classy.  The food is fine in taste and quality, it's not amazing, it's not bad, it's pretty decent grub. The sushi is pretty decent, and the sashimi is a good cut with a clean taste. I'm impressed with the size of the cuts on the Salmon Sashimi, it was a hearty appetizer compared to sashimi elsewhere. The actual entrees and specialties are better than the sushi and appetizers, they are richer and tastier. I'd go for the Udon Noodles or Pad Thai if I were you, very tasty and flavorful.  The one and only thing that bugs me about this Kona Grill now, is the new approach to its serving staff. Not to sound like a jerk, but years ago the servers were a little more on top of things and a little more appealing. For instance, I was here recently with my woman and we had a quick bite, our server was nice enough, but didn't have much of a personality, you could tell he had no serving experience, and he was chewing gum...chewing gum as a server, in a semi-upscale restaurant?? Seriously? That is not only a health code violation, but it's downright disgusting and inappropriate. What if he dropped that gum on someone's food? This server also forgot to bring out the soy sauce, the food runner had to do it, and he only came by the table one time to check in. He was a weak server, I say that with all due respect, this server was weak and really needed to brush up on his people skills and manners.    That's what I'm talking about, a few years ago at Kona Grill you would walk in and a young girl with a bubbly personality would service your table, she wouldn't chew gum and forget your order and would make you feel like you are in a high service establishment. But, it's not like this anymore. The one in San Tan, the Gilbert Location is what this location used to be. The staff is more hip and faster, and the atmosphere is more fun. This location pretty much calmed down and lost its pizzazz. Nevertheless, the food is still good and the management is friendly and it's a fine place to grab a quick bite."}
{"text":"Yum. Kona is generally spot on with flavors and food consistency, in my experience. Our server was funny and didn't mind splitting our check three ways! I had a poke bowl and was very particular about changes (no rice, no onion, all sauces on the side), and it came out perfectly! We sat at the bar high top so we could take advantage of happy hour specials. The tables and restroom were clean, which is always a plus. The decor is definitely a little dated, but the lighting and ambiance was perfect for ladies' night.  The opportunities to improve: I had a single shot of tequila and it was $14! I should've asked, but if a chain restaurant is charging that much for a shot, I expect some glitter on the rim of my glass. As well, there was a strong odor at the entrance of the restaurant! Lastly, one of our happy hour drinks didn't ring up correctly. Luckily our awesome server wasn't bothered that we mentioned it and happily fixed it- he even seemed surprised himself!"}
{"text":"We came in 30 minutes before they closed.  The waitress discouraged me from ordering.  We did place our order, and the whole time she acted like we were doing her the biggest dis-service ever.  She kept repeating what me, and my wife would say to her in an extremely condescending way.  I finally had to ask her if we had done something to offend her.  We will be going to blue wasabi from now on.  Food was good though."}
{"text":"Although the food & cocktails were on point, I have to leave a less than stellar review on the customer service. Our server not once asked us if we liked our food, wanted another cocktail, or refilled our water...it's AZ and the temperature has started to climb in late April. Maybe she snubbed us because I pointed out the nat that was sitting in my Cosmopolitan...I was nice about it and understood it could happen as the Windows were open on the patio although we were tucked away inside...I just wanted a Cosmo w/o nats....is that too much to ask!!! I usually sit at the bar so maybe that's where the issue lies...the bartenders are well trained, but the servers are not??? However this girl was even training a hostess to be a server! I mentioned my concerns to a manager and he apologized and said he would address the entire staff...$&%! Well I hope that helps, but I think I will be sitting at the bar if I return.  #subtleracism"}
{"text":"I never thought that the sushi here would be great, i loved it! The rainbow, caterpillar, spider, salmon sashimi were my favorite! I ll definitely come back soon!"}
{"text":"I must say first of all that my initial visit here was mind blowing. I don't think I've had a dining experience like this in a loooong time.   I walked in and was greeted by too-cute Chelsea. She's adorable, friendly and engaging. She's definitely a great place to start the dining experience. She even remembered me the second time I went in (and where I sat!).   Then Toni (I hope I spelled that right) greeted me. She's the perfect waiter. She takes your order, gets you what you need without a bunch of talking, but not rude or silent, she checks back with perfect timing and is just on point.   And the food. WOW. It was SO delicious. I had the sweet-chili glazed salmon salad. I asked for the dressing on the side and it came out and was beautiful.   This salad is the salad to end all salads. The salmon was cooked perfectly, the togarashi tofu needs to be a menu item by itself. It was a taste explosion! The salad is substantial and is really something so above and beyond what you think you'll get at a chain (and you'll forget it's a chain soon enough - this food is more than on point!). It's divine.  The second time was almost a crushing disappointment because of my previous experience (although it wasn't that bad, I was just so hoping for the same one).   The waiter was okay. He wasn't friendly, he didn't come back and ask how my salad was (I got it again!). He filled my drink up okay. His service just felt rushed, sort of, even though the restaurant wasn't busy.  I got my salad with the dressing on this time. NOTE: DO NOT EVER DO THIS. It was DRENCHED. I almost gagged with all the salad dressing on it. I won't make that mistake again. The salmon again was cooked perfectly, but this time the tofu tasted like cold tofu. Ick.   I also had the edamame, but you can't really mess that up so it was fine.  All in all this restaurant has my heart if only because the people are so incredibly awesome and as long as Toni is there forever (with cheerful Chelsea!) I'll totally be back."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to Kona for about two years now due to bad service and always being over crowded....thought I'd give it another try since the remodel and more space. The place looks amazing. Two stories with all brand new furniture and lighting. I love the happy hour food here but sadly service is still as horrible as I remember from few years back.  Our server checked on us twice and didn't really seem to care. We had the sliders with fries, avocado egg rolls, and BBQ chicken pizza. They were all delicious and under $20. If they can hire more/better servers this place would be amazing."}
{"text":"I've been to Kona grill in VA but I really liked this location. The interior was very nice and our waiter was friendly. If its nice out I would recommend sitting outside under the bridge. Also they have reverse happy hour (starting at 9) for those late night eaters like me. I would recommend the wave roll which is on both the happy hour and reverse happy hour menu."}
{"text":"5 Stars for their Happy Hour!  Monday-Friday: 3pm-7pm Saturday: 1pm-5pm Sunday: ALL DAY!  My mom had a $15 off coupon to Kona Grill so we decided to go for my first time.  (She is from Michigan and they have one near her home.)    We got there at 6pm.  Easily downed 3 martinis and some apps.   I've never had sushi (GASP!) so this popped by sushi-cherry.  Yum!  We had a crab surprise, California roll, chicken & shrimp lettuce wraps.  Our waiter, Geoffrey, was fantastic.  He made a Last Call for happy hour drinks.  I have never had that at a bar.  How nice!  We enjoyed it so much, we came back a couple days later for happy hour.  We sat at the bar and had crab surprise and pot stickers.  SO GOOD!  We enjoyed the people and the ambiance.  But I think if they didn't have happy hour, this place would be dead.  The restrooms are located back in the restaurant and there was like no one there both nights we went (Wednesday before Thanksgiving and Friday after Thanksgiving).  This will be my new happy hour place!"}
{"text":"Slow Slow Slow service. Geez train your servers and have them step it up with the service. I will go spend my money elsewhere. Blue Wasabi here I come!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time last Sunday and I thought it was a decent place. We sat outside, in the sun, way too hot. We eventually moved to a table in the shade once it was available. I didn't care for the avocado egg rolls.  I don't usually like avocado anyway. We ordered the egg rolls, pizza, and calamari, had like three margaritas each. (I went with a friend)  Once we split the bill, it came to about 20 bucks each. It was very inexpensive (during happy hour), great service, drinks were strong, and it was over all a good first experience. Would definitely come back here for Sunday fun day."}
{"text":"Ok I came to town for a business trip and ended up here tonight which is Wednesday. It's wine down Wednesday which means half off wine all night not just happy hour. Our server Craig made sure my food was perfect and had such great wine suggestions. I can't wait to come back to Chandler and see Craig and have wine and sushi!"}
{"text":"Food is ok. Pad Thai is sub-par. The happy hour is very cool baby suburban around this joint.  It's attached to Chandler Fashion Center, so it's busy pretty much all of the time. happy hour specials are just ok, specialty drinks are pretty expensive with little taste and even less alcohol. plus, i loathe happy hours that you can only enjoy in the \"bar\" area. the patio is the spot for HH, and it's LOUD. not just with vapid chatter, but with the constant scraping of meatl chairs on the concrete. it sounds like i'm being picky, but it's one of those sounds that makes your skin crawl and just kills your mood instantly - over and over and over. anyway, if you're a big time up-and-comer and want everyone to know, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Good food, good service, good location! The only bad things was not having the New England Clam Chowder when we specifically went to Kona for that reason. Hopefully they bring it back to the menu!"}
{"text":"Poke was decent as was my cocktail.  Service was good too.  Be forewarned that the bar area is REALLY loud."}
{"text":"Wow! What a terrific restaurant! The ambiance, which is sleek, sexy and relaxing, suits us well. The mood lighting compliments the dark wood paneling and table tops perfectly. It helps create a warm and cozy vibe.  The menu is diverse and food is delicious! The staff and service is superb. The prices are decent but some dishes are on the high side."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for many years. I remember when happy hour was A good value and gave you A good portion of food. Those days days are sadly over. I guess everything changes,  at least I can say remember when.... oh well. I won't be back. At least you can find A seat now during the rush of happy hour. I remember when you couldn't. ;("}
{"text":"I came here because I've heard good things about the reverse happy hour, although it was for the Gilbert location but since we were closer to this location we made the mistake of coming here. I asked to sit close to the fish tank so my daughter could enjoy the view and was told if we wanted to partake in reverse HH we would have to sit elsewhere. We were told we could sit on the other side at the only open table in view (still dirty) and proceeded to seat ourselves. After several minutes of waiting my daughter politely asked for our table to be cleaned. Our server finally appeared, our drinks and food came out at a snail's pace. The chicken satay over a slaw was good, peanut sauce good(have had better) whatever the other sauce was, awful. The apple brie and pepperoni flatbread were ok but quickly became cold because the air conditioner was on so high you'd think it was summer outside. Average food with poor service, the only reason for 2 stars as opposed to 1 was the nicest gentleman whose job only appeared to be to bus tables was polite to my daughter & myself, was personable and was the only one who genuinely seemed happy to be there. He deserves a mention, the tips and a raise. We might try hh again at Kona but definitely not at this location!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give half stars, I would bump it up to 3.5.  The food is great! The salmon salad is one of my favorite dishes to eat anywhere!! If you like calamari, that's amazing too! I gave 3 stars because the service is terrible. Expect waiting on your server instead of them waiting on you.  I seem to have a little bit of better luck when I sit inside. But patio service, forget it.  They just remodeled and the place looks beautiful! So...in short...food and ambience 5 stars, service I'd give a 2... thus resulting in a 3.5 star review."}
{"text":"Love the happy hour at this place, ran from 3-7pm (they have a reverse one that starts at 10pm) and I took full advantage. They have a $6 appetizer section and Several sushi rolls and small bites are half off, drinks are delicious but I always get the sake bomb (a mini carafe of sake and a 22oz beer)."}
{"text":"Amazing service and food. I got the oriental salad and a strawberry lemonade cocktail. It was exceptional. The music was good and the place is young and chic.  Amazing patio with misters to keep you cool. Friendly and interactive staff. Would love to come back!"}
{"text":"I have never had consistently poor service.  This is my third time at this location.  The staff had always been rude, slow, and inattentive.    On a positive note, the food has always been good."}
{"text":"Happy hour is the beesknees. You can also take a quick survey and get one free full prize appetizer (not to be used during happy hour!)  California rolls were fresh and crunchy crab rolls were delicious new favorite thanks to our waitress for suggesting it!! You the Real MVP honey!"}
{"text":"Came in last night for Sushi and appetizers.  Ordered 3 rolls: spicy tuna, wave roll, and California and a handful of appetizers.  The service was very good and attentive, unfortunately the food was mediocre.  Prices appear to be inline and not extravagant, but improvement needs to be done in the kitchen."}
{"text":"Absolutely the pits good luck getting the waitstaff to give you the time of day this was our 2nd rotten experience we walked out today never to return"}
{"text":"we ate here two times within a few days and both times it was really good, the Pork BBQ sliders are very good, the sushi is just okay in my mind, but the turkey buger is the best turkey burger ever, it is better than my homemade one and that is saying a lot cause mine rocks. The side fries are good also. They get 5 stars for service, and 5 stars for the turkey burger the ambiance is great too they have heaters out on the patio so you can enjoy the night outside and be warm. Good wine selection also."}
{"text":"One of my favorites- heck i can eat here everyday Things I order all the time  rock coconut mojito(not on happy hour menu),bbq chicken pizza, chicken satay,avocado egg rolls, red velvet cupcake, fish tacos, and the salads( all can be shared with others) .   Yummy- I'm thinking about going today"}
{"text":"It's not a mall trip without going to Kona's happy hour! I always feel like my shopping is a success after happy hour here.  Today the service was great, waitress was really attentive & nice, I did not catch her name :/   Food was good, had sushi rolls and a couple appetizers. Chicken satay & avocado rolls are a must try!  I personally think the dining room is way too bright & might be scaring off customers. But I always sit outside staring at the valet area lol. Margaritas are much better next door but you can't win them all!"}
{"text":"Average sushi place for above average prices. I suppose it's worth going to during reverse happy hour. Eh."}
{"text":"We came here on a Sunday and they had happy hour! I love their happy hour menu, so many choices. We had calamari ( my favorite on their HH menu), Bbq chicken pizza, crab crunch roll, ahi wonton crisp and lettuce wraps.   I usually love going to Kona but this one was ok, the flavors were a little bland -- maybe it just depends on the cook.   Love the view from the patio area though, being on High Street makes me feel like I'm not in Arizona. I'd still go to Kona for happy hour but probably at a different one."}
{"text":"My Review For/Of Kona Grill From What I Heard From My Mom/Momma/Mommy/Mother (Caralee Snow Kecman), That This Restaurant Is Absolutely Amazingly Awesome Sauce Wonderful, The Place Is All Clean/Nice, The Service Is Top Notch, The Stuff On The Menu Is Very Interesting  & (And) The Happy Hour Service Is For Everyone To Enjoy."}
{"text":"One of the best (and most popular) happy hours in Las Vegas. Great Summerlin location, good food and reasonable prices. There are great appetizer specials if you're looking to share plates with a couple of people."}
{"text":"The food was excellent.  My wifes beer had a dozen pieces of glass in it.  The waiter sincerely apologized.  We were given $30 in gift cards for a $ 100 meal, that could have ended in a hospital stay. Would you go back?"}
{"text":"Kona Grill is good but a little overpriced. The exception to this rule is if you can get a table during happy hour. That's a big \"IF\" as there never seems to be enough seating and happy hour does not apply to the main restaurant area. However, if you can score a seat, the HH menu is great and we consistently munch on the veggie rolls and avocado egg rolls. I would give them a higher rating we were able to enjoy their happy hour more often."}
{"text":"I have never eaten a regular meal here. I usually go for the reverse happy hour from 10-12pm. Cheap drinks, good food and a good atmosphere. The servers here are good. I don't eat sushi myself, but everyone I go with loves the Crunchy Crab Rolls.   They have three different pizzas, pepperoni, BBQ chicken and cheese. I have had the pepperoni and BBQ chicken. Both were extremely good. I definitely recommend that someone looking for a good time, cheap drinks, and good food."}
{"text":"Great patio!  Music is good.  People are socializing and it's not too crowded.  Our server - Christina met us just after we were seated.  Took our drink orders and brought water. We ordered the shrimp tempura roll.  Beverages were sea-breeze and Long Island iced tea.  Fully loaded and very good. Shrimp tempura tasted great and made to order. We will be back! Christina is cute, warm and friendly."}
{"text":"The boyfriend and I were heading to Fashion Show Mall to do some shopping so we decided to kill two birds with one stone and have lunch there as well. We stumbled upon Kona Grill on Yelp and decided to give it a try. Honestly, I was a little hesitant due to the small amount of reviews, but the pictures looked promising.   The restaurant was surprisingly bigger than I had imagined and it was pretty empty (not sure if I should take that as a positive or negative). I ordered the oriental salad and the boyfriend ordered the Picasso roll and the yellowtail jalapeño appetizer. I usually know when I ordered a good salad when the boyfriend ends up eating more of it than I do. Based on our empty plates at the end of the meal, he obviously enjoyed everything he ordered as well."}
{"text":"I love going to this restaurant. Ricky the head Sushi Guy is amazing! the best sushi I've ever had. so friendly and everyone's always asking how things are. love how much management and supervisors are there making sure everyone's having a great time.. Drinks are a little pricy but still good."}
{"text":"Horrible service and food was not prepared properly.  There were 4 of us out for dinner on a Saturday night.  We were seated right away which was nice.  It was busy, like all Saturdays nights are. Our order was taken fairly quickly, but that's where the decent experience stopped.  It took us an hour to get our food, and when we did, one of our party's meals was missing.  It took 20 minutes for our server to appear to ask us how our meal was.  When we asked him where the one entree was he informed us that he would check on it.   Another of our orders had their steak over cooked (he requested it be cooked medium well but it was bone dry and clearly more \"well done\" than even \"well done\" should have been.  10 minutes later our server returns with our lost order claiming he had them make a \"fresh one.\"  Was completely absurd given that the avocado rolls were luke warm at best (plate was hot though).  10 minutes later the server returns with the properly cooked steak (yay!).  But imagine our surprise when our server leaves BOTH the forgotten entree AND the over cooked steak on our bill.  By this time, we were in a rush and had to leave instead of argue with some shift manager about a $20 entree.  In the meantime, we overheard our server crediting the table behind us with their entree.  Customer service and common sense seem to be a pretty difficult thing to teach. It's pretty simple...there are a lot of choices when we want a meal, and this place won't enter our minds ever again. 1 Star for a pretty cool atmosphere."}
{"text":"I highly recommend their happy hour! We got 4 rolls and pot stickers and only paid 15 per person. Not the most amazing cuts of fish but still fresh and a fun atmosphere to grab some sapporo with friends."}
{"text":"Great indoor/outdoor space... and some very fun drinks.  Would have given 5 stars if service was faster- but it wasn't too big of a deal.   The patio made us feel like we had gone on a vacation- I love that feeling!"}
{"text":"Really disgusting, and plain. My fries were covered in pickle juice. The pickle I had was so warm and It tasted like a cucumber/pickle together. My burger barely had anything on it, it tasted like charcoal, that's it. I actually had too add some stuff too eat a little bit of it. Even my husbands salmon and green beans weren't seasoned. Will not do this place again."}
{"text":"Kona has been renovated and looks better than before!  I mainly come here for the happy hour between 10 pm and 12 am. You can't go wrong with the jalapeño yellowtail sashimi or any of the discounted sushi rolls. My favorite drink off the happy hour menu is the Moscow mule. Those suckers are so refreshing, lol.  Nick was an awesome server as we seated ourselves in the downstairs bar area. The upstairs is also a nice place to sit and eat and drink if you want to experience the second level.   Is it my favorite place to eat? No. But it's great for HH every now and then."}
{"text":"I love Kona's happy hour! They have great deals on rolls and the drinks are very affordable. I appreciate that they have many options for vegetarians, including avocado egg rolls which I could eat all day if allowed to do so. The wait staff is efficient and friendly. I probably would recommend a local sushi joint if you're going for a regular/later meal. Your money will go further at a smaller restaurant."}
{"text":"This girl loves Kona's happy hour! They have great deals on rolls and the drinks are very affordable. I appreciate that they have many options for vegetarians, including avocado egg rolls which I could eat all day if allowed to do so. The wait staff is efficient and friendly. This particular location is at the food court end of the mall and is a short stroll from the movie theater and mall shops close by.    I probably would recommend a local sushi joint if you're going for a regular/later meal. Your money will go further at a smaller restaurant. However, few happy hours will ever be able to match my love for an atlantic roll and sake bomber after a long day at the office."}
{"text":"Yum but.... sides on the filet mignon were not worthy to be called sides the only reason there's not 5 stars waitress was super nice recommended sparkling sangria super good will come back next time I want to spend a pretty penny I'll make sure the sides are better prepared asparagus was not flavored look at the mushrooms they're shriveled up but the meat was great so soft n tasty my friend had no complaints on the sweet chili salmon salad n Sushi"}
{"text":"Kona Grill here is average. The Fashion Square location is much better. The sangria came out as clear on top and red on bottom. I had to stir it to get it to the color it should be. Usually it comes with a straw but I used the one in my water glass. The potstickers were good. The pulled pork sliders were also good. Service was meh. It took a while to get menus and our drinks. It also took 15 minutes to get our check. The waitress walked by 4 times and ignored every time I tried to get her attention. She spent 10 minutes talking to the table next to us about her tattoos down her side. Finally I had to loudly ask if she could bring our check and gave her the card right there as I knew she would take forever to grab our payment. The food is a 4/5. Drinks 2/5. Service 1/5. So I give it an overall 3/5. If you want an average meal, this is your place!"}
{"text":"I used to love coming here!!! BUT!!!!  The chicken Satays are now the size of chicken nuggets!! And the \"happy hour prices\" should just mean \"we took $1 off\" not to mention the Slowest service still!!! At least before the food and price made up for it!"}
{"text":"We have been here several times food is great. Service is just ok but tonight our server did not acknowledge our table for 12 minutes. No silverware or water after we requested. One person got her order 10 minutes before the rest of us. We were told it was busy but there was lots of vacant seating. Maybe she's having a bad night and we're on the receiving end"}
{"text":"Our family has been to Kona Grill at Rampart several times and always enjoyed the food, service and atmosphere. This evening our party of six went out expecting the same results. Our waitress tried very hard but the evening was less than successful. For a bill that came to about $50 a head I have to say it was a huge failure. Our drink orders weren't taken for almost 10 mins and then we waited another 20 to get them. We had to ask for water 2x and the first round of drinks were so weak none of us could tell if there were any spirits used to make them. We asked for each to be remade which took another 15mins and while they were stronger not at all worth the $14 price. Food came out almost 45mins after we ordered and three people had they orders come incorrect. In fact we got a burger that was raw and cold inside. Wrong garnish and not enough condiments. Not once did management come by or even inquire. Our waitress did her best to recover but she was clearly over her head. To say we were disappointed is an understatement. Wouldn't be going back."}
{"text":"I came here once when it was slow and got the worst impression of the place. First of all there was one table seated in the entire place even though they had two more hours till close. No one acknowledged us even though the waitress and bartender both saw us and didn't even bother asking if we needed help until we finally just asked if we could sit where ever. The waitress then gave us menus and disappeared for 30 minutes so the bartender ended up serving us instead. I ended up getting the sushi platter which was disappointing and my husband got a bacon burger which was pretty good but not worth the price and pretty basic for how the restaurant looked and was priced. The restaurant it self is very nice and has some cool flashy modern decor but when I received my food and saw the prices for everything I'd definitely say the place is over all more pretentious than anything else. The meal was easily forgettable. Everything was actually, with the exception of the cool fish tank at the entrance but next time I think I'll just look at that from the street and skip the mediocre food and bad service."}
{"text":"The food is good. Some major deals to be had during happy hour. Here's a tip... they happy hour on weekends too, and it's much less crowded than it is the rest of the week.   The patio is in a very undesirable location. View of the parking lot, exhaust fumes, etc, yes - it sucks. But this should demonstrate to you that the happy hour deals are just that good :-)   And the last time i was there they mixed up a the best mojito i've had."}
{"text":"Service was awful, came to check on us once. Once a bigger table came, all his attention went to them. We waited about 20 minutes after we were finished eating to finally get the check.  My wife and I got the sushi, we tried 3 different ones and they all lacked flavor, very plain. My daughter got the Cali roll kids meal and it too wasn't very good. The only thing we enjoyed were my daughters sweet potato fries.  Won't be back and don't recommend."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Bar staff was incredible. Food was amazing. Highly recommend this sushi spot. They have a little bit of everything on the menu as well. And the surrounding area was incredible. Food was affordable for sure and tasted great."}
{"text":"We made a reservation on Opentable but were all ready at Fashion Square so we arrived about 15 minutes early. The hostesses were very accomidating seatng us and even got us a booth we requested.   Pretty sure if you're a man working here you have to look like a model which was fine with me. Our server smiled and was very friendly making sure we were happy through our whole stay.   The Volcano roll was all right, I've had better. The calamari was amazing. The Catepillar Roll was amazing. Pretty much all the things we ate were amazing. Our service was great, and there was eye candy all over!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, menu is a little confused. Sushi on one side, a mishmash of American on the other.   The calamari appetizer was fantastic. Probably the best I have ever tasted with an amazing dipping sauce.   Forgot my roll for 15-20 mins whole everyone else already had their food. They apologized profusely but did not speed up the roll at all. The Bama roll was delicious, so as soon as I got it and sunk my teeth in, I forgot about the annoyance of being served last."}
{"text":"PRETTY GOOD HAPPY HOUR! I came on a Sunday at 2 and it was pretty packed.   I ordered a white wine sangria $6 and it was refreshing and with just the right amount of sweetness. They also have sake bombs with a whole bottle of Kirin and hot sake for $7 that my boyfriend had.   We ordered:   Flatbread pizza: it was good. Lots of cheese and pepperoni!  Calamari: slightly rubbery and tough. But the spicy mayo complimented it well. Spinach and artichoke dip: literally leafs of spinach and chunks of artichoke. I didn't really that at all.  Spicy chicken and shrimp lettuce wraps: my favorite!! The chicken and shrimp were very savory and was perfectly spicy when you add that sauce.   Overall I would come back! My total was only $45 dollars. Can't beat that."}
{"text":"We love their food and their upstairs bar and patio!  The key lime pie is crazy delicious - some of the best I've personally ever tasted.  The sushi rolls are great, the happy hour appetizer list is generous on both food and drink.  We really enjoy the saki sangrias!  Our last visit was a little disappointing with service as we arrived closer to the end of their business day.  As we always do, we made sure to ask if it was okay to sit at the sushi bar since it appeared they were winding down and getting ready to close.  They assured us they were not closing and that we could sit there, however throughout our meal they pretty much closed up show, put all the chairs up around us at the bar and we generally felt rushed.  We won't be returning for meals at the end of their business day again, however earlier in the day visits are definitely worth the trip!"}
{"text":"This place has a pretty decent happy hour. Half price appetizers as well as some pretty cheap drinks. Very cheap sake bombs !   Happy hours gets pretty busy, and is only available in the bar and the patio area. Patio area is great when weather outside is nice - but on hot summer nice, it isn't very ideal. So, if you do go during bad weather, be sure to get there when it starts so you can get seats, as there isn't much seating inside.   Food: Calamari was decent. There was too much batter and not at all oily. Comes with a spicy sauce which was good, but I still prefer the sauce offered at Olive Garden.   BBQ Chicken pizza, I wouldn't get again. Sauce was weird and the chicken was dry. They also cut it very oddly... haha.   Potstickers have good taste but are fried and I prefer mine steamed.   Tuna wonton crisps are good. Tuna always seems fresh. Comes with a wasbai sauce that I'm not too fond of, but still good.   Overall - definitely a place to try for happy hour. Not sure if I would go there otherwise."}
{"text":"We had a great experience at Kona Grill on Sunday! First of all, I had no idea that their Happy Hour lasts ALL DAY on Sunday! What a great idea! Of course, it is super crowded at the patio/bar area (the only places where HH is offered), so be prepared to stake out a table for a little while. Once we were seated, our server, Hunter, was awesome! We had a pretty big group, including a few kids, and he was so patient and friendly with us. The food, although a few items took awhile, was really good. The best thing, however, is that the manager continually came to check on us. He said that he'd never seen us before and wanted to make sure we had a great experience- and we did! He so sweetly comped us an extra pepperoni pizza for the kids as well. Wow!  That was really fantastic, and so appreciated. On a beautiful day, Kona Grill is an ideal place to visit!"}
{"text":"Meh... I could easily find better food, a better happy hour, and better service within blocks of this place. It's not terrible, but I wouldn't recommend it to people either."}
{"text":"Happy hour is awesome here. Had the sliders and some appletinis...a lot of rich flavor and it was so affordable. The happy hour has a wide array of appetizers for even the Americanized palates.The atmosphere was a cross between the OC and old Vegas. So dress accordingly. Cheers!"}
{"text":"First, let me say, our server, Nicole M. was awesome!!!!  I have a really sarcastic sense of humor, and she went with it the whole time, AND with a smile on her face.  She was attentive, patient, friendly, and knew her food items.  My friend and I sat out on the side patio - it was a comfortable night.  We were there for the Happy Hour, and ordered frozen margaritas, and 3 apps.  Fried calamari, a tomato and mozzarella flatbread, and, at Nicole's suggestion, the Bama roll. Their HH prices are fantastic - half off:-)  We were not disappointed - everything was delicious.  Initially, I did not want to go, because I thought this location brought in the \"pretty\" people.  Actually, it was a nice mix of  families, co-workers, and people who live in the area.  If we go back, we are going to ask for Nicole's area because she was just fantastic.  I never tip past 25% but we gave her 35% tip.  Hope Kona is good the second time around."}
{"text":"Only good for happy hour. Eight dollars a glass of cheap wine is over priced."}
{"text":"Bad, just bad! Slow service, calamari was frozen, my girlfriend had the chicken bruschetta an the chicken was so rubbery she couldn't eat it, an came with ore Ida sweet potato fries fresh from the walk in freezer. I had the pork tenderloin an it's covered in cheap ass onion strings, it came with mashed potatoes covered in wilted bok choy lettuce that was made two days prior to me ordering it, pork was undercooked an drowning in some sorta gravy. I can't believe a line cook could send food out like this. We wanted to send it back but our waitress didn't check on us till 20mins after we got our food, an we had a movie to catch. Meal ended up costing $50 an we always tip 20% so $60 bucks for a below average meal. The 2 stars is for location an the look of the place. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Love this place!!!     Chicken satay appetizer, Pan-Asian noodles and the kids mac and cheese was GREAT!  Atmosphere was good on a Tuesday night.  The dessert portions are huge. Hibiscus iced tea was awesome also.  Will definitely come back just for the Coconut shrimp roll."}
{"text":"It pisses me off how all my friends seem to bring people from out of state to Kona for happy hour.  Why??? It's another large, sub-par chain joint with prices that are comparable to normal, non-HH alcohol prices anywhere that's more than 50 feet from a Louis V store.  I'm just not a fan of patios that extend into a parking garage when you're in Scottsdale and every respectable business has a much better patio.  If you've shopped till you can't walk any further, then yes - Kona is your promised land, but to everyone else - PLEASE stop showing Midwesterners this place like it's some sort of symbol of the Southwest and take them to a  place with character!"}
{"text":"A 2 star for value, flavor quality and price. We noted to the waitress there are fruit flies buzzing around our table and she brushed it off. She didn't mention it to the manager or address the concern."}
{"text":"Located just north of the 101 off 56th, High Street offers a nice little mix of eateries.    Kona Grill offers a very comfortable and casual setting that accommodates a large group or intimate seating.  Parking can be found on the street in front, or parking garages nearby when busy.   The food is a mix of traditional,  somewhat Polynesian, and sushi.    A friend and I came in for lunch on Saturday, was greeted and seated quickly, with drinks on the way.    I ordered the Mac Chicken which was perfectly cooked and tasted fantastic with the mashed potatoes (the accompanying Brussels sprouts however were grilled and undercooked) The portion was pretty good sized and a great value.  My busy had two different sushi rolls (one free via the Yelp check-in offer) and was very happy with the both the portion size and quality.    I checked reviews before going and was very happy to see that Peter (manager) responds personally to both positive and negative reviews...no \"form response\".    Service was great, food was great, atmosphere was great, value was good, WHAT ELSE DO YUU WANT?  I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We had a variety of sushi today and all of it was fresh and delicious. Our server was friendly and helpful with recommendations. I forgot how good the sushi here is, will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Favorite lunch place. Sushi is great as well. Of all the places at City North it is a solid spot to meet friends.  There is a secret lunch menu pinned to the inside wall of the hostess desk. It is there $10 to-go only lunch menu and unpublished anywhere else. Delicious sandwiches and salads are on it."}
{"text":"Never been here before and my friend and I came for happy hour. So we went to the front and sat down inside, our food was good but the check was $60 for two of us. Later on we found out that happy hour was only on the patio and NO ONE told us about that. So we over paid for a meal we could have easily got more food for less if we would have been aware."}
{"text":"Came here to get some happy hour, hostess sat us down. Took 10 minutes for a server to ask us if we wanted something to drink. I asked her for the happy hour menu and was told that happy hour was only on the lounge area. Took her another 5 minutes to figure out where to move us when half the lounge tables were empty. She sat us down, and never came back. Anyways.... we left and went to Roka Akor."}
{"text":"I'm a frequent flyer at Kona grill in Scottsdale. The happy hour is excellent- and all day on Sunday. There is indoor and outdoor seating available, which is great for people watching at fashion sq mall. The food is pretty good and well priced. I ordered the Atlantic roll, salmon roll, sliders, and BBQ chicken flat bread. Plenty of food for 3!"}
{"text":"One of the best happy hours in the area. Great service, good inexpensive drinks, and very reasonable and tasty appetizers during happy hour."}
{"text":"Our waiter was wonderful  (sorry I didn't get his name). The food was delicious,  I had the macadamia chicken and my husband had the Hawaiian ribeye.  The kids meals were wonderful as well,  and presented in a beautiful little box (and only $6!).  My coconut mojito was yummy.  Our first time at this restaurant, but it will not be our last."}
{"text":"This spot has great outside seating and has tasty drinks. My sweetheart and I enjoy the busy yet relaxed atmosphere and the food is good.    The service is friendly and definitely an addition to the atmosphere. Great for a fun date and great to hang out with friends"}
{"text":"This place was ok. They have a nice patio/bar area and I thought it was a decent size, but man does this place get crowded. Now, I grew up in Gilbert so I know there are only a handful of places to go and have drinks so they get packed on the weekends. We waited about 20 minutes, maybe more, before we got a table. We would have left if we hadn't decided that we just wanted to stick close to home that night.   They had some drink specials for $3-$4, sake bombers are $6.50 during HH. They also had a few rolls and appetizers and pizzas to choose from that were half off. The food was ok. Nothing great or memorable.   You have to get here early. We also got here at about 4:30 on a Friday and that was too late. Lots of families with kids dining in the bar area."}
{"text":"I've been here 2 times since they opened and got great service. The 2nd time I was alone and sat at the bar and the bartender was great at making sure everyone got service."}
{"text":"Tuesday 5pm, sat outside. We got calamari, tuna, filet, chicken pad tai, kids pizza and a dragon roll. Fast service, food was yummy and the patio was very comfy. We arrived at happy hour by accident so it was nice to get a little price break on some items."}
{"text":"Girlfriend and I ate there for lunch today, nice waitress and she wasnt the \"annoying\" but promptly filled my drink as it neared the bottom. The atmospere was nice and the wait wasnt long for the food. The only real complaints is that the sushi plate was kinda small and it just tasted OK. Honestly u can prob get the same quality and taste at your nearest bashes or frys grocery store."}
{"text":"I really like their happy hour specials here. It is really reasonably priced and delicious. The only thing that sucks is having to look for a table yourself in the bar area. The bar area is the only area you can get the happy hour specials. Get ready to throw elbows for a seat."}
{"text":"Really really really strong Margaritas!   The happy hour menu makes everything really cheap, and the food at night is great. I got the calamari...and it comes with this wonderful wasabi-cream sauce...YUM!  The only issue I would say, is that it stops serving at 11pm. With that great of a bar, it should stay open a little later."}
{"text":"I have two complaints that prevented me from giving this Kona Grilla 4-star rating, both relating to their Chicken Chili \"soup\". There are only 4 soups on their menu, and this is the first one listed, so I was expecting a bowl of soup, not a traditional bowl of chili. Second is that their chili contained beans - a lot of beans. Beans are used in chili as a stretcher - quality restaurants never put beans in their chili. And since beans kind of stick inside your mouth, the chili left a terrible aftertaste that was difficult to get rid of. Other than having beans, the chili had very good flavor.  On the positive side, my main dish was the Caribbean chicken which was delicious, and a large portion size. I've never a jerk chicken meal that was memorable until this one. It was quite spicy, as it should be.   The staff was also very good - no complaints there."}
{"text":"The remodel is sooooo amazing, they kept some of my favorite dishes but mastered them in flavor and presentation. You must go see the gorgeous inside & second floor they added"}
{"text":"Loved it. Use the patio upstairs. There is a perfect amount of shade and misters. Also there is a separate bathroom and Bar up there as well. We had the calamari and lettuce wraps, they were phenomenal! Had a Moscow Mule and hubby had a sam Adam's October fest.  Everything was timed right and service was great. Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"I love coming here for happy hour either just after work, or right before they close. I end up getting i nice buzz from the sake bombs and a full belly from all the great rolls and apps. The best part is that after splitting the total tab with my group i usually end up spending less than 20 bucks for my part. There is always a great crowd and great people watching if your on the patio,."}
{"text":"Lane is bae!! Super attentive and sweet, speedy servics, incredible customer experience, and absolutely divine food. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Sadly, this place has gone downhill. Used to be a favorite for sushi and drinks. Now it's a sad place to be. Bartender was not friendly at all. There was lint/dust on and in my wine glass so I politely asked for a new glass. She didn't acknowledge my request but stormed away quietly to get a new glass. Upon handling a new glass she clearly noticed the new glass was dirty so I saw her clean the glass. Which I appreciated!  When she placed my new glass down she never said anything. I guess I was hoping for a \"I'm so sorry about that.\"  Then when we ordered our sushi she still never even said one word. I really wasn't trying to be a pain by asking for a new glass. I just prefer to not hAve dust on my glass. I truly feel bartenders and servers should have great personalities. To top it off, she spilled the soy sauce and it got on my husbands shorts and in my purse. Never said 1 word about it. The service here is going to run this place to the ground. We won't be back. Not worth having us feel bad about ourselves."}
{"text":"Love it!!! Layne thank you for you for recommendations!!!! You were pleasant, upbeat, and fun! We got the repeat necessities and you guided us into amazeaballs additions!!!"}
{"text":"An ok place for a Sunday afternoon. Kona Grill has all day happy hour on Sunday!! (yay!) Too bad I was't in the mood to drink and the roll I like wasn't on the happy hour menu. But all was well. Not many people seated in the bar area. There were three bartenders, and they all managed to be \"busy\". Brent was my server. Thank heavens I didn't need him for anything because he was scarce. The sushi roll came to the bar before my silverware. hmmm. I chose the spicy salmon roll. I enjoyed it!  However, I wouldn't call it  \"spicy\"!  The wasabi that I put on it gave it a nice kick though! ;-)  I had to flag down Brent to request my check. He obliged, but never came back to pickup my card. I had to ask another bartender to cash me out. I've been here before and received better service."}
{"text":"Really cool location at the Scottsdale quarter. Rly feeling the vibe at this location- cool lighting, TVs. Food is always decent. I think the happy hour prices went up, again? A chill place with indoor/outdoor seating. I'll be back again soon."}
{"text":"Def. recommend only going here during happy hour. GREAT happy hour pricing. Unless you have a lot of extra cash you can burn (lucky you)! :)  I am inbetween a 3-4 Stars for Kona Grill in general. Every experience I've had at Kona is different, some better than others. For this specific Kona Grill at the Chandler Mall, 4 stars.   When we all went, the bar area which was packed and extremelyyy loud. Usually I love to sit at the bar but we all didnt want to have a yelling conversation the entire night so we moved into the restaurant area, much quieter but still busy.   Service - our server was awesome. She was super friendly, attentive, very helpful, and extremely honest about what to order, -  what's best, and what to order to get your money's worth.   Food - Great food! I was happy with most everything we ordered (sushi rolls).  The Firey Shrimp Tempura roll was almost tastless and wasnt spicy, but other than that - awesome! :)  P.S. Sign up for their email club -you will get a coupon for a free appetizer OR sushi roll (up to $10) - great deal! Sign up a couple days before you plan to go, it takes a while to get to your inbox. :)"}
{"text":"The Sushi and some of the food is pretty good. Atmosphere is nice too. Every time I eat there the service is terrible they never have any steps of service. They are always playing catch up at our table. With plates, chopsticks, napkins. I can go on and on. They need to get better management and need to retrain there staff. Please make some changes.   Thank you Kona for your response. We love the food and go often so we will definitely give it another try"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch yesterday and within two hours was in horrible pain. I have been bed ridden for 24 hours now due to feeling like throwing up and some other not so pleasant events. I have definitely been chosen as the lucky one for food poisoning. Don't get the lemon garlic shrimp penne."}
{"text":"Great happy hour and definitely my go-to spot for appetizers and margaritas.  A friend recommended this place for happy hour food, but I came with low expectations, as I do with every place in Phoenix. I was pleasantly surprised how good everything was for a chain restaurant.  I ordered the California Roll ($3 happy hour!) and it was delicious. 5 or 6 rolls with plenty of wasabi and ginger. I also got the Chicken Satay ($4.50 happy hour) and the quality was very good.  4 pieces of tender breast meat, juicy - cooked to perfection. Great peanut sauce as well.  Ordered 2 house margaritas ($3 each) and although they were small, they were very tasty and only $3.00. I haven't ordered a margarita in a while because of the cooler weather and most places use a crappy sour mix - not here - they are very good. I will be back."}
{"text":"This place was pretty good I had sushi husband had pad thai. You get a free appetizer or sushi roll with the check-in which was really cool. Our server was awesome the atmosphere is cool and overall it was a pretty good meal."}
{"text":"We were starving and needed lunch and this was a well rated place right on the strip which meant we didn't have to enter a casino and wander around to find a place. The Kona Grill has a very upscale feeling and high class service. I had a delicious chicken and broccoli stir fry and a great moscow mule. Lots of other menu items looked good too. This is definitely a great option if you want a nice classy restaurant accessible on the strip."}
{"text":"Eight of us went for a birthday happy hour get together. We snagged two tables in the bar area to put together. Great happy hour prices and we had such an awesome server! She was on point for sure. Happy hour selection is decent. The only problem is due to the patio seating (there are misters outside on the patio), the bar area tends to get super muggy and hot. We were all sweaty (gross!) Summer time patios in LV, fail...? Regardless, great place to go with a group for happy hour!"}
{"text":"I visited kona with my brothers and I don't know where to start...the service was amazing not only was the server friendly but the manager came over introduced herself I believe Erika was her name(few drinks makes you forget) just the vibe from the kitchen to the servers was beyond expectations... will definitely be going back for the pot stickers and definitely for the kona churrasco with that chimichurri sauce looked real good"}
{"text":"Wife and I stubbed across this place while stretching our legs in Chandler Village in Chandler, AZ.  Very friendly hostess, nice atmosphere with the large wall fish tank and cascading water on another wall.  I ordered the salmon tuna Naruto which is a sushi roll no rice with cucumber as a replacement amazing.  My wife ordered the shrimp pad Thai noodles, reminded her of make in Taiwan.  They also do 20% military discount, a must try"}
{"text":"The place is very pretty inside and outside, the server was fine. The food, not that much.  I  ordered fried kuna calamari which was gross, extremely greasy with no flavor. And the bama roll was ok  in flavor  although a lot of rice and cheap ingredients."}
{"text":"Best happy hour,sushi,lettuce wraps.customer service was great as it was very busy.i will be back."}
{"text":"I use to come to kona grill a lot until I moved to the other side of town and now that I moved back to summerlin I was excited to find out they renovated it and made another patio upstairs. I invited my friends to join my husband and I for happy hour on Sunday when we arrived it was packed as usual. We couldn't find a seat in the air conditioned part of the bar so we went upstairs come to find out it's not air conditioned up there at all!!!!!! It was way too hot to even get to enjoy our food we came downstairs and had to sit outside I felt horrible that my friends mom was wiping off her dripping sweat the entire time! If your going to renovate PLEASE do it right it is HOT AS SHIT in Vegas in the summer how do you expect people to sit outside? Yes you have misters but they are way up high and they don't make a difference !!!!! Spend some money and get some outdoor air conditioning PLEASE!"}
{"text":"This is my 3rd time dining here. This review is based solely on today's experience. When we first got seated someone came to take our drinks orders for our server. We waited a few mins no biggie and the server came to take our order because she noticed we were finish looking through the menu. We placed our order and food came promptly. The calamari batter tasted stale. Like it was pre made and they just heated it up. We also got the spinach dip and the chips also tasted stale. The sushi rolls were good. We ordered the dragon, rainbow and philly. I didn't really like the philly because it was smoked salmon my bad I should've read that. After the food was delivered the waitress checked on us and my husband wanted another beer. She was preoccupied chit chatting with her coworkers at the micros computer next to the bar she forgot the beer she seemed as tho she was in a daze. We finished eating waited another 10 minutes or so by that time there was no point in even getting another beer so my husband asked for the check. She walked right past us to go clean up a table mind you it wasn't even busy. She disappeared for another 10 mins before finally delivering the check. I really didn't want to tip her but we still managed  to give her 12% tip. We are normally 20% tippers but this was just a bad experience for us this time. The other two times we dined here it was completely dead and we had better service. I like this location better than summerlin because it has more air conditioned tables. I just hope the servers get it together here."}
{"text":"Came to have dinner with my daughter here.  The place is nice but a bit too warm for my taste.  The service is great and the food is pretty good.  Their menu has quite a variety. You can chose from Japanese, American or Thai (I'm sure this satisfies People in a large group).   Either I'm old, don't get out enough or this is an Arizona thing because I haven't noticed this back home.  They have happy hour from 5-7 and then again from 9-11.    I tried the chicken pad Thai.  Everything was good just a bit too soupy, actually way too soupy.  My daughter had the sushi she loved the Las Vegas roll.  She's a student at ASU and said she would frequent this place."}
{"text":"When I lived in Florida I used to visit the Local Kona Grill all the time. This one here in Las Vegas had a very similar five but a completely different layout which made it twice is fun. Downstairs there is a huge restaurant area along with the bar and outdoor seating. Which included TVs and live music for the patrons to be entertained.  However, my favorite area is the second floor which has televisions as well but the setting is more intimate and you get to look out over some scenery. Plus the bar is right next to you, so your server is always able to top you off. Speaking of servers,  Our server was wonderful, competent, and attentive.  there was some 90s rock music playing over the PA system which added to the nice vibe. It is a different repeat location and I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing the food is great and the service is great. I enjoyed all the sushi rolls on the menu and the appetizers are great. I would defiantly come back another round here !"}
{"text":"I almost saw my first bar brawl ever last night. Ever.   It was really exciting watching an almost altercation.   I was sitting with eight of my workmates eating dinner. (I had an overly dressed salmon salad. The salmon was tasty, but there was too, too much dressing on the greens and the tofu was so plain and white. Ick. It should be against the law to serve tofu plain and white. It perpetuates tofu's bad reputation.)  I was chatting with my boss and a colleague about megapixels and such when there was some shouting at the bar and a patron was being steered out of the restaurant by a fancy-looking man that I identified as the manager. More shouting and we were like, \"Oh! What's going to happen now? Where's mall security?\" Then the patron came back! He grabbed the wrist of the girl that he came with and pulled her out the door. How embarrassing. I would have been like, \"Get off of me you bleep bleep.\" But she just walked out with him. I hope that she's okay.   Then there was more shouting out in the hallway of the mall and we were all waiting for mall security to bust through the doors and lay down some mall law.   But nothing happened. We went back to eating over done pad thai and over dressed salad.   A moment passed and then the manager came over to our table and apologized for the ruckus. Wasn't that nice of him? He had done his best to get boozer out of the restaurant and then he apologized for boozer.   Four stars for the classy manager.   The food is bleh."}
{"text":"Luckily I wasn't paying here. I got Sushi/sashimi, miso soup, and a seared ahi salad, all of which were well gross. Atmosphere was so dark, i thought the damn boogeyman was gonna get me."}
{"text":"Made reservations while in Las Vegas this past weekend, and so glad that we did! The restaurant wasn't that busy and the food was better than what we had expected. Our server was very attentive and friendly, really makes a difference when dining out! Strawberry lemonade basil was sooooo good!! If you decide to get a roll, definitely get the spider roll and pass on the potstickers. We will definitely be coming here in the near future!"}
{"text":"Me and my friend went here the other day to get some drinks at the day time happy hour. We sat on the patio and were a couple minutes early. We got there a couple minutes before happy hour. My friend ordered a drink but I opted to wait the couple minutes for happy hour to start. When I told the server this, I felt some attitude. I brushed it off and orders my drink once happy hour started.   We were there for a couple of hours. The server would only come over to the table when we started to look for her. When she would come over to the table and we would ask for more water she would take over ten minutes to bring it to us. Not to mention the sour look she had on her face the entire time.   I come to Kona often. Most of the time I go it is busy so the service takes longer. The other day when I was there there was a sufficient amount of staff there for all the customers, so I see no excuse for the slow service. I was very disappointed with the service, and felt ignored and unwanted there. I was there to have a good time with a friend I haven't seen for a while and felt like we were constantly worried about how the server would act and the look she has on her face when she came over to the table. I love this place, but at the moment I don't think I will be returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"Unless you're going for happy hour I would definitely advise avoiding this restaurant. The only reason happy hour is even partially acceptable is because of the cheap prices. I've given it several tries and have been disappointed every time. After trying 5-6 different sushi rolls and being disappointed every time I don't believe I'll ever be back. The staff is extremely rude & slow as if they don't care if customers return."}
{"text":"This was a great break from the high-fat, high-calorie 4 day binge I'd been on for the last 4 days. Sat at the bar and ordered just a little too early for their good daily happy hour (3-7pm). Ordered a Miscow Mule and enjoyed it. The sweet & spicy salmon salad was excellent. Big menu. Their sushi rolls are usually good too."}
{"text":"Our table of 9 had dinner  at 7 on Thursday at Kona Grill. I was looking forward to trying the food, as this was my first time eating here and the menu looked good.   The experience started off not great.  The server took half of the tables appetizer order and just walked off. When he delivered their order, he finally  took the other half of the tables appetizer order...so, half the table was eating  and the other half sat waiting for their food to arrive.   When it came to our main course items, he delivered the wrong items to several people, noticed  his error and then proceeded to snatch the plates, walk back to the kitchen and turn around, came back to the table and served the correct dinner to the correct people. ..it was really bizarre.   The food was just ok. The table thought the food was lacking in flavor. My husband had sushi and it tasted \"fishy\" instead of fresh and clean tasting of the sea. To be fair, the server noticed that I didn't eat much of my Phad Thai and offered another selection or a refund as i didn't like it.  For the price you pay for eating at Kona Grill snd the ok food, we will not be eating here again."}
{"text":"Great place, food is good, but kind of touristy and over glamorized.  It comes off to be your Hawaii grill place, but is kind of trendy and upscale that they loose the essence of Kona, HI.  I recommend the place, but be prepared for a sophisticated, pricy meal.  It's not a \"local\" place to hangout.  Reminds me of a \"hard rock café\" type of environment.  Again, good place, though.  Just pricy."}
{"text":"I like the atmosphere especially on the patio. It has semi-good rolls and staff is always friendly. The best part about this place is the good pours on the drinks. If you are unsure about what to order the staff is always able to recommend their favorite rolls or entree! Priced average for two!"}
{"text":"To start we had the fried calamari. Not too impressed with that. I had the BBQ chicken flat bread it was a little dry. Overall the food wasn't too bad for a grill but for the price of the food I was definitely not impressed what so ever. Most likely not coming back"}
{"text":"Came here on a date with my long time boyfriend because he loves sushi this place is always amazing. The food was really good but the waiter won us over. We had already spend 75 dollars (bf loves sushi) and we didn't even care that we had given our waiter a 25 dollar tip. I just wish I got his name"}
{"text":"Atmosphere food service, everything was excellent! Went in expecting to pay a grip of dough but we hit happy hour and walked out paying a moderate amount but ate luke Kings and Queens!"}
{"text":"Not near as good as the Chandler Mall Kona. Bartender almost cloyingly sweet and in your bubble. I don't want to know your opinion of what I've ordered, over and over, while you see other people waiting while he chats and chats ... If he just had the bar that might work, but giving him all the tables around, makes it a fight for service. Oriental salad for the last two trips had close to zero of the crunchy ramen and were overdosed with dressing (limp). When you know customers love the crunch of the ramen, and being that it is so cheap, why hold back? Give us the crunch. We're going to give them six months, go to the Chandler Mall one, and then try them again."}
{"text":"We stopped in for sushi today and had such a great experience! We were seated right at the bar and Rene & Bruno were our chefs. It was fantastic! We're not picky at all and just let them create a few things for us and everything they made was so delicious! We're traveling in Vegas but if we were locals we'd come in all the time!"}
{"text":"Excellent macadamia nut chicken! The rest of the family enjoyed sushi, basil linguini and oriental chicken salad. Very fast service, beautiful presentation!"}
{"text":"This place was a major disappointment. We ordered potstickers, fried calamari, rainbow and spicy tuna roll. The potstickers appeared to be of the frozen food variety and tasted as if they canned chicken in them. The calamari was very dry and the sushi was inedible. It's pretty rare that the food is so bad that we left with half our meal still unbeaten."}
{"text":"Ignore the haters, this place is great. The Jalapeño Yellow Tail appetizer might be the best thing I've ever eaten. It's not cheap, because good food never is."}
{"text":"First of all, service was great. The waiters were really nice and attentive. Also, the free appetizer or sushi roll is an amazing deal (one per table)! However, the food quality is where I had to take stars away. I had the chicken satay and it was super dry. The other food items that my friends got weren't that good either, like the lobster mac and cheese had a lot of lobster but it was \"fishy.\""}
{"text":"Absolutely TERRIBLE service. Our waitress was interminably slow and inattentive. Food was average. Sushi was good. We had to request three times to have our water/drinks refilled. On top of that it took 30 minutes to get out to go order which was only a kale salad. And she forgot to bring the boxes for our leftovers."}
{"text":"I was here a few times before the remodel and enjoyed it. This was my 1st time after the remodel and we sat upstairs. It looks very nice and fancy. I was here during  happy hour so our food was cheap. We ordered the spicy edamame a spicy tuna roll and another roll. I look forward to trying more items in the future. I've driven by many times when the place was packed so there is probably a wait during peak times."}
{"text":"Tonight my friend and I went upstairs for happy hour and just to eat and drink. David was an EXCELLENT bar tender! You can usually catch him down stairs but we are so happy to have him as our tender! If you come on a Sunday you can catch him upstairs.  Either way, ask for David!"}
{"text":"Low quality fish, cold appetizers and with so many options here. Why bother... tuna nigiri tasted very fishy, yes I know it's fish but if you eat sushi, you know what I mean. Manager was great but server... ehhh..."}
{"text":"Loved the Food!  The parking is a bit of a challenge but Valet is an option. My mouth is watering right now just thinking about the different dishes I have tried there. Any of the grilled fish (not on the sea watch list) will fill your desire for something flavorful yet light. It is a chain."}
{"text":"I'm really disappointed. I have been a long-time customer of Kona Grill (since it originally opened in boca), but have major issues with this place since it has been remodeled. For about six times in a row, I have had to actually get out of my seat after waiting 20-30 mins for a menu and water to ask for a waiter/waitress. I have even had to move to other tables to accommodate these waiters. Half of the restaurant is dead and they make excuses for everything. The food quality was not good on my last visit. To say the least, I am majorly upset to have these issues, after spending so much money at this place over the years."}
{"text":"Food was good yet experience destroyed it. Asked to sit on patio. They said no due to having our & year old. Ok no worries.  We sat and asked us for drinks. Ordered ice tea. Out. Ordered coffee she said we don't have any made. At this point I looked at server and said really you can't make a pot of coffee. She said all asked and came back with coffee. We got to restaurant  at 9:15. We had a yelp coupon for free app or roll. After looking and seeing only generic rolls we told server can you tell the sushi chef just to make us something his choice. Upon delivery the expo says Caterpillar roll.  Sure enough when we got our bill the server just hit caterpillar roll. Irritating! We asked for a small white rice when the appetizers were dropped off.  before Our food got there mind u!! and she said no The kitchens close. Mmmmm ok. After eating we asked what there dessert menu was. It was our kids 8th birthday !!  kitchen is close she said! we where not told the kitchen is closing or we would have ordered desert with meal cause it's not like they gave her ice cream or anything. yelp said they close at 11 currently they close at 10.  We still got there 45 minutes before but I guess it was still to much of An inconvenience to server us. And the cherry on top was they charged us 5.00 for each (ordered 4) miso when the menu says 4.50. And took off 14$ only for the 15$ \"free roll\". Nevrr"}
{"text":"I refuse to jump on the Kona train so many people seem eager to ride.  The only thing they have going for them is two large patios which are self seat.  You actually stand around and wait while people are eating, drinking and trying to avoid making eye contact as people vulture around their tables.  The staff is boring, the food is mediocre at best and the place is as disorganized as it comes.  They got lucky with a location and a patio.  Don't waste your time, explore Vegas.  I'm sure there's even something in the same area, Boca Park or Tivoli."}
{"text":"Came here late on a Friday night to get some late night eats. There were about 3 other groups there, clearly not the place to be at on a Friday night. We ordered some sushi rolls to start and when they came out they were falling apart. Even rolls I've made at home were rolled tighter than these. As an entree I ordered the Pad Thai with chicken and hardly ate any it was so salty I couldn't eat it without drinking a gallon of water. My cousin ordered the chicken lettuce wraps and said the same thing- she mostly just ate the lettuce. The only thing that wasn't externally slaty were the sliders that her husband ordered.   I wouldn't really recommend this place to anyone. The only reason I'm giving them two starts instead of one is because our waiter was a sweetheart and made the dining experience a little bit better."}
{"text":"Wow this location is great!! Right on the corner by Sorso, they have a good spot with a large wraparound patio. The dining room and bar area open up to each other and flow smoothly so it doesn't feel like two separate rooms; or even establishments. When you walk in, the blue lit waterfall wall behind the hostess stand is really cool and mesmerizing. There is a row of big rectangle booths in the middle of the restaurant which is where we sat.   Our server was fantastic. Friendly and professional and checked on us throughout the meal. Good deals on select sushi rolls, appetizers, couple alcoholic drinks and wine for happy hour.   The angry edamame was wayyyyy too strong in flavor, we were not fans. Couldn't even finish it. Sushi was good, their version of sriracha mayo was realllllly tasty."}
{"text":"Good service, good beer and good miso soup. Came here after work for a snack and wasn't disappointed. Id say it's slightly over priced my soup was 5$ and prettty small but still good :) overall a good time"}
{"text":"I love it. The restaurant is on the plaza level of fashion mall. Not too expensive, and have a great selection. I ordered the sea salt caramel creme brûlée from the seasonal menu, and it tasted good!"}
{"text":"I was visiting Scottsdale, AZ, and tried the Kona Grill for the first time. Happy Hour was great food, great margaritas, great service. Appetizers were $5 each and plentiful portions. We ordered 5 of the appetizers. All of them were scrumptious. The avocado egg rolls and the sauce were outstanding--a must try. Would recommend this Kona Grill at the Fashion Square Mall to everyone."}
{"text":"Delicious food, perfectly poured cocktails, beautiful decor, strip side view, and very poorly organized staff.  That is unfortunately the best way to describe my experience at this location of Kona Grill today. Huge shout out of excellence to the kitchen and the bar for delivering freshness and quality you can taste!   This resteraunt however had a HUGE issue, organization and staffing. They were understaffed and frantic to pick up the slack. My dining experience was hurry up and wait.. and wait... and wait... and wait. While waiting I saw many people leave their tables or hunt down someone to give them their check to leave.   I watched while servers crashed into each other rushing to get to tables. I saw customers seated and not spoken to for up to 6 minutes. And there was never once   an attempt made to calm these servers as to not upset their guests.  Unfortunately I was one of the guests to had to hunt down a random employee to get my check. Upon leaving I asked to speak with the GM Luise, to let him know about my experience. When you watch frantic chaos around you while you're eating, it doesn't make you want to stay, it makes you want to leave as fast as possible. Could I have sat longer and spent more money? Sure! But not in chaos.   According to Luise, there were several call outs that day which is what led to the chaos. I don't know what the right answer is to handle that situation but I have to think calming the staff is the first step.  Just my 2 cents!"}
{"text":"I have to begin by saying that I am not going to critic on any 2 star reviews for this place... since those have been written by people who went here with wrong expectations (most of them could be wannabe's considering its Scottsdal .. oops, here goes some criticism... :D )  this place definitely does not have the best sushi in town... definitely does not have the best beer selection in town... but...   it definitely has awesome service if you sit outside... (I've never tried inside, since all we ever expected was to drink a couple beers, eat a couple rolls and pass time... ohh and occasionally watch Suns kick a** ... ;)  )  ... so coming back to the point, the best thing that this place offers is Happy Hour ! ... And people have to realize that there are some places that you SHOULD NOT go during regular hours... and this is one of those places... I don't remember paying more than 15 bucks ever for a 2-3 beers and a lot of sushi... and that's cheap considering we ate a loot of sushi... and the best this they have on happy hour menu is Sweet and Spicy Shrimp ! ... that's by far one of the best Shrimp recipes I have tried... but again, 5 stars are not for food or drinks...   So... if you want to watch Suns play, eat some good sushi with decent selection of beer, not bother about crappy service or the kind of service that bothers you with your check 25 seconds after you gulp last sip of your beer... or just to sit out in beautiful non-summer weather of Arizona (after 9pm ie :D ) and pass time with your friends, this place comes highly recommended by me !"}
{"text":"Nice place, great location. I could leave a 5 star rating because I'm in love with Kona's menu, esp. happy hours and all. However, I had to leave this place with 2, as my last experience was not something I expected. The waiter who served me failed miserably in clarifying orders and delivering the right food.   Last time I was here, I was briefly seated. Great! A server came along and took my order. Great! But then when it came to ordering extra food, I asked for \"sashimi salad\" - which the restaurant did not have in menu, but, the server did not clarify that. Indeed, he brought out seaweed salad, and disappeared for 10mins so I couldn't even return the wrong order on the spot. Not a big problem yet. Then, I ordered octopus sashimi + sweet chilli grazed salmon salad, he misinterpreted as octopus sashimi with salad, and stated that the restaurant did not have those.... So disappointed! Please have servers well-trained before putting them on the floor to serve on a busy dinner night."}
{"text":"One star for atmosphere, one star for waiter attentiveness, and one star for dessert.   We came for happy hour after reading some positive yelp reviews. The sushi, while cheap, was meh. We ordered the special crab crunch roll, regular special crab roll, Atlantic roll, philly roll, spicy ahi roll, and gyoza. All the rolls pretty much looked and tasted the same. They were a bit on the small side and lacked the depth of flavor that I normally expect from sushi. Maybe the \"regular menu\" sushi items are a bit better (someone ordered a nigiri platter and it looked delicious) but as far as happy hour goes I wasn't blown away. Again, though, for about $4 a plate, not terrible. I also ordered the Happy Hour Margarita, which was good and strong.   Our waiter was prompt and we didn't have to wait long for his attention even though we sat at the sushi bar away from his other tables. For dessert we had the brownie a la mode thing, which sounded CRAZY expensive at $7.50, but the brownie was huuuuuge and decadent and the perfect texture. We split it between the three of us and it was more than enough.   Bottom line: Probably won't come back here for sushi but may return to try other menu items and drinks and desserts."}
{"text":"I have been a customer from the day they opened way back when...could be 10+years.  Experience is mostly at the upstairs bar / patio during happy hour but I have sat down to several formal meals in the restaurant and would also rate them at 4-5 .  The servers have changed over time as has the menu slightly, upgraded interior decor was well done.   The expanded all day Sunday happy hour has landed Kona solidly back on the Sunday rotation."}
{"text":"We like the happy hour and outside bar seating. Unfortunately it's not particularly cheap. Food is good, drinks are decent, but it's a higher price."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for as long as I remember. Recently we have been enjoying coming in on Sunday which has discounted sushi and appetizers. They removed the $6 sushi and now only have $8.50 and $10.50 options but that isn't what my review is about. It's about the nasty waitress we had. She rolled her eyes when we asked her for the happy day? menu and slammed it down on the table. So we walked out. If you want respectful people and good sushi go to yama sushi"}
{"text":"Love this place and highly recommend it to all people who are looking for brilliant flavor and a cool spot to hang!"}
{"text":"We have come here for mom's night out a few times and they did a fantastic job for our Parenting Group's holiday party.  The food is solid, I liked their sushi rolls.  My husband likes their flatbreads.  The salads were very good.  For our holiday party, we had the back patio all to ourselves.  It was really nice to have that area to enjoy with our friends and be able to mingle and have our white elephant gift exchange.  It was our most successful party yet."}
{"text":"Looove happy hour, the food is yummy. Our waiter was great! Different from rampart experience but still bomb! Love the giant fish tank."}
{"text":"We love you kona grill ! My boyfriend and my first date place. We have now been together for 8 months. We looove the food, and we've made this our family spot. Just tried the one on the strip for the first time, gotta Go write a review for them as well. See ya soon kona grill !"}
{"text":"I recently went back to Kona for a visit, it's been a few months, and I was disappointed to hear that my absolute favorite server is no longer working there. She always gave me fabulous & personable service with a laugh & I was upset to hear she is no longer there. Food was great anyway, love their happy hour, but the service wasn't as good without my favorite server."}
{"text":"I go to the kona grill in boca park, and it's amazing. Beautiful ambience, servers, and food. Decided to visit the one on the strip since I was in the area and like kona so much. They didn't except my yelp offer and the food and service were mediocre. Won't be coming to the kona at the strip again."}
{"text":"Not one detail of our Kona Grill dining experience could have been better.   High Street is always a favorite location to seek out trendy unique restaurants whether you want a full meal or glass of vino. Kona Grill is at the far end so sitting on the patio gives a view of the desert sunset.  We live through the summer heat to enjoy outside dining in the autumn.   Our waitress Jamie was attentive to the pace of our experience as we started with their SUPERB margaritas at  Happy Hour prices. ($6) I'd walk a barefoot mile for the gouda fondue.  For a while it was sadly off their menu but now it's back!  I actually crave this when I am hungry.  We split our entree and without asking Jamie put them in individual plates.  The almond encrusted chicken was moist and sat on mashed red potatoes with a side of Julienne carrots.  Taste and presentation was A+ Lingering over our meal and good conversation, we vowed to come back REALLY soon."}
{"text":"I happen to work in the Boca Park plaza (AT&T) so I have been able to check out this place for a few years. It's not a very high end restaurant like the ones you find on the Strip but it's still a good eat and has a cool, trendy atmosphere. I went with a co-worker we were seated in the main dinning area. You can sit at the bar, near the bar on tall tables with stools or outside on the patio. The lighting was good, not too dark but not bright either. They had some techno/trendy music playing so that was cool.   We ordered Edamame to start, good and not a lot of salt unlike some restaurants. We ordered some drinks and the bartender made them quickly and they were a little strong (always good haha). We also got the Spicy Aioli (Kona Calamari) which was a little over battered but still tasty to us. I ordered the Pan-Seared Ahi and it was just amazing. If you like sushi or lightly cooked seafood then get this dish! It was sweet because its made with sweet chili sauce; it also comes loaded with white rice (on the bottom) and baby bok choy. My co-worker ordered Miso-Sake Marinated Sea Bass and I thought it tasted great, they did also. Its really rich in buttery flavoring so if you don't really like butter don't order this dish. The Sea Bass just falls apart when you touch it and I actually wished I ordered that after trying it.   The staff was cool and knew their stuff about the menu so that helped a lot. After some drinks the total bill was about $70 before tip. Not too bad for everything that we had and the overall great experience. Check this place out if you are tired or want a change of pace from places like BJ's or Cheesecake Factory (some of my other favorite hangouts)."}
{"text":"Visited Kona Grill on a Saturday night, we arrived about 5 ish and took a seat at a nice table at the bar. Our waitress was attentive, funny and made us feel welcome right from the start. The food that we ordered was wonderful, our selections were pot stickers, flat bread pizza and avocado rolls. Yummo.. To top off our 5 star experience one of the Mangers (Zach)  came over to our table and started a funny and delightful conversation with me and my girlfriend that left us laughing.    Nice Job Kona we will be back !"}
{"text":"I love sushi.  The sushi at this place? Expensive and its not especially worth the high price.  There are so many good sushi places in the valley.  The sushi tastes old and falls apart when you pick it up with your chop stix (BoOO).  The miso soup seems like its from a dry mix.   There are a few sushi places in town that are better quality and better prices. AKA fresher fish, better ingredients, and superior preparation.  Try: Sushi Creek:  If you don't mind a drive.  Very fresh, very well done.         Mido:  Authentic little place with fast service and great prices.          Koi:  Nice place to party and have sushi with friends (has now replaced Sushi    101 in my heart)."}
{"text":"I love coming to Kona grill, but because it's too hot in Vegas when coming for happy hour, it's too hot cause no shade in the sunny spots. The food and service is rest especially Tim one of my favorite waiters. Love coming here"}
{"text":"To be honest, their super attentive and friendly service is one of the facts that keeps me coming back in a long term. I am just so impressed with the way they treat customers -  very nice, warm, professional and just awesome overall.  I have been here twice, and never have had a bad experience with the staffs at Kona Grill. I have to give them Kudos for a perfect training and customer service. Honestly, I feel like my business is being appreciated and I always get treated like a queen (Haha, ok that's just too much but urgh, super dooper great customer service I'm telling ya)  Oh and how I love the decor with the aquarium and dimmed lights. Happy hours are full of great food and drinks. I love the sakes and also the atmosphere.  I'm sooooo coming back every week :)"}
{"text":"First of all, yes, it's very busy, especially on weekends. E.g. we went there on Saturday at 6PM without a reservation and their waiting time was 45 minutes for a table for 2. Hey, I like the place for its close proximity to our home, for their consistently good California roll with a crab mix, pork tenderloin entree, avocado egg roll, but it's not worth waiting 45 minutes. It's just a place to crash when you're hungry and you don't feel like driving to Scottsdale. The service here is not impressive, usually you will get a \"difficult to catch waiter\" type, but it's always better on weekdays. Martinis are hit or miss (I guess depends on a barman) and my favorite so far is a raspberry crush with floating fresh raspberry in it.  Never had a chance to check their happy hour menu as we don't like their bar/patio scene and you cannot get a happy hour menu if you want to seat inside of the restaurant. I'd give it 3.5 stars and definitely will go again. Am I too kind? ;)"}
{"text":"Had the best experience at this location. The bartenders Kalyn, Brett and Marco gave me extraordinary service. Would recommend this location to everyone. Best service I've ever had and defiantly will be a returning customer"}
{"text":"I don't think that it gets any better than this. Great Food and a huge selection of fresh sushi. My favorite thing about this place is the chicken kabobs and the two amazing sauces they come with. The only bad thing about this place was that the waiter tool the plate before we ate the co slaw. Other wise thats the only thing that kept them from a five star review."}
{"text":"Took the girls from work for dinner on a Saturday night. We called and made a reservation for 11 people,  just a few hours before,  and they were able to get us in. Our server was attentive,  the food was amazing. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I posted a picture of the soft shell crab roll I got to-go. It was basically inedible because it was so dry and overcooked."}
{"text":"Fish Taco's are more of a warp, but the dipping mustard sauce is die for! I'll be back for happy hour for some spicy tuna rolls and tacccooos!"}
{"text":"Still, one of the better happy hour joints in Summerlin. And you can eat somewhat healthy on this menu: Chicken Satay & a couple of sushi rolls. But for dinner is where you gotta get sum!!!!!"}
{"text":"5 stars for Happy hour ONLY, as I have heard that the experience off-HH-hours is very different, but I have not bothered to check it out at any other time.  Now I know, 5 stars for a place is pretty ballsy (and can easily kill my credibility as a trusted Yelpie), but, I think giving it anything else based on other people's experience is just ridiculous. Maybe I came in on a good day, or I was nicer than usual or maybe the starts aligned (or the powerful foodie goods or whatever you believe in), but it was 5 star worthy.  Why? Great food for what we paid and awesome service. Our server, Hunter, was really cool. She kept up with us as our party slowly grew from 2 to 9 people over the course of 3 hours. She was pretty good at recommending cheap wines that didn't taste like crap and she never gave me the impression that she was trying to make a sale, which I really appreciated.   Since I'm a frugal individual (read:cheapo), I used the HH and the Wine Wednesday deal to my full advantage. I ordered the spicy tuna and some other roll (at 50% off, ~$3 each), the corn and pesto flatbread (%50 off, ~$6) and 2 bottles of white wine (50% off, ~12 each) which left me plenty full... and drunk. Mind you I ordered all of this for my friend and I- as much as I'd like to think that I could consume THAT much wine and food by myself. Flavor-wise, the flatbread my definitely my favorite: olive-oil-tasting but not greasy on the hands AT ALL, tons of pesto and sun-dried tomato went super well with the roasted corn. I dislike capers so we got them served on the side so my friend could load them up on his bites and not mine. The sushi tasted fine- fresh and basic but nothing to write about: they were super simple rolls executed fine.  As our crowd grew larger and louder (Read: drunker), we started sharing with our server that our friend was celebrating his birthday and that we wanted to surprise him with something nice. Behind his back, she surprised us with a giant rectangle of brownie with ice cream on top. No candle, but the brownie was incredibly fudgy and moist and it was such a large piece that we all got to try it and go for seconds and thirds. As a token of awesomeness, the manager gave it to us for free, which we were even more surprised with. This time? 5 stars. Come at me, bro."}
{"text":"I can't tell about the food because I didn't get the chance to eat here but I went and when me and my boyfriend got there we were seated and about 15 minutes went by and nobody came to ask us if we wanted anything to drink and then when someone did we had some questions about the menu and they had told us that they just get the water and that our server would be out real soon another 10 minutes pass and still nothing. Finally our server appears and ask us for our drinks and before we could say anything else she was gone again. I don't know if it was just us but it looked like everyone around us was getting well taken care. We ended up walking out before our drinks even hit the table."}
{"text":"4 stars, mostly for the excellent service, and delicious Caesar salad. My friend liked her chicken broccoli stir fry but wasn't wowed.  The avocado appetizer (I can't remember the name) was surprisingly bland, enough so that neither of us finished one of them.   We would come back again to try more dishes."}
{"text":"I came here last week on Sunday. They had happy hours on Sunday which was nice. Very reasonable price and food was great. We sat down on the second floor, it was a little cold but they have heater. It was nice to sit on the second floor. We enjoyed it. Customer service wasn't great but wasn't bad."}
{"text":"Occasional guests to Vegas. Me and my husband ate here yesterday for happy hour for the first time! -(keep in mind it's Weekdays ONLY for HH ). I even called ahead of time to make sure what the HH times were, and she verified for me weekdays 3pm-6pm. I feel this information is relevant if you're looking for a great place to save some bucks, and I read all the reviews here looking everywhere about happy hour times and prices which lead me to calling them, so there you are!!   I LOVED everything about this place. We had great service, and sushi was really good. Between me and my husband, We ordered a total of 5 different orders of FULL sushi rolls, 2 beers, and 1 alcoholic beverage that the waitress recommended to me, for a total of $56. All of our food we ordered was from the happy hour menu, and we got our drinks at regular price on the regular menu (they do have HH drinks, we just wanted something different to try). Now, personally.. I think $$$ that's a good deal. I mean, it's not necessarily bonkers crazy cheap... but during happy hour they have a good list to choose from for full sushi rolls for only $4.50! And have some of the fancier rolls for HH at $10. (They have other foods on the HH menu, not just all sushi rolls, regular entrees also, and normal appetizers). Good size rolls, tastes fresh, the style of the restaurant itself is nice cooler tone Colors and modern, very clean, they have their own bathroom there which I like! Most Vegas restaurants off the strip have no restrooms, and you have to go out and find one. We also didn't wait long for our food at all, again it was like right at 3pm on a Thursday when HH just started.. so business I think was just picking up for them at the time. I think it makes a great place for all ages, I saw a family with smaller kids in there... adults up at the bar, group of girls having a get together it seemed, very good variety of different ages and groups of ppl! Anyone and everyone's welcomed there.. and their patio looks nice and refreshing, they have little misters I noticed out there to make it more refreshing, and very shady. I think this place is great for any occasion, you can literally dress as nice as you want and or be on a date.. or just be casual and go to a cool spot.   I recommend this place based on the Happy Hour options alone. If that's how good that was, cant imagine how great their regular stuff is off the menu!   Also a huge plus to me that it's apart of the fashion show mall and half outside of it! You can enjoy all the shops around there with no super inconvenience of major walking or difficult parking down in the garage. (Parking was free too btw).   Hope this helps for great comfort and great budgeting as it did for us! We will be back for certain!"}
{"text":"Took my family of 15 for a going away party for my Grandson.  We made a reservation.  We were warmly welcomed and taken to an area of the restaurant that was not overly busy.  The service was impecable and the food well prepared and very tasty.  Would like to thank the staff for an evening to remember."}
{"text":"Came here with some colleagues from work who suggested coming to Kona Grill. I'd heard great things about the food so I was game. Sat at the bar and was greeted by a nice bartender by the name of Kevin. I asked what he'd recommend for dinner and without missing a beat, he recommended the Macadamia chicken.   The food came out and something didn't feel right. Kevin came by a few minutes after the food came out and asked how my meal was. I was honest and let him know that I wasn't impressed.   Again, without missing a beat, he insisted on making it right for me. His manager Chris came by, let me know that he'd be happy to replace the meal to ensure I was satisfied.  He came back with DELICIOUS Seabass dish that melted in my mouth.   If Kevin the bartender didn't check in on me and care enough about my dining experience,  I probably would have just ate the Mac chicken and walked away not crazy about Kona Grill.   Instead, I walked away satisfied with a great meal. They, like I, value a restaurant that goes over and above a killer dining experience. I'll be coming back to Kona Grill the next visit to Arizona."}
{"text":"Ahhhhh. I've been to many upscale and all kidnaped of restaurants but Kona Grill is one of a kind!! Great I'm all aspects!!   Had Gymbalaya and sushi rolls and very presentable and delicious. Loved it. Atmosphere is very nice and service very good. Food was brought to us so fast. Great place for large group dining too. Loved it. Highly Recommended.   Adam.... thank you for your amazing service!!"}
{"text":"I wanted a light lunch and opted for a salad. It was kind of a random order since this place is more well-known for its sushi. I had the Oriental Salad ($12) which had cabbage, green onions, cilantro, carrots and red peppers. The sweet-soy dressing was really good but it was a little bit oily for me. I added salmon for an extra $6. This was one of the best salmons I've had. It was perfectly soft, tender, crispy and was glazed with a buttery sauce. I split the salad with a friend and it was the perfect amount.  For starters, I got the avocado egg rolls which came with a honey-cilantro dipping sauce. I don't think the sweet sauce paired well with the rolls though. But the rolls themselves were delicious. They were $12 but I got them for free. I was trying to find this restaurant in the mall and went up to the Guest Services table for direction. They randomly gave me a coupon for a free appetizer. Score!  This place is right on the edge of the Fashion Show Mall. Very fancy interior and great service. I would come here again to try their sushi next!"}
{"text":"A manager from Kona recently contacted me to apologize and express his thanks for my feedback. He sounded genuinely surprised by my experience which leads me to believe this was a one-off type of mistake by the staff on that particular day. As a result, I decided to try Kona again last weekend. This time around everything was spot on. The service was fantastic and our entire dinner party really seemed to enjoy their food."}
{"text":"2 words.. Happy Hour. Kona grills happy hour menu is one of best, calamari is a must and the rock shrimp and chicken lettuce wraps are a no brainer. At 6$ each your your fill, which is rare considering most happy hours leave you hungry and dissatisfied until you end up paying the price of a regular entree to get full. Kona is the complete opposite though, these 2 appetizers were enough to feed me and 1 other, and I can eat! If you really wanna test your stomach though and pass out, some other hh menu items to consider are their flat breads, and the ahi crisp (my favorite) but the ahi crisps are little bit smaller. The place gets packed pretty often but finding a seat is usually still pretty easy on the outdoor patio and the host is usually pretty spot on with their service every time I've been here. When ever I'm looking for a cheap meal on happy hour times, this is one of first places I suggest."}
{"text":"I love their happy hour!   The calamari are the best in town.  The bartenders are very friendly and it is simply the place to be after 5 pm."}
{"text":"Miso Sake Marinated Seabass?! Yes please! This fish is SO fantastically melt in your mouth GOODNESS!!  Sweet Chili Glazed Salmon?! Yes please! This is available in an entree or on a salad. BOTH are FANTASTICAL!  Happy Hour is one of the best in town. It is available TWICE a day EVERY DAY, except for Saturdays (late night only, 10pm-12am), and ALL DAY Sundays. They have a large outdoor patio for enjoying some awesome weather and in the cooler months they offer some heaters. You can get sushi rolls on the cheap, and lots of half priced appetizers. They offer a couple of house wines, beers, margarita's and cosmos for some draaaaaanks to whet your whistle. They also have specials, like Wine Down Wednesdays - HALF price on ALL bottles of Vino!  Not bad for people watching but watch out for the douche bags - they frequent this spot! =)"}
{"text":"I have been here multiple times and although the happy hour menu is great with multiple drink and food items the service during happy hour can be very slow. It took approximately 15-20 minutes before our waitress came to ask us our order. I do not know if she was on break and no one was covering her tables or if she just was not paying attention. The manager at the time did allow our group to move tables around to fit our large group together which was very nice. Despite the slow service I will of course be back, especially to try more of the new food and drink options for happy hour."}
{"text":"I am an easy to please customer. I worked in the industry for years so I appreciate how much is put into my food.. . except here. First the waiter was horrible. No suggestions, no help when I asked for choices of drinks. Same for ordering food. We ended up skipping an appetizer. Only rolls are really offered as far as sushi, not much release.  We really said little to the server when we ordered yet he slammed or plates on the table and walked away.  Food was decent for a chain restaurant, but if you want to be treated as a customer, this isn't the place to go.  Also the Bloody Mary has more garnish then drink... Including a slice of salami."}
{"text":"Happy hour is really the only reason worth frequenting Kona Grill.  Calimari, the various sushi rolls, the pizzas, and other random goodies all fall under this glorious happy hour menu.  The only downside is that it's filled with business professionals, frat boys, cougars, and $30k millionaires all vying for a spot on the patio.  It's a good thing sake bombs are on the happy hour menu or else I don't think I'd have any other way of tolerating the less-than-savory crowd.  Don't even get me started on the waiters that show up only about once or twice your entire time there."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that this 5 star rating is based on their reverse happy hour and that alone. Monday thru Saturday they feature a reverse happy hour from 10p to close. They have drinks for under $5 and sushi rolls for under $6! They have a few other things on the menu like their potstickers, etc... and the food is really yummy! The highlight of the night was enjoying drinks and food for under $15. This is only available in the bar area but I highly suggest everyone check this out."}
{"text":"Went here to have lunch and they serve such a great selection of appetizers that we order off that menu and shared! Good food, well prepared and pretty good service for a very busy Sunday afternoon. They have a good mix of food with a fresh sushi bar. Nice outside seating area too. Go out and try it!"}
{"text":"I don't understand why there are so many bad reviews, this place deserves their full five stars! It was my first time (as well as my boyfriend's first time) eating here and our experience was exceptional. Our server Zack was very friendly and helpful in suggesting food/beverages. He continuously checked on our table to ensure our satisfaction. Might I add that the Kona Chop is the by far the most delicious salad I've ever tasted, I'm most certainly going to return for more. I recommend Kona Grill to everyone (disregard the negative reviews), you be the judge of their outstanding restaurant."}
{"text":"Sunday lunch. great food, great sushi-ish rolls, and a relaxing outdoor table. All of this and not in a Casino hotel.   We all had the macadamia nut chicken, and all different sushi rolls. The service was perfect."}
{"text":"Had the Cuban sandwich. It was amazing. Sat at the bar and had the best drinks and service from the bartender Gregory. Look for him and sit at the bar!!"}
{"text":"I was here last month in the middle of a \"shop till you drop\" escapade with my Mom and sisters. Out of the years I've been coming (okay growing up) at Fashion Square I'd never once eaten here!   We ate out on the terrace and we were surprised there wasn't a wait for 4 of us on a busy Saturday during lunch happy hour. The service was friendly enough and but the sushi, oh wow the sushi was great! We ordered six or so different things and just nibbled away. I didn't have a drink since I was already battling falling over sleepiness, but I thoroughly enjoyed the food and the break from the air-conditioned mall!"}
{"text":"I came in for my first time the other day and had the best experience! Charlene made myself and the rest of my party very happy with her positive attitude and assured we were in good hands! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great quality restaurant.  Had the Sushi many times and its always good!  Big desserts to share!"}
{"text":"I was so glad that we chose to go to the Kona Grill tonight. They were so gracious and the service and food were excellent. First, we were late for our reservation, the hostess was very sweet and told us it was ok. She sat us promptly. We let our server David know that we had tickets for a 7pm show and he expedited our food and was very efficient. We were in and out so quickly (thankfully!) but still enjoyed our dinner!"}
{"text":"It gets harder and harder to get excited about a chain restaurant, but Kona at least keeps the same quality across the board.  I actually prefer this location to the ones at Chandler or Scottsdale malls.  The patio section here is much quieter, and this is in walking distance of several other places.  The sake bombers are awesome, if very potent (duh, it's sake!)  The service is always quick, even when the places is wall to wall.  The crowd is usually a good mix, with plenty of random people at the bar for interesting conversation.    The food is standard Kona fare, tasty, if a little pricy for what you get.  I could sit and eat the edamame all night, but for a full sushi meal I have places I would go first.  Ultimately the reason I keep going back to Kona is the atmosphere - I love the mixed crowd and the people watching opportunities."}
{"text":"Nice place, very clean and comfortable, friendly staff.  The sushi is better than most in the area, but not as good as Shogun on Tatum & Shea.  The rolls are large and the ingredients are usually pretty fresh and good quality.  There are several dishes for non-sushi eaters, such as steak (NY strip, tenderloin), chicken, and pork.  I like my steak very rare, and I've found it to be pretty good here, but not very flavourful.  The chicken and pork have been dry both times I've ordered them.  The salads are pretty good, especially the chef/cobb salad - loaded with chicken, egg, bacon, avocado, etc.  The appetizers are decent, with the exception of the Chicken Satay, which is delicious. The bar & patio are packed during happy hour, but we've rarely had to wait for a table in the dining room.  Service in the dining room is pretty fast.  The manager is constantly making the rounds, and is almost over-accomodating.  They are more than happy to replace or remove a charge for a meal that you weren't completely happy with."}
{"text":"This review is not about the food, atmosphere or the wait staff. All of those things are top notch and would receive five stars.   We are regulars that go to KG at least a couple of times per week and it never disappoints. The reason I am taking to Yelp with a two star review is that since TWO weeks the frozen margarita machine is not working. It might sound a bit petty but this is one of our main reasons to come to KG. A frozen margarita with some angry edamame and sashimi is just heaven. We've been there about four times in the last two weeks and even talked to the manager about it. Today I called again and it's still not working. I mean seriously?  How hard can it be? I would offer to go to Target across the street and buy you a blender if that's what it takes. So long story short, we love the place, the food and the people but we just won't go there anymore until the margarita machine works again...sorry! I hope someone from management reads this, I am sure that in a competitive restaurant environment with as many options as Las Vegas, it should be a high priority to fix something as simple as a broken margarita machine. Thanks!"}
{"text":"I can't imagine anyone giving this place less than 5 stars! I started with the Chicken Satay which was juicy and came with two sauces (peanut and a sweet sauce) that was so amazing I almost cried! Even the cabbage under the chicken had a dressing that was really delicious! Oh, forgot to mention the wine list which had more by-the-glass selections than usual and some really delicious selections too. I went out of the box and tried the Bison Burger which was also juicy and delicious. My Server, Alisha, was great too and always available when I needed her. I didn't have to wait too long to see her cause she was always checking in with me. All in all, this is by far the best experience I have had at a restaurant in a very long time. Too bad there isn't one closer to my home, I want to try all their food and see if I just ordered right or if all their plates are this amazing!"}
{"text":"A generous 3 Stars...It's a Tale of Two Konas far too often for my liking.    There are some specialty rolls (Volcano, Bama, & Sunshine Rolls) and entrees (Macadamian Nut Chicken & Miso Sea Bass) that I have really enjoyed at Kona...But far too often the food is flat.    The service is real nice and friendly, but often staffed for inefficiency rather than customer service.  The thing that gets me the most is that everyone raves about their Happy Hour...but literally none of the food or drinks make me want to come back.  Not a fan of the tacos/HH sushi rolls/mini burgers...the funny thing is there are multiple places in Boca Park that doo all these items better!  The Happy Hour drinks are cheap...and taste like they are cheap!  The restaurant is usually dead apart from the weekends because everyone is out on the patio trying up their pretentiousness status...I would rate Kona with 1 Star if I rating the crowd and atmosphere attracted to their patio."}
{"text":"love, Love, LOVE this place! Food is always wonderful and the staff are always great! My Daughter has here own favorite table and we always get it when we dine here. Can't wait to go back again and again."}
{"text":"Happy hour is great - both cocktails and appetizers are good, even the skinny cocktails.  And I LOVE angry edamame!  My girlfriend saw that I posted I was at Kona grill on my b-day (tagged on fb) and she phoned in and ordered my girlfriends and i a round of drinks at our table - how cool is that???  The waitress needed her managers help b/c officially they were not supposed to do it (my friend had to text a photo of herself with the signed card and her photo id) but they went to the extra trouble to make it happen on my birthday - what a sweet gesture!  they could've just stuck to the books and said sorry no-can-do, but instead they went the extra mile - great customer service!!"}
{"text":"I must say, I just got a new job and was looking to treat myself to a nice lunch and was not to impressed with the food. Especially at that price point. Yes the atmosphere was good and so on. But I would advise to stick to the drinks unless you are into hyped up scenes with no delivery."}
{"text":"Love the Sunday all day Happy Hour... It is my favorite day to just sit on the patio with good food and drinks and relax with friends. I do miss the bartender Christian. He always made Sundays fun. He was very personable. But overall, always a good experience."}
{"text":"If I could give my experience less than a 1 I would. So... let me walk you through what happen. My family and I arrive at Kona Grill and sit on the patio. There are other parties sitting at the other tables on the patio and inside is very busy. Understanding that it was busy we didn't say anything when 10 minutes rolled by and not 1 server came to our table with menus, water, nothing. 20 minutes later I had to go ask for a manager. Erika came to our table apologized gave us menus and and took our order. My lemonade came and tasted like water and so did my sisters so I knew it wasn't just me. Now a new sever came over and stated she will be helping us and she heard front the manager we had been waiting for a while and the manager was going to comp a dessert for the wait.   Fast forward, my fries were cold, cheeseburger off the happy hour meal was good and hot, husband enjoyed his crab crunch and everyone else was happy with their food.   The spicy shrimp tempura was not enjoyable and was not what I expected. I was thinking they would be fried deeper with dipping sauce on the side.   Ok so now the server comes around again and asked if we needed anything else, we say no she says she will get the bill and it took her 10 minutes to come back.   There was no comp on the meal, no 10% off for our inconvenience, nothing! And what happen to them offering dessert from the manager? I have been to Kona many times and always had an enjoyable experience but I will not be back."}
{"text":"I've always liked Kona Grill, especially for happy hour.  I think that both the Chandler and Scottsdale locations have a better \"vibe\" however, this is still one of the more happening places in Gilbert on Friday and Saturday nights.  I've never thought the food was worthy of five stars, however, I cannot really think of anything specific to complain about either.  Actually, my favorite thing about KG is the jellyfish light fixtures :)  We started out in the bar this afternoon, however, with the doors open, it was kind of chilly and although it was pre-happy hour, it was noisy and I felt very exposed sitting in the middle of the bar.  We decided to move to the restaurant side and sit in a booth which made for a much more comfortable and relaxing dining experience.  My friend ordered the Kona Cheeseburger with fries (the smaller 6 oz) which didn't look entirely special and the portion of fries seemed quite small.  He must have been really hungry as he wolfed it down with no complaints.  I had a hard time deciding what to order...I was hungry but not starving.  I noticed that they've changed their appetizers and no longer offer the giant onion rings :(  I opted for a fairly healthy option, the Sushi Combo ($11) which includes eight california rolls, and one each of salmon, tuna and shrimp.  The house salad (dressing on the side) was very fresh and tasty.  Overall, it was more filling than it looked and I really enjoyed it.  So, I will definitely be back to Kona, athough they certainly have competition in the immediate area.  Two of my favorites, Brio Tuscan Grill and The Keg are both great options depending on what I'm in the mood for...if it's sushi, then KG is the place."}
{"text":"Honestly I've never ate here for dinner let alone the dining room so I cannot comment on any of that. I give 5 stars purely due to their amazing happy hour.   This is one of my favorite if not favorite happy hour spots. If you are just in the mood to unwind after work, you can get cheap drinks and cheap eats at this happy hour. I have a huge appetite so I usually get far too much food then chase it with far too much alcohol and I usually escape this place after tip and tax for $25ish. I think someone who only got 1-2 items from the happy hour and maybe 1-2 drinks could escape for under 15$.    If you have not been here for Happy Hour...do it....a little hard to find a spot because its not exactly a secret...but if you find a table.....you'll thank me.    Again just a disclaimer, i'm giving 5 stars based purely on happy hour...for all I know their service and regular entrees are terrible :)...but I somehow doubt it."}
{"text":"Came to try out the new location of kona grill. To be honest I've never been a fan of the food here but I figured it's a new kitchen with new staff so maybe it would be fresher food. First problem started when the waitress (who was extremely nice and I do not blame her) brought us the wine. The wine was poured extremely short about 4 oz and we were paying 13 dollars a glass so you can imagine our disappointment. The manager came and insisted the pour was their usual and that he would get us more. The waitress then proceeded to tell us that many people complain about their pours.. ok so have management fix it?? Anyways the food was mediocre but overall I probably wouldn't come back because I'm not trying to pay 13 for 4oz of wine when I can get a decent bottle for that price and trust me I'm not cheap."}
{"text":"It's similiar to Roy's~ but less seafood-inspired. They have sushi a la carte and a wealth of \"fusion\" appetizers and entrees.    Calamari and albacore tataki appetizers were both good.    Entrees range from seafood to meat to noodles/pasta. I recommend the Macademia nut chicken...it's a specialty. And the linguine was alright...not bad at all.    Creme brulee was delicious...I'm normally not a fan but the passionfruit makes all the difference. I didn't try the fudge brownie cuz by that time I couldn't breathe, and it looked way too rich."}
{"text":"Went for the first time, loved sitting outside on the porch...well covered & mister's in the right places. Food was tasty & Paola was a great server. Will be back again."}
{"text":"This has to be the best Kona Grill in all of Las Vegas! They have the nicest staff and are prompt and ready to help you with anything. The place has incredible aesthetic and is beautiful, inside and out. The servers are kind, and eager to please. The food is fantastic and I will be coming back for more. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Great hangout on a quiet afternoon, with attentive host. The environment would be perfect for an exciting Friday or Saturday night, even better for football night.   The chicken and broccoli stir fly was gorgeously flavorful, with cilantro and ginger, but the portion size was sadly too small. So was my mom's sushi plate. Both of our plates were fragrant and tasty, just too small. Portion sizes would suit children. Certainly not recommended for those with big appetites.  Other than that, great dining option."}
{"text":"The food at Kona Grill was good...but everything else sucked.  At about 5pm my friend and I braved rush hour traffic and the mall parking lot in search of some tasty treats before catching a movie.  We were greeted by a hostess who asked us if we preferred outdoor or indoor seating.  It was 102 degrees outside, so we opted for indoor seating.  The hostess provided us with menus and the server was prompt to greet us.  All fine.  But then I noticed that there was no happy hour menu to be found.  I finally asked the server and he informed us that because we were sitting in the dining room, we were not allowed to partake of the happy hour specials.  What?  Happy hour is seating specific?  Are you kidding me?  No.  He wasn't.  He informed us that we would have to sit at the sushi bar (which was full) or outside (102 degrees) to be able to order from the HH menu.  He said we could move, but then didn't want to relocate us.  He finally relented and \"got special permission from the manager\" to allow us to order from the HH menu.  Menu debacle settled, we ordered the pot stickers, roasted corn and goat cheese flat bread, and the crab crunch roll.  The pot stickers and flat bread came out with no issue and were rather tasty.  My crab crunch roll, however, was wrong.  I informed the runner that brought it to me that it appeared I had been given the wrong sushi rolls.  She responded that \"well, they are almost the same\".  I don't care how close they are, it wasn't what I fracking ordered!  She returned with the correct menu item and it was delicious.  I also ordered a mango mojito, but was served a regular mojito, and it was awful.  It tasted like pure simple syrup and was garnished with a whole stick of rock candy.  Cute presentation, but it certainly didn't help the already too sweet flavor.  In addition to the specific pitfalls, the service was slow and unremarkable.  I doubt I'll be returning any time in the near...or distant...future."}
{"text":"About twelve of us came here for an iced tea business lunch. You know what I'm talking about. We also enjoyed a lively discussion about all things, including the food which we enjoyed.   We had several appetizers, including the Chicken Satay, Calamari, Pot Stickers and Edamami and pitcher after pitcher of their delicious iced tea. LOL.   All of us thought they did a nice job. The only question mark was with their Meat Loaf, or was it pot roast. But the Steaks, Filet Mignon, Fish, and Burgers were all very tasty and cooked to order.   Expect to pay $35 each and thank you to that corporate card. LOL. We will be back."}
{"text":"Wait time was too long. I ordered vegetarian sushi and took 20 minutes. Then ordered the portobello flatbread and took 15 minutes to get it although they said it was going to be 5 minutes. They were not busy at all."}
{"text":"I had a really good experience here. Our server had a great personality and always checked up on us. The food was really delicious and they had a good happy hour menu for drinks and food. We got about 3 different rolls and pad thai. Will be coming back!"}
{"text":"If you've ever been to Kona Grill out in Boca Park this place is nothing like it you would think on the strip the staff would be more willing to please. I have a simple formula where restaurant variables are mainly judged based on quality of food and friendliness of staff. I'm just tired of pretentious staff snubbing customers and would not consider going back based on how they treated my wife and I because I asked to stand up for dinner at the hightop table where one person said it was fine and then another person came and asked us to leave after we were already situated. Just kind of felt like I was in the low class establishment that had no respect for customers.   Ok. Went back with a group of adults for a business meeting and had very friendly service out on the terrace. I was surprised at the fact that they even had a vegan menu (sparse as it was) it's nice to see that they made the effort. The food was fresh and the alcohol was well priced"}
{"text":"Katie is an absolute sweetheart! why sit at a table when you get 5 star service at the bar! the new sushi menu is awesome too!"}
{"text":"Have eaten at this Kona grill several times, mostly during happy hour.  People seem to love the sushi, but I would barely say the menu qualifies at sushi.  I've had the jalapeno yellowtail sashimi a few times and it is good, but the portions are small and sloppily thrown on the plate.  Everything else is just rolls, with sushi grade raw fish found on only a few of them.  Most of the rolls are just crab mixture, spicy tuna mixture or baked yellowtail with other stuff thrown on to dress them up.  However, many of the other entrees are delicious and they have a great half price bottle of wine day and very affordable happy hour prices.  It's a fun place to eat, and High street is a fun place.  I would just say if you're craving sushi, go to a sushi restaurant.  All of the other dishes here are excellent."}
{"text":"yes this is in a mall, but it is by no means food court fare.  Kona has great sushi, salads, and entrees.  They have a hoppin happy hour as well.  I would recommend the teriyaki salmon salad and the Las Vegas Roll."}
{"text":"Trendy little spot good for happy hour specials and people watching. This is one of my favorite spots in Summerlin for day drinking, and yes, I have more than one. (Don't look at me like that!)  The sushi rolls are unamazing, but definitely edible and there are other good noshing options on the menu, such as kalamari, potstickers, etc. The margaritas are stiff, beers are the standard $3-4 on special.   The real draw of this place is the people watching, especially on a Friday evening when its packed. Kona is the preferred watering hole for the hot cougars of Summerlin, and the men that love them.   I fit into neither of these categories, but I enjoy this place a lot, and I'll probably be back."}
{"text":"I have been here twice and it was good but not my favorite.   This last time I went with my sister in law for sushi and drinks. My daughter also joined us on this girls night out. Her mac N Cheese was delicous! (I might order that for myself next time.. 5 stars for the mac n cheese... lol). The sushi was good but not the best. I am a HUGE sushi fan so I was kind of sad over the experience. The spicy dishes were the best ones! Go spicy or go home! The not spicy one.. I think it was Korean something or other was gross. My sister in law and I both had a Hibiscus margarita and they were good.. VERY SWEET! They also were really expensive :/ This place is not good enough for the price I dont think but it was a nice experience. Id got back for the Mac n Cheese :)"}
{"text":"Kona is my young daughter's favorite restaurant and we often go there for take out or delivery. The food is typically pretty good, but there is almost always an issue with our take out or delivery orders. Out of our last 4 orders, 3 have had issues. Today we were missing 2 items and were given an incorrect type of sushi. When I called to try to have the situation rectified on these occasions, I felt the staff was less than accommodating for the amount of issues they made pertaining to my orders. Forgetting to add include edamame beans doesn't seem like a big deal, but when a 3 year old has been looking forward to them all day and is devastated and crying  when they're not there, it becomes much more of a hassle.  In short, eat in if you must , don't dine out and don't expect the management team to care or be apologetic for their screw ups."}
{"text":"I ordered some sushi for lunch there.  The price was pretty expensive for the basic rolls.  I was really there because I craved sushi desperately at the time.  However, i think this place is more for hang out/date/fusion group with the atmosphere.  If half of your party wants american and half wants Japanese, this is the perfect place as compromise.  But if you want authentic Japanese/quality/price... then look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Pleasant atmosphere and convenient location  (the wife's workplace).  Our server (Nancy) was very nice and the food was well prepared and presented. I noticed several groups dining and everyone seemed to be enjoying their meals as well. I would strongly recommend this place for special occasions."}
{"text":"Such bad service and ambience, probably because it is so busy!! Can't move around and will not get food or drinks anytime soon so sit and relax if you are patient the food will come and it will be good.  I won't go back here unless it is after or before happy hour, the location on high st is much calmer. The music is crazy loud and so are the people."}
{"text":"Not really any different from the other Kona Grill locations. I used to frequent the Scottsdale Fashion Square location mainly because my office was right across the street from it.   This location is rarely busy other then your typical happy hour crowd. The service has been decent and patio atmosphere is preferred so get there early on in the evening if possible."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for sushi and shashimi last night and overall, the food was pretty good.  Spicy tuna rolls were excellent as well as the ahi tuna shashimi.  Gyoza was just ok.  Happy hour prices are great!  Had the shashimi flight and while it tasted very good, the portions were very, very small compared to a large price tag.  We went at around 4:00 so place was not overly busy.  Service was decent."}
{"text":"Was told about Kona by one of their chefs, Cody, we had never been so decided to come today (my aunt and I) we are on the patio great atmosphere nice patio and it's not too hot yet! Can't wait to eat, too bad they told us Cody is off today but we will just have to come back more! Happy Hour looks good too! Boca park is a great spot for this restaurant w a mix of sushi and traditional foods :) thumbs up guys! Good job!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here the other day and the food just wasn't good.  The potstickers were greasy and the shrimp salad was terrible.  There were 3 small overcooked shrimp in the salad and basically nothing else but a few chopped pieces of cucumber and some avocado.  It may be the least appealing salad I have ever had.  I will never go back again."}
{"text":"Was there Friday 11-22-13 and it was a pleasant experience.  Was freezing & raining.   Bill was $ 58 for 2 swiss kiss cocktails, 2 rolls, 2 beers, & butter cake.  Four areas:  Dinner area, bar area, sushi bar area, and patio area.  Dinner area was nice & quiet."}
{"text":"The hubby and I decided to grab a late bite after a late movie and Kona grill looked good. We came by at 11pm and were immediately seated by a friendly host and waiter. It was open seating when we arrived, so we decided to enjoy the warm Arizona night outside. Our waitress was busy when we arrived, so the manager informed us she would be with us soon and offered to take our order! I wasn't sure what I wanted yet but I was happy about the wonderful customer service. Moments later our waitress came out and took our order. I tried the sushi, which was really good! I also got a couple of drinks. Me and the hubby really enjoyed the service, food, and the outdoor seating here. Only reason they get a four is because I tried one of the speciality alcohol drinks (can't think which one) and it wasn't that great. But I love their late night happy hour specials (the price and the menu)."}
{"text":"Food is great but beware of any promotions you may get from them. The birthday or any appetizer under $12 will not be honored during happy hour, they won't even discount the amount from your bill. Sad for anyone who goes there often. Food is a 4 star but honoring birthdays or there frequent diner program is a 1 star for me. The server tried her best but tonight no discount, which stinks."}
{"text":"There are no complaints about the food.  We had Miso Soup, California Rolls and the turkey burger.   My complaints are about the lack of cleanliness. The whole restaurant is just grungy.   The floors, baseboards. The chairs are all sticky and greasy. The silverware was all spotted and just not sanitary.  The one thing they concerned me the most was the taste of the water served at the table.  It was just disgusting and I could not drink it.   I'm sure the putrid taste came from the ice.  With the condition of the restaurant, I'm sure the ice machine is not being cleaned and sanitized on a regular basis.    The server wasn't concerned when I mentioned that the water had a horrible taste.  All she said is that the water is filtered. Well maybe the filter needs to be changed.  She should have notified the manager immediately! Someone is going to get sick! I will not be back and am thinking about notifying the health department."}
{"text":"I would really like to give a 3.5, because overall this was a pretty good experience, but just not great. We started with the avocado eggroll, recommended by one of my friends, and it was pretty good... the dipping sauce was the best part. My best friend and I had the sea bass, which is my favorite fish, and were both underimpressed. The fried rice was dry and the fish had no miso flavor at all, it was pretty much just a properly cooked piece of plain sea bass(which I do appreciate, because far too many places overcook fish). They did bring me a complimentary birthday dessert, which was very nice, but there was just nothing that brought this meal to the next level. I will definitely try them again some time, but will not be rushing back to do so."}
{"text":"Our Host went and had a drink at the Bar. Or waitress brought us half our order. The suppose manager of the restaurant brought most of our order. The waitress took 20 minutes to bring the check...  We should have sat at the bar. The view of the men bartenders would have counter acted the bad service.  No wonder there are a lot of vacant spaces out here!"}
{"text":"Long story short: I meant to take photos of all the amazing stuff we ordered at Kona buuuuuuttttt Sundays is Happy Hour ALL DAY and that should be enough of an explanation as to why I, er, forgot ;)  All the amazing food aside (seriously all of it is amazing: the sushi rolls, the lettuce wraps, the dessert...), my favorite part of this place is that Happy Hour is all day on Sundays. What better way than wind down (or as I like to say \"wine down\"...get it?) the weekend or cure a hangover than with amazing food and alcohol at amazing prices? Rewind to before life got a little blurry yesterday and I remember how amazing the frozen raspberry margarita was. Then fast-forward to after my fourth one - they just kept getting better and better LOL. Before you think that this is what I do on weekends - it was actually an early birthday celebration for my girlfriend :) And Kona is honestly an amazing place to have an amazing time with great people, amazing food, and an overall amazing atmosphere (say \"amazing\" one. more. time). Our waitress was beyond nice and accommodating, there are misters outside since it's so hot, and for those of you who smoke, smoking IS allowed since it's outside seating.  If you've never been make sure to remember that it's first come, first serve so once you arrive feel free to grab a table :) I will obviously be back - this is kind of a tradition for my friends and I - and next time I'll upload photos.  There were five of us and our bill came to $130, so about $25 a person. That may seem a bit high BUT I know that between just my girlfriend and I, we ordered an entree and 10 drinks LOL. So no - it's not bad at all!"}
{"text":"Car buying, it is something that most people are familiar with.  Choices in spades; what type of trim, color, upholstery selection, sport kit, body flash, electronics levels, stereo package A. B. or C.          A Honda Accord.  This is the type of car a middle-class suburbanite who lives in a plan cloned house with 2 kids and a dog, or cat, if your into that, would buy.  He likes it for the value it provides, the build quality, and the brownness of it all.  Mr. super suburbanite likes the overall package, not too hot, not too cold.  He wants good food, better service, and a comfortable atmosphere.    Kona Grill is not for this person.  Let me tell you who would like Kona Grill.          The gentleman in the kitted Neon box, with 3000 watts of stereo, flash rims, and orange paint.  He would love this place!  All the flash and boom, and none of the quality.  Rubbish gearbox, bad engine, woeful 18th century suspension, the lot.  But at least it makes a lot of noise, and its orange.        Kona Grill is supposed to have a quality Happy Hour.  I have not tried the Happy Hour, but whatever.  The Thai peanut noodles where completely awful.  The next time I want linguine with peanut butter I'll make it myself.  The breaded onion rings, presented tower-like, delivered wave-after-wave of blandness.  I've had more convincing  water.  For a place masquerading in a Kona mask I expected more things from Hawaii on the menu, or at least an attempt with something other than pineapple, which by the way is from South America.  Kona Grill is pretty much like a Scottsdale themed Applebees.        That said, just go there to get pissed and chat up the birds on a hen night.  An A on that front.  I hear the salads are good, so I'll go back to try that and the Happy Hour.  3 Stars because what limited experience I had was woeful, but I'll go back because a bit of flash and kit is every man's secret desire.  Cheers Until then, get the beers in...."}
{"text":"Pad Thai is not super traditional but SO good. The calamari was pretty good, but the sushi was incredible.  Decent service, it was pretty busy but the food came it pretty quickly."}
{"text":"Man what a disappointment, came here for dinner and had to wait over an hour for sushi and flat bread pizza unfortunately the flatbread pizza never even made it out before we left, 20+ min to even take our drink order. To top it off we were asked if we wanted to order more food when we asked for our check? Something is wrong and needs to be fixed."}
{"text":"The happy hour is always amazing as well as the service    can never complain about anything here    have save room for dessert if you can cause it's just as good as the happy hour.    keep up the great job guys."}
{"text":"This place has great food, but they have ruined the atmosphere.  There used to be a beautiful fish tank in the middle of the restaurant.  Now it is just a wide open bar that has no ambiance.  Too noisy for conversation."}
{"text":"Typical Kona.  The decor is nice but the food is nothing spectacular.  The sushi rolls are not great, nor is their version of Pad Thai.  Good happy hour prices though.  I was here within the first few weeks of this location's opening, and the service could use some improvement.  And this is no Fashion Square.  You definitely feel like you're out in the burbs somewhere, with people in their 40s - 60s (even in the bar) and younger couples with strollers."}
{"text":"This is a beautiful restaurant. They even have strip side patio. It was chilly so we chose the bar area.   We have been to the Summerlin location a few times so we were excited to see this at Fashion Show. This one is much nicer.  It was too early for a crowd. 5:30 so we were seated promptly and our server came right over. Ordered 2 Sangrias a flat bread pizza and a salad. The Sangria was not good. Tasted like some put a splash of wine and filled with soda.  I compare all Sangria to the ones from the Tommy Bahama restaurant and this fell way short. The waitress came back and asked how the drinks were and I just said very impulsively not good. She said oh no. Let me get you something else so that was nice she cared.  The chicken flat bread pizza was delicious as was the salad I got.  When leaving we noticed we were not given the happy hour price on the pizza paid 6.00 more but was too tired to wave her down to adjust. So, in short: be careful of your bill and  don't order the Sangria."}
{"text":"Honestly, I go to Kona Grill for their awesome happy hours. There are some really awesome options in terms of rolls and flatbreads for such great prices. Drinks are also pretty good. I like this strip location because you have a really nice view if you're an outdoor seat type of person. Service is also great."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Arizona. Kona Grill has been around since the 1990s.  The first  restaurant was at Fashion Square where I had lunch there almost every day. Macadamia nuts chicken is to die."}
{"text":"We were mall walking and stumbled upon Kona Grill one evening. It was a party of 8, 5 adults and 3 kids. There wasn't a long wait and we were seated promptly. The hostess even offered our kids Etch A Sketchs to keep them entertained, that was a plus!   I ordered the sunshine roll and it was good. I don't usually eat spicy but it was just the right amount of hot for my taste buds. The kids enjoyed their mac n'cheese. Service was excellent.   The only complaint I have is that no one mentioned that they were participating in Restaurant Week. I found out the next day.I would have wanted to see what their 3-course prix fixe menu was for $30.."}
{"text":"I am extremely disappointed in the food here. What used to be a great place to come for drinks and appetizers, has turned into a place of undercooked food and lousy atmosphere. Our chicken was raw, the shrimp mushy and potstickers were horrible.  I would not recommend this place and I am a local.  Overpriced and undercooked!!"}
{"text":"Happy to say, Kona grill the Hawaiian inspired US chain offers a new and much needed injection to the local restaurant scene in the area. A cross between a milestones/joey's, sushi joint offers a chic atmosphere with some pretty good drinks and entrees. Service is attentive a little overwhelming at times,  but blame that on a restaurant trying to carve out a decent reputation in an uber competitive restaurant scene in the GTA where many chains have failed.  Some of our hits was the yellowfin tuna with jalapeño, and the happy hour drinks were good.  Don't get me wrong, this place does have things to improve on, but it was a solid first visit.  And love the tunes guys!"}
{"text":"Four of us went for dinner.  Expectations were high after reading Yelp.  Note to file: read ALL the current reviews.  Arrived about 8:30; 25% of seats occupied.  Service extremely slow for drinks, & dinner.  Can't imagine what it would be like with more customers in house.  Food OK at best.  Food delivered; had to ask for setup.  Food warm, not hot.  Had to ask twice to get side dishes.    Half way through our meal, 3-4 members of wait staff sat down @ next table to eat while talking loudly to the point where I asked them to \"keep it down\".    We won't go back.  Too many other options in the area with excellent food and service."}
{"text":"Eaten here a few times. Consistently fresh sushi & the rainbow roll hits the spot. The pork medallions with bok choy and mashed potatoes were cooked perfectly & all well spiced. The Cuban sandwhich was outstanding. I do enjoy a good Cuban sandwhich, but they're rare to find around town or if found one that is better than I can make on my own. Nevertheless the food was again great today Sep16, 2015 approx 4.p.m., staff professional, resturant & mens restroom clean. It was great meeting a fellow Vet working here...great cook & went out of his way to personally serve our food so it wasn't \"dying\" in the window. One team Hooah!"}
{"text":"This is a good dining option to grab a bite while shopping at Fashion Show Mall and you're just not feeling like food court fair.  The menu has a lot of healthy options if you want to save your calories for some of the more decadent restaurants during your trip to Vegas. Kona has decent sushi rolls and they keep it simple - none of that crazy American speciality roll biz.    My favorite app here is the potstickers. The filling is incredibly flavorful and the wrapper dough is spot on - not too thick with the perfect pan sear. Delish.  Use the Yelp check in order to get them for free.  I wish I had noticed that was available before I started writing this review, but it is something I will remember next time I drop into town and swing by the Fashion Show Mall."}
{"text":"I crave the salmon salad at Kona Grill.  It is fantastic and it is hard to order anything else!  You won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Happy hour has good pricing and selection. Voodoo roll with crawfish missed the mark but still worth a stop in."}
{"text":"We had the best experience here. From the warm greetings from the hostess to the prompt and friendly service from the staff. The culinary experience was superb and the Patrick the general manager was more than kind and professional. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"My server jamie was the best server i have ever had at a high end restaurant and thats saying a lot. Its weird getting such good service from such a young hot girl."}
{"text":"Can't really say much about Kona...I don't really understand the concept because it's not Island Food and the whole chain is about being a Sushi spot.  Our Waitress was pretty solid, but the bussers failed her in failing to bring the Sriracha that I had requested when asked if I needed anything else and then not refilling our water.  She did hook us up with waters to go though.  Maybe it was a bad night for them, idk.  Not really worth my time when I like Thirsty Lion's menu a lot better.  The Brooccoli Stir was delicious, and I'm never allowing my girlfriend to choose sushi again, because the baked salmon was brutal."}
{"text":"Kona Grill is the epitome of sushi in AZ....that is LOUD, overpriced, mediocre fish quality, did I mention loud?  It's a fun time if you're going out for a night out with a group....plenty of menu options which should be red flag number one.  What kind of self respecting sushi restaurant serves flat bread.  What??  Perhaps this place knows exactly what it is though...catering to the palates of Phoenecians.  I can't bring myself back here for a long time.  I will say that the kids menu is a good value and they can get something other than grilled cheese and nuggets fare for $6.50.  Their rolls, all expertly crafted to mask the fish quality are $12-$16 or more. $7 for a tuna roll?  $4.50 for a single bowl of Miso soup!?? Maybe if they had some combination platters or bento boxes of some sort, it might ease the pain, but I'm not returning unless I want to go to a nightclub again....and eat some bleh sushi at the same time."}
{"text":"Came here this afternoon with a group for my friends birthday party I love this location for the large patio scrumptious food and especially the staff the manager there his name is Bob and he's an amazing guy super friendly and attentitive and helpful with all your needs for a great experience! Highly recommend this spot thanks Bob!!"}
{"text":"After years of walking by Kona Grill and not giving it a try, I was invited to try it out at a Yelp Elite event. I was able to sample their highly recommended macadamia nut chicken and sweet chili glazed salmon, both of which were good but wasn't tasty enough to have me return on my own time. At the event, I was lucky enough to score a gift card which led me to return today.   They are currently offering a free appetizer or sushi roll with the purchase of an entree with yelp check-in (up to $14). I wasn't going to let this generous offer slip out of my hands so I ordered the sunshine roll (spicy salmon, salmon, and shaved lemon) and the jambalaya (crawfish, chicken, crushed red pepper, cilantro, hoisin, sesame, white rice). Both entrees were spectacular! The jambalaya was the best I've ever tried. They were extremely generous with the crawfish and only priced at $20.  The sunshine roll has easily become one of my favorite rolls of all time. The salmon and sliced lemon combination leaves you feeling refreshed. The spicy tuna inside adds a little kick to the roll. This roll is simple, so don't go overboard and drench it in soy sauce. Learn to appreciate the simplicity of sushi rolls if you can.  I was so happy with my meal that I bought the holiday deal that they have going on at the moment. $50 gift card purchase will get you a $10 bonus. Their entrees range from $20-$30 so any bonus will be put to good use. I can't wait to return again and check out their happy hour selections (Mon-Fri 3-6pm)!"}
{"text":"This place is a hit and miss sometimes The service is not that good But the food is Went there last night ordered hamburgers well-done they came out medium rare So we had to wait for For them redo Another 30 minutes No apologize no free drink here your  ticket bye-bye"}
{"text":"The house salad came with bleu cheese on it. Not for me so that was minus. Bathrooms were out of TP, not acceptable for a restaurant like this.  The main courses were tasty, Cajun salmon bow tie for me and flatbread pizza for the little one. Took forever to get a working pen to sign the bill!"}
{"text":"This is my go to spot! The service is always good and the food is consistently great. The Happy Hour is the best! I get $4 mules and sushi rolls and my teenagers get sliders and pizza. Everyone is happy."}
{"text":"Its been about a little over 3 years since i've been here, so i will only base my rating on the experiences i had here then.  I moved to AZ when I graduated from highschool and made friends with a bunch of other non arizonians and we came here probably 3 times a week for happy hour. I was only 18 and the rest of my \"crew\" were of age. I had never had sushi before so this place was a little intimitating at first, but once i started to try it, i enjoyed it very much so. (Now that i'm more of a sushi expert, i can say their sushi wasn't great, but good for beginners.) I can still say (at least 3 years ago) that they have the best calamari i've ever had. This place, at the time, had a great atmosphere and saki bombs were okay to do here...   It may have just been the company i was with, but i greatly enjoyed coming to this place and sneaking saki bombs and shots :)  next time i go back to AZ to visit, this place is a must"}
{"text":"The food was overpriced and mediocre. Also, it is way too warm inside in the dinning room in the summer."}
{"text":"Very good food, kind attentive staff and very quick. Sushi was standard nothing special. One complaint was the fact people kept bringing strollers with toddlers in. Seemed much too fancy to have that."}
{"text":"The food was good and the service was great! It's also in a good location so we were able to walk there from the mall since it's right outside and it is easily accessible if you are at Encore or the Wynn"}
{"text":"If I could give half stars, I would give this a two and a half based on my recent visit.  There seems to be a general theme here regarding the service.  I have been here on more than one occasion and have yet to experience decent service.  However, the last two times I have been here has me contemplating not coming back.  It took us 20 minutes of sitting at our table outside and asking another server if we had a server for him to come and greet us.  When he did, he asked us what he could get for us...   Now, considering patio is open seating, one would think the first thing you would do when you greet a table would be to bring a menu.  Not this guy.  So when we asked for menus, it took another 5 minutes.  Interesting start to a dinner.    I do have to say that their Happy Hour prices are not bad and their HH sushi roll prices are comparable to RA.  This is the one and only thing that would make me consider coming back here, because at least their food has been consistently decent and the prices are OK.    It is unfortunate that the service here is slowly going downhill as I was hoping that since it is close to home it could be a spot for us to come every once in a while to relax.  A little hard to do when you have to wait 15-20 min for a drink and a menu."}
{"text":"Boca park munching on their 3pm-7pm happy hour drinks, calamari, sushi rolls, chicken satay, and Saki bombs!!"}
{"text":"Tried what's about this Kona grill resto...We ordered flat bread pizza and chix lettuce wrapped..and drinks, was hoping they have a li hing mui margarita , unfortunately they don't know what is li hing mui , thought they have coz the name of the resto itself is Kona haha, (Hawaiian right?) Ambiance is nice, staff was very accommodating ...and plus the food we ordered was worth the pay"}
{"text":"Came on a Saturday night was not happy with my experience here disappointed in this establishment also please update your hours of operation on yelp"}
{"text":"Great food as expected and the bartender, Johnny, who's a true mixologist, was a lot of fun!!"}
{"text":"after posting 4 star review listed I was contacted by \"jose\" who did not offer apology or explanation but instead said that next time I came by he would make \"something very special\" for my wife. very snick snick and I am reading between the lines. no thanks jose."}
{"text":"I love this place because it has great sushi and other items on the menu for non sushi enthusiasts so I feel that anyone can find something their liking in this establishment. The service is always consistently good and good fresh.  I love their salads they main course size. Their sushi is fresh and Unique. I love the vegetarian roll, I'm not sure what's all in it but it has such a fresh unique flavor. The wine list is very nice with many varieties at many different price points. The only area the restaurant is lacking is the dessert list. I felt it was rather flat and basic."}
{"text":"Went in for dinner before the comedy show. Our sushi order was a bit slow but the manager was extremely accommodating to compensate for the delay. I was extremely impressed with the customer service, it made me want to go back. Plus the sushi rolls were delicious!"}
{"text":"I showed up without a reservation on a busy night.  They did their best to accommodate us with a big party while we were waiting for a table.  Staff was super friendly and helpful, food and atmosphere was great.  I will go back for sure."}
{"text":"Great happy hour! Went in there Sunday night and sat at the bar, bartenders name was Glenn. The bar was full and the restaurant was about half full. Ordered a chambord frozen marg and some appetizers. Food came out quick and everything tasted good. Bartender was very attentive and made sure everything was up to standard at all times. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Best happy hour.. I've been coming here since becoming based here. There isn't a sushi on the menu I don't like.. Sake bomber.. Be careful .. They pack a .. Bomb .. Patio good for people watching .. Get there early for hh on patio.. It's packed .. That's a good sign.."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the Scottsdale quarters area, and this was my first time at the kona grill they opened this year in the area. It's was Friday 8-11-2017, when I was escorted to my spot at the bar I was greater by one of their for bar tenders, her name was Lisa she was a go to for me the majority of the the night, but the other 3 guys that were back there all at one point or another made sure to always check on me for anything I needed and everyone else for that matter. I've owned bars before and watching the team work at this place to ensure the guest is always number one is awsome, I ordered a Las Vegas rol which as u can tell in the picture was delicious... this place their staff has won a good word from me that's pretty much all I can say..."}
{"text":"I'm actually surprised at all the negative reviews. I came here last night for the first time with a friend of mine and my experience was great. We got seated, and we were quickly greeted by our server. We got some drinks which were pretty good and we also order some avocado rolls, calamari for my friend and a portabello mushroom flatbread. Our food came quickly and it was delicious. I asked our server for some hot sauce and he gave me sriracha . I mixed it in the cilantro dipping sauce for the rolls, took a dip and oh my was it delicious. We devoured it in less than 30 seconds. I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Thank you Kona for my Konavore reward. The best reward program, no doubt! But what I am really excited about was my meal, because I think I have finally found the best chicken dish in AZ! Hands down the Macadamia Chicken is the most delicious dish I have had in a long time, and I'm so happy I found it. The creamy sauce on top, and the citrus-like sauce on the side compliment this dish so well, so I'm hooked! My server Christina, the view from my table and the weather as well just made for a very nice visit. So I appreciated my experience at Kona today, and hope to be back soon. Next time I am planning to try their Cuban sandwich, so I'm coming back with a plan :)"}
{"text":"Great happy hour specials on sushi!  I love it that they have reverse happy hour every day of the week as well.  Their sushi is awesome too.  Great place to go after a movie."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant.  I really enjoy the reverse happy hour from 10pm-12am after I see a movie.  The appetizers are 1/2 price and they have some really good drink specials- better if you are a lady.   l like sitting out of the patio and relaxing.  The sushi rolls are good.  So are the avocado eggrolls.  Before I was a vegetarian the only thing I would order was the macademia crusted chicken with mashed potatoes and a creamy soy sauce."}
{"text":"Good bartender. On it, with food and drink. Like the Picasso roll. For its size it would be $18., on their menu $14.. Most expensive roll on menu. The lobster/shrimp roll was fresh. Just too much texture and not enough punch for me though its listed as spivey."}
{"text":"I just went back here the other night and it was great pizza like always but be careful if you want to sit outside and you go after 10 since it is reverse happy hour and anyone under 18 can't be outside. We had to sit at the sushi bar to get the happy hour prices which sucks. We really want to eat there while enjoying the night, my last review was higher but I was not happy with the service this time. Too bad maybe next time."}
{"text":"Thank you all staff at Kona Grill we had a good time and very delicious food. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"While at the Chandler Mall getting our cell phone repaired, we thought we'd stop in to Kona for some sushi. We were craving sushi and ordered from their Happy Hour menu. Katherine was our waitress and she was a peach. Smiling and happy and very helpful.  We had the calamari to start which was cooked well but a bit mushy with too much flour breading. We also ordered the Philly, seafood, and crab rolls. They were fresh but the seafood and crab ones tasted the same and were mushy too. The Philly roll was good.  Not sure we will be back for sushi but the regular menu looked good."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Always exceptional food.  And the all day happy hour on Saturday means $5.5 for six rolls plus lots of other choices.  Highly recommended.  Oh, live the saltwater fish tank"}
{"text":"Great for Happy Hour! Must try the calamari and Saki Bombs."}
{"text":"Well, I have been to this Kona Grill before and was satisfied with my experience. Tonight was an unfortunate change.  Lets start with the waiter. I know its a casual environment, but this guy went beyond casually arrogant. He (I think) was over the top with the the metro style of dress and spoke to my wife and I like we were hiking buddies. Unprofessional to say the least.  The food. We started with calamri. Little greasy, but pretty good overall. Next was the spider roll; mostly roll and not enough spider, especially for the money. Next came the salmon sashimi. Not bad but they need to invest in serving size and a proper sushi chef to do the cutting.  Oh and last but not least. The Entree: My wife ordered the Salmon. Overall ok, but again, the chef needs to learn a little finesse.  My entree was the Miso Sake Sea Bass.  Sea Bass is my favorite fish and I was very much looking forward to this meal. Not to mention its my birthday and we chose Kona. So at long last the Bass is served and to say the least, it was well overcooked. I know what carmelization is and its does not mean blackened! So, to be given the excuse of \"oh thats just a little carmelization\" was a bit insulting. So I respectfully asked for another dish to be made. Not part of the dish, the entire dish.The person who brought us our dishes was the manager no less, and he had actually asked me to keep the sides and to let them just cook another piece of Bass. Really? They are meant to be eaten together!  So, I stated clearly that I wanted an entire new entree prepared to which he seemed surprised but said ok. When I finally received my \"new entree\", it tasted like it had been under a heat lamp while waiting for the new Bass to be finished!   The rice was crusty and luke warm, while the ratatouille was cold & bland. Um, salt anyone?  So, not wanting to prolong the agony and saving my wife from seeing her husband disappointed on his birthday, I gulped down the fish and called it a night. We will not be back and neither will our rather large Scottsdale/Cave Creek family.  So, avoid at all costs. There are better places with better food, better service and where you dont have to fight the nightclub type noise and incompetent staff."}
{"text":"Walked into bar area for HH on a Saturday and the place was pretty slow. Except every high top table was dirty. Had to sit somewhere though. Our waiter HATES his job and or life. You could smell it on him. I would recommend hiring happier people who want to please customers and make good tips. This Kona Grill definitely needs  to work on their customer service. It's in bad shape. * also they are always out of HH house wine. Instead of telling us,  the server charges us for a wine that was 2 $ more. I am not cheap but at least be up front about it instead of manipulating the situation."}
{"text":"The food is nothing special, prices are high, took almost an hour to get our food, the waitress messed up the order, then messed up our bill. We sat outside which was nice, until smokers walk by  They played loud obnoxious music like we were at a dance club. We couldn't even hold a conversation.  That was my first and last experience at Kona."}
{"text":"Excellent happy hour and it lasts until 7! The food is delicious and so are the few drinks they have on their happy hour menu. Reasonable prices for happy hour. Early on between 4-6 it can be hard to find a place to sit, but well worth the wait."}
{"text":"Great place to go on Sundays.  Happy hour menu all day long.  Perfect for football season!"}
{"text":"Stopped in with a girlfriend last month after having some girly shopping time with one another and were craving some sushi, everything was great , service and food both! We started and shared traditional  edamame an miso soup which both were great, although The soup was a bit bland, I love mine w/lots scallions and strong flavor! The sushi rolls were all yum, I really loved the spicy shrimp tempura one, wasn't crazy spicy but just enough! Picasso roll was also amazing but I personally wasn't a big fan of the cilantro relish on it, I'm not a big relish texture or taste fan! Lol , and of course we both loved the Vegas roll !! Overall we had a great experience and defiantly left with full stomachs & happy faces!!"}
{"text":"Pretty much the bomb diggity. Love this place. Sushi is amazing and don't miss the avocado egg rolls."}
{"text":"I actually enjoyed my experience here. Went here today and last week after a networking event. Last week we had Emily and another co-worker Jamie. They were both on point.   Emily dealt with my friend and I's nonsense getting the most condiments and asking for specific things in our orders like mustard on the side and extra crispy fries and more mustard and then no pickles on one sandwich. It was quite entertaining for all of us as we made some jokes and both Emily and when Jamie was around laughed and related to us. They didn't give us bad looks or get mad and rolled with it and that's important.  Why because I don't go to places to be miserable and depressed I go to enjoy the experience from the greeting to the good bye.   The food was good and when you check in you get a free app or sushi deal and that's pretty legit. Had the Cuban sandwich and today a salad added chicken. Both good and again the service topped it. Emily even remembered us today and that's key. Enjoyed it and I went disappointed at any time dining here."}
{"text":"Dominique is awesome. great service definitely made the experience. not really into the Vegas roll but the avocado egg rolls are bomb. so is the sangria"}
{"text":"Not sure what the fuss is about, prefer RA Sushi next door!  PROS: -Nice atmosphere (although Champ's shoe store is right at their entrance..so many sightlines will have this bright store square in your view). -Beautiful fish tank. -Food generally tastes good. -Great taste in music, lots of 90's rap, pop & R&B.  CONS: -Shrimp fried rice was sub-par though, and had pork in it, not good for a pescatarian to eat!!!...should have warned us based on how we asked what was in it compared to the fried rice. After that first bite, had them redo it. -Very small portions. -High prices."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in for some sushi and were not disappointed.  fish was fresh and tasty.  Bartender made a great dirty martini!"}
{"text":"Food was fine but a bit overpriced.. wasn't too impressed with the calamari appetizer or my sandwich. My friends ordered the salmon salad and pad thai... both looked delicious.  Maybe I just ordered the wrong thing. Our server Jamie rocked! I'd be willing to try it again.."}
{"text":"We stopped by for dinner tonight the place looks great but the food took a long time to come however the manager Johnny was wonderful and very apologetic and immediately took care of the bill. He was extremely courteous..wish all restaurant managers are like him!"}
{"text":"Just had lunch at Kona Grill! It was really good. Our waiter Juan Garcia was the best!! He took great care of us and knew the menu well. Our only complaint was no spicy shrimp tempura.  We loved that appetizer!! Anyway, ask for Jaun because he is attentive and treated us so nice.   Thanks for you excellent service. Will ask for you again!!"}
{"text":"Very small sushi portions! I ordered a yellow tail hand roll and it was literally half the size of most hand rolls! They should just call it a \" mini\" hand roll and not charge $8 for it! Their traditional rainbow roll and \"voodoo\" roll were also on the small side.  When are they gonna expand their Asian beer offerings??? Hello, Asahi, Hite, Orion are all better than Budweiser Brewerd Kirin.  I remember why I haven't eaten at a Kona grill in a long time.  Definitely won't be going back.  Server was nice."}
{"text":"What a fabulous experience!! When its 11pm on a Saturday night,  everybody is closing but you want great food........stopped in here and Manny (bartender) welcomed us in. Thank you!!  First of all, everything we had was so good,  full of flavor and hit the spot.  I have to say though.... the avocado egg rolls.....AMAZING!!!! the sauce for dippng...AMAZING!!!!  Thank you for a fabulous late night meal!!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing. The Las Vegas roll is amazing. Drinks were kind of pricey but delicious. Very chill atmosphere.  Servers are super friendly."}
{"text":"Saturday lunch. Great service, good drinks. Everything was great. Kids bento box was amazing and only $7. Best Cuban sandwich and sweet potato fries I've had."}
{"text":"Kona Grill is consistently good.  It's one of a handful of places that we default to if we have company in town and no one has a specific preference.  My wife and I have also celebrated a few of our birthdays and anniversaries here.  There are almost three distinct parts of this restaurant: a good amount of indoor seating, a bar that extends outside, with a decent amount of seating, and a small outdoor eating area.  Indoors is fairly quiet, the bar is typically noisy at dinner time, and the outdoor dining area falls between the two.  Indoors is somewhat dark and comfortable.  There's ample seating and other than one time, we've always been able to walk in and get a table without a wait.  If you're going for a special day like Mother's Day, it's best to make a reservation.  The bar and dining outside are first come, first served.  Oh, for those transitional weather days when it gets chilly in the evening, there are heaters outside.  During the warmer times of the day, the seating is covered.  The menu is big enough that you'll find something (or a lot of things!) to enjoy.  There's also a fairly robust sushi bar with seating, or you can have any sushi creation brought to your table.  A respectable assortment of sushi rolls are listed on the menu.  There's also a great assortment of salads, soups, chicken, seafood, beef and vegetable dishes prepared the American continental way, or with a Hawaiian or Asian flare.  Go and enjoy, swim through the menu, and see what you like.  And it's located in Boca Park, so you'll have some before or after dinner options for shopping or strolling there or just next door at Tivoli Village."}
{"text":"We celebrated our one year anniversary with a late lunch at Kona Grill. We were in time for their happy hour menu, and it was totally worth it. We tried several rolls: the fiery shrimp, the crab special, the Las Vegas and checkerboard. Neither of us were huge fans of the checkerboard, but the other three were pretty good, especially the Las Vegas one. We tried their house margarita and the old fashioned, and boy were they strong! Just the way I like 'em! Overall, this was a nice meal with great drinks, all for a great price. And the yelp check in offers definitely help as well! :-)"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to dinner here tonight (August 17th) and had one of the best servers we've ever had. Our waiter Grey \"like the color\" went above and beyond for us.  Food was amazing, love the atmosphere a lot better then the blasting music of places like Ra.  Definitely will be back just because of how great our waiter Grey was. We ended up ordering the wrong item, and he fixed it for us even though it was our fault. This guy deserves a raise."}
{"text":"This location is never packed during happy hour, big TVs and patio area. Staff don't bug you!! Great part. Happy hour is reasonably priced and a decent selection."}
{"text":"Holy Avocado Egg Roll! As soon I took a bite of this, the flavors were bursting and it felt like I was in Hawaii for a second! If I could eat these everyday, I would but that is not going to happen.  Kona not only has fresh sushi rolls, nice variety there, but they offer American cuisine as well.   Happy hour is pretty bomb at this place.  Like most reviews, menu is higher priced so if you're not going during HH just be prepared.  Menu has a good variety.  Fish tanks add a nice feel but would appreciate a little more vibe to escape from \"everyday dining\"."}
{"text":"After a long day of wedding dress shopping with my brother's fiancé and her sisters, we were tired and starving.  I was craving Avocado Egg Rolls so I insisted on stopping by Kona. We entered through the mall entrance and proceeded to head upstairs to the bar area outside so we could just seat ourselves and enjoy the beautiful weather.  To our delight we found out Happy Hour is all day Sunday. Wahhh-hooooo!!  So in addition to my Avocado Egg Rolls I was also able to try the Chicken Potsticker and they were amazing. First off, thank you for having chicken, too many places have pork and I just don't do pork. I wasn't expecting them to be so crispy, but they were fantastic.   I couldn't tell you what the other ladies had because I was enjoying every last bite of my late lunch to pay attention.   Knowing there's Happy Hour all day Sunday will likely cause me to rearrange my schedule so I can get two appetizers for the price of one!"}
{"text":"I want to start out saying that at one time I really liked kona grill. I hadn't been there for awhile and unfortunately the quality just seems to have taken a dive.  We had the sweet and spicy shrimp appetizer. The shrimp were soggy, and I'd be inclined to call it candied soggy shrimp. It was as though a jar of sugar had been poured over the dish. The shrimp were also on crispy rice noodles that are normally edible. These tasted like stale styrofoam. Dish was indelible and thankfully they took it off our bill.  We also had the chicken lettuce wraps...extremely salty and also borderline I edible. We chocked back some of the chicken since we were in a rush and were then afraid to try anything else.  Basically a lot of sugary and over salted processed food. If I go back ill stick to the sashimi."}
{"text":"Here I am bar has 12 people in it took 20 minutes to get a food order...this barback is slow as hell...maybe I'm grouchy cuz I'm tired. 30 min got order in...left menus....the restaurant isn't even full."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a great happy hour in this area of town, stop here. The bar area is really large, and there are a ton of tables. When it is nice out, get a table outside. There is great service, too! Can't wait for my next happy hour there!"}
{"text":"Love Kona Grill.  Have eaten at all the locations and it remains one of my favorites.  Sushi is terrific, especially the ahi. Absolutely love the Sea Bass.    Servers are great at all locations. NJ location remains my favorite!  Only issue I've had was at the Gilbert AZ location where the front desk was less than helpful (actually kind of rude).  Service and food, however, more than made up for the disappointing front desk staff."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times... had the Pad Thai with Chicken and Shrimp both times because it was so delicious.  Never had the sushi and can't speak to anything else.  But that Pad Thai was sooooo good with just enough spice and just enough tanginess.  Yummy!"}
{"text":"The food was good. The sushi was fresh. This was better than average sushi but I definitely had better. The only reason why I gave this place 3 and not 4 stars was because we paid $100 for 2 people to eat sushi. I keep scratching my head wondering why it cost so much for and an average atmosphere restaurant that was pretty much away from the Las Vegas Strip action and a tittle bit better tasting sushi than average."}
{"text":"The food is fresh and the staff is friendly.  Great portions for the sushi and pizzas for Happy Hour.  A must if you're in the area!  Don't forget to try the fried pork & shrimp fried rice....YUM!"}
{"text":"Kona is one of my favorite places to go for sake bombs! They have a really great happy hour menu. I usually get the cheeseburger sliders or the chicken and shrimp lettuce wraps.  I have been going to Kona for over a year now and I have never had a bad experience.Everyone there is super nice. So overall I would recommend Kona to anyone!"}
{"text":"Gouda fondue and the Cuban sandwich was amazing. The potstickers were huge. Others didn't enjoy the California roll and burger that much but the rest we were pleased. Service was great. Will return."}
{"text":"My family was on vacation in Arizona, and we decided to go here. The waiter we had was a little slow, and it took a while to get our appetizer and food. When it came it was ok, not the best sushi but not the worst sushi. The Alaska roll was a little too fishy, but the Salmon Nigiri was really good! The Tempura roll was pretty good. I didn't really like the coconut shrimp roll, it sounded good but it was a little crazy tasting... macadamia nuts, mango, coconut shrimp, all in one roll! Idk..."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner and was very pleasantly surprised!!    Didn't know what to expect as far as food but we found something for everyone.    The atmosphere was nice inside, our server was quick and professional.   We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Food was good, but do not come on a Saturday at 1pm and sit on the outdoor patio. Only sit if you have a bunch of hours to kill. Came here and it took forever for a server to even give us menu's. I typically like Kona Grill and enjoy the food, but woah this service!   Happy hour is always a great deal but have to downgrade on this review particularly for the serving issue."}
{"text":"We try to stop at this Kona in Chandler Fashion Center every time we go to Chandler. It is one of our favorite happy hour places. The past few times we have been there, we were lucky enough to have a server named Grace. She made us feel like VIP's even though they were very busy with a waiting line. They are very lucky to have her. The managers always stop by our table when we are there to make sure that we are satisfied with everything. You can not go wrong by stopping here for happy hour or dinner."}
{"text":"I love Kona Grill!!! Great happy hour and lots of options. You can sit downstairs in the dining area or grab a seat at the sushi bar. The servers are super sweet especially McKenna, Stephanie, Eric and Josh! I'm biased but they are amazing! If you go upstairs (3-7) week days and different hours on weekends, that's where happy hour is served. If you sit at the bar Brett and Russ will keep you company. I recommend almost everything there. Appetizers are great like the avocado egg roll or chicken satay (sub out the slaw) for pineapple pork rice.. Hm the cosmos are sweet.. I could ramble on. If you feel like a sandwich I enjoy the avocado chicken club. If you want a salad you must order the oriental chicken salad!! It's delish!! Lastly, if you are there for dinner the sea bass is fishy but it's a favorite of mine or pork tenderloin. Haha I know this whole menu but overall if you are a first timer at Kona, you will have lots of options. The menu is half sushi and half American based food with a style of Caribbean. I love Kona obviously! :)"}
{"text":"I have always came to place since I was in 7th grade. It has not looked so disgusting this past year than any other. The bathroom grose. And a a lady that's a big deal. It's disgusting .no widows cleans. Dial as the soap and windows filthy . Trays cans are full ."}
{"text":"I went back and forth between three and four stars for a while -- I went with three because I don't feel like the meal or restaurant will be memorable in any way.  I came here for a late business lunch on a Friday afternoon.  It was a lovely restaurant.  The crowd had thinned out a little bit and hadn't yet started with the \"happy hour\" crowd, so it was overall a pleasant experience.  The food was fine.  It was tasty and plentiful.  I had shrimp pad Thai, which I always enjoy no matter where I am.  It had a touch of spice to it, but nothing to shy away from.  They were generous with the shrimp - which I REALLY appreciate.  I felt like I was getting good bang for my buck.    One of my co-workers had the chicken pad Thai, which he enjoyed a lot, the other had the miso sea bass -- which he says is one of his favorite dishes at any restaurant.    However, at the end of the day, Kona Grill is a chain.  It feels and tastes like a chain.  Everything is very generic.  The food was good, but not great.  It didn't feel daring or creative in any way.  Granted, I had pad Thai; maybe if I'd tried something else, I might have thought different, but a lot of the dishes looked like they'd be too heavy for midday.    The service was also fine.  The servers were attentive and friendly, but I didn't feel like anyone went the extra mile.    Overall, it was good.  I might go back again, but I don't know that I'd be disappointed if I didn't."}
{"text":"This place was awesome!  I couldnt believe their happy hour was still going until 7 on a friday night, but it was and i got to try a big varierty of stuff, which i loved.  I walked in super hung over, and was in despeeate need to rehydrate.  The server, Jonathon was outstanding.  He gave great service. He recommended the voodoo roll to me, which turned out to be one of my favorite sushi rolls I have ever had.  Highly recommend this place, and it isn't too pricy like some of the other stuff around town."}
{"text":"Delicious.. a little dressier... felt a little under dressed since we were in shorts and Ts... but the welcomed us and made us feel comfortable anyway. The food was delicious and Nik was extraordinary! Very friendly and just a really enjoyable evening... very beautiful interior... the sushi bar was beautiful and the decorating and ambiance was delightful!"}
{"text":"We have been going to Kona for years and even after their renovations, the food stayed consistently well prepared and good tasting. Whatever we order had been fresh tasting and comes with a variety of balanced flavors. Weather it's a late or all day happy hour Sunday, Konami is a great place to hang out."}
{"text":"I visited this location in Las Vegas at the Fashion Show Mall and it was just superb. The key lime cheesecake is to die for!"}
{"text":"Today's lunch was my first time at Kona Grill... the itself place was decent, the food pretty good, and the service lacking.   Ambiance: It was a pretty day and we sat on the patio. The mall, as usual, is hell to park at. I definitely recommend not wasting your time in the upper lots. Go park underneath... you'll thank me when your car isn't 130 degrees after your meal. The place itself is designed to be kind of cool and modern... it had a nice vibe when we walked in, but beware that if you sit outside, you'll have a lot of road noise.  The Service: Here's where you're losing a star, Kona. Our waitress was disinterested, annoyed and came off very rude to both my coworker and I. Truly, the most accurate word in that description was \"annoyed\" - the entire time. I asked a question regarding the components of a salad, and there was an implied, but unstated \"you moron...\" at the end of her response. Like, that's the only way I can explain this girl's attitude. Totally unpleasant. And especially after we'd ordered, she was very slow, taking about 10 minutes after we'd had our plates taken to bring us our checks. (For what it's worth, I've been a waitress too. I'm not just giving this girl a hard time for no reason. She had an attitude going on and made it quite plain she didn't care to be there.)  More on the ambiance: While we waited for our checks, a lady was seated directly next to us, smoking like a chimney and blowing her smoke out at eye level, straight at our table, which was both rude and annoying. There was a lot of seating available, including several tables with no one next to them. I recognize that that's the hazard of eating on the patio, but this was pretty disgusting.... Though I acknowledge that not much may be done there. Just something to be aware of if you sit outside.  The Meal: The food was much better than I was expecting, and I really enjoyed my salad. The shrimp was great, and the dressing wasn't too heavy. My coworker had a few sushi rolls that she enjoyed, and we were satisfied with the quality. The gentleman who brought out my food was much more courteous.  The value: Another lost star. My meal, which was water and a salad, came out to around $19 with tip. For a salad, that's ridiculous!! I'll definitely head around the corner to Chop Shop for a better meal at a cheaper price with much kinder service next time."}
{"text":"Service was great and waitress was great!  We arrived at 2:30 and she let us know happy hour was at 3.  She took our order and put it in right at 3 so we would receive the deals!   Food tastes great and ingredients taste fresh.  Always packed for dinner and rightfully so.  Check the Gilbert location at Santan mall out!"}
{"text":"We met with a couple friends here planning to order on the happy hour menu and we're sitting in a booth in the dining area. Apparently, the happy hour menu is ONLY if you are sitting in the bar. That is ridiculous. My husband and I shared the sliders and a Margarita pizza and we were not impressed. The fries were super salty and garlicky. Did I mention salt overload? Ew. And the burgers had no flavor and were just dry and bland. They were larger for sliders but they only give you two. The pizza was also very tasteless and soggy- probably from the heaped on balsamic. The server was quite pushy trying to get us to order when we were just hanging out and still reading over the menu considering we hadn't seen our friends in a month or so... Sorry for trying to enjoy our evening! However, the server was pretty prompt with refills of water... though the alcoholic drinks were slow to come- but maybe this was the bar's fault. The overall set up was comfortable and it was decent surroundings. I wouldn't go back personally though."}
{"text":"Love kona they're always a favorite. The remodel is very nice and way better than the outdated previous look of the restaurant. I love the sushi here even though it can be a little too room temperature for my liking mostly. The upstairs bar section is LIT"}
{"text":"What's up with the consistent bad service reviews on here? Came to this location for the first time. Granted it was a Friday night about 7:30 but there was an air of rudeness from the hostess stand until the end. Waited over 10 minutes to be greeted and, as hubby got up to ask for someone, a server came by and asked if he could help us even though he wasn't our server (he noticed us sitting there after he had greeted two of his new tables). He was nice enough to ask for our drink order. When our server came over, she didn't express any apology and seemed frazzled. My hubby and I have been in the industry for many years so we can always understand a busy night but usually you see your server working hard around you. Ours was nowhere to be seen (and didn't seem to be in another section since you can see the whole restaurant), so it left us and other tables around us with empty drinks and annoyed faces. I was starving so when my pad Thai came with shrimp (which is an up charge that I did not ask for and simply ordered \"pad Thai\") I did not send it back. My hubby is allergic to shrimp so he didn't get to try and as planned since it didn't come with the chicken I had wanted. And, of course, it was charged that way on the bill so not the kitchen's fault. Server just adding up charges or simple mistake? I don't know. With two kids it wasn't worth the extra dollar to complain at this point. I just wants to eat and get out. I did think the pad Thai had good flavor and my husband enjoyed his steak.   The true kicker to the end was, as we were exiting, our server that we could never see was just up front chatting to the 2 hostesses in what you could tell was casual conversation. I could not help but give her a state and roll my eyes. I have not been annoyed by going out to eat in so long and she really ruined it for me. So much for going to a new place and trying to give High St a chance as we live in the area and typically go to Desert Ridge instead. Should have just headed back to our usual spots...."}
{"text":"Went on a team lunch last week, and service was a pretty good.. I had the Hawaiian Ribeye, which was delicious.. I saw the burgers some other teammates had, very tempting.. We ordered dessert and I took the carrot cake.. This \"slice\" was about the same size as about 2/3 or more of a cake you can get at Fry's or Safeway, very massive \"slice\"!!"}
{"text":"I like this place for drinks on the patio and even then the service is pretty slow. I don't know what it is about this place but the past three or four times I've been here I've continually noticed how long I wait for everything: original drink orders, refills, food, the check, the final bill...I'm not surprised others have voiced their disappointment with the wait as well.   Keep in mind I've never had bad service -- all of our servers have been very nice and pleasant. It just seems a little amateurish of place, like maybe this Kona Grill gives servers their first job or something.   The food is actually pretty good, even if you don't like suishi. The flatbread pizza is hit or miss: the bbq chicken is YUMMY but the pepperoni tastes like DiGiorno :( I want to come here soon and try the shrimp tempura.   One thing I do love is the atmosphere. I love the cool blue lighting and giant fish tank. It's a relaxing place to dine or drink.   This place is right by where I live so I love the fact that I can walk here for drinks at night since the only options are Mellow Mushroom and Blue Martini.   Downside: they close at 12:00AM on weekends. Lame but there is a silver lining: G]guess I should take it as a sign I'm meant to be at Sandbar, a mere $5 cab ride away in Desert Ridge."}
{"text":"Poor service the manager was unapologetic and doesn't value people's time such a disappointment. This is the second time too I've had it I'll take my business to iron chef where you get the same quality at a better price and with adequate management! Avoid going here at all cost!"}
{"text":"This was my first time coming here, and also my first time trying sushi! We started with sake and the avocado egg rolls (got them with my free appetizer for checking in! :)), which were amazing with the cilantro sauce they come with. The salmon sushi rolls were pretty good, and I really liked the pad thai we got as well."}
{"text":"If you are looking for something different Kona Grill is a must for you to check out.  The best way for me to describe it is bar food with an Asian twist.  Other than the sushi that is on the menu many of the other items have a slight Asian twist to them which makes the menu super interesting.  On top of that they have some random items that you would not expect to see on a bar menu or an Asian menu.  The decor is very modern.  As soon as you walk in you are faced with a super cool water wall.  The tables are very spaced apart for privacy and the patio is huge.  The service was a bit slow considering the restaurant was not very busy.  I noticed that the wait staff does other tasks when they are not to busy which makes them slow to attending to their tables.  I saw many helping in the kitchen.  We were their with a small group and no one has any complaints about the food.  I ordered the Jambalaya and its held up to its name.  Hearty, Spicy and just full of flavor and super filling.  Although I would love to try other items on the menu having the Jambalaya will make it a hard choice for me to try something different.  I will be returning to Kona Grill in the near future."}
{"text":"I am a little disappointed that they have changed their menu and happy hour pricing. My husband and I have loved coming here for years because it WAS the best happy hour around. Now it's right there with the rest of them. I think this will likely make the happy hour crowd dwindle, but maybe not since it lasts until 7.   We will continue to go, but not at the frequency we did before... the deal is just not there anymore, so we will visit other places."}
{"text":"Thought we would patronize Kona on their first night!  Food was mediocre, service sucked, and for extra entertainment at no extra charge, a good old catfight!  Two women were physically attacking each other at the bar, pulling hair, throwing things - the whole bit.  The three hostesses just stood by and laughed.  No one called the police.  The one female walked out and then in again and attacked the other some more.  Made for a very uncomfortable time.  Had we not gotten our food, we would have just gotten up and left.  Not a family place, by any means.  Skip it and leave it to the classy Scottsdale folk."}
{"text":"**Update** Since I posted this in Yelp, Kona Grill's District Manager has reached out to me in an act of great customer service. In an era where that's hard to find, I have to give them kudos for listening to their reviews (warts and all) and proactively working to improve relationships with diners. For the effort, I give them another star and I'd try again.   Original post: Potstickers were a disappointment in the filling. Tasted like a meatball mix. Cucumber salad was just ok and the sushi was low level. Asked for a plain salad for my kid and that wasn't done right, and her mac n cheese was lukewarm. Overall a real disappointment for $80."}
{"text":"We just hosted a baby shower at Kona Grill today and it was a great experience. I worked with Heidi, their event coordinator, and she was so professional and helpful from the start of the planning process to the end of the party today. Their staff was so attentive and did a great job. The food was so delicious and served quickly. I especially loved the tomato soup and brownie sundae. I can't say enough good things about my experience. I would highly recommend Kona Grill for hosting an event."}
{"text":"This was the first time I've ever tried a Kona Grill, and unfortunately was pretty lackluster. We came in for lunch, which was empty and very slow. While the food did have a great unique flair, my chicken sandwich seemed undercooked and not very appealing. The waitress was uncaring and didn't offer to remove it of the bill. Overall I'm sure this is a good place, but we didn't seem to get the rockstar service everyone else seemed to experience."}
{"text":"Best happy hour in the valley and always busy! We come strictly for the awesome happy hour food and my girl loves the $5 cosmos. I wish they would put some type of IPA on draft.  Now I've been here 10-20 times and the only complaint I will give is 9/10 the bartenders look completely disgruntled. They act like they hate the happy hour crowd. Both bartenders with a sour look on their face and it ABSOLUTELY KILLS THEM to ask us if we would like food or another drink. The asian girl behind the bar has ZERO personality. ZERO. This is why 4 stars instead of 5.   I will always return for the happy hour food, if you were to take that away, I would have no reason to come in here. Never have eaten lunch or dinner here."}
{"text":"You just cant beat all day happy hour on Sundays and daytime happy hour on Saturdays! This is our go-to place when we need a quality happy hour. Cheap drinks, great sushi, and lots of American-Asian-fusion appetizers. The patio is a great spot to relax with a drink too!"}
{"text":"I come here every other Wednesday (on payday) for Happy Hour and have great service every time. The HH prices are very reasonable and the food is amazing! The atmosphere is relaxed and all the bartenders are friendly. I've been satisfied every single time."}
{"text":"The \"Meeting Spot\" good food and atmosphere for business meetings and just meeting friends.  Staff is always friendly, the sushi is decent during happy hour. Its a trust worthy go-to if nothing else."}
{"text":"**update from visit on 4/4/18** happy hour ends at 6:00 now  - kind of s bummer. They do still have half price bottles of wine on Wed all night though ***************************************************  One of my new favorite happy hour spots. Happy hour goes until 7:00 and on Wed they have half price bottles of wine!  Love that!  They have a lot to choose from on their happy hour menu which is also nice. It's got a fun atmosphere and good service. Sitting on the patio when the weather is nice is an added bonus."}
{"text":"My husband and I love the happy hour menu at Kona Grill.  The food never disappoints of course the drinks are good.  Now that they have opened up more tables it's easier to take friends and family with you to enjoy a fantastic meal at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"The food was yummy but service was a little slow. It was a busy Friday night so we understood. Would recommend but make sure you're not looking for a quick bite!"}
{"text":"I love the diverse menu! So much to choose from.. I ordered a few appetizers ,,,calamari .. very flavorful, and crisp! If you like thin crust pizza, you will definitely love their seasoned flatbread pizzas! If you love poké,,, then you must try it,, I grew up eating poké... so Kona Grill knows what their doing adding this delicious island food on their menu!!! Staff was friendly,,,"}
{"text":"Okay sushi, nothing amazing. I love their calamari, it's one of my favorite renditions and the dipping sauce is good. It's great for a happy hour/reverse HH option if you're in the mood for sake bombs.   Also, half off bottles of wine on Wednesday!  I only wished they stayed open later. I'd go more often."}
{"text":"I was visiting in the Phoenix area and enjoyed Kona Grill so much the first time, we went back just a few days later!  Absolutely amazing dinner!  We enjoyed many of the appetizers and split them between a group of four.  Lobster Tuna Flatbread and BBQ Chicken Flatbread were fabulous!!!  Sparkling White Sangria was refreshing and light. The manager was delightful and we couldn't have had a better experience!  Awesome patio too!!!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan, but I'm getting really sick of the servers rounding my check up to the next dollar and not bringing me my change."}
{"text":"First time back for reverse happy hour in years, and I still really liked it.  1/2 apps and rolls. Great deal!!  he tuna on won ton crisps were quite good, the wasabi mayo was a bit over powering at times.  The Flat bred was fine, but I prefer the departed island pizzas.  The avocado egg rolls are just amazing, crisp, decadent and luxurious with the sweet dipping sauce and slaw garnish salad.  Frozen Margarita had a bit of a kick.  Over all great value and can even have some date appeal. 9pm on weeknights is a great start time for reverse as I age."}
{"text":"Very good. First time eating here, i was a very skeptical after reading a couple reviews. The group of four i came with decided to sit in the bar so we could get the happy hour. Not really my style. I typically like to sit in the dining room for my dinner. The table was small and we sat by the door where there was foot traffic. Not the restaurants fault, OURS! lol Very nice setting and atmosphere.   We started with Sangria. The red was better than sparkling for sure. The appetizers we had pot stickers, calamari and the tacos. i would seriously next time consider just coming here for appetizers and drinks. They were SOOOOO good. especially the tacos. I wouldn't change any of them.  For my main entree, i ordered the Lemon- Garlic Shrimp Pasta. My waiters recommendation. It was phenomenal. Very strong garlic flavor however. I don't mind. Garlic is awesome! My wife got the Macadamia nut chicken. I had a couple bites and i was jealous. Amazing flavor!! Shes very picky and didn't have one complaint.   The service was also very good. He was very nice and professional.   For 4 people the total bill was 105.45. We all ate an entree, 3 appetizers (happy hour), 3 sangria's, and 2 iced tea. Not bad at all for a nice evening with the in-laws!"}
{"text":"amazing food, great service, and an entertaining and comfortable atmosphere."}
{"text":"Bartender had a bit of a tude, but when he overheard us mention NO TIP he did 180 lol  Service improved and the food/drinks for happy hour were GREAT!  Would definitely return, it was packed!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan, not my favorite sushi place but dependable and reasonably priced for what you get. Service is always good, not great but good. Right now due to the remodel it's been rather dead so the service has been quick. The sushi tastes fresh and we haven't had any issues with the rolls falling apart.   The remodel looks like it's going to be very schwanky too once it's complete in November. They have some new menu items that we tried out this weekend and very delicious. I couldn't remember the name so I took a picture of the appetizer we had and also posted it.  Try it - it's actually really good!"}
{"text":"The food was good- the selection was somewhat limited on the sushi choices but overall it was a good experience. I feel like it was a tad overpriced, even for Las Vegas but we were not disappointed!"}
{"text":"Went here for happy hour and was pleasantly surprised at how good the food actually was.  We ordered 3 appetizers, and all were fresh and flavorful, not to mention a good value at half price.  Will definitely come again."}
{"text":"I LOVE Kona's happy hour. Amazing deals on great sushi rolls, and the diner can always count on fast and friendly service. I am always happy with my experience at Kona, and find myself comparing it to other sushi restaurants. None can compare to Kona. Kona is the only place that offers my cherished Skinny Cucumber Mojito, and I come here often for it. I ask for this drink at other places and am always shocked that most don't even offer a skinny option, let alone the cucumber mojito. I have dined in the Scottsdale location as well as the Cherry Creek location in Denver, and both have equivalent high marks in service and food quality."}
{"text":"The waitress provided terrible service! The dinning room was empty and she provided poor service. She focused more on the table of 3 chatty girls instead of mine. Ordered sushi and did not get soy sauce till ten minutes later. Ordered the tacos and they took over 30 min with an empty restaurant. Food is whatever. I would try something else. This isn't Hawaiian food."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and I will definitely be back! We ordered off the happy hour menu which was great. Drinks start off at $4.50, with a variety of mix drinks, sangria's, and wines.  There's a food menu as well with sushi, lettuce wraps, and sandwiches. The ambiance was great we decided to eat upstairs since there was a big group of us. The waiter was amazing, and understanding. I wish I could've remembered his name but he was very polite and fast. We were able to the games, and socialize.  The food was awesome, and so we're the drinks."}
{"text":"Came here while in town on work because it was closeby and had some TVs to watch the olympics. It was not too busy and service was good - one weird thing I thought was how it has half a sushi menu and half an American menu. Because of that I didn't trust to get the sushi, hah!  I ordered the pulled pork sliders which actually were really good. We also ordered the shrimp tempura as an appetizer but it came out the same time as our food and also they were not good at all - more like little mini fried shrimps instead of actual shrimp tempura, and had a weird taste. We each tried one or two and didn't eat any of the rest.  Easily accessible place but probably wouldn't come here again if I lived in the area unless it was for the bar or some snacks (although I don't so that won't happen anyway)"}
{"text":"Amazing happy hour. I love the voodoo roll and flatbread. Drink specials are not the best but they added Moscow mules. Also reserve happy hour 9-11pm"}
{"text":"Came in yesterday with a friend. Food came out quick and the girl taking care of us upstairs was really sweet. Bread pudding was a little off tasting but everything else was good. Love the all day happy hour. It's a great deal."}
{"text":"Came here on a whim. My girlfriend and I were looking for a place to eat lunch, remembering hearing only good things we decided to come here to Kona Grill.  We were surprised to see a sushi bar in the restaurant but I guess it's kinda normal it being sort of a \"fancier\" Hawaiian themed restaurant lol  ..anyway we tried their mules, London and Kentucky, they were very well made and very tasty I got the Cuban sandwich, which was so tender and full of flavor.  The sweet potato fries were perfect, slightly sweet with a crisp!!  We also got the chicken avocado club which was exceptional as well  oh and the hand made taro chips that came with it was too good too!! .. As for an appetizer we started it with the fried calamari which was pretty standard but delicious none the less   It was a definitely good experience and a relaxed atmosphere with friendly service.  Will keep this place in mind the next time we are in the area"}
{"text":"Great place for dinner with friends.   Really good food but a little chainy/commercial."}
{"text":"Happy Hour all day Sunday?! Well, don't mind if I do!!  HH is only valid at the bar and also at the patio. It is pretty spacious. The place was pretty busy and we were still able to find a seat outside. It was a nice, cool day so being outside wasn't torturous.   Started off with White Sake Sangria ($6.50) which was the best sake infused sangria I have ever had. I've had a few sake sangrias before where the sake overpowered the drink but this one was the perfect blend. Also got a Margarita on the rocks ($4.75).  For foods: Cheeseburger Sliders ($6)- I thought were pretty tasteful. Got it as medium which was cooked perfect. One thing that was different was they put cucumbers instead of pickles which I loved because I loath pickles! Good amount for the price.  Avocado Egg Rolls-(half off about $5)- I am a avocado lover so this was heaven in my mouth. It came with a honey cilantro dipping sauce. yum!  Shrimp & Chicken Wraps- ($6)- Lots of flavors in your mouth. i really liked it. The portion was just right. The right amount of lettuce and comes with a cucumber salad which was pretty delish.  Philly Roll (half off about $3)- Sushi wasn't too good. The ratio of rice was pretty off. Not enough fish in it. If you want to eat sushi, I suggest to go somewhere else for it.  Service was good. Natalie came by and checked on us at the right times. Food came out in a reasonable time. Our table was a little sticky but other than that I will probably be back again."}
{"text":"Nice happy hour spot; good deals on food. I like that HH goes until 7pm. We had nice quick service and our meals were very good. They have a great patio year round that is covered and has fans for summer and heaters for winter. Good meet-up spot with a group of friends."}
{"text":"I love coming here with big parties during the happy hour. They also have a patio to sit at during the happy hour. Of course, you have to be 21 or over.  Their sake bombs are great! Put that along with half price sushi and you get a fantastic happy hour!   They also have great prices on their appetizers! In terms of price, it is similar to any other happy hour in town, but the environment is what makes this place a must try during the happy hour or reverse happy hour!"}
{"text":"Fantastic happy hour!!! Also a great spot for dinner and drinks with friends! Went in there with a huge group on a Wednesday and they were very accommodating and nothing was skipped or forgotten, even though they don't take reservations call and let them Know so they so they are prepared. They took very good care of us and were polite and happy at the same time! Highly recommended spot great food great staff great atmosphere"}
{"text":"This place is all about making profit for the corporation and nothing to do with quality of food any more! The food is just flat out terrible! The portions are small as well! The restrooms and restaurant is filthy dirty! Dont waste your time or money here!"}
{"text":"I came to have lunch with my kids. Immediately walking in to th dining area, I felt how warm it was and contemplated sitting in the happy hour area to maybe catch misters or a breeze. I chose to stay inside hoping it would cool down. My server greeted me minimally. She had that lazy walk where she looks like she really didn't want to be there. That's neither here nor there as long as I get my food. I literally ordered to kid's meals, and a sushi roll & appetizer. I waited a full 40 minutes before we were served and a full 20 later minutes before my server comes to check on me. I tell her my sushi roll (which I saw sitting on the sushi bar for the last 10 minutes; i was tempted to grab it because I knew it was mine) still has not come. I was done with my calamari by then. No apologies, no credits, no acknowledging how awful service was. This is when I get upset with the concept of tipping. What am I tipping a minimum of 15% for? Won't be coming to Chandler Kona ever again. I frequent Gilbert Kona and have never had problems like this. Please get your AC checked, even the bathroom felt like a sauna."}
{"text":"Went there yesterday for happy hour. Wish they had more beer choices, but I guess I could have gone to World of beer instead. Overall sat in the bar area bear the outside. It was a little hot, but overall food was good. Music was loud for  330pm but overall great place for happy hour."}
{"text":"I use to love Kona Grill!  We decided to go today for Mother's Day and I thought it would be hit, but boy was I wrong!!  The place was not busy. The bar - YES, but the restaurant..not so much.  We ordered the calamari and it was horrible!!! The calamari had no meat! It seemed like they scraped off the bottom of the fryer and served it.  I thought it had to get better, but then we ordered our entree.  We ordered the Hawaiian Ribeye and I don't even think it was ribeye! I think a porterhouse or something, but definitely not a ribeye.  We also ordered a couple rolls of sushi which weren't bad, but my whole dining experience was already ruined.  My mom ordered their asian salad and she said it was too sweet.  The whole experience was horrible.  Our server forgot to give us soy sauce for our sushit and we waited quite a bit to get it.   Towards the end of the meal I'm thinking I just wasted $100 on garbage!  I'm going to take the survey tomorrow and hopefully it will change something. I really liked Kona Grill and I would like to return, but based on my last visit - I doubt it.  It may just be a hit or miss kind of thing and I hope that others don't have the same dining experience so don't go to this place expecting the worst.  I still have some hope for this establishment."}
{"text":"My first time dining here was yesterday for both lunch and happy hour.   For lunch I was with a large party of coworkers (table of 9). We got there at 11:30 and the restaurant was not busy just yet. The moment we walked through the door we were seated. We had a server right there to grab our drink order. He immediately returned with our drinks and took our orders. We did not order appetizers we all had entrees. Most of us had different items from the large entree and sushi menus. All nine of us were happy. Our food came out very timely we were able to order, chat and eat in less than an hour. What I noticed is the sushi was fresh, our entrees were warm and our server was on top of things. As the restaurant got busier the server remained chipper and executed top-notch service.   Happy hour right at 5pm was much busier. A friend and I sat in the bar to take advantage of the happy hour menu. Once again but with a different server we had a great experience. We both ordered vegetarian sushi rolls with appetizers. No long waiting. We were very happy.  I will be back again."}
{"text":"Been to this Kona Grill at Scottsdale Quarter Kierland 3 times & two times after being seated waited over 20 minutes for anyone to come & take our drink order, once that is done the rest of the service is fine, but that first contact from anyone takes WAY TOO LONG!! Food is very good drinks are acceptable prices are in line with other places, restaurant is clean & well organized for the customers, not sure we will go back to this Kona location, never had an issue with the other locations Desert Ridge and Fashion Square"}
{"text":"Awesome environment! The Bar is quick and you have the choice to sit at a sushi bar as well! We tried so many things- that happy hour menu is perfect! The sliders were awesome, so was the beef bulgogi tacos, which were light and delicious. The avocado egg rolls are definitely avocado filled, loved them."}
{"text":"Our experience was horrible! We had the waiter who was just over the top like a bad car salesman. He took our order and then our Food never came until my Husband got up and asked for the check. I watched the waiter run around talking to staff and being to familiar with his tables. He was placing his hands on us like he knew us. The food was fair. We will never go back again."}
{"text":"This place is decent - we came here for a work dinner when we were in town. The ambiance is fun - pop Asian music playing in the background, sports on every TV screen, and walls that are basically large blue lava lamps!   They have a decent sushi menu! Unfortunately I cant comment on that much since I'm not a big seafood person. I ordered the macademia nut chicken. It was tasty, but a HUGE portion with 2 very large pieces of boneless chicken. I was only able to finish one!  In drinks I got the blackberry ginger soda, and I think that was my favorite part of the restaurant meal!! It was SO SO good, and I didn't want it to end. Sigh."}
{"text":"Do not eat the sushi here it is gross!!! I will never go back! Save your money! It tastes like cat food!"}
{"text":"Perfect Pairings menu is a great value! Awesome spinach salad and 2 sushi rolls for $9? Very good quality!"}
{"text":"I went to the Kona Grill in Chandler Mall during happy hour, and for $3.50 I got a 8-roll Philly sushi that tasted decent. More than the food, though, the atmosphere and decoration of the restaurant was definitely top-notch. I sat outside in the patio, but the server was amazingly attentive, checking in once every while to see if we needed anything and filling our water. My friend and I was satisfied with the service and the vibe of the restaurant. Would recommend to other people, and would go again."}
{"text":"Kona Grill is a beautiful place but you definitely pay for the scenery in the cost of their meals. I ordered their chicken & broccoli stir-fry and when it came out I was unimpressed with the amount I got for $15. There was about a cup of rice & about 2 cups of stir-fry. Lucky for me we had a large party there so I was able to scrounge some food from my family but that didn't make things any better. My cousin had a steak that was average. My daughter had a kids cheeseburger that was actually pretty good. The other kids had the flatbread pizza which was very greasy and didn't really have much taste. Out of all the little samples of everyone else's plate that I ate, I just wasn't impressed. Simply put, I just don't like to eat here. Hopefully next time it's an option I can convince my family to go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Had dinner here on a whim. It looked like we came on a busy Saturday night but we were seated promptly. I just wish the hostess could've greeted us with a nicer attitude instead of a nonchalant one. Other than that I was glad she gave us a booth because coincidentally seated in the booth behind is was my bf's college friend.   Once seated, our waitress who had her blonde hair braided to the side asked us for our drink orders. She was very nice, attentive, and perky. After getting our drinks our waitress gave us a few min then took our dinner orders. I had the truffle lobster mac n cheese and bf had medium steak.   The food was amazing! My mac n cheese was one of the best I've ever had. Bf loved his meal, and that's a big compliment because he knows a lot about food. However, the pineapple on his steak was a bit sour. Other than that we really enjoyed our meal.  A few things I really like about the place is their decor. The contemporary interior made for a comfortable dinning experience.The aquarium was nice. The TVs add a nice touch to the place too. The booths are very comfortable. Kudos to the owners :)  A few other things they could improve on is their service. Our server obviously did not know how to open and serve a bottle of wine correctly. I work as a hostess at a restaurant in the strip and their hostess could use a lecture about good service. Other that those little things the restaurant is a really nice place to eat and hang out. =D"}
{"text":"Stopped in around 3pm with a girlfriend thinking that we could eat a late lunch here. We sat down and our server totally forgot about us. We could see him chatting up the table outside and he never returned. We already had our water and iced tea but since my friend and I were starving, we had grown extremely impatient. I mean this place had only about 4 tables going at that time and a lot of idle servers - which really added to our annoyance. We called over another waitress, paid for our drinks and left. I would give this place 0 stars if I could, since I didn't even get to eat."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend to watch the Final Four game, Loyola vs Michigan. They had this game going on most of the screens, with another screen playing a soccer game. It was not too busy when I went, but a few people were at the bar watching the game. They also offer free WiFi, which was great because I didn't really have reception in there.  We ordered 3 rolls to split between us two. The Atlantic roll (with tempura flakes), spicy yellowtail roll, and the rainbow roll. The rolls were good but I was still pretty hungry after. The total came out to around $40 including tip, which is decent for a restaurant on the strip. That being said, I am probably going to go to an AYCE restaurant to fulfill my hunger next time.  The server was very polite. The food was brought out quickly and waters were filled accordingly. No complaints with the service! Their bathrooms are pretty clean too."}
{"text":"Really bad service, I felt like we were being ignored. Dirty plates piled on our table, when the runner delivered our food he spilt the sauce on the table and never came back to clean it up. We could never get a drink until we waved our hands around like crazy to catch their attention.  On a better note , the food was good, once we got it."}
{"text":"GREAT Happy Hour and very friendly staff! Sushi was very tasty!"}
{"text":"I have been to 3 of the Kona Grill locations (Las Vegas, Scottsdale and San Antonio) and they all have been good. Great food and the happy hour is the best. Great place to meet people during happy hour and great drinks and food. Pretty trendy."}
{"text":"Recently ate at Kona Grill and while it was good, I had a few gripes. We went around 1:30pm and the place was not crowded at all. There were more than plenty of servers/staff for the volume of customers.... yet our sushi still took almost an hour before arriving (maybe they were short in the kitchen?). To be fair, our server did apologize for the wait, but it was just odd that it took so long. The other gripe is possibly a violation of the Arizona smoking law. I know people are allowed to smoke outside as long as they are 20 feet from the restaurant entrance/door/ventilation system/etc, but we were sitting about 10 feet from the door and had a pair of girls sit next to us puffing cigarettes the entire time we were there. Of course we were seated one table away in the direction of airflow so the cigarettes might as well have been blown at our faces. One of them seemed to be friends with the bartender so that might be why they chose the seats they did. I feel as if the staff should have asked them to move to one of the many open tables, especially the ones that were 20+ feet from the door. Anyway, the food was delicious and definitely a place I would go to again for food, however, I would have to do so by eating inside :("}
{"text":"Took my mom out to eat sushi for the first time! So glad I decided to take her here. Super lucky to have the waiter we did (last name Moon!) He was fantastic! He introduced me to fresh wasabi. He helped my mom feel totally comfortable using chopsticks with a food she'd never eaten before. And he helped with research! :) He was fast, efficient, and so friendly.  And the key lime pie's crust is to die for!"}
{"text":"I came here not even liking sushi, but I wanted to give it another try and I left absolutely in love with sushi. Fast service and the staff is very nice, great atmosphere too!"}
{"text":"Came back again for Sunday Happy Hour! Once again left stuffed and happy. Ordered the Bama roll and also tried the Voodoo and crab crunch roll! All very delicious. The voodoo has a like spicy kick to it so that one is now my favorite. The waiter we had was also super nice and friendly. Couldn't come during happy hour and not get a drink! My fiancé and I both had a margarita and that was also delightful. Thanks Again! Love this place. I uploaded some pics this time of the rolls!"}
{"text":"Kona at City North is one of my favorite spots. The happy hour is amazing... especially the all day happy hour on Sundays. The wave roll and bama rolls are amazing and only 6 bucks! Great potstickers too. Nice patio, cool vibe. Love it!"}
{"text":"Really love the newly remodeled version of this Boca Park staple. It's a great open, bright space with an abundance of outdoor seating both street side and upstairs. The happy menu is really amazing, served at the bar, or at the outdoor areas only, including a $10 lobster and seared tuna flatbread that will knock your socks off."}
{"text":"By far the best happy hour I've found. Great food and drink specials until 7p during the week. They have a great wine list and the sushi is always fresh. If you're not a sushi fan, they also have a huge selection of cooked entrees that never disappoint! The best is their upstairs patio (as long as it's not too hot out - they do have misters to help a little); great place to HH and watch a game on the big screen."}
{"text":"Poor Service - My wife and I stopped by Friday afternoon for Happy Hour. We had an hour before we needed to pick up the kids. We sat at two chairs at the bar and waited. No one said anything to us. The bartender even cashed out the person next two me and wouldn't make eye contact with me. These bartenders must think they are working a club in Vegas with their attitude. Wait until next month when the Snowbirds leave, they will be begging for business. After waiting 15 minutes, we got up and went to RA Sushi. At RA we got greeted right away. We were offered water as we looked over the menu. The food and drinks were great. We got to eat and pick up the kids on time."}
{"text":"Amazing place!!! I have never been to this location but I KNOW I will be back!! It was such a pleasant environment and our server Kristen was above and beyond what you would expect for customer service!! Her upbeat attitude and attentiveness to our table made all the difference! While the food was amazing and beat our expectations we will definitely be returning for the great customer service! Thank you again Kristen!"}
{"text":"Charlene and Raven went above and beyond to make us happy yesterday. We were unaware of wait times and why certain things were done the way they were. Because we don't work here, we can't know that the people who came in after us had a reservation. To us, it just looked like we were not valued as customers. After that, all the tables who were sat after us, got their food, paid their tabs and left before ours came out. Did they forget about us, seemingly again?   We spoke you Charlene and she explained that there was a wait time on what we had ordered. The other tables did not order sushi. The party that came in after us had a reservation. Simple misunderstanding. I think she could tell we were still put off and kind of annoyed. She took care of us and went out of her way to make us happy before we left. That's amazing service.   Raven was a fantastic waitress too. Very sincere, sweet person."}
{"text":"A friend and I decided to check out Kona Grill because it was the new kid on the block for lunch. The place is very big and well lit by the large windows. We ordered the margherita flatbread as an appetizer, and then 2 sushi rolls - the picasso roll and the voodoo roll. I also got the sake sangria as a drink. Overall, the food wasn't bad. It wasn't amazing, but it didn't suck. The price is way too high for the food. You are definitely paying for the atmosphere and the design. But if you want food worth your money and to be filled, I would suggest somewhere else. Maybe the other entrees are better, but the sushi was not that great. The Flatbread was delicious, and if I was to come back, I would get that again. However, the service was very good, and I definitely felt like the waiter took great care of us."}
{"text":"From start to finish, the consumption experience here was quite bad. The only reason it gets two stars is because my seven year old seemed to enjoy her meal and our server, Kristina, was quite pleasant.   We ordered: Atlantic roll Apple and brie flat bread Lobster Mac and cheese  The Atlantic roll came out far too fast to be anywhere near fresh. It didn't taste horrible, but it was quite obvious that they used CANNED tuna.  The flat bread tasted of nothing but burnt bread. No brie taste whatsoever. The apples were also undercooked.  The lobster Mac and cheese tasted completely bland. This is the kind of place that apparently doesn't believe in putting salt and pepper on the tables; you would think they would at least season their food correctly. The lobster was over cooked to the point of being rubbery. The pasta was cooked well passed what is proper. All around bad dining experience. Even the water tasted terrible. Had it not been for Kristina, this would be a one star restaurant."}
{"text":"I've been here many times but the last three have been going consistently downhill until tonight, which will be the last night I ever eat here. My servers name was Dennis or Luis not sure ... all I know is that he could not care less about me or the people at my table. I ordered the remaining part of my order from a different sever as he sat in the back and cussed and talked about football. Also talked about another employee being outside smoking \"dem cowboy killas\" all in front of my 5 year old who asked me what he meant. It was just classless. We felt unwelcome and unwanted. We won't return ( side note : the hostess had no goodbye or thanks for coming on the way out) adding insult to injury..."}
{"text":"Great Happy Hour specials. I love the frozen margaritas. They were perfect and their sushi was delish!"}
{"text":"Great experience at The Strip location! Typically visit the one in Boca Park, but we dined here for a birthday over the weekend and had a wonderful time. Louis was a fabulous server who really played into the birthday and made sure everyone was well taken care of. Food was great and come to the table quickly. We'll definitely be back! Thank you Louis :)"}
{"text":"I had so much fun today!! My server was amazing she cared so much for our table and also made sure that we were comfortable both while dining and after. She helped us and gave us suggestions on what to order and her suggestions were great for a table of 4 we had the tomato bisque soup, pad Thai noodles, pesto linguine, and a California roll. All of these items were super delicious and flavorful. My dining experience was memorable from the service to the food I had such a great time!! Thank you Kona"}
{"text":"Kona is usually pretty good. This location is NOT. We ordered flatbread pizza and sushi rolls. The flat bread pizza arrived and looked like it had been sitting around the kitchen for hours. The cheese was glazed over and the pepperoni was burnt and crusty. The sushi rolls we ordered were rolled in soy paper. The yellow soy paper was barely edible and difficult to chew like gristle. The rolls were not rolled tightly and every time you would pick a piece up it would fall apart. The pieces were unevenly cut, most of them too large to fit into your mouth. The coconut shrimp in the roll was burnt and clearly left in the fryer too long. Worst food we've ever had at Kona and absolutely will not be coming back to this location. Also, to-go orderers be wary, the 3 out of the 5 times we've gotten sushi to go, they've forgotten a roll, and if you call they'll tell you that you can drive back and they'll give you one. Make sure you check your food before you get in the car because they aren't going to and won't care if you didn't get all your food!!!!"}
{"text":"Love coming here for the half off sushi. The only reason they get 4 stars from me is the happy hour doesn't start until 10pm. Oh well."}
{"text":"Love coming here for the miso sake sea bass, pot stickers, lobster mac and cheese, filet mignon, and worth the drive.  Better than the strip location and great service here!"}
{"text":"Great food!  The potstickers are stuffed well.  My favorite is the sea bass with shrimp and pork  fried rice.  Another good entree is the macadamia nut chicken or the teriyaki steak.  A great side dish to share is the lobster mac and cheese!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty awful. I clearly did not remember how bad it was when I suggested it while shopping. Should have stuck to the food court. Menu is limited and expensive. Service is ridiculously slow. Flat sodas. Small portions (kids menu is a total ripoff). Asks for condiments, lemons, etc take forever. Taste of food is just meh. Bathroom is dirty with trash on floor. Lighting is awful and makes you sleepy. Expensive mistake to make while hungry. Next time, well, anything else."}
{"text":"For being in the dessert probably the best sushi around! Kyle our server was great! So attentive without being annoying. Always on top of our drinks!! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Great happy hour! Service has always been good too. Wish they had a larger patio but overall a great spot!"}
{"text":"Service: Excellent Atmosphere: Upscale, Chic, hot Food: Average Price: Expensive  Love the location, love the people, went for sushi and was satisfied but have had much better elsewhere.  Service was excellent we stayed and talked for 4 plus hours and did not feel or were expected to leave. So props for making us feel welcomed even when we overstayed it!"}
{"text":"It was ok. Food was good, decently priced."}
{"text":"Definitely a good lunch restaurant. I love their Perfect Pairings menu, any 2 for $9.50. I had the clam chowder and lunch roll combo(spicy tuna/california roll). The clam chowder was creamy and delicious, especially the smoked bacon pieces they threw in. Very filling and worth it for only $9.50. It wasn't too busy for a Thursday lunch hour and the service was fantastic."}
{"text":"This is mine and my girlfriends go to spot for lunch dates because of its convenient location in Scottsdale Quarter. The food and service has always been consistent, the atmosphere is relaxing and they have great Happy Hour specials!   Recommended Starters: Angry Edamame, Avocado Egg Rolls  Recommended Specialty Rolls: Bama Roll, Peppered Tuna Tataki Roll, Picasso Roll  Recommended Entrees: Macadamia Nut Chicken, Lemon-Garlic Shrimp Penne"}
{"text":"Come for happy hour! Some sushi, appetizers, and desserts are half price and still just as delicious. You have to sit outside, and you have to stalk the area to find a table because their happy hour is no secret. It's still worth it though. I love their shrimp tempura, california, and spicy tuna rolls the most... so if you're a novice with sushi, those are a good place to start."}
{"text":"Happy hour is great, although crowded!  The $3.50 margaritas are no joke - you get 2 of these and you're set for the night.  The $4.50 martinis however are too sweet and not that strong (tried the pomegranate and the classic cosmo) .    The happy hour food specials are great.  Good selection of $3, $4.50, $5 items.  Had a couple of their rolls (spicy tuna and CA roll - boring I know but, hey, they were 3 bucks!), had the chicken and shrimp lettuce wraps (very good) and the calamari (also very good until they got kinda cold and rubbery - but when they were hot, they were delish - especially with the spicy sauce they come with!).  Definitely a fan of this place, even though getting a table during happy hour is tricky (but not impossible).  Won't be the last time I come here for happy hour I'm sure."}
{"text":"Not a fan. Seating is pretty bad- either on the \"outdoor patio\" (freezing, very few heaters, lots of people smoking, overlooking the driveway to the mall garage with cars driving through the entire time) or inside (smells wierd, tables placed awkwardly, people walking through the mall stare at you while you're eating)...  Service was awful, super slow, at least 20 minutes before he asked to take our order...  Brought out drinks at different times (c'mon guys, there were only 2 of us...).  Maybe their staff is holding out- saving up the impressive service for Valentine's weekend?  Either way, won't be eating there again.  Ick."}
{"text":"Tried Kona Grill for the first time last night and enjoyed it.  I will say it's a little pricey for what you get..that's my only complaint but I'm finding that's fairly standard for The area.  But the flavors of the food were really good (Pad Thai tasted exactly like what I make so next time I'll order something different that I can't make at home....).  We took our family here, it's definitely a good family restaurant as it's loud and not romantic enough for a date night.  Kids meals were a good value and presented in a fun way.  Would also make a fun night out with friends.  Like the bar vibe."}
{"text":"I'm so disappointed in Kona Grill happy hour. This used to be one of my family's favorite places, but after changing management, the rolls aren't fresh and the flatbread isn't even bread. There isn't even dough in the actual flatbread-comparable to a saltine cracker. Also, the rainbow roll doesn't even have a full piece of fish to cover the top as pictured. This is actually our second roll as we cancelled our dragon roll which was decorated with a very skinny eel tail on top. This is truly so disappointing and I won't be back."}
{"text":"I wasn't expecting this restaurant to be so expensive.    Went here yesterday with the boyfriend and his grandparents for his grandmothers birthday. The waitress was attentive and kind and there wasn't a wait for a table so there aren't any complaints there.   The menu didn't really impress so I just ordered sushi and miso. His grandparents meals looked good and his grandma let me try the sauce her chicken came in and tasted great. They also ordered calamari for the table. It was very authentic calamari but the portion was pretty measly for an appetizer meant for a table. The spicy mayo sauce was to die for. The sushi was okay but not worth the price at all. If my boyfriend has to pay 22 bucks for two nigiri and one roll, I really want the sushi to wow me and don't want to just give him the rest of the rolls because I'm not satisfied. The miso soup was wonderful though.  I think I wouldn't mind trying here again if I came during lunch or happy hour. The prices were just outrageous to me. I really don't mind spending a lot for a quality meal but this place simply didn't sell me."}
{"text":"Macadamia nut chicken is awesome. Their sushi is also really good. The vibe in the restaurant is really nice.  Went for their happy hour around 10 I believe and ordered their house chardonnay and it was very good. Also ordered the lobster Mac and cheese and it was alright but I bit into some little shell and it cut into my gums a little, so i didnt eat the rest of it. Wasn't too happy about that but the server made sure to take that off the ticket with no problem so that was a plus. Second time there and I'll definitely continue to come back"}
{"text":"I had lunch with a former business associate and it was the perfect location.  I wasn't that hungry and ordered the Bulgogi Taco appetizer.  It was quite tasty.  A bit salty but Bulgogi usually is.  Instead of a traditional taco shell, it was served in an Indian Fry Bread kind of shell.  Served with a nice slaw (which could have used a little more acid but still OK).  Service and ambiance were very nice. I would recommend."}
{"text":"I have friends who luv this restaurant but I never made it in until 4/2/16 so I never saw the old decor but the new one was modern with a lot of seating and a ton of tvs in the bar and patio area- awesome for the bball we watched while eating some of the best food we've had in a while. Our waiter was awesome and friendly and recommended the dishes we ordered. Started with the calamari- yum! For dinner had the miso sea bass (melt in your mouth amazing flavor) the chicken stir fry (just right spicy and tender) and the pesto pasta (perfect texture and flavor with a little kick). Shared the passion fruit creme brûlée and practically licked the dish clean. Left with happy tummies. We'll for sure be back - a lot!"}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with Kona Grill for their sushi or fish.  I am stuck on the Sweet-Chili glazed Salmon Salad with it's delicious sesame-soy dressing!  But I did venture out to one of their desserts....the Ultimate Fudge Brownie which was amazing.  Our service was great and we were seated right away on a weeknight.  I love this place and I will be back."}
{"text":"Nice place and the food is not bad but really overpriced. The staff is very pleasant and nice atmosphere but agin, just not worth the price.   We ordered 3 rolls and a wife had a sandwich. There is very little fish on the rolls compared to other sushi places. I uploaded a pic showing how much rice and and how little fish. Like 95% rice. Blew me away that is a $13 roll? They were all like this.   Only one other sushi place I been to that gave such little fish in their rolls.   Just hard to recommend when the sushi is so ridiculously small and overpriced.   My wife's turkey and Brie was very good. Although I personally think it would be better as a hot sandwich but that is preference and she knew it was a cold sandwich when she ordered it so no mark down for that.   Only my second time here, daughter likes to go when we hit fashion square but I will talk her out of next time. Luckily not here that often."}
{"text":"Every dish was fresh and well presented... great quality of fish,  Reina was awesome...."}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I went there on Saturday and OMG it was soooo amazing! We sat at the Sushi Bar and Rene (the chef) and his guys were so professional and good! I highly recommend this place, sit at the Bar with Rene let him know Alba from San Diego recommended this spot!"}
{"text":"Hubbz took me right before they closed (we didnt know- it was last minute) but the staff was still super friendly- not all moody because we sat down a half hour before closing. We ordered quickly and the food was amazing! Happy hour wasnt bad either!   I will be returning.. but this time a lot earlier so i can enjoy my food lol"}
{"text":"Went in after the AMAZING renovation of this particular location. I drove by a couple times to try, but always so packed with people literally hanging off the balconies I decided to wait for a slightly slower evening.  So on a misty Monday night, I thought....perfect it won't be packed. And I was right!! When we walked in for dinner, the host informed us there was great happy hour in the bar. Who am I to say to to some extra happiness! Especially in sushi form!  They were right! Tons of apps were only $4 and $5. We ordered a bunch and had a great of shared snacks.   The upstairs looks like it has an awesome outdoor dining area! Can't wait to try that!!"}
{"text":"Always delicious! I love the chopped salad and my hubby gets the seared ahi on fried rice. A bit pricey ($75 for us w/ child) but the kids menu is good - delicious large portions with drink for $5."}
{"text":"If you are going to dine at Fashion Square Mall you should check out Kona Grill and sit out on the patio..if you can find a seat! I've only ordered sushi at Kona and have always been happy with the fish (again, its Arizona so fresh is hard to find). The calamari appetizer and their angry edamame are pretty yummy! I've had both good and poor service at Kona, but the mediocre wasn't bad enough to keep me away! Their happy hour has pretty awesome deals. Between their cocktails, appetizers, and sushi rolls on special you can fill up nicely without breaking your wallet. Monday- Thursday happy hour is from 3pm to 7pm and reverse happy starts at 9pm and goes until 11pm. Happy hour on Friday and Saturday is from 10pm to midnight."}
{"text":"Went in the other evening with a girl friend of mine to celebrate our girls night, was greeted kindly my the hostess and Don, the manager on Duty. We sat in Sean's section, it couldn't have gone better. The meal was amazing - oriental with salmon and we were also given our appetizer on the house. Amazing service from front and back of house, and the food was very flavorful. I will be visiting Kona every time I am in town and requesting Sean as my server!"}
{"text":"Kona grill is best known for their outdoor seating and happy hour. my favorite dishes are the avocado egg rolls and yamada roll. For drinks, the moscow Titos mule for $8 is super refreshing or kirin sake bomb.  However, sometimes the food can be inconsistent in sushi food taste and servers service, wish they would be more consistent. Had an off experience with the freshness of their tuna and had to send back because I wasnt comfortable eating fresh tuna that was brownish in color . Tuna that is fresh should be pink to red in color. Our server claimed that \"that's our tuna\" with out offering it to be remade or a substitute to order. He kinda just ignored us the rest of the meal. Its nothing personal,  but he seemed to take it personally and this service deserves 1 star rating. Another instance, I've gone and our server wasn't aware what came in one of their sushi rolls that was apparently new on the menu because it wasnt printed on their normal menu. I have dined at Kona for over to 10 years.    However. Our food runner was excellent, super professional and promptly brought us more avocado sauce in minutes delivered on a dish and napkin, very 5 star service. Wish their wait staff and sushi chefs would match."}
{"text":"This is my first time going to this particular Kona grill. I had a very pleasant experience it was a seemingly brand-new restaurant. They had happy hour all day because it was Sunday. So we indulged in Moscow mule's and the best entrée in the world, The salmon with sweet chili sauce. Not it's not just the best entrée at this restaurant it's literally the best country in the world. I'll try to duplicate this catalyst times at home and always to know if they'll. I have to leave love Kona Grill and I think once this particular Kona Grill gets all the kinks worked out it will be a five-star restaurant and a five star experience."}
{"text":"Went with a group for work.  Initially I couldn't find it (it is actually IN the mall) and then had to circle around to find parking to avoid the $6 valet.  Food was ok.  I had the kimchi chicken (I don't eat much sea food), ordered largely because one of the sides was bok choi.  I was quite disappointed when brocolini was on my plate instead.  We tried the \"salted caramel popcorn creme brulee.\"  It is as crazy as it sounds.  The caramel popcorn was very good, the creme brulee was more like a salty custard.  The server was very polite."}
{"text":"Really good happy hour. service inside is better than the patio, which I don't get since majority of ppl sit outside. Try their Sangria (red), bbq chicken flat beard and avocado tempura."}
{"text":"Kona has the best happy hour/ reverse happy hour around. The food and drink specials are amazing! I would highly recommend checking it out. The only down fall is that you can't (or at least I couldn't) find the happy hour menu online to show my group of friends when we were planning out where to go."}
{"text":"The food was pretty decent,  I was excited they put the Tuna Wonton Crisp back on the menu...  My two stars is because I ordered a Tito's on the Rocks!  The first one I didn't pay attention how it was prepared.  The second one I did.. It totally grossed me out to see my waitress grab a lemon with her bare hands out of the container.  I thought maybe she's new cause she didn't understand the concept of clearing the table before adding additional plates.   But this was not the case I saw other waitresses/waiters do the same thing....  What happen to using utensils to grab the fruits for drinks???????"}
{"text":"I have a Shellfish Allergy and was nervous about coming here, but anything for an Auntie's Birthday! I ordered the Atlantic Roll, it was tasty- Cooked Salmon, Cucumber, Spicy Aoli, and Tempura Flakes! Sorry no pics of that part- too hungry! Lol!"}
{"text":"Kona Grill is always very efficient and always gets our order right. I love the Happy Hour! I realized I was in love here one night so I have a special soft spot for Kona Grill. :)"}
{"text":"This place used to be the Bomb Happy Hour!!!  We waited an Hour for food the sushi was horrible and not fresh at all... The sliders and fries are the only thing on the menu worth it!! Uggh this place has fallen from Food and Beverage GRAcE!!! What in hell happened.. You are better off to go Yard House!!!"}
{"text":"Well. We were convinced to go back and give this place another try, and we were happy that we did. It looks as of they are under new management in the past few months and the service is back to to par as well as the food. Glad it's back up and rocking again!"}
{"text":"We have been here more than once and unfortunately have never had great service.  We watched a table put their credit card in their check presenter and have it sit there for over 7 min until someone came by and took it.    We sat at the bar and the bartenders weren't attentive to not just our drinks, but others as well.  They worked with their heads down and didn't make much eye contact with anyone sitting at the bar.    Our calamari was a little tough and our potstickers were a little overcooked, but we were so hungry we ate it regardless.  Our food has been better there in the past.    They do have a great happy hour, but be prepared to get there early if you want a table outside."}
{"text":"Restaurant was half empty, yet my service from beginning to end was incredibly slow.  I even waited about 15 minutes just for my check.  When the check finally arrived and I was waiting (again) for my card to come back and to sign off on my bill, the manager (I think) came and asked everything was, I told him the service was slow.  He chose to talk small talk about the sake flight.  He said, \"Is there anything I can do?\"  I said, \"no...I've just been waiting a long time for my check even.\"  He said, \"Mmm...sorry.\"  He just didn't care.  Very disappointing!!!"}
{"text":"We had a party of seven and were seated at a great table near the misted patio and just inside the restaurant.  The temperature was so perfect even for a summer night.  The restaurant is decorated in a cool Scottsdale vibe and once we were seated we were not disappointed the entire night. The waiter was charming and offered some great suggestions for appetizers and entrees. The smoked Gouda with apple and pretzel bites was a big hit with our group. The potstickers were ordered again because our group ate the first batch so quickly.  They were cooked perfectly and filled with delicious pork. The waiter was very attentive and kept us in the loop about when our main courses would be coming out.  At the suggestion of our waiter I ordered the sea bass.  Delicious, moist, flavorful and spectacular does only begin to describe my meal.  The pork and shrimp fried rice was a tasty side to compliment my fish.  For dessert we split the Cream brûlée and the sinful Snickers pie.  They were fabulous, and perfect for at table to share.  I am so happy that Kona Grill is located in the Quarter, I suggest that everybody head on over if you want a delicious meal, great service, and a fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"First time coming and had a great experience. Happy hour is all day on Sunday. Awesome fresh sushi for $4.75."}
{"text":"So I came here last Thursday with one of my best friends. We decided to go to Chandler mall and we were looking for somewhere to eat. We both love sushi. So I looked this place up before we came here. We got here and our waiter was nice. I got the Atlantic roll and the Houston roll. I enjoyed both so so so much. Between the two I think I liked the Houston roll more. My best friend had also gotten the Atlantic roll and something else, I don't remember. I also had a sweet tooth so I told the waiter to surprise me between the butter cake and the snicker chocolate cake and he brought out the snickers chocolate cake with ice cream. It was pretty tasty. But be aware it's hard to cut cause Oreo is what makes the base of it. But omg the crust was the best part! Yum! I would definitely come back here. Honestly I'm craving it right now. I'm so excited to go to Chandler and have a reason to eat here again  definitely a must try you guys!"}
{"text":"Gabby is a wonderful server! Every time I come in I ask to be sat in her section, and she is always super attentive. She is the reason I keep coming back. Charlene is also amazing. She makes sure that everything is going well and really cares for her servers and customers.  I came in today for a bit and Molly and Taylor were very welcoming and very nice. With the customer service here I will definitely continue to come back!"}
{"text":"5 stars for service alone. I don't remember her name, but our server was great. She had the kitchen staff split our entree for us without us even asking, and everything came out in a timely manner.  The food was delicious. We ordered the garlic shrimp penne. The sauce was creamy yet refreshingly light tasting, and both the shrimp and pasta were cooked perfectly. We also ordered a couple of rolls, which were fresh tasting.  We will definitely be back the next time we are in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I recommend Kona for their American menu but skip the sushi! I ordered a Vegas roll a long time ago and it was horrible! I vowed to never come back until my friend Danielle told me that they have other items on the menu like salads, sandwiches, pasta, and burgers. I caved in and agreed to meet her for lunch at Kona. We shared some cheese and bacon fries. I ordered chicken pesto pasta and she ordered a club sandwich. A friend met up with us while we were having lunch and they gave him a huge slice of red velvet cake for his birthday! Friendly service and great food. What more can you ask for? I am now a huge fan of Kona and I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Awesome happy hour w good deals on apps. Food was great. Had 3 dif rolls and tried a couple other things as well. Short rib tacos were the bomb. Heard they opened one in c'bus so maybe get to check them out again."}
{"text":"This was our first time here and overall our experience could've been better. The waiter was friendly although he made a few mistakes. For ex, he served our sushi first before he set out our plates. Also, it took him awhile to get our refills on water which didn't make sense being the place wasn't that busy at all. We ordered the atlantic roll, dragon roll, and las vegas roll. Food-wise, what we ordered tasted pretty good. However, prices are a bit on the high end."}
{"text":"Love their happy hour! I always come with a couple girlfriends, and we order a drink and a bunch of appetizers/sushi rolls to share. My favorites are the avocado egg rolls and calamari! Although I probably wouldn't come here for their regular menu since their prices are on the expensive side for the quality.  The patio can be a bit loud, but otherwise they have a good environment, and the service is great!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Great atmosphere, good service, and amazing food. I had the linguine and it was delicious."}
{"text":"For 10 years, Kona has been one of my favorite restaurants here in LV.  But the past three visits have been terrible.  Today was the last straw --- the prices are out of sight!  Macadamia chicken has risen to $20!!!  What the freak!!!  This would be $10-12 in most restaurants!!  $18.75 for MEATLOAF!!!!  What is going on here????  Six months ago the prices were $5 less ---who can afford these prices???  NOT US!!  And I make $ 60,000/year!!  The service was better toward tip time, of course. The food was very good, but they serve much SMALLER portions for much LARGER money!!  Lunch for two was $60 with tip!!!  You have to be a millionaire to eat here - this is not for the middle class anymore!!"}
{"text":"Our friend that lives in Vegas took us here while we were on vacation here. It was pretty good! Portions were a little small but the quality was good. I assumed there would be larger selection of fish since it's named after a place in Hawaii. Prices were a little expensive for what you get. Overall we had a great time."}
{"text":"This franchise came off for us as over-rated, and there wasn't much in the way of servings for their Hawaiian theme. They were out of their Hawaiian ribeye (ribeye, with a pineapple sauce), and I settled for a NY strip steak, which was ok, but which I could have gotten anywhere.  Wife had sea bass with Hawaiian rice (pineapples, Chinese sausage), but it was extremely salty, and server didn't  even bother to take the comment back to the chef.   Decor and dining area was very dark.  We wasted a night out for this place and in this price range, and could have eaten at scores of more interesting places.  We did get to venture out from the strip and see the developing west side (Summerlin) of Vegas though."}
{"text":"I loved this place great environment ! Amazing sushi which was delicious ! And the only reason I gave 4 stars is because the waiter wasn't that nice but other then that I love going here for the food. My birthday money was well spent here !"}
{"text":"2 strikes your out rude male host at door. Bad attitude. I understand we had no reservation. His attitude when we said we didn't have a reservation was like. How dare you show up without a reservation, quote\" let me see if I can fit you in\". Sorry bad manners and attitude. Never go back and will not recommend. This is the second time we had a bad experience at the host stand. Too many options. Remodel or not you will go down with poor training and snobby attitudes from you 16 year old staff Greeting at the door. Worst experience in all the years eating out. That's 2 times a week."}
{"text":"Very cool ambiance and great food. Happy Hour has a good selection and patio is always fun place to sit."}
{"text":"I've been going to the one in Carmel, Ind. for years and love it. Wish I could say the same for this location. Sashimi was disappointing, calamari was bland, salad was overdressed. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"It looked slow and was a good experience as i wasn't expecting compare to others. Service was very good and the food was top notch compared to other Kona's. I would go again."}
{"text":"Very happy with my experience at Kona Grill this past weekend! I had my daughters 3rd birthday party dinner hosted at Kona Grill and we received very great service from everyone! They were so patient with us (there were over 10 little kids running around) The manager and general manager and host were awesome! I would highly recommend Kona Grill !"}
{"text":"Cool environment and the patio is a great spot to hang out with friends as the weather warms up. Service is slow slow slow as they get busy but it's expected but I've seen some restaurants handle the rush well so in my eyes extremely slow service is hard to overlook. Happy hour is from 3 to 7 and on Sunday it's all day so if you're looking to save some bucks, the food and drink choices are a great bang for your buck during these times. The food is nothing special but the environment is more of the stand out star. Next time I'll just be going for drinks"}
{"text":"Ok   We used to really like Kona, but the last three times its been horrible The only reason we've gone back and third time because it's always good in Chandler what the Holy guacamole is going on here?so tonight we got a shrimp roll and the smell was so fishy had to take it off the plate with all the other rolls because it was so potent and nasty smelling.Asked for something else bartender was great said no problem 20 minutes later we asked her if it was coming. The place wasn't even busy. She was like oh my gosh hold on let me go check came back said it will be a few more minutes. We were done by that time..Our water glasses one had a old mint leaf  of stuck at the bottom and there water doesn't come with mint,and the other water had the paper from the chopsticks stuck on the inside the glass. Think I am totally done with this Kona  The last time the bathroom had no to in any stall and as dirtier the a hwy roadside gas station the manager said they were short handed and would get to it went they had time..  very sad because it truly has a great atmosphere just wish the service and food was better. Guess we will have more of a drive and go to chandler"}
{"text":"If I could give 4 1/2 stars that what I would give Kona .Pretty good food and consistent.I  like the selection of food and service its pretty good too. Keep your fingers crossed that you have Blaze as your sushi chef he is amazing we followed him from another small sushi place we worked at that was amazing when he worked there ,no longer not so good;((  he would make amazing things that went on the menu and fresher then fresh.."}
{"text":"Always a great experience. Super friendly staff and great food! Marco is our favorite server- he is funny and always spot on with recommendations!   Oh! And happy hour is awesome. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Can I give less than 1 star?  No one seems to care about Heath code regulations and not getting people sick- especially the manager!  I watched the hostess packing up my take out food, assembling the items and licking her fingers after touching my food!  Sooo disguising.  Hand washing?  Nope.  And guess what?   The manager is just as bad because she didn't care.  Naked Fish is ten times better sushi anyway."}
{"text":"Kona grill how I love your happy hour food menu! I've been a fan since 2012 when I was first introduced at the San Tan location.  Since then, I also go to chandler and this location quite often.  The chandler location is my favorite simply because the outside seating area is larger and I prefer it.  I go to this location most often because I live near by and I would highly recommend it and always always take friends here for dinner.    My top go to happy hour food items: Avocado Eggs rolls, Chicken Satay, Crab crunch roll  My other favorites are: any of the flat breads, calamari, sometimes even the sliders and honestly any of the sushi rolls.  I also love all of their sangria choices and every so often will order a sake bomber for fun."}
{"text":"Loved this place. I came here for happy hour a couple days ago and it was great! I was quite hesitant because I usually go across the street to Yardhouse's happy hour. However this place was simply amazing. I ordered the bbq pizza, mini burgers, and crab sushi for only 22 dollars. The bbq sauce was great, the quality of the burger was great, and the sushi was pretty okay. I did not like the fries, it came out stale but I will def return soon! thank you Kona Grill happy hour."}
{"text":"This new location is beautiful! The cocktail menu seems a little scaled down compared to the High Street location because they don't have the Raspberry Mojito or White Sake Sangria BUT the bartender offered to make me something off menu which was awesome. Kona's sushi is AMAZING but if you don't like sushi don't fret because they have a very large variety! My friend has a nut, shellfish and seafood allergy and the bartender and kitchen took it very serious. The chef even ran out to double check with him! Great service and great food"}
{"text":"The place is always very clean and super laid back and the staff is extremely nice!    A couple friends and I usually get together and go for happy hour which is served in the bar or the patio areas. In the summertime it's extremely hot to sit on the patio, (which is expected because it's Las Vegas) but there are misters all over. In the winter they place tall heaters on the patio to keep you warm. In the inside bar area there are a few tables placed but it can get crowded in there.  Ive had just about everything on the happy hour menu and it's all GREAT food and drinks!! The prices can range from $3-$6 and up but are well worth it.   I've came for just regular lunch and dinner which could be pricey but i love it, so it doesn't matter!"}
{"text":"Almost five stars! The sushi special not good!! It's not fresh and very simple taste... Everything else delish :)"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. My friends and I always go for their amazing happy hour. I usually get the Saki Sangria or the Cosmo. Drinks and food are all very good. I've introduced several people to this restaurant and they all got hooked. :)"}
{"text":"Great experience all around.  Our server, Antonio, was fantastic!  He gave great recommendations, was fun and kept up with us throughout the meal.  We had a tuna tower, rainbow roll, and lobster Mac and cheese.  All were delicious."}
{"text":"There are only a handful of places to eat which are still open at Scottsdale Fashion Square after a movie lets out. If you're not looking to drive/walk anywhere else, Kona Grill may do.   It was a nice evening and we were able to easily find seating on their outdoor patio. While it overlooks the street leading to the parking lot, it's OK. Having the misters on was cooling, but I have a pet peeve about mister water getting into my drinks and/or food. Who knows where that water has been?!?! While the tables and chairs were comfortable, the noise level was through the roof (and this is coming from someone who enjoys a boisterous setting!) Between the cars, a birthday celebration and the music, I could barely hear my friend sitting about two feet away.   We stopped in for a quick drink and a few apps to share. We had the California Roll (fresh!), the Potstickers (good wonton prep but undescernable filling) and the Margherita Flatbread (yummy, but a little on the sweet side with the Balsamic drizzle.) My friend's beer was cold and crisp. My Ladies Margarita was almost too alcoholic. (Proportion, people!!!)  The food portion sizes were adequate and the Reverse Happy Hour prices were attractive.  Our server was pleasant and attentive. *HE* seemed amiable enough, but I felt like I was just a number and here's why. Before the evening was over, another man in a shirt and tie who didn't identify himself asked if everything was ok and disappeared before I could finish my reply. Total time spent at the table: less than two seconds. This has \"manager completing his required stop\" all over it. There was nothing genuine about his concern, other than it seemed he got \"points\" from his employer for having asked the question. This small act can have a lasting impression. It did. Just wasn't a good one."}
{"text":"Went out the other night with the girlfriend for some sushi to celebrate a milestone.  I have been before and enjoyed it but this was a bad experience.  The very first issue was the noise level.  Way too loud, I could barely have a conversation with my GF who was sitting right next to me.  We ordered an appetizer which came pretty fast but the runner spilled the sauce as he was placing it on the table.  We ordered a few sushi rolls which took at least 30 minutes to arrive at our table. I even commented to the waitress \"Did they have to go and catch the fish?\".  She just smiled and said its coming.  The server was definitely stretched too thin and the service was lacking.  Food quality was good but the noise level, temperature in the dining room and service will prevent me from returning anytime too soon."}
{"text":"Fantastic! I'm not sure why people are complaining about the prices, that should not be a consideration when eating something so dynamic and eloquently put together.  Our sushi chefs Rogelio and Brian, elevated this experience unexpectedly!  The synergistic flavors of the Voodoo and Picasso rolls are layered and striking. There is a full flavored long finish with zest and freshness, which adds an exciting element to each fantastic bite. Our waitress Megan is an insightful member of the Kona team, and offers impeccable food and cocktail pairing knowledge. Our bartender, Lo, was creative, attentive, and prepared drinks based on our food, my picky preferences, and her astute knowledge of the fine dining industry."}
{"text":"Just tried and was really impressed with there happy hour selection this place is really nice abs price range not too bad... Even had outstanding customer service definitely will be visiting again in future"}
{"text":"First time here at Kona Grill. The service was amazing, Brandon was so helpful, friendly, and professional, Bob the manager definitely knows how to keep it perfect!!! We ordered a variety of food, all amazing!!! The tuna tower was just what I wanted....kids loved their food too...We would definitely come back again when we visit from California."}
{"text":"The service was horrible. Ordered sushi and tried to get the waiters attention for soy sauce but he was no where to be found. The food was not even sub par. Not going there ever again."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat in the city. It's a very chill and pleasant atmosphere to be in. I pretty much only come on happy hour, which is extraordinary when it comes to service, price, and consistency of the food taste. Plus i love the ability to have some great sushi rolls and a plate of cheeseburgers or Kalamari A great place to stop by whenever you're in the area."}
{"text":"The food here was horrid. I got tuna sliders, supposed to be covered in sesame. Tuna was gray and completely unseasoned. Service was great but the food was so bad it couldn't make up for it. Maybe great for drinks but that's it."}
{"text":"I have never been to Kona Grill before since I have always stereotyped restaurants in the mall to be sub-par. I went here with my Grandma because she wanted to go. I am not a big sushi fan, but the menu had many entrees that was not seafood or sushi. We ordered the avocado egg roll as a starter, and I was in heaven. It doesn't get much better than avocado in a fried egg roll with whatever that delicious green honey sauce was. YUM. I then ordered the grilled vegetable flatbread which had grilled asparagus, yellow squash, roasted red pepper, pesto, mozzarella, and balsamic vinegar. It was placed in front of me and I was sold. It tasted exactly how my imagination tasted it. I ate half of it and was stuffed, which was awesome since I got to eat the other half for dinner. From my one experience and one meal I give it 5 stars. I don't think I would try anything else there since I don't think it could get better than what I had ordered."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here for dinner after our late movie and we were seated right away. After being seated we waited for around 10 minutes and it became apparent to me someone forgot about us. I used to be a server so I am not one to complain, and we contemplated walking across the way to another restaurant. As we were about to leave a server came up to us, apologized for the miscommunication and proceeded to take our order. We weren't in a hurry so it was really no big deal at all. Though I forgot his name, I commend him for taking on our table and hustling to make sure our food and drinks came out quickly. He really took care of us. The time we had to wait for a server was made up immediately when our food and drinks were pushed out as fast as they could.  After the server dropped the check the manager came over and apologized again for the initial delay and gave us our appetizer for free. I have noticed that usually when people do not complain, they do not get anything for free or discounted so I was very surprised he did this. I am very appreciative the manager rectified the situation and made sure we were happy as we left. We understand everyone makes mistakes, and the one made here at the Kona Grill was dealt with in an efficient and productive manner. Service recovery at it's finest. Thanks again for comping the appetizer, we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Happy hour is great!  Avocado egg roll, spicy calamari.  Margaritas all 1/2 price from 1 - 5 pm!"}
{"text":"Went there for a few drinks and met up with my boyfriend and his best friend. Standing at the bar was actually more fun than being like every other lazy person there that 'had' to sit down. The noise level was okay, we did have to do a wee bit of shouting at one point. But hey, it's a bar! The female bartender was kind of slow and seemed a bit too into herself rather than taking care of guests at the bar. However, there was one guy behind the bar that made the end of our experience kind of fun. He was personable and funny. Cannot for the life of me remember his name. Thin build w/blonde hair. Said he was married I think? Anyway, kuddos to that guy! He was great!"}
{"text":"So I have been to this location several times. Here is the complete run down of the place.  Ambiance = 3 Noise level = 5 (on a scale of 1-10) Cleanliness = 4 Friendlyness of staff = 3.5 Professionality = 3 Value = 3.5 Taste of food = 3.5 Presentation of food = 3.5 Management involvement = 3.5 Overall service = 3  the only reason I come here is because it happens to be a place that my best friend really likes for whatever reason. Her and I meet up about once a month  for lunch and she always picls this place. It's not bad but it's not good. Keep up the O K service...."}
{"text":"Went to happy hour. Good food, good time. Nice wine list with $2 off per glass. Had a spicy tuna role, Picasso role and dumplings. All very tasty. Waiter was lovely, a really nice vibe. Will go there again."}
{"text":"We were invited to the Soft Opening at Kona Grill and it was Fantastic!! The atmosphere is elegant yet casual, with lots of fun dramatic visual ambience! The staff was Superb- our server Juan was wonderfully attentive & eager to assist with choices off the menu. We were treated to many options off the menu- and with a group of four we were able to explore Many!!! Everything we had was delicious, fresh and pleasantly presented! We had options off the sushi menu as well as the standard fare. Sushi was fresh and flavorful! All in all the whole experience as Fabulous!! We meet the General Manager Thomas who was super proud of the establishment and staff!! Who can blame him...they've done an Superb job with selections on the menu as well as the fine staff! Kudos Kona Grill! I will be a Regular!!"}
{"text":"Came here for a late lunch/early dinner with the family while on vacation in Phoenix to visit my parents. I got the Rainbow roll and the pot-stickers as I was craving sushi. The rainbow roll was decent but nothing to really write home about. The pot-stickers were good but again, nothing really mind-blowing. The only dish that really stood out was the margherita flatbread my mom got which was very good, I would definitely go back for that. The Snickers ice cream pie was good too but it's hard to mess up an ice cream pie with Snickers in it am I right? Service was average as well. Overall I won't be running back there anytime soon but it's a decent place to grab something if you can't decide as a family what to get as their menu is very vast and accommodating to all palates."}
{"text":"Delicious sushi and drinks.  Went off happy hour, kind of pricey."}
{"text":"I have a love/hate relationship with Kona so there is some good and some bad.  I have found that this location is not always consistent.  Even from location to location I have found that it varies.  Drinks and food at one location are not the same at another.  Even the sushi varies between them.  The atmosphere for happy hour is crowded but fun (if you an get a table in the bar).  I was sad when they took the lobster mac and cheese of the menu.  It was really good and I miss it.  When the sushi is on, it is good, but there are times when it just isn't.  We still come to Kona quite a bit as it is a good place to meet up with friends."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots to go to for Happy Hour! I love the variety from food to drinks that's available. Our server, Brittany was kind of took very good care of us. She's awesome! The General Manager, Jose, always so kind and welcoming, always goes out of his way to acknowledge us and make us feel welcome. Everything was great! My only feedback is, I wasn't a fan of the Lobster and Tuna flatbread. Very bland and not too much flavor. Other than that, Potstickers, Avocado Egg Rolls, Sushi, are always up to perfection."}
{"text":"On my last time there, we reserved the 8 top table for a birthday party and assured it would be ours.  I called over Peter who apologized because the day hostess set us up in the dining area, not the bar, in the front window.  I told Peter this was not acceptable and we want the table reserved,  Peter asked the four people occupying the 8 top and graciously picked up their tab.  Three of the four people were very gracious but one woman stayed behind and said some very rude things to me.  Finally she got up but highlighted her rudeness with her middle finger,  Both my wife and I saw that and pointed it out to Emina, our server for the night, that she flipped us off.  Later, I said to her that I would be bigger than her and pick up their tab when I found out the manager already took care of them.  Finally, were set up and our guests arrived.  Emina took great care of us and beverages started flowing.  The food was very good and we all shared plates, hence the reason why we wanted the eight top in the first place. The night was very enjoyable and the birthday party was a success,  Until..... the following Wednesday, the GM Bob called me on my cell phone and accused me of dropping the F word at the women that was rude to me.  I told him my side of the story when Bob seemingly took the women's side and accused me of bad manners.  The only part of the story he has was her side.  Of course, Bob had not interviewed all of the employees but decided to confront me first.  I told Bob that I had a witness that was by my side the whole time but he never interviewed her.  He hadn't bothered to talk to our server Emina, who could have cleared things up and he hadn't talked to the person that was with me.  After hearing all this, he said he will investigate further and get back to me.  I was so offended by his decision that I promised never to go back there.  My business partner and I entertained there every week with four or more friends and spent a great deal in the time we were customers.  Bob never called me back to tell me the results of his investigation, but again I talked to Peter who said no one actually heard me say the word at any time, but he never talked to my witness.  I told him that this defamation of character was the reason I wasn't coming back and his comment was \"If I were you, I wouldn't come back either.\"  That capped it.  The restaurant management created the problem and decided to deflect onto their customer, me!  I never got an answer and at this stage, it doesn't matter.  Stay out of this location unless you go there periodically because if you become a \"regular\" you will be treated rudely as well."}
{"text":"Have been coming here for years. Why the change? Why did new management have to come in and ruin everything? How wonderful to come here and grab a table with your friends on the patio...gone. How awesome to be able to leave work a little bit late and still have a place to go for happy hour...gone. How awesome that the restaurant would give you a complimentary appetizer if they messed up your order....gone. How great was it to be greeted by friendly hostesses and happy servers....gone. How awesome to be able to have the perfect Asian dish with the perfect margarita...gone. New management needs to be gone and we need to bring back the perfect happy hour with the awesome staff!"}
{"text":"I really hope someone monitors this from Kona.. Kona has been known to us as being a great place to go for happy hour, It's been pleasurable, great food and insanely great prices.. So, we haven't been there since they remodeled.  Gorgeous interiors!! Still trusting it was the same Kona as always we ordered our usual appetizers and drinks for happy hour.  Moscow mules were our drink of choice for the entire table.. 17 drinks total, and three dishes.  4 people.  We asked for the bill and were shocked by a couple of things.. First, there was no buzz at all.  Those Moscow mules didn't hit any of us.  ????? Very curious.. But hey ok, we had a great conversation and it's a beautiful atmosphere.  Still, where was our buzz? 2nd.. The bill $180!! Each of our happy hour drinks were $8.00!!!!! What????? and literally no buzz for anyone.  This was shocking to each of us.  So, in one fell swoop our great appreciation for Kona Grill fell, and we all felt- we can't return here because the cost $$$$$$ there was literally no liquor in our mules at all.. Just not worth it.  Bye Kona."}
{"text":"Service was good but for the food was ok . We order taco and calamari for appetizer nothing stand out . And we ordered 2 high recommended sushi roll both of them were not my fav. And we ordered lemon shrimp tast were no favor. The most good in this meal were salmon & miso sea bass"}
{"text":"Haven't been here in forever and even back then it was to relax after work with an adult beverage.  This place does not pretend to be anything it isn't. We sat at the bar had a few sushi roles, potstickers and a couple of Long Island iced teas.  Bartender super attentive (Mojito not great), food came our fast and fresh plus the people scene is interesting to watch.  All in all and easy place to pop into and enjoy a relaxed lunch on a weekend. Will for sure not wait so long to go back.  Thanks Kona!"}
{"text":"Sorry to say we had a terrible experience there this past Monday. We went to watch the Knights Stanley Cup Finals opener out on the patio. To be fair we had gone before and had a pleasant time. Not the case on Monday though. Here's a list of things gone wrong: Drunk patron bothering us and other people (bartenders kept serving him and he left and drove away) our server said he doesn't have a license and has been through at least 4 cars! They know this and still serve him??? Misters on the patio getting us and others literally soaking wet. After we repeatedly asked to have them shut off Never cleaned off empty glasses and plates from our table for 4.5 hours! Never topped off water glasses even after we asked from more ice and another glass of water! Auto flush valves in ladies bathroom didn't work. Toilets filled with TP, etc. Lock on bathroom stall broken and has been broken for at least a couple of weeks. Positive note. Food was good and was served promptly."}
{"text":"This was the best happy hour we've been to in a long time.  Not only were the food specials unbelievable (both in variety and price!), but an added bonus was that it was \"wine down Wednesday\" so we got a bottle of wine for 1/2 price!  Our server was wonderful...very attentive, happy, and provided us great insight on some of the food and drinks (he even corked the bottle for us to take home what was left).  After Wednesday night's amazing experience, I know we will be frequenting Kona Grill much more often!"}
{"text":"If I am shopping all day at the square I will stop here for sushi especially when it's happy hour. I have probably been here too many times but the sushi has never made me ill, I think that says a whole lot. The Ikura (Salmon Roe) is always fresh here, green mussels are always good here. I like that if I have my brat w me she can have pizza if she doesn't feel like sushi. I agree I probably wont go out of my way to eat here but if I am in the square I cant say no to sushi. It's not the best but its consistently pretty good! The service can be hit or miss but I have had some awesome Mojitos here they never skimp on the mint yummmm!"}
{"text":"Basically In the food court. Their sushi is very Americanized and not the best. The service was also sub par; it seemed like there wasn't much training with the wait staff. Not horrible, but I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Omg, had a gathering here for my surprise engagement. Staff was super friendly, did multiple checks, allowed my huge party to take up almost the whole upstairs without reservations. All Sunday Happy Hour, drinks were great..."}
{"text":"Amazing food and outstanding service. You must get here for happy hour. It's really worth it. Try the Picasso roll"}
{"text":"They get 2 stars for the bonehead choice to discontinue Apple and Brie Fig flatbread and kept a pepperoni.  Good thing Postinos is down the road"}
{"text":"The sushi chefs are super cool and nice! The service during happy hour is a little slow but its worth the price and quality of the sushi."}
{"text":"Tonight I went to Kona Grill with my family for happy hour and dinner. There is a bit of confusion as to whether or not we could sit at the bar on the patio and still be served by the server outside since the windows were close to the bar. We ended up waiting for a considerable amount of time.   After talking to a couple of people on the patio I went to the hostess stand and was able to get a table in the lounge for happy hour.  The manager came over to our table and was very apologetic.  It was crazy busy in there. They could probably use another server or so.  The wait for our food was longer than usual and it came at all different times.  Our server was great and you could tell she was really hustling.  The food tasted great as usual.  At the end I was able to use the coupon from yelp and the manager discounted our check because of the confusion at the beginning without me even having to ask.    It wasn't a perfect night but they did try to make it right."}
{"text":"I had not been there in years and decided to try it again. The food was really good. I had the Salmon and my wife had the asparagus salad. She raved about hers and said it was excellent. I thought it was all good, but a bit pricey for regular dinner out. With tip we paid $80."}
{"text":"Louis had amazing service such a nice guy. He also had great hair. The food is always good, you can never go wrong with the sea bass"}
{"text":"I'm revising my rating.  On the same evening I reviewed above, the waitress forgot to give me back my American Express credit card. I would have expected that since I had a conversation with the waitress while we were ordering and told her the hotel we were staying at that she might have called the hotel and left me a message indicating that the credit card was still at the restaurant. Instead I searched everywhere for the credit card the morning I was departing Phoenix. I called this restaurant from the airport and was told that indeed the restaurant had my credit card and the restaurant manager would call me.  Needless to say, I've yet to hear from the manager two days later and have had to cancel my card, all because the waitress couldn't be bothered to correct her mistake. Never again will I go to this restaurant when visiting Phoenix."}
{"text":"I've eaten here many, many times over the years and I've never had a bad meal. The fish dishes are always fresh and full of flavor, and the non-seafood dishes are great, as well. The food is also interesting. The quality is consistently high and I've brought many a picky eater here with excellent results.    The place also has a cute atmosphere despite being in the mall - the enormous, exotic fish tank is fun every time! The service also extremely pleasant and professional.  Overall, a great place!"}
{"text":"This place has been a favorite for a while - wonderful food and drinks for girls night happy hours and such.  My husband and I chose to throw our post-elopement dinner here and it was an incredibly positive experience!!  First of all, the back patio is beautiful! It's got an extra bar, tons of room, fire pits..  Our party was on a Saturday night, so they had a wonderful acoustic guitarist playing softer versions of pop songs. It added to an already lovely ambiance.  The food was delicious!!  Everyone really seemed to enjoy it, and the choices varied wildly.  My husband's and my sushi was melt-in-your mouth delicious, and they even gave us a complimentary slice of key lime pie in honor of our celebration!    Our large party of about 20 people didn't phase them a bit.  I talked to the manager beforehand and had the whole thing scheduled in minutes, plus he was gracious when I called multiple times with questions.  The servers were super nice and very attentive - no one ever had to wait for anything.  They split the check in weird ways with no issues.  All of the guests had a wonderful time, and so did we!  We were only sorry they closed the patio at 10:30.   I'd definitely recommend this location for large parties, intimate dinners and everything in between."}
{"text":"Over the years I have been here many times.  Typically the people watching is great, the food is reasonably good, service above average, and so on.  However, this time it didn't cut the mustard.  A simple thing like a ketel one tonic or grey goose tonic, which is what a friend and myself ordered, terrible.  Yes, of course we have had vodka tonics before and know what they taste like.  The tonic was either flat, cheap, or something different altogether.  It would have also been nice if they had spilled a little in the glass, maybe two fingers.  There's wasn't anything.  It was diluted piss basically.  We ordered apps and waited a long time so we cancelled and closed out.  Went across to Yard House, much better.  Even the people watching was marginal - maybe the economy or have people just gotten sick of this place."}
{"text":"Been coming here for like 10 years and I have to say it's been consistent the entire time. The latest redesign has been in effect for a few years. The interior reminds me of a beach bar just with no beach. It's upscale swank interior makes Kona a great place for date nights or just to hang out and watch sports.  The long bar serves indoor and outdoor seating and seats like 30-40 sitting and 50 or more when packed. Outdoor is awesome so is indoor seating options.   The sushi bar extends from the kitchen into the main dining area. It's a great spot to hang out at and chat up the Sushi chefs while  impressing your date with your raw fish knowledge.   The staff are knowledgeable,  local and very friendly. The prices are on the higher side, but it's worth it.  The food, appy hour prices all day Saturdays , so ordered the Dragon Roll, Calamari (very lightly breaded), and a fish taco plate with Sam Adams draft ale. Great day."}
{"text":"There is a reason I always get jambalaya.   My favorite dish they discontinued (a pesto sausage dish).  But I always liked the jambalaya too.  But I went for something different this time.  I've had their Pad Thai before.  A few years ago, I think.  I've tried most of their menu at some point.  Anyway, the Pad Thai was ok.  Not great, but adequate.  We also got a Picasso roll.  It was not my favorite.  They have some decent sushi here.  Not spectacular, but not bad.  This one just didn't do it for me.  Service was good.  Maybe next time I'll try the sea bass.  Unless I get the jambalaya again."}
{"text":"It's been two years since I updated this review. They have changed the menu some.  A lot of the same things are still here, but my favorite basil-pesto dish is gone.  They have added poke and a few other things.   Our table ordered chili (in the soup section), poke, lemon-garlic shrimp penne, and pad Thai.    The chili was good.  Without getting in to a huge debate over whether this is \"real\" chili, it was the variety with beans.  Nice flavor.  Not a lot of heat.  Bowl was a bit small, I thought.  More like a large cup than a full bowl if you ask me.  The poke was done right.  Finally a place that understands that you use cool sushi rice, not hot steaming rice(!!), as a base for poke!!  Hot rice and sashimi (raw fish) just don't go together, and Kona obviously understands that!  Give them some credit.  Bonus points there.   Pad Thai was basic but good.  Not really interesting, and perhaps a bit sweeter than it should have been.  No heat at all.   Service was above average.  Friendly, reasonably attentive (though there was one or two long absences where I'm looking around because we need someone and I'm not seeing anyone anywhere).  Questions were answered patiently, and they were helpful with seating given that I have to keep my leg up for the next several weeks.  Portion size was a little lacking, especially in the poke bowl.  The poke was really good, but really small.  They added some other stuff (like avocado) in addition to the sushi rice to try to make up for it.  But really the poke is the star and there should be more of it.  In Hawaii when you order poke that's what you get (e.g. Foodland grocery store).  No vegetables and no rice.  Just a container of poke.  Though some places there are starting to do poke bowls also.  All in all I can't quite get myself to four stars here.  If I could do 3.5 I would.  Good flavors, but not great flavors, and smaller portions all at an upscale price come up a little short for me to be a \"fan\".  Without a birthday coupon ($15) the value of this visit would have been mediocre.  The coupon really helped on the value front."}
{"text":"Love Kona Grill's Happy Hour menu. I've been to Chandler and Scottsdale and love both locations. Most sushi places I go to their HH food menu only provides deep fried dishes which I rarely order from. I usually order non-deep fried rolls because I can taste how fresh the stuff I eat. Kona Grill has wide variety of selections on their HH menu. Sake Sangria was perfect for me as I like drinks that are fruity. The Vegetable rolls were good and I can taste the freshness of the vegetables. Chicken Satay, the chicken was tender and juicy. Beef Bulgogi Tacos, beef was wrapped with a soft shell with some shredded cabbage, carrots and some other veg/plants. This will be my go to place for sure."}
{"text":"Jason M was awesome! Very attentive and made the experience an enjoyable one. Jason made sure the order was perfect, and that we were totally happy!!   We will definitely will be coming back because of Jason M!  Side note, we were here the night prior to which my fiancé left her credit card. They kept it for us and made sure it was my fiancé by checking her ID before handing it over! Great all around service!  The hostess was also super friendly and it was nice to be greeted by such a nice person after a long day of working with pricks!"}
{"text":"Went with the Cuban, which was pretty fantastic.  Service was good, restaurant was clean.  Loved the tomato bisque soup as well!"}
{"text":"Signed up for the birthday coupon.  Went today for first time as coupon expired today.  I asked about burger versus macadamia nut chicken.  Bartender who appeared to be a manager said he goes between the two but both are different.  Btw glad to see a young server but someone much older, maybe a side job as it was a Saturday.  I ordered the macadamia chicken.  So glad I did !  A wonderful dish almost like southern fried chicken with a cream sauce Japanese style which I had extra on side.  Yummy.  Also had 2 pieces of chicken and ate it all !   Its my favorite dish now after eating there for the first time !! You won't be sorry"}
{"text":"This is the place that you go to if you wanna hang with the big kids.  Feel cool. Be cool.  Each time I've gone there, I felt one degree cooler the minute I walked in.  Kona Grill has a neighborhood feel to it even though it sits at a mall.  I like sitting at the bar blindingly picking whatever looks good on the menu because you can't go wrong with it. The bartenders are attentive and friendly.  I love it when I can take the drive and stop by at Kona.  I hope this place never goes out of business."}
{"text":"Kona Grill!! My oh my where do I start? This place is absolutely going to be one of my favorite happy hour spots! I can't believe that after living in Vegas for so many years I've never tried this place! Just one of those places you always drive by and just never stop! I could kick myself for never trying it until now! Recently the weather here in Vegas has been amazing so I called my girlfriend up to go out and have some drinks but we wanted a spot that had a nice patio and seating to enjoy some sun and good cocktails! When we arrived we were greeted kindly by the hostess that informed us that happy hour is seat yourself so we picked our own table! Once we found the table we wanted we were almost immediately greeted by our friendly waitress! She made some suggestions since I was new which was a plus! I am a margarita on the rocks kind of guy and she suggested after I do that one to do one of the flavored ones! It was just as good! The crunchy roll and flatbreads on the happy hour menu were quite good as well! No complaints and service is amazing!! I will be returning for many more happy hours!"}
{"text":"First time at the newest Kona Grill in Las Vegas! I think the strip location is awesome! They décor and just overall ambiance of the place is so nice! After a grueling experience at RA Sushi Bar next door my girlfriends and I decided to go get some better drinks here! Kona Grill is known for some great cocktails! I was excited to try this location out because I am such a fan of the one located in Boca Park! When we walked up we were warmly greeted by the hostess and told that we could sit wherever we wanted! As soon as we sat we were then greeted by a couple server's actually! Told them we were just interested in some drinks and no food! No problem at all! I wish I could've remembered both server's name because they were both great! After about 3 rounds of drinks we were tapped out and ready for our check! I can't wait to return for some food one of these days especially if the service is as on point as it was just this weekend!"}
{"text":"My sister graduated from GCU and asked that we have the celebration dinner at Kona Grill. I am so happy she chose this location, with our large party of 17 plus 2 little ones, the staff was very attentive and went beyond our expectations. The food was delicious! I had the chicken stir fry and my husband the \"Cubano\" sandwich which in his words \"trumps all sandwiches\" . We will be returning when we are back in the area."}
{"text":"We have been here several times and really like the food.  Tis time we decided on just sushi and sashimi.  We had fun trying some of their specialty dishes and enjoyed all of them.  Very innovative and tasty and a fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"Living around the corner from this location has its advantages, one of them being happy hour at Kona. Food is great 99% of the time, and on the very slight off chance something was overlooked management rectifies it. Kevin, the DM, was very kind and had a great sense of humor. Myles was accommodating and very friendly. Needless to say, we love Cali rolls and a great atmosphere. :)"}
{"text":"I always thought this was kind of a Hawain place and I love that kind of thing but every time I went I ended up at the sushi happy hour.  I like sushi but it's not my favorite.  Anyway this weekend we went for diner and had some of the entrees.  Simply outstanding.  I'm like wow.  And I'm very picky. I had some Cajun dish but it was with seafood.  Which I loved. So I would recommend giving this place another try like I did and try something off the menu instead of the happy hour."}
{"text":"Sat happy hour 11am-2pm  I love Kona Grill. It's great for lunch, great for dinner, great for happy hour. I love their sushi! Especially the volcano roll.  The Macadamia chicken is a dish of heaven. Pineapple papaya marmalade mmmmmm with shoyu sauce over the mashed potatoes. It's amazing.   Drinks can't be beat, either. They are always presented beautifully.   The service was great, too."}
{"text":"Good sushi, great service and reasonable price.  We had several of their standard and larger rolls.  All were fresh and delicious.  I'm watching my carbs (boring, I know) and enjoyed their neruto rolls which are wrapped in cucumber without rice.  The menu also has a nice variety of yummy sounding cooked items so sushi haters need not fear Kona Grill.  Our server was delightful and eager /able to explain the menu to us.  The restaurant has a great vibe.  It's located in a shopping mall so it's off the strip but still lively."}
{"text":"Food was good. The service was slow and not very good. Was there during happy hour just had some appetizers and drinks. Had to chase down the server several times for service."}
{"text":"I decided to come to Kona Grill because firstly I had a birthday coupon to use and secondly I lost all my money on the slots lol.  I sat at the bar so I had a pretty good view of the restaurant it was huge inside with nice decor similar to other Kona Grills I've seen. I was greeted by the bartender who was super cool, funny, and very helpful.   So what happened was I was making fun of how none of the things on the menu went together like sushi and the chicken chili. Then the bartender shut me up when he said it's one of the best things on the menu and he eats it almost every day so naturally I had to try it to see if he was telling the truth.  I ended up ordering the chicken chili and it turns out he was not lying about that chili y'all, it was bomb! I liked that the chili was still like regular beef chili you know tomato-based & with kidney beans because sometimes with chicken chili they just use the Canelli beans and the broth is light colored. Anyway it had so much flavor and came with green onions and white cheddar on top I also got a side of sour cream because I love sour cream and the best part is it comes with three mini corn bread muffins all for $6! It's like one of the cheapest things on the menu which is crazy because it's so hearty and filling. Unbeknownst to how much the chili would feel me up I also ordered the chicken potstickers which are delicious I've had them before but they were $11 and had nothing on the value & flavor of the chili in my opinion even though they were very good too. Now I know next time I go to Kona Grill I'm for sure getting the chili."}
{"text":"I can't think of anything I would rather do than eat out--sorry husband, I'm an eater, not a lover.  Thus, I was deeply saddened that we made the mistake of choosing to eat here after running an errand at the mall.  We arrived during linner (in between lunch and dinner) so not very busy at all.  Yet, it was still 10 minutes to even get our drink order taken.  Just as we were about to leave, our sorry excuse for a server shows up.  We were very curt, not rude, with her so she must have got the point.  She now overcompensates by trying to be our BFF.  It's clear where she was at during our arrival--running her mouth to anyone who would listen.  My husband ordered a dragon roll (he said it was just okay) and she proceeds to quiz him about why he likes it because she's never tried it, and further explains she has always wanted to ask her customers that but is usually too busy.  Now the dumb ass had admitted she's not busy.  He also orders miso soup as an appetizer.  Less than five minutes into the dragon roll, his entree arrives.  No soup.  The server comes by and asks \"did you ever get your soup?\"  Yes, he ate it and the empty bowl it was so good.  She generously took the non-existent soup off our bill-no apology.  I had the macadamia nut chicken, and the server made sure to tell me what a good choice I made because that is their signature dish.  For a signature dish, it was just okay.  Chicken done nicely, but could have used a little more of the chutney.  My husband had the seared ahi (which was a little more than seared, slightly overcooked) with a sweet chili sauce that looked like either a blind person plated it or the server tripped because sauce was spilled over one side of the plate.  Server again disappeared in between my husband's plate being removed and my finishing.  I suggested we tip $4.19 so she can buy a gallon of gas to look for a new job, but we opted on a 10% tip as we have had worse.  Unlikely I will return however."}
{"text":"I was in shopping at Fashion Show mall and decided to stop by Kona Grill with my family. The food was great. I'd highly recommend the macadamia nut chicken.   The thing that really set this place apart though is our waitress Stephanie's service. She was so helpful and kind. She definitely made our dinner much more enjoyable."}
{"text":"We stopped in for a quick happy hour lunch. 1/2 priced rolls, other appetizers and $3.50 Ladies Margarita. First the sushi rolls were very good, on the small side but they were $3 so for that price they were amazing :) potstickers were good too. Now the down side to the review: the $3.50 margarita was the worst drink I have ever ordered. I didnt expect top shelf tequila but I also didn't expect it to burn a hole in my tongue either!!! When I asked waitress what kind of tequila it was she said \"I don't know I thinks it's just well tequila\" I said I'm sorry but it really bad I can't drink it. And unbelievably she said \"yea...I know.\" I canNOT believe a bar/restaurant would knowingly serve a bad drink, and this was a 1/2 price drink I would never have paid $7 for that drink!! They took the drink off the bill but seriously bad form on kona grill's part to sell crap to customers"}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere. Incredible staff. Food was okay... bill was exactly $100 for two people, which was a little steep for basically two salads and desert."}
{"text":"I really loved the atmosphere of Kona Grill. We stopped in on a Saturday afternoon while running errands on a surprisingly cool Vegas afternoon. The patio is first come first serve seating which was nice for us because we could pick wherever we wanted to sit. However, that meant that the wait staff were terribly overburdened and not as attentive as I think they may be in the indoor seating. The waiter was amazing and as helpful as he could be with the number of other tables that he had to serve. We ordered the dragon roll on happy hour special and it was one of the better dragon rolls I've had in Vegas so far. But not one of the best ever.  Additionally, we ordered the burger on special - Mauna Kea Burger - and it was phenomenally cooked. We devoured it in an instant. It comes with crispy thin fries which were very well seasoned but the portion of the fries was a little small.  I would absolutely recommend Kona Grill. It's close to us so I think this will definitely be one of our happy hour spots on a weeknight when it's cool in the Fall."}
{"text":"Find Ashley- she is awesome. Great service and amazing food.  Ashley will take great care of you and your guests. I always enjoy having a great lunch at Kona."}
{"text":"Kona Grill is one of my go to for Happy Hour with my husband and friends. My favorite is the Avocado Egg Rolls but I often get Veggie Rolls with tempura flakes and eel sauce. YUM!   But even if you just go to have a drink at the bar it has a great atmosphere for just hanging out."}
{"text":"Food and drinks are phenomenal with enough variety to please everyone!  One of the best happy hours in town with plenty of drink and food selections. The patio is great to enjoy when the weather is nice. So, whether you're looking for happy hour or a nice place to dine, this is a great choice!"}
{"text":"Food was absolutely to die for. Ordered a few different rolls of sushi and was so impressed by how fresh the fish tasted along with the ginger as well. Our server was extremely sweet and considerate. Can't remember a name but she served my table of 6 Sunday night and treated us so well. The wait time was the only downside but I say it worth the fresh DELICIOUS food and caring service!"}
{"text":"My boy skipper was amazing. Absolutely great service and very quick on drinks. Coming again!"}
{"text":"KONA Grill is back open after a 3.5 month remodel!! Same great food and staff - thanks Jonathan!! But with a WHOLE new look and second floor outside patio!! Also still doing wine down Wednesday - and today is Wednesday!!"}
{"text":"My friends and I decided to give this place a try last week. First off, very limited draft beer selection. I ordered the California roll, and my daughter had a burger. We also had the potstickers as an appetizer. I can say that the potstickers are the star of our order. They're HUGE! My California roll was just ok. My daughter's burger was greasy and her bun ended up falling apart. My friends loved the fondue and they split the Cubano sandwich which they both enjoyed. My overall impression though was \"meh\" I'd probably not actively choose to go again but should I find myself there, I'd just have appetizers as they were the faves all around."}
{"text":"First time here, huge place with patio and upstairs dining as well.  Sat quickly and was served quickly.  I started with smoked Gouda fondue with Granny Smith apples and pretzel bites, apples and cheese was different but pretzels were nice.  Johan had the satay chicken was delightful, juicy char grilled chicken, served on an Asian slaw with teriyaki and satay sauces. Next I had Kona club with fries which was nice, johan had Cuban sandwich with sweet potato fries, his had been sitting under heat lamp for a while so when delivered was not the hottest or freshest.  Johan said nothing but the manager must have noticed us discussing it and can to investigate, she apologized, replaced meal and comped both entrees. Will come back for sure, overall nice food and service."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite happy hour spots in the country.  Every time I return to AZ, this is where I start my night (and, occaaaaassionally Z Tejas next door).    The food is solid and the prices are insane.  I've got my routine:  calamari with the best tasting aioli I've ever placed in my mouth, some potstickers, and spicy tuna rolls.  Add a couple tall Kirins and some sake and I walk outta there feeling great for between $25-$30.  I've paid that much for ONE sake bomber in other parts of the country.    I've been to a half-dozen Konas across the country (New Jersey, Tampa, Dallas, Houston, Denver, Kansas City, and all the AZ locations) and this is my favorite.  Nice clientele.  The real douchey Scottsdale d-bags don't really come here.  It's a tamer crowd but attractive, clean, and fairly affluent (it IS Scottsdale and it IS next to the Scottsdale Fashion Square).  The Chandler and Gilbert locations get more of your \"let's take the quads out to the dunes in Yuma\" kinda folk so, yeah, the Scottsdale location is more my speed.    Post Script . . . please bring the tuna wasabi back."}
{"text":"Kona has one of the best happy hours in the country.  It just does.  I've been to all three locations in Arizona, as well as Dallas, Houston, Kansas City, New Jersey, and Tampa and they're all strong (except the Houston one -- it sucks -- GHE-TTOOOO!).  I can't say that I've ever really eaten in their main dining area because their happy hour menu is so good so, keep in mind, this review is solely about happy hour.  I've gotta say:  I like pretty much everything they put in front of me.  That little aioli that accompanies the calamari is one of the tastiest sauces I've ever eaten.  I could drink it with a straw and I'd be happy (after several sake bombers, I probably have).  The Maui chicken tacos are solid, the spicy tuna rolls are solid, the potstickers are good . . . even the pizzas are good.  I only wish they'd bring the tuna wasabi back to the happy hour menu.  Add a tall Kirin and sake and . . . BOOM!  No need to go anywhere else.    And the prices during happy hour (and reverse happy hour) are insane.  I've almost embarrassed to admit, I've literally gone in for lunch at 3pm (when happy hour starts) and then back for dinner at 10pm (when reverse happy hour starts).        When I'm back in AZ, I generally start any night out with a little happy hour at Kona.    I prefer the Scottsdale location as it's closer to more nightlife options than Chandler Fashion Center but the Chandler location has a much bigger patio -- it's like Hunger Games (literally) to get a table during happy hour at Kona because, duh, it's THAT good.    To all of the people whining that they can't get a seat during happy hour, find a place with weak food at high prices and I'm sure you'll be able to sit wherever you'd like."}
{"text":"We stopped by Kona Grill today for lunch mostly because we were in the area and wanted somewhere to sit and have a bite.   The Restaurant is comfortable and beautiful. We got there just after they opened so there were not a lot of customers but i suspect it was because we were there so early.   The menu has changed since the last time I ate there so it took me a while to go through the menu. Along with their regular menu, for lunch they offer 15 items and you can choose two for $8.   I selected the miso soup and the sushi combo consisting of shrimp, tuna and salmon sushi. If you are not into sushi, also on the choose two menu is an assortment of salads soups and sandwiches.   Our server was excellent and was attentive."}
{"text":"Seriously, I have always loved Kona Grill. I think the problem is not with all the Kona locations but just this one at the Chandler mall. We sat on the patio for happy hour and we could find very little happy.   I have never been a server, as I know if I tried, it would be an epic fail. I really appreciate what they do and the good ones make it look so easy, even though I know it is a very demanding job. This night we were continually ignored to the point of given the finger several times. NO, not the middle one, the I will be right with you finger. When we did get the attention of our server, he seemed irritated he had to wait on us.   I understand at happy hour they get busy but message to the management, hire more servers. People are desperately looking for jobs and what do you pay them, like $2.30 an hour?   The good news was the food was fresh and arrived quickly (they had expediters). I am happy to report the kitchen staff seems to have their act together."}
{"text":"I always hear good things about place.. but l really wasn't feeling it last night. FIrst of all the table was sticky, and I don't mean a little sticky i mean STICKY!! The soda tasted funny (the one glass I was served).. later i found out it was because they had it in a pitcher that had probably been sitting there all night with the ice melting. Our server only came back to the table one time. There was another server knelt on the ground talking to these two men at a table, it looked very unprofessional she kept coming back and kneeling down to talk to them. She was clearly flirting and tryin a lil too hard lol ;)  I would not recommend the calamari.... but the apple and pretzels with the cheese fondue was amazing!"}
{"text":"I have been to 3 of the Kona Grill locations and they all have been good. Great food and the happy hour is the best. Great place to meet people during happy hour and great drinks and food. Pretty trendy."}
{"text":"Angelica provided service that was nothing short excellent remembering the small things matter. The food is absolutely amazing here. This is the best service we have received in years."}
{"text":"I was in the mall with my sister and we needed something to eat, stat. This was nearby, and since I'd been to another location of theirs in a mall in Dallas I figured it was probably basically the same thing. It was. We were there around lunch time so we didn't partake in the happy hour specials. We each got a salad. The portions were large, just as I remembered. The caesar dressing is light and legitimate. The addition of salmon for $6 is totally worth it as the portion appeared to be more than 4oz. My draft beer was $6.50, which is a bit steep but I guess finding drinks inside the mall may be a challenge so an up charge may be warranted here. Our waiter was pretty quick and friendly. The place was almost entirely empty, but sometimes service is worse under those circumstances. Clean silverware and cloth napkins for the win!"}
{"text":"This is a great location to begin with. You have every possible store that you could think of contained in this mall, as well as Kona Grill. I love Kona's Happy Hour menu and the sushi is mighty tasty. The wine selection is ample and allows me many choices that fit my palate. Today it was David Mondavi's creation Spellbound. Spellbound was born of the idea that all life's moments can be captivating, no matter the time or place.  I kind of get that unless I'm in a FN argument with my girlfriend. However, wine does make that a little better! Today was the California Roll. I'm a wimp when it comes to the raw stuff. Anything that I can't identify visually is what I stay away from; it's like a Fear Factor thing. It was great and all of the ingredients were fresh. The soy wasabi I mixed made it killer and I even scarfed it with chop sticks in hand.  This mall is a little bit too much Biff and Erma for me. You know, the ones that think they are better than the person next to them. Ugh! Get real folks. Your friends ONLY like you because you have money. Dah... Anyway, outside of those annoying conversations in the mall walkways, this place rocks and it is a great stop anytime of the day. Oh, I think I need a wet-wipe to clean off the pretentious that stuck on me... #vino2 #vinosquared #vino2ultimate"}
{"text":"Coming to Kona Grill, I couldn't have asked for a better server than Layne. Not only is he knowledgeable, but Layne has a very joyful personality and really cared. The sushi rolls I had were tasty and you can't go wrong with any of them. I do wish that I had more room to try them all, Haha."}
{"text":"I ordered one of their signature dishes: macadamia nut chicken for lunch today and thought it was excellent.  The wait staff and décor was also very pleasant.  I would love to come here again and try their sushi!"}
{"text":"Having drinks and appetizers with a friend on Sunday night.  Avocado egg rolls were very fresh however it needed more taste/flavor.  I was expecting something like southwest egg rolls but this is not the case.  3-stars.    The margherita flatbread was very good.  5-stars.  Yum yum.  My friend ordered the 'White Russian' drink, which she said was very good.  Austin, our waiter was amazing.  Really fun and livened up the energy even more.  5-stars for service and a great time."}
{"text":"Worst of the worst as far as chicken goes. They serve what I describe as chicken gristle sopping wet in oil. I have rarely been so unable to stomach something such as this. See picture. I can't even believe this is allowed to be served eeeewwww :("}
{"text":"A few of my friends asked me to tag along to Kona's happy hour and I'm so glad I did. They have margaritas and cosmos for $5 and the Philly roll is included on the list (when it never is!!) I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a fabulous happy hour. Regular dining is great too."}
{"text":"I understand that this location is new, but waiting over an hour for entrees is unacceptable. Especially when the place is Half Empty. Our server started out nice and explained the menu to my out of town guests. After apps, he then avoided our table, it was obvious he screwed up in some way and never stopped by to explain why our food was nowhere to be found. I had to stop a manager and ask what was going on ?!? I appreciated the comp'd desserts but I will not be back to this location."}
{"text":"I love hanging out at Kona Grill and I have been going their for almost 10 years. Food is great and you can't beat happy hour. I love the patio as well. My only complaint is that the service can be over the place at times. I was there yesterday and we were not given silver wear even after the food was served . Had to ask for soy sauce couple of times before getting it . Happy hour is busy but that's not acceptable coz it has happened more than one time . All they got to do is to train the staff to pay attention to things like that and every thing will be great"}
{"text":"Just left from happy hour. Good food drinks service and all around nice experience. It lasts until 4pm. Had 2 rolls 2 appetizers and 2 drinks all for $55 including tip. Not too bad a date night!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty cute. I've only been there twice and, the first time I got sushi and friends had pizzas. All the food was good! The menu is honestly nothing special in my opinion and drinks are just basic that you could find at any bar but they're good. I will say this place has the best spicy edamame I have ever had in my life, and I've had plenty. We went somewhere else for dinner last night but I absolutely had to sit at the bar for a drink to get this edamame. Wish this place had a little more to set it apart but it's a solid place to have some food and drinks."}
{"text":"My friend and I sat at the sushi bar and met one of the sushi chefs, Damien! He was the most personal worker with the best customer service that I have come across in a sushi restaurant in a long time. I truly enjoyed my experience and my food as well. Can't wait to come back and see Damien again!"}
{"text":"Early Halloween happy hour... food was good, service was almost perfect except for dropping sushi without set up.  Passion fruit creme brulee was yummy... I'll go back.  Patio dining is a strange set up."}
{"text":"The food here is fantastic. Our services was not good at all. Had I not been there on business I would have asked for a complete comped meal or definite discount. I mentioned it to Bob(Bald guy) the manager after dinner as I didn't want anything to happen to my food. He was apologetic and wanted to do something for me and I declined. Just be careful of your server. Again, the food was AWESOME!"}
{"text":"Been here more times than I can count! Service really is not good but their happy hour prices and offerings make up for it. On sundays they have happy hour all day long in the bar area!"}
{"text":"What a disappointment. Waited 10 minutes to finally get up and walk out of this place because no one even cared to ask if we were thirsty. From the door to the host..she acted like we didn't belong. 1 rating is even too generous . Luckily there were better restaurants with better customer service nearby"}
{"text":"This was our number 1 go to twice a week for sushi happy hour...  Sushi chef Ricky always went out of his way to be funny and make us feel welcomed.   Happy hour deals are great and bringing friends to hang out far past happy hour was common...  Too bad we moved so far away now....  I'll have to stop in again soon when I am back that way!"}
{"text":"It's Kona Grill, My Sushi hangout....   Kona Grill has been my sushi hangout for years. Nice clean places with all the sushi being made in from of you while you watch if you sit at the sushi bar section.   The Chicken Chili, Caterpillar Rolls, Atlantic Rolls and Spicy Tuna Rolls are my usual order. Sometimes I go crazy and get egg rolls with avocado too which are great.   This trip in 2 nights ago we learned NOT TO TRY THE DAQURI DRINKS! It tasted like the drinks came out of a chemical bath and I thought they were supposed to be iced like everywhere else....   Our server this trip was a young dark haired guy who took care of our party of 15 table and was polite.   All in all... Kona is a good spot... Check it out at any of the locations which are all over..."}
{"text":"Great Happy Hour and Cool Spot!  I love happy hours at Kona Grill! $4.75 Atlantic Rolls and Spicy Tuna Rolls can't really be beat! Lots of other great specials too on my pictures of the happy hour menu....  This place is popping busy for a reason...  Stop by for a bite!"}
{"text":"Sushi Happy Hour Anyone???  We love the sushi specials for happy hour here. We sit at the sushi bar and watch them make our rolls... I am a big guy so I get 3-4 sushi rolls and my wife gets 1 usually and takes some of mine...  The EEL rolls are usually not on special but are my absolute favorite!  Spicy tuna are also great!  Good spot for any get together or date.   They can accommodate larger groups too!"}
{"text":"Kona Grill now offers Happy Hour on Saturday afternoon and all day Sunday. The menu has a variety of food and drink options. Our server was friendly and the service was prompt. Comfortable outdoor patio with fans and misters The cheeseburger slider 2 per order comes with lettuce, tomato, pickles and fries. The burger was cooked as ordered and very tasty. This is la large portion by Happy Hour standards and 1 sandwich was packed to go. The chicken and shrimp lettuce wraps comes with 5 large pieces of Bibb lettuce, cucumber salad, spicy vinaigrette and a large bowl of the chicken and shrimp mixture.  This also was a great meal. With a large number of menu choices we will enjoy coming back many times.  Parking close to Kona Grill in Boca Park can be a challenge. Even if you valet, some walking will be required. However the walk is still shorter than going to most hotel restaurants. Pay attention to the customer only parking signs for the neighboring stores."}
{"text":"Another place my bff Elaine introduced to me.  Two happy hours???!!!  No way... Okay but that's accomodating!  Cuz some people do work late and instead of trying to rush over from work at 6pm to make the end of the 7pm happy hour, they can rest a bit, have dinner.  Then come by at 10pm for second happy hour.  What's super cool is for a couple appetizers and two drinks each, we spent a little around $40.  In context, at the clubs along the strip, one drink can cost $20.  Here's a place with a good happy hour menu, times, location, and atmosphere.  The patio seating has mist sprays and comfy furniture if you sit along the outer parameters.  There appears to be a stone firepit too, except a lit fire isn't needed yet.  It's nice sitting outside!  Hey though their lettuce wraps were good.  Spicy and daring, and I liked the kick!  Funny thing is the lettuce wraps were an unintended order.  My bff Elaine was already there waiting for me.  When I talk texted something to her I began with \"let us\"...  My text message did not make sense at all to her when she read \"lettuce\", but she didn't question me even if the entire sentence didn't make sense.  She ordered lettuce wraps!  And now ima lettuce wrap fan :D  Well if any of you are here to visit from wherever, Kona Grill is a recommended place to start your weekend or evening for chillaxing during their happy hours.  Make it a fun one!"}
{"text":"Kona grill is a must try if you are a sushi.  Their Vegas Roll is unlike any other roll I've tried anywhere and the presentation is amazing.  Their chocolate cake dessert is fabulous and they have an amazing happy hour if you are able to get a seat in their bar area.  The atmosphere inside is perfect for a romantic dinner or a relaxed night with friends.  They also have a full menu of American food.  Their burger was just OK."}
{"text":"Happy hour is best for this place. 50% dishes. Just beware, the seating is a first come first serve basis. Food is good. We ordered garlic shrimp pizza, tuna and california roll and fried calamari."}
{"text":"Sloooooooooowest service you could ever imagine. I've been here for an hr and I still haven't received my entree.   Food is okay but to be on the strip, this wait time bananas when it's absolutely empty."}
{"text":"Kona is one of our happy hour go to spots.  The prices have gone up but still a great deal.  We usually stick to the sushi but their flatbreads are very good as well.  They always have a seasonal Sam Adams so you don't have to get Asian beer or watered down American beer.  Our staple is the Bama roll but we do stray and get the wave and spicy tuna."}
{"text":"I received a gift card  for my Birthday and wanted to try something new for our date tonight. We went out to Kona Grill with no expectations and definitely had one of the best meals of my life. Chili glazed salmon was too good to be true and everything else we ordered was unique and delicious. Couldn't be happier on an evening out with my wife.   Also a shout out to a Tyler our waiter who suggested a few items which really got us going in the right direction. Seriously amazing! Thanks again"}
{"text":"It surprises me that Kona grill doesn't have better reviews.   Their happy hours rocks!! Everything is sooooo good.  I've been here a handful of time and I always enjoy myself!  The sliders are GREAT. And the ahi tuna crisps.... Oh my GOD so good!!! I swear I get them every single time. The avocado egg rolls are a little heavy but fan-freaking-tastic.   I love all of the drinks on their happy hour specials-- especially their Cosmopolitan. They get it right every time (they must use Cointreau because it is GOOD)   You have to check out the happy hour if you haven't already... But get there early!! It's first come first serve seating and it fills up fast!"}
{"text":"I've been to Kona Grill several times for happy hour and sushi but since I got a $20 voucher to use towards an entree for my birthday I had to make a special visit to this spot. My girl and I were bored on a Thursday afternoon so we decided to head to Scottsdale for an impromptu drink!  We sat on the patio which always makes for great people watching and I ordered the ladies margarita and the sweet chili glazed salmon it came with shrimp fried rice and veggies. I made the perfect choice because everything was AHmazing! The salmon was cooked just right and I could have literally pored that sweet chili goodness over everything on the plate!  Points to our server for giving us a heads up that they were 10 min from reverse happy hour starting.  Thanks again Kona for a delish way to end my Thursday!"}
{"text":"So id give this restaurant less than 1 star if I could. Food took about an hour to come out (it was not busy at all, we were the only ones in the dining room) they dispersed the food improperly and unorganized. The servers had no idea where our apps belonged to. Server never introduced herself. Terrible experience."}
{"text":"Kona is one of my favorite places (highly recommend their happy hour if you haven't been). I've been here countless times, and this is my first review, specifically because I'd like to bring light to one of the best servers I've had. Tom is amazing. He was around every time we needed him, and has a fun personality that makes the atmosphere that much better. I'll only be returning when he's working from here on out. Thank you Tom!!"}
{"text":"They had tasty crunchy rolls, and the tataki sashimi was surprisingly good.  I walked away happy.  A fine recommendation by my sister."}
{"text":"Great lettuce wraps and the BBQ Chicken Flatbread was awesome!"}
{"text":"Cool place to gather with some friends. Excellent sea bass dinner but the portion is on the small side. Great service from the staff. All in all great hang out place."}
{"text":"I come here when in town every couple months,  always ha e the Salmon Entree,  very good,  not the same as when they opened years back,  they had an amazing sauce on it,  I am sure it is a cost thing,  you know how the great minds do that at Corp office for restaurants...  Salmon is still charred nicely,  Hawaiian Rice is good too,  veggies are decent. Great Happy Hours selections,  Friendly Staff."}
{"text":"one of many of their every growing franchise, kona has been a pleasing staple when you don't quite know what you want but know it's just something.   there's menu items for all tastes, with a heavy asian influence. tonight, i met a post-elopement wedding party. this location had a nice patio with a local guitarist. i ordered the miso salmon salad. i should have asked for the dressing on the side because although it was tasty, a little too much salad dressing. the tofu bits were coated in macadamia and the salmon was cooked just right however.   we had a big party (maybe 15?) and the service was fast and friendly. and to top it off, they split all the checks!"}
{"text":"Do not order sushi here! I would recommend the sushi to a cat i didn't like.. I believe said cat would recognize the tuna used to make the spicy tuna roll i was just served moments ago. The rest of the food is also bad we tried several items. Avoid"}
{"text":"I had an amazing time, the alcohol drinks were so good. This place is really cozy nice atmosphere, I ordered steak and it was delicious, I will come here again"}
{"text":"So really Kona! Is this what you call a sushi roll? If you don't have the skill to wrap it tight enough so that it can be picked up with chop sticks is it really still a roll? NO!! Oh and here's a clue how to cook steak, you season it before you cook it, not as you put it in the window!  Total disappointment. Will never be back!!!!"}
{"text":"Oh, Kona Grill!  What a fun place, especially during happy hour!  In fact, I rank this one of my favorite Happy Hours in the area.  I visited with a friend and got a full order of sliders with fries and huge flatbread, all for $13.50!!  That led to leftovers for both of us.  Though we could have ordered sushi, gouda fondue, lettuce wraps, tacos, and a huge assortment of drinks.  In fact, I did...on another visit!  It is a daily happy hour (3-7 PM weekdays, 11-4 Saturdays, and all day Sundays).  Plus, they have a reverse happy hour Monday through Saturday after I'm in bed.  All in all,  I've never had a bad dish at Kona Grill.  On this particular visit, we enjoyed sporting events on multiple televisions.  The service is good though there's practically been a fight (not really) trying to get a space at the bar.  I recommend making a reservation online or through Open Table (which I learned about after this visit).  There is plenty of parking throughout the High Street area whether street parking, the small lot on the north side, or the parking structure on the south side.  It's also fun to see this particular Kona Grill involved with different activities on High Street like Dish It Up, which is an event benefiting the Boys and Girls Club.  Definitely sign up for the Konavore club so that you can get your $15 gift certificate to use on your birthday each year."}
{"text":"Don't you love it when a place pleasantly surprises you with great food! Especially when you're not expecting it to be a restaurant attached to a shopping mall. This restaurant's food made me happy. The Macadamia Nut Chicken was simply terrific! Miso-sake Sea Bass was a true blessing! A great place to have dinner for anyone looking to satisfy your tastebuds. Well done Kona Grill!"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE......... wait for almost 25min FOR A BEER is ridiculous. Next round I have to order 2 3 drink at the time because every time we order drinks is 20 30min ti wait fir drinks???? Have to go to the bar and ask for a shot glass because apparently they are too busy and the bartender was very ver rude NO GOOD.... Last time I came here it was like 4 5 months ago and I remember why..... Im NEVER coming back."}
{"text":"The food is so fresh here and the service is insanely good! Holden and Emina are the best servers ever:) we always feel welcome here even when we come 30 minutes to close lol. Thanks guys for being so awesome and making our dinners so delicious and fun!"}
{"text":"There are things I love about Kona, and things that I'm not so crazy about.  First, those that I love! The macadamia nut chicken is to die for! the marmalade that they pair with it adds a surprising sweetness that stays with you (in a good way). The house salad is also very good and not boring at all.  Now for the not so great: I am extremely allergic to fish, and though I understand that Kona focuses on sushi, I wish there was more vegetarian or chicken options to choose from. Also, the service can be a bit spotty in the dining room during happy hour. The wait staff seems more interested in mingling with the guests on the patio than in doing their jobs.  Overall, a great chain to visit on this side of the country."}
{"text":"Really cool restaurant/ bar hangout spot.   Sat on the rooftop and you get a nice overlook of the area! Started off with their Moscow mules and they were not that strong so ordered a double.    Their menu is cool because they pretty much have everything. My fav was their yellowtail jalapeño. It was too die for!  The staff was very sweet and have awesome recommendations if you need any help!"}
{"text":"Ate here with my family on a busy night. We were seated near the entrance which gave us a good view of the fish tank above the sushi bar which my daughter enjoyed. I had chicken, my hubby had pad Thai noodles, my MIL had a beef sandwich, and my daughter enjoyed the adorable kid's bento box Mac & Cheese meal which included an adorable orange sliced and shaped into a bear face! The only downfalls were the loud atmosphere and dim lighting. Personally I like to be able to fully see what I am eating!  Service, staff, and food were all excellent."}
{"text":"This ugly ass talk white male bartender gave me the dirtiest look raciest ass white people think that we don't know the looks that they express don t eat here if you black"}
{"text":"I was craving sushi and I went here previously. I think the time to come is happy hour from 3-7pm. I arrived around 8pm and sat at my table for a long time before anyone ever approached me. The waitress apologized and was super nice. I guess she had been training someone and had been tied up. I ordered the coconut shrimp roll and the tempura sea bass roll. The tempura sea bas roll was really good but the rolls here fall apart very easy and they are wrapped with a yellow wrapper instead of of your green seaweed wrapper I am used to seeing. When it comes to paying full price for sushi I think there are other choices in Vegas. However if you hit the happy hour its worth it. I do enjoy sitting on the outdoor patio people watching."}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday and had the salmon. Food was great and the service was even better. The servers behind the bar are really on top of everything, attentive and friendly. Top notch service. So many places I've been to lately cut corners. Not Kona. I'll definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"I go for the appetizers but the rest of the food is good too. It's a good place to get a beer, Kirin on draft, and some good food after shopping."}
{"text":"Food and service was great until a guy confronted us about giving tip (gratuity), although I left a small tip. I personally believe that gratuity is optional and a staff shouldn't tell their guests to give this certain percent next time they eat at the restaurant. I just invited my friends to eat since I just received a $200 gift card from my friend which I used to pay. We were a party of four and it wasn't really busy at all. We were just college students and don't really have a lot of money but you guys make it seem like only the upper class people should eat at your restaurant which I think is wrong. The servers gets paid to do their jobs so then tips are not supposed to be mandatory. Gratuity, by definition, is a voluntary tip for services paid by the patron to the restaurant for services rendered; therefore, the patron should not be told to pay such a charge."}
{"text":"I had the prime rib steak sandwich because I went on a date who said the magic words \"Get whatever you want\"... honestly I had no idea the entrees were 30 dollars a piece.!! So I felt bad ordering a 30 dolla item on a first date even though he said I could have a steak if I wanted to and I sure did really want to try a steak there but I settled for the cheaper steak sandwich...I def want to go back for Sushi happy hour but I think I recall you have to be sitting on the patio for that. My sandwich was awesome and my date had pad thai which was horrible. It tasted like soy sauce with tons of garlic in it, very odd recipe but he liked it since he never had Thai before so he thought that was the normal taste...however myself being the Thai conossier was pretty shocked. They sat us in the last booth right by the hallway to the bathroom, I wasnt sure whether to say we'll just wait for another table but honestly, they should have comped us a salad or some drinks because what is more ridiculous than that espec if you are on a first date. My date loved the giant fish tank but thats so common for restaurants, it didnt really phase me but I think if you were sitting there by the sushi bar, it would be nice, there is a big rockfish in it or fan fish or whatever it might be called..I think the hostess and the manager guy with the tie is very pleasant. But there was a huge line at the mexican place across ways so I think this place prices are too high...my sandwich was 14 bucks which I could have got a good steak elsewhere for that. The french fries were quiet good that came with it. I was kind of bummed out as well that the waitress boxed my half steak sandwich but she left out those fabulous fries? Next time I have to remember to tell these people, put all of it in the box."}
{"text":"It was raining outside and the roof was leaking horribly. The manager could care less that water was dripping all over us. She would not have even stopped over if it weren't for our server. And when she did she was so rude and did not care at all that she had a major leak in the roof. I feel bad for all of the staff at Kona Grill that hard to work with her."}
{"text":"Lunch, OMG! So delicious. Shared avocado egg rolls and chili glazed salmon salad with my bestie and wished I had the whole thing to myself. Wyatt was our fun and friendly server. Haven't been here in a while but I won't stay away again."}
{"text":"My favorite happy hour in AZ!  The service is always fast and the food fits to a family.  I can always count on a quick meal that the whole family can enjoy.  The choices on the menu are spot on!  Plus they have Saki on the happy hour menu."}
{"text":"Love the food, but this location takes the customer experience to the next level. Patrick and the staff are personable and focused on making everyone feel like they are the highest priority while being super fun! We are so excited to have them here in the Quarter for team lunches and happy hours. Patrick and team make Kona our #1 choice."}
{"text":"I've never been here anytime except happy hour, but I love their happy hour! Their margaritas are what me and my girls call \"magical\". :P The portions and sizes of the happy hour food is great, too...I'd definitely recommend this place for a few drinks with your friends or for an awesome pre-gaming spot before a big night out, :D"}
{"text":"Excellent service, great food and friendly atmosphere. The kids bento is affordable and great and the salmon Caesar is delightful. Sushi is delicious as well.  The server, Paola was knowledgeable and nice."}
{"text":"Restaurants with a respectable happy hour usually get a 1-star bump and the HH at Kona Grill is one of the best in town. The menu here features dishes with pacific rim influences and an excellent sushi bar. The food is above average for a chain restaurant and service has always been on point.   What brings me in to Kona is their happy hour. Every night til closing, KF offers a wide array of sushi rolls, appetizers, flatbreads pizzas, and of course drinks and great prices. The sliders, and BBQ chicken flatbread are my personal favorites.  The sake bombs come with a large bottle of Kirin beer and a bottle of warm sake. Easily 3-4 drinks and a steal at $8. Happy Hour is only available on the massive patio and a few select tables inside by the bar. Though there are heaters, make sure you dress appropriately if you plan on dining on the patio.   As one the best late night spots in Summerlin, Kona is definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"Phenomenal happy hour. But pretty tasty and with crazy-low prices. Not the worlds greatest food, so I wouldn't be tempted to go for dinner. The Asian fusion isn't exactly mind blowing... But the sushi was surprisingly good. The calamari too. And I have to say that the service was stellar.   What makes Kona Grill is the bar and patio with big screens inside and sunshine (or heaters if necessary) outside. A really nice place to drink in the afternoon. Pun intended. Who knows when I'll be in Summerlin again, but if I am, I'll probably be here at exactly 3pm, when happy hour begins."}
{"text":"Kona grill has been one of my favorite places to eat since I moved to Vegas about a year ago. I have not always had the best service, but today was very different. Tim was our waiter and he was beyond awesome. With one of the busiest happy hours in Summerlin, sometimes it can be so busy which lessens service. Tim was prompt, friendly, and well...::awesome. I appreciate people who can be this way, even in busy times. We had a lot of questions, and he answered them all without feeling we were wasting his time. As always, great food, but today I loved my service!"}
{"text":"I am again so bummed out by the declining, low, low quality that is the current state of Kona Grill.  I ate there a few months ago and my husband and I both noticed how the quality of the food has gone down (we always got the calamari and this time it was nothing short of disgusting and rubbery, and a much smaller portion, but who cares when it's gross?).  I went again this weekend since my friends were going and they picked the spot.  I ordered a salad w/ chicken.  They didn't put dressing on it, ok that's fine, just asked my server for a side of dressing.  But the chicken was actually really disgusting.  It was rubbery and grey looking.  I couldn't even eat it.  I just picked at my salad.  I had a salad and one drink and I paid $30 with tip.  That's CRAZY!  I will for sure not willingly come to Kona Grill again.  There are WAY better, quality less expensive places.  I think you could get better quality food at McDonald's (and I never even eat McD's), and pay 1/5 of the price."}
{"text":"Overall pleased with my experience. Was on lunch, they have $10 lunch specials. Food came fast and was fresh. Barkeep did good job of keeping my glass full."}
{"text":"We had a $50 gift card which we tried to use and were told it had a zero balance. Our waiter said he would send over the manager. Instead we got the asst. manager who agreed it seemed very unlikely we had used the card in Illinois and Connecticut and then here in Vegas. But apparently he has no authority to make things right and we had to leave our info and wait who knows how long for \"corporate\" to get back to us. Clearly an exasperating experience and IF we hear from corporate we'll certainly request a cash refund vs ever trying to use a gift card there again."}
{"text":"I have frequented this place 6 times since before November, 2013 and each and every time I've been here, the service has become worse and worse.  After last night, I was compelled to write a review.  Happy hour was over at 7pm so my guest and I arrived 20 minutes prior and sat at a table in the bar area.  We watched server after server (and there seemed to be plenty of them working) pass our table and the table next to us by.  My guest finally went up to the hostess stand and asked for service so we could get menus, appetizers and drinks before the clock striked 7, end of happy hour.  The server who we hadn't seen the entire 20 minutes we had been there came up to our table. looked at his watch and said,\" oh you just missed happy hour\".  I said, ahh...no we didn't, you took 20 minutes to get to our table and we are going to get our first round of drinks and  an appetizer on happy hour prices as we intend to also have dinner here.  I won that battle.  It took almost another 25 minutes to get some chicken on a stick brought to our table (chicken satay).  I've had this every time I've been here and I was amazed at how small the pieces of chicken were, about 1 bite each, they were never this small!  We asked for dinner menus so we could look things over as we ate our chicken specks.    The server was again lost.  We had to ask someone to get him so we could order, not to mention our drinks were and had been gone log enough that we were ready for another round.  I will also mention that my white wine sangria had absolutely NO alcohol in it.  Without going into all the boring details, our food took a long time to come out of the kitchen, trying to get napkins and eating utensils delivered.  We even deliberated going over to Yard House instead for some service and dinner but opted to stay and wait it out.  Our ood finally arrived, our dishes delivered at different times but arrived nonetheless.  Food was good as usual but was dampened by the horrific service.  The \"manager\" came over and asked how things were, we told him.  He didn't seem to care.  We then watched the table next to us complain about everything to him and he spent a lot of time there and clearly comped them.  Our server did come back and mutttered under his breath that he had spoke to the manager about our service and that he was working on something to make it up to us.  The bill came, everything was on the bill, no compensation for what was an extremely long time spent just trying to have some drinks and dinner at this place with awful service!!!  There are too many other quality, service oriented restaurants in this area.  If we want to visit Kona Grill again, we are going to Scottsdale Fashion Square as the service there is much better.  They need to get a new maanger and better wait staff."}
{"text":"Kona Grill at Scottsdale Quarter is my FAVORITE bar/restaurant. Patrick and his team are over and above excellent and exceptional service. Lisa and Ian are amazing at the bar. But the new manager Anna could learn to crack a smile. Not friendly at all. Doesn't fit in with the team. #SoSad #NotKonaStyle"}
{"text":"Bar and grill places at the mall do not excite me.  They tend to remind me of a TGI Friday's, no matter how modern and fun they are.  Kona Grill, despite being a chain bar and grill at the mall, was a pleasant surprise.  We were looking for a place to watch a World Baseball Classic game, and all bars in Old Town Scottsdale were overflowing with thirsty baseball fans.  Fortunately, one of the locals suggested Kona Grill.  We parked our rental car in one of the covered garages and went in.  The restaurant looked nice and modern without being pretentious.  We decided to sit on the patio, despite the lax smoking laws in Arizona.  The weather was perfect, and the covered concrete patio with wrought iron chairs and tables seemed like the place to be.  We patiently waited until the Arizona State basketball game was over, and patrons started leaving for greener pastures.  We grabbed a huge round table in front of the biggest TV on the patio and sat down.  That's pretty much how we spent the next 3 hours.  We ordered just about everything on the menu: mini sliders, onion strings, taco, pasta and a huge plate of sushi.  Kona claims that its menu is where East meets West.  In reality, it means that you are getting Western food with an Eastern flavor.  You don't come here for authentic Asian food; you come here to watch a game with friends and/or have a drink or two.  A word about the staff here.  They could not have been friendlier, nicer or more accommodating.  The manager showed up with the remote to turn on the game that we wanted.  A waiter literally walked me to the bathroom instead of pointing me in the general direction.  Our waitress was chatty, funny and super helpful.  She talked me out of getting the Thai-Peanut chicken noodles: \"Are you sure you know what it is?  I wouldn't order it, unless you really like salty peanut butter.  'Cause that's what it tastes like.\"  I ordered the Pad Thai instead, and it was pretty decent.  The string onions were pretty good, and the sliders were just average.  We even had a celebrity sighting at the table right behind us.  A San Francisco Giants outfielder, let's call him, ummm, Baron Crowand, was enjoying a light dinner at Kona.  He was not, however, enjoying the company of his three female friends.  In fact, at one point during dinner, we thought he had ditched the women and bolted for the door.  That wasn't the case though.  Hey, if this place is good enough for a major league baseball player, it's good enough for me.  Above average food + fun and relaxing atmosphere + friendly service = I will be back!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a great Happy Hour out on the patio. Kentucky Mules were recommended by Jen (our server)...& they were AWESOME. We had multiple sushi rolls, lettuce wraps & pork sliders from the HH menu. All were good. Jen our server was awesome, I'd try and get her again if/when we return. Very personable, friendly, gave good honest recommendations. Service was great and we all enjoyed the time thers."}
{"text":"This was my first time at this particular Kona Grill. The food was absolutely delicious although my boyfriend ordered the pork tenderloin and it was VERY rare and we were told 20 minutes after ordering that there was no bok choy. The service however was absolutely terrible. Our server was brisk and was barely at our table. Half the time we were serviced but whom I believe was the manager. The appetizer of lettuce wraps and miso soup took about 30 minutes and we had to ask a gentleman for silverware and napkins- when he didn't give us any I went up to the host stand and asked one of them for silverware. My drink was empty for a while, and waited a long time in between food being cleared. Getting our check. Etc. I would trust other reviews when they mention the long wait times for service."}
{"text":"Probably one of the worse places I've been to in Vegas. Where do I even begin? This restaurant is located inside fashion mall and has four out of five stars on yelp. Did I come on a bad day or order the wrong thing? You tell me. I came with a party of 6 on a Friday late afternoon and ordered a buffet of different foods ranging from the BBQ chicken flat bread, sushi, pasta, chicken rice plate, and calamari. The best thing was the calamari. BBQ chicken flat bread literally tasted like bread with BBQ sauce on it. Sushi was mediocre but the rice was sort of hard. Both the salmon pasts and the chicken lemon Pasta was delicious. And the chicken  veggie rice plate just terrible. It tasted like Panda Express.   Drinks of course were good because we stuck to something we knew. The sake sangria was a different delicious twist.   When the bill came I had to double check it because I had used my yelp check in for a free appetizer. We also sent the chicken plate back and they said they'd take it off the bill but they didn't. I told the server and she said because we touched it she couldn't take it off. This was not what she said earlier. I asked to speak with the manager at this point. After going back and forth I finally got the chicken rice plate off the bill. This is the time I will come to this restaurant. Not worth the price you're paying for for the quality of food."}
{"text":"This review is for 3.5 stars.  If you don't come for HH, then Kona Grill is pretty average.  The food quality isn't the best or most authentic.  But ordering off the HH menu is the way to go.  $8 sake bomb with a 20oz beer and a small sake, or higher class sake for $8 is great for drinks.  Add a few sushi rolls or lettuce wraps and you're good to go.  They have plenty of TVs and nice staff who are happy to serve you.  HH runs 5-7pm and 9-close so it's great for the usual or late night crowd.  I would recommend Kona for a nice HH meal with an eclectic offering that isn't simply sushi but also offers sliders, calamari, and other typical HH meals.  But if you're looking for authentic sushi, then I'd go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Good Happy Hour and the same price as a typical Kona Grill regardless of being directly on the strip. Got a good cocktail selection, some beers, and sake on the menu. HH food is just average but good variety for someone to refuel and try the menu. Nothing spectacular but if you're shopping in Fashion Show or walking this side of the strip and want something you know and live with, then come on down."}
{"text":"This location looks like a whole new restaurant. I love the changes and how it looks and feels inside. I was a little bummed that their happy hour prices went up but they still have great food and great service. I would def recommend for a night out or happy hour."}
{"text":"The blended Strawberry margarita with sugar on the rim is fantastic. Also Every appetizer at happy hour is delish. Wished they had more variety though"}
{"text":"Not bad. Had The Jamaican chicken and banana, very tasty. Also had a soft shell crab roll which was pretty good."}
{"text":"For National Boss day, or whatever the official name is, my co-workers and I decided we were going to suck up a little bit and take the one in charge to lunch. One of them suggested Kona Grill and what a suggestion it was. Although I did get a thorough look through the menu, I didn't have much choice as to what I was going to order as my co-worker kept raving about the Macadamia Crusted Chicken Breast. It was a flavorful delight and so moist and tender no knife was necessary. The mashed potatoes and vegetables were just as good and bursting with flavor. I added a house salad to my meal which was served with an outstanding vinegrette dressing and crumbled bleu cheese. The server was very friendly and attentive. Our drinks were never empty and she kept pretty good tabs on us, making sure that everything was satisfactory. I am definitely going to have to make a return trip to try the sushi. Three of us added salads to our meal which brought the total to just under ninety bucks. That may be a little on the high side for a non-alcoholic lunch, but it was a high class lunch in an elegant setting and worth every penny. It didn't put off a great \"family\" vibe and would not be some place I would expect a family to dine, especially if the kids are younger. Save the money and get the kids a happy meal. This is, however, a perfect place for date night and is located just steps away from Total Wine and More. Bonus! I can see many happy return trips in my future."}
{"text":"Centrally located, good but not great sushi, definitely a great place for \"people watching\", especially if you sit outdoors... Slightly overpriced, but that's probably to do with its location."}
{"text":"NOTE: This review is of the Chandler Fashion Mall Location.  Not too terribly over priced for a mall restaurant. Ok selection of regular menu items and a fairly good selection of sushi. They also had a number of gluten free selections.  I had the Jerk Chicken sandwich. Not bad, but nothing special. Lettuce, tomato, spicy mayo, jerk grilled chicken, and bun. It could have been served up at any of a few thousand eateries around the country. (as an interesting aside, I broke out in hives shortly after consuming this item - I have no idea why, as I don't have any known food allergies...)  I also sampled the Ahi on Crispy Wonton and the Potstickers. The Potstickers were very tasty, but refused to hold together when trying to pick them up with fork or chopsticks.  The Ahi on Crispy Wonton was fresh, firm, and tasteless. If the Ahi hadn't been drizzled with some wasabi sauce it might have been any flesh on any crispy substrate.  The California rolls were average.  The Philadelphia rolls needed better quality salmon.  The White Pizza was eh. A bit overkill on the sun-dried tomatoes.  The Coke was watered down.  For me, this would not be a regular dining destination, however as a change of pace if you're already at the mall it's adequate."}
{"text":"Good food, good service. Though my friend did end up having something harder than usual in her food, mine wasn't bad. Check it out, why not."}
{"text":"Kona Grill to me was like an average sushi place with the benefit of being on the strip and with Las Vegas strip prices! The only best thing about this dining experience was that I qualified for a free appetizer which were the avocado egg rolls through Yelp and  I have to say they were decent. Located in a very nice part of the fashion show mall area facing the strip. If you feel like it you can sit outside as well!"}
{"text":"Really good.  Garret was our server, late nite b4 a movie this place really hit the spot.  Our server was on point.  Kitchen was solid.  This definitely is our new late nite spot.  Comfy chairs too!"}
{"text":"Super impressed!!!! IV been to Kona grills before .... but this one has left such a fantastic impression on me.... we've been to this location twice now, once about a month a ago and then again last night, our server was John and he was so friendly and totally on point! Very accommodating and anticipated our every need! The next is their sushi chefs!... they work their butts off... one guys appropriately from Japan...FRESH SUSHI HERE people!... of all the restaurants in Vegas, this is one of my favorites!!! Great job guys, keep it up!!! Thank you for such a consistently wonderful experience!!!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the Atlantic, fiery shrimp, and spicy tuna rolls during happy hour with friends. The misters made outside seating comfortable."}
{"text":"Pretty bomb. Definitely worth it to go during happy hour! 3 to 7 pm They aren't kidding about the voodoo roll being spicy .. get ready to sweat a little bit. And the avocado egg rolls with the honey cilantro sauce are a great start."}
{"text":"This place has good food! I wouldn't get the sushi however... my friends got the sushi and if you've had sushi mon.. i would skip the sushi here.  They have a macademia nut chicken which is my all time favorite!  They have this cream sauce to it and I love it! I loved it so much that on the day I was leaving, I got an order to go along with my order that I ate there and brought it back for the boyfriend to try!  He loved it too even though it wasn't as fresh since we had to reheat it! (I live about 3 hours away)"}
{"text":"Great Happy Hour specials if you can get there early enough for a table at the bar or outside.  Met my girlfriend at 5pm on a Friday for HH and there was already people standing around waiting for tables. Very happening place located at San Tan Mall with great patio seating, unless its 110 out with humidity, then it may be cooler to sit inside. Service was a bit slow, however I know they were very busy."}
{"text":"I have never been so displeased with service before to write a review, but this I feel deserves it.  My boyfriend and I wanted to enjoy a nice dinner and some drinks, we made a reservation were seated right away at a dirty table. It took about 20 minutes to get service and asked if we would like drinks from someone who was not our server, our server followed up quickly to introduce himself, Sam. The other lady brought our drinks. We waited about 10 more minutes for our server to ask us what we wanted for dinner. Food came fast from another person who we also had to ask for silverware. Our server returned to ask how the food was, we never saw him again. We had to ask another server for our bill. I unfortunately will never recommend this place to anyone, just because of the service."}
{"text":"My niece and I had dinner and drinks at Kona Grill in San Tan Mall area last night. The waitress took our drink order then turned with a full tray of dirty dishes and a sauce fell off her tray onto the floor. It splattered all up my leg, arm and some on my shorts. Honestly, it was not that big of a deal. Things happen and it obviously was an accident. She grabbed napkins so quick for me and the manager was at our table in a heartbeat. They then brought me out wet towels. Over the next hour that we were there the manager checked on us twice and our waitress apologized numerous times. The manager on duty took the appetizer off of our bill and offered to pay for my dry cleaning if necessary. Honestly, for such a small mis-hap, the waitress and manager went over and above. Just this jesture alone made our night and made us realize how in tune with their customers and customer satisfaction they are. Thank You for a Great Experience!! And We Loved our food!!"}
{"text":"I think Kona Grill has slowly dropped in the quality of food and portions over the past number of years....for this level of pricing, you need to be far more attentive on service and quantity and quality of food.  We still go now and then as my wife likes a couple of the dishes.......I would say 3.5 stars...."}
{"text":"I love Kona grill & would've given it five stars... but this is the second time that i order chicken& shrimp lettuce wraps online & it comes without the cucumber salad. It's never an issue when I dine in. It's just annoying that they purposely don't add it."}
{"text":"Great new location right on the strip. Same great Kona Grille as in Summerlin but with a fun vacation atmosphere. Our server Roy was perfect he recommended the most amazing sweet chili salmon !!! The dragon rolls were great everything we ordered was. We will definitely come back"}
{"text":"Great Happy hour specials and great atmosphere, the manager always comes around to make sure we have what we need, great service and staff.  If you're looking for sushi or just a drink after work hit up Kona Grill at Fashion square!"}
{"text":"I was looking for some sushi late last night. Kona Grill's happy hour was awesome. You must try the Avocado Egg Roll to start out. It's awesome! They have good selection but i would like to see more on the happy hour menu. The food was great, service was fast, staff was friendly, and you get your BANG for your BUCK! I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"Used to be one of my favorite places until they took the sweet and spicy shrimp off the happy hour menu. Off to bonefish I go for Bang Bang Shrimp!"}
{"text":"Kona Kona Kona! A Summerlin hotspot located in Boca Park, but im not sure why im telling you this since everyone and their mom has been here! They have the best happy hour. I usually partake in the 4$ Margarita or 7$ sake bombs. Food wise its just as good! from sushi, avacado egg rolls, to flat breads they have something pretty much for anyone.  Only one downfall.. their usually so busy its hard to get a table or spot at the bar so get there early!"}
{"text":"Sadly, I think this place is suffering from \"I don't know what I want to be\" itis.  In the past, we've gone for the happy / reverse happy hour and had great experiences.  But, Saturday, unfortunately, it was just not good at all.  It was 9:45 PM, on a Friday, but since they didn't close until 11 I figured we were ok.  The only empty table that was clean was at the sushi bar - which looked nice due to the enormous fish tank.  Sadly, that's when the nice part of the evening ended.    Immediately after sitting down, one of the sushi chefs started breaking down / cleaning the entire bar whist mean mugging us and the rest of the patrons.  I then realized I couldn't even hear myself think.  Between the sauced people in the lounge, to the house music blaring overhead, I thought, for a moment, I was stuck in an over-priced lounge in Vegas.  Our waiter, who I'm pretty sure was an extra on the Jersey Shore, took our order and it only took twelve minutes to deliver the drinks.  Then, two of the three sushi rolls that were ordered made it to us, along with completely un-seasoned sliders and greasier than it should've been flatbread.  A manager noticed my sad face and asked what was wrong, after explaining it to him (I think he heard me) he came back with $6 taken off the tab for the grease.  It was a nice attempt at saving face, but not enough to right the sour note.  Alas, KG, we will not be back."}
{"text":"My thoughts on the KG is this: you just cannot beat the value for their HH or reverse HH.  Their drink menu, combined with their discounted rolls / flatbreads / appetizers are fantastic.  I can't quite give the joint five stars because outside of the discounted time, I just think most of their menu is overpriced.  This night, at this location, our service was outstanding.  Within minutes of sitting down we had three sake bombers with a big ol' bottle of Kirin light and we were happy almost instantly.  There were a few people smoking on the porch, but not anywhere near our table so it wasn't a problem whatsoever.  For food we got the calamari, the chicken and shrimp lettuce wraps, a Philly roll and flatbread to share between the six of us.  Perfect amount of food and the bill was more than reasonable.  It should be noted that there were no less than four dudes rocking Affliction shirts who were more interested in their phones than their beautiful arm candy - but whatever."}
{"text":"FOOD: This place serves amazing sushi. I went with my friend and we ordered 1 Philadelphia roll which has cream cheese blended in the sushi roll. You might think it sounds weird, and you're right, but as soon as you eat one, you'll realize how amazing it tastes. Then we ordered the soft shell crab roll which also tasted so fresh and well put together.   DRINKS: However, the reason for giving it a 4/5 stars is because of the outrageously expensive drinks. I ordered a Moscow mule, not knowing how much it would cost because I couldn't find it on the menu. Then I realized it was $9 for one drink! This drink normal goes for $5-6.   RETURN FACTOR:  I would return to Kona, because the food quality is great. However, I probably wouldn't order a drink from them."}
{"text":"Still love that crab crunch roll and the amazing oriental chicken salad. They also have a good salad with grilled peppers in it, that was really tasty. Yet the best dinner item of all time is that chicken with their famous sauce, the name escapes me. Every waiter will tell you if you ask, it's the top selling thing. Hint: order extra side of sauce for leftovers next day.  They have a great happy hour menu as well esp if your in the mood for tasting variety.  Yum choc cake."}
{"text":"OVER PRICED FOOD & FOOD POISONING We came in last night (Saturday, May 5 2017) and started off with a beer and lemon drop martini which were both really great! The bartender was friendly and attentive. We ordered calamari which was bland and not well presented, on a bed of shredded iceberg, just a little awkward looking. Looked a little undercooked. We also ordered edamame, it was a little over priced but tasted decent. The last thing we ordered was the Las Vegas roll. It came out not as full as I was expecting. I had a couple bites and told my husband it tasted strange. Tasted really fishy and if you eat fish you know fresh fish doesn't taste like that... He ate the rest because he didn't notice. Well fast forward to 3 AM we are both in the bathroom violently sick. 1 pm the next day and it is still not better. All our symptoms say food poisoning and no one else in our house is sick. We paid $80 for food poisoning. Will not be back. The only thing pleasant about the visit was the bar tender but good service doesn't overpower food poisoning."}
{"text":"This place is great. Excellent food and excellent service every time. Their happy hour is especially good on the belly and the wallet. It's a little dark in there for me, but that doesn't keep me away."}
{"text":"A place you must come on Sundays!! Happy hour all day!! The Thai chicken satay is my favorite!! Great place to hang with friends !!!"}
{"text":"Trendy, fun spot. Service was quick. Macadamia crusted chicken chopped salad was on point! Would like to go back for happy hour."}
{"text":"The sashimi here it is so thin it is transparent, The service is so slow the party behind me has been waiting 45 minutes for their sushi to be delivered, they missed their movie. On a good note they allow my daughter to bring in her panda express so that she could eat with me. I should've ate with her instead. While expressing my concerns she had the nerve to roll her eyes at me. To self and others don't come here again!!!"}
{"text":"Great place for happy hour, the atlantic roll is amazing!"}
{"text":"The 3 girls at the front are worthless and not happy. The remodel is nice but the customers are definitely footing the bill for it, everything is a $1 to $7 more. I sat on the patio upstairs. For my remodel money I would have made the floors were flat/level and the bar walls and tile lined up. So you don't see 2 different tiles in the walk area. The bar floor was a mess in the public walk way. Waiters and management picked up straws off the floor and never washed their hands after. Silverware and Drinking glasses were dirty not only at my table but 2 others. Food that was not mine was delivered to my table 4x's my sushi came as I was ready to go and was sloppy and soggy. :-("}
{"text":"This place was fun and clean. The staff was Amazing and engaging. Happy Hour was very very Happy."}
{"text":"It was okay.   I got a Kona chopped salad.  avocado wasn't ripe.  They forgot cheese.   I asked for vinegar and they were cheap with it.  I had to ask again.  My husband got sushi.  He liked his a lot.   I got a vegetable roll too.  It was decent.  Hard to mess up.   I've been here before for happy hour. I'd return for that but not for lunch.   It's a lot cheaper then.  Bring a driver for drinks cause they are strong!"}
{"text":"3 stars is generous for some of the experiences we've had here. We come here all the time because of the happy hour menu with some pretty good options like the BBQ Chicken Flatbread and the Smoked Gouda fondue.  The service is just okay, and we did have one awful experience here a while back with a waitress who had taken our credit card when we paid so we had figure things out with management. Not a good situation... that prevented us from coming back for a LONG while.  They used to have margaritas on happy hour that were good and cheap (not anymore sadly). And unfortunately, Kona keeps changing their menu and increasing their prices. The happy hour menu used to be all $6, and since then it has raised to $7.25 and now $8. While some menu items may still be worth the 2 buck increase, others like the potstickers are not, as they stay in the same price category yet the quantity is so small in comparison to other options.  Quality food, but the drinks are getter worse and it is getting more expensive by the month in addition to the changing menu constantly getting rid of some of our favorites! :("}
{"text":"We were pleasantly surprised with our meals and the service was fabulous. Had the macadamia crusted chicken with asparagus and the New York strip with the lobster and crab sushi roll for an appetizer. The chicken was melt in your mouth good. The sauce was amazing. My favorite chicken dish maybe ever. Food was fresh."}
{"text":"Stephen and I were here a few weeks ago for happy hour on a Friday.  Um yeah... no where to sit AT ALL.  The drinks were ok at first but my third one tasted like shit, like seriously, straight alcohol.  Did I order tequila on the rocks??? NO.    Neways... I wouldn't go back for happy hour, its just too crowded and the people there are just not my scene.  Cugars, muscle dudes, Soccer moms dressed in their 20's clubbin gear.  Meh... I'd rather go to a dive and relax.  The cali-rolls were ok... nothing I would go back for though.  Bartenders were nice enough."}
{"text":"Average experience. The happy hour prices used to be much better. The server was nice enough, but I couldn't help but feel the disappointment in her facial expressions when ordering items from the happy hour menu. I've noticed this reaction at other restaurants as well. You almost feel obligated to order more, and then you remember that you didn't go out for lunch with the intention of dropping a bunch of money - and that should be okay. A big part of it boils down to the tipping system America adopted, which isn't a thing anywhere else in the world, that has wait staff thirsty for those big checks that are often accompanied by larger tips.  Anyway, back to Kona Grill.. The food was alright. I liked my barbeque chicken flatbread well enough. My wife wasn't too crazy about her calamari. She finished it, but she mentioned that she'll never order that particular item again. I do enjoy their patio. It's packed, but manages to stay cool in the shade. And last but not least, the food was out pretty fast. Kudos on that."}
{"text":"So... I used a yelp check in coupon today, it was an awesome deal $14.00 towards a free sushi roll.  Thanks for the great coupon.  But when it came time to redeem this it was SO strange, my waiter asked for my phone to go show the manager and he didn't return for about 7 or 8 minutes.  It was so strange.  I told him I felt like it was tacky and he said we only have one manager and he wanted to make sure you aren't lying.  I found that even more tacky than taking and disappearing with my phone.  I'm writing this review in the hopes that management can find a better way to handle this.  It would be much better for a manager to politely visit my table to verify the coupon.  I hope for the sake of other customers this doesn't happen again, as it's very off putting and unprofessional.  Although as always, our sushi was fantastic."}
{"text":"Kona Grill is always a pleasure. I've been to this location probably a million times and I have no complaints. The service is always good, food is consistent, and as all of High Street- the people watching is Grade A. Last night I popped in to meet a friend after work for some girl talk. I ordered hot sake and Kirin so you can't really mess that up but on other occasions I have tried their Moscow Mule and Jalapeno margarita. Both I recommend. I deviated from my usual raw fish choices and got the smoked gouda fondue (don't judge me I was STARVING after 13 hours on my feet). It was ooey gooey deliciousness. The warm pretzel bites were magnificent and the apple slices were fresh and crunchy. I also got the soft shell crab. They have the roll but if you ask for the crab by itself they will give you just that. Say the words \"I'll have the soft shell crab roll- without any of the roll!\" and voila! Barring any unforeseen circumstances, I'll continue to come back!"}
{"text":"Stopped by here yesterday for a fast lunch and was pleasantly surprised with the quick and friendly service and quality of food. We sat upstairs in the bar and I believe our servers name was Josh. I love Sangria and Kona makes theirs with Sake. I'm not a fan of Sake but this was really yummy!   We had the potstickers for an appetizer, my daughter had a sushi roll and I ordered the fish tacos with fried rice. The only hiccup to the whole meal was that the fried rice had cooked pineapple in it and I'm allergic to that. But, this was my mistake because I didn't read the description. Josh was very professional about it when I called him over to our table, taking it back to the kitchen and having them make it again without the pineapple.  So many things in the menu sound really good so I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Decided to stop here on my lunch break at work, service was extraordinary and food was delectable. Jason M. is the man, he made sure our food was served with the quickness and made sure to check on us if we needed anything. Friendly and awesome atmosphere. Will be returning again."}
{"text":"I love Kona, in particular, I love their macadamia nut chicken. It's always fresh and hot. It's paired with this sweet apricot jam and brown gravy. The combination of savory with a splash of sweet is out of this world. I could eat this dish every week. As for the sushi, it fairly top notch. I usually get the Philadelphia rolls. Yummyness."}
{"text":"Of all the years that I have seen Kona Grill, this was my first visit ever.  I think the food is great. I think the happy hour menu is fabulous. On a nice fall day where the weather is a perfect 70 degrees all day, the outdoor dining was comfortable.  On this particular day, it wasn't busy.  However, I think the customer service could use a little help. For a day that wasn't busy, the service was slow, even when it appeared there was enough wait staff. Although the wait staff seemed like good and nice people, I think the customer service could use some improvement. I know what it is. It's a restaurant that has a HI restaurant name, that started in AZ but probably not run and owned by anyone that is from HI, but visited HI. Therefore, it lacks the ALOHA SPIRIT!!!"}
{"text":"I had gift cards; therefore, decided to pay the place a visit.   It was very busy.   As I perused the menu, I thought I'd check out the bar menu as well.   I decided on the Sebastian cab ($12).   Mehhhh.   Very mediocre.  I should have asked for a taste before ordering, but the server seemed rushed, and I didn't care for her personality anyway.     I had the jambalaya and my companion had the lobster mac and cheese.  The jambalaya came with white rice in the middle of the plate.  It was tasty and spicy.   Her mac and cheese came with some nice pieces of lobster.    I didn't taste it, but she said it was good.  I have been here for happy hour.   I think I'd rather stick to the HH menu and time slot.   I definitely did not feel it was worth what we paid.   All in all, I'm not impressed.   I'm not impressed with the food nor the service."}
{"text":"Went here with some of my gal pals for lunch.   I had the macadamia nut chicken with house mashed potatoes, seasonal vegetables, shoyu cream, pineapple-papaya marmalade.   My gal pals had the crab crunch sushi and the Cuban sandwich.  I had gone to another of the Kona Grills prior for happy hour, and was not impressed, but remained mum while my pals suggested we meet here for lunch.   I figured I had not tried their lunch menu, and it had been a while since I had been to one of the restaurant's other locations.  I must admit, my chicken was quite tasty with its accompanying mashed potatoes and seasonal veggies.   The marmalade was perfect as well.   I did not try the sushi nor the sandwich; therefore, I have no idea how they tasted.  I am glad I gave the business another shot.   I think I'd maybe return."}
{"text":"Not sure if it was the combination of the poor food especially for such I high price, or the bad service. The staff was heard commenting many times how they didn't like how busy it was, like asic they had something better to do...and having to sit next to all the ultra-elite Summerlin-ites made me want to go get Botox and a tummy tuck then gorge on fast food while waching the Real Hpusewives of Orange County. Been to Hawaii many times, including my wedding, and never tasted this bland of food. Appetizers errr over salted and entrees were undercooked. Thank god they couldn't screw up the sushi."}
{"text":"Great service and great food on NYE. We will be back"}
{"text":"Sushi and happy hour is really good. Don't bother eating there. Food is about 1.5 star."}
{"text":"I'm sorry bummed about this place. My first time, we got a very dirty dish, hair in our roll, re heated calamari and sushi rice was so dry!. Our server was nice, I didn't want to complain because I know I am not going to be back."}
{"text":"First timer. Came here with my Yelp check-in ready to go because you get a free sushi roll or appetizer ( with a purchase of an entree)  I ordered the Voodoo sushi ( for free with check-in) it was okay. Needed more sauce, I could barely taste it but hey, it was free so I won't complain too much. For my entree I ordered the  Cajun Salmon pasta. Wow... BLAND!! No seasoning on the pasta what-so-ever. The salmon was pretty good but the pasta was boring. Not worth my money.  Everyone else in my group ordered the macadamia crusted chicken and they all enjoyed that.  My boyfriend ordered the fondue as an appetizer which was pretty good!  Don't order the Pasta, skip that.  The service was great and he decor was beautiful.  I'll come back maybe during happy hour next time."}
{"text":"Their grilled chicken salad is awesome! Grill salmon is so fresh and has great texture!"}
{"text":"Outstanding food and service. Our waitress was awesome. She let us know her favorites and took good care of us."}
{"text":"First time at the Gilbert location.....  Ehhh  Kona is moving towards the boring corporate feel you get at outback or red lobster.  Too bad  Our server was super sweet and knowledgeable.  So that was good. The SUSHI was horrendous!!!!   They obviously are not using fresh fish daily. They must use up all product before replacing it with a fresh fish each morning.  The salmon on my roll had brown/cream colored edges...??  The tuna was a really weird off white color as well (not appealing). The \"fishy\" smell was so bad it overpowered the taste of the sushi. My friend swears it's usually better, but she also drinks heavily lol Way fresher/tastier sushi and poke bowls elsewhere in downtown Gilbert.  My new favorite is Sushi Brokers!  Their fish is ALWAYS fresh!!!!"}
{"text":"Overall a pretty decent place for sushi. Not the best sushi I have ever tasted, not the worst either. Nice atmosphere and the staff was pretty friendly. Tried to come here for happy hour once but was disappointed to find out it was only outside. Not worth the extra couple bucks in my pocket especially since it was 115. Came back again though and sat at the sushi bar next to the huge fish tank. Pretty cool place to go, would like to try it again with a different chef many people seemed to be asking for at the bar. Would like to try Reverse HH too."}
{"text":"I had an AMAZING dinner here the other night thanks to Stephanie!!! She was absolutely one the best there! Our glasses were always full, she was always checking on us with a huge smile, \"How are we doing, anything I can get you\" She was extremely friendly which is hard to find in the food industry. She answered every question I had and even had great recommendations for me! Thanks for making my time spent at Kona Grill one to remember, Stephanie!"}
{"text":"Came on a Sunday, not too busy so service was quick. I came with my sister and brother in law and we ordered the calamari to start, it was decent, nothing all that. I ordered the avocado chicken club which was good, but it didn't make my pickle tickle. I probably won't come here again. The staff was nice! Even though the hostess was almost undressing my brother in law with her eyes!! It's cool though."}
{"text":"Met Maggie the general manager.... So accommodating to my party..... Ensured our visit met with a high degree of satisfaction.... This is truly what a restaurant general should be"}
{"text":"Never had a bad time in this Chandler Location. Usually go with my friends or fam during happy hour and even if it's super packed, we're always served and given attention as if it wasn't that busy. Happy hour apps and drinks are simple but flavorful. From the Calamari to the Flatbreads and sushis. Cosmo is a bit strong but I love it. Also bomb are the frozen strawberry margaritas. Nice ambience, clean, fast and great service. I will always come back here for Happy Hour."}
{"text":"This place is always hopping and there's good reason why...great food and drinks at a fairly resonable price.  The swordfish is unbelievable as well as there signature stuffed chicken dish.  They also have sushi which makes for a greater starter before you sink your teeth into the delicious entree.  All in all a very popular and tasty place to dine or just chill after a hard day's work."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch last week. Service very good. Nut crusted chicken was really good. One of better meals I have had in awhile. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Great place for happy hour.  There's not much going on at City North except for the restaurants and bars.  Kona Grill is the place for decent food and cheap drinks for happy hour.  This last visit my friend and I ordered the fried calamari and a Hawaiian pizza.  Both were pretty good and enough to fill us up.  The Sam Adams seasonal beer was served in chilled beer glasses which was a nice touch.  Sitting at the bar talking with friends, watching TV and having fun people watching is the way to go."}
{"text":"I would give 6 stars if I could. I work in food, too, so I'm held to a high standard. That's also the rubric that I hold others to. Kona Grill goes above and beyond with their service. Lorynn and Keeyn are amazing. And they better be here when I return. I am more than taken care of."}
{"text":"Every single time I go here everything is on point. The food the service and the location right inside fashion show is awesome. Thank you for all my amazing experiences I will for sure be back and keep spreading the word.."}
{"text":"Sake Bombs a must... Packed Friday night out on the patio, and the menu had something for everyone's palate! Portions were pretty big.  Loved my Yamada Roll! Spicy drizzle of sauce over the roll, crab meat was sweet, and I was comfortably full on this soy wrapped roll. Friends enjoyed their steak and potatoes, flatbread pizzas and shrimp appetizers. Staff was attentive for the most part.  In addition to the great food, their ambiance and  our company hosting our visit to AZ really made it so that we enjoyed ourselves!"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch yesterday and ordered off the lunch specials menu: half sandwich and a salad for around $9.  It was ok, but nothing special.  My friend really likes this place for some reason, but I just don't get it."}
{"text":"Great place for Happy Hour!  Terrific service and food comes out quickly.  We order the spicy tuna sushi everytime as well as a crunchy shrimp appetizer that has a kick to it.  We are usually wine drinkers but the last time we went we tried the margaritas and they were amazing!  This location is very close to my house and Happy Hour starts early so it's a great place to meet friends right when we get off work."}
{"text":"Half off bottles of wine all day every Wednesday! Score. Get the angry Edamame, very tasty. Our bartender Tom was great and this place gets PACKED so get there early if you can. Sushi was fresh and very good. So all in all, good service, good food, great company. Exactly what I needed!"}
{"text":"I met with my girl Kira here for reverse happy hour after seeing a movie across the street.  You gotta love their reverse happy hour deals as they are just as good as happy hour. We ordered the chicken skewers, crab crunch roll, crab special roll, and the bama... Hey what you can say I was hungry. The rolls were ok except for the crab special roll. It was so salty. I mean I was like is it just me or is the super salty? Kira tried a piece as well and she was like wow, yea that is a little over salty. I asked our fabulous waiter about it and he kindly said would you like to order a california roll instead and I will take the crab roll off? Really? wow thank you. So i pushed that other roll to the side and devoured the rest (hey I told you I was hungry) and enjoyed great convo and food with Kira. Everyone was really nice, and the food, with the exception of the salty crab special roll was yummy. I will definitely be back again soon."}
{"text":"This is a good restaurant. Great atmosphere, service and wonderful selections are offered in the menu. I will return. The only thing is that we were celebrating a birthday and the wait person was not attentive enough to pick up on this. Yes I know, we could have mentioned, but great customer service happens naturally."}
{"text":"I LOOVVEEE this place! I'm so glad that they have a location in Vegas. Kona offers a great mix of American & Asian food. Not to mention the best happy-hour.  We came here twice. The first time for their main restaurant which is decent, but you HAVE to try their happy-hour. I know that it's all day happy hour on Sundays too! I normally order the BBQ Chicken pizza ($6), fried calamari, lettuce wrap w/ chicken & shrimp, and a few of the rolls. I know some of their other locations offer the Atlantic roll (salmon roll) & spicy shrimp rolls. Everything is under $8 so you can get a healthy portion of food for cheap. It's best to go in a group so that you can get a real taste of their happy-hour menu. We didn't get any drinks so I can't comment about that menu. Just make sure to sit at the bar or outside seating for happy-hour prices.  A must try: Japaleno Yellowtail Sashimi. This is a little pricier, but if you have never tried any version of this, Kona is a great place to start. They have the perfect ponzu sauce to go with the yellowtail. The jalapenos cuts all of the fishy-taste [which usually isn't present since their sushi is fresh].  I never ate sashimi before until I tried this very dish.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Super service. After we identified one on our party had a food allergy, the waiter Jacob, went to work on finding suitable alternatives for some of their rolls. This was fantastic! We were all able to enjoy a meal without issues.   The manager visited the table to inform us  on of the chefs would use a new station to prepare the food, preventing contamination. Although it wasn't necessary for them to go this extra mile, it was truly appreciated.   Great food, fresh tasting and delicious. Perfect service. Nice ambiance. What else could you ask for? Nothing."}
{"text":"Very friendly service and strong margarita. Food:  terrible. Tasteless salad, over salted calamari, flatbread pizza with raw mushrooms and sauce like tomato paste. Paid way too much. Won't be back."}
{"text":"I dig the patio! I love sitting on the patio for happy hour.  Yes, they are like a chain so the food is consistant and nothing to write home about but it's good.  I enjoy margaritas and they have a tasty \"ladies margarita\" that rocks your socks for $4! I'd reccommend getting there early because it gets pretty crowded by 6ish. Parking is a bit of a nightmare at Boca so if you're in a hurry get the Valet."}
{"text":"I searched for about 30 minutes to find a place to eat after a long drive and we ended up here. We were greeted with a friendly smile and placed outside where the weather was perfect. Jamie, our server, was more than delightful as she noticed every detail about our wants and needs and anticipated what they would be before we ever spoke. Her smile and kindness made our dinner so delightful that we will come back and tell tons of others as well. Just to let you know, we had sushi rolls, the chicken and cabbage dish, two amazing martinis and the lettuce wraps. The value is outstanding and you will not be disappointed. Hint: they have reverse happy hour from 9 PM to 11 PM Monday-Thursday so take advantage of it."}
{"text":"I've visited the Boca Park location a few times now. Yuppie heaven. I definitely prefer a more reasonable or somewhat quiet atmosphere. Generally people are shouting over the top of each other to be heard. Not so nice. The Sushi Rolls and Pot Stickers were pretty good. I know many people like going here but it's not really my first choice. However, it is an easy place to find and they seem to be making real efforts to improve lately. Yay!"}
{"text":"I have been to Kona Grill multiples times. For some reason I come back every once in awhile, maybe one time for every 6-8 months. The food is always okay to me, not displeasing. I'm not sure what brings me back? Could be the nice people, the nice bar area, the scene, or drinks. Whatever it is, everyone should try their happy hour & white sangria. I wish there was an \"all you can drink\" option!"}
{"text":"I've been to Kona a few times but have learned the best time to go is happy hour. The place is lively and the drinks are awesome! I would definitely recommend the chambord margarita. It is one of the best margaritas I have ever had!! And, for $4, it's pretty inexpensive. I also enjoy their sushi and appetizers.   Kona is a nice place to go for drinks and a meal. I would recommend it."}
{"text":"I love the place. The food is great. I haven't stay for long because of the movie but would like to come back sometimes."}
{"text":"wonderful service and yummy sliders!  I ordered the tuna brioche bun slider and it was fantastic -- totally forgot to add avocado otherwise it wouldve been even better!"}
{"text":"This bar is the \"Cheers\" of the sushi world. The staff here is always so willing to make us feel as if we have known each other for years! Holly at the bar is flat out amazing. Her drinks are consistent and cared for. Her personality makes you want to come back. The manager Shadi even stops by EVERY TIME to make sure we are happy and the service is on POINT! So lucky to have this as our neighborhood bar.   CANNOT RECOMMEND THIS LOCATION MORE! Should be the training ground for all the Kona's nation wide!   If this tells you anything.... I recently had my wedding celebration dinner here! Dominique was awesome!   Thank you Kona!!!!! Kaizen!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely Amazing!! I was a little skeptical after reading the reviews, but I decided to give it a shot. I'm so glad I did. The food was delicious, the service was outstanding and the atmosphere is epic.   I will definitely be coming back here. I'm going to make it one of my to go places for sushi!!"}
{"text":"Kona Grill was okay for me, the variety of sushi rolls was not to my liking. I did however enjoy my husband's salmon thai (sweet chilli glaze) salad and the Korean bulgogi taco. Probably won't return unless for cocktails."}
{"text":"I would say this place has the best happy hour in town! It is the only happy hour that is actually going on late enough for my co-workers and I to make in time. Food is amazing! However the reason why i only give it 3 stars is because service is not the greatest. I remember finding a table during happy hour and waiting so long that i literally had to flag down the nearest employee just to ask to put in our order. Another time our server would disappear for quite some time leaving us low on our drinks and not giving us opportunities to order more."}
{"text":"For a chain to be so understaffed during the day, and to not even clean up after other guests is beyond me. Open seating outside 7 open tables, non clean to sit on. I have had bad service here before but always said maybe someone called in sick, or they are running behind or someone is having a bad day. But today was the last draw for us. No excuse for how dirty this place is. Tables sticky not clean, and for us not have anyone come to us for 10 min to get a drink order it crazy. Hire a better staff, or train them better. Food is still great for what you get but can't believe the management is not on top of this stuff."}
{"text":"Very convenient if your at the mall and probably the best choice at the mall but that is grading on a steep curve."}
{"text":"Horrible service, poor maintained, bathrooms, no sound on the TVS for they hockey play off on the patio, and numerous request to turn the mister off so we would not be cold and soaked.   Not to mention there was a intoxicated customer who should not have been served.  We were told This customer was refused serviced previously and supposedly complained to corporate and in turn they ordered this location to server him. Shame on Kona, if this gentleman get in accident in a silver Nissan rouge with a California plate it's Kona fault for let him leave drunk.  We were told by the waitress that this man has no valid license and that the silver Nissan is his fourth car.   Never going back again!"}
{"text":"Took a large group here at the last second for dinner. Staff were pleasant and helpful. The waitress was a little slow to get the drink orders and even slower to get them out but once she got into the groove - things improved.   Everyone seemed satisfied with their choices.   I had the yellow tail sushmi - awesome!  I first tried this dish at Nobu in Las Vegas and this one was comparable (at a fraction of the price). We ordered seconds!  I also had the meatloaf. I have to admit - the best meatloaf I have ever tried!  Great job for a chain restaurant."}
{"text":"I thought I'd give them another shot and this was literally the worst experience I've had.  Never can to refill the water, food took an hour and it was dead, we asked to have the screen put up to get a little circulation and I guess it was broken but the guy never bothered to say anything. I doubt I'll ever go back. Had a friend here from out of town and was embarrassed."}
{"text":"Incredibly horrendous service at the bar.  There were maybe 3-4 other patrons sitting at the bar and the bartender kept talking to them.  Was it because we're young looking?  Who knows.  After sitting there for about 10 minutes or more, we finally had to flag down the bar back and ask for drinks.  My bf wanted to leave but I convinced him to stay for a drink.  The bartender came back exactly 1 time.  It took forever to get out bill...so we tipped him ZERO"}
{"text":"I noticed their menu has changed since our last visit.  Ordered fried calamari again hoping it would be better...and it tasted much better than the last time.  The small rings were very tasty.  We also ordered shishito peppers and caterpillar roll.   The shishito peppers were great.  I could eat lots of them. The caterpillar roll was small but it was very flavorful.  Good service."}
{"text":"Awesome ahi tuna. Highly recommend this place for something different and yummy food. Ask for Jake the waiter. He's awesome"}
{"text":"Very nice place to have dinner at the Mall. The food was delish and the service was quick and prompt. My son and his wife ordered 3 types of sushi and all of them they loved. I got the flat bread pizza and it hit the spot...and they had the coldest Coors Light on tap that I have ever had. The decor was stylish with water walls and a huge aquarium near the front."}
{"text":"Yelp should add a category for how long you waited.  I don't know about you but waiting an hour to eat is not my thing. Kona grill, the food is great the service is great and I walked in a 6:50pm and was eating 12 mins later. All the hype on these new places and waiting an hour to eat is for the birds.  Besides you can't eat hype"}
{"text":"The place is not only great .. but also the servers are. There Is a server called EMINA, she is so nice and funny .. u will be lucky if she will be ur server + the whole environment is great there and the food is good (try the happy hour by the way .. will never regret)"}
{"text":"Great service! Great food! I love the location. Other Kona's have not been able to hold up next to this location. We come all the time to this one when we have people in time. Patio is great for people watching especially when the weather is nice. Husband always orders their dragon roll or their flatbread pizza. I get sushi and their miso soup. Never anything negative about this place. Again, service is always great and no matter what we order for HH or dinner, everything is great."}
{"text":"A group of five of us stopped in for a quick drink and nimble while waiting for an appointment.  The happy hour prices were reasonable and had quite a bit of choices.  All of the food we ordered was EXCELLENT.  I honestly couldn't believe that happy hour food could be so tasty.  Our waitress was average but that's fine.  I was definitely pleased we stopped here.  Yum."}
{"text":"We have gone here a couple of times now.  Can get pretty loud if seated next to the bar, but we got outside seating, which was fine.  My wife and I were both satisfied with our meals."}
{"text":"Only restaurant I have been to that automatically puts the oyster crackers on the clam chowder before they serve it to you. Did it occur to them not everyone wants them? Some might say to ask for them on the side. I might if it was the NORM to put them on. Shouldn't have to ask. Strange."}
{"text":"I LOVE everything about Kona Grill.  If you love appetizers, go for their happy hour where all appetizers are half off and select sushi items are at a special price, as well as drinks. The ahi tuna on wonton crisps are a-m-a-z-i-n-g!! I can not go here without ordering them! Also, their calamari is fantastic.   As far as sushi goes, the wave roll is to die for.  My favorite entree, by far, is the miso-sake marinated sea bass. Oh. My. Goodness. I have never, ever in my life found an entree that I like more. The fish is like butter, it melts in your mouth, and the marinade compliments it perfectly. The fried rice on the side is so, so delicious and the grilled broccolini is to die for. Really, a perfect dinner.  The service is always fantastic.   Also, if you sign up for their email club, they send you a certificate for a free appetizer or sushi roll for signing up, and a certificate for a free entree on your birthday! Can't beat that!!"}
{"text":"Nothing amazing. It's always consistent. This location can get crazy busy. We went on a Sunday afternoon, so it was chill. Sometimes I am a little shocked at their prices vs serving sizes.   I wish I could remember our servers name. He was incredible. He was so polite and SUPER friendly and funny. He recommended something special from drinks to entrees. He even ordered us something on a secret menu ;). 'Twas great!"}
{"text":"Love the staff behind the bar.  Patrick and the girls are amazing.  Wine down Wednesdays are so much fun."}
{"text":"during our last few visits to the gilbert area, my husband and i have made our way to dine at the kona grill.  the first couple times, we were quite pleased with the food and service.  unfortunately, our dining experience there last week ensured that we will not be returning in the future.    first, there was the service.  on a saturday at 1:30pm, you'd expect more than one server in the dining room.  but it appeared to me that there was just one.  while she was very nice, she was awkward and definitely overwhelmed.  someone who appeared to be the manager tried to be helping her out, but it just was not good service.  then, there was the food and drink.  i ordered a mojito.  i've had a few mojitos there before and i remember them being minty and refreshing, with a touch of sweetness.  the mojito i was served tasted like a glass of simple syrup with a touch of mint.  awful!  sent that right back to the bar and ordered a kona brewing co. longboard.  at least they couldn't ruin a good beer.    my husband's turkey burger was \"ok\" though he noticed a definite downgrade in quality since our last visit.  the chicken in my kona chopped salad was noticeably bad.  the chicken tasted and had the texture of processed chicken - the stuff pressed together in a factory.  and the supposed \"macadamia nut\" crust seemed more like some sort of overly-fried cheap batter.  it did not look or taste like any macadamia nut i've ever eaten before.  this same crap-chicken was served to my young daughter in her children's meal.  i smartly decided not to make her eat.  overall, just bad. not sure what has changed at this restaurant in recent months, but YUCK!  i will not return."}
{"text":"I think this my new favorite place. I went on Friday during happy hour and it's seat yourself so we waited a little bit for a spot to be available inside which after 20 minutes didn't happen so we found a seat outside given it was a billion degrees outside it wasn't that bad with the sprinklers. I ordered my go to Las Vegas roll which was $8.75 on the happy hour menu and a strawberry margarita. Which the margarita was a little over $5 at the happy hour price and was well worth it. It was strong tequila is my drink of choice and it was clearly present in my margarita.   My mom ordered their sliders and fries. She's not a sushi eater and just tagged along. Their sliders were pretty big (2) and their fries were good I ended up snacking on hers. I always have a good time here and the sushi is great. Yes it's a little pricey but worth it."}
{"text":"Nice selection of rolls on happy hour."}
{"text":"This is the best Kona Grill I've been to in Vegas! Friendly staff . Fast service. Did not feel rushed out . Went for Happy Hour and everything was great. Sat outside and it was perfect for people watching."}
{"text":"It's about time I write a review for Kona Grill... after all, I've been here more times than I can count and 2 of these times occurred this week alone!    Kona Grill is a chain which makes me want to give them only 3 stars, but considering their food is quality, they offer a fun atmosphere, and their service is decent... I'm giving 4 stars instead.  As many of the reviews before mine say, happy hour at Kona is great.  From 3 - 7, they offer 1/2 off a small menu of appetizers, sushi rolls, pizzas, and drinks.  (They also have a reverse happy hour from 10pm on I think).  I can't speak for the pizzas (I've never tried them), but the potsticker appetizer is great, and so is the sushi.  If I'm not concerned about happy hour prices, I've often ordered other menu items such as seaweed salad, edamame, nigiri, and the seabass entree too.  I've never been disappointed.  I usually do not choose Kona as a destination, but if I'm in the area, at the mall, or someone else chooses it, I'm happy going to Kona every now and then.  It's good for what it is - take it or leave it!"}
{"text":"This place is what started it all!!! The bama roll! Do yourself a favor and try it! I love love the way the bama roll taste and the couch roll if you save room.  The menu offers a lot of good things but I am a sushi girl and I ally stick to what I know:)"}
{"text":"a group of us had a nice dinner at the Kona Grill in Boca Park in Summerlin. We wanted the happy hour but the happy hour is only outside in the patio and there wasn't enough seats for 11 of us and the tables were first come first serve. I was happy we sat inside as it seemed it was too loud sitting outside. The food was good and the waiter was very attentive. There are lots of choices and the prices are  reasonable with large portions."}
{"text":"3rd and final attempt. same old story with the food, takes too long to come out and portions are really small for what you pay for. this time the service was terrible. the waitress never came back after taking our orders until we were finished eating. an expediter brought our food. we sat for a really long time, as a family of 4, all waiting for refills on our drinks. she took forever to bring us the bill, and forever to bring it back. worst experience at kona grill yet. never again."}
{"text":"This place is awesome, hands down! You can not beat the happy hour/reverse happy hour specials, and there is always a ton of people there. The one downside is that happy hour specials are only served in the bar area or outside, but that doesn't bother me much, even if I do have to wait a litle while for a table. Their margaritas pack a punch and they make really great specialty drinks. Never had a bad experience here, and I love the location. Whenever we want to go somewhere for happy hour, kona grill is usually our first suggestion."}
{"text":"It was a Tuesday night. We had a party of 6. The wait time to get just water was well over 10 minutes. The restaurant was not at 40% capacity at this time so there seeemed to be no reason for the wait. Our group ate the prime rib sandwich: yum, the penne with lemon sauce: yum. The Cobb salad came out with nothing but lettuce and it took us a while to fine our waiter to get the remaining ingredients. He quickly fixed it and apologized. It was actually very funny that we were brought out just lettuce! We also ordered to pad Thai. Which was ok. The flatbreads were a hit though!  The drinks were good and the location was good for us. I wouldn't go there again though."}
{"text":"Great service, great food, and good drinks.  Kona Grill is definitely going on my regular rotation.    I sat at the bar for happy hour and even though it was busy it didn't take long for a bartender to get me a water and a menu.  Since I hadn't been here before I ordered the lettuce wraps and Philly roll thinking they'd be on the smaller side; they were not.  The lettuce wraps were a perfect combination of sweet and savory and the Philly roll wasn't bad either.  I also had two Sangrias trying the sparkling and the red and both were tasty.     My water glass was never empty long and I was quickly asked if I wanted anything else once my Sangrias got low.  My bill was waiting for me in a glass at the bar and once I pulled out my card it was quickly taken care of.  I couldn't really find any fault with my dinner and look forward to trying them again."}
{"text":"Price - Super affordable (my parents & siblings, a family of 6, ate for $36) Service - Beyond accommodating, friendly, knowledgeable, and memorable. Atmosphere - Sushi bar inside, dining seating inside, patio AMAZING (the bar is half inside and half outside)  My favorite part of Kona is the early happy hour 3-6 (I think..lol) and the late one 7-10pm, with an allday Happy Hour on Sunday.  If you are in Summerlin...GO HERE :)"}
{"text":"Thought we would try this location out after doing some shopping.   We sat down at about 7:45pm at a high top table in the bar.  Our server was Samantha.  We decided not to have a glass of wine with dinner and decided to go straight to our entrees.  It was at that point that we no longer \"felt the love\" from our server.  Didn't realize that if you don't order alcohol and run up a bill that you won't get friendly service.  However, I did order the $31 New York Strip steak so it wasn't like we were being cheap diners.  The food came out and was delicious.  The garlic mashed potatoes were amazing!   Our server stopped by a couple of times to see how things were which was nice but we could tell we burned a bridge by no ordering a drink.  The third time she stopped by the table, we indicated we were done and our plates were empty and asked for our check.  She didn't take our plates which surprised us so I decided to stack the plates so when she brought the check back she might be able to see them better.  No such luck.  She dropped off the check and left, leaving the stack of dirty plates still remaining in the middle of our table.  My jaw hit the floor.  I took the high road and still tipped her 15% despite wanting to leave her zero for the lack of any kindness during our meal.  I hope she sees this and invests that tip money in some class and etiquette when it comes to serving the public.  A smile and showing that you care about a customer's dining experience goes a long way.  For the lack of service, we give you two yellow stars."}
{"text":"I've been going to this location for a long while now. I'm a huge fan of sushi and in the 7 years we've been going to this Kona we have never had a bad experience. My husband and I love the patio seating. It's great to just sit back, relax and have a nice afternoon lunch or casual dinner. If you are a fan of sushi I highly recommend that Dragon Roll."}
{"text":"This place is nice and family friendly. The food was great, but their selection is slim. The one thing I did not like were all the TVs. I'm not a fan of the sports bar atmosphere and that's a bit how it felt with all the TVs. I don't want to be watching football on a night out with my husband. The service was prompt and fine. I wasn't wowed or impressed, but overall it was good."}
{"text":"One of my favorite happy hour spots in the valley. Good food at great prices! The potstickers are fantastic, nice and meaty. I wasn't a huge fan of the bulgogi tacos but my husband enjoyed them. The kiddo liked the margherita pizza. It's a pretty popular happy hour so i would suggest getting there a bit before it starts if you don't want to sit outside in the summer months."}
{"text":"Marking 3 stars because the food was actually pretty good! Definitely recommend the crunchy crab roll and the lobster mac & cheese. Despite the food, service was pretty poor. Came for a late lunch while the restaurant was practically empty and had to flag our waitress to get service"}
{"text":"It was really busy on a Saturday evening so my boyfriend and I sat in the bar area upstairs. Little cold since the bar opens up to the patio seating outside. The BBQ pork sliders were one of the most delicious dishes I've ever eaten and even though you only got two (for $12.50) it came with equally delicious sweet potato fries and I ended up going home with leftovers."}
{"text":"The restaurant has a nice layout and staff is pretty friendly however, food fell extremely short. My kids both ordered off of the kid's menu. It was $6.50 for an entree, 2 sides, and a drink. Good price but mac and cheese was terrible. The sauce almost tasted like a bland garlic alfredo that had no resemblance of cheese whatsoever. We got calamari which was almost inedible. The spicy aioli was ok but the calamari was underdone and the batter had no flavor. The batter had an odd texture, maybe just needed to be cooked s little longer, but we left over half of the order in the plate. We also got the smoked gouda fondue. It did not resemble a fondue at all! It was clumpy and cold. The little candle would've never gotten it to a fondue consistency at all.  Taco trio was just not good and the Las Vegas roll was lacking in flavor. All in all, I most likely won't come back. Ambiance was nice, food was pretty terrible."}
{"text":"First time in Las Vegas decided to try Kona. It was relatively empty and our server/bartender was pleasant. We ordered two drinks, a strawberry basil lemonade margerita and raspberry crush. Mine was delicious but I tasted no alcohol, didn't even get a buzz. My husbands was very potent and much more boozy. We also got the las vegas roll, which was amazing and served warm. Our shrimp penne pasta we split because the portion was huge! Garlic bread was a little cold, but otherwise flavorful. Overall would recommend and go back!"}
{"text":"This is my No. 1 Happy Hour go to spot.  The menu is extensive and varied.  I think I've tried everything on the menu including the various sushi rolls, the sliders, calamari, flat bread pizzas and the lettuce wraps.  My drink of choice is the strawberry blended margarita.  My only complaint is it does get busy and if you're not early it becomes sort of a stalk your table situation but with a little patience you're sure to get a seat.  And they are one of the only places I know that does an all day Happy Hour on a Sunday."}
{"text":"I should update last night's Kona Grill tip to \"Supposedly, the Macadamia Nut Chicken is off the charts!\".  My parents had been talking about this signature dish for days, and due to their constant urging (and the fact that it is Kona's most popular dish) I went ahead and ordered it.  Let me start by saying that the accompaniments were insannnnne.  Garlic mashed and green beans are the standard sides for this dish.  I think I could mow those down with every meal for the rest of my life, SO GOOD.  The Macadamia Nut Chicken itself is lightly breaded and covered in some sort of light gravy-ish sauce that had good flavor, but was a bit creamy and heavy for my liking.  I ended up taking half of the dish home (thumbs up for big portions), and scraped as much of the sauce off as I could because I figured it would most likely be yucky when leftover.  The service was quite good, although we sat for about 5 minutes before being greeted; we were busy chatting away though, so that didn't really bother us.  I ordered a green tea and (not realized that I had to specify the temperature) received an iced green tea when our drinks were delivered.  I apologized for being an ethnocentric Canadian and explained that I had meant a hot tea; within one minute the server brought me a hot tea and reassured me it was no problem at all.  Our food took no more than ten minutes to arrive after ordering, and our dessert was speedy as well.  The menu had an amazing offering of sushi and sashimi that I would definitely try on my next visit (5 pieces of Salmon for $10 was the most expensive variety), they also have a full serve sushi bar that sits in front of a floor to ceiling fish tank!  The decor in the dining room is fairly casual, standard booths and tables, nothing to write home about.  The bar and patio area however was packed (opted for the DR because I was accompanied by the parentals), and looked to have a great happy hour going on."}
{"text":"First time....Bomb! Avocado chicken club sandwich was awesome! Adrienne suggested we sub macadamia crusted chicken and gave me this incredible sauce to dip it into...just go in and ask for her as your server and you will not be disappointed. She went the extra mile and then some! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My party of 6 was tired, since we just returned from the Grand Canyon in time for dinner, but, we did not have a dinner reservation. So we collectively opted for this restaurant based on Yelp and Trip Advisor reviews. Although we did not have reservations, when we arrived around 7:30pm I felt we were lucky to be seated outside almost immediately. The restaurant offers both inside and outside perimeter dinning. The weather in November was spectacular for outside dinning.  My party of 6 enjoyed our dinners here. I would return."}
{"text":"The food is great but the service is horrible! My fiancé and I went for happy hour. We were seated in the bottom part of the restaurant and weren't even told that only the patio and lounge area had happy hour. So we moved upstairs and it took them about 10 minutes to take our order. We noticed the servers standing around talking and texting. The food came before we even were given napkins and chopsticks. It took us forever just to get a refill of water. We looked around and our waiter was just hanging out with the other waiters talking. They all seemed to know a few girls at the bar so the staff paid more attention to those girls than the customers in the lounge. One of the girls said hello to another staff member who looked like a manager and grabbed his butt. The man did not stop her. It just seemed really inappropriate. I understand talking and playing around with people you know but when it is affecting your work then you need to buckle down. They make you feel like you're wasting their time. We won't be going back anytime soon, at least to that location. Food was good, service was horrible."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend from college and his fiancée and would gladly come back. They have really great happy hour drink and food specials. I had a sake sangria which was light and fruity. For my meal I ordered the potstickers--so delish! --and one of their sushi rolls. Our server was quick and helpful. It is also located at the Scottsdale mall so it makes a good pre or post shopping stop for food."}
{"text":"Love that they opened one up in this area!! We went on a Friday night and it was busy but we ended up being able to grab some seats at the patio side of the bar--probably my favorite place to sit anyways. They were blasting music so it was a little hard to hear but we got used to it quick and it made for a fun atmosphere anyways. Not sure if it was as loud in the main restaurant area.   The bartenders were incredibly friendly and did a great job at checking on us. We started of with a couple of beers then had some sushi. So good! My fiancé said he enjoyed his Vegas roll but preferred the one at Ra. I on the other hand enjoyed my spicy yellowtail and loved the Angry Edamame so much I ordered a second bowl.   Our waitress/bartender was really friendly and made a great Cosmopolitan and a very strong but somehow delicious Old Fashion for my fiancé. This place was so loud, busy and energetic on a Friday night. Definitely a different vibe than the rest of Scottsdale Quarter but I enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"Started with the Avocado Egg Roll, I had thec Basil Pesto Linguine and  S order Pad Thai Noodles. The food was about a 3 - service was a 3+ ..overall for me Kona Grill at Boca Park is my preferred location."}
{"text":"Happy hour was very good and they make good moscow mule drinks !!!! Potstickers dry inside with no special taste , service was good and sushi ok !!!"}
{"text":"Well I guess I can cross kona grill off on my go to place for sushi.  First off I absolutely hate that they only offer happy hour on the patio with about 10 tables and about 8 more inside that would only fit 4 people anyways we finally get our table that only had 2 chairs at it but I wasn't going to wait another 30 mins so my party of 4 goes to the table and 2 of us sit down and the other 2 stand until our waitress comes over and we ask for 2 more chairs and she said \"no that's all we have. You guys can go ask other tables if you want.\" And she walks away, the more I thought about how rude that was that we have to go scavenge for chairs the more I didn't want to be there, my boyfriend finally rounded up 2 chairs and we got sit down. So we finally get our food and I was so disappointed, they cut down on their food alot! We got half off what we usually get on the calamari and it being cold didn't help and the rolls were so tiny! Ugh I was just fed up with being here. We get our bill mine was $22 something and then my sisters was about $23 and she gave the waitress $40 and we asked for the change back because we were not leaving a $17 tip so she comes back and she only gives us $7 back and of course she doesn't come back to our table so we have to go find someone so we can get our right change back and the waitress comes back and says sorry I don't know how I added so horribly, she leaves and we check our change and we only get $16 back, long story short we gave up on kona grill and their crap service."}
{"text":"Great Moscow Mule, sushi and our server was awesome BUT when the manager wants to turn on the \"misters\" above ur head and meal at full speed and the only 2 tables sitting outside weren't happy he should had shut them off! It wasn't even that hot outside!"}
{"text":"The food was absolutely great!!! My waiter Dai was freaking amazing I will definitely be back!!!!"}
{"text":"BACKGROUND   The first time I ever went to Kona Grill was many years ago, on a date night, at the Chandler Mall location, when Kona Grill was first on the scene.  I liked the edgy décor with flash fish tanks, et cetera.  But that was before there were so many sushi options, so the Kona Grill meant a bit more than it does now.  Now there's a sushi bar in every strip mall, usually owned and operated by \"locals,\" and thus, the \"chain\" sushi establishments are taking heat.  Whatever. I can remember the past, and I thank Kona Grill for their contributions and good times before everyone and their mother owned a sushi bar.  This Scottsdale location is the original, where it all started; hence, it was \"local\" at sometime before the concept was franchised out, and is still \"local\" if you think about it.  Anyway, who cares about all \"chain\" drama if the food is good and the service is excellent? Not me, that's for sure.  KONA GRILL  Kona Grill is a midrange casual restaurant company based in Scottsdale, Arizona, serving American cuisine, sushi, and cocktails.   The company owns and operates 46 restaurants in 23 United States and Puerto Rico, as well as three international locations operating under franchise agreements.  Kona Grill first opened its doors on September 18, 1998 at the Scottsdale Fashion Square.   The restaurant's predecessor was a sushi concept called Sushi on Shea that opened in Scottsdale in 1994.   Restaurant founder, Michael McDermott, decided to create Kona Grill with more American-themed menu items.   The new restaurant was made to have a modern ambiance. McDermott sold Sushi on Shea in 2002 to focus on expanding Kona Grill.  Kona Grill went public on August 16, 2005 with an initial public offering of $11 per share on the NASDAQ. The company raised $28.8 million and grew its restaurant base to 9 locations by December 31, 2005.  THE STORY & SERVICE EXPERIENCE  I was shopping at the gorgeous Scottsdale Fashion Mall, and stopped by this location of Kona Grill.  I sat at the sushi bar, and chatted with the sushi chef. I enjoyed myself.  The waitress brought over a Chambord margarita, which I sipped with my jalapeño roll. I especially liked their scratch-made citrus soy sauce, which I thought was very original and tasty.  CONCLUSION  Kona Grill has consistent good sushi, excellent cocktails, with great service. This location is my favorite so far. Kona Grill gets my vote.  4/5 RECOMMEND  OF NOTE  *This location is inside the Scottsdale Fashion Mall, so parking is in the garage.  *For more information: konagrill.com"}
{"text":"BACKGROUND  It's been a couple years since my original review, so I thought I'd take a second to make an update.  As I mentioned in my review of the Scottsdale location of Kona Grill, I was wowed by the edgy décor, and fun vibe, when I first visited this location, many years ago. That's when Kona Grill was first in the scene.  Although there are now many new flashy pop up sushi bars, Kona Grill deserve a shout out for being one of the first, and for it's consistency over the years.  This Chandler Mall location is the closest to my house, and my friend, Eva's, favorite location, hence this is the Kona Grill location I've been to the most.

THE STORY & SERVICE EXPERIENCE  The last time I was at this Kona Grill Location, a group of us popped in for a light snack and some cocktails.  We usually sit at the bar, but since there were more of us, we picked a booth.  Although still cute, the décor looked a little rough this time. It seems like this location might need a little TLC.  Otherwise, everything was on point.  We ordered cocktails, shared some appetizers, and had a great time.  The service was fantastic.  CONCLUSION   I like that I know what to expect at Kona Grill; cute décor, great cocktails, good food, and fast service.   4/5 RECOMMEND  OF NOTE  *Plenty of parking our front.   *Valet Parking Available.   *For more information: konagrill.com  ***************ORIGINAL REVIEW*************** *************************************************  BACKGROUND   Kona Grill at Chandler Fashion Center never disappoints!  Kona Grill is a casual sophisticated restaurant and bar which is perfect for a date, a party or whatever.   KONA GRILL  Although there are 4 Phoenix valley locations (Chandler Fashion Center, Scottsdale Fashion Square, High Street, Santan Village), I always eat at the Chandler location.   Kona Grill is modern American cuisine prepared from scratch in their kitchens. They also have an impressive, extensive sushi menu with fresh fish flown in daily.    CONCLUSION   Although there is an impressive full menu and sushi bar, I absolutely love their Happy Hour food & drink menu/hours. (see pics)  5/5 RECOMMEND   OF NOTE  *Happy Hours: Mon - Fri 3pm - 7pm Mon - Thur 9pm - 11pm Fri/Sat 10pm - 12am Sat 11am - 2pm Sun ALL DAY  *Dinning Hours Mon - Thurs 11am - 10pm Fri/Sat 11am - 11pm Sun 11am - 10pm  *Kona Grill is located at the Southeast corner of the Chandler Fashion Center at the entrance to the Village, directly across from the Harkins Theatre.   *Valet parking is available right in front of main entrance.   *For more information: KonaGrill.com"}
{"text":"Although this place used to be better. The sushi rolls we tried were so good and my toddler lunch box was fantastic; salmon cooked to perfection and the bear made out of an orange was such a cute touch. Atmosphere is ok at lunch time. Place is clean"}
{"text":"I had a celebration dinner for a party of nine people. We got there and got sat right away. The server could use a little bit of personality unless attitude like he didn't want to be there or we were putting him out for sitting in his section. We checked in on yelp and got a free appetizer per person so I'm sure that didn't help his attitude much. For my appetizer I had the avocado eggrolls which were good as always! For dinner I had sushi; a coconut shrimp roll which was goid as well! Our server started to loosen up towards the end of the experience, naturally when he is about to drop the check. Not a bad experience overall."}
{"text":"Exceptional sushi, drinks, & service from Christa last night. My fiance & I came in about an hour before closing after walking around Fashion Show for a while. The interior is beautiful and dreamy, with stainless steel tables, dark colors, blue ambient lighting, and a large aquarium that is thankfully not overcrowded with fish so it didn't look tacky. We were greeted, seated, then met by Christa within 5 minutes. She was the right amount of friendly & efficient. She made great recommendations. We were only looking for something light and a drink or two, so I got the tuna tower (wonton crisps on the side) along with a cocktail (forgot the name, unfortunately) & he went with a basic california roll and some Stella.   Our drinks came out quickly and were beautifully presented with waters on the side. Our food took some time but also came out right when we started getting ravenous. I had expected my tuna tower to resemble a messy pile on the plate which I could dig into, but it was much more tower-like than that. It was an underwhelming small dense cylinder of sushi rice, mixed crab meat, avocados, and raw tuna topped with micro greens and roe. It really did look small, but I found that when I took it apart it was well-worth the $16 cost. Because it was so incredibly dense, it filled me up and the wonton crisps were a spot-on recommendation by Christa. I crave it again as I write this. Even the california roll was good. Would definitely get both if I return. We got two more Stellas.   Overall, great experience, a bit pricey but that is to be expected, so we left a good tip. Will definitely come back soon."}
{"text":"A lot of hype from this place I decided to try it out. It was a Sunday which is all day happy hour from what I was told. The hostess rushed us to a table at the bar and we soon learned a table was a very hot commodity (everyone after us were waiting to get a table).  We were not given any menu or anything so we just ordered from some table flyer.   What we ordered:  Sushi-Crab Crunch Roll, California Roll Avocado Roll Bulgogi Tacos Blue Moon  Well I will say the presentation of the food was nice. The sushi will not be a choice I make again. Very very bland, as if it was picked up from the grocery store across the parking lot and placed on a plate, I'm sorry chefs. The avocado rolls were tasty and actually paired nice the the bulgogi tacos. The tacos were very very sweet that I was thankful of the avocado rolls to balance it out. Blue Moon was well, blue moon but I guess not informed it wasn't on happy hour, oh well that's fine.   **It was very busy and I wouldn't mind attempting this place for a second time in hopes for better."}
{"text":"Nothing really stood out to me when I tried about 5 of their sushi rolls. In general it's a good place to eat, but if you are looking to for amazing food. I would go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Have ordered take out but first time eating there. We were pleasantly surprised. Usually HH foods are subpar but I would have ordered from menu what was on HH.  Flatbread was really great. As yellowtail sashimi ( small portion but for the $ can't complain ). Lettuce wraps were great. Loved the avocado egg rolls. Cuban sandwich was pretty good for AZ rendition. Only thing we would not order again was potstickers which were really doughy. Will be back for dinner entrees ! !!"}
{"text":"My sis and I stopped here for lunch Saturday around noon.  The restaurant was a little dead for a weekend, but this place gets jumpin' weekend evenings.  It has an \"outdoor\" patio which gives you a great view of the valet and parking lot.  (Ha Ha.)  There is also bar seating, bar table seating, tables and booths.  The decor is elegant asian inspired, with lots of dark wood and dark colors.  What about the food, you ask???  We started with the edamame.  They serve it warm and salted and provide an extra bowl to get rid of the empty pods.  Peach tea for me, H2O for the sistah.  I ordered from the sushi menu - the usual CA roll, Salmon nigiri, and ordered the Crunchy Crab roll which was covered in crumbled Panko breadcrumbs and sweet eel sauce.   The miso soup was very yummy.  Warm and just salty enough with nice pieces of tofu.  It is served in these cute little cups with lids.    My sis had the Asparagus salad which was tossed in this yummy sweet vinaigrette dressing.  The tomatoes were thin and warm (don't know if it was a warm plate, or they heat them up) but it brought out the flavor of the tomato.  Our server's name was December.  I kid you not, it was printed on the check.  She was helpful, sweet, and checked on us just enough.  I would actually ask for her next time we go.  She said the Mojitos were sweet and yummy, but we were driving, so another day...  The sushi is a little pricey.  I think they have better prices during happy hour on sushi.  Next time..."}
{"text":"Walking the mall, came across Kona Grill. Wanted/needed to munch and have some wine, not necessarily a heavy meal. As a sit down proper restaurant in the mall (as opposed to the food courtyard) it was ok.  Our server Miss Aden was the highlight of our stay. She is an upbeat wonderful server with the ability to be helpful without hovering. Her wonderful attitude and service was great!   Using the Yelp app we received a free appetizer,,, so Thanks Yelp! We ordered the Spicy Lettuce Wraps which turned out to be fantastic! The taste was wonderful and the cucumber side salad fit perfectly when a cool-down was needed cause the spicy was hot... Nice! Additionally ordered Spicy Shrimp Tempura and this was also very good~had a great kick. Guess we should have stopped there but had ordered a bottle of Petite Syrah that we had not yet finished killing; so on we go! California Roll and Yellowtail Sushi,,, hmmm? Looked a bit sad (please see pic) and so was I :(  Would return as the menu has lots to offer but most likely will skip the aforementioned sushi. Miss Aden was so accommodating, we'll be coming back to this Kona Grill."}
{"text":"I have been going to Kona Grill for 10 years now and it was one of my favorite places to hang out with my friends and have some happy hour food and drinks. With that being said, the place has been really going downhill for quite some time now and today was my last time there. The food is always hit or miss and so is the service. Today there was literally 1/2\" of rice on my super sloppily put together sushi rolls, the flat bread was burnt and of corse the classic lipstick mark on my martini glass. They also keep raising the happy hour prices and lowering the food and drinks quality. There were tons of flies and bees all over the outdoor patio because the place has gotten so sticky and nobody cares enough to clean it thoroughly. This was super annoying and disturbing and no one could really enjoy the food or drinks. 2 years ago there were people always waiting for a table for happy hour because the place was packed and so much fun; today there were just 2 occupied tables outside... After being super distracted by the bees we decided to move inside the restaurant but our server was nowhere to be found. We just started moving our plates and drinks and when he saw us he just sat there and watched us doing it without moving a finger!  RIP Kona Grill, you used to be the best spot in Summerlin and now just a sad going downhill crappy restaurant..."}
{"text":"Ordered the Sushi sampler which included a salad.  Excellent for what I wanted. Traditional more suitable for me. Large pieces of fish and very fresh. Service was awesome."}
{"text":"Did not like this place at all. The sushi was small and not very good, the sushi from grocery stores tastes better than this place. I also ordered the pot stickers which were terrible I had to send them back."}
{"text":"The location is very close to Total Wine and More, so it was only a matter of time before i went here....and Im happy I did. First, the coconut sushi roll was amazing. I could have ordered 4 of those and been happy, but i couldn't pass up the soft shelled crab sandwich! If you like soft shelled crab, then eating a whole one stuffed between two pieces of bread should only increase your love of it. Creme brulee  was the dessert of the day. I dont even remember how it tasted due to being overshadowed by the awesome coconut sushi roll! The price is up there, but considering I ate seafood it was not unexpected. Loved it."}
{"text":"Super disappointed in my take out. I ordered the oriental salad with the macadamia nut chicken and avocado egg rolls. The chicken was perfectly cooked and they did package it seperate the which I appreciated but the salad had no red cabbage, no almonds and about 4 pieces of shredded carrot and one piece of a red onion in it. The lettuce in general was shriveled and not very fresh. The avocado egg rolls which are usually my favorite were brown and soggy. I do realize they could become soggy if packaged too early but it only took me 5 minutes to get to my destination so seeing that my $30 dinner was of such low quality was a real disappointment. This place used to be up to par in every area and so far the past year or so has been disappointing nearly every time. Hopefully they get some better oversight going."}
{"text":"Came in for Happy Hour. $5 mules! How do you say no? Happy Hour is in the patio area. I really like this place because you can wear shorts and a t-shirt in the patio all the way to a nice cocktail dress in the downstairs dining area.   Appetizer: Avocado Egg Rolls Delicious and really taste with the dipping sauce. However, I thought their happy hour portion was over priced for 2 rolls.   Appetizer: Margarita Flat Bread Meh, it wasn't anything spectacular. For the same price, I would order a second plate of avocado egg rolls.   I know this is a sushi place, but wasn't feeling sushi at that moment. The restaurant was picking up in business at 7pm, so I'm sure the sushi is delicious.   PS: Yelp check-in doesn't work during happy hour."}
{"text":"I frequent Kona grill often and always return for the service! Caitlin is our favorite!!! Not only is she attentive she anticipates our needs based on what we like to eat and drink with great recommendations. We always sit in the bar which is usually very busy especially during happy hour, she still manages to give flawless service. The wait times on food can be lengthy but we know it has nothing to do with our service. I highly recommend Kona and Caitlin to anyone wanting to relax and enjoy a glass of saki and sushi or wine on Wednesday or a really great burger and cold beer!"}
{"text":"This place has a great happy hour with a bunch of food specials and a great drink...sake sangria.  It is about 95 degrees out and the misters on the top floor patio make it perfect outside.  Had some standard sushi rolls (crab crunch) and chicken satay...food is always tasty and the wait staff is always attentive.  I have never actually eaten a sit down dinner here, but I'm sure it would be just as good.  Free wifi as well with a good enough connection to watch MLB."}
{"text":"We've been here a couple of times, but just tried their happy hour for the first time, and I must say....I'm a fan!  $3 Margaritas and lots of cheap food items.  No wonder the patio/lounge is always packed!  We got there about 4:30 and we snagged one of a few empty tables, but anyone coming around 5 had to stand by the entrance an wait for a table to open up.  Because it's soooo busy during happy hour, service can be a little slow, but it's not because they're not trying.  Margs were decent and the sushi rolls I had were tasty!  We'll definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"We really only go to Kona for happy hour.  Avocado egg rolls are awesome.  The BF loves the BBQ chicken flatbread.  Not the best sushi, but decent for the HH prices.  I have been for lunch too and the pick two lunch special is a pretty good value.  All in all, a decent place."}
{"text":"Came with my son and husband. Had a dragon roll spicy salmon roll, crab crunch roll, and Atlantic roll. A bowl of chicken chili and miso soup. Finished off with snickers ice cream pie. Food was excellent although the spicy salmon roll was more tangy than spicy. Which was perfect to me. Have come here for happy hour on girls night and love the selection. The remodel is nice and now offers more room."}
{"text":"I am the weird girl who orders a steak at a sushi place. I'm not a sushi person but my boyfriend is. The steak needed more flavor. I wasn't going to complain because this isn't a steak place. My boyfriend had the spider role. He loved it. The presentation came out nice.   Kona has a great check in offer. Either a free appetizer or sushi roll. You have to remind them before the check comes, they like to sneak in the full priced roll if you choose that option.   I normally get the flat bread BBQ pizza which is really good. I get it without the onions. Next time I will stick with my normal but it was  nice to try something new."}
{"text":"Awesome happy hour! Great service from wait staff. But spicy tuna roll was like mashed potato bland no flavor. But all rest of the food rocked.  Mgr. Scrooge and run the wait staff shame on him. They sent me a $15 happy birthday then after I ate said it wasn't good at happy hour. Pissed me off. If the food was so good I'd find a new happy hour."}
{"text":"Beware!!!!!  There is no alcohol in their cocktails.I got a mojito and it did not have any alcohol in it.When I asked to order another one with more alcohol, they said I need to pay extra to get more alcohol.I just wanted to get regular mojito, not like this all ice and water one.When I talked to the manager , she told me she is sorry, she can not do anything , it is the company policy.I think they should write on the menu, because of our company policy our drinks  does not contain any alcohol..."}
{"text":"This was my 3rd trip to Kona Grill and i had a 5 star experience this time!  We started with the Potstickers which were very delicious we scarfed those done right away lol.   For dinner we decided just to do just sushi the 2 rolls i remember were the Spider roll and the Las vegas roll both were very very delicious but my favorite by far was the Las Vegas roll OMG this roll was so mouth watering and yummy. Its deep fried goodness mixed with there yummy eel sauce was a perfect combo.  Overall I had such a great experience here delicious good quality food, I loved our waitress she was so awesome and very attentive.   I cant wait to return here"}
{"text":"It was our first visit to Las Vegas, and our first night in Las Vegas. I wanted to find great food for prices that were not insane. I walked into one of the big fancy hotels and spoke to a concierge. He recommended a sushi restaurant with poor reviews on Yelp. I knew I could trust Yelp, so I investigated on my own.  Thanks goodness for Yelp! I can always trust Yelp.  For starters, the servers were professional, helpful and gave us excellent suggestions for their best dishes. The food was fresh and delicious and perfect. Once we finished eating everything that we ordered, we ordered some more. I will not say that it was inexpensive, but compared to the prices of meals reported by friends and family members who had visited Las Vegas, I would call it a bargain, especially considering the food quality and service.  And speaking of service, our server spent a great deal of time suggesting our itinerary for the next few days. I guess I had not done enough homework prior to arriving. We told her that we did not want to gamble. There was plenty to do in Las Vegas! Our server was absolutely wonderful, the best tour guide anyone could ask for! All of her advice was perfect!  Overall, a very highly recommended restaurant. I was a little worried about ordering fish in the middle of the desert, but it was amazing."}
{"text":"Came in for a little lunch lady with my wife. Ordered off the happy hour menu that really simply offers smaller portions. Good for lunch. Little pricey on the non-happy hour drinks but much better than the location in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Wow,,,,this was one of the worst experiences ever.  We to have some lunch here, which was highly recommended by some friends.  We sat down outside on the patio...waited 5 minutes to get menus.  OK, I understand, if they were busy, which they we not.  Ordered a couple of water, so we could look over the drinks and food.  When the water came, my literally had floating objects in it.  OK, ordered drinks, then food.  Here is where stuff gets bad.  Like the 5 minutes for menus and floaties in the water wasnt bad enough.  44 minutes later, we get our food.  1 sushi roll, and I chicken wrap.  44 minutes.  NOT ONCE did the waitress come by to check on us.  No second drink, not sorry for the wait, not sign of her at all.  Food came, it was good, nothing worth the 44 minute wait.  Of course we were done eating prior to the waitress coming by to check on us.  So, I had my card ready, cause over an hour for a quick lunch simply did not fit into my schedule.  I wont be back.  There are way too many places in Scottsdale that provide good service and great food.  I was not expecting anything other than good food and average service.  AVERAGE service would have made this review 3 starts,. but I guess shame on me for just looking for average service in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Upon entering the restaurant,  the hostess said \"uber eats?\"   Thought. Hmmm. Do I look like an uber eats driver?  Maybe I do..  Who cares.  I'm hungry.  I sit down, wait 20 minutes, no water,  no hello. No nothing..  Guess this is a snobby north Scottsdale establishment.  Not into that.  Will be my last foray into the kona grill.  If I'm going to spend that much on a meal, would prefer that judgement not be a part of the process.."}
{"text":"The food is always good, but unfortunately the service is terrible. We always have to wait 5 minutes or more at our table before even being acknowledged. The service is not friendly, accommodating, or fast.  The sushi rolls are always fresh, and I like that they offer vegetarian and vegan entrees."}
{"text":"We were Kona Grill lovers in the past but after visiting recently we dont want to anymore.  Our server took a while to give us attention. Our food took forever.  My husband's second order of beer never came. I had to get up and get my own napkin from the bar cuz she never came with it.  A lady on a near by table ended up leaving cuz her server never came to take her order and kept saying I will be right with you. The selection wasnt the same anymore although it still a good deal. We ate our order got up and went to Osaka's late night happy hour still."}
{"text":"I never give any place 5 stars unless the food itself blows my mind but honestly--the entire situation here is worth breaking this little rule.   Jason McAtee (yup got his full name as far as I know, he was that cool) was probably one of the best servers I've had in a long time in LA or Vegas. He suggested the Tuna Tataki roll which was much better than I expected for some random restaurant I walked in to grab a drink along my trip down the strip. It's likely their best roll, hands down! Thanks, Jason! He's personable, and honest and valid recommendations.   We were so into the Tuna Tataki that we had the Yamada Roll...which was just okay--not sure if I'd get it again, but if you like \"sweet and sour\" type things it is fine. Also *disclaimer* softened the blow to get it gratis from the Yelp check-in deal. Happy hour sake bomb is totally worth it BTW.   So not anywhere near Hawaiian food or the best sushi spot I've been to but I was genuinely and pleasantly suprised by 1) Jason and 2) the Tuna Tataki. Want a no-frills Vegas dinner with screens to boot? This is your spot.   Also got the Kona Calamari. Too much for 2 in my opinion but I like it with the special Japanese sauce."}
{"text":"Love this place!  No trip to Vegas is complete without spending some time with family at Kona Grill during happy hour!  Great prices, awesome appetizer selection and love the Chambord Margaritas!"}
{"text":"Great food went to Kona Monday for lunch and the food was delicious.  Got to thank the chef Marc for the superb food my friends and I had.  Really nice person. Very nice place to come."}
{"text":"We had lunch today at the fashion show mall and had the potstickers, and egg rolls.  Some sushi, and Cuban sandwich and Kona club.  Great service and we were able to meet the Executive Chef Luis.  Thanked him for the great food and his team does a fantastic job.  We will come back again."}
{"text":"Most chains are disappointing, but Kona grill was fantastic! I'll actually say I was surprised especially since they just opened. Today we ventured into the rolls and we're happy to have a great turn out. Their signature rolls are perfect size, fresh fish and flavored. The waitress was sweet and attentive. Glassware was near frozen and provided excellent cold drinks. The angry edamame was maybe too sprint for me!   Over all two thumps up!"}
{"text":"The service was awful, we waited 30 min for a server. She was also very awkward because she knew we were waiting. Moreover, did not ask what we wanted to drink. Don't recommend this place at all."}
{"text":"I think after giving Kona Grill a few tries, my rating still stands. During my last visit, I tried to mix up the variety a bit, and my dad ordered the hawaiian ribeye and my sister and I shared a lobster and truffle mac and cheese. I think the mac and cheese was yum! Do expect it to be filling, but finding nice lobster chunks that evens out the pasta ratio is a big plus! The ribeye was good. It had a big pineapple slice that the ribeye sits on. The season was a decent taste as well.   Service was kind of disappointing being that it wasn't busy at all at the dining area, but our server Justen managed to rarely check up on us, and then after flagging him down for refills, forgot that we requested refills."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend go here at least once a week, if not more! We love their happy hour, not only are their prices great but their food is fantastic. I always get the chicken and shrimp lettuce wraps and he always gets the chicken skewers, along with some of their sushi rolls.  We drive all the way from Henderson because its so good! Can you please open one up in the Green Valley area please?! Wait... that could be bad lol"}
{"text":"Great place. Sushi was not wrapped up tied enough so it tended to fall apart. Also the roll was a bit thick that it is hard to fit it in your mouth (yeah, that's what she said:)"}
{"text":"So after writing my last review on kona, I had got in contact with the district manager by far is extremely helpful and apologetic for the previous incident. I find it helpful when managers apologize for their staff and not the staff thinking they run the show and call all the shots.  I am hoping that when we go on our usual Tuesday's the bartender has been moved to different days but if i happen to run into him again in the future i hope to god he calls for a manager before he tries to offer us a closed dim lit restaurant again for two people of a usual 4+ party.  IT just boggled my mind, because as many times as i have told the story everyone has said \"WHAT? when you are at a bar you aren't allowed to sit at the bar but you are allowed to be behind your friend/parent whatever at another table behind or away from within a certain distance.\"   Anyhow the food is decent and i will definitely be returning for our happy hour Tuesday run as usual.  =]"}
{"text":"Been to a million different Kona Grills throughout AZ and beyond...  Out of all of them, each experience, and every server that has come and gone... ALEX was the best. If you go to this Kona either enjoy LEAH behind the bar, or ALEX as a server.  I'm typing all bold so that you remember these names!  Great food, excellent drinks, and an awesome Happy Hour.  Cinco starz."}
{"text":"Had a great experience tonight! Our server Ian was attentive, knowledgeable of the menu and very friendly. The manager, Patrick made sure we were taken care of and went over and above to ensure we had a great experience. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE!  They don't have a huge selection but I only order their konA chicken oriental salad or dinner. It's so good. I literally order it weekly. The salad is so BOMB! I recommend asking for the extra large if you really like a bigger salad. I always add chicken cuz I'm doing the paleo thing. But this os not way I love the restaurant.   I love the restaurant because if I ever have a problem they take care of it very quickly and go above and beyond to make it up to you. You just can't ask for more than that!!!"}
{"text":"Hmmm. Macademia Nut Chicken I will push on people till i am hoarse. It's fantastic and if you like mashed potatoes with lumps.. you'll be extra happy..Its the perfect dish! Beware though it's heavy so i don't suggest it for lunch. Their HH is excellent.. LOVE their scampi pizza. Salmon Wasabi sashimi & jalapeno Yellowtail sashimi ain't too shabby either."}
{"text":"My favorite local Summerlin dive bar and a restaurant. And definitely, best happy hour ever!"}
{"text":"If you're going to City North to dance, come eat here first.  Best food on High Street! The service is always  above average and Happy Hours evening & Reverse  HH are a hit!"}
{"text":"Can we use a pen and paper if you can't remember someone's order? And also why bother asking how the lunch is when you already didn't put the order in right? Thank you. We'll see if it's better next time as I live close by, it's an easy option."}
{"text":"Best Happy Hour in town..HANDS DOWN!! I went here last week with my girlfriends and the place was jumpin! Fun and lively atmosphere! They even have live music on the back patio during certain nights. The food was delicious. We had the fondue, hamburger sliders, 2 sushi rolls, and THE MOST AMAZING CARROT CAKE EVERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR Cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Surprised this place has such good reviews.  Went there with my bf and was not thrilled. We ordered two apps and two entrees and the main problem was the fruit flies...tons of them were flying all over our food and drinks. We weren't sitting at the bar (where, fine, you may expect this to happen a bit), but at a regular table. The annoying part was that a few of them flew into our bottle of wine so we notified the waitress and she spoke with the manager. We had at least half a bottle of wine left and the mgt decided to take less than half off the price of the wine. Seems tacky to me - it's not like we just didn't like it - the place wasn't clean.  The server was nice and cheerful, but the food was only so-so at best and the atmosphere in the dining room was a bit weird - very bright, screaming kids, etc.   Wouldn't return."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch on Saturday on the recommendation of my daughter, who was in the mood for sushi. It was a first for both Hubby and I and both of us enjoyed it. We started off with an appetizer of Avocado Eggrolls. They were simply delicious and my daughter just loved the honey-cilantro dipping sauce that was served with them. I wanted a combination Sashimi platter and was very disappointed that they didn't have anything like that. So instead I ordered the Yamada Roll and the Coconut Shrimp Roll. Both were good however my favorite was the Coconut Shrimp roll. The toasted macadamia nuts really made it stand out for me. Our daughter ordered the Philadelphia Roll and the Crab Crunch Roll and she said they were both really good. Hubby went with the Pad Thai with Shrimp and he enjoyed it as well. We did think it was strange however that the shrimp was little tiny cocktail type shrimp (similar to those that get freeze dried) and not regular sized shrimp. Because of this the flavor of the shrimp was lacking. Service was really good and we would like to come back one day during happy hour to take advantage of some of their great specials during this time."}
{"text":"This kona grill location is great. Love the area and the great atmosphere it has. I will say, however, I cannot believe how slow the service was.  We were there on a Friday evening and not even half the tables were full. I was with a large group from work. The server was great. He was very polite and always there when you needed him.  The drink and the food have never taken so long anywhere I have ever eaten. The server was very apologetic. The food took over a half an hour to get to the table.  Their only saving grace was the quality of food. The sushi I had was made perfectly. The presentation was beautiful.  The avocado egg rolls were great! Very tasty and filling! I also loved that they had a check in this Yelp app. I was able to get the appetizer for free after checking in!"}
{"text":"I love their happy hour. Must try the avocado egg rolls! So yummy. Also, make sure Brett makes your drinks. He's amazing and such a nice guy. He definitely made our night."}
{"text":"Happy hour rocks!! Kaitlyn was a very attentive server and a tons of fun. Great suggestions!! It was half off bottles of wine which made my night twice as fun."}
{"text":"Such a great restaurant! My husband and I have been Kona Grill fans for years. Always amazing food, drinks, great happy hour, friendly service and pleasant ambiance.  The only thing we miss is their amazingly delicious ahi tuna salad. They took it off the menu few years ago and we loved that dish so much... Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Can I say YUM! Everything I order from the starter to the dessert was great. The atmosphere was really nice also, my husband didn't wanted to go at first but after the meal he had  he rated it a 10 star."}
{"text":"My first time back since the remodel. I was really impressed on how the whole fist floor opens up. I had the jambalaya and the mango cocktail. It was great. My guest had the Asian salad with chicken. The service was great! I will be going back for happy hour this week,"}
{"text":"4/14/18 Just left kona grill in Phoenix.  Worst service ever.  If your on the mood for kona go to Chandler.  Always excellent service.  And the server has never forgotten the card in their back pocket that was given for payment like our server. Wonder if I need to cancel card to protect account. Who sticks a card in their back pocket?"}
{"text":"I rated this as \"spendy\" because the things I like tend to be a little pricier but there are plenty of more affordable option.  One of my favorite things is the sashimi combo.  It's about $30.  The best thing on the menu for meat-eaters is the pork chop... not something I would usually order in a restaurant but here... it's a yes.  I love onion rings but they don't love me but if you eat at Kona Grill you are likely to see a large stack of onion rings go by.  I've tasted one and it was yummy.   On the appetizer menu of things I can eat I particularly like the avocado egg rolls.  The bar seems kind of like a pick-up joint but I enjoy the restaurant quite a bit and service is always good and a booth is almost always available."}
{"text":"okay so let me start off by saying this place is amazing, we knew what we wanted even before really looking at the menu bc of our waitress, marty. the sushi is soooo good and also if i could recommend a dish, GET THE STEAK. nomnomnom"}
{"text":"I used to love their food but everything but the crunchy crab roll tasted weird... I'm not a sriracha or Tabasco lover.. treated like the cook added that to everything. .. even my fingers smell strange from holding the cheeseburger slider... (I sent those back)...eeeek"}
{"text":"I think this place has potential. The decor & vibe are very nice, but when I was there, service was not great. Our waiter was nice and all but it was slow and what I ordered they were out of. BF and I had a roll that was good, my sparkling wine drink with hibiscus was good (and pretty). But the \"chicken & shrimp\" lettuce wraps and the noodles w/beef we had were not."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and go to the cheesecake factory next door. This place has terrible service the food is pretty skimpy and the prices are rather expensive. Oh, and don't bother with the yelp check in they did not give me credit for the appetizer either."}
{"text":"I'd really give this 3.5 stars (sometimes a girl just needs a half), but I suppose 3 will do.  I frequented the Chandler Kona during my ASU days and recently re-visited the chain's Scottsdale location while waiting for the next showing of Atonement at Camelview with the girls.  Pros:  great place a kill a few hours, lot's of fun people watching and no-rush service.  Menu has a wide range of options, from sushi to pizza and full chicken/seafood entrees, so it's easy to please a larger group of people.  Convenient location and just easy.  Cons:  while the mall location provides lot's of people and action to watch, you can't help but feel a little Velveeta enjoying cocktails so close to a Discovery Channel Store.  Our server forgot one of our items for an hour, but the manager later waived it, so we'll call it even.  Food is consistent and good, but not mind-blowing."}
{"text":"Went here with friends a few weeks ago and had the worst customer service experience ever. My friend's order came out wrong. It had raw onions when she asked for cooked onions. Easy to remedy, right? Wrong! The waiter was instructed by his manager to inspect the burger. Then the manager insisted it was correct. Sorry, it's easy to tell raw from cooked onions. The waiter tried to do the right thing and bring what had been ordered but the manager said no. It was unbelievable! I told him I had never witnessed such a thing. I really enjoyed the eye roll he gave when we left. Yikes!"}
{"text":"Came here tonight to have dinner and some drinks with one of my friends. We chose Kona Grill because it was close by and we wanted to try a new place out. I ordered a drink, a mule, and it was very good. For a starter, I ordered the potstickers. I was disappointed in them. The sauce they came with was very bland; I actually used soy sauce instead. The dough seemed more like a pastry dough, so that was weird. The filling was pretty dry and crumbly, so once I took a bite of a potsticker the filling just spilled out. For my entree, I order the flank steak which came with mashed potatoes and glazed carrots. I really like the chimichurri sauce that the steak was served with, the carrots were delicious, and my steak was cooked perfectly. Also, the portion size was great. I would have like my starter and entree to be served apart from one another. Right after my starter was brought to the table, my entree arrived. I saw that they had butter cake on the dessert menu, but the waitress recommended the carrot cake saying it was to die for. I love carrot cake, so I decided to give it a whirl. First off, the piece they give you is huge. I could not finish it, and brought it home. The cake is good, but I wasn't the biggest fan of the frosting.  Overall, I would go here again. I would not order the potstickers ever again, and I would like to try the butter cake.  I really liked how quick our food came out, our servers were friendly and able to make recommendations, and the location is convenient."}
{"text":"Location is very nice & cozy. The food is quite to my standard; menu is impressive. decent size servings. Great drink selection. Friendly staff...   A great place for happy hour."}
{"text":"Kona Grill on High Street is a decent choice in the neighborhood, albeit a bit pricey. My partner was starving after a 9 hour chemotherapy appointment so we decided to eat out.  Our first stop was Macaroni Grill, but the 30 minute wait wasn't going to work and wouldn't have been worth it. So Kona Grill it was.  We decided to do the regular dining even though it was Happy Hour. I would recommend checking out their Happy Hour. It seems like a good deal.  We started with Satay as an appetizer, I ordered the Pad Thai and he had the Cubano sandwich. All of the food was good, but they don't really take any chances. I originally wanted the Chicken and Broccoli dish, but they don't have brown rice.   One star reduction for no brown rice and another for slow service. Overall not bad, but not great."}
{"text":"I brought my parents to this store for their anniversary dinner.  The staff and management were great.  Our drinks were delivered quickly and all of our food tasted great.  The manager Rob even came by the table and wish them a happy anniversary.  Would definitely recommend this location due to the fabulous service we received and the tasty food."}
{"text":"One of my buddies said that this is a popular hangout in Texas and mentioned about the Happy Hour deals, so we went to try it out while we were in Scottsdale. It certainly was a pretty big \"wow\" for me when we got our orders.   It is a bit of a weird setting, as the restaurant is attached to the mall, but that's not really the point. The bar is semi-dark with a good number of people (took us awhile to find a table). The \"Happy Hour Specials\" was what got my attention.  We ordered a variety of appetizers from sweet & sour chicken, sushi, dumplings, and 1/2 priced margaritas! I absolutely LOVED this place!   It's a great place to take a break after shopping. My regular margarita on the rocks probably did some good deed after an exhausting day of shopping."}
{"text":"Sad to say but,  Bad experience today, went after work to have a drink or two, and an order of sushi, I was looking for a place to have our Christmas party for our salon, with spouses a total of 103 people, There is no excuse why I had to wait for ONE order of sushi, one, for 35 minutes  The bartender was apologetic and try to tell a few employees to get my order, some one even came in to check the order receipt, to no success, 3 to 4 orders came after I pit my in, the male  bartender was too busy-giving the three gentlemen next to me free shots and free food to notice, while The female bartender was trying to gat my order to me, at the end after she took the sushi order off my bill, the order came, Did not touch it, I tipped the bartender 22% for my two drinks and left, talked to the \"manager\"  I don't want FREE food after 35 minutes I wand decent service  So we WILL  be NOT hosting our Christmas party at Boca Park Kona Grill"}
{"text":"This place was a great locals spot years ago, but you can forget that now. Slow service, expensive menu, and very little value during \"happy hour.\" They also made major changes to the menu from what I remember and my favorite items are now nowhere to be found. Also be wary of coming here in the evening when it gets chilly out. The entire place is basically open and it seems the (new?) owners don't care to invest in proper heating elements. NOT friendly to gluten free either."}
{"text":"Because this is part of the Fashion Mall I was not sure how to find it. You do not need to go through the mall. The restaurant is on street level on Las Vegas Blvd, just north of the big screens/elevator bank.  It was nice to sit outside in January in the sun and soak up the 60 degree warmth while back home temps were sub-zero. That alone added one star. I love sushi and have had it all over the world. I liked that Kona Grill had some interesting combinations of rolls. I had two rolls, one that was new to me and one I order almost everywhere I go. They were both good, but I was not blown away. The service was perfect. Kept my water filled and was very attentive without being too aggressive. I would like to try other places in Vegas for sushi next time as there are loads of options and if this is the best, the city is in bad shape."}
{"text":"Met with my cousin for lunch - and as always Kona has a good crowd - luv sitting at their patio area - great ambiance! Ordered couple sushi but the salmon salad is the best!  It's on the other side of town but it's sure worth the drive!"}
{"text":"So delicious and had great service! Would go back again 10/10 times! Prices were fair. Went during happy hour and there were plenty of food options to choose from."}
{"text":"Great sushi and drinks. I sat at the bar overlooking the strip! See Lewis there, he was excellent! Jeremy was my waiter and he was great as well!"}
{"text":"Kona's patio and bar atmosphere is nice but the service is terrible and they know it. They laugh it off because people return there for the hangout. The food is sometimes pretty good but inconsistent. The bartenders are way more interested in talking to each other than helping the guests. The management is usually NEVER to be seen EXCEPT when they turn the lights FULLY on bright the second it's 10pm, even when they have guests that have just received their dinner. So, I as well as all of the regulars I've met there just wish they cared about the huge investment they made in remodeling Kona enough to give good service."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and the presentation was beautiful.  This is the norm at this local hot spot.   We sat outside on the patio on a beautiful Friday evening, it was busy but no wait time.  The server, Mark, was wonderful, very helpful, and available when needed.  The caterpiller roll featured eel and avocado.  The sunshine roll is spicy salmon topped with lemon.  hamachi kyuri is sashimi of yellowtail in ponzu sauce.  Finally we left our last selection to the discretion of the chef.  We recieved crab wrapped in salmon.  All four were enjoyed with a couple of beers in ice cold glasses.  Overall a wonderful meal, we will be back."}
{"text":"Pretty good happy hour! Didn't try the sushi but had a delicious martini and loved our large saki bombers!!!"}
{"text":"I love everything about this place! It's in a great location - San Tan Village on the corner. You can sit inside in main restaurant, inside in the bar area or outside on the patio. Even in the summer you can sit on the outside patio because the misters keep you cool. The atmosphere is fun, it's always busy when we go. The sushi is really good and so is the Macadamia Nut Chicken dish, the garlic mashed potatoes are so delicious! I really like the margarita's here and the angry edamame is AMAZING!!! Their service is great, very attentive and quick to serve you drinks and food!"}
{"text":"Mia is a great bartender. Glen was the other guy....peeeeuuuuuu! This guy should be doing his time at a convent. He had NO personality. As a bartender...he has no idea that's what the job requires. Just saying.  Food is good and happy hour is also good!! We love this place, but GLEN made me give it 3 stars. He's that bad!!!"}
{"text":"I dislike chain restaurants, BUT this one was no ordinary chain. It's a lil Hawaii in the middle of the freezing desert.   I ordered the ahi appetizer and a salad. My friend ordered the Ahi burger, not only did I not share my food, I also stole half of his food and ate that too. Hey, I'm helping him lose weight!"}
{"text":"Great service. We were party for 8 include two kids on monday lunch. Our server was very attentive. We never asked refills, she split foods for sharing. (forgot her name :/) The only thing was their selections of sushi. It was just typical fish and there was no special \"Neta\". But I guess it's okay to have business in this area. four starts overall"}
{"text":"Had dinner here by myself during happy hour after a long day at the Fashion Show Mall. Great service! Terrific food! A little on the pricey side when it isn't happy hour, but worth it regardless. Good ambiance, music, & location. Had the potstickers & rainbow roll - both outstanding. Fresh! They have a tix4tonight coupon for here for $3 you get 30% off. I didn't get to use it cause it was happy hour, but good to know for others. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Good spot. Happy hour is really good prices, sat upstairs sorry only 21 and up only!! Had a couple of apps and bud lights and it was good. The servicer was slow but the food came out fast, would have been 4 stars but the servicer was that slow"}
{"text":"Ate here for an Aunt's birthday and wasn't too happy that happy hour is only outside in the patio which was really packed but that's our fault, we should have made a reservation.   We ordered a pitcher of Chardonnay sangria & that was delicious. As appetizers we had the chicken flatbread which I highly recommend, the calamari, which was alright & the spicy edamame. As for sushi, I was not really impressed. We ordered the Las Vegas roll which was just OK; the spicy tuna, which was NOT even spicy & the tuna was a weird light pink color closer to salmon rather than the dark pink that I'm used to; the wave roll, which was pretty tasty; and the spider roll which was also just OK. I wish I had ordered a burger or something cuz I didn't really see what was so special about this place. I guess the sushi didn't cut it for me but then again what could you expect from a fusion reastaurant?   I'll only come back for the sangria."}
{"text":"sorry folks. not a good review here.  we visited kona grill over labor day weekend.  we sat at one of the tables inside.  a short wait.  we ordered wine.  mostly california wines on the menu.  very few other options, but we did find a chilean malbec that was good.  we noticed that the cloth napkins were dirty (gross).  i put my napkin on the table and asked the server for another.  she came back with a cocktail napkin.  I don't know what she was thinking but told her that i wanted another cloth napkin.  so, what did i get? another dirty napkin but less dirty than the first.  the silverware was spotted. we tried to clean them with our napkins with mostly partial success.  we didn't want to ruin our evening.  we ordered some flatbread.  i ordered some shedded pork sliders and my wife ordered a pear salad.  mostly ok.  too much dressing on the salad.  the server was on the inexperienced side.  the service was certainly below average.    this kona grill got an A rating from the restaurant board but we certainly did not get an A for service and cleanliness. we also felt that the price was somewhat high as compared to other similarly priced restaurants.  we certainly were expecting better."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner tonight... service SUCKED... spoke to the manager ... nothing improved.  Food was par if that.  I honestly don't ever write bad reviews, but this place deserves it.  The wine arrived after 20 minutes,  our edamame was cold, the sushi wasn't bad.. but wasn't good.  The only thing I would sort of recommend would be the poke bowl.  That was par.  Beyond disappointed and dissatisfied"}
{"text":"Slow bar service. It's slow and staff is not attentive. We love that the patio is open though. The breeze and weather are perfect.  Our server for dinner was excellent."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for social hour!! Their food is fabulous and the staff is so welcoming and accommodating!! The have an outside lounge area too!! Best restaurant in Summerlin!!!"}
{"text":"Had cocktails at the bar with the bartender JD. He was super friendly, gave great & prompt service, and the drinks were on point!!"}
{"text":"This is by far one of our favorite happy hour spots! One of the larger HH menus. Includes some favorite sushi rolls. The patio is great! Mostly in the shade, they have misters that keep the patio cool. We were greeted promptly, and our server was at our table within a couple of minutes.  We love the Kona Grill, and we keep it in our rotation of favorite restaurants. We will be coming back soon, as my husband would like to feel what the evening vibe is like.  I would give this place 5 stars, however I believe that there is always room for improvement."}
{"text":"After being on the roads for the past 10 days, we were really craving fresh & tasty food. We got exactly that in Kona Grill. And during happy hour the prices were totally fare."}
{"text":"Meant to update this sooner! My daughter and I went Christmas shopping and ended up here unplanned. She ordered the lobster mac and cheese again and once again she didn't finish it. Our server offered to box it up to go and I told him we'd like to take it however; we would like to box it ourselves. I told him what happened during our last visit (server was suppose to box my daughters food but never brought it to us so I paid for her to take a couple of bites and essentially throw her plate away) and he said he understood and brought a box but he boxed it for us at our table. He then brought the check and told us he advised his manager of what previously happened and the manager took care of my daughters meal. I'm not one to complain but I am one who thinks you should always speak up without being rude in the process and it obviously makes a difference. Thank you to our server that evening and thank you to the manager. We love Kona and will continue to go back!!!"}
{"text":"Let me tell you about the awesome bartender Greg, his personality shines bright like a diamond and his cocktails are as close to the nectar of gods as you can get. The tuna crisps and steak bulgogi tacos were amaze balls and the Moscow Mule is super delicious. I can't wait to come back and experience the extraordinary and personable Gregory and tasty food. You won't be disappointed if you visit this Kona grill and have Gregory take care of your every need.."}
{"text":"Favorite restaurant in my area! Great customer service and the food was awesome!! I typically order the sushi and it is always good! My favorite is the Las Vegas roll!!"}
{"text":"The ONLY reason we will be back is because of Austin. He took care of us when we were forgotten by another server. Thank you Austin for your wonderful service and hospitality!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner before going out this weekend. I thought it was alright. Nothing special. All I ate was the bbq chicken pizza and thought it was tasty. I felt like it was a weird menu selection considering they have items like sushi, fish tacos and pizza. I dont really see how that all goes together. I cant speak for any other food. I like the outdoor eating area but those seem to be everywhere in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Bright the family and really enjoyed ourselves for lunch. GREAT menu. GREAT prices. I got a California roll and Philadelphia roll and also the big kahuna burger. Everything was great. Kids got mac and cheese, cheese burger and oranges - they cut the oranges to look like a little animal (cute). Loved it and will definitely go back."}
{"text":"This is a great spot for patio dining. The avocado fried egg roll appetizer is delish!"}
{"text":"First off, you have to understand the clientele our poor waiter had.  Three teachers, one super fussy, and two who have no mouth censor.  Our waiter was a poor young fellow, hipster angle to him, and tried his very hardest to figure out exactly what to do with us.  He was attentive, friendly, and took our constant harassment of him very well.  The food (shrimp and salad, ahi, and one burger) was excellent, and when Super-Fussy sent her food back (twice) it came out without hassle and without being spat on.  Nothing was wrong with it--just she wanted things replaced or warmed up.  It happens when we dine with her.  We consider it part of her charm.  Luckily she tips accordingly.  The waiter kept our glasses full, ensured we were all right, but also had mastered the art of \"attention without being smothering.\"  Great job, Kona grill!"}
{"text":"Love coming here for happy hour. The margarita flat bread is delicious and not heavy. My favorite item was the shrimp naruto roll which is a shrimp tempura wrapped with cucumber. The moscow mule is tasty and the overall vibe is great. Only 4 stars because if you sit at the bar area, the service is not that great and you find yourself waiting forever to order or have them follow up."}
{"text":"I usually just come here for happy hour so I can't really comment on their food but what I saw did look pretty good. Our server was fantastic (sorry I can't remember her name!) and she made sure to check up on us even though the place was very busy. Definitely appreciated and even though I live on the other side of town, I'd go back again because of her customer service."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved the drinks and service (Travis was our bartender) however the music left a lot to be desired. Actually the minus two stars was because of the music. Music was very outdated"}
{"text":"The kona grill is continuously impressing me. Our server Gus was absolutely amazing. I couldn't remember what sushi I got the last time I was here. And he made sure he tried to figure out what I was talking about. My descriptions were terrible so he did great and made some good recommendations. The sushi is always awesome. The last time I came to the one in Baltimore they ran out of the chicken and shrimp lettuce wrap. I was disappointed so when I came to Vegas I was delighted they had it. And of course it was great! And it's always great when I can get a free appetizer and birthday certificate! The passion fruit creme brûlée was so great! I am in a food a coma!"}
{"text":"Omg!!! My son and I love the flat breads! We just can't get enough of this place our favorite happy hour in town.  Jenn was our server not only ageand was GREAT!!!"}
{"text":"This location is the place to come. Honestly. Food is super fresh. Having happy hour right now and it's the best happy hour in the whole valley. Atlantic roll is so delicious and so fresh. Portabello and goat cheese flatbread!, one of best selections ever. The bartender is friendly and amazing. I noticed he makes the best cocktails and customers were satisfy. The whole team is great and the bar is the best zone to sit at."}
{"text":"Took the mushroom and goat cheese flatbread off the menu, but they have a great happy hour, and bar staff was super friendly. :)"}
{"text":"Kona Grill is a nice place to go after work or after shopping to get some food/drinks for happy hour - especially in the nice cool months seated at the patio. The patio seating is first come first serve.   I got the sangria, calamari, and chicken and shrimp lettuce wraps.  The sangria was good - I couldn't even finish it all bc after a few sips, I was starting to feel it.  The food is unexceptional, but reasonable prices for happy hour.  The calamari was cold, way too chewy and the lettuce wraps seemed bland.  My friend and I didn't feel compelled to eat it all, but we did stay there for a good 1-2 hours chatting away."}
{"text":"We made reservations on Easter Sunday for 10 people and had no problems. Surprisingly, the restaurant wasn't too busy. Our server seemed new as he couldn't give us recommendations from the menu at all.  Luckily, my party was blessed with my presence because I ate at Kona Grill several times before since I used to have a cousin that worked at Kona Grill. I have eaten most of the items from the menu so I was their food expert there. I did recommend the calamari, lettuce wraps, miso sake sea bass, basil pesto linguini, and macadamia nut chicken.   The future hubby and I ordered the calamari and miso sake sea bass, which used to be my favorite. When we got our order, I was highly disappointed. It wasn't what I remember ever having. The calamari did not taste fresh, the miso-sake sea bass was tough, and the rice tasted old/stale. Fortunately, it seemed that everyone else other than myself and fiancé were happy with their food so I didn't express my dissatisfaction.   The server rarely checked up on us, but he did split our checks so that was nice."}
{"text":"It has been over 1 year since I've been to Kona Grill.  A lot has changed on their menu, which is a good thing.  The Better Half and I were regulars here for many years but got tired of the same old menu and stopped coming last year.  I met a friend here for lunch this past Friday and was glad to see new menu items.  Since it was Friday, we decided to sit at a table at the bar.  Friday afternoons are happening at Kona Grill, so it was great for people watching.  They have a special \"Pairing Menu\" where you can order any 2 items for $8.50.....what a deal!  The Sandwiches on the menu are 1/2 Sandwiches, so keep that in mind.  I went for the Portobello Mushroom Sandwich and the Avocado Chicken Wrap.  To wash it down I ordered a Stella Artois.  The food came out fast and our waitress was very attentive.  My Wrap & Sandwich didn't come with Fries, which was a good thing....I'm trying to cut back on Fries.  The flavor of the Portobello Mushroom Sandwich was amazing!  Full of flavor....and the Bread was delicious.  The proportion of veggies in the sandwich was good too....no single flavor overwhelmed the Sandwich.  The Wrap was just as good.  The Avocado and Chicken were distributed evenly in the Wrap......I hate it when stuff in a Wrap is bunched together so you only taste a single flavor.  That wasn't the case here.....very good.  As a big eater, I was left wanting more though.....but it was probably good for my diet, ha!  My friend and I put away several beers before we called it a day.  Overall, I was pleased with the food, service, and menu selection.  Will I return?  You bet, I want to try more of the new menu items."}
{"text":"Restaurant is practically empty and we decided to sit out on the patio. Hostess tells us that it is open seating. We sit and we wait and we wait and wait as we watch 4 or 5 servers pass and ignore us. After about ten minutes, a man sits next to our table and he gets acknowledged by a server. That was it. We get up and leave. There is no excuse for being ignored especially with an empty restaurant and with so many servers walking around!  We walk over to Brio and two minutes after we have a seat, our lovely server acknowledges us. I hate bad customer service!"}
{"text":"Service was horrible- took 10 minutes to take our order. Asked for additional dressing for salad and another drink and that took an extra ten minutes because the server told me they had to get it way in the back? Not the type of service you'd expect when spending that much. Go elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Kona grill happy hour - Expensive and not recommended.  Stopped by Sunday Happy hour. Their happy hour food and drinks are about a $1-$2 off than regular price. Food is not that great. The serving size is very limited. Great ambience and outdoor seating. Would recommend other options in Vegas."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing! I cannot say the same about the servers! We spent most of our time waiting for someone to come to our table, and there were only two other parties there, none larger than 4 people. I thought there was only one server, but they eventually started surfacing. When we were finished and ready to pay, we had to flag down one server to find ours. They were all hiding at a booth behind the far wall. Our server refilled our drinks and asked how our food was a few minutes after it was served. That was it! She hid the rest of the time. I only say she hid, because she was behind that wall and obviously irritated when we asked for the bill. I only give this place a 3 star rating, because the food was some of the best I have every had. We waited on our food about 10 minutes and ate it in about 10 minutes. The other 40 minutes were spent waiting to be seated, for someone to come to our table for our order, and for someone to bring us the bill. If the place had been busy, I would have been less irritated. However, there were more servers than tables being used. There was no excuse for the wait or the bad attitude of our server."}
{"text":"So.... When you run a corporate restaurant you should have the same rules at both! The website says that they have all day Sunday Happy Hour. This is only correct at one location, not the other! The Chandler location has Sunday all day happy hour. SAN TAN LOCATION DOES NOT.  So we will go to the Chandler location because Kona does have a good happy hour but a little on the expensive side without it. Corporate needs to get their restraunts on the same page!!!"}
{"text":"CHANDLER, AZ: Kona is always a good sample of a nice business lunch place that just misses the opportunity most of the time.  The sushi is okay; the Bama roll is tasty with a little kick.  The meatloaf is delicious if you are in the mood for comfort food.  The ambience is lovely and the service is generally good."}
{"text":"The food at Kona Grill is to die for. We have been coming here for years. The Macadamia Nut Chicken does not disappoint. I recommend extra shoyu cream, it is delightful.   My fiancé strayed from his norm of Salmon which Kona does expertly and tried the Chopped Salad w/Macadamia Nut Chicken pieces in it. He didn't care for it, but I am sure it was great.  The ambiance at Kona is awesome! Great atmosphere for a date or the family. The decor is very pleasant.  The reason this is not a 5 star review, because I have to tell you we LOVE this place, is because the service, rather our server was awful. She would have bludgeoned us both if looks and attitude could kill. We ordered, she seemed very displeased that we did not want wine, copped an attitude and walked away. Just like that. When she brought the food it was the same. I asked her for two to-go boxes as we were finishing up and she snapped \"I have to box them for you!\" The entire dining experience was uncomfortable due to her downright hostility. I don't know if she hates her job or if she is just having a bad day. I really hope it is the latter which is why I won't post her name. (I like to believe that in the service industry you don't really get to behave that way for very long.)  I hope her day gets better and Heaven help anyone else that she serves tonight."}
{"text":"The food and service are always so good here. We came today with my nephew, sister and my mom. Lylah was such a wonderful server, so pleasant, attentive and patient with my nephew.  Thank you!!"}
{"text":"I enjoy sitting there chatting with friends and eating their delicious food. The service varies - some days it's really good. Some days it could improve. The food is nice and Happy Hour prices are really good/"}
{"text":"Food and service were just OK both times I went there. I would say they are good for a group."}
{"text":"I have been to the Kona @ Chandler and Scottsdale and never had a problem.  When I arrived at SanTan location and walked up to the desk the hostess just stared at us.... I fInally said hello to her and she asked how many in our party (super wierd and unfriendly).  Two of us ordered Moscato and one of us ordered Chardonnay.  We couldn't tell the difference between them.... The moscato wasn't sweet and the Chardonnay didn't really have any taste.  Our server was nice and our sushi rolls were fine... I've had better at the other locations."}
{"text":"Sure the food is good, location is solid, and the atmosphere is friendly, but there's only one reason I'm here writing this review on this 5 inch canvas, and that's Jo.  As the hostess sat us at our dining home for the next hour, we were greeted by the most heartfelt \"Hello! My name is Jo and I will be taking care of you all today.\" Service with a smile...we knew we were in great hands.   Everything came out fast, delicious, and there was never a hiccup the entire night, all because of Jo. She played games with my son to make him come out of his comfort zone, as well as have a fun conversation about what our zodiac signs were. We loved her.   Management: if you're reading this, the future is Jo...Jona Grill.           Hopefully Jona Grill has happy hour though."}
{"text":"Worst sushi and service ever!! We came in after Happy Hour Party of 5 for a birthday celebration we made a point to tell the staff it was my friends birthday. They did nothing we even told them we'd pay for desert anything, they couldn't even wish the guy a happy birthday.  The place was dead and we waited a half hour for our food, which was mediocre at best. Staff suggested the spider it was o.k., we are sushi lovers of RA.and Sushi Brokers to name a few so we were not impressed at all-there was so much cream cheese in the salmon roll all you could taste was cream cheese. We asked to see the manager and the manager never showed up.  This is a good place for sushi beginners, not for experienced sushi peeps. How does the manager not even come to the table? Won't be back any time soon. U can have mediocre service but when your food is medicare too and you can't even speak to a manager  it's a pretty good indication of how ones gonna be treated. We even had to tell the staff about the huge dead fish in their tank and the bird flying around in the restaurant health department needs to shut her down ."}
{"text":"My partner and I came here to watch the Knights game and grab a small bite to eat. It was expectedly a little busy downstairs and I hate when the water from the fans totally soak you (I saw this recently in another lady's review of this location too) so we thought we'd try upstairs. MUCH better! It was warmer but there was a lovely breeze from the fans and the water coming from them wasn't as bad. It also wasn't as busy upstairs which was good, although that might have been because the sound wasn't on the TVs for the game. This didn't overly bother us bc we could still see what was going on, but may not be for everyone. The screens were also bigger upstairs so there was a great view of the game from pretty much every seat. We got a Mai Tai and a Mule from the HH menu and loved them. Quite strong but very tasty. We also ordered some calamari and the avocado rolls. The portion size was great, especially for HH and the calamari was thinly breadcrumbed and generally good with the tastiest sauce to accompany. The avocado rolls were different and also very good. A little greasy if anything, but we enjoyed them.  We would definitely pop back here to watch the sports and for some drinks, maybe even to try a few more things on their HH menu. Great little spot!"}
{"text":"Muy buen espacio y excelente locación. Muy buena comida, el servicio muy agradable. Y el sushi muy bueno, muy buen happy hour. Recomendado"}
{"text":"We totally enjoyed our food but what made our visit especially great was the terrific service that we received from Specialists Anderson and her trainee! (Day?) They were both professional while at the same time being friendly and warm. We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Amazing service!  I love the food and the drinks. I can't wait till summer since they are expanding!  Troy the manager is so nice.  Had excellent service with Riley and Jennifer as well.  Never have had a bad experience here.  One of my favorite places in  Summerlin !"}
{"text":"This location used to be my jam when I lived and worked on that side of town way before the recent remodel. Can't help but notice the price hike on their happy hour items, but still a good value. The atmosphere upgrade looks pretty slick!  My go-to bevvy here is the frozen strawberry mango margarita with a sugar rim...Just 2 of them will have you on lean, as they don't skimp on the tequila. I love that they have a reverse night happy hour too, so I can pick up all my favorites then too.  Love the avocado egg rolls, chicken satay and the cheeseburger sliders. The desserts are also really good...go for the key lime pie w/ that perfect macadamia crust!"}
{"text":"Good enviorment for a date day-night. Decent happy hour prices"}
{"text":"I usually come here for happy hour. Happy hour menu is pretty good. Place gets packed quickly. Gets loud once in a while. Outdoor seating is nice touch. They have misters in the summer and patio heaters in the winter. Service is good."}
{"text":"Great service from Shelby!  Loved the assortment of rolls and happy hour pricing is incredible!  I chose the basic California roll to start. Red Sake Sangria was very good.  Not too boozy. Flatbread good too but should have ordered the salad.  Last time it was so fresh!  Bonus tonight was St Patrick's Day!  I got the green chopsticks!  Winner winner.  Thx!!!"}
{"text":"We checked this place out at happy hour last night. It was very crowded and we felt like lady luck had blessed us that we found 2 seats at the bar. No wonder it is so busy, happy hour was a great deal! The service was spot on and attentive.  We had pot stickers and a California roll. Both were delicious! I would have preferred the pot stickers to have a more moist filling but the outside was prepared so perfectly and the dipping sauce was so tasty it didn't really matter much. The inside is beautiful,  with a lovely aquarium behind the sushi bar. We will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Came in for happy hour and had the wave roll and lettuce wraps, both of which were delicious! Staff has been very attentive and friendly as well...First time here and definitely not my last! Yummy"}
{"text":"I had the Pad Thai with shrimp and chicken and it was delicious! My mother had the macadamia crusted chicken with sautéed haricot verts and garlic mashed potatoes, which was also very delicious. The chicken was moist and the garlic mashed potatoes had just the right amount of garlic. Service was great also."}
{"text":"I went there last night on a first date. Raven was a sweetie~ so kind and attentive. She helped recommend my dinner as I was torn between an Oriental Salad or Chicken Pad Thai. Pretty good:)  Thanks!"}
{"text":"Went to Kona for a late lunch with the wife. Service, food, and the staff were amazing. Jacob and Samantha were awesome. Ask for Jacob to shake a drink for you. Potstickers, Dragon Roll, and the Crab Crunch were off the hook. Be back soon. Thanks"}
{"text":"Just had to share our great experience with Maxwell tonight. He is a GREAT server. We sat just minutes before happy hour was over and he made sure we were able to order a round and some apps. That was very considerate. He was attentive and friendly and prompt."}
{"text":"Kona Grill is a modern Asian fusion restaurant crossed with the franchise feel of a Cheesecake Factory. The menu is divided between the typical starters, salads, sandwiches, and entrees, and the sushi menu on the flip side. Personally, with the variety of sushi choices in Vegas, I would never order off the sushi menu, but the prices are actually quite reasonable.   For starters, the smoked gouda fondue is something nice and fun to share. For the entrees, they feature several island-inspired dishes with favorites marked by a triangle. I decided to try the macadamia nut chicken since I'm a fan of crusted chicken dishes. While I enjoyed the chicken itself, I was disappointed by the lack of any macadamia nut flavor. I would say the majority of the crust was made of panko. I did enjoy the accompanying mashed potatoes, broccoli, shoyu cream, and pineapple-papaya marmalade. Although, I do wish the chicken was topped more with the marmalade than the cream. If you're in the mood for seafood, the miso-sak sea bass was really good. The sea bass had big flakes and you get a pretty large portion.   While the food was on the average side for me, I will say the service was excellent and Kona Grill is a great choice if you're looking to dine with a large group. With the reasonable prices, I may have to come back to check out their happy hour, which apparently is all day on Sundays. The staff was on point and they were very accommodating to our large party and were able to split individual checks."}
{"text":"My wife and daughter have been here a few times but this was my second visit. Much like the first time I came here for lunch, I found the atmosphere quite relaxing and the service very good. Our waitress was attentive, courteous, and did a great job with the entrée recommendations.  I started with the avocado egg rolls that paired well with the honey-cilantro sauce; it was a mellow blend of flavors and the sauce was what put the appetizer over the top. I highly recommend coconut shrimp roll, it's definitely out of this world and my only problem with it is that I wanted more...way more. I could have sat there for a couple of more hours with just this dish alone and been happy. At the risk of overstating how much I enjoyed this sushi, if this establishment caught on fire while I had a plate of the coconut shrimp roll in front of me I wouldn't make the effort to evacuate until I finished my sushi.  For the entrée I was tempted to order the Big Kahuna Cheeseburger just because of Samuel L. Jackson in Pulp Fiction (\"I hear they got some tasty burgers!\") but being the home-grown Asian that I am (grew up in Hawaii so machine-wash warm/tumble dry low and pass the friggin' spam), genetic imprinting steered me toward the tuna Poké instead.   First I'd like to thank the Kona Grill for not calling it \"Ahi Tuna Poké\", every time I see that cringe-worthy nomenclature on a menu I get this urge to go home and shave my head with a cheese grater while chewing on tin foil. The Poké was really good--not spicy but had a nice rich flavor. The serving was big enough where I couldn't finish it, I was close but couldn't go the distance and left a few bites behind.  For dessert, the wife had the crème brulee and my kid had the fudge brownie while I tried not to slip into a food coma. Both desserts looked fantastic and were generous servings. I look forward to my next visit and definitely have the coconut shrimp roll on the list again. I may have to skip an appetizer to make room for dessert.  Pretty pricy meal but well worth the cost.   Overall rating: Service = 10/10 Quality of food = 10/10  Cleanliness and ambiance = 10/10"}
{"text":"Had a great evening and yummy foods! A must try are the pot stickers and chicken chili ! My fav's! Great atmosphere.. love the heaters outdoors and wait staff is so awesome and friendly!"}
{"text":"Terrible service,rude staff, rude manager...will never,ever give kona grill my business. Waited over an hour for a table at happy hour, informed all staff we were waiting for table. Watched multiple times as other people stole tables that opened up. Staff and manager did not care and were rude."}
{"text":"the happy hour is great here love the bbq flat bread pizza"}
{"text":"The sea bass is amazing! Staff is nice and friendly! The cocktail that I ordered is sweet, exactly as I want it. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"They have really good seafood! Calamari, best sushi, good salads. We ordered coconut shrimp rolls, lobster and shrimp rolls and Las Vegas rolls. They were tasty and fresh.  I recommend eating upstairs in the roof, even though it's not summer, their heater and accommodations make you feel warm so you'll love it.  Service is not bad, but when we asked our waitress what she recommended, she Said she's not a big fan of onions and tomatoes, and then she couldn't give us any ideas... really? Parking is not a big deal and the area is beautiful! It's my second? time in Las Vegas and I fell in love with this area. Good restaurants and all kinds of stores. I'm definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Would not go back.  Terrible service and the food was mediocre.  Too bad because the location and atmosphere are really cool and the desert ridge area could use more cool places like this.  There are other much stronger options in city north to choose."}
{"text":"We have been several times, but the last was after Christmas. We were planning to eat dinner but ended up just having drinks. We wanted to sit outside but it was full so we sat at the bar. Service was good at first but I waited for 10 minutes to get a new drink.  It is a nice place but very lacking in service. The couple next to us said they had waited forever for their food and were not pleased so we decided to move on. I think it is a typical chain experience."}
{"text":"Today was my first time eating at Kona Grill.   I had the Chopped Salad with Grilled Salmon - honestly one of the best salads I've ever eaten. Salmon was fresh and tasty.   Their kids meal is really cool, too. Comes in a bento box. My daughter loved it and it was a good price for a lot of food.   Excellent service and fantastic food. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Came here wanting to use the restroom but ended celebrating a huge accomplishment by a colleague of mine.  Food was outstanding! I got the spicy shrimp tempura and chicken satay. Also purchased a bottle of cupcake wine which was a nice compliment to the spice in the food.  Overall nice place , great service, and atmosphere fitting for many."}
{"text":"My sister and I ate here during happy hour today (9/22/2014). Kona Grill has always looked busy whenever we went to Chandler Fashion - it was always packed inside and out (in the patio area). They have a huge aquarium near the hostess station and a small boothed seating area while you wait to be seated.  So, after wandering in for happy hour, we looked around for a host/hostess. None were to be found! We looked over at the sushi bar where there were a couple of sushi chef's there prepping or something, but I'm sure they saw us two waiting by the station to be seated. A waitress soon came by and asked if we were going to be seated inside for happy hour, or wanted to be outside in the patio area. We said inside and she promptly sat us at a booth. A few seconds later a waiter came by and asked us if we were there for happy hour, in which we replied with yes. He then stated that happy hour was only in the patio and that we had to move tables. Confused, my sister told him what the waitress had said, and he said that she was in the wrong and they don't seat happy hour customers inside.  So off to the patio we went, we were told that we would be brought menus again, we picked a random table and thought the waiter was following us with menus, but when we sat down, menus, and waiter/waitress, were nowhere to be found. As we sat awkwardly for about five minutes outside, our original waitress appeared! Handed us menu's and asked us what we would like to drink (water and a sprite). After she had left, my sister leaned over and said, \"They forgot about us. The bartender saw and told someone inside that there was a table not being waited on.\" Thank you Mr. Bartender for dragging our waitress back to doing her job!  We ordered the BBQ Flatbread, Chicken and Shrimp Lettuce Wraps, and my sister got the Crunch Roll Sushi. The BBQ Flatbread is spicy, so watch out! The Lettuce Wraps were very good, they use butter lettuce for the leaves, and the peanut sauce that comes with it is also spicy and has a kick which leaves you craving for more. My sister was not impressed with the sushi, it was good, but nothing to really rave about. The food did take a while to get out, we only ordered three simple dishes, and they brought my sister tap water... so yeah, there's that to think about the next time you order water on a weekday.  By then more people had arrived to eat, and it started to pick up. We saw others seated around us, and other waters and waitresses bustling around us. Our waitress refilled our drinks and then disappeared! I saw her maybe one more time waiting on another table that was not far from us, they too were waiting for what seemed like a while like we did for service after they were seated.  And, well, it was time to pack up, pay the bill, and finish our shopping! But... our waitress was nowhere to be found, again! We managed to get a small to-go box from her before she mysteriously vanished within the semi-empty restaurant. And we waited. And waited. And waited. Ten minutes later my sister and I looked at each other and said, \"Let's just go. We can't even pay for our food, so let's go.\" but my sister managed to flag down another waiter and asked him politely, \"Excuse me, I'm sorry, I know you're not our waiter, but we've been waiting for our bill for the last ten minutes.\" (it was pretty obvious we were ready to leave, we even stacked the dishes out of boredom) and after asking us who our waitress was, that's when we then realized she never gave us her name (go figure). We had to say she was one of the brunettes - and there was another brunette waitress also working there. But it looked like the guy knew who we were talking about (our waitress had permanent b**** face on, so). He apologized, brought us our bill, and when we stuck the CC in it, our waitress appeared! Whisked the pay away, came back, mumbled, \"Thank you for eating here, have a good day.\" and walked off. My sis and I shook our heads in laughing disbelief, we've never had such a bad wait times on such a slow day!  So the next time we're at Chandler Fashion, we're going to be avoiding this place, and not be recommending it to anyone we know. I think we were better off getting something in the food court."}
{"text":"I don't know how I've ever not written a review of Kona Grill.  When I bought my house in Summerlin, I drew a triangle between Kona Grill, downtown, and Steiner's, and I had to find a house in that triangle as I was working downtown and enjoyed frequenting Kona Grill and Steiner's.  That was 5 years ago, though.  Unfortunately Steiner's died down, and Kona cut back their hours.  I believe they used to be open until 2am on weeknights, and now they're closed by 11pm.  Kona does have a regular and late night happy hour, and there's plenty to pick from, so thumbs up for that.  Just don't trust their web site for the happy hour times... call first.  Food is good, atmosphere is good, service is good.  Make sure you get Channelle as your server.  Really don't have too much bad to say about this place."}
{"text":"Visited here and tried an assortment of dishes.Started with lettuce wraps ( ok, very spicy), avocado rolls ( MUST) and California roll (ok). Entrees included: Tomato bisque ( save your calories) Oriental Chicken Salad ( cabbage is the best ever), Macademia Chicken ( mashed potatoes yum, chicken quality was not good), Volacano roll, Las Vegas roll and rainbow roll ( tasted like butter), pad Thai and chicken stir fry ( good). Overall, we liked the restaurant and would go back to try the wide variety of choices on the menu."}
{"text":"Kona, why oh why, do you have to be so far away from me?  I crave your happy hour but the half hour drive there and back makes me very UNhappy.  You should open another spot closer to the southeast side.  Their flat bread pizzas are some of the best the fiance says he has ever had and this is from a guy who hates anything approaching thin crust status on a pizza.  All their sushi rolls are definitely above the usual happy hour par and their sashimi style sushi is actually really good too.  The only thing I've ever had there and not cared for was the calamari.  If you want a fair priced happy hour drink they have some good options including their martinis and cosmos.  I personally love their selection of skinny drinks.    As others have mentioned the bar and patio can get very crowded and sometimes table service isn't the fastest however, people if you're their for happy hour, relax!!  It's about the experience or just order your drinks two at a time :)"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere!!! You can't have a bad night here its just too pretty and the food is yummy with good flavors!  Had the pulled pork sliders hubs had the cheeseburger.  Love the two stories the bar area upstairs is cozy. Would definitely come back with friends or date night again."}
{"text":"Great place for happy hour! They have TVs playing sports and music playing it's a nice environment. The food is consistent and the service as well!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Kona from wayyy back. The only time I come is during happy hour!  The deals are decent and the drinks are worth the price. You can get a nice Margarita for $4. They changed a few of the recipes which turned out nice. The new pizzas are pretty decent and are more of a thin crust which I personally prefer. Its best to eat on the patio. Even on a hot day they have nice misters and fans that really keep you cool. The only problem is the outside of the patio has little bushes that attract bee's. So if you're sitting next to gates on the outside of the patio, beware.  I'm not a huge sushi lover so if I do have a hankering for it, I personally prefer to go somewhere that is known for having really good sushi, this place isn't but the other stuff they do have is pretty legit. Their clam chowder is some of the best i've eaten and almost always partake."}
{"text":"Kona grill was pretty standard. Food was average, nothing special. Service was good (and very attractive). It was \"eh\""}
{"text":"It was OK, I think it was a little over priced and service was slow.  It also didn't help that there was a crying baby on the patio THE ENTIRE TIME I was there and the kid's fat rude parents would not do anything (literally not even a cuddle) to stop him despite our extra glances with pleading eyes.  So I had to cringe and burn inside while paying a large bill for food I was not wowed by and it took too long.  My friends really like this place so maybe my experience is off- tainted-- and I will go again.  If it gets better, I'll update this review."}
{"text":"Was out in Scottsdale for a few days on business & visiting a friend - he recommended we grab a bite at this place..  I was skeptical about eating sushi in AZ - a landlocked state - but then again I eat it in Vegas all the time so why not?  This is a hip joint with a good-looking, young crowd.  They had a special happy hour menu where they offered a half dozen basic sushi rolls (spicy tuna, california, etc).  I ordered a few rolls and had a few drinks.. The service was FAST - especially considering how packed it was on a Thursday night.  This is a popular happy-hour spot in scottsdale, located near several businesses, mall, etc.  I'd return next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Located on \"Happy Hour Row\" in Scottsdale Fashion Square by the Yardhouse and Z'Tejas, Kona falls into the category of scenester joint with a plus size happy hour.  There isn't much to whine about with the happy hour, except that maybe the discounts apply to inflated prices. So does that mean they're NOT ripping me off for those three hours? Ok, I guess.   Food is good, not amazing. Overall, not bad, if you can get a seat and ignore the smell of cheezy bachelors on the prowl."}
{"text":"Checked out the Kona at High Street in City North..  Saturday night, last minute decision.  Very noisy, polite waiter but very forgetful and inattentive. If you aren't amongst the prettier variety, you may experience slouchy service... Sushi was just ok. I've had better at the Whole Foods and even better at Sakana on Indian Bend.. Sushi was bland, not the most flavorful. Small side note, three plates of sushi arrived with two small slices of Ginger and a dollop of wasabi.. Ugh!  Also had the Chili Lime Salad.. Ok, actually preferred it to the  sushi but the shrimp was really tough so it was a toss up.  Can't comment on dessert took more than an half an hour to arrive, had to take it to go which immediately makes it less appealing I'd say try someplace else. Pleasant walk around the shopping area."}
{"text":"Service is my number one priority and this place had a fantastic server waiting on us.  We sat outside by the 'mist'ers' (which kept us cool and comfortable all dinner).  It was very low price happy hour menu action. I ordered some sushi and she ordered an asparagus salad.  The food was decent but I must say the sushi was not really up to par.  However, for the price I will not deduct any points.   Very nice Server, thank you."}
{"text":"Our first visit to Kona Grill and by chance it was Happy Hour in the bar area. The tables are open seating in the bar and we managed to find one. We were greeted by our server and order drinks. I had a Moscow Mule and hubby had the Sangria. We were both happy with the drinks but it took a very long time for them to arrive. Our server said there was only one bartender there and he was swamped. My husbands second drink did not show up until we had finished our food. Service is what took the rating down one star. Now to the food which we ordered from the Happy Hour menu for $8.00 each. Avocado egg rolls which are packed with avocado and fried to perfection and served with a cilantro sauce that had a touch of sweetness to it. Order had 2 good size rolls cut in 2 so 4 pieces. Definitely would order again. Husband had fish tacos. His order had 3 good size tacos with mahi-mahi fish. My husband loved them. I had the hamburger sliders which basically is two burgers fully dressed with French fries. The burgers were cooked exactly as requested and the fries were nice and crisp. We also tried the tempura shrimp as our server recommended it but I would not order it again. Guess I was thinking it would be a couple of large batter fried shrimp but it was the smaller say 20 count roughly the size of a quarter. We could have enjoyed it more if there was some type of dipping sauce served with it.  One point the Happy Hour food is the same size as that ordered from the regular menu. No smaller portions so a great value. We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"great late night happy hour! try the macadamia chicken if you're willing to splurge and butter cake for dessert!"}
{"text":"Sunday all day Happy Hour!  Service was good, Food came out pretty quick, however I waited a while for drinks and afterwards once we asked for our check, bill didnt come out for another 20 minutes, we would have ordered a few more cocktails if we knew we would have been waiting that long to check out... otherwise, pretty pleasant experience, Drinks, Calimari, Flatbread, and Shrimp Lettuce wraps for under $30 bucks!!!!"}
{"text":"Did not know Kona takes reservations. Made reservations for Saturday night at 7pm. When I arrived the line was out the door and so many people waiting. I went to the host and asked how long was the wait and she said abouth 45 to an hour.  I said does it make a difference if I made a reservation, she looked me up in her system and said \"right this way\". We were a party of 5 and it was very convenient. I think I had looks from people still waiting, oh well. They have a great kids menu which is affordable and comes with an entree two sides and drink for $6.  I had sushi rolls and my wife had a basil pesto pasta which were both great. Very family friendly and make sure you make reservations."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have come to Kona Grill several times before for happy hour even though we never received outstanding service. After today, the chances of us ever returning are very slim due to our mediocre experience. Our waiter was nothing more than just \"okay.\" We ordered 1 order of sliders (medium rare) for the 2 of us to share and my boyfriend finished his slider while I was eating my other dish. Once I began to eat my slider, I realized it was much softer than I have had before. When I looked at the inside of my burger after I already took several bites out of it, I saw that my burger was completely raw. When I notified the server, she was not apologetic for the incident; all she said was \"I'll let them know.\" Then, left the raw burger at the table. After becoming impatient and waiting for our check longer than we should have, we saw our waiter dancing and doing nothing at the waitress stand opposed to serving her waiting guests. I have never felt compelled to write a Yelp review ever, but this was just unacceptable."}
{"text":"Good food,nice lighting nice local crowd,food is very consistent  recomend the ribeye and the ribs"}
{"text":"Amazing food, my server was slow but love the sushi chef, he has only worked here for 2 months but you need to keep him around. Come during happy hour- food is a steal!"}
{"text":"I recently visited a friend in AZ and went out to Kona Grill one night.  The food is nothing to write home about but the drink specials get two thumbs up for me.  We had three different types of rolls, calamari, edamame and what seemed like an endless amount of drinks for me and the bill only came out to $35 dollars!  Pretty good ambiance for a local place all in all it was ok."}
{"text":"i'm not a fan of chain restauanants but i had heard good things about kona so i decided to try it.  nothing is great and nothing is horrid.  the food is edible but overpriced.  the drinks are fine but they come with a little too much flair from the bartender for me.  i just find the place silly.  it's a chain restaurant in a strip mall and the servers act as if they are curing cancer.  it's good for a laugh but nothing more."}
{"text":"This is one of the consistently terribly run kitchens ever. On more than one occasion, we have waited upwards of an hour for our food (this is not during rush times). However, today topped the salad when my salad dressing contained A MOTH. Yes. A moth. The manager, Miles, was nice enough and apologized profusely (which he should) but at the end of the day, this is a zero star restaurant. If you want to eat at a Kona Grill, go to Scottsdale Fashion Square... NOT CITY NORTH."}
{"text":"Kona Grill has a patio outside that seems like it would feel like sitting in a parking lot - but once you sit there you no longer feel like you are in a parking lot. The food is great. My personal favorite is the spicy shrimp tacos. You can get them at happy hour, or you can get them for dinner with a side of pinneapple and ham rice. It it not on the menu anymore, but the servers can still order it for you!"}
{"text":"Liked the atmosphere good for watching sports. The food was not too great- pad Thai noodles were just ok. Sushi was average. The sake red merlot sangria was pretty good.   Would not come back again."}
{"text":"I ignored going to Kona for awhile because of it's weird menu.  Unlike Z-tejas, Kona couldn't figure out how to infuse food.  I went there for lunch and the menu was completley different.  Tried my dads burger and it was good and huge.  I ordered the sushi with the habenero sauce it was very good.  I also tried the salmon and that was good, and none of this was overpriced.  I like Brio but it's pricey.  Cantino Laredo is heavy food, weird and pricey.  Kona seems to be a good reasonable place to get a meal."}
{"text":"The sushi melted in my mouth! The sauces are made from scratch & these were the best lettuce wraps I've ever had anywhere. Alessandra was so sweet, informative & helped me pick out winners in my book. She is someone who truly cares and wants you to enjoy your experience. I'll be back next trip to Vegas"}
{"text":"I was SO excited to try this place out from the early days of the building construction. I visited. Kona in the US years ago and was looking forward to the same quality I had.    Sadly I was mistaken  First off: the service. Wow. So bad. Our server was no where to be seen most of the time. Took half hour to put our order in. Took an hour to get the food. Then she disappeared and never came back. Ever. I had to track her down to pay!  When we left he plates were still on the table. She did one thing right. She brought us water without us asking at some point.  Aside from that, terrible service. She only had 4 tables of 2-3 people so I have no idea where she was all the time.   Now for the food.   One person had a burger and said it was pretty good. Another had the chicken sandwich which also was alright he said. I had pad Thai which was bland and had no flavour. We had 1 beer each. Nothing else.   Fries were limp and cold. Not appetizing at all. Two grown men couldn't eat the small portion provided  Pad Thai looked huge when it was delivered only to realize that the plate is deceiving and the serving is less than a square take out box you get from a street vendor and no where near as good. At least that was served warm.   We paid over $100 for lunch which was ridiculous. I was shocked when the bill came.   I do not recommend this place and will not be back.  So disappointing. AVOID  (P.S. I felt hungry after we left which is a bad sign for someone that isn't a huge eater. What's even worse is the aftermath... let's just say my stomach didn't thank me and I hardly made it back to the office before I ran for the washroom)."}
{"text":"Stopped in for the first time for a late dinner.  We sat outside in the patio. I ordered the chicken and broccoli stir fry.  I was surprised that the dish was so spicy but in a good way.  Our waitress was very gracious to let us use the first time check in perk.  Ordered the chicken and shrimp lettuce wraps.. everything was so fresh and delicious. Definitely will stop in again"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a Bloody Mary after a rough night. They use Zing Zang so that was a huge bonus. Drink was amazing and very loaded. Waitress was all over it and did a great job. Place was awesome big big screens all over to watch sports. Perfect location right in the mall."}
{"text":"Macadamia crusted chicken is AMAZING. And the potstickers are heavenly! And we never usually order potstickers!"}
{"text":"The tuna is sooooo freakin fresh great service, what else can ask for on a laid back Saturday"}
{"text":"Have been to this restaurant several times food is average service kind of spotty sometimes get treated with a mild form of resentment from the staff. Will not return"}
{"text":"I love Kona and their happy hour. Although during HH it is quite impossible to get a table, it's worth the wait! We have tried the lettuce wraps, different sushi (wave roll is our fav), margarita pizzas and everything is delish. I also love their sparkling sangria and manhattans. Get there a little before HH if your schedule allows it or be prepared to fight people for a table... no, but really."}
{"text":"Tried out this location tonight since they do happy hour on Sundays and the location in Gilbert does not. I prefer the Gilbert location over this one but either one you will need to fight for a spot during happy hour. Sparkling sangria is always a great choice and the sushi is decent. The margarita flatbread is a go to along with the lettuce wraps. All the menu items are great I jut wish they'd open more space for the happy hour side."}
{"text":"Was here for a wedding dinner and the place was very nice.  Think special date night like nice.  Also it was a little pricey.  All in all while the food was ok it wasn't great.  I liked the atmosphere and the drinks were good.  But as for the food it left a little to be desired.  It may have been the size of the wedding party or what I ordered or that it was a Wednesday.  Not sure but would go back again and give them another shot."}
{"text":"Consistently good food.  It's good if you like this kind of place.  Upscale chain place."}
{"text":"Love Kona Grill !  Great Happy Hour !   Ordered two cocktails, and two entrees, only $ 20.00"}
{"text":"Always love stopping at Kona Grill. Delicious sushi - love the sushi sampler. The best tuna sushi EVER! Nice staff and quick service. Also great for takeout."}
{"text":"Good food . Used to get better costumer service there , but its okay now . Would still go once a year though for sure ."}
{"text":"love the renovations...up stairs is very nice...great selection of sushi for happy hour!"}
{"text":"Really like the food and atmosphere.  Happy Hour is great.  The professionalism of the staff is somewhat questionable.  We were there last night around 7:30 and one of the lady managers yelled across the restaurant to one of the servers - I think she called Haley or Bailey.  Either way it was very unprofessional.  Nothing I would expect at a restaurant like this or someone in a management role."}
{"text":"Great place,  got a late night snack after seeing Cirque du soleil and heading back to  the Trump.   Open air layout with aquariums and cool lighting.  They have late night happy hour with alot of options on the menu.  Got the Avocado Roll and Chicken Skewer,  both were excellent with generous portions and tremendous dipping sauce.   HH prices very good for Las Vegas,  will be back."}
{"text":"My fiance and I have been to the Kona grill on High Street on two separate and unrelated occasions, and Both times we were extremely pleased with the service and atmosphere created by both management and the employees. From the warm greeting by the hostess to the attentive service of the staff and finally to the extra care taken by management, this Kona has earned our 5 stars twice. And a special shout out to waitress Nathalie for giving exceptional service tonight!"}
{"text":"First time eating at Kona Grill, and I really love the ambience and decor at this location. I had the pan seared tuna sliders, and they were very delicious! Tons of good flavor when combined with the aioli sauce. Plus, the sweet potato fries are the best that I have ever had in my entire life. Very crispy, well seasoned, and it goes well with the aioli sauce. I'll have to go back and try some of the other offerings some other time, including the sushi."}
{"text":"Bad attitude, rude female bartender = customers leaving without ordering = toss of tips for bad bartender + loss of revenue for Kona. On the other hand, we walked to Blue Wasabi next door and was greeted by a very pleasant bartender....Figure it out guys!"}
{"text":"Came in and had a great atmosphere. Hostesses were nice and told us we could take a seat anywhere. I ordered three things: sliders, Vegas roll, and crab crunch roll. We got our food and we were missing the Vegas roll, she then told me that I did not order that when everyone at the table did hear. Would've been fine if she just forgot but she specifically said you didn't order that. Vegas roll came out and the plate was super scalding hot. Almost seemed as if the plate was microwaved. The roll was also mushy, doesn't seem right because Vegas rolls are supposed to be crispy. Love the Kona at San tan definitely not coming back to this location"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat in Summerlin, NV.  Every time I try a new dish it becomes my new favorite dish.  The sauces are tasty so ask for extra bread to sop it up.  I like the Pan Asian Noodle and the Chicken Pesto Linguini.  The real hot ticket is the Happy Hour menu.  I eat at like a King on the budget of a beggar.  My girlfriend and I get a couple sushi rolls (3$ each) and the Fish Tacos and the Avocado Egg Rolls.  Go on Sunday...HAPPY HOUR ALL DAY!"}
{"text":"It was my nieces birthday and we had several kiddos in tow.  Although the decor has changed to a more clubby atmosphere the menu does not disappoint and I was happy to see my all time favorite go-to items.  Fish tacos rarely disappoint and my sister had the chopped salad.  Kiddos enjoyed the bento's with the most delicious pasta!  My fork was making frequent trips to sample. Wow!  I want to order a kids bento next time.  We always get the crab special rolls and miso soup as a starter.  A great place for the entire family.  Always a stop when I'm in the mall."}
{"text":"This place is GROUND ZERO for Summerlin MILF's. If you are on the prowl, then the Kona is a 5+ star rating.  I sometimes used this place as a last stop after a few pops at the Three Angry Wives, in case I needed to see some cleavage. Food is great. Waitstaff is kinda pretentious. The mister on the patio is nice during the Vegas heat, and you can chortle at the D-bags that use the valet parking to show off their Lambos and trophy dates, errrr- escorts. I dunno-- I think you should just check it out for yourself.  Good luck!"}
{"text":"People, back home Kona Grill was at least a weekly stop since it was located inside a mall (Scottsdale Fashion Square).  So I was eager to go back and find some of my favorite menu items.    Met some friends for Happy Hour then had dinner.  Started with our all time favorite Sake Bombers.  Our friends had never had one so we were obliged to show 'em how its done.    The buzz kill was the table next to us full of a bunch bored out of their mind people.  They kept staring at us like we were crazy.  Sorry, but no excuses for having fun-especially when I get a night out with friends-which doesn't happen very often.   Anyway, we ordered up a Crab Special Roll, California Roll and the Avocado Egg Rolls-all my favs-you can't go wrong, that's just how I \"roll\".  We sat indoors and an outdoor patio was available as well.  Happy hour prices are great, appetizers are half off.  Great friendly service and our waitress even recommended a great waiter named Chris and he was awesome too.    My only disappointment was that they were not serving the Mahi tacos for dinner! Say what?  That's like the only reason I came here-boo-hoo.  They must have changed that because it never use to be the case. Being a total creature of habit, I mourned my tacos and then was forced to try something else.  The pasta with shrimp was fabulous, so I was not disappointed.    It was quiet in the dining room not too many people on a Wednesday night. The Happy Hour is worth it with all appetizers being half off and the music was solid, I must have said, \"They're playing my song!\" like 10 times.  So I totally enjoyed the vibe and you could still hear the music where we were sitting for dinner.  I'll come back."}
{"text":"Horrible service from Chris the manager.    Too bad because I really enjoyed the lobster mac and cheese which wasn't part of happy hour but how would I know right?  We asked to see the happy hour menu but Chris points some of the items out all over the place on the regular menu and said he'd come back with a happy hour menu but never did.   Two more pair join us at the bar, we were the first, and they get a server and way better server than us.  We sat at the bar with our shitty spicy tuna roll, and awesome tasting (but not on the happy hour) lobster mac and cheese, while the other party had about 8 plates, tons of drinks, filled water cups.  All I really wanted was to get a couple happy hour cocktail and try more happy hour items.  Water was never refilled and we only saw him twice, three with the check.  The first time was to take the order, second to drop the food, and finally to pay.  He took a couple of our items off the check but who gives a shit about that when good food, or absent food, is ruined by bad service.  I tipped the cost of the discounted items."}
{"text":"Came here with the family for lunch after a morning of shopping.  It was busy, not crowded, but the service was excellent.  The kids meals are a bargain.  My son had his drink, California Rolls, two sides, and sliced oranges for $6 (I think).  He loved it!    My husband who is a picky eater had the pepperoni flatbread and actually enjoyed it.  My daughter and I shared the lobster mac and cheese which was good, but not stellar.  So why only four stars?  It was good, not great.  I wasn't blown away although we would come back again."}
{"text":"About a 3 1/2 stars.  Honestly, I've only been to Kona Grill for their Happy Hour.  Yes.  I'm such a cheapie!  I've not been overly interested in their regular menu because I dunno, for ok looking Pacific Rim cuisine it just looks OK to me.  Just seems a tad overpriced.  But I do understand it's Summerlin so the markup needs to be present!  Seems lots of folks like Kona Grill for Happy Hour!  I think it runs M-F from 3 PM to 7 PM, and also most nights from 10 PM to close.  Keep in mind though the weather, Happy Hour is only available at the bar or the outside patio!  If it's too hot or too cold you're in for a not so happy hour.  Also, bar and outside patio seating is on a first come, first serve basis...don't expect a host or hostess to seat you!  Don't wait, find an open table and sit your fat @$$ down!  It can get super busy.  Happy Hour at Kona Grill has a nice menu selection of food and drinks.  It will definitely keep you snackin' and and conversatin'!  Just go with a few friends and you will be kept occupied for a few hours.  Eat and be merry!  Work on your game!  Trust me...some of you 'mackers' need some practice on your form.  Really, \"Come here often?\" is a pickup line?  Oi.  I may not be the best lookin' guy out there but dammit if I'm anything, I'm overconfident (thanks wifey for putting up with me).  Go out there and project you deserve a hot gal on your arm!  Girl with fake boobs and botox lips says \"NO\", just move on!  There's like a dozen of em' at the bar.  Can't score if you don't play the game!  Start shootin'!  Anyway, back to Happy Hour.  There's a lot to try from their menu.  Some of our faves are:  -Sweet & Spicy Shrimp -Chicken Satay -Kona Calamari -Chicken & Shrimp Lettuce Wraps -Cheeseburger Sliders -BBQ Chicken Flatbread (kinda like a pizza) -Crab Crunch Roll -Atlantic Roll  Of course on Happy Hour, all this food is 1/2 price!  Stock up and feed your friends!  Most things will average to between $4-$6 each item.  Save some money!  The drinks are decent prices during Kona Grill's Happy Hour too.  You can get a Sam Adams for $4, margaritas and cosmos for $5 each, wine selection of the day for $5, or a Bud Light draft for $3.50.  There's a few other specials as well.  Not only can you get fed, but get drunk on the cheap as well!  Reason why my rating might seem a bit low?  Damn, sometimes the quality of the food at Happy Hour isn't the greatest.  It just ends up tasting OK.  Of course for the price you pay you won't get your taste buds knocked off, but I've been to better Happy Hour shindigs.  Hello...Yard House, anyone??  Sometimes the food at Kona Grill can be hit or miss.  Plus, I knocked off a 1/2 star because who the HELL wants to sit out in the patio area when it's like 105 degrees and you're sweating like a baboon?  The fact that the water misters weren't working properly that day ticked me off as well.  Kinda ruins the experience just a little bit.  Service was OK, slow but I can understand somewhat because just about every table in the patio area was full.  And orders were steadily going into the kitchen at a nice rate.  At least our server was nice, and tried their best to keep our water filled since it really was hot outside.    Will I be back?  Sure, but there are so many other places to get your Happy Hour on at!  Kona Grill won't be the top of my list every time but it is a contender.  I hear right down the way at The Cheesecake Factory they have a Happy Hour of their own as well.  I'm pretty sure so does the Gordon Biersch right next door!  So choices, they are a plenty."}
{"text":"I was more than a little concerned when we were seated and I overheard a neighboring table complain about how they had been here for 45 minutes and had yet to get their food, but I was pleasantly surprised when our server, food, and drinks all arrived without delay as we were on our lunch hour. I ordered the Oriental Salad with Macadamia Crusted Chicken. It was delightful! The portion size was more than ample and each bite was an explosion of flavor. Nothing short of heaven! I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I'm a big Kona Grill fan.  It's consistent and good - expected from a chain.  Today we just hit up happy hour.  Lots of half price choices for food: about 7 sushi rolls, AMAZING calamari, tasty potstickers, crispy avocado egg rolls, satays, tacos, sliders, and so on.  Also, 3 pizzas for $6 each.   Drinks include beer, sake bombers, wine, flavored cosmos, and margaritas ranging from $4-$7.50.  Happy hour is always packed here.  Luckily, Kona has a lovely outdoor patio to enjoy their offerings.  Lunch and dinner is also a winner here.  I LOVE the asian salad with macadamia nut chicken.  Chopped napa cabbage, onions, toasted almonds, sesame seeds, and ramen noodles all tossed in a sesame vinaigrette.  Light, crunchy, and refreshing.   I've been pleased with the pad thai many times, along with the macadamia nut chicken entree served with white cheddar mashed potatoes and topped with a creamy, dreamy shoyu sauce.  Delectable.   Finish your meal with a passion fruit creme brulee and you leave feeling pleased with \"fusion\""}
{"text":"Came here for my partner's birthday/our anniversary. Rachel was such an awesome server and their happy hour was so great. The bartender was very friendly and creative as well. We will certainly be returning!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed our experience at Kona Grill. Something about their dining room is strange which makes seating odd. As far as service and food is concerned, I would say they were both top of the line for the establishment, after all, they are part of a mall. The calamari is really good and their food all seems to be fresh and clean. My daughter ordered a really good salad, which was delicious, I must say. If we're ever in Chandler, Kona is definitely an option."}
{"text":"When we came in we were seated right away in a corner by our self's (which is what we like) and our server came over and took our order. The Gouda fondue with all pretzels was really good and hot. We both got sandwiches which were pretty good. But the sweet potato fries were really good! The manager came over to refill our drinks and then our server came back five minutes later and told us the manager forgot! What!? But overall it was good."}
{"text":"While my wife and I liked to take visitors here, and while we did end up going here often, it isn't really our scene. It's a nice place, with great food, but it's the local meat market place for singles. Whether you're a guy or girl you're going to get hit on if you're in the bar area, which is a great ego boost if you need one, but I'd really recommend this place for singles or those looking to hook up by midnight.  If you come here during the day it can be a different scene, as it's more relaxed, though it usually has a good crowd going. Never order a Mojito from here though, in the two years I was living in Vegas, they never made it right."}
{"text":"Last night I had lunch with my sister  They having all day happy hour on Sunday !!  You can get sushi roll for $10  Usually if check in from Yelp they offer you roll or side dish but since they doing happy hour on Sunday I couldn't check in... (I asked my waitress ) Customers service is just ok....not amazing  Food is unique and great."}
{"text":"My daughter and I used to enjoy going to the Kona Grill in Fairfax, Virginia. We recently moved to Scottsdale and were pleasantly surprised to find a Kona Grill here. We went there for lunch on Monday (Labor Day) at about 2:00pm. When we stepped inside there was no hostess around so we waited about 3 or 4 minutes before someone came to the hostess area to help us. The hostess was not particularly friendly and she told us we could sit wherever we wanted. We went and picked out a table. We waited there for about 7 or 8 minutes. Nobody ever came to the table to help us. Overall we found the whole experience pretty annoying, so we left.   Note to management - when a customer steps inside your restaurant, somebody should be there to greet them. Nobody should be left waiting around at your hostess station for help. And if they are left waiting around, the hostess should say something like \"sorry to keep you waiting\" or pretty much any other polite words.  And when customers are seated, somebody should come by fairly quickly to at least take their drink order. Service matters, folks."}
{"text":"I have been to this location and the City North location on multiple occasions. We really like the happy hour deals. My boyfriend and I went on a double date the other night and sat on the patio. The server did not seem like he was happy to be there. During our meal we decided that we should leave quickly, not because of the service, but becuase there was an employee (probably off the clock) sitting at the table next to us smoking. The smoke was blowing right into my face and as a non-smoker, I could not stand it."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant, but the waitress was a bit lacking. It wasn't busy in there, but she seemed to have issues removing bottles and dirty plates from out table.   The food was good, but just a warning - the shrimp and garlic pizza is pretty much caked with shrimp. If you are not 110% a fish fan, order something else.  Husband liked his barbeque pizza, and would go again."}
{"text":"My family and I stopped by for dinner this Saturday evening.   The restaurant wasn't packed.  It was 60% full.  We were seated after a short wait.  My kids order chicken tenders, and a grilled salmon.  We got an appetizer of lettuce wraps, three sushi rolls, and a flatbread BBQ pizza.   The lettuce wraps were well below Flo's, Pei Wei, and PF Changs.   Our appetizer arrived the same time as the sushi and the flat bread.   We thought the kids meals were coming right behind.  We waited and waited.   No mention of them being right out.  After we and finished our meals, we were able to finally flag down our waitress and ask where are the kids meals.   She said the kitchen was busy and behind.  The salmon came our with no sides.  A couple minutes later the rice came our followed by the corn several minutes later.   We had to ask again for the kids tenders.  (Maybe no one orders tenders at this place).  I could have gone to Costco, bought a bag, gone to my house, heated it up and got it to my kid back at the place much sooner.   No apologies and no one cared.  Terrible service.   With so many options in Scottsdale we won't be back at this one for a long long time.   We have had better sushi at Safeway.   If you are looking for a sushi place, try Kodo off of northsight."}
{"text":"I love Kona Grill for their menu and typically friendly staff. However the assistant manager who rang me up for my to-go order the other day was the rudest man I have encountered in awhile. I almost told them to keep the food since I was so horrified by my interaction with him. The fashion square location is great - however I will never eat at the SDQ location again."}
{"text":"Great customer service! The food here is exquisite and so delicious! My date and I love coming here any day of the week.. So relaxing and refreshing always try new flavors and decadent dishes that are well prepared by their chefs! Lovely place place to grab some sushi and a drink"}
{"text":"Got here around 4PM on a Friday for HH and the place was already packed. Got a table on the patio and it was SO COLD, even with the heaters on. I ordered a house wine on happy hour and it was pretty gross (and I'm not picky) VERY sweet. For $1-2 more you can get a good glass of wine on happy hour. Because we were too cold we asked for the check, and the waitress took a while. It also took a while for her to come in the first place, I didn't get my first drink until about 15-20 min after I sat down. I did look at the happy hour menu for food and it looked pretty good. Happy hour is only at the bar area which gets insanely crowded."}
{"text":"Suddenly I had a craving for a vegetarian roll and stop by for happy hours. I guess I made mistake to seat at the table and order 2 vegetarian roll and a martini since happy hours prices are only good at the bar. Service is very robotic and absolutely careless, I will call this an order taker and not a server. Actually I had much better service at the bar in the past. You know sometime, just a little smile go a long way, just saying...."}
{"text":"I've been here many many times and they've all been great experiences.  The food is always consistent and the service is great.  The only downside is if you're coming for their happy hour, the patio is always usually packed.    Happy hour is only served out on their patio, but if you're here to dine through their regular menu, go ahead and get seated inside.  My usual items are: +KONA CALAMARI- served with spicy aioli  Their calamari used to be apart of their HH special where it was only like $5.. but it's been taken off.  It's too bad because although I enjoyed it every time I came, I would not order it for regular price.  It is a decent amount for sharing and the dipping sauce is delicious but at times, our basket would be filled with soggy or really small pieces as fillers.   +BBQ CHICKEN FLATBREAD-really good, just try it!   +ATLANTIC ROLL- my favorite roll on their HH menu!  It has baked salmon, spicy aoili, tempura flakes, cucumber & eel sauce drizzled on top.  If you like salmon, I recommend this one!  +PHILLY ROLL-your standard Philadelphia roll.  This roll is a hit or a miss at most sushi spots because often times the cream cheese overpowers the fresh salmon in the roll but that was never a problem here.   I've had their other rolls too like Las Vegas, Fiery Shrimp and the other basic rolls like Rainbow, Spicy Tuna, Soft Shell Crab--they were all just as good!  I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a good HH spot."}
{"text":"Food is just not good. Been here a few times and always have been disappointed. Only reason i didn't give it 1 start only is because service is actually good. I don't get why this place always attracts crowds."}
{"text":"Great ambiance but it was a bit noisy. Came here for the 1st time and meeting few friends, we had a good food and a great time. I checked in on Yelp and we got free sushi rolls, that was cool!  We shared Pad Thai, Piccaso rolls and Sunshine rolls, surprisingly it was good!  Our waitress was very sweet, so we were happy with the service here."}
{"text":"Had dinner here recently after the outdoor concert at Scottsdale quarter fountain.  Food was decent but the service was a bit slow and disorganized. We ask our waitress about 3 times to bring us silverwares, that's how slow it was.  I had tuna sliders it was delicious and juicy but the sweet potato fries was way to much salt.  Overall experience was okay."}
{"text":"this place was great! they gave me a free complimentary appetizer for checking in!! the sea bass was tender and came with fried rice. the fried rice tasted like something I can make at home but was still good!"}
{"text":"Don't order the sushi here. I've been here twice and the sushi is terrible. The tempura was so stale they were soild rocks. Super disappointed."}
{"text":"They had our drink orders wrong. Poorest service ever and both our water glasses were cracked. To make us feel better about the glasses, she said it was ok, they're glasses our double insulated."}
{"text":"My wife an I had lunch today at the Kona Grill in Fashion Square.  First, if you are a sushi snob, this probably isn't the place for you.  It's just not a 'fine food' restaurant.  Rather it's a chain on the same level as P.F. Chang's or Cheesecake Factory.  You know all of the food will be edible and on the tasty side but nothing particularly special.    The restaurant itself is quite pleasant and the sushi bar is pretty cool.  Service was solid. Water and drinks refilled without needing to ask and our waitress was really nice.  Unfortunately, the food wasn't at the level of the surroundings or the service.  We ordered the Voodoo Roll and the  Picasso role.  Both were OK but I thought they sacrificed flavor for heat (and I love really hot foods).  My wife disagreed and liked both rolls.  I also ordered the spicy shrimp tempura. My advice...just don't.  It was basically battered shrimp with a completely boring hot sauce.  Rather than being light and airy like good tempura, this was just crunchy and a bit greasy.    My wife is an eel lover.  She said that on a 1-5 scale, the eel was a 2.  She thought it was rubbery and, in her words, just not right.  The salmon sushi was just OK and she said the sushi rice was not particularly good.  In addition, although the rolls were nicely plated, they didn't hold together well.   This would have merited thee stars but for the price.  Over $70 for two mediocre rolls and some fried shrimp (yeah, some salmon and eel sushi too but only one order of eel and two orders of salmon) and no drinks is over the top. I can list a half dozen Japanese restaurants in the Valley with far better food and either better or similar prices."}
{"text":"I am giving two stars ONLY because our food was excellent. The waiter and manager tonight were thoughtless and unprofessional. My youngest son spilled a large root beer about ten minutes into our arrival. We informed the waiter and showed him the very large puddle on one other son AND on the floor. He nodded his head and proceeded to talk to the young ladies seated at the table next to us, he then walked away and started chatting with another waiter. He was in no rush to remove the hazard or help my son dry off. About 20 minutes latter, no napkins and no clean up. Three little girls walked through the root beer on their way to the fish tank. At this point my son spoke to the manger. We waited another ten minutes, nothing. I then approached the manager. His idiotic excuse was that they had no towels. PATHETIC. I guess these people won't wake up until someone falls and cracks their head open."}
{"text":"Came during happy hour yesterday and my wife and I were extremely impressed! We shared 3 appetizers. Fish tacos, Barbecue chicken flatbread, and the avocado egg rolls. The dipping sauces for the fish (cod) tacos and the egg rolls were exploding with flavor. I can't speak for the sushi, but everything we had was over the top. Also I enjoyed an ice cold Blue Moon, which was perfect. There are differences from place to place. The last place I went, it tasted like half Budweiser and was about 50°. This was so cold and delicious. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Happy hour is awesome! Appetizers are extremely reasonable! Must try fire cracker sashimi! Most of the appetizers are great! Service is very good! We come here many times on Friday nights. Don't miss it!"}
{"text":"Be sure to stop by this location and sit at the sushi bar and ask for Travis. He's seriously the best sushi chef. Best personality and outgoing chef and if you're super awesome, he just may sing to you :) Sundays, are the best as Kona offers happy hour all day. That means tasty and cheap sushi and saki bombs at a great price."}
{"text":"They have a really good happy hour with 50% off select apps and cheap cocktails, such as the $4 margarita.   I had the avocado egg rolls and crab crunch roll, but very delicious!  Overall the food is really good but the drinks are a little strong for me.  But for people that enjoy a very strong cocktail, this is the place to go.  They definitely don't skimp on the alcohol here."}
{"text":"Great service! Our server was super nice and helped us first timers with the best selections from the menu. Most definately try the Wave Roll.. Yum! Honestly wasn't super excited about the other 2 rolls we ordered, but Bethany our server was awesome!"}
{"text":"I've always been a Kona fan. So when my friend decided on this place for the dinner before her bachelorette party, I knew exactly what to expect.  We had made a reservation, so they were prepared to accommodate our large group. What they weren't prepared for was how their other customers would feel. They decided to place us next to the railing inside the mall, and while the majority of our group tried to stick to general restaurant etiquette, some of us failed. Those of us that were did a LOT of apologizing to the tables around us. I feel like Kona should have placed us in a more private location, being that we forewarned them that we were a bach party.  Our waiter didn't help the situation either. While he did cater to our ladies shots requests, encouraging things like sake bombs, he was also very sarcastic and rude when it came to everything else. He made a lot of off color jokes and comments about our get ups that weren't \"ha ha\", but more of \"you're all morons\". Here's a tip buddy: don't talk down to your customers. Especially ones that are likely going to be your biggest tip of the night. Our less than appropriate waiter had a younger female waitress helping him w/ orders and food delivery. She was awesome. She did her best to make sure everyone tabs were correct and fixed a few order issues that her counterpart had no interest in remedying. Such as asking the bartender for ginger beer for our one lady who foregoes booze. He scoffed at her and went to the next person to order. While our female savor went straight to the bar and brought back the ginger beer w/ an apology and promise that none of her \"beers' would appear on our check.  The food was really good (this is what I knew to expect). Most of the ladies went between pizzas and sushi, both were enjoyed. Their updated drink menu was very good. We very much enjoyed that you could actually see what the drinks looked like on the iPads that served as drink menus. Some table faves included: raspberry crush, strawberry basil lemonade, pineapple honey mojito, and the strawberry fizz.  All in all, our experience was good, mainly due to the menu and our female waitress (I WISH I could remember her name). I know the bride will definitely be coming here again. As for me, if I'm in the area I might visit the bar."}
{"text":"My favorite items to eat here at the salads and sushi!  They use fresh ingredients and you can't go wrong with any of the selection!  This is one of my family's go to places. Their happy hour is also amazing!"}
{"text":"My favorite thing at Kona are their salads and sushi. They have fresh ingredients and you can't go wrong with any of them."}
{"text":"I ate dinner here one evening after catching a late matinee movie.  We ordered sushi for an appetizer.  I've had better, but it was not bad.  I would order it again from this location.  The service was good as well.  Waiter was attentive without bothering us too much.  I ordered a dinner salad which was great.  My b/f had the salmon which he enjoyed also.  While I would probably not make a special trip to go here, I would stop in again if I was already at the mall."}
{"text":"Edamame so-so, sushi sashimi combo good, miso soup great, price was great by chicago standards!"}
{"text":"We made a reservation via Open Table and were quickly seated when we arrived. Service was prompt. We had the shrimp salad with several sushi rolls. Everything was prepared as requested.  We did experience a bit of a wait when we ordered an additional roll after the first couple were ordered; close to 20 minutes for the last roll to come out. Had the restaurant been busier to where our server was nearby, we would have cancelled instead of waiting. Unfortunately, we were only one out of three tables in the dining area at the time.  Overall the food, ambience and service was good."}
{"text":"Kona Grill is our favorite place to relax and hang out with friends. The atmosphere is very comfortable and the food is delicious. Their outdoor seating area is pretty large with an indoor/outdoor bar. You can tell it's a local favorite as it's always packed and the servers know the regulars.  On our last visit we were a large group with kids after a movie at Red Rock. The servers helped us gets seats together and took our orders promptly. Sat-Sun is happy hour all day long and they never rush you. We were visited a few times by the Manager Troy, he was so nice & attentive! We had to have a piece of their carrot cake! It's seasonal so if they have it, get it!"}
{"text":"This place has become our go to favorite spot in Chandler . They have a crazy good happy hour including food and drinks. Their chicken satay and bbq chicken flat bread is amazing . The calamari was very good too. I could go on and on about their sushi as well. We always sit at the bar and our bartenders are always very attentive and friendly. You might have to wait for a spot at the bar as it gets pretty packed around 6ish but they do have a reverse happy hour at 10pm that's has a more chill atmosphere ."}
{"text":"Spacious place with nice atmosphere. Had their Summer in the City which is a sweet cocktail - I would suggest to order to whoever like sweet cocktails, Smoked Gouda entrée which was in my opinion not the tastiest, but still it is served in an impressive way (pretzel bites and granny Smith slices with a melted gouda cheese in a pot, like a fondue - with a candle beneath) and Margherita Flatbread which was really delicious. You can not go wrong with Margherita...  Waitress was very friendly and took care of us pretty well.  Not a Sushi person and didn't find too many meals in the ordinary menu to my liking, so that would be the only drawback. Other than that, a nice place to go to."}
{"text":"What a great place for happy hour food and drinks. We love sitting at the open air bar and enjoying discounted chow.   Try the jalapeño yellow tail sashimi.  It is an awesome combination of flavors.  They have about 20 menu (food) items that are on happy hour.  Sunday is happy hour from open until 10 pm."}
{"text":"Went in about a week ago during happy hour, wanted to redeem my yelp free appetizer and the waitress said we couldn't... that we had to purchase a specific dish in order to get that deal?? Okay.... anyways we didn't get our order in for about 30 mins, and we never got our silverware, napkins until we asked for them... I've been in plenty of times during happy hour and I can tell you it wasn't nearly as busy as other times for service to be this slow. Out waitress was pretty rude and didn't acknowledge us, we had to constantly ask others to get things for us as she never came back around to ask how we were doing. Hope service improves!"}
{"text":"I've been 2 times here and both had a good ending. I enjoy what I order, which is mainly sushi and some of their pasta dishes. Good service and nice environment."}
{"text":"My first time dining at Kona Grill was a success. I was really pleased with the service and food. I will definitely return in the near future. I recommend the Avocado Egg Rolls, Potstickers, Grilled Apple & Brie Flatbread, and Chicken & Broccoli Stir-Fry. Yum!"}
{"text":"Luis is by far the best server Iv ever had. As well as the service was quick, made sure our waters were filled, let us know what was new on the menu and what was popular ."}
{"text":"I have mixed reviews of this Kona grill. The food is what you would expect and the service is good but they have a serious problem with their AC. I have been inside twice, once was for pick up and the other time was for dining in. Both my husband and I were sweating through our meal. My husband got so uncomfortable he paid cash so we didn't have to wait for our credit card. When I went in for pick up it was the same issue. I casually mentioned the heat issue to the manager and just said it's because the doors to the patio are kept open. Hopefully they find a way to fix the AC if they want to be functional in Arizona!"}
{"text":"Pretty good place for happy hour.  Generous happy hour times and days.  You just can't beat $3 spicy tuna rolls.  Service is pretty good.  The inside seating is a bit limited.  Unfortuntely al gore has brought us too much global cooling, so we'll have to wait til summer to sit outside. :)"}
{"text":"The food is a hit or miss at best here at Kona Grill and with so many other great restaurants to eat at in the Vegas valley, I would just skip over Kona Grill.  They renovated the entire place in a chic gray color scheme and added on a second story.  On our most recent trip here the server was extremely friendly and attentive.  If you do eat here be sure to check in on Yelp and get a free appetizer or sushi roll!   We Ordered: -Spinach and Artichoke Dip ($11.25 free with the Yelp check-in though!) - I wasn't too impressed with this, the dip itself was a bit on the watery side.  I didn't even take the left overs home which is saying a lot because I always take home left over food if I can! -Classic Caesar ($5.75 for side size) - This also underwhelmed me too, the salad was underdressed and the dressing itself was a little bland. -Chicken Chili ($4 add on to entrée) - The best dish from everything we ordered!  The corn bread was tasty and the chili was warm and filling.  I'm surprised with how much they gave us too for it being an add on side soup.  The mini cornbread muffins were delicious too the jalapenos in it gave it a nice kick. -Pulled Pork Sliders ($12.50) - This dish was good but just your basic pulled pork slider, what surprised me the most were the sweet potato fries usually I don't like them they were pretty good here the sauce that comes with the fries was to die for too.  -Basil Pesto Linguine ($16.75) - I only had a bite of this but from what I tasted it was okay, a little on the bland side.  The garlic bread that came with it was disappointing too.      To be honest, I really don't see myself coming back here...friendly staff and cool decor though."}
{"text":"I love this place! I've recently tried this place because a close friend of mine recommend it to me and my family and I go almost every other weekend and the food is just really amazing. Our favorite is the flatbreads and pad tai and I strongly recommend you give it a try."}
{"text":"I ordered the Big Kahuna Burger. It came relatively fast and the first thing I noticed was that the lettuce was shredded. Now, shredded lettuce is not a real big issue and I think most people don't care, but in my experience, I think it's really huge mess. So if you're not into shredded lettuce, watch out and request it not shredded. Also the bottom bun was soaked and was dissolving. The juice even made the fries soggy! The fries I felt were not exactly fresh either. They got cold really fast. I understand these kinds of burgers are huge and I guess you have to expect it's going to be really messy, but I just wasn't impressed at all. I've had this burger at another Kona Grill and I remembered that one to be really good; it wasn't a huge mess! In my opinion, if you're going to serve huge burgers, at least minimize the mess it's going to make. Maybe the burger and I weren't a good match today.....  Another issue I had this location was that the waitress tried to avoid our table because I'm pretty sure she knew I wasn't satisfied. She would have to pass by and threw a glance at us. She stopped for a sec to take a request, but rushed off, pretty much cutting me off. Instead, she just gave us boxes to hasten our leave! Then came and did the same thing when she brought the check. Now people will say she's just busy, but trust me, I reacted to the burger well enough to show I wasn't that satisfied because I barely ate it. I don't like being unreasonable, but I felt she was being rude by avoiding the criticism which I was going to be constructive about. I paid tip but I don't think she deserved it. Also, the girl who sat us in was also very disinterested. Service was busy at the time, but it was off nonetheless. I thank the manager who at least asked us if we were OK at first."}
{"text":"Really like this place!  I go here all the time with my boyfriend and friends for their great happy hour. The sushi is really fresh and delicious. My favorites are the Atlantic roll and crab crunch. They also have really yummy pizzas! The margarita pizza is really good (good size and thin crust). Outdoor seating is awesome! Misters in the summer and heat lamps in the winter. Great place!"}
{"text":"I went today for a business lunch with customers.  The decor was very well done, the service was attentive and the food was wonderful.  I had the Ahi Tuna sandwich which was served rare as it should be.  The tuna steak was thick, perfectly seasoned, and cooked to perfection.  It had a nice grill flavor and was quite possibly the best cooked piece of tuna I have ever had.  The sandwich had avacado, sprouts and was on a nice bun.   Nothing to complain about, at all everything was perfect.  When I'm back in town I will return.  Well done!!!"}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE! Food is amazing, happy hour is on point, and the service was phenomenal. Sit in the patio lounge during happy hour, especially in nice weather. Also, Jonathon is my favorite server!! Such a nice guy! He was SO on top of our orders! With a crazy big Italian family, that means a lot. Definitely ask for him!!! Yum, yum, yum!!!"}
{"text":"Was there last night..Love the food..  Dj Dynamixx played a wide variety of great hits! Good place to chill, eat, drink a few with your friends!  We will be back"}
{"text":"My go to place for cheap sushi.  Don't miss happy hour or reverse happy hour for half price rolls.  They're about $3.  Best deal in town!  The place is super good and fantastic atmosphere.  Their fish tank is gorgeous and the inside has beautiful water features."}
{"text":"I've *never* had a bad experience here! Huge Kona fan.  Especially love their Happy Hour price points (1/2 off) of their rad apps/sushi rolls. Some recommended items would be:  Spinach Artichoke Dip (served w/tortilla chips) Spicy Tuna Roll Calamari w/the Aoli (sp?) sauce Lettuce Wraps Potstickers  Service is swift and accommodating always. Patio dining makes for good people-watching (esp after 9pm on weekends).   Their music choice is GREAT at this location, to BTW. #happyeater"}
{"text":"Went to this place for the first time. Not impressed. We sat at the bar outside and the fan was blowing full blast right down on us.  The bartender was terse and took her time to wait on us (Kristen) She spent more of he time chatting with her friends across the bar and sharing pictures on her phone with them instead of paying attention to the patrons at the rest of the bar.  It took her some time to come back to take our order for food.  When the shrimp arrived it was spicy which we expected but for Asian food don't use white pepper to increase the heat, they use red chili peppers. This place does not know much about Asian food. It was awful.  I also asked her for water twice. She said ok and walked off.  Then she walked by us several times bringing drinks to others at the bar never once looking at us and never bringing me my water.  We finished our food and drinks asked for our bill, paid and left....she had not problem getting our bill quickly though."}
{"text":"Our waiter was a bit spacey, and our food was just ok."}
{"text":"Kona Grill used to be one of my favorite places when I first moved to Las Vegas a couple years ago. But as I've gotten to know a lot more of Vegas I'v realized this place isn't on par with some of the great restaurants around town. I've mostly only come here for happy hour. They've got a great outside patio, if you get here early enough to get a seat. They have some good food too but they love to over stuff all their sushi with crab coleslaw. So your really just getting a big ball of rice, with crab slaw and a tiny piece of fish on it. Extremely disappointing if you have an appreciation for good Sushi. But they do have a lot more than sushi to choose from and most of it is decent. The drinks are good and reasonably priced during happy hour."}
{"text":"I have dined at this location of Kona Grill quite a few times now and I have decided that they have some items that are really good and some items that are really bad.  To start off the service can be hit or miss. I had good service today, the hostess's name was Ariella and she was very nice and accommodating. I have eaten sushi here in the past and I would steer anyone away from it. I would recommend Stingray or even RA down the street on Scottsdale Road if you are looking for decent sushi. I had a rainbow roll here once and it tasted like rotten fish - disgusting. This was not enough to completely drive me away because I had also had the pan Asian noodles with beef which were amazing and delicious.  Today for lunch I had the perfect pairings lunch menu and I had the clam chowder and Caesar salad (yes I had soup in 118 degree weather and it was delicious). I would highly recommend the clam chowder here, it does have bacon in it and it is amazing. The Caesar salad was fresh and the Caesar dressing was very tasty.  Overall I have had hit or miss experiences at Kona Grill. I will be back for the clam chowder, never the sushi and maybe some drinks."}
{"text":"Have eaten here before but I am disappointed, raw macadamia nut chicken and the oriental chicken salad tasted just off. Service was good, Gray saved the day when we were sitting there without a greeting for 10 mins. So thanks but no thanks!"}
{"text":"This now our 3rd attempt at Kona Grill at High Street. This could be our last. We sit down at the outdoor bar. There for at least 5 minutes and no one acknowledges us. Look square at the bartender who could clearly see us and ask if we could get a server. Fast forward another few minutes and our server finally shows up. Very casual and not very attentive. We order 3 simple dishes, California Rolls, Fish Tacos and Spicy Shrimp Tempura. Ca Rolls delivered by a young man. No napkin and silver service OR plates. Request those and the waitress finally brings them out. The CA Rolls were okay, the Fish tacos were massive over salted and the Tempura was heavy vinegar and very spicy.   The lack of attention and the mediocre food will have us probably not going back which is a shame. We really want to like this as it is local for us. Oh well!"}
{"text":"Had dinner tonight here with another couple. The food was excellent and our server, Miles, was a pro.  Because I'm on a low-carb diet, I had the seared Ahi with bok choy and had them hold the rice. It was extremely tasty.  I don't want to nitpick but there were a couple of things that I noticed which prevents me from giving them five stars. When they came to take our plates after the appetizer, they asked us to keep our forks. I'm sorry but I want a clean fork with my entrée. Another thing I noticed was the pendant lights over the greeters desk had a bulb missing and when I went to the ladies room, my stall had a lightbulb which was burned out and I was in almost complete darkness. These are small things but a fine dining restaurant should pay attention to these small details.   Overall, I would return."}
{"text":"The calamari was literally my favorite thing. Highly suggest getting that to start off! The wave roll was so fresh and delicious, but the best selection was the Chicken and Broccoli. The staff was nothing but fun, helpful, and best of all quick. Go here, you'll love it!"}
{"text":"Service is good and the food is decent - IF you can snag a table! The happy hour here is one of the best in town. The happy hour menu is super-cheap and includes a lot of choices, from Asian to Mexican to American. Sitting on the patio is kind of weird, as it's an enclosed space that is next to valet parking for the mall, so you get a free side of exhaust with your goodies."}
{"text":"Placed a to-go order for poke, after having it dine in the weekend before. I ordered two of the exact same, sauce on the side for both, crab scoop added on both, and no onions on both. I usually hate ordering for pick up because it's inevitable that it will be incorrect so I repeated my order a few times, asking her to confirm the order. She read it back perfect. Unfortunately we got there, only one bowl was made. Somehow our conversation started with two, and when I hung up the phone she only entered one. On top of that, the sauce was already mixed in the bowl, and I didn't realize this until I was home. We didn't have time to wait for them to make another bowl, so we just took the one and my boyfriend ended up w lite nothing. On top of it all, it came out to $16-17 for a weak portion and incorrect order. I went to poke bar the following day and paid $10 for higher quality, a correct order, and larger portion."}
{"text":"Grea happy hour options: Sushi, sake, cocktails...and everything is soo good!"}
{"text":"Ok. This review might be a little like going grocery shopping while hungry. I say this because I sit here waiting for our server Julie to come pick up our check. Waiting seems to be the theme of the night. We arrived after 8pm on a Saturday and expected a long wait. It's probably the shortest wait we experienced. Seated after 10 minutes. Drink order taken by Julie within a couple minutes. Now start your timers. Julie returns in a short amount of time with water and soda for our teenage companion. Explains our drinks will be out soon. Twenty minutes. There is NO excuse for that. I'm paying $10 per drink. Why should I wait. Meanwhile the place is emptying out in front of us. Hopefully they all had a better experience. Food order in before drinks delivered. And I'm excessively annoyed. Did I mention it took 20 minutes to get a sake bomb and a margarita??  Ok. The beer glass for the bomb is hot. So we ice it down which takes a few minutes. By then I have finished my drink (which is on the small side for a margarita)-but hey, I'm a lush and I worked my ass of this week so I deserve it. Anyway. Our server doesn't return until I finally grabbed the hostess and asked her to tell the waitress I need another drink.  At that point, our food is delivered by a runner. Food. Was. Awesome. All of it. Flatbread pepperoni. Cuban sandwich. Pork tenderloin. Zero complaints. It was worth every penny. My second drink comes next. And I contemplate ordering another since at that point I have been there 45 minutes and only had one drink. I didn't. The Running God orders another sake bomb which arrived quickly and again with a hot beer glass. Julie checks on food. I ask for another drink. At Kona for one hour by then. I'm sorry, is this not a bar/restaurant?? Why do I have to keep asking for drinks?  Are servers no longer suggesting or at least checking on whether anything that costs $$$ is needed?  Apparently not Julie and not tonight. By then, our server had one other table that we can see so why can't we have some attention. Please. I'm looking for a reason to tip you well because you seem like a nice girl. Alright no wait for third drink but check is delivered immediately afterward without even asking if we wanted another ($10) drink each. Or dessert?  I ran my ass off at the mountain yesterday and today so maybe I was interested. By then I was as annoyed as I could be so Julie got less than 15%. Being a food server and bartender in my previous life, I wouldn't blame anyone for not tipping well if I took care of them so neglectfully. Anyway. Our food was completely worth the $15-$20 price range plus some. But why am I paying $10 each per drink when I feel like my server is some sponsor at AA who is trying to deprive me of the enjoyment I waited for all week?  Worst experience at Kona ever. And sadly his is a place we like to regularly come for happy hour. I guess we should just stick to happy hour. Or run toward Sir Vezas anytime we see that server again. I'm hoping management reviews my review."}
{"text":"I love this place! I've been coming here for years. Perfect for a drink and some sushi after shopping :) try the calamari"}
{"text":"I am definitely a fan -- have been for years!  Love the HH at Kona Grill!  Food is tasty and their sake bombers are wonderful!!  They have a long list of happy hour food choices which is nice, not much for sushi aside from the standard, basic rolls, plus 3 \"special rolls\" which were certainly not three of their best.  We also had the avocado egg rolls, cheeseburger sliders, calamari and flatbread buffalo chicken pizza -- all wonderful choices!!  The patio is great -- people watching and car watching doesn't get any better!  The misters are an added plus in the summer heat.  It does fill up and people do hover when your check arrives, but it's still worth it!!  FYI -- I have taken the kids before, they are only allowed on the patio, not in the bar area."}
{"text":"Great ! Had vegan menu ! So yummy. Happy hour was so packed we ended up just eating. But was worth it ! So good !"}
{"text":"This Kona location has gone downhill since initially opening.  Not only has the food begun to lack attention to detail and sushi sloppily presented, but they also completely removed happy hour and reverse happy hour.  Scottsdale Kona has happy hour all day Sunday - this place doesn't.  When asking a manager about happy hours being removed, they stated \"we have enough clientele that we can charge regular prices all the time\".  NOT COOL!  So you're telling me that because people come all the time, it's okay to get rid of deals and rip us off all the time - great, I (and my group) won't be coming back anytime soon until Happy hour, reverse happy hour, and all day Sunday happy hour re-appear."}
{"text":"Delicious food! Trendy but great food at a great price, reverse happy hour is a must! (10-12am) I think... YUM!!!"}
{"text":"We had a birthday dinner tonight , a group of 20 , ambience was great but service was bad , we waited about 30mins for drinks, I had to walk up to the bar and order my own drink, like seriously , twice I had to walk to the bar , even though we had 2 servers handling our table. You might think , ya it was a large group , no that wasn't the case , some of got our drInks and others didn't .As for food , it took about 45mins to come out , after our drinks, there wasn't even bread or samples provided while we waited for our food , so here we are seating with half empty drinks, and no water served , no complimentary apps while we waited . So close to 2 hours when we finally got our food . They weren't anywhere close to capacity , they had a lot of empty tables. When I spoke to the manager Denis , she said they were short staffed and had difficulty managing the capacity, they had 2 large groups , and about 4 tables ......not even half full ...problem I had was that the manager new we weren't happy cause I over heard a conversation between the manager and server about our table weren't  happy , they did nothing , not even walk over and check in with us , only after the bill came and we paid did the manager pop up .....she acted as if she didn't know wat was happening , come on people you the manager and you knew or drinks and food took long to come out .....we didn't even finish our food , we just packed up and left like the table next to us did when we we seating , totally bad customer service at this resturant ......long review , but I thought It was necessary to share our experience , I hope all 15 of my friends post their review , and we won't be going back there, hope they improve their approach and service cause they didn't Even come close to Mcdonalds customer service amd we now how bad that's is ....."}
{"text":"My husband and I first tried Kona Grill in Vegas for his birthday trip and really enjoyed it. The atmosphere was great, the staff were friendly, and the food was really good. There are no locations on the east coast (that we know of) so you can imagine our excitement when we moved to Arizona to find that there were lots of locations here.   A couple weeks ago we came to this restaurant for dinner. We walked in and we're not greeted by a single person within a 10 minute span. Not the young female hostess sitting at the front on her phone then looking at us, huffing, and walking away, not a single waitress that came to the front to grab extra menus or cutlery, not even whom looked to be the manager standing near the bar who could visibly see us waiting. Now, if we weren't in such a mood where we just didn't care and were willing to put up with the snootiness because we just wanted to sit down and eat, I usually would've walked out. And this particular aspect of the dining experience made me want to make this review a 2 star so badly, but once we were finally seated, that changed...a lot.   Let me just say that I don't expect sushi at fusion restaurants to be amazing. And from the sushi I've had at legit Japanese restaurants, I've been really disappointed with the quality here in Arizona. However, the sushi that we were served on this particular night from Kona Grill was arguably the best sushi I've had in years. We were literally fighting on who got the last of which dish. The calamari was also great and the cocktails (we had a cucumber south side) were incredible. The bartender who ended up serving us was incredibly kind and pleasant to talk to, and the chefs that were working that night hopefully got our compliments because they did an amazing job.   We will be back because of the food and drinks alone, but next time I hope to be greeted and seated within a few minutes of entering the restaurant. I would at least like to be acknowledged, I don't think that's too much to ask as a paying and returning customer. It it weren't for the terrible hostesses, this could have been a 5 star review. Your bartenders and chefs however deserve a lot of credit."}
{"text":"Settled in pretty late at the hotel and this was the only close place opened that was low carbs (somewhat); happens that it was happy hour. I had about 20 minutes left and ordered as much as I can.  The lemon drop, which was recommended by the waitress was horrible. Tasted like 7up.  Potstickers: pan seared chicken, it was pretty good. I enjoyed it  Avocado egg rolls: i love avocado, so can't go wrong with this dish. However, I still think Cheesecake factory is better.  All their sushi rolls were below average, too much rice and not enough stuffing. Keep in mind, the rolls are pretty small. The combination sashimi was okay, the fishes weren't too fresh.   The California roll: very typical  Crab Crunch and Special roll. Both tasted the same. All I tasted was the artificial crab...  Spicy Tuna Roll: I can see the grading on the tuna was poor."}
{"text":"Just left this place. Sucks to say our tab was $60 and we only had a couple appetizers, sushi and one drink.   Tried to go for happy hour but the restaurant does NOT honor happy hour prices which is seriously stupid IMO. What that means is an overstuffed patio and a completely empty dining room.   The food was not worth it either. Sub par sushi.   Boo Kona Grill."}
{"text":"This place is great.   Seating. I was sat quickly by the hostess with no issues.   Service: perfect I was not over served nor was I ignored. The manager came by to see how I was doing and if I need anything.  My server Marissa got me 3 refills ( I was super thirsty) never had to ask. Before my glass was empty I had a full one. She was very nice and friendly.   Food. Man it was good. Very falirful stir fry without being to saucy.   Atmosphere I did not even feel o was in a mall. Great feel very modern look.   Attitude. So I got to watch the kitchen chat from where I was and they all seemed to be enjoying working here.   Try this place out."}
{"text":"I love this place. LOVE LOVE LOVE. Come here every time I'm in Vegas. I've tried several different things on their menu and they've all been super delicious--especially the salmon sashimi (chefs plate), Las Vegas roll, seared tuna, pad Thai...on and on. The service has been exceptional too. If they make a mistake or you're inconvenienced in any way, they try to do whatever they can to make up for it. Sweet staff, delicious food and a pretty good view of the strip  yes please"}
{"text":"Food was way too average. Service was average too. Ambiance was cool and all but not THAT cool. Might come back if I'm super bored."}
{"text":"Best HH in Chandler!! Great atmosphere and food at an affordable price.   Half price sushi and cocktails!! Can't beat it!"}
{"text":"Overall was an okay experience. The food was a bit too overpriced for generic dishes.   I got the lemon-garlic shrimp penne and it was not anything special. It did make my stomach hurt a little. It would have been nice if it said anything about it being spicy. It was a little too much for me so I didn't end up finishing my plate. The flavor was just all too plain and it got this repetitive taste to it. So it's like a 3/5 to me.  My boyfriend got the basil pesto pasta and he was okay with it. He's not too good with oil so he got a slight headache. I had some of his dish and it was alright, again nothing too special. 3/5 rating from him.  His brother got the jambalaya and he said he did not expect the spice (lol this was his first time trying though) he did like his dish and we tried a bit of his and it was pretty good. I'd prefer that over my dish if anything. 4/5 Service was okay, nothing too amazing. This place was a nice experience, but I don't think I'll find myself dining here again (just visiting the town)."}
{"text":"Came here on a whim while in the Fashion Square area. Originally just came to use the bathroom and leave lol but the decor and vibe caught our attention to just give it a shot.  My date and I sat at the bar, got a warm friendly welcome and immediately greeted.   We got a bottle of wine and shared 2 appetizers. The satay chicken and the spicy shrimp tempura.   Spicy shrimp tempura - good portion of little nicely cooked shrimp coated w a slightly spicy sauce, very tasty  Satay chicken - juicy chicken, good portion. Comes with a cabbage slaw, peanut sauce and hoisin sauce. Cabbage slaw was good. The sauces, yes both, were packed with flavor but very salty. It's like I wanted to dip my chicken in the sauce for the nice flavor but could only dip the smallest corner bc it was so salty.   Only complaint was the salty sauce but would come back. More so for happy hour tho"}
{"text":"I only went for Happy Hour, so I can't say much about regular dining, but I really enjoyed it. It's half off appetizers and rolls and low prices on drinks and pizzas. We had the chicken and shrimp romaine lettuce wraps, crab crunch roll, and the avocado egg rolls. They were all deeeeelicious and well-proportioned. Our waitress was also very friendly and helpful. I also like the location in the Scottsdale Fashion Square. I had a good time walking off my food baby. Some down sides: I guess the outdoor seating is a little bit loud and unglamorous and the parking at the Fashion Square is kind of frustrating. But overall, great restaurant and I'd definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Great place for happy hour, the sushi and the pretzel bites are good. This is a great place to hang out when the weather is nice the patio is open."}
{"text":"Good happy hour prices. Vegas roll here is delish and so is there pizza."}
{"text":"I am definitely a regular of this place as it is in my neck of the woods. As I am sure you have heard before they have a GREAT happy hour, one I am a fan of!   Patio seating is great, and yes even in the Vegas heat! They have a covered patio with misters that actually do what they are suppose to and keep you cool! During busy happy hour times (Friday nights) it does get a little tough to find a seat so I recommend going early to save spots for you and your guests.   Servers are always nice, especially one I have encountered a few times named Eddie. They usually check on your frequently without being overbearing.   Now for the food and drink! I shall review happy hour first!  Sake bombs are a must and a steal at $7 for a large Kirin and large sake. The margaritas are pretty delicious and strong too!   Food recommendations:  DEFINITELY my fave : ahi wonton crisps: fresh ahi seared and sliced on crispy wonton crisps drizzled with a wasabe dressing! YUM! -spicy tuna; cant go wrong with that -pot stickers come with a very yummy dipping sauce and are pan seared - barbeque chicken pizza is very generously portioned and can feed about 3 people ; a steal at only $6  - I would recommend just about everything on the happy hour menu!   Menu food: macadamia nut crusted chicken is also a favorite, served with a good sized portion of mashed potatoes and steamed veggies. Also the oriental chicken salad with the crispy ramen noodles is accompanied with a great sesame dressing.  Overall- a must go/try for happy hour and regular menu food is pretty good too but I stick to the happy hour :)"}
{"text":"5* **claps! Reverse Happy Hour; this place just became my new home. Happy Hour all day Sunday; time to move to this side of town!  After a brutal round of golf @ angel park, this is definitely my \"it\" place to wind down have a drink & a light meal. Service is fantastic, friendly crowd, great food & did I mention Reverse Happy Hour!  Sushi was the craving for the night, so I snapped up the ahi wanton crisp, spicy tuna roll & the crab crunch roll. The ahi was magnificent the horseradish sauce was prominent, not over the top, delectable & delicious, just give me a bag of the wanton crisps which accompanied it & it'll put a smile on my face any day.  Spicy tuna is well spicy tuna, but for some odd reason this edges out possibly the best spicy tuna I've had (sushi para @ chicago), its a remarkably minimal roll, small & explosive in taste (like a grenade of yum!).   Closing out with the crab crunch roll as recommended by the bartender (quite a friendly-chap). Thank you so much for this recommendation, I can finally stop loathing eel sauce! Spot on, great texture, can I have these as mini-snack bites!  In fairness I'm not one to care for ambiance unless its fine dining, my first yelp 5* can't wait to be handing more of these out!"}
{"text":"It's Scottsdale so I expected a sense of the area. The server was nice although I ask for a modification to a roll and he said it would be a 7$ add on per roll? Well I can't have eggs much less mayo so spicy crab mix would make me sick.   The Chandler location was accommodating and was empathetic towards my restrictions.   Fortunately our server was able to correct the 7$ upcharge.  Bottom line my sushi rolls were great!   My date on the other hand, her steak it had no flavor what so ever, I would suggest to management fixing that. I tasted it and spit it back out.  We may be back but I would suggest the other location"}
{"text":"We had a great time here today. Kristina was our server and did a great job, she knew the menu inside and out and had the chefs accommodate my unheard of request for sushi. I even met the GM Steve who was very nice. Asked about the food and the experience. Overall best experience I've had at a Kona Grill so far. I hope the new location in the valley has the same great staff and corporate support!"}
{"text":"Had caterpillar roll, California roll, tuna tatami roll. It was good, not over the top amazing, but good. Our waiter, Will, was helpful, knowledgeable, and friendly, reason for 4 instead of 3."}
{"text":"I visited Fashion Show location last night,  we usually go to BOCA by our house, but were in the area and hungry. Our server was Megan, super sweetheart!!! She was helpful and knowledgeable about the menu as I was wanting to try something new. She recommended a few rolls that I haven't tried at Kona before (which were all amazing). Drinks were never empty and she was genuine and friendly. Props to the sushi bar as well."}
{"text":"When you have an offer for a free appetizer or sushi roll and then tell me after I've ordered it that it doesn't count if you order anything else but an entree that's pretty ridiculous. I was bout to order about $30 in sushi but she said I'd have to order a $15 sandwich if I wanted the appetizer free, because the manager is that stupid I chose to go next door to RA and pay for the appetizer, plus I had drinks. Manager not too sharp, and nowhere does it say must order an entree for the free appetizer or roll, other than that the bartender was good which is why I gave 3 stars."}
{"text":"Perfect place for b-day dinner with the family.  Happy hour out on the patio, margaritas, sushi roll's, won ton's, pad thai.  All very tasty, great prices, good service.  Overall, I think this is one of my favorite local restaurants.  Not a big fan of chains, however I don't really feel like it's in that category."}
{"text":"Love the unique variety here. The whole family was happy. The kids menu is great with a lot of choices. Food was delicious. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great place if you're single and want to meet an unhappy housewife, or Kim Kardashian wantabee, in the bar. But, pick a different place for dinner.  I've actually been going there 10 years, and seen the place steadily decline.   It's become a lot more of a corporate run, and the quality of the food reflects it.   Skip the Sushi Bar, there are so many other better places in town for Sushi.  Their lunch menu for Hamburgers and Sandwiches are good.   Salads are okay, if you don't mind bagged lettuce. Don't ask them to make anything special or different. Corporate doesn't allow that.   Also, they do serve bread, only upon request, but the quality of the bread is such that you will want to take the loaf home, and use it for football practice.  If you have a favorite server here, don't get too attached. They have a very high turnover. Hostesses are snotty, because all the middle aged married men and all the single guys, who are desparate, hit on them, and give them \"swollen egos\".  Also, you will get exercise going there. Parking is always tough, and the front is reserved for \"leased\" exotic cars that belong to guys that are one paycheck away from bankrupcy, and need the cars to impress the Kardashian wantabees."}
{"text":"We decided to catch a movie @ Harkins & grab a quick bite beforehand at the Fashion Square location.  We sat at the outside bar & Brandon waited on us.  We told him we had only 35 minutes before our movie at 7:30.  He explained that the Sushi bar was backed up so Poke would take a bit longer.  I ordered the Chopped Salad & Boo got the Chimichuri Flank steak.  The chopped Salad was excellent one of the best I've had.  It had very tasty bacon, cherry tomatoes, boil egg, & greens with just the right amount of honey dijon mustard dressing.  It was a huge serving.  The Flank steak was flavorful but very chewy & tough.  The chimichuri sauce was delicious as were the green beans & mashed potatoes.  We were able to order, eat & check out within 30 minutes.  Brandon was super attentive & very personable. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good but the service was another story. I'll start by saying that the soft shell crab po boy and sweet potato fries earned a thumbs up from my Dad. I would also give a thumbs up to the Philadelphia sushi roll. A bit expensive though but it is Boca Park so it's to be expected. The outdoor seating was also wonderful.  Now here is where the 2 stars come from. In all reality I wanted to do 1.5 but it is not an option. The waiter was very disengaged and unhelpful. The girl at the entrance had more personality and made us feel more welcome than the waiter did. The sense I got from him was that he had something better to do or his mind was off somewhere else. We asked about the pork sliders pictured on the menu and his only response was \"they weren't on happy hour.\" Ok, that's nice, but are they available now? When he came back with change for the meal he actually leaned over me to put it on the table. Rude. Plenty of room to just walk up to the table and put it down and say \"thank you\" like any other person would do. I also had to ask him to repeat himself as he was quiet and was leaning on the metal fence near our table which put him a few feet away from our table. Not much tact in my opinion.  I might try eating here again but Vegas has many other options for great food and much better service."}
{"text":"To begin I have never eaten here.  I am talking about the bar area only and it's a great time to say the least.  Very chill crowd and great staff."}
{"text":"My reasons for like Kona Grill as much as I do is a bit unique and really has nothing to do with the food.  It has to do with their Effen Cucumber Mojito and mall attachment.  I usually go to the one at Scottsdale Mall, and if I was reviewing that one, I would give it 4 stars because the people watching just never gets old.  At Chandler Mall - it got a little old. No one was too weird, or too skimpily dressed. There was no drama or good eavesdropping or relationships ending.   But, the mojito was still just as refreshing so I highly recommend it. And, as if tasty and refreshing is not already a sell, they use a splenda symple syrup so it only has 100 calories, which means you can have two or three (assuming splenda does not give you a headache or gas pains).  But do be aware that they are not cheap ($10).  The food is okay. We ordered the lettuce wraps and were pleasantly surprised that they were only $6 because of happy hour (instead of $10). I wish happy hour would impact my beloved mojito though.   The lettuce wraps were okay, but not on the same level as PF Changs. In the past, we have ordered an assortment of rolls but nothing standout or memorable or as noteworthy as my drink.  You can never go wrong sititng with a mojito in your hand, under a mister, on a patio, at 2pm, though."}
{"text":"Ambiance was awesome, the neo soul music made for a very relaxing environment, food was great and so was the service!!! My new spot!"}
{"text":"Bring your fly swatter because the manager from Chicago said I'm sorry we can't do anything about it because its a open bar to the outside. I understand this but I could see them inside of the kitchen because we were seated against the glass. When I looked into the kitchen the cooks were just standing out talking to the management. It was not busy when we were there so the either they are of the religion of Hinduism that all life is sacred, to be loved and revered, and therefore practice ahimsa, noninjury, in thought, word and deed or it just isn't important. I don't know and I didn't ask so I can't say either way.  The waiter brought out chopsticks trying to be funny as to bring the idea of the Kesuke Miyagi from the movie the Karate Kid from 1984. I didn't find it funny as the flies were diving upon my wife and I during our lunch.   Enough about the files which are gross lets talk about the food. Our food was just ok, we started the baked spinach artichoke dip, mozzarella, parmesan, tortilla chips $10.50 which was soupy and not thick like I remember it was not hot but just warm. Like I said it was ok, not worth the $10.50 more like $7.50.  I had the macadamia nut chicken house mashed potatoes, seasonal vegetables, shoyu cream, pineapple-papaya marmalade $14.25 and it was just a bit on the warm side of cold. I asked for a extra bit of pineapple-papaya marmalade because what they put on the plate was a dot the side of a quarter (I guess this is more expensive than printer ink due to how rare pineapple is). Again my food was warm and not hot. Being a past cook I would have given it some radar love and made sure it was hot going to the customers. Or at the least put it under the heat lamps so it didn't lose the existing heat. In the end they didn't try...  My wife had the fish taco's for $11.00 and it looked like a good amount of food. You get two of them for the price.   My wife had the ice tea and I had a beer our total for the lunch was $46.08 and feel it should have been $10.00 cheaper as we acted at pest control.   4/22/2014 Earth day 1:30 PM"}
{"text":"I've been here many times and the reason is simple- always great food, great service and a fun atmosphere. Kona is my go to because I know it's going to be a great experience."}
{"text":"Best happy hour in Scottsdale, but other than that just a good place with slightly overpriced food."}
{"text":"Two stars for a two point five star place.  When the kitchen is having trouble getting the right dish out/ ingredients on the right dish there are professional ways of handling it that don't make it to the diners.  Yeah that inspires a lot of confidence.   Avocado egg rolls were great even though 2/3rd of the ingredients the sun-dried tomatoes  and onions were scarce or so finely chopped as to be a homeopathic dose.  Pad thai was underwhelming and not much of a difference between ready made stuff from the store.   Name annoyed me  as anything I'd expect to find in a restaurant named after an area would be some of the foods from that area! It's  American food in the worst sense  Big Island meat loaf?  Oh just  die already."}
{"text":"Ate here for my first time tonight! My friend that I was with had been to the one in summerlin, so we decided to try the one  on the strip.  Our server was Johnny and I can't say enough good things about him. He was polite, attentive, and made sure we had everything we needed. I haven't encountered a server as polite and refreshing as him in a long time. It was a huge part of what made our dinner so awesome. We made it for happy hour and had sushi, lettuce wraps and a couple other little bites. Moscow mules were great. Great prices and quality. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Pretty good happy hour, pretty good sushi, very good apps, and a nice atmosphere make Kona a great spot for dinner, drinks, or a quick lunch.  The only downside is the parking at the mall which is a problem most of the time."}
{"text":"Very yummy food and nice atmosphere, I like their sushi the best! I like the fish tank they have in there :)"}
{"text":"Food was amazing, great happy hour menu! The macadamia nut chicken was one of the best meals ever! And the passion fruit creme brûlée was amazing! Fun atmosphere and our server, Jason, was fantastic!"}
{"text":"I had appetizers and drinks with my friend here on Saturday evening, and the service was ok at first.   I've been here a few times before the remodel, but never really liked it much each time. The food wasn't all that great and the service lacked. However, I told my friend I wanted to try it again and sit upstairs since I've never been and my friend has never  been to Kona Grill period. So I was pretty excited to be seated upstairs.   When I arrived a few minutes late after my friend got us a table, the server checked my ID and got my drink order on the way. The first few seconds of meeting her weren't personable. It was a real quick exchange of can I see your ID and then she walked off. No greet or anything.   We received our drinks, neither one of us was ready to order, so she gave us a few more minutes. Came back, I was ready to order, but my friend wasn't, so she said ok let me know whenever you're ready as she quickly walked off. Not even taking my order.   All in all, the new server who took over since the original one was leaving, she did a wonderful job. On top of our drinks and asked if we needed anything every now and then. Very attentive. I did tell our new server what happened and then the manager got involved. I don't mean to get anyone in trouble, but this place has to really step up their service game. It's a shame because it is a nice venue, but it's never on the top of my list of places to go. And it's so close to my house."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, this was the worst sushi I've ever had. The rolls and other pieces were edible, but the mackerel sashimi was simply unbearable, and I had the awful salty taste in my mouth for the rest of the day to remind me (a taste so pungent, it persisted even after having Mexican food for dinner). wow."}
{"text":"Good service, nice place BUT horrible food. Every dish that we ordered didn't taste good."}
{"text":"The cost of food at Kona Grill is extremely expensive. Simply 2 sushi rolls cost $43.53. The food was not good for the price. They need to lower the price of the sushi or better the quality of the sushi. You can smell the fish indicating that the fish used is not fresh. The service also sucked. The waitress never came to the table. I had to ask other waitors to grab our waitress. Kona grill need to extend their happy hour times especially on Saturday. It ends at 2. I was very unhappy with that. The atmosphere is not as warm as before. Their light is too blinding."}
{"text":"I visited Kona my first day in North Las Vegas based on the recommendation of a friend. I was not pleased with the overall quality of food or service. I arrived at 2PM and was seated in the dining area along with a dozen or less other patrons. I ordered the soup and salad, along with a sushi roll. It took nearly 20 minutes to receive the soup and salad, and another 15 minutes for the sushi!"}
{"text":"Love Kona Grill. However they took one of the best flatbreads off the menu. Please put the Tuna Lobster flatbread back on happy hour.  Such a great snack.  Great service and great food. We will be back for football for sure. Lynn and Amy"}
{"text":"We went to Kona @ SQ this evening because there was a wait at the 4 restaurant prior and it was the only one that could seat us. Now, I know why... First, they sat us in the very back next to the kitchen and it smelled like Fish! I asked if we could be moved, fine. It was still HH, so we ordered drinks and an appetizer. A half hour later, still NO appetizer!!! When the dinner came out I said you can take the appetizer off of the bill as we do not want it after our dinner!! This was our Anniversary and it was a horrible experience as now I am home and feel sick to my stomach.  We will never be returning, awful AWFUL night..."}
{"text":"This is mainly about service. I never have issues with my food. First my family of 4 arrived at the entrance. I was standing there for a few minutes. No greeting or acknowledgment from the 2 at the front desk. My kids and mom were looking at the fish while I was literally standing right in front of the desk waiting for a greeting, or even a \"how many today?\" Two women walk up behind me and the host takes them and sits them down! I immediately spoke up and asked why were they being taken to a table when I've been standing here?? The guy told me \"oh sorry we thought you guys just came in here to look at the fish. We have a lot of people that stop just to check it out.\" That's fine, however I work in customer service. If that's what you thought, you should have still greeted us and asked if we were there for lunch etc. He seemed apologetic, the other girl just looked straight up rude. We were seated, ordered drinks. The waitress forgot my kid's drinks. We received them about 10 min after she dropped off ours, and that was after she visited the table a couple times. Ordered an app, after that she pretty much went MIA. Finished the app and about 10 min after we were just sitting there, she then came to take our order. Just took WAY too long in general. Especially with having 2 younger children. I could maybe understand if they were busy, but it was early afternoon on a Friday. They've been busier and have had better service. Got my day off to a bad start for sure. Should have just turned around at the beginning and took my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Enjoyed sea bass entree and switched out rice for asparagus, excellent healthy and delicious choice. Wife had entree salad which was very tasty and fresh. Christopher provided very good service.  Tip: go to Costco and buy the gift cards, as it's a great savings."}
{"text":"One of our favorite happy hours. pepperoni flat bread, a couple of rolls, fish tacos and drinks is a great deal."}
{"text":"Came here to meet a friend for happy hour today.  I arrived 20 minutes early so thought I'd grab a drink and play Draw Something on my phone while I wait at a table by the bar.  I normally experience prompt service here, but it took someone 15 minutes to say, \"Hi, can I get you something?\"  It was a bit strange to wait so long for someone to come by.    After that the service was good.  I had their happy hour wine Cabernet and my friend had a Sam Adams.  She got the blackened fish tacos and I got the chicken and shrimp lettuce cups.  They were very good, but greasy.  I wasn't sure what was causing the grease, but it made my lettuce cups rip easily.  I normally like the food here, so it wasn't the biggest deal.  They were very tasty, just hard to eat.  I would come here again and get the flat bread and sushi!"}
{"text":"Just discovered Kona Grill has a vegan menu - awesome! Ask for it when they grab menus before they seat you. There are several salads, as you might expect, and several veggie rolls that are completely plant-based. Not all of the salad dressings are vegan (and they recommend one that's not!) so if you're ordering vegan keep that in mind and also, please give them feedback on their vegan menu (corrections, suggestions, etc.). They have a pasta entrée - sounded Italian and blah (what's wrong with Japanese noodle dishes?), but I didn't try this...maybe it's good. They don't have any vegan desserts - it's like they don't want our money.   The grilled vegetable salad had way too much oil on it, but it was still really good. Next time I will ask them to hold the oil. The veggie rolls were all really good - and just as fun to eat as fish rolls, but without the decaying fish burps later on. Service was good. Will be back."}
{"text":"We dined there and the first glass of wine came out with food all over the base. The appetizer plates, two of them had food on them. Two out of five entrées came out of the kitchen cold. I was truly disappointed I have always like this restaurant in the past not sure if I'll go back"}
{"text":"Adam! This guys is seriously awesome. He's so welcoming and just such a joy to talk too. He's super informative when it comes to the menu and has the best sense of humor. Definitely makes eating here such a pleasure. The BBQ chicken flat bread, and the calamari is delicious! Way to go Adam!"}
{"text":"I've had kona before but honestly I must always be intoxicated when I go cuz the food sucked.  Got the angry edamame and it was blah, couldn't even finish half.  The vegas roll was really disappointing, very bland not really vegas roll worthy .  Going to stick to RA going forward for my sushi needs."}
{"text":"Stopped in for gals night out Happy Hour  on a summer Friday eve.  This new location in The Scottsdale Quarter was hopping.  Park in the garage directly across the street from Kona as street parking is difficult. We sat in a spacious booth that can sit six.  There is a huge bar and varied seating options in this spacious venue.  We ordered draft beers, wine and appetizers.  The sushi rolls were fresh, the calamari hot and the avocado stuffed egg rolls delish.  Our server was excellent and all staff we encountered were friendly."}
{"text":"Not bad entree, dessert was a huge disappointment. Service was very friendly and very efficient. Tip: you can only get to it from the outside of the fashion mall."}
{"text":"Had actually never heard of this place. My son and daughter had both been there and liked the sushi. My daughter recommended the macadamia chicken which was excellent. My daughter-in-law had the pork which was also very good. The child meals are really cute and the kids liked them. We didn't have alcoholic drinks but I believe I will go back and try this place again. The service was excellent except for at the end when it got busy and our waitress got pretty busy. It took a little while to get our check. The only reason I didn't give it five stars was because of how loud it gets. I could not hear what my family was saying across the table. I took pictures of my meal and my daughter-in-law's and the kids and will post them."}
{"text":"Love this new location! Their happy hour has a great selection. Yummy rolls for starting at 4.50, the Atlantic roll was my favorite. Their customer service was impeccable."}
{"text":"Kona grill is always a good idea! They have a great selection food or drinks! I've been there three times and their service has been great. No complains. They have happy all day on Sundays!"}
{"text":"I live in the area and I frequent this joint on a pretty regular basis for happy hour. I love their happy hour, the prices are pretty much unmatched. I will admit, I am not a huge fan of their regular menu. I personally think their prices are pretty high for what they serve.   Def a must visit if your looking for some great happy hour deals (which they do all day on Sundays!).   Service is always fast and friendly!"}
{"text":"Staff is super friendly and happy hour is bomb! Love the atmosphere and vibe. Definitley worth coming down to the strip for! You have to come and ask for Teya!"}
{"text":"A summer meal doesn't get any better than a cucumber mojito, sea bass and a huge slab of snicker ice cream pie at this Kona Grill! Great vibe at this location. Trendy,relaxed decor. Easy free parking in garage right across the street. Join their Konavore email list for savings."}
{"text":"To me, their biggest draw is their sushi menu. Very excellent choices...My partner had the meatloaf which was so moist and yummy. I had the jambalaya...I have never had jambalaya so spicy in my life. I could not even enjoy it because of the spice! Other than that, I give this restaurant a thumbs up."}
{"text":"First time here and it was amazing. The food was good! Service was excellent . Nicky was our server and she was on top of everything the whole time. Always had our drinks refilled , kept us updated on our food. We ordered the Kahuna Burger & the BBQ pita , and both were huge ! Very filling and yummy too!"}
{"text":"Dinner was excellent, the service was on point! (Jessica)  Super friendly staff, and a great atmosphere.   Last night I sat at the sushi bar and started with a couple of rolls and some salmon and yellowtaiil sushi. It was my good fortune that the National sushi trainer was there last night. I don't care for white rice so they made my sushi with an amazing crab mix on the bottom instead. Let me tell you it was so good, it's only 7:30am right now and I would totally go back for breakfast sushi! I also  had the oriental salmon salad. The salmon was perfectly cooked and piping hot. Easily the best salmon salad I have ever had.  I plan to squeeze in at least one more visit on this trip and it will be a certain go to for all my future visits to Vegas. Hey how about a San Diego location next?"}
{"text":"We went for their late happy hour and had their amazing pulled pork sliders with sweet potatoe fries. They were delicious. I ordered a glass of wine and did not like it but the waitress easily gave me another selection and was totally fine with it, super nice! I seemed to be out of their normal client base but it was a nice place for happy hour."}
{"text":"The executive chef Josh gave us excellent service! We had the spider roll and the Las Vegas roll. Both were delicious! What really left a good impression was Josh's eloquence and professionalism. He was very diligent in observing his sushi chefs work and going back into the kitchen to check on the other chefs. While doing all this, he made sure to have great interaction with the guests!"}
{"text":"We love this location!! Always the freshest and best food with extraordinary service. Ashley is the best and enjoyed our conversation, as well of her knowing our needs before we did. Great vibe on Friday night! Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Everything except the wait was outstanding. Had an hour wait on a Saturday night not really that bad but once we got seated everything was outstanding. Our waitress was friendly and very interested in making sure we had a great dining experience. My wife and I were able to split a pasta dish and my grand son was able to order a suggestion that the waitress gave us for a \"picky\" eater, my daughter loved her sushi dish. Everything excellent!!!"}
{"text":"Place is decent. Average corp restaurant. The food I tried didn't stand out in any way."}
{"text":"Never really been a fan of this place. It used to be okay prior to their remodel but now it's almost IMPOSSIBLE to find a spot on their patio for happy hour. The prices must of went up and they must have watered their drinks down. Their food isn't the greatest either. I always end up getting a funny feeling in my stomach after I leave."}
{"text":"I know it's a chain, but I can't help but love this place. I recently visited for a lunch break this week and it really was fantastic. I can't comment on the indoor atmosphere or anything as I was unable to get past the peacefulness of the outdoor patio I came across first.   It wasn't very busy and the service was fantastic. We were promptly greeted by our server who didn't seem to mind that it took us 35 minutes or so to even decide on a drink let alone our meal and dessert. He patiently came back and checked on us every so often when he saw we were having a break in our conversation. I was appreciative he didn't constantly stalk us every 2 minutes.   The food was absolutely delicious and came out with perfect timing for each course. We started off with the sweet and spicy shrimp appetizer which was delicious and the perfect size for two of us. Just as we were about finished, our sushi came out. I ordered the las vegas roll, which really hit the spot that day. Just the right amount of food. Lastly, we decided to share the carmelized apple crisp. Mmmmmm. Delicious. We were only able to eat a little more than half of it, which makes me think the individual one might actually work for two people. I'm picky when it comes to baked apples, and this was truly decadent. I also had the pina cojito while I was there which was just a gorgeous work of art in a glass and had the freshest pineapple along with it. I'm glad I don't know how to make those.   In the end, although it's a chain, this is a place i'd come back to. I've yet to try the Macadamia Nut Chicken."}
{"text":"Ok, for starters we had the avocado egg rolls. This alone makes this place 5 star worthy. Even my 9 year old loved them.   They have good choices for kids, for a nicer place. My kids got pizza and had no complaints.  I had the macadamia crusted chicken and it was decent. My wife had the meatloaf but wasn't impressed for the money.   Overall not bad, I would come back for the egg rolls though and give other stuff on the menu a try.   Staff was friendly and helpful. I didn't notice many cougars, but it wasn't happy hour, nor was I at the bar. Haha"}
{"text":"For a menu boasting many dishes and a variety of sushi options I was very displeased in the quality of food. The sauces atop the sushi were not balanced to what the flavor of the fish should boast. I will never come here again but I had a great waitress"}
{"text":"It is unfortunate that I have to update my review from 5 stars to 1 star.  I have recommended Kona Grill to many of my friends and out of town visitors.  I returned to Kona Grill this past Friday to enjoy their happy hour once again.  We were sat immediately outside on the patio.  We were ignored for over 10 minutes..  no one came up and even asked us if we wanted water (in the Vegas summer weather) and there was at least one server around helping other tables.  We just walked out and mentioned why were walking out to two staff members.  Neither of them tried to do anything to keep our business.  We ended up at another restaurant in Fashion Show and loved our experience at the alternate spot.  We will have to take Kona Grill off of our list of favorite spots to enjoy due to the non-existent service."}
{"text":"Was with the family visiting the sights in Vegas (and there are some). We got hungry and this was this place was nearby. This is the one by the mall. It was a Monday and was pretty slow, so we got right in and started to look over the menu.   Well my wife got the Kona chopped salad. It had a lot of stuff including chicken, bacon, eggs and of course greens. My kids of course got burgers, one got sliders and my son got a cheeseburger. They looked like they liked the food since they both ate almost everything and that doesn't happen very often. Me, I also got a sandwich, but the pan seared tuna sliders. My God they were good and I rarely eat sushi grade tuna. Burgers were not small sliders, in between a slider and a standard burger. Just enough to fill you up but not still be hungry when you leave. I am also a fan of sweet potato fries and these are as good as any I have eaten.  Would like to get one of these were I live. I doubt It will happen but I can wish. Great food and would eat here again next time I am in Vegas."}
{"text":"Kona has the best happy hour! They're food is good and they have so many great options on their happy hour menu. Wednesday nights they have live music on the patio and it's great! The one thing is their service is slow and some what chaotic. Our last experience here we came to celebrate happy hour for our birthdays and we ordered 6 appetizers and they completely forgot to ring in two of them. We ordered another meal and they forgot that too. Overall food is good but the servers get busy and overwhelmed."}
{"text":"I love the new location and I love how the patio seating is set up. Such a beautiful set up overall. Food was good and service was good. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Great food, drinks and a killer happy hour!!! Love the patio seating  great for spot for lunch! Rolls to try bama, wave and voodoo all great and on ye happy hour menu, tacos are also delicious! Service could be a bit better but they are always slammed so it's understandable!"}
{"text":"Happy hour is not the same anymore, unfortunately. I ordered a philly roll but had a hard time tasting the actual salmon inside the roll, it was very tiny. All I tasted was rice, cream cheese and a slight cucumber taste."}
{"text":"I came here expecting great quality sushi and fun establishment.  Sat down to order drinks. Both Hubby and I were served a beer and coke.  Both were flat. We asked the waitress who didnt offer to help.. except to say you can have bottled beer but it will cost you. Hmmm.  Ordered Sashimi, some sushi rolls and Gyoza (they call it Popstickers) I have never been more disappointed. I have eaten japanese more than any other and this was a westernised attempt.  When you look around the restaurant and see majority of diners eating burgers and fries, I think that is a dead giveaway that if you want to eat Japanese do some good yelping and find a different restaurant to this one. It also is hard to leave gratuities in America when you receeive next to no service. That made me sick after it was all said and done.  Wont go back....... might try next door.  Did I mention, went home and bought take away on the way... still hungry!"}
{"text":"What a great location...we are locals and can't believe that we didn't know about this location much closer to home till now!  Great service, great place for happy hour.  Very reasonable strip pricing!    Make sure to say hi to Gus our awesome bartender!!!"}
{"text":"Nothing really to complain about. Oh, wait, the Tomato Bisque was salty...to the point I didn't finish it. I did  finish the water though. ha ha! Service was quick. Our waitress was patient with me and my indecisive self. The meal was just the right portion, for a small and quick meal before starting a day."}
{"text":"Really solid atmosphere. Food was great for the price. Good sushi and the flatbread pizza was really good."}
{"text":"This is a place where me and my son, cody would go every Sunday for happy hour sushi. And now my sister comes too. Wonderful place for happy hour! delicious sushi"}
{"text":"Service and staff at the bar have been excellent! Great happy hour! Lots of choices.  Sushi has been good and fresh.  Haven't found a dynamite favorite roll yet.  Plenty of other items look good.  Great location and convenient for me in that I live above the restaurant. I like the variety,  atmosphere and energy."}
{"text":"The pros:  * Great outdoor dining. * AMAZING happy hour pricing. * Hot waiters.  Seriously, they were everywhere, sexing up the place.  There is only one con, but it's a big one.  The food is terrible.  The sushi--which is supposed to be their thing, right?--is inedible.  If you stick to regular bar food, though, this is a great spot for a night out."}
{"text":"This is our first visit to the Kona Grill at the Quarter and it definitely won't be our last...the service was outstanding, our server Colton was pleasant and his attention to detail was impeccable, I also want to mention how Chad went the extra mile to help me with the Valet attendants and last but not least I want to mention how nice it was for the general manager Tom to come out and introduce himself to us...I highly recommend this wonderful establishment to all!!! Check out the happy hour menu and ask to be seated in Colton's section."}
{"text":"The food court at Fashion Square was packed with shoppers eating dinner so we decided to eat here. Over server was not very friendly, never mentioned his name and asked us what we wanted to drink. Our waters never came until we asked him again. I had the Pad Thai and my wife had the Macadamia Nut Chicken.  Our meals were pretty good, my noodles were cooked just right, I ordered it with add-on shrimp. but I didn't find the chicken unless it was pulverized. My wife's chicken was cooked perfectly and moist, but the breading was sliding off the chicken. After taking a couple of bites, the manager strolled by to see if everything tasted okay.  yes. Our sever never came by to check on us until we were done and asked if we wanted dessert. Nope! Just fill my water glass, please. Of course e'll be back, it's just a matter of when."}
{"text":"Always like the atmosphere at Kona Grill. 4/5* It is a great place to hang out after work having some drinks with great companies. I have been here many times and so far food is all right. Pork Tenderloin was nice presentation but it is lack of flavors. 2/5* Basil Pesto Linguine was outstanding delicious by adding Chilli paper and salt. Umm yummy!! 4/5* Lemon-garlic Shrimp Penne was tasty as well but i was adding some chilli, salt and pepper. 3/5* Sushi menu has many choices. I was unlucky, never chose the outstanding yummy one. Sunshine Roll was all right. 2/5* I would go to real sushi restaurants for real sushi. Services is all right! 3/5* Sitting outside or bar area, servers will forget you sometime. But recommend to order everything in one time. Sitting at the bar and ordering from bartender directly is faster!"}
{"text":"This place has a fantastic happy hour. Half off bottles of wine, sake, and $5 rolls, appetizers, etc. The patio is semi spacious, but it's in the mall so there is really no great view, but they do have tvs to catch games. The sushi is fresh, and I\"ve never had a bad experience here with service, food, etc."}
{"text":"Great place to sit outside if the weathers nice, awsome late night happy hour. Service can be slow at times due to everyone ordering for happy hour others always good food and service."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and waiter.. Food is good and they have happy hour from 4-7pm.  Also nice you can do large parties the have a separate room for big parties.  They have a good kids menu.   Would come back again"}
{"text":"If you live anyone near the east valley this place is amazing during happy hour. They have great sushi, pizza, appetizers and beer specials all during happy hour... you do have to sit in the bar area or patio though.  They have a great patio area outside, plenty of heaters for the winter months as well.  The location is on the south side of the mall and right by the food court, parking isn't the best... you could always do the valet if you're feeling lazy.  One drawback is they DON'T have the PAC 12 Network so any ASU football or basketball game shown on that station won't be show here! Was here the other day when the ASU vs UofA basketball game was on and at least 30 people turned around and went elsewhere, I was very tempted as well. Hopefully mgt looks into that!!"}
{"text":"Kona grill is my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas so I thought during my trip I would love the one here in Arizona. Unfortunately Kona took my favorite item off the menu, the shrimp appetizer, my server wasn't very friendly and smelled of cigarette smoke and my chicken/shrimp lettuce wraps tasty so fishy that I couldn't finish more than one wrap. When the waitress asked how our meal was, we let her know that it was fishy and her only response is that it has shrimp in it so of course it's fishy. I know what decent shrimp taste like and it doesn't taste or smell like rotten fish. The only good part of our service was how quick our food came out. I would not recommend this Kona grill to anyone. It has ruined my experience for all of the grills."}
{"text":"I had the worst experience there tonight. The food was great but as for service our serve was horrible took her about 15mins to come and even give us a menu and then another 15mins to come back to get our drinks.. If you ever get a serve named NICOLE run or ask to get another server!!"}
{"text":"Took a party of 10 here to celebrate my mother's 70th birthday.  The general location and atmosphere of this restaurant is nice, but unfortunately that is about it.  The service was slow right from the beginning.  The cocktails were either made incorrectly or loaded with ice so that you are paying mostly for ice.  The waitress forgot an appetizer and was unapologetic about it and made no effort to make it right.  Several of the meals and desserts we initially wanted were sold out and unavailable. The meal portions were small for the price and the service was extremely slow throughout.  My sister ended up getting sick before the dinner was over and had to leave abruptly.  The waitress also smelled of BO.  I cringed every time she had to reach over me.  I gave this place two stars for the atmosphere alone.  Overall very disappointed."}
{"text":"Walked into the new and \"improved\" Kona Grill. Boasting the great happy hour. Sat at the bar and the only HH beer was bud light and it was $4.25. I call BS. If u want a happy hour and one that will have repeat local turnout u need to do much better than that.  The bartender and management could care less with my concerns. So we left. And went down the street to Echo and Rig for a true HH. $3 all drafts. And pints at that. Also $1 hot dogs. Plus much more.  Don't bother with Kona. Not worth it. Over priced snobs."}
{"text":"Excellent sushi rolls, great cocktails. Wife and I came here without reservations on Valentine's Day but got immediate seating at the sushi bar. My wife isn't a fan of sushi but liked theirs.  Very friendly staff. Will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"My daughter and I went here in a Saturday at 1:30. Not to busy because hh ends at 2. We sat at a bar high top. Server came over and we both requested water, she seemed irritated by that. My daughter is pregnant so no booze for her but I was going to order a beer as soon as I figured out what I wanted to eat. The server never came back! It was 1:57 when my daughter went and got a manager. He took our order and my beer and food came out promptly and was as good as always. BUT the server did come back around again you could tell she was mad. Manager finally came back and got us water refills. Sever finally came by when it was time to leave bill. Kind of a joke! No apology by manager nothing!  Service here is off and on but food is always consistently good!"}
{"text":"Sushi is just okay.  decant price but I rather spend a few dollars more and get something that is worth the time."}
{"text":"go to the reverse happy hour where reasonably edible sushi is served at reasonable prices amidst, in the instance of our  visit, barely legal drinking aged crowd. in a mall. nuff said."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, all day happy hour on Sundays (bar/patio/lounge only) which are 1st come 1st serve on seating so not ideal for big groups because it fills up fast! However the restaurant area is perfect for groups just minus the Sunday happy hour."}
{"text":"Recently remodeled and looks great. Really good food and happy hour. Our waitress wasn't the friendliest but otherwise it was an enjoyable meal."}
{"text":"Great if you are into drunk MILFs! Hang on to that elusive beauty as long as you can darling, nothing is sexier than a hot GILF.   However you could get pizza next door and milf watch from a distance, it increases the odds which makes for better betting.    The food at Kona is horrible, they are the Denny's of Asian Fusion. Their only innovation is the skinny menu, which is a way to rip off youth seekers by making them pay out the ass for tuna in balsamic.  Its a great model age before liquor makes bang bang for management."}
{"text":"Quick spot for a mall-made mayo-based California roll. This is where you go to learn how sushi can go wrong.  You've been hard at work doing swipe-and-sign. Perhaps you even dropped a thousand bucks at Neiman's on a worthless Jhane Barnes' sweater and some silk-lined Zanella slacks or three thousand on a whats-left-of-last-season's-collection of Brioni blazer. Whatever your fancy, you're toting a wrist full of roped, glossy, shooshing-sounding bags with tissue paper sticking out the tops. You just want a break and some cool refreshing sushi.  It's OK, but beware. Unagi and other \"hot\" items have a \"beep-beep beep-beep\" before they get to you. California and spicy tuna rolls come real quick -- 'cause they come from a vat of mayonnaise. Rice is not right either. Stick to tuna and salmon sashimi and miso soup.  If head chef Rick is there (think Kyoto of Empire at 24th and Camelback, then Ichi Ban, University off McClintock), ask him to make you a Fat Bob on Acid, for good ol' times' sake. Or just go to Starbucks, tide yourself over, and find a real sushi restaurant.  And about the Brioni... Don't sweat the buyer's remorse. It'll make a great tax deduction to Florence's."}
{"text":"I don't consider myself a connoisseur of food but I do know that I've never complained about any sushi in my life. We strayed from our usual sushi joints and tried out Kona Grill. What a mistake! We ordered the Volcano roll and the Vegas roll and ate only one bit from each before we asked for the check. The food was bland, cold, and had the consitency of mayo mixed with immitation crab. Both dishes tasted almost identical. To top off the horrid flavor, only 5 of each thinly sliced roll was brought out for about 12 bucks a roll.  With the plates full on the table, the server didn't even inquire about why we didn't want the food boxed or ask us how the food was. I paid the bill, left 0 tip and will be informing everyone I know to stay far away from Kona Grill and their overpriced mush. We went to the Yard House after we left and had a great meal."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad time at Kona Grill. The sushi is good as well as the salad. The avocado eggrolls aren't as good as Cheesecake Factory though.   The staff is always attentive and super nice."}
{"text":"Will never be back! Service was horrible and manager was awful. They turned the lights on before we got or food, guess they wanted us to leave."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch a few days ago and was looking forward to some sushi. Ordered some potstickers and the Vegas roll and enjoyed both of them. Our server wasn't very friendly and I felt like we annoyed him when we told him we weren't ready to order. At the end when he dropped the checks he tossed them on the table. I'll probably go to the Desert Ridge location next time I want to go to a Kona Grill, or I'll go to RA Sushi in Old Town."}
{"text":"Amazing food, great and attentive service. Steak was cooked to perfection and was one of the best fillet mignon I had for a while."}
{"text":"Nice place, the sushi was great, I was hesitant getting sushi in Arizona but it turned out to be great. Chicken and shrimp lettuce wraps were a great starter, the Albacore sashimi and some rolls, shimp&lobster roll and Philly roll. Both very good. Service was great and then for finally, Red Velvet cupcake. Delicious."}
{"text":"I did not expect to enjoy a meal inside a mall.  I stopped here to fuel with fish and sake as shopping is such very hard work (sarcasm!). I sat at the bar and the sushi chefs' company absolutely made the experience.  I have certainly had better sushi, but the experience as a whole was great and I recommend stopping here if you happen to be shopping at the Fashion Square and need to recharge."}
{"text":"During our Vegas strip, we stopped by Kona Grill for lunch. We brought a discount coupon at Tix4Tonight ($3 per person for 30% off all food).   Food: 3/5, it was average. We got a baked salmon roll, chicken caprese sandwich and turkey burger. A bit on the pricer side (each entree was $14) but normal for Vegas strip restaurant prices.   Ambience: 5/5, it's a beautiful, modern restaurant. It has a sexy, romantic vibe. Love the large tropical aquarium in the front. It's a large restaurant with indoor and outdoor seating; good for a date or group get together.   Service: 4/5, it took a while for a server to come but once we ordered, the food came out pretty quickly and we paid the check without any issues."}
{"text":"Came here for happy hour with a group of ladies. The front patio and bar area were totally packed! We sat at the bar and then grabbed the first open pub style seating. We got lucky.   Drink orders were very very slow to get started as there were a ton of people here around 6 pm. I think we waited about 15 minutes for our initial drinks. However, after that, our waitress, Nicole, was on point and making moves! The rest of our food and drink orders were very prompt.  Happy hour appetizers were wonderful! I got the lettuce wraps, which were sooo delicious. We had a great time sharing dishes and enjoying our white sangrias!  The atmosphere was great for after work. I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"This place always looks \"poppin\" (does anyone still say that??) and because of that I've been wanting to try it for a long time!  Enjoyed the lettuce wrap appetizer. Sushi is decent for a fusion spot. Prices are similar to most casual dining places. The other entrees, like the salmon, are mediocre and definitely over priced for the taste.   I'd come here to hang out for happy hour with a group of friends. Their patio is nice.   Bummer that I checked in on Yelp for the free appetizer ($14 value) but even after our server talked to us about it, he forgot to take it off our bill. Don't forget to check before you pay!"}
{"text":"Great new location at Fashion Show Mall. Ordered 4 rolls and appetizer for 2 of us. Spicy Tempura Shrimp was excellent; just enough spice, not overwhelming.  3 rolls (Wave, Crab Crunch, and Tempura Shrimp) were excellent and fresh. One roll (Fiery Shrimp) was not as good; rice was firm. Tasted like it was pre-prepped like convenience store sushi."}
{"text":"been to this Kona Grill many times before but this last time was interesting, ordered some drinks and calamari (calamari is always a winner at Kona). During my entree order i decide to order the lobster mac n cheese but then our waiter stopped me and said he wanted me to enjoy my meal and gave his opinion based on other customers comments on this dish, he persuaded me to change my mind to the macadamia chicken and it was delicious. The Mrs. had the stir fry and she enjoyed the flavor of her dish. all in all the night was wonderful...and thanks to yelp for the free appetizer for checking in for dinner."}
{"text":"I've been to their happy hour so many times I can't even count. It is awesome! & their sushi is SO good. Sitting outside in nice weather is the best, but sitting inside is cool, too. Definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"Lucky enough I arrived during happy hour and was able to get 3 menus items for 20$; fiery shrimp roll, crunch crab roll, (both 5.50$) & sliders not a huge fan of sushi & these didn't impress; they're okay but not return worthy on the other hand though the sliders (8$) were great too receive 2 w/ fries fresh & tasty a burger is always a go to when all else fails"}
{"text":"Kona Grill offers up some decent sushi and an awesome happy hour that goes pretty late.  There's a good selection of cheap rolls, apps, and flat breads.  The only problem is that the service suddenly slows down near the end.  Somewhere around 6:30 (a half-hour before happy hour ends) the food takes longer and longer to come out and the servers are harder and harder to track down."}
{"text":"Love the updates they've done on the place.   Great place for lunch or dinner.  Their desserts are amazing and I love all of their additions to the menu."}
{"text":"Best happy hour! Ahi wonton crisps are so good. The waiter even took the time to make me an iced coffee even though hot coffee is on their menu."}
{"text":"Our second experience here was definitely a lot better than our first time. We came during dinner rush on a event night and were seated promptly. Our waiter was nice and courteous and the food was good. I had red sangria that was well made and my boyfriend had some alcoholic beverages with pineapple  which he liked. Overall our experience was nice."}
{"text":"Great restaurant. Good atmosphere and music and very good sushi and flat bread. Service was friendly and attentive. Happy hour starts @ 9:00 and sushi and stuff was half off. That's good living..."}
{"text":"I don't normally write reviews (good or bad), but this was my first experience at this particular Kona Grill.  I met with a few friends on Friday night for dinner and drinks.  The food was fine and pretty much what you would expect for a chain restaurant.  But given that the place was not overly packed, our drink orders were extraordinarily slow, and we only ordered Saki, a beer and a shot for each of us (3 people).  It took over 20 minutes to get the three orders of Saki and beer.  To top it off, though we ordered some shots after dinner, and the check was brought over and paid for before the shots even arrived, and when we flagged down the waitress she seemed surprised that we would ask about where our drinks were, like 15-20 minutes is the normal waiting time for a drink.  Overall we sat in the restaurant for two and half hours for appetizers, dinner and a few drinks.  I've eaten 6 course meals from James Beard award winning chef's in less time.      I'm sure this place was just having an off night, but i'll never go back."}
{"text":"Best happy hour in town. Great ambiance food and wine. The yellowtail sashimi is amazing we also had chicken and shrimp lettuce wraps and pot stickers. They have a great wine selection as well and bartenders were very friendly .. so we're the regulars that are there all he time :)"}
{"text":"Top notch customer service and thanks to the yelp app my friend is enjoying a sushi roll. Check it out when in the area. Worth it!"}
{"text":"Once upon a time there was a Princess who moved to Las Vegas (although she still had a part-time kingdom gig in New Jersey, the Garden State).  Along with all the blinding neon lights, she was blown away by a concept unheard of back East - the Reverse Happy Hour.  Soon she was happily scarfing down Ladies' Margaritas, pizza with goat cheese, and tacos unlike anything served in Mexican restaurants - big enough for a meal, accompanied by fried rice with fresh pineapple and shrimp, and for only 4.50 (okay, maybe 5 bucks tops) - at her favorite Happy Hour watering hole, Kona Grill.  Or was it the fabulous southwestern slaw?  The Princess was there so often, and had so many delectable and cheap dishes - and Ladies' Margaritas - that it's hard to remember what came with what.  But that was in the olden days, circa 2007. And a lot of that is gone.  First to go was the goat cheese on the pizza.  Then the garlic shrimp pizza.  The fried rice.  The slaw.  The onion rings to die for.  Gone, all gone.  The Happy Hour remains, though a ghost of its former self.  The margarita is the same, and only 50 cents more.  The 10\" pizza is still good, costs six bucks, but now only as a Pizza Margherita - with tomatoes, cheese and basil, BBQ chicken, or Pepperoni.  Not a bad deal, but not the pizza of blessed memory.  Tonight we managed to eat early enough to get to the first happy hour, before 7 pm.  Most of the patio heaters were working, and I had my Princess Cushion with me, to protect my Royal Behind from the hard, cold metal seat, so we were pretty comfortable.  My husband had a Blue Moon ($4, which I don't think is a great happy hour price any more).  I had the margarita, of course.  We shared the tomato pizza, which had a good amount of cherry tomato halves and shredded fresh basil, and also an order of Romaine Wraps, with chicken and shrimp in a mildly spiced sauce.  That was really tasty.  If I didn't yearn for the Kona Happy Hour of yore, I might have given this a higher rating.  What you get is still very good, and so is the service, which includes a last call for Happy Hour.  But it's hard to forget the glory that was Kona.  Maybe when the economy comes back, the goat cheese will, too.  I can only hope.  And then I will live Happily Ever After.  The End"}
{"text":"Kona grill is always a great option! The variety of choices makes it good for every person in your party. Awesome patio seating and the service is great!"}
{"text":"Such a great lunch!! Our server was AWESOME & our lunch was outstanding! The lollipop roll is by far one of my favorite rolls to date!"}
{"text":"Alison B. and I met here for reverse happy hour last week.  Before we decided to move to the patio (it was too noisy earlier), she ordered a peach martini made w/ sake, and I a glass of Red Diamond Merlot.  Alison was feeling like having the Kona calamari (HH price $5).  It's been years since I had KG's and I couldn't recall if I liked it, but I mentioned that if we moved to the bar or patio, that happy hour would start in fifteen minutes and we could order that and something else at happy hour prices!  It took a little arm-twisting, but Alison relented ;)    Why did I stay away for so long?!  Oh yeah, I remember now... Mom and I used to frequent Chandler's KG our first two years in the valley, but it just got harder and harder to find an empty table at the bar/patio, plus it was always so noisy!  I really like Scottsdale's location- not too noisy outside, especially if you're lucky enough to snap up a table at a corner or at the outer edges.  Besides the calamari, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kona-grill-scottsdale?select=v5-BEzsK6s-j2vilNDG3sA#v5-BEzsK6s-j2vilNDG3sA  we also tried the Five-spice Barbecue Chicken pizza ($5), http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kona-grill-scottsdale?select=yNfFV0_BeMetIbVMcDIWng#yNfFV0_BeMetIbVMcDIWng  and she ordered a Bud-light ($2) and I a glass of House red merlot ($4).  Food and libations were delish!"}
{"text":"I've been all over America eating sushi wherever I go and this by far is the worst. Sushi wasn't wrapped tight, crab seemed old, rice had a funny texture and taste and the sauce on it tasted like mayo and ketchup. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Looking for a spot for lite lunch at the Fashion Mall on the Strip. Stopped in the Kona Grill after a couple of hours of shopping. Seated al fresco pleasant seating complimented by the perfect weather. Yasmin, our waitress was friendly, professional and attentive. Ordered the original poke salad, spider roll, coconut shrimp roll and the Asian Salad. Fresh, tasty and perfect proportions. Definitely the place to go if you're in the area of the Fashion Mall and the Las Vegas Strip."}
{"text":"This was my first visit ever to Kona Grill and I was pleasantly surprised! The atmosphere is laid back. The server is not rushing you. They even remind you that the happy hour will be over soon. The food was great. We had sushi and fried calamari. The calamari were amazing. Bravo to both chef and servers!"}
{"text":"I really like Kona's menu and the location, which alone could earn a 4 star yelp review from me.  I give Kona 3 stars because of the seating restrictions and service during Happy Hour, which is usually when I end up here.  The Happy Hour menu has a limited but decent selection of food and drinks.  While Kona has a nice patio setup, you have to fight for tables out there or in the bar area since the HH specials do not carry over into the dining room area (which is totally empty during HH).  Don't be surprised when your bill comes out at the end of your meal to find a group of hunger people hovering next to your table waiting to grab your seat as soon as you stand up.  Also, the service during HH is hit or miss.  You either get a really great and attentive server, or you end up with several people randomly checking in on you once they realize that all the drinks at your table have been empty for 10 minutes."}
{"text":"Food is good.  Big kahuna burger with bacon is great!   Service was awesome!  Nicole M was amazingly sweet and extremely prompt.  So fast!  Great experience for us in town for a sales event."}
{"text":"I had the pot stickers, delicious,  the flank steak, spider roll,sea bass  entree. All of it was fabulous. We finished with the brownie.   It will become one of our must visits to go to when we're in Vegas.  We're close to irvine. We will definitely check out that location."}
{"text":"I don't know why I keep coming back to this place, the service is terrible! My friends love the happy hour prices and the convenient hang out location, so I come in tow. We walked in for happy hour at 10 til 10, they are open til 11pm and after being seated we were notified that they were closing early so we had 7 minutes to place our order! Nothing on the website, no sign posted... just we are closing early tonight sorry and hurry up and get your order in. We were very rushed for mediocre food and terribly unprofessional service."}
{"text":"We stopped in for a late lunch and sat on the open patio because the weather was perfect. There was only one other couple at the time on the patio and the waitress immediately mentioned to us that we were to early for happy hour (starts at 3:00PM) We ordered the ahi tuna crisp as an appetizer....... it was very good!!! I ordered the chopped Kona salad with pecan crusted chicken. It was good.... the chicken was very well cooked, flavorful and not dry. The salad was not a chopped salad by my definition...... it was not chopped any more than a regular garden type salad.... very disappointing.... I was really set on the finely chopped salad, not enough dressing for my taste either. My husband had the fish of the day, which was red snapper. He said it was okay.... nothing to get excited about.... a little dry, and served with plain white rice.... very bland. By the time we wrapped up our meal, it was almost 3:00 and time for Happy Hour.... the patio was full,  and from what I could tell, that is what this place is best at. Stick to the happy hour appetizers and drinks. It is more their specialty."}
{"text":"Kona Grill is meh.. it has a big menu selection, but its overpriced and medicore. If you're stuck by the mall (like we were) its not terrible, but if you're mobile, I recommend somewhere else."}
{"text":"I love that Kona is now up in Desert Ridge, the macadamia chicken is one of the best dinners ever.  I also like their sushi and love their happy hour.  It is a great location with a great patio, I just wish they were open later.  The atmosphere is upscale and is a great date night place, we often go here in a large group before heading out to drink more at Blue Martini or Sand Bar.  Overall good place for any occation."}
{"text":"Great time for dinner with friends. 4 of the 6 of us ate sushi. Everything tasted fresh and it was presented well. The server didn't hear my wife order her entree and thought she just wanted a dinner salad. But he made it right. We'll be back."}
{"text":"After concert dinner, last weekend. Our waiter was great. We came in an hour before closing and the place still had quite a few patrons. Our food was fresh, delicious and filling. Perfect for a late night dinner. We have a new spot for date nights."}
{"text":"Wine Down Wednesdays! Love this place, great wine, great potstickers and the Chinese salad with Mac chicken in it is the bomb! Ask for Lisa, best server/bartender hands down! This is my go to spot, very convenient location!   Only recommendation, add Buffalo Wings to the Menu, i would be here every night. Lemon Pepper My Wings!"}
{"text":"We had amazing food and service today from Alessandra. We were waiting for our flight and ended up here for several hours. Alessandra took great care of us and the food was delicious!"}
{"text":"The happy hour on the weekend is a smoking deal.   Two or three people can get drinks and sushi for around $25.   Staff is always rocking and fast.  Great ambience and people watching too."}
{"text":"Our party of 6 decided to stop into Kona Grill for dinner on the recommendation of our Lyft driver, as our car was parked in the area. We arrived around 5:45pm on a Sunday night and the restaurant was quite empty. The restaurant is large and beautiful, with tasteful lighting and decorations and very spacious dining areas. There is also an outdoor patio and a sushi bar seating area.  Service was great. We were seated promptly and our waiter was very attentive throughout the entire meal. We were excited about the happy hour specials, as the listed sushi rolls and appetizers were about 40% off (traditional rolls were $4.50 and special rolls were $10 with happy hour prices), but unfortunately we found out that the happy hour was not available on weekends (apparently it is between 3-6pm on weekdays only). Without the happy hour, I thought the prices were quite high for the sushi ($8-9 for a traditional roll and ~$15 for a special roll). They also have an entree menu with entrees listed for around $15 to $25.   I tried the following: Beef brisket burger (seasonal special, $15) with bacon, onion, lettuce, tomato, and fries: quite good, but not particularly special compared to other burgers that I've tried. The brisket flavor was not very prominent, although the burger was cooked well and the fries were crispy and well-fried.  Alaskan roll (baked salmon, spicy aioli, cucumber, tempura flakes, eel sauce, $8): a pretty average roll. I probably should have calibrated my expectations since Las Vegas is landlocked and the fish has to be flown in, so it isn't as fresh as the sushi I'm used to in Boston. Overall it was okay but not amazing. The tempura flakes added a nice texture and crunch to each bite.   Overall food was 3/5. Sushi dishes were average but my friend at our table got the basil pesto linguine ($19) and said it was the best pasta dish he had ever had, so maybe the non-seafood entrees are better."}
{"text":"Experience:  Came with a friend who loves this place, but I had already bookmarked here in YELP. So glad she wanted to come. It was a Thursday @6pm.   Facility:  This is a nice spot. It's super modern and trendy. There is some beautiful decor. They have tables and chairs, bar seating, outside seating, and booths. Love the wine tunnel and the blue lights. You could dress up nice on date night or come casual in blue jeans.   Service: 5 star service!!  My waitress was Kiyanna, and she was awesome!  She was friendly, knowledgable, honest and just plain nice. She was very attentive asking back at just the right times during our meal. I will be asking for her specifically the next time I come in.   Food: We took advantage of the happy hour choices, and didn't regret it.  For a very reasonable price, you get actual plates of food...not the little 2 bite tapas at most places. We ordered the following... Avocado eggrolls - these were pretty tasty, but the cilantro sauce for dipping was too sweet for me.  Chicken Satay 2.5/5 - chicken was good, but not a fan of the sweet hoisin sauce.  The peanut sauce was just ok. But I'm. It a good judge because I don't care for peanut sauce.  Bulgogi Tacos 3/5 - loved the crispy chewy taco shell. Unfortunately, they put the sweet hoisin sauce on the tacos, so I couldn't finish them. Just way too sweet. However, my friend liked them so much, she ordered some Togo.  Cheeseburger sliders 4/5 - these were good, and pretty big for sliders. The fries were hot and good!  Overall: I like this place. Although the sweet side of the menu is not my fav, the savory dishes make up for it. And the service from people like Kiyanna take it over the top!!!!!"}
{"text":"I am not in love with the service but the food quality and drink quality is definitely nice quality and fair portions. Especially during reverse happy hour in the value is much appreciated. I will be back for reverse happy hour again soon!"}
{"text":"First time coming here after they remodeled. I like how the patio has more space it makes it feel a lot more roomy. The food is still fresh  nothing has changed. Definitely coming back here for happy hour with my coworkers!"}
{"text":"When I got here it was empty.  REALLY empty (I contributed the photo of the interior...look at how empty it was).  I'm guessing it's because it was pretty late at night (the mall had already closed) on a weekday.    We got the potstickers as an appetizer.  It was good, but it was no different from the frozen stuff you'd get at the store.  I got the sea bass as an entree and it was GREAT!  The fish was tender and flavorful.  I'm giving this place 5 stars because this is easily the best meal I had during my short stay in Arizona.  (In case you're wondering what the worst was, it was a chicken burrito at the airport.  Tasted like wet Kleenex in a tortilla)"}
{"text":"I had gone here last Friday to enjoy a nice dinner with friends; Unfortunately the Bar was backlogged Because they had a trainee off on his own., took forever to get a drink..  poor management!!! Instead of manager Erica jumping behind bar and assisting, she was shooting off her unprofessional  Mouth!!!  Short bus boys and food runners, this place lacks good management.. too bad cause I love the food."}
{"text":"The manager is rude and defensive. Guests on the patio wanted the shades open at night for the weather and lighting. She literally walked out and argued with us as well as other people who wanted to down. She had zero interest in accommodating the customer and a bad attitude. Done with this location and only going to chandler mall now. Our waitress is great though I have no complaints about the food or drinks."}
{"text":"Poke!! The food was great! Seaweed salad was fantastic, and our server Louis was awesome!"}
{"text":"Don't eat here. I had severe food poisoning all day from the sushi. It might just be the happy hour one but trust me, you don't want to undergo the excruciating pain from $6 sushi"}
{"text":"Went here for happy hour with John L. in from SF. We managed to grab the last table for 2 stuffed into a corner. At least we could watch some of the NBA Finals they had on the TVs in the bar area. I'd have to say my experience is much like everyone else's, the food was good and inexpensive considering how much we ordered, but the service was slow. We ended up order 4 or 5 items from the happy hour menu, sushi rolls, sliders, pot stickers and one other thing that slips my mind. We managed to enjoy the food and the beer and overall, I'd be back again, if nothing else just to hang out after work and have a couple drinks."}
{"text":"I normally hate restaurant chains but their sweet salmon soy salad would be my last meal. Everyone I introduce to this says it's the best salad they've ever had and I once emailed and asked how I could get their dressing for a dinner party, they sent me a gallon for free, paid shipping, nice cooler, only asked that I continued to let people know what an amazing menu this chain has. It's Hawaiian fusion (in case you didn't get that from the name) and it pops up in family towns so the fusion is with American."}
{"text":"The best happy hour in Vegas, at least in my opinion. I went with my boyfriend for Sunday all day HH and enjoyed every bit. We ordered the pot stickers, spicy tuna roll, crab crunch roll and tuna wonton crisps. Amazing and filled us both up for under $30. The only downside is the service being a little slow, but overall it's still one of my favorite places."}
{"text":"My friends and I decided to meet up here for happy hour since the Summerlin one was temporarily closed for remodeling. I like the design and set up of this location, super \"Las Vegas Stripped\" out. The only sucky part is walking through basically the entire mall to get to it.  Food wise, it's cheap and good! We had about 5 rolls and two other apps as well as four sakes and the total came to around $60. Can't beat that! My favorite here is always the tuna wonton crisps and the Atlantic roll was good too.  The only reasons for not giving a five star review is how limited the table space is and the service was so so. We had to track down a waitress to get another roll ordered before happy ended at 7."}
{"text":"loved the fried avocado i was upset that the waitress basically forced me to sit at the bar that was dirty with no view when the restaurant was empty 1 hour till closing aka i shoulda been sat at a table"}
{"text":"I'd like to go on record as saying I like Kona, but I don't get the massive appeal it seems to have with some friends of mine. Do you guys really like ok food for more premium prices? Do you like ok service, too? Because that's what I feel I got here.   I ordered sushi and water on my last trip here. It was good, sure, but not GREAT. It wasn't the kind of meal I was expecting when friends suggested this place had some of the best sushi in town, and definitely not competitive with Ichiza or Yama or Kaya. Not even close. My date ordered a salad, and she seemed pretty happy with it. From where I was sitting, it looked like the salads that they serve at Wendy's, except this time I'm paying more than $5 for it. Grumble grumble...  All in all, I'm sure I'll come here. This is one of those places where the cool kids hang out, and I like the atmosphere here. Except maybe next time I come, I'll grab a bite before hand and just enjoy a beer here."}
{"text":"Good happy hour with food and drink specials. I like to eat at the bar but they have plenty of tables and can accommodate a large group. When it is not hot the bar opens to a patio area. I believe it is dog friendly but check as I have found this can change from time to time."}
{"text":"The absolute worse did not even make it to the meal. First my mom was visiting town and wanted to take me for a birthday dinner, I suggested Kona knowing they had sushi for me and other stuff for mom. It starts out with a dirty glass when I order a beer had a piece of dirt or makeup in it, not to big a deal just got a new beer. Then we order and they bring the order out wrong, I order a crab crunch role and get a special crab role, strike 2 but not a huge deal. I send it back to fix and then they just throw crumble and sauce all over the roll and try to pull it off as a crab crunch role when I know all to well that's not how it's made, Strike 3 your fucking out. The manager then proceeds to come over and lie to me that this is what I ordered when I know damn well that's not how it's made because I have had it many times before, at that point I did not trust nor want to dine at there piece of shit establishment get your shit together Kona I will never ever eat there again and strongly suggest you follow suit."}
{"text":"Whenever I'm shopping in Scottsdale Fashion Square I prefer to eat at Kona Grill. The food is Great and the HH is quite popular. Remember it is available only in the patio area, Bar and Lounge where it gets super crowded, noisy and the service is a hit or miss.  If you sit in the restaurant the average cost of an entree is about $18 but it will be quieter and the service is much better.  We got the Shrimp tempura tossed in a spicy citrus aioli $12 Macadamia nut chicken $19.75 (mashed potatoes, seasonal vegetables, cream, pineapple-papaya marmalade) Pad Thai noodles $17 (chicken, rice noodles, bean sprouts and crushed peanuts, in spicy black bean chilli sauce.you can substitute shrimp or get both)  Everything was perfect. The Macadamia nut chicken is one of my favourites the marmalade is exquisite. If you are a fan of sushi, sashimi or good food give this place a try.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"A great place to go for. Nice ambience and perfect sushi bar :)"}
{"text":"This place is suffering an identity crisis, but the food isn't that bad. I had the Cuban which came out not as hot as I would have liked, and got cold quickly. My stomach was too famished and my company too engaging and entertaining to care. Them sweet potato fries were the bomb, however! I tried other friends' plates (poke bowl and avocado eggroll) and they weren't bad either.   The food's only reasonably priced during happy hour.   Atmosphere is great! Nice colors, lighting, mood--awesome for a group date with friends."}
{"text":"Pistilli was my server tonight, and overall the night was good. Her attitude and the fact that she was completely rude to me and my friends made the night almost ruined but the food made up for it."}
{"text":"The ambience here is good but on the weekends only.  I like the outdoor seating area. The food and menu are just okay.  The sushi isn't anything to complain about but I won't get it again.  The only real knock here is the poor selection of Craft Brews.  For me it's a place I would go once a year."}
{"text":"This restaurant  has a generous Happy Hour menu. The sushi rolls are delicious. We will return."}
{"text":"Service is excellent. Food is excellent. Since you're asking for a 50 pg review  Let me say that I've been here a couple of times. It's pricey, the rolls are small but that's what you expect in this area. One order will not suffice, even for a small woman. Imagine a regular roll cut in 4. That's how small they are for about 12 bucks for 7 to 10 rolls. They are staffed quite a bit for the actual foot traffic.  Decor is nice, staff is nice, food is ok.  Would I return? Probably not. I've had some amazing sushi lately and not that expensive..its on my other reviews."}
{"text":"Many good things, some things meh. Went for a birthday dinner and was mostly very happy.  The straight up martini (Effen Cucumber) was very good, but had a lot of crushed ice floating; though it was tasty, I wished that the drink was colder, without being diluted. I didn't send it back, and it certainly was fine, but not exactly straight up.  The chicken satay is excellent. I stopped ordering chicken satay anywhere as it seemed to slump into a predictable, formulated chicken brick. The chicken used here for the satay was tasty, real, moist and looked like chicken, too. The peanut sauce and the hoisin sauce are great, and the bed of Russian-dressed slaw is refreshing (and a bit spicy).  The yellowtail sashimi we ordered was fresh, crisp and what I'd hoped for.   The Lobster Mac and Cheese delivers, if that's your thing. The Macadamia Nut Chicken is another winner - though you need to be OK with deep-fried.   Despite rumored good burgers here, the burger served to our party was meh. Overcooked (to my eyes), but that didn't stop our guy from diving into it. Yet, at the halfway point, he bailed. The pay-off, though, was he didn't want to bring the rest home.  The grilled halibut special is not very special. Sounds really good, but it was way overcooked and just not happening. Much better is the Sea Bass. Flavorful, moist, lovely. In fairness, our server had definitely steered us toward the Sea Bass while we were ordering. Wanting to mix it up, we ordered one of each. But, happily, our server swapped out the halibut for another Sea Bass.  You may want to ask for a taste of the wines, first. Someone ordered a pretty standard white that turned out not so great. Switched that for the good stuff, and all was right again.  Desserts -- well, the Brownie is outstanding. Served with vanilla ice cream, plus 'vanilla cream sauce' aka whip cream (we opted for no whip), and served over a swath of caramel, it's worth it. Also, we loved the Butter Cake. Served with vanilla ice cream and raspberry sauce.  Service was generally very good. Occasionally we had to look around for some help, but I think our guy was great. The place was pretty empty on a Monday night. We called for a ressie for 6:30pm, and were told they couldn't accommodate us at 6:30pm, but at 6:15pm. Once we got to Kona, we really didn't understand why it mattered given the seemingly sparse crowd.  Check-in with Yelp got us a nice treat, too."}
{"text":"(only 3 stars cause' I only been here once)  I went here quite awhile ago with some coworkers. The coworkers were two very pretty young ladies, and the waiter was your definition of a 'ladies man', but surprisingly, I still received just as good of service as the gals.   I'll make the disclaimer that I don't frequent really nice restaurants like this. You'll find me in a Chinese food buffet more than a place like this. So maybe that's why I enjoyed the ambiance of this place so much. It is quite stylish inside to say the least. Low lights, modern designs, sleek furnishings... This is a bonafide date place. It screams \"Your girl will likey likey\".   Its got that 'in scene' type of feel that I've always dreamed of being a part of, but I'm just too lame to fit into:)  Anyway, none of that means anything if the food isn't good. Can't remember what everyone ordered, but I got a burger...dummy! Why would you order such a pedestrian meal at this kind of place?! To make it worse, the burger was very unspectacular. And in my simpleton way of thinking, if you can't get a simple burger right, I have no business trying any of your more ambitious offerings.   However, that concept was thrown out the window when one of my coworkers let me taste her sushi stuff. It was AWESOME!!! The taste and freshness were fighting over which would win me over. They both won, cause the taste of whatever that roll was called was something new and exciting for my taste buds, while the freshness of the ingredients was something that just made me smile. I ended up finishing her meal off for her, and vowed that I would be back to order it myself.   My other coworker had some type of salad, which was looking rather appetizing. All in all, I think you just have to order the right things...which I guess is the case at any restaurant.   As for the service, it was good. The guy managed to flirt his face off with the girls, and provide attentive and prompt service at the same time. Maybe they actually have training for that when you first start here...seems like the place was full of gorgeous girls, so I guess male waiters need to know how to handle themselves.   The price? Well, this is a really nice place, so expect to pay a little more. Still, I don't remember being to p'ed off with my bill for the burger and a drink. Decent Chandler type prices, I guess.   So yeah, if you got a girl, take her here and be wary of the trained male waiters. Order some of the nicer things on the menu, not a stupid burger. And for us guys who like to wear jeans and a t-shirt, you can do so here...just make sure its a decent t-shirt, one without the set in stains. And bring at least 20 bucks...trust me."}
{"text":"Sad to say I wasnt impressed at all. Really bummed out because we would come here every Sunday just about since they closed for remodeling and we would partake in the great happy hour deals. Sure the new decor is beautiful and contemporary and the choice of music is in good taste. I was so excited to go here since its remodeled new opening and so we went on a Sunday. I knew it was gunna be packed seeing as how its happy hour I made a reservation for 130 pm.   Upon my arrival the 3 girls in the front looked at me like I had 10 heads when I said I had a reservation. There was almost no where to sit literally the place was nearly at full capacity. Finally found a table, and sat down. It took literally 15 minutes to even have the server come over and get us our water. I remained patient as they were slammed and this was the first Sunday since their reopening. It took another half hour to get 4 avocado rolls at which time I finally got the iced tea I initially ordered with my water. Our server said \"the tea is in the back\"  The entire time the server was cold, quite standoff-ish, just not friendly. Hardly seen the server the entire dining experience. Seemed like she had an attitude. No apologies for anything coming out late or her being gone half the time. Ok I get it your busy but come on at least acknowledge your patrons. The food finally came out. The kids meal grilled cheese waa a joke. Fries were overcooked and hard and the sandwich, well lets just say I wish I woulda got a pic of that. I was too busy taking a pic of something else ...   My lunch sandwich was fine until I nearly choked and cracked my tooth on a bone from the chicken. Talk about feeling absolutely disgusted. When I tell the server about what happens she has the nerve to ask me \"is that a bone??\" I had to bite my tongue with the response I had. Thankfully the manager rushed over and apologized and took it off the bill.  As a kona grill veteran I still dont like how u have to be outside or the bar to get happy hour deals. As full as the place was, everyone should be accommodated with that happy hour deal.   Even after all this, I would probably give kona grill at least another shot. Just wont be for quite a while. *sigh."}
{"text":"I've dined at this restaurant countless times over the years, however, this last visit was rather sub-par. We had 45 minutes to be in and out for happy hour before my daughter and I went to go see a movie next door. I informed the server of this before hand he said it would not be a problem. I wouldn't foresee it being a problem as we arrived at 3 o'clock when happy our first started and it was a Monday, and there was hardly anybody in there. Regardless it took 55 minutes to be in and out of the restaurant for happy hour which rather irritated me being late for the movie. I also feel the quality of their food is going down a bit. I've noticed this from the last couple of visits. Especially the fish tacos which were not up to par."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. Service is always great, food is always amazing.  Wine Wednesdays are great!"}
{"text":"I miss my place of good sushi and my favorite avocado rolls, as well as great happy hour fun. Lots of sexy people to look at too!!"}
{"text":"Food is always good. Went on a Friday night for the reverse happy hour, and was disappointed to find out they no longer do this on Fridays. Everything else considered, a good time!"}
{"text":"Having frequented the Boca Park location in the past stopped by here to check it out. We ordered pad thai noodles with chicken and cuban sandwich that comes with sweet potato fries. The noodles were mediocre with scarce chicken bits. I was getting sporadic whiffs of fish sauce here and there that made me whirl noodles around the plate for even sauce distribution. On a plus side, it was a good size portion fit for after-shopping exhaustion but for the taste ... I was just grateful for the sweet potato fries! :D The sandwich was meaty and reminiscent of the cuban it got it's name from and good over all."}
{"text":"I love this place , I recommend to come during happy hour and get the sangria with champagne . I had the Vegas roll and Atlantic Roll . OMG so delicious"}
{"text":"Amazing! My boyfriend and I are here for lunch and we thought it was absolutely delicious! For sushi we ordered the California Roll, Spicy Tuna Roll, & the Shrimp Tempura Roll and we shared the Pan-Seared Tuna for our entree. Every dish was just perfect!"}
{"text":"The fondue is to die for!! Just wish they could give you more options other then the apples. I love everything on the menu, seriously everything. But i usually get the avavado club, garlic shrimp pasta or margarita pizza. service has always been great too. Thank you!!"}
{"text":"so the atmosphere is really cool, buuuuuut our server Victoria was VERY rude to us. claimed we order things that no one from our table ordered. then came to our table \"giving us advice\" on how to order. uh talk about rude. Once we got our checks they didn't have happy hour prices and then when we asked about it seemed VERY annoyed. made us really uncomfortable. bottom of the line don't ask for victoria i mean unless you like someone with an attitude."}
{"text":"Located inside the Fashion Show Mall, right beside Benihana. Kona Grill has many screens to watch the games and have some grub. Didn't wait much to sit down, was seated immediately. It was not too busy when I visited this restaurant. Their menu consists of a variety of food including sushi, pizza, and Mac and cheese... and burgers! There are a lot of rolls and nigiri sushi selections as well.  The restaurant itself is pretty spacious. Plenty of indoor seating and an outdoor patio, with a bar right in the middle. Bathrooms are also pretty clean.   Food was served quickly, and the servers were polite. Drinks were refilled at good times.  I wish they had a better happy hour special. I'm not even sure if they have one!"}
{"text":"Happy hour review:  Great service, waitress was on the ball with everything. $3.50 spicy tuna roll, $6 for alaska roll and another special roll. We also got the chicken lettuce wraps that were on the happy hour menu. $4 beer and margarita. Overall the food was good for hh price (I wouldn't pay full price for it though) and the drinks are okay."}
{"text":"Kona Grill, to me, is a safe spot. It's one of the places I can dine and know that whatever I order will not disappoint me. Happy hours are definitely happy, the drinks are delicious, and it's a good spot to catch up with a group of friends. It's worth a try!"}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE! Great sushi, good area and prompt service. The only downside is that the happy hour starts at 10pm, most folks are either already home or going out for the night but not for food. The drinks are on the pricey side but the margarita on the rocks is well worth it. Try the Picasso sushi, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Don't laugh. Kona has the best flatbread pizza anywhere in The Valley. Whether you get the barbeque chicken, pepperoni or margarita, you will be in heaven."}
{"text":"Tasty sushi in a contemporary stylish atmosphere. I probably wouldn't go here if this were a stand alone restaurant, but if I'm feeling like eating at a more upscale place than the food court at Scottsdale Fashion Square, this is a good option."}
{"text":"I was recently contacted by Lloyd a District Manager for Kona Grill. I truly appreciate Lloyd's concern and prompt reply to my experience. These are the moments that truly count. It gives me peace of mind knowing that my situation wasn't viewed as insignificant. I look forward to dining at Kona Grill once again."}
{"text":"Great happy hour all afternoon on Saturdays. Decent sushi and drinks on special. Larger menu of entrees but I go for the sushi specials. Huge patio, I've even taken the kids for early dinner and they love it! The location beats other sushi restaurants for the same price."}
{"text":"Me and a few teammates came for a team lunch today. The service was very good  the waitress kept the drinks full, which is very important. Most of us ordered from the \"Perfect Pairings\" menu, which brings two items for $8.95. I chose the spinach salad and the mac and cheese. They are smaller portions, but good for lunch.  The spinach salad was very good - kiwi, strawberry, spinach, peacans and a balsamic dressing. Tasty! The mac and cheese was good, but possibly just a bit on cheese overload. Is that possible? Maybe so! I had to use a knife and fork on the top layer to separate the pasta from the cheesy goodness. A slight breaded crumbliness topping and it was delicious!"}
{"text":"Kona's food is wonderful, and I love their cosmos! The service is pretty slow, which is my only complaint. Granted, I'm usually here during the dinner rush on Fridays and Saturdays, but even during regular and reverse happy hour it seems things have been taking awhile lately. But most of the wait staff is nice, and the managers are great too.  We usually get some sushi (all of it is good) or some potstickers for an appetizer. I like the flatbread pepperoni pizza and the chinese chicken salad for dinner. They have pretty good deals on drinks and starters during happy hour (until 7). Their pomegranate cosmos are delicious! And only 5 (or 5.50 maybe) during happy hour."}
{"text":"Had lunch at Kona Grill yesterday. Had a really good time since it was happy hour. Good deals. We ordered the shrimp tempura roll, voodoo roll, and avocado egg roll. My friend loved the voodoo egg roll and will order it again the next time we go. LOVED the avocado egg rolls - good proportions and the sun-dried tomatoes added a nice touch."}
{"text":"Food was good. Server was helpful and attentive. It's overpriced for what it is. $9 for potstickers seems  a bit much."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite place to go to when I'm in Phoenix excellent service wonderful selection I can't say enough good things about this place ambience is superior"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite sushi spots that me and my boyfriend love to hit when we want to have our little date nights. The sushi is always excellent. We LOVE the potstickers, the jalapeño Sashimi, and Picasso roll. Caitlin, Sam, and Glenn always take the best care of us. They are by far, the BEST staff in that restaurant. Please ask for them when you come in! They'll take amazing care of you, without a doubt :). They are extremely knowledgeable about the menu and will accommodate your needs/wants!"}
{"text":"This place is very nice. Although it doesn't remind me of Hawaii too much, their food is incredible. I had the Sweet Chili-Glazed Salmon and it was one of the best pieces of Salmon I've ever had. Kona Grill is a bit pricey (it is on the strip, so not surprising) but I will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"I came here last year (before I knew about Yelp) with some friends of mine.  We went during reverse happy hour, where the sushi and sake bombs were HALF OFF!  It cost about $34 for 2 rounds of 4 sake bombs and 3 very large sushi plates.  I think that's pretty awesome split between 4 people!"}
{"text":"Really good meal!  My shrimp salad was great.  My son had the pad Thai, it was good.  The chicken satay was the best I've had. Wow, the new decor is beautiful.  The place is contemporary but warm.  The remodel was worth the wait.  Now the inside is spacious and well lit. Michael our waiter was so professional.  He is poised, knowledgeable and friendly at the same time.  He really made our evening.  It was a pleasure eating there.  We had just come from a crazy Elvis wedding, and going to the Kona Grill was a perfect ending to our evening."}
{"text":"Friendly service.  Awesome friendly service.  Good food.  Not great but good food.   I expected better but prices are not bad.  Too be honest your better deal on the strip than horrible casino prices.   It wasn't like awesome Sea Bass but it was good.  It wasn't like oh you got to go here but you won't be disappointed.   It's a far better option than say ceases or Wynn restaurants.   Far better.  Go here over staying at casino restaurants."}
{"text":"yyyyeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeessssssssss!!!  every time i visit, we make sure to stop here for their wonderful happy hour. $4 specials on drinks and half priced menu items that include some of my favorites, such as: mini kahuna burgers, pepperoni pizza, and the soft tacos.  during regular dinner time, i highly recommend the hana salad. holy shit. i hate salad. i been forcing myself to eat it for a year now, but this thing was phenomenal! i think i lactated from my tit it was that good... okay, sorry about that visual.   anyway, i highly recommend this place. do not miss it."}
{"text":"What a huge disappointment. Came here for Father's Day dinner. We decided to go at 3pm to avoid crowds and the place was only about half full. Unfortunately the service was horrible. Our server must have forgot to put our order in as it took over 30 minutes to get our appetizers. Once we did get food we had to track down another server for silverware and drink refills. There was no offer of dessert and getting the check was as hard as getting refills on drinks.   We ordered some sushi which was ok, I've had better here in the past. We also had the Pad Thai and Pulled Pork sandwiches. Overall the food was just ok.   Bottom line, when you spend almost $100 for four people for dinner you expect great food and great service. Huge disappointment."}
{"text":"We went for lunch today. It was pretty quiet. The restaurant has a very nice design/layout to it with a mix of tables, bar seating and lounge areas.  Looks like there might be plans for an amazing patio in the summer.  Food was good. The kids meal offered the best variety I've ever seen, although a little pricey.  We ordered the smoked Gouda fondue. I did enjoy it, but it didn't mix well with the remainder of Japanese dishes we ordered. We enjoyed the volcano rolls and sushi platter.  Dessert was amazing - butter cake with raspberry sauce and vanilla ice cream.  We'll worth the price!! Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"So listen to this, Came here at 10:30 for a take out.... I encounter a nice lady in the entrance and straight away a manager comes in and takes over service (ok..) Ohhh they had only happy hour, which is fine but when u do this to take out u don't get happy hour prices WTF??!!!?!? That's the weirdest thing I've heard of....  It was already late for anywhere else so I took my order 34 $$$$ for 4 sushi rolls, what ever... Oh by the way they advertise free sushi roll when check in, that counts only when u order an entree. Have to say I was disappointed. The place is usually user friendly, today it was less Just got home, I didn't get what I ordered"}
{"text":"I went with a small group of friends over the weekend for lunch. I had the chicken Caesar salad and it was good. Some of my friends had sushi or sandwiches and everyone was happy with their meals."}
{"text":"This place is horrible. The bartender was talking crap about me including making a masturbation hand gesture in my direction to other kona staff right in front of me. The manager tried to down play it and argue that his bartender wouldnt do that. The manager clearly doesnt care about how his customers are treated by his unprofessional staff. Kona would be better if it was an empty space."}
{"text":"Happy hour was amazing but the service was HORRIBLE, would not give my party extra chairs outside, and employees were rude."}
{"text":"Loved the free appetizer with YELP check in. The best thing on the menu... avocado egg rolls! Pretty good sushi! The outdoor sitting was nice. Food overall was fine. Nothing to run back for but would reorder the sushi. Wasn't very busy but service was just okay. Had to track him down for the bill. The chocolate brownie dessert tasted a little stale so just ate the ice cream. I hated we wasted the $9 on it. I should have requested it be removed from bill. If you are at Fashion Mall, it's an okay choice but don't go out of your way. Im sure it's mostly tourist and not a lot of repeat or local business."}
{"text":"Just a trendy grossly overpriced restaurant.  Food is mediocre at best.  Usually a loud and obnoxious crowd who think there cool...NOT !!!"}
{"text":"Ordered the pad-tai was awful. I never tasted such a bad pad-tai and it smells like sewer. Also the Greek salad was a joke $10 for nothing! Not even 20% fresh! Stay away from here"}
{"text":"Wonderful atmosphere, service and food.  Best club sandwich I've ever had!  Definitely going to try other items on your menu.  Sadly though, I think they may have ruined my future club sandwich experiences.  Bar has been set really high now."}
{"text":"Yes. Just yes. Absolutely amazing. Awesome atmosphere, nice staff, delicious food! Got the veggie roll with soy paper and the oriental salad, angry edamame, and sushi sampler! All was delicious."}
{"text":"The waiter, Michael, we had this past Friday declined to make coffee when it was ordered. He didn't offer to ask another employee if he could get help for that. He also dropped our bill off without asking if we'd like 5 separate bills as we were a party of 5. He left and one of us had t track him down.  Food and drinks were great though."}
{"text":"I really enjoy Kona Grill for every time I go I never seem to have a problem! Each time I go I stop and look at the beautiful fish in their large fish tanks, I always sit outside on their shaded spacious patio and the staff is always incredibly friendly. This time I ordered the Basil Pesto, which was magnificent! It's a mix of sausages, chicken, noodles and their creamy basil pesto sauce. The dish is very flavorful and exciting with a hint of spicy at the end! My son was able to enjoy the basic chicken tenders and fries which seem to always satisfy him, we were able to have a very nice lunch and each of us enjoyed our meals.  This is a great place to come for lunch or dinner; they have a great bar to sit at if you are looking to come for drinks. The inside dining area is very classy and open, and if your in the mood for being outside they have high top table and regular tables to seat plenty. This place gets crowded on Friday and Saturday nights, but there is definitely a reason! Great food, great service and great drinks!"}
{"text":"I checked this place out for happy hour and it was pretty good. The discounts are on overpriced mall restaurant food but that aside still better than full price. I think the best app I had was the calamari. Crunchy and not too rubbery which is death if they cook them too long or let them sit too long so it gets soggy. Sushi was only four pieces which most sushi places will give you 6 or 8 for the same price. Flatbread was decent, but the fish tacos were tasteless. Might have better luck in the main dining room."}
{"text":"Great appetizers at Kona Grill.  Myles, the Manager, is very personable and runs a great team. Excellent service!  Highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I came when it was raining and the host said the rooftop was covered. The roof was not fully covered and there was rain water pouring on the bar area. Me and my friend sat at a table that was mostly dry and waited to be greeted. After a few minutes go by, two more people came and sat at a table and were immediately greeted. I then tried to get a server's attention and let him know we hadn't been greeted yet. He responded very rudely and rolled his eyes as he walked into the kitchen. This place is dirty and had rude staff. I don't think I'll be going back and I'll definitely warn my friends about this place."}
{"text":"Great fresh food; the poke and Cobb were awesome. Great service. Miles was excellent."}
{"text":"Food was great. What can I say.  We tried a few things and they were all great.  Staff was super friendly.  Maybe I got lucky but this was a good experience.   It could also be that Vegas is just generally much more hospitable."}
{"text":"LOVE the food but the service was not even close to 4 stars- server was very humble and nice..when we actually saw him.  I have been here before and was excited to take the boyfriend but the service was rough.  - Didn't get service until 15mins after sitting down, they were busy but not THAT busy. He forgot our waters for a while...and never, not one time, asked how our food and drinks were.  Really hoping for better service on our next visit. I'm not sure if we hit an 'off' day but all the employees seem cold and unhappy which sucks for the atmosphere..not friendly at all.  A plus- they have not just one great happy hour but two great happy hours and the patio seating is nice."}
{"text":"I went here during happy hour and I was impressed.  It was full of young professionals and the specials were really great.  The staff was really polite.  The only complaint is that the floor is a bit sticky in the bar and it kind of smells like the alcohol is not quite scrubbed off the floor.  But where else can you get $4 appletini or cosmopolitans right?  I also tried their spicy tuna roll and it was $3!  How can you really complain right?  I did take a look at the other menu.. it isn't really dedicated to sushi or any type of authentic Japanese food.  Oh.. and the only weird thing.  It's at the first floor of the mall.  It would be much cooler if it was on the street where people walk by not where cars are driving out of the parking structure."}
{"text":"Great food. But the service is so bad that it usually ruins the meal. Sushi comes out warm because the servers are so slow. I remember the last 3 times I sat at the bar , no one else was there, and it took the bar tender 30 mins to ask me if i wanted anything to drink. do NOT go for the service... maybe just order food to go."}
{"text":"Happy Hour Review   Although this is not my favorite restaurant, its convenient location and attractive happy hour prices brought me and my YAP  in. Until 7:00pm half off selected apps including selected rolls...3 crab-stix and 1 spicy tuna. Average (rail / draft ) price $3.00. You have to sit in the upstairs bar area for the discount, which automatically puts you behind the 8-ball for good service.   The food was 'OK', I was unable to determine if the crab filling in the rolls was \"true crab\" , the pot sticker filling was much like flavored sawdust, however...the sweet and spicy shrimp were pretty good... so 2 out of 3 apps were decent.   See posted picture of suspect pot-stickers... proceed with caution!   if we make it back again, will opt for the pizza apps... they can't screw that up... right??   The Good: Location, views, prices  The Bad: Food..not the best  Just Plain Ugly: Pot sticker filling"}
{"text":"The food was great especially the lemon garlic shrimp penne!   But the service was really slow :("}
{"text":"Jesus!! 4 small pieces of fish for 13$ seriously? My bill was $130 and I went away still hungry. Spicy beans were  great the food was good the service was great but the portions are just a little bit small for how much you pay."}
{"text":"mmmm so good and a great happy hour...i wanna go tonight!! I love their margaritas!!"}
{"text":"Disaster from the moment we entered this place.  Our party was ignored for 10 minutes and no greeter in sight.  We were finally asked by a server \"can I help you with something?\". After another 5 minutes the greeter finally appeared and we were seated after much confusion.  Our server introduced himself to us unfortunately we did not get his name come to find out a real server was Allison who was training the person that introduced himself at the beginning.  Allison advised that she was training our server but really never kept tabs on him or followed him at all basically let him take care of us unsupervised.  I chose the chicken pad thai and asked just out of curiosity was it spicy I was informed by our server that it was extremely spicy one of the spiciest dishes on the menu.  I question this because rarely is chicken pad thai a spicy dish unless you specify that you want it to be spicy he assured me however it was extremely spicy so I passed.  I chose instead the chicken stir-fry which he assured me was not at all spicy.  Unfortunately when my chicken stir fry arrived, I took one small bite of the chicken as I noticed all of the red pepper flakes in it and the other pepper flakes and found that was extremely spicy.  Knowing that I couldn't eat this I just left the dish set there until Allison finally walked by and asked if there was a problem which I promptly told her that this dish was extremely spicy and our server had told us that it was not she surprisingly said oh yes that's one of the spiciest dishes we have on the menu.  I asked why I was told the chicken pad thai was spicy and she replied I'm not sure because we don't put any spice in that which really made me angry.  At that point I just ask that she take the dish away when she said she would try to make it not spicy I absolutely refused I just lost my appetite and didn't want to eat anymore.  The manager of course came and apologized however the server saw fit to joke about spicyness through the rest of the meal with our group.  I'm writing this review as I'm waiting to pick up my burger from In N Out.  This is definitely a place I would never return to.  Unfortunately I don't know whether to blame the server Allison or the server that was training for the poor training he got from Allison.  It's obvious he should never have been left alone as he is not aware of the restaurants offerings or their menu selections."}
{"text":"I was excited when they opened this new Kona I just have to go to the one in Boca Park and if you know the one in Boca Park as a Summerlin regular you would know that the staff there is just such a pain in the ... I stopped going there because this little bartender Gena was just always so rude to my friends and it seemed like she would give attention and care to other customers beside us. Are you still coming here regularly with my friend Jackie and jennifer When this one opened I couldn't believe how much nicer this location was in comparison to the Summerlin location the food quality was actually better and we were told of the specials and happy hour every time we sat down even though we already knew It's at my impression of Kona Grill to another level otherwise I just wouldn't of liked this Polynesian Japanese type restaurant at all.  Bathrooms are clean and so was the server that we last had the last time I was there recently.  Not bad  Definitely give it a chance they have a good happy hour if you're in the area"}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quick lunch at 11:30 when it opened, was greeted and seated right away. Waters were poured and waitress came over introduced herself. We ordered 1order of Shrimp Sushi, 1order Salmon Sushi, Pot Stickers (seared chicken & vegetable dumplings, asian slaw, traditional soy dipping sauce) and Chili Lime Shrimp (roasted corn, cucumbers, red onions, tomatoes, avocado, sautéed mushrooms, wonton strips, honey lime dressing).   The service was good, the space was great to sit out in, plenty of room, but the food was the most mediocre tasting food I've had at a commercial restaurant. The potstickers were tastelessness. The filling was this gray color minced filling. The Salad though pretty, was Blah tasting. The sushi was colorless and tasteless too.  I'm sorry, I old not come back, plenty of other restaurants in the Santan Village that are tastier."}
{"text":"We have ate here numerous times and always had great service and food. Tonight we had a server if he had a disability then please disregard this post if he did not then he must be on drugs. Multiple issues just getting our drinks then came the food. Half our order came out the other half didn't.  The table behind us that sat down after us and got food got shortly after us. It looked like half our order went to their table. They were talking to each other saying that was not all their order to each other and was wrong. We stated we think part of the order got mixed with ours. They called the waiter back and told him.  We told waiter we think part of that order was ours. He said no and then took the order back to the kitchen. Five minutes or longer he brought the same order back out to us and tried to give it to us. We asked him if that was the food on their table and that he took to the back for 5 to 10 minutes. Hehe said yes. We said we don't want that food that's been passed around to all the tables and took back. He then asked us what we wanted to do. He seemed so out of it like way out there mentally. Then asked if would like them to remake the food. We were basically done eating at that point."}
{"text":"Went here on Wed for lunch with some friends and lucky us, it was happy hour!  The happy hour menu was great!  Inexpensive and a pretty good selection of food.  We ordered a few rounds of beverages, edamame, spicy tuna roll, vegetarian roll, california roll, yellowtail jalepeno (not on happy hour menu), potstickers, calimari, sliders and tacos.  Everything was pretty tasty and there was a nice buzz going in the bar and patio area.  It was a good meal and i would definitely go back!  There were four of us and for all that food and drinks it was only $70! (not including tip)"}
{"text":"I have been here now a total of 2 times and both times left very happy. It can get very crowded by the bar for HH and Spy On's but it still is worthy of checking out. The sushi we had at the sushi bar was fresh and fast. The chef even made us something special and it was super yummy. I would love to come back again..and will if Im ever on this side of town. And just FYI; careful of the cougars on the hunt!!"}
{"text":"GRRRR! I AM MAD!! I've been to this place before, and never had trouble, until now!  Me and a couple of friends went for my birthday a few weeks back and lets just say, the service, sucked! They took foooooorever to take our drink order...my sushi went to another table, and my food was COLD. This place is usually good, but i guess it was just the sucky waitress."}
{"text":"Pretty quiet for a Monday night. All in all I enjoyed the food. Our waitress Stephanie was very sweet! They don't have strawberry lemonade for kids but she made it possible for my little one! She def went out of her way. I had the lemon shrimp penne pasta which was very delicious! My daughter had a California roll & it was actually better than most sushi places. She really enjoyed it. I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Kono in Chandler is my favorite Happy Hour spot! Service and food has always great.  Expect it to be really busy during happy hour. I'm not a sushi lover but I always order the fiery shrimp and veg rolls with soy paper. They change the dessert menu but everything I've had tastes great. The last couple times I had the snickers pie and it was amazing!"}
{"text":"I was excited to see how they had redone the restaurant since I was last there 3 years ago and it does indeed look different. It does not have the same quiet atmosphere it once had and I'm sure their great happy hour is the cause. I was very disappointed in their sushi but everything else was decent. I would give it another shot."}
{"text":"I've been going to Kona basically since they opened, mainly at the Scottsdale location but now we live in Chandler.  Their Macadamia Nut Chicken is amazing!!! Absolutely amazing! Probably my favorite dish ever. We also love their sushi. They have many rolls to choose from and the traditional rolls are priced well. I do think the specialty rolls are a bit pricey but they taste so wonderful I'm willing to deal with it.  We went to this location last week and everyone was very willing to make sure there was no cross contamination since my BF is allergic to shellfish. The head chef came out and talked to us. He was very accommodating and explained that the rolls are made in the morning, so there could be cross contamination but he was happy to break down a section to prepare our rolls on fresh surfaces with freshly cleaned utensils. My BF had a very small reaction but nothing the Benadryl couldn't correct. (I have since emailed Kona asking them to prepare their shellfish rolls and non shellfish rolls separately.) Even with a slightly puffy lip my boyfriend and I enjoyed it so much!  The main reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the prices but we'll keep going back!"}
{"text":"Wow. I don't even know where to start. I come to Kona Grill ALL the time with my boyfriend. We always get the same thing, I get the turkey burger and he gets the lobster mac & cheese. Today we came in and did not see either of those items on the menu. Our server unfortunately informed us that they took these two items off the menu. Disappointed. BRING THEM BACK!!"}
{"text":"Have always loved this place until tonight when the hostess treated us like second class citizens!"}
{"text":"Went to dine @ Kona @ High Street on New Years eve with my wife and I must say I was disappointed. I live ten mins away and called in to check on wait times.  They said 15-30 mins waiting but walked in to see that it was not the case. The coffee machine was broken and could not get a cappuccino. The regular coffee was luke warm. No sugar/sweetener to accompany that.  We ordered the food thereafter.  The table was missing salt and pepper. I asked for some crushed pepper, and all they had was a tablespoon full. I told the server that the sea bass crust seemed a little over cooked /burnt...to which he just didn't seem too concerned at all and obliged to get the check. I've had better sea bass at pf changs. The server came just once, toward the end of the meal to ask if we wanted more water. By that point my appetite was done. Overall, we had a not so great experience @ this location."}
{"text":"Just try this new place very impressive when you walk in. A little more spacious and less intimate than I expected. Nevertheless the staff is very good an awesome knowledge of their menu. Remember this is an American franchise the portions are considerably larger than you would expect. You are definitely get your dollar value here. Not your traditional Asian type Fusion food it has a little bit of a Twist to it so be prepared for that. Our server was Adam.. Great guy"}
{"text":"So, I have heard about this place for at least the last ten years. I have driven by it many times. However, it never attracted me to come in even though I love REI. My better half and her girls have been patronizing this place for years and like it. I finally went since friends insisted hey treat me for helping them move some stuff.  I didn't know they remodeled. So, I am not sure what they looked like before. The place looks hip and trendy. Since I am not single and no one in our party was, no one dressed up.  Not that we dress up for most of these eateries in town. It's LV after all and its always casual. Anything special about the decor? Not to me at least. I can easily sit here or sit at Blue Martini, Cheesecake Factory, or Roy's, and not blink an eye. Do t get me wrong, everything looks new and trendy, if you are into that kind of thing. I just wanted a place to sit.  We entered and there were a bunch of hostesses(?) standing around. I am not sure what they were. They were stranding by the podium @ the entrance. I assumed we were told there were no seats available. I was related the message from my friends as I mozied in from behind my group. The girls went looking downstairs for a table and I went upstairs with a friend looking for a table. We went, circled around and found a table in the back. As we were about to call, the girls told is het found a table downstairs too. I always thought that was the hostesses job? As much as I love to hear about their social affairs standing in their booth. I can really care less. It doesn't pay the bills, but  I believe we did. Do you really want to go to a place where you are not really made to feel welcome? But they were busy so I am sure they can care less about a party of 4.  We ordered a crap load of food and drinks and the dinky round bar table could barely contain anything so the server was nice and brought them out as we finished. It would have been more nice if the drinks got refilled as promised. It's so dark outside once he sun goes out. I understand ambiance but you really are just sitting in the dark outside. As the temp cooled, I had to put on my jacket along with everyone else in my group. A gas heater would have provided some light and warmth and served to enhance ha ambiance. It is named after Kona? Do they not ever see Tiki lounges with torches outside? Heck any restaurant outside you go in Hawaii there's something burning at night to give light and ambiance.  So the food. It was ok. Some avocado roll was the best. The pizza thing was ok. More cheese than tomato sauce but that's a personal preference. The sushi tasted good enough for bar food. Yes, to me this is bar food. You know a place you can get tapas and the like. The burger slider was good. Again, it was good but nothing to write home about either. Maybe if it had more flavor it would but overall it was kind of bland. A Five Guys burger has more taste. So overall the food was average. Presentation was great but the taste is just alright. This is where having a great experience would compensate for the food a bit. Don't get me wrong, the food is not bad here. It just could have a little more flavor. The best was the avocado thing out of the five items we ordered. We had a thing with a tortilla chip on the bottom and something on top. I am thinking it was some kind of fish. But, that's how memorable the food was to me.  The server seemed to be trying to get the knack of things but was friendly and cheerful. The bussers worked their butt off. And the hostesses held the podium up.  Oh the scene. I noticed there were quite a few single people sitting and eating by themselves. Kona grills reputation previously as told to me was that it was running with cougars with money and cops. That's probably why I never cared to come. From what I could see as I was walking around to search for a table to sit, there's quite a few available ladies out here ready to mingle.  Will I come back? Yeah maybe in the next 10 years. I am not particularly fond of having to look for my own table when there's people paid to do just that. I will just stick to Downtown Summerlin for local eats. It's within walking distance for me anyway. No need to drive that far to get lousy service. So, unfortunately, as nice as the hard working bussers and waitresses are, those ditzes ( I apologize to ditzes everywhere else) ruin it for the whole staff. I am pretty sure they view customers with biased glasses. But ladies, if you were working at my office, you would've been addressed to shape up or shipped out a long time ago. Then again, maybe Kona Grill pays these professional podium models to keep the place from falling down and pick and choose who they want to feel welcomed at their establishment."}
{"text":"My husband and I were looking for something light for dinner and we came across Kona Grill. We ordered sushi and it was tasty. It hit the spot for the evening."}
{"text":"Kona grill always rocks it. Great sushi rolls, happy hour fun and a new adults only upper deck. The misters and fans keep you cool and comfortable even when it's a hundred degrees outside. Vegetarian rolls for the non-meat crowd are wonderful. We keep going back because it's that good."}
{"text":"Great food. Horrible service. My BF, his Dad and I came here tonight and sat on the patio. Our service was terrible. We had to get our own utensils and my drink order was incorrect. I was disappointed after hearing how great the place was. :/ maybe the dining room experience is different???"}
{"text":"I am a fan of calamari and the dip sauce!  Sashimi always good!  The size of sushi quite big for one time bite. I though sushi should be smaller size. The taste always good!  Always come back there for the happy hour :) Awsome!"}
{"text":"Had the Cuban sandwich and a California roll, both were delish! Diverse menu and a mixture of items from the land and sea to choose from!"}
{"text":"Sat at the bar and Ross took excellent care of us. The food is always on point here and comes out quickly. They have happy hour and reverse happy hour with TONS of stuff on it. Their calamari is the best in town I've tried, flat breads are delicious, and I dream about their sushi!"}
{"text":"It was our first time at this location. Love how the hostess greeted us very friendly made us feel welcome  great service we would definitely come again!!! My favorite dish macadamia nut chicken soo tasty !!"}
{"text":"So went to long grill for sushi happy hour today.  First I sat at the sushi bar, tons of staff walking around it was steady but not excessively busy.  I was going to order the sushi happy hour.   As I sat down I waited 15 minutes before a server even came back to take a drink order!  Not even kidding you know it's bad when the sushi chef has to go and retrieve a glass of ice water for you!  Then I was informed the sushi happy hour is no longer served at the sushi bar, that you have to go to a table, the little girl told me it was changed this week on a corporate level!  How stupid is that at a sushi bar!  There is definitely some service related issues going on here"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants to go to with the girls. Great cocktail list and sushi selection. Too bad the happy hour isn't on the weekends. Otherwise, I love the Effen Cucumber Mojita, philly roll and California roll. I practically get the same thing every time. Hard to mess with a good thing! The only thing to be aware of is that unless you have a reservation, you will probably have to wait for a table. This is true for the weekends, anyway. So I highly suggest making a reservation!"}
{"text":"We went for the Happy Hour (4 adults and one child). The seating for the Happy Hour is limited to a certain area I the restaurant. We requested a booth, but were told that that the open booths were not available because they were reserved. When we called  earlier in the day to make a reservation for the Happy Hour we were told  that we could not make a reservation. There seems to be a disconnect. The value of the Happy Hour items was good, food and service were good."}
{"text":"Went here for a business dinner and had a pretty disappointing experince. The food was okay, nothing special. The staff clearly needs some further training. Our food was delivered by 2 different people (none of them was our waitress) that pretty much just auctioned off our food, not knowing what went where. To make it even more disappointing is that neither of them knew what dish they were delivering to us. No product knowledge whatsoever! I would not dine here again."}
{"text":"I love Kona Grill back home so hubby and I decided to stop by this location when we were in town. Located in \"City North\" this place is a perfect meeting place for any size group. The outside patio area is lovely and they have an expanded patio area for larger groups too. Their happy hour on the bar side goes from 3-7pm most weekdays with a late night happy hour for you night owls. They have now added their \"all day\" Sunday happy hour so don't miss out on that! You can leave feeling satisfied after choosing from a variety of their apps. My favorite is the sweet and sour shrimp. Pair that with a small salad and you'll be coming back for more. They have an endless list of delicious sushi rolls to choose from too. I prefer happy hour over dinner. You'll get a lot of food at a reasonable price.   I am particularly attracted to their bar/outside seating area. I prefer it for a casual gathering and it tends to be a lot quieter than sitting inside. The bar area is positioned so even if you are sitting on the inside of the restaurant (at the bar) you get the feeling like you're still sitting outside.  Our server was attentive, knowledgeable and very friendly. This place is a sure \"winner\" next time you're near by."}
{"text":"This place is awesome for happy hour. We had the wave roll (spicy tuna, shrimp tempura, avocado, cucumber, soy paper), crunchy crab roll, crab special roll, and calamari. Everything but the wave roll was delicious and the bill was about $20. You can't beat that!"}
{"text":"What happened to the happy hour menu? Most of the items I've ordered for years are no longer part of happy hour. And did they raise prices AGAIN? Does the chicken satay no longer include hoison sauce to cut costs? I just can't do kona any longer."}
{"text":"I love Kona Grill! I go to the one on Summerlin but this location is great! Center of the strip with amazing view and FOOD is amazing! I ordered the Picasso And Coconut Shrimp Roll and both are amazing!!!! This wa my first time here and our server Toni is amazing! She is great, funny and has an amaIng sense of humor! The level of service here is phenomenal and quick!! Must come and try this place!!"}
{"text":"A GREAT happy hour! I adore their sushi rolls! Crunchy crab ($4.5) will make you anything but crabby. Wonderful service!"}
{"text":"Came here for HH on a Sunday with friends. Sat in the bar area. Our server \"Amir\" was very pleasant and nice. He was very attentive and friendly. Enjoyed our food and drinks . The Sangrias were pretty weak though haha. Other than that I would def return again."}
{"text":"This restaurant  is near my house and my husband and I like to go here a lot. Never had a problem or a complaint. Servers are great and food taste amazing!! Be careful if you have allergies because they add a lot of random great different ingredients in them. I highly recommend Kona Grill on Rampart"}
{"text":"Happy Hour is really good! The sushi chef Ricky is great and orders some of the best seafood I've ever had. I like that the food is always consistent every time I visit and the service is usually great. If it's slow, I don't recommend sitting at the sushi because sometimes the servers forget about you. Otherwise I really enjoy the food and service when I'm there!"}
{"text":"This location of Kona is a great spot to hang out and meet some locals. Their happy hour is on point and the atmosphere is the perfect place to enjoy yourself after a day at work. Would definitely recommend for locals or people visiting that want to do something different."}
{"text":"Incredible Sea Bass!!! As good as you could ever hope for. My beautiful wife had the chili lime shrimp salad and she thought it excellent! Butter cake with raspberry sauce and vanilla bean ice cream to finish off a fantastic meal- all at a reasonable price too. Our server Samantha was really knowledgeable about the food and menu and she was great!  My new favorite place !"}
{"text":"Seriously, portions are small, flavor was below average and the price for what you get is sad.  I'm not typically this negative but after portions and taste I had too."}
{"text":"Great Food , Nice Drinks  Service was ok, the Managers tables touches were not genuine over all appearance looked sloppy."}
{"text":"I lived in Hawaii for almost 30 years, on the Big Island where Kona is, and never heard of this place. When I asked what island they are on, I was told, \"none of them\".  - What?  This is a nice place to go and grab a drink and a cocktail with friends."}
{"text":"Love this place!! They have happy hr all day Sunday! Great food and great cocktails!! It's a great place to go get some drinks an hang out!! Love the outside seating."}
{"text":"This place was awesome and the staff was very friendly we had a birthday dinner for our daughter and she really enjoyed herself and the food was great they also have a happy hour for sushi very nice."}
{"text":"Always fan of Happy Hour here in the past. Happened to visit on an early Sat evening. Service was a bit slow and it didn't even seem busy. Love me some mac and cheese so decided to get Lobster Mac and Cheese. Lots of Lobster = good. $17 for not even a breadstick/salad = not good. Probably wouldn't have bothered me if it was a big portion/smaller plate underneath but it looked so lonely when it was brought to me. Gonna stick to HH...."}
{"text":"I believe your first impression leaves a lasting mark. The girls who Kona Grill have as the hostess seemed very snoody and seemed bothered that you interrupted their conversation so that you could sit down and eat at the restaurant that employs them. Other than that the dinner was exceptional; edamame with angry sauce, a house salad, macadamia nut chicken, and a refreshing seasonal Sam Adams. The waitress was very kind and provided help for my wife in describing a few of the things on the menu. Also, if you split the chicken dish be sure to order the house salad with the dish and an additional house salad. We simply ordered 2 house salads which are $5.75 each instead of one with the meal at $4 and the additional one would have been $5.75. Other than that it was a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"Always something good going on here.  Kona Grill's Happy Hour has a good selection and some deals to be found, and it goes on 7 days a week!  The servers are very courteous and helpful with making suggestions."}
{"text":"Took my wife here for lunch after touring the new Mormon Temple. Great experience. Staff was friendly, efficient and attentive. I had the Miso Sea Bass which was cooked to perfection. It came with seasonal sautéed vegetables and pork fried rice, all which were excellent. My wife had the sushi sampler and was also well pleased with her choice. Sushi was fresh, well prepared and flavorful. This is a great choice!"}
{"text":"The Miso Sea Bass is one of my go-to all time favorite meals. This location always has great service and the food is spot-on."}
{"text":"Went for the famous happy hour and wasn't impressed. The happy hour menu was quite limited. I believe it was a \"Ladies Margarita\", a cosmo, domestic bottles and I think Sake bombs. Food was OK, I just expected more after the hype."}
{"text":"Horrible Service.  I have not been to a kona grill in some time due to gluten free restrictions I have to take into account starting a few years ago.  We were shopping in the area and seen they now have a dedicated Gluten Free menu.  When we arrived we asked the hostess if we could view the menu first just to see what options we had.  She was fairly rude, gave us one menu (for 3 people to look at) and walked away.  We decided to stay and eat and then got a server who obviously had no idea about gluten free.  We became an inconvenience for him.  He didn't know any details, didn't offer to ask, and then offered to do a side of fried rice (we've had this gluten free at other places).  About 35 min later I believe the manager, who by the way saved this from being a 1 star review came to our table.  Very nice and asked about our gluten free request.  We let him know we have to eat gluten free.  He then stated that the fried rice Is not gluten free and offered to give us something else.  What I failed to mention before is that when we ordered we asked if we could do a side of fruit with our  turkey burgers.  We were told \"No\" we don't have that as an option.  Back to the manager, he said we can do vegetables or fruit for you.  Awesome we will take the fruit we said.  We wanted to order that originally but were told you don't have that.  The manager said they do and will take care of that for the future guests to know.  The meal ended up being good, we got what we wanted, but the service was horrible and two out of the three employees treated us like we were weird people due to our food requirements."}
{"text":"Trendy lil hot spot especially for happy hour. I love the BIG BOOTHS. Myke FIT! Definitely Hawaiian Sized...Brah....Wait...not a hawaiian sized bra. But Brah...like brotha brah. Not like hold your hawaiian boobs bra. Nevermind. I haven't really had dinner here. But I did have the Satay. Very tasty. Not traditional. Slightly sweet. But flavorful. The sushi here is good too. Not like fresh off the boat that it's still moving good. But it's good portions. Like the spicy tuna. I tell the chef extra spicy. He knows what I'm talking about!  Oh yea set my tongue on fire baby!  Great place to socialize and it's really not as snobby as I thought. Much better than Roy's.  I was expecting an asian fusion place but they do a lot of traditional foods and add different asian influences....YUM."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious and well priced for the location. They have great Yelp offers as well. I did not expect to receive free appetizers and sushi rolls just for checking in. If you want a nice laid back place to go to for a date, this is the place. It's also good for a quick stop for something before the gym. The dishes have a good balance between carbs, fats, and protein. The happy hour has great prices. The offers include sushi rolls, alcohol and some of their dishes for less than $10.   The location also has an attractive crew. The waitress, Mia, was exceptionally nice and attentive to anything our table needed. She made sure to warn me of any spicy red the dishes may have. I am willing to come back here again.   The server, Jaime, has excellent service."}
{"text":"Had a dinner here tonight. Food was good, no complaints. Service was ok. We wasn't checked as often as we should, had to put our dirty plates by ourselves to have a space for another meal. Also we were a party of seven and was sharing dishes but they bring us 6 plates twice."}
{"text":"Been here twice and both times were great. Excellent service and the good is great. I recommend the macadamia nut tacos. So good!!!! Also, the raspberry Mojito! Best pork fried rice... Ever."}
{"text":"Was taken there for my birthday for sushi. Not only did we enjoy our food, I have to say the service was very good. I will most definitely go again."}
{"text":"Everything here was amazing!  We ordered several different dishes to try, and none of them were disappointing.  They have good portions sizes and their prices are reasonable.  We also had a large party and the server was on point and very accommodating when it came to splitting checks.  We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"OK Kona Popped my Sushi Cherry........and it was pretty good.....  the LAs Vegas rolls! and there crunchy Crab was good and the Eel thingy....  but I've heard there's lots better and I'm just inexperienced....so until I've slept around I'm giving it 4 stars..."}
{"text":"Tonight I walked in ahead of my team of 6. Talking with the hostess at the front seemed to annoy her and when I absolutely could not get information from her I asked for a manager. That resulted in a very annoyed hostess and when she went to fetch him she asked me to sit down and wait.  Gray or Grey the manager came out after making me wait for a few minutes and I asked him some simple questions that I asked the server. I asked him what he liked and wasn't sure why the the hostess only would reply with \"Depends on what you're in the mood for\".  Gray curtly informed me that he didn't have time for me fooling around and left while I was talking to him mid sentence.  Maybe I'm not much to look at while being 19 and not being portly like he is, but I was so offended I left as well.  As I was walking out, my team that does internal marketing came in and pleaded with me to go in with them.  I'm a manager and I went to spend time with my team. The entire menu is over-priced and the food is mediocre at best.  Farmed fish for sushi is pathetic, and a small bowl of miso soup from paste cost $5. I didn't get any food because I will not eat under a mans roof who insults me, so I sat with the team and discussed business while waiting to see Gray again. He never showed his face again.  The other servers were pretty polite but that didn't undo how Gray was."}
{"text":"Delicious food and a great location right on the strip! Went shopping at the mall and worked up an appetite. Had a delicious chopped salad and the checkerboard roll which was out of this world. Service was fast and our waitress was very attentive. Great flavor and a little bit of a kick with the habanero tuna. Only regret was not finding this restaurant earlier while visiting Vegas. Will definitely make sure to go again the next time I'm back and check out their other locations!"}
{"text":"The food was decent. I would give it 3.5 stars If I could. We got the Las Vegas roll, calamari, and a pizza. All were decent and It was more affordable than any of the restaurants at the hotel we were staying at. I also had the sake red sangria. It was very refreshing on a hot day."}
{"text":"Great happy hour drinks and food.  Always enjoy going to Kona!  I especially like their potstickers and pad thai combo."}
{"text":"My visit started out less than pleasant.  It was a bit cold outside, but they have these nice gas lamps to keep the patio warm so we chose an outdoor seat.  The gas lamp was not working, and the staff made very little effort to fix it, and actually kind of caught an attitude when we asked.    Then, the magic began.  We were there on a Sunday, so almost all of their specialty drinks, and many of their appetizers and rolls were half price.  I LOVE half price happy hour!  We had mojitos and pretty much any food item you can think of.  Everything was delicious.  This location is in a small strip mall, but because it was a Sunday, the usual hustle and bustle had died down.  The best part, it's a chain!  That means that I don't have to go all the way to Vegas to have more Kona :)  Try it."}
{"text":"Happy hour was great. Paula was awesome and helped us when we almost ordered the wrong thing. We ended up with the Hamada roll, Fiery shrimp roll, potstickers and BBQ chicken flatbread. It was all good. The hostess gave us a card for a free margarita -- always a plus! We sat out on the patio and people watched. Overall it was a good night."}
{"text":"Not impressed with Kona Grill. Sushi is just mediocre.  Also, they have a deceiving email I just received. It states \" Enjoy a \"Free\" Spicy King Crab Roll. It goes on to say National King Crab meat day is tomorrow, March 9th and we're giving out free* rolls to celebrate. Note the asterisk, which says restrictions apply.  Then it goes on to say how to get your \"free\" crab roll. So you click on the email and if you're one of the first 5??? lucky people you get a free Crab roll. They will let you know by tomorrow if you're a winner.  First 5 people? Really?? Kona Grill please don't insult my intelligence. It also states if you're one of the \"lucky?\" winners you can bring in the coupon tomorrow BUT you have to spend $25.   Here's the exact verbiage......   If you're a winner:  Offer is valid for dine-in only. $25 minimum purchase. Cannot be combined with any other offers. One offer per table. You will receive a coupon by March 9, 2018. Must present coupon for redemption. Only redeemable on March 9, 2018 at US and Puerto Rico locations.  I'm sorry this is ridiculous! I'm not patronizing this establishment."}
{"text":"The food was great and so was the service!  I went with a group and everyone's check was correct.  I know that is a difficult task in its self."}
{"text":"I get disappointed every time, the food is okay. I mean the place is beautiful and huge with a prime location, considering there pricing one would think it's a little more high end.  Never the case, the service has always been good but literally I dreaded going back. Only reason I did was due to a friends birthday.  Before this I tried their sushi rolls I forget the names of them and for good reason (nothing spectacular) you can get better rolls at any sushi bar and the bento box for my sons. The bento box was pretty week I must admit.  This time around I decided to try the sea bass, it was just okay. I can't recommend this for the money they charge and the presentation is pretty sad. All their food looks like it was made at home. That's the best way I can describe it. It's a great atmosphere and service is good I just hope they improve the recipes."}
{"text":"Colleague and I went in for Happy Hour today.  The bar and patio was full so we had no choice but to sit in the 100% empty dinning area.  We were the only people in the whole dining area.  Ordered the Sushi and wine and the waiter tells us that Happy Hour will not be accepted where we sit.  We have to pay full price, even though 15 feet away everybody else is getting it half price.  I ask for a Manager. This guy name Don comes over.  I should have known it was going to be a horrible experience because when I asked the waiter, his facial expression pretty much implied that he'll get the manager, but he already knew the outcome.  So this Don guy comes over and I tell him what I do for a living, not to impress him, but to explain that I cater from them all the time, that we always come over for happy hour, and because of that loyalty and the money we spend in their restaurant I would appreciate if he could use his discretion to accommodate a customer.   And he looks right at me with a condescending way and says \"thanks for telling me what you do for a living, but I'm not going to give you the happy hour price here.\"   I asked him why he would want to lose a customer over $10 and he says, \"I'm not going to debate you.\"  I grew up working in hospitality and this guy is an embarrassment and a horrible restaurant manager.   He seemed to care so much more about his petty policy then making a customer happy.  I hope some district manager reads this and if nothing else wakes up to the fact that this guy is bad news for their restaurant.  If you want an enforcer of policy just have the San Tan Mall Security explain policy to the customers.  But if you want a true manager, please hire someone with an ounce of empathy and desire to make customers happy.   More than anything else, I feel bad for the staff as you can just pick up on the defeat in their eyes.  I can go to 100 different places and will not spend another dime at this place, but those poor people have to work with this condescending jerk everyday."}
{"text":"The interior of the restaurant is really nice and our server was great! She refilled our waters quickly and answered our questions. My group was glad to use the free app/roll promo from Yelp! I believe you can get a free roll worth up to ~$12? On the other hand, the food itself was not great. I tried a spicy salmon roll and the one with baked salmon. The sushi rice was too cold and for the price of ~$8, the salmon portion was tiny."}
{"text":"Great drinks. Had appetizers for food. Server wasn't good. Maybe he was having a bad day. I was there to enjoy myself and did anyway."}
{"text":"Kona is great for happy hour!    They have happy hour all day Sunday's and their happy hour menu is pretty awesome! They have certain rolls half off and other great appetizers at great prices. I ordered their spicy tuna roll, calamari, margarita, and sake sangria. Everything was great except the margarita wasn't phenomenal I've had better also the dipping sauce for the calamari isn't that great either. Everything was great. I've also had their shrimp pad Thai in the past and I am a huge fan of that it's pretty amazing In my opinion.   If you come on Sunday plan accordingly you can only enjoy happy hour prices if you sit in their bar/patio area if you are a huge party it might be tough getting a spot."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this restaurant!  I love bringing clients here because the service is phenomenal and the good food has everyone in a great mood!  Their miso sea bass is done perfectly; so buttery on the inside yet perfectly sear-crusted on the outside.    Their pulled pork sliders with sweet potatoes is also absolutely wonderful.  The sushi sampler is so much food for the price.  They also have all sorts of iced tea and a full bar, of course.    I have never sat on the balcony yet, but I definitely will when the weather cools down.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"My Mynieaha was a great waitress on helping us out on the food and better deals...1st time there and will be back"}
{"text":"Had the Jambalaya minus the Andouille, enjoyed it. Started the meal off with the Avocado Egg Rolls, excellent. Service was great."}
{"text":"If you visit the Kona Grill....DO NOT MISS the  Bama roll and Wave roll.  Also, the Lobster Mac n' Cheese is very tasty, albeit a smaller portion size."}
{"text":"Finally a place where I can get some ahi poke!!"}
{"text":"Holy amazing kids meal!!!  What a pleasant surprise of options and no skimping on the sides.  Don't forgot the orange cut and shaped like a bear. Adult entrees were great too and service was good."}
{"text":"Really good food and really great service! If there's two of you dining, I highly recommend doing the Date Night deal. My boyfriend and I had the NY Strip and it was amazing. I also really love their rolls and the passion fruit creme brûlée. It was our first time here and we'll definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Have a great happy hour. Good food and beer. Enjoyed myself. Great stop for sushi. Try it out if you get a chance."}
{"text":"Server kept disappearing, making me feel neglected.  Wine list is the biggest rip-off in the Valley made up of really terrible, bottom of the barrel labels at outrageous prices.  I have never sent back wine in my life.  When I sent back my glass of wine because the bottle had obviously gone horribly bad the bartender tried to make excuses.  The food itself was pretty darned good, but at this price point I can get much better elsewhere."}
{"text":"Happy hour on the patio tonight at Kona Grill. Our server, Austin, was fantastic and made our dining experience wonderful. We will definitely be coming back!!"}
{"text":"The first thing I noticed here was that they didn't clean the clams thoroughly.  My clam chowder was crunchy.  The sushi was mediocre.  The atmosphere was great.  The waitress was spot on until the latter portion of the meal, when both my dining partner and I were in dire need of water and had no waitress to fill our glasses."}
{"text":"We were seated... and sat. And sat. No service and nobody acknowledged my family and I for 15 minutes. We got up and walked out, I told the hostess we received no service. No apology and no acknowledgement. We walked over to ZTejas. Amazing service! The staff is so friendly and they assisted us immediately. 5 stars for ZTejas! Even my boys were wowed by ZTejas service!"}
{"text":"I really like this place for happy hour drinks and appetizers, they have a nice outside bar area and friendly staff."}
{"text":"I admit, I'm not much of a sushi connoisseur, but Kona Grill definitely was really tasty! I came here Friday night with a group of people to celebrate a friends birthday, and I really enjoyed myself.  The menu is easy to read with a variety of different options. The descriptions help me order since I am completely in the dark about sushi.  In between the server and my friends, I ordered quite a few plates of different food and all of them were really tasty.  I think my favorite was the Las Vegas roll by far!  My friend and I also split the Philly roll along with a few other dishes as well.  They have some really strong chocolate martinis, and overall I had a really good experience here.  I think I like it here for a variety of reasons. For starters, its easy to order if your new to sushi like I am.  The server will help you if you have any questions, and I found the food to be really really good.  Not that other places are bad, but it can be overwhelming if you have no idea what your doing like me.  Also, they have plenty of stuff with out avocado in it since I think its one of the most disgusting foods in the entire world.  (I know some people will give me slack about it, but the consistency and lack of flavor completely turn me off and I just think its gross overall. This includes guacamole.)  If your not into sushi, they also have several other menu options such as burgers and sandwiches which I think is awesome!  I know if I came here again I can order just about anything, weather its a burger or a Las Vegas roll and know that I will enjoy myself.  Great menu, service and overall good time. Try it out of your in the area!"}
{"text":"Didn't get my business last night. Bar was completely packed for happy hour. The one waitress who talked to me (reluctantly) told me to order at the bar since I didn't have a table. I was out.  Gotta get there early to \"enjoy\" Kona's happy hour."}
{"text":"The most amazing sushi and non-sushi combo.  Brian was such a great sushi chef.  He recommended just the right roll -checker roll. Spicy and fresh with avocado....who could go wrong?  Oscar also was amazing - you have to come here for sushi.  There's sushi everywhere in Vegas, but the staff and creativity make this the place to go!"}
{"text":"It has been a while since we visited  Kona Grill at Boca Park.  We love the place.  We always have a great experience.  We love and enjoyed the happy hour.  Beer is good and the California Rolls were always \"spot on\".  The experience today left me a bit perplexed.  I debated writing an experience response on Yelp.  I truly feel this website can have positive and negative effect for a business.  For that I am very shy about giving a negative response.  I want to start off first by saying that we still enjoy Kona Grill.  I would recommend everyone to experience it. If nothing else to just people watch.  Great atmosphere and the food is always over the top good.  I am and have been in the food service industry.  I have been for over 20 years.  Usually fine and casual dining.  The reason I mention this is because I am understanding and never complain.  I have walked in the shoes of the food servers.  We all have bad days.  What happened already!  Well here it is.  We were greeted very respectfully and professionally by the host.  They did not have any downstairs outdoor seating.  They gave us directions for their upstairs outdoor section.  I loved it.  We sat at a table and waited for our server.  We waited and waited and waited.  We were seated for 10 minutes without even a hello or a head nod.  I decided to greet the bartender.  She was cordial and helpful.  She directed what appeared to be the only waitress on staff upstairs.  She visited 5 minutes later.  Very short without as much as a smile.  We placed our drink order.  Glass of beer, glass of Chardonnay and an ice tea.  She asked it we wanted sweetener for the tea.  We said yes, Sweet and Low.  We waited and we waited.  Finally the drinks arrive by a different waitress.  So there was more than one.  This waitress took our for our waitress.  Finally our waitress arrived.  Still no sweet and low.  Again very short and not even making eye contact.  What is this about.   I addressed the bartender for the sweet and low along silverware.  She provided them for us and apologized for the poor service from our waitress.  I said that is okay.  I know sometimes we get busy.  Oh let me mention.  They were not fully seated busy.  After the bartender left the manager came to our table.  Nice gentleman.  He apologized.  I explained that was okay.  I know we get busy and I don't want this to reflect negatively on your server.  The food arrived and as usual it was awesome.  After the manager left the table the waitress finally returns again with very little enthusiasm or eye contact.  She never asked to refill our drinks or even ask for desert.  As she came by one last time to clear the plates, I asked for the bill.  I truly felt like a second class citizen with the service.  I am not certain if the server had a bad day or just had a bad table.  That happens.  I don't ask for over the top service, but I do expect service as you would every table.  I truly debated writing a review.  In fact this is the first I have ever done for a restaurant.  I do not want anyone to get in trouble.  I want the same service as the table next to me.  I will still return to the restaurant.  I will still enjoy the best happy hour in town.  I feel this post will help in training and improve service and experience for the customers.  I still highly recommend the Kona Grill.  Great atmosphere."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place zero stars. Worst service I've ever had. Order a drink & it took about 20 minutes until we had to reach out to another server to actually get our drinks. Then our waiter try's to flip a cup and cracks it on the ground? Very professional. Not once did he come up to us and ask how we were doing. I think he knew we felt awkward so mid dinner we received a new waitress who didn't come over to us until we waived her down. Very snotty and took about 15 minutes to give us our checks back. I love konas food but their service makes me never want to come back."}
{"text":"Our experience here as a family was okay. It's wasn't the best experience coming to Kona though we keep trying to give it a chance today will most likely be our last day. Konas food just doesn't sit well in our bellies. We were pleased with the waiter as he was very accommodating when we ordered the coconut shrimp roll and it wasn't to our liking just because it was a new roll and we were trying it for the first time. We asked to switch and he was more than happy to help so thanks to Zane! The overall staff all seem like a good group of people but the service here seems to be lacking and slow and is in need of some improvement as a whole restaurant. We had our son with us and he's not one to get antsy, but he was wondering why it was taking so long to get our food and that could probably be why we lost our appetite/or food didn't sit well, and he was wondering again why it was taking so long to get the check and to come take our form of payment it wasn't too busy there and he also mentioned that he kept seeing our waiter and he was looking at our waiter but our waiter would avoid coming to our table. My husband and I always tip and we always communicate with one another about how much we want to put and of course that depends on our waiter/waitress and the service we are given and it has to be pretty bad when my husband chooses to put down $0 for tip. He's big on tipping. But he was very disappointed in the service just due to how long we had to wait and how slow it was. We would love to come back if the quality improves!"}
{"text":"We decided to try Kona Grill after a long day of shopping and we will be back.  Our waiter, John, had a trainee with him and made sure to introduce her as well. He was attentive and made sure we were well taken care of. We had sushi rolls and they were nicely done. They were fresh tasting and presented nicely. The only complaint was the ginger. It was quite vinegar tasting."}
{"text":"Checked in for happy hour. Service was attentive and fast. Great happy hour choices and prices. Don't miss the avacado rolls!!"}
{"text":"It breaks my heart that their food, their sushi is not good.  We used to office at 7150 at the office building in the same parking lot. We loved eating at Kona. It was good. It was social and fun.  Not. Anymore.  Its depressing. On the saturday night, it had an entire section closed off. Sparse. The food was low quality. The rice for my rolls tasted refrigerated. When you're saving money on the rice... There is a problem.   This restaurant has a problem. I wish it did not."}
{"text":"Always ... always good food.   The California roll was fresh and the avacado roll exploded with flavor and a hint of garlic. The sauces were very unique.. we wanted to take them home.   The kahuna burger was huge and juicy.  The kids meal was well worth 8 bucks with a choice of two sides and a drink.  The poke bowls are fresh and the flatbreads were simple but filling (not too filling).  The ambiance is romantic but yet it's good to watch football games! There is a sushi bar and a regular bar and the seating in the lobby is very comfortable.  The only downside... and you can't escape this on the strip... but the prices for the avacado roll was a little high for just three rolls but the kids meal and burgers were affordable."}
{"text":"Great HH. Bartender is awesome and busy, but my two cocktails were spot on. Food was awesome as usual."}
{"text":"We go here all the time, decided to stop in for a late lunch today. This blonde older looking lady was bartending, we ordered waters and she rolled her eyes at us. Then was talking to another server, and we could hear her complaining to him about us ordering waters. We walked out, didn't want to be served by someone who didn't want to serve us!  Other than that I have always liked their service and food. I was sad to have left."}
{"text":"Their happy hour Sake bombs are bomb! Love going here because it reminds me of home, which is a rare find for me since living here in Vegas. Their outdoor area is the perfect spot to to have a drink or 2 and talk story with a friend. And that is why I keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Always busy for HH! They have great patio seating (not in the sun). Food is fast and fabulous. A great place for out of towners to go see the Scottsdale scene and not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Had a bad experience there about  3 years ago but made the effort to go back several times since.  They have a very good (I'm a wine snob -  admit it) BTG wine list (which MOST sushi places overlook) and I enjoy the Houston Roll.  I have taken friends and family there and they have been somewhat mildly impressed.  I will just go with my 2 yo from here on out as I know what to expect and what I like and that is just AOK with me and my kid!"}
{"text":"Great out door patio and very dog friendly. We had the lollipop Naruto and the firecracker sashimi. Both were amazing. The staff was really friendly. We will come back here for sure."}
{"text":"This is the first place I'd ever tried sushi. Yum. It's not THE BEST, but it's serviceable.   So why five stars, you ask?   Because they've got more. Tons more. This is the only restaurant in existence where I can enjoy good sushi AND good pizza at the same time.   And then there's the happy hour. I haven't taken advantage of it yet because I never go to a mall to drink, but if I decided to get buzzed before I shop or go to a movie, this will be perfect. The upper level is also great for people watching!"}
{"text":"Going here even in the evening (around 7 pm) during a Las Vegas summer was not a good idea for me.  They have the front of the restaurant open from the bar to the outdoor seating, letting in the hot air.  The food could have been the best food and service ever but sweating during the entire meal just made the experience mediocre.  I had carpooled with a friend so leaving was not an option.  The service was very good; attentive and efficient.  We ordered edamame with the hot spicy sauce on the side.  I ordered chicken satay.  The presentation was very pretty and appealing.  The sauces served with the chicken were spot on; tasting very similar to what I typically get at Thai restaurants.  The chicken was served skewered, but it lacked seasoning I'm accustomed to on satay ordered at local Thai restaurants.  It was good, but not nearly as flavorful as satay I've ordered at Thai restaurants.  It was slightly disappointing as I was expecting curry flavor.  I've been at this location only twice since it has opened as the menu never really excited me.  It features a lot of sushi; I rarely eat sushi and when I do it's only the cooked variety.  The place is a local hang out, typically packed during dinner/happy hour time.  I'll leave it for them, or I'll patron here only if others in my party wish to dine here.  Otherwise, I'll be moving on."}
{"text":"I have really only come here for Happy Hour and it has always been a good time ~!!! HH is only offered at the bar area, patio or the sushi bar.. and it is one of the few places that offer HH on daily basis~  Some must haves for me are the chicken lettuce wraps, calamari & the pizza. We also like to get margaritas on the rocks.. I'm not a fan of the sushi but everything else is delish!  If you are not going for happy hour then definitely try the macadamia nut chicken.. mmmm The service is always friendly! Last time our server was Jenny and she was AMAZING~!!!   HOT TIP: HH all day on Sunday~!!! what?!!??"}
{"text":"It seems management has told the sushi chefs to exercise portion control. We were served a roll that had so little of the spicy tuna that the end pieces were all rice. Fry's fresh sushi counter serves better rolls! And it's less expensive!!"}
{"text":"Really disappointed. My sushi arrived 10 minutes after my friend's lunch came. Portion size of the hand roll and the Ikura was half what it used to be here. What's up, Kona? This used to be my favorite place to go. :("}
{"text":"Got into AZ and needed to grab a few drinks and some food before heading out to the party scene so my friends decided to try the Kona Grill. We got there in time for their reverse happy hour... which I was really excited for. The 3 of us ordered the margarita flatbread, potstickers, voodoo roll, spicy shrimp roll, lettuce cup and avocado eggrolls along  w 2 rounds of drinks and the bill only came out to be $50! Super cheap!...which usually equates to awesomenesss... right?  Wronnng.. we definitely got what we paid for.. the drinks were weak and the food wasn't particularly tasty  with the exception of their avocado eggrolls& margarita flatbread... everything else was subpar.   Nevertheless, the service was good, atmosphere was nice and parking was abundant (="}
{"text":"I had a gift certificate, so I had to try it. My mother and I both didn't like the food. We got two sushi rolls, 1 miso, and edamame. The edamame's were overcooked and hard. The miso soup had very salty broth and the sparse, tiny cubes of tofu were reminiscent of the marshmallows in the Swiss Miss hot chocolate packs. My sushi roll was ok. It was the rice I swear! My mother makes sushi and she makes sure the rice is \"sushi\" rice, so it doesn't fall apart and is wet. I wouldn't rush back, even though I live across the street, it's not worth it."}
{"text":"Awesome happy hour!  Hard to find a table though because it's so popular!  The BBQ chicken pizza is $6 and is a full pizza that is very filling for two people. The calamari and California rolls are above average!!"}
{"text":"We tried to find a place at the bar for happy hour, but it was packed solid with people.   We sat at the sushi bar where we proceeded to have some sushi and the pear-chicken-cranberry-walnut salad.   Everything was delicious and fresh.     Shout out to our sushi chef from Mexico.   Very nice guy, hard working, and knows his sushi.   Give him a raise!"}
{"text":"I still haven't found a favorite sushi place in the Phoenix area yet, but this one is my go-to on Saturdays for lunch. Kona has a \"happy hour\" lunch, where select sushi rolls and other dishes are half-price!    Kona is at Scottsdale Fashion Square in Scottsdale, across from Starbucks and The Yard House. On the weekends I prefer to mosey up to the half-in, half-out bar upstairs on the patio and enjoy lunch. The dining room downstairs is nice also. The service has been great nearly every time I've been. So far my fave rolls are the Vegas, Bama, Voodoo, Crab Special, and the good ol' standbys, California and Philly.   If you're going on Saturdays and plan to sit at the bar or on the patio, I suggest arriving before noon -- very crowded after that."}
{"text":"Great food, Good Times = 50% off baby for some items. The seating for happy hour is limiting esp. during reverse happy hour. We normally go at 11p and it's packed. Sometimes we have to set outside in the cold to partake in the cheap goodness :).  The pizza's are on point esp. the 5 spice BBQ pizza. Sometimes the servers are a little slow with the refills.   Overall it's a great place to hang with friends."}
{"text":"Super great food......as usual. Happy hour menu is excellent. Come with the gang or with your favorite someone (Tess). Always happy at Kona Grill."}
{"text":"Not bad,  Not bad.....  1.  Ambiance - Large place, dark setting, which is very nice and makes it a bit cozy, given it's size.  Good place for business meetings or even date.  2.  Front Desk Reception - All very nice, reservations and crowd control. Makes it very cool.  3.  Food - Asian/Hawaiian style and very nice. Whether the sushi, the rolls, or anything on the menu, it is all good.  4.  Comparable - If you want real Hawaiian food, t here are many other places to go, but most of the other places are more, family style and more like hole in the wall places.   5.  Wow Factor - This place has it. If you need it , go here, and the food is okay too."}
{"text":"MY FAVORITE Happy Hour (food) Menu!!  The calamari, the bbq chicken pizza, the sushi rolls, and the sliders are the best choices!  The Happy Hour prices are great too!  Sometimes it does get pretty noisy, but it's a fun place to go to watch a game and hang out with friends.  To be honest, I'm not a huge fan of the happy hour drink menu... Their cosmos make me sick, they're far too sweet, the wine doesn't ever seem like that good of a deal, nor do the saki bombs.  But the food is great!!!"}
{"text":"The manager is incredibly rude. We were sitting on the patio and the table we're at happens to have no lights.   Our amazing waitress rolled up the shade for us, so we could have some light from the street lights and the manager comes out and rolls it back down. We asked her why we couldn't have it up, and instead of being professional and explaining that it's a policy or whatever, she starts arguing with us that there have been complaints, even though we didn't see her addressing anyone on the patio with their \"complaints.\"  She also failed to pin it, so the shade kept flowing in the wind almost hitting people who walked by and the people at our table.  Food was great and our waitress was incredible. Corporate needs to deal with the managers customer service skills, though.  Edit: got a message from another customer who was sitting a few tables away from us who said the same thing happened to them!"}
{"text":"Best Happy Hour in town! Must try the potstickers, sliders, & flatbread. Customer service is always on point. This place gets PACKED, be sure to snag a table out in the patio quick!"}
{"text":"Miso sea bass, macadamia chicken both excellent, apps were so-so, service was slightly above ok...downside, my wife found huge spider in bathroom while pants were down. Not so good ending. So probably won't be back,  she hates spiders!"}
{"text":"For my Vegas locals who remember the pre-remodeling Kona, while service and food was never their forte (IMO), at least their happy hour was good, not amazing, but not bad either. We just went recently and the place is nowhere near as packed as it used to be, food became even more subpar to what it used to be, and forget about service. Happy hour, took a waitress 10+ minutes to get our drink order and the place was EMPTY. Drinks come, we ordered a bottle of sake.. she brought ONE cup. Food came by and now its 20 minutes late. Let me remind you the place is EMPTY and HH is from 9 to 10. Prices used to be 5 bucks, now 8.5.. its sad because the place looks good but everything else is just not up to par."}
{"text":"I don't normally go on yelp and review but after being here last night and seen a group of very rude young women harass the manager of this place I felt my two cents were needed .  We were on the patio last night luckily because you have shades that come down and block the wind unlike the keg and other places for happy hour at one point a group of ladies wanted their shade up because it was dark while the sun is down and you're outside of course it's dark but nobody needed that extra wind blowing on them so the manager went over and tried to explain the reason that they were down and I saw the girls keep arguing with her then purposely taking out their phone telling the other person that they're going to bad yelp her .   I agree  that customer service is very important that being said you have to take care of all of your customers not just the request of one table that can affect other people I know as an employee you have to be as nice as you can no matter how rude people are and I witness your manager been as nice as she could considering as rude as those ladies were . We will continue to come to Kona for happy hour because of your staff and because of how courteous all your managers are ."}
{"text":"Amazing food & drinks! It's a little pricy but the quality of the food makes it worth it! I had 2 different salmon sushi rolls & they were both delicious! I also had the tomato bisque to start... strange combo I know, & it was so good!  My mom had the Macadamia crusted chicken breast... so bomb! The sauces make it!!!  Chicken satay is really good too!  Fresh fish was a Lemon Snapper & was really delicious & super fresh tasting!  We finished dinner with desserts... Key Lime pie & Carrot Cake, both huge portions & super good!  Cocktails were really good too! Totally recommend this place!"}
{"text":"The sushi is alright. I like going here for their happy hour :) I usually get a Kirin ichiban and the draft beers are 4.5$ and sake bomber is 8.5$. Pretty good prices. Happy hour is till 7pm. I like this location because there's santan mall next Kona Grill and you can walk around if you got too lit. Top Golf is also within walking distance. The food is alright. Not the best sushi but it will do.   Note: check in and you can get a free sushi roll or appetizer with a purchase of an entree"}
{"text":"Let's keep it short and sweet and right to the point.  Excellent and attentive service. Adequate portion sizes.  Salads are excellent, particularly the chopped salad with chicken. One of the best ever!!  Calamari was excellent. Lightly fried. Excellent dipping sauce.  Sushi out of this world.  Rest of the food also very good.  Recommended place to eat."}
{"text":"Getting off early means one thing - HAPPY HOUR!!  And that doesn't happen very often, so I love to take advantage of the cheap eats and atmosphere that happens during these brief few hours.  We arrived around 5 pm and waited a good while to score a table on the patio.  We thought we were in luck when a group of ladies said they were leaving once their friend returned from the restroom.  Well, she must have fell in because it was a good 15 minutes before they did finally leave.  At this point, our total wait time was 45 minutes long.  We were hungry and got our hands on a menu quick!  All food was $5 and under!  With our party of three, we got started on a few items:  * Atlantic Roll \"Baked salmon with motoyaki sauce and cucumbers, topped with tempura flakes and eel sauce\" ($3) - Our waiter said it was his favorite and I'm not usually one for cooked fish in my rolls, but I still said okay.  It was good, not exceptional though.  Came in eight pieces, which is great for sharing!  * Spicy Tuna Roll \"Chopped tuna mixed with spicy motoyaki and cucumbers\" ($3) - Again, pretty basic and decent and 8 pieces too.  * Kona Calamari \"Served with a spicy aioli dipping sauce\" ($4.50) - A pretty generous order, great for sharing.  * Sweet & Spicy Shrimp \"Lightly battered shrimp tossed in a sweet and spicy chili sauce, served on a bed of a daikon\" ($4.50) - Pretty tasty and surprisingly generous in this order.  * Chicken Satay \"With cabbage slaw and sweet hoisin dipping sauce\" ($4.50) - Came with four skewers, and a nice slaw to get your veggies from.  A bit dry on the chicken, but enjoyed by others.  * Avocado Egg Roll \"Sun-dried tomatoes and red onions, with a honey-cilantro dipping sauce\" ($4.50) - Two egg rolls cut in half, and tasty too.  * Kahuna Sliders \"A trio of beef sliders seasoned with onions and thyme, topped with Swiss and cheddar cheese\" ($4.50) - The Husband enjoyed these so much that he requested another order.  They were pretty good, cooked at medium rare as requested and yummy little things.  The meat was pretty moist and the melted cheese on top made them perfect as a few bites.  They also came with thinly sliced fried onions strings.  * Edamame ($3) - Soybeans that were lightly salted throughout the beans, not just on top.  We didn't even get a chance to try any of their pizzas at $5 each since we ordered so much.  Service was surprisingly good during happy hour.  Christian was attentive, even when the other staff brought our food out, he was quick to come over to make sure it was all okay and everything was in order.  He checked on us often for more drinks and food and we never had to look for him during our entire time there.  Once we got our order in, food came out in timely manner and we were quite pleased.  (Sometimes it seems service gets a bit slack during happy hour, when the pace should be more upbeat.  And it was definitely moving around here.)  Happy hours are Mondays through Fridays: 3 to 7 pm Reverse happy hours are Mondays through Thursdays: 9 pm to 11 pm Fridays and Saturdays: 10 pm to 12 am  HH is only available in the lounge and patio areas and seats are self-service.  So it can definitely feel like there are hounds on you when you're hanging out there because people are definitely waiting for tables here.  They have discounted drink specials during happy hour too, just be sure to ask.  We took advantage of their $6.50 Sake Bombs and $3 Ladies Margaritas.  (They weren't skimping on the alcohol in my margarita, I could taste and feel that stuff right away!)  You can easily understand why this happy hour is busy.  And there are some guests who stay there all evening long, it makes for interesting people watching!  Side note: Restrooms are in the back left hand corner.  Don't go to the right side corner because you'll end up in the kitchen."}
{"text":"Honestly, I don't understand why there's so much hype about this place. There are WAY more better sushi locations all around the valley that have bigger portions and actually have taste. Also, I recommend asking the waitress if the iced tea options have any sugar or not. The passion fruit iced tea I got was nasty. If I ever have to visit this place again, I'm skipping the sushi. Super disappointing."}
{"text":"I've been to the newly remodeled location twice since it's reopening and both times the service was ok. Both times we sat at the bar and the bar staff was fine but the food took too long. The first visit I requested 2 of the same rolls, 1 tempura and one not. After 45 mins, they both came out tempura. I said that's ok as I was starving. I gave them the benefit of the doubt since they had recently opened and probably experiencing glitches. About 2 weeks later we returned and again I ordered my same 2 rolls same way.....I don't even know how much time had passed but long enough to ask the server to please check on my rolls bc now it's not ok. Both rolls came out....not Tempura. I was annoyed now so the female manager came over and asked me what the problem was and I showed her. She said \"We're too busy to tempura the rolls so I've asked the Sushi chef to not fry them anymore\". I was completely shocked and in disgust with her idiotic answer and manager behavior. That's fine as that area offers plentiful dining options and happy hour choices"}
{"text":"Had pot stickers there. They were lukewarm on the inside. We also had the Flatbread with apples, figs and brie. That was very tasty.  I thought  overall it was fair at best."}
{"text":"Stopped in tonight with some friends for dinner. It was my first time there and I have to say, I was really likely the quiet atmosphere. So many places have music so loud that you have to shout over it to even be heard at your table.  So right away, loving that.  We all split an appetizer and were recommended the avocado roll. Now I was a little skeptical but this was actually really good. It's sorta like guacamole inside an wonton wrapper and fried. But the honey cilantro sauce was just awesome.    After, we decided to split some sushi rolls. Tried the Coconut Shrimp, Sunshine, Spider, Las Vegas, Shrimp Tempura Naruto, and Wave. It think my favorites were the Sunshine and Coconut Shrimp but to be honest, I really didn't have any I disliked.   Everything tasted fresh and was tightly rolled. The rolls were a little more than I normally pay but they were some of the best I've had here.   Friends each tried a couple of cocktail which were very yummy and I'd suggest whatever the strawberry and basil one is. It was a hit.  Over all, great meal. Expect to spend though. There were 1 app, 6 rolls, 5 mixed drinks and a glass of wine for about 120 total. Still, I think it was worth it. Totally plan on going with my husband sometime."}
{"text":"This place just gave us a ridiculous experience. Let me preface this saying the service was alright, definitely not great and not overly sucky. We came at 8 which gave us an hour to order and eat. But every thing was such a disaster it took a lot longer than that. I'm allergic to sesame, which fine, is no one's fault. BUT. I chose a plate and asked the waiter to make sure that there was only sesame seeds and omit those please. He comes back and tells me anything with a sauce has sesame in it. \"even the Italian dishes?\" yes even the Italian dishes. So he comes back with a gluten free/vegetarian menu. I pick a pasta. I'm told they don't make that menu item anymore. Jesus. Ok. I wanted something hot but I guess I'll have sushi even though I don't eat fish. I've had other restaurants take a veggie roll and stuff some strips of grilled chicken in it to replace the fish. Can kona oblige? Nope! Well. Waiter comes back tells me that actually the shrimp penne is edible. So I order this, asking to add asparagus and mushroom. I was told they don't have asparagus (but asparagus is in every freaking sushi roll). Also this plate was way more expensive than anything else I tried to order, but fine. I'm starving and will take what I can get. So finally we order our food. My date orders some sushi and sashimi. Waiter comes back 15 minutes later and tells us there isn't any of the eel sashimi he orders. Replaces that was octopus. Plates are given to us for sharing. We split the plates- but there's something disgusting on my hand when i do that. Turn the plate over and there's a huge mound of stuck on food. Ugh. Go to wash my hands. Looks nice in the bathroom initially, except there's literally paper towels every where on the floor. Come back, Get new plates. Hardly looks cleaner. Food finally comes out. It's the weakest looking sushi rolls I've ever seen, and I don't even eat sushi. They were skinny and short, barely looked like they would do damage to an appetite. I got a spoon and chopsticks to eat my penne with..which is questionable. Never got offered a fork, had to ask. No napkins were supplied. I'm stewing and lost my appetite. Apparently the sushi all tasted like vinegar and lemon juice. My pasta was edible (once I received a proper utensil), but the extra mushrooms I ordered somehow translated to literally one half of a white button mushroom being thinly sliced to somehow permeate my whole plate. Something that annoyed me is that after all these mess ups, a manager never came to check on or apologize to us. Check comes, and we are charged for every damn thing. Not a discount for the struggle, or the gross plates, or not having anything we wanted to order, nothing. Oh, and I was charged extra for my ONE mushroom (if it was that much). A bill of 100 dollars not even worth 30 honestly. If you want to be a ritzy special looking restaurant in Scottsdale charging freakin 20 bucks for a 99cent worth plate of pasta, 15 plus for a dinky roll of sushi, AND make a dining experience such a struggle like this, you're out of your damn mind. Never ever ever ever ever ever ever EVER again. *deep inhale*  Upsides: date said the beer was fine."}
{"text":"Ooooo.  Tried this one after they opened and got food poisening.  Won't go back...  I know its hip and tons of people like it.  Just not for me."}
{"text":"yummm sake bombs for happy hour anyone??"}
{"text":"Great drinks with fresh ingredients. Wonderful happy hour. Get there early and sit on the porch. Great service and great for people watching."}
{"text":"I always have a fantastic time here! Employees are always fun, energetic, and seem to enjoy what they do. Everyone is attentive even during happy hour. I love seeing that even the managers on duty get involved in helping with customers. It says a lot about the service they want to provide."}
{"text":"I sat at the sushi bar for five minutes and no one even acknowledged me so I went back to the hostess station asked to be seated at a table so I could get waited on.  Waitress showed up took my order but I haven't seen her since then I've asked for water to drink, not sure why I'm being ignored other than maybe it's staff change. Usually the service is good at this location but I'm not having much luck this visit!  I complained to the manager, he apologized and would not allow me to pay the check. I appreciated his gesture and will return when in the Chandler area!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour. Twiggy works the bar and is the most fun. My wife and I love coming here whenever we can. The bar area is large and it's great for summer afternoons."}
{"text":"Great happy hour. Staff is friendly and sushi is great. Local vibe is definitely there. Love this place."}
{"text":"Tuna tower, pork tenderloin, cucumber ahi salad, macadamia shrimp roll and yamada roll = $72.00 The place is clean dining area to kitchen and bathroom. Service is very fast and friendly. Food is spectacular! I really enjoyed the macadamia shrimp roll the most. The Tuna tower is quite filling as small as it looks.  I didn't give them 5 stars because I think the food was overpriced by $5.00. The rolls had about 5 to 6 slices which to me by most other sushi spots would be considered a half roll. The pork tenderloin dish had about 6 or 7 slices of  pork tenderloin . A huge helping of mashed potatoes and sprinkle of bak Choy and shoe string potatoes. It was more potatoes than meat still everything on the plate was yummy! I didn't care too much for the sweet and spicy sauce on the yamada roll it overpowered everything else in the roll and it tasted like I was eating a lumpia. Overall the food, service and establishment is awesome. I don't think I'll be back though as the pricing isn't right enough to frequent."}
{"text":"Will probably never return .   Waitress new... but she did great ...   Sushi rolls were not good . Sent one back... isn't this place known for sushi ?!!!   Manager was great . .. did a great job !!!   End results .... food just not good.  Maybe need new cooks .... fresh fish????"}
{"text":"Went for happy hour and it was great.  Sat outside and had the potstickers, poke, and edamame.  All really great.  Service was excellent."}
{"text":"Take advantage of the happy hour prices. The sushi rolls are good. The chicken lettuce wraps are good. The sliders were pretty much the size of regular burgers @ 2 for $6.75 with French fries! The decor (waterfalls) are nice too."}
{"text":"Man the happy hour was great! The bar tender was from Bay area and made it that much more enjoyable! Definitely have to try the sangria's"}
{"text":"So I am back after four months and the restroom looks great now! Gotta love when restaurants listen to Yelpers!    Happy hour is great here but the bathroom (I've only been in the women's) is a mess! Always toilet paper everywhere and full trash cans but also DUST! On the ceiling, the vents, the flowers, the chandeliers and especially these spiky balls on the wall! Very unappetizing!"}
{"text":"Good place to stop if you are hungry and want a bite at the mall. The servers are good and the service is fast."}
{"text":"Went there for a tweetup event.  Nice location. Parking garage is a bit far from the actual restaurant, but whatever. At least they didn't require valet.  The tweetup took place on the back patio, which was reserved for the event. Really, REALLY nice layout on the patio. The inside looked pretty nice, but I didn't pay a lot of attention.  Half-price happy hour was fantastic! $4 brew whose name I can't recall, $5 personal pizza, with ANDOUILLE SAUSAGE (FTW!) that was delicious (despite being curiously named the Kona), and pretty good coffee for $2.50.  I'd go back here in a second for a nice dinner date or client meeting. (If I had clients)  The staff was MOSTLY attentive, but there were a lot of people present. I'll ignore that aspect for the time being.  Can't yet say I'd HIGHLY recommend as I have only sampled the lighter faire, but I would recommend this place to those looking for something in the North Valley."}
{"text":"We decided to try Kona Grill it's been 6 months, the service sucked including the management, but today was a much better experience so I hope this will continues. I had the cucumber salad and the chicken chili soup and that was really good. Keep up the good work and we will keep coming back."}
{"text":"This is perhaps the single most overrated place I've been to in Las Vegas.  I'm not sure why it's packed all the time except that it has a nice atmosphere and a great location. Was not impressed with the sushi ,the pizza, nor the drinks.  They had some gals walking around giving out beer - that was cool eye candy but I can go to about 1,000 places locally for that. Don't get it - prices aren't great either.  It is a nice happy hour place since the atmosphere is really cool.  But just not understanding the big appeal."}
{"text":"WORST service ever takes forever to get the food and when u finely get it u regret putting it in your mouth!!! U  think talking to the manger will speed up things didn't change anything!   The only good thing about this restaurant is the appearance!   Definitely not stepping a foot there!"}
{"text":"Happy hour was great! Good appetizers! Had the bbq chicken flatbread! Can't complain! Good atmosphere for after work drinks...have the games on so all I have to do is enjoy my Sam Adams and sir back! I would def come back!"}
{"text":"When you come here you have to keep this in mind \"im going to an Americanized Asian food/ bar, I know not to expect the best quality sushi or food\". If you come in thinking this way then I think you're gonna enjoy your time here.  I came here for happy hour and they have a pretty good menu with a variety of food and drinks. Regular rolls are 4.50. Apps are around 8 and special rolls at 10 bucks. We sat in the rooftop bar so it gets pretty hot but it's covered and they have mist fans blasting in all corners.   I thought the service was pretty good. Happy hour is a busy time but our server was there for the basics. Getting you water, refilling your water, taking your order and getting your check. That's all I really need.   I had the potstickers which was really good!  Crispy with a hearty pork filling. The bama roll is good as well. I enjoyed it though there wasn't much fresh fish. The spicy tuna roll was the only thing I didn't like. There was no flavor, it wasn't spicy and the tuna tasted a little fishy.   Overall happy hour is great and I'll be back."}

{"text":"Always a great experience at Kona Grill. Took my two kids there today for their last day of school lunch celebration my kids absolutely love Kona Grill, and believe me they are picky eaters but they always find something on the menu at Kona. My son's favorite is there fried calamari absolutely delicious my daughter and I both love any kind of sushi. Today was super impressed by a new item on the menu the pepper tuna tataki sushi roll with lobster in the center it was the bomb. Always have exceptional service lunch or happy hour even dinner never ever had a bad experience here and have been coming to this location for over 6 years"}
{"text":"Food was 4 stars, service 2.  Our server didn't write our order down and gave me the wrong entree as well as forgetting my soup.  I didn't come here to test your abilities to memorize things, I came to get the food I ordered.  The food was good and I don't like to complain, and I was hungry, so I just ate it after informing our server and receiving apologies.  On our way out I saw our server taking orders by memorization with another table.  Making mistakes is one thing, but not learning from them is another.  This is the second time in a week I have had a server try to memorize an order while eating out only to deliver the wrong food.  Not sure where this trend is coming from, but it needs to end.  You have pens, you have paper, use them."}
{"text":"AN UPDATE  SUMMARY   I reviewed this locale back in 2011. It was excellent then and has been a fav place for me for happy hour and meals for yrs. I am very happy to report that this place is even BETTER now after its renovation, inside and out, complete with an addition of a bar/lounge on the 2nd fl terrace, accessible by stairs and elevator. The 2nd fl even has its own restroom.   RATING: 5 Star for its new renovation; excellent food/drink offers, friendly and efficient service!  :-)   Go enjoy!   DETAILS YOU CAN SKIP  I had been out of town since Jan 2016 and just got back in town over a week ago. Last Sat, I came here for happy hour after a long walk around town and was totally blown away by this newly renovated Kona Grill!  I had a fabulous HH experience, and will surely be back soon for more, yes, for lunch and dinner, too!  Specifically, this completely renovated locale (re-opened in March) has:   1. An expanded beautiful dining area, patio, bar counter and sushi bar  2. An additional bar/lounge and restroom on the 2nd fl with elevator and stair access. The bar counter has 2 gigantic tv's. Most tables up there have a view. Yes, it has its own restroom.   ONE MINOR IMPROVEMENT NEEDED  This afternoon, although we could get the router signal, we WERE NOT ABLE TO CONNECT TO THE INTERNET! I was told by fellow customers that the Internet connection that day was sporadic at best.   05/28/16"}
{"text":"Came here out of convenience and their happy hour menu looked promising. My friends and I were seated right away and our waitress was quick to get us some water.   The happy hour menu is pretty extensive -- great variety and even better prices! Here's what we ordered:  - Atlantic roll: this roll has baked salmon in it and it was only $4.50!  - crab crunch roll: your basic imitation crab mix and cucumber roll  - portobello mushroom and goat cheese flatbread: comes with mushrooms, which wasn't listed in the description on the menu  Overall, the meal was okay. Nothing stood out to me. The flatbread was dry and underwhelming. The sushi rolls were pretty basic and tasted alike. The entire meal came out to ~$23 for 3 sushi rolls and 1 flatbread. You can't beat that price!"}
{"text":"Meat eaters feel free to disregard. Now on to the vegan review.   I started off with eating it on the gap from the rug and tile conversion. The hostess was laughing at me just after the threshold. Ominous? I sat at the bar waiting for some one to finish their story before being served. Less than five minutes waiting like, dude. I'm hungry. Feed me.   Miss soup, $4.5 with great cloud of miso and assorted seaweed chunks gives it a real bite. Exquisite. There's a huge chunk of tofu and on further inspection it has two knife indents that don't actually sever my globby bits of protein. Poor guy. He just wanted to be three even cubes instead of some long tendril.   Vegetarian roll $6.5 for five pieces. What? That's like more than a dollar per rice and veggie. It promised yamagobo but it tastes like pickled carrot. There is a giant piece of asparagus that tastes like wood taking up my roll. It's chewy and inedible had to spit out discreetly. I'm still trying to figure out who cut these rolls. Ginger and wasabi are served with it so it's fine.   Cucumber Salad for 4.5 is a cup of salad. It's divine but really small. It's pickled just right, full of sesame seeds and colour making it both vibrant and presentable. And what is that? Is that crab. Oh come on. Why didn't you tell me there was meat in this?   That's it I'm out. Check please."}
{"text":"I've been to a bunch of kona grills. And I gotta say, their dishes are great. Their drinks are great. But the service is very hit and miss. Order drinks at the bar is easy. As far patio seating goes it's awkward when you go to the restroom and see your server is just chatting up another co worker. Aw sweet. Team building. Hey I'm over here thinking that my friend's order is under vegetarian and comes with a ton of immitation crab. To explain, immitation crab is cod. What did you think it was? Tofu? My wine Wednesday was full price. I had a talk with the shifty guy like dude, you said it was half price. We asked prior. You think I wouldn't notice? Poor choice of taste. Let's just say that will be reflected in the tip.   I digress, the five spice tuna is superb, as with the other chef creations.  I've had them all but the two super spicey ones. Still working up the nerve for that. I've had every roll here and soups and salads now. All of their food is well prepared. Honestly I'm just confused as to why, why does the server take my order and then the bids boy bring out my order. I want to tip that guy who is doing all the work. Not that girl sitting in the back chatting for ten minute intervals before checking back on my wrong tab. But hey, food is always good. Last time my waitress was great. She remembered our diets and cared enough to get us their secret menu (yes they have that)."}
{"text":"Great service, delicious food and fast. My husband had a fresh fish that was really good and I had a chicken salad that was absolutely delicious. The manager named Will kept an eye on the whole room.  Will come back here again!"}
{"text":"DO NOT COME HERE UNLESS YOU WANT HORRIBLE SERVICE, SALMONELLA, and perhaps A SIDE OF OLD REUSED FOOD.  Intro: Coming here for lunchtime, we were greeted warmly.  That ends the only pleasant experience I had here thus far.  From the get-go, the server had an air of indifference around her, as if she didn't care about her job.  The way she treated myself and those in my party was as if we were the last people on her shift, and whatever needs may come before her would befell deaf ears.  When asked about certain menu items, the server was not clear in describing what was in each one.  Not only that, the food and drinks took forever to come.  We'll get to that later.  Service: -lack of service -server was disinterested in her job and showed it through her lackadaisical and indifferent demeanor -Slow in delivery of food and drinks -Never came to refill, and only when we sat for 40 min and raised our hands for the check did she come by to ask \"what else would you like\". As if she ever cared.  Food: -flat and tasteless soft drinks.  I even switched to ice tea, which was served warm and reused. -sushi: small and completely overpriced.  Not only did I feel ripped off, because the portions were barely enough to feed a preteen female, but the actual meal consited of 6 tiny california rolls each measuring 0.75 inches in diameter.  I myself weigh 130 lbs and am 5'10\".  That's saying quite a lot. -messed up our order.  A person in my party requested 2 rolls of spicy tuna.  She came back with 1 roll of spicy tuna and 1 roll of california roll. -When asked what she would do with the california roll, the server stated, quote on quote, \"we reuse the sushi\".  I reported this to the Arizona Department of Health Services afterwards.  Conclusion: -Will not come back here again. -Highly DO NOT recommend coming here."}
{"text":"2nd time in a row now that the bartenders have been  rude and abrasive for no apparent reason. I didn't have my id which is understandable, so I took the liberty in sitting at a table to order a few food items off of the happy hour menu. My girl friends however, wanted to sit at the bar and have a shot and a martini. We had JUST ARRIVED. The bartender was not only rude, but was also discriminating against my gfs by refusing to serve them shots after he had already served them one round of martinis. They were not intoxicated by any means. We JUST GOT THERE.   Managers, Janet and Ryan, were summoned and didn't do anything about the situation and instead decided to argue for at least 5 min over reasons we still don't understand. I'm just trying to order some food and my friends were just trying to have a good time but they got denied of their time. Even the group of older gentlemen sitting at the bar agreed that the service we received was uncalled for and discriminating. I have nothing else to say other than...  My server Nicole, on the other hand, was a delight. I had no qualms with her!! Thanks Nicole, for putting my order to-go considering my gfs were denied service."}
{"text":"Susan 1 and I popped by Kona after being disappointed by City North and its ghost town appeal. I've been to other Kona locations before so I'm really familiar with their menu. I was in a huge sushi mood so we ordered a few plates of sashimi and a few different rolls. The sashimi was extremely fresh-a delight to me being in a landlocked state! Yum! The service was ok, it could've been better seeing that there was only one other table filled but we enjoyed the time to just chat and catch up."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots at Fashion Show Mall! Prices are reasonable, they have a great happy hour menu for drinks sushi, and other small plates! The ambiance and decor are some of my favorite, fish tanks, TV's in every part of the restaurant, just great stimulating, high quality decor. The value here is exceptional if you're looking for a reasonable strip fare option that won't break the bank. They also have an awesome outdoor patio and bar seating that is great for days with good weather! Don't forget to take advantage of their free appetizer with a check-in on Yelp too!!!"}
{"text":"I am writing to recognize one of the Kona Grill's Staff who went out of their way, above and beyond, or just down right exceeded expectations. :)  Her name is Tai and if you have the opportunity to share her energy you won't be disappointed.  Tai went out of her way to help me to fill my water bottle while she was very busy.  Her ability to make me feel important was an awesome experience.   Next time you are at the Kona Grill, Scottsdale, ask the hostess for Tai."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I are regulars here for happy hour. I love the bloody Mary's and the sushi is usually pretty good. On occasion it's not the best but we love sitting outside and the atmosphere. We also love the angry edamame. Service is sometimes slow but not always. Overall we enjoy it."}
{"text":"Always a fan of Kona.  In a sushi restaurant you want a place that moves a lot of fish and therefore has a lot of clout with their suppliers. Kona has got it.  Tuna is always fresh.  Happy hour spicy tuna roll, crab crunch roll and a beer is a great wrap to the work day.  Only issue I have is that HappyHour prices are not available in the dining area.  (Which is usually near empty during HH.   HH is only in the bar or at the sushi bar, which are usually packed.  For this reason I only give them 3 stars."}
{"text":"My favorite happy hour place to go to with the hubby and friends! Their sushi rolls are simply amazing and their drinks and sake bombs never fail. The menu prices without happy hour are also reasonable as well. I always receive great service from the servers and have never had any issues with my food. I am sold :)"}
{"text":"This was the worse dining experience we have had, maybe ever but certainly in the last 12 months.  Food was bad and small quantity. We were seated in the direct sun booth after decking two tables for that reason, bust she was going to close the blinds....guess what.? No blinds on door!  Uncomfortable  and we had out of town guest.  We were told on way home her  fork had food between  its prongs bit too why to same something. I will never go back.  My sushi roll was dry and no taste!  Wrong wine served and SLOW inattentive service."}
{"text":"Solid place to go for lunch. Fair prices.  Great sushi. The checkerboard roll is very very good and has an awesome kick to it.  My girlfriend fell in love with the club sandwich. That matters since she isn't a fan of club sandwiches.  In future trips to Vegas I'll definitely keep this place in mind."}
{"text":"It is happy hour all day Sunday so the BF and I went for it. Keep in mind it is bar or patio first come first serve. Some are half off, some are discounted apps and sushi and drinks ranging from $3ish-7 with most about $6. It was rather busy, but we were able to find a seat and served quickly.   Normally I'm not a roll person and I know that but went with the flow of what is \"recommended\" in reviews. We grabbed one of the specialty rolls - the Voodoo (crawfish mix, avocado, topped w/habanero tuna mix & chili masago) which we got based on the crawfish.It was decent and I like that it's a bit spicy. We also got a crab crunch roll I believe since I happen to like crunchies on things and that was alright. It's good rolls if you like rolls but nothing outstanding about them.   Calamari - this was pretty good. I liked the spicy creamy sauce to go with. I would have liked it a tad crispier, but it was not undercooked or anything.   Avocado rolls - avocado anything I love but the creamy with the crispy egg roll wrapper works for me. This I did like.   Service was decent considering the fact it was a busy and full bar area.   I think it was good for happy hour and I would go again since were in Boca Park a lot. I did see flatbreads that looked great and immediately regret not getting one instead of sushi so next time."}
{"text":"We dined here prior to seeing a movie on a Monday night. We lucked out and were able to check out their Happy Hour.  It is delicious food for an amazing value.   We ordered a couple sushi rolls and the Lettuce Wraps.  We enjoyed everything we ordered.   Their patio is great and even though it was warm out we were able to sit at the outdoor bar due to some great mister/coolers they have.  The service was good even though they were busy.   We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"We've been to Kona Grill a few times to hit up their Happy Hour special.  It runs from I think 3-7 then again from 10-12 weekdays, Saturdays its during the afternoon (I can't recall the exact times), and Sunday it's all day.  I'd have to say that it gets pretty crowded during the Happy Hour times - especially if you're going during the week after work or something.  There's normally open seating at the sushi bar if you don't mind though.  I like it here.  The food is a great value with their Happy Hour pricing.  They have a list of apps at half off and also some other items for 6 bucks... as well as some drinks for half off.  Their food is quality, ambience is great, service is not bad considering how busy it always is too.  I've tried almost all the sushi on their Happy Hour Menu and to me, it's just OK.  Get the wave roll, it's pretty refreshing (I don't think it's a steal at 6 bucks though).  I also like the Crab Crunch I think it's called.  Other than that, I can't think of anything else that jumps off as awesome.   If you are looking for amazing sushi, go to a Japanese restaurant.  My favorite thing, however, is the two burgers for 6 bucks.  They are smaller sized burgers with a side of fries.  The meat is top quality and its its topped off with a bunch of great tasting things.  I like it and order this every time.  I normally like pot stickers, but I'm not crazy about the ones here (my friends think opposite, they like them).  The meat in it is loose and doesn't stick together.  I think that's why it puts me off.  Anyway, the lettuce wraps are good, the calamari is good... everything is pretty good.  Not OMG, but good!  This is definitely one of the more generous happy hour spots in terms of their specials and times that they offer the great deals."}
{"text":"(9-20-17) Stopped in for happy hour with friends. Really great drink specials. Friendly staff. Clean restaurant."}
{"text":"The ultimate spot to chill and grab an appetizer while shopping ..and the outside seating is the best ..the food is always good here I always get the sushi appetizers. .love it"}
{"text":"Continuing on my \"kid free\" weekend, it was Saturday evening and I decided to treat myself to a drink and watch the Dbacks game in the bar here.  The bar is nice and it has a nice patio which was busy but not overly crowded for a Saturday night.  The bar tender was right there ready to take my order.  I asked for the wine list and he presented it and gave me a minute to make my choice.  Ok, they could update the wine list a bit.  I know AZ has some fine local wines and, in my opinion, those should be on the menu as well as a few nice California wines.  Maybe I am just jaded because I am used to some of the finest California wines.  I just thought the list was lacking.  After a glass of wine, I decided to order some dinner.  I had the miso sake marinated sea bass.  It was delicious!!!  It was tender and flakey and had a wonderful flavor.  It was server with fried rice and veggies and both were good, the veggies nice and crisp.  I don't eat like this often so I enjoyed my sea bass and getting to relax watching a baseball game.  The bartender was attentive and asked several times if I needed anything.  I was good.....I had a nice adult beverage in an adult setting which is something I had not done in at least 7 years.  It may be another 7 years before it happens again but this was a great way to spend a \"kid free\" Saturday evening."}
{"text":"Staff aren't too bright, drinks aren't mixed properly, and i think they can do better at communicating."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times with family. The food is good but for some reason we always got sat facing the crowds of people walking around the mall. I have had a few awkward moments where I see people I know shopping and a conversation in the middle of a family dinner happens. So the location is pretty weird, but you can always sit inside, but for some reason we always get placed out on display. Other than that, the food is really good. My brother likes to try a new item every time (lucky for me) so I've tried a couple of things on the menu. The sushi is pretty good, but you can get sushi at lots of places. I was more impressed with the big island meatloaf, the macadamia chicken and the Korean BBQ. I also liked the salmon salad, every entree was cooked really well and was hot when it was brought to the table."}
{"text":"Kona Grill is my favorite place for anything: sushi, good eats, and perfect drinks.   I don't think I have ever been disappointed here. Kona Grill holds itself to such a high standard of customer service and food quality all for a good price.   They have all day happy hour on Sundays. I always get the shrimp lettuce wraps or the sliders which are basically two medium sized burgers cooked your way with a side a fries. All very filling and delicious.   You can never go wrong with the red sake sangria which has fruit at the bottom of the glass. Sake Bombs are always a hit.   My favorite bartender is Emina. She always makes a great Cosmopolitan that is never too light or too strong and comes served filled to the rim!  Atmosphere is perfect for an intimate date or even for bringing a big group of friends.   Don't pass up Kona Grill if you are in the area! The Fashion Square location is also one of my favorites and I am looking forward to the Scottsdale Quarter location that's coming soon."}
{"text":"A disappointing, but well earned 1 star.  Service, service, service. This makes or breaks a business, and the new Kona Grill at Scottsdale Quarter lacked everything that defines service. Let me say that I absolutely love Kona Grill and have been a customer for years at both the High Street and Fashion Square locations.   Our server Alec was kind, but lacked skills and expertise that is usually employed by Kona Grill. He came about 10 minutes after we were seated and took our drink orders. 15 minutes later, our drinks came and a martini which had been ordered dirty and with an olive came straight up and with no olive. After bringing this to the attention of Alec, he sent it back. Another 15 minutes later another martini came, this time dirty and with an olive, but on the rocks? Quite the way to serve a martini.   One of our 2 rolls comes before any of our other meals come and the manager comes to apologize about the martini. I explain what happened and explain that although the martini was served on the rocks, I would drink it anyway. He brings me a final and third martini, dirty and with an olive. We had been here for about 45 minutes now with myself and another person in our party not having their meals (3 total in our group.)  The meals come another 10 minutes later. The quality of the food was good, what you would usually expect from Kona. However, that second roll we had ordered never came throughout our whole visit.   Fast forward to about an hour and a half that we're here, and we ask for our checks. Two appetizers come on the check full price (we came during happy hour) and they charged me for two martinis!   I bring this to the attention of our waiter Alec who then comes back with a revised receipt of $24~. I give him my card, and another 10 minutes later he comes back with a receipt to sign, but now for $31?! I immediately ask for his manager and a different manager comes to our table who then listens to our whole negative experience. He apologizes, comps our food, and we only pay for our drinks.   The manager did the right thing, but I'm a bit concerned about the way this new Kona Grill is being managed and the employees who are hired. It's definitely not the same level of service I have been receiving at Kona Grill the last 4 years, and I most definitely will not recommend this new location for at least another 6-12 months until they get some efficient work flow established.   Corporate and owners of Kona need to pay attention, as I could hear others around me having bad experiences. Scottsdale Quarter is too good to mess up.  I get it is a new location and there are some problems to work out, but this was bad. Kona Grill at Scottsdale Quarter needs some help, quick."}
{"text":"Spur of the moment decision to grab lunch at Kona today. Not a bad choice on a Sunday with all day happy hour. I had never been so figured why not.   Philly Roll: didn't love it, didn't hate it... nothing to write home about. Disappointing for a place that has an actual sushi bar. Maybe I didn't get the right thing? I'm not too adventurous with sushi.  Potstickers: Yes.. yes... and yes. Not sure what it was about these but I probably could have ordered 3 or 4 more plates. When I go back it will mostly be because I want potstickers. Nice size, tasty, nice crunch on bottom and soft on top. Nice presentation. Loved everything about these.  Chicken Satay: Very tasty... the peanut sauce was delicious.  Sat at the bar... nice spot and perfect day today with a bit of a breeze. All in all with couple drinks our bill was only $27 for lunch. Awesome... I'll take that any day."}
{"text":"Not really anything special.  The food was ok.  Actually my chicken was a little undercooked and my husband's sushi didn't taste very fresh in my opinion.  I was expecting really good things based on the reviews and sadly I wasn't impressed.  Maybe we'll try it again another time and have better luck."}
{"text":"Out with Family & Friends and having the Pork Tenderloin, along with Bok Choi & Mash Potatoes.   On my third Heineken and feeling Good"}
{"text":"Happy hour starts at 3:30. Do I need to say anything else? Awesome margs, specialty drinks, sushi, pizza and pasta.  They have a little bit of everything and they're always extremely busy. This is definitely the spot to see and be seen on weekend nights and its mall location makes it extremely convenient.  It's also a fun place to grab a few drinks and maybe an app before going out."}
{"text":"You simply cannot beat their happy hour, for both food choices & liquor.   Seven days a week makes it even more awesome. Great service even when I have been there with a large group.   The regular menu is wonderful as well, but we can't seem to get past the offerings at happy hour."}
{"text":"I would give the food four stars if it was not so over priced. The vegas roll and the poke are yummy. The atmosphere is really nice - big clean fish tanks everywhere, roomy tables, and pleasant wait staff. If you are a sushi connoisseur, you will probably be slightly disappointed.  But if you just go in knowing you are going to pay too much for small portions of yummy food at a mall, you will be happy."}
{"text":"Stopped by for the private grand opening!! Nice set up for the newest location!! 4 large sized TV's over the bar when you walk in and a vast space for the rest of the restaurant. Sushi bar in the back and outdoor patio in the 104 degree weather...red ribbon cut and place will be open in 3 days!! Food amazing with sushi, sashimi and the biggest burger sliders ever!!  Will be exciting addition to kierland!!"}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant with my friend on Friday at 9pm.We found the seats at the sushi bar.We ordered mojitos which are very expensive $9.5 and not good??? Looks like they don't make it fresh just pre-made stuff We waited for them to be brought for 30 minutes. Who is waiting for drinks for that long? Then I order food and some of the orders  never came?Also not a big fun of the loud music. It's not my kind of place"}
{"text":"One of the best happy hours in town. They also have a amazing sushi menu and steak and sake variety.  From flat breads to tacos mini burgers and sushi they got you cover if you have a large groups they have something for everyone. I normally go to the one in boca park and I still haven't tried the entire menu. I would like for them I add mochi ice cream just so when you want a small dessert."}
{"text":"Hot and sticky.... love the vibe of an open air bar, but not during an AZ summer. We opted to sit in the dining room over the bar but it was still pretty warm. :(  I suggested my husband and I try this place because I was craving Asian food.  Beyond sushi, there is little asain on the menu.  I ordered the tacos with pork fried rice and the rice was sticky and hard, like it had been sitting out for a while. My husband got the Cuban sandwich and it was dry.    The food wasn't great, but the customer service was good. Our waitress was nice and attentive. The manager checked in on us and made things right."}
{"text":"I have been eating at Kona Grill since they first opened. The menu has been perfect for my wife and I as I am the meat and chicken guy while my wife loves sushi. The bar with outside patio area is awesome. We love to sit in the patio area during happy hour and just relax . The current manager Ron Youngberg has done an excellent job , the staff is super."}
{"text":"Wow!!!! It's been a while since I've been able to give Kona Grill a 5 star review! I must say the macadamia nut chicken was cooked perfectly and the brownie for dessert, nice and moist!  My biggest compliment goes to Nick Laban (spelling ?) It's not often you get a server who you can tell enjoys what they do and wants to make sure the customer enjoys their dining experience. Nick was very attentive and even joked a little bit to make our experience fun. I had my 14yr old, so fun is always important! Ha! I've been coming to Kona for YEARS and never had a server do the warm hand towelettes after our meal. VERY COOL!! See video!"}
{"text":"It's very disappointing - the service isn't always great. The service is slow and the sushi isn't consistent. I have yet to like the way they cooked the calamari too - it always arrive chewy and hard at times which means it's overcooked! I have had their Mahi-Mahi a few times with pineapple rice. Once again its not consistent. It's either over seasoned and the sauce they use is too much so it gets all over the rice. I prefer the Kona at San Tan Mall better. Although I come here, to the Chandler site, often and gamble what kind of service & food I get....mostly because it's near my boyfriends house but I know what kind of potential they have because I have tasted it."}
{"text":"First off the food was great and filling. Very pricy but good. For 4 people our bill was 160.00 so don't expect an cheap dinner. Staff was readily on hand. Thumbs up ! Our table issues are this. You can not read the menu due to the dim lighting and tiny menu print. Really needs to be updated as I have great eyesight and the entire group has issues. The fryer was also broken so that caused a child meltdown because he couldn't get fries. Once her heard no fries no other food mattered and it made dinner a joy (not). Other than  that Yum"}
{"text":"Good place for happy hour. However,  make sure you go there earlier than later as seating can get slammed. Not my favorite place to go but for hh it's a pretty good deal. Too bad city north doesn't open some more places around here, not much to choose from."}
{"text":"Went there with my family and was satisfied. We just ordered appetizers for all of us to share and it worked out very good. It wasnt too expensive. The atmosphere is nice especially if you eat outside. They have TV's to watch And a nice cool inside. It is very clean and a great place. We got our food in a short amount of time. I will keep going here for an afternoon lunch or an early dinner!"}
{"text":"Kona grill is the best sushi I've ever had. And I get the California rolls and they are awesome and the chicken is very good to."}
{"text":"Go to Kona Grill for their Happy Hour. It can't be beaten for the price point and food portions. Order any of the pizzas or sushi rolls and be sure to take advantage of the drink specials as well. The patio is great to people watch. Just be sure to get there as early as you can to grab a table."}
{"text":"Had a great time at the Kona is Sin City in Fashion show mall. Lewis recommend the Cuban sandwich and it was the bomb. Service was on point also!! Thanks Kona and Lewis."}
{"text":"Late night dinner, showed up about an hour before closing.  Still received great service and the food was excellent.  We enjoyed a Voodoo roll (spicy but very flavorful), spicy tuna, Philadelphia roll and our personal favorite Peppered Tuna Tataki Roll.  We also had a Vegas roll that neither my husband nor I enjoyed which is the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars.  Also, enjoyed one free roll on the house by checking in with Yelp!"}
{"text":"I've been a few times for dinner and group get together but really the best time to come is for Happy Hour on the Patio. Nice large selection of items for Happy Hour and the drinks are pumping out left and right to keep pace.  The patio area has plenty of TV's and seating but it can be a challenge when you gotta get a few tables or chairs together to accommodate your party... one word.. \"HUSTLE\" to get a table!! Be on the look out, ask if people are leaving and grind to get a spot. Worth it in the end to have a good time."}
{"text":"Great happy hour! But very slow and mediocre service! Food was good and comes out pretty fast. Our server took over 15 minutes to drop off the check, and she passed by our table several times before dropping it off. I also waiting 20 minutes to get a drink. Ordered a drink shortly after sitting down (summer ale) about 10 minutes go by when she comes back to say they were changing the cag, okay no problem. Our food came out and I still didn't have a drink, she later came back and said the summer ale was out??? What....I ended up ordering a blue moon which did come out, however we were close to finishing our meals. We asked for our check which also took long. No discount, no apology! The no discount I could careless about ( But it would have been the right thing to do, seeing that I was drink less for 20 minutes)."}
{"text":"If I could give this place less than one star, I would. My family and I had the WORST experience ever in this restaurant. My friends and I frequent the Kona at Scottsdale Fashion Square and we love them! So when we were looking for dinner by our house my dad suggested we go to this Kona, I jumped at the opportunity. BIG MISTAKE.   We walked into the restaurant and after a few minutes were greeted by a hostess. She said it would only be about 10 minutes, which was fine with us, so we waited. About 10 minutes later I looked around and there were several open tables, I figured the servers just needed a moment to catch up, so we continued to wait. However, 20 minutes after we were still waiting... The hostess said she would bus the table and we would be seated shortly. She started busing the table then left to talk to a gentleman, who I am assuming was the manager. After talking to him, she finished busing the table. Looking around the front room; I could see at least 5 open tables. However, we were still not taken to the table she had just finished cleaning off.   After waiting for over 30 minutes she finally took us to our table, where the hostess took our drink order saying our server would be right with us. The server stopped by about 5 minutes later to say she would be right with us. Where we waited for 10 additional minutes for someone to take our order. Needless to say, after spending almost an hour being ignored and not given service we decided they did not want, not did they deserve, our business. We left $5 on the table to cover the soft drinks ordered and left.   The absolute lack of organization and customer service at this location is appalling, and management needs to seriously reevaluate their practices. We will never be back."}
{"text":"Had a reservation, but to take advantage of Happy Hour, we had to sit at bar or outside. Even tho we showed up, restaurant cancelled reservation fee on Open Table since we sat at bar so I lost my 1000-point bonus. Service was very good, but food isn't. Tries to be Asian fusion, but basically expensive sushi knock off. Out of flat bread. Apparently they buy it from somewhere not realizing you can make it with flour water salt oil. Out of clams for 6 weeks due to poor quality from supplier. I cannot recommend this place other than for drinks."}
{"text":"Love the outdoor patio. Sat out there on Sunday with a few girlfriends, had a couple drinks. The bloody mary is HUGE! Great drinks, good prices, and excellent service. I can't remember our waitresses name, but she was a cool chicka. From Chicago, very sweet and totally friendly. Will go back again very soon."}
{"text":"Went for a quick dinner with my wife. Food was very good, the cocktails were exceptional. We were served by Michelle and the service was on point. The design concept is cool I would imagine in the summer when all the windows are open it will be amazing.  I would definitely recommend this to freinds."}
{"text":"Locals hotspot located in the center of the strip now?! WINNING!  Kona Grill has always been a treasured happy hour spot for my best friend and I. Before they remodeled and had an upstairs at their original location in Boca Park! They offer the best drinks and best finger foods to catch up with a friend after a long day at work! With the holidays around the corner I know I'll have a couple more pit spots at this location now.   I came in on a Sunday afternoon it's football season so you know we had to find a spot playing the games. Our servers name was John. My brother had never been here so he was very helpful and detailed about what were the house favorites. We got a couple rolls from their sushi bar. One was the piranha and the other was the shrimp and lobster roll. I could be wrong the piranha roll. We were so hungry I didn't even snap a couple photos like usual. The food was so great that well I couldn't resist. With a yelp check in we got a free appetizer and we got the chicken and shrimp lettuce wraps!!! My personal favorite and my brother also enjoyed it very much! Hands down the best lettuce wraps around. We got an order of Pad Thai that the house split in two for us before we even asked. The service and the food quality and taste couldn't outdo one another. Thank you John for your service and making our Sunday pit stop after a day of shopping great. Oh and they even offer happy hour at this location on a Sunday after 9pm! A MUST TRY FOR ANY LOCAL AND ESPECIALLY IF YOUR A TOURIST."}
{"text":"Love happy hour all day Sunday!  Kids can sit outside or at sushi bar and still get happy hr prices. :)"}
{"text":"I love,love Kona grill and you can't beat that happy hour is all day on Sunday."}
{"text":"Literally just finished our meal, now for the review. First let me say our server was friendly and attentive; however, there were a few mistakes which kind of spoiled the meal for me. I ordered the following: tuna sashimi, a caterpillar roll, and the kona fillet. Fist mistake was that when my tuna came out it wasn't sashimi it was nigiri. Told the server and he fixed it right away. Waited a while and the caterpillar roll never came out, was like fine not a big deal. Here's where I started to get a bit sour I ordered the kona fillet med-rare and it came out med-well. I told the server and he apologized right away.  When the check came out our server said \"I took care of the tuna for you\". I wasn't expecting that at all, I was pleased. We get our check and what he meant was that he took care of the tuna nigiri that came to our table by accident. I figured that would be automatic given I didn't order that dish. So why I'm a little sour is a combination of getting a over-cooked steak on top of thinking the server made it right for us at the end when what he really meant was, he took care of the mistake he made."}
{"text":"The Happy Hour at Kona Grill is definitely hard to beat!  The variety of food specials offered are amazing and there is something for everyone.  Their variety of drink specials is very good.  However, it would be nice if they offered a special on well drinks.   I have also enjoyed dinner at Kona Grill but have often felt very rushed through my meal which is never pleasant.  Their sushi and ahi tuna (cooked rare) is my all time favorite.  The wait staff is professional and very attentive."}
{"text":"Great food and ambiance. They treated me great for Bday. I had the best Carro Cake slice ever, homemade & a mile high.  The food and Happy Hour.   Not A Place for Kids!"}
{"text":"Oh, man. This place is cool. As the website insists, the ambiance is warm and contemporary. The inside is cool and comfortable, and the outdoor seating is nice as well.  The service has always been excellent, and the food? Deee-lish. The edamame is covered in coarse sea salt, just enough to notice the flavor and add a pleasant crunch. We all shared the 18-piece shashimi assortment and a gorgeous 8-piece Rainbow Roll, all authentically prepared and absolutely delectable. Their website omits the prices of their dishes, but they're pretty comparable to any other fine restaurant.They do serve a few standard American dishes, such as breaded pork tenderloin and meatloaf. I haven't tried them, but considering the sushi is mighty fine, I'd be willing to bet their other fare is pretty darn good, too."}
{"text":"I've been to just about every Kona Grill in the valley and for some reason this location seems to fail me every time.  I know this is a chain but how could it be so much worse then the others?! Well tonight Kona, you finally sealed the deal for me!  What sealed their fate you ask? Well I'll tell you....  For starters the service was just okay. Our waiter was polite but food came out very slow. Not a huge deal, I can handle that. Things really started to go down hill when we got our food.   The sushi was clearly not fresh and the miso soup had a funky taste, in fact, now that I think about it, EVERYTHING tasted off but the sushi was by far the worst. The sashimi was incredibly fishy smelling/tasting and was warmer then room temperature (not what you want when eating sashimi) The roll that had asparagus in it was the texture of a stick and I had to choke it down. The seaweed was so chewy I could barely chew through it. I moved on to the next roll hoping it would be more appetizing or at the very least edible. but was just as disappointed that the ingredients were not fresh, had consistency of beef jerky and the spicy mayo aioli tasted sour.   Needless to say that wasn't even the worst part. The worst part was that 3 of the 7 people in our group (myself included) spent the next day violently expelling our dinner. Never again..... :(  Get it together Kona!"}
{"text":"Let's start off by saying I honestly thought this place was a chipotle style... boy was I wrong!! This is my new favorite place ever. My husband and I got a gift card here so we thought, \"let's try it\". We get there and right away like the vibe. The decor, the music, and the staff were all great. We order the chili salmon and it was SO GOOD!!! I told my husband anytime we ever have other children this is the meal I choose to have after!! We also ordered the brownie... uhhh it was huge and heavenly! We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"I am not rating the food quality here. If I were to do that it would get a three. I am rating the happy hour, or should I say multiple happy hours that occur through out the day. I am talking about $3 rolls, $4 drinks, $5 avocado rolls that are to die for. Why pay full price when you can get it at half off? The ambiance is also fun. They have regular happy hour from 4-6:30 (don't hold me accountable to this, but it is somewhere along that) and reverse happy hour after 10pm. This happy hour is available Monday - Friday and Sundays. So if you are looking for some good happy hour snacks at super affordable prices come here."}
{"text":"I have only had food here once, and wasn't anything memorable.  But - if you want to hit up a nice, great ambiance bar with a reverse happy hour before going out. This place is awesome. Try their sake Sangrias! I like white vrs red.. but don't be shy. It is great. And if you are looking for something  a little more manlier... there is always the Sake Bomb!"}
{"text":"Great environment! We've been here once before we saw a movie and came back while we were in town to meet her friends for drinks. Place has been remodeled since our first visit a few months back. Wish we had an appetite when we came so i could have had some of their sushi. All their dishes look amazing here! My girlfriend loves their Raspberry Lemonade Drink. Their Vegas Margarita (not on the menu) is pretty good too!"}
{"text":"How do you not have a blender? Ordered a Piña Colada and got it on ICE, no blender..."}
{"text":"Go for Happy Hour!  I usually don't like chain restaurants, but I do like Kona Grill! I came here a few times and was so surprised the food was so cheap and delicious!  Favorites: +Fried Calamari Love the side sauce!  My bill tab was only $5, unbelievable! I'm not a fan of the sushi here, but for the price, it satisfies you!"}
{"text":"Two words: HAPPY HOUR!!  Happy hour deals at Kona Grill are amazing! Sushi is fantastic, drink deals are awesome and their calamari is amazing!"}
{"text":"Horrific service.  I am still sitting at bar after 20 minutes. Drinks gone, food gone. Nobody checking on us. This is not the first time. It is almost an SNL skit."}
{"text":"Being locals from Las Vegas it's definitely hard to find a server that genuinely cares about your dining experience, rather than flipping tables as soon as possible to make as much money as possible- but our server Layne really did just the opposite of that. He wasn't at all pushy, and he did an excellent job at item suggestions. I am a person of many questions, especially when it comes to food that I'm going to be eating and paying for, & Layne had an answer for all of my curiosities and it really did make my dining experience all the more better. If you ever decide to come to this restaurant please ask to be sat in Layne's section! -- Yasmine"}
{"text":"Really disappointing. This place was highly recommended, but failed to deliver.  Over-priced, and otherwise just a total let-down.   I ordered Ahi and it was supposed to be seared.  It was extremely over-cooked. To the point where the Ahi had almost the same texture as canned tuna.   2 other people in our party ordered Burgers, which were supposed to be Medium.  They were so rare, the cow was still mooing.   Another person in our party, had his entree' mistakenly given away to another party.   While, the manager came over and took the wrong orders off the bill, it was an unpleasant experience, overall.   I would not recommend this place, and would not return based off this experience.   I really wanted to like this place, but the world was against me tonight."}
{"text":"I was really excited and looking forward to try this place out and was disappointed by the lack of customer service. I had a horrible customer experience. We sat there for 10 mins not drinks no service no acknowledgment. Food was nothing special. Definitely will not be going back."}
{"text":"Enjoyed eating appetizers and sushi. Very tasty and well presented. The chef took care of the food and it wasn't just slapped on the plate. Reasonably priced."}
{"text":"This place isn't too shabby. They have decent sushi and other items, but they don't have smoking sections... I mean I know that thing is GOING to pass, but not YET as of this review. The staff is interesting to watch when you drop a piece of edamame on the floor and watch them all seemly race to get it, but it is like a spy race where you aren't supposed to notice, but you totally can and the winner gets a cookie."}
{"text":"Places with enjoyable outdoor seating generally get a 1-star patio bump, and Kona Grill has some nice real estate for dining al fresco. Yes, as with most Las Vegas patios, it overlooks a parking lot, but there is a bit of greenery to shield your eyes. Plus, there is generally some nice auto eye candy in the parking lot.   My first Kona experience was at lunchtime with the parents. Beware of the iced tea. We were all on a flavored tea kick after sipping on some fruity treats at Create and Sammy's, so we swiftly ordered up some of the enticing flavors at Kona. Little did we know that their flavors were delivered in a four-dollar Republic of Tea bottle! We searched the menu and found no indication that this was the deal, or rather un-deal.  $4 and no refills? I suggest sticking to the regular brewed tea.   We all went with the perfect pairings lunch offerings. You pick two from a nice list of options for $8 and change. I chose a salad and the turkey chili. My husband went with some sushi. The salad was okay, but I wasn't a big fan of the over miso'd dressing. I love miso, but it was really overpowering. The turkey chili, however, was yummy. My only complaint is that I wanted more! The sushi looked a little sad. The imitation crab was leaking pink onto the plate. Never a good sign, but my husband seemed happy enough.  I wouldn't say Kona was a knockout experience for us, but there is that patio bump in effect, and the happy hour specials definitely demand a repeat visit."}
{"text":"This is the place to go for \"happy hour\". Great assortment of drinks and menu items at \"happy hour\" prices. The drawback is that it might be hard to get seated during these times, especially for groups four or larger."}
{"text":"We're actually here right now waiting for the rest of our meal, lemme tell you..  Guy with the big beard, Lewis, SUCH a great waiter! Quick to the table, real nice guy, and super entertaining!   Happy Cinco De Mayo!!"}
{"text":"Went here today for happy hour to celebrate a girlfriends birthday.  We had 11 in our party. We found a large table in the newly renovated upstairs part of the bar in the back. The downside there was no fan or misters in this part of the bar.  An oversight that hopefully they will figure out once some one passes out from heat stroke. First day it hit one hundred degrees this year and we were miserable.  We would have moved but there were no tables left to fit our large party. Than there is a middle section upstairs that faces south and closest to Lee's liquor that has an open section in the patio cover.  Those tables had the sun beating down on them.  At least they had some fans and misters. But still looked uncomfortable. If your sitting anywhere near the railing the sun hits you there too. Since the reopening the happy hour menu is more extensive with the food and everything we ordered was good. The drink menu not so desirable. The food came quick but if you ask for extra plates or condiments it takes forever because they have to go downstairs to get it. Our server was hit and miss. Forgot drinks, didn't keep water glasses full (after all we were sitting in the hot corner).  We had lots of plates sitting around after we finished. Forgot to bring drinks. However he was always pleasant. Brought wrong food and forgot to deduct from bill. If there were 1/2 stars I'd give 3 1/2 stars.  I gave 4 stars because of the potential atmosphere if wasn't for the lack of fans and misters and the location is desirable."}
{"text":"Sure it's a chain, but Kona Grill is a step above the rest, IMHO.  I always start with the Tuna Wasabi appetizer.  Their fried rice is just awesome, some of the best I've had.  This appetizer combines sushi (sort of) and fried rice.  I could stop there...it's so yummy.  I've had their pizza, sushi, and desserts as well and I can't say I'm ever disappointed.    If you are looking for an authentic sushi experience, you won't find it here.  Most of the sushi is pretty mainstream.  But it you want to get a great meal and look at a ton of hotties, you can't beat it.  Go for happy hour!  Most cost effective and pretty generous."}
{"text":"Loved my experience here. The restaurant itself is super trendy and has an upper floor patio bar/dining area that I thought was really cool. I came during happy hour and found myself struggling to decide what to eat because there were SO many options to choose from...including sushi!! Decent prices considering the location, friendly staff, and the food was good. I definitely plan on coming back :)"}
{"text":"Do not come here if you handicap and want to order off the happy hour menu, your options for seating is a \"tree stump\" with no actual table (which believe it or not isn't easy when your handicap) or sitting outside and in the middle of winter isn't a very warm place. The service and management working was awful the worst customer service I have received in a long time. Food took over 45mins and all the tables around us moved inside because of it being so cold and the \"heaters\" hardly working. Asked to speak to a manager and the AGM came to the table, when we explained our concerned he told us \"plenty of people are sitting outside\". Poor example of management, service was slow and seems the GM needs to do some training with the team. Won't be going back which is sad since we used to go here very often but since the remodel the service has just gone down hill."}
{"text":"Their happy hour is exceptional. Food is fantastic, service is great (from my few experiences), and drinks are well made. I would definitely give this one a try!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love! This place. It is my favorite place to go for a reasonably priced gluten free meal and they're gluten free menu is huge!!! My favorite waiters are Taylor and Nathan. They usually cocktail outside. The waiters there are really personable which makes the whole experience better! I always get a gluten free chicken with mash potatoes and a Philly roll. Kudos because they have gluten free soy sauce! The ambience is very chill and relaxed. Great for a date night, with friends or whatever you're looking for. Food is AMAZING"}
{"text":"This place was definitely worth the All Day Sunday happy hour! Highly recommend ! Just a little to pricey to visit on a non-happyhour time for me."}
{"text":"Every month, a few Yelpers get together to meet up for a book club, and we try to go to different places each month, so that we can explore all the awesome food and coffee options available in the lovely Las Vegas area.  This past Sunday, we met at Kona Grill, per Stefany V's suggestion, for their all day happy hour!  Kona Grill is located in the Boca Park shopping center, directly across from (are you ready?) a Hipster Emporium.  Location aside, I was pretty impressed.  Happy Hour is ONLY available in the bar areas (sushi bar included) and the patio, not in the regular restaurant.  This was unfortunate, because it was HOT on Sunday.  We sat in the bar, which has AC, but its right next to the open patio area, so it doesn't really stay super cool.   Service was polite and friendly, from the hostesses, to the waiter who told me about the restriction on the HH seating, to our server.    Food was ok!  HH has a decent selection of sushi rolls, appetizers, and flatbreads, along with a few drink offerings, some for $6, some for half off.    I had a Bloody Mary (not on the HH menu, but only $7.50, and a pretty decent size),   From the HH menu, I ordered the crab crunch roll: crab mix, motoyaki sauce, cucumber, tempura flakes, eel sauce.  This was half off for HH, so it was basically $3.75 for a really good sized roll.    I enjoyed this a lot.  I'm not a roll kind of girl...when I do sushi, I do nigiri, and I do AYCE.  Since this wasn't an option here, and the happy hour menu is limited, I picked the one that definitely didn't have avocado (allergy) that sounded good, and I really liked it.  As far as rolls go, I would definitely come back for this roll, and a few of them at that!  Potstickers: seared chicken & vegetable dumplings, asian slaw, traditional soy dipping sauce.  These were \"meh.\"  Too much dough, and it was very chewy.  The insides were a little bland.  I'd probably go with a flatbread next time instead.    The regular menu is a little pricey for me, especially with how much sushi I usually eat, so I don't know that I'll come here outside of HH, but I will definitely come back to try some more of the HH specials."}
{"text":"Visitied last night for some late evening sushi, Usually not a problem, but they have remodeled restaurant and bar area. Now bar patrons are so close to restaurant crowd that is impossible to have a quite evening with significant other. A very large group of people who overstayed happy hour and tried to talk over the rest of their party made for an extremely unpleasant evening of not being able to talk to someone 2 ft across from me in the restaurant booth. Kona Grill is not inexpensive, even for a a couple of glasses of wine and small sushi order its always a $50 bill. Won't be revisiting until management figures out how to put back the ambiance the place once had, where a conversation could be shared among 2 people. Management did offer to move us to patio with misters, but who wants to sit outside in the summer monsoon season with 80 degree humidity and a temp of 105? Lol, that is why the patio was empty and quite."}
{"text":"Happy hour is an amazing deal! Sometimes wait times can be long if there is not any room in the bar. Happy hour is also only in the bar and patio area."}
{"text":"We ordered a spicy shrimp tempura the checkerboard roll the coconut shrimp roll in the Yamada roll.  Delicious!  We were here during happy hour before 6 PM and all of those items were either nine dollars. Very good deal."}
{"text":"First!! The food and drinks here are great. We used to come here every Sunday and eat dinner and hit a movie. Kudos to bartender Mitch for making memories with us.   Now?? The remodel was highly anticipated and we traipsed through mall looking forward to seeing the brilliance. We immediately loved the blue tints and amazing fish tank, then on our way to the bar I tripped up the stairs. Clutzy me? Nope, there was some unfinished remodeling and something wasn't to code so well it wasn't just me but even after the manager apologized ever so kindly nothing was comped and I had a horrible bruise for more than three weeks -- I couldn't sit in chairs with arms or sleep on my right side.  But....we love Kona, so back we are today and it's crazy holiday madness and the stairs are fixed with a safer ramp thing, but....the bathroom seemed like 89 degrees hot and sopping wet and in disarray, the downstairs dining room was stuffy and smelly and bright as a cafeteria. And once safely upstairs the bartenders were flustered (but we do like Brett and have enjoyed his service a lot!!) and where oh where are the TVs? It is a tied game ...Cardinals are standing strong and I have to depend on the Yard House for yelling out updates. Not cool!!!  Get it together Kona! We miss the old Kona but of course we aren't the same people either...just call me Mrs Z now;)"}
{"text":"Always a good place with family and friends! Sushi, food, and drinks were excellent, as always! Patio was perfect with outside misters and tvs to keep us updated with our fantasy football. Service did great, considering we were a large group. Brought out a surprise birthday cake for our birthday kids which topped it off. A perfect farwell dinner with fantastic people!"}
{"text":"A fun and varied menu with good service. We were seated quickly and the server let us take our time to decide on relatively busy Saturday night. We enjoyed some very tasty sashimi (the ahi was a standout) and a couple of their custom \"Kona Rolls\". I've always liked the dark and cool atmosphere.  Another very satisfying experience at this location where I have been spending the occasional datenight since . . . . geez . . . . Clinton was still President. Just realized. . . ."}
{"text":"Food is good.  Service was slow.  It took a half hour to get two sandwiches at about 2:00 PM when the place was near empty.  Also service was bad, we had to flag down the server to get refills or anything else. Wouldn't chance it if you want a quick lunch or if you have a life."}
{"text":"Kona Salad....a burst of flavors in my mouth. My favorite dish. The edamame is yummy too. Everyone enjoyed their food and the drinks were good. Service is OK Last visit was awkward. Young girl training and the one training her hovered and made her nervous. Then our food was wrong and she couldn't make a decision on what to do. All was fine in the end but it was our little girl's 9th birthday and she chose this place. Kinda made the evening \"blahish\" We'll go back but def need to step up their customer service game!!"}
{"text":"After hearing my wife rave about this place, I finally took her.  We went on a Friday night and were seated immediately.  It was loud and I liked the design.  There is a huge fish tank behind the sushi cooks.  None of the cooks looked Asian which I thought was odd.  Pro tip:  Register on their website from your phone for a free appetizer.  The coupon code can be used during your current visit.  We had sushi.  It was just ok.  Nothing to write home about.  Service was good.  Mens restroom was clean.  On our way out, we noticed a vegan menu.  Wish our server would have mentioned that."}
{"text":"One of the busiest happy hour spots in town - it is packed every day!   I don't mind the place for a quick drink after doing some shopping in Fashion Square Mall (which Kona is inside).  That's about it, other than after shopping or the happy hour this is not a place I really want hang out in. The restaurant unto itself is unremarkable."}
{"text":"I am not a fan of this place. I have been for lunch and happy hour and was dissapointed both times. The happy hour sucks. It has the worst sushi rolls and drinks aren't even that cheap. Your beer special is a $3 Miller Lite? Come on. The service is non exsistent and the sushi is not fresh. There fried appetizers are ok and at half price maybe worth it but anything fried after a few drinks tastes good. Skip this place and go elsewhere to spend your money."}
{"text":"Vegan vegan vegan Go go go go!!! The sushi man Bruno have the magic touch for sushi .. Really know what he is doing!!  They really know how to serve us.... They really opened mined.  I asked them for something completely off the menu then the amazing manager come over and verified really what i want after the incredible waitress stephanie ask me what I want..  Good price and good energy and of course good food , service and price... Thank you. We will come back again for su"}
{"text":"The restaurant is absolutely beautiful,  great atmosphere. The Happy hour is killer with big portions and an awesome London mule cocktail.  The bartender, greg was very friendly and fun. He made a few dinner suggestions and my boyfriend and I loved all of them. Definitely recommend locals checking out this place if you don't want to drive all the way to Sunmerlin. We will be back to see Greg and grub again very soon."}
{"text":"It was so good the first time I had to come back again. Let me say this is a great location.  This time was for happy hour. The menu had lots of variety which is a good idea for happy hour. Not too much but just enough. We ordered four different sushi rolls from the dragon roll which is my favorite to the Atlantic roll.  We also had the margherita flatbread. Delicious. The wait staff is knowledgeable and super attentive.  If you've never been to this location I encourage you to try it.  This is my new favorite place to bring friends and family for amazing fresh foods and drinks."}
{"text":"Before coming to Kona Grill you must understand that you are coming to an Americanized Asian/ Pacific Foods restaurant a bar.  Now with this being said, I have only eaten at this restaurant during their happy hour times and I have never left unsatisfied.  Their happy hour menu contains a variety of hot dishes such as lettuce wraps, mini sliders, fish tacos etc.  The menu also contains various sushi items as well.  Lastly, their drink menu during happy hour is nice a well.  We ordered their frozen margaritas and after two drinks, we felt great!  It helped set up the rest of the nights events where we did not need another drink to enjoy ourselves or to help relax us."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants! Everytime I come home to Arizona, I make it a point to go to Kona!  First of all, the food is great!  The calamari is a MUST! It comes with this slightly spicy/sweet dipping sauce that is to DIE for!   Secondly, I highly recommend the Sweet Chili Salmon Salad as well.  It comes with a huge fried wonton shell and is tossed with a soy-miso dressing.  My mouth is watering just thinking about it!   And finally, happy hour at Kona is really great.  They have great HH specials and great apps! Both Konas in Chandler and Scottsdale also have a fun outside patio area that is really popular every day of the week! Make sure to get there early if you want a table!  It's also a great place to start a fun day of shopping at Fashion Square ;)."}
{"text":"Started off great! Gouda fondue, and avocado rolls are AMAZING! But then ordered our main dishes, Las Vegas roll, and Macadamia Nut Chicken....   - Las Vegas roll is sitting in a pool of \"eel sauce\"(straight teriyaki sauce) and is essentially inedible, and KNOWN to wait staff about this problem  - chicken is over cooked, and Green-beans are seared, and still raw... not even considered \"al-dente\""}
{"text":"Nothing beats hanging out on the beautiful patio with a few cold drinks & some great food! You wont regret checking this place out...they also have a great Happy Hour."}
{"text":"One of our favorite spots back home and I'm so glad they have locations out here in Las Vegas! I love the food. It's always constantly made exactly the way I like it and the happy hour is our favorite with friends!"}
{"text":"The service was a little slow but we had a huge group with us. Food and drinks were amazing. Can't go wrong with this Resturant."}
{"text":"We met my in laws here for an early happy hour dinner. They have way too many rules about their happy hour. The only table in the bar was a high top. My mother in lAw can't sit at those. You know the older generation and their deals!  It kind of stunk that the regular dining room ( which was right next to the bar tables) wouldn't honor happy hour prices. We were there really early and the plAce wasn't busy at all. Food was just ok. Service was slow considering it wasn't busy."}
{"text":"Normally love this place.  Happy Hour is awesome and food always taste fresh but service is mediocre. Don't sit at the hightop tables.  They are slow and they don't know what you ordered.  Server checked on us about 3 times in a span of 1.5 hours.. my friend ask for water at the beginning of our meal, never got it, 45 minutes later she she finally went to the bar and got a water. Another one of my friends was holding the bill out for the server to grab and the server just walked by. If you're looking for somewhere to stop by for quick food this is not the spot."}
{"text":"I had a fantastic experience here. This isn't a traditional sushi bar, more like a combination of sushi (which was great, by the way) and more typical American food.  The atmosphere is upscale but very nice, not intimidating. The diningroom itself is quite large with plenty of tables.  My meal started with a wonderful drink called a hibuscus margarita. I could see where these might be 'dangerous', as you do not taste the alcohol at all, tastes more like a fruit drink. It includes an edible hibiscus flower which I definitely recommend eating! The flower was infused with the same fruity flavor and tasted sort of like a spiced peach.  One thing I adore is when a waiter gives honest opinions about different choices on the menu. Our waiter did this, recommending some things, steering us away from a couple of others.  I ordered sashimi, and the fish was extremely fresh! The prices were alsy very reasonable. I would not hesitate at all coming back here."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good... Pricey for portion size. Service is hit or miss. Drinks are ok for happy hour, but too pricey outside of that. I don't recommend coming with a large group."}
{"text":"Trying Kona Grill for the first time. I'm shocked I've never been here before since it's right down the street from my house. Now that I'm here I'm upset I've never been here but glad that I am here trying it out. Also it happened to be the late night happy hour that starts at 9pm so that makes things more interesting. The service was great and very helpful when it can to suggestions on the menu. They have two Happy hours which is great! The food was exceptional and I can not wait to come back."}
{"text":"First off......Amazing waiter!!!! The food was great-very fresh sushi. Probably best sushi I've ever had on the strip. Only problem was the hostess. We got to the restaurant and she was annoyed the second we walked in. It's not like the restaurant was busy at that time so I'm not sure why she seemed so annoyed to seat us. She took us to a bar top and I politely asked to move to a booth so she pointed at one and said that we would need to wait for it to be cleaned off, rolled her eyes, then walked away. I was appalled. Other than that, amazing service and food! Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"The sushi/rolls here are probably the worst I've ever had. My boyfriend and I ordered 3 rolls of which we sent back because they were all so fishy tasting. It seems to be poor quality (and I'm sure that there will be some manager/chef rolling their eyes at this review- but it's honest and I'm not the only one who thinks this, I assure you). On a positive note, the avocado egg rolls are great and they have a nice bar and patio area."}
{"text":"What a great experience.  We went in for my wife's birthday with our 2 kids ( 2 yrs old and 4 yrs old).  That staff were so friendly and prompt.  The kids had plenty of options even though they are not into sushi. The food was great and we will definitely be back.  If you are looking for somewhere a little nicer to go with kids this is a great place."}
{"text":"This is a awesome place to hang out, happy hour is great with friendly friendly staff and management. Scott one of the managers there is always friendly and makes sure everything came out ok. I would recommend to all my friends"}
{"text":"I wrote a review yesterday after a very upsetting visit.  After writing the review, I emailed the company..Yes, I was THAT upset. The general manager got back to me first thing this morning.  He attacked the issue with the kitchen and the \"said\" employee.  He made everything right and I will most definitely be back to try this spot out again.  I really want it to be good...Food was good, it was just the creepy guy and the kitchen issue...Thanks Morgan."}
{"text":"I hesitated for a minute to write this review...Scared that Craig might beat me up.  Not a nice dude.  He was our server on this Sunday afternoon...Was really hoping to have a nice time with my friends..and we did, but we were intimidated and bruised by this condescending man. I ordered a Cosmo off of the HH menu, he named off three different flavors and I said, whichever one is included in the HH menu..without skipping a beat, he simply repeated himself in the most condescending way possible.  Guy is a jerk.  I could go on and on, but I don't want to give this jerk my energy anymore... Manager did the right thing in deducting my friends dinner as all of our food came out over an hour after being ordered...and the order came out wrong. We were starving and food was good...Won't be back...it's a shame to as I'm a business owner down the street as is my friend and bartender and her hubby a well known valley musician...so unfortunate they lost our business."}
{"text":"A refreshing fusion spot to stop by while shopping at Fashion Show Mall.  Environment: Located on the exterior side facing the strip of the Fashion Show Mall, the restaurant has a nice mix of outdoor and indoor seating, offering a nice view of the strip if the weather permits it, while the interior decorating is just as aesthetically pleasing, with fish tanks, TVs, and glass fixtures. Additionally, inside seating is extensive, with a liquor bar, sushi bar, high tables, booths, and private rooms.  Food: The menu itself somewhat reminded me of similar chains such as Yard House and Tommy Bahama's with the different aspects of Italian, seafood, grill, sushi, as well as a couple other genres which allows for everyone to get a little bit of what they want. We got a spicy yellowtail roll as an appetizer because we wanted a little something light before our main entrees of the avocado chicken club sandwich and the shrimp pasta. The roll was nicely prepared and the slices of yellowtail were generous. The sandwich as surprisingly good as well, not dry at all and very flavorful. The pasta was delicious as well, with a lot of flavor seasoning, and garnishes. The shrimp was succulent, the garlic bread was cooked perfectly as well, and the dish was very filling.  Service: Service was good as well, with our server offering numerous suggestions and checking up on us through various points of our meal, even offering to box up our leftovers for us which was nice.   Overall, with Maggiano's and Ra Sushi right next door I believe Kona Grill holds its own and I could definitely see myself coming back here the next time I stop by the mall for some shopping."}
{"text":"Fantastic!  Lewis was our server and he is the man!  Very knowledgable, super nice and very attentive.  My lemonade never got dry.  The food was off the charts delicious.  We got here at 6:00 in time for happy hour.  We ordered pot stickers ($7.50), the chicken and shrimp lettuce wraps ($7.50), and a rainbow roll ($10.00).  All were fantastic and each was a large portion.  We are both stuffed!  Atmosphere is great...casual, couple games on tv, and a nice vibe.  Well done!  We will be back on our next trip!"}
{"text":"Still overall this place has horrible service! Upon arriving we are told there is a 40 minute wait, however open seating at the sushi bar and full menu available. Apparently the sushi bar is the new Starbucks as a gentleman was taking up 2 spots, one for his food and other for his laptop. But we were able to get a seat. Matthew ended up being our server, and wow he must not have been enjoying his day. First thing he told us was that happy hour is ending and we only have a few minutes if any to get our orders in. Wow thanks man, we just sat down. The hilarious part is my previous review talked about being ignored by the server, this time my mother was ignored. He took my drink order but didn't ask my mom if she wanted anything. He returned and asked her finally if she wanted anything. He took our order for an app and 2 entrées. Apparently he also doesn't know seat numbers at the sushi bar as both runners for our app and entrées asked different parties at the bar if it was their order. The runner asked everyone at the sushi bar if the potstickers were theirs, and the runner for the entrées asked the couple next to us. How hard it it to deliver food to numbers seats?   The only sign of hope this dam restaurant has is Oscar (I think that is his name) at the sushi bar. Though we never ordered anything with him nor did we get sushi he kept checking in on us asking if everything was good. Having conversations with us, ect. Very nice guy and should replace the servers I have had the unfortunate dealings with. I even told him his service is friendlier and better than our servers. Again FSM Kona is light years above and beyond it terms of service over this location. Food is great and Oscar at the sushi bar are the only reasons you may even want to try this place."}
{"text":"There was a time when I would have given this place 5 stars, not anymore.The food was pretty good for the price, now they raised the price to a point where the food needs to be much higher quality to justify the price. They used t make a good drink, now they they do corporate drinks 1 shot of vodka for a martini (I watched them make it) also a couple of friends have also complained about the drinks being very weak. I does have a lively feel to t though but I think that will eventually go away when people start noticing these changes."}
{"text":"Fantastic food with a very elegant atmosphere.  Nicely located in the santan village area near the best buy and total wine and more.    The staff was extremely friendly and attentive.  We probably had three different visits from restaurant staff.  The wait was minimal on a weekday, walk in and walk out basically.  Parking was very simple no driving around and parking in another lot.  Food came out fairly fast compared to most but it was a weekday at night.  It was just the two of us but I did see a table of eight that sat down the same time we did and finished when we did.  We also ordered the same thing no appetizer or special drink orders and possibly managed to get out of there under $75.  We both had the rib-eye which was absolutely amazing!  The meat was very tender and marinated in a sweet teriyaki sauce.  Then toped off with small onion strings and grilled pineapple.  The pineapple was so juicy and full of flavor from sitting and fusing with the rib-eye.  Then it came with some very good mashed potatoes and green beans.  We totally forget to order the pot stickers, were told very good.  This is a must while visiting Phoenix, will defiantly try to go here next time."}
{"text":"New menu is awful. Overpriced and underwhelming. Service was worse. Our table of four was the ONLY table here and they still managed to mess up our order. And then had the audacity to say \"Well, this is healthier anyway, it us broccoli.\" I don't care if it has broccoli or is any \"healthier\"--it's not what we ordered. And they still charged us for it! Not that I think it would have mattered. My sushi tasted like the stir fry which tasted like the lettuce wraps (soggy lettuce). Everything has one flavor: fish sauce and chili paste. Waste of $95. Hope this isn't a change across all locations and was just this one on Camelback."}
{"text":"I can't believe I'm the first person to review Kona Grill! For those who don't know, this is an upper-scale chain restaurant with many locations across the US. However, I'll stay specific to the one in Las Vegas. Actually, this one is in Summerlin, which is in suburban Vegas about 15 miles west of The Strip.   The restaurant is more famous with the locals for it's bar and patio than it is for its actual dining experience and food. While it sits in a shopping center, it still manages to have a cool vibe. Also, exactly what in Las Vegas isn't in a shopping center?  The bar is open to both the bar and the patio on most nights and the patio that goes around the outside of the place is great for hanging out with friends and having some drinks. The drink selection is not fantastic, but is pretty average.   As for the food, everything I've had has been two things: delicious and uninventive. For a place that tries to have an asian fusion menu, I feel like I've either heard of or previously had everything on the menu. Which is fine, because its all very good.   The main steal here is if you come for \"Reverse Happy Hour\". This is a late-night happy hour in the bar area only where they have a ton of great pizza, sushi, and other appetizers for very, very cheap. For example, you can get a personal garlic shrimp pizza for $3.95. This is awesome as you sit outside on warm summer nights.   The hours for Reverse Happy Hour are: Monday - Thursday 10 p.m. to 12 a.m. Friday - Saturday 11 p.m. to 1 a.m."}
{"text":"I ate here with a group of 11.  We started with calamari, which was good, but seemed small.  We then all ordered sushi.  We did not get the happy hour, so the prices were quite high for my tastes.  I asked my brother-in-law if the sushi rolls were large or small as he had ordered them before.  He told me that they were a good size, so I ordered 2 rolls for myself -- the Volcano Roll and a Crab Crunch Roll.  When the food arrived, I was shocked at how small the portions were.  The Volcano roll was tiny while the Crab Crunch Roll was average in size.  I guess the size of the rolls depends greatly on the chef for the day...  Everything tasted good.  The Volcano Roll was great.  I enjoyed the Crab Crunch.  My wife's roll had too much eel sauce for my taste, but she enjoyed it.  The service was good except when it came time to get the check.  I think that we sat there for a full 30 minutes prior to them bringing the check.  Again, the prices were high.  The average price per person was around $25, which wouldn't be so bad if half of us didn't leave hungry.  My sister-in-law and her boyfriend were thinking of going to taco bell after the meal."}
{"text":"The best happy hour around!! Anytime of the day is great food and excellent service.....Love it!"}
{"text":"First time I tried this was a couple weeks ago. They were having a lobster special, and I've never had lobster before, but it was a special occasion. The waiter, Matt I think was his name, was absolutely wonderful. I had no clue how to crack a lobster claw and he had wonderful recommendations for my husband and I. I will definitely be going back there. Great atmosphere and great food!"}
{"text":"Sweet Chili Salmon the best salmon I have ever had. Ordered well done and it was perfectly cooked without being dry. Clam chowder was also the best my significant has ever had. Service was awesome."}
{"text":"Have been going here regularly for over 10 years. The service and management in my experience have gone way down hill. Poor service 2 times in a row, sat at outside table tops and did not have a server even say hello for over 20 minutes, then the manager was a jerk, David I think was his name, when we requested a server. I always really liked the people and coming here, but have not been back since....."}
{"text":"This particular location has been hit or miss. For the past few years, I always get the same menu items. What changes is the saltiness of the food.   My last trip here was disappointing. We got our usual Macadamia-crusted Chicken that comes with fried rice, green beans and a crema to-go. I got home and I thought I was swimming in the ocean with my mouth open - that's how salty my food was and I'm not exaggerating. To fix it and make it edible, put the green beans in hot water; add plain white rice to the fried rice; squeeze lemon on the chicken. But I shouldn't have to do all that!  They should have called the dish that evening \"Chicken of the Sea\" because that's literally what it was."}
{"text":"The worsted happy hour ever I experienced,80% of their menus were sushi,and their customer service was sucks no one came ask for refills of our drink or need anything the only thing i liked about this place the investment,and  one more thing I would like to add when we get into the place there was no receptionist and we were waiting about 10min and after that one rude receptionist helped us."}
{"text":"Have you been here since the remodel? Well you should!  The place looks awesome!  We just had brunch there and bartender made the best blood Mary.  My boyfriend was unsure what to get so he conjured up an AMAZING martini!"}
{"text":"Staff at Kona has always been great!  And I can't say enough about the Ahi Tuna Crisps.  They have a nice formal resturant area or you can just sit in the bar area and take up a game or people watch :)  Lot's of fun and a nice happy hour menu!"}
{"text":"Just happened to stop by for Happy Hour and wasn't disappointed. First time here and everyone was friendly. Try the avocado  stuffed egg rolls. They were delicious and something I've never had. A place to try at least once."}
{"text":"Two stars are because the food is actually good. The three missing stars are for pathetic service.  Slow time from order to food - 30 min.  Server spilled water over us mishandling the drink tray he's carrying.  Overly strict no substitution on shrimp fried rice in a lunch bento that comes with shrimp fried rice - hey asking for plain white rice shouldn't be an issue but was. No manager ever in sight.  Contrast this to the Irvine, California location we've been to multiple times the is phenomenal.  Anyone in Kona Grill corporate paying attention or has arrogance set in fully?"}
{"text":"Since the new GM Michael took over, I can tell the difference in service and quality. The tuna tower is incredibly tasty with just the perfect layers of crab,avocado,tuna and rice topped with an amazing sauce.  I also loved the drink selection and the great price point on my favorite wine, Kim Crawford. Finally, be sure to try the grilled chicken tacos and the asian chicken salad. Happy HOur is a  steal if you can make it there on time. Nice job, KONA! We love what you do!!!"}
{"text":"Best Sushi place in town....amazing happy hour too. Love this place and always great service."}
{"text":"Mid afternoon and the place wasn't busy at all. Ordered drinks and an appetizer to share which came with no plates. Also missing were the lemons we asked for with our iced tea. During the course of our meal we had to ask for refills on our drinks several times and eventually gave up. The food was tasty, but the service was poor. Why do so many upscale eateries have such poor service. When you're paying $$ prices for food you should expect $$ service, right? For some reason that's becoming a rarity."}
{"text":"Never have had a good experience at Kona in chandler UNTILLLL yesterday! Don't get me wrong we LOVE the food and the indoor/outdoor atmosphere but the service is so spotty each time that we STRICTLY go in for the food if we can't make it to the Gilbert location or when we are in Vegas- the Boca Park location- PERFECT service- perfect food! However-They definitely have changed management and so we met Nick. They were extremely busy-(as most happy hour days are) but Nick quickly made eye contact with us the moment we sat and helped us place an order as other servers were busy. He was most friendly and VERY professional! LOVE that we were acknowledged and cared for right away. Usually this does NOT happen at the chandler location- but knowing new management has taken over made us most pleased and we will be back! We got our drinks in seconds and our food in minutes! Thank you Nick for our great and positive experience at Kona in Chandler!"}
{"text":"Excellent! First time. Happy hour!   Started with the Spicy Shrimp Tempura. Slightly spicy, slightly sweet, perfectly crunchy!  Next up was the Jalapeno Yellowtail Sashimi. Tender with a hint of capers. Perfect.  Finally, the Tuna Wonton Crisps. The tuna was slightly grilled and the aioli was heaven.   Highly recommend this location, especially during happy hour!"}
{"text":"Great menu! Awesome / creative sushi flavors and great appetizer selection. Great price and large friendly atmosphere- looks fancy. Superb service. I would recommend."}
{"text":"Really good food my boss just order this for the office and man i had to say i love their lobster mac and chess and their spinach and artichoke dip are my favorites   but for the price i think it could have been a bit better   I wish i could of go in the restaurant but having food come to you is still a plus :)"}
{"text":"I think for most people this might be a pretty cool place. We have tried the patio and the inside multiple times trying to figure out what the attraction is that others have to this joint. The patio definitely has a better vibe, but each time we see the weird waiter. When I said weird, I mean the guy has black died long hair in a samurai ponytail and a full face of make up. We have found rice in the the \"clean\" forks (which the weird waiter blew off like it was normal) and the drinks have been extremely average; however, the food bites for happy hour are tasty and cheap, and the patio offers a fun get together experience for friends. The only downside to the patio...it is a very tight fit between tables...a bit uncomfortable for someone who likes their space."}
{"text":"Walked in with out a reservation to grab a quick bite with my wife and two daughters. The hostess was extremely friendly and made my wife and kids feel great. We were sat right away and the waitress was also polite and helpful and explained the details about the menu. She was quick and on top of it.  When the food arrived it was fresh and delicious! We are for sure coming back to this place. One of the best new spots in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Going shopping at fashion show mall, so we decided to take our mother to lunch here, I ordered pad Thai, it was so sweet and barely any peanuts in it, the egg in it almost like rubber & not stir fried into the noodles at all. I asked for more lime and peanuts, but still so horrible I can't eat. When the waitress asked me if everything was ok. I told her I don't like it because it was too sweet and it doesn't tastes anything like pad Thai. And she said, \"really? I never heard of that before!\" and she walked away ignored me completely didn't even offer to take away or if they can remake it for me. We ordered pad Thai, sea bass, salmon, and dragon roll and the bill is $120! No alcohol! And the salmon was so dry......... just like a dried dessert!"}
{"text":"This is a pretty solid spot for lunch and for happy hour. The prices otherwise are a little high and their sushi isnt that good.   That being said, its a good spot to take a group and just wind down after work."}
{"text":"Carol, is a fantastic bartender! Happy hour here is such a great deal. Most of the bartenders are amazing, best service in the place. They always remember your name, and what you drink. Keep up your awesome ways!"}
{"text":"Love, love Kona Grill at SanTan Village. My fav is the happy hour appetizers. I can drop in for a nice visit with friends, eat me some calamari and sushi, add a nicely made lemon drop and slowly melt my worries away. The wait staff is always friendly and attentive. It's my go to place!"}
{"text":"Their food isn't the best I have ever had, but it is pretty good.  They have an amazing happy hour and its a great place to catch a game and hang out with friends."}
{"text":"I'm not into chains but this is the most consistent restaurant. I always order sushi and appetizers here, have never been disappointed. Service is great. The location is on the strip and unusually there is no wait, outdoor patio is a plus. The one thing I've never enjoyed at any Kona, is the dessert menu- too basic. If you don't want to be inside a hotel or in a loud setting - this is one of the best choices. Right next to fashion show mall."}
{"text":"Every time I have been to the mall here I have eaten at Kona Grill.  I must say I was pretty skeptical, being from Hawaii, about having sushi in Arizona.  Nothing to worry about here, everything I have had was fresh and tasty!  They have other non-sushi items as well, like the avocado egg roll appy which was delicious! Great vibe as well, you would never think it's located in a shopping mall."}
{"text":"Have been here several times. This time we had tickets to a show and TOLD the server we had a Curtain call to make. We THOUGHT we had plenty of time, but they took 45 minutes to bring our food after we ordered.  Sad part that when I got up to go see where our order was, there were 4 people 'cooks' watching the football game.  The only thing that saved us was that the venue was close (MIM in Scottsdale). We had NO Time to waste after we finished our meal.  Hard part is that I barely remember the food as I was too busy stressing over the time."}
{"text":"My partner and I drove down to the Strip mainly to try out the happy hour at the new Kona Grill (as we are big fans of the Summerlin store).  Wow!  The ambiance was created for everyone's tastes; no disappointments here.  Lots of light streaming in, a modern look with soft colors, great choices in seating arrangements, very comfortable & cushy bar stools, T.V. screens high up & not in-your-face, a beautiful restroom, the bar open to the outside which houses a terrific & large patio (incl. sofas, stand-up & regular tables), with street noise at a minimum, and... how could I forget... employees who obviously love what they're doing & who do it attentively.  Even the managers yesterday introduced themselves to ask what we thought of the new store (which opened last Saturday).  We had a sushi roll that even my \"No sushi\" partner loved.  Then the chicken lettuce wraps that came with 7 pieces of luscious butter lettuce & they were sooo good!  My partner, rather an expert on hamburger sliders, said these were the best because the two were large enough for his lumberjack appetite,  the cheese was generous & the \"right\" bun topped off the taste.  These sliders also come with a large portion of fries.  The prices have been only slightly raised on food & drink, & don't forget the terrific cocktails on happy hour; also, $2 off all wines.  Yes, and yes again.... we'll be returning, espec. in light of the Summerlin store closing soon for 3 months for a complete remodel (incl. an upstairs with patio) which promises to resemble this lovely Strip property."}
{"text":"Kona is a good place to grab lunch or dinner if you're looking to relax and kill some time. It has a patio that always has a little crowd which is fun. They recently remodeled which turned out very nice. The dining room and bar downstairs is much better than it used to be. For the remodel they added an upstairs rooftop bar with a dining area which is really cool. The food is always consistent and pretty good. I have definitely killed many hours at Kona relaxing with friends. It's not what it used to be like 10 years ago but it's still fun. Try them out."}
{"text":"We had friends visiting and staying at Trump Hotel so we thought this would be a good place to meet them for dinner.  Have to say a great choice. Loved the atmosphere and the food was great. What made our dinner so awesome was our waitress. So personable! Ask for Paula. She made this 5 star dining."}
{"text":"We thought that the food as a whole was good, the pricing fair, and the service very good. Nice looking place, interesting menu choices. Maybe a few more Thai entrees, and some ramen instead of pulled pork sliders. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Happy hour on a weekend? Yes! They have select sushi rolls on happy hour along with a few other items off the menu, and alcoholic beverages. The food is yummy, ambiance is great (pretty fancy), great service. I love coming here on Sundays"}
{"text":"What a great experience.  My wife and I visited tonight for dinner, and were treated with excellent customer service from our server, Steven, and the AGM Shadi.  Both were attentive, and provided excellent recommendations.  We started with the chicken and shrimp lettuce wraps, then had the chili lime salad, ceviche, and lobster and steak roll.  All were super delicious!  We also had a couple cocktails from the bar, which were prepared very well.  We highly recommend Kona Grill, and we will be back.  I have never Yelped before, and the service and food at Kona inspired me to do so.  Go.  Now!"}
{"text":"The worst service I've ever had I've been there 2 times with friends We're always waiting for 30min for a server And than we get horrible horrible service Never going back"}
{"text":"Ratings:  Food (4): Order the sea bass, wow! It is so sumptuous and every bite the fish practically like melts in your mouth. Highly recommended.  Their desserts are pretty big, I was surprised that their portions were as big as they were.  We ordered the butter cake and the ultimate fudge brownie. I am a huge chocolate lover and I actually enjoyed the butter cake more.  I felt that the brownie wasn't moist enough and kind of dry.    Service (4):  Great hostess and waitress.    Atmosphere (3.5): I feel like I am blind in there sometimes because I have a hard time reading the menu. However, the place is very simple and neat. They do have a bar and an outdoor seating area"}
{"text":"Going to Summerlin is like traveling to a different city. It takes some planning and I feel lost most of the time. Luckily for me, I have Robyn and Kevin L. to show me around this foreign land. Summerlin might not be as exotic or far as I make it out to be, but I definitely need a reason to head over there.   On many occasions I was told about a happy hour that is worth checking out. It goes Monday-Friday from 4-7 and there is a reverse happy hour as well. Sit out on the patio, at the bar, or at the sushi bar and one will be guaranteed discount prices.   The drinks list is small, but the sake bomber is worth the $7.5. It is a full bottle of beer and a container of sake. One of my friends got that and I regretted getting a margarita.   The food is good, but what makes it better is the prices. Most of the basic rolls that run between $6-7 are half price. The same goes for select appetizers. The calamari are tender and delicious. Lettuce wraps are another bountiful choice that will surely please the taste buds. The specialty rolls are worth looking at for $6.   With the HH checked off my list. I must come back for their regular menu. Apparently anything with soyu cream is a must have and I must get some."}
{"text":"Kona grill is a nice restaurant if you are forced for some unknown reason to eat in the mall.  I have eaten there a couple of times but we mainly dine on the patio getting a couple of drinks and appetizers.  We went over the weekend during one of the NCAA games and it was very lively.  It was packed but we managed to get a seat outside on the patio.   As far as the service since it was so crowded I felt the waitress was very rushed but never the less she tried to be as attentive as she could.   Atmosphere: good for groups or parties.  I don't know if it was just because of the game but there were lots of intoxicated people around us (it was also only 6 pm). And plenty of saki bombs at nearby tables.   This time we just got the sushi which I would describe as below average.  The presentation was less then appealing and several rolls were oddly shaped or stuffed to the brim.  The portion was also small ( I think it came with 6 pieces) for the the price.  I first got the white saki sangria. It was \"fine\" nothing great but I still drank it. I asked the server for a second drink recommendation but she didn't have one. ( I know people probably hate that but I don't drink often so Im never sure!)  I choose the strawberry fizz for my second drink hoping it would be similar to other drinks I have loved in the past (i.e. Culinary Drop Outs drink Room service.)  No such luck, but it wasn't horrible either.   I think that is the overall experience of Kona grill: fine.  Nothing was bad but nothing stands out.  With several other options in the area if I were planning a dinner out It would not be one of my choices.  But if you are at the mall and the line is too long for Yard House you don't have too many other options."}
{"text":"Had a business dinner here last night, The Sweet Chili Salmon Salad is to die for!!! Nice atmoshpere. It's located at the mall in Chandler, AZ. I would only come back to have the Sweet Chili Salmon Salad only because I would be afraid to try anything else. When you are seated, they give you their standard menu, if you want sushi, you have to request for another menu. Their sushi was so-so. If I came back, I'd opt out of the sushi and dive in for the Sweet Chili Salmon Salad. If you are not into a lot of dressing, I'd suggest to request it on the side. It seemed like they put a little too much. Knocked a star because I wasn't too please with their Sushi selection."}
{"text":"Everything sucks! The over priced food, The slow service with such a empty restaurant! Regret coming here and I should of just went to RA restaurant next door!"}
{"text":"Great for happy hour. That is the only time we usually go here for some reason. It's probably because it's such a good deal.   We've been to multiple locations and all of them are all equally a 5 stars.  Some of our favorites are the bama roll, spicy tuna, eel roll, and the Atlantic roll.  We usually just sit at the sushi bar because all the patio seats are usually taken.   The calamari is also a winner and the flat bread pizzas. There are a lot of other items that look good on the menu, but haven't got around to trying them yet."}
{"text":"Oscar & Erica were extremely nice to us on a Wednesday night... gave us free advice on the top sushi rolls to order and Nigori was only $9!!"}
{"text":"Why did I give my favorite HAPPY HOUR place only four stars? Because getting a table during happy hour oftentimes entails inflicting bodily harm on other cheap-sushi hounds.  On more than one occasion have I had to fight for a table (the patio area is free seating and it wasn't until a few weeks before I left Scottsdale that they actually added more tables)...all for $3 spicy tuna rolls, $4 goat cheese pizza and $2 margaritas.  But just like the WWF Championship Belt, Kona's happy hour delights are definitely worth pouncing someone for! If you don't want to deal with the patio-seating mess, you have the option to PEACEFULLY enjoy the (full price) dishes served in the main dining area. I highly recommend the salmon salad!"}
{"text":"We had  a delicious  lunch at Kona Grill. We had the BEST server  Melvin... He is happy, attentive, very personable and he couldn't of been more attentive.  Because of Melvin we will return!"}
{"text":"Finally got to check out Kona Grill yesterday for happy hour, which is 7 days a week by the way! It was around 3pm on a Sunday and the place was packed! All tables on the patio and in the bar area were full so we sat at the bar. The bartender David greeted me right away and gave us very good service throughout. I loved the Red Sangria and the Spicy Tuna Roll. Avocado Egg Rolls were pretty good. Spinach Artichoke dip was just ok, the texture was fine but it really didn't have much flavor, I actually had to add salt which I never do. Brio's is way better. There were several other items on the menu that I would like to try so I'll definitely come back!"}
{"text":"It's been a while since I went to Konna grill. Now it's totally renovated I'm impressed. I went for a 7pm happy hour but ended up staying for the 10pm happy hour, we had a great time we sat at the bar end hang out with Mike the bartender he gave us great recommendations, defenelly worthy the drive. My favorite is was the yellow tail sashimi :)"}
{"text":"I really only like this place at happy hour for the avocado egg rolls. Mmmm :)"}
{"text":"Always have a good experience here at Kona Grill at the mall. The ambiance, service and food are very good. If you're in the mood for salad try their asian chicken salad with crunchy noodle so filling."}
{"text":"Kona Grill has the best value happy hour out there.  The food portions are gargantuan for a small price.  The best part is that they offer HH 7 days a week!  On Saturdays, it runs from 1-5.  It's only offered in the bar & lounge area, which fills up quickly.    The best dishes we ordered were the BBQ Chicken Pizza and the Chicken Satays.  Loved the spicy peanut sauce that came with the satays.  The pizza is so filling!!  I'm gonna say pass on the sushi.  While it's really cheap @ $3/roll, it's not so fresh.  We tried an Atlantic Roll to which we both said \"Meh!\"  The spicy shrimp was pretty good, however their calamari wasn't so much.   They offer a house Chardonnay & Cab @ $6/glass during HH.  The Chard was not bad for cheap HH wine.  They also have a Sake @ $6/bottle.  The service is hit or miss.  We've had OK experiences and one horrible experience, but never fantastic."}
{"text":"We came in here during day of shopping and the be honest I thought this was a Hawaiian place but it's not.  It is typical bar food with some sushi / nigiri choices which were ok but nothing exceptional.  Would I come back?  Probably not.  I need to have an exceptional experience to come back otherwise I like to try new places when out on the town."}
{"text":"A great place to hang ! A nice patio with views to the strip  and last night they had DJ Dynamixx playing all types of great music  The happy hour had great drinks and sushi specials to Will definitely be back Wednesday's for this new night"}
{"text":"Came for lunch, left happy! Had tuna sliders-excellent. Also had the shrimp salad. Great salad but the grilled shrimp were chilled...I expected warm freshly grilled shrimp. BUT, it was an excellent salad.  Service was good as well."}
{"text":"Kona Grill is a great after work cocktail place. The happy hour is a steal. The macadamia nut crusted chicken is one of my favorites. I've ordered sushi from here, but it's definitely american sushi...lol. Not to say that it's not good, just not traditional rolls that you'd find in a sushi restaurant. The atmosphere is very energetic and hip. Good food, good drinks."}
{"text":"Great Saturday afternoon lunch. Their Happy hour runs on Sat afternoon on the patio with a great selection of food and drinks! We had the apple and Brie pizza, which was plenty for two people to share...my husband had sushi and really enjoyed the \"Wave Roll\"...I had the Oriental Chicken salad which was light and refreshing. Great place to sit in the sun and watch the world go by...we will be back!"}
{"text":"Happy hour is awesome :) Food is awesome :) Now if only they could get the service on point.   Every time I come here the service is awful. No it's not just a fluke. This is my sisters favorite restaurant. She loves their food. But everytime I am here, I am simply reminded why I only come here with her. Sushi is yummy and their happy hour specials are on point. I do enjoy the avocado egg roles and the lettuce wraps are pretty spectacular.   If the service was better, I would be here more often as it's right around the corner. 4 stars for food/1 star for service."}
{"text":"Hit up Kona Grill with my son, Dad and his wife for an early dinner. We weren't able to take advantage of the happy hour because we couldn't sit in the bar area because of my son (obviously). Kinda of a pity they don't offer happy hour for table service like they do at Yard House but I digress.  The calamari app was not my fav and I wouldn't order it again. The batter was light but just not very crispy and the dipping sauce was so thick and spicy it totally overpowered the calamari. My California roll was one step up from Costco quality. The rice was overly sticky and the avocado and cucumber were practically non existent.  The only 5 star worthy item was the kids meal. Seriously, for like $6.50 it was a ton of food and the options were fantastic. There was everything from shrimp tempura to grilled salmon to  chicken fingers. You also can select two side items and it comes with an orange cut up to look like a bear! So freaking cute. It's served in a bento box and my little guy was over the moon with excitement when he saw it.  Bottom line: would return for the kids meal alone."}
{"text":"I was working today and three lovely ladies dropped by to spread some wonderful knowledge regarding a new SUSHI JOINT IN THE MALL. They dropped off Togo menus and chatted for a little bit but all I heard was \"BEHOLD, YOUR LUNCH BREAK AND AFTER WORK SUSHI CRAVINGS SHALL BE QUENCHED IN OUR ARMS.\" yeah, that's what I heard in my head...what of it!! So after I clocked out, came in, and got a bar table for 1. Right away from walking in, the hostesses were friendly, my server introduced herself after I was sat, and I got my HOT SAKE!! Everything came out splendiferously and my experience during my early dinner was amazing. Great food, awesome staff, delicious HOT SAKE, and FIRE OUTSIDE to stare at...just awesome. PAOLA was my server and TOM stopped by to say hi. So ask for PAOLA when you come in here and be sure to say hi to TOM...good people y'know?"}
{"text":"I really like this place! They need one in California! I came here for happy hour on a Thursday evening, and it was pretty busy. Like most places, happy hour is only at the bar or out in the spacious patio (first-come, first-served).   Things we tried: - California roll - Spicy tuna roll - Fiery shrimp roll - Crab special roll - Kona calamari  Everything was delectable. The California and spicy tuna rolls were better than they are at other places. The fiery shrimp roll had quite a kick. And, the Kona calamari has notable sauce. I especially enjoyed their mango margarita. Another thing to note: the above was a lot for two people, and we ended up taking a good portion of it to-go.  Bottom line: A chill atmosphere, friendly staff, and delicious eats and drinks made for a very pleasant happy hour adventure. I will be back, Kona Grill."}
{"text":"Started out good.  Great bloody Mary and really good gin cosmo. Cheese fondue for check-in appetizer was good. But..., the entrées took an hour to get to us. Not without explanation. The server and the manager both told us that someone \"stole\" our order. Interesting way to talk about your co-workers...  The pad Thai shrimp was definitely not worth the wait either. Shrimpiest shrimp. The size you find in a salad. The pad Thai itself was like boxed \"Asian Creations Thai Kitchen\"  Now, with all of that said, I love the location and there is ample parking with the two garages. The restaurant is clean but they definitely need management and training to make it at this location. High rent district with amateurs at the helm."}
{"text":"First off what I can say is,NEVER COME HERE. HORRIBLE service, RUDE staff and UNCOOKED food! I was excited to go to this place but when I walked in I definitely did regret coming here. I went on a Friday night and it was HORRIBLE service. I will never be coming back here even if I got a free meal here. The hostess are not nice at all and My family and I had to wait 10 minutes just to get a table. The noise level is very very very loud in here! Like this place was more of a bar all throughout the restaurant than just in it's own area. All you here is drunk people screaming and laughing very loud and the whole time I couldn't even hear my family say something because it was that loud, we had to scream to talk and for one of us to even hear each other. The service is horrible. We had to wait 20 minutes before my mom finally asked a server if someone was going to help us. All the servers just looked at us as they were walking by and didn't even bother to ask if we have been helped or not. We finally got sent a server and he was horrible. He asked us what we wanted drinks and we ordered and then for 20 minutes he just disappeared out of no where and never brought us our drinks. We left him no tip. My mom finally flagged over a girl and she was so so nice she apologized a lot and brought us our drinks right away after we told her what we had ordered. The guy server before her never even came back to us to say sorry and we didn't see him for the rest of the night. Even when we were waiting for food the new girl server told us it was super busy and we wouldn't have to wait much longer which I liked a lot. The food was horrible. I got The Las Vegas Roll and is was so gross. The fried part on the outside was super cold and so was the fish on the inside like it had been sitting out for a long period of time. I did feel sick after eating it and i'm surprised I didn't puke. I couldn't even finish all of it. This place is more a bar scene, very loud, horrible service, and definitely not for families especially if you have little kids. Definitely will not be coming back here."}
{"text":"Wow Wow Wow! So impressed by the quality of the food...ordered the chicken satay appetizer and the sweet glazed salmon via UberEats and everything arrived super fresh and tasty. I can't imagine what the service must be like, but this delivery experience was top notch and image of Kona Grill very very positive. Thank you !"}
{"text":"Always love Kona. Service is awesome, our server Dai rocked it. Great attitude and positive vibes. By far my fav location."}
{"text":"Awesome remodel!the management and staff are mostly brand new, very friendly!great atmosphere. Wonderful service and overall happy feel! Great job revamping the entire place!"}
{"text":"Extremely slow service, forgot my beer, didn't bring soy sauce to the table, food took forever."}
{"text":"The reason why I wanted to post a comment regarding this location was simple, CUSTOMER SERVICE !! We came a few days ago for a quick lunch, and ordered the seasonal filet (which was cooked perfectly) which we decided to split since we were ordering other items. Raven our server and Bob the manager not only brought the food out timely, but they split the meal onto two plates so we didn't have too. This is not something that we requested, but what a nice gesture. All the food came out great, and with awesome service. I'm a little late in posting this, but since we're here again now ( and having great service AGAIN) I figured I'd better post this.   01/26/18 Wow how is it we're here again being served by Taylor, and we get great service and amazing food. It must be in the training here. We love Kona Grill"}
{"text":"This place has fallen off the path. I used to frequent this local spot often with friends for happy hour. I had recently returned and was very disappointed. The server has a trashy blonde chick with tattoos on her forearms that has no sense of proper table waiting. She needs to go and to be replaced with a more suitable employee. I understand that this is a crappy version of an LA style joint but it needs some attention. The food is crap."}
{"text":"Thanks to the all the Yelp reviews I was aware that happy hour is all day on Sunday. We originally had a reservation for 10 at 3 PM on Mother's Day in the dining room. When we arrived they were still setting up our table. The very courteous hostess then informed us that there was room available for our party on the patio. I then remembered about the all day happy hour and we accepted the offer to sit outside. The weather was perfect that day which provided a great atmosphere for our meal.  Happy hour gave us the chance to order and sample many items. For drinks, I had a bottle of cold sake for $6.75 and my wife had the sparkling sangria for $6.50. For food, they have select items for $6 and other rolls and flatbreads for half off. We ordered pretty much the entire HH menu except for a flatbread. Everything was quite tasty and no plate was left with food on it. The shrimp tacos were a hit and I enjoyed the Voodoo Roll which has spicy crawfish, tuna, and habanero sauce.  Mychael was our server and he did a fine job despite being very busy with multiple tables aside from our 10 top. One thing to be aware of is that the bar and patio areas are first come first serve so there will be vultures hovering around, especially when you are coming close to finishing because they want your table. Happy hour at Kona Grill is a good value and we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Kona Grill is always the go-to spot either on the strip or off at Boca Park. Happy hour or even just for lunch are both great options.  I've tried:  Spicy tuna roll Crab crunch roll California roll Avocado egg rolls Chicken lettuce wraps  Las Vegas Roll  They were all great options, but definitely worth it when they go on happy hour!  Overall, great place for a good time and good food."}
{"text":"The place was a mess. Granted, it was a Saturday night, but still. C'mon guys. My colleagues and I arrived around 6, sat down, and for the next 30 minutes, we were neither greeted by a server nor could we flag one down (because they were just so elusive!).   We finally were able to order a couple appetizers to share, and they were okay. Salmon sashimi decent. Avocado spring roll wasn't bad actually - the sauce that came with it was probably one of the best things about the night. Fries - meh.  The Macadamia Nut Chicken ($19) was pretty good, except for what was supposed to be the star of the plate. The chicken was lackluster and barely crusted or cooked. One of my colleagues who ordered the same dish - his chicken was chewy and it turned out to be under-cooked. A colleague who ordered the Miso-Sake Sea Bass couldn't finish the ratatouille part cause some spice was so overpowering.  The service was nonexistent. We had so much trouble just trying to get salt onto the table or to get the bill. The entrees also took so long to prepare. I don't even understand how it was possible to take so long.  I would not come back. It's not worth it - esp. for how much money Kona charges too."}
{"text":"The service, quality and cleanliness of this restaurant has gone downhill.  No sound on tvs outside, numerous requests for misters to be turned off (lied to that others wanted them on-when in fact others also asked for them to be turned off), drinks spilled by waitress, no table clearing by waitress, no water refills unless you asked--- poor customer service without one single visit to our table by the manager !!"}
{"text":"Went with a large group and it was surprisingly empty inside. The menu had a great variety of options and everyone seemed to enjoy what they ordered. I got the spicy salmon roll - it was good, but not memorable. It has lots of TVs for entertainment."}
{"text":"Things to get at Kona Grill. Macadamia Nut Crusted Chicken.  Things not to get at Kona Grill. Everything else.   Pros: Watching people who think they're at the coolest spot in town, but don't know they're not.   Cons: Watching people who think they're at the coolest spot in town, but don't know they're not.   Misc.: Basement like atmosphere. Car fumes. Families (ugh, i.e., CHILDREN). You're still in a mall.   Aloha Kona. Aloha. Mele Kelikimaka. Mahalo. Magnum P.I."}
{"text":"It had been a couple of years since we last visited the Kona Grill and we were reminded how much we like like and need to return more often. If you check-in through Yelp, you should receive a free appetizer which we used for a Chile-Lime Shrimp salad that was not only delicious,  but so large we took half of it home. Many of their entrees have an Hawaiian Fusion flavor and flair that we really loved. Last, we were so lucky to have met and be served by Kayden who was exceptional in every way! Overall a fantastic night of dining... give them a try if you have not already."}
{"text":"This Kona Grill is better than the one at chandler fashion. The customer service from all parts of the staff was on point. I didn't feel pestered or ignored. The food was delicious and the drinks were made well! I ordered the margarita pizza but I forgot to ask for no tomatoes if you don't like tomatoes like me make sure to order it without tomatoes. There sliced pretty big and put throughout but if you like them it will be delicious. Also as usual I get my avocado rolls with their green dipping sauce that is to die for. I had no idea they had miso soup so that was a find for sure. I know I can order it when I get sushi now. Great spot for post shopping eats."}
{"text":"I used to like coming here but today's service was not only terrible. My salad had bugs in it and my friends pad Thai also had a bug. **I am adding to this**  I posted the video so I can prove that I am not lying or exaggerating. I understand the patio is open and bugs fly, however, my salad had bugs not on just the \"surface\" I found one fine, whatever, you wave it away. The second and third made me question how well my salad was washed.  I am just put off, what can Kona do to reduce the insects from coming inside. I was told via email that my review sparked complaints for \"embellishment\" It has been a few days and now I am not longer angry and in the moment. I feel my review now more accurately represented now. I would probably never have a salad there again, but instead eat sushi, However, I would rather go to my favorite sushi place over Kona. Best of luck, but I will choose to no longer be a patron here.   I apologize to the manager if I was unfair and I hope this update to my updated review is more objective -H"}
{"text":"I come here a few times a week because I work in the Scottsdale Quarter.  It was my favorite happy hour in town.  I waited all day until 3pm to take my lunch break so I could come to Konas happy hour but this time was different.  What a huge disappointment to sit down at the table and find out that not only did they take all the good stuff off of the happy hour menu, they raised the prices for everything that is still on there.   It's not even happy hour anymore, it's pretty much just all regular priced food.  Such a shame that they had to get greedy.  They even took away military discounts.   Definitely lost my business."}
{"text":"So my family and I have been frequenting Kona for 5 plus years (we usually go to happy hour at least 2 times a week and dinner once a week).  Unfortunately someone had the brilliant idea to cut happy hour off at 6pm when everyone is still driving home from work! Also cut back weekend happy hour. Like another yelper stated they no longer serve wasabi and ginger with sushi.  The worst part though is they got rid of the best frozen margarita in town for some super sweet mai tais that I have not heard one person say they like. It is usually dead there now compared to the crowd it used to draw.  Haven't gone back and probably never will unless they decide to consider their customers when making these crazy changes."}
{"text":"Came here for a afternoon drink on Saturday afternon with the hubster and I decided to try the cosmetic martini, only 76 calories and very tasty.  I was impressed and I'm curious if it's on HH menu. I would love to come back to HH but fridays are way to packed for me so I might have to pop in during a weekday. we sat sort of inside the bar but we could still feel the blazing heat coming from the patio.  June and it's already way to hot. :) az gotta love it."}
{"text":"Children in the bar!  We enjoy Kona but haven't been in almost a year!  We have always enjoyed the happy hours - but their policy of allowing babies and kids join their parents in the bar is disturbing.  We tried it again tonight and it was like Happy Hour at a daycare.  I'm not a prude by any means - but I would like to enjoy some adult time at the bar without listening to babies cry or the soundtrack to Finding Nemo emitting from an iPhone or tablet propped up to entertain the toddler while the parents enjoy happy hour drinks."}
{"text":"I went to Kona Grill for my first time today with some coworkers and I will say none of us were impressed and will definitely not be going back! The drinks sucked and so did the service! The food was good except the spinach and artichoke dip. We had to send our \"Long Island ice teas\" back twice so tried two different drinks that were horrible as well!"}
{"text":"I like the variety of food that this place has to offer, but I often order the pizza because it's really good. The service is always exceptional. On nice days it's really nice to sit in their outdoor patio area. Sushi is pretty good here too, along with their seaweed salad. I didn't like their calamari though."}
{"text":"I'm giving this 3 stars because the drinks/food are pretty good, especially on happy hour pricing, but the service is mediocre at best everytime we go. The reason we keep going back is probably because of the patio seating. If you do sit on the patio, be prepared to wait. Certain servers act like you're personally hassling them by sitting out there. Nonetheless, their appetizers and sushi rolls are pretty good, as well as the desserts (the cheesecake was delicious.) I also really enjoy the sangrias. I probably wouldn't ever go if it wasn't happy hour and pay full price though."}
{"text":"Super disappointing considering I've left a great review for this exact same location in the past. This was my first time sitting inside the restaurant instead of on the patio and first time ordering the sushi. Took about 15 mins for us to be greeted at our table and even longer for our waters to get to our table. When we were finally able to order food we asked our super un attentive waitress for soy sauce which we ended up having to ask another server for after 5 minutes. Generally when there is such slow and terrible service I am more understanding if it's busy but it was 9:30 at night and almost no one else inside the restaurant so there is no excuse. Also our sushi smelled very very fishy it was almost gross. Sadly me and my three coworkers did not feel our server was deserving of a tip since she was non existent all night. Food was okay. Left thirsty because we couldn't flag anyone down for a refill on our waters. Might try again another time probably not. Not really worth all the trouble that the servers cause and the amount of money you spend. Too bad."}
{"text":"Place came highly recommended.  Nice location in little village.  Wasn't completely impressed with my meal.  Ordered Chicken and Shrimp Pad Thai.  The sauce was not very flavourful, the bean sprouts raw, and the rice noodles undercooked so they were chewy.  Are about 1/3 and called it quits. My friends salmon dish looked good and she said it tasted great.  Perhaps just my bad luck. ,"}
{"text":"[First time Out-of-Towner for Spring Training]  Mall food is always a gamble...  Mall food has stepped its game up, especially at Fashion Square. We saw a few restaurants, but we were hesitant because they always seem to chain places - lucky for us out-of-towners, we didn't recognize either of them. We decided on Kona Grill, the girls were craving sushi-ish type of food.  We'd heard they had a reverse happy hour, so that was also a plus in the decision making process. We were an hour early, but I think we got the good end of the stick, because we were there for awhile. We decided to sit on the patio, because every time we saw it, it looked fun and a chill spot.  Being the Cali girls we are, we totally forgot about smoking!! Cali girl FAIL! We had people puffing all around us, which isn't KG's fault, our own...but gross! Cig smoke and dinner just don't go together.  The patio is awesome, tons of TV's to catch any game. Lots of people watching, especially because it is by the entrance of the mall. \"Snots\"dale was becoming more and more evident as we spent time in this area.  The menu was super cute. Great job design team, very cute and urban, without jeopardizing the masculinity. I went with the Cool Cucumber Mojito (bonus for skinny girls, only 110 calories). It was tart, yet refreshing. I really enjoyed it and it seemed to be the largest Mojito I've ever indulged in. The girls really liked their drinks...but I can't recall what they ordered, they were on the drink menu...we went 3 for 3, not bad   False advertisement warning: The Shrimp Penne is SPICY. Those haunting little red pepper flakes infested my meal :( I am very aware of when menus indicate spicy and this did NOT say that, I think...this thing was burning my mouth on impact :/ I didn't want to send it back, we all know what happens when you do that...unmentionables, but I had too! I couldn't stand it after 3 bites. The non-mouth-numbing version was great. The shrimp were decent and the butter, wine, lemon sauce was great. The garlic bread is amazing, my inner carb lover was giddy as can be.  The other dishes ordered that were pretty good as well. The sushi platter even came with a huge side salad. The sushi was basic, but fresh, can't ask for much more than that. The fried rice comes with Chinese Sausage, but the rice was crunchy...it was an interesting combo...not sure which way I'd go on that. The seared Ahi is plated beautifully and tastes delicious as well, very thinly sliced.  Chris our server was great from the start. Even through sadness of my painfully spicy meal made into a normal non-spicy version. He was kind, funny, and helpful. He even went above and beyond and gave us some good places to go out on the town...being newbie's and all, we asked everyone...  My taste buds are still recovering, but I won't hold it against Kona Grill..."}
{"text":"So we arrived at 5pm we where seated right away service was fine, We tried 3 appetizers all were great , Then main course, We got our food but they forgot my wife's roll . It was sitting for a bit on counter and I had to remind the server, not a big deal it was already made. But sushi wasn't that good. So I did see some me people order sliders burgers . And to be honest if we only had ordered the appetizers we would have loved it."}
{"text":"Rob and David were the best!! Made our happy hour really ! Great food choices, fast service, and friendly staff!!"}
{"text":"REVERSE HAPPY HOUR STARTS 9PM PEOPLE!!!! Very, very good happy hr prices.  awesome place to go this time of night when you are looking to chill and have a few drinks...from mixed drinks, beer, sake..whatever your poison is I'm sure they have it.  I just really like the atmosphere at night...the music, the indoor/outdoor bar/patio vibe they got going on here, t.v's..and the huge fish tank that serves as wall ,separating the dining area from the drunks-it all just works-plain and simple.  oh yea and the menu is pretty decent too- sorry i get a little over excited about good drink prices..  check it out peeps!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Great happy hour and always such a good vibe! Not to mention one of my favorite bartenders works here! Service is always great, food is always good and I love that it is so close to home!"}
{"text":"Great service, great music (kaskade) ambiance and food/drinks.  Thanks for a fun night!  Thank you to the manager who created a delicious dessert for us when our first option had run out."}
{"text":"I go here for happy hour on the patio!  Love this place...perfect location and it's a cool place to meet young, hip, singles or just to get after work drinks!!!  I wish the happy hour wine had a resiling or Shiraz even ...."}
{"text":"It's a shame it's closed, but... I'm certain it will be even more fantastic when it re-opens... Can't wait!"}
{"text":"Excellent happy hour with lots of real, non-greasy food on the list. Try the tacos in chicken or catfish, or the crunchy crab rolls - all of which are generous enough to be a meal for one or are easy to share. Staff are upbeat and attentive, music isn't overly loud, patio is heated for cool desert nights. It's one of those off the strip chill spots that's a nice break from the tourist circuit."}
{"text":"Food was great, staff was very attentive, decor was pleasant and the prices were very fair. You would really have to stretch to find anything bad to say about this place. Will definitely return here and anywhere there is another Kona Grill. Count me in as a fan."}
{"text":"Mothers day was coming close and I needed to make some plans for the wife and i wanted to try something new that i had not tried before.. So before you make comments about that statement, yes i did something for her that was kind of for me also. Anyways I headed over to opentable.com and aha they had reservations and they offer flowers to the table.... Nice touch.   We arrived at Kona and the place was packed.. We checked in and the hostess let me know it would be just a few minutes for our table and that was it. 2 minutes Later we were on our way to the table. The waiter was quick and brought us waters and greeted us with a happy mothers day shout out to Becky. Nice touch #2   We ordered our daughters food when we ordered our Calamari appetizer and they came out at the same time... This is perfect and exactly why we do that. The waiter then took our orders and let us know that for moms there was a drink special... $2 bubblers  \" Champagne Cocktails\"  so it was taken advantage of. We ordered the macadamia nut crusted chicken and the macadamia nut crusted chicken tacos. Both meals were nothing less than amazing. Mr. Waiter also asked right off the bat if we would like any extra sauces... Nice touch #3  As we were finishing up the delectable meal he came back and said, \" by the way, you have a red velvet cupcake coming as well for free for mothers day\"  Nice touch #4. This thing was amazing, first off she loves red velvet cake and I love cream cheese frosting, so they pleased 2 eaters with one cupcake.   I say Yes to Kona Grill. The food was amazing the service was prompt and precise, and they really did do the \"extras\" to make it a special mothers day. In my opinion I say try this place out and see if it something that is for you!"}
{"text":"I used to love Kona and was a regular. Apparently they've changed their happy hour times and prices. This was very disappointing news and I'm curious as to why they would fix something that's not broken???"}
{"text":"We've been here twice. The first time was just a random night out for dinner, service was great and food was pretty good. The ambiance was great also. We ordered the ahi steak sandwich and the bbq chicken flat bread, both came out promptly and delicious! I'd definitely give that night 5stars.  We then saw a flyer for all day happy hour and football, so we went again today. It was a different vibe and service was not a attentive as the first time we were here. I don't think this place should even offer a happy hour with football, if 1. You can't hear any of the games, 2. There aren't enough tv's to enjoy all the games that Sunday has to offer. Also if you're encouraging football fans to come in, watch the games and have a good time, don't give them dirty looks when cheering on their teams.  The happy hour menu is decently priced with a couple good options. The avocado egg rolls are a must! And make sure that the dipping sauce is on the plate when you get it, cause when you ask for it the server said \"oh it wasn't on there?\" With a little attitude, if it was you think I'd ask for it? I used to be a server and before you bring any dish to a table you always make sure everything is on there correctly, especially if it's a normal dish that gets ordered multiple times a day. Also isn't it customary to offer waters to those who aren't having a drink?   Aside from the eggrolls, we ordered the calamari, bulgogi tacos and crab crunch roll. They were nothing special, I'd probably never order any of those again except the egg rolls.  For the experienced we got today, it averages out to be 3 stars for both visits.  We'll come back but never for a football Sunday."}
{"text":"Kona used to be one of my favorite happy hour spots, but lately the quality isn't what it used to be.  The deals are still good, but the food is just okay.  The sushi has gone from good to kind of a mess.  It used to be my favorite thing to order, but now I try to avoid it.  The pizzas, and flat breads are a pretty safe bet.  They've always been well made.  The other appetizers are good too. The flavored cosmos are too sweet for me, and the margaritas aren't as good as they used to be.  There's always beer when all else fails.  Since the happy hour is at the bar, and on the patio only, parking, and finding a table can be difficult.  I usually avoid going there for happy hour when the weather is nice, because that means it will be nearly impossible to get a table."}
{"text":"The food is always awesome here. Clean bar and friendly staff. Great place to watch a game too, MASSIVE big screen tv at the bar... Sweet."}
{"text":"Kona gets four stars because of their stellar (haven't heard that word in a while, have you) happy hour and for their Las Vegas roll.  I know it's not \"real sushi\" and all that other crap but I like it for these two reasons and that's enough.   $3 rolls and cheap margaritas make me happy.  (Well that and we have some stock in Kona - kidding!  That doesn't influence my opinion in them at all.)"}
{"text":"This is a regular place of ours. We love to come here for happy hour. They have a great outdoor patio - but come early you can wait a half hour or more far a table.  The happy hour menu is great for food - however the discounted drink options are only so so.  We really enjoy their sushi, however I am not a fan of their spicy tuna rolls.  This place is always hopping. You're likely to run into someone you know. The food is really good. The  music is current. The atmosphere is great! The service has always been decent."}
{"text":"Stick to the happy hour items, during happy hour. Tried the calamari and roast beef and wish I had stayed with happy hour items. Calamari was soggy and the roast beef was a little bland. The sushi my wife got was perfectly fine however. The atmosphere was lively and fun and we'll probably go back, but I'll be a little reluctant to order off the regular menu."}
{"text":"Finally made time to visit this spot. The menu was not as strong as I had expected. It was limited. Ended up ordering their signature burger. It was above average. Moist lot of flavor cooked like to a burger should be. Also had one of their rolls sent it back. Verdict,  okay place to have a let's get to know each other date. Little pricey as always my thoughts never presented negatively. On that note I'm just saying."}
{"text":"We were in the Fashion Show area and we were looking for some place to have a quick dinner before our High Roller reservation at Linq.  Our original plan was to go to the burger place, but then I spotted Kona Grill's sign and we went to see the menu which had some good entree names so we decided to eat there.  I ordered a Kona Chopped salad and my wife got a Macadamia Nut Chicken. We also had a soup - tomato basil bisque.  To our surprise the food significantly exceeded our expectations. We thought we would just grab some food quickly before our other scheduled activities that night, but I think it's fair to say that both of us actually enjoyed the food.  All dishes were very balanced with ranges of ingredients from fresh vegetables to flavorful chicken meat. It was quite filling. I ordered a salad and thought I was going to still be hungry after eating, but it turned out that the portion was big enough to get full.  The staff was very friendly and helpful. When we arrived we were greeted and thanked for coming by somebody who might be a manager there.  We sat outside which is a nice experience tool since its in the middle of strip.  Overall, I'd say if you looking for a decent place to have a quick (or not) meal, you should consider this place."}
{"text":"The wife and I really enjoyed our dining experience here.  Everything was very good from the service to atmosphere, drink, appetizers and entrees.  We opted for just sushi as the appetizer which was pretty decent.  Portions are quite big and this would be a cool place for larger groups too."}
{"text":"Had heard that Kona had redone its decor, so decided to try it out. Inside looks totally different from before and has a cool layout with sleek design. Looks terrific. They've even added a second floor. Awesome.  The patio area is new as well and includes needed space.  The menu seems to be the same. Had the crab crunch, spicy shrimp, and tuna wontons. Yummy.  Always fun to have happy hour here on a nice day."}
{"text":"So I was over there last night after work for a combo \"going away\" and \"congrats on passing the bar exam -  you get to keep your job\" type-party. Lots of people from work, and some other guests in our group. (About 15 total) We are in the upstairs section and the server there was just a bit dismissive and slightly rude.   Examples:  1. Ask for a wine list. Response: \"I'll get it in a minute. I've got to see what these people (in a different group) want.\" 2. Ask for a glass of water (after we have ordered several rounds). Response: \"I'll only have two hands and I have to deliver these first.\"   I stayed for three drinks but left early because service like that isn't fun. The drinks were good. The service not so much. Glad I wasn't paying."}
{"text":"Vegas roll, California roll, and the shrimp and lobster roll... perfect. Service was great here and it was really fast! Atmosphere outside was perfect on the day we went."}
{"text":"Very nice eatery....i felt under dress for this occasion....anywho co workers and i tried it. Their flatbread wasn' t bad...but i should have tried the Margarita one. Pot stickers wasn't too bad. Overall. It was good."}
{"text":"I have had the opportunity to visit Kona Grill as a person on vacation from the small town of Ellensburg, Washington.  Just to be clear, Ellensburg is very small and has limited dining opportunities.  HOWEVER, all of my experiences in my small town GREATLY exceed my dining experience at KONA SUCK.  My friend and I went for happy hour.  We received a watered down margarita (I ordered a second shot and it was still awful and a sad Tisdale cab, let's clarify that this is a bottom-shelf wine from Fred Meyer!).  Disgusting.  Then we received a sad tuna roll with stale and chewy seaweed, and perhaps more disappointingly, a \"chicken and shrimp on romaine wrap\" that was actually a frozen dinner style chopped chicken and salad shrimp stir-fry with too much sauce on BIBB LETTUCE not romaine.  It was AWFUL.  Please do not eat here, go to PF Changs and order the delicious Coconut Vegetable Curry.  Delicious.  Kona Grill = Applebee's. I can't believe this last of quality was delivered at Fashion Square.  Happy eating elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Excellent once again!  My husband had the like bowl and I had the sampler plate.   Both were wonderful.  The wait staff were impeccable!  Never disappointed here!!!"}
{"text":"Great food and service! Happy hour prices and menu is excellent! The patio gets a bit crowded during HH, so be prepared. Highly recommended the spicy calamari, Las Vegas roll, and the chicken dish- way good!"}
{"text":"Took my spouse out for date night dinner. The noise level was louder than expected. The appetizer was very tasty, we tried the avocado egg rolls. We also shared a sushi dish. I wouldn't mind going back for future meals."}
{"text":"My best friends and I came here to finally try their Happy Hour that I'm always hearing great reviews about! Especially finding out that they had a separate vegan, vegetarian, & gluten free menu, I knew we had to go!   We arrived to the restaurant and found out that it is open seating during HH - you can sit pretty much anywhere except in the dining room.   Service was really great, considering the fact that it was super busy! Our server was really accommodating and super helpful when it came to ordering.   For food, my friends ended up getting the sliders, margherita flatbread, and California roll from the HH menu which they really liked! The sliders are huge! It was like two regular size burgers and it was big enough for my sister to take home leftovers.  Keep in mind that if you're vegan and order from the HH menu, there's literally only one roll you can get which is the vegetarian roll. I ended up getting this but wasn't really satisfied at the end of the meal - the roll was bland to me and literally just tasted like a couple bits of veggies smushed together with rice and nothing memorable about it. I had to really dip it in soy sauce to get a decent flavor out of it.   Overall, we had a fun experience for our first HH at Kona! I just wish their HH menu was more accommodating to vegans."}
{"text":"Love this Place or i used to.... ever since the renovation, some of the food has a different taste. our server seemed as if she hated her job and we were bothering her every time we ordered something. she had 0 sense of urgency and walked as if it was a sunday stroll in the park. I've worked restaurants before for many years and i never once left my customers waiting on my behalf. still a great place, maybe the staff needs to be changed again, at least they had good looking staff that loved where they worked prior to the renovation."}
{"text":"We came for dinner at happy hour. We had 5 rolls and 2 drinks for $33. Service was prompt and friendly except for the bar tender who refused to serve us because we did not sit at the bar. He is pictured below."}
{"text":"Great place to go for happy hour and more.  It can get crowded, inside and out.  Kona has a great selection of appetizers and meals featuring sushi, sashimi, rolls and more.  The menus is extensive and we have not yet been disappointed.  The bar area is medium sized, but spill out onto the outdoor patio where there are misters for the hot days and evenings.  The service is friendly, prompt and good."}
{"text":"I don't know what happened but the food is horrible here since the remodel or whatever I had to put salt on my salad wich I dnt even eat because the Ceasars dressing is so greasy it's basically oil and sardines ...... did not get a single drink refill the whole visit  and a side of fries never even came to the table you also could see the grease floating in my soup not to mention my whole plate of fries (different order) consisted of time little pieces that looked like someone at half of it and they gave me the scrap  well congrats kona you lost a regular and get back the beef"}
{"text":"I have been dying to get here knowing renovations have been completed and only heard amazing stories about it and were they right! They did a great job! Love the second story. It's something that reminds me of a bar in Newport Beach, minus the beach view of course. However, I felt like the food quality is not where it use to be. I made it in time for happy hour which is a challenge during the week. They have had the same happy menu since I could remember. And the sushi..well let's just say it's probably best that you skip this route all together. I regret not snapping a photo just to show you but the color or taste was not fresh.  It's a mediocre place - the environment is what will keep me coming back."}
{"text":"I am very disappointed. This is my first return since the remodel. This place used to be awesome; it was always packed, the price was perfect, and it was a great place to meet up with friends, very casual. Now there is a snooty atmosphere, smaller portions, the prices have increased by 50%. In general, it feels like they got greedy and thought they would have the same crowd and gouge their customers. I will never come back. Too bad, it was one of my favorite spots."}
{"text":"I have to say, if I'm looking for a cool and comfortable outside dining area, Kona Grill always seems to pop in my head right away! It's because of the outdoor area I always want to visit.   This has been my third time at this location and although the service is nice and the atmosphere is inviting, the food is just okay. This most recent visit my family ordered a few different sushi rolls, grilled chicken sandwich and the pad thai. Overall the sushi and grilled chicken was okay and seemed a little bland. I also ordered a cucumber cocktail and unfortunately didn't finish it because it tasted more like plain club soda.   Although this trip seems like we didn't enjoy it, we still enjoyed the outdoor area and surprisingly, the pad Thai! I probably would have never ordered this, unless we were in an authentic Thai restaurant, yet this happened to be the table favorite.   I'm hoping this visit we just ordered the wrong stuff and our next visit it gets better. Look forward to trying it out again and updating this post!"}
{"text":"The hostess was so clueless we left after half an hour of waiting. She sat people that just walked in ahead of three or four parties that have been waiting half an hour. When asked about it she seemed to not have any idea how their restaurant worked. So angry it's enough to make me not go back"}
{"text":"The sushi rolls were great. Took a little longer than expected but it was worth the wait. I recommend the Bama rolls!"}
{"text":"We decided to stop and luckily it was happy hour. The menu for this time was short, and our meals were great. Portions were just right. We sat on the patio and our server was very tentative."}
{"text":"Wish I could give zero stars. Came here on a Saturday for dinner around 5pm with 2 kids.  Sat immediately and handed packages of bendy wiki stix for the girls to play and that's where it went all downhill. It wasn't particularly busy. Probably about 4 other groups in the area we sat. We waited. Several people came and cleaned and setup other tables. We waited some more. They sat another group in the same area. We both waited. I noted some servers happily dancing near the kitchen.  I packed up the kids, got up and left. Never coming back.  By the way, went to yard house nearby and though it was quite busy, promptly seated and served."}
{"text":"So it's been 3 years since my last review, so I thought I'd update it! Well, the renovation that they did to Kona Grill is nice! However it seems since the renovation also out went their customer service. The last 2x I've been here I've been pretty disappointed with the lack of attentiveness and really the sense of urgency.   Most recent, we were sat outside and it was just a little chilly and there was a dirty table that we asked if we could sit at. Our waitress Taylor seated us and told us that she would have someone clean it right away, some minutes later another waiter sat other guests at the table and cleaned it right away for them... Fine. So then I decided to order some sushi and my boyfriend ordered a burger. I then asked for sake with my dinner. My entrees came out well before his burger and I ended up finishing my dinner before my sake and his burger arrived. The Sushi roll was just ok. Our waitress hadn't checked on us for some time so I headed to the bathroom and caught my waitress midway and told her to cancel the sake order. She made an excuse saying the first sake wasn't made hot enough. But I'm pretty sure she let it sit on the bar counter so it got cold. For the rest of the evening she just checked on us 1 or 2x more. She apologized for the sake and we got our check and paid the bill before she could leave again, not wanting to wait on her.    Anyway, it was just a very poor encounter and I used to really enjoy Kona Grill, next time I'll just take my boyfriend's first suggestion and go to In N Out instead. Better service and 70% cheaper."}
{"text":"Quickly becoming one of the better local Happy Hours in town. Good food, good atmosphere and friendly servers. Only reason I don't give them 5stars is because the prices have shot up a little since the renovation. But it definitely is justified by the upgrades. I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I would like to start off this review by stating I have never been the only one to apologize for a bug in my drink but now I am going to lose that one in a game of \"Never Have I Ever\".  My friends and I came here for Happy Hour last Thursday after work to blow off some steam, have a few drinks, and some cheap eats.  Kona has a GREAT happy hour for food and the fact they run it until 7 is amazing, no rushing to get an order in before 6 PM.  The drinks are just so so, I enjoy a $5 margarita but when I have three of them and feel the same as when I had zero of them, it makes me want to pay full price just to get a strong drink.  Our visit started out well enough until I noticed there was a fruit fly in my freshly delivered Margarita.  The restaurant has an open air bar which means fruit fries can be a problem, it's a common problem, I get it.  We flag down our waitress and I apologized and point out the bug.  She said \"Ok\" and walked away.  I looked at my friends, was I the only one to apologize about a bug in my drink?  I didn't expect her to grovel but at least acknowledge it happened.  This should have been a sign.  New drink was brought out and all is well so we order some items off the happy hour menu.  Here comes problem # 2, our food arrives but there is only 1 set of silverware at the table.  We stare at our food until our waitress comes over to ask how things are tasting.  We ask for silverware and she stops at 3 other tables before she brings it out to us while we continue to sit and stare at our food.  Once she comes back with silverware, I have to ask for chopsticks and soy sauce, which should have been brought out anyways since 2 of the 3 of us has ordered sushi.  This time she made an annoyed guffaw as she walked away like it was my fault she didn't think to bring us sushi accompaniments.  Our food was good and was decent for the discounted price.  I noticed I did not receive one of my HH food items but since our waitress didn't write down our order, or seemed to notice it was missing from the table, I figured maybe she didn't hear me when I ordered it.  We asked for the check and I saw I had been charged for the item but never received it, and pointed this out to the waitress.  She seemed to understand and took all of our cards to run payment.  We watched as she carried the books with our cards under her arm pit as she checked on her other table.  I'm not paranoid about identity theft, but then again I don't like when my credit card takes an unplanned stroll through the restaurant.  She returned with our cards and I thought was going to thank us for coming but she started to lay into me about the missing item.  She blamed ME for it saying \"Next time this happens, you need to tell me earlier otherwise I don't know that it didn't come out.\"  I apologized (again) saying we all make mistakes and I didn't know if she had heard me when I ordered it, which is why I waited for the bill to come in case it hadn't been rang in.  You know, no harm no foul.  Evidently this wasn't an acceptable response (yes, yes the bug and this dish not making it out of the kitchen, all my fault) and she said \"The kitchen makes the same dishes over and over during happy hour and they have no way of knowing if they missed a dish on the ticket.  You should have said something earlier and I could have fixed it.\"  After all this, I felt like that \"David After the Dentist\" kid, is this real life?  Will we be back to Kona? For happy hour, yes.  I just hope our waitress will be working at her other serving job that day so I can save my apologies."}
{"text":"If you plan to use the free app/roll coupon via Yelp make sure you have an extra 25-30 minutes. It took that long for our waitress to get the food comp'd.  Wait staff was great, managers not so much."}
{"text":"This was the worst experience ever. The hostess lied to us about s table and put us in a huge room cut off from everything. I asked for the manager and asked him why we were not in main room he was a jerk a complete jerk. I told him to forget it because I couldn't get thru to him. He offered to move us but too late. Will neve ever visit there again."}
{"text":"I do love Kona Grill! My mom or dad and I always come here for HH. We get an order of California rolls and the BBQ chicken flatbread. Yum! The flatbread is slathered with tangy BBQ that occasionally has a bit of a bite, and it is topped with chicken, red onion, cilantro... Mm :) I always order those two things. I have never had any complaints here for the last several years I have been popping in, although one time there was a cockroach on the window. I mean, it IS a restaurant... What do you expect, really?"}
{"text":"This place gets 4 stars because it is good for after work happy hours.  Sushi rolls, apps and drinks are half off.  The sushi is decent quality, but it is definitely a touristy place to hang out.  I would only recommend this place if you're hanging out with co-workers and grabbing a quick bite prior to a night out."}
{"text":"Ordered take out today. Got the macadamia chicken. Everyone that orders this know the meal is only good with the sauce, soyu sauce! Well I asked for extra...15-20 mins was the expectations set. Cool. I went and an hour later my meal was done. 2nd, they gave half the sauce NO EXTRA??!!! And missing the other best part which the mango little sauce, chicken kind of burnt but because I'm home hungry AF I ate it. Called and the hostess said sorry I really hope you have a good day. BS!!"}
{"text":"Bison burger was great and dessert portions were large. Service was slow"}
{"text":"4 stars simply because happy hour here is a STEAL. You get HEAPING amounts of food for so little $'s: regular-sized rolls for $5, fancier rolls for $7.75 and a smattering of other entrees like full sets of sliders, skewers for the same price. We ordered way too much food and left absolutely stuffed.   In terms of quality, I don't think this is the best sushi I've ever had, but the food was definitely not bad. It's good for a very filling meal, if not for the finest cuisine. I probably wouldn't eat here again for a formal dinner but the ambiance is kind of like a fancy sports bar / restaurant so it seems great for games. Service was also excellent: our waitress was the best!"}
{"text":"Iv been coming here for years and service has been ok. But today I have to say my server John (on the patio)was so great!!! He was attentive but not annoying. He's definitely the reason for this  review!"}
{"text":"*strictly based on initial experience -did not eat. Too many restaurants/competition to have such a let down in service. Service issues obvious when we walked in with 3 tables not cleared and place was only semi full. Sat outside with a 1 year old and had 3 servers come out and handle their one table...and absolutely ignores us.  Not acceptable especially as you are trying to build up a new location.  Will give 1 of the hostesses credit as she was great when we came in.  No rush back.  Thank you True Food for another fabulous experience."}
{"text":"Kona Grill is one of those places that usually has something on the menu to please anyone, so it's reliable when you need someplace handy.  When Tivoli Village was overrun by a BeerFest last weekend and we decided that Brio was not a good idea after all, my dinner date and I headed across the street and were seated immediately on the patio.   I've never had a problem with the food at Kona and this time was no different, ordering a small house salad and shrimp tempura roll.  However, choosing to sit on the patio was not such a great idea.  The music was too loud for conversation, the misters above our heads were dripping intermittently, and there were people smoking at the next table:  lesson learned.  Other than that, our server was very attentive and we had a great meal.  The End."}
{"text":"Great service, such friendly people and a very comfortable environment ! The food was amazing and very flexible if you are on a diet."}
{"text":"Pad thai was good but have had better.  Clam chowder was great as were the lettuce wraps.  Service was very good"}
{"text":"The service here is usually pretty good. Servers and bartenders seem to be friendlier than other places. Above average for sure in that regard. Food is decent. I think it's best to come during happy hour though, as the prices are a bit up in the high range otherwise. Great patio with good sunset views (see pic)."}
{"text":"Los makis muy buenos, aunque un poco pequeños, el arroz estaba muy fresco. Los tacos T deliciosos. Precios adecuados, el ambiente moderno pero agusto."}
{"text":"We love HH Sundays on the patio.  You can enjoy everything from sushi to flatbreads to sliders and please all the members in your party.  The prices are wallet friendly.  Fresh air at City North is an added bonus!"}
{"text":"I like this place. I've only tried a few things (mainly sushi) but it looks pretty good. They do serve tiny cuts of fish, which seems to be the norm around AZ?? Either way, I like their wine selection and menu -- it reminds me of home. The patio seating is nice. :)"}
{"text":"This location usually has sub-par service as compared to the one at fashion square.  I wouldn't be surprised if this location shut down ... just about everyone here has a bad attitude and it shows.  Avoid this place, there are better sushi/Asian places in the area."}
{"text":"Kona Grill  this is why your CEO will  fail #KonaGrill is dead in #Scottsdale #Az on a Wednesday Does your CEO even know what #Scottsdale is about? #EpicFail #BerkeBakay #ChristiHing You call yourself an analyst #ChristopherKrueger you have failed my city #Scottsdale I am a long time fan since 2001 But no more Way to kill the happy hour vibe"}
{"text":"Used to love this place. Over the  years it has declined. Ordered the sea bass  not sure if it was real sea bass and the side was awful, buried in butter.  Too expensive for what you get. . Always have good service though.   Management need to take a gander at the reviews and do something"}
{"text":"Marissa was friendly and attentive .   Delicious Patron Margarita and yummy lettuce wrap."}
{"text":"So our birthday club ended up here for dinner lat night. I had not been here in years and they have totally revamped the bottom floor and in addition they added a second level.  This place has always reminded me of a meat market where those who want to be seen are present and looking to get lucky.....snicker, snicker!  As I walked in, I really like what they have done. The floor is open and no longer dark. I love the lighting and the decor. The main bar and the sushi bar are separate and both bars are set up in squares.  Our booth was nice except is was right next to the cashiers area. Still no noise or interruption from the servers though. Our server was very nice and delivered great service to our table all night long. I wish I could remember his name as I would love to give him a shout out. I briefly mentioned to him that is was my friends birthday and he surprised her with a lovely dessert! He was the best!   I ordered the Macadamia Crusted chicken with a creamy Shoyu sauce, broccoli and for dipping a mango/pineapple sauce. It was ok but nothing I was over the moon about. The chicken was flavorful but the dish came semi-warm. I like my food served hot. The best part about the meal was the free appetizer/sushi roll that you receive upon check in. At first, they tried to tell me that the check in was only for a free appetizer so I pointed out in black and white that it also listed sushi roll. They were happy to accommodate us. We also enjoyed a pitcher of their red sangria/sake. This drink was really refreshing on such a hot evening.   Overall, the evening was a success but I can take or leave this restaurant."}
{"text":"This place has a great atmosphere good vibe and good service.  Excellent happy hour and really good food and cocktails.  It's connected to the mall but still highly recommend it"}
{"text":"Best happy hour ever!!!! Quality and quantity of food was terrific. And service was great. Had a large beer, two small sakes, three appetizers for $31 including tip. Good deal."}
{"text":"Terrible service at the bar (3/8 830pm) although minimal customers. Two servers were talking and playing around never coming to check in even after I had ordered a bottle of wine and appetizer. Very immature for Scottsdale area, will not be back to this location - both myself and another customer spoke to the GM, and she graciously apologized and took care of the bill for the wine/edamame. I had dinner at a nearby restaurant, which was a huge inconvenience with a long day at work for this to happen."}
{"text":"Food quality was good as I've always experienced but service was NO WHERE NEAR what service should be. I see I'm not the only person to bring up this extremely important part of your dining experience.   We did arrive around 8pm on a week day and sat in a booth in the back. After being seated it was like the two of us were invisible. It took over 10 min for anyone to greet us and get our drink order. When my friend asked about beers the waiter was clueless and said he would have to ask the bartender. After nearly 10 min later he returns to say sorry what's on the menu isn't correct and gave a list of beers....seemed clueless of what we were asking. Now we have our drinks and wait another 15 min to get a server. A girl comes up and explains that she will now be our server that the previous guy was done for the evening. She asked if we ordered already....NO. So she look like a deer in headlights. What then do you want. We order rolls which were very good. Now we have been sitting with empty plates and drinks and no is around to be seen so we walk to the front to ask for service. The young lady apologizes and asks if we want our bill. No we would like more food....spicy tempura shrimp with No onion, no scallions....well it was delivered with scallions. When we bring this to the servers attention she looks at us and says....there are no onions in the food...ummm scallions are onions. She laughs and takes it back....more waiting time and once we are ready to leave we have to interrupt 3 servers cleaning tables, resetting tables, and sweeping floors...again we're invisible. We ask one to get our server.    We just felt we were inconveniencing the staff. There were people in the bar area and oh yes, the music was wayyyy too loud. It was that way the entire time we were there. Are you trying to make it clubby??  Not relaxing and service was incredibly disappointing."}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate love and left with a broken heart . I've come through this location one other time and it was just okay, I was craving sushi so I ordered the Philadelphia roll, a couple spicy tuna rolls, the tomato bisque soup and to drink a raspberry lemonade. The order came out and instead of the Philadelphia roll they made me a California roll. I told the waitress that I didn't order this she said well I must've not heard you right so then she takes it back my husband finishes his food before mine is brought out so I eat some of the soup which could've been good if I wasn't constantly choking on the tomato peal that was left in the very chunky soup. Once my sushi finally got to the table, I was disappointed with the taste, I've had better super market sushi not even kidding! Oh can't forget the 2 yes 2 bees in my lemonade! They were at the bottom of the glass had to have been dead a while. They did warn us about bees outside and the whole time we were there we saw 0 bees!! Flying around us so idk. What I do know is that I'm not impressed with the food and service is a little lacking considering the restaurants in the area. I don't think I'll be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Kona Grill at Fashion Square is my favorite location. The ambiance is always good, the sushi is great! Good for happy hour, dinner with the family, or late night drinks. Happy hour menu has all the favorites! AND, they brought a complimentary dessert for the birthday girl...very cool!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to Kona Grill even before the renovation when it was only one story.  The layout is similar with just a more open space overall and looks much brighter than it used to be.  The happy hour is great for drinks along with Asian fusion dishes and sushi.  The bartenders are very friendly and always make sure you're not empty handed drink wise.  Pricing is very reasonable and the portions are great for family style dining or just individual dining.  Dishes that I recommend include the yellowtail jalapeño, chicken lettuce wraps, and the chopped salad.  The sushi is quite fresh, a bit generic compared to sushi restaurants but they have all the basic rolls and a great happy hour menu for sushi.  Kona Grill used to be the local hangout for drinks and food but it seems it has lost its former shine or I must be getting older!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite kona to go to! Fast friendly service and the best happy hour in town!"}
{"text":"We ordered Sushi and Calamari. The sushi was fine, but nothing special. The calamari was not good. It was under seasoned and the aoli was bland as well, although the texture was good. I expect more at this price point and from Kona."}
{"text":"Layne was an amazing server that accommodates our party of 15.  He  recommend sparkling cocktail which is amazing.  The tuna won ton crisp is my favorite dish.  Great service with good company.  We will be back with Layne as our server"}
{"text":"This time went to happy hour with my son michael we we had the beef bulgogoi taco which is so so, the avacado eggroll were awesome as usual,  tuna wonton crisp is a definite must have, bbq chicken flatbread is good, kona calamari is delicious and and if you like rolls the crab crunch,  voodoo, and Bama ones are tasty"}
{"text":"I have been going to this location on the regular for almost 5 years due to living across the street.  I moved out of the neighborhood in December but was craving it today so we stopped in for a roll and appetizer.  Over the past year we have noticed that the rolls are getting smaller and smaller not to mention are usually falling apart on the plate before attempting to pick them up.... this was definitely the case today, it was horrible and obvious to anyone looking at the plate (11.50) When it came time to pay our tab we were shocked to find out that the beer we ordered was only $1 more than the soda!  $3.25 for a diet soda in which you have to flag someone down to get even 1 refill?   That is ridiculous!  The prices have been on a steady rise but the quality has been declining.  We definitely have decided to find a new sushi spot."}
{"text":"Kona Grill has been one of my favorite spots for years and years and years. Esp back in the day when Vegas didn't have many cool outdoor patio restaurants. The patio + happy hour prices + their food is just so great.   Honestly though,used to be a bigger fan before the remodel and prices went up. Still a great place, but just not the same. I used to love the contrast of the outside patio with the darker intimate inside. Now just looks a bit more like a typical restaurant/ sports bar.   Although the price increases aren't drastic, the difference between $5 and $7.75 does add up.   But anyway... Their food is good and the vibe is great. Calamari has always been a fave, avocado eggrolls, sushi... It's all good.   Happy hour all day on Sundays. Mon- Fri happy hour is 3-7 and 9-11. Saturdays 1-5 and Friday/Saturday nights 10pm-12am"}
{"text":"We haven't dined in at this Kona Grill but we have been ordering food from here for the last couple weeks and it's always been very good. Honestly I didn't have that great of an opinion of Kona Grill before, being a chain, but at least in terms of takeout sushi, this location has been one of the best options in the area (for lunch). I love the sunshine roll, which has plenty of salmon inside and outside, along with refreshing pieces of lemon on top. I've also had the Asian cabbage slaw salad as a side, which makes a nice meal when combined with the sunshine roll. Eventually I'll get around to dining in person and trying the happy hour, but for now the food to go has been great!"}
{"text":"Great Service, nice Patio, food excellent. If you like Sushi they have lots of choices. Kids menu is great. lots of food so huge value!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and staff very helpful, professional and friendly. Shared avocado egg rolls (beyond amazing), original poke and a yellowish roll with jalapenos. Poke was outstanding, more like a dissected roll. Sushi wasn't my favorite but I don't like spicy things."}
{"text":"This place has the best sushi I have ever tasted.  The happy hour prices are amazing.  Try the Bama roll and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Bad bad bad bad service attitude from server bad management I wish the CEO would look into his employees better, its nice place but bad service  Waiting for food 30 min or more waiting for sake 30 min or more and at the end when we complain to the manager we get an attitude  I will never eat at this place again."}
{"text":"Great location at Scottsdale Quarter! Love the vibe and the menu! Outdoor patio with lots of great tv's! Comfortable booths and great ambience. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"First, let me say that this review is ONLY for Happy Hour from 3pm to 7pm. Second, let me tell you that I've been going here for years.  The happy hour drink specials are nothing special (get it?)  The margaritas vary in alcohol content depending on some cosmic sign from the universe. Apparently, when the moon is in retrograde, they are eyewateringly strong.  However, when Gemini is on the cusp (or something) then they taste like they have nothing in them.  On the other hand, the saki bombers are a pretty good deal.  So, you ask, why give it 4 stars and keep going?  The food!  The Happy Hour menu has half off of individual pizzas, several different sushi rolls, fish or chicken tacos, calamari, and more.  In general, 6 of us go at a time.  We eat until at we are all stuffed, and drink until at least three of us are blowing about 0.06--or more.  And the bill INCLUDING tax and a 20% tip, NEVER goes above $140.00.  Special recommendations:  The calamari, spicy tuna rolls, california rolls (ask for no mayo on them), and the fish tacos.  If you are a serious avocado fan, they have an avocado eggroll, but I am seriously warning you, there are 4 halves on the plate and you absolutely will not be able to eat all 4.  They are just too rich.  I want to go NOW, but happy hour doesn't start until 3.  Let me mention a few other things that I like about it, but that might turn you off--or on, you never know.  The HH specials are only available on the patio or in the bar.  The Patio overlooks the valet parking.  This, in particular, is one of my favorite things.  I once saw a guy completely dressed in red from head to foot--seriously, red cap to red shoes, get out of a red Rolls Royce with Burberry headrests and red leather upholstery.  I'm still laughing.  I also get to see great classics, awesome Ferraris, etc....  Oh, and the bathroom is pretty far away downstairs. I actually like this since I get to walk through the entire restaurant and people-watch."}
{"text":"Thank you James! KG had a great party tonight with delicious food, sushi and desserts. We spent a hilarious evening with Bruce S and Barbara. David, who doesn't really like sushi, enjoyed the hamburger slider that Barb got for him. I wish I had seen Kevin to thank him. What a great staff and beautiful environs not to mention that the food is incredible. The makeover of the place is phenomenal. Good job everyone! A wonderful place to spend time at Fashion Square!!!"}
{"text":"Say this is my first time at desert ridge Kona Grill. I've always liked Kona grill but the atmosphere here seems to be far superior than the other Kona Grills I've been to. The service is great, it's happy hour all day. And the food is absolutely delicious. I will definitely recommend this to my friends. I will definitely be coming back again."}
{"text":"One word to describe our experience at Kona Grill: horrendous. First off, we were left waiting at the host stand for around five minutes before anyone even looked our way. Once seated, our waitress walked by us without any sign of acknowledgment. She walked by a second time and asked if we wanted menus. Well yeah that's kind of the expectation when you come to a restaurant. She seemed annoyed with us from the moment we sat down. But the main issue occurred when spotted a strange pink coloring in the cream cheese of our Philadelphia rolls.  It very closely resembled the pink mold that commonly forms on cream cheese. When we told our waitress about this, she did say she would get us a new order if we \"didn't feel comfortable\" with the order, but completely dismissed the possibility  of it being mold and spoke in an extremely condescending tone the entire time. I tried to tell her that I had gotten moldy cream cheese from the store exactly like it but was told that it was \"completely different\". And once she brought the new order out, she deemed it necessary to pull out her phone and show us a picture of how Philadelphia rolls were prepared, just so we \"could fully understand\". Bottom line: rude waitress+gross food=avoid this place."}
{"text":"The chicken broccoli stir fry was ok, not great. However, the sushi, seaweed salad and smoked gouda fondue that our table shared were all excellent. Service was superb."}
{"text":"Just left Kona Grill on High Street and I have never left a restaurant so confused and unsatisfied. I have been coming to Kona at least once every other week for the last year. I always sit at the bar because I always receive great service but tonight I was appalled. The service was amazing but the vibe is gone. Happy hour has been cut by one hour which isn't a big deal but the usual Wednesday crowd has completely dissipated leaving one feeling awkward and unwelcome. My friends and I were extremely disappointed to find that our Wednesday girls night frozen margaritas are no longer a thing but have been replaced with an awful spicy mai tai atrocity... don't try it you will vomit. Quit trying to make spicy drinks a thing it's not a thing. ON TOP OF THAT! My Mac chicken, literally the staple of the entree menu, is now nothing but glorified chicken nuggets, my friend had the stir fry which is now on a square plate leaving her to try and mix it with out success causing half of her dinner to be tossed across the bar top. To compile our awful experience the music is atrocious. I had a list open of the mishmash of songs that seemed to come off of a bipolar 90s pop alternative playlist of which most songs were unrecognizable they were so outdated - gotye-somebody that I used to know; pink- just give me a reason; THE MACARENA- ; Green Day- wake me up when September ends; scissor sisters - take your mama; puddle of mud- blurry; Texas - great Romances; Al Jarreu- it's how you say it; Beyoncé - check on it and then Kanye ... overall the music was outdated, incredibly depressing and definitely put me out of the mood to have a good time and stay for another round... the vibe I previously got here is gone. This PERFECT date night and girls night spot is no longer an option, I can't wait for them to go back to their vibe and menu they had a month ago but until then I do not plan on returning."}
{"text":"Came here today at 4pm on a Saturday, Sat in the open seating couches next to the bar. It took 8 mins to get our two blue moons as the servers were all in the back talking the entire time. As I watch my beer at the bar. I was sitting to the bar for goodness sake. I'm a server and this place is too small for a beer to take 8 mins. I got my beer at the same time as my food. I could've just gone to the bar myself."}
{"text":"Great service and awesome sushi! The ambiance is low key and they have a mix of fusion dishes and sushi. My friend got the sunshine roll and I got the coconut shrimp roll. Both were fantastic. The service was fast and very friendly, I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"I had the most amazing meal and sweetest bartender today! I'm pretty sure his name is Pat. He started my Monday off with a delicious glass of wine and cucumber salad with some seared tuna. I was feeling something light so he highly recommended one of the rolls wrapped in cucumber. It was amazing! If you have a case of the Mondays, come here for lunch to see Pat!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this spot for lunch since we were at the mall. The service was good but the sushi was just ok. Not sure why we decided to have sushi at a grill? Lol! Started with the calamari, which was great. Not rubbery and had great flavor. We then ordered the wave and the king crab roll. Nothing to write home about but I'm sure we'll give it another shot and try something else the next time."}
{"text":"Damn you Kona for taking the Pan Asian noodles off your menu. Now there really isn't anything for vegans here. Who the heck wants pasta with marinara sauce at an Asian place? Dumb. Not recommended if you're vegan or vegetarian...pretty much limited to a vegetarian roll. Boo!!!!!!! The service was ok...took kinda long to get our food but I think that was due to my boyfriend ordering the lobster mac and cheese. I ordered an avocado roll, which was tasty...I paired it with gluten free soy sauce, which isn't as salty. The lobster mac n cheese was kind of a small portion and was lacking on the cheese. It did have generous chunks of lobster in it. They use frozen lobster meat, however. Overall it was a decent dish. I just wish the pan Asian noodles were still on the menu. It would have also been nice if the server checked to see if the chef could still make it. Since posting this review, the owner contacted me and told me that they could make something very similar. I wish the server went and checked. Oh well. Kona is still a good spot for drinks and sushi."}
{"text":"I always have what seems to be \"normal\" service; but not this time!!!! I went to Kona to meet up with a few friends and in the blazing heat of summer, I decided to sit outside amongst every table full of other patrons. I arrived alone and the host guided me outside to \"seat myself\" when I arrived I made eye contact with 4 servers who didn't appear very busy. 20 minutes later still not one server asked me if I even wanted a water. I then went up to the host and asked if she could send someone over. Very nicely. She said no problem they will be right over. Then the girls show up. I explained to them still no service I was parched. We gave them 10 more minutes and then asked the bartender to send someone. 10 minutes again. Still no menu, no waters, no service!!!!! They came from far and suggested Kona over many of others!! Never ever ever again! We got up and walked out!"}
{"text":"What a lovely experience. Friend was in from Kona (HI) and our group had such a good time, great food, super server. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour, if you can find a spot! It gets so packed! Large happy hour selection though. Love the chicken skewers...it sounds basic and they are everywhere...but, for whatever reason, their chicken skewers are the best!!"}
{"text":"I enjoy the sushi and the atmosphere at Kona Grill.  The pizza's pretty good too, despite its west-coast style.  I really like the fish tanks and the indoor/outdoor area.  A wonderful date-place."}
{"text":"The sauce with the calamari was ridiculously spicy. I requested rings only and none of the calamari with heads and legs but they refused  to do this for me and I ended up throwing half the order out because the little bodies creep me out.  It may have been the same sauce they use on the pork sliders because they were also extremely spicy, and I like a little bite to my food .The waitress was snotty and wouldn't let me use my Yelp  check in coupon. Overall I was disappointed with the experience. This was the San Tan Mall location. I've had much better experiences at the Chandler Mall location. They have no problem seperating the calamari for me. I also think the food tastes better at the Chandler Mall. They must have a better chef."}
{"text":"2.5 stars at best. Went there for happy hour last week and really nothing special...We walk in and they tell us happy hour is only available at the bar or outside, contrary to Pita Jungle where beers are $3-4, service is GREAT, you can sit anywhere and food is great"}
{"text":"Yummy.  Went to happy hour with the husband and it was delicious as always.  Had the vegetarian roll and spicy shrimp roll.  Husband had the spicy shrimp roll and California roll.  Shared the calamari.  Easy to get a seat on a Monday at 4:30, but difficult at other times.  We've been here a lot and love it!"}
{"text":"Here was the question that vexed me during my meal: why was I paying 50% more than most poke places for half as much poke? It's not like the poke was particularly distinguished. Not terrible, just so-so and overpriced. There are definitely better options around."}
{"text":"Great pit stop for lunch. Good, light food and really good drinks."}
{"text":"The California roll was good. Adding some hot sauce will make it spectacular. The jumbalaya is amazing with just the right spices. I like the happy hour menu with the sample appetizer. Ambience is very romantic. Our waiter was a bit busy. Sitting outside in the fall time is awesome as long as there's no wind."}
{"text":"The food didn't knock me off my feet. The service was great and atmosphere was enjoyable, but for the price I think there are better options."}
{"text":"I had a pretty good meal here at Kona Grill.  I was really hungry and was really ready to eat anything.    Good Sushi.  They had a lot to offer and by sifting through, I settled with the thai chicken wrap. It needed more a kick to it.  They sometimes have seasonal offerings - - I did not have this but I will be getting the soft shell crab po boy next time I go."}
{"text":"The Kona Grill in Boca Park never disappoints. The service is consistently courteous, attentive and meticulous.   Tonight, the Kona Grill hostess and server accommodated our needs to ensure we had a peaceful and fun dinner with our children. We requested seating in a booth, away from other patrons. We ordered beverages, appetizers and meals for the children immediately. We received considerate and swift service from our server and the kitchen chefs. Every detail was attended to with finesse.  On our table tonight was Kona Calamari with Spicy Aioli ($11), Chili Lime Shrimp Salad ( roasted corn, cucumbers, red onions, tomatoes, avocado, sautéed mushrooms, wonton strips, honey lime dressing $15), voodoo roll spicy crawfish mix, avocado, habanero tuna mix, smelt roe and picasso roll spicy yellowtail mix, avocado, yellowtail, jalapeño cilantro relish, togarashi, sriracha, yuzu ponzu. The child's menu includes an entree, two sides and beverage for $6.50. I appreciate the choices like carrot sticks, rice and sweet potatoes (and there are more choices). I posted a photo under Tips.  The Kona Grill is true to its mission to provide a pleasant environment with fresh foods to \"create an upscale ambiance that reinforces our high standards of food and service\" (Kona Grill website quote).   Wish List: Bring ORGANIC rice, juice, and other items to the menu."}
{"text":"Management needs to read their yelp reviews. Like every other low rating on here- I'm giving one star because of the horrible horrible awful no good terrible service I received at this location. My friend and I were told by the hostess that the patio was open seating and someone would be out shortly with menus to help us. At least ten minutes had to have gone by before the manager asked if we were being helped. Shortly after a server finally showed up, shoved menus in our faces and asked if we were ready to order... of course we replied that we needed a few minutes to look over the menu... 15 minutes later and he finally returns- no apologies whatsoever for the time lapse. We had contemplated during this time just leaving and going somewhere else but he showed up before we were completely fed up. We ordered food and drinks, and then waited. Again. Another 15 minutes or so and the table next to us that had been seated probably 30 minutes after us received their drinks. We were fed up and left. No one even acknowledged the fact that we stood up and left.  Now we know why the restaurant was 3/4 empty with no wait on a Saturday at 7pm in Scottsdale Quarter. Never again with this location."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I decided to come here last night for our first time since we heard it's the best happy hour in town and it was our engagement anniversary. I had heard about their lettuce wraps and Picasso roll and boy did they not disappoint-Spicy but flavorful! Thank you to Charlene for the recommendation of the carrot cake and taking care of it out of pocket! Sweetest manager I've come across. More welcoming than our own server! We will be back... more Charlene please!!"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Kona grill's dining concept and how consistent the franchise is in a the locations I have visited. I do have to say this time my experience was nothing to rave about. I will start out by complimenting the frozen margaritas which always deliver in taste and alcohol content for their very fair happy hour pricing of $5 dollars. I ordered the avocado egg rolls which are one of my favorite appetizers on their menu. The egg rolls wee not crispy as usual and the avocado tasted a bit on the stale side. The calamari was another fail as it was way ok salty and I was surprised at the fact that it came out of the kitchen within less than five minutes. Makes me wonder if I got a calamari order that was cancelled and sag on their kitchen until I ordered it. Also our waitress was not very friendly. I understand that servers are very overwhelmed during happy hour settings however the place was not busy to where she could have taken sometime to get to know us and be a bit more friendly. I am just going on previous experiences and how awesome their servers tend to be. I also ordered their flatbread pepperoni pizza which to me was very reminiscent of a \"lunchables\" pizza lunch. My humble suggestion to this establishment is to pay close attention to their food item consistency specially the staples that people love and come back for. I will be coming back and hope to see improvements."}
{"text":"Met friends here for the first time.  Didn't know what to expect.  It's fabulous!!!  Sat outside on the patio during Happy Hour.  Had great drinks, the food is amazing.  I still can't believe the bill for 6 people was only $115.  We ate till we were all full and enough drinks AND dessert.  What more can I say?  Sweet & Spicy Shrimp are a standout.  But everything was good.  No complaints.  The Fudge Brownie dessert is enough for at least 4 people."}
{"text":"YUM, YUM, YUM, YUM, YUM!   I was in Vegas for the weekend with a friend, and both of us were craving protein. We went out for steaks 2 nights previous, so we were looking for a good place for fish or sushi.   After a quick search on Yelp, I suggested Kona Grill. Based on the reviews by fellow yelpers, I thought it sounded right up our alley. Plus, I LOVE Asian Fusion. We were not disappointed!   My friend had never had sushi, so at the recommendation of our server I ordered the Houston roll. Tuna, Cream Cheese, & Jalapeno wrapped in soy paper. She loved loved loved it!! So much in fact that she has texted me several times with a sushi craving! Yipeee!   BFF ordered the Lemon Grass crusted Halibut. Fabulous!   I ordered the Pan Seared Ahi. It was covered in a sweet chili sauce and seared to perfection. Served with steamed rice and sauteed spinach. Aside from the rice (wish it had been brown), I devoured it. Woulda licked the plate clean if I could have!!   Definitely try this place, I don't think you'll be disappointed."}
{"text":"Kona Grill is pretty convenient for me since I live on the west side and dread going downtown or anywhere east of the I-15. The happy hour prices are good and the ambiance is nice. i like the fact that their happy hour is not overwhelmed by 1,000 sweaty people mushed into a crowded space. I'm not really fond of the fact that it seems a bit like a meat market. At least I can sit at a high top with my girlfriends and not be bothered."}
{"text":"Hadn't been here in awhile other than a few happy hours for sushi. I used to eat here a lot for lunches, as well as frequent trips for the macadamia nut chicken.   I went here with my friend who when we were dating loved the macadamia nut chicken, so we dropped in Saturday night around 730pm. They must have had a huge kids party because the place was packed with kids and parents, and had a buffet style set up in the middle of the room. It was ending, so the noise level went from loud to quiet in about 20 minutes.  Ordered the mac nut chicken, with extra shoyu cream sauce. The chicken came out with very little sauce on it, and a minuscule amount of mango sauce. Lots of garlic chunks in the garlic mashed that really overwhelmed the potatoes. The veggies tasted a little burnt. The chicken was not as moist as before. I was actually pretty disappointed with the meal as prices have inched up, and meal quality has gone down.  Kudos to our server Jason who was fantastic and did everything right. Too bad he doesn't cook lol"}
{"text":"Interior: 10/10, Food: 9/10, Service: 9/10.  I lived in Hawai'i for a few years and miss the Asian inspired Pacific style dishes. Like fellow Yelper, Jennifer, mentioned, Kona is very similar to Roy's.  The huge fish tanks and interior of this place is very nice.  The food is awesome! I'm addicted and could eat here every day.  I only wish the portions were a bit larger.  Would I go back? Every time I have a chance."}
{"text":"I came in And told them I was interested in watching the soccer game. I asked them if there was a TV showing the match. They told me they could put the soccer match on for me. I was early so I just told them to put the channel on. I ordered my food ate it and was presented a check. They never change the channel for me. When I got up and left I saw the TV by the exit had the soccer channel on. Thanks guys. Now I will find another place to watch the game. I could have ordered drinks after my meal.."}
{"text":"This is such a fun place to hang out in summerlin Las Vegas especially since they redid the balcony! Some of our favorite dishes are the pesto chicken pasta (that they got rid of ), margarita flat bread pizza, chicken rice bowl, and they have some good sushi rolls. The happy hour menu actually includes some sushi and the flatbread. The drinks are already affordable but even better during happy hour."}
{"text":"The food is pretty consistent which is always nice and I'm glad that they finally changed their mixed veggies on the Macadamia nut Chicken. The issues that I have are the really weak drinks (don't even bother ordering a cosmo or margarita, especially since the drinks next door at Z are amazing), and the not so great eye candy behind the bar (which has been in place for years). I mean seriously people, really? If they were more personable I may overlook it but they really have nothing to offer that makes me want to belly up. Table please!"}
{"text":"This place has a great environment and the best happy hour deals. :) The bartenders are super friendly and are very helpful in suggesting new foods to try. I come here several times a week just because the environment is so welcoming."}
{"text":"I can only attest to their happy hour, as I have never eaten their sushi.   With respect to their drink specials, they have a nice variety of different spirits with moderate pricing. They have sake bomb kits which consist of the traditional small bottle of warm sake and a large bottle of Kirin or Kirin light. I take issue with them only offering Kirin as the complementing beer for the sake, but beggars can't be choosers. If you're on the southwest side of town, I recommend 808 sushi for sake bombs. ($6 for Whatever beer you prefer and the warm sake, whereas here it is $7.50 with only Kirin). Their sake sangria is tasty and refreshing. Their margarita is a margarita. (Tautological)   I like their food specials. I recommend either the flatbread or the chicken/shrimp lettuce wraps. Most of these food specials can certainly be shared.   The ambience is nice and if it isn't too hot, the patio is a nice place to relax. Overall I think one can enjoy their experience here either after a long day after work or as a fancy way of pre-gaming. Disfrute!"}
{"text":"Came here on Sunday afternoon after taking a fitness class in the mall and we were pleasantly surprised that it was HH menu in the bar/patio area. We ordered the calamari and two rolls. The rolls were good and actually so filling we couldn't even finish them. The only thing I disliked was that mayo/sauce stuff they put on top. I'd definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Incredible food and service. I had the fish tacos and my wife had the shrimp tempura. Both over the top. I also had the crab crunch roll....Yummmmy. This place never lets us down..."}
{"text":"Great place for a late dinner.  Even though we arrived after 8pm on a week night, the place was still humming.  The sushi chefs were busy and the bar was noisy.  But our dining area was quiet enough for conversation -- nice.  My husband enjoyed his Cuban sandwich and I had the Sushi Sampler.  Both servings were very generous and delicious.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Came here with my mom while we were on vacation and the name caught our eye! We're from Hawaii, so we're familiar with the name Kona Grill (I believe there's one in Waikiki).   Anyways, this place has a fair amount of food items at a reasonable price. It's probably around $10 and up. They had a sushi bar, so a part of their menu focuses on different types of sushi. My mom got a salad and I got the sushi sampler. I wish it never ended!! It was so good! We also got a thin pizza to share and that was very tasty!   Our waiter was very nice, and he made us feel welcomed. He also suggested a few of his favorites. They have a good atmosphere and it's located in the mall, so you can walk your food off after."}
{"text":"First time at Kona Grill and it will definitely not be out last.  Excellent and fast service, our server Taylor was amazing and constantly checked up on us which we loved.  My partner and always try calamari from new places so of course we had order the calamari. I was a bit unsatisfied with the amount of calamari that was served however the calamari it self was delicious."}
{"text":"What can you say. It's Kona Grill. Have been coming here since they first opened. Can't believe I've never review this place. My friends family started this chain and it is still good for sushi and their entrees are tasty. Personally my favorites are the macadamia nut crusted chicken and the New York steak. They also have a daily happy hour from 3 to 6 and all day on Sunday with good food and drink specials."}
{"text":"I have been coming here since this place opened and I know they have been sold but they still do a great all around job. Great Happy Hour and good consistent food served for lunch and dinners. Happy Hour has great food and drinks specials and gets pretty busy on Thurs and Friday. A good spot to come if you are at the Fashion Square."}
{"text":"Ordered the salmon salad and the avocado egg rolls everything was delicious great happy hour from 4-7 and great staff. Will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Yuck!!!  What kind of generic ass Japanese restaurant is this??!!  I think it's supposed to be some type of asian fusion??  The feel of Kona is very commercialized and seemed like it fell into the category of being 'just another chain restaurant.'    My BF and I were in the beautiful Boca Park area doing some shopping and was getting hungry for dinner.  Being that we're always trying to find new joints to eat at, I saw this place, looked it up on yelp, saw that there were awesome reviews, and suggested we try it.  From what I remember, it is a rather large restaurant with a lot of seating.  I was overwhelmed by the amount of food they offered.  The layout of the menu really reminded me of like an Elephant Bar or Cheesecake factory.  They had a bunch of random ass dishes that consisted of things such as: pizzas, flatbreads, egg-rolls, pot-stickers, salads, noodles, sushi.  Well, we passed on the dinner menu and leaned towards sushi since thats what I thought this place was.    Their sushi menu is a big fat joke.  My BF started off with a $6 seaweed salad that was served on a big ass plate.  I kid you not, the amount of seaweed they put on there was the size of a fucking tablespoon.  I may be exaggerating a bit but I was damn disappointed with the quantity placed before us.  I really felt like they straight took $6 out of my pocket.  Robbed!!! Don't bother with this dish.  We also ordered some salmon sashimi pieces ($9.50), sushi rolls/hand rolls, and one of their chef's plate: a yellowtail jalapeno sashimi with ponzu and cilantro ($11.00).  What a disgrace to Japanese food.  This shit tasted horrible.  I cannot believe the quality of fish they used.  It was cut funny and left a horrible aftertaste.  I didn't bother eating any of the sashimi dishes after the first bite.  I also ordered a side of rice and had to return it twice.  How do you mess up rice??  The first bowl he brought out was hard and dry as hell.  Eww!!  I can't believe they served that, it was not even edible.  You can tell it's been sitting in the cooker for a while.  He brought out another bowl and it was the exact same thing so I passed on it.  To make things worse our server was rude.  He didn't do much and I had to wave him down to keep him updated on the status of our dining experience (ie. rice, drinks, blah).  For the most part he just took our order, brought us our bill, we paid, then bounced.   Never Again."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place, the service has always been really nice...but this is the 3rd time I've been here and my drinks were weak and the sushi watery.   Sangria tastes like koolaid. I'm sure it's the mixer they use, but way too fruity and really skimpy on the cheap wine. Which I'm convinced is boxed wine and not from a bottle. It's just like bad juice.   The sushi never seems to be on point, always a let down. Asked for the spiciest roll they made and wound up with a sriracha overkill rice roll with some canned jalapeños on top. Yuck. My friend finished it, but I sure wasn't going to eat another bite. The salmon roll was just ok.   Also, weekends in the bar area are brutal. It gets packed with corvette driving mid life crisis men and pretentious wannabe Real Housewives types and I've found the service takes a dive as well.   Sorry Aloha Grill. I think we're done here."}
{"text":"I really enjoy Kona Grill, they have a wide variety of foods to choose from."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant, mediocre food. Not a lot of options for vegetarians/picky eaters. My friend had the sushi and she said it was good! My food (barbecue sliders) were too spicy and definitely overpriced."}
{"text":"For a high-end restaurant, I felt like I actually got my money's worth.  The cocktails were good.  The smoked Gouda fondue was phenomenal.  I probably just could have eaten one of those by myself for dinner.  I had the jambalaya, which was the perfect and amount of spicy and delicious.  Ashley had the Pad Thai which she loved.  Luckily we had gift cards, but we felt it would be a good place for an anniversary dinner or special occasion."}
{"text":"If this review were based on the food alone, it'd probably be a 4 star.  Most things I've had here have been very good.  The only thing that I remember disliking were the sliders during happy hour... they were just bland, flavorless and undercooked for what I specified.  I generally get pretty bad service here, though, and that's where the 2 star rating comes from.  There's always something that happens that makes me say wtf?  One time I had to say excuse me multiple times to a group of servers blocking the entry way between the patio and the inside when I was trying to go to the bathroom.  They were just in their own world, chit chatting and being oblivious.  Another time, our waiter was mostly AWOL from our table and we repeatedly had to flag down other servers to ask where ours was.   It wasn't particularly busy, so no clue what the deal was.  Another time we were seated outside and it was cold... we requested that they turn on the heat lamps but were told it wasn't in their budget to have them on during that time of year.  Another time there was this obviously intoxicated man floating around from table to table in the patio area trying to chat up female customers.  When he went to the bar, the bartender high fived him and served him another shot.  I just feel like they could do a lot more here to improve the customer experience and act like they give a shit.  The food is good and it's wasted on an establishment with subpar, unprofessional staff."}
{"text":"I've always had good service at Kona Grill and the food is usually very good. I usually will get sushi there. The Gilbert location is very good and even getting lunch there can be quick for a restaurant! I really enjoy Kona Grill!"}
{"text":"My large party was taken care of pretty quickly, but it was a Monday so it wasn't very busy.  Our server was attentive and patient.  We started with the calamari, nothing extraordinary but tasty still.  The macadamia chicken was so delicious, this is definitely a must to order.  The skirt steak with chimichurri sauce was good.  Our kids loved the presentation of their kids bento box meal.  They took the time to make a panda out of their orange, it was real cute and fun for the kids.  The servings were pretty big and the atmosphere was cool, since the bar is open to the outside.  Great time!"}
{"text":"Great location for people watching.  Get there early before it gets packed.  Reasonable drink and sushi prices during happy hour.  Valet instead of park."}
{"text":"What a disappointment.  I went there with a group of co workers and the place was nearly empty and nowhere near closing time.  Our server (who said she hates AZ and it showed in her attitude and service) said she can't wait to finish school and head back to Illinois.  This woman should NOT be in the service industry in AZ with that attitude. Good riddance when your schooling is through.    Not only was there a (what looked to be a dish washer who will now be terrified about being deported with the new AZ immigration law) making our sushi,  the sushi was a huge lump of rice and a thin slice of fish, you don't do that when you are paying full price for sushi.  I eat sushi weekly and there have been some hits and misses and this place was a big MISS.  Another chain restaurant that doesn't get it and just hopes for the masses to fill their tables at the mall and who don't know good sushi.  Avoid this place Yelper's, avoid it.   WOW, VERY INTERESTING.  I LOOKED AT THE KONA GRILL WEBSITE AND THAT SAME WAITRESS MENTIONED ABOVE (DARK LOW CUT TOP) IS IN A FEW OF THE PICTURES IN THE HOME PAGE MONTAGE. HUMMMM,  MAYBE SHE'S AN OUT OF WORK ACTRESS / MODEL.  THOSE ARE THE MOST BITTER TYPES HERE IN LOS ANGELES AND THEY ARE GENERALLY FOOD SERVERS.  SHE CERTAINLY CONNED SOMEONE THERE IN SCOTTSDALE."}
{"text":"Our server John gave us the best service we have ever had at any restaurant in the area. We hope to have him again next time. Avacado egg roll are wonderful, the Picasso roll is perfect but wasn't to impress with the spicy tempura shrimp. The make the best appletini there."}
{"text":"I went here last week and was so disappointed. After the remodel I didn't get in right away to try it, and was super exploited when I was going. The food was good, my friend got the bbq chicken pizza and I got a salad, but the service was horrible. We waited at least ten minutes or more for drinks and then she disappeared another ten minutes to get our food order. The manager helped more than the actual waitress, and it wasn't crazy busy. I'll probably give it another try, but if the service is the same I definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"Pro: food here are decent.  Con: long wait for food even when the restaurant is less than half full, waited 20+ minutes for a medium cook burger.  The soda I order is very watered down.  Also tips are mandatory even when I m in party of 4.  It's not like I m not gonna tip, but feel weird that the server ask me to choose to tip between 3 options, which is 15, 18 or 20%"}
{"text":"I've been here several times and the sushi is always fresh and the service is always good!  I had the Angry Edamame, which is super spicy and super delish!  I also had smoked salmon and tuna nigiri and the Atlantic and Spicy Tuna rolls.  My friend ordered the salmon meal, which he enjoyed, and I picked the broccoli off his plate and it was REALLY good!  LOL!"}
{"text":"This is THE SPOT for happy hour. Kids are welcome but ONLY in the patio. The potstickers and ahi wonton crisps are my fav's. Chase it down w/a glass of house chard and call it a day. Beware of the cougar's and the men dressed in Ed Hardy/Affliction gear. LOL"}
{"text":"Disappointed after a terrific first visit. Wait staff is friendly and efficient. Trouble is the food. My sea bass came out incredibly fast and I know why. The fish was Pre-cooked and re-warmed. Same for the fried rice which was so dry as to be tasteless. The salsa is equally bad. Didn't look or taste fresh. I keep hearing Vegas has an amazing food scene. Ah, where is it?"}
{"text":"This place was great! Food was Phenomenal and the staff was wonderful, I'll definitely be back and bring my family back here to try it out as well."}
{"text":"3 stars for the food, 2 for the service. Waitress was in attentive and so absent that we enlisted the busboy to get soy sauce, chopsticks and wine for us! When he brought the entrees out He even fixed our wobbly table - something our waitress again failed to do. Great busboy btw  Miso soup was not what we remembered but sushi and pad Thai were good."}
{"text":"Went there late Saturday afternoon before the dinner crowd rush and wasn't entirely blown away by the experience.   We sat outside, and despite being worried the misters were going to be overbearing it was pleasant. One thing that was not OK, was that all the outdoor tables have a VERY sticky finish on them. I kept my menu to rest my forearms on because it felt as if the table was covered in dried Coca-Cola.  The appetizers, we got the beef tacos, were AMAZING. They were served in a flakey, croissant-like shell that I'm still dreaming about.  I ordered a burger and my girlfriend ordered the chicken avocado sandwich. Both were good but nothing that would make them the greatest we've tried.  Service was below par. Our server was not very knowledgeable. She did not know if their sushi was made with fresh of farmed fish (all of their sushi is FARM fish), did not know what size patty came on the burger (they claim 12oz) and she failed to return often to check on us. My water class had a chip in it, when our food was delivered (by the manager for some reason - I hate it when they do this eg order with the waitress, but somebody else delivers?!) we asked for an extra serving of ketchup from the manager...who never returned only to be seen two tables away chatting with a young lady.  We will go back for the tacos, but that's about it..."}
{"text":"I had the chicken and shrimp lettuce wraps.  They were very good, but a little too much sauce.  I also had some asian salad but it was just ok."}
{"text":"I finally tried Kona Grill last weekend after passing by them countless times. I love the look of the restaurant and modern feel to it. Also the bathrooms are beautiful with awesome faucets.... These things matter people.   The food was hit or miss for me. The avacado egg rolls were great but my wife and I were both disappointed by the Caesar salad. The dressing was lite and odd tasting. It wasn't bad but didn't taste like a traditional Caesar salad. For our entrees I got the macadamia nut chicken and was completely blown away. This is a delicious dish and I loved it! I will definitely be coming back for that macadamia nut chicken.   Our waitress was fantastic and they have key lime pie, always a plus in my book. The price of the dinner was high, but we were both very satisfied with the quality of the food. Just fix that Caesar dressing!!!!"}
{"text":"We had lunch here, wow it was wonderful, sushi was excellent, got a free appetizer by just checking in thru Yelp.  Waitress was great, very prompt and attentive.  We will definitely come back I he tuna rocked, hubby had cheeseburger sliders he love them."}
{"text":"It was back to Kona Grill with friends, where Shrimp Tempura featured real small and thin shrimp, but otherwise all was fine.  A bowl of Miso Soup was tasty, and a small Oriental Salad filling.  A well-prepared Rainbow Roll was excellent, and so was Shrimp & Pork-Fried Rice to go with the ever enjoyable entree of moist Miso-Sake Marinated Baked Seabass.  A taste of grilled Ono with Mango Salsa also proved to be moist and delicious.    I washed down my meal with hot Organic Sweet Chamonile Citrus Tea in a cast iron pot, while Diane enjoyed glasses of hard to find IBC Root Beer.  Service was very good except for late transport of the Fried Rice.  Our friends, who had lived for years in Hawaii, greatly enjoyed their dessert of Passion Fruit Creme Brulee (Lilikoi).  This place has proven to be consistently very good through the years, and will continue to be on my list of stalwart restaurants to which I will periodically return."}
{"text":"Great place! Really cool vibe and environment, great service, and killer food! Both sushi and non sushi.  Went Saturday and got really fresh sushi tasted California fresh"}
{"text":"Dont know what the hype is about this place. Kitchen was slow took almost an hour to get sushi and the place was not even half full. Prices are higher than the average sushi restaurant and portions are less. I have had way better sushi with more portions and cheaper prices. Don't think ill be visiting a Kona grill again. First and last time their."}
{"text":"Kona Grill is a super fun relaxed place to enjoy a mighty fine HAPPY HOUR! Their HR is 3-7 which has many great menu options!   We enjoyed the following items!  Avocado egg rolls, 2 orders 8.50 happy hour Crab crunch roll 5.50 happy hour Bbq chicken flatbread 8.50 happy hour Big kahuna cheeseburger w/bacon reg menu item  The food was fantastic!  Our Server Twiggy was the Star of the show! She did not miss a beat, she kept our drink refills going! Her sweet personality was very welcoming and provided for a phenomenal dining experience!  Also Vernice was just as Amazing, a real hands on Manager who was a pleasure to be greeted by!   My husband and I will be back for many more fantastic happy hour date nights!"}
{"text":"We went there for lunch and were only one of two couples at the bar.  We were hurried, pushed, and hassled to order lunch....we like to have a drink before ordering.  Then, a bus boy asked her to change the channel on the TV we were watching to soccer.  She did not even bother to ask us if we were watching.  The bus boy already had another TV on that channel.......we will NEVER go back.............I confronted her about it and she just hum hawed around about it..........I was a restaurant accountant for years and I know how things should be.  She put the help over the customers."}
{"text":"Sushi quality 2 stars of 5 at best.  Portion sizes small in sushi, sashimi. Prices still the same as places that cut large slices of fish.  Prices in general high for this level quality. Don't prefer this as a location for sushi, sashimi, or steak."}
{"text":"Outside atmosphere was really nice. This was my first time there and I enjoyed it. Our food was great. I had a salad and my friend had the filet which looked excellent. It was more pricey than I expected though."}
{"text":"Always a great time I always come here and love they happy hour so amazing I can't wait  to come Soon thanks for the upmost best service ever"}
{"text":"My aunt got me so hooked on this spot they happy hour is lovely and they give u good deals I love it This my I want to have a good drink and lunch spot"}
{"text":"Definitely a \"meh\" experience for my girl and I. We came here in hopes of finding a new awesome places to get sushi when the craving arise, but sadly we will not be coming back due to few reasons. 1) We ordered 3 simple sushi rolls for us to share and it seemed to take way longer than it should've to finally receive them. 2) When they did arrive we were underwhelmed by the small size of these rolls and we both left still hungry, where as other sushi places 3 rolls, shared between us, would easily fill us up... 3) A bathroom says a lot about a business, especially one that is in the food & beverage industry, and when I walked into Kona Grill's restroom it wasn't well maintained at all. There were paper towels over flowing the trash can and many of them ended up on the floor and I wish I could give them credit by saying they were really busy but I can't because we were there when they were at about half capacity and I would hate to be there when they have a full house.... For these reasons we're not coming back nor recommending this place to anyone..."}
{"text":"First time here...friendly hostess..got a gr8 booth..ordered a drink n a couple of dishes..trying the salmon wasabi sashimi..delicious! Does not need soy sauce for the yuzu ponzu sauce worked perfectly with it...lobster n tuna flatbread...also delicious! Jus the right amount of seafood n drizzle of sauce on top...i ate it all by myself it was so good! Recommended by my awesome n cool server, lauren paris, she was super friendly n helpful with menu..thanku! Not only becuz of the awesome food but becuz of the excellent service from her i will be back! I will also be telling all of hawaii, where i'm from, to come here too! Oh n did i mention lauren brought me a creme brulee..on the house! U rock, lauren!!!"}
{"text":"OMG- I wish I remembered my servers name- she was a Spanish girl working on a Thursday day- around 2pm. She was phenomenal!!! So attentive!  She knew that I was in a hurry since I only have an hour lunch- she made sure everything came out fast for me. Who does that? She did. Amazing  The food was amazing- the vegas roll was to die for. definitely not filling but amazing!!!!!!!!!  DEFINITELY WILL BE COMING BACK."}
{"text":"Pretty average food. Clearly the patio is the place to see and be seen. We had a few hiccups with our service but nothing too out of the ordinary for a busy Friday night.  The pricing is what you would expect to pay from a trendy sushi place, my husband and I had an appetizer, a few rolls and drinks for under $40. Like most places, if you go for the specialty rolls you'll take a hit in your wallet. It is a little loud inside, so if youre looking for a quiet meal best to avoid. We did see a family with a little baby so the noise helps out if you wanna save paying a sitter by taking the kids with you."}
{"text":"I never thought I would love a chain so much...but, I do!  The server we had was fantastic. I don't know her name, but she suggested a margarita Las Vegas style and it blew.my.mind.  Pt. 1 of the food: We got the (recommend on the menu) Meatloaf with Mashed Potatoes and Mushrooms - SO GOOD.  We also had the Yellow tail Sashimi with Jalapeno, Vinaigrette and Cilantro. Very flavorful and fresh.   Overall super happy and pleased from start to finish. Fun dining experience with great food. Doesn't get much better.  (A message to the lady below...WHY would you bring your kid into a restaurant where people are smoking on the patio and there's a huge (but gorgeous) bar separating the outside from the inside? I looked at your other reviews...you just like to complain and get free stuff from management. I'm onto you.)"}
{"text":"happy hour is the best. 2 mix drinks an 2 dishes during happy hour will run you only 20 dollars. I think it's a bargain!"}
{"text":"Food was bomb. Service was bomb. The whole experience was bomb. I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"I have always been wanting to go here since I walk by it so often at the mall. The wine rack actually caught my attention to be honest!  So my family and I decide to dine in after another day of shopping. Unfortunately we were not greeted by the hostess who seemed to be having a bad day and an attitude. She was definitely not a good first impression of the restaurant. Her name is Maritza.  As we begin ordering the suggested items from our server (which were great by the way) He actually did not put in my husbands main entree order correctly when we asked for no onions. We told him that he is allergic to them. Still, they were all over his plate. Though, we just sent it back and got offered something else, which was the least they could've done... These special requests should be taken more seriously in such a nice establishment as this. I was pretty surprised but thankfully everything was ok. Besides that, we did really enjoy the flavors and textures in the food we got but the service could have been better."}
{"text":"This is my go-to restaurant/bar when at Fashion Square. They have an awesome happy hour menu that also includes Sunday. Great drink and food deals- woo-woo! Plus their food is delicious and always fresh. Good job, Kona Grill, keep it up and I'll keep coming back."}
{"text":"What you get for the money is pretty good, especially with this place located on the strip. When I went it was more staff than people eating. I would definitely go again."}
{"text":"went here last night with friends for a late day after Birthday Dinner. Never eaten here before but glad we did, the staff was amazing, friendly wishing me and another friend Happy Birthday while we were there & on our way out. The food was very good, I had the Macadamia Nut Chicken... WOW!  Will definitely be coming back & highly recommend to friends here in Vegas & those from out of town."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and food and the A+ customer service received by manager Erica Meacham was immeasurable, she went above and beyond to make sure my sister's wedding rehearsal cocktail party was successful, she communicated well and followed through until the day of the event. Thank you again Erica, also the servers on the date of event were wonderful and so helpful."}
{"text":"Back after they were closed for a long time for a remodel. I got some bad news for you regulars- happy hour prices went UP! It was bound to happen. That remodel looks pricey! A second story was added and the previously dark dining room is now open and more complementary to the bar area.  What used to be half price rolls are now $4.50 and specialty rolls $10 during happy hour. New happy hour menu items include lobster & tuna flatbread and BBQ flatbread. I think a few of the rolls are new too. I had the Kona chopped salad while we dined on the patio during my latest visit. The dressing was a bit overwhelming (honey mustard) and something more tangy would be my choice next time. There was a ton of chicken in the salad so props. Not too bad for $14. My white wine wasn't very cold so that happened. No props.  Gone are the awkward metal chairs and tables from the patio and in their place are stylish and softer chairs and tables and some firepit seating as well! Nice. Looks like Kona is set to remain Summerlin's best and most popular happy hour spot."}
{"text":"I would give 0 stars but that's not an option. I'd say horrible service except we didn't even get any. I couldn't even get anyone to come up front to seat me even after asking for help and waitresses walking by looking at me but not one person asking if I've been helped. I walked out and took my service elsewhere bc clearly they didn't want it here."}
{"text":"Thanks for your no service... We were seated and sat there for 15 minutes with not a single server to come by to get us drinks or our order. It wasn't busy at all and all the servers just stood around and when we stood up to leave is when someone came to follow us out apologizing for the not being attended to... Sorry it's a bit late. This location needs to work on better service"}
{"text":"The food was all pretty good, we got the seared ahi, sea bass, oriental salad, and meatloaf. Good portions and good flavor and for my mom's birthday they even brought out a huge passion fruit creme brûlée which was pretty delicious. Everything was good except the atmosphere with the staff. Our female waiter would go talk to her friends who were seated in the restaurant near us and I can hear her bad mouthing previous customers and just nonsense that shouldn't be happening near other customers. A lot of the staff were standing around and talking and we felt a little awkward dining."}
{"text":"I have been here nearly 50 times so why do I only give \"Kona,\" as we call it,  three stars?  The food is ok, their drinks are typical and the service is either fantastic or terrible.  What keeps me coming back is the patio and the friends I share it with.  The outdoor seating is wonderful.  You get to enjoy fresh air while you sit and chat with your friends; this is a rarity in Vegas.  Due to the hot temperatures, you can be hard pressed to find a place with outdoor setting.  Kona Grill has their patio open year round so you can enjoy something other than a stale indoor environment with recycled air.  I have NEVER eaten inside, it's not what you go to Kona for.  The food can be hit or miss here.  I have found their appetizers to be more consistent than their dinners.  Servers come and go relatively quickly.  This could be because of the amazing deals they have on food/drinks; the low prices create low tips and people sit and campout at tables for hours.  Servers aren't getting tipped on full price items.  If you have ever worked industry you know this is great for your guests but sucks for your bankroll.     Kona Grill is a place you go to happy hour with your girlfriends, hit up for a mid-afternoon snack and cocktail on the weekend, or take a date you're not too sure about yet.  It's relaxed, well priced and there are plenty people to gawk at.  In Summerlin you have a lot of big players and big tits running around acting like they're still in their 20's.  Fun to watch if sports isn't your thing or your date is boring you.    As for the menu... pick something, it will be mediocre like most everything else is on the menu.  The food won't make you sick but it won't knock your socks off either!  If you're into an outside atmosphere more than memorable food and drinks than Kona is for you.  Bring a friend, grab a drink, enjoy their company and the show."}
{"text":"My friend said she's been to the location in Texas and really liked it so we decided to come during NYE for dinner and it was absolutely delicious, albeit on the pricier side.  A friend and I shared: Pork potstickers, Voodoo sushi roll, Spider roll, and Checker Board roll. This was definitely too much food for two people, I would suggest ordering only 3 dishes. My favorite items were definitely the Potstickers and the Spider Roll. If you can see the picture, the potstickers were sooo round and cute--they definitely weren't skimpy with the fillings and it was soo meaty and delicious! In terms of the rolls, they were all pretty good, but I thought the Voodoo Roll was the most unique because I've never had anything similar in the past. Something about the roll made it super 'Mexican'...perhaps it was the habanero? You'll have to try it and let me know.   The service here was amazing--our server was such a sweetheart and even though she had to work on NYE there were no signs of annoyance (unlike everyone else we encountered that same day). I didn't catch her name but she was super attentive and took really good care of us. Overall I had a great experience at this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Kona Grill is located in Boca Park.  We sat at the bar located on the open area patio side.  Nice atmosphere- and a variety of menu items-  we tried a couple of appetizers, although I was not overly impressed- I was definitely not disappointed either. Service was good- overall, we had a great time!"}
{"text":"Had the best salad EVER!! Ordered the macadamia chicken crusted salad with egg and bacon. So delicious. Also had octopus sushi which was great. The salad was also huge. Underestimated how much it brought. And they were NOT shy with the chicken it was definitely an entire chicken breast."}
{"text":"Came back for Happy Hour and sat outside in the patio area....LOVELY!!! and happy hour is the best time to go! $5 bottles of sake, and half priced food items :) Fun fun!"}
{"text":"I was thrilled to come here for my first time to celebrate a milestone in my life. The atmosphere was lovely, the servers were nice, the food was good...I was with a large party, and we ended up sitting at the table for a VERY long time after dinner waiting for our bill. We had enjoyed some drinks and had plans to continue on to another location. Sitting at the table for upwards of 20 minutes for our bill really killed the mood. If it wasn't for the wait, I would have given them a much higher rating. Given the amount we spent as a group, I expected to have better service."}
{"text":"I am not a fan of Kona Grill and it really baffles me as to why this place is always so packed. They do have a lot of items on their menu that sound great but I feel like the quality of the food is very hit or miss. The same with the service from the waitstaff in the dining area. The bartenders can definitely mix up some good cocktails and they have a great patio but the sushi they serve at Happy Hour is awful - not well prepared and tastes like it has been sitting out for a while.   I guess out of the choices available nearby it is not a bad place in comparison. I would definitely rather go here than Cheescake Factory or that new Old Spaghetti Factory (horrible!) but there are a lot better places out there once you escape the confines of the mall."}
{"text":"Sushi for their happy hour is the best thing to do. It's good, reasonably priced, and there are so many hh options. I'm always pleased coming here. Love the ahi tuna appetizer and their sushi rolls are pretty yummy."}
{"text":"I had I'm eating miso-saké marinated sea bass. baked and served with shrimp & pork fried rice and grilled broccolini.. A full sushi /sashimi menu also available. Server (Brandon) was /is very pleasant. The rest of the entrées at the table were delicious.  The place is a bit loud but really worth it. I'm coming back for more sea bass!"}
{"text":"Kona Grill is the Cheesecake Factory of sushi.  Steaks are good.  Staff is very friendly.  Service is fast.   Nice aquarium.  Cool indoor/outdoor bar.  Very conveniently located to the mall.  A solid choice, no surprises."}
{"text":"GREAT MENU / BUT JUST OKAY  What this is great for: sitting for a drink for happy hour on their patio with the mister shooting right atop your head.  What it is not: dining and enjoying your food.  Blah, plain, underseasoned, just not good.  The restaurant decor is very cool, and but just underwhelming on the food.  PS.  Very nice update.  Lloyd, the Manager at the Kona Grill, wrote me an email the next day after I had written this review.  It was both professional and apologetic, and offered a gift card for me to return and try the restaurant again.  Once received, I will visit and hope to have a better dining experience."}
{"text":"Excellent! Went here for lunch with the hubs during the holidays. Service was good and food was excellent we had the calamari and salmon entree and my hubs had two rolls. We would easily be regulars if it wasn't so far away."}
{"text":"Good Asian food with some interesting twists. We had the calamari and the spicy aioli really went well with calamari serves with both legs and rings. Also had the Ahi katsuo which was delicious. Wish they had hot mustard as it is a nice dip. Wasabi was good and added to the ahi.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"This use to be the spot for reverse happy hour. Happy hour menu is a huge disappointment now. Service gets 3 stars."}
{"text":"They have a great happy hour and the prices are awesome. Sometimes the service isn't great though, its a hit or miss to get a good server. Over all a fun place to go with friends. PS Briana was an excellent server last night. Always checked back, kept up on refills, asked how the food was, etc."}
{"text":"The gluten free menu was great!!  Had sushi and it was amazing!  Great apple cider as well!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite happy hour spots!! Great sushi, great pizzas (Hawaiian is my favorite) and the chicken tacos... Where can you get a combo like that?!?   Service has always been prompt and friendly. This place has the best outdoor/patio atmosphere in town! Heaters are on when it's too cold and misters are on when it's too hot!"}
{"text":"If you like great sushi at great prices and a great  happy hour selection of food and great drink prices - you will be lucky to find a happy hour with a better value - and as for people watching - that's 5 star as well - for happy hour - you can't go wrong"}
{"text":"KG is the spot to be seen and heard! The usual Fridays it seems, I would roll up down Camelback Rd from the 51 after work hours, 5PM-ish.  Now, if you are lucky enough, you and your peeps you were suppose to meet up with will find an open spot.  Nine out of ten times, we are not so lucky as it seems, always!   Yes, a temporary glitch to a good time after a long work week! So, the quick solution is to just grab some booze from the bar, the usual Heineken, and wait for the next open table and hope that the party occupying your table-to-be leaves before HH ends!   My cuatro stars is based solely on my HH delights and experience.  The sushi and drinks offered here during HH is nothing stellar, but has an appealing price tag that runs you $3-5 a pop.  The menu indeed is limited to some of your basic sushi rolls such as the California and shrimp tempura.  Another favorite is the calamaris.  The quality is average at best while still satisfying both our wallets and taste bud.  In my typical setting of anywhere from six to a dozen peeps, we typically like to down our apps with Sake and Japanese Beer such Sapporo or Kieren.  Wait, isn't that a recipe for a Sake Bomber? Yes, yes it is!   If you don't mind the noisy chatter from every which direction meaning the table next to you or the traffic coming in and out of Fashion Square,  bumping music in this hostile social environment on an early Friday evening, possibly a slight chance of waiting for an opened seating, and a very attractive on-a-low-budget Happy Hour menu, I highly recommend this I am too cool-for-you Old Town scene."}
{"text":"Awesome chill spot, and super happy hour!  Wish there was one on Eastern closer to me =)"}
{"text":"This is a solid place. Go specifically for sushi. I have a shellfish allergy and the staff is always so attentive to the issue. Only gave 4 stars because I wish there were more kid options. Great place."}
{"text":"So after a LONG AZZ day of sessions at our conference we were all tired and HUNGRY!  So where to eat for din-din?  We threw around a few ideas and this was what ended up sticking.  I think the fact they had some of everything was GREAT and I remember someone mentioning sushi so I was in.  We all piled in one car and drove away.  This place was pretty close to where we were staying so we only needed to be in the car for a hot second before we arrived.  We could have walked but its PHOENIX in the summer so that was NOT going to happen.  We arrive and found parking in the lot.  This is one of those live and play type of places so there were flats or condos above the shops and restaurants.  We walked in and were greeted right away.  As soon as we gave our number of peeps we were seated.  Our server came right over and took our drink orders.  Soda, Arnold palmer, water, etc.    Then it was time to peruse the menu.  What to get.  I already knew this place had sushi so that is what I wanted.  A few people had been here earlier in the week so they wanted something different.  The nice thing about this place is you can mix and match if you're feeling like a pasta and sushi then you can do pasta and sushi.  Our server brought our drinks back and asked if we were all ready to place our orders.  Some people were ready other were not so we had her start with the furthest person(s) that were ready.  Lucky for us they were sitting together so by the time she worked her way around the table the rest were ready as well.  Someone got pasta, another person got a salad, burger, sushi, with veggies and I got sushi as well.  Once our order was taken we all lamented on how exhausting the conference was and having been there the week before for the class and certification exam (which I passed) it was more exhausting.  We felt like we all had been gone for 3 weeks from home.  We loved the hotel but wanted to go home.  Apparently several of the conference goers liked this place and there was a steady flow of them coming and going.  Our food soon arrived and we all dove in teeth first, laughing, and talking and having fun after a long day.  The food was quite good.  My sushi was on point for a place that does more than sushi.  I was pretty surprised.  I ended up ordering more sushi which took quite a while to prepare.  Not sure why but I ended up having to get it to go.  No BUENO!  That meant no eel sauce for me because she forgot to bring it to the table.    She was SUPER KIND and split the check nice because we were all on per diem this makes it super easy to turn in receipts once back home to get reimbursed from the company.    I would go back here if I'm ever back in town!  Very YUMMY and close to the hotel."}
{"text":"Kona is pretty good. It's nice for a chain restaurant. Happy our is good and angry edamame is a must. I've come here at least 5 or 6 times. The best service is at the bar and the drinks are good. Great place!"}
{"text":"Great food and appetizers, good service, and fun atmosphere!!!  My wife attended happy hour here not too long ago and the had the best time!  The cook is fantastic too, hat's off to you!!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour! Cool atmosphere ! Wonderful server. My friend and I decided to come here on a Thursday and it was great !"}
{"text":"Great vibe. Happy hour is my fave but I will definitely go for a dinner date with friends. Perfect for small groups as long as you call ahead. Sushi is the bomb.com Try the ice tea unsweetened green tea and blackberry is my favorite."}
{"text":"Kona seems to be the spot for everyone to hang out. I get that they have good happy hour deals, but every time I've gotten food, it's been underwhelming. I'm all for sushi, but it's not a food I associate with drinking and partying (probably cuz I get super clumsy with my chopsticks, and then I fail to be able to get anything successfully in my mouth). Kona seems to attract the older people in the area too. I think it's kinda odd, but hey, I guess they like to have some fun too!"}
{"text":"Came here to eat after power shopping. I ordered a bloody mary and the top of the tabasco came of the bottle an the waitress replaced my drink free.  Has the fish salad and the other ladies had other salads all good.  our service was impeccable and I liked the sushi offering. it was noisy but we were nosiy so it didn't mater. Wish they would come to Utah."}
{"text":"Changed HH 3/30/18. Prices are .50 off, they have taken off all their $5 plates, they have totally ruined their old HH menu . It now ends at 6!! Never going back!!"}
{"text":"This place has some amazing sushi, and a large fishtank with some pretty cool fish in there! I can only comment on the Sushi because that is all I had, but it was amazing. They service was awesome too. They have happy hour Monday-Friday 3-7. But be warned happy hour is only offered to the outside patio, so you have to question \"Is money or not being on fire more important to me\"."}
{"text":"I had gone the first few days it opened and this is by far one of the most beautiful restaurants on the strip! The food is great and being a mall employee the discount is great. The staff is all friendly and helpful. I recommend this to all friends and coworkers!"}
{"text":"I came to the Kona Grill in Vegas.. the food is the same as it is in Dallas.. so nothing special. We sat at the bar.. ordered.. had food.  When it came time for the bill.. the bill had the tip section highlight with a yellow marker.. I'm like what the freak.  Is it because we were 4 African Americans paying.. if not.. i still take offense to  the fact that i always tip.. over the suggested amount.. which i still did in this case."}
{"text":"It sucks when the moment you walk in starts terribly. First impressions are extremely important to me. I had to go here for a meeting for my organization. My friend and I were waiting at the host stand for a good 15 minutes while a waitress walked around us without even acknowledging us whatsoever. At some point we decided to take a seat because we were standing for quite awhile. The host finally comes and seats us. The waitress was okay at most. Not the best service. The food was okay. I had an Atlantic roll and a yamada roll, and they were good but nothing special. The calamari was cold, and the taro chips were not special either.   The strawberry fizz drink was at least yummy. I don't think that I would being coming back here again."}
{"text":"Thanks for the food poisoning you jerks. I just love being up all night throwing up! Vomiting, sweating, and the chills is exactly what I didn't order off your menu but thank you anyways for making sure that's what left with."}
{"text":"Kona's new re-brand at this location gave it that extra \"umph\" to take it to the next level. I've always been a huge fan of Kona Grill and this location has got it all. Food, Service, and overall experience. The employees here really pride themselves in their work and their interactions with guests. It's great to see the leaders not just walk around and ask how everything is, but roll up their sleeves and serve a plate or clear a table. Great job, @konagrill !"}
{"text":"Happy Hour Alert!  One of my favorite happy hours! These margaritas are the strongest in town. Wasted after three and I can hold my liquor.   Half priced appetizers are a must. Rolls, pizzas, lettuce wraps, spicy shrimp and avocado rolls are some of my favorites. I go as often as I can and even come back for reverse happy hour when I'm in the mood.   Great place to sit, drink, eat and socialize. Get here early though, this place get BUSY!!!"}
{"text":"Kona has a great happy hour & some of the nicest staff!  Amir is the best bartender. He is always personable, knowledgeable and attentive & always great to be around.   The happy hour food specials are great too (love the ahi tuna crisps, wontons & rolls) it's nice to sit outside and enjoy the atmosphere.  I know they have an all day happy hour on Sunday but I haven't had a chance to try it, but I love to grab a drink and appetizers at the bar.  Amir always makes it a great time!   Great spot to go with friends."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and the food is great.  Service was good, not great, but I would come back for the food.  Warm atmosphere and good location.  A good place to take clients to as well."}
{"text":"I've experienced better. The waiter was nice. I started out with a puckery Grape Cosmopolitan. Then ordered a 12 oz NY steak and a nice Merlot to pair. Experience was okay."}
{"text":"They did an excellent job with the remodel. The restaurant is more inviting and open plus adding the 2nd floor gives the restaurant more character. I've been to this place on numerous occasions and have always had a memorable experience. The service is all on their game with customer service and knowledge. When a establishment has team members with personalities it adds to the appeal of the restaurant tenfold.  I've had numerous of their dishes and all the dishes I've had from the sushi to the dessert has been food-gasmic. The dishes are fresh and full of flavor. Their happy hour is fricken amazeballs. On Sundays, it's all day long! Yes, you read me right, ALL DAY LONG! And if the weather is perfect, outside seating and upstairs seating enhances the relaxed vibe. Their drinks are mixed to perfection, not overly poured like they do on the strip. It's a great spot for date nights or family dinners."}
{"text":"Great food, nice atmosphere, excellent presentation, should definitely make a reservation. Everything we had here was super-good, so you could just throw darts at the menu and it would be one of the most tasty and impressive meals of your life! Sure, you might pay a little more...but you're worth it, right? RIGHT?!! Haha. I can't remember what we ate because this meal was in December 2016 and I just found the photos (oh yeah, I remember that place). I only remember that it was delicious and I was impressed. You not belief!"}
{"text":"So this is the second and last time I'll be having dinner at Kona Grill. First time I had a pulled pork sandwich which was decent but not very exciting.  I enjoyed the chicken satay appetizer and the nice drink/wine list,  along with the modern,  relaxed atmosphere.  Really like sitting on the patio or in the bar area.  However,  the main dishes are mediocre at best. I always give places a second shot but our second visit was even more underwhelming.  I had the sea bass and my husband had the pork tenderloin.  Both were prepared well but pretty much tasteless and boring.  And expensive.  I love good food and I'll pay for anything worth it,  however this sea bass was not a $26 dish.  Not on any planet.  I'd recommend this as a nice place to meet for drinks and maybe apps and desserts but do not bother with an entree. I can name at least 10 other places in the valley with better food for those prices."}
{"text":"One of the more bizarre phenomenons I have seen... why is the place to be after work in Scottsdale a restaurant in a mall \"basement\"?  Is it the choice view of the parking garage entrance?  The gentle breeze laden with the scent of car exhaust ?  I swear, it's true.  Flocks of shiny happy people packed like sardines onto the postage stamp sized patio.  Maybe it's the proximity to the valet station, patio viewers can quickly size up the, errrr, \"qualifications\" of would be suitors?  I just don't know.  On a more serious note, the food is pretty good.  The drinks are pretty good.  The restaurant itself is modern and stylish.  I would definitely (and have) popped into the restaurant after a day of shopping for a bite to eat."}
{"text":"I came here for Happy Hour on a week day. Last time I was here it was good but this time not so much. I was with three black ladies (I'm a white guy), and they were treated terribly by our white female server. She wouldn't take orders, walked away when people were ordering and all together being very rude. When I'm there with my white friends, our service rocks. There's this cool dude who serves there and he helped us out, but this was terrible. The sushi came old and oddly colored and the food was just so so. The calamari tasted way too fishy and we talked to the manager who apologized over and over. I will give them another try but I hope that waitress isn't there."}
{"text":"Bad experience first time and it's the last one!!  The food is ok , but they are thieves !!  When the check come I ask clear the server (Manuel) to charge my card $83.74  I left tip everything was ok and if I could I would take the tip back!!!  I found out the day after when I was checking my account something weird , and see that kona grill charge me $257.48  When I call them they check it and say it was a mistake !!  How come a mistake of $170 more?  If someone go there make sure to check your account after because no one will let you know that it was a \"mistake\" in your amount ,and they will keep the money ."}
{"text":"Location: it has lots of seatings with booths tables and patio areas.   Service: Hostess makes you feel welcome and our waiter was attentive. However, he did interrupt us every single time we were in the middle of the conversation. I thought that was pretty rude. He didn't say excuse me and just stopped us while we were talking. After the 5th time, it became very irritating.   Food: I ordered the Ahi tuna appetizer and it was absolutely delicious. Their spicy tuna was a bit tasteless. Caterpillar rolls was delicious. As for drinks, I ordered the ice green tea and loves it!   Rating: I am hesitant to come back here again due to the constant interruptions. Overall I think this place is decent."}
{"text":"Location: it is located inside the Scottsdale mall. It is spacious, clean, and very welcoming. Decoration is amazing. I think they definitely did a good job on it.   Service: hmm....I think this is the area where it loses 2 stars on rating. Although our waiter was nice, I didn't feel that he was as attentive as he should be. When we first sat down, he showed up to take our order for drinks and appetizer. While we were waiting for it, he didn't give us glasses of water until we asked for them. When we finally got our food, he didn't stop by to give us refill on drinks until we asked him to get it. Overall, I think the service could have been better.   Food: we ordered the jalapeno tuna for appetizer and it was delicious. We also ordered Caterpillar roll. The avacado was soooo fresh it literally melts in my mouth. The last roll was the checkers roll. It was well decorated and delicious.   Rating: overall I think this place is decent. I'll come back here again for sushi. Hopefully the service will be better next time."}
{"text":"My friends and I came here to watch the ASU game on a Sat. Happy hour ends at 2 pm and unfortunately we miss it. I order a spicy tuna roll and caterpillar roll. It was very delicious. The restaurant is very well decorated. However, the service isn't that great. Have you been to a restaurant where the server acts like they are too good to serve you? And when you ask them for anything they look irritated? Or when they see empty plates on your table they don't even bother to pick it up? We got one of those last night. I still want to give it 3 star because I've had better service at the same restaurant depending on which server you get. I always love their sushi and hopefully I will get better service next time"}
{"text":"Stopped into Kona Grill today while shopping at Fashion Show Mall. It wasn't very busy at all. The food however was really great! I ordered a Kahuna Burger and it was huge , I couldn't even finish it. Our server , Nicky, was very kind and always on top of things! I'll definitely be back ."}
{"text":"We usually go to the Summerlin location, but we were at mall and gave new location a shot. The restaurant is beautiful. We sat on the patio, which is great for people watching.  Our server was very attentive and friendly.  We started with the Vegal roll, which was tasty. I had the shrimp lime salad. It was large, full of nice greens and veges. There was a lot of shrimp, which, unfortunately,  was overcooked. Other than that, it was a nice dining experience."}
{"text":"We went in on a Saturday evening and they weren't very busy, there were a lot of empty tables.  It took quite a while for our server to greet us.  We ordered the Angry Edamame and it was way to spicy to eat so we ordered the plain edamame, it was good.  We ordered 3 rolls and two pieces of salmon sushi.  The rolls were completely tasteless and the seaweed wrap was so tough I couldn't even chew it.  The salmon in the sushi was tasteless as well, my husband said the rice had more flavor than the fish.  Again it took quite a while for our server to bring us our check.  It was a disappointing experience for sure, we won't return."}
{"text":"Tough review to write. Sometimes outstanding sometimes the service is awful. It is a good thing I had a lunch companion that made me want to sit there all afternoon.  Have also gone at night for happy hour. Decent sushi and bar service directly st the bar is decent. Just take your chances on lunch Service... or bring someone where the service doesn't matter."}
{"text":"Came on a Saturday at around 11am for the happy hour and it was excellent.  We were able to get some sushi and a good drink.  The staff was excellent as we brought our 4 month old and although he didn't make a sound, no one seemed concerned and they looked happy to see him and say hi.  Definitely coming back to this place because it is a nice atmosphere and right off the 202"}
{"text":"The rolls suck, but the drinks are great!  A tad pricey though.  Chicken stick appetizer things are good.  I only go here to meet up with friends for a beverage.  I no longer order a real meal at this place."}
{"text":"come here for two things: fish tacos and sake bombers. and then, only during happy hour."}
{"text":"First of all, this should really be marked as $$$ - it was a little pricier than expected. Service was decent, food looked okay. Sushi was reasonably priced as far as sushi goes, but you had better love cream cheese and hot peppers, because nearly every roll had those in it. That was annoying.  We ordered chicken & shrimp lettuce wraps, and while tasty, you have to be careful - you'll hurt your eyes looking for the shrimp. We ordered a coconut shrimp roll and a softshell crab roll. Both were okay. The waitress, and nearly three other servers had to double check that yes, we really did want the softshell crab - apparently, most people don't know what that is and freak out when the whole crab, shell and all, comes out. I figure if it is that bad, take it off the menu...? But whatever, it was tasty. Ultimately, I was dissapointed that a place with a name like \"Kona Grill\" didn't have more Hawaiian style food or even decor. Other than that, it was OK - wasn't too impressed."}
