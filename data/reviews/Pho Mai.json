{"text":"As I've mentioned in other reviews, I lived in Kensington for 3 years.  A family friend let me stay at his apartment that he rarely used for a few months when I first moved to Calgary.  Unfortunately, the kitchen was being renovated, so I dined out, a lot.

Pho MAI was the closest restaurant to the apartment.  My first few visits there were limited to Vietnamese Subs, which were awesome.  I've had the subs at a few places, but always preferred the ones here.  Always fresh, always delicious, and always fast.  For a bachelor like me, it was perfect.

As time progressed, and I moved out of that apartment into another one very close, I sampled other items on the menu.  The food was always fantastic and never late.  My favourite is the 32, and no I can't remember what it was called.  It had chicken, beef, and shrimp in it though.  Helpful right?

A couple of years ago, the ownership changed.  The quality of the food didn't change and neither did the service.  It went from one Asian couple to another Asian couple.  The new couple is a little less friendly, but I quickly discovered that it stems from their comprehension of the english language.  The first couple had a great grasp, but the new couple, a little less so.  Still very friendly, but not as chatty (understandably).

If you're in the area, and want to skip Chicken on the Way, check it out!"}
{"text":"Kat, Kyla and I were looking for lunch following Kat's haircut at Chinook. We were in the parking lot of Bagolac when Kat impulsively decided that we need ramen, let's drive across the city! We were shut out of Shikiji and Muku, which both closed at 2:30. Slowly facing defeat, but not content to return to square one, we attempted to turn around on 14th St to head to Market Mall, and the dead end we turned into was this place. We figured, hey, Vietnamese was the first option anyway, let's just try this place. It is small, a little ramshackle, and there was nobody else in sight. I got the standard charbroiled pork and spring roll bun (as did Kyla), while Kat got the beef soup. It was flavorful (the meat had an interesting longenesa taste), and the service was quick. Halfway through, a guy came in and started listing his allergies, saying that if they can make food that won't kill him, he will eat there quite often. I sure hope the guy is still alive!

It's tucked away, and it is not easily accessed from southbound 14th, but its worthwhile if you're in the area and need a quick Vietnamese fix!"}
