{"text":"I visited this lovely little place when a friend of mine was performing some live music there a couple months back. From what I remember, it was a great experience. The person serving drinks was very friendly, and because of how small the store was, it was a very intimate experience. We managed to fit A LOT of people that night into that small space! They serve beers as well as the usual coffee, espressos, hot chocolates &small treats.

The only reason why it's a 4-star instead of a 5 is because of the seating - and it isn't exactly their fault that the space is kind-of small and the event my friend had was huge, but I hate having that \"no-seats left\" feeling (anyone know what I mean?)

I also remembered that I loved the art on the walls!"}
{"text":"Great little place- not busy at all today which was kind of odd ! about 8 tables on the patio (they could get some comfier chairs - might have stayed for a another but my ass hurt from sitting on a tiny little wood chair. 
Inside they had a bit of a stage so I would guess at night they have music. 
Great espresso ! 
Friendly nice staff! 
I will return."}
{"text":"so this really will require a follow up review at some  point in time, but for now, i can say that i have been into aspetta for a cappucino.

immediately you get the feeling like its a family establishment, as in owned by a family, which i dont think it is, but if the feeling is not family then its just simply warm.  because at its best family is warm. right?

it was the first place other than tim hortons that asked me how many sugars i wanted.  i dont really know how i feel about someone putting sugars in my coffee for me.  not needed, per se, but not harmful either.

i didnt stick around but it looked like a decent place to lounge being spacious and white.  (i dont know why being white should make a difference.  am i racist and i dont even know it?)."}
{"text":"Cozy little cafe in Kensington Market w/ live music and wifi."}
{"text":"I've been to this place twice this month. The cheese, meats, and pickles here are fantastic. I implore you to try their Market Plate, it costs $9 and has amazing Havarti and Brie cheese. The Portuguese chorizo, smoked prosciutto and spicy Genoa salami is excellent. 
They have live music sometimes from Fri-Sun which sets the ambience - it's very Kensington. 
Oh, and free lollipops are available for customers-the multicolored one is the best."}
{"text":"After getting boozed up at Amsterdam Beer, we struggled our way onto the Spadina streetcar and got off in Chinatown to pick up some munchies at the Vietnamese shop. Then we zombied over into Kensington Market and sat down to a guy playing solo with his guitar and a loop machine. We downed espressos to sharpen our wits after the barrage of 8 different kinds of beer (see my next review for details of that.) It was very pleasant, we were able to use the bathroom, and just around that corner on just that day there was a shootout on the street! Crazy.

It's a good place trying to make it in the hustle and bustle of touristy Kensington Market. Give it a try."}
