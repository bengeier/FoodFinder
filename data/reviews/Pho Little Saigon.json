{"text":"+ open 24 hours!!
+ real close to the strip...less than 5 min drive
+ large restaurant which means lots of tables

food wise -as most have said- isn't anything too impressive..but considering this is VEGAS....i guess its good enough for vegas =)

I really liked my eggroll dish i ordered (the fried eggrolls you wrap w/ lettece).
pho itself did lack a bit of flavor...

all in all...if you get tired of american/fusion food...and you're craving some MSG...this would be a decent place to go =)"}
{"text":"Mediocre pho and bad service. Had to ask for water, straws, and even napkins multiple times and this is after they brought out the pho. Service with an attitude."}
{"text":"Pho noodles here are soggy.  I'm guessing that the cook isn't washing the noodles with cold water after they are boiled.  Also the spring rolls were not so great either."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE HORRIBLE FOOD & SERVICE! .  a patron in my party expressed not being pleased with her meal, they of course offered if she would like to try anything different. And of course she opted yes, as she was still hungry. (her first dish was was the pho , & it was so horrible she could not even complete one bite). When our check came they still charged her for both meals!! Even meal that she NEVER even ate!!! They said it could not be deleted& they would call the police. Even Taco Bell refund your money when you are not pleased ... Really? I guess our first sign should had been when we noticed we were the only customers at prime lunch hour.... The food lacks taste and so do the workers"}
{"text":"The best pho restaurant in Vegas, by far! My husband and I come here and they know our order, remember our names and our favorite table. I love love love this restaurant!"}
{"text":"This was a great little place to grab dinner in a hurry. Service was prompt and polite. The food was good, but you cant go too wrong with pho. It was a good portion for the price ($8 for a regular bowl).  I'd love to go back try the other menu items."}
{"text":"my wife and i went on a saturday afternoon . the place was busy,( always a good sign). The pho I got was good and flavorful But i think that the sandwitches are are the best! yum! Im there for the sandwitches"}
{"text":"I went in with no expectations and was extremely pleased with the phood. I did take the food to go, so I did not experience their uncourteous-ness. Those that attended to me were quite helpful. I will gladly eat there again next time I am in Vegas."}
{"text":"I did not like this place.   Not service oriented place at all.   For the food quality/ taste, their prices are rather high.
Almost tipped again on top of their automatically added 15% gratuity.     Not coming back to this place."}
{"text":"Horrible food, awful pain in my stomach the next day. Did not like the freshness of the food or how it was prepared. Service is not bad and they have cheap drinks compared to other places but the food is kinda fail. The pho isn't horrible but there are so many better places in the area"}
{"text":"The Pho is excellent as are many of the other items on the menu.  Great weekday lunch special choices and very generous portions with nice soup for just five dollars!  Clean, convenient, and a nice atmosphere. Reasonable prices and great quality.  Fast friendly service with a smile!  I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Had the #72 because it was displayed in their menu w/ a tasty-looking picture, but it was FUNKY.  The soup reeked of old fish and liver.  I took a bite into the squid and it was clearly old.  Would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Worst Service Ever! The bathrooms weren't clean AND there was trash under the tables! They were slow to bring out the food and didn't give us water or napkins! Worst customer service I have ever experienced!"}
{"text":"Very terrible. The staffs are very impolite, look like they dont need customer. They are  ignorant. They should learn how to do business and customer service skill. The food is very bad. If you looking for dirty and bad food, just come here. If you looking for inpolite staff, just come here."}
{"text":"I'd give it a 0 star if that's possible.  The worst restaurant I've eaten in my life.  Came in when the place was practically deserted yet never got the water I asked for, the eggroll from my bun thit nuong was spoiled..it tasted sour.  I understand people with no cooking talents but to knowing serve paying customers food that should've thrown away is inexcusible.  Don't walk away...RUN!!!"}
{"text":"BARFFFF!!! I had to update this review and bump it down to 1 star! If I could give 0 I would! 

This is in regards to the Henderson location: BF and I decided to give this place another try since Lemongrass had been screwing up our orders the last couple times... boy did I regret giving this place another chance!

First off, the waitress couldn't speak an ounce of english nor understand it. I think it took about 5 mins going back and forth when I just wanted to order a rare steak and tendon (they didn't have it on the menu). My boyfriend finally says she wants a #whatever without the tripe... I wish he didn't even say that because.. there was tripe in my soup.  I didn't want to bother telling the waitress so I just grinned and beared it.

The summer rolls came out fast but they were so loosley rolled everything was falling out. They brought out the plate of bean sprouts and basil.. there was only one sprig of basil! HOW CHEAP!! No spinach like leaf that I liked the last time I came here. 

The pho came out and the noodles were soooo chewy and stuck together that I was getting frustrated when eating it! Worse pho noodles ever. The broth wasn't bad but nothing special about it either.

Service is awful. I was surprised they came around to fill my water. The workers talk so loud in the same area without any regard to the customers. 

Worse pho experience ever. Will not come back ever again."}
{"text":"I tried to understand the people who gave this place a good rate but nawww.... The service is horrible. I ordered water and never got any. I ordered lemons and never got any. I changed my order and made sure that they understand but they still gave it to me as extra and charged me extra. HORRIBLE. Really dirty and smells."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: Very empty. I guess I know why now.

Service: Service is okay. The waiters don't understand English very well, so you have to explain how you want the food done many times, and then they still mess up.

Food: Pho is decent. Spring rolls are okay. The fried chicken is gross. They didn't have any stirfriend because \"the stirfry is broken.\" whatever that means.  Oh yah, for an extra plate of beef steak slices, (6 small pieces), it's $4.50!!!

Drink: No comment since only got water. 

Bottom Line: 
Food is okay.  Not bad if you take the food however they make it.  But difficult if you want them to do something different, like take out the onion, or put in more meat. Extremely expensive extra meat for pho."}
{"text":"My first one star review ever.  This place is nastiness.  I've been to this pho restaurant several years ago and didn't remember it being so bad.  We walked in to a bunch of empty tables still with dirty dishes on them, we'll let that go.  Then, we get seated at a table and the waiter sloppily wiped the table, there was still grease all over it.  Now I start feeling dirty.  My husband and I both order pho and just one drink.  His pho came out first...and that was the only thing that ever came out.  I sat there and watched him eat.  I never got my pho or the drink we ordered.  I got out of there as quickly as I could and was actually glad that I never had to eat after reading the yelp reviews about roaches inside the pho!!  Gross!!  This place made me feel dirty!!  There are too many pho selections in LV that no one needs to tolerate this in order to get a good pho fixing.  Pass this place by and keep rolling down spring mountain!!"}
{"text":"By far the best Pho Tai I've had in Vegas.  I travel all over the states and this is my go to Vietnamese when I'm in Vegas.  I'm all about a great broth and they have a balanced aromatic broth with fresh veggies and tender thin beef."}
{"text":"I come here to satisfy my pho cravings since it's convenient.  The broth is sometimes rich and sometimes dull.  Service is alright (depending on who's working).  It's pretty pricey and the soup bowl is kind of small compared to other places.  One thing I really love from here are their vietnamese sandwiches.  I prefer the pork because it is more tasty than the beef and it is very affordable around $3.50 a sandwich.  


Oh and they won't accept your card if you don't meet the minimum requirement which may be around 10 or 15 dollars so bring cash if you don't plan on spending that much."}
{"text":"Service was still good. But I'm not sure if they had a change of chef, the taste of PLS is quite different from the first few times I've been there.
I could recall every taste on every restaurants I've been too! How you say??
Because I always ordered the same food!!!
For every pho, hole in the wall restaurants, I've made it to the point to order just one kind of soup...and that's their number one soup on their lists of what made them famous and known for...tasting their trademark soups!
This time, PLS, really is not up to 5 star, why?? Maybe they've change their people at the back, looking for cheaper affordable chefs...can they cook?? Sure they can!
But NEVER the same quality as those that originally made the soup that made them known their trademarks!!

What??? No free internet?? The owner never shared this info to their employees for the needs of the customers??
It was given to me every time I asked for it before.
...are they downgrading?? I don't know.
The soup spoon was rough. Like calcium rough on a swimming pool stain.
So I just gulp down the soup without the soup-spoon.

Not complaining, just disappointed with the quality difference over as little as 2 months."}
{"text":"I dont understand why this place has so many bad reviews. Foods are so good, best pho in town, and it was served really fast as mcdonalds. Me and my husband love this place we come here all the time."}
{"text":"Worst service ever.  Our food came, but, our drinks did not.  When we asked for our drinks while the server walked by, he ignored us, walked down the isle, and then turn around and said \"Yeah, yeah, it's coming\".  Finally, when we were already done eating,  and ready to go,  here comes our drinks.   Last time I checked,  drinks came before food.....but what do I know about customer service?  I hope the server went out and bought himself something nice with the 0.7 cents tip I gave him."}
{"text":"Let me get this straight. After a road trip to the Grand Canyon and eating the most horrible bowl of ph, I could live with and consider any other version of it delicious. In my opinion, the soup was a bit too salty. Something you would find in most Vietnamese restaurants around anyways, which didn't seem to bother me. The bún bò hu in the other hand was completely off. Not spicy enough and plain. Thai Tea was ok and I sort of enjoyed it. In conclusion, this is a alright place to go if you don't have really high Standards. It's not really expensive and it's open 24/7."}
{"text":"The service was terrible! We have to keep on asking for our iced coffees and when it came, they gave us too many. The noodle was okay but it was disturbing to see extreme food shows on tv when we were eating. They were showing slaughtering rats and insects!!! Disgusting!"}
{"text":"It wasn't the best but it wasn't the worst. The soup is pretty good & the viet sandwiches are okay, I think I've had better though. It's a half service restaurant too, so don't expect a lot from customer service. Very spacious but everytime I go here there's not that much people even though their food isn't that bad. I think I'd come back only if I was really craving phò and it was the closest one around."}
{"text":"This place is infested with roaches !!!! I had made the mistake of going in this place one evening . When I had sat down to order my meal I had seen something out the corner of my eyes scurrying across the floor.  So I got up and went to the chair it was hiding behind and it was a gotdamn roach !!!!  If you have roaches crawling around in the daytime I can assure you their's hundreds crawling around at night on the dishes , spoons , glasses , plates and tables.  So I wouldn't take a chance of eating at this place,  if you do you are going to get a belly full of roaches in some shape fashion or form"}
{"text":"WATCH OUT Your receipt!

They charge 15% tips automatically from your paying total amount, ask for the print out receipt, is this some kind of a scam?

if you didn't find out, then you pay another extra tips."}
{"text":"Cost: I was in a party of eleven and we weren't allowed to split the check and I'm not sure if it was because we were a large group or if they charge a 15% gratuity on everyone, so check the prices carefully when you're paying! 

Customer Service: Our waiter was really rude; he ignored my cousin's request for onions on the side and said to him, \"No onions for you!\" We were really shocked at how he said it to him. Then, I proceeded to try and order and he told me to \"shh\" and \"hold on.\" I was so annoyed by that, I almost didn't order anything. But I had to cave in because I was hungry. 

The food: It was okay. I had rice, pork, and egg rolls. It was pretty oily though, that's my only complaint. But then again, food is always good when you're super hungry."}
{"text":"FOOD POISONING ALERT!

We were in Vegas for my husband's conference and some vacation as well. We were there for a week (Monday-Monday). On Friday, we were so tired of the buffets here and there in different hotels so we opted for a Vietnamese food.

Our GPS brought us to this place and since we were all starving we just went in and ordered.

The whole dinner was ok. Food ok. Service ok. We ordered Pho for me,  husband and a friend and fried rice for our 2 kids. My son ate a lot of the fried rice and my hisband ate some. My daughter had about 2 teaspoonfuls.

But lo and behold, when we were driving back to our hotel (after about 3hrs of exploring the strip after dinner) our son started throwing up. He would alternate vomiting and loose bowel movement the whole weekend. he wouldn't take any food or liquids for that matter thus he started becoming dehydrated. My husband started having diarrhea very early saturday. He wasn't able to attend his conference that weekend. My daughter also started having diarrhea saturday morning. 

I was worried of my son because he was the most affected of all. I was so close to bringing him to the ER. But husband and our friend are both doctors so we managed their illness. 

We immediately concluded that it was the fried rice that caused all these. So sunday afternoon, I called the restaurant to let them know what happened and how they spoil our vacation (our weekend on our trip). I was waiting for the one I spoke with (she said she was the manager) to apologize and sympathize with what we went through the whole weekend. But instead she was so defensive and told me that no one ever complains (indirectly saying that Im making up stories?!). I told her that I jsut dont want it to happen to someone else's family and that they should stop re-heating fried rice (most probably that's what happened) but the lady who can't even speak straight english hung up on me.
That got me irrated so I reported them to BBB.

I feel so mad whenever i would think about that weekend! The worst ever plus the fact that I was so scared of my poor little boy. And they don't even care...

Wish I can put a negative rating."}
{"text":"Terrible, terrible Pho.   We also ordered shrimp paste and beef stew, and they tasted just as bad.  The beef was so chewy we left them untouched.   Whoever gave a high praise for this kind of food must not have tasted a good one before. To give a good review for this restaurant is an insult to all the Vietnamese food lovers.  Don't take your chance and go somewhere else instead. It couldn't have been worse."}
{"text":"The foods were so bad, and the service was sooooooo much worse. Tried 10 years ago, it was bad then. Just tried again last month, and it was much worse. Save your money. Go anywhere else but this one."}
{"text":"I wasn't too hungry so I ordered egg rolls. It had a weird taste to it. I had a taste of my friend's pho. It was nothing special. 

There was a total lack of service. There were only a couple other tables at the time. Nobody ever really checked on our table after we got our food. And it was hard to anyone's attention when we needed something.

I've been to pho restaurants with not the best service, but not as bad as here. And at least the food was good.

I will never eat here again."}
{"text":"One of the Vegas spots to hit up after a night of heavy drinking. I ordered the pho combo and a sandwich. Everything was good."}
{"text":"Come here quite often, never disappoints. service is much to be desired but the food makes up for it."}
{"text":"I usually go to Pho Saigon 8 down the road but I don't know what prompted me to come here but I ordered the usual spring roll, summer rolls and a small pho. When the spring rolls came out within 5 minutes I knew something was wrong with it. I went to grab one and it was drenched in oil as if it was if it refried. Then the summer rolls came out and it was nearly frozen. At that point I didn't even feel like eating the Pho that I ordered. As the saying says... \"if it ain't broke don't fix it!\" I'll pass on this restaurant."}
{"text":"Visited several times and the staff are very unwilling to serve and monitor tables. Very rude and ignore customers.  Food is good if you can get the wait staff to understand ordering in English."}
{"text":"I didn't want to eat American fast food while I was in Vegas because I was getting sick of it.  I just felt like eating something else so I came across this place by accident and it sounded good to me.  It was crowded on a Saturday night, maybe 6 tables full when the capacity is for 40 tables.

So I ordered the pho, spring rolls and a dessert.  Spring rolls were decent, nothing spectacular, just standard.  It wasn't horrible, just OK.  Pho came next, appeared to be steaming and yummy.  I added the lime juice, bean sprouts and went at it.  Well, it didn't taste like much, the broth was bland and lacked punch that a good bowl of pho should be.  I was unimpressed with it.  And last was the cut jelly dessert which was probably the best of the three.

Service was decent, they were quick with everything, but then again it wasn't busy so what can you say? They are open 24 hours so that works in their favor, but I wouldn't really rush over here after a night of gambling or hanging out on the strip.  I saw two Caucasian guys come in and check out the menu, I was about to warn them that the food isn't worth it.  Luckily for them, they left before I had to say anything.  

I wouldn't return.  Disappointed.  I wish Vietnamese food were better here, but it's not and that's a shame because I think it could thrive here in Vegas in the right hands."}
{"text":"Pho here isn't that great. They give you lots of noodles but the broth really lacks flavor. It isn't bad but it's very mediocre. I hardly ever complain about pho broth too.  

The lunch menu is good. You can get soup with a dish for about $5 so it definitely is worth coming here for that. Quality and portions are decent. 

Service is a bit below most pho restaurants. They don't really check up on you at all. I think this is part of the reason why this place is not that popular. I have been here 5-6 times and it is always dead."}
{"text":"Not much to say especially when the health department closes you down for doing business."}
{"text":"Good: Open 24hrs, Pho bowl size was huge & soup broth was great. 
Vermicelli with spring roll and pork was good as well. 

Eat there 3 times in two days. 

Bad: Customer services was bad. Lot of tension between boss & waiter in regard to tips. 

Definitely go back for Pho when i go to Vegas"}
{"text":"Bad service.  Rude wait staff.  Took wrong order and didn't even refill water or follow up and 15% gratuity is automatically added to the bill.   Definitely wont come back.  

Food was average at best.  But asian food in Vegas so we didn't expect much"}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant at almost midnight and glad that they were open. Extensive menu, but forced us to order only large portions although menu showed 2 sizes. Food was just okay and so would have given this restaurant a 2 star. But billing methods are not honest. Automatically charged us service fee and tip but charge slip says \"pre-tip amount\". If we didn't look carefully would have been charged service fee and tip twice! Also refused to give us detailed charges. Be careful of charges when eating in this place!"}
{"text":"We got Bun # 53, #9 rare steak Pho noodle soup, and the Banh mi # 99.  All were excellent!  We've been here before and it was just as good. Great service, great food!"}
{"text":"Wish I could give this place ZERO stars. Horrible customer service. How is it that they're 24 hours but by 12 o'clock they only serve 19 ITEMS from their menu of over 100? The servers excuse was \"there's a party of 20 their order is too big the kitchen cannot\". What in the world? ONE party of 20 while the rest of the restaurant is empty but the kitchen loses their minds? Lazy. Not worth it. Don't waste your time here"}
{"text":"This review is not based on the food, but based on why I choose not to go here anymore. 

Came here after work to meet my friend for some pho.  While sitting in my car waiting for her, one of the cooks came out, looking drunk and not so good hygiene.  I'm sorry, but if someone who looked like they haven't showered or changed clothes in a few weeks and just downed a keg of beer for lunch was cooking your food, you'd feel the same way!

So, restaurant owners.... PLEASE enforce proper hygiene for your staff.  And PLEASE, only allow your workers to take their smoking breaks in the back area outside, not the front!

So there's my rating... 1-star for \"Eek! Methinks not.\""}
{"text":"Horrible customer service, delays taking orders since the kitchen is apparently \"stuck\" and busy. Worse of all, when we got our food our fish was raw! Please avoid this place if you care about your health."}
{"text":"Having eaten here a few times now, i'm more impressed each time by the friendly service and excellent good."}
{"text":"Ok I've been here 7 times but as usual forget to review until today:
Had seafood pho, beef flank pho, chicken noodle, spring rolls, all fresh and tasty!
Coulda used more beef in the beef flank.
TV plays Vietnamese special programs and news and gives a very authentic feel as does the very friendly staff.
Note: cash only and sometimes they keep the change as the tip without asking. I gave a $20 bill for a $14 check and he brought the change but a few minutes later as I was texting he came whizzing by, grabbed the money and said thank you! lol that's what I get for texting ;)"}
{"text":"PLEASE STAY AWAY! Went in after Pho Kim Long was too long of a wait. I should have known not to go as the place was empty on a Friday night. Went in and didn't even get greeted. We got sat by a waiter with an attitude. They don't do add ons to a dish or modifications. Got my order wrong. Vegetables were raw and sea food was so disgusting I lost my appetite. We left without eating our food."}
{"text":"Beware they surprise you with a 15% gratuity without letting you know.

I should have read yelp reviews before I came here.. 

Service: The service we received was NOT good. Our waiters were rushy and rude. My sister ordered a soda and those Chinese donuts (cold) for her soup but it didn't come until halfway through our meal. 

Food: Yes they have a large selection to pick from but majority of what we ordered wasn't even good. 

I would never ever come here again."}
{"text":"I have never had a bad meal here.  The pho is good and always hot - even to go.  The sandwiches are fantastic and the employees pleasant."}
{"text":"This place is horrible. The pho had a really strong fish smell, I couldn't eat it. The reused their vegetables from previous guests. They were cleaning their kitchen floor mats outside the restaurant in the parking lot and they were slippery from all the oil and fats. My grandma and I almost slipped on them. 

This is NOT a good place to eat at."}
{"text":"great banh mi, i honestly have a hard time trying to find legit tasty banh mi. Its not fancy but why should it be? i love the environment and the whole aesthetic of the place. i dont understand if you want people to cater to your demands go to the strip, this is a local joint people will not kiss your feet. prices are outstanding,very friendly, its your typical vietnamese restaurant and its my favorite one in las vegas."}
{"text":"My food was amazing. I had deep fried fish, congee and boba tea and shrimp fried rice. Great service!"}
{"text":"we were here last month, trying to get our fix for pho; but was left disappointed.  First off, the place was pretty empty so the workers seemed to be relaxed, they were yapping away loudly...an employee turned on some kid's program in an effort to entertain his young niece (tv is mounted high atop a wall which was visible to customers).   No music or any other noise except the continuing of the workers (possibly owners)  conversations.  it just seemed to be more of a converted eating place than a restaurant...setup the tv elsewhere if you want to babysit your kids, have your private conversations quietly behind the counter...just a thought...
we would skip this pho place!"}
{"text":"I really like this place because my pho always has alot of meat! I don't have to add anything to the broth and its always really fast! The service isn't too bad, but not good.But the pho makes up for it because it comes piping hot. Get what u pay for here."}
{"text":"This has to be the worst Vietnamese food I've every had.  The shrimps in the spring rolls were spoiled.  The Pho was awful and the mint leaves, basil, bean sprouts, etc. were old and wilted.  The service was not all that great but it's expected.  I guess you can't have Pho in Vegas.  Don't even bother!"}
{"text":"Well, I'm a relative noob to the whole Vietnamese culinary experience, but it has slowly been growing on me.  I have had the opportunity to eat at Pho Little Saigon several times and it has been consistently good.  I have limited myself to the Charbroiled Pork Bun and the Banh Mis...both of them hit the spot and I feel like a good portion of food is served for the price.  I also enjoy this place because they serve a limited Chinese menu and I can hook the kids up with some orange chicken and steamed rice since they haven't developed the taste buds for Viet-goodness quite yet...everybody's happy!"}
{"text":"First of all, what was the cute little dog doing running around the restaurant with no collar?  We were not sure if this dog ran out of the kitchen.   One of the owners ran after the dog and tossed the dog outside into the 100+ degree heat.

 I was dragged into this place reluctantly by my family, as they craved Pho.

I first noticed that the place was dark, and the energy was very negative. The people who work here seem miserable.   I ordered a noodle dish with vegetables, and my meal came a good 10 minutes after everyone elses. I guess it takes that long to put extra meat in my dish. It came out with Pork and Chicken.  I immediately sent it back, as I do not meat.  10 minutes after that, the waiter brought out a greasy,  intensely sweet noodle dish. It was the worst noodle dish I have ever had.  The predominate flavor was corn syrup.

When I mentioned that my noodle dish was the worst I had ever had, not only did the waiter not apologize, but he took my dish, tossed it into the garbage can with a look of disgust.  

When I walked out of the restaurant, I saw leftover food which had been tossed right next to the entrance all over the sidewalk. I could not believe what I was seeing. 

When we got home, I realized that waiter who did not provide a sales receipt over charged us 5 by dollars."}
{"text":"I dont recommend you to come here .. bad service food suck go to another place if you have a change"}
{"text":"We're from out of town, venturing out from the strip after a few days of eating America cuisine and we're craving for some Vietnamese food. As we walked in, the place seemed very chaotic. Some customers were upset and left the restaurant before their food came out. That should have been a sign. We looked at each other and wonder if we should continue on or not. However, we were lazy and hungry so decided to give it a try any way.  It was a big mistake. I ordered bun bo Hue, the broth was very bland, not having the aroma of Bun Bo Hue at all.  So I asked for some shrimp paste in hope to make it tasted a little better. Our server heard me asking him but never replied and walked away. My friend reminded the waiter for the sauce supposedly to go with her food so I asked him about mine. He replied he heard me. How come he didn't utter any word if that's the case??? My two friends had pho and it was nothing extraordinary. The bathroom was very filthy too. During our dining experience, the whole crew were arguing about why did the upset customers left earlier right in the middle of the restaurant. As we were leaving the restaurant, I noticed the sign said \"family dining\", where you can order dishes and share among each other. Well, they didn't have that option that they advertised. Overall, I suggest you go to a different restaurant in the area."}
{"text":"Do not eat here !!!! The food is so horrible . Go to pho kim long instead . I took one bite of my food ( ordered chicken pho) and the meat was slimy and void of taste . I told the waiter j did not like it and he made me pay or he would call the cops ?!! What?!so rude. I've never experienced anything like that in my life ! I told him I did not eat the food but he made me pay .please choose somewhere else to go for a late night dining."}
{"text":"Very little wait, and huge portions. I have tried their pho, fried rice and vermicelli, all excellent. Shrimp fried rice is so far my favorite. FYI if you order a plate of fried shrimp it comes with the shell and everything, my buddy ordered it and was disappointed at how much work he had to do for the meat. Other than that one of the best pho places in town."}
{"text":"If you given this place more than 3 stars. You must be related to this place. Wasted my time n money. I'm not even gonna wast my time describing the food. Just one word. \"Nasty\""}
{"text":"just ate there last night with family on (July 3 2016), worse service,quality of food. The order takers were rude and pictures on the wall was all bogus per say, orders were all jacked up,literally placing orders at the wrong guest. beverage were served late ,could go on and on. I hope this is enough warning. Pho Kim long  is bad, but these guys are way out of line at this restaurant. I had to go get myself hypnotized to forget everything really happened!!!lol"}
{"text":"I only eat Pho when I'm in Vegas.  No other time do I think of it.  Why?  This place has the best shrimp Pho on the planet.  The broth is pretty unique.  I've not seen any other places that serve this.  This dish got me into Pho 20 years ago and counting....."}
{"text":"This place, it seems they dont care about service and attitude. When we're ready to order, they made us to wait 25min. 1st time we told them we 're ready to order, they told us \"Yeah... Wait\". Instead of coming back to take our order, he is cleaning up the table and serving other table. In about 7min, (after I saw him finished serving and cleaning the table) I am caliing him again, this time he didn't even respon and he just ignored our table. Surprisingly, the other person was standing at the cashier he just watching me while I am trying to look for someone who can take the order. Then i tried to understand maybe they are not the person who usually talking to customer. So i am waiting the 1st person who told me to wait and the same person who ignored us. Again, he is passing by our table and I am calling him to let him now that we are ready to order. He is only looking at me, raise his hand to me and keep walking. I dont know what is that suppose to mean? Well.,. Purposely, i call the man who standing at the cashier and he just staring at me without doing anything... I called again and Finally, he is get out from his 'comfort' area.. Comes to our table and took the order. But, the way he talk and his attitude was very rude! I can't accept his rudeness and attitude. I told my husband to order. I am really mad and tired with thier ignoranc already.! So I choose to keep quite. If i am not coming with my guests, i'd rather to get out from this place. It seems that this place didnt need customer. It's really Horrible service and attitude!
We ordered total of 10 dish for 6people. All 10 of Their foods are bad! None of my guests were satisfied thier choices.

If there is a scale from 0-ZERO, i will rate them definitely 0-ZERO!!! 
Since the lowest in this survey is 1..... Then I think i am so generous to give 1- since it has no Zero option available.... So i choice to rate 1. 

Definitely we wont come back! Ever!!!! So bad! There are so many better vietnamese place in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Food suck, pancake very soft lot lot of oil service is friendly so 1 star for that."}
{"text":"We often order take out rice plates from here bc the location is way closer than Chinatown. (Rice plate combo with grilled pork, egg loaf, comes with a side of pickled and fresh vegs and sauce.) Yum!"}
{"text":"Piece of shit place. They called the cops on me since they only accept cash and not credit card. Go to pho Kim long around the corner, better atmosphere and better service."}
{"text":"The parking was very difficult.The decor was really bad with pictures of the menu on the wall. Not a enough staff. They charge you $2 for 1 meat ball. The Pho soup came out lukewarm. Automatic charge 15% for party of 5 or more. The food is sub-par..not worth it. Go farther down the road for good Pho."}
{"text":"Pho not good 
Hu tieu not good 
Fried rice good. Only reason I gave it one star 
Everything else mehhhh
I would not return here. Maybe if I was desperate for food I would 
They even forgot my little cousins food. I think. The broths are not nice smelling."}
{"text":"I don't understand how this place opens 24 hours and is somewhat packed even late in the night. There's horrible customer service, not the best food and is very unorganized. The waiters are not very helpful and are very rude too, we all heard them gossiping about customers after they have left, and my family were just straight up unpleased about how childish they were. The environment isn't the best, and the food isn't worth the wait or money. If you're a tourist like I am, just look at other places to eat. I highly recommend that"}
{"text":"This place was horrible .The egg drop soup as so greasy looking, almost threw up looking at it and then the noodles yuck,yuck and the rice was hardest 4 days old rice that they added water to I left the food on the plate.
There were a few vegetables I take those out"}
{"text":"I went in an hour before they closed.  They told me they only had a limited menu because the kitchen was closed and they wanted to go home. Obviously they don't want paying customers during business hours.  Truly disappointed I was really craving some Phò"}
{"text":"Good Pho. Not crazy about their other dishes, Pho Ga and Pho Bo is good, and I like the Banh mi bo kho. But the service is exceptional. That and a good bowl of Pho will keep me coming back."}
{"text":"The best pho ga chicken noodle soup in all of Las Vegas! The staff here is professional and friendly. The soup broth is one of a kind. Very authentic. You get the real deal here. The picture menu on the walls are great in addition to the real menu. A very clean restaurant. You can get any type of meal made with an authentic Vietnamese twist any way you want! I'm addicted to this place and will return soon! So good, the ultimate comfort food."}
{"text":"This place is ok. Not superb but at the same time not horrible. I believe that they are open 24 hours now. They also serve smoothies, milk tea and boba. Their fried spring rolls are decent. The pho is mediocre. The place is nice and spacious. Average pho noodle house that could be better."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. Said excuse 5 times louder and louder each time and the guy was standing right next to me. Waited for a menu10 mins nothing so had to go up ourself to go get it. For them to come back and take our order; kept saying in a minute, 10 mins to be exact. To get our order around 20 mins. That's around an hour. So not worth it. And their \"boba\" boba are suppose to be chewy and soft. They clearly refrigerate their boba so it's super hard and gross & the Thai tea is super bitter and mostly ice."}
{"text":"Decent food. Absolutley inept staff. One in my party did get their food until we were finished. No one seemed to care. One employee told us to speak to someone else when we asked for help. Don't bother here."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Food was burnt and they even rolled their eyes when we tried to have it replaced. Never going back here !!!"}
{"text":"Pho is ok.  Beware of incorrect change when paying at the counter.  Also, when ordering small size they pretend to understand but still charge for a large.  The couple in front of us in line complain also of not being charged correctly.  Both scams.  We spoke to them in Vietnamese but they still did not fix the situation and also gave us incorrect change.  Over all the pho is not good or bad.  There are others that are better in the area like Pho Kim or Pho So 1.  If you eat here just make sure they charge correctly.  A dollar here and there overcharging per customer can add up."}
{"text":"Avoid this place at all cost, they don't have customer service skills and when you need service it's like a bother to them I would rather go to jennipoh or pho Kim long."}
{"text":"This place has terrible service. My family and I were a big group and when we walked in there was no one there to serve us. When we finally got seated they served the family that came after us before us even though we were trying to get their attention, they ignored us. It took them about 20 minutes to come back and ask us for what we wanted to order. When we got the food, everything was greasy and bland. The utensils didn't look hygienic and they place is very dirty. Never coming again."}
{"text":"I would love to give this place negative stars if I could. Piss poor service, the kind that makes you want to leave right away, and mediocre food."}
{"text":"3.5 stars to be exact, but I'll round up because its open 24 hours! :)

Nem Neong rolls + Vietnamese coffee= 2 thumbs up!"}
{"text":"The food there is quite authentic. I've enjoyed it. But some of the days I dont. I always no matter what viet restaurant I go to I get the fresh spring rolls to start off with. Here is the thing. Some of the time it's freshly rolled and mostly it's premade and left in the fridge so that's a minus. My wife always has pho when we eat there. Every time though, it changes. Its amazing at some times but majority it felt as if it was missing a few ingredients. The servers there are pretty old and less enthusiastic and do not check up on you often. I don't like that. I was sitting with an empty cup of water for the longest that I've started to chew away on the ice. That action should be telling them something..."}
{"text":"WARNING. This place is closed because they do not meet health inspections. There is mold on food and a huge coach roach infestations. You can find this on dirty dining Las Vegas. They put a sign outside that reads closed for kitchen remodel but that's not true. They keep failing their health inspections. Disgusting!"}
{"text":"First of all, if you're going to run a CASH ONLY restaurant in 2017 in the middle of a popular plaza, you should probably make an effort to bring that to diners' attention before seating them. 

Aside from that, the service was non existent, despite the fact that we were the only customers in there on a Friday night. When I asked if I could swap vegetable for noodles, or simply order a side dish of vegetables (i was willing to pay extra for this) they insisted I could ONLY order a number from the menu exactly as it was listed. 

Ambience was also nonexistent. No music, no TV. However, our waiter sat a few table away from us and repeatedly watched a video on his phone with a chicken squawking loudly. So if you count that as ambience, it's got that going for it.

The final nail in the coffin was the food itself - disgusting. I ended up ordering vegetable pho, and they somehow screwed that up. The veggies themselves weren't cooked, and the menu stated it was vegetable with no noodles - yet my dish had noodles in it. My friend ordered shrimp pho, they brought her mixed seafood pho instead, and it was so disgusting she lost her appetite for the rest of the night. 

We left without even eating our meals. There are many other restaurants nearby - do yourself a favor and stay away from this place."}
{"text":"Do not recommend! Cash only. Would not split bill what so ever. Do not eat there. I wouldn't waist my time. And go there again. They were not able to meet our request when asked and not friendly what so ever. They were very rude and told us to pay immediately and figure out our bill on our own outside."}
{"text":"We always drove by this place and never tried it. Tonight we decided to try it out, and wow! Hidden gem. Even my two year old loved it! Hot tea and iced tea for the hubby, I tried his hot tea and fell in love with the flavor and balance of the tea! Thai tea for me, perfect blend. Not too sweet. 
We got the #6, pork spring rolls. DELICIOUS. Their pork is fantastic! The flavor is phenomenal and its so tender. 
#23 pho for the husband. He loved it, we all did. Amazing base for their pho!! Heat to your own desire with everything provided on table. Yum!
#70 bun for me! Pork and egg rolls! Again the pork was fantastic, love the flavor, my two year old killed half my pork! The egg rolls were blah. Not good, to the point of bad. Wasn't enough for me to drop a star though, I just pushed the rest of the pieces to the side and made a mental note not to get the egg rolls in mine next time! 
Friendly, courteous staff! Clean! Wonderful food! Great prices! Under $10 a person! We will be back, thank you!"}
{"text":"$11 including tax for a really large bowl of pho. Got complimented and my confidence boosted by one of the servers who repetitively shouted \"HOT! HOT! HOT! Hot, behind\" as he weaved through the crowd with a tray filled with bowls of hot pho."}
{"text":"Do you believe in luck? You better if you're going to walk into a Pho place.  Finding a good and consistent Pho restaurant is like finding a flower in a mine field.  If you're careful and have lots of patience (throw in some luck), you might hit jackpot.

The three things I look for in a restaurant or eatery: 

1) Good Service
2) Good Food
3) Clean

I have frequented this place many times. Of course, most of those visits include eating with my parents.  As soon as my mother walks through the doors, most of the regular wait staff recognize her. She definitely gets the Godfather treatment.  Our servers are alway quick to take the orders and the food has been very consistent. This is probably the only Pho place that does not include an immediate visit to the restrooms after the meal.  No need for the Pepto (or Immodium) at this place. 

A story for the non-believers:

I  went to Pho Saigon with my parents during a recent visit.  Unfortunately, we probably picked one of the busiest day of the year to have Pho.  The restaurant was packed, and people were lining up at the door.  However, one of the the regular server saw my mother and waved us over to a table. Despite the full house, someone came and took our order within 5 minutes.  Our food came out all at once, in less than 15 minutes. 

There was one not-so-good moment: we had three different servers, but one lady server tried to discourage us not to order the spring roles since it was \"busy\". She told us that it would take too long to make the rolls. Obviously she was new.  The other servers got us the spring rolls quickly when they realized that we wanted the spring rolls.  They also brought out an extra dish of tripe when my mother accidentally ordered my Pho without the tripe. The (regular) servers went above and beyond to help us with the orders.

Asian restaurants definitely operate on a different level compared to western style restaurants. You're not going to get the same service and the same quality of food. Pho Little Saigon is not Tallaivante.  It's not your typical TGI Friday franchise. It's a local place owned by local people.  The service can be sketchy, but the food is consistent.  It's my little Saigon.

Some of my fav dishes:

-Pho tai nam + bo vien
-com thit nung +  tom nung
-Ban hoi thit nung + tom nung
-cafe su da
-che ba mau
-goi coun"}
{"text":"I'd actually give this place 3 stars but people just hating so hard, figured I'd throw them a bone. Anyway, 24 hours for pho is great. After a night of gambling and drinking, my group needed a little detox session. This place did just that. I was actually kind of mad that we went here at 6am because I just wanted to sleep, but glad we did afterward because it was pretty delicious. Not sure what I ordered, beef slices probably because I usually skip the organ cuts. Can't comment on the other dishes, but maybe next time I'll try them."}
{"text":"I'm not impress at all!  Food doesn't taste like traditional pho.  Lacking in flavor and the fact that they take cash and note post it clearly, was irritating.  The sign was hidden behind a tall plant and it wasn't until we were all ready to leave when we were told, it's cash only.  I feel bad for giving it a one star, so the second star is a pity star.  Ended up where some of us had to find an ATM machine to get cash.  At least with all the \"cash only\" establishment, they make it very clear.  This place has all the signs but all in hidden view.  This type of shadiness is a huge turn off!  With so many options, why be shady?  Because food and services are non-existent so they have to be shady.  Highly advise against coming here unless you have be choice!"}
{"text":"I've been here before and I remember it being good food with decent service.  Stopped by here recently with the family again.  Was seated right away.  While walking to our table, I did notice that half their tables were  full of dirty dishes.  No one seems to bus tables here.  

So I ordered a rice dish with pork chop, eggloaf and shredded pork.  It was good. I actually liked the pork chop.  It had a nice sweet glaze on it.  Wifey and son had a simple bowl of pho.  My parents each ordered pho also.  Each item we got was $7.99.

So while we were waiting for our food, I noticed these 3 little kids cleaning the tables.  The youngest one was probably 4 or 5, no joke. My wife and I were like....WTF?!

After we were served, which didn't take too long.  But then again, the restaurant was pretty empty.  I go up and ask for the bill.  They didn't give me an actual bill.  The guy just told me the total was $51 dollars.  I actually did some calculating while I was eating.  I ordered 5 items at $7.99 each..So thats $39.95.  Tax rate for restaurants in Vegas is 8.1%.  That comes out to $43.18.  So how the heck did he get to $51 dollars?  Whatever.  I just paid it and left.

Afterwards I read some of the other reviews on this restaurant and found out that this is not the only time the restaurant has ripped off a customer.  Apparently they overcharge several customers regularly.

To make matters worse, I learned (afterwards) that they were shut down not too long ago from health department.  Are you kidding me?!  There's a video of them on Dirty Dining.  Check it out.

So we had decent food.  But kids cleaning tables, overcharged for our food, and shut down by health department.  That's a definite NO-RETURN in my book."}
{"text":"How is this place still in business? It's totally ridiculous with the things they get away with. Dirty plates, bowls, glass. Awful food. They rip you off one way or another either thru forced tip or miscalculating your meal.

And to be shut down various times for roach infestation? C'mon people, get a clue !"}
{"text":"took a chance, BAD IDEA.


it was worse in the morning if ya know what i mean. ;)"}
{"text":"My fav phò period!  As you can tell from my check-ins I I've been there allot and only had one bad service experience."}
{"text":"come from Maryland (where Pho is abundant) and New York (where pho is few and far in between), I was really excited when my friend recommended me this place while I was staying in Vegas.

This place ISTHEBOMB.COM. great prices and selection of food. the pho broth is probably one of the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and let's just say my most recent visit wasn't really that enjoyable.

I understood that the place was very busy considering it was New Year's Day aka Hangover Day and pho is the cure to all hangovers and such. But that is no excuse for not having good customer service. 

First off, the place was very unorganized. Some people were taken to tables not cleaned yet, having to stand and wait for workers to clean them. Others were actually sat at dirty tables. Secondly, it took quite a bit of time to even receive menus. As soon as we received our menus, it then took forever to get our order taken and even get our beverages out. Plus, two tables who were sat after us initially received service before we even did. Furthermore while one of the servers took my order, he back sassed me when I was just trying to confirm whether or not he jotted down what I wanted correctly. We received our beverages (keep in mind we only had waters) ten minutes after our order was taken and received our food more than half an hour later. It just seemed as if it was hard for the servers to keep track of which tables came first. The ambience even felt a bit off, as the servers shouted to each other from across the room. I feel as if they need to develop a better system to keep everything in an orderly fashion. 

As for the food, I ordered spring rolls and pho with chicken. The peanut sauce for the spring rolls had a bit too much of a coconut flavor in it, while the chicken in the pho was a bit spongey in texture. 

Overall, not a great experience. If it wasn't for the fact that this place is 24/7 (convenient for those drunken late nights/early mornings) and the fact that I came here before when it was far less busy and rather very slow, I would've gave it one star."}
{"text":"It truly breaks my heart having to write this review, but I feel obliged to write a review on this once decent restaurant. Feel free to take my review w/ a grain of salt and experience it for yourself, but don't set your bar too high..

I've been coming here for PHO on Sundays after my vegas trip for the past couple of years and it was not until my trip yesterday did I notice that the quality of their PHO has gone down tremendously.

I ordered the special (#21) and it was just okay. They still served your pho in a big bowl but in my bowl, but in my bowl I did not find too many pieces of meat and I thought the soup was not served hot enough... 

I also noticed that they've recently raised the prices on their pho. What the pho? Sigh. I was so disappointed. I guess all good things must come to an end. I need to find myself a new decent PHO restaurant in Vegas to cure my Sunday morning hangovers in Vegas."}
{"text":"When I find a place that like, I become a loyal customer. Pho Little Saigon on Eastern and Serene is my favorite pho restaurant in the area. 
Food is delicious. I know what I want and so do the employees since I've become a regular. Kim knows what to give me when I walk in. Hai takes very good care of me as well. I love and appreciate when I walk in and the employees know you and how to treat you as a regular. They are familiar with how I want my food. 

Not a fancy place, but a good place for me. I bring everyone here when I or they crave pho."}
{"text":"The details:
Seating was quick. 
I had pho menu #22 and my better half had BBQ #34.  There were basting brush bristles on her BBQ.  When we told the waiter he shrugged and said, it was just an old brush that's all.
We also ordered #1 spring rolls for an appetizer but they never made it.  When we paid they didn't have a problem removing the rolls from the bill.
The food didn't satisfy me."}
{"text":"Thought that I was able to take my family to enjoy authentic food in Vegas but boy was I wrong. Horrible service.  Waiters are rude, yelling at customers if the customer says that the order was wrong. Can't enjoy the food if the service if so bad...horrible experience"}
{"text":"Even though pho is not on the higher end for demands in vegas, we came here to dine for breakfast during our vacation since my boyfriends parents' previous experience was good. despite that fact, what we experienced this time around was nothing compared to what it was before. The pho was edible, but not what you'd settle for if you knew how pho is really supposed to taste like. A few of us thought that the broth tasted weird, and that the meat somehow tasted fake. Personally, i thought it was mediocre, just not the high quality kind you'd expect from a vietnamese-rooted restaurant. At the end of our meal, the check came out to be 102, with only 8 of us all ordering pho, which does not add up. I guess somewhere along the way, the math got messed up, or they tried to gyp us due to our large party. either way, go elsewhere for pho if you're considering this place. if not, then save your cravings for when youre back home!"}
{"text":"When we wanna order we call 3 servers they said: okok coming after few mins someone help us order the food.
........... N probably we wait around 30mins .. I feel so hungry already I saw some ppl then come late then us but they're eating already so I go to ask the server how come we wait 30 mins the food still not coming yet? He said ok then I go back my table n he coming he said: u guys only jus wait 23mins! So is my problem right now????? N the Service attitude was BAD! At less said \"sorry\"! 
N u guys is a service if u guys attitude no good so jus go home go find other jobs"}
{"text":"Open 24 hours. Pho wasnt as good as my hometown of bolsa in Cali but the line in the oyster bar was way too long. Came here long time ago with family and I don't remember it being this bad. Definitely over priced. 8 bucks for shitty pho? Guess cant complain we are in vegas. I would definitely try other pho places if you have the chance."}
{"text":"Worst service I've ever gotten. My friend kindly asked for sweet and sour sauce, the server rudely said \"NO!\" Also, it was the first time I ordered the egg roll & rice vermicelli, the server did not warn me that there are peanuts & I'm allergic to peanuts. Do they not know how common peanut allergies are!! They should've at least listed \"nuts\" in the food description. It's not the first time I've been here & I've never gotten poor customer service here. I'm surprised they don't check on their customers if they need anything else. Not once did I see any of the servers come up to us to see if everything was ok. I waited so long to get a refill on my drink. We seriously wasted our money here! We came for the rare steak pho but they were all crossed out so we had to pick out the crappy food they sold instead. Should've took the crossed out pho as a warning!! I wasn't going to rate them but I finally got my refill I give them 1 star only!"}
{"text":"Bun thit nuong i order was stale 
When i told them about it 
They brought out a side order of fresh vermicille right away
I m like you guy probably try to give me the old vermicelle one first,
kind of pricey ,guess cause it s in Vegas
Pho was good portion size was kinda small ,i can eat 2 bowl to fill me up"}
{"text":"Eating here several times and have yet to be disappointed. The flavor of their breath is delicious and comes with a generous amount of meat. Probably better than most places as far as serving size is considered."}
{"text":"Very slow, servers are ignorance. First time here also the last too. Pho taste average of you are generous or hungry."}
{"text":"I heard about this restaurant from a friend who recommended it since I am a Pho Soup addict! We sampled quite a few dishes tonight. If you enjoy chicken wings, you won't be disappointed! Some of the best Vietnamese wings I have ever had. The spring rolls were delish & Pho soup was on point. Check this restaurant out the next time you're in Las Vegas Chinatown. If you're a coffee freak, dump Starbucks for the amazing Vietnamese coffee here. Plus check out the beautiful photography by the owner!!"}
{"text":"I am embarrassed to say I used to eat here at least twice per week for a year. The straw that broke the camelbacks was they asked me if I wanted a small or large Pho I said small when it came out it was a large. I mentioned that I ordered a small the waiter said take it or leave it I was shocked. Also this place started to get real unkept and dirty it was not like this before. This place is absolutely repulsive and dirty. After watching ktlv videos how could anyone eat at this establishment. Close this place and ban the owners from ever opening up a restaurant in the future. You have been warned. Watch the videos."}
{"text":"The bun was good and the portions large. Went with Number 92. Beautiful traditional music and interesting Buddhist icons give it a touch of the exotic.  Service a bit slow and waiters never smiled, but acceptable.  Lots of other options in the area - would try something else next time."}
{"text":"First 24 Hr Pho joint I ever encountered! Serving 40 different types of Pho (yes 40!) and has quick service as well.

Great for those after the club meals (forget Gryros) or early morning hangovers!"}
{"text":"there are 3 Pho places between sunrdige hieights and the 2-15 that I know of. Pho Mai lan, Pho Saigon 8 and this place. Out of the 3 this is by far the best. The Pho here is the most authentic out of the 3. Pho mai lan is just like plain beef broth no real Pho flavor. Pho Saigon 8 for some reason the broth is a bit sour if you taste it before adding the noodles, meat and veggies (once you add those things its good but it still doesn't have the true Pho flavor). This place Pho Little Saigon is definitely my go to place when I am to lazy to make my own traditional Vietnamese food at home. I just wish they delivered!!! Why is it that none of these places deliver?! they could make way more money!!!! Now that i'm done griping about delivery you really need to come here for some real authentic Pho. It is also the most reasonable in price! They also have a $4.99 Chinese lunch special. I really think you should skip the fast food and come here!!! Everyone is very nice and I am never disappointed with my order. just a bit sad they offer egg rolls and no true spring rolls! I got this place mixed up with Pho Saigon 8 so I need to go and adjust my review accordingly. I did think the Chinese menu wasn't all that great because I did it for take out and it was very soggy because they put the sauce on the sweet and sour and not on the side like most establishments have started practicing. So if you are ordering the Chinese portion that has batter with sauce I would certainly ask for the sauce to be put on the side. The fried rice is a bit too oily, I am really more a fan of the Vietnamese portion of the menu rather then the Chinese but I would still come here instead of for instance panda express. The lemon grass beef is better then the lemon grass chicken. it seems like the beef pickes up more of the lemon grass then the chicken does. but Pho sure you will never be disappointed with their awesome Pho!!! I give the Pho a 5 but the establishment a 4 because I think the Chinese portion is a 3!!! good luck in finding your perfect Pho place!!!"}
{"text":"The worst Pho I've ever have in my life. Price is expensive. Pho Saigon 8 is a lot better!"}
{"text":"First time eating here, I didn't have a good impression. I understand that the staff are very busy and forgot our water, not much of a big deal but we were in a large group and the waiters served only half of our table at once. I felt that the we were rushed to order. They were very under staff. The food was okay. Some of the staffs got our order wrong."}
{"text":"I love this place. I have no idea why it is always empty when I come. I get the beef noodle pho soup, brisket. I'm obsessed. I go once or twice a week!  They have gotten to know me for sure. Lol. Always so nice, always smiling. Lunch specials are cheap and delicious too ! $5.99! Can't beat the prices."}
{"text":"so bad ! bad service and nasty food.. sorry I have to give 1 star ..never had such a bad experience!

Server was rude when we ask no ice he gave us this bad look you never forget!

My chicken inside the pho was stale! I had to take it out of the soup

WE FOUND A HUGE PIECE OF PLASTIC INSIDE MY BOY FRIEND THE PHO! (I wish we took a pic of that but we didnt)

in that point we paid and left.. never again"}
{"text":"Stop now! Think twice!!!
I came here because pho Kim long had a line... Worst mistake ever...  The server not only had broken English but had no common sense. I said I'd like veggie pho and no drink just water... 

He brought everyone else's food..  And not mine, when I asked where mine was he yelled at me and argued that I had ordered nothing.

A seriously comical experience."}
{"text":"I was just there on Wednesday afternoon on vacation. My family wanted to eat some vietnamese food after all the junk we had on our long drive from SF to LV. This is by far one of the worst vietnamese restaurants I've ever ate at. The pho broth is SO salty and I had a pho dac biet.  Tell me why I only had ONE HALF of a BEEF BALL? wtf. My sister ordered the same and also had only one half of a beef ball. They skimp on meat and noodles & leave you with basically a huge bowl full of salty broth. I'd NEVER go here again the next time I'm down in LV. AND it was expensive as hell."}
{"text":"We love pho noodles and I really love fresh shrimp spring rolls. This place did not disappoint! We ordered to go, and the portions were generous, and the price was fair. I went in just before dinner time, and the workers had their families there eating. I didn't want to disturb there family time but two of them jumped up and got to my order right away. Plus you know it must be good if they are eating there :-) This has diner atmosphere, so very casual. We got the rare beef pho and it was awesome! I like when the package the items separately, so it is freshly made at home, and isn't sitting in the broth during the drive. Also ordered the shrimp fresh spring rolls, which were equally yummy."}
{"text":"I ordered pho on the phone using the number listed here on yelp. They didn't have a proper menu on here so I just ordered ONE typical combo pho. She said ok and took my name and number then hung up? Lol cool. 15 mins later I go and pick it up. The lady tells me she didn't get any phone orders. I'm like okay.. maybe I called the wrong pho store. I go back to my car and calls the same number and the SAME lady picks up and tells me sorry blah blah blah. I couldn't understand her in her accent but I went back in and she said more stuff I didn't understand and kept apologizing. Then she charges me $18 for one pho and I said I only ordered ONE order. She said no you ordered two and I confirmed with you many times. I'm like no you did not and I'm pretty sure I only ordered one pho. I just talked to you 15 mins ago when placing this ordered so Im pretty sure I remember clearly. She gives me a refund and I had two wait for my pho(sigh).. The pho was pretty good so Ill give a one star but I will not be returning. The customer service was terrible."}

{"text":"We are hainan chicken and rice. It took 15 min for the food to come out and there were only 2 customers in the restaurant.  The chicken was tuff and only 3  pieces were eatable for $9 and the rest were f bone with skin. This place had gone to the dog."}
{"text":"AlsoPho meat was like shoe leather, broth had no flavor whatsoever. Egg rolls were like soggy dog food. Chicken curry I ordered was in a very bland sauce BONE IN, which was not in the menu. Needless to say I didn't finish it. When I asked for kid chopstick helpers for my daughter I got a rude response of only having plastic silverware. The only mildly redeeming quality of this place was their fried rice which was edible but quite greasy. Will never return here. Sorry guys. Service could be better as well.

Also it says CASH ONLY up front, but they take cards."}
{"text":"My family and I(4 adults +11 month old) came in on 6/19/16. I am Vietnamese born in America, so you are not getting an honest review from a person who eats pho all the time. They were not busy, had 2 other parties that sat down before us. Our server was as old man who brought us our water quickly, Good Job, but did not bring me a high chair or asked if I needed. I asked and brought me one but it did not have any clips for the belt and was ready to take our order, I asked to give us a minute and I felt that he expected for me to have our order ready. The menu is extensive and I want to explore the menu and see anything exotic/different. When he came back my father-in-law being vietnamese did not know how to read english and asked if there was small for the pho and he responded \"No\", rudely and there's only regular. I change the high chair myself and none of them had clips but there was one that was tied, I used that one. They brought out our pho but it wasn't not steaming hot but warm. I finished my water and I moved it towards to the waiter to show him that it is empty. He did not bring a pitcher, I walked over to my the table next to me that had the pitcher of water and refilled it myself. I am in Las Vegas, it's in the middle of summer, people get thirsty. They shouldn't have to asked to get water refilled. I put my herbs and bean sprouts in my pho, since the pho broth was not hot my bean sprouts didn't get soft still raw not a picky eater. The flavor of the beef broth was more water down and plain. The original waiter never came back to serve us but another server came by and refilled our waters. I came to the register and paid noticed that it was cash only. I was told the price and I asked for the reciept and noticed that they charged extra $2 for rare sliced beef on the side, father-in-law asked for rare sliced beef on the side not extra sliced beef. We got more beef it's ok. I talked to the cashier that rang me up and told him that the old guy was rude and this is a service industry that it's important. I said that I'm from out of town. I will never come back here. Save yourself from a bad experiance, there plenty of other places to go in the asian district then this place. I noticed from other post that they charged a 15% mandatory tip. I did not notice will I was checking out."}
{"text":"I ordered pho and 2 banh mi sandwiches to go. The pho was to dine in, they brought my pho right away and it was delicious but they never gave me my sandwiches that I paid for. 25 minutes pass I finished my pho and I asked for my banh mi and they say they are making it: give them 5 more minutes,  I give them 10 then I ask about it and they said they did not make them. They gave me my money back. 
What kind of business is this where you bullshit someone for 35 minutes then say we didn't even bother to cook your food we just took your money, what a waste of my time, very bad service they only cater to Asians, if your a \"round eye\"  stay away they will treat you like a stupid forginer that does not belong there and make you feel uncomfortable being there, I will never go back"}
{"text":"Came here Sunday afternoon. Wait wasn't too bad. We ordered two rolls and a fried egg roll. They were not tasty at all kinda tasted bad and it had a bad after taste. Didn't want to complain since it was busy and it was a first time here. We order two beef pho's, one beef stew and a bun. The stew didn't look good I didn't try it nor did I try the pho. I had the bun and it wasn't as good as others such as pho Saigon 8 or noodle bar. Didn't see a sign that said large parties they put a service charge but whatever we got billed. They only take cash so be aware. I won't be going there anytime soon. First and last time eating there.. over priced for noodle soup but now we know."}
{"text":"Stopped in a weekday evening @ 9pm as we specifically chose this place over Pho Saigon 8 since both were open till 10pm. We wanted Pho Milan but unfortunately they closed @ 9pm. Wished we would have gone to Pho Saigon 8 instead. Booths were dirty as there were food crumbs all over the seats & menus felt sticky. Servers we ok in the beginning of the visit but then as soon as they brought our food they set the bill down & wanted payment right then & there. Waitress stood over us till we put the money out. I had barley taken 2 spoonfuls of soup when they did this & she was asking if I wanted a to go container. I told her I would later. The hovering was just rude & annoying. I get you close @ 10 but there were a good 20 other people in the place & ot was like 9:40pm. They also forgot the sandwich we ordered & when we mentioned it she tried to say they were baking the bread for it because they make everyone of them from scratch. Give me a break you don't bake the french baguette upon order of a sandwich. Ordered seafood soup & it was just mediocre. Not a whole lot of flavor. Ordered the spring rolls & they were not freshly made. Servers kept eyeballing us to get us out of there making us feel uncomfortable so we finally took our food to go. I will never return to be treated like that. Rather take my money elsewhere."}
{"text":"I don't know what everyone is talking about. The service was great, they came by to check on us a lot, maybe they are improving from all the negative feedback in service? Pho Dac Biet was very satisfying and authentic, broth was excellent. Fresh coconut (actual fruit) was perfect and eating the fruit with a spoon was easy since they brought us young coconuts and not old ones. 

My group all paid separate and we believe we were all ripped off a bit. Didn't make sense that my pho + coconut drink came out to be $13...but didn't notice til after I paid and thought about it. The rest of the group felt they might have been jipped a few dollars too. Make sure to be conscious of what you are paying because they don't provide a receipt when you pay at the cashier."}
{"text":"Staff was extremely rude and probably racist. Came in with my black friends and some Filipino ones and sat down for some pho. As we entered the store they slapped on the \"cash only\" sign and started staring at us the whole time. We were kinda curious why but never bothered to ask. We all got pho except for 2 of us who got the chicken and rice. When it came down to paying for the split checks 3 ways we asked if we could pay card. There was 6 of us and we weren't even an issue we just enjoyed our food. When we asked to pay card the workers all got upset and accepted our cards anyways. As we try to make them understand how to split our checks (which wasn't hard at all but they made it so difficult and yelled at us ALOT) they still somehow messed it up. THEY EVEN ADDED 15% GRATUITY. WE DIDN'T KNOW UNTIL MY FRIEND GOOGLE TRANSLATED ONE OF THE THINGS THEY CHARGED US THAT WAS IN VIETNAMESE. Don't go here it's just terrible customer service unless you're viet too."}
{"text":"When living in DC, the crew I worked with introduced me to PHO. I am happy to find a place so close that has good PHO. 

The people who work there are attentive. I will continue to go."}
{"text":"Visited twice (New Year day and couple days later) -- service on New Year day was totally unacceptable (disorganized and RUDE servers, even by Chinatown standards).  Pho soup was very good, BUT there was hardly any meat in the bowl.  Don't think it was just the busy crowd on NYD, the 80% empty restaurant visit the Sunday after got marginally better service, but the pho served still had very little meat in it.  Compared to Pho Kim Long, Little Saigon is light years behind."}
{"text":"First time eating there with my family and it was pretty good esp the sandwiches and the customer service is good friendly people"}
{"text":"Pho Little Saigon is 24/7!  It's not fancy, you go up to pay after, but that's pretty standard with most pho places.  The menu is extensive, and there are photos on the walls.  I got either a #15 or a #17, I can't remember but I know it was one or the other and it was good.  Really good broth, very hot, very satisfying. My friend and I weren't feeling so great and it cleared our sinuses. We shared spring rolls with shrimp and this peanut sauce.  I wasn't feeling shrimp when I walked in but this was clean, it was perfect.  I also got a thai iced tea and it wasn't overly sweet.  I almost forgot, this place is cash only! Bring money."}
{"text":"I took a shot and tried the bun bo hue and that really didn't work out. The pho broth is ok, its not the best. They could have done way better. The atmosphere is so hectic. The service isn't the best either. We had to ask multiple times and multiple servers for the same thing. They also brought the wrong dishes to our table. This isn't the best restaurant to eat at."}
{"text":"Average to below-average for Pho (of course does not compare to Southern California) but I'd still be back from time to time... sometimes you just crave authentic Asian food when you're in Vegas... where else are you gonna get it?"}
{"text":"Didn't find this place on Yelp like we usually do(we were from out of town). We were driving by and just decided to try it out. Bad mistake! First, we waited forever to order(over 45min). They didn't come over until we finally said that we were ready. When the guy came over my husband was prepared to order for the whole table. We had 10 people all together(my parents, my hubby's parents and some of his relatives). My husband started to order and he was trying to get the order straight in his mind because he didn't want to mess up my dad's order(he's on a special diet because he's diabetic). The guy got annoyed said we weren't ready rolled his eyes and left to help someone paying at the register. We were shocked that he just left. He finally came back and took our order with attitude. My husband was so upset and wanted to leave telling his mom that he shouldn't talk to customer's that way but she talked him into staying. A long time later our food finally came(except for mine...I didn't want to ask for it because I didn't want them to spit in it). My mom got her food and she was supposed to have Noodles but there was none. We didn't say anything, my mom still ate it. The guy was passing around the pho and asking who had the one he was holding while he stood right beside my mother in law. She said, \"right here.\" And he continued to ask with attitude. Wrong thing to do w/my mother in law. She slammed her chopsticks down and yelled at him, \"right here!\" Then she proceeded to yell at him about how her son wanted to leave but she talked him to staying and why does he have to talk to us that way. The whole table couldn't even enjoy their food. And I just watched everyone else eat because remember I never got my order. If I could give this place no stars I would. My hubby was still angry hours later and it's just sad that someone can ruin your whole day like that. I would NEVER come here again!"}
{"text":"This is the most disgusting restaurant that I ever been in my life. First of all after eating my food today and had to wash my hand the bathroom is hella dirty hella shit on the floor and never been checked out if someone cleaning this bathroom and then I saw the cook when in the bathroom with the gloves on and aprons on and then left the bathroom with the same gloves and April's on without washing his hand, I'm trying to talk to this guy but this guy didn't speak English. So imagine what they doing behind the scene making you food. Also the waiter and  owner they don't give a fuck how with the customer. They take your order like shit,no respect to you and not listening the order you have to tell them several times before they get you order because they keep interrupting you while you telling them what you want.this people  nothing you will see in any restaurant how this people act. it's really terrible but fuck there customer  service just the food alone how they handle the food it's fucked up already and that the most important of all.if you want to see it if i am telling  I truth go ahead and come to see this restaurant for yourself, and tell me or reply did this review for this restaurant if I'm lying.but me I  will never come back in this restaurant ever ever ever again. Nasty people that's why I threw up after that seeing that shit. On the top of this they automatically take 15% gratitude without telling you and showing you the receipt so you will double the tips this is really fucked up people fuck this restaurant."}
{"text":"I noticed a bunch of Pho places on Spring during my trip to Vegas this past weekend.

Having partied hardy the night before, our group decided Pho was definitely in order.

Maybe I'm spoiled a bit because I've had the best Pho in San Jose and Westminster... and so my Pho standards are pretty high.

I felt it was an okay place at first glance: clean, lots of Vietnamese locals, and spacious.

The pho was really average. The broth lacked body and substance, and could have possibly been adulterated with some Swanson's chicken broth. I hate that. The noodles were okay, but the meat was TOTALLY skimpy in the large. There are MEATBALLS in Pho Dac Biet, I got no such meat in my bowl and no tripe either =(

I also ordered some Vietnamese Ice Coffee (Cafe Sua Da) and it wasn't strong enough. They skimped on the coffee grounds. I like places that prepare the french press in front of you instead of going to the back and giving you pre-stirred drinks, but they shafted me on the strength. It tasted watered down.

I'd probably never come back unless it were like the AM and I was desperately wasted.

The service kind of sucked too. We were all hungover and needed water. We had to ask 100x times for refills!

This place kind of reminds of the quality and even appearance of Lee's Noodle House in San Jose off of Tully Rd.... If you're from San Jose, you know what I'm talking about - this is Lee's Noodle House twin brother in Vegas."}
{"text":"I came here with my family and friends of about 11 people. We were ALL craving pho and went here. Considering there were 2-3 other pho places within walking vicinity of this joint... I wished we tried those places instead haha. 

#1: EXPENSIVE - I live perhaps 20 minutes from Little Saigon and this pho place actually charges ~$7.99 for a bowl of pho? Are you kidding me? I was expecting it to be a mind-blowing experience when I sipped the broth... but nope! I've had better. The price and the bowl of pho was a bit of a letdown.

#2: SLOW SERVICE - Ok, it was pretty busy in here but they took forever to even acknowledge our presence from the time we started ordering to when we finished eating.

#3: CRAMPED SPACE - I felt so squished. How many people do they wanna jam into location? My chair was touching another chair in back of me and a little toddler kept trying to play (or grab) my hair. Hmph. Cute kid but c'mon... 

Sigh."}
{"text":"One star is just for their food. Horrible service and terrible environment. Long long wait to find a waiter to order. Because there are only two waiters serving during lunch hour on thanksgiving weekend. Their boss who just guide you to the seat but won't help any more. We asked for a highchair and he told me to go bring by myself!? Don't go there anymore"}
{"text":"One thing I really like about this pho restaurant is the meat:noodle ratio. Usually most places I go to serve way too much noodles and like 4 pieces of meat, but this place is very generous with their portions. The reason I give it a 3/5 is because there was just a handful of downsides. 

CONS:
-the water taste disgusting; I advise to either get a canned beverage or BOTTLED water.
-the smell of the actual restaurant smells like old wet towels or a wet dog.
-the bean sprouts they serve on the side for your pho was super brown and grimey. You definitely could tell it was NOT fresh.
-there were obviously 3 people designated to be runners/servers, but two of them just sat around on their phone and had another bus/wait on the tables and it was fairly busy.

PROS:
-our waiter was attentive and super polite.
-a lot of parking spaces in the parking lot.
-generous portions for an affordable price."}
{"text":"This review is based on 3 visits there, 2 lunches and 1 dinner.

Overall, it was just OK but I would love to give a higher star.  Why not 3 stars? because the inconsistencies of the product.  On the first day (lunch) we order pho (good), rice dish (also good), the salted peppered squid (love it) and Vietnamese style ice coffee.  We enjoyed them all very much and even ordered the squid to go for our road trip (where there are no Asian food) to stretch our our cravings.   Based on that meal it would be a solid 4 stars.  BUT....

6 days later we came back for dinner and that meal was barely a 2 star. The same exact dish looked different, tasted different, squid was tough. All of us were disappointed.  The day time chef was much better (after all this place opens 24 hr a day in Vegas).  To prove our theory, we went back the following day for lunch and again the food is good.

If you are reading this, go lunch time.  Don't go dinner time.

Price wise I felt it was a little on the expensive side compared to the San Francisco Bay Area (specifically San Jose and Milpitas area). But to get the similar quality food in the middle of the dessert is something I am not complaining.  Our three meals for family of 4 is around $60."}
{"text":"Sooo this was my husband and I first time here We read the reviews before coming but decided to give it a try anyways &&& the service was horrible my water never got refilled ..... there was no option with meatballs and all the meat .... I had to Order a side Order 3meatballs for ($2.00). I asked for a second plate of bean sprouts and got less then I did for the first one .... (we ordered two #14) ... the manager does come and check on you ... we got our food within 5 mins .... but I had to eat my appetizer with my pho ... (even though I asked for the dumplings to come out first) the dumplings wear good .... the broth to the pho had no flavor I had to put way to much of my own seasoning just to make it flavorful they do give you a good amount tho for $9.99 I guess.... probably won't come back service was just to slow for me .... they was nice though ..."}
{"text":"A good place to eat a decent PHO or Vietnamese food. 

Every time, I'm in Vegas... this is a must stop for my family. Especially since it's 24/7 . It doesn't matter what time I arrive... I can count on getting a hot bowl of Pho Bo Vien. 

The exterior isn't much to look at but the inside has a welcoming vibe. 

You can either self seat or wait till they assign you a table. The food comes pretty fast. It's not the best pho place but it can do when you just want a bowl of soup. 

Con for me: owner and staff talks loud. Especially since I can understand Vietnamese. They aren't good with customer service. Not sure if I can say they are welcoming. 

Another thing: make sure to request for a check. You will see... they charge you qualities already. So you don't have to tip them even more. Tipping should be by choice. I understand if you come with 20 people. But being sneaky and not letting the guest know. Now.. that got me mad."}
{"text":"This is the first pho place I tried in vegas, and up until this past weekend, I thought of it kind of as that trusty down jacket that you wear in the winters - it keeps you warm and serves its purpose, but you don't exactly feel sexy in it.

After this weekend, however, that all changed.

In a nutshell, I had the most delicious freakin' broth of my LIFE.  It was SO GOOD, and I've had plently of good pho places, being from la, and having gone to school in norcal.  The broth was just incredible - we were still raving about it hours after the meal.  Here are a few other things I like about this place (other than the awesome pho soup of course):

1. Their summer rolls are just the right amount of chewiness, and have a spring of mint, which gives them a nice freshness.

2. They have a huge menu (including some more traditional chinese items), and many of the items have corresponding pictures, which helps when you're trying to decide what to order.

3. They have a pho soup that's just rare steak and tripe, which is my favorite combo.

4.  There's never a wait and they always refill your water without your having to ask.

Here are a few not so great things:

1.  The food is a bit inconsistent - as I said, we've been here a few times, and while it was never BAD, it was not really always so GOOD.  So it's a bit of a gamble walking into this place.

2.  It's cash only.

Overall, I'd say that this place is pretty darn decent, and occasionally mind blowingly freakin' awesome."}
{"text":"I didn't have a particular destination, just whatever Pho place that was open on our way home. We dropped in on this place. They've their pictured menu plastered all over the walls. Helpful, I'll say.

I like that they used pork belly meat along with shrimp in the traditional spring rolls. The Bun Bo Hue I ordered was made right, perfectly seasoned. I ordered Chinese donuts on the side since my boyfriend ordered Pho n could eat that with the soup as well. My BF had the Viet coffee which was good and I had a fresh coconut, cold n refreshing. 

Pretty good meal, held us all the way to Santa Barbara."}
{"text":"Last night I was eating at pho little Saigon was so dirty the soup was not tasting , I never coming back"}
{"text":"I would say this place has authentic Vietnamese food I mean the workers are so fob and there's like Vietnamese music and Vietnamese TV playing in there. But service is kinda shitty like they won't serve you right away like pho Kim long even tho they're not even busy but I swear the pho is so delicious and they're not stingy on their portions of noodles either. I ordered also an avocado drink and that was pretty damn good. Our waiter was really friendly, and the place is also very big and spacious so ambience was very chill. I came back a second time because pho Kim long was packed and then I saw that the health department had shut them down for over 50 demerits so they must've had rats or something !! and that's very disappointing because their pho was so good ),: ugh dirty dining, is it that hard to keep the place clean?? But anyways yeah 3 stars"}
{"text":"This is really my go-to spot for Pho.  Perfect for winter because the soup is hot!  I usually come here late night when I want some soup.

Food is good, service is 3 star A-OK, and its all table seating.  When they take my order, I never see them write anything on a pad, they take orders all by memory.  I bet they'll need it with a party of 20! hahaha!  The sandwiches are good too, but I have another place I go to for vietnamese sandwiches in china town.

Eh, I guess its not the best, but the prices are low and the portions are big.  MY KINDA RESTAURANT!

Not- So-Quick-Tip: they have boba drinks, and they have the BEST AVOCADO BOBA DRINK IN LV!"}
{"text":"Check my reviews... I am not a picky eater and find it my calling to give generous reviews. So here I am, pondering my life's meaning when I have to give this place a one star review. 

How did we get to this? What else do I live for? Well, certainly not for the pho of this place, where the broth is flavorless, the meat unidentifiable, the vegetables withered, the plates and scissor (to cut our toddlers' meals into bit-sized pieces) dirty, the staff unruly, and our bill's total calculated by a classified algorithm that cannot seem to itemize anything. 

It is time to reevaluate my life. Maybe today's the day I develop these so called \"standards\" everyone's been raving about when it comes to eating at certain places."}
{"text":"Worst customer service!! Came here during 4th of July. The server is rude. I will not come back here again! He said the food is made as is and couldn't accommodate to our needs such as no onions, adding egg to a rice plate, etc."}
{"text":"They have Pho & Vietnamese hot pot with shrimp, fish, beef, squid. The egg rolls are usually fresh & taste great. There are pictures of the menu items everywhere but they don't have majority of the items so it's kind of a hit or miss sometimes lol.

The service is a little slow, so if you're impatient,  this is NOT the place for you. The quality of food is good though so give it a chance"}
{"text":"We left the club and were hungry....where do we go!?
Considering we were a group that vastly consisted of Asians...pho was a pretty obvious choice. However, what did surprise me was that a 24 hours pho place existed. 
It seemed like an amazing novel idea whilst in my drunken stupor. It didn't quite sink in that we were in Vegas and everything is always open.

As we walked to grab a taxi....I meowed like a cat at a guy walking by. I still don't know wtf I was thinking. He said something like, \"hey there kitty\" or something. I got freaked out and quickly hobbled away in pain. Damn you, stilettos!
I never thought my pseudo pick up line would be successful =[

When we finally got a taxi, I got shot gun and quickly discovered that our taxi driver was high....I could just tell! But he got us there safely so that's all that matters.

Once we were there and sat down, the waiter kept ignoring us even though the place was super empty.
I ordered pho and a thai tea boba.
The tapioca sucked. The consistency was really hard to chew and swallow. The pho was okay, nothing special but price wise...it was on the expensive side. Ah, Vegas prices.

I dropped my money plus tip and peaced out early.
As I hobbled away slowly, in excruciating pain from my damn shoes in order to hail a taxi....I mused: Um, did we really have to come all the way to Vegas to go to the Asian part of town???

At least I was called a \"hot betch\" by some chick driving by in a taxi and \"hot\" by some random dude back at the hotel.
It made the pain I was experiencing a tad less severe."}
{"text":"Craving pho this cold and rainy night and instead of Saigon 8 in Henderson, our usual pho restaurant, We decided to  try out Pho Little Saigon , which was across the street from Saigon 8.  

There were 4 other people in Little Saigon when we pulled up and there was lots of room with plenty of tables and chairs. First thing I noticed was the large chinese food menu right by the front door, hmmmm, I can feel my hopes being slightly dashed at this point , but we've made it this far, so we went on in. 

I ordered my usual  Noodle soup with rare eye round steak & beef meatballs and Tanya got her usual Grilled shrimps and sliced pork over vermicelli and vegetables for comparison against Saigon 8's. 

For my dish, the main complaint was broth wasn't as rich as I was used to and the meatballs had a different texture than what I was used to. Everything else was similar. For Tanya, her bbq pork was not as tasty and she ate something that tasted like bad fish (twice!) in her bowl. She could not figure out where that taste came from.  Prices are slightly higher than Saigon 8, for the exact same meal, we would have paid about $2 less across the street."}
{"text":"I've been here three times.  I concur with the commenter who noted that the parking situation is difficult.  However, being close to I-15 and Spring Mountain is a huge advantage for me, and it is open 24 hours.

A relatively new member of the staff is Tony, who recently left Saigon 8.  The guy is terrific, and I've seen him iron out the bumps when language is a problem.  He's the reason I came to this restaurant in the first place.

I've had pho twice and vermicelli with grilled pork, spicy (#68) once.  The pho broth was pretty good (not quite Saigon 8, but not bad), and the meat, etc., was also good.  The #68 was the best thing I've had there, and it is served in a bowl rather than a plate, which I think helped.  The restaurant was jam packed (Friday, about 1:30 p.m.), but service went smoothly.  By the time I was finished, I would say about two thirds of the crowd had left after eating.

At the table, There was hoisin sauce and Sriracha hot sauce, plus fish sauce and soy sauce.  There was also a jar of a pepper sauce that looked like a Szechuan sauce, but didn't have the heat.  There were plain wooden chop sticks, which I like, spoons, and small saucers, which I use to mix a dip.  I've mentioned in my Jenny Pho review that this is the way I prefer it, instead of bringing stuff out with the pho, and using lacquered chop sticks.

One thing you should know is that there is a sign that says cash only.  That changed a couple of months ago.  They allow major credit cards (Visa, MC), but they left the sign up.

I like the restaurant for the quality of the food, which is pretty good, location, near I-15, and the fact that Tony now works here, and he's terrific.

Something I should have said earlier:  Pho Little Saigon makes its own Vietnamese sandwiches.  I brought some home, and they're very good.  Pho Saigon 8 doesn't  make its own, though there's a shop that makes them out the rear of their parking lot."}
{"text":"Pretty average pho experience. The broth was kinda salty but okay. The veggies were really fresh so that was a bonus. 

What left a bad taste in my experience was that the appetizer we ordered did not arrive until after our entrees were completed! It was really ridiculous it took so long.


There are better pho places in Vegas and they are cash only. 

Skip them!"}
{"text":"My son loves their pho!  He is pretty picky but they always make it with no vegtables for him."}
{"text":"They have really good Pho.  Service is okay.  In general I recomend this place.  It won't wow you, but you will be happy with what you get for the price you pay."}
{"text":"I was starving and didn't know better, like check yelp reviews first.  And so I blindly dove head first into this place.   It was freezing outside, so I ordered the chicken porridge with fried chinese donuts and a soy milk.  It tasted fine while I ate it and I was feeling fine after I finished.   About an hour later after I got back to my hotel room, all hell broke loose in my bowel system and I was in the shitter for quite some time.  It reminded me of the scene from the movie \"Van Wilder\" where the dude had to just take a dump right there and then.  We're talking montezuma revenge of some sort and possibly a colon cleansing experience.  My eyes rolled back and I just dropped huge bombs into that poor porcelain stall. Needless to say, it must've been the food that I ate from here!  I would not eat here right before you go skydiving if you get my drift?!"}
{"text":"I go there all the time. I went almost every viet restaurant around the neighborhood and this place the best. Cheap and high quality food. Try pho combo and u wont regret it. Open 24/7/365 and always clean and serve good food. They give good amount of bean sprouts too. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This place was terrible. Service and food came out pretty quickly but did not taste good. Everything tasted like they half-assed it. The pho was bland, other dishes came out messy, bland and below average! They also charged us gratuity without letting us know or showing us the receipt, we asked for it and they only gave us the total so we had to ask again for the itemized one which is how we found out gratuity was already charged. Typical shady business. Needless to say we will not be coming back."}
{"text":"I've never been in a restaurant where they except cash only but to each their own. First.... we walk in, no greeting. The guy who came to take our order, didn't acknowledge himself, just stood there. I had to ask if he was there to take our order. My husband had the shrimp fried rice, which was really flavorful. I ordered the beef/tripe pho, which was good. I think our experience would've been more enjoyable if the staff was friendly. Just no interaction from them whats so ever. A smiling face and being courteous goes a long way."}
{"text":"Pho is great after a long night of partying and I was excited to having some but it was a disappointment. Actually the egg rolls weren't too bad & their coffee was good & strong. However, the basil leaves they gave us looked old! You really had to pick through them to even find some decent looking leaves. YUCK!

Other things to know about this place... Open 24 hours but CASH ONLY."}
{"text":"Two stars because the food is actually ok. I ordered the pho with meatballs, broth was watery. 
The service here is horrible. I came with a group of 6. First orders came out within 6 minutes , 2nd set of orders came 15 minutes after. Last set took 35 minutes. I don't think I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"We decided to visit this place after attending mass looking for some soup to keep us warm. It was busy for a typical Saturday night, but we were still promptly seated at our table, and within minutes our food had arrived. The only cons to this visit was how long it took to get our refills of water and the fact that they couldn't bring the bill to our table, you would have to approach the counter and give them your table #. Other than that, it was a pleasant experience and we would come back again.

+1 star for helping me cure my cold and sore throat!

Fyi: This place is a Cash-only establishment, no credit cards allowed."}
{"text":"I found the service here is actually very good. A man greeted me immediately as I walked through the doors and helped me with a to-go order. He was very friendly and actually made suggestions on my order and I had a very delicious pork chop, #42, I believe. My wife asked for bun with pork and eggrolls, he didn't immediately understand what I was talking about but took the time to read my iphone and got it right. Everything was delicious and the order came out in timely fashion. The only downside here, like a lot of Vietnamese places, is that they only take cash."}
{"text":"Located on Spring Mountain road and Valley View Blvd, my family and I were drawn by the neon sign and advertisements across the street. If you are looking for PHO, avoid this place at all cost. My family and I ordered their special #1 Pho Dac Biet and man was it a big disappointment. The pho bowls came out lukewarm and the tendon and meat were so rubbery. I watched how disappointed my family were half way eating their bowls. 
We came on a Saturday afternoon for lunch. Also, did I mention the staff members are constantly bickering in the back? 

Ordered: Pho Dac Dirt 
Price: $8.99+ per bowl

My two cents: AVOID!"}
{"text":"Do not waste your time. There are too many 24-hour pho places out there to pick from that are better than this place. I got the shrimp spring rolls and white chicken pho. The spring rolls were filled so much with plain lettuce and the shrimp was not fresh at all. I have never had such low quality spring rolls with a price of $5.40. The menu also says that there is a \"regular\" and \"small\" size for phos and the waiter told us that they are only serving the large which was nothing like a large. What really made me thinking of never coming back was the HORRIBLE service and attitude. The Vietnamese waiter and male cashier gave me the worst attitude for no reason. None of them spoke fluent English so don't bother asking them a question about food or anything."}
{"text":"Stopped by with my fiance on a friend's recommendation. Didn't scope out Yelp until we were done with our meal. We were both really surprised by the low reviews only because we had a good experience overall.

I sort of walked in knowing I'd be comparing them to Lemon Grass Cafe. I was craving a seafood egg noodle & veggie dish, so I ordered the #150 (with the noodles cooked soft). I'll admit the price was a dollar or two higher compared to Lemon Grass, but the potion size was at least double!...not to mention the dish had an over abundance of seafood. Such a bonus!! My left overs at Lemon Grass consisted of noodles and a few carrots. The left overs I took home from here was like a whole other entree, there was so much left. 

My fiance ordered the Chicken Pho. His initial comment was how he liked their Pho just a bit more only because he didn't prefer the meat balls that Lemon Grass added to their Pho. He did like both though. Little Saigon's Pho is only available in one size, which is equivalent to a large anywhere else. Good if you're hungry, but not so good if you're used to having options.

Oh, and they offer Thai Tea with boba!! I'd never had boba added to mine before. Love it!

The space if larger than I anticipated. Very clean. It was uncomfortably quiet when we were there (Friday evening). I'm not sure if this is typical or if they are busier during lunch. The staff is pleasant. Very soft spoken and mild mannered. It seemed they did not want to interrupt their diners once served, so be sure to ask for the check when you're ready for it. 

We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"This place gets the job done for the late night owl drunks. I've been here a few times from after a night of raging and getting something soupy for the hangover cure.

Service is the typical kind you receive from any Vietnamese restaurant. Know what you want to order 5 mins. after sitting down. If you have a large party, ok, 6 mins tops. Food comes out within 10 mins. 

We ordered To-Go this last visit. Took some time to get our food, but maybe that's because we were just waiting around for it. When the orders came, the Manfriend checked each box to make sure we got all our orders. Good thing he did, we were missing an order. I think they forgot to make that order because we waited another 10-15 mins for it.

Food is decent. No complaints there. But make sure you have CASH on you. Pay at the register and be gone."}
{"text":"My family came here to order pho we came as 15 people. It's a family trip we thought that they would be nice and respect us as we order but no instantly one of the waiters came out and cussed at us gave us so much attitude so instead of staying we got up and left. Worst customer service. Not worth it."}
{"text":"I usually use yelp to accurately find good places to eat in locations I'm not familiar with our if I want something new. Thankfully I didn't read them first this time. This restaurant was delicious! The interior is rough looking but the food was downright awesome! Some of the best Vietnamese food I've eaten. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Love this place, the food is so good, we went here almost everything day to eat when we re in vegas. Idk why they have bad review. It is so much better than pho kim long"}
{"text":"I only eat Pho here with a Cafe to wash it down. Quick, clean and cures hangovers, colds and allergies. This is my goto spot on the Ho-Chin-Min Trail \"Mountain Spring Rd\""}
{"text":"Ate here a couple of times. the food its alright. i guess. a little Pricey! service is kind of wack for me. they just sit around or your cant find them to get a damn re-fill. 

Just keep on truckin' to the next spot! hahaa!"}
{"text":"I ordered pho, the meat tasted like it wasnt cooked. I told the waiter and he replied: \"you shouldn't ordered that\". Worst pho ever!!!"}
{"text":"This is a very delicious pho restaurant. We stopped in for lunch and both ordered pho. The workers are very friendly and helpful, it seemed like everyone was family which was nice. We will be coming back here again for sure!"}
{"text":"I come here for their pho.  Anything else I've had here is mediocre.  Most times, I will order inside and take it home.  I've eaten here before but it's kind of dingy inside, plus it's almost always empty.

The wait staff is friendly enough and the prices are average.  Unfortunately, the past few times I've ordered the well-done brisket the pieces of meat have been far more fat than actual meat.  Their broth is tasty and the to-go orders do come with an abundance of veggies, so that's nice at least.

If I found a closer place with better broth, I'd probably go there because I don't like driving too far when I'm sick (which is when I am most likely to pick up pho)."}
{"text":"Great broth !!! Not many pho places can nail a savoury broth, but this place can!  I've been to a couple pho restaurants in San Jose, ca and this place is comparable in flavour.   A regular size bowl is hefty enough to fill your craving ( I'm about 225 lbs). Definitely worth returning!!!


Also- zero wait time. Just walk right in, sit down, and order!"}
{"text":"Love coming here with my boyfriend we would order the pho of course and I would bring my iPad and watch a little movie in the restaurant while we enjoy our meal. The soup came out piping hot with fresh ingredients for the side. Everyone there are very friendly. Didn't mind how the place look, but my pho was on point and that's all that matters and SERVICE TOO ...... I recently brought my family to Pho little Saigon, for the first time. We were supposed to go to In and Out. But we ended coming here. They didn't expect their pho soup to be big... It's not a bad thing it's a GREAT THING! Knowing there belly is going to be full and satisfy. Everyone was very very happy that they came here."}
{"text":"A diamond in the rough. Been here a few times. We've never been disappointed. Great Pho. Great rolls. Lots of seating and quick service. Prices match the food and staff is always courteous. Don't let the 3.5 stars fool you. It's good food."}
{"text":"Broth is made well. I'm very particular about the broth having made it myself many times. I can usually tell right away when it has too much or too little of an ingredient. Although, I've only been here twice, both times were good. Would go back again for sure."}
{"text":"Get your Pho fix at Little Saigon. I've been here several times now, & never had a bad meal. Nothing fancy here, just good big steaming bowls of Pho, along with the boba drinks I love. The soup is always good & hot, with lots of meat, as well as a side dish of accompaniments such as bean sprouts, limes, holy basil & sliced fresh jalapenos. The service is quick & what the staff lacks in english communication skills, they make up for in smiles, prompt service, quality, & quantity. The boba drinks feature nice smooth starchy balls that are softer than some of the other places I've tried. The coconut is my favorite. It cools the mouth & throat after powering down a spicy bowl of this wonderful soup. #35, steak, brisket, & tendon is my go to order. I've also tried the fried rice here, & it was top notch. The only reason I didn't give Saigon 5 stars is because the cleanliness left a little to be desired, & the beef balls were a bit too chewy. But don't let appearances fool you. There's a reason that there are several locations of this Pho restaurant. They do it right."}
{"text":"We were greeted by a waiter who screamed at us when we tried to ask for a seat. Needless to say we were not the only party who got up and left before being seated. 

We were not only spoken to in a loud voice but also insulted and told that we were  stupid in Vietnamese not knowing that we all know the language. We will never come back again. Absolutely unacceptable."}
{"text":"best pho soup in town. always open 24 hours!"}
{"text":"I actually hesitated writing this review. Given this was an all time regular place of mine because it was my first time ever trying pho. Until I branched out to new restaurants,this was my regular spot. I would gamble,stop here before going home all the time. Then I went vegan. I guess more food conscious makes you notice more about what you're eating because I couldn't even tell you if this ever happened before. Two reasons,never ate anything but chicken pho,and two,I was usually either tipsy,or trust worthy & never even looked twice at my dishes. Tonight I went in to a old favorite & ordered the sautéed greens with garlic. They were wonderful,until I bit into dirt. Real true gritty dirt. Everyone knows collard greens must be washed thoroughly,a restaurant at best...I'm a country girl & knowing food,temperatures & bacteria I let the two bites of soil pass knowing my grandmas old saying \"you can't eat every bodies greens\". Then the hair came...I was done.my hair is to my hips,this hair was about 2 inches straight,mines not only curly,but completely covered in my nighttime wrap! He didn't charge me for the meal,just my drink....seeing he remembered my loyalty,I guess I'd expect better service than \"free entree\". Thx for all the wonderful chicken pho & red wine years,but we must part ways ;("}
{"text":"Still enjoy coming to this establishment. The people who work here are always friendly and the food is prompt."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick meal and it wasn't enjoyable. Pretty pricey for a small bowl of pho and the broth was really salty. On top of it all, the waiter just kept on ignoring me and my husband and the cashier; a complete d***. Never met a man with that much sassiness in him. The only good thing was that there was parking available."}
{"text":"I'm pretty much regular in this joint. I come here at least 3 times a week, and normally
    it's always around between 6am-10am. I wasn't much a fan of the service but the stir fried low mein is hands down the best I've had so far. So I keep going back to this place regardless of how mediocre the service were. I've figured I can overlooked that service part, since it's not that bad.
    Tonight at 8:25pm I decided to go in. They were slow. 3 tables were occupied. A guy who seated me was already annoyed that I was there. He was on the phone while seating me.
    I went and ordered my usual. I just told him what I wanted since I already know what I wanted.
    He kept asking me to look for the number on the menu. He then was irritated when I asked him for a Pepsi. The entire evening of service was like, I was being treated like shit. Around an hr and half of me being there, never once I was approached to ask if I'm still alive or choking with something. I still went ahead and just kept eating.
    By the time I decided I am done and I still have half of my low mein left on my plate, I was waving at anybody that would pass by my table to get my ticket and a to go box. Two men were working that night. I seem to be invisible. Then finally, one guy approached me, I asked for a to go plate, and he pointed out the direction of the door and said something \" there\" and walked away.
    Again, patiently enough, I waited for someone to come to my table again. Nobody came. So I stood up and asked one of the other guy who was taking orders, and he then again told me \" there the to go plate\". I guess, I was supposed to get my own to go box, located right next to the entrance door. By this time, I've had enough. So I said \" ok can I get a check..\". The first guy I asked for a to go box, went to the cash register and rang me up, I gave him my card and asked for his name. He said his name is \" Johnny\". I doubt if that's even his real name,
    I said \" you guys are rude, I said what kind of service is this.. I waved at you multiple times you were ignoring me\" - as I signed the receipt marking \" no tip\". He said \" one person works inside the kitchen so we're short\". So I asked him \" who's that owner what is his/her name?\".
    He goes \" You dont' need to know her name\". I said I come here almost 3 times a week in the morning and I'm a regular you should be nicer to the customers\". And He said yelling \" go in the morning!\".
    That was that and I left. That would be the last time I go to this place. Being short handed was not an excuse for being rude to the customer. He could have been apologetic and that would have been fine with me."}
{"text":"Great selection of foods and open 24/7 ! Feeling extra hungry go for the extra large bowl of sum great phoo noodles, rice or anything else you might feel will give you a fix ! It definitely was a great experience for me food wise, customer service lacked just a little bit not completely terrible !"}
{"text":"WoW new management!  Prices are jacked up real high!  Usually pho in Temecula is expensive but this is ridiculous! For 5 bowls of pho, 3 soy milk, 1 thai tea with boba and 1 orange juice! $95  usually it's only $60-$65. The pho was really bland too! Never coming back again!"}
{"text":"You can't really mess up pho.  It's nothing but meat, veggies, and broth.  Then as a customer you add as much lime, sprouts, cilantro, hoisin, and sriracha you want. 

Well Pho Little Saigon pho was neither special nor terrible but it satisfied my pho craving when I needed it, more better than bad. With maybe 2 or 3 other pho places already in the area, less then 1/2 mile a part, it does have pro's over the others. They seemed pretty clean back when ate here a few months ago but I believe they were recently on Dirty Dining. Honestly I'll probably eat there again if the party wants to eat here. Why? Because they have a good variety of items on their menu besides pho, it didn't make me sick, priced inexpensive, spacious interior with plenty of tables, and they'll probably get it corrected.  The only thing I didn't like was that they'll keep to the credit card minimum thing.

Located right off the 215 and S. Eastern near Chuck E Cheese."}
{"text":"Eh, this place is OKAY. For some cheap, late-night pho, this place is to go. Service can definitely be better, but the food is good.

Pho- I don't think you can ever go wrong with pho. I usually get the rare flank with tripe. It is good! The broth is good, too. It is not as heavy as other pho places.

Fried Eggrolls- they can use better lettuce. Its okay.

Spring rolls- I hate their spring rolls. It doesn't taste fresh and its super dry. Two thumbs DOWN!

Rice dishes- some of them are super salty like pork.. The chicken is good, but other than that, I wouldn't really get it.

This place is just good for their pho. It's not as busy as Pho Kim Long-- only a block away, so if you do not want to wait, this place is where you wanna go!"}
{"text":"pretty good place! i've been here more than 5 times. The food is really good, reasonably priced, and they are open 24 hours!! thanks for the good food on all the drunk nights iv'e had!!!! lol"}
{"text":"Today we ordered seafood soup, crispy noodle and combination fried rice. All good! Total bill only $35.10 (we did not order drinks).

Place is not fancy. Not sure how clean. But so far we haven't been sick. Hahaha

We come here to order or eat in whenever we need a Vietnamese food fix."}
{"text":"I won't  be coming here again. I ordered egg rolls and they came out in like two minutes so I assume thats the reason the ground pork in the inside was still pink.... RAW. They never came to refill our water until my boyfriend asked a second time . The first time he asked they all looked at him and continued to talk to each other or on the phone . The second time they brought more water, finally. Overall horrible service and the food wasn't all that great.."}
{"text":"Only stopped here cause it was late and the place was still open. 

Bad idea. 

Canh chua ca (fish sour soup) had fish that was only have cooked so we had to have them do it again. Same thing happened the second time. The fish was still half frozen. 

Cá kho t (stewed fish) was poorly made. The fish should be stewed to where the the sauce and seasonings should be absorbed for flavor but when it came out it was bland. 

Stir fry garlic spinach was terrible. Leaves/stalks were long and tough to chew. 3D spinach = dai, dài & d (tough, long, & bad)

Many more dishes were ordered all equally as bad. I think this place only survives by trapping innocent hungry people late in the night."}
{"text":"This place gets no star from me! I'm only putting one star b/c I had to.

First of all, the place was a mess! It looked like they used one corner for as their 'junk closet.'

Second, the owner's lil boy was in there riding his bicycle!! Are you kidding??? The lil boy was screaming, throwing tantrums, hitting the chairs, etc. w/ his bike and his parents just sat there watching tv. Mind you the restaurant had about 15 customers in there. 

Thirdly, I asked the waitress what something was in my soup and she said she didn't know. I asked her if she worked there and she said yes but never tried that soup before. I don't care if you've tried it or not - you're Vietnamese, you work there, you should know your own damn food!!

Fourth, they had a long extension cord running from inside the restaurant - out the door through the parking lot - ending God knows where. 

Lastly, never going there again."}
{"text":"Under new management. New owner just took over a few months ago. 
My first check-in here. The place is roomy and open. Clean. The staff friendly. The chicken wing appetizer was delicious and perfectly cooked and skin was a little sweet but really tasty. The veggie pho was also good, the broth really tasty. The Cornish chicken was delicious and cooked. Moist and tender. My favorite soup, Bong Bo Hue, was really tasty, broth perfectly spiced even with my taste buds not at 100%. The pork hock was very tender, the blood cake was soft. I added more chili to mine since it'll help with my colds.  The prices are very reasonable. I like this place and will come back to try other goodies.... I will recommend it.
Yelp Elite get a 15% discount on Pho and Chicken wings every Wednesday from 5:00 pm to 8:00 pm. Just be ready to show your Elite Badge."}
{"text":"The worst customer service and food in Vegas. I wouldn't eat here if someone pay me. They'll ignore you for 20 mins, then get mad when you tried to get their attention to order."}
{"text":"Taste alright. I ordered bun rieu. The broth does taste good but no pig feet. I love pig feet with bun rieu. The one reason I came there was its open 24/7."}
{"text":"This is the only place we go to when were in Las Vegas. We haven't been able to find a place with food as good and as affordable for in Los Angeles. My bf isnt sure he caught the correct name but ken/Kim gave awesome service and even recommend the same food for a better deal!"}
{"text":"I was a bit hesitant to come here but boy was I wrong. I wasn't disappointed. They have a rather large menu for a small restaurant. Their pho is pretty good, but what I loved the most was their egg rolls. They were delicious! I came with a lot of friends so we ordered a lot of food. The food came out super fast and was delicious! We had the bbq chicken (yummy), chow mein with chicken (amazing) and fried tofu (pretty good). All of this besides the pho plates, and all were really good. Yes we took a lot of food home but even the next day tasted just as good. I can say I will be back to try more of their food! (Only thing I would have preferred would be for the pho to be a bit hotter in temperature, but besides that the taste was delicious)."}
{"text":"Why would anyone want to dine here when the southern Nevada health district shut them down 7 times since 2009 due to health code violations. They were shut down Friday again for over 60 demerits which included serving spoiled food and employees not washing hands. They obviously are the stereotypical Asian business owner who doesn't care about the safety of their diners and only care about $$$$$."}
{"text":"Since coming to Vegas for vacation, I have tried a variety of different food of different backgrounds. So it's not surprising for me to crave the cuisine I grew up with.

We came in around 1:00am and they are open 24 hours. I ordered the pho tai here and I have to say their bowls are pretty big, for sure it's enough to fill you up. As for the pho itself, It was adequate, the broth had a significantly greater amount of MSG compared to other pho places. But the service here was good, we were able to have a good conversation with our server and the other servers greeted us welcomely, joking around with us as well. The sinh to taro here was okay too, although you can tell it was made by using powder (which our server told us about in advance) 

Overall: Good service, adequate pho"}
{"text":"First time ate there 9/4 had the worst experience ever. I ordered their pho special with water (straight up sink water without filtered nor lime) we ate got back to my hotel (stayed at TI)"}
{"text":"Service is always good and the food is at a fair price. I live in CA and come here whenever I'm in LV and need a good, reliable meal on a budget.  Visa and MC cards accepted."}
{"text":"The worst customer service ever. After seating ourselves and waiting 15 mins and waving at them 4 times to be noticed. They still kept us waiting. I usually wouldn't mind the wait but not when I am starving. Never again. So we decided to go to krung Siam instead (next door). Better environment and the girls are very pleasant. Would not recommend pho little Saigon. Shitty service."}
{"text":"We went late at night and it tasted so good. I orders just pho and my other half ordered spicy beef with blood cubes. The owners were a little intimidating but overall really cool and funny. This is the FIRST time I never had to actually add anything to the broth!! I loved it!"}
{"text":"First time eating Pho ever and this is where I had it. Service was great. Waiter extremely funny. Noodles were excellent. Would love to get back to this place the next time out in Vegas."}
{"text":"Wow, this place has some low reviews.  Even people who like this place give it low reviews!  I am going to go against the flow here and give it a 4 star review.  

Now, I'm no Pho expert, but I enjoy the Pho here every time I get it (3 times now).  I usually order number 21, which is the combination house Pho (I believe).  I usually go with my friend that speaks Vietnamese, and he orders all of the goodies to go in our Pho (leaves, sprouts, fatty oil (good for the arteries), vinegar onions, hot sauce and the sweet sauce.  The combination makes a very yummy broth.  And if there is one thing I've learned about my own tastes with soup, it is all about the broth.  I've only had Pho at one other place, and the broth here is a lot more flavorful.  

As for the freshness of the food, I wouldn't say that it was the freshest, but it definitely wasn't spoiled.  The meat was tender enough for me to eat with my sore teeth (just got braces), which I was happy about.  

The Vietnamese coffee is awesome.  

The cash only system is very annoying.  The service is also shotty sometimes.  We had to ask twice for our fatty oil, and he brought regular onions instead of vinegar onions. Still, I always enjoy the Pho here."}
{"text":"I used to get pretty consistent tasting pho' here but the last few times have been hit or miss so I am lowering my previous rating"}
{"text":"Very home type of feeling, welcoming and comforting. Open minded to different options, and fresh spring rolls are delicious. The service is on point and the drinks great!"}
{"text":"Their service is horrible, no water refills, no straws, and one napkin per person.  Yet they give themselves 15% tip.  The tipping here is not optional and is included in the bill.  The menu says there are 2 sizes for pho, small and regular, but you can only order regular size.  The pho broth was lacking flavor and the meat was not good at all. It was very tough to chew and I found random strands that were clear in color from the meat.  The meat was also very fat, but in a disturbing way."}
{"text":"The taste is great and the service is good. I would like to come again. The pho portion is quite big for the regular one."}
{"text":"This is definitely not the fanciest place around but there food us consistently good and they have 4.99 lunch specials that are the best value around.  The service is very welcoming and friendly, great people, and their Phó is really good."}
{"text":"I have read the negative reviews and can say that I have never had any of the issues outlined.  My food has always been excellent, service is great (even if I haven't been in for months, they remember me and my family), and it has always been clean.  Don't let the negative reviews discourage you.  And it's open 24 hours for your late night drunken pho fix!"}
{"text":"This place is horrible. Sitting in this damn restaurant as we speak. If I can give this restaurant 0 stars, I would. We've been here for an hour already and still did not get our food
 Apparently the waiter \"dropped\" our order and the waiter just took our order AGAIN. DID NOT EVEN APOLOGIZED. Blamed it on the person who took our order when he was the one who took our order initially. This place is horrible. I am fair when it comes to waiting for our food and being patient but this is beyond horrible. Drive a few minutes down Chinatown and find yourself a better pho place to dine at. Call this a rant or whatever you want but this is the worst of the worst."}
{"text":"Wasn't going to write a review but after reading a review from 3 days ago about the same ginormous turd in the women's bathroom I knew something had to be said. 

First off, I don't really have high expectations when going to eat at a Vietnamese restaurant. I usually eat at Pho Kim Long but around the 2pm hour I did not have time to wait as I was on my hour lunch. Knowing that this place was nearby and I was starving I headed here. 

The broth was SUPER watered down. The bathroom was DISGUSTING. It seems as if there is a plumbing problem of some sort because on the women's bathroom door it says to be cautious of water on the floor. Reading that, I walked in and looked at the floor and it wasn't wet, nor recently cleaned. Walking further into the restroom there was a clogged toilet with shit piled to the top (which after reading reviews, has been there nearly 3 days... Who knows how long before that). The next stall was flooded with water which was probably the reason for the sign on the door. 

After ordering our food, we asked for extra limes and straws.  As we were about 1/4 way into our meal, we had to ask someone else because nobody came. We see that they are not busy but the workers are running around like a chicken with its head cut off as if they were busy. Where are my straws??? Limes?? Never got those but a straw soon came after asking a 3rd time. 

This place is not sanitary, not sure how they are still in business. Definitely won't be coming back on any circumstance. I'd rather wait at Pho Kim and be late to work."}
{"text":"My husband's was in serious need of a good bowl of Pho to cure his Vegas hangover. The place he usually goes to in Vegas wasn't open yet, so we trekked out here around 9am. 
The place was bright, clean, & staff was friendly. Service was a bit slower than what were used to in Cali, but nothing to complain about. 
We ordered Pho Tai & Soda Chanh. 
The Pho broth was yummy- not to msg/beefy tasting & the meat wasn't overcooked! Everything was fresh and Lime soda was refreshing & light."}
{"text":"This location is initially savory with the pho order, 2 bowls of pho dac biet, special pho but the next order, com thit bo nuong, rice dish with sauteed beef smells it was dipped in poop and tasted undercooked; did not look appealing at all.  This was the first visit sharing with a friend.

Our second visit was the worst, and we never want to come back again.  They had bad customer service, and no greeting.  This time the customers were not packed; looked rather empty.  Less than four tables were filled.  

Our order was hu tieu hai sang, seafood noodle soup and dry noodle shredded and sweet pork, bun bi nem nuong.  The sweet pork tasted like rotten, and the shredded pork smells like carrion and old.

I poured on the fish sauce and ate it anyway because my friend insisted.  Fortunately I did not feel sick because or maybe I did.  We had Starbucks ice-coffee at the McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas later that day and both of us had a headache just minutes from drinking a few sips.

My friend had the seafood noodle soup at Pho Little Saigon, and she did not finished it only a fifth into it and said it was not good.  Tasted flavorless.

I do not recommend any Pho Little Saigon in the Las Vegas area.  Go waste your money somewhere else---not here! 3775 W Spring Mountain Rd"}
{"text":"The prices are crazy expensive. 9 dollars for a bowl of pho is not the business. Usually they run about 6 dollars. My pho was disgusting and cold. Their meat tasted fake and seemed old. My boyfriend ordered a large pho dac biet with meatballs and he only got half of one meatball. We paid for extra meatballs and he didn't even got one full meatball. That's cheap and pissed me off. Will never eat here again. Even the waiter was so rude. Not worth the money or time trying it.

DO NOT GO HERE!!!"}
{"text":"Poor customer service, prejudice against people not their own.  Waited 20 mins to even get water meanwhile other people who got there after got their order in and out. Shit place. Do not eat here."}
{"text":"All y'all haters can S a D. This place was BOMB, especially after a hangover.

The broth was great the first night I went with a raging hangover (duh, it's Vegas). And the following day, I tried their pork sandwich, which was also great. The bread was more smushy than I'm used to, but considering that I live in San Jose where Vietnamese sandwiches run rampant, I appreciated the soft baguette.

I like this place and will be coming back."}
{"text":"This place was jam packed with people. It took a while for us to be seated. The waiter was a bit rude towards our family giving that we did have 17 people in the group. They tried to clean the tables for us as quickly as possible and when we finally were seated we were not given menus until ten minutes into just sitting there trying to figure out what to eat. 

We all ordered and it did not take long for the food to come out which was surprising. Our family ordered a lot of food and I got to try a little bit of everything. I got the pho dac biet and it was not the best pho I have tried. It was missing flavor to it and on top of that the silverware was not clean, so we cleaned it our selves. Most of the food did not taste like it was freshly made. The spring rolls tasted as if they pre made it and it was sitting in the fridge for a bit. The pho base was not good in my opinion because it really lacked flavor. Some other main dishes like some beef rice dishes tasted pretty good. 

Overall this place gets a 2 and a half because the cleanliness of the place was not there forte, the customer service was a bit rude and did not check on us. For a pho place you would expect the pho to be good, but it's not. I recommend coming here for some other dishes and NOT the pho."}
{"text":"Decent service & ok food. The place is dirty though, with little pieces of stuff on the water cups.

Side note ~ the meat in the bun bo hue tastes like it's been frozen forever. Very gross."}
{"text":"Worst pho place in the universe rude unfriendly staff and the food tastes suspect. They also made the dirty dining hall of shame on the local news. As usual offering lame excuses for the shut down and not any real reasons. I would rather go hungry than to eat at this atrocious place they have the nerve to call a restaurant."}
{"text":"I love this place. It really isn't fancy but I always get good food and service. One of the girls that works there always remembers what I like. I really appreciate that about this place. It's one of my top picks in Vegas so far."}
{"text":"Bad place! Found a piece of plastic in my noodle soup and told the waiter, who repeatedly claimed that it was a piece of shrimp shell!"}
{"text":"Foods was great, friendly waiter. Would love to come back sometimes near future if we travel here again."}
{"text":"At best, the food was average. The staff are really rude, saying there's only 1 size for the pho bowls when on the menu there's a small and large. Not recommended for big parties also."}
{"text":"Poor customer service!!! Hair in food. Rather wait down the road at Pho Kim Long over an hour or eat 25 cent Ramen noodle then eat here!"}
{"text":"Good Pho, open all the time."}
{"text":"First of all, 24-hour pho. 

Oh, you need more reasons to give it five stars? Heathen. 

24-hour REALLY REALLY GOOD pho. Happy? I could take or leave their banh mis, 'cuz they use too much mayonnaise, but their pho... HELLZ to the YES. My wife loves their bun. Bunh? Boon? I don't know how to spell it. All I know is that she has to keep her chopsticks in one hand, and a fork held defensively between me and it so I don't steal her food. 

GOOD STUFF. Go there."}
{"text":"Worse Pho place ever!  They got the order wrong, charged us for it, beef was bad, they also tried to charge for something that never came out, and poor customer service!  The lady argued with me that it was my mistake when I was giving her feedbak.  We didn't eat the food, just paid for it and definitely not going back.  I don't know how places like that stay in business"}
{"text":"This review will be from when I went in late December of 2010. I came here with my family and friends. They seemed really busy when we came in, and we were seated all the way in the back corner. The seating arrangements are weird. We had to squeeze into our seats, and the other side of the table had people sitting behind them. 

Anyway, pho is just OKAY. It's pricey for what it taste like. 

I remember it cost 50 cents for tea/person. Wow..I thought that was crazy. I'll just stick with an iced cold water. 

The experience wasn't spectacular. I'll just keep looking for my perfect pho spot at Vegas until I'm satisfied :)"}
{"text":"Pho is on point. Always come and never to crowded and never have to wait more then 5 mins to get your soup."}
{"text":"I don't really like PHO, I prefer ramen. That being said I only order 2 things here and I've never really tried anything else except lemongrass chicken (extra spicy) and various spring rolls either wrapped in rice paper and rarely the fried ones. Anyways Lemongrass chicken is the best I've found in Vegas, chicken is tender lots of hot chili's lots of lemongrass. I have ate this here at least 20 times.. I can't really speak for much else of the menu but I will keep coming back just for lemongrass chicken and I don't care to try much else."}
{"text":"it's really a hit and miss here.  okay pho, some day the place would be great and some place the pho would be pretty bad.

pluses are close to the strip and open 24-7."}
{"text":"Get the #72! It's the only thing I've eaten there. I like it so much, I don't branch out. It is consistently delish."}
{"text":"We were starving as we entered Las Vegas and took an exit hoping for a clean place to eat. This place served very good pho and cheap. The service was good and the taste was authentic. Good stuff!"}
{"text":"This place is the worst place to eat. First of all the customer service is horrible. The workers get offended when you complain about the food and send it back. The waiter comes back and makes a big scene. Had customers at the other tables staring. When we paid and told them the service was horrible, they argued back, told us to pay and leave. The food has no flavor and drinks are too sweet.   I have never been to a restaurant and been treated this way. This place should not even be open. I will never go to this place and strongly advice no one to go. They don't even deserve 1 star!"}
{"text":"Horrendous customer service never even had my order taken ended up leaving and upset. Such a waste of my time I don't care how good the food may or might have been, disgraceful customer service is unacceptable."}
{"text":"The first thing I noticed was how empty the restaurant was during 12p lunch hour.  But I love pho and ordered the white chicken meat large bowl.  As soon as the bowl was in front of me I took a whiff of the broth which I usually love but right away it didn't quite smell right.  I took my first bite and the chicken was dry and hard to chew.  The noodles just weren't right.  Maybe over done?  Overall this is the poorest tasting pho bowl I've had.  I took 3/4 of it home to feed the chicken to my dogs but didn't have the heart to give it to them and threw it away.  I'll just keep going to Pho Saigon 8 where they seem to always be consistently great."}
{"text":"This is possibly the worst restaurant in LV. And our family has been here since 1940! Stay away!
The food was cold ... not a hint of heat. They offered to put it in the the microwave!
We paid and left 
Ray"}
{"text":"Maybe I rely on yelp too much.  Passed this place many times because not \"five star\" review.  Got my car detailed and needed some time to kill.  Ordered noodles with pork, shrimp and egg roll.. Delish!! I am Vietnamese and I know good Vietnamese food.  My two year old even ate it.  Vietnamese American approved!"}
{"text":"I happened to come here because my favorite down the street had a line out the door as usual. I got my pho fix and it hit the spot for me. The place looks new and super clean - my hot pho came out super fast with super fresh greens. I don't care for service much because most Asian places suck at it anyway - but it was great here. Very happy, I would come back."}
{"text":"Second time here and we plan to keep coming back. We've had the meatball pho, potstickers, spring rolls, and broccoli beef. Pho is excellent, we were both very happy with it. I liked the broccoli beef more than at other Chinese restaurants as the sauce wasn't as heavy and salty. The $5 lunch special is a great deal. 

My only complaint is the parking lot. It's awful, though this is certainly not the restaurant's fault, it makes coming here a less than perfect experience."}
{"text":"It takes a lot of guts to have a pho shop open 24 hrs, I'll give them that.

Overall the food and service is okay..
I ordered a rice plate #37 and....I tasted better. 

The place and bathroom is clean.
3/5"}
{"text":"Ok this review is long over due...god damn msg loving mother suckers..geez this establishment is lucky to have customers cause they are so close to the strip and they are open 24 hrs. I just want some Pho after a night out to sober me up but knew the consequences..I try hard not to come here but friends are hungry and want Pho as well..all I could say is you will wake up to a headache and desert throat like well after 8 hrs of sleep and several hours more after waking...I swear every Pho place in Vegas just loves to add soo much MSG sheesh!!!  Whoever opens a Pho place in Vegas that doesn't have msg will make a killing, and yes that can be done. O and service bites."}
{"text":"I AM APPALLED!!! 

I was 100% robbed! 

First off, NOTHING on the wall is available in the morning. No smoothies. No rice dishes. No egg noodles. NOTHING. The only thing that is available is pho... this didn't really bother me much because the place is name pho anyways... so I wasn't going to order something else. It's just the false advertising that got me heated...

THIS is really the part that pushed me over the cliff... We were charged for egg noodles and various other dishes that WEREN'T EVEN AVAILABLE IN THE FIRST PLACE! FUCKING UNREAL! At least try to make it believable! The menu also clearly said there are TWO sizes... one at 7.99 and the other at 8.99 AND YET we were charged $10 per bowl PLUS an extra $1.50 for fish balls which wasn't even stated!!! WHAT THE FUCKERY!! 

We obviously brought it up to their attention. At which point the guy at the register said that everything is the same price so he can charge us with anything as long as it equals the same amount of dishes ordered... We ended up arguing with them for like 15 mins.... nothing got resolved. So I just paid the fee and left because I'm on vacation and I'm not going to be bothered over this fuckery... 

Best believe I will NEVER be back again!"}
{"text":"Hi mr. waiter that smiles and goes \"anything you want i'll get it for you, just ask!\"

Up-beat waiters that ask you where you're from, where you're staying, and wish you well on your drive back to wherever the hell you came from.

I'll admit the soup base was a bit bland but heyyyy the noodles and meat made up for it. Not to mention they aren't stingy when you ask for more lime! Gimme gimme gimme!

Pretty darn cheap for a place right off the strip. Best of all? Open 24hours, helloooooooo after clubbing munchies!"}
{"text":"Let me just lay down what I thought was ridiculous. So my 4 friends and I all ordered pho and they all cost $7.99 each. After we were done eating, two of us paid (including me) and he told us the check came out to over $50 (what???). We told the cashier to split the check. I had to pay $9.54 and he had to pay over $10. Uhm what? 

After a half an hour the other 3 went to go up and pay. One paid 9.18 and the others paid a little over $8. How is it that we pay all these different amounts when we all got the same priced meals?

HOW DOES THAT EVEN WORK OUT? I swear this placed ripped us off. The pho wasn't appetizing"}
{"text":"DO NOT GO HERE. Terrible service,  tip is automatically added for a party of 4, and they don't give you the receipt.  They forget to give you some of what you order and try to charge you for dishes you didn't receive.  Service sucks.  Go somewhere else.  Their dishes have no flavor either."}
{"text":"I'm really surprised about the bad reviews service-wise for this place! The people working there on New Years Eve were really nice and chatting with everyone. My family was stranded because the Strip was closed and we were unable to get to our hotel, so they told us to stay there as long as we needed until we were allowed back. They also had a lot of TV's around the restaurant and everyone was allowed to go outside to watch the fireworks from the Strip!

The service was a little bit slower than what I'm used to at a Vietnamese restaurant, but it wasn't overly long. The pho was pretty good, standard for a normal pho place. I got a jackfruit shake, and you could taste some jackfruit pieces. Yum!

Also a note: They only offer pho and rice dishes after about 10pm or so. Don't expect spring rolls during the late night hours! Cash only as well with a small-ish parking lot."}
{"text":"Not the best pho I've had. Kind of pricey, but it was expected since it was near the strip. The spring rolls that we ordered were rotten and when my dad took a bit he started gagging. Needless to say I sent it back and it was taken off the bill. 

Also, none of the workers seem to speak English there, and were not very friendly when they did not understand what you we're trying to order.

Only reason why I gave this place a one star is because it's open 24 hours. I mean how many pho joints do you know that offer that? If you come here completely inebriated, you'll probably have a great time and don't notice the very standard pho you are being served.

Don't think I'll be coming back here next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"It's 5am...I've spent the night playing cards on the strip, I'm a little tipsy, and really hungry...where should I go.

I've done the Steak and Egg cafe specials too many times...How about something on the way home. So my friend and I head down spring mtn looking for some food.

We pass a few places that are getting ready to close and a few others that are open, but empty, then we come across Pho Little Saigon.

We walk in and are greeted fairly quickly, I check out the menu, I've had Pho before, but I'm not 100% sure what all the stuff on the menu was, I settle on #38 I think, Fatty Brisket and Noodles.

The food was out in no time, the broth was solid, the meat was good, and the noodles hit the spot. 

My only major complaints was all the extra crap in the bowl, I'm not a fan of red or greeen onions. And there was only 1 waiter so my water glass never got refilled.

I will say it was good and cheap, and a nice alternative to the casino cafe or denny's at 5am. I will be going back and exploring their expansive menu."}
{"text":"We were seated quickly and relatively attended to, but they forgot about my order and then gave me the wrong kind of noodles once they gave it to me. Price was okay, and quality was just okay as well."}
{"text":"Pho Little Saigon on Eastern in Henderson serves both Vietnamese Pho and Chinese fare. Like most Vietnamese restaurant the decor is simple -- rows of tables and chairs -- as the feature is the Pho and Phabric :). I prefer Pho 88 , Little Saigon and Pho Kim Long in China Town Spring Mountain to Pho Little Saigon but for a quick bowl of soup this will do."}
{"text":"This place is one of the more spacious Pho places I have been to. I was very surprised when I looked at the menu and saw the prices - about $1-$2 more than most Pho restaurants in the area. And it's one size fits all, not your choice of a smaller bowl or larger bowl.

Overall, pho was good, not great, and for the price, I would try other places first."}
{"text":"I am a self admitted Pho noob (I pronounced it 'faux' for a while) and general soup lover (liquid food yummm) so take that into consideration before reading this.  

That being said....

I am a fan of Pho Little Saigon.  Sure the atmosphere leaves lots to be desired (the last time I was there the TV's were off and the manager was at a table watching an Asian comedy TV show on BLAST on his laptop) and the service is average (you pay at the register but they decline to tell you that), but if you are looking for a quick, hot bowl of Pho with all the fix-ins, Little Saigon delivers.

Typically I order the #32 (rare steak and beef ball) and #34 (rare steak, flank and tripe) and both are solid.  Tripe is generally scary to eat but it blended well in the huge bowl of noodles, broth, rare beef, mint, sprouts, onions and whatever else they find to put in those bowls.  My biggest complaint is that the flank steak is very fatty and it typically takes some time to get rid of the fat before you get to dig in to the soup.  I am not sure if the flank is always served that fatty (again, refer to my noob status), but it is a small price to pay for a nice inexpensive meal.

Soups run around $7.50 and there are lunch specials for $5.99 but you need to ask for that menu when you sit down."}
{"text":"You really can't beat 24 hour pho... if you're drunk and don't mind a drive off the strip, definitely go here. All food is good when you're drunk.

For us, we weren't drunk and we were searching for a pho place to eat at during the day. Our taste buds were extremely alert and ready for stimulation. I was left a bit unsatisfied, mainly because of the service.

Pho LIttle Saigon is a large pho restaurant nestled in Vietnamese town. We all had pho in our group and only one person wasn't happy with how the pho was. The pho, in my opinion, had enough flavor for it to be a little above average. What I wasn't happy about was the service. They just weren't very accommodating, nor friendly. No greeting, no smile, no warm fuzzy feeling inside. To add insult to injury, the server spilled water all over my friend and ALMOST his iphone. Forget my friend... save the iPhone! I understand servers don't run around intentionally spilling water on customers (I THINK), but he didn't even apologize.

Whatever.

The pho was okay and it was priced a little higher than what I'm used to paying out in the Bay Area, but hey, we're on vacation. We're meant to get ripped off."}
{"text":"They served us com tam cha thit nuong but the egg was spoiled and smelled horrible. Told them to replace it, they didn't even say sorry or anything. Good thing my son didn't eat it yet. He was 6 yr old and loves fried egg, can't imagine the damage it could cause if he ate that meal."}
{"text":"I just been here once customer service like shit never seen before , waiter throw food on the table. Food taste not good at all. Will never ever come back. Guys dont go here...."}
{"text":"Don't think I'll go back there again.... why? Cos they completely screwed up, big time, one of my fav Vietnamese dishes Bun bo hue. Soup didn't taste right was automatically a failure for the whole dish. It's a soup noodle bowl!

However, the tomato soup noodle was good! Egg rolls were ok, nothing to write home about. Food, just like the 3 stars I give, reflects the so-so quality of the meal.

The service was very friendly though! Our server joked and flirted with one of us and he just wouldn't stop, quite funny! They were quite prompt at bringing out food but it took them a while to come take our order.

The restaurant was big and it could fit a lot of tables, well at least they seemed to have enough servers to keep the orders moving. 

There are so many nice and cheap restaurants in this part of Vegas. I'd say don't waste your time and $$$ here, especially if you didn't win in the casinos.... Good luck with winning!"}
{"text":"My fiance was a little hungover from a fun night out in Vegas so we decided to get the best hangover food ever . . . pho! We didn't want to get it on the strip because we were sure it would be good and that it would be expensive.

We found this place because of all their advertising. Yes that stuff works. When I went inside, I was surprised to see how Americanized it was. That was a bad sign off the bat, plus it was a 24 hour place. =(

I order the house special egg noodles and glass noodles soup and he order a pho tai, the one with just the strips of steak. When I got my bowl, I tasted it and it tasted really bad. I wasn't sure what it was but I couldn't eat very much of it. The glass noodles also really sucked. They were very soft and broke very easily. They were basically mush. I only ate a few bites. My fiance tried his pho and was disappointed as well. I tried the broth and boy was it full of msg. The aftertaste was really bad. It tasted so salty. No wonder he couldn't finish it. I was just so disappointed especially because he was not feeling well and this wasn't helping. We left with very sad looks on our faces. Never again."}
{"text":"Food pretty decent pho place coming from a girl who's used to pho in Little Saigon in OC."}
{"text":"We ordered pho, a vermicelli bowl with pork and eggrolls, and a some extra broth on the side ( hungover BF ) lol 

The pho was surprisingly very tasty! We had just come from Lee's sandwiches and wanted some pho before hitting the road home. 
The vermicelli bowl I had was so filled with goodies! A lot of meat, noodles and veggies. 
I also had some broth on the side because I didn't want to keep reaching over to my boyfriends bowl. Lol 

The prices are a couple bucks higher than in used to here in California. 
They have an extensive  menu with lots to choose from. Even BBQ , hot pot and etc. 

I wouldn't kick this place to curb just yet."}
{"text":"I love this place. We went here one of our recent Vegas runs and late nighters, and as always, it was good. 

I got the usual #11 which is with the rare steak. The broth is alway tasty and melts in your mouth. As far as speed of service, well, they try their best, sometimes you have to throw something at them and they eventually come over."}
{"text":"3/29 10pm
Food is alright, service sucks! The guy who serves me(fatboy wearing a red shirt) gives me attitude the whole time i was there. First of all he forgot the straw when he handed me glass of water, then when i asked him for 1, he gave it to me to the other end of the table. I had to literally stand up and grab it. Im a good tipper when it comes to great service, but at this restaurant, i just let them keep the change($.25)."}

They took my iPhone 6plus... But they don't want to admit it. Even though my 
iCloud/GPS telling me that my Iphone is still there... All they say is we are busy..funny coz I have my find my iPhone lock. They can't use it anyway. No one admitting that who kept my iPhone. I will report this to the authorities. I WILL NEVER COMING BACK THIS PLACE... BE AWARE GUYS!.. 
Update; it's been 6hrs now, 
and my GPS STILL SAYING pho Little saigon ADDRESS... Shame... Shame.. Shame..shame"}
{"text":"The pho is ok, not the best i've had but it wasn't terrible. The rice porridge is pretty good and you get a huge portion, perfect for after a long night of partying on the las vegas strip. I also really like the combination fried flat noodles, Yum! i couldn't finish it so i took the rest to go since they give such hugh portions."}
{"text":"I've always had to come here when we come to Vegas because the Asian adults want Viet food. The previous times I've came the food was mediocre the pho was bland and the vermicelli with grilled meat was dry. So every time I come it's just disappointment, but I really have no say. The restaurant is poorly laid out and the tables are way too close. It's very disorganized coming in and no one really knows where to go. I tried to stay safe and get fried rice today. It was decent kind of oily. A couple minutes after digesting I had to go to the bathroom...What's up with this place. The food isn't cheap the service is slow, unorganized, and hectic."}
{"text":"This place is ok. I'd rather go to pho Saigon 8 across the street. Clean n big place with descent pho. Service was good, but that probably because this place is pretty empty."}
{"text":"This is the first Pho place you'll see if you're driving off the 15 and into \"Chinatown.\" I had just spent an hour driving around to restaurants that for some reason were either CLOSED or reserved for private parties. We were starving and decided the FIRST place we saw on Spring Mountain for noodles we saw, was where we'd eat.

The service was friendly but the restaurant falsely advertises CORONA in the window. Don't expect to get a beer here. They don't have their liquor license. Apparently they forgot to renew it. (?!)

The bowls of pho were large but for $6.99 you'd sure hope so. The rare beef was okay. Quality wise, I've had better. The eye of round in the bowl was disappointingly fatty.

We also had a bowl of cold noodles, lettuce and shrimp paste/ soybean wrapper fritters with slices of pork. The dish was pretty bland and the pork was overcooked.

We also ordered another dish that was more like a chinese stirfry of beef and veggies over little patties of fried noodles. It was okay but not good enough that we'd want to take the leftovers home.

In the end, it was a fair visit since the waitstaff was attentive and friendly. The place is brightly lit and relatively clean. I'd imagine this would be a good place for big groups of hungry, last minute eaters."}
{"text":"Not ever coming here again. They insisted soup because it's faster, any thing else is \"too long\" any rice dish, any appetizer is \"too long\" I know it's busy but we should be able to get what we want and not be scrutinized about it taking too long. The servers are arguing, yelling. Some people might like the service but I sure don't."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the open seats. The pho was fantastic and authentic here. The thai tea was brewed strongly which reflects their quality.
The portions are generous, and the server did let us know when she thought we were ordering too much.

I will definitely come back!!!"}
{"text":"Yeah, just as the rating goes, I HAVE had better.

this was our second day of Vegas and we needed a meal that would digest quickly before we hit the buffets.

It was actually pretty pricey for what they served. 

of course mom always makes the better pho but go across the street and you can get much better pho.

However, it reminded me of ghetto little saigon like it REALLY is. haha


go across the street. for sure."}
{"text":"Terrible pho Basically no meat in the soup. I ordered the egg rolls and the lettuce they brought out with it was so wilted it felt like rubber.  No mint and bad basil.  Huge menu which is always a disaster, you can't do everything. If you have pho in the name it has to be good. Will never go back to this place. Avoid avoid avoid"}
{"text":"worst pho ever. the cuts of meat are way too thick to enjoy. the soup might as well be water. the two cool things about this place are: they offer an extra large and they are open 24/7 but who would want that for a place like this?! it's also cash only which can be inconvenient."}
{"text":"App says they're open til 10. Sign on the door says 9:30. I get there at 8:55 and they say they stop taking orders at 9. We stood there awkwardly because we were kinda caught off guard by that and then they said they could serve us, but made us feel super uncomfortable. It's just annoying. Bad business ethics."}
{"text":"The food is good, however, if you order to go, check your order. I've made this mistake twice and twice I've been missing something. Then if you call them, they pretend to not speak English on the phone. Funny thing, they speak PERFECT English while you're in the restaurant. Also, they take the phone off the hook so you can't call them back."}
{"text":"The Shrimp Phô is FANTASTIC as is the pork sandwich. Another plus is that if you work late, they're open 24 hours a day. The only thing is that if it's too late they may run out of the pork sandwich. Since they're fresh they only have enough for that day. 

One IMPORTANT thing is if you order to go, check your order. I've made this mistake twice and twice I've been missing something. Then if you call them, they pretend not to speak English on the phone. Funny thing, they speak PERFECT English while you're in the restaurant. Also, they take the phone off the hook so you can't call them back.

But when they get it right, it's 5 stars."}
{"text":"This was not a good experience. You know when you walk in a place and get a bad vibe. That was ours. We should have just left but we were starving and really wanted a good bowl of pho. It was cold outside and very windy. First of all everything looked dirty. The person who we think was the owner was there and he was sitting in a booth. He was sick and coughing and sneezing all over everything.  No kleenex. .... on the table and into the air. The pho came out and it had a weird fowl flavor. It was not clear like every other pho I have had. It was cloudy...eeewwww. The eye of round did not taste fresh. The bean sprouts and basil were limp and browning. Then the owner decided to open the doors. I told you it was windy outside. Everything  blew off our table. The cold air was Bone chilling and made the soup get cold very fast. My hair was blowing all over the place. We could not get out if here fast enough. I am happy to say that we didn't get food poisoning but that's about all good I can say for this place. If you want good Vietnamese food, go to Viet Noodle Bar on Spring Mountain. It is in Chinatown but it is worth the drive."}
{"text":"Pho Little Saigon has a wide selections of food and they even post the picture up so you can see them! I ordered a Pho Dac Biet and it costed about 10$ which is expensive for a bowl of pho, which usually ranges from 5-6 dollars, and to me 7-8 dollars already seems expensive. For four egg rolls here it cost $5.99, and they were delicious but not worth the price. I'd say I've had better egg rolls at other areas nearby the Sacramento area. My pho was alright, it wasn't hecka good but it wasn't nasty. Their customer service is pretty good, the man that owns the shop I believe was nice and likes to make jokes. :)"}
{"text":"This place has amazing food and great prices. My husband and I go there all the time. We get a ton of food for $20 or less. The staff that works there are so much better than the ones that were there 6 months to a year ago. I think they have the best Pho in the valley and nobody can beat their broth. Oh so yummy!

I love to get the following:
Fried Egg Roll
#42 bbq pork and rice with egg roll 
Chicken noodle soup (pho)"}
{"text":"Pho was good, the sandwiches are the best I've ever had. I liked their sandwiches better than lee's sandwiches. The pho was average nothing outstanding.  The service was great. The server was attentive, quick to refill our drinks, and he even cooked an item that wasn't on the menu for my husband. Overall great experience the taro boba was also amazing."}
{"text":"We came here after discovering Pho Kim Long had a 1.5 hr wait. We really didn't care where we ate, as long as we got some pho before heading home back to LA. 

This restaurant is really the epitome of: sit, order, eat, pay, leave. I had to hold my menu up and repeatedly ask for service before someone came to take our order. And even then they were in some sort of rush that they got two of our orders wrong. After that I didn't even bother to ask for anything else. 

The bill is paid at the front 'cause apparently nobody there got time to help you out. 

The food is your typical pho place food. Nothing spectacular and nothing horrible either."}
{"text":"Holy crap the line at Palazzo to get a taxi is LONG. Damn.

Let's walk over to Treasure Island and get a cab from there.
Oh wait, taxi cab waiting at light to make a turn onto the strip...
Heyyyy, can we get in?
Sure.
Crap, only 4 of us can fit. 
What the hell just happened?

Where to?
Pho Little Saigon, on Spring Mtn Rd.
Banessa in the front seat. 
WTF? This guy sounds like he's high/stoned. 
Oh we weren't supposed to get into a cab that's waiting at a light.
Where's the rest of our party?

We arrived at PLS and ordered and waited for the rest to show up.
$7 for Pho...I'm not hungry, it's 3AM! 
Everyone else shows up.
Omg, the pho was HOT.
Who knew I couldn't use chopsticks when inebriated.
You know what happens when you wear a short dress, it becomes shorter when you sit down = disaster. I was trying to move the bowl closer to me and the broth spilled out and onto my leg, O_O omg. /scoops ice out of water and rubs it on my leg. what the eff? 
Pho was less than mediocre. Eggrolls were BURNT.

Didn't you order spring rolls? They gave you eggrolls.
Two guys left and decided to pay separate, I guess we're not allowed to do that. 
Vietnamese waiter says something.
Birthday boy says 'what?'
$81?! Why isn't my order on the bill...
We're drunk we can't do correct math.
Everyone leaves.

Okay, there's six of us...how are we going to get a cab. Damn taxi drivers, would pull up see that were too many of us and speed away. Lol, what do we do...limo pulls up, $45 to take us back to TI...yea no thanks. omg....wave down that shuttle... guy pulls into the parking lot, how much to take us to treasure island? $20 SOLD! (which would have been equivalent to taking two cabs) The guy had just started his shift and was happy to bring us back to our hotel. Excellent.

Good times."}
{"text":"My family and I went to this restaurant on our reunion trip to Vegas. I loved that this is a 24 hour location. 

Also, they seated our 19 person group within minutes and started taking our orders right away. They aren't kidding about food! Wonderful. 

I ordered a pho Dac Biet (special) and was very satisfied. The broth was aromatic and the noodles were perfect. Very satisfied. 

It is a little crowded in the restaurant and the restroom got flooded while we were there. I know that they were busy but I'm sure it wasn't there first busy day and this is something that should be dealt with quickly."}
{"text":"There was a long wait at the pho place across the street, so my pops and I said \"pho-gettaboutit\" and decided to stop here instead. There are about 3 pho spots along Eastern within a mile, so Hendersonites need not drive out to Chinatown yonder to satisfy a simple pho craving. 

First impression: cafeteria vibes. We were glad that there were plenty of tables open. Tables are numbered to keep tabs of orders and your check. Pay at the register. I actually dug the simplicity of the place. Get in, get out! No frills. 

To start, we had the GOI CUON TOM, fresh shrimp rolls (2 pieces). I thought they were okay, I had to slather on the peanut sauce in order to taste anything. Their iced water had an odd taste, to me it smelled like bleach, so I asked for some canned coconut juice. I don't know if they were trying to up-sell, but they only had fresh coconut. I'm glad I took it -- refreshing!

We opted for small sized servings, which was plenty. I decided on the PHO TOM (shrimp) and my dad ordered the PHO HAI SAN (seafood). We were given the standard plate of veggies to share: bean sprouts, jalapeño pepper slices, basil, lime. Pretty good. My dad also tried their taro boba to-go, but he said it was too sweet. 

They also have lunch specials here, but quickly scanning their options, it seemed to be siding more towards chinese food. No pho specials on their lunch menu."}
{"text":"I don't usually do reviews, but ignore the 2.5 star rating. I had the pho dac biet and the broth was on point. My wife had the banh mi and she said the bread was fresh. Pricing was good, but don't forget your cash b/c it's cash only. Service was typical for an Asian restaurant. Overall, come try it out if you're looking for Asian food in Vegas. It also open 24 hours."}
{"text":"Maybe it's cause when we went, there were fewer tables, but I don't understand why people are complaining about the slow service. The food didn't even take that long to come out. Me and my boyfriend came here around 12am, and the place had a few tables, maybe 4 or 5. As soon as we walked in, we sat down, and got our drinks right away. Then our server took our order right away as well which were two Pho Tais. He brought out our vegetables. We got our soups in literally 5 minutes. The soup was super hot, the noodles were perfect, the soup tasted fresh, and the server was very kind. We will definitely come back and dine here again."}
{"text":"Tip: Super sweet honest owners unlike other places.  

I've been here a few times already and the food has been pretty decent, but what I find noteworthy is the service. There aren't as many Vietnamese restaurants in this side of town except for another Pho place in the shopping center on the other side of the freeway. I've been to both, and I can say the people at Pho Little Saigon are way nicer. 

I've had the traditional Vietnamese dinner here with the Tamarind soup and the braised fish. The employees let us know that the soup wasn't going to have all the ingredients that we expect from the traditional meal since herbs and other vegetables are scarce/expensive. Going out of their way to buy the proper ingredients would lead to them being tossed out because the clientele typically stick to what they are familiar with. 

I appreciated the honesty instead of being surprised with substituted ingredients or omission entirely. The people are honest, attentive, and hard working. It's one of those places that you come back to because the food is good and you want to help the proprietors out."}
{"text":"Pho tai gan.  the soup broth was yummy. rmeinds me of my mama's soup broth. that's saying a lot! 

Soda chanh - this was flat. meh.

Hieu tieu - the friends that got this LOVED This 

They have family style meals too \"Com ga din\" they'll serve you 2 types of veggies and a few other dishes. the Ca kho to (catfish in a claypot) was pretty good."}
{"text":"Not good.  Freezing inside. Horrible service. Won't be back.

I felt the pho was not salty enough and instead was sweet.  I was also aware of some mal-odor that was coming from the meat or the broth? Maybe rancid meat? The floors were littered with table scraps and even worse, stuck to the chairs and table like it's been uncleaned for days. I felt like I needed a Hep. shot after that meal.  I do agree that the broth was murky but I didn't mind that so much, it was the fact that it smelled rancid and tasted sweet. 

No, thank you, Pho Little Saigon.  I'll continue to get my 24 hr Pho from Kim Long across the street."}
{"text":"What a bad customer service ever..!!
My friends already order shrimp and rice 2 hours the food they bring on the table.
The other my friends order combo fried rice and I order fruits jus as well and they missed..!!
When we gonna pay they still want to charge the food that we never got.
Whatsss ..!!!"}
{"text":"Wow... reading all the reviews, I'm quite surprised.

This place is open 24 Hours! It can't get any better than that if you have a very late craving for Vietnamese food.

My cousin and I were out gambling in the late night and were craving for food. We were at T.I. (Treasure Island) walking around looking for a decent table to play at when we passed the \"Pho\" restaurant they have inside. We walked in and they were serving breakfast only, American style. All I can think about is WTF??

Still craving that pho after a night of gambling, we decided to hit Spring Mountain and found this place.

Best choice ever. There were a lot of people at this restaurant for being after lunch (3pm). Service was fast and attentive.

I had the pho tai nam gan. The bowl was big and reasonably priced. I typically would finish a large bowl but this time, I couldn't even do it. It was on par with some of the pho I have back home but this place is up there in my book.

The eggrolls were awesome! Just like how mom makes it. It was perfect. It was still nice and hot while it sat there, waiting for me to finish my pho.

I tried some of my kid brother's bun thit nuong cha gio, and this was really good also. I actually came back 12hours later for this. It was worth it.

I would recommend this place if you have a craving for pho!

$65 for 7 people... not bad."}
{"text":"Sigh.

Pho in Las Vegas... how can you go wrong?  Well, let me list the ways:

1) They are so busy and are understaffed for the lunch crowd.  Some of the waiters don't even care about anything.. they just bring your food and leave.  

Now, I really don't expect good service from an Asian restaurant, but when we asked for an extra bowl, a waiter shouldn't ignore you and act like they didn't hear your request.  Funny thing is that when we left the restaurant, there are hundreds of empty bowls sitting on the counter!  How hard is it to get an empty bowl from there?

2) The food is average.  I love to eat Pho.  It is such a simple, yet satisfying dish.  Unfortunately, this place is mediocre in their Pho bowls.  Seems like a lot of the other patrons order more rice dishes than Pho.  Which I find interesting, since this is a \"Pho\" restaurant.

3) The spoons and little bowls are greasy and oily.  Nothing is worse than grabbing a spoon and seeing your thumb print embedded into the spoon.  Make sure you wipe the spoon and little bowls!

4) One waiter has a Swastika tattoo on his upper chest and it is SO VISIBLE.  Look, I am all for your 1st amendment right of freedom of speech.  But, dude - don't unbutton your polo shirt so that you can show off that racist Swastika tattoo.

I think most people go here since it is one of the first Pho places on Spring Mountain Road from the strip.  Take my advice and go a little further down and to a better Pho place."}
{"text":"Great place to eat. I asked if they can make Bun Xao (prolly spelled wrong) Vietnamese crepe. They made it for me it was yummy highly recommend the soup and the crepes."}
{"text":"Warning: if you're hungry DO NOT COME HERE, they will let you wait until you give up hope and walk out. That's what I did, because it happened to me to many time... on top of that, I have let the servers know that I'm ready to order. I come at a down time so there's no excuses for this.

Service: 0 star
Food: 3 star (if you get to eat that is)"}
{"text":"I came here after a crazy drunken night with 3 other girls. 2 of us thought it tasted weird and the other 2 thought it was really good. I was the one who thought it tasted weird.

It was a bit on the soapy tasting side. I ended up using A LOT of hoisen sauce to get some sort of flavor, other than the soap taste I felt like I was receiving. They do give you a good amount of meat and definitely a good size bowl of Pho for the price. In Seattle, it would be about $8 for what they call their regular sizes, so that was a plus.

It's a pretty well kept place. It's got tacky paintings up that have nothing to do with an Asian restaurant, but then again, it's an Asian restaurant (no racism intended!! I'm the most Asian girl you'll ever meet). Lol. While eating here, I was reading the reviews about what other people said and how they don't like that they don't tell you that you need to come up and pay. That wasn't an issue for me because almost every Pho place I've been to, they require you to walk up to the register and pay when you're done. When walking in, I didn't see a sign that said \"cash only\" though. And apparently this place is cash only. If my friend didn't get up and secretly pay for all of us, I would of been in trouble because I rarely ever carry cash on me. So, maybe I missed the sign, but it is cash only for those of you who don't ever carry cash and need the heads up.

If ever in the area again and in desperate need of Pho, I may go here. But if I saw another Pho place near by, I'd most likely go to the other place. Nothing that great or special to come back for."}
{"text":"If I could give a minus that would be the best for this place....

They have been CLOSED down by the Health Dept.  they have been closed by the health dept. not once but 7 times ...the received 63 demerits not only had not hand soap in the building but they also had dead animals in the kitchen, it does not say what it was but ...I will never be here ever again...."}
{"text":"We had a hankering for Pho and this is the first Pho place you see when you drive down Spring Mountain Rd to Chinatown. I had my standard Pho Tai Chin and the broth had a definite herbal flavor, good balance of cloves and anise. The broth wasn't particularly beefy and I think the Las Vegas tap water threw me off at first.

The noodles were fine as were the brisket slices. The slices of tai arrived well done already and were on the tough side.

Standard bean sprouts, basil, jalapenos, and lime as garnishes.

The place is nice and spacious and features plasma TVs on every wall. We sure got our dose of Hurricane Ike news for lunch."}
{"text":"After a long night of drinking we went to get some pho and heard pho kim long was the best but the line was long so we decided to give this place a shot. Ordered pho tai and it was pretty bland. 

Went to pho kim long the next night and it was day and night. It was so much more flavorful.

Conclusion: good things come to those who wait!"}
{"text":"The pho is great. I usually get the number 32 which is the rare steak and beef ball noodle soup. The soups run about $8-10 as well. For appetizer I like to the ground pork rolled with shrimp and carrot. The sauce pairs great with the ground pork roll because of the fried rice paper that is wrappped around the roll. It also comes with lettuce to wrap around the roll as well which makes it an even more tasty appetizer. Other appetizers I would suggest is the shrimp roll as well.

I come here mostly for the #32 pho. The dine in experience is ok. If you are one looking to just come in to satisfy your pho craving this place would be it. They do have flat screens to watch the news on which i think is supposed to help boost the contemporary feel in the restaurant."}
{"text":"I really love how fast the food gets to my table! A little pricey but not too bad. Never really that busy. Customer service is okay but not the greatest."}
{"text":"Rude waiter and dirty inside. Why should anybody want to dine here. Didn't even try the food. We walked out due to a ride waiter. I am spending money and demand to be treated as a customer"}
{"text":"This restaurant has a variety of foods, but they have horrible customer service. It is way too crowded! Too many tables and chairs for a little restaurant. 

Anyway, so my family wanted to eat pho before heading back to Cali and it took us 45 minutes for our food to come out! After asking them about it twice or so! First, we thought it took a while because they were busy, but nope, the waiter never put in our order or lost it or whatever. We were about to walk out! Obviously they saw us sitting there waiting but never did they went and check to see what was going on or at least ask us again if someone took our order yet. There was a table behind us that came after us and ate & left and we still didn't get our food! Their pho was very bland and the meats were really weird tasting and weird looking! Even though they have a variety of different dishes here, I will not be coming back. I would recommend going somewhere else down the spring mountain street!"}
{"text":"Put in our order, was told that the dish I ordered, clay pot fish, may take awhile. I stated that it was \"ok\", that I'd wait, since the other half of our party hasn't arrived yet, anyway. They brought out my dish at the same time that they brought out my mom and sister's pho, which doesn't take long to make since the soup is already made. The fish came out looking sad as hell, very disappointing, since I KNOW it's not that hard to make! If you've ever had the clay pot fish, you'd know that it should look a rich caramelized deep brown color. What I was served, did not have that rich color. On top of it not looking appetizing...

THE FISH WAS NOT COOKED!!

Now, as much a fan I am of sushi, this dish is not meant for the fish to be raw. 


My mom and sister ordered pho, and their soup came out lukewarm. Anyone that's had pho knows the soup should be steaming! Furthermore, when my mom asked for more basil since they only gave us 1 sprig for two bowls of pho, the man responded, \"we gave you some\"... that did it!! Up til now, my mom was cool about everything, but now my mom was mad!! She help up the one sprig and said (in Vietnamese), \"You gave us one sprig of basil for two bowls of pho, how is that enough?\" The man walked away mad and never came back. 

Our experience was so bad there that I actually called the other half of our party that we were waiting for and told them to NOT COME THERE, that it was \"THAT\" bad!

I asked for another bowl of rice, since I wasn't eating the fish, I was gonna eat more rice to fill me up. IT NEVER CAME. 

We finally gave up hope for this place and talked about not leaving a tip, because, lets face it, they did not deserve any sort of tip! Well guess what???? When we went to go pay, these MF's added 15% tip to our bill!! They are thiefs! There is no sign that tells patrons that they automatically do this, and our group of 4 people is hardly enough people to do this to.

They must know they suck, therefore gotta steal their 15% tip from all the suckers that actually walk into this restaurant. 

If I could give zero stars, I would do just that!"}
{"text":"Not sure why it's got such a low reviews on here. But their food tasted amazing and service was top notch. I would definitely recommend. Also their honey dew juice was fantastic."}
{"text":"We made the mistake of going here without reading the reviews. 

As we walked in, everything looks okay. There's big pictures of all the different Vietnamese dishes on the wall, with numbers next to them. As we sat down however, we started to realize everything was a little dirty. First, the table felt a little bit sticky, then the wooden chairs were sticky as well. Like they haven't been cleaned in months. The first pho spoon was dirty, so we had to dig for a clean one. This is not too uncommon in a Pho restaurant, so we ignored it. After we ordered, the food came out and, it was actually good. Not the best we've had, but definitely above average. Near the end of our meal, a little black bug crawled out from the window onto our table, my wife grabbed a napkin and brushed it away, so it scurried off quickly back toward the window. We got a good look at it, it was definitely a cockroach! We immediately lost our appetite and decided that we wanted to get out of this place. That's when I opened up Yelp and saw the other reviews. I've seen it first hand, so it's definitely real. 

It's too bad, because the food is good, but until they get this placed cleaned and establish a better cleaning routine, I will never come back to this restaurant. Do yourself a favor and avoid until further notice."}
{"text":"Although Little is a part of the name in the title, words can be deceiving because inside it's pretty spacious. I'm unsure to why the past reviews are crappy but I think the answer to that question is there seems to be a change in management.

I just gotta say that this place is one of the best pho places I've ever been too. The pho broth is one of a kind. One that cures hangovers with just a slurp. The noodles are boiled not too soft or not too hard. And the meat is so tender a bite of it will just make your mouth waters.

The appetizer egg rolls were really appetizing. It didn't even need car cables to give a jump start to the meal. Wrap the lettuce and condiments around the egg roll and dip in the sweet savoring fish sauce and bam you're in a place called heaven. 

The servers are top of the line. You never have to ask for a refill. You get treated like kings and queens.... and if you want to perform well there's a mic and some space for you."}
{"text":"This place is alright..  I don't know why I suggested coming here! haha my porkchop with rice was pretty good but I've had better. I didn't try the pho but my friend didn't eat all of hers so I'm assuming it sucked. Overall, mediocre."}
{"text":"I am Vietnamese and this is one of the worse pho I have ever had. 

Taste nothing like pho. Waste of money and time."}
{"text":"I've only been here at night and there has never been a wait. This may be a bad sign...

I've eaten the pho here a couple times. I always thought it was decent. Nothing to write home about but it was OK. During my last visit I decided to try something other than pho, after all Vietnamese food is not limited by its most famous dish in America. Here at Pho Little Siagon, this was a mistake. I ordered a dish from their \"family dinner\" section of the menu with a description that included beef, shrimp and squid. My boyfriend got pho and dumplings, which were brought out quick and left me sitting there hungry and without my dish. When it finally arrived, it was mostly a plate of vegetables with a few pieces if the promised beef, shrimp and squid mixed in a brown sauce. It was basically $13 for something you'd find at a medicore Chinese joint. I'll admit that this was probably my fault for trying something other than pho. 

The beef in both my dish and my boyfriend's pho was not fresh and had a slight smell to it. Some of the shrimp had not been cleaned properly and the squid was just plain chewy pieces from the freezer.

As stated in a previous review, they do not give you an itemized bill. Instead they just ring you up and tell you the total. I tried to ask for it but they just handed me my copy of the credit card receipt instead. I gave up and left. 

I won't be back."}
{"text":"Food was actually good if you ignore the hair I found in there. Perhaps it would have been better if they gave me what I ordered. Usually I would let them know it was wrong but it was a lost cause. Everyone there is too busy to care. At least I finally got my water after I finished my entire meal and right before I left?"}
{"text":"good beef noodles. .double size than other pho restaurant.  noodle is best, meat is delicious.  after pho so 1, closed,  i tried 6 other pho restaurant. .but this is best..i don't know other dishes,  just beef noodles. ."}
{"text":"I order pho combo, the meat is overly chunky, not properly cut. I and my friends literally choke on the meat. I will not come again, pho was not good, springroll was not good, service was not good. Restroom was over flood with water. Smh"}
{"text":"We had been here a few years ago and remembered it was ok and quick.
It's a huge place and had a few patrons.  We both ordered banh mi sandwiches; the pork and the chicken.  The bread was toasted and the banh mi was fine.  Nothing extraordinary.  It is a cheap and quick meal for an super cheap price."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Pho place in Las Vegas. I eat pho almost weekly, I've lived in San Diego and Los Angeles with some great pho! And this place is still in my upper favorite pho places of all time. They have large portions and are generous with the tofu and meat! Best of all, look for the home made dark chilli sauce on the table in the glass dish. It's not on all tables, so you may have to look for it, dark red with oil and it's aaahhhmmmaaazing in the pho."}
{"text":"I've been to this place several times and each time was great.  It was kind of surprising to see this place get such bad reviews.  The last time I went there my bowl of Pho was nearly perfect.  Usually when I go to other places there is more noodles than beef or vice versa or the beef has lots of fat on it.  When I go here the beef and noodles are proportionate and there is no fat on the beef.  This place also seems pretty popular too.  Each time I go there at night there's always a good crowd.  They serve more than Pho at this place too and the servings are a nice size.  I ordered the BBQ Pork here a few times and it was really good.

The only cons I can think of this place are sometimes they might bring you an appetizer while you are eating your main dish.  Last time I went there nobody was at the door to seat me; I had to walk to the counter to get service.  On the menus it looked like they raised the price and parts of the menu were covered in white out and they just wrote the new price over the white out instead of just printing new menus.  

It's cash only but several other Asian restaurants are too so that's not a big deal to me."}
{"text":"COCKROACHES IN MY FUCKING SOUP! Stay away, I'm seriously fucking sick to my stomach right now. They are still trying to charge me even after I showed them it floating in my soup, mind you I've been eating it already. I told them I'm not giving them anything. I mean pest control is not that hard and if you have a problem take care of it. How dirty does the back have to be for this to happen. NEVER AGAIN!"}
{"text":"After a night of partying, my boyfriend and I woke up in need of PHO. After trying Pho Kim Long with my friends during my previous trip to vegas, I suggested we go there (also on Spring Mountain). My boyfriend was not at all impressed by the refined/contemporary decor of the restaurant  and the staff all in matching uniforms. Why? Because he didn't believe the restaurant was Vietnamese owned and therefore, the pho would not be \"authentic.\" Baby, who cares!? I'm hungover and  I want some damn PHO in mah belly! Anyway, we sit down for about 5-10 minutes and no one helps us out! Hungry, hungover, and irritated, we walked right out.

We drove right across the street to Pho Little Saigon since boyfriend ate there with his friends and said it was pretty good. Right when we walked in we could tell that the patrons were mostly Vegas locals compared to Pho Kim Long and its quiet ambiance. You'll also know it is Vietnamese owned because they blast \"Paris by Night\" videos on the TV screen.

So we both order a regular bowl of Pho Tai Nam (rare steak and well done flank beef noodle soup) and an order of Goi Cuon (shrimp and pork spring roll) to share. Although the pho was a little more oily than what I'm used to, it was pretty yummy and the portions are impressive. I come from pho central (san gabriel valley) and their portions aren't half this size unless you order a large bowl. Only bad thing was the cleanliness of the overalll restaurant...oh well, clean doesn't necessarily mean good right?

Next time you wake up with a hangover in vegas, do yourself a favor and eat a bowl of PHO. Just make sure you go into a pho restaurant that has Vietnamese patrons 'cause that way you'll for sure know its good stuff! Hahaha"}
{"text":"NOTE: I'm only reviewing this place based on what I heard and experienced. I didn't get a chance to eat here, but I do have an AWESOME story to tell...

You know wassup..after the club..where do you usually hit up?! The spot that's open 24 hours or hella late. In San Diego, it's usually Denny's for me. I have many memories from there (good and bad), but mostly good. =)

In Vegas...it was \"Pho Little Saigon\" for us! Now..I have been to establishments for pho post-clubbing and it is always PACKED full of asians. We sure love our pho! Usually, it is the go-to spot to sober up and grab some good eats, even though everything does taste good under the influence of alchy.

Half drunk and feet in major pain from the shitty heels that I wore, I dashed to use the restroom while everyone was seating. Again, this place was practically empty and wow so was the restroom. Very rare for a female. Oh! Joy! I get to pick my own stall! The BIG one! I do my bizz and I noticed the cool electronic hand towel machine. Wait..no paper towels are coming out. This is automatic and sensored?! Is it broken?! Oh wait..a light on the bottom right was visible so I do a circular wave and WABAAM...paper towels pop out! Woohoo! Pretty awesome feeling when you're typsy!

Next thing you know another girl (from the club I assumed) walks in slightly typsy as well and was about to get paper towels and I noticed she was having a difficult time getting the paper towels to come out.  Feeling like an \"expert\" by now, I showed her how to operate the machine and in amazement she was pretty impressed that I was able to figure it out and she couldn't. She kinda felt dumb. haha
 
So..my head was kinda getting slightly big at this moment and we both were about to depart the restroom and as I was exiting I went straight out the door into the MENS RESTROOM!! Well..ALMOST! Oh man! I stopped just in the knick of time and she looks at me and we both laugh uncontrollably! I didn't feel so smart anymore and she didn't feel so dumb. =/

Head over to where my group was and told my little story and all were amused or from what I recall at least. Wasn't slightly hungry since I ate prior to clubbing, which wasn't very long since I couldn't groove much to the music due to my CRAPTASTIC shoes! Ugh! Anywhoo, I noticed poor Melly Su was somewhat enjoying her soup until she accidentally spilled it on her legs..SUPER HOT..like boiling HOT! I only touched the bowl, and it was waaay toooo HOT!! No bueno. I think that may have woke/sobered her up though!

What the PHO?! I know. These pho jokes are getting old, but I had to slip one in there. It's kinda like tradition. Anywhoo...No mmm's or ahhhh's from the group of friends so I thought maybe it was just A-OK. 

Soup is just soup sometimes. Oh ya..I also recall Melly Su telling my pal, \"Chris-Chan\" to eat her burnt eggroll. haha! It seriously was beyond burnt! As typsy as I was..I even knew it wouldn't taste good. Who you foolin' \"Little Saigon\" ??? GHETTOO!!

The End.

**Okay..so maybe not an AWESOME story. Maybe it would sound better under the influence??? Oh well..still worthy of a review right?! hehe"}
{"text":"I walked in And I was told to sit anywhere so I sat down they gave me menu I set down at 2:30 p.m. they brought me water and I said there for 10 more minutes wait for someone to come take My order. Is my 1st time here so I gave him the benefit of the doubt I was about to leave then they came to my water the fool was not good the soup was bland and the chicken wings were bland also they never came to check on me. I always  Try to give a restaurant a benefit of the doubt but this place I would never step foot in it again"}
{"text":"Service sucks! I will never come back here ever again! They mess up orders, they automatically charge tip even with party under 6 ppl. Food does not even taste good. The workers are really rude and the service sucks"}
{"text":"Here is what I review for this place. I currently own a Pho restaurant in Las Vegas as well so I don't like to give negative review to restaurants. I ate here like 3 years ago and it was already horrible. I decided to come back again since they advertised on local Vietnamese megazine saying they changed new ownership and the recipe. It was a late night on Christmas nite so there is no other place to go. My friend and I decided to give this another try. When we got in, the place was empty. It should have been somewhat busy because it was holiday. First, we looked at the menu. The prices are really high but it is okay if the food is good. I ordered banh canh cha ca- Vietnamese Udon with fish \"patty\" and my friend ordered hu tieu hai vi- seafood noodle soup. Both orders came out pretty fast but I was oh well they gave me white fishballs instead of fish patty. I am easy and sleepy so I just nah, just eat then go home. When I took a spoon of soup, I tasted MSG. The soup is very tasty because everybite is MSG. I am 100%sure, they do MSG as main ingredient. No, no! MSG is used in Viet cuisine. However, just to increase the seasoning not the main ingredient source. There is barely garnish in the soup. My friend's order just tasted the same instead of Udon. He has noodle, shrimp, squid and fishballs. Hopefully they will find a solution improving their food quality so the business can grow and improve Yelp reviews.
I was so tired to take picture."}
{"text":"This restaurant charge over bill and they gave me fake bill when i request bill.
All customer need to check the bill because m they charge different price than menu price."}
{"text":"My family was here on Monday for lunch and it was great.  This place have a better taste and more selections then any other places around this area.  Since we all were so hungry so everything tasted good.  The two orders I didn't like was the soup (Canh chua) and the che.  Overall, this place have good services, reasonable prices, and good location."}
{"text":"Given the late hour/early morning, for such a wide open restaurant, it was largely empty.  Did we miss the crowd? How we chose this place, I have no idea.    

My pho (with everything under the Vega$ $un) was served very hot (like the Vega$ de$ert) and the flavor was manageable (unlike the traffic on the Vega$ $trip), however....

While you don't need any lube to throw a hot dog down a hallway (if you know what I mean), there was enough of an oily broth in my pho that could make even Obama whince.  I was jacked by whoever filled my bowl by skimming the top of the pho broth - where all the oil floats.  Doesn't \"Pho-Making 101\" include oil reduction? Even British Petroleum probaby couldn't have done a better job.  

The pho also averages $6-$7, so don't be surprised that for a party of five (5) and some appetizers, you end up with an $80 bill.  The math is right, but hey, it's Vega$."}
{"text":"The biggest positive of this place is that it is open 24 hours and it serves Vietnamese, if that is what you are craving. Beyond that, there is nothing too special about this restaurant. 

I only had the pho and I have to agree with other reviewers that the broth is not very good. The service is also not very good, my water was never refilled. Lastly, prices were on the high side. The pho was about $8 a bowl for the regular size, they had a smaller size, but no larger sizes or options for extra noodles or meat. I wanted to order bahn mi as well, but at $3 dollars a sandwich, I decided to pass.

I guess you could say this place is like Pho Kim Long, only a little closer to the strip. Oh, I guess that's another positive aspect of this restaurant, not enough to bump it up to three stars though."}
{"text":"1 star = for their HUGE selection.  They have an extensive menu that extends to their walls; over 100 different menu items to choose from!

2 stars = wait staff is super cool; they remember who you are!  

3 stars = when you request for special additions or changes to your food, they are accomodating.  I like to get their pork & grilled shrimp vermicelli bowl with less noodle/extra veggies, and no bean sprouts!  Result = low carb!

4 stars = Their soup broth here is one of the good ones in Las Vegas; 
good pho soup broth is a super rare find here so beware!  But it's good here!  Yaye!

They also serve boba drinks which is always a plus to a high sodium content restaurant!  I need my sweets!"}
{"text":"This is a-ok pho place in Chinatown of Las Vegas. They are open 24 hours so that makes it convenient. I usually get combo pho with everything in it. 

The servers are pretty attentive and food comes fast. It's a big restaurant so it's good for big groups. 

They have picture menu all around their wall so it's easy to read and see what you want to get or what the entree looks like. They also have boba drinks and smoothies."}
{"text":"Just what we needed before a long drive back to California on a Sunday afternoon.

+ easy to find location with decent parking
+ large restaurant, plenty of seating, clean bathroom
+ good and fast service
+ extensive menu
+/- pho tasted fine, nothing special
+/- egg rolls are gigantic as were the vegetables accompanying it
- no spring rolls today, what the pho?!
- i think the thai iced tea did not agree with my stomach
- kind of pricey"}
{"text":"So I came here the other night. I know- bad idea to dine at China Town during the weekend after Christmas and before New Year. The entire area was packed and our originally choice Pho Kim Long had a 12 names before us wait. I am very level headed person so I tried to keep that in mind in rating this place but what I experienced was just.. Disappointing.

So the pho was good IMO. We all got the house special pho dac biet. My comparison pho is PhoKim Long and I thought the broth was better and it had more meat. So I did think the food was good.

So we come in and I know what to expect at most establishments in the China Town area: the service is spotty and it can come off as rude.

This was like the worst experience I had dining somewhere.

So we walk in and a man simply asks how many and we say three and he starts to seat us. Out of no where this other man who was bussing starts yelling at the man seating us and makes these wild hand gestures i.e. Making an \"x\" with his arms and shaking his head. It is hard to put into words what happened but it was not welcoming at all. Apparently the guy was trying to tell his coworker they only have soup, the pho dac biet. No other food items. No sandwiches or any entrees or appetizers. That's what we came for anyways so he could have spared us the theatrics.

I have no idea why it took them ten minutes to come back to take our order. THEY ONLY HAVE ONE THING AVAILABLE AT THE MOMENT! I was about to leave after thinking about the rude seating situation but the guy comes to take our order. We are told they have the other soups also. No worries! We all wanted what they told us they had anyways. So we wait for soup. Two other tables are seated by us while we wait. They are also told in a not as rude way that they only have soup. They all get the same soup as us. 

So I'm never one to bring up the race card but we didn't appreciate that the 3 gentlemen seated 10 minutes after us some how get their soup before us. My table of 3 didn't speak their language. My table of three which consisted of my Mexican best friend, and my half black cousin, and myself. We get ours a few minutes later. I tried to think no.. Maybe they ordered something else... But the guy who seated them spoke a language other than English to them (which is how I know they spoke the same language) and the rude busser guy took their order but told them they only had one size of the house special dac biet pho. So I know 100% that we got the same thing and they were seated after us and got their food first. 

Needless to say we didn't leave a great tip but we did leave a decent one even considering the experience. 

I didn't one star the place because the other guys were okay and I surprisingly liked their pho.

I looked back at when we came in and wish we left. I'm not one to complain. I feel like if you are able to control the situation by leaving then you should. We just really wanted pho! 

The whole thing just made me sad. Maybe that guy was having a crappy day but he was constantly yelling across the restaurant, constantly frowning, and just being rude to his coworkers and his patrons. He should have went home. Many people chose not to be seated once being informed of the only soup. The owners should really check out the reviews left by everyone."}
{"text":"Pho Little Saigon is a very good place to eat some good Pho among other goodies they have on their menu. For this visit our table was lined up with Ga Chua Ngot, Heo Xao Chua Ngot, Pho Dac Biet, and I had some good Tra Thai for a nice beverage selection. 

The Ga Chua Ngot was really good! The chicken was nice and tender with every bite, the sauce was just right. The Heo Xao Chua Ngot was also really good with fried pork not so chewy, like I've had at other places, and the sauce was delicious.

Pho Dac Biet  was really good too. This was my first Pho type experience so I was excited to jump right in and let my taste buds go to work. With the Steak, Brisket, Flank, and Tripe mixture it was all very good and well put together in the soup with the broth it made it all a pleasant first experience. I will definitely come back for more in the future!

And to finish up the service was good! The waiter made frequent checks on us, gave us the menu just in case we wanted to order more and waited patiently for us to finish up the meal. They have so much food on the menu I will need to come back to see what other good foods they have to offer. Good Place!"}
{"text":"I found a half-foot strand of thick hair in my Pho Dac Biet. I give props to the waiter for not apologizing and keeping a smile on his face the whole time there. Also accompanied by noisy waiters, dull atmosphere, and crappy foreign music, I could not stay a second longer. If you're a tourist reading this review, let Vietnamese wait until you get home. There are better ways to spend your money in Vegas and gambling is one of them."}
{"text":"If u work here, at least try and act the part. It took 3 tries to get an empty bowl and the dac biet was served last... No biggie but it was an after thought as we reminded him of our order. Oh ya, number 182 on the wall is the same as 93 in their menu but he couldn't understand what's written on your own wall. There were only 6 tables being served  and the guy would not stand still for our order like he was playing video poker in the back."}
{"text":"*Update* After eating here I got the worst food poisioning I have ever had!!!*  The pho was decent tasting at the time, before the gut wrentching pain.  Besides the food of death they have some serious shady buisness practices.  I ordered drinks with my meal but they never came.  The waiter won't bring you a check at the end of the meal, you have to go up to the front and tell them what table you were at, and even then they don't give an itemized bill.  I wanted coffee so I asked for some to go, they did make it but bringing it out I got an eye roll that went so far back into the guys head he could have fallen down.  Thinking about what I ordered and what I recieved I know I paid for the drinks I didn't get and I think the waiter even tipped himself.  NO just NO.  Do not eat here it's not worth it!"}
{"text":"First and foremost: the customer service is almost nonexistent. We went in and had to wait almost 10 minutes in the front before someone finally saw us, even though we were the only ones there.

I shared the #47 with my little cousin, my mom had the bahn mi, and my boyfriend had the fried catfish with rice and banana boba. Please note that the boba drink did NOT come with boba pearls, which was a little ridiculous because one would think it would not cost an extra charge. Oh well. At least I know now.

The food came out rather quickly, though not together (small problem, but still one to be said). My boyfriend really liked his catfish and my mom seemed to enjoy her sandwich, but my soup was SALTY. I could barely taste the meat and I felt like needing to drink 3 gallons of water afterward. Though the portions were bigger than you would usually get for a bowl of pho, I could barely eat it because it felt like I was drinking water from the Dead Sea (but even THAT would have been less salty).

Not to forget, we were not checked up on at all during our time and only when we flagged down one of the waitresses for 5 minutes did they come to give us our check. I'm not sure if she spoke English, too. She did not understand my mom when she asked for to-go boxes until another waiter came and translated.

Our total came up to about $50, which was a decent amount to pay for the amount of food we received. You pay up front at the register near the front of the restaurant. The signs up front says cash only, but I was able to pay with my card. They should really get rid of those 2 signs...

Overall, the food was decent, but the service was subpar. By a lot. I would probably come here again if I was craving some late night pho because it is open 24/7, but I doubt that would be anytime soon."}
{"text":"This place must be open by miracle of something. Rude servers, inattentive, disrespectful and disorganized. I didn't leave because my family stoped me from causing a scene. We had 8 different people trying to serve us and not one got anything right. I felt disrespected and offended by their attitude and service. Almost like a racist place to eat at. Bathrooms are dirty tables are as well and the meat in the soup was so chewy it could have been called a beef gum soup. Will not be returning to this place. At this point I didn't slap someone in the face after they whispered and mumbled whatever they said simply because my children were present. Don't come to this place. Oh and don't think you can order drinks because they won't serve them until food is ordered. And bring a few lemons in your pocket because they're running low"}
{"text":"Needed to take my truck to a nearby shop today, so pho for breakfast!  Tendon was very tender, broth was flavorful and not too salty. Small bowl was a good amount for breakfast. Service was quick, restaurant was clean."}
{"text":"Went here because it was close to our hotel and located next to \"Chinatown\" shopping plaza.  I like the fact that it's 24-hours----perfect for Vegas!  I'm glad they're not CASH-only too.  Pictures everywhere of their items --huge plus!  It's [robably not the best Viet food I've eaten, but service is awesome!  The waiters know good enough English to answer your questions and give you what you ask for.  Tried their bun bo hue (I like the fact that they have actual pig feet in there instead of slices of pork and skin), but again, not the best I've eaten.  Their chicken rice dish had bland yellowish rice....not good at all.  I usually avoid ordering boba tea drinks at restaurants but their honeydew smoothie is really good (a bit more milk than usual), but I had to order it again after getting it the first time. :-)"}
{"text":"At first we fell in love with this place being new to Pho. We would usually order the beef stew, combination fried rice and sometimes calamari. Food was always good but service always sucked and since we were new to it all we went back a few times. Plus the employees sit at another table kinda watching you the whole time (very uncomfortable). Our last time ordering calamari it was super salty and we sent it back. The bug eye tweaked out chubby guy said why did you eat it if it was salty...well how the hell were we supposed to know it would be salty without tasting a few pieces duhhhh anyway after that my bf refused to go back.

I had finally convinced him to try it again minus the calamari... well there was a different server this time. A skinny taller guy with a black vest. He seemed to know what customer service was which made the experience a whole lot better but after reading the other reviews about the auto 15% add on to the bill they have definitely lost us!!"}
{"text":"Grrrrrr8!  You have to try the General Chicken!  I have a pretty strong feeling my husband is officially addicted to this dish!  LOL!  I've tried their spring rolls, pho noodle bowls and wonton soup.  Everything we've had has been really good.  The servers are nice.  Thai tea is super yummy!  We're not sure why this place is always empty....More people need to try this place!  
Considering my husband's addiction...we will be back!"}
{"text":"Very simple restaurant with excellent service and food was fabulous. Everything came out fast, hot food, and very flavorful."}
{"text":"OK restaurant, for a nice vietnamese breakfast, the food and soup was ok.
The servicewas ok.
Overall, somewhat cheap, but good not excellent..."}
{"text":"Went in for Pho Ga with ginger sauce. Started to eat and then notice a bug in ginger sauce........It was a COCKROACH!!!!......UGG........waiter replaced with no explanation or apology....That ended our dining experience here forever......Where or Where is the Health Department????"}
{"text":"Even though the majority of these reviews were in the mediocre to negative area we wanted to give this a try since it is 24 Hour.  I was pleasantly surprised with both the customer service and food.  All three people that helped us were great and really friendly which shocked me as a ton of the reviews said that they were unfriendly.  Get the egg rolls and wrap them in the lettuce they were Really Good!!"}
{"text":"With all the reviews saying this place is terrible, I would say this place is pretty good for a place that serves 24 hours. The waiter was really nice and had a positive attitude. This place reminds me of similar pho restaurants in Southern California. I would come here again. 
If you happen to order the Cafe Sua Da, that shit is strong af. Hits you with an upper cut to knock yourself up."}
{"text":"I love PHOOOOOOOOOOO and I was really excited this place was fairly close to work. I came for lunch and there was no one else here during lunch (strange?). I ordered the usual...Pho Tai and the egg rolls. My friend had the vegetarian pho since she wasn't into eating all this crazy meat. My pho broth was sweet. I'm not a very sweet person and when I have pho I like it to be savory! The beef was a bit hard to eat and chew through. Eggrolls were good, nothing extraordinary, but my friend seemed to enjoy it seeing it was her first time. Overall, service was good, but their pho could be better. I probably won't be back as there are a couple of other pho places down the street that I love. Sorry Pho Little Saigon."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service, they're very rude. Been here a few times, almost gotten into fights with them for unreasonable reasons. The pho is okay, it's not bad but would not come back. The staffs have a negative vibe. I don't usually give reviews unless it's really bad or really good."}
{"text":"Don't recommend what so ever. So terrible, we tried to bring one of our friends to try pho for the first time and the service was terrible, we ordered a Thai tea Boba, the Boba was hard and the tea was too strong. It was so gross we didn't pay for it and we're not allowed back but I don't even care, I'm never gonna go back. It was just a waste of time. Don't go here, go up the street to pho Kim long they're pho is way better and cheaper."}
{"text":"Seriously, this restaurant hires the worse and most stupid servers.We stopped by on a Friday night. Restaurant was not busy at all. A few minutes later our server came and took our order. Weird part is that he didn't want to write down our order. I guess I did not care until 5 minutes later that he came back saying he forgot what we've ordered. 10 minutes later he came back saying they ran out of springs rolls. He tried to give us something else. we reused and said no. He didn't like our answer and started acting nasty with us. He said I was not understanding and I did not speak English LOL. There is a difference between refusing a service or something and not being able to speak or understand English. He gave us a dirty look and left immediately. Finally, he did bring our food. Food was average not great. 
I have to say this server was very rude, uneducated and somewhat he treats customers like if they were idiots. He feels we had to kiss his a$$ just because we were hungry and he worked at this restaurant. Lame service!!!"}
{"text":"Me: Hi do you guys have oxtail Pho? 
Owner: No (looks me up and down)
Me: Oh okay. What's your most pop..
Owner: (cuts me off) Just regular! Just regular!
So hey guys if you're looking for just \"regular\", a rude creepy owner, and an overall dingy restaurant that smells musty...then you've found your gold if you eat here. I'd give this place a zero if I could. Yuck!"}
{"text":"Ordered some take out Pho soup on our way out of town. Portions are huge for the price (less than $10) and the gentlemen who took my order went above and beyond (without me asking) to make a combination he thought I would like. He got the combination of meat in the Pho perfect! The broth is delicious as was the whole bowl. This will definitely be my new 'go to' Pho place when leaving town."}
{"text":"In the all Asian strip malls at the corner of Spring Mountain and Valley View is Pho Little Saigon. It is pretty large, pretty clean, and has a large menu of popular Vietnamese dishes.  This includes Khai Vi appetizers like Bi Cuon and Banh Xeo; Rice Porridge (Chao); 20 different Pho soups; about the same number of Com Dia rice plates and Bun Vermicelli dishes, Banh Canh (Vietnamese Udon); Bo Bai Mon (7 course beef) for $22.99, and Hu Tieu. Also Vietnamese desserts and drinks. 

I tried the Hu Tieu My Tho and it was excellent. You can order this wet as a soup or dry as more like a stew, with the more chewy clear sukiyaki type noodles. I ordered it dry, which comes with a side bowl of soup broth to pour over the ingredients after mixing. 

The Hu Tiel My Tho was chock full of ingredients: several large shrimp, a couple of fish cake balls, Chinese style sliced pork, Vietnamese style sliced pork, a couple of boiled Quail eggs, lots of green onions, chives, green leaf lettuce, yellow onions, and ground pork in a pork paste sauce. Delicious and only $6.59.

This place has 3 strobe lights blinking outside to help you find it. Inside, they have the obligatory plasma screens (4 in total!) showing Vietnamese variety show DVDs. They are open from 8:00am to
11:00pm 7 days a week! They say Cash Only, but they accepted my credit card when I asked them. 

If you are stuck on the strip and don't want to spend another $50 on overpriced Casino food, go west half a mile on Spring Mountain."}
{"text":"When I first walked in I didn't know what to expect but I was very please with how pleaser the man who greated me was. I think he was the owner but I'm not to sure. I got a chicken vermachille to go. And when I opened it I was definitely impressed with the presentation! Especially since it was a to go meal and all. The food was just as yummy as it looked too!! Very fresh. Oh and of course I had to try the boba. They had a bunch of flavors!! I got taro since I'm a big fan. It was the beat boba tea I've EVER HAD!!! the consistency was thick throughout the entire drink! Down to the last sip. And it was such a rich and bold flavor! Definitely far from watered down. Tasted like legit taro, not artificial at all!!!!! They have a LOT on the menu too. AND its 24 hours!!! Absolutely the best."}
{"text":"Writing this review as I leave this place and sadly If I could give this place no stars I would. Keeping this review short and simple... Came here with 8 friends on a late night and found a baby cockroach, in one of my friends pho after he was half way done with his food. I don't know what's worse but the fact the cockroach was in the pho or the fact that everyone got the same thing and it was the same broth? I guess thanks for the free food? Never again will I come here!!"}
{"text":"This is my last time here... Pho tastes salty & no flavor. We have a group of 9 people and every single one of us complain that food here suck...

To be fair, I give 2 stars instead of 1 due to no wait (duh) and has plenty of space."}
{"text":"The beef pho soup was actually very  good,  the egg rolls were very fresh and crispy! The on Choy was young green and very well done. Why 3 stars because the Service sucked!"}
{"text":"We love this place. It's our go-to on a cold weather night. The rare steak pho is my husband's favorite and my favorite is the seafood pho. My 12 yr old son loves the meat ball pho. I'll switch it up sometimes and I like the seafood udon noodle soup."}
{"text":"The pho here is okay.  They give huge portion sizes, but the flavor is a little off.  I thought I tasted chicken broth last time instead of beef broth.  My coworker is a vegetarian so we come here sometimes.  I like their taro boba.  Their menu is posted on the wall with pictures, which makes it easy for me since I'm not Asian.  I took my Thai girlfriend here once.  She was not impressed either."}
{"text":"24/7 Pho joint... what's not to like?

Apparently, there's a couple things I name.

1) Staff - A lot of people say the staff is mean or rude... but what do you expect from a place that is running 24/7 and dealing with drunk people all the time? True. I think they could smile a tad more, but my server was just fine. I was a little intimidated by him, but he was plenty responsive. 

2) Food - Pretty bland broth. It tastes like regular pho broth, but cut with water. My sister in law said this is the style she's used to eating when she's at her boyfriends. It's more \"homestyle\" I suppose.

3) Cleanliness - I did have a small issue with the cleanliness. Some of the lettuce served was dirty and had some bugs on it. No matter, just pick it off and keep on eating. 

Overall, I knew what I was getting into and I wasn't expecting too much out of this place. The food was light and bland but it hit the spot. The meal was cheap and the service was just okay. I probably would come back, but only if I can't find anywhere else to eat at 3:30 AM. 

My street creds:
I first got into cooking & food when I was in college. After being rejected by numerous girls and getting zero action, I decided it was time for a change. I needed a new makeover to boost my geeky image. I applied for a cooking position at a Mediterranean-Italian Restaurant near my home and learned to cook all sorts of dishes. I never became a professional chef, but I continue to enjoy & love food. 9 years later and 55 lbs heavier, I have a new passion for traveling and trying different foods around the world."}
{"text":"You see advertisements for this place all over in the \"Asian area\". 24 HOUR PHO is all I saw. So Cali has an abundance of 24 hour pho joints. From Garden Grove/Westminster to the streets of Ktown so I'm not like wtf to 24 hr pho shops. I am always curious of how often they clean out their soup base though.

I usually go to my regular joints on Spring Mountain but this time I wanted to try something different so I stopped by Pho Little Saigon before heading out on the road back to LA. Give it a shot, why not?

I agree with some of the reviewers, lack of staff. The place isn't THAT big but if it gets busy then what? My experience with pho places are that if they're really good, then the staff is plentiful and the food comes out faster than McDonald's because they want you in/out of their place so they can make room for the next customers. 

My pho was decent. There was plenty of meat and noodles so they weren't tight on that for sure. You don't get your own plate of veggies though. Three people in my party ordered pho and we only received one plate of the bean sprouts, lemon, & basil leaves. Most pho restaurants will give you one plate per pho bowl, not here. The spring roll was mediocre, actually don't even bother. No extra veggies for you there either.

Next time, I'll probably play it safe and return to my other usual pho restaurants.

CASH ONLY."}
{"text":"Horrible experience , Servers were unprofessional and rude ! Saw a cockroach on my first visit ! Place needs a cleaning and new servers that actually look like they enjoy what theyre doing ! Btw no straws ? Had to drink out of the cup smh ! Horrible."}
{"text":"I like this place a lot.

Very large portions of Pho for $8. Pho comes out steaming hot and the broth is incredibly warm, hearty, and delicious. I always go with my usual which is Pho with brisket only...Mmm!

I've had the fried egg rolls here too which you can never go wrong with.

Fast service and a hearty bowl of Pho. This is one of the closest Pho restaurants I live by and I've only discovered it a few months ago. I usually go to Pho Saigon 8 which is across the street from Pho Little Saigon... Decided to venture out and try somewhere new and I've been here about 4-6 times ever since!"}
{"text":"I was in Chinatown area and was so  hungry and thought this would be a good place to try out another Vietnamese cuisine.
The building look pretty clean from the outside its location in a strip mall.
There were only two waiters working in this huge place when I went in \"clue #1\" it was like lunch time here and there was only one couple eating here \"clue #2\".
I ordered  a  Vietnamese Ice Coffee which is my favorite ice coffee about a few mins. later my waiter brought out my coffee in a styroform  cup I ask him what happen the tradition way Vietnamese have this coffee made, he stated to me that people were complaining it took too long \"clue # 3\" I should have got up and left.
I order a bowl of chicken Pho and fried dumpling the food was pretty much average plus nothing really fancy here.
As I was eating one of the waiter decided to blow his nose in the  restaurant he did turn to face the wall but I could still see and hear him, when he was done he thought his Kleenex in a trash can in the restaurant went sat back down without washing his hands \"clue # 4\"
This place has 390 reviews on Yelp with 2 1/2 stars, so my experience here was not that great."}
{"text":"I order a sandwich and it's have no paste or mayo on it.. Obviously it very dried, i wonder do they eat there sandwich like that. No tasty at all... A friend of my order the soup pho and it's doesn't have the beefy flavor to it, it was just mainly salty flavors. I was very disappointed at my sandwiches. 
Oh and the wait was kind of long too when there only four table of people."}
{"text":"What the heck is an \"appertizer\"?  (see their menu)

Anywho, since there wasn't anything good I found about this restaurant, let's get to the bad.  

I guess saying \"NO TRIPE PLEASE\" twice cancels out the first time you said it because when I got my pho, there was tripe in it.  Also, the fact that the waiters and staff practically glare at you the whole time you're eating your meal gives you some weird feeling like you shouldn't even be in there in the first place.  Or maybe that weird feeling was just the bland food telling me that I chose the wrong pho spot?  Either way, you can best believe I ain't ever showing up here again.

Besides all of that horribadness, they overcharged us by a few bucks!  Scoundrels!"}
{"text":"Pho Little Saigon has very good pho. After eating all-you-can-eat buffet, a bowl of pho really hits the spot. They also have a dish where you grill your own food (shrimp, squid, beef, etc.)--very tasty. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The is probably one the worst places to eat.  

As i walked into this place I assumed it was going to be a good resturant to eat at.  The resturant was big and clean.  

My family of 4 ordered 3 Pho Dac Biet and one Bun Chao Tom (grilled shimp past with noodles).  When our Pho came out it was warm.  It wasn't hot enough to cook the raw meat then put on top of pho.   The worst part of the meal was when the Bun Chao Tom.   As we were slicing into the meat we discovery that it was still cold.  We were completely disgusted at this point.  We paid and left.  We will never return to this place again."}
{"text":"STILL HORRIBLE! Maybe you feel that your life is just lasting too long. Or perhaps you're a masochist that enjoys eating truly terrifying food. Or maybe you're used to eating from a dumpster, but just feel like taking a chance dining on some extra-rancid cuisine today? Have I got a place for you! 

I didn't know this until I researched, but they have been closed down by the health department a whopping 7 times! for a \"Multi-generational cockroach infestation\" among other things!!!

This dirty, nasty, unsanitary toilet of a restaurant should've been out of business long ago. The employees are despicable. They touch money, trash and more...all without washing their hands. 

I didn't know this until I researched, but they have been closed down by the health dept. a whopping 7 times! \"Multi-generational cockroach infestation\" anyone?

They served me a sour, rotten Diet Coke that expired more than 2 years ago. After I almost vomited, I told them it was long expired and bitter. They brought me ANOTHER one. I refused it. I told them how disgusting it was and all they said was \"Okay. I don't charge you for it.\" REALLY? No apology....nothing. My friend was sick for 2 days after eating his meal. These fucking people have no clue what they're doing in this place. Piss poor pathetic service, dirty bowls, dirty utensils, horrible food, dirty tables and floors. Everyone who works there is a rude fucker. I think they require it to work there.

Also, they rejected my credit card. \"Cash only! Cash only!\" they barked at me. Yes, no credit cards accepted. We were overcharged several times, but they never offered an itemized check, so they totally got away with it. This is third world dining at it's absolute saddest. Fuck this fucking shit restaurant. Run Forrest, RUN!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Food is OK compare to what I normally can get in CA. The staff here are very impolite. Considering I do speak Vietnamese, some of the things the here say are very inappropriate. If you have children that speak the language, don't bring them here."}
{"text":"Regarding Pho, it all seems to taste the same to me (with a few exceptions). I will, however, comment on the bahn mi. My grilled pork was very favorable, and it's a good size amount of meat (for bahn mi). I'll be back, but again, thus was just average"}
{"text":"I was ill in December 2012 and my friend brought me the #33 soup. I don't recall the name nor can I pronounce it if I knew.;) It is the best soup I have ever had. I was surprised by the combination of the ingredients and how they blended together so well. I would have never guess these ingredients mixed together would taste so good! I want more! Yes, the staff did not speak good english but, they clearly understood # 33. lol The only person who was rude was another customer that interupted my (order) conversation at the take out counter while I was placing a order to go. To his surprise, I asked him if he realized he was interupting our conversation, not sure if he understood English either. Anyway, haha, I've got to have # 33 again soon."}
{"text":"mehhhh is right. 

com dia was decent. pork bbq with rice, egg rolls & veggies. it wasn't so bad.

pho was just OK.... broth was extremely watered down and had no flavor. the soup was not piping hot like i am used to. even during hot summer days i will go for a bowl of pho in OC because it is just too good not to have. i love pho and after having pho in OC, ca i can for sure say that this place does not compare. but oh well, we're not familiar with the vegas area so this was our last resort. at least it's open 24 hours..."}
{"text":"Took a chance on this place because Pho 87 was closed.  Bad idea.  A bowl of Pho here costs $8.  Ok this is Vegas and this place is open 24 hours.  Someone is going to have to pay for the overhead costs of keeping this place open around the clock.

Service was fast to take our order and bring the menus/water.  Then things went downhill from there.

I ordered #1 (egg rolls) and they were burnt on the sides.  Ok, I am so hungry, I will eat anything at this point.  One bite and ewwwww.  Why it is sour?  Other people took a bite.  Sour?

Turns out the meat in the egg rolls was spoiled and they still served it!  I can't believe a place that is open 24 hours would pull this stunt.  We are not drunk!  No one in our party drinks.  We can tell what good Vietnamese food is suppose to taste like.  But if the customer can't taste it, why waste it?

The Pho is mediocre at best.  Nothing to brag about.  Do yourself a favor, just keep driving, just keep driving,  Keep driving.

Then they tried to use a BS excuse and claim the egg rolls was not at it's best but still edible.  Not at it's best?  IT'S FRICKEN SOUR and you CAN KILL SOMEONE!

The only plus was that my bro was constipated from eating too much at the buffet.  Not anymore!  Plop, Plop, Fizz, Fizz, oh what a relief it is.

You pay at the end and it's only CASH only!"}
{"text":"Food has always been fresh & they always greet me with a smile. This is a good size restaurant with no frills. It is pretty well known & always seems to have patrons(loyal vegas followers) It has been there for years, same staff & presentation. Never had a bad meal. My Vietnamese friend introduced me to this place so I've tried several dishes, all very well done. Love love their boba tea!!(AvacadO) If you are watching your waist line, they will gladly put in a lower fat creme & less sugar, just ask;) They are very friendly & all are fluent in English."}
{"text":"My family was in a time crunch, and Pho Kim Long had such a ridiculously long wait that we decided to go to Pho Little Saigon instead.

The service was quick and efficient, and we were seated, ordered, and received our bowl of pho(s) in about ten minutes all together. The only downside was that they were swamped, so the waiters kept on forgetting little things here and there; that wasn't a problem though because whenever the waiters passed by, we just reminded them, and they gave us extra [meatballs].

I've been to many pho places, and this is one of the better ones! There's only one size, and it's a little more on the pricey side - about $8/bowl."}
{"text":"Did not expect to be good.....but surprisingly the food is great!!....i loved the pho it was great in taste....i will reccomed this place"}
{"text":"The food is amazing. Literally... EVERYTHING on their menu is good. Prices are fair. Service is bad and sometimes they forget your order because they don't want to write it down. Have to stop here every time I visit LV and that's about 3/4 times a year."}
{"text":"Very disappointed this place. I ordered a to go pho when I got home and I opened it the broth so greasy, a lot of fat floating around and disappointed. When I mixed it up and dig in I felt throw up because  so oily. I didn't  even finished it after I my first bite. Super disgusting broth. This is my first time had this kind a horrible taste. I wont go back anymore. I like the pho in california most bettered taste."}
{"text":"If only no-star rating existed... :-/. despite the reviews, I was optimistic and STARVING post-work in the middle of the night. We walked in and saw one other couple eating, and no one was there to greet or seat us. Finally a worker came out and still he didn't greet or welcome us in a friendly manner... but usually very authentic Asian restaurants can be that way, so that wasn't a huge deal.

After being seated, our waiter stood in front of us watching television... Didn't take our drink order until I asked if they had coconut juice. He said yes and my bf ordered a coke. I was astonished when they brought out a coconut with the wrapping still on it and some kind of sauce smeared on the exterior, and it was only half full... it creeped me out so I didn't drink it, plus they brought out a can of coke, no cup with ice.

I was still hopeful that the food would make up for the odd service... so I ordered the Vietnamese udon with pork and shrimp and my bf ordered the fish porridge. I was overwhelmed with disappointment when they brought over my bowl and I smelled a very unappetizing scent .. I have a very keen sense of taste and smell and something was clearly wrong with the dish.. Whether the pork was going bad or the shrimp.. I couldn't figure it out. I tried squeezing some lime into it and adding hot sauce but that scent wouldn't leave the dish no matter what I did. My bf's dish was too sweet for porridge and the fish was undercooked, plus... It seemed as though the fish wasn't fresh. I took a bite and had to spit it out :(

I think it's time for this restaurant to do some serious evaluating .. service-0, food-1, pricing-2... for its own survival. 

Worst part was that no one even checked on us the entire time so they couldn't even tell if we were having a good or miserable experience. They gestured for us to pay at cashier without even coming to the table or looking at us directly.. Rude! Needless to say, we went up, paid the $24, left a tip, and decided never to go there again.."}
{"text":"Great customer service but the pho was horrible, bad tasting meats, rare beef was nasty, brisket was decent at best, and broth was tasteless would not recommend"}
{"text":"Yelp 100 Challenge 15' * 6/100 

The only reason my mom and I came here was because it was the only place open at the time of night we went. It looked promising from the outside and had a very visible 24 hour open sign. We told ourselves we were feeling adventurous anyway. 

Looking back, I wish we turned around and never looked back. I always stress how I personally try to refrain from harsh criticism on my first visit but the impression a restaurant makes is not entirely due to circumstances. And I'm talking hygiene. Sure, assuming it was late at night, they might have been understaffed but those bathrooms were pretty filthy. Too bad we already ordered.

The food was OK. I couldn't say it made up for the sight in the bathrooms. Broth was not as tasteful as other Pho places I've tried. The egg rolls were just fine. Prices were quite high though and I understand they to make up for the energy and labor used during the night shifts. Then again, nothing delivered. The waiters looked groggy and unwilling to take further requests. Glad to have experienced it already and not need to go back."}
{"text":"Eh don't think I'm come here again ... Industrials when it comes to customizing options al I wanted was beef and shrimp lo mein..."}
{"text":"The food at Pho Little Saigon was excellent and taste very good. The only thing that was lacking in that place was the customer service. We have to ask for more water. They gave my daughter a plate of food and they were rude about it. They gave my wife the plate of food and told her to \" move the damn menu because it will be in the way\" when my daughter been trying to get his attention to tell him that it's her plate. After he set the plate down he just walk away. My daughter is just left with a plate of food with no utensils or sauce to eat. She tried to get their attention for 5 mins until another guy finally came and gave her utensils and sauce for her food. 

Other than that, the place is pretty decent and have really good food and the price is reasonable. It's just that they need to improve on their customer services."}
{"text":"Honestly this place has terrific food and you get the food to you within an extremely fast time.  It's not the most friendliest place to come so if your looking for a place where you can have a fun conversation with the server then you should try elsewhere. It's always very quiet since not too many people seem to come here. If there food wasn't as great as it is then I wouldn't come back, but it is."}

It tasted like a salt water.
Food came late.
We had to wait for 30 mins for pho that usually take like 10 mins."}

Different pho restaurants are different , and we see what this one is like .

The Honey dew boba is THE BOMB , the honey dew I ordered at another location was not good as this one . Mmmmmm! 


Ok , I must say that the brisket here is sooooo awesome !!!!"}

{"text":"BEWARE of FRUAD when they bill. 

I have eaten there 3 times, first 2 times after a night of extensive drinking were horrible. So I chalked up out terrible service, messed up orders and a attempted shady double billing on us being drunk or communication issues being like 3am. But last weekend we can in sober on a Sunday afternoon and of course not a surprise that it was terrible, service and shady billing. All three times the our orders never came correct and one was ordered by the # on the menu. Service is absolutely horrible even if you speak Vietnamese. The nouc bo is decent that is a shame as I am a pho snob. But the worst part is again they tried to over bill be by 58.00. I asked for the bill and they only told me the total 139.00 for 6 people I asked for the receipt and they reluctantly gave it to me. I asked about the 58.00 add line for extra meat. They called the waiter and he tried to fix it said the bill was 67.00 so I said ok them the other guys said no 71. They also added 15% gratuity on 6 person party... ok sure but they also pointed at the tip line when I paid by card and I said please you already billed me 15% and you do not deserve that tip at all.     

Will not ever go there again =("}
{"text":"The service here is unacceptable. The waiter insisted that we could not get meat-less spring rolls, meaning that they were pre-made and not fresh. The noodles were also flavorless and lukewarm. We also ordered thai tea, which was fine, except that the server forgot to give us a boba straw. Overall, shabby service and flavorless food."}
{"text":"I really do like the Pho here.  Being gluten free, I love to find cheap, good food I can eat.

The big downer for eating here is the waitstaff that doesn't speak English, and has a way of telling you off when they misunderstand you.  I'm very polite, so it's a bit of a surprise when I get my head bitten off when I try to order spring rolls... which didn't come, but they magically showed up on my bill.  WTF?

Cash only."}
{"text":"This has always been the go-to place for me and my family every time we come to Vegas. We've always liked this place, but now, we're not so sure anymore. 

The food here has been good and we've always preferred the food here compared to Pho Kim Long in the next plaza. But now we're unsure about returning because of our recent experience with the service.

We came here with a rather large party over Labor Day Weekend. We sat down, and 10-15 minutes goes by as no one came by to take our order. We had to raise our hand to get one of the server's attention to come over. When the server came over to take our order, he was very rude. Any special requests we had, he would be like \"we don't have that here\" in the meanest tone. He wasn't happy nor was he trying to be. He took our orders and picked up the menus from our table with the biggest attitude. 20 minutes goes by as we began to wonder where's our food. Granted it was somewhat busy, but man, still. As a matter of fact, that was when one of the other servers came by and was like \"did someone take your orders already?\" Dude, if we waited that long for YOU to notice us to take our order, you might as well would have lost us as customers already. Anyway, our food started to come out one by one as the last 3 dishes came out long after everyone got their food. I was not amused with the way they were delivering us our food. They brought out a wrong order and handled it very unprofessionally. They came out with the dish and announced \"com ga.\" We responded and said \"no one from our table got com ga.\" That server then got frustrated and YELLED across the restaurant and asked \"who took the orders for this table?!\" then went on and passed it off to that server. I didn't appreciate the yelling nor the frustration. That server then came by, picked up the dish, asked the same question, and got frustrated and left. We thought maybe they got the wrong table and that my mom's dish was still on the way. 5 minutes goes by, my mom's food was still missing. At this point, we tagged down another server and said \"excuse us, we're still missing a com thit nuong.\" That server then went to the back and took care of that order. My mom's food came out when everyone was literally almost done with their food. At this point, I would have at least expected them to say \"sorry for the trouble\" and done something about it. But nope. My dad then noticed that no one received soup with their rice (cause a bowl of soup normally comes with the rice) and asked our original server about it. The server responded with \"we don't serve a bowl of soup with rice here.\" My internal response was literally \"What?? You don't?? You always have before.\" At this point, I felt like he didn't really care or bother cause well, it didn't seem like he really cared or bothered in the first place. Or at least he would have either tried to explain or at least tried to make it work, right?

My family and I normally come here and this time, we brought more family with us. But obviously the experience was so unpleasant that we will now probably think twice before returning again. Fix your service. It matters."}
{"text":"This is a pretty good pho place in the area. The setting wasn't very nice but the food was good. I had the rare steak pho and the portions were huge! The shrimp and beef spring rolls were also pretty good. I'd go back for the food, but I do wish i setting was a little more pleasant. It just looks a bit run down."}
{"text":"I like this little place! I've been coming here for over two years... I used to come here by myself all the time because my partner was not a believer in pho. But after he lost a bet to me, I forced him to go and now he's just as into it as I am. The broth is rich and the serving sizes are huge. The regular not enough? Try the extra large bowl of pho that is not listed on the menu for a couple dollars more. If you are looking for great service, cheap prices, and delicious food then this place is for you!"}
{"text":"Pho is $2+ more expensive than OC. C- for service even though the food came out in a decent amount of time. My pho ga was bland 2/5. Hey at least I didn't get any food poisoning...knock on wood."}

{"text":"I usually go to Pho Saigon 8 for Pho, but it was almost midnight when I got to Vegas and Pho Saigon 8 was closed.  Remembered reading a review on this place, I thought I'd give it a try.  

I ordered the combination Pho with all the trimmings and I didn't like it at all!  The broth was only lukewarm but what made me sick was that it smelled and tasted gamy.  I had ordered a small bowl.  As hungry as I was, I barely finished 1/2 of it and just gave up.  It left such bad taste (and memory) in my mouth that I didn't want Pho during the rest of my stay!  And let me tell you, I am a Pho-natic and I can eat Pho everyday!

The service was not bad as the other reviewers described.  In fact it was rather friendly.  We were served water and menu right away as we sat down.  But perhaps it was because we were one of the only 3 tables of customers there at the time.  

I will be better prepared next time and find another place to go to if I know I am going to arrive late to Vegas again."}
{"text":"The reviews does not lie... horrible service, unfriendly atmosphere and to top it off, even worse pho! The pho restaurant across the street was much better! Hopefully their other dishes is better than the pho..."}

Server was short but polite-no frills and to the point."}
{"text":"Ordered pho and sandwiches togo. Everything was packed very well, but if you need any sauces you have to get it yourself. Jut grab a sauce container by the entrance haha. We were so hungry after EDC so it tasted pretty good & we all had left over pho! ~toooons of soup ;eft ^____^"}
{"text":"While it's not my favorite Pho place in town, it is open 24 hours, which is pretty awesome.  The Pho is okay, but nothing special.  The broth is actually rather flavorful, but the ingredients they give you to put in the pho were not as good as I'd hoped.  The basil was a little wilted, the greens weren't very aromatic, and the beef was tough.  The spring rolls were pretty standard, but definitely worth ordering, and the roasted chicken was pretty good, too.  

Nothing at Pho Little Saigon was extremely impressive, but it was good enough to come back, especially if it's open 24 hours.  If you want the best Pho in town, this is not where to go.  But if you wake up in the middle of the night with a huge craving for Pho, this place will definitely more than satisfy your hunger."}
{"text":"I ususally don't give bad reviews, I tend to only give reviews on places I think are good. 

My boyfriend and I came upon this place because our usual Pho place was packed. We were open to trying a new place, and came in without giving any thoughts to the negative reviews because we understand that some restaurants have good and bad days.

Unfortunately, that was not the case in this experience. I would say the food was decent, but not memorable. But the food isn't the reason I am giving this restaurant only one star...

My boyfriend is a fluent vietnamese speaker, but when he is with me, he speaks english. When we were finished we paid the bill, but the man at the register didn't give us any receipt. Since he was in Vegas for a work trip, he needs the receipts for reimbursement. All in all, the man at the register got angry and started talking crap about us in Vietnamese... He was very rude and deliberately took his time to give it to us. My bf kept his cool and went up to explain why he needed the receipt in Vietnamese, and the owner turned beet red because he didn't think he was able to understand him. 

All in all, we will NEVER come back. I hope the owner learned his lesson to not talk smack in front of his customers."}
{"text":"Came here with a large group of friends. Food was already not good at all. My fiancé was half way through his noodles, and he tasted somethings weird and spit it out, and there was a cockroach ! 

We told the waiters and all they did was take the bowl really fast . All they offered to do was give us another bowl. Why would we want another bowl after we just seen a cockroach . My daughter was sharing noodles with her dad out of the same bowl which is what made me furious. 

All they said was mistakes happens. I will never come back here again ."}
{"text":"Nice place, pho is delicious and always consistent. Had the #76 udon pork and shrimp,  would have liked more pork but the serving size made up for it. Overall recommend. The friend was above average."}
{"text":"By far the best tasting Pho I've yet to find in Vegas. Priced right where it should be, delivered to your table hot, fresh, and quickly. 

There are many reviews on here that are jacked. 

The place is huge, lots of tables. All those complaining about it being small and cramped were in a different place. 

The staff wasn't warm or friendly, but they were efficient and courteous. Nothing resembling rude. Those people may have been in a different place, too. 

My seafood soup was incredible! Huge portion, lots of goodies in it, enough for two meals. I also got fresh coconut water, right out of the coconut. Yum! The soup broth was so good that I wanted to come back the next day for more. Those complaining about it being salty were in a different place. I don't like salty. This was perfect. 

The floors and tables were clean. Bathroom needs some help, but wasn't dirty. Still, no bugs or rats or Health Department warnings. Don't know what place that was. 

My only major complaint is the cash-only situation. Who carries cash? I'll be honest, that is the single reason I hadn't eaten there before, and the one that prevents me from coming back more often, because getting cash is a pain in the neck. Yes, they have a cash machine right there in the restaurant, but the fees from the machine and then your bank end up costing more than your meal.

Still, when I want superior Pho, they are worth the drive."}
{"text":"For their Henderson location, I like not having to drive over to Spring Mountain for Vietnamese cuisine and the range of offerings on the menu is extensive.  They do a great job on vegetables and the sandwiches are terrific.  Others in the area seem to specialize in pho (noodle soup), but I enjoy those banh mi!  Enjoy"}
{"text":"Made a pit stop in Vegas in my way to LA with parents.

It always difficult to pick a restaurant when you're new to the area. I invoked the rule, if there are a lot of customers, there's a good chance it will be a good place. The down fall with that idea is that the waiting line is long and hanger will be quickly. 

Plan B: a semi full restaurant.

Ordered the stir fry water crest with garlic, braised catfish in clay pot and tofu soup.

The water crest with garlic was the star of the night. The garlic, salty and texture of the water crest was on point. It's exactly how I and my family had done it thousands of time. 

Braised catfish: average at best mainly because they rushed the process and the flavors didn't had time to permeate into the catfish. The sauce that the catfish was braised in was overwhelmed by fish sauce and thick soy sauce to get that fake color. The fish itself was too soggy.

Tofu soup: it good and healthy, nothing special."}
{"text":"When I first entered Pho Little Saigon it had the typical Vietnamese feel. I was impressed to see a sign that said open 24hours. I was  here on a date. Sadly ?I have lived here a year and  this was my first time trying anywhere in China Town. YES! I know I was really lagging on that one. I moved to Vegas from the Silicon Valley where we had tons and tons of delicious Asian Cuisine especially PHO. Having been a guest at many Vietnamese restaurants I know that good service isn't typically their strong suit. Surprisingly Pho Little Saigon kept my water full and had a friendly server apologizing for any wait I had. Now that was really shocking but I wonder if he didn't over hear me tell my date I had to take photos before we ate any of our food LOL. Regardless it was a Decent experience. Definitely not the BEST ever but the food tasted good and didnt give me a MSG coma. It also was HUGE portions which I obviously can never eat so I wish they offered the option of a smaller size but overall they have good variety and yummy EATS!"}
{"text":"This place was OK for a freezing Vegas night. The food was just okay -- edible without being overly impressive.

My bun rieu had good flavor although the broth wasn't rich enough. Hubby's mi ga was also okay. Lil guy's bo luc lac was also mediocre. Like I said, everything was just so-so.

Service was what you'd expect even though I spoke Chinese to the guy. If you're looking for something other than food on the strip, this is a good alternative. It's not bad, but it won't blow you away.

Cash Only."}
{"text":"Pho little is very good, but we always have to ask the receipt before u pay. Last time i went there with 5 people for lunch. I asked for the receipt then she said $83. I said i need to see the receipt n finally the receipt was $53 only. This was a suck cheating on custumers."}
{"text":"This place is SO GROSS!!!  Just google the name and you will see they have been shut down 4 Times by the health department.   They wash their pots and pans out front of the restaurant in the parking lot. 

JUST STAY WAY!  So many better places just up the street."}
{"text":"Stay away.  That's all I can really say.  My mistake was not reading all the other yelp reviews before trying this place, otherwise I would have just said no.

Looks can be deceiving and this place is pretty busy with large parties taking over the tables.  Not only is there a regular menu, but if you look around, you'll see pictures with numbers posted on the wall.  Good luck trying to find out what they are because they are listed on the menu and there's no pricing.  When we asked a waitress about a particular picture on the wall, all she could really say about it was that it was fish.  (Uh, we could tell that it was fish, we wanted to know what kind of sauce or how it was cooked!)

In the beginning, the wait staff was on us to order but since we were taking so long, it's as if we were forgotten.  (How could they miss us with their bright yellow menus still in front of us?)

After passing on their expensive pho ($6.99 to $7.99), I chose the Com Ga Hai Nam (Hai Nam style chicken with seasoned rice) for $8.99.  Initially, I had seen an entrée version of this dish and was going to inquire about it, but since I wanted the seasoned rice, I chose to go with this option.  The Big F is a big fan of Com Bo Kho (Beef stew with steamed rice) for $7.99, but usually sees it served with a French roll instead of rice.  

As we waited for our food to arrive, the wait staff at a nearby table was attracting my attention.  Although I couldn't hear what they were saying, their actions were speaking louder than their words.  They were talking about clearing a table and apparently the previous diners left their barely touched strawberry shake on the table.  I'm not sure what the busboy did with that shake, but he sure didn't toss it into the garbage right away like he should have.  What really bothered us was the plate of pho garnishes that were returned to the kitchen for further use.  (How do I know he did that?  Well, he had a cleaning cart with a garbage can attached to it and he dumped all the other garbage in there.  But he made a point of taking that plate of garnishes and bringing it back to the kitchen.  That looks suspicious to me.)

When my plate of Hainamese chicken arrived, it looked awful.  (Check the photos out for yourself!)  First off, it looked like leftover chicken all thrown on a plate and covered with scallions, ginger, and cilantro so I couldn't see the banged up chicken underneath.  And there was no skin left on my chicken!  Part of the dish is the tasty skin, and it looked like they gave me the healthy version!  Once I got past how little chicken I got, I noticed something else was wrong.  Uh, where is my seasoned rice?  There's a huge ball of white steamed rice on my plate and the seasoned rice is half the dish!  When I asked the waiter about it, he said they ran out of the seasoned rice.  When I explained that was why I ordered the dish, he went to the back to the kitchen.  He came back reaffirming that they did indeed run out of seasoned rice and he would give me a discount on the dish.  I was hungry, so I ate what I had in front of me.  It was far from special.

The Big F's beef stew was just okay, and he's had a lot of the stew in other places.  He was initially turned off because it didn't have the same color that he was used to.  He pointed out that there was a lot of MSG in it too.  I also saw him pour soy sauce in it, so I knew that it was not hitting his taste buds.

When we went up to pay, I noticed they didn't give me any discount.  I had to ask the waiter about it, and he took $2 off the total bill.  (At least he did that!)

In the end, bad food with average service and suspicious kitchen practices.  Although they offered a few unique family dinner options, you won't see us walking through these doors again any time soon.  Keep on driving, there are plenty of other better Vietnamese restaurants along Spring Mountain.

Cash only.

Update: After posting this review, someone contacted me saying their wife worked here part-time.  He mentioned that they do not resell the smoothies, but they do reuse the pho condiments since they are a bit expensive.  The last I checked, bean sprouts and limes were not expensive."}
{"text":"i think its one of the better pho that i have tried. the soup is not sweet like some i have tried in CA, and the prices are very good. my sister and i shared the combo xl bowl and the spring rolls and had with tips only spent 18. i can't wait to go there and have it again. and i am going to try one of the bubble teas that they have with over 10 different flavors one of which is dorian and taro"}
{"text":"ok been here tuns of times and now finally writing a review, i have been to many places in vegas and for me this is the best place by far. love the Pho and also all the other dishes"}
{"text":"The staff are extremely rude to customers and the service is so bad. The Lady got angry to my group although we did not nothing wrong
I request the bill on the front desk and wait for a long time, but all staff look at me and do something esle like I am invisible
 I donot recommend this restaurant"}
{"text":"Eh, Pho Little Saigon was just a fling. We went here because we were hungry and it was the first thing we saw.

The inside is massive, we got there just before the rush. All the tables in the middle soon filled up with large families/groups having Saturday brunch.

My fiancee and I ordered a bowl of chicken porridge and their fresh spring rolls. Both very mediocre. I had to add tons of lime, and a spoonful of fish sauce, to the porridge in order to get some flavor out of it. The portions are VERY large, especially for the price, so I can see where there were a lot of people coming in.

We'll probably try other pho restaurants before we come here again, though..."}
{"text":"Not the best, but not the worst. It's a typical phó restaurant you'd find in other large cities. This place is open 24 hours and there wasn't a long wait for seating. However, they need to level up from their current \"cash only\" policy. (My friends and I walked to this place from Bally's casino at 4am! Bahaha!!)"}
{"text":"Broth was favorable and good;  but that was it.  Ordered vermicelli noodles with pork and the noodles were cooked and soft; soupy.  Never had that in my life and my family is Vietnamese.  Meat was the cheapest cut...just not overall a great experience, go to another one"}
{"text":"Alright so we were hella curious seeing a 24 spot AND it had a good crowd. 

Went in and got some mixed meat pho and some pork and eggroll rice plate. 

The pho was alright...there was just something missing in the broth flavoring....more sweet, but didn't have that spice and depth the perfect broth should bring forth. Toppings were good, but a bit skimpy compared to some neighboring pho shops. 

The rice plate has quite a bit of meat and like 3 eggrolls. It was pretty good. Not bad. 

Verdict- skip the soups and maybe do some broken rice if this is our eating option but just some of the reviews make me wary to come back specially since there are other options. 

I just read Teri C. review though and it makes me iffy....she's my homegirl Yelper so I trust her. I did not notice they reuse the veggie....okay yeah someones mouth (presumably) hasnt been on it, but for sure someones hands have picked up some sprouts and I don't know where that hand has been. You know I see people not wash their hands in bathrooms that I care to see. It happens a lot and that's not what I want on my soup. I just came from the market and bean sprouts were like 50cents for a huge bag....it's not an expensive produce. 

I also observed after sitting there long- the big late night crowd were club people and not sober casino workers like us. Makes a big difference.

I think I pass on this place."}
{"text":"This wasn't my first choice for pho but since there were a few close to Silverado ranch where we were we decided not to drive all the way to Chinatown. Since a pho place close to here was on dirty dining,this place was the obvious choice. Bad choice. The service was alright but I guess it's the standard with Vietnamese Restaurants. Not the best but not the worst. The pho here was absolutely the worst I've ever had. I'm no snob but this broth was the weakest I've ever had and I've had few bowls of pho that were this bad. Totally underwhelming and boring. No flavor at all. The pho little Saigon in Chinatown which is the least of my favorites in Chinatown because the device is the worst has 10x better bowl of pho. Slowly crossing off my Pho places to try and I'm glad to say I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Originally set to go some place else, my aunt and company wound up here due to driving miscommunications LOL. Had I known they wanted Pho, I could've checked Yelp and laid options on the table. When I got the text of the meeting place I immediately looked it up and was flabbergasted when I saw the low 2.5 stars. Oh well, I vowed to be more adventurous this year didn't I?

When I got there it was packed! Hmmm so maybe this place isn't so bad after all? My family had already ordered and was half way thru their meal when I sat down, they said the service was really fast so they waited to put in my order until I got there so my food wouldn't get cold. So why the 2 star review? 

I first ordered egg rolls, it was delivered less than 5 minutes I kid you not. Wooah that was lightning fast! It was hot, crisp and a little well done. Standard egg roll taste, it did its job. I opted to get the rare beef pho for myself and the grilled pork chop for my son. The pork chop had great taste but it could've used a couple more minutes on the grill, very little charring or burnt edges which I like. That was the extent of my favorable experience as immediately after that everything went downhill. They took at least 30 minutes to finally deliver my soup, we've had to ask them several times. We knew it either had to be forgotten or missed cause my aunt said they got their soup delivered within 10 minutes. The Thai tea took about 5 or 6 requests before it got to my hands and the vegetables for the Pho was another mishap. Now I do understand things could be skipped cause it was seriously a mad house in there but no one could give an explanation on what was happening and definitely no apologies were offered. All they kept telling us was \"it's coming\" yet everyone around me that came after was already served. 

All in all the food wasn't bad, honestly I expected worst due to the low ratings but I don't see myself coming back at all. There are so many great Pho places in town, why would you settle for less. There's just way too much things going on here that most times things get missed or forgotten. Just by observing the employees, it didn't look like they had a system in place, it was pure chaos. Also, we were informed by a family member how nasty the bathroom was, I didn't want to imagine how the kitchen must be, away from the scrutinizing eyes of the patrons *shudders*"}
{"text":"Wow, the Bun Bo Hue is on point. The broth is good and it's still hot until the end. Last but not least, the brisket is tender.  I'd recommend this place."}
{"text":"This is an updated review. When they were 24 hour, this place was passable. Unfortunately, the new owners seem not to care about the after bar rush, since they were closed at 2am. Bad food late at night is one thing, but I would never choose this place during normal restaurant hours. There are probably 10+ pho restaurants within a 5 minute drive that are not only better quality, but also haven't wound up on the dirty dining list. Here's hoping they can find a way to rise above the competition, because they are my last pick during normal hours, and I am sure others feel the same way."}
{"text":"Love this place .... it is a place where customers are treated like they are getting free handouts ... came in a group of 16 ... first one ate and also took a nap at the table while many others still didn't have their orders.  The only thing this restaurant is fast is when they get your money ... btw...my nephew said my review is too long ... he was there too .... and he just summed it up in one word .... the place is SUCK ! And I agreed !"}
{"text":"I don't really understand why they have 3.5 stars cause this place is delicious! They have friendly staff and great food. Only thing I would say is that their water has a weird taste, but that isn't enough for me to take a star off."}
{"text":"Good option for those who don't feel like eating on the strip. This is actually the only Vietnamese restaurant I've tried in Chinatown and its satisfactory. The food is extremely fast which is a good thing, but the food isn't the best I've had. It's still pretty good, but I'm definitely down to try another Vietnamese restaurant next time. However, it is way better than paying $14 for eggs and bacon in your hotel."}
{"text":"If I can give negative star on rating, sure I will do that. Bad services, waiters/waitress just group together chi-chat and play glambling, and rarely response customer's order. We order special Pho, $9 for a small bowl, and we taste the soup had a lot of MSG!!! no beef taste, the worst pho I ever ate. Their only advantage is open 24 hours."}
{"text":"Watch out for DOUBLE TIPS. They already CHARGED TIPS to the bill & don't give you Receipts....Make sure you asked first before leaving CASH TIPS on the table OR give ADDITIONAL TIPS on credit card."}
{"text":"Giving my review before the good gets here. 

Was fairly packed and this place was buzzing. This is usually a good sign

Took about 10 min to have anyone take our order. It's been close to 30 minutes and the 8 at our table have only gotten 2 dishes. Rice and vermicelli. 

Pho finally got here but still short a couple dishes. 

Don't come here hungry or expecting to be noticed. Other good sized groups who arrived after us even got their food before us. Consistency in service is lacking

Tough to give x1 star. Pho is pretty decent but not so good to have a place as busy as this."}
{"text":"Horrible, horrible service, I can't even emphasize it enough. We were a group of 13 and we didn't have to wait, which I was surprised. What irked me, then annoyed me, then really made me mad was how the waiters talked to us and the other customers. They rush you to order in the most rudest way, saying things like, \"hurry up.\" Really, bro? I ordered two appetizers while everyone else ordered a bowl or plate. How is it that my order came out last when I ordered two spring rolls and pot stickers (this was a 45 minutes wait for this order). I had to repeat three times to the same waiter what I ordered, reminded him of the potstickers since he only repeated the spring rolls order, then he said, \"oh, you should probably forget about it. I don't know what's the situation with those.\" I told him, \"then you better make sure it's not on the receipt later.\" 

If a zero star rating exist, then this place deserves a million zero star rating."}
{"text":"This is definitely our go to place 2-3 times a week for pho. I've tried other places,  and none can compare. Huge portions,  great prices,  and open 24-7, what else could you ask for? I took my mom,  and she said that the pork fried rice was hands down the best she's had.  As for the demerit situation. .. It was kind of a perfect storm of a situation, with a pipe breaking, and food storage issues because they were in the middle of selling their other location and moving stuff over,  according to the staff we talked to after they re opened.   As often as I've been there,  I've never had the issues that others have spoken of with insects,  etc. The staff is friendly when you engage them. This place is much better than Kim Long, which used to be good,  but is now over priced and not as good anymore.  Avoid the crowds at Kim Long, and come here instead!"}
{"text":"I wish there is zero star!

The Waiter was very rude. He seated the parties behind us first. When complained, instead of resolving the issue, he threw away the menu and yelled at us. I wished we walked out, but we had kids and all of us were starving, so we just went inside. Didn't even give us water or tea.

They also charged us 15% tips without our knowledge, which we found out later.

It's surprising that they still  EXPECT US TO TIP 15% after how they treated us !!!"}
{"text":"Horrible service! These people have no idea how customer service skills work.  You acknowledge your customers.  You do not spill water on your customers and laugh about it.  You should not be be rude to your customer trying to ask for a menu.  

There were people that left after sitting there 30 menus without being offered menus or water.  We wanted to leave but we already invested 45 mins wait time and were too hungry.  I have no idea how this place stays in busy.  Forget this garbage dump. I should of just stuck with the wait at Pho Kim Long instead...no wonder they are #1 in Vegas."}
{"text":"The parking lot looked empty but the minute we walked in the place was pretty full considering its a Sunday morning. The pho I think is much better then Pho Kim Long but it's similar to other places that we have tried. I give them an average, but after a nights out drinking this place would the spot for pho."}
{"text":"If it was possible I'd give them half a star.. just because my Ice Vietnamese coffee w/ condensed milk tasted ok and my friend's taro tapioca drink was ok.

Where do I begin, there are soo many negatives that I can write a whole page about this place.  First of all, they were rude when taking our order.  We waved at 3 waiters  and each one told us to wait a minute.  Finally, a girl w/ glasses comes over and takes our order but in the middle of it she runs into the kitchen and does not come back until about a minute later.  RUDE!!

There are pictures of the food on the wall w/ #s next to them.  You would think that it corresponds to the # on the menu but NOPE.. its not even numbered the same as the menu.

DO NOT ORDER WATERMELON TAPIOCA!  The picture on the wall look like the typical watermelon juice drink one would find at ANY tapioca drink place.  It should be RED... the ones that we got came out looking like blended pepto bismo!!!!  It was PINK... of course we complained and said it doesn't look like anything like that picture.  One guy comes over and said oh its because we use a powder!  So we refused the drink!

We ordered (2) #19 which was like pho tai w/ flanks.  One came out and I was still waiting for mine, so finally we got someone's attention and told him we're still missing another one of this (pointing at the first #19 we got).  They guy was like whats that, so I said #19, OMG-- they go and open the menu to see what it is and then goes to take the one that we have away.  We were like NO what are you doing!  We ordered 2 of this, leave this one and bring another.  

I swear there are a bunch of morons working in this place!!!!  STRONGLY ADVISE PEOPLE TO STAY AWAY!!!   The food is not even good!!!!  Worst Pho EVER!!!!!  Paying at the cashier you can feel how sticky the floor was!!!"}
{"text":"Very rude and not helpful at all. I was looking for a dish with snow peas and he said they don't have it because of holidays and to try pho Kim long.

I explained how I went there and management told me they don't sell snow peas and his response was \"us too\" when on the menu there are about 3-4 options WITH EFFING SNOW PEAS.

I've come here once before and thought id try a second chance but after this and all their health code violations NEVER AGAIN."}
{"text":"I've tried a lot of food here. New manager, new yummy food. Let try Banh Canh Cha Ca. The fish cake of this disk is very delicious. You should try once, it's really tasted well as in Vietnam hometown. And try Com Tam Suon Bi Cha, you will see the special. I love noodles here and the new service. All staffs\" friendly and kind. Rate 5 stars for them because I dont want they will be closed and I wanna come here everyday."}
{"text":"Horrible service!!! Understaffed and water taste like crap, would not come back. Would never recommend this place..."}
{"text":"Came here couple days ago with my best friend for lunch because we noticed one day they had a $5.95 type lunch special. That lunch special comes with an egg drop soup. We also ordered some spring rolls (shrimp only). Those weren't bad. I'd hand more that tasted fresher. We ordered low main and kung pow chicken. The food was alright. Not that much flavor. The kung pow had more water chestnuts more than chicken. Thankfully we upgraded our rice for an extra $1 to fried rice and that was the best part of the meal. You can't really expect much for a $6.95 meal. It's filling and cheap enough for a lunch."}
{"text":"Service sucks here. Had to wait a long time for my food to come out while my friends are enjoying their food. I got a chicken fried rice and it was so bland, chicken taste so fake. Such a disappointment to fried rice lol. Won't be returning here!"}
{"text":"Wow... For starters, this is NOT traditional pho.  There are no sprouts, mint, lime, jalapeños, or ANYTHING on the side.  They do not have a liquor license, and 3 things we asked for on the menu, they said they did not have.  The pork in the spring rolls was comparable to pre- packaged lunch meat, and the seafood was ALL imitation-- even the shrimp.  We left with empty stomachs and am $80 tab... we couldn't force ourselves to eat it."}
{"text":"Maybe too spoiled with pho quality in California but I wasn't feeling the broth here. BUT it did help my unbearable hangover so that was nice."}
{"text":"We ordered 2 smoothies on a tuesday night: watermelon and avocado for 6.50

- watermelon tastes like a STRAWBERRY LAFFY TAFFY! fail. not fresh. GROSS! AVOID!!! uses powder! 
- fresh avocado :). good but a bit bland. 
- smoothie in a styrofoam cup fail. 
- just stick with the food."}
{"text":"Very rude staff. Our waiter even semi-raised his voice at me. I will not be coming back. It was very busy, but even other people who came before me waited half an hour to even get their orders in. There was no check in during our meal or water refilling. They're cash only here, and I can see why other people don't like it here. And for some reason, my pho soup base started to taste like tap water towards the end of the meal. 

I wish they would tell us in advance that their pho already come with cilantro inside, especially for this who hate cilantro like myself."}
{"text":"Boyfriend had a craving for pho so we Googled the nearest joint & came across this place. It was a Friday night...clean, spacious and was seated quickly.  We knew what we wanted but browsed the menus to see what was to offer. I liked that the condiments are filled and were there for us on the table. We enjoyed our food, it definitely hit the spot. Portions are big and the servers continuously came around to fill our waters. 
The servers don't say much but it doesn't bother me, everything else was great. We will be back."}
{"text":"For what it's given, I see this place as an underdog with room for improvement. Don't get me wrong this place isn't bad, it's quite tasty. I ordered the bun thit nuong cha gio and its pretty delicious. The meat was tender and the egg roll was juicy. The service was very interactive and almost felt like I visited Vietnam for a second. Many native speakers in this restaurant and there is a lot of variety on the menu with over 200 options. The food is delicious, but I believe that too many could be overwhelming. Staff was great, the restaurant was quite spacious and I believe that people should come here more often. This is definitely not a 2 1/2 star. P.S. there was a handsome waiter called thanh I think he's single ladies!"}
{"text":"I have to admit I'm puzzled by the negative reviews, and glad I didn't know about them. I find the other 24 hour Pho down the street to have poor service and bland food. Perhaps people are confused? This is not the 24 hour Pho in the shopping center, but on the corner across from the center.

Regardless, I'm in Vegas some 50 days a year, and love exploring the off strip restaurants. I had lemongrass tofu, my friend had pho, we shared salad rolls. We loved our food, chuckled at the slightly aloof service at 4:00am, and my friend still makes random comments to me about how incredibly good it was. 

In his words, spiced and flavored in a way that exploded his taste buds.

I'll be back, and maybe Briget P. is correct -- maybe they've improved.

Or maybe it's a case of mistaken identity.

Or maybe I got lucky..... \"Croupier: $50 on 00!!\""}
{"text":"I keep finding myself coming back here. Hands down best pho in town! The pho broth is seasoned perfectly. The service is great, my pho comes out within 5 minutes of ordering. The waitor/waitress is always super courteous. Come here for a great bowl a pho if your here in the area!"}
{"text":"I couldnt tell u how the food was because we had to walk out! Customer service poor poor poor! We were seated...provided with menus and water....and then forgotten.  People came in after us were seated, their order taken, and served their food...and yet our order was never taken. Will never go back to this place!"}
{"text":"After every Vegas trip, I need a bowl of pho. This time, I didn't feel like waiting to get to Cali, so I gave this place a try.

I ordered Pho Tai and Thai tea. The service was fast, and friendly. I got served in under 10 minutes. My bowl of pho was huge, and they kindly packed it to go for me since I couldn't finish it. My entire order was yummy and satisfying-perfect hangover meal!

This is definitely my go-to pho restaurant in Vegas."}
{"text":"Sad part about these Pho Saigon is not one offers vegetarian option in clear broth Pho. Sad and narrow minded like most Las Vegas/Henderson food establishments. Time to update people!"}
{"text":"Very poor customer service. Only giving them a 2 star because the pho is alright. They do not greet customers or try to make conversation with them. 

When we walk in the door the man look at us and walk away. Then he was at a table waiving at us to go sit down. And look at us like \"what the heck are these people doing standing at at the entrance.\" It would be nice to let us know to follow him or find our own seats. 

Then the waiter walk by our table and we said we're ready to order. He walk right pass us to go to the table by us to take order. When he was done then he came to out table and not say a word. With the pen and pad in his hands we get the signal he's ready to take our order now. When we ask for the small and large bowl of pho. He told us large is not on the menu and it's $2 charge. When. It clearly shows on the menu the price is less than what he mention. Well that was annoying at that point. Told him that false advertisement and he should label the menu correctly so we exactly what to order and what the prices are. He didn't say anything at all and just walk away. How RUDE!!!! Is all I can say. To be honest we weren't even complexly done with our order. But we were hungry so we settle with the 2 bowls and did not order drinks since he decided to just walk away. What we should of done is walk away from him too. 

The worse customer service I've experienced."}
{"text":"The convenience of having pho at anytime is appealing. The serving size is large, but the quality of meat is not the best. The beef was on the tough side and I got a quarter of a meatball. When I saw my plate of veggies, I thought the beansprouts looked lackluster and the mint was not vibrant. After reading some reviews, I can see why.

The server was to the point. I ordered, he refilled my water, and he cashed me out. There was nothing more, but it was good enough for me. When I want some noodles after an early morning workout, it will do. If waiting is an option, then there are other places."}
{"text":"Had potstickers and pho tonight and was VERY PLEASED!  It was my 1st time here & I'm going to be a regular customer. 
The portion size of the potstickers was perfect for my niece & I to share.  The dipping sauce was a light ginger soy & just right. Not salty or bitter or too sweet. 
We had Pho Tau with beef balls and rare beef slices. The broth was rich, lightly seasoned & NOT greasy! Beef balls & slices were tasty as were the rice noodles.  I seasoned with just lime and loved it. 
Portion size is huge & I'll have lunch tomorrow too! 
Prices are reasonable. My niece, the pho snob, loved it. It wasn't busy because we came in about 830 pm but service was timely and friendly. Hopefully our review entices others to try this place."}
{"text":"I love the pho here. My husband and I go one a week. But, the atmosphere is maybe not my favorite but the pho is the one bringing us back!"}
{"text":"Customer service was fair. In comparison to other Vietnamese restaurants, this would be slightly below average. Most of the employees seem unresponsive and terribly bored of their jobs. It has a very weird, unattractive atmosphere. They post pictures of their foods on their walls (and they're number), which were placed NOT IN ORDER. Feels like an old, un-modern, typical Asian restaurant. If you're looking for a Vietnamese restaurant, don't go here. There much better ones nearby."}
{"text":"I definite DON'T recommend this place. My brother rather eat instant noodle than their pho. We ordered 2 pho and 2 types of rice plate with chicken: 

1. The waiters were extremely rude.
2. The chicken of 1 plate was fried on the surface but frozen on the inside
3. The chicken of the 2nd plate was still raw with red flowing out
4. They forgot 2 of our drink orders
5. Wrong order of both pho bowls
6. Beef in pho was not fresh, not the least bit tender 
7. Unsanitary - dirty utensils 
8. Charged 15% tips onto the check without telling you or showing you the receipt (we realized we doubled tip the two times we went before)"}
{"text":"It's a cold 43 degrees outside today, and it's just as cold in the restaurant (I'm not exaggerating), would it kill them to turn on the heat a bit for their customers? 

Ordered their Pho with everything in it, and a side of spring rolls. 

Spring rolls came out and it was right out of the refrigerator cold (as in pre-made). Then the Pho came out with the add in veggie (only sprouts, basil, and 1 lime wedge), bare minimum stuff. The broth was flat with very little flavor. I reached for the sauces and the bottles were dirty, with dried sauce around the spout. And to top it off, after the meal, I was super thirsty (so I'm figuring too much MSG). 

In conclusion, it wasn't a good deal at all, I won't be returning."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and I'm always amazed at how good the broth is. I mean really, that's what pho is all about, right? If you don't have good broth then you just have water and noodles and you have to doctor it up with sriracha and hoisin sauce. At this place you don't have to do that and I regret every time I add sriracha and hoisin. It just doesn't need it. Trust me, try the soup before you add anything to it. 

Today we got the shrimp pho LX size which is nice because we split it with the kids and still had plenty of soup left over for ourselves. Like I said before, the soup is great. The only issue I have is with the shrimp. The shrimp was over cooked. They were very tough. Bummer. Everything else was good. 

The service in this place could be better. We walked in the restaurant and stood there. Some guy who was eating some food pointed to a table. So we went over and sat down. The waiter wasn't the friendliest. To be honest, I don't go to a place like that for the customer service. I go there for the killer pho and I will be going there again."}
{"text":"I am addicted to number 45 (pork chop with rice) Good portions that taste good every visit. Cordial but could be friendlier staff (somewhat cold although respectful) UPDATE: A better word than cold would have been cool, but truth is strictly business attitudes. It's all good."}
{"text":"This used to be our go-to pho place when we were in town.  On this recent visit, we noticed that all the familiar faces were gone.  Unfortunately, I guess all the tasty food left with them.  The pho was marginal at best, with an almost tasteless broth (if you can call it a broth).  Egg rolls were good, and the highlight of the meal.  For good measure, they overcharged us on the bill.  Many pho places don't itemize, so you simply trust them.  I did, and lost.  A post-pho recon revealed a 20% overcharge.  I'm never going back"}
{"text":"We have tried to order different foods at work since we order out everyday and the company pays for lunch we are pretty free to try different things so it was one of the guys brthday's and he wanted Vietnamese food so Little Saigon it was. I had previously never been to any Vietnamese food places in Las Vegas but had frequented a place called BoBo's in Sacramento because they had killer BBQ Pork over rice noodles and spring rolls. 

Guess what was on the menu..... Yep, you guessed it, BBQ Pork. So after ordering the food we waited for it to arrive and sure enough it was fresh and as if we ordered it in the restaraunt; How you ask , well thats simple, someone in this world finally decided that by packaging everything seperate in seperate containers and just letting the person put it together themselves the food is that much more fresh. 2 thumbs up for that idea. 

All of the food was spot on and tasted great, from the BBQ Pork to the Pho. There was nothing on our table that afternoon that was not up to standards."}
{"text":"I've never been ignored at a restaurant until now. Pho Little Saigon, thank you for devirginizing me into the world of horrendous customer service and food. 

My friends and I all had a craving for some authentic Asian food, so we decided to wander away from the strip and into this area of Las Vegas. At first glance, it looked like a promising decision. How wrong we were. 

As soon as we walked into the restaurant, we were promptly seated at tables that still needed to be cleaned. Chairs were soaked with broth from the Pho and spilled condiments littered the table top. We wouldn't have minded if there were some napkins on the table for us to clean it up ourselves, but none were there. And when we tried to wave down the waiter/host/whatever he was to get us a few, he looked directly at our table and ignored our requests. 
 
That should have been our first que to leave. But we decided to give this place the benefit of the doubt. So we put in our orders for water, drinks, and food. Easy enough. 

20 minutes pass. No water. None of our drinks are on our table. And my friend gets her watered down porridge. 

20 more minutes. Still no water. My friend is trying to be polite and wait for us to get our food before she starts eating but we tell her to just go ahead. 

20 minutes later. Water arrives. And my food gets there. 

10 minutes later, the rest of the food gets there. But none of our drinks. 

Food is below average. My brother didn't eat his, and he loves this stuff (even if it is horrible. I've never seen him not finish or even attempt to eat his pho). 

The bill comes. No drinks. Our order of eggrolls also never came out. We tell them about this, and how we don't even want our drinks anymore, but they charge us anyway. So we wait for the drinks. 

They arrive ten minutes after we pay the bill (which still included the order of invisible eggrolls), mixed up, without boba, and sloppy. 

Everyone is better off just hitting a buffet and going to the Asian section if they have a craving for some noodles. 

Pho Little Saigon, never again."}
{"text":"I'm new to the pho scene but I've been to China Town before and like the energy and vibe there.  I visited this restaurant with a friend for a late lunch today (Saturday) when the place was almost empty.  This restaurant has a casual vibe and is open 24 hours a day. I actually liked the decor- it has a natural look, with wood chairs and large wooden blinds in a cafeteria-like open space. I liked the fresh and clean look  - no old, dirty worn out rugs and dusty plastic plants like some restaurants have.  The servers were relaxed and friendly, and brought the food promptly.

Speed and convenience seem to be the words for this place. I liked the stacks of spoons and small bowls and the container of chopsticks on each table- no need to ask for anything. They bring a stack of paper napkins and you're pretty much good to go.  There are at least 5 different sauces available at the table, from sweet hoisin to killer-hot sriracha. 

Before my seafood pho arrived, the server placed on the table a large plate of bean sprouts topped with branches of thai basil leaves- I thought it looked pretty cool.  The pho bowl was HUGE- impossible to eat in one sitting!  I enjoyed it, (gotta say, those squid pieces I could have done without- but that's a personal problem).  We pulled leaves off the branches to put into the pho and happily slurped as much pho as we could eat before a personable server offered to pack up the rest for us to take home.  He agreed that the huge bowls of pho were too much for one sitting, but a great deal budget- wise. I paid $11 for an appetizer and the pho and have enough pho for one or two more meals. I should warn, however, that the noodles get soft and mushy in a few hours. Maybe you should take them out of the broth  if you aren't going to eat your leftovers for a few hours. Just an idea.

So, not a fancy place, but very inviting with decent food. I'd come back and I'd bring friends."}
{"text":"Updated review: still solid. Friendly home style service. It's 24/7 yo. Pho always hits the spot. Banh mi on point. I've got nothing but good things to say."}
{"text":"Here's the deal this place is not that bad...but compared to pho kim long down the street it is...food is not that bad got a big selection... i still like the place down the street better"}
{"text":"This is such a bad place. They waiters were rude and while I was making my order, he told me to stop. What the hell? They made us wait 30 min after they seated us. HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. The food was mediocre, nothing special. It was also ridiculously over priced. Don't come here if you don't have a lot of time to wait because THEY MAKE YOU WAIT."}
{"text":"I came in on a Monday morning and was seated promptly as there were only a few other guests in the restaurant. My family and I were seated and we ordered, then the wait for our food was quite long, as there were only a few other guests. We waited around 15 minutes for our food and everything came out at different times. The food was pretty good and the portions were REALLY BIG. I had bun (vermicelli noodles) and my family had pho. Everything was very filling!"}
{"text":"This guy in black is rude as F$&@.  It makes me think about not coming back here anymore. I come here once in a blue moon and I don't have problems with my service but this guy is just horrible."}
{"text":"Didn't think Pho L.S. was bad at all. We went when it wasn't too busy and they had enough staff. CASH ONLY please.

Clean restaurant, no problems with the crowds and parking at around 4pm on a Sunday afternoon.

Good fried egg rolls and Pho Tam Nam Bo Vien (pho with the beef and beef balls). Friendly staff, good boba. Big bowls for about $7.50-$8.00. Perfect for when you're done with all that buffet and Vegas strip food. 

Open 24 hours.."}
{"text":"Service: the service sucks!!! I tried to call to see what type of seafood the seafood Pho came with and I couldn't understand the man heavy accent, that he told me to drive down and read the menu! I live far!!

It was the only 24hr Pho Resturant. So I drove down there with my Sister and her bf. When we got there they seriously RUSHED us to eat our soup and get out. I will never come back here again!

Food: the food was ok.  the seafood Pho comes with imitation crabs, octopus, fish ball and shrimp. The shrimp wasn't peeled! The veggies weren't so fresh!"}
{"text":"After pigging out at the Wynn buffet for lunch we just wanted something simple and quick for dinner. We came here as it is my mom's preferred pho place in town. It was ok. Summer rolls lacked any mint, the veggie sides were only some bean sprouts, sad looking basil and a few slices of jalepeno.  But then we were in the middle of the desert not SoCal or Hawaii.  The broth was ok and overall just ok."}
{"text":"This is my first pho place to try in Vegas and I must say it was an amazing experience! There was no wait and we got seated right away. We ordered the egg roll, spring roll and I ordered the pho dac biet. Everything came out at a reasonable time. The wait wasn't long at all. The egg roll itself was a five star. It was so delicious I honestly wanted seconds but then I wouldn't be able to eat pho. I'm very picky with my pho and it wasnt bad. It didn't pack any flavor so the broth was good. Overall, service and food was excellent!"}
{"text":"Horrendously underemployed. I arrived with a party of 8, including myself, and we were seated quickly, but we were obviously forgotten as more customers poured in for lunch. We saw three tables get their orders in before the waiter finally noticed us.

After waiting for 45 minutes, they come back and tell us that they've lost our entire order and our waiter even had the audacity to raise his voice at us. Needless to say we won't be back anymore. If Yelp gave me the choice, this place wouldn't be getting any stars from me."}
{"text":"I've only have 2 dishes but I am an absolute fan. Not to mention their hospitality. One of the women is so warming and genuinely friendly, which is a hard find nowadays. I visited for the first time last night & had to come back today. This is my pho spot from here on out. I highly recommend this place. Not too big but definitely cozy. Only bad thing is the traffic on the way here, since it's right in the middle of Eastern."}
{"text":"I was VERY skeptical about dining here due to the consistent ratings about horrible service- but since my hungover friends were starved and didn't want to wait anywhere else to eat, this place suffices

First of all, we were all extremely grateful that the restaurant wasn't packed- it meant that the workers were very attentive and provided services when asked.

The servings were HUGEEEE. Prices ranged from $7-9 dollars and the quality of the food was better than I expected.
My friends and I were shocked. We actually really enjoyed this place!
We will definitely make more stops here IF it's not busy :)"}
{"text":"My favorite pho place in Vegas!!! And I'm an addict!!! I craved the broth throughout my pregnancy so I went here like 3 times a week!!! And trust me I tried many other pho places!! The service is also great"}
{"text":"****************** REVIEW 320 ******************

          Along with parents & my broski family came here after a long drive to Vegas, we wanted to check out some Viet food, since the Viet community had grown so much the last 2 years in Vegas.

         When we first got it, the server ran out & sat us down in a minute. But then took 10 minutes to take the order.

         Then they threw the food & drinks to our tables as we were beggars for food! We ordered:

- Pho combo,
- Rare beef Pho,
- Hu Tieu - Rice stick noodle soup with seafood,
- Egg Noodle with roasted pork, dry style,
- & Fried rice

           All noodle soup was $8 per bowl & nothing tasted good. I would thought after 8 hours drive, even rock would taste good!

           Pros: This place opened 24 hours! 
           Cons: Cash only & everything else!"}
{"text":"Mediocre food and rude customer service!

I was first attracted to this place because of recommendations from two Hawaii references. When my friends and I walked in and were seated, I was impressed with the extensive menu. So far so good. But when my order arrived, they brought me rice with my beef stew instead of the bread I had ordered. I informed the waiter (who acted like he was the boss) that I had ordered bread instead of rice. He grabbed a menu and rudely pointed out to me that the beef stew comes with rice OR bread and I needed to tell him which I wanted when I ordered. I sharply replied that I indeed had ordered bread. (My dining partner said he heard my order of bread instead of rice, so I wasn't delirious). The rude waiter snatched the plate of rice and brusquely said I would have to wait for the bread.

About 15 minutes later, another waiter finally brought \"my\" bread when I was almost done with the stew. Two of my other dining mates said they saw the waiter grab the bread from another table to give to me. Naturally, I refused to eat \"my\" bread since it previously had been on someone else's table. I'm not sure about Las Vegas health department requirements, but it seems to me that restaurants shouldn't be re-serving food that had already been given to others.

The stew broth was so-so in flavor, and the beef was sinewy and tough. I've had way better in Honolulu. Of course, I can't comment on the quality of the bread.

I won't return to this place. I can understand waiters making a mistake on orders. However, in this case, the rude waiter's manner in dealing with the problem - blaming me, the customer - was completely unacceptable and downright RUDE AND OBNOXIOUS. I would give this place a half star at best."}
{"text":"Amazing food and quick service from the time I ordered my food it's took me 5 min to get my food.
Also they are quick on service as well they see that your water is half empty they filling it up directly.
The food is so good and also good thing with this place is open 24/7"}
{"text":"I would've given this place four stars since I love their pho so much & the price for it, BUUUUUUT..... Their service SUCKS! There are so many things to say about the bad service here.

1. Although there is no wait time to be seated, there is a wait time that takes freakin' forever just for them to order your food. We were there for 20 minutes before they ordered our food. And it's not just this time, but EVERY SINGLE TIME WE VISIT.. 

2. RUDE. RUDE. RUDE. RUDE. RUDE SERVERS. I cannot stress that enough. We asked for forks because my mother doesn't know how to use chopsticks and the server gave us this really disgusted face. Um, what is your problem mister server sir?! -_______- IF YOU DON'T LIKE SERVING PEOPLE, GET ANOTHER JOB. SIMPLE AS THAT.

3. SLOW REFILLS. Dude, they gave us one glass of water and NEVER refilled our drinks ever again.. Our server was no where to be seen. It's like he dumped our food and took a freaking five hour break! Seriously?!?!?!?!?! Ugh..

I would come back to this place, but I'd probably order take out instead. Wouldn't want to stay and dine here if their servers are going to be complete a-holes to their PAYING CUSTOMERS."}
{"text":"Probably the worst pho I've tried thus far... But I expect this place to last a long time considering it's 24/7 and a cheaper option than restaurants on the strip.

Other notes:
- Cleanliness is a problem. Founds some bugs on our lettuce.
- Customer service is also a problem. They forgot my order even though we asked two different servers about it. I got beef stew by the time my family was done eating.
- Beef stew noodle soup portions were off. A LOT of soup, but not a lot of noodles.
- Pho noodles were hard and the soup was warm... Not hot.

Would've given them one star, but they were generous with meat portions in both the pho and the beef stew."}
{"text":"Went here with Tyson W. for dinner on 2/24/13. I've attempted going here before but I saw the reviews and went to Saigon 8 across the street instead. I'm glad Tyson chose this place because the food turned out to be pretty tasty. 

Now, it was a Sunday night so the place was nearly empty. I'm trying to stay away from grain so I was happy when I saw that #48, the beef stew didn't have noodles or rice in it. Tyson ordered the #18 which was some sort of chicken pho. My stew was really nice with a nice meaty flavor. It has almost a hint of cinnamon in it, which I wasn't expecting. I'd definitely order it again and the next day, I wanted to sneak back and buy another bowl for myself, I liked it that much. 

The service was attentive and polite. We were there for a little over an hour and it was a nice time. I'd go back again."}
{"text":"Good food, very delicious! The bun bo hue taste very yummy. U know like almost Asian restaurants, the waitress a lil quite . But it's ok. I was enjoy the food"}
{"text":"Today when I went for dinner and placed my order the waiter rudely said that he had run out of sandwiches. I then ordered the soup and a strawberry shake he said he was too busy and that it would take several minutes before he could do the order for the shake. You never brought the shake. He then serve me someone else's food. I had to remind him that I did not place the order and he quickly took the order back and give it to the correct table. This place has lousy service terrible soup I would never go there again. ."}
{"text":"The rare beef pho was great, but nothing to really stand out.  The lemongrass chili beef Bun Thit on the other hand was one of the best noodle dishes I've had in a long while.  
The Vietnamese iced coffee.....holy crap it's good, and potent.. Very very potent. I'm sure I could have ran a marathon after that."}
{"text":"This is by far the worst restaurant I have ever been too. I will never come back to this place. We only visited this place because we were so hungry after our flight that we just wanted to grab some Vietnamese food in town. However, it was such a disappointment. My parents ordered a fish soup entree' but it wasn't even good and authentic. It seems like this restaurant no longer care about the quality of their food, but more about grabbing your money as much as they can. 

P.S. The restaurant only accept cash. What?? Yeah, I know. They also does not want to give you a bill of the meal you pay for. As if, they don't want you to know how expensive they are. Boo--Hoo...."}
{"text":"really not good,the soup was too salty,the noodles not well done yet,i ordered combination,but i only see steak in the bowl,one star is for sever,food is zero!"}
{"text":"Being in Vegas requires that their be food open late/early! After leaving the Sams Casino and watching The Hobbit, it was around 12:00 AM when I asked my bf for pho! I was excited that this place was open 24hr! The pho was really good for it being a 24 hr joint and at good prices. I love pho because it's a comfort food, especially that I was sick. Being sick + pho = no congestion!

The only complaint I have was that my bf and I were wondering if they only accepted cash because they has a cash only sign though they do accept credit/debit.

The service was really friendly and fast, perhaps because we were in by 12:30 AM :D."}
{"text":"This place needs to be shut down or they're in serious need of a new management. Came here last night for a quick dinner (cuz it was almost empty with no wait) while Izakaya Go next door had a 30 min wait. Asked for a small size Pho noodle soup and was told no small size. I asked why, waiter said bluntly: \"It's the holiday.\" What????? Excuse me??? I said it's not stated on the menu that you don't offer small bowl of Pho on holidays. He continued: \" You can talk to the boss.\" Ok! Talked to the boss and got the same response. WTF!? Excuse my language-for whatever reason that you don't want to sell small size Pho, a simple apology with an offer for an alternative would put me at ease but you had to be rude and made me feel that ordering a small size Pho was my fault to begin with. The bad attitude was rediculous. I felt I was treated less of a customer and felt like being ripped off to buy a large Pho. Hello!!!!! Do you know why Izakaya Go was fully packed with a 30 min wait time while your Pho restaurant which is twice bigger but is only less than a quarter full with customers? On the day after Christmas?? Jesus Christ!! Here's why! Besides getting rid of your unfresh/bad smelly food/dishes (read from other Yelpers) and your whole other issues with hygiene and rude staffs, You need to improve by learning from your neighbor businesses. Businesses can't survive if you can't keep up with the competition nowadays and CUSTOMER SERVICE is a top priority in retail service industry especially restaurants. As soon as we found out we could get seated at Izakaya Go next door, we immediately left. May Lord bless you for God's sake... A negative star for this shitty place if it's an available option."}
{"text":"With only two other Vietnamese choices around here, this is the place. Skip the Chinese lunch specials though."}

All the rest of the staff wore maroon uniform shirts. Another lady in black with her shoes OFF must be his mom.
He must be the owner but he is handling money at the register, cleaning tables, serving food and eating lunch all at the same time...GROSS...THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT SHOULD COME and give this place multiple demerits"}
{"text":"Good food, terrible service! 

My family and I came in and wrote our names on the list as there was a lot of people waiting to eat. One of the workers looked at the list with ~5 names on it and threw it away to start a fresh new list. Me and other parties complained when we noticed he was seating people that came in after us because he didn't transfer the names over to the new sheet! Terrible system.

Upon being seated, they took the orders of the table next to us who came in at the same time but completely skipped over us. 10 minutes later they came back to take ours... ridiculous.

My party ordered one pho dish, one rice dish, one vermicelli dish and one hu tieu. All were delicious and came to us in a timely manner. I also ordered a Vietnamese coffee (comes in a styrofoam cup and lid), the waitress looked confused and went to two other tables nearby before delivering it to ours. Seems like there isn't good communication for waiting tables.

CASH ONLY!

I will not be returning, and do not recommend this place."}
{"text":"This place can be alright if you stick with selected dishes. Rice dishes are safe. I think I got the pork chops and egg op la. Its not on the menu.

I did not try the pho, but stay away. Hu tieu dishes, stay away.

I ordered the hu tieu special and I can see how they made the broth from my soup. Some bones, yeah thats okay. I think cow tongue? i guess its acceptable but no."}
{"text":"Wow, 2.5 average stars from 94 reviews?  

I didn't think they were that bad.  Pretty decent actually.  My friends and I came here at 3:15am since Pho Kim Long down the street had people waiting outside. 

None of my friends (6) had any complaints about the food or service.  

Come here if you don't want to wait to be seated."}
{"text":"I have to say that after reading the 5 of 7 poor reviews that this place has I was hesitant to try it and go to lemongrass instead but my bf loves the pho little Saigon on spring mountain so I decided to give it a try and was pleased with my decision. I order my usual, the grilled shrimp and veggie vermicelli bowl with 2 sides of fish sauce and was happy to see the waiter bring out a heaping bowl filled with noodles and lots of veggies with perfectly grilled shrimp. I have to say that this dish wins over lemongrass's and pho saigon dish based on veggie count and taste. Here at pho lil Saigon their shrimp taste awesome and the dish seems to have a good garlic flavor to it. I was missing the mango salad that lemongrass offers though. My bf orders the raw beef pho dish and likes the dish here better as well. Prices are comparable to the regular pho Saigon across the street and lemongrass. This will be my go to place for sure ;)"}
{"text":"We arrived in Vegas after 1AM on a Thursday. Checked ourselves in before venturing out. Saw this place was still open when we were driving around at 3 AM. Husband ordered bun thit nuong cha gio and I ordered pho & goi cuon. My soup wasn't that bad until I ate the meat which didn't taste fresh. Everything from the beef and tendons were yucky tasting. The goi cuon was sliced in halves and the mint they used was already blackened. Just had 1 bite of it and didn't touch the rest. So unhappy with the food."}
{"text":"Stopped in here craving a bowl of Pho. Hadn't ever been here before, surprised by the interior size of the place, plenty of seating! 

The lady who took my order was very nice and welcoming. Service was excellent. As for the Pho, I was pleasantly surprised how good it was. Not too salty, the broth was delicious on its own (I still add a little Hoison for fun). Meat quality good and quantity was plentiful. No complaints here.

I will definitely come back and eat here again. Careful with the traffic from In and Out, cars will block the driveway while they wait in line for a burger and make it hard to get to Little Saigon."}
{"text":"Pho-tastic has more ox-tail taste to the pho  then some other places depending on how long the broth marinates which is a good thing. If your looking for that distinct flavor that is naturally in well made pho."}
{"text":"Very rude waiter, we have the kids on the group just finish eating and the waiter just grab the high chair (almost hitting my wife) and the tips off course want to clean up without saying excuse me (maybe can't speak English) or waiting for us to leave the table. So shame no manner....!!! Stay away from this place !!!"}
{"text":"I don't like to be the bearer of bad news for any restaurant but I will say the service here was horrible. I started off by letting the owner they're know that the bathroom was dirty since there was only two stalls and one of them had a freaking turd clogged in the toilet which looked like it was about a foot high! (already grossing out my appetite). Being that I worked 13 hours straight at two different jobs I got there quite tired. When the waiter asked me what I wanted to eat I took a deep breath and was about to give my order but he immediately walked away as though I was taking too long. I finally got my order from another waiter and towards the very end I didn't realize that they only took cash. 

Luckily they had a machine back there that took my card so I said \"You'll have to forgive me for being a little spaced out i just worked a 13 hour shift today\" he says with a very strong accent, \"I don't care about the fact that you worked 13 hours I just want my money!\" So with that being said I did not leave a tip. My tip would have been, \"Go to hell and don't let the door hit you on your way out!!\"... by the way, I went back to the restroom to fix my hair and saw the same mass of crap there. I let the owner know and he said that he could not go in there because he was a man but I clearly saw him tell his female worker about the issue earlier and i remember her looking me in the face and giving me dirty look.

Please forgive me for being so candid about it but damn, I'm just keeping it real about my experience and can say that unfortunately I never plan on coming back to this restaurant again...

So much for thinking that I could have found a new 24 hour Pho spot!"}
{"text":"I came in for a take out order. They packed the bag poorly. They put the broth container on its side and it spilled in the smaller bag it comes in. It had a hole in it because it spilled inside the larger bag and all the napkins and fixings were all drenched with broth. I noticed it was dripping after I got into my Lyft. Pretty much all of the broth was gone by the time I got home. I tried calling them back and explaining what the issue was and they were extremely rude!! I told them I took a Lyft and didn't want to spend more for coming back for their mistake. They informed me they don't deliver. I was going to come back until the manager got on the phone and was very nasty and even hung up in my face and said the customers aren't right and they shouldn't replace it. It was my fault since I noticed the leak after I left the restaurant. I didn't even ask for a refund I just wanted more broth! He told me he would report me to the police for harassing them after calling back again! I'll never eat here again or give them business. I was very kind and respectful and they were not. I don't recommend eating here!! Bad customer service!"}
{"text":"Not the best Pho but after a night of drinking in Vegas anything goes.

They have some extra fat egg-rolls, definitely gay-friendly.

Coconut juice in real coconut. A+"}
{"text":"Service, food quality, and EVERYTHING overall is below standards. 

The only thing is that the restaurant was crowded giving me an impression that it was actually decent.

It took half an hour alone to get a server's attention to place an order. Usually at other pho restaurants you LEAVE in half an hour. With this half hour there was a family of four near me. The two daughters finished eating and their parents never got their food. A waiter Carried food out and delivered to every corner of the restaurant..how does that even work. 

When our future finally came,  it only took us one sip of the soup to know that they used a dirty pot to prepare our soup. A pot, that was just used to prepare a rice dish that I saw come out a few minutes before my food. 

Just go eat McDonald's."}
{"text":"The lady cashier is very rude. I think she is the owner family. She keep nagging and yelling at her employees. Very bad customer service. And this is the cash only Vietnamese restaurant."}

Water came with no straws and has to ask for it

After we ordered they didn't take the menu away just left it at the table

Ordered beer and they left the cap on

Order com ga roti and they messed up the order giving us com ga louc

The f right now...food is ehhh not worth bang for buck 

Also it says cash only...however they do take card...price of crap place with horrible service"}
{"text":"I was a little hesitant to be trying this place out, but my experience actually went well... The workers there seemed very friendly and our food came out fast too. I ordered the Bún bo huê and that was okay. Nothing too big to be raving about though. Probably won't be coming back because the other reviews still scare me and food was a bit pricey. Then again, this is coming from someone who doesn't live in Vegas lol."}
{"text":"This is my go to pho spot when visiting Las Vegas. My mom loves this place as well and this is usually where I take her. The service is fast and they know us. Don't go there  expecting to hold a  long pleasant conversation with the staff. It's a good go in and eat place but not for interacting with the staff. The pho is excellent and I normally get the durian smoothie with boba. The great thing about it is that they are open 24/7. You'll enjoy it. I do every time."}
{"text":"Terrible food my whole family of 6 don't like anything they ordered. Mì bò kho was horrible. Chewy beef and very salty broth. Bún rêu was not good either, imitate crab and other. Bun Bò Hu was just ok. Fried rice is just oily rice. 
The restroom was nasty and that just threw off my appetite. Good thing I are bf using the restroom. My rating reflected on how clean the restroom is because u can't imagine the chef and other used it and cook the food."}
{"text":"It was decent and quick but nothing to write home about. I thought the Pho was a little over priced at $7.95 but maybe that's me being a cheap ass and expecting Orange County Westminster Pho prices for lunch. The place was huge but hardly anyone there when I say down for lunch at 130PM. Anyway, if your in the mood for pho and are in the area, it's worth stopping by but I wouldn't go out of my way for it."}
{"text":"Omg the water is disgusting and tastes like a mixture of toilet and pool water. The service took a while even though it wasn't busy. The broth was not as fresh and savory tasting as Pho Saigon/Pho Lemongrass down the road and the meats were overly chewy. The atmosphere is very uninviting. I feel like people should just drive like 20 more feet to go to the other Pho places surrounding. Will not return."}
{"text":"Absolutely outstanding in every respect. I agree with R.P. that perhaps the few negative reviews are confused with which place they are reviewing, as there is nothing to complain about here. The portions are more than ample, quality is superb, and the service is impeccable. It is nice to have more room than you need as opposed to a wait and crowded conditions. Do yourself a favor and give Pho Little Saigon a chance - you will be glad you did."}
{"text":"The food is good, but the service is average (not really friendly) and they only take \"Cash Only\". It's only worth it as it opens 24 hours..."}
{"text":"I wish I was not a Vietnamese so I didnt hear the fighting between those services. They dont smile  at the customers ( then why you choose this job?). They yelled at each other like in the market, not in the restaurant. The food was okay. I dont complain about the food :). There was a couple next to me and they were Idian-vegiterians, and they asked the service to make something for them. He refused to do it. Really people? I know you guys are middle-age people but we pay our money to get a good time or good food. You guys better change..."}
{"text":"This used to be my  bad relationship. For many years, I came to this place. My sister and I had a favorite Pho spot that had closed down and so on our mission to find a new Pho spot we settled at this place. 

I was a weekly regular, that is how much I used to love this place. In the beginning this place was kind to me. It knew exactly what I wanted and always exceeded my expectations. If I was having a bad day, I could come in and be greeted by the servers who were always so welcoming to me and would serve me up a big bowl of delishness.

You know how you hit that 7 year itch in a relationship? I guess that is what you say happened to me. The service went down. The quality of the food went down. They had a couple of bad health inspections and to me, it just never was the same.

So I slowly stopped going. However, just like that bad relationship that you keep coming back to, \"because just maybe it'll change and go back to how it used to be\", I kept going back. And some days, I would be like \"Yes!\" this is why I love this place. Yet, more often than not it was like slow torture. The broth would get worse and worse, the meat would be tough and chewy. The last of the last was when I went and it tasted like there was soy sauce in my bowl of Pho. Definitely not okay. Just more often than not, it would be bland and flavorless. How fun is that?

I should give this place a 3 star based on the fact that I was a die hard fanatic for years but considering that I have visited this place in the last couple of months and it's still poor quality, I just can't. 

I remember when I first signed up with yelp and saw all the poor reviews, I didn't get it. I had thought to myself these people do not know what they are talking about. Kinda like, when you have that bad relationship and everyone else keeps telling you need to leave but you just can't, not until you are ready. 

Well, that chapter is closed and this relationship is no more. Onto better Pho!

(I orginally put this review under the wrong location. MY BAD! It has now been corrected to the rightful owner.)"}
{"text":"The service wasn't that great, and it was lunch/dinner. It wasn't even that busy but there were some issues that I don't really need to address in detail. 

As for the food, I ordered a vermicelli with pork and egg rolls. Not bad. Really filling as I'd like in a first meal of the day in vegas after a night of drunk rampaging. Several of my other friends ordered different types of pho, and all had the same review. Basically, the pho was too minty, and I could definitely smell what they were talking about. maybe we're spoiled out here in the bay area with pretty damn good pho, but they needa step their game up a little bit at this spot."}
{"text":"I walked out of this place because in mid conversation a lady yelled \"excuse me\" and he walked away, me in mid sentence, to refill her water. I WISH someone was here to see it because the racial disrespect was OVERT!!! I will NEVER GO HERE AGAIN!!"}
{"text":"Took an hr for them to bring my food, inconsistence food. 
This place is a waste of space in vegas, should have new management or new cook, whatever. Not coming back for sure."}
{"text":"There is little doubt that this is the best Pho restaurant in Las Vegas. 
I think the reason why there are a lot of bad reviews here on yelp is because  a lot of Pho restaurants on Spring Mountain  have the word \"SAIGON\" in their title. There is \"Pho old SAIGON\", \"Pho SAIGON 8\", \" Pho SAIGON\" \"Pho Huong SAIGON\" \"Pho Vietnam SAIGON\", and even another \"Pho Little Saigon\" that is an unrelated restaurant. .  I think most the people are confusing this place for another restaurant because there is no way you could dislike the food from here. 

Everyone who follows my weird and profanity filled reviews knows that my favorite food in the world is Miso Ramen.  The Pho at PHO LITTLE SAIGON is the only Pho in the world which I would eat over Ramen on occasion.  Obviously, I would still rather go to a place like \"Anime Ramen\" where everyone knows your name after only your 1st visit, and your bowl of noodles practically comes with a show + entertainment....but  sometimes I'm just in the mood for cilantro and a clear soup.

I recommend everyone to try the Rare Steak Pho.  They use a very high quality cut of steak. I think it might be petite sirloin because it was extremely soft tender and just melted in your mouth. It almost had the texture of Filet Mignon. What I really liked was how the steak  was blood red. They don't even cook it, they just poor the hot soup over the meat and serve immediately. 

The broth is crystal clear and clean. It looks like the water off the coast of Hawaii because you could see clear down to the bottom.  The top of the broth is full of natural oils. These oils are common in soups where you had to boil bones for over 20 hours. They are purely natural and are a great visual indication of the high quality.

They use Red Onions instead of generic onions! Red onions make the Pho taste so much better than the regular brown onions. 

They are definitely not cheap here. You get over 1/2 a pound of free bean sprouts and basil. You ask for extra limes and they literally hand you the whole lime(and it's a giant lime).  Most places like \"Pho So 1\" and \"Pho Kim Long\" give you half of even a half of a lime wedge.  If you ask for extra onions, they literally slice the whole onion and give you the whole thing. 

The service was very quick and fast. 
I think it's worth mentioning that they are Cash Only. So don't blow all your cash at the casino..save some of it and bring it here. It is also worth mentioning that they are open 24 hours/ 7 days a week. 

From now on, this is the only Pho restaurant I would ever go to in Las Vegas. Not only is the food great, but you don't have to sit next to the typical drunk-degenerate-immature Vegas Club Douche like at  \"Pho Kim Long\". And you don't have to be ignored and treated like crap like at \"Pho So 1\". PHO LITTLE SAIGON also better fits my lifestyle. It's open 24 hours, it's atmosphere is more quite and relaxing, and the service is alright by me!"}
{"text":"Probably your best bet for a late night dinner after an eventful evening at the club, bar, gambling, or even a show! And it's cheap! How cheap? Cheap as hell I'd like to think. Also it's a 24/7 restaurant. 

I had their rare beef and meatball pho and their eggrolls. I would say their broth is a little sweeter than to my liking but still not too bad. The eggrolls were awesome! I loved it! 

Maybe my favorite cheap eats joint in Vegas besides In-N-Out"}
{"text":"Food was disgusting. I got the General Tso Chicken, like I normally do at other restaurants, and the sauce was very bland with no flavor. It was a bit sour, as if it was old. I wasn't asked how the food was after the meal, and the guy who served me (came from the kitchen to take my order) was very rude. The hostess was very sweet, but she didn't take my order. 

Find somewhere else to go, this was a major disappointment."}
{"text":"Their soups are really good. I like to come here when I'm feeling under the weather for the #162 with mint leaves."}
{"text":"All the employees were yelling at eachother, causing interruptions of conversations. Server didn't want me to order what I wanted to order, why have a menu? Suggested noodle soup because it wouldn't take long but Bruhh, I want to eat what I want to eat! Others may be satisfied by this service but not for me. Couldn't even have a nice meal on Christmas."}
{"text":"If I can give them 0 star I would. 

My first time here, ordered some food, egg rolls came out, my 5 year old ate it and told me its bad, I took a bite and sure enough it was rotten and tasted sour, they wouldn't let us cancel other food and made us pay for it"}

I actually preferred coming here over Pho Kim Long even though Pho Kim Long was voted \"Best Vietnamese Restaurant\" in Las Vegas.

On our most recent trip to Vegas, we stopped in here with a large group of friends.  For the most part, we were all happy with our orders.  The food was average to above average tasting.  Nothing great.

Although, the food came out fairly fast, the service was not so good.  None of the workers seemed to know how to smile either.

My wife and I were starving so we ordered #15, #72, and #96.  We ordered way too much food because the portions were huge.  If I were rating them on just portion size, they would get 5 stars.   #72 was grilled pork, grilled shrimp, eggroll, and vermicelli.  It came packed with food in a large bowl.  With regards to taste, I'd give it 3 stars cause it was just mediocre.  #96 was chinese broccoli and it was 3.5 stars good.  #15 was my wife's pho order.  She really liked the taste of it and rated it 4 stars.  It was way tastier than Pho Kim Long.

Now, would we return here?  Well, I would definitely choose Pho Little Saigon over Pho Kim Long cause this place is also 24 hours.  Just make sure you bring the cash and do not expect really good customer service."}
{"text":"I know better than to trust a restaurant that bills itself as \"Vietnamese AND Chinese cuisine\" (in general, I try to avoid restaurants that bill themselves as originating from two different countries unless they are specifically doing fusion or something purposeful, such as China Poblano, because it means they specialize in neither country's cuisine). Still, we came here one day because Pho Saigon 8 wasn't open yet. 

The pho broth was really whatever. It was really watery and not that flavorful. I also ordered the banh xeo (Vietnamese pancake) which was greasy and soggy, not at all crispy. 

I would much rather go to Pho Saigon 8 or Pho Mai Lan, which are both better and cheaper than here."}
{"text":"Idk why this place has such bad reviews I have been coming here for years maybe 2-3 years I never had issues with service, I have come here at all hours of the time and day, and the food for me.. Is better then most places around town or I wouldn't have been coming back so this long. They are open 24/7 and when I get my soup out its always hot. Did I mention they are open 24/7? They employees do bicker in the background but it never bothered me. I usually get take out and a extra cup of broth for 2$.Perfect for winter. Or something casual late night with your friends. I like this place :)"}
