{"text":"A taste for taste. A bless in a continent where fake food has become normal.  Wines are really special, food has fine taste and the atmosphere is cosey! Don't doubt just go!"}
{"text":"when there on a friday night, was all pretty good.  Nice patrons, wines and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Really nice and cozy place. Very chill. Best if you reserve a table beforehand. Good music and not too loud so you can comfortably talk too. Check it out!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I walked in without a reservation on a Friday night. They seated us right away (at the bar, tisk tisk) but the servers were very professional and knowledgable.   We had 4 dishes. Calamari, bison burgers, tuna steaks and chorizo. They were all divine, well prepared and the delivery of each dish was timed perfectly.   We had 2 glasses of wine each. The server knew lots about each kind of wine and I liked that they deal exclusively with organic producers.   It was very trendy, a little over priced but all in all a great Montreal experience."}
{"text":"Good selection of wines by the glass including interesting flights.  Prices reflect the quality of the wines being served.  Food is good."}
{"text":"This place was kind of hidden and out of the way, but very cute.  Intimate and modern looking with a second floor of tables.  The tables are a little close together but the bigger tables are nicer if you can get one.  We went on a Sunday night and there was still a good crowd.    The Spicy pecans & almonds were yummy and went well with the wine. The Goat cheese with herbs & spicy red peppers was really good and came with some toast.  Green beans, truffle oil & roasted almonds was different and very tasty.  The Fried cod balls were good but not the best.  The Mixed fried mushrooms, crostini & watercress was really tasty.  We also had the sliced Duck, which was amazing and melted in your mouth.  Good spot for some wine and a light intimate dinner.  Check out the very cool chandler."}
{"text":"Currently sitting in this restaurant. When the three of us first arrived, the waitress/bartender took our coats to the coat check which was nice. We were seated quickly and given menus. The waitress then came back 3 times within 15 minutes of us being seated. We ordered on her third trip and received our drinks and the charcuterie board (one of the only redeeming factors of this place) and then were ignored for the next 45 minutes despite our drinks being empty and us finishing up the charcuterie board. The waitress helped the other two tables directly next to us 3 times without even making eye contact with us. Without sounding too ignorant, I do believe it was because we were English speakers and unfortunately they gave off the vibe that feeds into the Montreal stereotype of not liking natives. When we finally were approached by the waitress again, we just wanted some water and to order more drinks and food. They brought us back water with ice despite no one else receiving water with ice. After spending some time in France, and seeing how the Parisians stuck their noses up at Americans, I unfortunately took this as an insult. We didn't come to Montreal to have an American vacation. It's unfortunate they treat those who are fully open to being immersed to French-Canadian culture as second class. Will not come back when there are so many other options available in this city."}
{"text":"The bartender was completely rude and a major jerk. Wanted to try this place for quite some time and my experience was far from stellar. One of the worst service experiences I've had"}
{"text":"The chandelier is amazing! When making your reservation, request to be seated upstairs. Otherwise you're seated in a room that looks like a basement that was converted into a large dark eating area. The tapas were delicious! My favorites were the grilled cheese and lamb tapa. My hubby and daughter loved the seasonal vegetables and even ordered them a second time! Great wine selection. Loved the champagne by the glass and trio sampler."}
{"text":"My first visit was not a home run but definitely a stand-up double. The place is interesting and the menu has some landscape worth exploring. The trio of Pinot Noir 2 oz selections - Oregon, France and Australia - was fun. Serving in Reidel glass is a serious plus. Stay tuned for updates as they happen..."}
{"text":"Great find on our first night in Montreal! Sampled some wine flights and every single tapas plate we ordered was excellent. The green beans and lobster roll were our favorites."}
{"text":"Love this place.  I was staying at nearby hotel, and this place was easily within walking distance.  I went a bit too early so I left prior to really experiencing the after-work crowd.  The staff is OK.  They think they're really cool to work there and have a bit of a snooty air about them.  But they were still respectful and prompt.    Unlike the earlier reviewer, I didn't get the line about the requirement to order food.  But let's be honest, I never have that problem as I order food as often as I can wherever I can.  I had an excellent Alsace here...perfectly dry but had a light sweentness.  So refreshing.  They had an amazing malbec also.  I definitely enjoyed the wine much more than the food.  I ordered 3 tapas - hangar steak with mashed potatoes and a light gravy, calamari, and mini bison burgers.    The hangar steak with fork tender but they put on too much of the watery gravy.  The bison burgers were good, but the patties were slight, even for a mini-bun.  The match stick fries were a cute addition, and I devoured them.  Finally, the calamari was just bland.  And they don't even serve a red dipping sauce, only a mayonnaise based sauce.  I wouldn't go back for the food as it's clear although the food is decent, it's just an accompaniment for their great wines.  This is a fun, trendy place with a relaxing and modern decor.  When you walk in, there's a narrow area with booth and table seating.  The bar is immediately on the left and quite small.  Yet, the lower lever right below the bar provides ample seating.  The acoustics are a bit distracting when it starts to fill up but not overwhelming.  It's definitely worth a try, especially for after-work functions or a fun date."}
{"text":"Just to clarify, I used to work here, and boy I loved it, but life takes you to places, if you know what I mean. First of all Vero knows her wines, the wine list might look a little overwhelming at first glance, but it's full of gems. I recommend to start with a flight (trio of 2oz) to get you in the mood, then go wild! The menu is a master piece created by chef Stelio, there is a bit for every palate in that blue sheet, my favourite is the Cod \"brandade\" just delicious! I go back now and then to have a good taste of the past, nice chat with old coworkers and enjoy! Cheers!"}
{"text":"We were new to the whole tapas experience but our English speaking waiter was very polite and patient with us.   We had the bison burgers (so good), calamares, chorizo & shrimps (very tasty & spicy), smoked salmon, crispy lamb (also very good) and venison tartar.  For wine we did the Trio Bulles and the Trio Breton. Both sets were delicious. We then finished it off with the Langhe  2011 Merlot. My 20-something kids enjoyed the ambiance. Overall a very good experience."}
{"text":"I've had some great bottles here, including what I now fondly remember as THE best wine in my entire life (which they have unfortunately since discontinued). The side dishes are also pretty solid.   It has an upscale vibe - classy yet unpretentious. Great place for a date or a drink with a friend. I'm a big fan."}
{"text":"I really liked this place.  The service was good and the food and wine were great.  I went on a Friday with my wife for a romantic outing.  It was a little loud for a quiet chat though.  On recommendation from other yelp posts we tryed the mini burgers and we were not disappointed. The pears for dessert were incredible.  I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"This restaurant is pretty small so beware that you might feel like you're part of someone else's conversation, or they yours.   With that said, the food was delicious and we enjoyed everything that we ordered.  Our favorites were the beets and the bison sliders.  In fact, the bison slider might be the best bison slider (or burger for that matter) that I've ever had.  Delicious mini pickle, aioli, and the meat was juicy, not dry.  Wish I could go back and try more!  PS.  The dessert plate of four is not a sampling of other things on the dessert menu, but still delicious."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this swank place for over 10 years and it consistently delivers good food with a great atmosphere. One of the few late night places I've discovered which serves food late."}
{"text":"Delish. Great option near the Hilton Garden Inn. Industrial, trendy vibe with small plates."}
{"text":"Pullman was the first restaurant we visited on our trip to Montreal and it was a great introduction to the city. Started the meal off with a wine tasting of sparkling and white wine. Waitress was very knowledgable about wines but it was hard to hear her when she spoke and a lot of information to take in at once, would have been nice to see description in writing. Ordered 5 plates to share between two plus dessert and it was the perfect amount of food. Each plate was unique and delicious and paired nicely with the wine tasting. The interior of the Pullman was modern, classic and creative, loved the wine glass chandelier. Maybe the prices were a bit high if you're on a budget, but being from NYC this was great fancy eating for a lot less."}
{"text":"My first night in Montreal, arrived late in town, and this gem of a restaurant was nearby my hotel. The food and service were both excellent. It is a little dark in there, but that is part of their ambience- they sat the four of us upstairs. The mini bison burgers, green beans with truffle oil, shrimp & chorizo, ribs (spicy sauce was tasty), goat cheese, and beet salad were the best dishes among the many that we ordered. The waiter made a suggestion to pair our dishes with a nice bottle of white wine and some local Montreal beer. They only served bottled beer, nothing on draft/tap. The waiters were also helpful in telling us the most popular tourist attractions in the area, what to do, and what was not worth our time. Ended with the dark chocolate truffles for dessert, which were amazing!"}
{"text":"What a great night at Pullman! Starting off with a cocktail, great wine and food, delicious deserts! Brownies highly recommended..."}
{"text":"Really, i've read good reviews about this place, i've been there two times, and both of the times i wasnt impress, i went back a second time to give it a chance, and it failed.   is this supose to be a wine bar. because seriously if i have a wine bar, i would offer mor than 10 wine on the glass, yes they have big wine collection on the bottle, but who is going to buy more than 3 bottle unless your a group? and there is a big lack of australian, south african and spanish wine???   The food is nice when you read it, but then when its on the table.... almost everything is served with micro tiny fries, their tartare look like....alot of the food is greasy. Its like same as L'academie, that is like a fancy mcdonalds.   I can pay the same price and have much more better experience.  The staff, last time i was there, our waitress was super rude, and look pissed a us because my friend was lactose intolerant. and when she was ordering the food, she was putting both of her elbows on our table!! who those that??? the girl serving our wine was much more nice, and we asked her if the other girl was in her PMS, and if she could be our waitress.  anyway i surely wont be back there, even if they pay me to go eat there."}
{"text":"Loved this place for late dinner and drinks. Waiter was down-to-earth, knowledgeable about wine and was able to point out some great ones for us.  We had the serf tartare and the charcuterie plate, which were both excellent. The space was modern and industrial, but unique lighting made it feel super inviting and warm. Overall, I had a fabulous time!"}
{"text":"This might be the best bar/restaurant I have ever been to.  I like mixed drinks and my friend likes red wine. I ordered two cosmos and she ordered a delicious, spicy red wine. It was interesting. Had so much oomph.   Also! We're huge foodies. The food they had was DELICIOUS. The grilled cheese, the brownie dessert, everything! Just get it all and come back! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This is a great wine and tapas bar in Montreal. If you are a wine connoisseur or just appreciate a nice glass of wine, Pullman has a variety range of vintages and great wines to offer.  I sampled the Trio Bordeaux (3 glasses of 2oz wine). It was great to have a variety to sample from.   In terms of food, we ordered the Bison Burgers (a must), Shrimps & Chorizo, Wild Scallop Carpaccio and the Cheese Board. The cheese board featured a variety of cheeses from the Quebec region which was great.   The service was great. The waiter that served us was very knowledgeable about the wines.  I would recommend this bar for a great date night in Montreal or just a girls wine night!"}
{"text":"Had a Valentine's dinner here, so there was a bit of pressure for the restaurant to perform, but it did. The atmosphere is really fun and trendy. We had dinner on the second level where there are a lot of high-tops and a small bar (where we ate).   The music could have been special for the holiday, but I hope not! Loved it. The restaurant was playing jazzy romantic music and really set the mood for a good date spot.  Food and wine were really great. We shared 6 plates which worked out to be a perfect amount as some of the plates are very small (scallops, you get one each). Would highly recommend the sea bass carpaccio and venison tartare.  Staff we met were very friendly and helpful, restaurant was lively and fun.... overall really great experience. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"The good: Cool ambiance, very trendy.  Multilevel seating.  Just a couple of blocks away from the Metro station.  Huge wine list - by the bottle.  Only a couple of pages of wines by the glass (your choice of either a 2oz or 4oz pour).  The waiter was very knowledgeable about the wines and offered 2 excellent recommendations.  The ricotta gnocchi and bison sliders both stood out as excellent.  The not-so-good: Even though we had a reservation, we had to wait about 10 minutes to be seated.  There was no one else waiting, and several empty tables.  I was disappointed to be seated at a table with stools when I later noticed other tables with real chairs (I did not raise this concern with the waiter).  The prices were a bit higher than I expected - 5 tapas plates ranging in price from $7-$15 and 4 glasses of wine fed 2 people for $100.  At one point our waiter forgot to put our next order in so we waited over 20 minutes between courses."}
{"text":"Had an excellent dinner with a great variety of tasty dishes with local touches. We were three so it was easy to share. Extensive wine selection as well. Extremely pleasant staff. We sat in the window, but sitting downstairs might be overly noisy. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Wonderful atmosphere, food and most importantly the drinks. Check out the awesome chandelier."}
{"text":"This is a super cool wine bar, but expensive for the area it's in considering it's near McGill campus. However I went here with my mom and discovered it was the perfect atmosphere for all ages! Perfect for more of an upscale date but also nice for a place to relax before and/or after a dinner. The cheese plate is delicious but like any wine bar like this one it doesn't contain enough cheese for the price. There's a large variety of wines available dating way back but for our budget we chose the cheapest red wine available, but it was still delicious"}
{"text":"We weren't hungry enough for a full meal and needed a break from our beer drinking. The place is small and dimly lit, and brings to mind having drinks in a winer cellar, so the ambiance is appropriate. We had a reservation for dinner on a Friday night, but didn't really need one. The place wasn't full, but wasn't too empty either.  We had the bacon and cheese gougeres, the lamb with onion puree ( amazing- it's was braised, shredded and inside a crispy spring roll wrapper) the duck ( perfectly cooked) and the cod fritters (their delicious and delicate take on fish and chips).   We split a bottle of red recommended by our waitress who was educated in her wines. In all a great night out."}
{"text":"I'm not a much of wine person. But sometime to time my girlfriend and I go once in a blue moon.  This place is great for couples and even for group of guys or group of girl who love wine.  The selection of wine is huge! From Europe to Americans and to Australian wine from cheap to expensive wine.  I was not only amazed from wine but also the food!  They do not have large selection of food but they made it really good paring with their wine selection Bravo!!  We have smoked salmon plate seems it's homemade!  And the service was very good! Waiter always checked to make sure if everything was good!"}
{"text":"Food is good and reasonably priced, drinks are in tiny portion and when the waitress bought my drink up I thought she actually spilled most of it on her way to the table! Had to take a picture - couldn't believe how empty it looked!"}
{"text":"Very good food and ambience.  Tapas portions are nice in size and priced fairly.  Decor is very modern and enjoyable!  Service is good but SLOW.  Takes nearly 30 minutes to receive tapas on numerous occasions. Great wine selection but limited beer choices. Churros are awful though... Overall great experience."}
{"text":"Zero complaints about this wire bar.   The waiter, Dabril, was very knowledgeable about every wine that was offered and was quick with recommendations. He was also very personable and remembered us when we returned a couple days later.   The tapas were the perfect size to try different foods without getting filled up too quickly. Between the two nights we probably tried 1/3 of the food offered and it all tasted pretty good.   The atmosphere was lively without being uncomfortably loud. There are four areas that you can sit in that allow you to sit at a small dining table, a secluded bar in the front, couches in the front, or a larger bar in the back."}
{"text":"The Pullman is a cozy little wine and tapas place. The decor is of rich dark wood and soft lighting. The music is a bit overwhelming for quiet conversation. The service was not precisely up to par considering this is an upscale restaurant. Our server sported a hipster look with a flower tattoo on his wrist. He was curt and acted as if we were a bother to his slow evening. It's too bad really, we were here visiting the University and simply looking forward to a pleasant dining experience.  The food was fine, it is somewhat creative, and presented well, but not amazing. The presentation was easily the best part aside from the remarkable wine selection. The mini bison burgers and miniature cone of fries were adorable.  Lucky for us, this place was close to the hotel on a frigid evening, however when we return, I would rather walk further to avoid being treated poorly."}
{"text":"I love this place! Delightful ambiance and lovely decor. Good place for a date or just to have a glass of wine with a small group of friends. I would go there more to drink than eat though, but you can still have a bite."}
{"text":"L'endroit est chaleureux, les tapas sont excellents et le choix d'alcool est diversifié. Mais pour moi, le Pullman demeurera pour toujours l'endroit où, lors d'un souper de Noël de bureau, la copine de mon patron de l'époque, incidemment aussi sa cousine, lui a versé sa coupe de vin rouge sur la tête devant tous ses employés après une crise plus ou moins enfantine (de la part des deux). Certains moments dans la vie sont trop délicieux pour être oubliés. Merci, Pullman ! :)"}
{"text":"I don't know, this place didn't really do it for me. In general, I don't like the super fancy vibe in Montreal restaurants, because you can get really amazing and unique food at a chiller places. So, in Montreal, fancy does not equal better food. So then why would I pay extra $$ just for some dimmer lights and a more extensive wine menu?   On its own, it's a good place, but considering what MtL has to offer in just a hop, skip and jump away from this place - no thanks. Oh, and small portions! Bye!"}
{"text":"This is a good spot for intimate dates or a girl's night out. I had the tapas for dinner which probably wasn't enough food.   I must rave about the fois gras - it was magnificent! The presentation, the mix of pineapple, fois gras, greens, black pepper and sea salt that you build on a piece of toasted bread. It sounds like a strange mixture of flavours but I thought it was a perfect combination of spicy, salty, sweet and savoury.  The porto grilled cheese had an interesting jammy flavour.  The matchstick fries that came with the mini bison burgers were like hickory sticks but better and just as addictive. I thought it was a creative take on the usual fries.  The duck confit was kind of weird, stringy and chewy. The swirly greens on top were a great visual but didn't really taste like anything."}
{"text":"The food is to die for. I especially love the mushrooms and asparagus dish. The servers are always very friendly and knowledgeable."}
{"text":"To be honest I'm sad I didn't love this place. I love tapas bars. This place was just ok at best. Walked in and was sat upstairs. The place didn't have many people in it yet they place everyone on top of each basically. You can't even relax because you are so close to the next people. I couldn't even move. It also took a very long for our server to greet us.   We ordered grilled cheese... They were ok. Nothing special. We ordered the crispy lamb with onion purée. I couldn't decide if I liked it or not. It almost tasted wrong if that makes sense. We also got the cheese plate. I thought that was good.  Wine list was also good. Nice Pinot from France.  It was a little over priced for what you got. I wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"Good ambience and nice staff. The decor is chic and there's low lighting to set the romantic mood.  My boyfriend and I choose four dishes - the venison tartare with homemade chips, bones quail piri-piri vegetable caramel, crispy braised lamb and onion cream, strozzapreti pancetta and vegetables. See the pictures below. The lamb and strozzapreti were way better than the first two plates. That being said, the venison and quail were yummy too - just that we've had better from other places. Great place for tapas!"}
{"text":"Food poisoning!! We were a big group of people and my best friend's husband and I both ordered Bally's! The following day at 6 am, I woke up with severe stomach cramps, and vomiting, fever and diarrhea that lasted for 2 days! The same happened to my best friend's husband...we were the only ones who had Bally's at this place and that was the only thing that both of us ate alone without the group. Please make sure you store your alcohol correctly! My vacation got absolutely ruined! I am visiting from California for 5 days only and I lost several days because of this incident...I am writing this review while in bed."}
{"text":"First off, I really liked this place!  I was in town for the weekend, and my wife and I wanted a place to grab a bite for dinner.  Thanks to Yelp, I decided to drop in and check it out. I even used Yelp to make the reservation.   The restaurant itself was a little hidden, but not too hard to find.  It's also a little small, but there was more room upstairs.  The food was all really good, and prices were pretty reasonable.  It was a little romantic too, and the chandelier was awesome."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here nearly 30x in the past 10 yr and the food is great and in the past 10 years we had great service. But it's been 6 mnths since we last ate here and clearly something (the servers??) has changed.   This review is about the awful service. Food = 8/10, service = -10/10. Our waitress upstairs forgot to place our order; and only placed our friends (we were on a dble date). When our friends food kept coming and ours didn't we realized something was amiss and asked where was our food. She seemed oblivious to what we meant even though we had discussed with her our two orders. Not sure if she's just distracted, bored or what?! The floor was dead quiet so she wasn't busy...to top it off she took no accountability and though she covered our last wine she did so begrudgingly w no real apology for a major f* up since it was too late for us to order and eat and get home in time for our babysitter. It would've been a waste of a night if not for our great friendly company :) we ended up reheating pizza for dinner at 11pm once we got home. Sigh."}
{"text":"Amazing staff. Very kind and know the menu very well! Food was extremely full body flavor and the cheese platter couldn't have been better. All of our drinks were very on point! And again the staff couldn't be better, our servers were simply amazing. Great way to end our trip in Montreal in gorgeous gem of a place!"}
{"text":"I have to say, I really enjoyed this place. Really cool ambiance - slightly romantic. Good wine - huge selection. Didn't eat here, but would definitely come back to try some food. Prices are good..  I love the cool chandelier made of wine glasses, and the vibe this place gave off was great. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"A++, this restaurant was our go to visiting Montreal. Down the block from where we were staying.  No wait and they accepted Amex (not many places in Canada do) anyways the best grilled cheese I have tasted ever and the kobe sliders were like no other! Our waiter was also the bar tender, he was young and ensured we were being taken care of.  The truffles were delicious, I wanted to take some home with me!  I will definitely be back when I visit Montreal"}
{"text":"One of a kind.   Cool concept  Unique decor Great menu  Wine list for days  Just try it out and you will see! Great date spot"}
{"text":"Upscale wine bar offering tasty small plates to share. Very good wine list and varied tapas menu. On the wine side, I especially liked the \"trios\", combinations of 3 wines of the same \"family\", 2oz each. It is a great idea for those who want to try more than 1 different wines during the meal. Regarding the food, I definitely recommend the cheese plate, and also the carpaccio and the gravlax were amazing!"}
{"text":"I went there with my friends last Sunday. I know the reviews are good so I made a reservation. It turned out to be good too! We ordered a lot because we took it as dinner instead of some after dinner food with drinks. We ordered the snow crab, brownie, churros, lamb, quail, mini burger, salmon and a couple more. The sizes were small because we were supposed to taste different kinds of food. We didn't feel very full. I think the quality was great but it would be better to eat after having dinner."}
{"text":"A nice looking wine bar. However they force you to order food, which they didn't tell us until after we had finished our bottle of wine. When we ask for the bill is not the time to inform us that we are required to order food. Before we are seated would have been a better time. Unimpressed.   Still, a good place to go on a date, as I saw lots of couples around. The waitress who seated us was not very friendly, however our server was very nice, and knowledgeable.  $90 with tax and tip for a bottle of wine."}
{"text":"Great wine selection and a cool space to hang out. There are two floors, the second overlooking the first and the big windows in front. We had the goat cheese and red peppers with a couple glasses of red wine. A little on the pricy side, but worth it if you're looking for a guaranteed good glass of wine."}
{"text":"Très joli et sympathique petit bar à vin, à quelques pas de la station Place des arts. J'ai eu la chance de m'y rendre hier pour le 5 à 7. Comme la place venait presque tout juste d'ouvrir pour la soirée, j'étais complètement seule dans la salle. J'ai donc pu tout observer attentivement... L'ambiance était chaleureuse et la petite musique jazzy qui jouait y était pour beaucoup je pense. Un magnifique \" chandelier \" fait de verres à vin surplombe l'entrée, wow! Super original. On m'a fait prendre place à la mezzanine, sur une banquette assez confortable. Il me semble qu'il n'y avait pas énormément de places assises, mais juste assez pour donner une bonne ambiance quand le bar/restaurant est rempli. Le service auquel j'ai eu droit à l'accueil était exceptionnel. On a pris mon manteau pour le mettre au vestiaire, donc pas de gros vêtement d'hiver mis en boule sur mon siège pour m'encombrer.   Les serveurs se font un plaisir de présenter le menu, très diversifié d'ailleurs, et évidemment, de parler des différents vins offerts. Au verre, en trio, à la bouteille; blanc, rouge, bulles... Il y en a pour tous les goûts. Comme on s'y attendrait d'un endroit pareil situé dans le centre-ville, les prix sont un peu élevés, mais bon. La nourriture est délicieuse et le vin aussi. Comme il faut absolument prendre quelque chose à grignoter pour boire de l'alcool, j'ai choisi une petite assiette de ravioli, courge, ricotta et sauge. Quel délice! Ajouté récemment au menu, ce plat est déjà un incontournable, paraît-il... et je comprends pourquoi. J'y retournerai assurément pour essayer d'autres plats et vins. La carte est tellement bien garnie, les possibilités sont infinies!"}
{"text":"Amazing food (quail and grilled cheese were top notch).  Confusing wine selection.  I would say that the wines did not meet the high caliber of the food with which they were served.  Moreover, I was disappointed to not have the selection of South American and European wines that I expect from a wine bar."}
{"text":"Pullman's is a trendy and upscale wine bar, serving small tapas-style dishes that are great for pairing with your wine of choice.  Tapas worth ordering: Fromages du Quebec, Charcuteries, Fried Cod with Spicy Mayo, Sesame Scallops, Port-Steeped Cheddar Grilled Cheese, and Mini Bison Burgers with Matchstick Fries.  They have an extravagant list of wines, which is great because I absolutely love wine and am always curious about trying something new. For those interested in trying various types at once, they offer \"trio's\" based on wines by the same makers, regions, or of similar flavours, and this changes regularly.  A great wine worth ordering is the Cote de Brouilly 2009, from Chateau Thivin. It is a Beaujolais from Burgundy that is smokey, dark, well balanced, and full of great flavour.  The jazzy music and elegantly busy atmosphere makes for a great night, guaranteed. The bar is spacious and spread over 3 floors, while remaining cozy and charming. The beautiful chandelier built from wine glasses are worth mentioning, and hangs over the main floor. You would never guess that this gem was hiding within an odd-looking building, let alone right across the street from Provigo, but it is and I do not think it will be going anywhere anytime soon.  If you are ready to spend some money, then this is a great place to go. Whether it be on a date, a girls night out, or for a little group gathering, it is the perfect place. In all my experiences at Pullman, the service has been satisfying. On a few, very rare, occasions the service may have been slow, but never disappointing. You want to come here to sit back, relax, and take your time enjoying the wine, food, and ambiance. Do not rush it."}
{"text":"I love tapas lately, and right before heading back to Toronto, we decided to go to Pullman's before we hit the road. Good thing we got there as soon as it opened, because reservations are clearly a must for this popular spot. As soon as you enter, it is hard not to notice the huge chandelier made out of glasses!! Such a beautiful focal point.  The staff were nice and approachable. We were seated right away and given the wine menu as well as the food menu where you can check off what you would like to eat. I thought that was a great system. I decided to go with a glass of reisling and my boyfriend got the selection of three wines.   As per our food selection, we went with the following: marinated olives with candied lemon, fried calamari, charcuterie plate, mini bison burgers, marinated tuna and the quebec cheese platter. I found that that was a good enough quantity for two people. Everything was absolutely delicious. The fried calamari was very light, came with a green sauce that complimented it well. The marinated tuna was paired with apples which was very pleasing to the palette. The charcuterie plate was abundant and the blue cheese from the quebec cheese platter was a highlight. What a nice meal before a five hour trip home!"}
{"text":"Wonderful small plate tapas  and cocktails. It was a very comfortable place to find alone while sitting at the bar."}
{"text":"I walked into the wine bar and from what I had seen I was expecting to see the wine glass chandelier--a very lighting fixture.  I visit many wine bars across North America and Europe.  I have great experiences but I am rarely wowed.  I was wowed at Pullman.  It was few blocks from my hotel and in easy stroll for great food and a very nice wine list.  First the staff were gracious and exceptional.  Service goes a long way and to have great service lengthens a good memory to be a great one.  I started off with a glass of Les Pervenches Solinou 2013 this is a blend of Frontenac, Pinot Noir, Zweigelt, and Pinot Noir - so unexpected and I think it shows that Quebec is yet another region that produces beautiful and compelling wines.  Since this wine was completely unexpected I walked away craving to taste more wines from Quebec.  This wine matched the food I had ordered in particular the short ribs.   I had to order a Bourgogne--Domaine Billard Hautes-Cotes de Beaune 2013.  The next wine was Burja Vipaska Dolina Istrian Malvasia 2013 and the red wine I had was something I didn't expect.  Southard Wahluke Slope Stone Vineyard 2011--a gorgeous wine and from a region that is hard to find even in the US.  So between my courses of wine I ordered the cod brandade,  short ribs with superbly and nicely micro cuts of radish and mango, and the Italian meatballs.  I was dining alone and had plenty to eat.  Each dish presented was nicely plated.  And I drank my dessert - at the suggestion of the server I ordered Michel Gahier Macvin du Jura--a sublime, earthy-delicate wine; notes of beeswax, exotic citrus, dried Turkish fig and hint of freshly ground cardamom.    A very nice selection of wines and great food--I cannot wait to return."}
{"text":"So delicious! The quail was amazing pared with the green beans and truffle oil. The pavlova with fruit was a perfect end to the meal. The cocktails were perfect and all advice from the staff was spot on."}
{"text":"Impeccable service and attention to detail in the cuisine is A++ Everyone is very knowledgable about  pairing everything with the right wine."}
{"text":"Excellent wine and tapas bar. I loved everything about it!  I had 2 French wine that neither SAQ or LCBO carry. They were unique and delicious.  Tapas were all really tasty. 3 + 2 desserts were enough for 2 women.  Service and ambience were nothing but perfect!  I am in love with this place and would come back for sure!"}
{"text":"The service was very helpful and friendly as well as efficient. Whoever envisioned this restaurant has succeeded as the atmosphere was hip, but comfortable, energetic and lively but personal and with a good sound level. In addition, the food was creative and comforting at the same time. We started by ordering a trio of Pinot Noirs from the large and interesting wine list (many good ones by the glass). These were a nice showing of Pinot from different European areas and all were very nice in some way. We tried various small plates (goat cheese toast, cod croquettes, grilled cheese, gnocchi) - all were delicious especially the sliders with tiny potato stick frites. We had a great time in this restaurant and would recommend it anytime."}
{"text":"Delicious selection of wine and the foie gras is exceptional with buttered smoky brioche and fresh foie. Amazing service and great ambiance.  I want to go back here again!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Veronique, Bruno and Pasquale are so knowledgeable and friendly. The wine selections are wonderful. I had the opportunity to meet the winemaker from Joseph Swan and chat with him while tasting a flight of his delicious wines.  Order the grill cheese the bison burgers and the lamb cigars. amazing! Sad they didn't have the rabbit cavatelli anymore. They say the pasta is seasonal."}
{"text":"Location: Parc Avenue, above Sherbrooke. It's an easy walk from the downtown core (+/- 10 minutes). Parking will probably be an issue if you decide to drive.  The place: It's small and the layout is awkward.  After you walk in, there's a staircase that leads upstairs almost directly ahead of you, and if you hang a quick right, there's the bar and a few seats by the window. It's all very cramped. If you squeeze past all that, there's a downstairs bit too.   Decor/Ambiance: I didn't particularly care for either. Why? Because I didn't feel like there WAS a vibe. Maybe it was because I went right after work but I mean, it was a Thursday so you would think more people would be showing up between 5-7pm. They do have a kickass chandelier made from various wine glasses and champagne flutes thought. I mean, if that's your thing. The decor is ordinary and nothing to write home about.  The wine: I am not a wine connoisseur by any means, but I know what I like. Pullman has a very nice variety of wines from different regions that you can purchase by the glass or by the bottle. Take note - like any other place that sells wine by the bottle, they do so at inflated prices. I ordered a glass of white that was delicious - unfortunately I have no recollection of its name. And no, it's not because I was boozin'! Our waiter was very knowledgeable and made some great suggestions so kudos to him.   The food: Over. Priced. The theme here is tapas, so you can share your dishes or keep them all to yourself. I ordered the Mozzarella di Bufala with confit tomatoes and fennel. The portion was quite large and could easily be shared between 2-3 people. I did enjoy the dish, however the Mozzarella wasn't fresh and it was a little too cold for my taste. The tomatoes added a nice flavor, the fennel was well, fennel (I love fennel!), the vinaigrette  was a little too vinegary and the sliced capers seemed out of place in this dish. My friend had the quail, as well as the shrimp and Chorizo. I tasted this last dish and wasn't impressed. There was a weird flavor to it and the Chorizo was pretty darn firm and lukewarm. I then tried the goat cheese cheesecake with maple meringue, which was quite nice but the meringue was a bit dry and therefore crumbled very easily. You either had to take very slow and deliberate bites or shove the whole thing in your mouth, which just isn't ladylike. The maple meringue wasn't overly sweet but it seemed chilled. I would have liked it to be at room temperature.  Service: Meh. Despite 3-4 waiters hovering around the bar, it took forever to get service. One of the waiters kept walking by our table, looking me in the eye each time, but not once did he stop to ask if we needed/wanted anything. We had to get up and go get our bill as well.   The price: Inflated. For one glass of wine, the Mozzarella and the dessert, it cost me $40. No thanks. I can get better tapas and equally good wine at a place like Dolcetto and not break the bank.   If I could just go to Pullman for the wine, I might go back, but I think you have to eat to drink - or at least, you used to."}
{"text":"Pullman is a place you have to choose to go. It's not on the way to anywhere, and it's not close to anything else particularly. Consequently, It took me a long time to get round to going. But I loved it.  The decor is chic and comfortable, but not pretentious in any way. It attracts an eclectic clientele, with a wide range of ages. The music is present, and reasonably loud, but not so you have to shout, or even pay much attention to it (I really can't remember what was playing). It's the sort of place you can dress up to go, but at the same time, you won't feel under-dressed in jeans. (I wouldn't go in sports clothes though.) My only concern was that it is a tad on the dark side, which makes it difficult to read the tiny-printed menu when you're over 40...   The tapas-style food offerings are top quality. I tried the gravlax, the beet and feta salad, (served together), the charcuterie platter, and the beans in truffle oil, (also served together, which made for great marriages). There was plenty for two.  I had a yen for pinot noir, but was struggling with the very long wine list. The servers are billed as sommeliers, and definitely seem to know their wines. Ours suggested one I'd been hesitating over, but it turned out to be unavailable. She offered an excellent substitute at an even better price, so we ended up having two bottles! :-)  I don't know why it took me so long to get here. I think I feared it would be pretentious and disappointing, but honestly I found it exactly the sort of place I've been looking for for a while."}
{"text":"The cheese plate was handsdown the best, especially with the homemade sausage, rabbit pate we didn't touch though... The bison burger was good but not the best I've had. Ambiance is urban chic, loved the atmosphere. Great place for smaller parties as its not a huge space  We were visiting from so cal and the wait staff was really helpful n nice! Would definitely go again if back in Montréal!"}
{"text":"Great spot for drinks and apps. The drink menu consisted of several great tasting beverages. We ordered 6 dishes - by far the mini bison burgers were the best of the tapas."}
{"text":"I like pubs, but this place has a classier feel to it. It's a bit noisy but atmosphere is great. I ordered a lychee martini and these cute, expensive, but DELICIOUS churros that came in 7 3-4 inch pieces with chocolate sauce. They also sold mini burgers which were quite yummy as well. Food is definitely expensive, but prices of drinks is normal what they are usually worth. Service is decent and dress code is casual surprisingly for such a nice place! Would go again for a glass of wine instead next time."}
{"text":"Pullman is a haven for wine lovers, whether just learning about wine or connoisseur. They have a great selection of carefully-chosen bottles and also offer a nice variety of wines by the glass. You can also try a flight of wine that allows you to compare and contrast small glasses (2 oz) of three wines according to a certain theme. The tapas make a tasty snack to go with your wine (they're better for snacking than for a full meal). The atmosphere is trendy yet comfortable, and the chandelier made out of wine glasses is a beautiful centerpiece to the space. It's a good place for a date.  I was there recently and tried a flight of Cabernet Franc, all from different parts of the Loire. Those were some interesting reds. For dessert, we tried something rare and unusual: Macvin du Jura. Wines from the French wine region Jura are unusual enough anyway, but this one was pretty special - a late harvest wine that's been fortified. I was excited about the chance to try it. We also tried the cheese plate, which was well presented with each cheese served with some kind of fruit spread or nut that matched the cheese well. The olives were huge and took some work to get through. Next time, I would skip the curry hummus with vegetables. I guess I was looking for a heartier, more traditional hummus. My partner enjoyed the bison burgers. But go for the wine, not the food, and take the chance to try something different!"}
{"text":"We came in without a reservation on a friday night, so we had to wait a bit to be properly seated. The waitress kindly took our orders for some wine while we waited, so this was definetly a plus!  The menu had a lot of great ideas , so we ordered a few plates which were good, but nothing really blew our minds, except maybe for the gravlax plate. The ambiance though was reallllyyy nice, I mean really. Little candles, wine glass chandelier, confortable leathery seats. I could see myself grab a glass of wine there once again. The BIG downside of our night was the slow service. We came in at 8h20 and got out at 11h30. We dont really know what happened there, could be just a badluck but personnaly, I wouldnt go back for dinner, only for wine!"}
{"text":"The food was above average and exquisite. It's very small portion and a bit pricey. We should have eaten some food before we went there. My husband was still hungry when we left. Quite slow service."}
{"text":"I love the wine bar concept.  They have a really nice selection and a knowledgable and friendly wait staff.  A great place to go on your own and sit at the bar to have a glass or two and try out couple of tapas from their nice selection.  There isn't much around the neighborhood, so if it's too busy and can't get in you'll have to settle for much less. If I lived nearby, it would definitely become a local hangout, especially after a long day at work."}
{"text":"Great little spot. Especially in the incredibly rainy deluge we escaped from. This was my first visit to Montreal and the bar was listed in my guidebook. I love that it's an 'adult' wine bar. I'm not a big beer drinker and those kind of places seemed to proliferate Montreal. The crowd seemed to lean more English speakers when I was there. The bartenders are perfectly bilingual. But, there was a discrepancy with my drink. I asked if it was a an apple cider. The bartender said yes. It was clear when it was delivered that it was an ice wine. Much sweeter than I wanted. I asked to see a new menu and didn't touch my drink. There was no offer or check in on the ice wine. Yes, I could have asked on my own for something else. But, it would have been nice to be asked.  The appetizers were absolutely delish. Big, fat, wonderful olives. Great cheeses. I would definitely come back when in Montreal!"}
{"text":"Nice Cocktail and wine bar! Didn't get the chance to try the small plates but all the cocktails were delicious! I ordered the \"fresh 77 \"and the \"limeade alpine\"both were very nice. My boyfriend orders one whiskey drinks and seem to enjoy them. This place is perfect for dates or to catch up with friends . Very attentive server too! Will definitely be coming back during my next Montreal trip!"}
{"text":"A great great place to have dinner - I dont think there is anything on the menu that doesnt taste good - the highlights were the OLIVES - best olives you've ever had I promise you - grilled cheese, mini-burgers, truffled green beans, mixed vegetable sald - all great - had a wonderful riesling too - great ambiance as well  Beware of one of the hostesses that claim you must order food (even if you pop in for a drink) she claimed it was some law  - - yet the day before my dinner companion had done just that - ordered drinks without food......"}
{"text":"Twice I have gone to Pullman and to be honest, I was not really going for the tapas. It's just the perfect meet and greet spot. If you have ever experienced online dating, then you know meeting at the perfect spot is what sets the mood. Pullman has this relaxed atmosphere of people who want to drink and socialize, the appetizers are just breaks in those intimate moments of deep conversations. They say oysters and red wine are aphrodisiacs, luckily Pullman's has the best of both and a staff that is very knowledgeable about their alcohol (rare in most bars and lounges today). My only complaint is that three appetizers that my group ordered was never delivered, but who is counting when there is an abundance of champagne. You will enjoy yourself if you are in good company and forget how short the weekend is."}
{"text":"It's been a while, but I'm going to just say it: foie gras is better than sex.   And this foie gras was a world apart. Transcendent. The last time I had it this good was at my 23 birthday at Georges in Paris. Take that how you will.   They brought it out first. Because they knew.  The foie gras terrine had a layer of cherry to it and was split in two rectangular cubes on either side of the plate and both the foie gras and the bunch of perfect brioche triangles rested on a bed of apricot confit. The apricot was not sweet; it took me a moment to place it and I would not call it jam, more finely diced dried abricots. Creamy, rich and just right with the cherry & apricot elements, this should not be missed.  The mini bison burgers were tiny, juicy bites of perfection and the fries were a tiny cone of crispy, buttery goodness. The house sauce and pickle added tang to the burgers, sandwiched in their poppy seeded brioche mini buns.  Light and fresh, the ricotta gnocchi with tomatoes/basilic were tiny soft pillows, with an aromatically fresh sauce. Delightful and refreshing, if outshone by the other things we had.  Flight of Bordeaux, was presented with the bottles behind them, but before I had a chance to note them, they were whisked away. At least two of them were really good and gave a chance to sample more than I would have had as a full glass.  The Assiette de mignardises was an adorable display of tiny cookies/treats, from macarons to jammy squares to madeleines. Totally share-able (see photo).  This place is one of the reasons I cannot wait to go back to Montreal!"}
{"text":"It's difficult to give an accurate overall score because it's quite non cohesive in terms of decor, the style of food, and the service. If you're sitting at the front or on the first landing, it's about the best spots you can get. The back section of the restaurant looks like it's perpetually in need of renovation and looks like it wasn't meant to be opened to clients. The view isn't all that great either as the glaring bright Provigo grocery store sign is front and center across the restaurant. Decor gets a low 3* score from me.  The food was unique and it's supposed to be tapas styled and of a Canadian fusion influence.  There's enough variety in tapas choices from small bites to more savoury dishes. The food is nicely presented and the taste is intricate and thoughtfully put together for the most part. I would compliment them on the food presentation as it makes up for less cohesive restaurant decor. I would put that at 5*. The salmon gravlax didn't make too much sense to me in terms of how to eat it but it wasn't bad. As for the wait staff, I'm not sure if the lengthy delay between the dishes was intentional but it was a considerable wait after the first 2 dishes. One of the wait staff must've been impatient to get out of the resto so her service was very average but the other one serving us was nice and friendly. Service would get a 4*.  Crowd is mainly of a younger age group but a couple brought their child to eat there, which I would say it's not really a kid friendly resto. It's a pretty decent place (only at the front) for a date and as every dish is supposedly shareable it does require some negotiation for who gets what. 3 people eating makes it very tricky to split evenly so best to show up in pairs or someone will be short changed for their meal. Most recommend 3-4 dishes per person to be considered filling. Overall, I would say it's a unique experience, more on the pricey side especially if you throw in the wine.  It gets a 4/5 from me."}
{"text":"Great experience. 1st wine bar I've been too so I can't compare but the vibe is definitely in tune. Great selection of wine and tapas.  We had the Venison tartare & homemade chips along with fried calamaris. It was fresh and flavorful.   For dessert, we had the cannoli with biscotti were ok but not the place to have these.  Try it yourself"}
{"text":"Fantastic place. Great space, comfortable, good wine list, great service.   The tapas are essentially upscale bar food done very, very well. Grilled cheese, bison sliders, ricotta gnocchi, and the little duck pastries we had were all great.   Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Was in town for a quick business trip and had one evening to myself. Found this local gem and was so happy. Menu is good with enough choices whether it's meat, seafood, or veggies. Servings are on the smaller size so if you're with someone 4-5 choices should do the job. Plenty of alcohol in their selection, I had the rose. Ambience is nice with a second floor that adds nice touch with the lighting and comfort. Servers were very friendly and knowledgeable. Not speaking French is fine since they all know and speak English so I was saved. Would definitely go back again"}
{"text":"A solid 3 stars.  Wish I could give it a half more because it's right in the middle.  I've been to this place a number of times mainly because it's so crazy close to HGI. I really did like this place when I first went there.  Now having been there, say, 4 times, over the past couple of years my enamour is somewhat subdued.  Substantial wine list with some ecclectic choices if you're into buying bottles.  As single diner you still have a good selection of wines by the glass so no hardship.  The food is all small plate and that's fine because you get a chance to sample a bunch of different stuff.  Gets expensive as a single diner though.  This place is not cheap.  Have to say my favorite on the menu is the gravlax.  Shrimp with chorizo is salty and very tasty.  Bison sliders- okay.  Cod balls - near miss.  goat cheese with peppers - uninteresting.  Okay. so my base conclusion is that the food is good but not breathtakingly great.    Would I come back again?  Yeah, on a rainy or cold night it's a reliable place to go for sustenance.  But with so many excellent choices for a fine summer night?  Maybe I'll give it a few months before I come back."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and great wine selection, but the food wasn't to par.  Prices were very reasonable though. I would have paid a bit more to add some punch to the food.   My wife and I ordered the spiced nuts and goat cheese apps which were a good start with a bottle of cotes-du-rhone wine.   We then ordered the grilled cheese, bison sliders and arancini. The grilled cheese was good, but could have used a dip of some kind, a chipotle ketchup or an aioli. The bison sliders were much smaller than they seemed in the pictures on Yelp, which is not a big deal, but they were super dry and the flavor was not great. The fries that it came with were over cooked. The arancini was OK.   Finished with churros for dessert. Also ok.   I'd go back, but stick to drinks and possibly cheese and charcuterie plates."}
{"text":"Une (très) belle carte des vins, des serveurs attentionnés qui prennent le temps d'expliquer ce qu'ils servent, du tartare de cerf avec des chips maison, un grilled cheese au vieux cheddar, et un plateau de fromages, tout ça dans une ambiance posée... après une dure journée de travail, c'était exactement ce dont j'avais besoin !!"}
{"text":"Yelp did not steer us wrong when it sent us to Pullman.  Understated on the outside, very chic but comfortable on the inside.  I was surprised when they asked us if we had a reservation at 11pm, but the host quickly found us a spot.  I liked the feel of the downstairs bar itself, it was kind of U shaped, putting us facing and next to other patrons, with the bar tender making the magic in between.  The wine selection was great, and the server very helpful in helping me select which particular varietal I wanted.    I love wine bars that can pull off great wine with knowledgeable servers minus the pretention.  The crowd wasn't rowdy, but they definitely weren't reverently enjoying their Saturday night.  Next time I'm in Montreal, I'll be sure to go back here and get the food."}
{"text":"Based on what I heard, I'm somewhat a little disappointed. Far from being a connaisseur or critic, I found the service to be \"unstable\" and unreliable.  The food was OK, had some calimari that we're not cooked enough, mini burgers that had little or no meat with small fries that were way to dry.  Nice place but far from a 5 star, or even a 4 star..."}
{"text":"Too popular, and consequently too crowded. You can't just go for a drink. You also have to order a tapa or some other dish. Cocktails are pretty standard--nothing innovative. All things considered I don't endorse coming here for a dining/drinking experience. It's a rare thumbs down from me."}
{"text":"Pullman's is a decent tapas place but I've definitely had better. It was very dark in the front where we sat and we both had trouble seeing our food well. Right above us was a pretty cool chandelier with hanging wine glasses, I noticed they were all clear glass except one black one.  We got the croquettes, mini bison burgers, smoked salmon and cheesecake. The croquettes were nice and crunchy on the outside and very smooth and creamy on the inside. The mini bison burgers were very tasted but came with way too many \"fries\" which reminded me of some thin crispy things that came in a can that I used to eat as a kid. If they used half as many they would have gotten the same effect but they were too salty to eat all of them.  We also got a couple of Manhattan's that were well mixed but decided to move on to a different place for our next drink. The waitress and waiter were both very nice and good service is definitely a plus. The whole experience was pretty expensive and although the quality at Pullman's is good, I've had better for less cost."}
{"text":"Everything was good here, and I cannot say enough about our waiter. Easy 5 star review.  Mrs. Pinky and I arrived an hour early for our reservation, planning on having a few glasses of wine before our meal. Instead we ended up lounging at a table - they had seating available - and our waiter realized we were American. He chuckled at our broken French and spoke to us in English, quickly allowing us to become comfortable.  We are fairly easy to please, and he asked Mrs. Pinky what kind of wine she liked. She replied she was open minded and liked white wines, he said, \"I'll take care of you, I'll get you a flight of things I think you'll like.\" I said, \"I'll do the same... but for red wine, if I may?\" He happily obliged.  The dude nailed it. He made great recommendations that paired well with our food. I had a burgundy, a pinot noir, and a syrah. Mrs. Pinky has a riesling, a sancerre, and some interesting oxidized mixed berry wine that I can't remember. Everything was fantastic. We had the duck cavatelli, charcuterie plate, venison tartare, olives with candied lemon, and finished with the cinnamon churros and chocolate dipping sauce.   We were never rushed, the food was fabulous, the wine plentiful, and when we were ready to go our waiter took the time to recommend 5 or 6 different places we should go next. We took his advice and walked down to Mimi La Nuit in Old Montreal when we were finished.  Fantastic place, I highly recommend going if you're thinking about it."}
{"text":"We came in to simply have a drink and we abruptly asked if we had a reservation by one of the servers, before we could answer another server, presumably the manger, raced over to us to usher us back to the door giving us another place to go to (mumbled and not clear) opening the door for us to leave! We left quite shocked. I would never come back to this place despite all the recommendations given. Beyond rude service!"}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped here for a glass of wine before heading further up the street for dinner last week. Overall we were not impressed. Weird first impression: it looked closed from the outside because of the extremely low lighting inside. We were met at the door by a maitre d' who informed us, oddly we thought, that we were strongly encouraged to order some food from the menu and not just drink - something about \"respecting the spirit of the law\" or some such. Huh? Anyway, since we had some time to kill before our dinner reservation, we did decide to order a small plate with our wine. I don't even recall what it was, but we were hungry and it taste good.   Our server couldn't have been nicer and was genuinely well informed about wine. She made two solid recommendations based on what we each thought we were in the mood for. The red wines we ordered by the glass were adequate but hardly outstanding. But maybe this impression was made because both were served slightly chilled! We both found this odd and didn't understand why red wines weren't being served at room temperature.   Overall it was an experience that left us bewildered by the glowing reviews that Pullman has received on Yelp."}
{"text":"Great wine bar. Fantastic selection of imported wines. I always enjoy myself at Pullman. It's a trendy place that doesn't feel overly stuffy. I've sat at the communal tables on the ground floor a few times and ended up conversing with strangers. They have a small, but tasty munching menu to keep you full as you go to town on wine!"}
{"text":"Every single dish we ordered,  4 of them were outstanding. No weak links.  Rabbit confit, quail, duck and parsnip, mushroom and polenta."}
{"text":"This is as good as a wine bar gets. I would maybe drop it down half a star for the slight wait for our server when we first sat down, but I've been here twice while visiting Montreal, and I really adore it. I just love a good wine bar and this one is busy in a good way, has a chic modern vibe, and delicious small plates. They also accommodated our group of five at short notice on a weekend, which I appreciated. I love their unique bar setting. It actually made it really intimate and fun. The grilled cheese... I die..."}
{"text":"Im more than a fan I think i found yet another reason to come back to Montreal. This place reminds me of my favorite wine bar in Philly but bigger, better and with way more wine.We arrived to a pretty crowed space but soon found out there was a private party upstairs and sadly we were not invited.  The music was cool, the decor modern but chic and the people (patrons and servers ) were very pretty. After making our way downstairs we were seated at the bar and greeted by a very handsome man who wanted to pour us wine. The list by the glass was very impressive, Varietals from all over with a heavy concentration of my favorite wine producing country France (DUH) . All of the wines by the glass were under $15 and a few under $10 #winning . The snack menu looked promising but since we had just left dinner we only drank but i am very much in love with this place. We each had two glasses and the bill with tax and tip  came to under 40.00 #winningx2. This is for sure a date place and probably a great place to have pre dinner drinks or to start your girls night out."}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant with a fellow yelper a few months ago. She has described the foie gras as better than sex, and we agree to disagree on that one even though the apricot purée it came with was divine. Other than that, I found Pullman to be a great tapas restaurant with a huge selection of wines.   The wait staff was very helpful in pairing our food choices with wine as neither of us are necessarily wine connaisseurs and both very open to suggestions.  All in all, Pullman was a nice restaurant with some very decent food. I found it to be the ideal place to take a date and is probably good for all wine lovers out there."}
{"text":"Un mot : Merveilleux. On entre dans ce bar à vin et on plonge dans une atmosphère tamisée, légère, et chic. Nous sommes rapidement placés à une table de choix. Les serveurs sont au petits soins. Une carte pour les bouteilles de vin, une carte pour toutes boissons au verre, et 1 feuille où l'on doit cocher les tapas que l'on veut déguster se présente devant nous. Le choix est extrêmement varié en vin et autres boissons, la carte des tapas est plus sommaire, mais tout le monde y trouvera son compte, végétariens comme omnivores. Nous avons été servi par un sommelier formé à Toulouse, en France, et sa connaissance des vins était parfaite. Le vin est fabuleux, le service est rapide, et la qualité y est fantastique, de même pour les plats. La seule chose est que l'addition monte vite, mais bon, on savait pour quoi on payait ! De la grande qualité. Je recommande vivement. Pensez à réserver avant."}
{"text":"If you get a chance to visit Montreal you will be provided the opportunity to experience something very special.  Pullman is the one of the best, perhaps the BEST, wine bar I've been to, and I've been to quite a few.  Located in the upper district of Montreal, Pullman's facade does not immediately resonate a wine bar with a big reputation, but when you get serviced by the friendly and knowledgeable bar staff, you feel that there is something special and warm about Pullman.  Pullman has a great selection of wine to choose from. Like all good wine bars you can select your trio or set in your custom order, or you can be like me: rely on the expertise of people who are passionate about their work and wine.  Not only is the wine choice exceptional, the food choice, though limited, rivals some of the best fine restaurants in major U.S. cities. I'm a big fan of burgers and a bigger fan of mini-burgers called \"sliders\".  Pullman creates something smaller, but packs more flavor than a slider. Make no mistake, despite its size, this nano burger is a perfect size appetizer than is a perfect food pair to your wine flight.  So if you are curious about this great wine bar and live close to Montreal, Quebec (like you New Yorkers), don't make excuses and schedule a visit to Pullman."}
{"text":"The food was amazing! Well prepared, well cooked, and well presented. I highly recommend Pullman. Only reason why I took away one star was because the tables were so small."}
{"text":"We went on a Friday evening without a reservation and they were able to seat us at a cute little corner table (the last one available). We got two of the wine samplers and four small plates - seared tuna, grilled octopus, roasted quail, and gnocchi with veggies. The food was excellent! Perfectly cooked and well-seasoned. I didn't love the three wines I got but that was no fault of the restaurant. My husband's wines were fantastic. Overall it was a great experience!"}
{"text":"In this sexy wine and tapas bar, we sampled:  -Mini bison burgers - yum! -Asparagus with dipping sauce and sticks of brioche - okay! -Mini grilled cheese - HEAVENLY!!!  Great wine + fantastic grilled cheese = two great reasons to get your ass to Pullman."}
{"text":"Ah, a wine bar. Plus tapas! When I see either one of these categories I get very excited, so when they're combined you know I'm happy as a clam. On my last day of vacation, while Adam was executing the \"business\" portion of our trip, I chose Pullman as our final restaurant stop together. I'm totally happy with the decision and I'd definitely return.  First of all, Pullman is in a great location that was walking distance from our downtown hotel (right next to the amazing La Crepe 2 Go, which I'll review soon). The atmosphere is very chic and sexy. There's a gorgeous, sparkling, ornate chandelier right as you walk in, and there are many small tables and a little bar. We didn't go upstairs (but it looked fabulous up there like the rest of the restaurant) - we walked down a little half staircase to our own tiny table. And I mean tiny... Adam even had to share a stool with the person behind him. It was meant to be shared, of course, but it's just super close quarters. We had trouble fitting our food, plates, silverware, wine, and water on our table since it was literally like a 2X2 foot square. It was really lovely though - with only a little light from a single candle. Romantic and cozy.  Our waiter did a great job talking about the wine and making recommendations. You can get little 2 oz pours of several wines for $4.5-$7 CAD each, a 4 oz glass for $8-$15ish, and a flight of three 2 oz pours for $22ish. We stuck with a regular 4 oz glass, and our favorite was a white from Slovenia. We mentioned to the waiter that we're not picky about wine as long as it isn't sweet, and he told us \"there's no sweet wine on our menu.\" Well, good!  For dinner we had the cheese board, the charcuterie board, and the Piri Piri short ribs. Ohhhhh man, I was in heaven. There were 4 very different and beautiful cheeses paired with 4 accompaniments (pureed fig, apple, some other kind of fruit jelly thing, and a walnut paste). The charcuterie board was AMAZING with 2 incredible sausages, prosciutto, duck, pate, a mustard cream sauce, grapes, and cornichons. The piri piri short ribs were phenomenal - the sauce was super spicy, but not overbearing. Nice portions and plenty of food to share on each plate. Plus, these tapas are definitely affordable. I'd say most items were between $8-$12. Beautiful meal and setting all around."}
{"text":"Good tapas plates. Great wine list.  Good cocktails.   Decent service. A bit snobby for the quality....which is just ok."}
{"text":"I love their wine options. The first time I went, there was an event happening where they had wine from Oregon. The owners of the vineyards were actually in the bar, and we got to talk to them while drinking their products. Super cool!   They have a great selection of appetizers and shared plates, also countless types of wines are available. I ended up finding one of my favourite red wines from this place. I think I like this place when they have their events, like the aforementioned Oregon wines, but it's a great spot to go to if you're around the area."}
{"text":"Get their l'assiette du fromage! My boyfriend and I stopped here before going elsewhere for dinner, and shared the cheese plate. They have some really good cheese and confiture pairings! My boyfriend admitted he's usually not a big fan of blue cheese, but he loved it paired with fig. I also enjoyed their nut purée to go with one of the other cheeses. The service was also incredible - and a good chance to practice my French!"}
{"text":"By far one of my favourite wine bars in Montreal! Not only is the selection of wines outstanding, the staff is super knowledgeable as personable, and the food is always amazing.   During my last visit, the girls and I ordered a bottle of orange wine \"Rkatsiteli\", which was amazing, and a whole bunch of plates to share starting with a charcuterie board, and then the octopus, tuna tataki, grilled cheese, bison sliders, and duck. We finished off with all three desserts on their menu including the churros, truffles, and apple beignets. Every dish was super tasty, well prepared and well seasoned; I fell in love with their grilled cheese and the truffles were perfection! We where having such a great time, thanks to the great laidback vibe of the place, that I didn't even get a picture of everything!   Let's not forget the service which was super professional, friendly and quick! The wait staff knows their menu and more importantly, their wine.   I've been to this spot multiple times and this surely wasn't my last. Their wine list and seasonal plates are changed up frequently so you'll always find something new to try; trust me you won't run out of wine options when you see the book of wines they present you to choose from. Can't wait to go back already!"}
{"text":"Definitely a notable and repeatable stop for me while in Montreal.  Not only do they have one of the most fantastic wine menus I've ever seen, they also have some tremendous amuses-bouches to pair it with.  Aged grilled cheese with a crips apple wine on a rare and balmy summer afternoon is heaven.  A nice glass of red wine with snow slamming against the windows takes the pain off the winter cold.  Make sure to look up and admire to painstakingly assembled cocktail glass chandelier.  I always tip extra when I think the poor employees are probably forced to clean it..."}
{"text":"I was traveling with my boyfriend and his Belgian family and I was in charge of choosing restaurants and booking reservations. They love to have aperitif so I suggested we go to Pullman for some wine and snacks before dinner. Since they love wine and are pretty knowledgeable about it this place was great. They got to try some nice wines and we had some delicious cheese and charcuterie. It was the perfect pre-dinner place. It was even mentioned that this was their favorite bar on the whole trip.  Nice decor and good service. It was a pretty elegant place with a relaxed environment. Would be a nice date-place or girls night.  A bit pricey so I would suggest going here expecting to pay a lot"}
{"text":"Pullman is my favorite wine bar! I love the style of the place and the small bites food are very tasty. It's quite affordable too, if you're not too hungry. They always have nice wines by the glass to propose, wines you can't find anywhere else it seems. The only thing that bumps me is that the seem to follow some ambiguous wine trends. Orange wines..... natural wines.... It's not exactly my favorite trends. it's a good thing it's not exclusively those so everyone can find something they like."}
{"text":"If I was rating just based on what else can be found in a couple blocks circumference I'd go higher, but this is Montreal, you can walk, bixi, stcum your way to all kinds of fun. This place has nice atmosphere, but on the plain side, aside from the one chandelier made from wine glasses. Dim and romantic though. Perched on the couch on the second floor tasting wines and eating cheese and charcuterie I'm quite happy, don't get me wrong, and I totally love the staff here. It just doesn't swoon and thrill me somehow. But I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Pullman is sophisticated and elegant but somehow I am never quite satisfied with the decor and ambience- it's a little safe and predictable. Their staff is very knowledgable and respectful and service is excellent.  If nothing else, come here for a glass of the Domaine Belluard 'Le Feu' white wine. It's quite wonderful."}
{"text":"cool place for wine. not sure why you cant just order wine..we had to order the nuts 1 night and the olives the other night..not that tasty..wine was great"}
{"text":"This was the first time I ever ate tapas before. I went with 5 other people, and we ordered everything on the menu twice! It was amazing. The Booze was a little to high.  Had a little problem with the meat sirloin plate being extremely raw."}
{"text":"Admittedly, we went to Pullman more for the food than the wine and the food was delicious - we enjoyed everything we ordered.  The location was very convenient for a dinner after the movies with our son, a McGill student. However, the atmosphere was very uncomfortable, maybe too trendy for our 50-something age.  Music too loud and when we complained we were graciously moved downstairs where the music was no quieter.  Strangely the hostess suggested we might have to move to a 3rd table when another party arrived (though the restaurant was not crowded) - we declined! Tables were uncomfortable with odd angles and no way for our party of 3 to sit comfortably."}
{"text":"We came in for some end-of-night drinkies and maybe something sweet.  I loved this place except for the champagne switch-a-roo.  My friend and I wanted a glass of champers and there was only 1 on the menu.  The guy comes back and says they're fresh out but he would open a bottle of something else but its $2 more.  Hmmmm.  I think he should have charged us the same rate but oh well.  The other friend got a beer that he liked.  We tried 2 desserts.  They were both good but one was a front runner.  The brownies.  Wow.  Little scrumptious bites in this yummy sauce.  Yummers!  We also tried the churros and chocolate.  They were ok.  Little churros baby churros in a pudding.  I wanted the chocolate to be richer like they do in Spain.   Our hotel was right across the street.  I'm surprised we only went here once!  Its a great place if you want just a glass or a flight to try."}
{"text":"Food was amazing. Atmosphere was very chic and fun. Especially recommend the mini grilled cheeses. Staff was wonderful, timed our courses perfectly, and made amazing wine recommendations. I'd recommend making a reservation if you have a large party, because the space for large parties is limited. Not to say you shouldn't bring a larger group there, because everything is perfect for sharing. Would definitely return."}
{"text":"The food was great. Wine selection was fantastic. Just like other reviewers stated, it was very crowded. We actually made a reservation for three and got seated at a tiny two-person table in the front of the bar. Everyone there seemed to know each other and they just kept crowding in.   That being said, the bison sliders were awesome. The lemon squares for dessert were fantastic."}
{"text":"I'd give it 3.5 stars if I could. From the other reviews I was expecting a more dramatic space. Just had a few glasses of wine though and a cheese plate. No dinner."}
{"text":"Pullman is the ideal place to take your gf/bf or a date.  It has a smooth charm to it, allowing for a relaxed yet sophisticated atmosphere.  A perfect vibe to enjoy some of their great selection of wine.  The eating menu is tapas style and nothing impressive.  This is more a place you'd go after a meal to chill and drink some wine! The post-meal hangout!"}
{"text":"beautiful smart place to drink good wine. a bit expensive, but worth it."}
{"text":"We've been here 3 times and the menu has changed. We were told the chef changed twice over the past 3 months. This time we were disappointed with everything. The chorizos was not comparable to the original dish that was served here. The green beans were as good as they were the first time. The service was good but the food not so good. Wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"Nice, cozy wine bar that also serves tapas. Great place for groups of 2-4 to drink wine and chat. The wine list is extensive and the waitress is helpful with selecting.   The food was just overcooked. We ordered 5 tapas, of which 4 were over cooked. All of the food had potential in flavors otherwise. The shrimp and chorizo dish, bison burger, Italian meatballs were all tough because of overcooking. We ordered a pastry item that had cheese and bacon stuffing and that was just very dry. Perhaps with some sort of dipping sauce, it would be better. The best dish was a spinach pasta with clams and lobster bisque. The pasta was tasty and cooked to just the right temperature and was al dente. The clam was overcooked and chewy.   Overall, nice selection of wines, decent service, but food was lacking. Maybe go for some wine and a charcuterie plate."}
{"text":"This was a great place to eat and to enjoy the wine. Our server was awesome and did a fantastic job pairing our desert with wine. I would definitely come back and enjoy it again."}
{"text":"I had such a wonderful experience here! I just wandered in after having dinner down the street. I am a wine novice, and was traveling solo through the area, so I didn't have a friend to make any recommendations for me. I informed the bartender of this, and he asked me a few questions, then brought me a wonderful glass of wine - you have to love that level of expertise and service!  I also got the sweet confections sampler platter and it was to die for. I would come back for the blondie brownies alone! Delicious!"}
{"text":"We had a wonderful date night at Pullman's. The ambience is very nice, although very dimly lit. The wait staff was prompt and accommodating- giving us great wine suggestions to accompany the meal. Large selection of wine and other alcohol (even orange wine!). The oysters were some of the best I've had in a long long time! And if you go, you MUST try the mini bison burgers- SO flavorful! Just all around a great experience."}
{"text":"So apparently they are really serious about the reservations here.   I walked in and asked for a single seat. Hopeful that they would allow me to experience their restaurant for just 25 minutes.  I was asked promptly if I had a reservation, I said no, but this never deterred me in the past at any restaurant with open seats. The first staff member said \"no problem, just one moment\"  A few seconds later a second staff member walked up and said \"I am sorry, we are fully booked, and we are booked all night\"   I look over and point to the bar and ask \"even at the open seats at the bar?\"   She said \"yeah even at those open seats, we book them too...\"   So I walked away with a dry mouth and an appetite.   Thanks for nothing..."}
{"text":"Lovely wine collection. From the first moment I stepped in the ambiance of the walls and the magnificent chandelier mesmerized me. For finger food I recommend their mini burgers. For wine, I have never been disappointed by their mini samplers. Great place! It's a must see place in my book: the perfect place to enjoy fantastic sips of wine over lovely conversation with friends"}
{"text":"Came here with my girlfriends for drinks on a rainy Saturday night, circa, 11pm. We were asked if we had reservations....at 11pm? Seriously!? The hostess took us upstairs in a cramped space, where we shared a seating bench with a couple sitting next to us, and our friend sat across from us in a chair...our table was narrow, and frankly, the whole set up wasn't very comfortable. The waitress came by to take our order and she was delightful. We ordered a cheese plate, and olives to accompany our drinks. I ordered a Negroni, while my friends ordered a glass of Chianti each. The \"chef\" came out with our dish and to explain exactly what we were getting, and he did so graciously. The cheese plate in question also had a variety of spreads to balance out the taste of each cheese---the spreads were coing, walnut, and fig. Everything was good and the service, was impeccable. Besides the seating arrangements, the overall experience was pleasant. A definite do for a quick drink and bite!"}
{"text":"Wonderful staff and tapas, plus wonderful wine and wine knowledge by our waitress.  They took mercy on us non-French-speaking Americans and we had a great first meal in Montreal at  Pullman.  We reserved via Open Table and were put in a back room away from the funky chandelier, but no matter--totally a great meal."}
{"text":"Dear winos, I have been here numerous times and the only disappointment I ever faced was their deep fried tapas.  Now taste wise, everything I ever had was pretty darn delicious.  Just avoid the calamari and grilled cheese...soaked in oil!  Besides that downfall, they change up the menu ever month and always have a huge selection of wine. I definitely recommend this wine bar for a couple or tasting since they offer wine tasting with a good price.  Yes, you should go...get their goat cheese, its always my first choice and always so delicious! Mmm"}
{"text":"Great date place. Amazing drink selection; I especially recommend the sake martini, which is seriously addictive. The food is tapas-style and incredible. Ambience is very nice, with great decor and a giant wine glass chandelier. The price is pretty high, though, so may be better suited to a special night out than being a regular haunt. At busy times, best to make a reservation beforehand."}
{"text":"This wine bar has an excellent location, close to downtown hotels. It has a very nice layout with many small rooms, each with a distinct vibe. The wine list is extensive with something for everyone. There were four of us, we ordered nine dishes in all. The dishes are for sharing but some are quite small, so we ordered two of the same in some cases.  My top 4: Steak - Perfectly tender, medium rare, on creamy mashed potatoes. Green beans - Precisely cut, perfectly cooked and nicely seasoned. Scallops - Only two, cooked medium rare, nicely seared Bison sliders: What can I say? Awesome!!  Service is warm and friendly with good table maintenance as there is a team approach.  A cool spot for 5-7 and late night tapas."}
{"text":"Using Yelp abroad has been an occasional challenge.  I was looking for something close to the Place D'Arts for a pre show dinner. Initial search results were some of the more popular spots that had mixed reviews.  I find that going to the area and searching nearby has been more helpful. I came across Pullman and was pleasantly surprised. This bi-level restaurant with warm, but modern decor, serving a tapas menu was a great find. I was solo, so sat at the bar and Veronique took excellent care of me. From helping me choose some of their popular dishes, to pairing with wine, I had a great experience. The fluke tartare and the crispy lamb were standouts. If you are seeing a show in the area, get away from the crowded touristy spots around the venue and stop here instead."}
{"text":"Delightful small plates and great service. The five of us had about 10 different dishes from charcuterie to duck ragu to mushroom tart. We all raved about something delicious and the favorite dessert was the pear and date cakes."}
{"text":"Wine list is nice and updated, the sommeliers really know their stuff here and can offer you the best pairings. Couldn't ask for better food or ambiance either!"}
{"text":"Dimner for two. Grilled cheese and bison sliders were excellent. Don't forget the churros dessert. Excellent service and amazing food....."}
{"text":"I loved this wine bar for its simple ambiance and a fine collection of wines and small plates to go with it. The staff is very professional and meticulous about their job. They took our heavy winter jackets as soon as we walked in. It should also be mentioned that every single wine glass is cleaned and polished to perfection! I would definitely go back here to taste great wines and enjoy the coziness of Pullman."}
{"text":"Quelle déception lorsqu'on attend depuis des mois pour essayer un endroit et que l'on reçoit un piètre service, de quoi franchement vous passer l'envie de le suggérer et d'y retourner. Depuis des mois, je passe devant ce fameux bar à vins et je n'ai entendu que de bons commentaires alors j'avais peut-être des attentes un peu hautes, mais bon... L'accueil fut courtois, on nous a mis dans la section du 2e étage, le serveur est venu tout de suite nous voir afin de véifier si nous avions des questions sur le menu et prendre notre commande. Comme nous voulions différentes bouchées il nous a recommandé de séparer en 3 nos commandes: entrées, plats plus conséquents et desserts. Bonne idée non ? Et bien pas trop quand il faut attendre une heure entre les deux services, que personne ne passe nous voir, ne nous propose de verres d'eau et que l'on doit courir après le serveur pour un menu.... Vraiment une déception quant au service reçu. Quand j'ai fait part de mon mécontentement, le serveur s'est excusé à plusieurs reprises, puis me dit qu'il met un rush sur la nourriture.... EUH tu me niaises c'est pas déjà fait depuis belle lurette!! Bref, on crève de faim, dans un endroit vraiment charmant, avec un décor intimiste. Le serveur aurait pu faire un geste commercial pour se faire pardonner et pour nous donner envie de redonner à l'établissement une 2e chance.  Pour ce qui est de la nourriture, on a vu mieux, on a vu plus original. Prix raisonnables, mais des portions assez minuscules. Côté goût je n'ai pas été impressionnée, le chorizo ne goûtait pas particulièrement bon et il était accompagné de légumes marinés simples (carrottes et autres). Le tartare de cerf était pas mal mais les chips en accompagnement archi grasses et salées. Le mini burger était tellement petit qu'on ne se rappelle même pas si c'est bon ou pas. Les churros quant à eux à la cannelle étaient très bons mais dommage que le chocolat qui l'accompagnait soit froid, cela se prend chaud de préférence.   Donc on y va pour l'ambiance, pour le côté intime et chaleureux, mais on essaie d'avoir un meilleur serveur ou on prend son mal en patience."}
{"text":"There is a reason why I continue to go back to this place after 10 years. The hospitality is on point and the selection of wine seems indefinite. Weather you're in search of a casual night out with friends or an intimate date, this is a great spot if you're a fan of wine."}
{"text":"Loved!  Recommend the brandade of cod and lots of the other small plates were great but now it's a month later and I can't remember. But you can go wrong. Very cool chandelier made of wine glasses."}
{"text":"One of my favorite wine bars in the world. Wonderful selection of wine. Constantly changing seasonal menu with delicious tapas. The service is above and beyond generous. We always have a lovely time. It's a classy date night destination. Take the love of your life or take your friends. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"We didn't come for the drinks, but the wine menu looks terrific. Lots of options no matter what type of wine you prefer. We were very happy with all of our orders, especially the mini burgers with bison meat and matchstick fries and the salmon tapas (my apologies, the name is eluding me). Six tapas for two people was enough. Service was great and the recommendations were on point."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed everything we ordered here, my personal favourite was probably the calamari.  Didn't get a chance to order any alcohol here so can't comment on that.  Kind of pricey but about on par with other tapas.  Everything is well presented and fresh. Griddled cheese was also surprising tasty.   The atmosphere of the place definitely has an upscale vibe and you feel like everything is brand new, including the awesome chandelier hanging from above.  Much bigger on the inside than it looks like from the outside. Service was good too."}
{"text":"While visiting Montreal, we were lucky enough to have a few friends from Boston also visiting at the same time as us and we all met up at Pullman from another friend's recommendation! I was pleasantly surprised :)  We shared a bunch of small plates, which is absolutely what I recommend doing, so individual meals could get pricey. The thing I loved most about Pullman was the ambience and décor inside. So chic and modern - it didn't feel like the rest of Montreal that we had explored. Super friendly waitress and host staff. Drinks were strong!"}
{"text":"Un des meilleurs bars à vin à Montréal, localisé dans un petit local sur Avenue du Parc, près de Sherbrooke, nombreux vins + menu tapas, bel intérieur moderne, design + urbain. Service correct et professionnel. C'est un ''win-win'' ^_^ Vous aussi vous allez aimer ! Enjoy !  5/5 visité en juillet 2014."}
{"text":"I came here for the MTL a Table event since people spoke good things about this place. The location is quite dark , and the chairs/seating is quite uncomfortable. Our watiress was really friendly and really knew her selection of wines. I give them 5 stars on that. However, the food was mediocre and I wasn't really \"wow'ed\" I felt like the menu didn't have much vareity and I was surprised there was no fish or chicken options. We chose the moka brownies which were horrible and tasted like dry/badly done from a box cake mix. I wouldn't really return to this place."}
{"text":"Went here for a drink and a light meal after getting into Montreal at 11 pm on Thursday - I was surprised to find it nearly empty!   The food was just ok - the arancini was bland and the goat cheese tasted too mild to be pure goat cheese.   I also had a few glasses of wine - I like that you can order just 2 oz so that you can try more wines, although there isn't an extensive list of options by the glass."}
{"text":"Ce lieu est axagérément surclassé pour son putain de lustre à 2 bals accroché au plafond.  Je suis un grand amateur de vins mais quelle déception sur la sélection ! Aucuns grands noms. Que des choix alternatifs.  Sur le peu de choix, les vins ne sont pas terribles voir mauvais. On ne nous sert pas depuis la bouteille devant nous (c'est moyen quand même on aimerait voir les étiquettes svp). On nous fait goûter et puis les verres apparaissent comme par magie (on se fout un peu de la gueule du client... il sort d'où ton vin?).  Les verres étaient mal lavés (peluches de torchons dedans) et même en demandant de nouveaux verre c'était juste la même chose en moins pire.  Le plateau fromage est nul à chier. La sélection n'est pas adaptée pour s'associer avec du vin. C'est sec comme tout. Le pain servi n'est pas du pain frais mais de fines tranches grillées et toutes sèches. L'ambiance est vide et surfaite.  La salle est minuscule et l'acoustique est horrible. Ça résonne et les tables sont tellement rapprochées les unes des autres que vous allez pouvoir savourer toutes les conversatuons des gens vous entourant. Aucune intimitée.   Un lieu à éviter absoluement pour une date !  Ça appatera certainement une clientelle d'ignorants et un peu superficielle de gens prêts à payer pour un putain de lustre au plafond.  Je n'y remettrai pas les pieds. On trouve beaucoup mieux, moins cher et plus chaleureux ailleurs et sérieusement... tout ça est un gros foutage de gueule.  Parole de bourguignon et ma copine de Hong Kong pense la même chose."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic! Either our party of four was just lucky ordering the best dozen tapas items or there isn't  a bad dish on the menu! Highlights were the buffalo tartare, polenta, crab cakes and tuna. And rhubarb pannacotta.   Impeccable service upstairs (tonight June 2).    We would have posted photos except the place is rather dark - almost too hard to see the menu let alone photograph our dishes."}
{"text":"This is a classy bar, with a varied assortment of snacks, and other food items. While ambiance and decor lend to add stylishness and 'class' to the establishment, the service is primarily mediocre. Space is a bit concerning, but if you don't mind spartan seating in a dim-lit corner, then it poses no issues. It is the space issue that proved rather burdensome (having to get up a few times to accommodate servers passing through can be a bit undesirable - but it was busy, and the staff did ultimately accommodate us). It's definitely romantic, and I'd recommend it, even if it is just grabbing a glass of wine with your partner."}
{"text":"This place has a lively atmosphere and a chic industrial decor. The drinks are good but expensive (cocktails 10-20, beer 6.60 and up). The food is dressed up pub food served on small plates but it's reasonably priced (7-14 per tapa plate).  We showed up on a Friday night without a reservation and were served little glasses of complimentary wine while we waited. I've been there more than once and I would go again, but I haven't written home about it. Only this review."}
{"text":"Arrived in Montreal late after a drive there from New York. We wanted an intimate wine bar with small plates and this place fit that description exactly! I got a caiparinha and it was way too strong I needed to ask for them to add club soda but I guess I can't criticize that too much since I think this is more of a wine place. We got the raw scallop and my boyfriend said it was the best scallop dish he's ever had! We also got the venison tartare which was great but the chips could have used some more salt. The bison sliders had a nice punch of flavor. Overall a great place and I will recommend it to friends who visit Montreal."}
{"text":"It so happens that my male friends frequently ask me where to take a girl they like on a first date, and even though I like to try new things and branch out and be original, I always say: Take her to Pullman. And they always get laid.  Kidding! I actually haven't been able to keep track of how successful they've been. That's how often I recommend Pullman!  I think every server must be a sommelier because they are so knowledgeable about the wine, and they never try to trick you into getting something just because it's more expensive. In fact, they make you feel like it's really normal to be mildly concerned about the price by casually asking you for a range when suggesting a bottle.  The food is great, and I don't know why I love ticking my order off a paper menu with a pencil so much, but maybe it's because it feels like a little personality quiz. It's interactive, and with one menu and one pencil, you know you're sharing the food with your date. They always have oysters and there is a flight of sparkling wines on the menu, so aphrodisiac central for those of you looking to seal the deal.   Maybe it's more of a third date place. I don't know. I won't judge you either way."}
{"text":"Pullman, tu m'a sauvé du froid et de la grêle! C'était en mars dernier que je venais à ta rencontre après une longue semaine de travaille. Je suis sortie à a station Place des Arts, puis j'ai commencé à marcher vers toi. En fait, je pensais que je marchais vers toi mais après 15 minutes, je me suis rendue compte que j'étais complètement perdue.  Avec l'aide de quelques étrangers, et après un autre 30 minutes de marche, je t'ai enfin trouvé et tu m'as tout de suite réchauffé avec ton ambiance chaleureuse, ton décor à la fois moderne et éclectique, puis tes bancs confortables.  Quelques instants plus tard, tu m'a emmené un bon verre de vin d'Italie (je ne me souviens pas du nom, j'étais trop occupée à regarder tes beaux yeux). J'ai partagé mon verre avec mes amies qui avaient aussi reçu chacune une coupe différente. Un grill-cheese nous a permis de se faire un p'tit fond pour profiter d'une deuxième ronde de purs délices.  Merci de m'avoir réchauffé de haut en bas, jusqu'aux petites orteilles!"}
{"text":"So sad to have had a bad experience at Pullman. We were 4 people who had traveled all day and decided to stop in for a late snack (10pm) and a glass of wine. The welcome was chilly. The upstairs was so dark we had our phones out for lights to see the menu. We brought a candle from a nearby table. When the waitress arrived she told us they don't usually have a candle on that table but she'd let us keep it. The wine was lovely, but just wanted out of there as soon as our light meals were finished. Reading other reviews, I'm wondering if the problem is a particular staff member and not the usual level of service. Sad opener to a delightful stay in usually friendly Montreal."}
{"text":"Delicious! Great service, decor and ambiance.  the wine list was extensive and we had a great bottle of French rose. Service was very friendly. And food was great. We ordered a bunch of tapas , as we wanted to try a lot of different things. From bison to calamari they have a bit of everything on their menu.  This restaurant was recommended by a friend in our group and did not dissappoint. Montreal really has good food, everywhere we went was nice food. Pullman is a cool, trendy spot but the food is also on point.  We ordered calamari, green beans, beet salad, lamb brisket empanadas, bison sliders,chorizo and shrimp and other stuff i can't recall....everything was tasty. We had a great time. Definitely recommend. As far as prices, it was reasonable for all we ordered."}
{"text":"Wonderful service.  Great selection of beverages.  We enjoyed brandade one night, and the chocolate truffles (amazing) the other.  Lovely, chic ambiance.  Great for a light meal, or an after-dinner drink.  They do require that you purchase food, not just a  beverage.  Would definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Good service and food. Wine list was good but the cocktails are just ok. Seating is comfortable and the restaurant is much larger on the inside than it appears from the street.  A bit on the pricier side, but overall worth it."}
{"text":"The Pullman is a hidden gem,  It a classy winery that has a cool plateau feel to it. It is mainly french The wine list is quite extensive and the staff is knowledgable and able to guide you to try what wine suits your pallet. For a non meat eater, it is difficult to find something to eat but if you don't mind eating cheese, there is a huge selection of cheese. A quick tip: try to get a seat upstairs, downstairs there is more traffic and people are always moving."}
{"text":"Non non non et non! Très déçue de ce restaurant qu'on m'a chaleureusement recommandé.  Personnel antipathique, aucun effort dans la présentation de nos plats, le goût n'est pas la... les plats sont très fades... la meilleure chose que j'ai mangé ce soir est un grill cheese! Autant vous dire que pour le prix demander je vais aller le faire chez moi!  Concernant la carte des vins, en effet elle est très variée, par contre aucun conseil sur le choix que vous allez faire, un peu cheap pour un endroit qui se qualifie de \"bar à vins\"... Pour la deco, ca vaut le détour... ambiance chantier pas fini! Bref, vous l'aurez compris, très très déçue de mon expérience... pourtant le concept était prometteur... C'était la première et la dernière que j'ai mis les pieds dans cette endroit!"}
{"text":"Disappointed!! Recommended by hotel staff to come here, small portions, under poured our wine glasses by a long shot.  Upon sitting down, the waitress had the audacity to say you'll have to order something , after only being in the restaurant for 2 minutes!!! Maybe it's a misunderstanding between French and English but she spoke English well.  I look expensive , I'm fit, and attractive no need to ask that honey I ordered a charcuterie , a cheese plate and bison burger sliders, which by the way were über greasy and uber tiny I felt like I was eating my toddlers portion.  Ugh bummer first night in the city and my view was a bunch of real housewives from New York City having a drunken ol time.  Next time going to the quaint romantic better view of Old Montreal."}
{"text":"To be clear on my expectations for this place, I was essentially hoping for a more intimate version of Papillon bar in St Henri. From the looks of it and what friends had told me was this establishment had really taken it up a notch.  Needless to say, the food and wine were fantastic. The waiter, when she was available, was very helpful with the wine selections and was very friendly. My only major qualm with the place is that for a table of mid-twenty-somethings we were likely the youngest and tamest people there. It seemed that the place turns into a rowdy happy hour joint for middle aged professionals around 6. At certain points during our visit, I couldn't hear my partner across the tiny table at all over the cackling of other groups.  This place would probably be a lot of fun for a large wine-lovin' group, but as an intimate date spot I would probably head elsewhere."}
{"text":"Three of us described what kind of wine we like, and the sommelier suggested a few wines to try. We had two glasses each and loved all of them. We also ordered a cheese place, olives, mini burgers and chocolate with churros. Everything was very very good and came to 112 US Dollars. That is an excellent value for money."}
{"text":"I have been a occasional client of theirs over the last 4 years, they have a great space with an a very cool vibe and decor.  The wait staff is very charming and helpful and they know wines very well.  I would describe this place as a wine / tapas place, they have a huge selection by the glass, and their bites are always fun and tasty.  The bill can go up fast with those little bites so beware of your orders, but the fun filled evening,the bites and wine themselves are definately worth it."}
{"text":"If you're familiar with the types,of wines on the menu, or your tastes align with theirs, it's likely a great place for you.  For me, who likes a buttery Chardonnay, not so much. They have nothing like that on the menu, and when the server offered to make up a flight with my taste in mind, it failed miserably. When I expressed my dislike of 2 of them, the server was condescending in his comment about trying to 'educate' me.  I don't care to pay to be talked down to -- no matter my tastes."}
{"text":"Extensive wine list; delicious and nice variety of tapas; very, very noisy.  Excellent service."}
