{"text":"I grew to appreciate Vietnamese food after graduating college. I was living in an are up north that had a sizable Southeast Asian community, and there were at least six Vietnamese restaurants within walking distance of my house. Not having a lot of spare cash coupled with the fact that the Vietnamese eateries were quite affordable meant that my friends and I would quite often find ourselves with bellies full of pho and vietnamese iced coffee. Fast forward many years later and I'm glad to find that there is an excellent choice for Vietnamese food a quick hop from my current abode.

I've been to dine at Saigon Palace close to a dozen times and it has been consistently good. The staff has been friendly, the service great, and the food has been extremely tasting and satisfying. The Pho is quite good as is the Bun. Also, the quail appetizer is outstanding. I did manage to make it to their Sunday buffet lunch which was very cool. It was packed and the place was buzzing with families and large groups happily chowing down and enjoying the food and conversation.  Saigon Palace has pretty much everything I could ask for in a regular dining stop."}
{"text":"Pho was very good!! I had Rare Beef. Prices were the same as other places in Charlotte. I would come here again."}
{"text":"Wonderful fresh food!  I've never had a bad dish here, and just enjoyed the vermicelli with shrimp and the crispy spring roll....so delicious!  The staff is very friendly.  I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Sept 7,2013. I was very very dissatisfied with the service and would not recommend this restaurant to anyone. they ruined my night. I suggest Vietnam Grille on South Blvd or one of the many other Vietnamese restaurants."}
{"text":"It's so yummy - try a vermicelli bun, for example with shrimp and beef. I like to ask them to warm up the noodles that also come with fresh herbs, some iceberg, carrots and fish sauce. It fills you and makes you feel satisfied without feeling like you ate to much! 

Also their Phos (soup) are amazing!!

The location may be not the best and inside is okayish, but still I love to come here every time!"}
{"text":"I go here once a week, at least, to get the veggie Pho.  Best (and almost only) vegetarian Pho in Charlotte... Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"omg this place is awesome! I always get their pho tai, rare beef pho and its soo good. Their spring rolls have shrimp that are always clean, their fried spring rolls are amazing! My husband orders Chinese entrees and those are good too, the meat is never weird, there is enough meat, the sauce is delicious! This place is great, great honey dew bubble tea as well. The servers are very friendly and are accommodating to my toddler too."}
{"text":"Ever since I moved to the South Park area I have been a regular at Saigon Palace since I'm Asian and love to eat pho! Pho is a vietnamese noodle soup usually w/ beef broth and its super yummy! Although if you are a pho lover, Saigon's pho is very average. Its kind of soggy, but is still decent. 

I do love their combination vermecili salad and fresh summer rolls. We also never leave without getting a bubble tea to go! 

On Sunday they have a Vietnamese buffet; so if you love Vietnamese food or want to try a variety of Vietnamese food; Sunday would be the best day to go. 

We never do the buffet since pho is not included in the buffet. Overall the place is clean, big, and their service is great!"}
{"text":"I have traveled to Vietnam many times and always enjoyed the food there. This restaurant is very authentic and tastes delicious. I thoroughly enjoyed my vegetarian pho noodle soup."}
{"text":"Good experience.  

I ordered the shrimp vermicelli at around 9pm on a Saturday.  It arrived about 6-7 mins later. The shrimp was hot and well seasoned, and the veggies were crisp. The spring roll had a nice texture and flavor. Good service.  Good food.  I can see myself returning here to venture out a bit into other menu items."}
{"text":"Best Vietnamese in town! And the best service too. Highly recommend. We loved the rice noodles, pho and spring rolls. Definitely a new favorite spot for us!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant. Excellent food, efficient service and very clean restaurant. Even the chandelier sparkles. My favorite Vietnamese restaurant in Charlotte"}
{"text":"Great food!  The best we've had in NC.  The food was authentic & tasted great.  We would come back here for sure."}
{"text":"My wife, daughter and son-in-law went for Sunday buffet.  Full disclosure, I have no eaten a lot of Vietnamese food, but I enjoy all types of food and I am an adventurous eater.  My son-in-law is of asian descent with an asian chef as a father and he shares my opinion of the buffet.  Overpriced and mediocre.  We arrived after the rush so maybe the items were better when they were fresher.  The pho bar was good with lots of stock choices and add-in ingredients. Dim-sum limited to one type.  It was ok.  Quail was really good.  Fish dish had good flavor, but only heads and bones remained of the fish.  Shrimp were tough and I can only enjoy a couple of them when you have to eat the shells.  Other items were ok.  Dessert like many asian dessert bars was easy to pass on.  We saw several dishes come out of the kitchen that looked really good and all of us wished we had ordered from the menu instead of the $16.95 buffet."}
{"text":"Best Vietnamese place in Charlotte so far !!! Great food , excellent service !"}
{"text":"Wonderful family restaurant and great food. Our favorites are the spring rolls, pho tai, shrimp fried rice, and curry chicken. Best pho around town. They have accommodated larger parties for us graciously. Never an unpleasant experience for us here."}
{"text":"Wasn't sure what to expect. The spring rolls and beef pho was very good. Friendly servers and nice Vietnamese music  for ambiance. Will come back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"After reading so much about \"The Pho\" and never having been to a Vietnamese restaurant before, I decided to give this a try for lunch today.

To make a long story short: 

I learned today that I'm not a big Pho fan... there was nothing wrong with it, just isn't what I would choose next time looking at all the menu choices.

But I was very impressed with the restaurant:

- The service was very attentive (for a place like that in a strip mall) from getting seated to taking my drink order to taking my order to getting the check - and checking in mid-meal how I was doing

- I ordered the spring rolls #1 and the Pho with beef and meatballs. Everything came out very fresh - I was impressed with the way everything looked and tasted - and it was a good (and probably healthy) lunch.

I will try something else next time (maybe the vermicelli based on some reviews here) but I guess the good news is that they left a good enough impression for me to wanting to go back there."}
{"text":"33 Export Vietnamese beer!  My favorite Vietnamese place!

I enjoyed another huge bowl of bun (my fave).  This time it was no. 46 with grilled chicken and pork spring roll but I also enjoy the one with grilled beef.  My dinner companions also tucked into huge steaming bowls of beef pho and tofu veggie dishes.  We had a round of shrimp and veggie summer rolls in rice paper. Washed it down with \"33\" Expo vietnamese beer too. 

Siagon Palace never disappoints!  Huge and savory portions that are \"almost\" too pretty to eat.  I never have left overs! 

 A great South Charlotte destination for a taste of Vietnam!"}
{"text":"Best Vietnamese in town! I used to live in Laos, and visited Vietnam a number of times. This place is a great memory lane for me. Really quick service, cozy feeling dining hall. I have never done the buffet, I always order strictly Viet food from the menu and have never been let down."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great vegetarian options! Tofu and broccoli in black bean sauce is a personal favorite. The flavored are delicious and the food is very fresh. Great for take out too!"}
{"text":"Had to make a quick run to CLT... Just got in and had to find some food... Tried this spot the last time I was here and it was pretty good... Only given it three stars because I have only tries two items ... But they could get a possible 4 once I get a feel for there other menu items... The host is cool and friendly :-)"}
{"text":"I love the pho gah here! Im giving 4 stars for 2 reasons. One, the service is usually slow. Nice but slow. Two, it's a little pricey. I ordered an appetizer and pho gah and it was $18. I would recommend this place though!"}
{"text":"OMG! How come I didnt know about this place? Delicious food, BIG BIG portions, good prices, lots of options. I usually do take out from here but the place looks very clean, nice, and spacious. I get the vegetarian pho, and I kid you not they hand you a bag that looks like you're getting food for 3. The noodles, hot sauce, broth, beans sprouts, basils, etc, all come individual and you set it up. Ive also had shrimp skewers with noodles, also delicious. Seriously, new favorite for my friends and I."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I always get the pho the flavor is great and you can smell and taste the freshness of the herbs meats and vegetables used in it."}
{"text":"My friends and I go here all the time. The food is consistently good, as well as the service.
Just tried the Sunday brunch last week,& there were so many options. It's was a great way to try things I might not have tried."}
{"text":"Traveling to Charlotte first time but ending up
Two times at this place . Good pho and chicken wings !  Recommend!"}
{"text":"I had been this place many time, and the pho (noodle soup ) is my Favorite food, recommend this place have the best pho :)!!"}
{"text":"Never disappointed in the service or the authentic cuisine!! The veggie pho is nothing less than amazing !!!"}
{"text":"I've eaten many a bowls of pho in my lifetime, and have been to most of the Vietnamese restaurants in Charlotte. I would say this place is pretty decent, although not spectacular. Compared to phos of other Vietnamese restaurants in Charlotte it tastes very similar. I think the one thing that stands out about this place is that they have buffet on the weekends. I have never gotten the buffet but plenty of people do. They do get very busy on the weekends and that speaks well for the restaurant. A lot of asians frequent this restaurant and that also goes to show that they have some pretty authentic food. 

As for the pho, I would say the broth is decent. I haven't really  They used to put more meat in their bowl, but as it has been with most restaurants recently, everyone is putting less and less ingredients in their dishes. Must be the economy. They do give plenty of sides (bean sprouts, basil, peppers, lime) unlike some other restaurants. Their semi-raw steak is very thinly sliced, which is good for both the restaurant and myself.

I'm pretty sure they put a good bit of MSG in their broth though because I get the after effects of it (drowsiness, dry throat). Although, that's not a deal breaker for me since it makes the food taste better. Just have to drink plenty of water if you plan on drinking the broth.

Something about the service at this restaurant. This is really strange. Apparently they don't have waiters working in sections, their waiters work the entire restaurant. So we had a lot of overlapping service which became extremely annoying the course of the meal went on. We had a waiter come up to us to ask for our drinks. We told him. 3 minutes later, another waiter came up to take our drink orders. Same thing happened with our food order. It was funny at first. Then one waiter kept asking my friend if she would like to have bubble tea. My friend told the waiter no, and he asked her, really? Are you sure? So my friend, being nice, told the waiter that she would think about it and order it if she wanted it. Another \"Sure?\" Yes, she was definitely sure now that she didn't want a bubble tea. During the course of the meal 3 different waiters stopped by multiple times to ask us how the meal was, but we were very engaged in our conversation so it got pretty annoying. On its face you might consider this good service, but I would call it disorganized service. 

Still the food is good enough, and the location in close proximity enough to me that I will still go eat at this restaurant once a month. So I'll give it a low 4 star."}
{"text":"After 3 days of fried road food, pho chat (vegetable pho) at Saigon Palace was ambrosia to my palate. Some of the best I've eaten."}
{"text":"Eat here at least twice a week. The best Vietnamese there is to be found in this city. A true gem amongst the fusion crap. This is a place to go and sit among SE Asian transplants. This is where the people that run the other Vietnamese restaurants go. Pay no mind to any subpar review of this place, some people think Saigon is in China."}
{"text":"This is the best Vietnamese restaurant in Charlotte. I like the food here because it's not catered to only Americans, the recipes are actually authentic.  The service was great!!!  Eating here on Sundays are good, they have a variety of Chinese and Vietnamese food at the buffet!

Pho: good
Eggrolls: yummy!!!
rice plates: the pork chop was the best!
Noodles and grilled beef: scrumptious
Avocado shake: excellent!

There are many more dishes on the menu, however those are the few that I always order."}
{"text":"Pho holds a special place in my heart. It's the epitome of amazing comfort food and I'll travel far for a truly great bowlful.

With that in mind, I was disappointed by Saigon Palace. It's good, but not great. We had the pho ga and pho tai. They were both fine, but nothing to write home about. At the suggestion of fellow yelpers, we also got an avocado smoothie with boba. The smoothie was delish and creamy, but the boba was terrible. It was break your teeth hard. In my book, serving uncooked boba is unacceptable."}
{"text":"Their Sunday buffet is awesome! Their weekdays lunch is amazing!! You have to try this place when you get a chance!!"}
{"text":"Good Vietnamese food, nothing fancy. Atmosphere has the back in Vietnam, poor communist, style :)"}
{"text":"Honestly this is my go to Vietnamese restaurant in Charlotte. Everything I order here is soooo good. Well, Vietnamese food. I can't speak for the Chinese food here. They have brunch buffet on Sunday's which is great, and they also offer the regular menu as well."}
{"text":"We tried pho, stir fried noodle and fried rice with pineapple. Frankly, the pho is not as what I expected. I tried several better pho inside and outside this area. The fried noodle is pretty tasty and the fried rice with pineapple is ok, but not a Thailand style. Actually, I prefer to giving it a 3.5 which I believe is more reasonable."}
{"text":"Saigon Palace is my favorite Pho Spot!!! They give a good portion and the food quality is great. Never have I ordered something and didnt like. On Sundays they have a buffet option. My favorite there is Pho Dac Biet or BunBoHue!!"}
{"text":"Having recently discovered a true affection for Vietnamese food, I've been trying to find the best restaurants to go in Charlotte.  On Monday, we tried Vietnam Grille (delicious!)  But by Thursday we were still in the mood for more Vietnamese, so last night we checked out Saigon Palace about 4 blocks from VG.  I'm happy to say that our food was pretty much on par with VG, and my boyfriend actually preferred his pho at SP.  We got almost exactly the same thing that we did at Vietnam Grille so we could compare: he got pho with brisket and steak, and I got bun with chicken and a spring roll.  We started the meal with fresh spring rolls wrapped in rice paper and served with peanut sauce--it wasn't my favorite and I probably wouldn't get them again.  But when the entrees came out--watch out!  The pho had cilantro, which I missed from VG, and the meat was done perfectly.  Only one fatty piece, which is pretty good.  I loved my bun even more, which had a lot of chicken (more than VG), well seasoned and tasty, and the sauce that came with it (mirin with some other things) we mixed with hoisin and soy, and it was delicious.  And we both had enough for leftovers!

Very happy we now have TWO great places to go to satisfy our bun/pho cravings!"}
{"text":"I took my mother here for her first Pho experience. I will say I have lived in DC where the Pho places are everywhere so I know exactly what it's supposed to taste like. We both ordered summer rolls and Pho w/chicken. The summer rolls were good. I thought the lettuce in the rolls wasn't super fresh but they were still filled up pretty well and had enough shrimp. The pho broth was AMAZING. The ingredients in the pho were pretty amazing. The only issue I had was that the sprouts, mint, and limes used didn't seem super fresh to me, so I didn't really use them. Other than that the place was clean, service was excellent, and the price was fine too. I'd come back!"}
{"text":"Since we came back from Houston I've been looking for a good PHO place. Saigon palace took me back to the delicious PHO I've been missing. Everything was delicious and the service was great. 
Facility was clean and waiters were courteous and checked in on us frequently, even the manager or owner made sure we had all we needed and cleared empty plates. The prices were reasonable and portions were huge! 

I went there for a business meeting but I will definitely go back with my family. 
We have all been missing the great PHO we had in Houston. 

I would definitely recommend that everyone try this place ASAP!"}
{"text":"Foods pretty good. Nothing special. Pho is alright. Standard. Nothing jumps out as \"special\" but it's good. Basically that is pho. Disappointing is there is no option on sizes unless you go bigger which costs more on a price that's already steep for pho. I only eat a lil bit so I wanted a smaller bowl but couldn't.  I don't know about other foods on the menu tho."}
{"text":"As a lover of noodle soups, in particular pho,  Saigon Palace is good but not great. 

The pho is priced reasonably and the portion is fairly sized. But the broth is standard - not bad but not exceptional. And imo, the broth is a huge influence in the pho' flavor. The meats are good, and the garnishing are fresh and generous.

I also ordered the grilled pork with rice. Again, not bad but not great. Portion and prices are fair, but the flavors are standard.

Atmosphere and service are good too."}
{"text":"So delicious!  I got the Shrimp and Pork combination Bun.  The meat was perfectly marinated and the shrimp was delicious!  All the ingredients were very fresh. I don't even like Spring Rolls but I liked these!!
Ambiance was pleasant. Prices were very reasonable. What stood out the most was the SERVICE!   Such nice people and very helpful and polite.  I'm in from out of town but will definitely work this place into my plans on my next visit to Charlotte."}
{"text":"Some of the best Vietnamiese food around! I cannot recommend them highly enough! We drive over an hour just to eat here!"}
{"text":"Got a seafood Pho soup with rice noodles. It was tasty, but they were really stingy on the meat for the prices they are charging!"}
{"text":"Awesome food, friendly staff, and quick if your on the go and order out! I would like it if it wasn't in such a sketchy spot but hey, the food makes it 5 stars so what ever! I get the veggie Pho and goodness I swear I dream about it. I also have gotten the spicy shrimp with noodles and veggies and it is great! Tons of seating, so if your going with a group you're set, just on Sundays for brunch go early as it gets packed!"}
{"text":"Pho was too greasy and spring rolls tasted old pretty expensive almost $10 for a bowl of pho... Will not be back."}
{"text":"Possibly the worst Asian food I've had!!!

The waitress practically got everything wrong and the worst part was the main meals were disgusting. They tasted like that really bad Asian fish smell that happens sometimes when you go into one of the Asian markets. 

Spring rolls- thinly rolled with not much vegetable, but what was in it, was mush. Not terrible, but not great!

Fresh roll- ok, but the dipping sauce was the worst peanut sauce I've ever had. 

Coconut Bubble Tea - the frosty coconut part was good, the bubbles not so much. They tasted like warm, huge chewy tapioca. 

Thin Rice noodle, broccoli, uncooked onions in brown sauce- yuck! The broccoli was tolerable but the smell and taste of the noodle was gross! 

Wide rice noodle, shrimp, and broccoli - also a disappointment for my friend. She ate the shrimp but left everything else. She said it was intolerable. 

A disgusting meal for $45. How terrible!!!!"}
{"text":"This was one of the better pho's I have had in Charlotte.  We stopped in for a quick Friday lunch.  There was little wait and the service was friendly.  My wife ordered a seafood noodle soup ( I do not recall exactly) which she really liked.  I ordered the pho ga.  The chicken broth was flavorful and good.  This pho had more vegetables than I am used to, but not in a bad way.  The carrots and broccoli were still crisp.  It could have had more chicken, but it was ok.  Overall, I liked the pho and it was the second best I have had in Charlotte.  Be's Noodles is still my go to pho.  With this being so close to my work, Saigon Palace will be a regular lunch spot.  Very good food."}
{"text":"The pho here is the best route to go. Tried the Chinese food here and, it wasn't all that great. The customer service is always great, no complaints on that end."}
{"text":"My best friend took me for the first time about a week ago. I wanted to try the buffet for dinner but I'm guessing that's only a lunch thing (which was fine). My friend went on and on about their Pho dishes and let me tell y'all...it's AMAZING. (Adding sriracha sauce to it makes it even better) Not only does it please the palette it's also beautifully put together. I enjoy my food more when it's presented nicely. I also ordered a side of the Fresh Summer Rolls with peanut sauce and THOSE were AMAZING. So far, I am a definite fan. I'm looking forward to going back :)"}
{"text":"Saigon palace has a excellent selection of Vietnamese food. I had some egg rolls and chicken with oriental noodles and it was well prepared and tasted awesome. The egg rolls had a hint of cinnamon in them which at first taste kinda reminded me of christmas. The interior of this restaurant is decorated amazingly. I was very impressed with the pride they obviously take in their establishment. A lot of these strip mall type restaurants give you the feeling that they are making the bar minimum effort to dress the place up but Saigon Palace actually has a well done up dining room. The only bad things I could say about the place is that the 4 person tables are a bit small. It was only myself and one other person there but I could see the table already getting loaded up with plates even between the two of us. Also, service was a little slow but since the food was worth the wait it barely registered after the meal was over."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. Good Vietnamese food, but the menu price point is kind of high. Maybe I am just used to the abundance of Vietnamese food back home in Northern Virginia/DC that maybe the price point there is a little bit lower. But anyways, the food was pretty good. My friend and I ordered Goi Cuon (spring rolls) and they were so good, but I don't know how you could mess up spring rolls. I got Com Thit Nuong Bi Trung which is rice with grilled pork, shredded pork, and a fried egg. The thit nuong was a little bit sweet for my taste but worked well with the rice and nuoc mam (fish sauce). I wish they had com tam (broken rice) since that is how this dish is usually prepared but it was fine with the regular rice. I think Saigon Palace would be better if you went with a larger group as there are so many dishes that would be great to share family style instead of eating dishes individually. They have a wide variety of traditional Vietnamese foods on their menu. The service was good and the waiters came and checked on us often."}
{"text":"Came in late afternoon, after lunch but before dinner.  As a single diner, it's interesting to see how good service is.  One person eats apps faster than a group of people, and usually, should be a priority when sending food out.  There was only another couple eating there and the decor was semi-formal, with five lovely chandeliers and red tablecloths on all tables.  Asian music was playing in the background, something I really enjoyed.  (I feel like ethnically appropriate music enhances the dining experience.)  

The service was great and the staff friendly.  My water glass was never empty, and the waiter was attentive and prompt.  Courses came out in a timely manner, and by the time the main course was served (lemongrass curry with shrimp and potatoes), I was stuffed on spring rolls, both fresh and fried.  The shrimp were large and thoroughly deveined, (something I'm picky about), and perfectly cooked and tender.  The portions were large, and I had plenty leftover for lunch today.  

A great experience, can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this location out for some time now. Finally did on Saturday it wasn't busy at all. The first thing that turned me off was the pushy waiter, he gave us no time to view the menu and when we asked for a few minutes it seems like that annoyed him. He came back in about 2 mins asking if we were ready to order ... No not yet. After we ordered the food sort of made me forget how much of a jerk he was. I wanted to try something different but got my usual chicken phó since he had someplace else to be. Another waiter came to refill our drinks and bag out food he was very nice and made jokes. I may try them again."}
{"text":"Mmm  boba tea and #46. What a dream! Those light noodles and unique clear sauce wirh fresh mint and that grilled chkn is awesome. last time they used parsley or cilantro  wasn't the same but still delish!"}
{"text":"OK place, but nothing special.

We had the some spring rolls a beef combo pho, a seafood combo, and a tofu-over-noodles disk.

The spring rolls were decent, as was the dipping sauce.

The phos had a good mix of ingredients but the broths were thin and not particularly flavorful. The beef pho broth was missing star anise. Both phos had noodles that apparently had not been soaked long enough and were very clumpy

The owner?/manager?/hostess? stopped by our table and spent a long time complaining to us about her neighborhood and son. Unclear why, but we really didn't need to hear it."}
{"text":"I haven't had food here that I've been disappointed in. Portions are large and food is prepared quickly. We've taken many out of town guests and other Charlotte friends to dinner here and everyone has enjoyed it.

I've ordered pho for dine in and takeout - delicious either way. They package to go orders perfectly so the noodles don't turn into mush. 

Crab rangoons are my go to appetizer. Usually I go with the vegetarian pho, but last time I tried stir fried egg noodles with mixed vegetables. Really big noodles that were amazing! Might try to get them with less veggies next time so I can stuff my face with more wonderful noodles!

Service is always good. They are very attentive and always make sure customers feel welcome."}
{"text":"I met at Saigon Palace with a buddy who lives nearby on a whim. I had never really noticed or heard of Saigon before last week. Now, I'm telling everyone I know how great it is. Let me start out by saying that this is primarily a Vietnamese restaurant, but they have a large selection of traditional Chinese dishes as well. Their Vietnamese 'bun' options are actually very similar to pho, and not a 'bun' at all. There are just some things us outsiders don't understand. 

I was craving Chinese, so that's the cuisine I stuck with this time around. And boy, Saigon does Chinese better than a lot of other actual Chinese restaurants I've been to in Charlotte. I started with the egg drop soup, which is very flavorful and had a nice consistency. Not that thin, watery kind you find at many places. For my entree I went with the [extremely basic in the best way] General Tso's chicken. First of all, let me commend them for actually not up charging for fried rice. YOU DA REAL MVP. Secondly, the portion was huge. I made two meals of of this dish. Lastly, it was incredible. You could tell the chicken was freshly breaded and they used premium cuts of poultry. It wasn't the standard thick & crispy fried chicken you find in general tso's sauce ... it was breaded the way sweet & sour chicken typically is, and I am here for it. 

This is definitely going to be one of my go-to places when I'm craving any sort of Chinese noms. 

Pro-Tip --- they've got a plethora of bubble teas. The good kind. You're welcome."}
{"text":"I have to say this place is the best pho place I've ever been to, the staffs are very nice and professional always asked if I needed anything and they gave me a lot of food, I've been going to this place for 10 years and it never have disappointed me. I've been to Doan a few times the waiters there are cocky I didn't like the service at all, even tho the food was good. Saigon palace is the only place I would go eat Vietnamese food."}
{"text":"Before I begin, I must warn that the core of this food - loving being is an old Vietnamese soul with a family that are all masters of Vietnamese cuisine. I grew up cooking and eating Vietnamese food, savoring with all possible senses what every dish entails. Vietnamese cuisine is all about the fresh herbs and vegetables. It doesn't matter if you're making a spring roll to the infamous pho soup broth, there are so many ingredients to titillate your palate. Personally, I think that is what Saigon Palace lacks. I am never guaranteed that my cravings will be fulfilled upon entering and that's quite a let down for any foodie. I do admit that when they are on their game, the food is great! 

If you're new to Vietnamese cuisine and would like an ample selection to sample, I would recommend their Sunday buffet. For Sunday brunch, Saigon Palace serves a good variety of classic Vietnamese dishes such as banh xeo (Vietnamese crepes), grilled quail, various soups (banh canh, curry, bo kho, congee, etc) and desserts. I believe it is only on Sunday, $16 and only lasts til 4. If you're having a hard time figuring out what sauce goes with what dish or what herbs should be eaten to best complement a dish, feel free to ask an employee to help. I'm sure they would gladly lend the knowledge. 

Even though Saigon Palace does not meet my high standards, overall I do think it is a good family- owned Vietnamese restaurant. The restaurant is clean and filled with friendly staff. The owner will often roam through to make sure everything is to your satisfaction, which is always great. The menu has a vast variety of choices and the portions are always huge."}
{"text":"Their Pho with no meat is the best I've had in Charlotte thus far. The broth flavor is really rich and they give you a lot of add ins. I also purchased the fried spring rolls. Delicious."}
{"text":"We stopped here for a quick dinner before heading to the movie theater down South Blvd.  Delicious Hole in the Wall.  Well, actually they try to look like a restaurant, but it's pretty standard fixtures, and service, so don't expect a nice restaurant.  It was more like sit down casual service restaurant with GREAT prices and EXCELLENT Vietnamese food!"}
{"text":"I went here as my wife was in the mood for Pho. We chose this place as it was on the way to the airport (she was flying out). They have a variety of Asian food as I got the lo mien. It had great flavor but a little on the greasy/oily side. The food came out quickly which was nice as we wanted to make sure my wife got to the airport on time. They had all of the items for a buffet so i'm not sure if they have that as an option. I think we would go back if we were in that area again."}
{"text":"Ordered vermicelli with beef and eggroll, some of the best and I've had it in lots of different states."}
{"text":"A friend of mine and I went to Saigon to try out their Vietnamese Sunday Buffet.  The food overall wasn't bad, but it could of used a little bit of more additions.  

However, the fried chicken was great.  It was a curry based fried chicken, which I love."}
{"text":"My maiden visit to one of Charlottes little secrets. Although Saigon Palace has been operating in the same place for 14 years not many people know if this Vietnamese treasure, not me anyway. I had the bun dac diec (54) and it was medley of tasty pork, shrimp and meat balls over a large portion of rice noodles and the freshest veg. You will not leave here hungry."}
{"text":"Great place for a quick and healthy lunch.  Saigon isn't my favorite Vietnamese restaurant in town but it is definilty a tasty bite.  I decided on the vermicelli and beef lunch special - a huge portion for under $10.
I saw some chinese menu options as well so if your not big on the Vietnamese food know that you can still choose from a wide selection of menu items.  The staff is very friendly and I love the giant fish tank behind the register.  I heard around town that there seafood hot pot for 2 rocks.  I'll be back to try some more items for sure."}
{"text":"Silly question to ask, but does this location not often get Asians coming in?  The waiter stared at me the way that I stare at pho. Slightly awkward to say the least...is it the tattoos?

Anyway, dat broth tho. I've recently acquired the habit of sipping on the broth prior to doing anything to that tasty bowl of soup. And I quite enjoyed it.

The beef cuts for me was not rare enough at serving, but that's okay. I understand bringing out a plate of raw beef may be concerning for some. Was originally going to go somewhere else the night I went here, but the other place was 20minutes away. I was hungry. 

This was good. Much better than I had expected."}
{"text":"Was in the mood for Thai food and it was late at night and most things in the area were closing. We ordered takeout from here I got the Lemongrass  chicken my daughter got fried rice - both were mediocre.  the lemongrass was extremely watery and the fried rice with flavorless. I'm not sure if it was because we were so close to closing time or that we ordered take out but I would not be in a hurry to return here the next time we were in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I was incredibly disappointed with the food. I went for their lunch special and ordered some sort of crispy tofu salad with noodles, a dish I love at other Vietnamese restaurants. I specifically said I was a vegetarian and still got an order loaded with pork that I had to send back. When I finally got the dish I wanted, everything was really disappointing and flavorless and I didn't even eat half of it."}
{"text":"I think the food is excellent. My car broke down in front of this place and while it was getting service on one of these 100+ degree days we decided to grab a bite. Of coarse we signed onto Yelp to see what the people were saying. Based on the reviews and pictures we ordered based on those. I am full and satisfied."}
{"text":"The Pho King of NC. Delicious Pho and strong Cafe. When I am on the south side I always drop in."}
{"text":"A good Vietnamese restaurant with attentive service? Say word! Drinks were kept filled, and we were actually check upon every once in a while. One server automatically brought over extra napkins as (I'm pretty sure) she saw me wipe away the condensation to my delicious avocado smoothie with my only napkin. That was nice. BTW, I'm not a huge fan of guac or avocados in general, but in smoothie form - it's addicting. 

The grilled pork over rice/vermicelli is flavorful and the portion size will definitely fill you up. The meat to noodles ratio is higher than you'll find at other Vietnamese restaurants, so you're not left at the end with a bunch of noodles you don't know what to do with. The banh xeo (yellow sizzling pancakes) was mehh as I think it could have used double the filling (bean sprouts, thinly sliced pork, and shrimp) and the outside shell was a bit on the crunchier/darkened side. However, it was served right with plenty of green leaf lettuce and herbs to wrap it up and dip in fish sauce...yum. 

It's been a while since I've had the noodle soups but I remember them being darn tasty. Until next time..."}
{"text":"Love this spot. I'm a fan of family-run restaurants, so it's always a treat for me to stop by. I've been coming here for years, so I'm a regular. They already know how to cater to my family's vegan preferences so it's always a win. The fresh veggie spring rolls with tofu are a fav. Flavorful and a must have. I'm also a fan of the lemon grass tofu stir fry. Delish."}
{"text":"The food is very fresh and delicious. We had sesame chicken and pork and shrimp bun. We were very hungry and ready to eat so the wait was torture!  It was well worth it though!"}
{"text":"Food was good, service was excellent, my ice tea must have been refilled once every 2-5 minutes depending on how much I drank. The pho came in a huge bowl and was very tasty. The veggies in the spring rolls tasted very fresh. Definitely would go back for a second time."}
{"text":"This place some of the best fresh spring rolls ever!!  Favorite place for Pho....I will continue to come here.  Service is always great as well."}
{"text":"3.75 stars

I love Vietnamese food and I can be picky since I know what good homemade Vietnamese food is supposed to taste like. I usually manage my expectations when I'm outside of areas that could be called \"little saigon.\"

Came here when I was visiting my friend in Charlotte. The pho was pretty good. I was also intrigued by the idea of a AYCE vietnamese buffet. So of course, we had to come back and partake of it. 

I was impressed by the variety of Vietnamese dishes and soups. It was nice to see more than just pho. Don't get me wrong, I love pho, but it's great for people to see that there's more to viet cuisine than that one dish. Everything tasted pretty close to authentic. Also a number of central dishes (mmm, bun bo hue!)

Good viet food at decent prices. I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"The food here is great. Everything I had was flavorful and served fast. 
The crab asparagus soup was tasty. The asparagus was tender crisp and the crab flavored base makes a good compliment to it. 
The boneless chicken wing stuffed with pork was surprisingly awesome. They took out the bone from the wing then stuffed it with well seasoned pork. Think the amount of effort it takes to just make the dish!  
Taro bobba tea is a good dessert with hint of clean sweetness. I did not expect to find it here in Charlotte. 

What a good find!"}
{"text":"This was my first time eating here.  I was just passing through Charlotte.  Pho was really good.  They did exactly as I asked and brought plenty of bean sprouts and basil.   Along with bringing the meat raw on the side.  They also did it with a smile and charm.  Everyone was very polite and friendly even though we came to eat late that evening.  Really glad this place stays open till 10pm."}
{"text":"I normally order fried Vietnamese eggrolls along with a pho whenever I go to a Vietnamese restaurant and that is exactly what I did today. It was the first time I had the fried eggrolls served without any veggies at all. I thought it was strange to see the eggrolls by themselves. I was so accustomed to eat the eggrolls wrapped in veggies, dipped in the fish sauce. Their fish sauce had a surprising touch of garlic and chopped red pepper, The eggroll itself was not so inspiring. 
Having sad that, the pho itself was wonderful. This was one of the most visually pleasing looking pho I had in a long time. All the proper combination of fresh veggies and beef parts were mixed in right proportion. The broth tasted slightly flat, however.
Very clean restrooms, but in serious need of upgrades.
Friendly employees and good service. I will definately go back whenever I have a pho craving on my CLT layover."}
{"text":"The dining room is just OK, but the Pho is worth coming back over and over again."}
{"text":"A real strip mall gem.  

If you are staying at the Four Points around the corner and you don't feel like BBQ tonight, I suggest going here.  The food is great and it's open until 10 pm. 

The decor seems authentic, at least to someone like myself who has not been to Vietnam.  

There is a giant fish tank.  

The large dining area contains plenty of round tables with lazy Susans.  I'd suggest sitting at one of these even if it's just a small group, because a booth table will fill up quickly with little plates, large bowls and beers.  Plus, you can play Wheel of Pho-tune with your buddies.  

The wait staff is friendly and efficient. 

The menu contains hundreds of items and is numerically organized.  Our waiter didn't write anything down, so there was some suspense after the ordering process.  But, as far as I could tell, everything we ordered came out exactly how we ordered it.     

Food-wise: 

Don't bother with the shrimp appetizer.  

The cucumber salad was OK. 

I recommend this stuff: 

Butter fried Quail.
Chicken Pho 
Vietnamese pancake with pork and beef
Glass noodles with beef 
Spring Rolls.  

Another group we were with tried the beef and seafood Phos and had nothing but good things to report.  

All in all, a dining experience you will never Pho-get."}
{"text":"Great place to meet up with a bunch of people! They have a large eating area to accommodate any size of group. In addition, you don't have to worry about splitting the check. You can divide your ticket very easily and without additional charges.

I went the all veggie route and ordered #4 appetizer of tofu spring roll and #72 tofu and vegetable noodle bowl. It wasn't as flavorful as the seafood noodle bowl (with sliced pork). However, once I added some extra ingredients that they brought to the table (e.g., sprouts, jalapeño slices, lime wedges) it became just right.

The portion is large, service great, and environment easy going. Also, I was impressed by their \"to go\" containers... very sturdy and no spillage."}
{"text":"I was in town on business and tried this place based on the reviews and proximity to my hotel. It did not disappoint! I had the Butter Fried Quail which was excellent. Everything was very well seasoned and prepared. Would highly recommend if you want a change from the traditional."}
{"text":"I went last night with some friends for pho and really enjoyed it! I'd been to Saigon Palace years and years ago, and remembered it fondly - and the place stood up to those memories. It was decorated just as I remembered, and very clean and quiet for a Thursday night. Service was super quick and attentive. We had about three different staff members ask us if everything was great, if we needed anything, and to refill our drinks. It was *almost* too much. 

Our appetizers were great! My friends and I split an order of fresh summer rolls with shrimp and also got Vietnamese iced coffees for ourselves. Though shrimp isn't my favorite, the roll itself was great. Very fresh and the accompanying hoisin peanut sauce was excellent. If I were to fault anything, it would be that there didn't appear to be a vegetarian option for those of us who prefer summer rolls sans seafood.  The iced coffee, as always, was delicious. No complaints there. Just wish I could have finished the whole thing (I don't do a lot of dairy so a friend finished mine off for me).

For our mains, we all ordered pho. My typical order is the vegetarian, and I was not disappointed in this one! The broth was great with plenty of vegetables, and the fried tofu was a favorite among our whole group (even the little one!). No complaints here. The youngest of our group also ordered a taro bubble tea, which she raved about and savored through a post-dinner walk through Target.

Overall a great meal, good ambiance, and kind service. I took off one star only because I'd love to see more vegetarian options. The menus we had didn't seem to include many."}
{"text":"Went here with some Vietnamese friends of mine who were in town form Virginia. They love it here, eat here every time they are in town. My first time at a Vietnamese buffet and I didn't know what to expect. Decent variety of food with plenty of options to choose from. I tried Pho, Quail, and some type of egg rolls that were in a clear type lettuce wrap? Not sure if I would return, that is unless my friends come back to visit."}
{"text":"A solid spot for Vietnamese food. But as others have said I believe there to be better choices out there. Went for they're famous sunday family brunch buffet. It was crowded, lots of Vietnamese families which is always a good sign. The buffet had quite a few options including several Pho selections. There was a very hearty spicy beef broth that was excellent. My favorite dish was the grilled pork dish which had a slight sweet flavor which was really good. However, the rest of the food was meh ok. I believe Doans and Vietnam grill to be far better than Saigon palace food wise anyway. Overall a solid place but not my favorite."}
{"text":"I stopped here only because the Vietnam Grill was closed for the night.   I ordered Garlic wings for an appetizer.   They arrived late and in a dish of sauce that was so hot I couldn't pick them up for many minutes.  Before I could eat them, dinner arrived.   I ordered Grilled chicken.  The meat was fatty, and coarse.   Everything had a funny taste to it.    I was not impressed.  I reheated leftovers today for lunch, and I was reminded of how much I disliked it the first time.  I will stop at Wendy's before I go back to this place."}
{"text":"I believe there are very few Vietnamese options in uptown, south end and nearby areas.  Saigon is for sure one of the best Vietnamese restaurants we have visited so far in Charlotte area as such.  The traditional Pho is yummy and the quantity they give makes sure you dont leave hungry.  Kind staff, very attentive and quick on feet.  Last time i tried one of their \"Create your own steam rolls\" - Grilled Lemon Grass Chicken.  It was fun working on this dish, lol.  You basically get everything like veggies, herbs, sauces and the meat with some lettuce, dry rice wraps and hot water, just have to dip the dry rice wraps in hot water , place it on the place and stack whatever you would like and just roll it up, it sticks nicely and doesnt spill all over when you take a bite.  The hostess was kind enough to teach me to roll my first steam roll, taught the trick in rolling as well.  Loved it, but was difficult to finish the whole dish, there was a lot."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in town, hands down!

Although they have a full Chinese menu, you do yourself a great disservice to order from it.  Vietnamese fare is much lighter and full of flavor than what most Chinese restaurants serve!

Your best bet is to order either rice noodle soup (pho) or a noodle bowl.  My absolute favorite meal of all time is Pho Tai: a bed of rice noodles topped with thinly sliced beef, green and white onions, and an amazing broth.  You get to add fresh basil, lime, hot sauce (to taste), and bean sprouts.  I have a nearly ritual habit of leaning over my bowl to inhale deeply of the aroma before digging in.

Vegetarians and vegans have some fairly extensive choices available as well.  The Pho Che (veggie soup) is wonderful as well, with fried tofu and succulent broccoli.  

If it's too hot out for you to try the soup, a cool noodle bowl topped with beef, chicken, shrimp, or tofu is just the thing!

Just how good is it?  Our children (10 and 7) regularly ask to go to the Saigon Palace to have the seafood noodle soup."}
{"text":"was there Sunday for the lunch buffet. it was my first time there for the buffet. I wasn't impressed. being the first ones there I don't know if they had left overs out first but food looked old and dry. the rice did not look fresh. the chicken wings were fried way too much be they were dark and burnt. had some spare ribs stride fried and they were so hard could not eat it. Me and my daughter just threw those to the side. the egg noodles had no flavor. just very oily. I did just eat banh xeo. It was the only decent and fresh thing out. Even though it didn't have much inside it was about the only thing I liked b"}
{"text":"Best Pho in Charlotte!  Thoroughly enjoy everything I've tried on the menu.  Try the iced coffee."}
{"text":"If I could I would give this place a 2.5, but since I had to pick I decided to give them a 2.  I eat a lot of Vietnamese food, and I found this place to be on the lower end of average.  My parents go here sometimes because it is closer to our house than Ben Thanh, but I wont go to this place again.  There is nothing really wrong with the food, but there isn't really anything right about it.  I ordered the chicken bun, and the the chicken was fatty and the fish sauce was just slightly off.  If you do end up at Saigon, order the pho, it isn't bad."}
{"text":"Great place to get your Pho fix! Great service and the food is almost as good as Chinatown in NYC! Ain't nothing wrong with silver!"}
{"text":"Charlotte always seems to have a plethora of Vietnamese pho restaurants in town. With so many selections it always seems to come down to choice and what you like and don't like. Better yet, know and don't know about pho and Vietnamese cuisine. 

Coming from a household that actually cooks pho, I think I know what a traditional and healthy bowl is. Meaning your broth isn't made from concentrate and instead made from ox tails, packs of seasoning that contain star anise and Saigon cinnamon and so on. And most importantly, NO MSG. There's no need to have a flavor enhancer in a broth if the broth is made with wholesome ingredients. And lets think about that. Big old pot of water, ox tails and seasoning doesn't cost that much. A restaurant can easily make their money back by serving one table alone. 

That's something I wish they did here. The broth was sub-par and lacked the kick of cinnamon and the smokey aroma of black cardamom. It was just ok. Nothing special and really memorable coming from the soup. The beef brisket was high in fat and the beef tripe was a nail sized sliver dashed throughout the soup. Like I said, nothing special. The garnishes were very fresh though and I was thoroughly pleased with that. Service was attentive and fast.

What really killed me was the price. Nearly $10 for a bowl of soup. It's difficult for me to even justify that price in my own head. Rice noodles, broth, veggies, and meat. That's all a bowl of pho really is. It shouldn't cost more than $6 a bowl. I don't own a restaurant though, so who I am to say? 

If you're in the area and don't have time to make it to another pho restaurant in town, this location will suppress your craving.

*They do have much more than pho though and I will definitely come back to try their spring rolls and bun thit nuong."}
{"text":"Yes!  I found one restaurant that I will likely make one of my regular spots for Vietnamese food! I just attended their Sunday brunch and I admit the selection and quality really impressed me. I've never seem a Vietnamese buffet before. Dim Sum, sure. I will dare say I like this better than Dim Sum. It certainly can be healthier due to the soups and fresh vegetables. But those that enjoy sinning (me included), don't worry, they have your stuff there too. I really like their setup for congee (rice soup) and the bun (rice vermicelli noodles) which they provide a ride range of meats send vegetables that you can throw into that bowl. Oh, I'm so full!  And Lord, there's desert!  Mmmmm, warm taro and tapioca pudding!  Lots of other desert choices. Sunday buffet is a great introduction for newbies. Now, just because I posted this doesn't mean EVERYONE has to show up at once!  Spread it out, take your time, share. Enjoy life!  Y'all have fun now!"}
{"text":"All the MEATS. Great flavor by themselves (without any extra sauce) .  The \"sweet and sour\" fish sauce is very good too!

MEATBALL in competition with Doan's and Ben Thanh though not quite as good... Comes in Third place and a Close Third place!!! 

PORK chop Thick and looks like at Grandma's Meat and 3 except Southern Cooking with Much more flavor, Ginger and Spices all subtle 

Beef (Grilled) better than most!

Chicken nice flavor!

Shrimp FLAVORFUL L L!  Grilled, more Flavor than almost all Vietnamese shops!

Rice is plain as.... This is \"Com\" it is supposed to be plain!

Pho... The sweet smell of Boiling Bones, this one is pretty good!

Vietnamese Style Iced Coffee is 100% If you have never had it and like a Sweet Coffee Flavor this is a nice Dessert (sweetened with Sweetened Condensed Milk).

Service. One non-Asian dude was going to wait on me for some reason I look like I tip real well??? A girl who spoke English fairly well (it was ok) wanted to see if she could take my order... If you need something ALL THE young Dudes working here Asian and non speak and understand English Very well. Some if the girls speak very little English and you may not notice they are All very good and if you do not need anything out of the ordinary (Rod0) is here and he wants something most do not know is possible or would not imagine would be or are afraid to ask... Do NOT be afraid... If you are reading this far you are Brave enough!

What does ordering OFF the Menu mean to you???  Since I say it like that you probably know I mean NOT ordering FROM the menu or in so many words making up an ideal dish and asking IF it can be done... It CAN for $17.95.... SOLD!!! OK,  I had a price in mind ($3.00 more) so I agree to their price!

From previous experiences before, not factored into the overall star rating of this review :  :

Lemongrass stir fry should be avoided

Most of the Vietnamese dishes rated by me range from 2-4 yelp stars

Chinese dishes are better than many Chinese restaurants though not good enough to repeat.

If it is important the Decor is wonderfully Gaudy like a nicely Typical Chinese restaurant and nicer looking than most Vietnamese restaurants!  Lots of Red!  No privacy, more like a High School Cafeteria style openness so my friend Mr. Hoy will not eat here"}
{"text":"The food was good. Quick service.loved the pork and rice! The Thai tea was also very good. The employees were very friendly as well. Nice place to try Vietnamese food."}
{"text":"Went here after church on Sunday.  My girlfriend loves Vietnamese food, so we tried the pho with flank stank, spring rolls, corn / chicken soup, and Vietnamese coffee.  Place was bustling Sunday around noon (they have a buffet that looked so-so).  Waiters don't all speak English, but service is quick.

The pho was good - they served it they way we like it, with the steak to the side so we can cook it as much as we wanted (rare).  The soup was a bit heavy on corn starch and light on chicken, and the spring rolls were just OK.  The Vietnamese coffee was as expected, with the condensed milk on the bottom.  All-in-all, a great choice for a light lunch with some Asian flare!"}
{"text":"Meh, definitely meh.

I love the decor, it's so tacky, so campy that you know it's for real. That's it.
Service was somewhat dysfunctional but no biggie. 
Both the fresh spring roll and the pork skin roll were completely boring, in spite of the tasty (but I think commercially made) peanut sauce we didn't finish them. 

My all time favorite Viet dish is spicy lemon grass, here it was offered with chicken. NOT spicy, not particularly tasty either, the veggies were ok but the chicken was tasteless and mealy ... I suspect old. Not bad but not very good, in fact I'd rate Ben Thanh's lemongrass squid is FOUR stars better so there you have it it. 

The Buhn (bahn?) with fried spring roll, pork and shrimp (3 small ones) was pretty good. Mild again but tasty enough so as not to make me feel completely cheated, just disappointed.

I don't know if the owners stopped trying or if they never did, but there's a defeated atmosphere in the air, maybe because compared to the competition I'd rate them dead last?"}
{"text":"I have been frequenting this restaurant since Ken and Maria opened the doors many years ago.  The food is simply delicious, and I have been hard pressed to find a restaurant that stacks up in comparison to Ken's delicious Pho and Cracked Rice Plates.  One of my most favorite things to order here are the fresh Vietnamese spring rolls, they are soooo good.  If you are looking for the best food, in a family friendly and warm and inviting atmosphere, Saigon Palace is highly recommended.  I crave their food at least once a month, and going to this restaurant has become a regular routine for myself and family since I moved here almost 10 years ago.  Oh yah, and don't forget to try an avocado shake...it is absolutely to die for, and a pleasant and refreshing surprise.
Penny in Charlotte, NC"}
{"text":"We were pleasantly surprised by Saigon Palace. We came for a quick lunch and were surprised by the strip mall location. We were doubly surprised by the extensive menu offering Chinese, Vietnamese and more. 

I ordered the pho noodle soup which was good but not great. The beef was supposedly medium rare but I asked for it to be delivered rare so I could cook it in the broth and I guess that is not allowed. It was overcooked. The portion of beef was generous compared to other pho-serving restaurants which I appreciated. 

My husband enjoyed the beef lo mein lunch portion with a cup of soup and an egg roll. I stole a bite of the lo mein and it was delicious. I think that alone will bring us back. 

All-in-all, a decent spot for a quick, no thrills meal. Staff was efficient and seemingly pleasant. We were in and out in just under an hour."}
{"text":"Since I haven't updated this restaurant's review in such a long time, I decided to change that. It's Sunday, Father's day, and well... Vietnamese style brunch, they transform this made to order restaurant to an all you can eat buffet. Make sure you get here early as this place is pretty much packed for it, because of the quality of dishes that they serve. The buffet definitely differs itself from every other \"Chinese\" buffet in that they only do it one day a week and well, the food is good. 

They stick to one thing they know. Vietnamese food. They don't have pizza or sushi or even BBQ. It's not a large buffet, but they're efficient in sticking to their own specialties. That's why this buffet is better than the usual \"formula\" buffets. They have broths, pho, pork, fried egg pancakes, spring rolls, grilled pork, and the most popular: quail. Yes you heard me, quail. What restaurant would be crazy enough to put that on a buffet? And when it comes to the dessert, it's all Vietnamese desserts. No pudding here! 

And it's not like the food is mediocre either. The quail is seasoned and well cooked. All the dishes are actually, and you truly can sample a lot of the dishes the restaurant serves during the week by just coming to the Sunday brunch buffet. 

I've been sticking to this restaurant throughout the years and no wonder this restaurant is still in business. It's the community and the quality of the food that year over year they deliver. Check it out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Three stars for their dedication... It's very difficult to find a restaurant which is open till 10 PM in this region and even later (if you arrive there close to 10 PM, they might still allow you to dine in).

The serve size of their entries are big, and they are not bad. I will not call their dishes as delicious, but I will not describe them as terrible either."}
{"text":"If this place wasn't so out of the way for me to get to, I'd go here almost every single opportunity I have.  Having had both the Sunday brunch and Pho off the regular menu, I personally don't think the brunch is all that special; the Summer Rolls were great but I didn't really like much else.  As for the Pho, I cannot begin to describe how fantastic it is.  The soup is good, the texture of the noodles is good and the meat (I always get beef, whether it's meatball, brisket, trite, etc.) is good too!  So many flavors can be stacked here, I love it."}
{"text":"The waiters are extremely nice and the food is fresh.  I actually burned my fingers slightly on the crispy spring rolls - made just for me!  The pho is phenomenal.  My personal fave, though, is the cari ga.  Wonderful food and exceptional service.  I'm glad I'm just a stone's throw away from this establishment."}
{"text":"Love it!

Pho is always yummy and full of flavor after adding hoisin and Sriracha. Love the dishes. All cooked deliciously and very unique. Good, quick service. I recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"This is a good place to get your pho or vermicelli noodle fix. 
Things to try:
Bubble Tea
Vermicelli

I ordered the seafood soup pot and it was tasty. The only negative I have about it is that they used imitation crab in it. That was a turn off. 

Service was very friendly."}
{"text":"The Pho was very bland and tasted like water. The Pork Lomein was super oily. We had 3 different waiter/waitresses. Very unorganized! Our first waitress was very sweet but so quiet I could barely hear her. Also she didn't speak much English so it was hard to understand her. She took our drink order. Our second waiter, he took our food order. Again, didn't speak much English but he was nice. Now our third waiter was a complete ASSHOLE! He brought our food out and he smelled like straight up alcohol. Maybe that explains his disgusting attitude! My drink was in the way and he pushed it out the way so hard it almost spilled! I then asked him if I can please have some chili for my pho. He gives me the meanest look ever and said nothing but \"YUP\". RUDE! He comes back and slides the little cup of chili on the table. I tell him thank you and he just walks away. RUDE! I mean if you are going to have a job that interacts with customers, atleast throw a smile on your face! Unless your job is that miserable. Not to mention we had no refills. We will NEVER be back!"}
{"text":"Food is awful and so greasy. Service was good, but food is bleh. Go to Doan's instead."}
{"text":"I've never been to Saigon.  But I felt like I was there at this place.  Food was great, very attentive staff, clean, and authentic at an affordable price.   What else is there to say."}
{"text":"I ate here recently out of curiosity, since I live nearby and it always seems busy. I'm not really sure what draws so many people here. It's inexpensive and has a buffet? But honestly, I didn't dare touch the buffet. It didn't look clean. Neither did the tables or restaurant as a whole. I opted to try their pho. It was edible, but not flavorful. I was not impressed and there are two better Vietnamese places up the road."}
{"text":"The customer service here is amazing! The servers are so helpful and friendly, and they were so patient as my very Russian mother navigated a very unfamiliar Thai/Vietnamese menu.
I had the Iced Coffee (great!), Tofu Summer Rolls (fresh!) and Vegetarian Vietnamese Pancakes. While the pancakes themselves were a little too greasy for my tastes, everything was delicious and soooo flavorful! Really glad I came here and didn't give up on South Blvd. Viet/Thai places, especially after my traumatic experience at Doan's...
Will definitely be back soon to try the Pho, since practically everyone else was chowing down on it while we were in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Biggest pho place I've ever seen, and also only one that doubles as a banquet hall. Right off the lively street known as South Blvd, Saigon Palace (not to be confused with Saigon Bistro on the other side of town) has everything you need for your pho and bun cravings (which I have very frequently).

Had the grilled shrimp bun which is soup-less vermicelli, lettuce, bean sprouts, and grilled shrimp flavored with fish sauce. It was yummy, as was the spring roll appetizer. The service was great and waiters very nice. I definitely need to go back and try their pho!"}
{"text":"I've only had the Chicken Bun (pronounced boon) and the Chicken Salad. The food is consistently good and the ingredients are always fresh. My only gripe is that they are overpriced! The chicken salad is $9.78 and consists of a grilled chicken breast, shredded cabbage and carrots, cilantro, crushed peanuts and fish sauce."}
{"text":"We loved this food. We considered it the best we had had in a long time. Everything was yummy. Spring rolls were killer."}
{"text":"Come here probably once a week because is close to work. I only get the pho combination and I'm in and out in less than 40 minutes stuffed to the gills. 

As for the pho, it's one of the better places in Charlotte, and I've had at least a dozen (trust me, they are out there... and some are atrocious). The freshness of the veggies are ok, I've had a mixed bag from time to time. 

I've also gone for their weekend brunch. It's pretty good. They have a good selection on Vietnamese dishes and soups. Gives you a pretty good value, but come hungry...

The service is on par with other Vietnamese restaurants."}
{"text":"I won't pretend that I'm any kind of pho expert (this was only my second time), but I absolutely loved my dinner here. I had the chicken pho (I know, I know - total newb move) and it was comforting, hot, delicious, and fresh. I loved the addition of all the veggies (broccoli, onions, basil, carrots) and definitely added my fair share of Sriracha. My dining companion, a pho expert, said he likes Vietnam Grille better, but I liked this place - big, clean, open. I'll go back!"}
{"text":"I had lunch with a couple co-workers on a Monday.  The service was fast and friendly.  The Pho was good; I liked the fact that I could exclude certain items from the seafood selection.   This would not be my first choice for Pho in Charlotte, but it is a good place for a filling lunch close to work."}
{"text":"Good pho with good broth. The pho tai nam has a good selection of beef without any challenging components. It comes with fresh beans sprouts, mint, and jalapeños which you can add or not.

The lemon grass  chicken is strong and flavorful. You'll want some rice and veggies to go with that.

Friendly, comfortable staff are attentive and easy to interact with. The staff often share stories and jokes with happy, regular diners.

The decor is a big open room with Chinese calligraphy, dragons, and jungle scenes.

This is the best pho I have found in Charlotte so far. Mix that with friendly and attentive staff and you have a winner!"}
{"text":"I dropped in here on a Saturday night to place a to-go order.  It was pretty close to their closing time, so the last couple of groups were leaving as I was heading in.  Saigon Palace came highly recommended for the food, and I was certainly steered in the right direction!

On a scale of Pretty Bad to Excellent, the food at Saigon Palace gets a solid Great.  The Pho was delicious and had a ton of vegetables.  Definitely about two meals worth in one bowl.  Broth wasn't too salty, and you could add different sauces to spice it up.  Don't forget about the appetizers!  Steamed pork dumplings had dough that was a bit thick, but the flavor was awesome (and they give you a ton of dipping sauce, too).  Spring rolls were pretty normal.

Would I recommend this place to others?  Absolutely.  It's not a place where I would go on a fancy night out, but if I'm just craving some really good Vietnamese food, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"This was my first experience with Vietnamese food.  I had a #39 (beef on white rice with a spring roll).  I was very pleased and would like to go again and try different dishes.  I will admit the food was a tad bland for my taste -- but after adding some soy sauce, heaps of chili oil, and squeezing a wedge of lime over it, my entree became very savory.  The service was good; my drink stayed full.  I really enjoyed the decor.  There were at least two large fish tanks that looked very clean and housed gigantic, interesting looking fish.  The place has a distinctly Asian feel that isn't done justice by its strip mall exterior.  I don't have other Vietnamese restaurants to compare it to (yet) but I would happily make another dinner trip to Saigon Palace."}
{"text":"What a Little Diamond in a Strip Mall...I have to say that South Blvd as busy traffic wise as it is  has some great restaurants!  This is one of them. This is a nice clean restaurant that has a huge Vietnamese /Chinese Menu. Some of the best food I have had here in Charlotte. We had a big birthday party there and yet we were  waited on very quickly.  We started out with the Deep Fried Spring Rolls which were filled with Pork. A Nice sweet and sour sauce on the side.   I had the Vietnamese Pancake- it was so delicious, I have never had anything like it before. It was a crispy fried pancake stuffed with shrimp, pork belly, Bean sprouts and served with fresh cilantro and leaf lettuce. Outstanding! My daughter had a Vermicelli rice bowl that was served with Cucumber and grilled beef / alot of fresh veggies and a light sweet sauce that was very refreshing. My husband had the Crispy Fried Noodles, ( huge noodles) that had a wonderful grilled flavor, this was another dish like the pancake that I have never had.  My son had the Rice with Grilled Pork chop and A Sunny Side up Egg.  Service was informative and quick...Definitely will be making another trip back to this very special place~"}
{"text":"Looking for some after new year party belly coating. It's cold and raining and pho is the perfect remedy. 
We stopped in for some take out. The Staff was very attentive, almost overly attentive. Yes, there is a such thing. We were asked what we ordered four times by the same guy in a span of 5 minutes . The place is very clean, and well spread out. Our order was prepared very fast. 
We got home and unwrapped our goodies. Boy did they hook us up. The meat and noodles came in a bowl, separate from the broth. Very smart. We also got a huge bag with bean sprouts, limes, basil and condiments. 
 The taste of the broth alone was great. Worth the drive. After putting the Pho all together, it was really delicious. We had the steak Pho and Chicken Pho. Also an order of roast pork fried rice. Everything was great . Can't wait to go back and try other stu"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I stopped by here during our last trip to Charlotte for some Pho. We both ordered the house special...it was without a doubt the worst pho I have ever had in my life. The broth was tasteless and the meat was pretty poor quality. To top it off we both ended up feeling sick for the next 5 hours, headaches and sore stomachs. Our service was also atrocious as the waiter never came back to our table after taking our orders. There are plenty of other places around where you can get a good bowl of pho, but not here."}
{"text":"So this place is pretty good, however the prices are ridiculously high. You actually have to pay almost 3-4 dollars to get a larger size. What's also funny about this place is they charge you extra for sides which is an absolute first for me. For those bean sprout lovers for pho, do not come here because you will be sadly disappointed with your check. I would have given better ratings if it wasn't for the prices and charging extra for sides."}
{"text":"Really good Vietnamese I thought. The spring rolls were large and very fresh with shrimp, mint and all that other good stuff they put in them along with the peanut sauce to dunk them in. Then I had the garlic chicken wings which were way better than expected. Deep fried wings tossed in a simmering hot (not spicy hot), brown sauce sorta sweet like General Tso's sauce with onion and scallions. Very messy and not too garlicky at all. Highly recommended. Finished with a bowl of the meat combo Pho with beef, meatballs, tripe etc. etc. which I spiced up with some Sriracha of course. Good service and it seems they do a popular buffet here also."}
{"text":"As a vietnamese trucker I get to taste the country's vietnamese menus! Luckily I was here in Charlotte for work.

This place is certainly not the best Charlottes got. I was already warned but I had to try it because I was stuck in the area.

Giving them 3 stars because it's not great but they're not bad. Menu selection is very diverse. Last section has chinese food; a dead giveaway that this place isn't where you would bring vietnamese people. 

Bun bo hue was super oily and bland. Waiter served it with sriracha and hoisin. All viets know you never eat that with Bun Bo Hue. 

I mean it's viet but not good viet. 

I would come here if I was forced to or drunk. 

A for effort, though, most restaurants don't offer Bun Bo Hue."}
{"text":"5 stars for selling Dumplings whereas Doan's does not. 
The PHO is solid here but man my brisket was fatty and that hurt my feelings. 

The service was slow yesterday with only 3 other tables in the restaurant PLUS everyone else had food. My thought: it's just PHO what's the deal? 

I guess they were looking for timing after the dumplings. 
The sauce with the dumplings was not tasty. Brown, hot and flavorless. 

Yet, pork within the dumpling was flavorful with the right amount of heat (spice). 

I will echo what others have said: Charlotte is blessed to have PHO places like this and within blocks of each other, too!"}
{"text":"too many people in rush hours high noise level. Lemon grass chicken was a bit over salted and waiters are too busy to take good care of you."}
{"text":"This place is good. The pho is great. It's clean and the service is great. Spring rolls are worth a try too and the ice coffee."}
{"text":"I agree with others, this is the best Vietnamese in Charlotte.  I am not a pho fan, so I am not going to dish on the pho (good or bad).  What I do love, and I consider this the best Asian dish I've ever eaten, are the vermicelli bowls.

I usually get the shrimp/chicken/chia gao combo vermicelli bowl.  The shrimp is grilled with a spice combination that I am desperate to duplicate on my own.  I've never had grilled shrimp so tasty.  Throw in the sweet and sour fish sauce on top of the mint leaves, crushed peanuts, sprouts, carrots and lettuce (plus dab a spoon full of crushed chili), and you have one incredible bowl of flavor.  The grilled pork is also good on this dish.

Throw in the fact the wait staff is attentive and friendly, and you have a wonderful dining experience waiting for you here (yeah, I work in advertising, why do you ask?)"}
{"text":"Yasss GAWD! My fiance and I had dinner here a few weeks ago, the food is PERFECTION!!!! We started with calamari which we both loved...nicely seasoned and crispy. For my Entree, I ordered the Bun with Pork, chargrilled shrimp, and meatballs....personally I can live without the meatballs. This meal completed my life. The portion size is huge! I couldn't finished everything. 

They didnt have lemonade, only bubble tea, soda, water and sweet tea. Luckly our waiter made lemonade for us, which was good....oh there are no free refills.. Which sucks, and they leave the stirring spoon in the glass."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh, the vermicelli is to die for! The vegetables are so fresh, the dish is light and delicious.  I've had it with shrimp and again with pork. Both times were excellent. I also like their rolls. I could go here every week!"}
{"text":"Saigon Palace is a favorite lunchtime spot for my coworkers and I.  

The staff is one of the reasons I love coming here.  They are always friendly, gracious and you always feel welcome here and encouraged to come back.  

The food is also pretty good here, although I always seem to get the same thing, Chicken Pho.  Once I strayed and ordered the Veggie Pho.  

What can you bad about soup that you get to season yourself?   The hotter the better for me.  Just don't wear white when you go there unless you use a bib.  :)

Good stuff.  Great staff.  One of these days I'll make it for dinner!"}
{"text":"I almost gave this restaurant 5 stars, but 5 stars are scared! Nonetheless, this place is at least 4.5 stars. Solid restaurant that has been here for at least 15 years. It seems to keep getting better. 
They now have Sunday lunch buffets from 10-2 for 16.95, it includes everything except for pho. I would say I don't usually see vietnamese buffets, so definitely take advantage of it if you are nearby!

Ample parking, convenient location, it's easier if you are driving on tyvola to make a right onto the street prior to S Blvd. 

Good service, solid hot pot! Overall the restaurant is clean and the food did not take too long to come out!"}
{"text":"I was in Charlotte for the weekend and decided to try this place on a whim. As soon as we parked outside Saigon Palace, I knew I was going to love it. Bright neon lights outlined the windows of the restaurant - only foreshadowing what was behind the doors. The décor consists of fancy chandeliers, wall murals, an aquarium full of large, bright orange fish, and a lot of red. 
I ordered the Create Your Own Steam Rolls with the shrimp and pork. I loved the concept - eight sheets rice paper, boiling hot water, and a variety of fillings of my choosing (consisting of bean sprouts, lettuce, cucumber, carrots, vermicelli, etc.). Overall, the rolls were pretty good, but I wish the ingredients were fresher. We did arrive there at 8pm, so I'd like to give them benefit of the doubt here. My partner ordered a vermicelli dish and he gobbled his entire bowl up. 
The bubble tea on the other hand was phenomenal! It was not only the perfect amount of sweetness, but was also blended very smoothly. They did not skimp out on the amount of bobas either! 

If you're in the Charlotte area and craving Vietnamese - definitely try it out.
If you're in the Charlotte area and craving bubble tea - drive here right now!"}
{"text":"This was my 1st time ever eating Vietnamese food, & let me start by saying that I hate Chinese food, so you can see where I'm going with this. Maybe if I were to like these types of food, then this place wouldn't have been so bad, but for me I'd rather stay away from this type of food.

From the outside, this looks like your normal shopping center restaurant, small & quaint. But this place is freaking huge...I was absolutely shocked. I don't know if they ever get enough people to fill it up, but they have A LOT of seating. The whole place is open, with nothing but tables & chairs throughout the whole place. No walls, decorative pieces, nothing but space & seating.

I went with an old coworker that likes this type of food so he had some suggestions for me as I frowned across the menu. Maybe to a Vietnamese connoisseur this food would be appealing, but to me everything just sounded like something I'd rather not eat. I will say that while I wasn't exactly thrilled with eating the food, they do give you huge portions.

Saigon Palace is not your typical shopping center restaurant, with its size really setting it apart. The food is probably good if you're in to that type of thing, but for me it just wasn't good. I'm sure you could get a seat here pretty quickly anytime of the day, for any size group, considering how abundant seating is. Vietnamese just isn't for me & I'll stay away in the future...but at least I tried it..."}
{"text":"If you love Pho, you'll love this place.  Broth is amazing.  Noodles are toothsome.  Very well done every time."}
{"text":"pho was just okay to me. not bad, but not outstanding. i've had better and even had the option to choose a larger size at viet-thai (close to pineville). my husband got a different noodle dish, and he was only slightly enthused by it. we also ordered a honeydew boba, and i was happy with the taste of the drink but not the texture of the boba pearls. they were super over-cooked and way too soft. i had to stir the drink a bunch to allow the drink to cool the pearls off, so they would harden up enough to be less of a gross texture. service was good, so that was good for them. don't get me wrong. food was palatable and all that. just not the best i've had.

overall, i don't think i will go back here knowing that i can get better somewhere else. sorry saigon palace..."}
{"text":"The food here, though a little pricey compared to others, was absolutely delicious. Had fresh summer rolls and pho. The summer rolls were as expected. The broth on the pho was delicious. Noticed they have a Sunday buffet. Will have to come to try that."}
{"text":"Saigon Palace is one of my favorite Vietnamese places in Charlotte. Overall this place is great because there is never a problem getting in with a large group and the service is nice. The banh xeo is a winner and it's a fabulous, low-key spot for a group interested in talking and eating rather than being with the \"in-crowd\"."}
{"text":"Saigon Palace doesn't stack up to Ben Thanh or Pho Hoa but I do think they're better than Saigon grill up the street so if you're on South blvd and need some Vietnamese I'd come here instead."}
{"text":"I have only been here once, but it was really good.  I tried their Pho it was awesome.  They seemed to have a large menu selection."}
{"text":"The best place for Vietnamese cuisine. Simply amazing and the service is outstanding. A fine dining experience."}
{"text":"I have never had the pleasure of the Sunday buffet at Saigon palace - but I hope to one day enjoy it, I just can never seem to get across town (rather, I can't get my butt up on a weekend morning to try it). When we do get over there, we have been quite satisfied, even though the place itself isn't that much to look at.

I am, however, generally quite convinced that the less effort put into the building/environment of the establishment - especially Vietnamese - then the better the food. Le's? Ben Thanh? Pho an Hoa? Lan van? All quite tasty, and none of them are anything to look at. In fact, some look as if they are just about ready to fall down around you. While Saigon isn't quite at that level yet, it's definitely somewhere you might be ready to pass by, but both the service and the food is worth stopping for if you're anywhere nearby, and (apparently) even more so on a Sunday.

One of these days I'm going to have to get over there for it."}
{"text":"Decent Pho with pretty standard options and served in good sized portions. Service is quick so they are great for a quick lunch break.

Overall, I'd say everything is pretty standard from the decor, red linens under glass table tops, Asian decor, water fountain, and fish tank all the way down to the fortune cookie at the end of the meal."}
{"text":"I came here because Doan was closed. Service pretty much sucks. If anything, it's nonexistent. The boba teas are good. The pho is mediocre. Would I come again? Prob only on Sundays for the buffet which is a bit on the pricey side but it's still good. For the buffet on Sundays they have banh xeo, fresh spring rolls, fried spring rolls, variety of soups that you can eat with the rice noodles, fried quail, and plenty of other things."}
{"text":"It really is \"the place for noodle soup lover\"!!! My husband and I went after gym and had Pho ga- this is one of THE BEST noodle soups in Charlotte area. For mixed vegetables, they gave broccoli, fennel, basil, carrots, cabbage, beans sprouts - all healthy and fulfilling! We definitely wanted to try lunch buffet in here, probably next time soon :-)"}
{"text":"I stop every time I drive by. You walk in and immediately are hit by the aroma of soup and love. I sit down and order an iced coffee and fried chicken wing stuffed with pork. I thought it was an odd concept before ordering it but now it would be sacrilegious not to order it! Anything beefy in the pho is the way to go. They have perfected the tendon in all of their pho. It's creamy and melts in you mouth with a richness that never gets old. The brisket is so flavorful you'd think Guy Fieri was planting a flag in the name of flavortown in your mouth. Fantastic service and have no complaints whatsoever!"}
{"text":"This is technically 4.6 stars, but I caved and made it a Fiver!

I am a huge fan of vietnamese cuisine, and have worked at Lime & Basil over in Chapel Hill. My taste for pho is quite discerning, and this place definitely delivers. Although the broth is a bit light, it is DELICIOUS. Pho is my go-to food when I'm sick, and this place never lets me down. 

The service is wonderful, and the owner herself constantly buzzes around, making suggestions and making sure everything is covered. This place is also extremely veggie-friendly: there is a special section in the menu for my Hindu parents :)

My only (slight) complaint is that the chili sauce they offer is not the traditional sambal oelek, but rather an off-shoot form of it. Other than that though, a wonderful restaurant with affordable dishes and a casual but clean atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Food and service FTW. This is definitely in the top 3 of Vietnamese restaurants I've been to in this area. It's clean and the staff are all super polite. I happen to have a lot of really stupid food allergies, and the staff is very forthcoming about the ingredients and seem happy to check for me when they aren't sure. They even re-made an order for me once when they saw me quietly picking out all of the bean sprouts, even though I felt so bad about having them do that.

I'd definitely recommend their pho. The broth is on point! The ratio of noodle and meat is great. They also have a ton of other dishes. I'd recommend pretty much all of their appetizers. While I haven't been able to eat them, my dining companions have always been happy with their selections. 

This is a solid on the \"will come back again\" list."}
{"text":"Jon B with probably the greatest discovery about this place: not only are their Vietnamese dishes delicious, but they also have some damn great Chinese food. 

We started with crispy rolls, dumplings, and soups. They have both great egg drop and hot n sour. I was in one of those moods where I wanted everything on the menu. Our server suggested a beef dish and to add some veggies. He nailed it. Delicious. Our table also ordered chicken pho, one of the vermicelli bowls, and General Tso's chicken. It was all great. Also, kudos to our server. Not only was he great, he was also very honest and hysterical. Note: On Sundays, they offer a buffet.

One of my favorite things about this place is the fish tank behind the register. It is filled with monster goldfish and I get lost staring into it every time. I need this in my house."}
{"text":"THis place is the best in town.  On Sunday they have a Vietnamese buffet with everything.  They are friendly and the food is perfect.  They also have bubble teas.  Yummy.  One of my favorite places to eat.  They also have a Chinese menu too.  You will love it."}
{"text":"I love this place! Very tasty and very affordable...great mix of Vietnamese and Chinese dishes."}
{"text":"What a great family restaurant here in Charlotte, NC.  One of the restaurants that I miss after moving away.  The family that run the restaurant are great and the food makes you feel so much better.  The Pho soups are wonderful with #78 being my favorite, fresh vegetables and broth that are actually hard to find in today's restaurants that are over processed.  The curry dishes are amazing, try the chicken or shrimp curry, I think one of the best in town.  Also their other dishes such as the lemon grass have an amazing sauce.  Great place to go to in the area, prices are not high and the portions are great for a big appetite.  Say hello for us if you decide to go and I don't think that you will be disappointed."}
{"text":"I have eaten here at least once a month for the past 3 years. When my BF & I can't figure out where to go for dinner, this is our go-to spot. The food is consistently tasty- I've only had a not so great experience with it the first time I came here & the first time I ordered pho. I usually rotate between 2 different apps & 4 different entrees.

For apps, I either get the vegetarian summer rolls (#4) or the fried veggie rolls. The summer rolls are filled with mint, bean sprouts, noodles, lettuce, & tofu but I don't really like mint in savory dishes & they have no problem substituting basil in its place. There are 2 pieces per order & it's served with a yummy peanut sauce & I like to squirt tons of sriracha in it.  The fried veggie rolls are not on the menu & I don't think they always have them but try asking & you might get lucky! They are just normal spring rolls but sometimes you just want something crispy to munch on & those summer rolls aren't gonna cut it! I ask for some lettuce pieces & roll the spring roll up & douse it with sriracha! I don't remember how many come in an order but it's either 2 or 4.

For my entrees I either get the vegetarian pho with tofu (#72), mixed vegetables & tofu in garlic sauce (#92), stir-fried egg noodles with vegetables & tofu (#94), or mixed vegetables & tofu in lemongrass (#98). The vegetables in all of these are pretty much the same (cabbage, carrots, broccoli, mushrooms, snow peas, & onions). Once in awhile I will try something different, but these are my favorites.

I tried pho for the first time here at Saigon Palace. I think it was sometime in 2011. I was never interested in noodle soup & I didn't understand what was so special about pho & why so many people love it. I decided to give it a try & honestly I did not like it at all. First off- I had no idea that it was going to be COVERED with cilantro. A tiny bit is ok, like in Mexican rice or something, but that was awful. I also didn't like the noodles that the pho normally comes with, but my BF told me to get the egg noodles next time. So a few months later I decided to try pho again & ordered it with no cilantro & with egg noodles & it was sooo much better. I added the fresh basil, bean sprouts, limes, jalapenos, & hoisin, & generous amounts of sriracha & I can now say that I am a fan of pho! There is a $1 upcharge to substitute egg noodles in place of the regular noodles but it makes it like 1000000x better!

I think on my first visit, I got #92 & I didn't really like it but I went again a few months later & it was really good. I don't really order it anymore because I like the lemongrass tofu better, but it is still an excellent choice. These are both served with white rice but lately I have been getting no rice & extra veggies.

For #94 you get your choice of soft noodles or crispy noodles (ALWAYS go crispy!) It is HUGE- basically it is #92 served on a bird's nest of noodles that's almost as big as the plate it's served on. So amazing & so hard for me to share whenever I do order it. This was my shit a couple of years back but I don't order it often anymore because I am pretty sure I gained 10 pounds from this alone. I remember ordering this & a few other dishes with my friend last year. When the server brought this out, some dude at a another table was like 'wtf is that, it looks AWESOME' .. well duh because it is awesome! Do yourself a favor & try this at least once.

My BF likes the chicken wings, & the different types of vermicelli dishes with grilled pork or whatever. He also likes all kinds of pho with the weird cuts of meat & stuff (tripe & tendons?) PASS.

I think the wines are pretty cheap. I think I ordered a plum wine here once & it was like $3.50/glass which is like half the price elsewhere. Also tried the Vietnamese coffee & recently discovered the avocado smoothie! mmmmm

While it isn't the best Vietnamese place in Charlotte & I'm not sure how authentic everything is, they make very satisfying meals at reasonable prices. An app or 2 & 2 entrees will come to I believe around $25-30 + tip & pay at the front."}
{"text":"Not bad.

The pho broth was a little on the weak side, but definitely beefy. The meat was good, though a little less red than desired, but plentiful.

The bean sprouts were day old and the lettuce in the fresh rolls was rather green an wilted.

The grilled pork was very tasty though and they obliged me and made the fresh rolls with grilled pork. 

80% of the tables had Asian people sitting at them, though this place is a buffet restaurant at some point in the week. I was concerned that the front door says the place to go for Vietnamese and Chinese food, but they did a decent enough job with their Pho today.

So I went back a few more times and it was consistent...I'm happy with it here. It is the best in the world? No. Is it confusing that no one in the restaurant seemed to have Vietnamese food and everyone was eating what looked like Chinese food? Yes...do I really care?

No!

So, if you are in Charlotte and going to be near the airport, head by here, it's only about an 8 minute drive from the Airport on South Something or other"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I must retract my previous statement.

The best pho is no longer here, the noodles are not quite right (too mushy and grainy), and the broth is not that flavorful. They do accept AMEX though. Note: the Pho Ga is not bad because the chicken is tender.

See Viet-Thai grille for the best pho and pad thai ever!"}
{"text":"Came here on Saturday afternoon with Minsters to get pho after a night out. We ended up talking and hanging out in the restaurant for a hour after we finished eating.  Restaurant didn't mind while some places hate it.

The place is clean and pretty large.  It must get busier during the buffet hours.  The staff was helpful but nothing special stands out about the service.

Pho was a little more than other places, like $1 more.  It's not a huge difference but it's not like their pho has better flavors or portions than other places in Charlotte. 

TIP: Onion-lovers, ask for a plate of sliced onions and squeeze some Hoisin and Sriracha sauce onto it.  Then coat the raw onion rings well with the sauces.  Grab a little and enjoy it in the same bite with noodles.  Standard trick all pho people should know!

dmo out."}
{"text":"This place is solid; very authentic fresh Vietnamese food, prompt service, reasonable prices, and comfortable atmosphere. We certainly plan to visit again and were relieved to find this place, being new to Charlotte (coming from NYC)."}
{"text":"Awesome place! This is the first time I had a Vietnamese buffet. The food selection is very good, the flavors are great! Definitely 5 stars! Also, great service, they took away the empty plates promptly."}
{"text":"I've been eating here for the past 10 years. It's one of the better Vietnamese restaurants in Charlotte. My favorite dishes here are the grilled pork and shrimp rice dish, seafood noodle soup with egg noodles, and their Bun Bo Hue, which is a hearty beef noodle soup made with beef knuckles and tendons. Their Pho is decent. Their vermicelli is ok. The staff here is very nice and service is quite prompt. Your water is always refilled instantly. Highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Saigon did not disappoint on the combo pho , I love that they allowed me to exclude certain items and just have the soup without the noodles . I'm definitely a pho enthusiast so I have many prior experiences with other establishments to judge the taste scale . 

I am giving 3stars bc there just wasn't a WOW factor with the soup flavor , it had me feeling content on getting my pho fix but I started thinking of other soups I've had that just tasted better . I didn't like the minimal selection of side sauces to add an extra kick of spice , I'm use to the hot pepper oil, sesame oil, hoisin sauce , etc being available but there was only sirracha and soy sauce on the table. If you are looking to receive fast and friendly service you will get it here , the prices are pretty standard and the ambiance casual , there is a buffet option but I didn't have a chance to check it out."}
{"text":"This review is for the Sunday buffet only:

I love Viet food and I need my weekly fixing of pho and summer rolls to energize me for the next week. So when I heard Saigon does buffet on the weekend it sounded like music to my ears. 

The restaurant was stuffed with patrons, half did buffet while half still ordered a la carte. I could see why because the buffet section was pretty weak: it consisted of 2 steam tables located in the back of the restaurant. However I came too far to back down so I stuffed myself with the buffet's offerings. The buffet was split into 4 sections: 

1. Soup section: they had bun bo hue broth (one of my favorite Viet dishes) that you can add to the noodles on the side. I also tried the beef tendon and carrot stew which tasted really good. My biggest concern would be the level of heat (or lack of) from the steam table. The soup was lukewarm and that is a big no no for Vietnamese broth.
2. Standard cooked Viet dishes. They had sautéed noodles, various meat dishes, spring rolls and my favorite: quail. All were pretty standard in flavor but the quail seemed to be the showstopper 
3. DIY noodle bar. They had 2 different type of noodles, noodle toppings and fish sauce where you can customized your noodle dish to your liking.
4. Dessert: pretty weak but that was ok for me since I wasn't looking for dessert coming in.

Would I come in again? Probably not. While I like Vietnamese food, the quality was too poor for me to make the trip over again. There are so many options on south boulevard that Saigon really needs to step it up."}
{"text":"Not the best Vietnamese in Charlotte but in the top five. Staff is friendly. The food is good and not expensive."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for 2 years and can't seem to get enough. The grilled chicken w/rice plate is to die for. I was a hardcore PHO eater here bud when I had the chicken and rice my life was changed. Lol"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. Best pho in town.
Great service. The bubble tea are also to die for."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and tasty food. Great atmosphere. Very memorable experience."}
{"text":"I love this place. I can't believe it's been right up the street the whole time. They have the best pho in Charlotte IMO. For an introvert like me it is perfect. It's never really crowded and they have great seating. 

They have so many varieties of Pho / Seafood Soup. My favorite is the number 75. They take stir fry the noodles in sweet chili sauce and then put the broth on the side so you can pour it on yourself. It is such a satisfying meal. They also have another one that has shrimp dumplings in the pho! It's amazing! You'll never finish a bowl yourself.

But that's okay. You can bring it home with you. I had to buy pho spoons from Amazon just to keep the authentic feeling at home. They also have some really good appetizers I suggest the garlic wings. They are to die for. 

I like Bruno Mars and I don't think what he's doing is cultural appropriation. There I said it. And I'm not saying that just because he has some jams. He seems like a really respectful guy who gives credit where it's due. Please send all your disagreements to Justin Timberlake on Twitter."}
{"text":"Rad, chrome and red, amazing prehistoric fish-tanked Oriental dining hall aesthetic. Large lazy susan full to overflowing with condiments (fish sauce! oil based chili that isn't as hot as it looks! etc) and utensils sitting in the middle of your table. 

Decent selection of tofu entrees and apps, but the veggie pho is where it's at. Ever since our Viet-training-wheel event, I've been 
semi-obsessed with vegetarian pho and have had it at a number of queen city mainstays - but Saigon's is best, has all the correct additions, and is almost the cheapest. So that's awesome.

Other than that, the menu is ok but less extravagant than BT's or LV's. Those guys set a high bar, and there it is. But as they do not have a vegetarian pho option, I will drive out here to order Saigon's. Happily."}
{"text":"Besssst Vietnam food I ever had in states. Went there twice and ordered hotpot for the second time. For the ice coffee, I estimated 3 shots of espresso in top filter. Bottom whiteish thing is made of concentrated cream and sugar. I made a two fold dilution with ice water to make it drinkable otherwise it's really bitter. Anyway something worth a shot!!!Highly recommend for noodle soup lover:)) servers are nice but sometime slow responding. Overall a nice place to go!"}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service. The menu is pretty thick! The wife and I came in for some Pho since we pass this place a million times. The prices were pretty high!! XL giant bowl of Pho dac biet was like $15 geez!! The flavor was mediocre. For the amount of meat was not worth it.. Meatballs were sliced thin, small tendon and shredded beef.   Veggies are cheap cant be stingy!!"}
{"text":"I visited this place in August & omgoodness the pho was phenomenal! The flavors was on point! The best pho I've had lately. Super tasty! I got the seafood pho(first time venturing far from beef) sooo happy I did because it exceeded my expectations! 

This place is conveniently place super close to where I live soo this I love!!"}
{"text":"Very good food, great service at a good price.  Our favorite Vietnamese place by far.  Never had a bad experience here."}
{"text":"Best Vietnamese food I've found in Charlotte. I have traveled to Saigon and had many fine meals there, and this restaurant seems very authentic, although I'm sure they get better meat here and the nuc mam has been tamed somewhat for American tastes. Pho is also great. Have enjoyed everything I've ever gotten from Saigon Palace."}
{"text":"Sooooo...I'm not huge fan of Chinese food but my boyfriend loves it. I prefer Vietnamese food so what do we do for a compromise? Saigon Palace. 

This place is good. The menu is really extensive and the servers are helpful. The food is always fresh and comes out hot (like, scald the roof of your mouth hot). I decided on our last visit to venture into the Chinese side of the menu and try shrimp lo mein. It was pretty good but I still prefer their Vietnamese dishes. My boyfriend tried these Chinese wings and said they were \"just ok\". He loves the egg rolls though because they are \"meaty\". 

Try this place out but go with the Vietnamese dishes."}
{"text":"First time here. We were sat imeaditaly by a very nice waiter. Service was excellent and had a beautiful presentation and yummy!  Delicious. The thing I liked the best, music was low and beautiful and you could actually have a conversation.  That's becoming very rare in Charlotte. And even better they have a 97 sanitation grade hundred percent in my book."}
{"text":"I had the chicken Pho. Big serving, delicious!  Waiter could have been more friendly but food came out fast and it was yummy!"}
{"text":"For all the Pho lovers out there this is probably the best in Charlotte and also one of the biggest. As a long time fan of Ben Thanh for there general consistency, which most local Vietnamese restaurants lack, I've found Saigon to out do them across the board.  

Definitely recommend for Pho!  Sure works for the morning after a night of drinking..."}
{"text":"Last night was a first for a few things. Let's start with the appetizer. We ordered butter fried quail. I've never had it before but it comes out similar to wings. It was actually incredible! (I was on a date and that didn't stop me from man-handling these bad boys) they were delicious. I had never had Vietnamese food before so I asked the waitress what she recommended and she said #45. This was a noodle bowl with pork(that was to die for) and a bunch of stuff. I honestly can't even tell what all was in there but don't worry it's listened in the menu. Because I was knew to this I didn't know you pour the sauce that comes with it on top. This took my meal over the top! I absolutely LOVED it. So much flavor and so fresh. To top of the meal, and the date, I just had to have \"bubble tea\" or boba as I know it. I had mango and my date had strawberry. Go with the mango . Overall, I absolutely love this place and the food! I am an absolute fan and will be back many, many times."}
{"text":"You know how people have sugar cravings? I have Pho cravings. One of my happiest days in Charlotte was when I discovered Saigon. I usually have their vegetarian Pho, and have only tried their chicken and tofu entrees, which have all been great.  If you're a tofu fan.. try the Lemongrass tofu!
Yesterday for the first time I had the coffee there... it was terrific! Extremely strong french press, with condensed milk, on ice. 
Granted that the coffee and pho combo is a little weird, so I'd recommend you not consume them simultaneously :P But if you conclude your meal with the coffee, it not only serves as dessert (thanks to the condensed milk), but also prevents food coma."}
{"text":"This place is great! I love the soups! Try the jack fruit shake for desert you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"One of our favorites. Eat here regularly.  We usually start with the spring rolls with peanut dipping sauce. Pork vermicelli or beef pho are great. Our vegetarian daughter likes the vegetarian pho.  We eat the chicken salad for something lighter. There's a Chinese menu too, and it's pretty good."}
{"text":"Did I just get punked?

Seriously, 4 star rating.  I can expect something at least pretty good right???  Boy was I wrong.  Let me break it down for ya.

Pho dac biet - Tasted okay.  Expensive as hell.  10 for a regular? Get a xe lua and you're looking at Vegas prices.

Com bi xuon chung - Okay, 10 dollars for... a few slices of cucumber and tomato,  a fork full of bi, 1 highly undercooked egg, and the toughest slice of porkchop I have ever had.  The overall problem besides the tough as leather meat, was the pretty bad nuoc mam.

Bun Bo Xao - The friggin noodles were so undercooked.  And again, the nuoc mam was blah.

To sum it all up... MEEEEHHH.  The food was all just MEH for a big price tag.  Maybe, the reviews are good because this is the best the area has to offer.  I was ready for Ashton Kutcher to pop out at any time to save me from the MEHness."}
{"text":"I've never been impressed, but I know I can get a pretty solid meal here. (Well at least during lunch, since I've yet to venture here for dinner.) 

The chinese lunch specials are pretty decent, the pho is edible, though sometimes a little thin and the noodles ALWAYS come in a huge clumped mess... I'm constantly having to tear the ball apart with my chopsticks. However, the meats on top are always generous portions and fairly nice cuts. I've dabbled with some of their other soup selections, but I've always gone back to the phos.

The service is just what you need to get in and out during your lunch hour without feeling rushed, and the larger space definitely gives a bit more a bustling ambiance than some of the smaller asian restaurants in town, especially if they pack you in an area surrounded by other full tables. Definitely a little louder than some other lunch spots I hit, but in a good way, I don't feel like everything I say is echoing off the walls."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews, and being a vietnamese/pho fan, I decided to check out Saigon Palace this past Sunday.  Having never been, I checked out the buffet, which had a great selection, I was a little overwhelmed and asked to order from the menu. Maybe not the right choice since the menu was 7+ pages long, with very little descriptions.  I started with the spring rolls & peanut sauce, and the egg drop soup, both very good. I then ordered the shrimp with vegetables and fried rice. The portions were very large, which I enjoyed for dinner, but both good.  I will say the fried rice was the BEST I have found in Charlotte!
As for the three, here goes.  Although the food was good, I was disappointed with the overall service.  There are plenty of waiters there to attend to you, however, there isn't one specifically assigned to your table so there are different people bringing the water, meal, receipt, etc. which turned out to be a mess. And, without knowing how the restaurant works I felt a little out of place.  I will say that I will definitely go back and try the buffet as that seemed to be the thing to do among most of the other patrons.
Overall I enjoyed the meal and would recommend this spot for vietnamese and pho lovers."}
{"text":"During the week it has cheap(er) lunch special. And honestly, I much prefer Saigon Palace over Vietnam Grille from value standpoint; you definitely get more and better food here on any given day.

This Sunday I came to try the Sunday buffet ($13.95pp). I think it's worth the money. I love the fried quails which were perfectly seasoned. I think I got $14 worth of quails alone. And if you're into soup, you're in heaven. There were only half a dozen of soup base to choose from (mostly for you to put noodles in, but I kind of eat it plain). I personally thought their stir fried noodles with beef & veggies was the better noodle option. They also had rice soup which sadly I didn't have room for. The disappointing items was the summer rolls, you could tell they're made in a hurry, and the shrimp wasn't fresh. BUT the fried spring rolls more than enough made up for it. 

Overall for $14 it's a great value for an authentic vietnamese/chinese buffet."}
{"text":"Very good Vietnamese restaurant!  Had a combination meat pho and was totally satisfied. The broth was flavorful and was very filling. The place looks more Chinese than anything else but I was happy to find a good Vietnamese restaurant in Charlotte. It was a quick blue-line train ride from my hotel in uptown."}
{"text":"Lately, we've been doing a good amount of takeout from Saigon Palace. It's very close to home, they never screw up the order and the Pho is flipping fantastic. I get the Pho Ga which is simply chicken soup and my wife has been enjoying the Pho Chay (a vegetarian soup).

The takeout is well organized with separate containers for the broth and for the noodles. And another separate container for the bean sprouts, limes, hot peppers and fresh basil leaves.

I don't know about the other foods they offer. The last time I had the Chinese, it was just meh. But the pho? It's PHO-bulous."}
{"text":"A huge restaurant with a decent parking space. Upon entering I was very confused by the decor. It would seem that the restaurant was either experiencing an identify crisis between being Chinese/Vietnamese or the Vietnamese people just took over a Chinese restaurant. The decor was also very tacky and outdated. Water lines and paint chipping off is evident around the restaurant. Not detoured by the atmosphere we were seated promptly. The server was nice and the service was decent. We ordered the shrimp spring rolls and garlic chicken. The shrimp spring rolls tasted delightful - fresh and light. On the other hand, the garlic chicken was OKAY. The chicken was cooked perfectly. However the sauce was hideous. You could not taste the garlic and it just seemed like they masked the friend chicken with teriyaki sauce. If i were them I would just dust the chicken with garlic powder and lightly fry it. The price was fair. Overall this place is ok. However due to the tacky decor, identity crisis and weird sauce I would not come back. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Tried this on a whim. I'm so glad I did because it was really good. The food was very flavorful and the service was great. They also have Chinese dishes for the more particular people in your group. I can't wait to go back and try something different."}
{"text":"This place was excellent.  The service was great and the food was delicious.  The broth in the pho wasn't overly salty and they do not skimp on the portion size.  I'll definitely recommend this to any of my friends and will be back.!!!"}
{"text":"Not the worse, but far from the best. Consistent and reliable is what they are. The brunch here is always a steal with a great selection of traditional dishes and desserts.

Pho is okay and so are the other dishes. Service is pretty good and they'll easily take care of a large group. They need a little guidance on splitting checks though."}
{"text":"We went here for the Sunday brunch. For the variety of food for the price, this is a great value. I will definitely come back and will tell both family and friends."}
{"text":"Found myself here after a night of running errands along South Blvd.  This restaurant is in an older shopping/business area so the parking lot is not as well traversed.  It shares the parking lot with Office Depot and some other businesses but I found it a little ominous that it wasn't as busy.  The restaurant front does make a first impression with its red neon lights.  I admit, I was a little skeptical at first, but I really was surprised.

Was craving Pho and their menu does tout there presence as a noodle house, but it also offers Chinese food offerings.  There is also a setup for a buffet (I would imagine its only set up for lunch).

The dining room is a bit cavernous... large chandeliers hang from the ceiling from a couple of decades removed and the murals of jungle windows make for an interesting ambiance.

Servers are quick and friendly... always making sure we had water and that we were okay.  The overall dining experience was great and the food was a treat.  I had the chicken pho. I was super excited to see a variety of vegetables hidden in my pho.  Yes you get the standard, beans, mint, and  jalapenos to drop in...  but there was a generous portion of chicken and noodles... pea pods, carrots, mushrooms, broccoli, and lettuce made it like a treasure hunt to see what veggies you can dig up on your next bite.

My friend ordered from their standard Chinese menu... sesame chicken... it looked delicious and had larger chicken portions (less breading) and the rice came separate.  

Will have to come back and try more things off their menu.  I feel like this is a place that doesn't get enough cred."}
{"text":"I am probably a Vietnamese restaurant owner's least favorite customer - growing up with excellent Vietnamese restaurants in Orange County, CA, I admit, I can be hyper critical.  By the same token, satisfy my hunger for comfort food and I will sing a restaurant's praises until the cow's come home.

Saigon Palace is the first Vietnamese restaurant I've eaten at in Charlotte.  When I saw the unassuming strip mall and the restaurant sign, I had to stop and try a taste of home.

The restaurant is spacious, more like a Chinese banquet hall then is typical of a Vietnamese restaurant.  The menu has the usual staples, but somewhat concerning were the Chinese dishes and buffet that they offered - all atypical of a \"real\" Vietnamese restaurant.  However, the staff were indeed Vietnamese (I could understand what they were saying.)

I ordered the Bun Thit Nuong Cha Gio (Vermicelli, Pork and Egg Rolls).  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great.  The dipping sauce was very sweet and did not have the body and depth of good dipping sauces.  The meat was cooked well and pretty good.  The egg roll was mediocre.  As a whole, the dish was average.  Priced around $8, I am sorry, but I expect more.

I'd try it again, but wasn't all that impressed during my first visit.  The atmosphere is confusing - with buffet tables and a large interior, it left me cold."}
{"text":"I don't get the 4 star rating here. We came here because the place up the street was closed and I really wanted some Vietnamese food. 

We ordered a few appetizers. First let me say this, I couldn't believe they charge almost $8 for 4 fried eggrolls with lettuce. This is the highest I have seen for this anywhere in my life and I was immediately turned off. That is just highway robbery. So we ordered the 2 individual ones and they were alright. Not bad, but not the worse. Just okay.

We also ordered the garlic chicken wings which are deep fried chicken wings covered in this amazing sauce. This was hands down the best thing we ate. I mean it was delicious.

My 4 year old son loves pho but with broth and noodles only. They didn't have a kid option and they charged me $8.00 for a bowl of noodles and broth. I repeatedly asked for noodles and broth only, no onions, no cilantro but of course it came out with all onions and cilantro. If you are making me pay $8 for a bowl of noodles and hot water, you can at least bring it the way I asked.

I ordered a bowl of bun bo hue for myself and it was lacking serious flavor. It was too oily and with the lack of flavor, I was mad at myself for even ordering it. I asked for shrimp paste to try to help give the broth some flavor and instead they brought me chili oil. I get it, they probably didn't expect me to ask for shrimp paste but at least listen to me and don't assume that I don't know what I am asking for. They finally brought it out and while it helped the soup some, it couldn't save it.

My man ordered a stir-fry dish with meat and veggies and he said it was just okay. He didn't finish it and he didn't want to bring the leftovers home, which means he really didn't care for it.

Yeah, we won't be back."}
{"text":"One of the most consistent Vietnamese restaurant in Charlotte. Great portion for the price. One of my all time go-to's."}
{"text":"Service was great. For this meal I ordered the Bun cha gio thit nuong, pho dac biet and rice paper rolls. The cost of the food was average for the area. The pork in my dish was wondeful. Had a great taste. I do think the noodles could have been cooked slightly longer. The atmosphere is casual and slightly busy for a weekday. I felt the tables were a little to close together. At least in our case they were. We could hear every part of the conversation of the table next to us. This could be that they were absolutely rude and very loud. Im aware that some of the dishes are hard to pronounce when ordering but to intentionally butcher the names and laugh was dissrespectful. Then again this truly doesnt have much to do with the restaurant itself but the people at the next table. Its why I bring up the issue of the tables being close together. The Pho itself was a really large portion which made my husband very happy. He had a hard time finishing,  which is rare. The noodles were cooked enough and did not remain in clumps. He ordered the dac biet version which usually comes with pieces of tripe. In this case it was cut into strips. We will definately visit again."}
{"text":"When you think of Sunday brunch Vietnamese food is typically not at the top of the list, but after visiting Saigon Palace you'll quickly change your mind.  I've been going to this spot for months now and it has consistently been a wonderful experience.

If you're unfamiliar with Vietnamese food then this is a great place to start.  They have plenty of options if you're a hardcore vegetarian and lots to choose from if you LOVE pork.  Their normal menu is a bit on the pricey side, so I suggest doing the Sunday brunch buffet.  The shrimp spring rolls alone are worth the price of admission and the Vietnamese pancakes (Banh Xeo) are mouth watering.

Quick tip, try to go early if you can.  There are many, many families that come here.  For some it's a weekly tradition.  Going early is key to avoiding the rush.  Also, you have to try their Vietnamese iced coffee made with condensed milk.  The combination of espresso and sugar are enough to knock you out of any food coma."}
