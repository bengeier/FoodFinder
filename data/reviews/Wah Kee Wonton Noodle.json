{"text":"I go here all the time for the giant bowl of noodle soup (I always order #19).  The three-flavored fish is also fantastic.  I have never had a bad experience here--my only complaint is the inconsistent inventory of beer.  My advice is to order the authentic stuff and stay away from the Chinese-American dishes.  I have been at a table where people ordered both, and the difference is like night and day."}
{"text":"This restaurant is very great to din in. Reddish cake, sticky rice on lotus leaf, yaw choi are great appetizers! Wonton noodles is tasty too. Not pricy."}
{"text":"The noodle soups are great, and all basically taste the same. You get thin noodles, some meat, some wantons or dumplings, scallions, and broth.  Some have ginger.    I tried a chicken and chestnut dish once, and it was really very tasty, but not what I was expecting, as they were actual chestnuts, and not water chestnuts.    They also seem to have all the usual stand-bys.  Beef w/ broccoli and the like.  This seems like the wrong place to order that kind of shit though."}
{"text":"Love this place! The first time I came I ordered three things and I keep ordering them every time because they're so good! The potstickers are flavorful, fresh, and doughy, with a bit of a crispy crust. The Singapore fried rice-stick noodles are amazing. The noodles are flavorful, fresh, and full of shrimp, bbq pork, egg, and peppers, all extremely delicious. The Beef stir-fried rice stick is in a rich, sweet brown sauce. The noodles taste very fresh, and the sauce has an intriguing depth. The food is pretty salty, so be sure to drink a lot of water, but otherwise a hit!"}
{"text":"I feel so lucky to be in Madison, where there are a myriad of Chinese restaurants to choose from. Yes, different parts of China has their own distinctive flavors and style, so Chinese restaurants vary a lot as to what they offer.   The owner originates from the hong kong/guangdong area, speaking Cantonese. I know we are in good hands here. Since this is a Cantonese-based restaurant, the dishes I tried are from the Canton region. Hence once again, similar to my reviews of other Chinese places, it doesn't apply to American-Chinese food, since these are not what I usually get.   They do their traditional cuisines right -- you can't go wrong with their claypot rice. Do note that claypot rice takes a longer time to make compared to other dishes. The wait is absolutely worth it, just ensure that you are not in a rush afterwards.   Hong Kong style noodles (soup or dry) are equally good too. They come in a variety of ingredients for your selection, my favorites are the classic wonton noodles. Those wontons come wrapped in nice thin wonton skin with lightly-marinated pork and shrimps in them *yummy*  Their congee is also another one of the highlights! It's super smooth and flavorful. But note that congees are only available on weekends up to ~ 2 pm or whenever they are out. You can order them with fish, pork, beef or chicken. The congee is so smooth and soft that you can just swallow them without chewing! I am seriously considering ordering these for my upcoming wiscom teeth removal ~~   Most of the Canton dishes are not spicy by nature, but for the adventurous eaters out there who loves spicy food, they have home made hot sauce out there for you! If you fall in love with their hot sauce, they do offer it to go as well, so you can add it to any dishes that you make at home."}
{"text":"I only have ordered the Tong Mein #26 (Ginger, Scallion, and Gyoza) and substitute for Udon Noodles and the Potstickers.  Both are delicious.  This place is one of those great secrets that is not even known by many that live in Madison. This may be due to the location.  I might be biased because this is where I used to go with my best friend when I was a student at UW. Every year we have a reunion and go back and order the same thing. Same friendly service that recognizes us and welcomes us back each time for the last 4 years.  The Tong Mein from Wah-Kee is the best Chinese food I have ever eaten."}
{"text":"Wah Kee's specialty is their homemade wonton noodle. So if you want to be safe and have a good dining experience, go with their specialty noodle menu. Whenever I get a chance to go there, I always order their wonton noodle.  And it never disappoint me.  They make the best wonton with thin wrap (the key for a good authentic wonton).    I also like their fried rice with salted-fish and chicken. It taste similar to the one I had in Hong Kong.  And if you like green vegetables cooked authentic Chinese-style, they are the only one in town (I think) who offer stir-fry green vegetables (with garlic) on the menu.  Service could take longer sometime, especially when the restaurant is busy.  But if you know what you want, just order it immediately as soon as you are seated.  This will safe you a lot of time to get your foods served."}
{"text":"For some reason, the food at Wah Kee Wonton is just a little bit more special than most other American Asian restaurants around the Madison area. Maybe it's the handmade noodles, or the authentic cooking, large portions, and low (read: extremely affordable) menu prices. Who knows. All I know is that I love this place.   Delivery was fast, and I receive my food from an old Asian man, which is a good sign. That's when you know the food is going to be very awesome.  P.S. The pho here is excellent. Top quality noodles and broth. Coming from the west coast, I have unfairly high standards and expectations for good pho, and Wah Kee Wonton exceeded them.  The ja jang mein (Korean black bean noodles) is delicious, too."}
{"text":"Had the Singapore noodles and the potstickers. The potstickers were pretty good-- a mixture of deep fried/pan-fried with a small amount of meat and vegetables inside. Relatively thick dumpling skin compared to filling.   Singapore noodles were a total waste. Considering that this was a \"specialty\" of theirs, I was hoping that this dish would be of decent quality but it just lacked flavor and  diversity in ingredients. Four shrimp and maybe two ounces of chicken along with chewy noodles that were not seasoned. Very disappointing and pricey as well."}
{"text":"An amazing find. Handmade Japanese noodles and gyoza won tons were delicious. One of those meals one will remember.  Ambience is friendly and simple clean decor. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"My family always stop by Wah Kee if we're ever passing through Madison. If you're looking for a rice dish, you're probably better off ordering it someplace else. As their name suggests, their specialty is wonton noodle soup and that's the one dish we order here.  Their bbq pork is decent but the flavor isn't strong as traditional bbq pork. Their noodles are homemade, which is what makes it so unique and worth trying. Their wonton is amazing as well. They use large sized shrimp and the wonton peel is very thin. Also, make sure to ask for their homemade chili oil! A great addition to the broth if you enjoy some spice.  One last important note: Make sure to check the hours before you get there. They take a lunch break from 2:30-4:30 PM."}
{"text":"As a Chinese, I think this Chinese good is really amazing. Unlike other chinese restaurant , this restaurant use more good quality ingredients and  more fresh stuff to make their food.  Not really oily and taste strong. But it was just delicious!  Price is really reasonable and great service. Will go back again!"}
{"text":"I always have the beef and egg or ja jang meinn!!one of my favorite take out places for Chinese food in madison!!"}
{"text":"I've been here 3 or four times and Everytime I'm here, I'd have pork hock rice entree. Have to say it is one of the best and most authentic Chinese dish here in Madison. On the other hand, I've also tried like wonton noodles and some other stuff. They were okay. Chinese restaurants in Madison don't seem to be good at noodles.  Oh and make sure to check out their chicken wings. Very yummy."}
{"text":"The dishes are made of animal oil which is super unhealthy. And the dishes are cooked without carelessness. My dish is even with some black iron flake from the pan ( usually it comes from unclean pan). These unsanitary dishes make them more disgusting...I think the rate is highly overrated...."}
{"text":"BEST NOODLES EVER ! Their drunken noodles are awesome and my favorite comfort food. Bring back fond memories of South East asia and the street food carts. Don't miss it"}
{"text":"Pad Thai was pretty awful. No flavor. All the other reviews say good things- I will be back to explore!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Asian restaurants in Madison. It's the only restaurant in Madison that serves authentic Hong Kong style cuisine, which I am so grateful for. My S.O. and I always get either the tong mein with wonton and gyoza or the rice in claypot dishes. Their homemade wonton and gyoza are perfectly seasoned, very tasty. Gyozas have minced pork, shrimp, and ample seasoning. Noodles are great too and taste much better than frozen ones. Add in some Chinese cabbage to the delicious broth and you have a great, well-balanced meal!   This is a no frills restaurant so go for the food and don't expect too much from a service standpoint. Service can be slow and minimal... Which can be frustrating but I love the food too much to fault the place.  Final note- I wouldn't recommend other dishes beyond the tong mein and rice in claypot. I hope more people would discover and appreciate this gem of a restaurant!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I hadn't found any Asian food in Madison that I loved but this place just rocks. I had the Mo Po Tofu (vegetarian)."}
{"text":"I give 2 stars for the portion size and the speedy delivery. The food itself however, had MUCH to be desired. The wonton noodle soup was tasteless and the beef noodle dish was swimming in some sort of oily gelatin mixture. Honestly, the worst food we've had in a long time. I'm still bewildered by the raving reviews I see."}
{"text":"I ordered the dirty rice thinking it was going to be like real Cajun dirty rice. It's not! They make it like it was fried rice. It doesn't have any chicken giblet flavor (that's what give the rice that brownish color) and it didn't have chopped up bits of chicken gizzards either. Popeye's dirty rice tastes better. Anyways, if you want the flavor of dirty rice akin to what is served down in 'nawleans, don't get this."}
{"text":"The food was late.  Some of it was good.  The crab Ragoons were nearly all cream cheese.  I could see a few tiny specks of red in it.  Also, our noodle dish had burnt noodles in it.  Almost as if they microwaved them without water.  You could taste and smell that they were bot burnt.  Everything else did have good flavor though."}
{"text":"Wah Kee is our go-to place, tops on the list when what we want is simple, deeply satisfying Chinese. The Americanized dishes are OK, no different than a dozen other places. The menu is huge and extensive, and I've never had a bad dish off of it.   But WahKee was doing honest, from-the-houtou Chinese comfort food long before anyone else in town, and it shows. The noodle bowls are just the right size, with an understated broth that lets their great noodles shine. It's a great meal all it's own when ordered with gyoza and wonton dumplings.  My wife (who moved the US as an adult) almost always gets the pork hock. And then she has to defend it from me! It's rich and savory, and the succulent skin has a smooth, luscious texture that's hard to describe -- a lot like perfect pork belly.   Vietnamese is not my thing, but I am told by friends that know well -- their Viet dishes are just as authentic, and just as good.  I dunno -- it's supposed to be below zero again tonight. Perfect time for a noodle bowl."}
{"text":"1st, I am Chinese and am an avid Chinese cook.  Many of the things that I make are recipes passed from generation to generation.  Some of them my friends parents don't even know how to make.  I am not claiming to be an expert, just noting my background so people understand what my background is and take it all into consideration when reading this review.  I am not a huge fan of trying Chinese food away from the 'big' Chinatowns, so this was somewhat of a surprise (in a good way).  General Gau's, Sweet & Sour blah, chicken fingers, etc ARE NOT chinese food....so when I heard that 'authentic' was in Wah Kee's menu, I thought I would give it a try.  I had the Wonton Noodle Soup with the Roast Pork and spring rolls on the side.  Very good on both orders.  Broth was very close to what you would get from NYC, Boston, Montreal, SF and Chicago.  The egg noodles were standard, but i wasn't exactly expecting them to be bad either.  The Wontons were authentic and tasted great.  They were large and plentiful (5-6 i think) with great flavor.     The spring rolls were definitely home made are are not like the little fried Vietnamese ones you get at the store or restaurant (where they buy them frozen).  these were HUGE and the generous portions of ingredients is a rarity these days.  Overall, this is one of the best Chinese restaurants I have been to outside of the 'big' cities mentioned above.  Authentic soups, noodles and wontons are delicious and should not be passed up.  I gave it 5 stars solely based on the fact that it is in MADISON, WI!!!...4 stars if it was in the big city.  I will try some other noodle dishes and report back."}
{"text":"This restaurant has great potential, but consistency problems. Other reviews will show that the food is excellent, but is sabotaged by poor service.  In my case tonight, (even though I had a great experience before, which is what brought me back) a takeout order took over 1:30 hours and arrived COLD and tasteless. Microwave helped a little, but had the order been done right...I'm sure it would have been delicious.  So....take your chances. It could be great. But if it takes more than 45 minutes, you might want to refuse it at the door. Hope they improve!"}
{"text":"On the business trip drive through Madison. Found this place at late night .they have huge menu. But found out just like the shop name says all. Noodle soups awesome. The stir fry dishes just so so .nothing  impress."}
{"text":"This was the worst delivery experience I have ever experienced. My husband and I ordered delivery from here for the first time and will absolutely be the last time. The delivery took 1 1/2 hours and we live approximately one mile away. They charged us for more food than we received and when we called to discuss this, their solution was to pick up the food from us and reimburse us. This was the example of the worst customer service and we will definitely not be returning."}
{"text":"Wah Kee rises above your standard Chinese restaurant with outstanding noodles and soups.  According to the menu, the restaurant makes its own noodles and the quality is apparent when you take a first bite.  I usually come here for the soups, which are very filling and top off at about $8 or so.  You can choose from a variety of noodles, meats, and dumplings.  People who appreciate heaping portions of soup and anyone who enjoys Japanese-style ramen will find Wah Kee to fit the bill."}
{"text":"I went there because craving for wonton mee. they do serve pretty good wonton mee. I've also order egg custard but disappointed because we know it's frozen food."}
{"text":"This is probably in my top 5 for favorite restaurants of Madison. And I'll tell you why.   Appetizers Spring rolls are great. Fresh and tasty. I am a total crab rangoon snob and they make excellent crab rangoon. I've gotten pot stickers a bunch of times there and its always really good. Only had the Kim Chee once. I'm not into spicy foods so I didn't like it but the person I was with who DID like spicy foods told me it was good Kim Chee.  Soup Always really flavorful. Good broth to veggie/meat ratios. You basically can't go wrong with any of the soups.   Noodles Stir fry can be a little greasy but oh MAN. There is like... a smoke flavor? I'm not sure what it is. But its delicious. Pad Thai is good.   Vegetarian options I was a vegetarian for two years and I had no problems finding things to eat here.   All in all. I really think Wah Kee is one of the best restaurants in the area. And absolutely affordable."}
{"text":"I think restaurants should be rated primarily on their food, and boy did Wah Kee earn high praise for just that.  But first, let's talk about the turn-offs. Walking into the restaurant, I was immediately hit with a strong smell that screamed authentic Chinese restaurant. Maybe it was the humid weather or maybe it was something in the kitchen, but I was actually quite bothered by this smell. The service was at best average. We received minimal attention from the waitress, but we were so absorbed in the menu and the food that it didn't bother us too much. A fly kept flying around our table, but luckily we were almost done with our meal before it really started to annoy us. Overall, the environment could have been better to enhance the dining experience.  However, with all that being said, the food here exceeded our expectations and then some. We started off with the scallion pancakes, which were delicious! The dough was so soft and chewy yet crispy on the outside. We each ordered a noodle dish from their house specials section of the menu. The noodles themselves were of very high quality and definitely deserved the highest praise of the night. They were soft yet slightly chewy and bouncy, an indicator of authentic homemade noodles. The zha jiang noodles came with a good amount of sauce and vegetables, although they clearly used frozen vegetables. The Szechuan dan dan noodles were spicy but tolerable, and this is coming from someone who has very low tolerance for heat. The seafood broth was very savory, and the shrimp and beef pieces complimented the noodles and broth very well. Overall, both of the noodle dishes we tried were well balanced in terms of flavor and portion-size.  While the dining experience could have been better, the noodles were truly exceptional and that's what we will come here for, again and again."}
{"text":"I loved this place when I was a kid, their noodles and soups were always my favorites. I came back recently with my husband who has never been to the restaurant I raved about. Trying to recreate my delightful experiences i had growing up I ordered some noodle soup, my husband ordered a dish called 'salted fish'. Our order came and the salted fish wasn't what he had expected, and to me the fish was the ocean equivalent of eating limburger cheese. This dish could have been 'salted fish' but my husband didnt want it. So he politely asked if it could be taken back, the waiter went to speak with the manager... well this somehow offended the manager, and he very angrily said he would not take it back, and since he was with an \"oriental' - im filipina by the way- he should have known what the salted fish would be.  so sad. i used to like this place until i knew the manager was a crotchety racist a$$hole."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I joined Yelp just so I could write this review. I should also mention that I have eaten at Wah Kee on five separate occasions and am a fan of their food. Tonight, however, I had a truly awful experience.  When we were seated, we weren't given water, silverware, or menus. I had to pick up takeout menus from the front counter. We weren't even addressed by the waitstaff for twenty minutes. Once we got our order in, we waited another twenty minutes for our drinks. Despite our server actively trying to avoid eye contact with us, I was able to stop her and ask for my soda. She told us that they had run out of glassware, and it would be some time before we were able to get our drinks. Ten minutes later, we had our drinks. We waited another forty for our food.  After the meal, I requested to speak to the manager. The server said that a lot of people had made the same request tonight, but the manager was not willing to address any of the customers' concerns. She then told us that no discount would be given and invited us to write a note for the manager.  I work in a restaurant. I'm not the greatest at what I do, but I can tell when a server and management isn't doing their jobs as best as they can. I want to offer Wah Kee a few pointers so they can get back to what they do best: serving delicious food.  1. Greet your guests with a smile. 2. Provide water, silverware, and menus as soon as your guests sit down. 3. If the restaurant is busy, tell your guests it might take a minute or two for the server to visit the table. 4. Be ready for busy nights. 5. Be attentive to your guests' needs; look for empty glasses, or eye contact from tables. 6. Solve problems. For example, if there's a shortage on silverware, glasses, and menus, provide your guests with the takeout equivalents or wash a few dishes. 7. Do what you can to ensure a positive experience for your guests. Listen to complaints and offer what you can so they'll return.  What really stinks is that the servers, not the customers, are the ones who suffer for the poor management at Wah Kee. Because of bad policy and inadequate training, their servers aren't making as much money as they could. I hope my server finds a new job. Her manager is a liability to her paycheck."}
{"text":"Ate here on a business trip after reading the reviews on Yelp. I ordered the Jambong soup and was hoping for a big bowl yumminess.  Unfortunately my dinner was rather disappointing, bland broth and the seafood would have been better named octopus legs. I will try again next time as I have been told the soups may be so-so, their standard Chinese fare is very good. fingers crossed  As for the comments below regarding 'The Orient' it quite simply means of the East, which last time I checked China was a large part of"}
{"text":"A great Chinese Restaurant.  Huge menu.  The Tong Mein is outstanding."}
{"text":"Ummm, I got sauce on half of my dinner.  I ordered Sesame Chicken which was probably the worst sesame chicken I have ever had.  It's hard to make it bad but this sure wasn't good.  And I got a box 3/4 full of white rice.  I am not impressed with what I got for the price, by any means.  Won't eat here again but my belly is full tonight."}
{"text":"Amazing soups! Wonton and noodle is my favorite combo, and their hot and sour soup is also delicious.  Besides New Seoul, they have the best kimchee I have found in Madison.  BBQ Pork Buns and Pot Stickers are also very tasty.  I went in for lunch today with a cold and left a cured woman! The server was friendly and didn't rush me at all. Lovely."}
{"text":"Delicious food, varied menu! Not the best ambience, but that's okay because the service is quick and friendly, and did I mention the food is good? Try N8!"}
{"text":"Decor is very tired. Bathroom has rust on the metal panels, duct tape on wall.   Chicken dumplings and congee were good; triple mushroom w tofu tasted canned."}
{"text":"Great food, good prices, incredible variety, personable owner and staff, clean interior, convenient location, nice music; 5 stars!!"}
{"text":"I'm long removed from the great Chinese restaurants of Chicago.  Nowadays I'm simply satisfied to be in Madison where I can actually get Chinese.  This spot is focused on Hong Kong/Cantonese.  Even when i get a craving for American Chinese take-out, I typically come here.  East to get to, easy to park (I'm from out of town, I drive, sue me).  Extensive menu with American-style Cantonese, some of which include traditional Cantonese vegetables over American-style.  I've seen people order traditional/home-style Cantonese dishes; if you know your way around that world, ask and you shall receive.  I'm always pleased with the food I get here.  Well-prepared, good flavorings if sometimes a bit mild.  The noodle dishes are recommended over the rice dishes.  Overall, really good comfort food, good service, no complaints from me.  And I'm not just saying that because I can't get good Chinese food where I live."}
{"text":"I went here with my friend to grab a quick bite/slurp before heading out for some drinks elsewhere. Overall, the food here was not too shabby. I ordered the wonton noodle soup with char siu. The dish had a well flavored broth, savory and light at the same time. The amount of char siu in the bowl was quite generous and had the typical flavor.    The filling of the wontons was good with a blend of pork and shrimp, but the wrappers seemed overcooked/too soggy. For me the noodles seemed on the thin side for a proper wonton noodle soup (and therefore came out on the post al-dente side), but I did appreciate that the noodles are made in house.   Surprisingly, it took a while (15+ minutes) for the soup to get to the table. Or perhaps not so surprisingly...it feels that most asian noodle soups in the city are put together at a snail's pace...   I'm not sure how the rest of the food is here, but the wonton noodle soup is worth giving a try."}
{"text":"My first time ordering here and I thought it was pretty good. I was not wowed but the food tasted good and was fresh. It is definitely not your typical Asian restaurant, the General Tao's chicken was freshly breaded and fried with lots of good, fresh broccoli.  The potstickers were enormous and delicious (5-star potstickers).  Overall I would order from here again and hope that I would have a 5-star experience, it was close this time."}
{"text":"Been there 3 times and will return. Excellent food (try the Bun-ga! not on menu but in specials forever), but moreover, su-per nice and helpful staff.  They've even got the best belgian beer (Duvel and leffe) for cheap."}
{"text":"I have been dining here for years. I recently introduced some extended family to it being they are moving to Madison in the ensuing months. They too are likely to be fans of wahkee for the next few decades.  Great lo mein, wontons and gyozos. Interior has little atmosphere and the bathrooms should be updated, years ago...  Great food though."}
{"text":"Came in and the host asked what he could do for me... get me a table so I can stuff my face please.  The table wasn't the cleanest. But the pho was nothing short of amazing. Huge bowl, I couldn't finish it.  The dumplings were wayyy to thick. Will not order them again and the spring rolls were more like egg rolls. Very large not the best."}
{"text":"Love this place! Authentic and fresh dishes! The pork hock is a must-try. All kinds of noodles. We also had five-spice beef as an entree. Fantastic!"}
{"text":"Native San Franciscan who knows authentic Chinese food. This place is delicious. Full of flavor and fresh. Absolutely a great homemade meal kind of feel.  Happy I eavesdropped in on the conversation on the plane. This was a great find in Madison. So far the food has not disappointed. Much love from a foodie."}
{"text":"Probably the best Chinese restaurant in town!  I often get the riblets with black bean sauce as a rice dish (R4) - the sauce is delicious with just the right amount of sauce. I also get 38: noodles with BBQ pork and Wonton. Comes with a small cup of broth. Noodles always excellent. Lunch specials a bit less expensive and very good shrimp fried rice!"}
{"text":"This is a fairly average place.  I'd suggest heading to the thai place a few doors down if you want something with a more authentic style and higher quality food.  This place doesn't let down, it's just not spectacular.  The price is right and the food is wholesome.  But I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here.    For a group of mixed eaters, this is actually a great place to go.  The food is somewhat bland at times, allowing those who don't like Asian food to appreciate it.  And it's good enough that those of us who love oriental food can appreciate it, as well.  I believe this is a good intermediary for those of us who'll go out and try and eat with people who aren't lovers of exotic food.  edit: sorry about saying \"Oriental.\"  I didn't realize that the phrase Oriental referred to nothing but Ramen noodles."}
{"text":"i placed a order online tonight night for the coconut chicken along with a few other things. I have never ordered food from here before, but i heard the food was great. after about a hour and a half we got our food cold at our home. witch i could look pass( they may have been busy or couldn't find our house) but when i got my food.( thinking i was was getting coconut chicken) it turned out to be mostly tofu with a little chicken. Now i don't have a problem with tofu at all. ha long bay has some great tofu dishes but the huge chunks tasted awful.  so i ended up throwing out most of my dinner just eating the rice and the few little chicken chunks in the dish.  good thing 90% of the dish is white rice otherwise i would have had nothing to eat. i don't think i will ever order the dish ever again. i may try something else next time with hopes it is better."}
{"text":"Come here for authentic canton-style noodle soup, since it's the best in Madison. I was transported back to times in Chicago's Chinatown and business trips in Hong Kong. These are American serving sizes, so if you're a smaller person you could probably order to split between two people, and get a second, drier dish to nibble on or pack for home.   I ordered the shiitake mushroom and chicken noodle soup (N5) and it was exactly what I wanted. Clear broth, veggies, and \"wonton noodle\" style noodles. The Thai iced tea was delicious with lemon instead of cream, it was like a southern-style sweet tea with an Asian twist.    The ambiance and service isn't as polished as other establishments in Madison, but what are you coming here for? They also have various imported beers sold by the bottle, and a list of specials almost every day of the week.   Then we got fortune cookies that spoke the truth, so, this place is magic."}
{"text":"General Tso's Chicken: Very, very fatty and soft. Chicken was pretty decent, just barely cooked but certainly not to the point that it would make you sick. Sauce was thin and runny. Like absurdly so. So it wasn't that familiar sauce-drenched slightly-chewy texture that you tend to expect with this dish, but other than that there wasn't really anything wrong with it.  Crab Rangoons: Lots of crispy wonton, not a lot of cream cheese. All around decent and unmemorable.  I probably would stick to the not-as-Americanized dishes the next time I order from here."}
{"text":"Ok... before I write my review. Uhhh... \"oriental\" food? Last time I checked, \"oriental\" is used to describe ramen flavoring or a type of rug. And since when is Chinese food considered \"exotic?\" Check your stereotypes before you write Mr. Thom Z. D*mn. Also, Suzie G, your observation about the socially awkward  waiters is soo on the ball. hahahahahaha.  All that being said. I love Wah Kee. Their noodle dishes just hit the spot and are among the 3 things I crave when sick (the other 2 being yukejang and pho). They actually make their own noodles here so really, it's the thing to order when you're here. Ohhh I should also mention that I don't typically like Americanized Chinese food b/c it's so greasy and heavy. But arg. Their noodle soup with a dollop of hot sauce. omg. I want some right now.  Their other dishes are pretty good too--one of my besties and I keep meaning to take a large group of people to Wah Kee so that we can order everything on the menu that sounds good. Except she's left me for SF and it just wouldn't be right to do it w/o her. haha. We'll do it someday though. Mark our words...  addendum: lol... thanks for the apology Mr. Thom Z. You also forget that there are oriental rugs in this world."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Chinese restaurants in Madison. We did not dine in but ordered take out from here on a Saturday night. We ordered:  Spring Rolls Scallion Pancakes Sticky rice wrapped in Lotus leaf Sweet and sour chicken Shrimp in Lobster sauce Ja Jang Mein Wonton & Gyoza Noodle Tong Mein  Every dish was delicious. Some of them take me back to my mother's homemade Chinese cooking. The scallion pancakes melted in your mouth. The sticky rice was full of flavor and I could have eaten 4 more orders of it. Even the sweet and sour chicken was good. The sauce was light and did not saturate the chicken. I was slightly disappointed in the shrimp in lobster sauce. There weren't many pieces of shrimp and it was mostly sauce.  The crown jewel for the night was the Ja Jang Mein. My mother makes this all the time still and these guys rivaled it (of course my mother's is better!) but this is about as close to homemade as you can get.  I highly recommend them!"}
{"text":"I've only had their noodle dishes so far, but I must say, I'm a fan.   First, all their noodles are homemade, and freshly cooked.  Second, they don't skimp out with their noodles. It's not the 30 cent ramen-quality noodles you'll find at most Asian places, it's actually authentic Asian noodles.  Third, given the price and quantity of food, you've got yourself a pretty good deal.   My only issue was that it was a bit oversaturated with sodium, but other than that, definitely a great meal."}
{"text":"I friend and I tried Wah Kee for lunch recently. There are two rooms with many tables. We had to step into the second room to find the waiter to seat us. They were not very crowded. The waiter was very friendly. They have an extensive menu.  After perusing their menu, I decided to try one of their lunch specials: Szechuan Spicy Pork. My thinking was there were so many items on the menu, I would try one of the lunch specials which they would be expecting to sell many of and make well. I was disappointed in the dish. It was very bland, covered in a brown sauce, and I didn't notice much if any spice. It did have lots of vegetables, zucchini, bamboo shoots, onion, mushrooms and came with a large portion of rice. For an appetizer I had the Sticky Rice in Lotus Leaf. This was much better although again it could have used more flavor. I did enjoy the dense chewy sticky texture of the rice and the chunks of chicken inside. My dining companion had the cashew chicken and said it was very good.  I would be willing to go back. I don't think I would try another lunch special, but would go for something else and hope it had more flavor."}
{"text":"Alright, I was torn on this place until I decided I really liked it.  I lived right up the street and I ate here all the time.  I tried the majority of their menu and have concluded that this is great feel-good soul fuel food.  The noodles are scrumptious, the dumplings are plump, the potstickers are delicious, and sauces are wholesome, and the Korean BBQ pork is really good.  You get a lot of food on your portion, and you can carryout.  That said, the noodles can be a bit heavy, and the dishes can get a bit greasy.  Still, it all tastes really good and while I can't speak to authenticity, it certainly warms a lonely evening."}
{"text":"I really wish I could give them more stars, because my side dishes were really good, but they messed up the two main dishes that my friend and I ordered. She got the sesame chicken, which was straight up sweet and sour chicken sprinkled with sesame seeds. It was okay, but definitely not sesame chicken. I ordered the Singapore Rice Noodles, but this dish was completely wrong. This dish is supposed to be made with very thin noodles, and instead, they used these very wide rice noodles. Further, they charge an additional $4 for substituting fried rice for white rice. I've never been to a place that does this, but $4 seems like an awful lot to charge extra for that.  Positives: Their char siu bao are delicious. Sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaves were amazing. Egg tarts were really good. I would be curious about their clay pot rice. They do delivery, which is nice.  I would go back, but with a little hesitation."}
{"text":"I had a bowl of wonton noodle and two spring rolls. The noodle and wontons are both great!. Especially the wontons have very thin skinner, in which tasty lean pork and big shrimp are wrapped. The spring rolls weren't good enough, but I still like to give this restaurant 5 stars. Definitely I'll go back. I used to go to hong kong wok (an OK place) for the same type of food before I discovered this. I think Wah Kee is way better in both taste and price."}
{"text":"4 stars for the wonton noodle soup.... 2 stars for everything else.  According to their menu, they are famous for their noodle factory. I have to say that their noodles really hit the spot. The wonton noodle soup comes with 6-7 shrimp+pork wontons (none with just shrimp), and lots and lots of noodles. I was definitely filled when I left, but it was so delicious that I didn't want to stop when I was starting to feel full. I liked it so much that I came back the next day.  Everything else on the menu (besides the noodle soups/dishes) were okay. One time we ordered bokchoy from the kitchen, and that was a little on the oily side. I ordered a szechuan eggplant dish, and I was disappointed to find that there were less than 10 pieces of eggplant, lots of other vegetables, no flavor, and way too much sugar. Definitely got Americanized.  I was also confused when one of the non-Chinese waitresses essentially demanded that we use the menu item #s and kept turning us back to look at the menu for the selection. When I go to a Chinese restaurant, I expect to be able to order right off the menu without having to go back and use numbers!"}
{"text":"Always a joy to eat the tong and lo mein dishes here. The egg noodles are the best, but so are the gyoza & wontons. The chili sauce is just the right amount of hot. Some times it's pretty dead in here, but lunch seems to be busier."}
{"text":"An excellent winter takeout spot. If it's a cold day or if I have a bit of a cold myself, I'm calling Wah Kee to get some of their soup.  I really like their Shitake and Chicken Noodle soup. Noodles are nicely al dente. Make sure you get some chili oil sauce (this is really spicy so be careful how much you put) to give the soup dishes a nice kick. On Sundays they serve congee too, which is also great for a cold day."}
{"text":"Today was a cold Wisconsin Sunday, and I decided I needed noodles and broth. We decided to try out Wah Kee, since neither of us had been there before.  Wow, this place has been here for 25 years. How had we not been here before?   We started off with a couple appetizers: the spring rolls, which were tasty, but I generally don't care for fried spring rolls, the kim chee, which was spicy and good, and the pork bun, which was huge. My husband's more of a pork bun aficionado than I, and he seemed to like it.  For our entrees, I got the Ginger, Scallion and Wonton Noodle Tong Mein, and it was just what I wanted: clean-tasting, ginger-spicy, with several good-sized shrimp and pork wontons. My husband got the Szechuan Dam Dam Noodles, which were spicy, but looked a little greasy to me. He seemed to like it, though. We both left thoroughly stuffed.  Oh, and I also fell desperately in love with guava juice. We will be back, for sure!"}
{"text":"Holy crap, some of the best Chinese food I've ever had. I love all of the regional dishes that you can't find in most Chinese restaurants. What Wah Kee serves is beyond American Chinese food--it's authentic, housemade Chinese food that is made well.  I had the daikon cakes (the chili oil was bombdotcom), siu mai, wonton noodle soup with ginger and scallion, and pork cake with salted egg. I loved all of it. I've been to many places in Chicago (I live there) that don't even compare. I kinda wished I lived in Madison so I could eat here often. ^_^"}
{"text":"Great place for Chinese noodle dishes. They  make their noodles fresh every day. Extensive menu includes interesting dishes from multiple regions in China. There are plenty of rice dishes as well.  My husband ALWAYS orders the bun ga, a pork noodle dish served in a bowl with a sauce on the side. It's probably his favorite meal in Madison and is one of the most popular on the menu.  Tonight I had the pan fried crispy noodles with seafood and veg on top. The sauce from the seafood and vegetables slowly migrates through the crunchy noodles, making for great texture. There were at least 5 species of seafood or shellfish plus a nice variety of vegetables. I really liked it and would order it again. As always, portions were large and I'm taking tomorrow's lunch home with me.  I also always drink their great ginger tea and enjoy the crab rangoon."}
{"text":"Located in the western end of Willy St, Wah Kee is the best Cantonese/Guangdong style Chinese food in Madison. If you regularly go to restaurants in North American Chinatowns, this place will bring back your memories!   Wah Kee's menu is huge and even includes some Thai/Vietnamese items, but the highlights are in its Cantonese selections. Anything in the Lo Mein section is pretty good. Wonton Lo Mein is my favorite. They made wontons fresh and they are among the best I had in this country.   They offer some really authentic appetizers. I recommend you to resist your urge to order spring rolls and try out \"fried turnip cake\", \"Yau Choi in Oyster Sauce\", \"Sticky Rice in Lotus Leaf\", \"BBQ pork buns\", or \"scallion pancake.\" It's pretty rare that you can find these dishes in the Midwest.   Rice in Clay Pot is also Wah Kee's specialty. Expect some preparing time but they worth the wait.   I wanted to give it 5 stars (as appeared in the very first version of the review) because it is such a bargain for budget foodies, but 4 stars probably will do justice to other Chinese eateries in town. Nonetheless, Wah Kee is one of the best meals you can get under $10 in the Madtown."}
{"text":"This place was a pleasant surprise. Has an insane amount of options, decent prices and portions. The woman who served us was fast and polite, would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I would definitely go here again if I was craving Asian food in Madison.  The beef and chasiu (pork) won ton noodle soup was delicious.  They do the meat really well.   The noodles on the other hand were just okay.  The egg noodles in the won ton soup tasted like they were from a package. The Curry Ho Fun noodles were a decent texture, but the curry sauce left something to be desired.   As a Chinese Restaurant in Madison: 4 stars If this restaurant was in SF Bay Area: 3 stars"}
{"text":"There wasn't even a sign board on the outside but I'm so glad I decided to give this place a try. I went for the first time around 9-ish on a weekday night and I was the only customer there. Ordered and got my noodles in less than 10 minutes. I ordered the Wonton, $7.95, and it came with noodles, soup, and Napa veges. Tasting the noodles and wonton instantly brought me back to memories of the wonton noodles I grew up eating. This is the first place in the Midwest where I've found the type of wontons made with the delicate thin skin. Each wonton had a shrimp and minced pork which tasted exactly how I remember wontons tasting. I've had so many other wontons in different Chinatowns across the US but have never found one that tastes like this!  The noodles and soup are great too. Ah, so pleased to have found this place!  Update: Went back the next night around 6.30pm with a friend. I tried the noodles (lo mien) with stewed pork hock and it was good. Unfortunately the service is slow as molasses. There were only about 3 other tables, but it took probably around 10 minutes to place our order and close to 30 min before we got our food. But the five stars stay because I really, really like the food and would go back again. Just maybe later at night, and take-out."}
{"text":"The first time I came across Wah Kee, I was browsing restaurants near Madison to try during our upcoming trip. In LA, there's a Wah Kee bakery that my fiancé loves egg tarts from and soon as we saw \"Wah Kee\", he goes, \"hey I love that place!\". I immediately figured he was pulling my leg and was talking about the bakery annnnd nope, he meant Wah Kee Noodle! Apparently he had come here many, many times as a kid.  After browsing some of the food photos, I was MEH at best because this just ain't my kind of place. However, as soon as I saw the braised pork hock noodles, I was SOLD.   And so, after traveling to Madison for the bigger part of that cold Saturday, we found ourselves at Wah Kee about an hour before closing. I had already spent the last half of our flight thinking about a delicious bowl of hot noodle soup, made better by soft, gooey, meaty pork hock and that was exactly what I got. I chose to have my noodles in soup and the broth was flavorful yet light enough to keep everything from becoming too rich. They also give you a little bowl of braising liquid to dip your meat in. It was a little too sweet for me and the noodle, pork, and broth combo was perfect as is.  He got his favorite, the Singapore rice noodles which came with little shrimp. He really enjoyed it though I preferred the big ol' pig leg by far.   We also ordered two appetizers: the spring rolls and a cha shao bao (BBQ pork bun). The spring rolls are just okay and they come out scorching hot. It came with a sweet and sour sauce that was a bit too watered down, and the filling was powdery meat and cabbage. We had high hopes for the cha shao bao and was let down when we discovered the filling was not your traditional cha shao but rather... sweet-ish pork and ONIONS? The onion taste really throws you for a loop.  One guy was all the wait staff they had that night and he was very friendly, and made sure to get us everything we needed. I'd definitely return for a quick and cheap bowl of hearty, soul-warming noodle soup."}
{"text":"4 stars is ONLY for their noodle soup dishes that I have tried which is their ginger, scallion, and pork noodles and also their BBQ pork with gyoza noodles. Their soup noodle dishes are really good! Love the house made noodles... broth was very rich and decadent.  The rest of my order is ALWAYS messed up. Several times I have paid extra for extra meat which I do not mind but I still don't get extra. Tip: Do NOT pay for extra anything here (you will get ripped off).   If you order anything from here, just order their soup noodle dishes... everything else is not worth it, complete rip off."}
{"text":"Most decent Cantonese food in Madison; however, still not good Cantonese food. They should really put more effort in the service because they can really have much more business. The rice pot dishes are worth the visit!"}
{"text":"Really delicious, really fast, reasonably priced, consistent, friendly, and efficient service.  This was probably the thirtieth or fortieth we've eaten there and we'll be back many more times."}
{"text":"I didn't enjoy my pork hock ramen. But my dinner companions seemed to enjoy their meals. My one complaint was the service was so very slow. We were one of the few people in the restaurant. Odd. Not sure I'll go back unless someone I know wants to try this restaurant."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat in Madison. The handmade noodles in broth (Tong Mein) are outstanding. The broth is delicious + complex, and the veggie subgum version is loaded with exotic treats (tofu skin, lotus root, ginkgo nuts) along with perfectly cooked tender-crisp vegetables. And the noodles are amazing -- I haven't had better in my travels in Asia. I've been eating at Wah Kee for 15 years and will keep going back every chance I get."}
{"text":"Delicious food at a very reasonable price, Wah Kee is the stalwart in my take-out world in Madison.  Their enormous menu hasn't let me down yet, and I'm working my way through it."}
{"text":"I really, really wanted to like this place. I have been searching for a great Chinese place in Madison and have turned up empty handed.   Having been to China and loving the food, I thought I would trust other reviewers that said the food was \"authentic\" and \"delicious\". We ordered--kimchee (actually the best thing), vegetable spring rolls (too much dough/rice paper and oddly spiced), yau choi in oyster sauce (pretty good, a bit bland, my bf was not a fan), vegetable tong mein (was supposed to come with gyoza, it did not, overpowering flavor of sesame oil, noodles were ok, not great), my boyfriend got a seafood dish that was absolutely terrible--the seafood was nowhere near fresh (there was a long piece of calamari with rubbery material that slapped back into his face when he took a bite, and the flavor was bland).  I guess it was against better judgement to order seafood here--or go here in general, as the dining room was completely empty during prime dinner hours on a Friday.   Our server was lamentable at best, she did not offer suggestions, and seemed hurried by her other responsibilities (and her boss was yelling to her from the kitchen) the entire time. It was if she had never been trained to serve--when I asked questions she would just shrug, and say \"are you ready?\"  I did really want to like this place, but sadly it was not meant to be. We took most of our food to go (as I hate wasting food), but ended up throwing it out for fear of encountering it again."}
{"text":"Excellent house made wontons in the soup. Also the pan-fried noodles with pork and vegetables was delicious."}
{"text":"Be very careful ordering here. Wonton noodles and dumplings are pretty good, but just about everything else is really sweet and corn starchy and under spiced and etc etc"}
{"text":"This was my first time coming here. We came around 3pm on a Saturday. We were immediately greeted by friendly waitstaff. Our waitress made many excellent recommendations and took her time to take us through the menu. Excellent service! Ambience is average, slightly dated, comfortable booths and standard tables.  For our entrees we got Singapore noodles and gyoza and wonton lo mein on our waitresses recommendation. They were so delicious! They also had chili oil on the table so we were able to make our food as spicy as we wanted. The dishes were unique and stood out well. I will definitely be back again to try more dishes!"}
{"text":"I had the vegetarian ma po tofu.  It was pretty good--not the best ma po tofu I've ever had, but the noodles were the best part.  I also had the vegetarian pot stickers.  As I've never met a veggie potsticker I didn't like, these were also good.  This wasn't my favorite restaurant in Madison, but it's a solid choice for Chinese food with lots of vegetarian options."}
{"text":"I heart Wah Kee Noodles! They have tasty food, great portions and their service is always quick. The ambiance is very casual but the food is amazing. Many of the noodles are fresh made and the flavors of their dishes are strong and authentic. I love their Singapore rice stick noodles and you cannot go wrong with any of their noodle soups (great for a cold Madison day)."}
{"text":"Maybe it was the spider web on the windowsill near my face, or maybe the fly who kept landing on the food, or maybe it was the dried plant parts surrounding the plant in the window, but the place seemed dirty. And that puts me off my food. If you are going to have real plants, then you have to clean up when they drop their leaves. This place is known for the homemade noodles and wontons and the chicken dumplings- fried - were good. The other 2 noodles dishes were boring. Beef and Scallions w/ Fun noodles (wide rice ones) and Pork and Spinach w/ homemead wheat noods. Yes the noods seemed fresh but the sauces were undistinguished and goopy. Maybe I will go back and try the soup in the winter time. Maybe."}
{"text":"Holy duck noodles.  Seriously. Wow. The soup base is awesome! The noodles are wonderfully delicious, and there was literally half a duck in there. I've had other noodles here, and they are good. But they've got nothing on the duck noodles. I am salivating while writing this.  Other things worth trying: -Daikon carrot cake with their homemade chili sauce (like Ellie said, it means business, but yummm) -Sau ma (I never know how to spell it.)  It's not the most alluring of places, both from the inside and out. But hey, I'm not going for the atmosphere. THOSE NOODLES. I wish I could read Chinese, because it seems like there are some special Chinese dishes that I don't know about."}
{"text":"We ordered black pepper beef and garlic spinach and the sauce with the beef was fantastic, as was the spinach. The beef was thin cut bone-in, and tough. The low quality, fatty beef really ruined all the parts that were good about the meal.   Wah Kee makes their noodles in house, and that deserves some attention. We've had their beehoon noodle dish that was very simple and tasty. Beehoon noodles are very thin rice noodles that are stir fried with varying ingredients and can be served dry or wet (saucy, or thinly coated without any sauce pooled underneath).   I think Wah kee's house made noodles are a huge draw and should be focused on when choosing from the menu."}
{"text":"The vegetable subgum is great.  I love that they aren't overly concerned with American palettes not enjoying certain Chinese vegetables and going for authenticity instead.  The noodles are tasty.  The gyoza are really great.  I even like the eggrolls there, and normally I hate eggrolls.  They also have a variety of southeast Asian dishes; that just confuses me.  It's really reasonably priced.  I almost always get noodle soup for $7 and get two hearty meals out of it.    The atmosphere is the atmosphere of most good Chinese restaurants...total shit, but that isn't why you go here.  Also, don't expect amazing service.  Most of the servers are kind of awkward and seem to not really know what they're supposed to be doing.  Best Chinese in Madison hands down."}
{"text":"I work for a Christian campus ministry, and my organization often brings me to Madison. While in town, I often crave some East Asian food, and Wah Kee hit the spot. A friend and I enjoyed both the charsiu-wonton noodle soup and the beef-chive-gyoza soup. I agree with Wendy H that for Madison, this restaurant is 4 stars, but if it were in the Bay Area, it'd get 3 stars."}
{"text":"I ordered the wonton noodle soup which was decent, but above average for what I would expect outside an area with a large Asian population. I also ordered the luo mei gai, but would not recommend that, as it did not seem particularly fresh.  Service was prompt and the food came out relatively quickly. Their menu seemed to be too expansive and their food may be better if they focused on select dishes."}
{"text":"Wah Kee is one of those places that I am always happy to eat at, but seem to never go to.  I don't know why, because the noodles are delish, and they have Thai iced tea."}
{"text":"I've been here twice. You have to try their wonton noodles, its the best in Madison! I heard their noodles are hand made instead of store brought. That's definately a plus! It really tastes like Hong Kong style noodles. Besides noodles, they have a wide range of selection on the menu and their prices are reasonable. I ordered wonton noodles on both of my visits. I can say they didn't disappoint me.   However, the service was not up to par. The waitresses just came to our table twice the whole time while we were there, once to take the order, and the other time to give us the check.   I would definately go back because their wonton noodles are so tasty! I would recommend their noodles to anyone who would like to try some real Chinese food."}
{"text":"I called for delivery at 6 and finally got my food at 7:40. The woman originally quoted me 20 minutes, and after 30 I realized that I hadn't given her my address, so I called back with that. So, a little bit of a misunderstanding, that's fine. But an hour and 10 minutes after that getting cold delivery is not cool.  I ordered off of the daily specials section of the menu for a discounted price. I found out that the daily special is only a lunch special. It doesn't say that on the menu. But ok, that's fine.  So when we get the cold food the potstickers are gummy and the general tso's is cold and limp with weird sauce.   I will admit that the spicy garlic beef was ok. It might have been good even, if it had been hot."}
{"text":"If you haven't been to Wah Kee, this restaurant needs to be next on your dining experience list. In a sea of pre-fab noodle places, Wah Kee continues to create all dishes from scratch, all noodles from scratch, and all of the  food is fresh and prepared masterfully by seasoned chefs. This dining spot has been around for years  and is family owned and operated. It is not glitzy like some of the national chains- but if you are interested in very good, authentic food at a very reasonable price, skip the bagged noodle places and try Wah Kee."}
{"text":"I came here with some friends to catch up and to eat some wonton noodle soup. I ordered the BBQ pork wonton noodles. First of all, I thought the food itself was alright. I felt like the presentation was a bit lacking since everything was pretty colorless, but at least the meat tasted good. The noodles were sad and pale.   Other aspects I didn't really like so much. When we sat down, the table smelled kind of like dirty dishrags, and my napkin had an old piece of food stuck on it. I really hate to say this, but service was also subpar. Our waitress was NOT friendly at all. Also, we were pretty much ignored after our food was brought out, even though we were in clear view of the main counter where both servers were stationed. Eventually my friend had to physically get up and go to the front counter to ask for more napkins. The waitress also made a big stink about us wanting to split the check for a group of 4, so that was annoying.   So yeah, overall it was an okay experience. Would I come here again? Probably not."}
{"text":"Wah kee is the cure for the common cold.  Tried and true tested on the weekend of February 2nd, 2008.  Believe it."}
{"text":"I must say, after reading other reviews, I was rather disappointed.  The service was kind, but slow.  The spring rolls we had were indicative of a delicious meal to come...but frankly it just fell short.  I had lo mein with beef and wontons and it was alright, but nothing really spectacular.  It actually reminded me a lot of an inexpensive frozen meal.  My husband's noodle bowl was much the same.  Additionally, both of our meals tasted overtly of shrimp...and we both ordered beef items.  Our daughter, however, ordered pork fried rice and it was DELIGHTFUL.    The price was low, so it is silly to get overly disappointed with the meal.  However, it is not somewhere that I would likely return if given the opportunity."}
{"text":"Wah Kee is one of several places I wish I had spent more time at in Madison. The menu is very extensive, and it has both many Chinese dishes that are familiar in American-Chinese restaurants, as well as several specialty noodle dishes. Not all of the descriptions are adequate; I ordered one Singapore Noodle dish that had eggs in it, the fact of which was not mentioned in the menu description (it was otherwise a very good item, though). So you may want to ask the staff about the items if you have questions (they are very helpful). Overall, I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I ordered off of CampusFood because I needed to finish a paper before midnight and just did not want to cook.  Oh god, Wah Kee was the best decision I made on that note in such a long time I wish I could kick myself in the head for not doing it faster.  If you order from CampusFood, it's one of the cheapest out there for order requirement-wise and it is ohmygawdsogood. I got the BBQ beef on white rice and it was phenomenal."}
{"text":"Great hole in the wall place! Free parking in the area is a plus. I don't know if I would go here for some of the other asian dishes that are boasted (didn't try them), but stuck to the handmade noodles - the Chinese items on the menu. Tried the special beef noodle soup as well as a dumpling/wonton with egg noodle soup. Of note, the dumplings and wontons either looked exactly alike or I didn't get one of them (it was filled with shrimp and minced pork though, which was pretty tasty). They were simple, but satisfying for a cold snowy day and the price point was extremely reasonable.   Just a note, that this is more of a hole-in-the wall authentic place so it would not be where to go to get that greasy lo-mein that you just sometimes crave. Again, for way under $10 an entree for the noodle soups, this is an excellent place. I've seen/heard lots about the pork hock so maybe check that out if you have the chance."}
{"text":"This place was aweful!  The delivery was fast but the food was aweful.  I took 1 bite and it all went in the garbage!"}
{"text":"I woke up craving Chinese noodle soup and, trusting these reviews, went in. It was the absolute worst noodle soup I've ever had. The broth was thin, tasteless and tasted old. The pork was dry and gray. And the noodles weren't even fully cooked. Wontons were filled with... Who knows?  Part shrimp/part some random meat. I would highly suggest you don't go in."}
{"text":"This place is awesome, go here and get anything noodle-y.  Legit authentic Chinese food and good service."}
{"text":"The noodle soup is so awesome that I had to go back three times in a row!!  Hope I can find some places like this in Los Angeles."}
{"text":"This is a decent place on the east side of town. They hand make all their noodles which I thought was a nice touch. I have only tried the noodle dishes here so I can only speak to that. Their house special beef noodle soup was decent. I wish it had a little more flavor but still good! Their dumpling noodle soup was also pretty good. If you're in the mood for some authentic Chinese dumplings, look no further!  I'll definitely be coming back to try some of their other dishes."}
{"text":"My favorite Asian restaurant in Madison. Skip all of the usual, American-y Chinese restaurant options and go for the noodle dishes. There is a great selection of vegetarian dishes and a good and inexpensive lunch menu. I love the buddha's delight. Like, I really, really love it.   The only bad thing about this place is its super weird staff. I don't know how they consistently find the most bizarre and socially awkward people to wait tables there. Doesn't change my 5 star rating though - it's just part of the Wah Kee experience."}
{"text":"Ordered food here and was happy to see that they were open early as a lot of the other places in the area seemed to open much later.  I called and was put on hold for about five minutes so I hung up. I got a call back to place the order but I should have stayed away.  I ultimately ordered the spring roll and the spicy chicken fried rice.  I got spring rolls and regular fried rice. This was a big problem because the regular fried rice looks like it was boiled in chicken broth with a few veggies tossed in it.  It would have been salvageable if I got some chili packets but that wasn't the case.    I called and went over my situation with the the person that answered and was told that she couldn't do anything because her driver wasn't there and neither was the manager. I didn't see why this was a problem and suggested that she place a new order and have the driver deliver it when he gets back. That made a lot of sense to me but made no sense to the person that answered for some reason.    This was a bad experience all around.  This was my first time here and it will definitely be my last."}
{"text":"Blech. I'm half writing this as a note to myself to stop trying to eat here.  So, the noodles are clearly fresh, and it's a conceptual step up from the Americanized type Chinese one finds many other places here, and something different if you're not up for the heat level of Szechuan. But uh if you don't like fish? Skip this place. The first few times I thought maybe I made an ordering error, but there is no reason for BBQ Pork Lo Mein to taste and smell aggressively fishy. Both the broth (maybe there's some shrimp involved) and the noodles (which is far stranger). It's disconcerting and offputting. Maybe that's nitpicky of me, and maybe someone who ate fish wouldn't notice. But for me? GLECH. Their house-made hot sauce is awesome and conceals the worst of it, but I shouldn't -need- to conceal unwanted flavors like that.  So basically, Must Love Fish if you're gonna get the noodle dishes here. 4 stars in that case. If you want your pork to just be pork, then see rating above."}
{"text":"There lo-mien is my favorite in madison. This place is my number one take out place. If you are into authentic Asian food, you need to try this place. Also if you like spice then you have to try there hot chili oil."}
{"text":"Either I went on an off night, or not a lot of people know about Wah Kee Noodle. There was only one waiter working, and he was also the host. We ordered N1 and N13 off the house specials page (can't remember the name of N1, but N13 was some kind of spicy vegetable noodle dish). N1 was tasty (wide ride noodles stir fried with beef and bean sprouts) and I would definitely order it again. N13 had a sweet but not spicy sauce, as well as plenty of broccoli, celery, carrots and bean sprouts. Wah Kee says on their menu that they make their own noodles, and it definitely tastes like it. I would recommend ordering off of their house specials page if you have trouble deciding what to get from their 4-5 page menu."}
{"text":"That general tsos chicken so good, makes me go WAHKEEWAHKEEWAHHHHHH. Also ask for the housemade hot sauce, your lower intestine will thank you later."}
{"text":"OMG, this place made me ask my best friend to drive me here because their noodle soup were great and living in Madison where it's cold most of the time, eating hot soup is always a good choice. This place is not located in the very open street, you have to know the area. It's kinda hidden by the railroad and the street is kinda weird, but boy the Wonton Noodle soup, it's yummy... I think even the rice dishes are as good as their noodle dishes... but I'm a noodle girl, never eat rice at noodle place. Totally recommend this place if someone comes for a visit out of town, especially during winter :) eating warm soupy dishes... woahh...."}
{"text":"I went back and had what they are best known for which is their Pho. In particular, I order the beef and ginger pho.   The broth was very flavorful and had the perfect amount of ginger.  I added extra noodle to mine. Be warned, extra really mean extra! Tons of noodles. Had a hard time finishing my soup because the portion sizes are very amazing for such a great price. The substance of the beef was a bit \"chewy\". It's hard to explain. I think I would have enjoyed the soup better without any meat at all.   Service is OK but there is room for improvement. During the last visit, I paid with Visa, however, due to the internet and a few fax orders coming in during the same time I was about to pay, my BF and I ended up waiting a good 5 minutes for the machine to clear. It wasn't a big issue as we weren't in any big rush, but do be warned that this may cause you a delay in the future. Server apologized but it wasn't her fault.   That being said, Wah Kee is a place to go on a cold day when you want some good soup."}
{"text":"The best Chinese restaurant in Madison, and one of the only Chinese restaurants I have ever visited where almost everything on the menu is made well, which is surprising considering how extensive it is. The curry dishes are not that great though.   Of particular goodness: Bun-ga, which is not on the menu but is a special that has been on the specials board for months; their wonton noodle soups, the broth for which is wonderful; the decadent stewed pig hock noodles; taro and pork belly."}
{"text":"I thought I'd try Wah Kee based on the reviews.  Big mistake.  Maybe delivery is the wroing way to go.  I wanted to go safe with a new choice for Chinese.  Pot Stickers and Pad Thai noodles.  The pot stickers were just a big ball of dough with some filling. Absolutely the worst example of a pot sticker I've ever had.  The Pad Thai noodles were completly dry, completely void of sauce.  I put every packet of soy sauce, hot sauce, and pot sticker sauce they geve me, just to try and gag it down.  No luck."}
{"text":"Best tong mein soup around!  I recommend the bbq pork tong mein."}
{"text":"The steam egg with pork is my favorite. Wah Kee's style is pretty authentic. Cantonese food is lovely and tasty."}
{"text":"Yes yes, I agree with the 4 and 5 stars here.  Do you ever feel like eating Chinese that doesn't clog your arteries? Welcome to Wah Kee. You cannot order dish like the \"premium\" tofu with mushroom and greens that my fiance ordered anywhere else. I can't figure out how they cook the silky tofu to the perfection. Sure, the decor is \"whatever,\" but I was delighted/enchanted/whatever you want to call it  with the food.   The serving portion is large. And this is a plus, if you like eating the left over that still taste great!!! I just satisfied my after-bar hour cravings and said, \"damn.\""}
{"text":"I have been to this place many many times and I have never had bad food. My only suggestion for them would be that the servers could be friendlier. Wah Kee is far from my house so I do not get to visit often but when I do it is always a treat!"}
{"text":"Always excellent food, atmosphere could use an update.  Service tends to be slow and the waitresses can be very moody at times.  It seems that service and ambience are not a priority."}
{"text":"Love these noodles! Probably one of the best noodle places in town."}
{"text":"I didn't have high expectations as I'm in NYC often and they have the best Thai and Chinese food. But this place was impressive for a small City like Madison. I loved the won ton Soup, the Mongolian beef and the sweet and sour  chicken! Will definitely be back. Oh and the pork fried   rice was soooo good!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Asian restaurants in Madison.  Excellent noodle dishes, nothing like most Madison \"Chinese\" restaurants.  I often notice staff from other Asian restaurants eating at Wah Kee, which I think says something about the authenticity of the meals.  Atmosphere is a bit bland but clean.  I think the staff and owner are great, not sure what the whining is about below.  I have taken dozens of people to eat at Wah Kee and it always gets rave reviews.  The only complaint I ever get is that the menu has too many dishes.  Excellent."}
{"text":"The menu is overwhelmingly long and their food is pretty tasty.  There are options for vegans, vegetarians, and any other dietary restriction you can think of. I wouldn't protest another visit."}
{"text":"Wah Kee has been my favorite restaurant in Madison for many years. I usually opt for the simple, authentic noodle dishes, but I am also quite pleased whenever I explore the other offerings."}
{"text":"This is where we go for comfort food. As you have probably figured out, noodles are the specialty. The owner is a friendly fellow, and he clearly wants you to have a good experience. I also love his house Kimchee (nom nom). On weekends it's one of the few place I know of where you can get a steeping bowl of congee (a rice porridge) and the sides that go along with it (Yo tiao, a fried bread in the shape of a stick). The yo tiao wrapped in crepes is positively addictive."}
{"text":"Wah Kee has the best wonton I've had in Madison. The milk tea is also super good - not very sweet, so be sure to ask for extra sugar unless you're like me and don't have a sweet tooth."}
{"text":"This place is a gem. If you are looking for some good noodles in clear broth you came to the right place.  I always order the Pho Ga because it has just enough chicken flavor and it is not overwhelming. The cilantro basil and lime add just the right kick. The pork bun is steamed to order and never disappoints. I love this place."}
{"text":"This place is down the street from me and it's kind of addictive.  I really like the assorted Tong Mein (noodle soups).  They come with various combinations of beef, pork, ginger, scallions, and two kinds of dumplings (wonton or gyoza), a big pile of stringy noodles (think Chinese angel hair pasta), and broth.  One soup with an appetizer or two can feed a couple people, but we've been known to order one soup per person in response to strong Wah Kee cravings.  The menu is huge, but I've not strayed from the Tong Mein much at all.  It's dang good.  Not sure if I would order for regular junk Chinese food, but definitely worth it for the soup."}
{"text":"Too bad... I was really disappointed that the beef in the \"Korean BBQ beef over fried rice\" dish was extremely tough--so much so that I had to ask for a steak knife. It consisted of two thin strips of flank steak that had not been properly marinated or tenderized. The \"Korean\" component of the dish was an underwhelming BBQ sauce that was more sweet than spice.   The only server this Thursday night was who I presume to be the owner and he was greatly outnumbered by the 10 tables of patrons who like me, had to patiently wait to be seated, for water, soda refills and even to pay the bill at register.   A suggestion would be to cut down on the menu items (which I estimate to be at 120) and focus on 30 solid dishes worth coming back for. Another would be to remove the \"Korean\" characteristic from their dishes because it's kinda like calling Chipotle \"Mexican food.\""}
{"text":"Another one of the places I desperately miss from Madison.  After a year and a half in Madison, I'd still only worked my way through about half the menu.  Everything is good, though my favorite would have to be the ma po tofu.  Some of my favorite memories of Madison are sitting in a booth on a cold Wisconsin night with a bowl of ma po, a plate of fried dumplings, a pot of tea, and a book, a friend, or a girl."}
{"text":"Still good, and I haven't made it through the menu yet (it's taking years...). Service is hit or miss, and it is like HIT and MISS, hard. Two words of advice: ask for wooden chopsticks- noodles are easy to lose down one's shirt... :P. The wood has more traction, I think. Disregard this last thing if you are a plastic chopstick master. Also, try to get the room without the TV- last time I ate there I got to watch a show called 'Hillbilly Handfishin' while I ate. Wow. It was pretty gross. Really gross, actually. Why is there even a TV on anyway? So distracting... :/   Noodles... they need lots of attention.   Oh yeah- ask for hot chili oil, they haz it!"}
{"text":"My order: Pad Thai with Chicken, crab rangoon, and pot stickers. All were awful! The pad thai was NOT pad thai. It was a mess of broken noodles, a couple bean sprouts, and some boiled chicken. It had no flavor - none of that great sweet/sour/spicy that I love about pad thai. It couldn't be rescued either with the ingredients I had at home.  The crab rangoon was flavorless cream cheese in a thick wonton wrapper. I took a couple bites and threw it out. The sweet and sour sauce came in packets.  The pot stickers were wrapped in THICK wrappers which made them gummy and unappetizing. The dipping sauce was plain soy sauce in a cup.  Worst dinner ever. I'll never order from here again."}
{"text":"Wah Kee has some authentic asian food, having travelled to many Asian countries myself. Their lo mein (or wonton noodles) are worth a try and they taste even better with hot chili oil! I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 because there are some inconsistencies."}
{"text":"The food was less then average. I was really looking forward to some bubble tea, but it is no longer offered, yet it is still on the menu. Grrr. The hours are weird- the staff unfriendly. This is not a place I'd try again!"}
{"text":"I went here looking for a casual dinner and was intrigued by their homemade noodles. I found the menu to be a bit long and overwhelming, so I asked our server to recommend a good vegetarian dish that included noodles and fresh veggies. She recommended the lo mein noodles. When they arrived, they were in a gooey white sauce that looked terribly unappetizing. I kept an open mind and tried it since it had been recommended to me. The consistency of the sauce was terrible and the veggies were mushy and overcooked. My dinner companion ordered the Kung Pao tofu, which looked far more appetizing and had lots of fresh, crisp veggies. I was lucky enough that he was willing to share his dish with me, because we both found mine to be completely inedible. It was a huge shame, since I was really hoping to have delicious noodles that night. Will definitely not be coming back here!"}
{"text":"Not sure where all of the positive reviews were coming from for this place, would give them zero or negative stars if I could.  Ordered pickup through grubhub, got pot stickers, Cantonese Seafood Pan-Fried noodles, Chicken and chinese sausage in a clay pot, Baby Bok Choy, and Roasted Duck on rice.  Total was over $50.  Grubhub text messaged me on the way to the place multiple times telling me that the order was ready, but I ended up waiting about 15-20 min for my order when I got there.  There was a guy hunched over the phone scribbling orders including credit card numbers old-school style, making me wonder about ordering directly from them.  Most chinese takeout I've ever had has been packaged where the dish + sauce is in one container, and the rice is separate.  Both the clay pot dish and roasted duck were about three quarters rice.  They still threw in a container of rice for reasons we're still trying to piece together.  Extra for caulking our roof?    I guess the most disappointing dish was the roasted duck, as they used the back of the bird;  it was all bones and cartilige.  The one decent dish was the baby bok choy, the rest we pretty much threw away all the extra rice and ended up hungry.  We called the next day and talked to \"Lee\" who said the owner wouldn't be in for a couple of days, and that they didn't care what we thought of the food.  Needless to say, we will not be going back, and we will not be recommending this to anyone we know.  Total ripoff, you'd be better off buying a bag of rice and top ramen.  I'd say I got about $10 worth of food, and that's being generous."}
{"text":"I had the BBQ pork and wonton noodle for delivery. It's really awesome. Growing up in Asia, I had high expectation of noodle soup, and the broth exceed my expectation! I love it. The delivery guy was very nice too. Warning: the pork and the broth are salty, but I love salty"}
{"text":"This is the place I go whenever I'm homesick for some authentic Chinese food. I love their homemade rice noodles and that's what I order all the time. Yesterday I went there with my friend from Michigan who asked me to take her to the noodle shop. The food was great as usual and the waitress was friendly and attentive. Always an enjoyable experience!"}
{"text":"I really loved this place!   Service: speedy, friendly and able to answer questions Price: accepts credit cards! Very reasonable Portion: very generous Parking: amazingly, has a small parking lot on the edge of downtown Food: so good. Their noodle dishes were so flavorful, the right amount of chewy and all house made! They have this noodle machine imported from China that makes the yummiest quality noodles that I, as a noodle connoisseur find faultless.   This might not be the fanciest place, but rarely do I crave a certain restaurant when I move. I crave these noodles!"}
{"text":"I get excited by new items every time I come here! Wah Kee is very good at adding flavors to the dishes but without making it too spicy or salty.  My personal favorites now include clay pots, five-spice beef, appetizers. Need to explore more the next time I come here, and also try the noodles.  Update: do NOT come during weekend nights... I think they only have one person taking care of everything. We went there and say for 30min and still no water. Waited for the meal for about an hour. Food still good though."}
{"text":"This place is a little inconsistent in my opinion, but usually they are very good. This last time, we ordered the fried tofu appetizer which was absolutely delicious. The tofu was the perfect consistency, the coating was a little salty but otherwise the perfect crispness and flavor, and the dipping sauce pulled it all together. My husband ordered curried beef tripe or something similar which was ok. The curry was delicious, but there wasn't much meat and the taro that they had filled the plate up with instead might not have been cooked quite enough. My main dish was tofu and mushrooms. I loved the tofu, but the sauce on the dish was too sweet, so I didn't really appreciate the rest. We also ordered the egg custard tarts because those are always cooked fresh. This time they were a bit burnt, overall pretty good. I love the flaky crust. When these come out, though, they are too hot to eat, and you have to be sure to let them sit for five minutes. Worth visiting this restaurant if you're already in the area for sure. Plus, service is pretty fast so we sometimes squeeze in a meal here before some other activity in the area."}
{"text":"I love the wide variety of food that's always prepared (and delivered) quickly.  They use high quality ingredients and their menu expands beyond the average.  Their customer service is fantastic.  Over the years, they have become my go-to delivery choice."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since I was a little kid and the food is consistently delicious. The service can be a bit weird but they totally make up for it with the food. They have the best homemade noodles in town. Try the hot and sour noodle, the bbq beef fried rice, and the crab rangoon. Amazing. Also, they deliver. This is some of the best quality delivery chinese food in Madison."}
{"text":"This is a classic hole-in-the-wall restaurant. Service is only so-so and kinda slow. But if you're looking for avoid Chinese/Asian mix restaurant with an extensive menu and cheap prices, this is the place for you. I had the Ginger, scallion, wonton noodle soup and it was fantastic. The wontons were filled with shrimp and pork and spices. The noodles (which are homemade) were perfectly good in a wonderful broth. I also had the potstickers which were filled with amazingly fresh ingredients, very tasty!"}
{"text":"So. Good.  First time ordering Wah Kee take out tonight, and because the menu is so huge I just picked like five random items and to my delight, everything was delicious!!  My favorite by far was the ginger scallion gyoza and wonton lo mein.. delicious house made dumplings, house made noodles (I think?) with a fragrant broth and crisp fresh scallion and cabbage.  Delivery took over an hour, but it was well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"it was too bad that my experience eating here was a bad one. It left a very bad taste in my mouth that made me reluctant to go back.  I had some fried noodle and some drink made from tapioca which I couldn't recall the names and both were not good. My dining companion had a plate of seafood noodle and it smelled so fishy. Not to mention, cuts of the seafood were way too big.  Sorry but I couldn't give more than one star for this place. It was just a poor meal experience."}
{"text":"Usually, I'm a pretty standard sweet & sour pork with rice type of guy.  However, at Wah Kee. I was advised to try the noodle dishes by a regular and was not disappointed.    Fresh tasting with plenty of flavor, it was a pretty scrumptious meal.  The dining room itself could be more intimate and our server a tad friendly but the food made up for it all."}
{"text":"Loved it!  The food was authentic and the owners talked to my mom at length in Cantonese.  We ordered wonton soup, Gui lan (Chinese broccoli), veggie lo mein, Char Sui pork, and chicken and shrimp chow fun."}
{"text":"Great homemade noodles. Below average thai green curry. Average tofu. No air conditioning even on 80+ degree humid day."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery. Got here faster than they said it would. 1 - Bbq pork bun - ok. 1- Scallion pancake - ok. 1 - Pad Thai - not good. $30.00. Won't order from here again."}
