{"text":"Well, this is just average breakfast with worse than average service. Seating was a nightmare even with open tables all over. The buzzer went on and off accidentally, extending our wait. Greeted and seated without a kid's menu for our 7 year old.   Every other breakfast spot around will substitute (even for a nominal charge) the carbs on the side for a couple slices of bacon or anything for low carb eaters. They wanted to charge 5.99$ for a sausage patty ON THE SIDE. Oh, and the sides aren't listed on the menu, the price is \"in the computer\". Outrageous. I was happy to see a new, albeit also overpriced, breakfast spot in our neighborhood but I guess I'll stick to the established spots that actually offer some service and a choice. Boring coffee, too. Nothing too glorious at this \"Glorified\" egg joint. Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Was in Las Vegas for five days and hopped on Yelp for breakfast restaurants. To my surprise , a Peg's Glorified Ham and Eggs showed up on South Eastern Ave. We have eaten at their Northern NV locations in Reno, Sparks and Carson City many times. I ordered their half ham steak, eggs, hash browns and toast. As usual, very good . OJ is truly freshly squeezed.If in Vegas, and do not want casino food, then head on over to Pegs! Bp"}
{"text":"Loved the first breakfast last week and have been back twice more to try additional breakfast entrees.  The Belgian waffle was outstanding and the chili relleno and eggs were super delicious.  The service, quality of food, and ambiance is very consistent.  I am anxious to try the lunch menu soon.  The best breakfast restaurant I have been to since moving here 7 years ago.  The décor is super awesome, along with the friendly service from Gabriela I felt like I was back home in downtown Chicago.  This place is clean with a friendly staff.  Breakfast and Lunch served all day.  Everything is fresh and delicious. Finally found a place that can make hash browns the right way. Biscuits and gravy were outstanding.  I plan on going back often"}
{"text":"The food was wonderful, large portions and well cooked. The staff is very attentive and we felt they cared whether or not we liked what we were eating. Coffee was good, Ice tea was good and even the freshly squeezed orange juice with pulp was good. We took a chance on this place and I am happy to say it paid off. Your turn."}
{"text":"Decided to try a new place for breakfast. Wifey had chicken breast, eggs and hash browns. I had chicken fried steak, hash browns, grits, eggs, biscuits and gravy. Great big portions! Love the waitress (Ariane) we had, always checking, filling coffee, etc. Love this place better than Black Bear, we will be back!!"}
{"text":"I just ate the most delicious breakfast ever! Seriously..... 5 stars aren't enough. I had the special chili verde omelet. Everything was so tasty and fresh. Service was fantastic. This family knows how to do breakfast right."}
{"text":"this is the best breakfast place in town! it's new, but that does definitely not take away from it. service is super fast, and when you walk in you already feel at home. everyone has personality, and by the end of your meal, you'll feel like family. i got the monte cristo, and it was excellent! i recommend this place, please check it out if you're around the area or in Vegas for a little."}
{"text":"Yum! Everything my table order was delicious. Peg's a big step above your average breakfast/brunch joint. My table ordered the pumpkin bread French toast, pancakes and the tamale. We'd all make the trip back for these and other delightful things we didn't get to try."}
{"text":"Ate here yesterday since I heard so much hype from my Reno friends. I ordered the eggs Benedict and was very satisfied with the taste and portion. All the staff was friendly and our waitress Misty always had our drinks topped off. Definitely worth a try if you are in the area or in the mood for big breakfast."}
{"text":"It was great to find a vegan breakfast option on this menu. Overall, the food looked glorious!"}
{"text":"The food here was awesome. The service was great. They allowed us to call 30 minutes ahead to put our name on the list. The Mexican-inspired breakfast I had was delicious. Only thing was the beans were still pretty crunchy. Not worth marking down a star."}
{"text":"After reading all awesome reviews we decided to check it out!   It's a little diner and there can be a bit of a wait.   I decided to get the corned beef  hash and my bf has the monster cristo.   Corned beef has was really good, it had green peppers as well. He said the Monte cristo was ok. Huge portions!   The staff was really nice! Will def come back   It's a nice little neighborhood breakfast/lunch spot."}
{"text":"Visited for the first time a few weeks ago with a friend for brunch on a Sunday. Place was pretty busy, we had to wait maybe 10 minutes for a table. VERY generous portions. I ended up taking some of it home. I got the chili and rice dish, one of their original Hawaiian dishes. I got the scrambled eggs with this and it came with a side of the macaroni salad. Everything tasted great, and my glass of fresh squeezed OJ was delicious as well and quite refreshing. Only downside was the service that was spotty at times. Once we were seated and orders taken it was about another 15 minutes before our food came out. My friend did get her coffee cup filled on numerous occasions, though.  This is a welcome addition to the neighborhood. They are open until 2:00 so   I'll have to come back and experience lunch sometime."}
{"text":"Welcome to fabulous Las Vegas, Peg's!!!!  You can imagine how excited lovers of this Reno breakfast joint are now that Peg's opened in Las Vegas. This is probably their most decorative restaurant. I love the blue accents on the gray wood. Their staff is super friendly and some of them actually moved to Vegas to open and work at this restaurant.  Eating my breakfast in a pan is so satisfying for some reason. I am simple and I love to eat Bacon & Eggs. I wanted soft scrambled eggs, but they gave me regular scrambled eggs. I hope they learn how to make my egg right next time. Their Biscuits & Gravy is absolutely delicious and I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food and service! Joy was our server when we came in. She was awesome! She knew the menu, greeted us with a smile and made sure our drinks stayed full. Food homemade and fresh and quick to come to table. Portions large. I have never eatten here before, but I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"It was my first time trying out this place. The big plus was that they let me make a reservation, allowing us to bypass the busy Sunday crowd. I wanted to try something different for breakfast and had the spam and rice, omitting the eggs since I don't like them. I found it unusual for them to have this since it wasn't a Hawaiian type of restaurant, but I'm glad since I wanted something different. It tasted good but not anything special from what I've had before. I also got a half order of biscuit and gravy. I make it a point to try biscuit and gravy wherever I eat breakfast, hoping to find a delicious one like I've had in the past. It was just OK, and I wish it had more flavor. I did like the place, and the service was good."}
{"text":"Great addition to breakfast in Henderson.  I had the huevos rancheros which was served in a large skillet pan with beans, hash browns and slaw. It was excellent. My friend had a sausage omelette which was also excellent. Service was terrific and atmosphere was relaxed and enjoyable. Highly recommend Peg's for a wonderful breakfast or lunch. Now I hope that would open a location up north in the Aliante area."}
{"text":"Yay! Went here for Mother's day brunch. Restaurant was full but wait was not ridicoualy long. Service was quick and  attentive despite the business.  We got several dishes, all of them were great. Heuvos rancheros classic great balance of flavors. Salmon Benedict nicely done with fresh salmon. The Monte Cristo a hearty slightly salty sandwhich.  Definitely would consider coming back"}
{"text":"I was excited to check this place because of the great reviews. It was ok, but not as good as anticipated. The corned beef hash was lacking corned beef and the tamale wasn't that great."}
{"text":"Breakfast was great! I had pumpkin pancakes which were amazing and a side of biscuits and gravy which was good. Our waitress wasn't very friendly and when our food was brought out without toast or biscuits and gravy she seemed annoyed I called her over to ask about them. That is my only complaint. I think you should at least let me know if the food isn't all coming out at the same time. The inside is very roomy and the booths are nice. I will definitely be back, but hoping we have friendlier service."}
{"text":"First time here. Full house, stayed busy the whole time we were there. Can't pass up a Monte Cristo! Was very good. My wife and I should have shared but we're too worried it wouldn't be enough....that was not a problem! Could only eat half so we'll have the rest later. Nice kind of small dinner but really good and apparently popular. Glad we tried it."}
{"text":"Went in today for brunch and ordered Huevos Rancheros, which was delicious! The staff is extremely friendly our server Misti was very sweet and did a great job listening to our order , and she made sure that our drinks were never empty. Also, the food was served in a timely manner. I definitely will recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I stopped in here today with a buddy of mine and was immediately taken back by the amazing greeting that I received from all of the employees when I walked through the door. I was seated quickly and asked for my drink order. Within 2 minutes our server Thomas, who was outstanding and very attentive, came over to the table and introduced himself and let us know about the specials. I decided on the Chile Relleno and my friend got the Country Burrito. Both are in the picture that I added and will definitely fill you up. This is a place that I will be adding to my usual breakfast spots and you should definitely experience for yourself. Fast and friendly service with a menu that will fill your stomach without emptying your wallet."}
{"text":"Today me and my wife went here and it was ok. My wife ordered the Loco Moco which was good. I ordered the corned beef and hash and it had an acquired taste.  It's not your traditional regular,  maybe other people might like it but something i wouldn't order again. The service was  good. Our server gave me a discount since I hardly ate my food. Wish he would offer me something else but oh well. Maybe we'll come back, so many other places to eat at in the area. Good luck."}
{"text":"'Best Eggs Benedict ever' said my husband.  That is an unheard of recommendation coming from him...  I was so happy when I saw that Peg's had opened a place here.  We had been to Peg's in Reno a few times and it has become the gold standard for Huevos Rancheros for me.  I like all of the different flavors in the skillet and how they blend together.  Cabbage and eggs?  Yes please!  To top it off the service was spot on as well.  I will recommend this place to everyone and hope they don't overcrowd it on weekdays."}
{"text":"Breakfast was delicious!  I got the Hawaiian Teriyaki Chicken and Egg dish. It was very good and a lot of food. I could not finish it.  Also great to get away from the Las Vegas strip and meet some locals! Everyone was so friendly!"}
{"text":"The service of course is great and I the food is excellent. All the servers were very sweet and attentive. A daughter of the owners was there and she was also super nice and concerned about our enjoyment. A fantastic experience overall. Interesting and comfortable interior decorating and you can see a significant portion of the kitchen which I personally like. Booths are nice and long, gotta love that. The atmosphere is very much a breakfast crowd, families relaxing enjoying coffee.  The huevos rancheros and the enchiladas were amazing. Cole slaw and salsa that came with both were perfect. Beans amazing!  I got the eggs Benedict which was pretty perfect in my opinion, but not the most interesting of items. Next time I'll get something a bit more exciting."}
{"text":"This place is a neighborhood favorite! We were so excited to have another delicious breakfast spot off the busy street of Eastern!   Who doesn't love the idea of breakfast in a skillet! It looks home made, taste home made, and is simply picture perfect! When it taste like your mama made it, that's something we can all get behind!   Also, the variety of food that is on the menu is endless. From breakfast favorites like French Toast to unique options like a Veggie Egg White burrito!   Welcome to Henderson Peg's! I hope we're treating you as good as you're treating us!"}
{"text":"Great place. Food consistently awesome.   Well done peg.  From out of town and plenty of locals here... always a good sign."}
{"text":"Henderson is just bursting with great breakfast spots, and Peg's is the latest option to hit this side of town- and they're solid contenders to be your new favorite!   Came in with Bethany E and shared the Tamale & Egg plate and a featured special, the Crabcake Omelet. The tamale was the star of that plate, which was served in a huge skillet with eggs, beans, coleslaw, fruit, and hash browns. You could practically feed a family with this! Everything was good, but the tamale was great and I'd totally get it again.   The omelet was bursting with flavor, with the cake in crispy bits rather than one large slice, making it easier to enjoy a bit of everything in each bite- lots of mushrooms, onions, tomatoes, and capers, with a rich hollandaise on top!  In addition to great food, the service was on point with constant refills and smiles. Happy to have Peg's now at the other end of Nevada, looking forward to coming back to try more!"}
{"text":"Good, but a notch below the original in Reno. Cant go wrong with anything on the menu. Portions are good size so you might consider sharing, but then no you want it all to yourself. Salmon, tamales, ham steak, eggs benny, biscuits and gravy, Pegs Salad, like I said everything is good"}
{"text":"Amazing. Delicious. Everything you want in a breakfast spot. And it's even easy to handle if you're on a diet and want to eat healthy. They've got it all. I predict this place to soon be in the \"best of Las Vegas\" list. Glad they're here. So so so good. I'm eating somewhere else while I write this and really regret not driving up the street to eat here. I won't let that happen again."}
{"text":"Love this place.  A Reno favorite brought to Henderson.  I was so excited and didn't leave disappointed.   Biscuits in gravy was great.  Sausage patty was great as well.  And you can't go wrong with their fresh squeezed OJ.   Mom loved the coffee.   They grind the beans in house. Service was great as well.  Super friendly and helpful.   All in all, I will be back."}
{"text":"So just found this place a few months ago, I. love. It. It's a little retro diner in a small strip mall next to Panera's.  Getting into this strip mall is a bit of a challenge, the entry ways are small and hard to find.  But once you do, check out this place. I absolutely LOVE diners so I'm always looking around for them.  They definitely passed the test! They have this HUGE ham steak, that covers this big skillet, it's so crazy looking and so good.  The favorite here  is huevos rancheros, it's super good, it resembled a more authentic dish than you would get ordering from other places.  I really do enjoy this place and you'll be sure to see me here more often!"}
{"text":"Really impressed with this place! I had heard good things and was not disappointed. Came here on a Sunday morning around 830am and they were able to seat a table of 4 within five min. The restaurant is pretty small but cozy with some outdoor seating. Our servers were very attentive, with at least 5 offerings of coffee refills in our 30 minute breakfast span. I ordered the turkey and egg breakfast - the turkey patty was huge and perfectly grilled. Hashbrowns were also delicious. The menu prices were more affordable than other local favorites but portions were still huge. I would definitely recommend stopping by/!"}
{"text":"Went in for lunch today. Great selections. Lots of things I would like to try. Ended up with the Chile Relleno Skillet. It was very good. Will certainly be going back. Only negative was the place had the cold air cranking & even with a sweater I was still freezing cold."}
{"text":"Love thr breakfast here. It is just dar enough out of the way that its not busy with all tourists. Its more of a local joint. The food is excellent and so is the service. I really enjoyed my pancakes which are huge. The eggs are really fluffy. I love it"}
{"text":"Came to Peg's this morning. We entered the restaurant and were promptly greeted by the hostess.  We sat down and say the chalk board specials. Looked through the menu as the waitress Gabby greeted us. We asked what she recommend. She suggested the huevos rancheros but my fiancé and I weren't feeling that. So my fiancé ordered the grandma s Bennie and I ordered country fried steak. The food came out hot and on point. My country friend steak was good but wasn't out of this world.. My fiancé's Benny was good I took a bite and I would have to say was pretty good. They do have unlimited toast. Gabby checked on which is good. Overall it was a great experience and I will go back."}
{"text":"Another successful breakfast adventure with Stefany V.  Peg's delivered good food and service!  We met up during the week for breakfast which made it easy to get seated quickly.  Service was very attentive.  Their coffee cups are small but it never went empty.  They were really good with refills around the dining area.    My fellow Yelper and I decided to split the special of the day: Crab Cake Omelet as well as the Tamale and Eggs breakfast.   The omelet met every expectation of mine.  It was generously filled with chopped up crab cakes, mushrooms onions and tomatoes.  It was lightly topped with hollandaise and capers.  I certainly enjoyed every bite.  The hash browns on the side were a good side to complete the large platter.     The Tamale and eggs were no slouch to our tasting.  Again it is served on a very large platter.  The Tamale is accompanied by eggs, hash browns, baked beans, coleslaw and fruit.  Geez! So much food! The Tamale was delicious.  I wouldn't think of getting those specific sides for breakfast but it was great with the tamale.   I always appreciate a new breakfast place opening up.  Peg's did not disappoint."}
{"text":"We came for brunch for the first time. We were in the mood for some \"home made style breakfast\" as we were driving down eastern we found it hiding in a corner. As soon as you walk in it's very modern,everyone was very welcoming, they have tables and big booths that fit about 3 average sized people on each side of the table, and that's giving them enough arm and body movement. I ordered the steak and eggs and boy was it good!! A little too much salt for me, but it was Eatable, my friends ordered their french toast sandwiches! Those are HUGE , two people can eat out of 1 orderr, it's three pieces of French toast stuffed with cheese, Spinach, & choice of meatThe steak and eggs was pretty decent as well in size. But those French toast waffles are A amazing. Out waitress was very friendly as well, after speaking to her we realized that Peg's originated in Reno, NV (my home town!) we will definitely be coming here again, it's the only one in Las Vegas but definitely worth the drive for the food!!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place since a friend of mine from Reno talks highly of it. Maybe it's missing the Northern NV magic? Or maybe the biscuits and gravy. It was MIA both times when we dined at this place. And the first time we came Mr B wasnt really impressed. Ended up with their Hawaiian inspired breakfasts. It was good, and done right, nothing really OMGawd good.  So it took awhile before we did a second visit. And couldn't understand why the biscuits and gravy were not ready early morning when we came here with friends from out of town. I felt I let everyone down. Oh well.  I do like they are open earlier than other places on Eastern Ave and it's pretty inexpensive and staff was friendly."}
{"text":"We made the trip over from Sunset Station just to go here, and from start to finish the whole experience was awesome ! Very friendly, attentive service, best freshly squeezed orange juice... I had the tamales skillet, and I can say it was out of this world!  So so sooooo good! And my honey got the corned beef hash, also was amazing !!! Nothing but 5+ stars from start to finish, soooo worth the drive"}
{"text":"This place is great. Wait times arent terrible (waited 20 minutes outside with the pigeons) and the food is on point. I have to deduct a star for the price. It's a bit high. I think our check was more than 60 for a family of 5. It is your stereo typical over crowded Sunday brunch place that you meet your parents at after church and yell at your kids to stay seated while you lose your mind...  I'd go again... maybe by myself."}
{"text":"I heard good things about Peg's and was literally passing by at lunch time with a buddy looking for a place to eat. Getting a parking spot or a table for a 1 PM lunch when the restaurant closes at 2 is not a problem. We were seated right away and Bianca, our server, was at our table immediately with a big smile and an offer to get our drinks. I was in the mood for something very fattening and opted for the Reuben on rye with Crispy fries ( really would have liked sweet potato fries but alas not an option at Pegs). My buddy got a patty melt with a side of fruit. Both options were incredibly filling and done quite well. Excellent service, reasonable prices, and good food. A good option for an informal  lunch."}
{"text":"Ate here after just getting into Vegas for vacation because a couple of people wanted breakfast & a couple of people wanted lunch. Was greeted warmly by the staff upon entering & immediately loved the decor.  Gabby was our waitress & she was very personable. I had the Monterey Jack burger with mushrooms & fries (which was super juicy), my boyfriend had the breakfast burrito, his aunt had the Prime Rib au jus & his uncle had a waffle with fresh strawberries. ALL of the food was very tasty and there were very generous portions as well.  The next 3 days we kept talking about how great the food was along with the service (Go Gabby!) so we had to go back before we left...the next time I had the breakfast quesadilla, my boyfriend & his uncle had the Prime Rib country style steak with gravy, and his aunt got the Prime Rib au jus sandwich again. Generous portions & all of the staff was just as friendly.  Will definitely be going back every time we go to Vegas!"}
{"text":"Went to Peg's on Memorial Day last Monday due to really great Yelp reviews.  I will mention that our Hostess, Amanda was very sweet, amazing, friendly and attentive.  However, my party and I were not very impressed with the food and the overall ambience of the place.   It had great potential but I will not be returning to Peg's for a long while due to the lack of experience that I have experienced.  The food that I ordered was average, it was one of their Hawaiian dishes and I was really looking forward to savoring the dish, but I only got to taste an average savory dish that I could have made at home. Perhaps, one of their non-Hawaiian dishes taste better.   The place is clean and new, we had troubles looking for the place as my GPS gave me the wrong directives to get there although we typed in the address that Yelp has.  That was very bizarre.   I hope that Peg's will continue to be successful because it has really great potential.  It was just not enough when we visited.  Good luck to all of you and I wish you the very best!"}
{"text":"This place is legit! The breakfast was amazing. The staff so attentive and on top of it. Thanks Brittany!!"}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast place! Huevos rancheros are not quite traditional because they don't have the tortilla underneath, and a few other changes but absolutely delicious!! Definitely recommend it! Beef chili omelette was also delicious. Homemade beans are tasty and served as a side dish with breakfast. Good coffee and great service!"}
{"text":"To anyone worried that this Peg's might not be as good as the one in Reno, it is just as delicious. The interior design is slightly more contemporary than the one in Reno. The biggest difference is that there is not an unlimited toast option unfortunately.  Other than that me and my family came in for Sunday brunch and we were seated relatively quickly. I had the smoked salmon benedict which was fresh and the egg was perfectly cooked. For quality breakfast food I would recommend this place over Eggworks."}
{"text":"We just found our families new favorite breakfast spot.The Chili Relleno and The Monte Cristo are awesome! Our server Gabbi and her training partner took great care of our family. Great to have such a good spot in the  neighborhood."}
{"text":"This place is pretty new so I will be back before completely turning them away. The food was okay, nothing special. Out of a lot of corn beef hash that I have had, this one was not that good, also not terrible. Service was okay as well. For being a small place you'd expect refills and service to be a little faster, but like I said, it's a new place so I can't be too harsh."}
{"text":"Stuck in this area of town while staying with my son in the hospital nearby.  Sunday morning, we thought it might be a treat to get breakfast to go from Peg's and give it a try because the reviews looked good.  We ordered a bagel and cream cheese for my son who is having trouble eating.  They gave us one teeeny-tiny cup of cream cheese for his whole bagel.  Also ordered the Turkey Joe's Scramble (normally a favorite).  We've had Joe's scramble before and it usually has eggs. This looked like just browned turkey....Hey Peg, put some eggs in there!.  The side with the scramble was supposed to be some GRITS (thought my son might be able to eat that), Ahh...yeah...no grits in the bag.  No condiments, no butter, no jam, barely any cream cheese, no nothing.  Not impressed with their TO-GO skills and won't be ordering anything from there anytime soon.  Sorry Peg, first time and last time customer!"}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to go try this place for the first time. We got there and there was a 20 min wait, no problem. As soon as we were seated that's then I realized the customer service was horrible. The waitress in charge of our area (which I don't remember her name but she has short dark hair) did no show any urgency to help us out. After 15 minutes of us waiting she finally came and asked what we wanted to drink, it took her another 10 minutes to send someone else to bring them and did not give us a straw. A different lady (Carmen) came and took our food order. 1 family came after, their drinks arrived within 2 minutes and they got their food within 10 minutes. An older couple sat next to us, we were still waiting for our food. She gladly came and brought drinks right away, I told my husband if they got their food before us we were leaving; they did. That's when I decided to walk out. Those families were white, we are Mexican. It is really sad to know that a restaurant allows their employees to behave like this. Will not be coming back to this place!"}
{"text":"Referred by a friend. Location was 10 min from the strip where we were staying. They have outside tables to eat which was a plus, because we had our dog traveling with us and bikes on a rack to look out for. Nice welcoming  atmosphere in the inside as well! Service was great and food for breakfast was delicious! The biscuit & gravy was the best I ever tasted! The flavored sauce and biscuit was fluffy and so yummy, a must try! My husband had their eggs benedict plate and enjoyed it as well. You have to try thier sausage patty if you like sausage. We definitely will be back and look foward to eating here again! :)"}
{"text":"Yummy! Delicious breakfast. Highly recommend. Has the French toast which was huge! My husband had the rancheros which was even bigger than mine."}
{"text":"The food is great! Very yummy. The staff are all nice. They give you good size servings, very filling."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing, the customer service here is amazing, I cannot wait to go back and have breakfest, warning all the plates are pretty big."}
{"text":"First time here and this diner was not that pleased. My coffee cup was dirty and had to ask for a clean one, it took three trips for my server to get a clean one. I ordered Ham Steak and over medium eggs. My ham was super dried out and the eggs were over hard. My Husband ordered Chorizo and eggs he recalled that it was just alright nothing special. We were trying this place out and found it a little lacking. The Management and staff greet you from the opening of there door but service drops off there. I only was offered coffee at the beginning of my order and I had to ask each time I wanted more. Breakfast for two was 35.00 plus tip."}
{"text":"This restaurant was delicious. I tried the Eggs Benedict with blackened salmon and it was to die for. The hash browns were crispy and the orange juice gave me life. I'd definitely suggest going here for a wonderful weekend breakfast."}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast.   Homemade, unbelievably quick (considering it was a packed house on a wait), huge portions and just down right delicious .  The nicest owners you could ever meet.  Met a nice couple having breakfast, enjoyed conversation and the right blend of hospitality from the owners Jewel and Dave.  We will definitely frequent \"our new favorite breakfast place\" on a regular basis."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Pictures say it all. As good as it looks. All the dishes were delicious.  Sausage patty was flavorful, corned beef hash was homemade and meaty, tamale was tender and tasty and the hash browns were crispy on the outside, tender on the inside.  Definitely a must every time we come to Vegas!   Service was excellent.  Servers answered all our questions with smiles and chefs accommodated my substitutions.u"}
{"text":"YUMMM !! third day in a row i've been here, and let me tell you..... THE BEST waffles i've had in a longgg time if ever.  staff are are friendly and welcoming. very attentive and personable! the first time we ordered we got take out. i can't remember what i had because it was almost a week or 2 ago. came back 3 days ago to sit down.... i ordered steak and eggs . it was good but my bf ordered the waffles and i tried his and i was like nope i'm getting this next time.  came back the next day(yesterday) and i got the waffles with bananas () bacon, eggs, bacon and hash brown. everything was sooooo good!! the bacon , the hash browns were seasoned nicely. then i came back today. still good. i love this place & will continue to come back."}
{"text":"The skillets have a great presentation, but the food looks better than it tastes. The chile relleno was wrapped in and served with a side of overcooked scrambled eggs. Flavor wise, I prefer a chile relleno from a Mexican market, where the silver skillet gets swapped for a styrofoam box. Everything else in the skillet- pinto beans, hash browns, and veggie salads- tasted pretty good, but I couldn't eat the eggs. The coffee was bad. If a breakfast place doesn't get these two things right, they can't really compete with all the other options in the area. It's unlikely that I'd choose to eat at Peg's again, but I think I'd stick with the vegan skillet, which includes the best parts of my meal."}
{"text":"We've been here for brunch twice. Both times we've had a great dining experience. On both occasions we've had to wait just a little bit for a table. I'm hoping it doesn't get too much more busy since I like this place so much.  The restaurant itself is nice, clean and comfortable. The servers are very friendly and very good at their jobs.   I love the variety of dishes they have on their menu. It feels like just the right amount variety for whatever I might be in the mood for, but not so much that it's like reading all five volumes of Game of Thrones.  The quality of their cooking is, frankly, better than any other breakfast/brunch type place I've been too in a loooong time. Their hash browns were ridiculously fresh and crispy delicious.  This is now my favorite breakfast/brunch/lunch place. I know if I go here I will find something delicious to eat and I'll have a good time eating it.   I don't give 5-stars lightly. They really do deserve it. I hope they can sustain this phenomenal level of delicious food and great service."}
{"text":"This place is very pleasant, I love the patience the waitress always show tot he customers. They are very cheerful  and serve with a smile on theirs face that's what make it great. I don't have a picture because it was so good what I order I hardly had time to think about it."}
{"text":"Wow....Breakfast ..fit for royalty. Had skillet special. Chicken enchilada,egg, home fries. Took 1/2 home and enjoyed it twice.Service eas awesome coffee never hit bottom.party of 4 and all of us are going back."}
{"text":"Very enjoyable, friendly staff, great food, good service, so far we have brought friends, dine 4 times in the last two weeks, recently discovered."}
{"text":"Not the worst is being generous. Low quality food. Ate 1/3 of my food. My son wouldn't even eat his pancakes."}
{"text":"We've been here a couple of times. The food was very good on both occasions and the portions were large."}
{"text":"This place is ALMOST a 5! Most of their food is great and you get more than you pay for. Service is pretty good. A few of their dishes are just \"eh\" typical breakfast and overall and its always cold in there.  I'd give this place a 4.5 and definitely will be coming back."}
{"text":"Peg's got it pegged. It was a full house and that speaks volumes.   Options? Many.  Hawaiian. American classic. Spanish.   Service? Perfection. Our waitress and everyone else was friendly and made sure our cups of coffee were always full and checked on us constantly.  Food? Huge portions. I got the loco moco and my finance got a rancheros skillet. I loved my food and it was big enough to feed two. The ground beef patty was good sized and had tasty gravy topping. There was were cups worth of white rice with two over easy eggs. Best part? The macaroni salad. I hate macaroni salad because normally it's tasteless and flavor lacks. This was good and had some type of red seasoning on top that gave it some zest.   Decor? New and clean Looks much larger in the inside than the street. Loved the simple set up with a view of the kitchen. Nothing hidden!"}
{"text":"I've been to Pegs 3 times and just realized I haven't posted a review. The menu has choices for everybody. They have specials on boards around the place too. Prices are GREAT for the portions you receive. I've tried the Mac Salad, Prime Rib Dip and the Biscuits and Gravy! All DELICIOUS! The service is kind, friendly and genuine! I'm going back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Very good food and the atmosphere is very family like. My girlfriend and I loved eating breakfast here"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! We got seated right away and the the service was fantastic. Our waitress, Angela recommended the Monte Cristo and I wasn't disappointed. The atmosphere was relaxed and our daughter loved the pancakes. We will definitely be coming here again!"}
{"text":"Awesome service and tasty food. Husband had the Hawaiian pork chops and egg breakfast. I had the waffle with eggs & bacon and added strawberries & bananas to the waffle. The waffle is so good it didn't need the fruit. Next time I'm having it plain. Staff are genuinely nice and inviting. Definitely worth giving this place your business."}
{"text":"My wife and I chose Peg's for a late Friday morning breakfast after landing at the airport. My folks live in Henderson and the location on Eastern Avenue was convenient. The hostess and servers were very friendly. We were able to walk in and get a table for two no waiting at 10 AM. The plates of food are generous in size with prices averaging around $12.My wife had the short stack of pancakes with eggs and sausage the large orange juice was fresh squeezed and tasty. The pancakes were OK but the meal arrived hot and quickly. I had the chicken fried steak with hashbrowns and eggs over easy. It was well prepared. Hashbrowns were crispy as was chicken fried steak, and the gravy was flavorful. No complaints on my part I was well fed. Overall, a good meal. We would come back."}
{"text":"Being on NY time, was excited to find this Hawaiian themed breakfast place of the Gods.  Walked in at 6:30 AM opening, sat at my favorite open kitchen tabletop so I could chat with staff and cooks and watch the show.  And what a show it was as watching the preparation of my crunchy hash browns, perfectly poached eggs over chorizo sausage patties sitting on a toasted English muffin and smothered in an amazing chipotle hollandaise sauce.  Drooling yet?  Then I went crazy and ordered a side of grilled spam, salty crunchy deliciousness!!  The service was 5 star as was the food, atmosphere etc.  Going back tomorrow!"}
{"text":"They were very attentive  to our sons food allergy and provided excellent service.  All the while double checking to make sure my child was enjoying his food but felt ok We loved it here and will be back."}
{"text":"After years of making Peg's my first stop on visits to Reno, they are finally in Vegas! Yay - great flavorful food, service with a smile, it's all you really need in a breakfast restaurant.  The skillets actually come in gorgeous skillets, making for a presentation likely to make your companion jealous.  The Huevos Rancheros is my favorite - a wonderful mix of freshness, spicy and perfectly cooked eggs.  You really can't go wrong with the menu.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I went there for the first time and sat at the counter. The food was quick and delicious. It's about as pricey as any other breakfast place in town. I would definitely come back another time."}
{"text":"Great place for brunch! French toast is some of the best I've ever had. Friends got an omelette and the Hawaiian breakfast and said theirs was excellent as well. Super friendly staff also. This place is a hidden gem, highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great food!!! Great staff!!! Wide variety. Will definitely be back. It is great to find a restaurant that is not the same old breakfast items. I love all of the choices to choose from."}
{"text":"I am in the minority with my review, everyone else gave them 5 stars so far.  Yes the portions are large and a nice varied menu.  I had eggs and lox and the eggs were dry and the whole dish was not all that flavorful.   The service was friendly but slow.  Small kitchen and maybe give them a chance to work out the glitches since they are newly opened.  But it took forever to get our food and the waitress looked as frustrated as we were.  In line with the prices from other similar places, not cheap but then again, big portions.  I was surprised I didn't get a choice of bagels.  Overall, not a bad place that will hopefully get better."}
{"text":"SO glad there is one here finally. Used to eat at this place in Reno all the time.  Definitely recommend!!!!  Used to be an hour wait or longer that's how good it is. No crazy wait here though."}
{"text":"Ate here for my first time this morning. First of all it was freezing in there, secondly I ordered chili rellenos and eggs. It took a while to get my meal and the chili rellenos, eggs and beans were cold.  The side of fresh fruit was ok except for bad grapes. Sent my meal back. The rellenos had seeds that were super hot. When I summoned the \"manager\" he never introduced himself. He apologized and gave me a 5.00 gift certificate on a 13.00 breakfast. I politely gave it back to him and said I wouldn't be back. To top it off...they miss billed both os us. Never will I go b"}
{"text":"Great breakfast and lunch selection. Today I ordered Chicken Fried Steak and Eggs. Cooked perfectly and very tasty. Service is fast and friendly. Will definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"Finally tried Pegs.  The space looks modern and nice on the interior.  I know they have multiple locations outside of LV so I was optimistic to try Pegs.  However,  it just isn't my cup of tea.  The waffle was bland and they don't have real syrup so if your used to real syrup then you aren't loving the fake syrup they offer.  The second item we ordered was country fried steak and eggs.  Again under impressed with the whole meal.  Doubt I will return.  But if you like a fast simple breakfast meal then you may like it."}
{"text":"this is my favorite place, my husband has tried many of the items on the menu and has loved them all....I am a traditionalist and get eggs and hash browns every time"}
{"text":"Great breakfast! Great customer service ...will  be returning for sure on our next trip to vegas!"}
{"text":"There are a number of breakfast places in this part of Henderson, but this is my new favorite. And I hate posting that here because I selfishly want it all to myself.   Service was amazing.  Morgan waited on us perfectly with a constant smile. And there was always someone else walking around with coffee and water, just in case.   The portions are significant and everyone enjoyed their meals. I had the California Benedict and will likely be enjoying my food coma the rest of the day. The coffee was strong and consistent, which is just now we like it.  Certainly not the cheapest place in town, but totally reasonable. The value is there.  And the service is literally the best around.   Bottom line: this is a place you want to be a regular."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast/brunch! I've been there 4 times and it's always been a great experience! The service is very friendly and attentive. The food always has a great presentation, large portions, and very flavorful. I've had the Loraine Omelet twice (bacon, onion, and Swiss cheese) and my husband enjoyed his Veggie omelet. It gets busy, but the tables move quick. They also have seating outside and counter seating. Very nice ambiance and decor. Would highly recommend going here."}
{"text":"Before our food even came out I was pretty sure I'd be back here for breakfast regularly. As soon as we sat down there was coffee in our cups, and right as I finished my first cup someone came around refilling. The service was great like that the whole time. The food was great too. I had French toast and eggs and a sausage patty. The French toast and sausage were both huge and cooked perfectly."}
{"text":"Decided to try this new breakfast place and I wasn't disappointed. Good food and VERY friendly staff.  The manager/owner stopped by my table twice to check on me.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"This place is Terrible! Bad customer service. We grabbed a table outside in to set under the umbrella in the shade, after ordering our food and drinks the manager proceeds to come out and demand that we take the umbrella down due to the wind. She was very rude about it and we ended up leaving before our food could even get there due to her unprofessionalism! The managers name is \"Jewl\" so she said.  When I asked for her name she was very hesitant to give it to me.   Bad reviews all around, don't waste your time"}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed. Today is Valentine's Day, so My husband and I decided to try out Peg' s Glorified Ham And Eggs for the first time. With me being 9 months pregnant (due any time now) we call in an order for pick up so we can enjoy it at home with our 19 month old daughter.  A woman answers the phone and puts me in a brief hold to transfer me to the hostess who she says takes the to-go orders. A young man picks up and takes my order very slowly and thoroughly, repeating everything back to me at the end of our conversation. We ordered 3 meals. Very simple. He told me the price and said it would be ready in 15-20mins. We get to Peg's and my husband goes inside to get our order. The host and \"manager\" inform him that they don't have an order in for him. My husband laughs, thinking I must have messed up and called it in to the wrong location. Soon to realize there is only one location in Las Vegas. He returns to the car to tell me, so I  go inside with our daughter to see what the issue was. I told him what time I called in and he tells me he only has 2 to-go orders in and they are for grub hub. The \"manager\" blames the host again saying he must have forgot to put in our order. At this time it's 11:05am and the restaurant is not busy like you would think it should be. The \"manager\" very rudly asked \"ok so what did you order?\".. I again repeat my order to him and he said he would have it out for us in 5 minutes. He goes to the kitchen and talked to the cooks and returned to the host stand, added up our order and asked for payment. My husband told him no problem, we would pay just as soon as our food was out and ready. He then walked back to the kitchen, told the cooks to cancel and returned to tell us \"ok well I'm not going to be able to get your food out for you!\". We were totally shocked!! We were willing to wait even longer and pay with no issue, but he decided our service wasn't worth it. We asked for his name and the name of the owner and he tore a piece of receipt paper and scribbled down a name \"Cordell Herrera\" and walked away.  My husband and I both work in the food industry and clearly know this is NOT how you treat a customer. Sadly we will not be returning to try the food, which we were excited to find a new place in our neighborhood to eat. Very very dissapointed."}
{"text":"Great find for breakfast on our way through town! We started with some vanilla iced coffees that were really good - free refills and they'll give you one to go! I had one of their skillet options that was the perfect amount of food to fill me up. The country fried steak and corn beef hash were good, well seasoned. We left our plates empty! The only reason I give it 4 stars is that our service was slow at times (especially when waiting for the check). But definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing!!! Fresh squeezed orange juice, fluffy pancakes, & a variety of different of breakfast choices. I got the Chile relleno & eggs skillet, absolutely delicious and a good sized portion of everything. Best breakfast I have had hands down!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing : friendly staff, warm environment, and AMAZING food. We set at the table across the kitchen bar and enjoyed hearing the happy chefs enjoying the cooking of meals and singing! Don't let the lighter side of the menu fool you. Size of the dish is very generous with great portions of vegetables and ingredients. My husband had chuck and eggs with side of grits and he couldn't stop raving about how amazing they were. We will definitely be back and be sure to bring our family and friends here.  Great job to the staff who made our experience most enjoyable!"}
{"text":"I loved Pegs in Reno and was eager to try their first location in Henderson. Right when you walk in everyone greets you warmly. A nice touch and a sign of good training for this location. It's beautifully appointed on the interior with comfortable yet modern decor. Everyone is very nice. I ordered the huevos rancheros and coffee. Coffee is on point and the huevos rancheros skillet were just as good as I remember in Reno.  It is truly an experience. The beans the sauce the hash browns. Well seasoned and stunningly presented. Check out the photo of this dish to believe it."}
{"text":"When you send over an employee to act as a manager, you will get 1 star for everything. Service was horrible and the management was weak in correcting problems. The food can be found in any other breakfast place and the 'Glorified Ham' was 'Plain'O'Ham', there's really nothing special about this. The place needs to get their stuff together. I couldn't recommend anyone I know to come here."}
{"text":"First time since it opened and wad pleasantly surprised. The usual American, Mexican, Hawaiian menu you may find at anynif the egg establishments. Small bust place but still good service.  Thing that surprised me the most was the biscuits and gravy. Normal country gravy but the biscuits are the most fluffy and tasty that I've had. Not dense little hockey pucks. Really great. I would say stop by just to see how biscuits should be made."}
{"text":"This brunch gem is definitely glorious.  I stopped here around noon with three other people to get our brunch on.  I was impressed by their extensive menu which also included Hawaiian breakfasts as well.  I went with their tamales and eggs ($10.99).  My tamales and egg dish came out on a HUGE hot pan with hash browns, beans and salsa.  My tamales were served with a ranchero sauce which was very good.  I was glad I got it.   The others who came with me got their grilled salmon benedict ($13.99), strawberry belgium waffle ($7), and the Hawaiian breakfast ($11.50).  Everyone was happy with their dishes and we all left super full.  Each dish was very large and are definitely shareable.    The pricing here is really cheap for how much you get.  I love that there was so many different things on the menu.  They also have lunch food as well.  The service was excellent.  The food came out fast and the people who work here are very nice.  This place is definitely worth checking out for breakfast."}
{"text":"Great food. Great ambience. I got the lorraine omelette and was delicious and filling!"}
{"text":"When this place first opened, you can pretty much order anything on the menu and know it would be good. A few months later and this place has gone downhill!  Complicated dishes like their Monte Cristo sandwich and their Mexican dishes in skillets are good but they've managed to screw up the basics like scrambled eggs and bacon by over cooking them.  Don't order any dishes that feature rice because the rice is always hard. It's hit or miss with this place. Depends on how busy they happen to be when you get there because you'll wind up waiting over 20 minutes and nothing is more frustrating than to see if they bussed their tables sooner perhaps I would be seated sooner. Oh and if it is really busy when you're there, double check the cleanliness of your silverware and glasses.  I'm sure floating bits in one's water glass are not a gift with purchase.  Hoping that they turn things around and maybe this is just growing pains but don't foresee visiting this place for a long while."}
{"text":"Owner has no clue about seating etiquette. Be aware of where you are in line. Owner will seat others before groups that have been waiting longer. Feeling that first come first served is not their motto. The food is good, however they still need to work on ensuring orders come out right. If you require something additional bring your patience with you. The flow of orders to the floor needs to be streamlined. Wait staff seemed more concerned about taking orders than getting orders served. Big portions with a lot of different choices. Not to keen on having slaw with my breakfast. Pico has the right amount of heat. Chile verde the pork was tender. Chicken fried steak was perfect."}
{"text":"They have Hawaiian style breakfast here! There's so much food on the large Hawaiian Style Breakfast plate that my husband couldn't even finish it! I had the Salmon Eggs Benedict and it comes with tomatoes, onions, & capers with cream cheese and hollandaise sauce. Great customer service and freshly squeezed orange juice. Not super cheap though, it'll cost you about $32.00 for a breakfast like this!"}
{"text":"Took our 1st 15 min break to pick up three orders for our office and they were slammed but had our order ready and always ONO;)"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place a lot and overall it was decent but there were a few things that just didn't sit well with us and because of that the experience wasn't all we hoped it would be.  We came here last Thursday for a late lunch. We hurried to get there since they closed at 2:00 and being in the restaurant industry I know how aggravating it can be when you have a table walk in 10 minutes before close.  We got there at 1:15 and felt like it shouldn't be an issue. We were greeted by a young girl and walked over to our seat. Immediately we were turned off. The table directly next to us, we sat along the wall on one of those long booths where the tables are beside each other, was filthy. It was obvious there was a family that had been sitting there. Crayons, cups, used napkins, and pieces of fruit directly on the table were scattered all over the place. We looked around and saw 2 other tables that hadn't been bused. We thought that this would be addressed soon but it wasn't.  We decided to order. My friend got the chile relleno and eggs skillet. Comes with eggs, hash browns, pico, cabbage slaw, pinto beans, a homemade chile relleno and warm tortillas. Not sure where the slaw fits in. But everything else was tasty. The chile relleno was on the smaller side but the eggs were cooked to order and the beans had a nice flavor. Never got our tortillas. Pico was a little off. Seemed it was old, had a mushy consistency to it. Overall decent for $11.99 and we gave it 4/5.  I had the \"Altogether\" sandwich. It's basically a fried egg sandwich with green chiles, jack cheese, avocado, lettuce and tomato with mayo on sourdough. All together for $10.99. Well I was disappointed. I was hoping for a runny egg. Like over medium or sunny side up. Wasn't given a choice. Egg was secretly overcooked and dry. Avocado was beyond brown and mushy. The tomato slices I got were the end cuts. And the lettuce was the butt part that had already turned brown. Best part was the fries that I had asked for extra crispy. Gave this a 2/5.  Here were are 40 minutes after arriving and have been watching for about 30 minutes and the table next to us has yet to be cleared. There seemed to be the waitress who was helping us, a gentleman who I want to say was the manager or assistant manager, a host and another waitress. And yet no one cleaned the tables until was 5 to 2:00 and everyone seemed to want to go home. Even the hostess was more concerned with her side work than cleaning the tables. And mind you there were only 2 other tables being occupied so they weren't that busy.  The service was good. Exceptional, not really, but good. Food was ok. Prices are decent for what you get. Not sure I'd go back though."}
{"text":"The kids loved their eggs. The half stack was big and fluffy. Mmm. The breakfast burrito was great my guy cleared his plate. Rogelio was super friendly and gave great suggestions. Thank you"}
{"text":"Great food, generous portions, and friendly staff. Wanted to get out of hotel for some breakfast and found Peg's on Yelp. Was pleasantly surprised and would definitely come back the next time I'm in Vegas. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"This is why I love yelp... you go to places where you probably would have never even thought about trying until you see that it's got good ratings and reviews... and I would like to add to the list of free great reviews...  1. The staff was so friendly and welcoming 2. I thought the portions of the food was huge... not only was it huge but yummy. I had the original eggs benedict, extra crispy hashbrowns, and a side of toast... even the toast was on steroids  And the kids pancake was bigger than my niece's face! I don't have a lot of regrets in my life but I do regret not trying their oj... so with that being said I'll see you next time I'm in town Peg"}
{"text":"Denver omelet comes with cheese. Otherwise it's just scrambled eggs! https://gunthertoodys.com/scrambled-history-denver-omelette/"}
{"text":"I went here one day when I needed to kill some time and eat. It's super cute and little and the kitchen is open. Nice chill vibe. The food was really good and I was doing this diet that had me eating a lot and there was no judgement for me sitting by myself and ordering two plates of food! I really appreciated that. I only gave it four stars because in the beginning the service was rather slow. I kept looking around for somebody to come to me and he place wasn't too busy-then again maybe they were short staffed. But other than that it was very good."}
{"text":"If I could give them more stars I would definitely do it. It's my third time here and I absolutely love it. Staff is extremely attentive and polite. Cordell was helping us today and he was doing an amazing job! No matter what you order, everything comes out quick and delicious. I love his place and I definitely recommend it! Just be aware that the portions are pretty big so you can easily share if you are not very hungry."}
{"text":"Yum!!  Great service and great food!  Can't go wrong here!  I would highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Tried this new breakfast lunch place, thoroughly enjoyed. Customer service great, very attentive, nice n clean, large food portions. Very delicious. Will definitely go again."}
{"text":"If you're looking for good breakfast or lunch, at reasonable prices, be sure to visit this place. We loved the food, the service was great, and the atmosphere was pleasing. We will go back."}
{"text":"Very simply one of the best breakfast joins. Generous portions at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"GREAT service and great food. The portions were big and the staff is very friendly and helpful. Thanks"}
{"text":"Went there today for the first time. Sat at the counter. What an experience. They have some operation going on in a small place and nobody gets in any bodies way. I had an omelet and my husband  had the Chili Rhenos platter. Both were delicious and either one could have been shared. Great spot for breakfast or lunch. Varied menu with lots of choices. ENJOY! WE DID."}
{"text":"I really like this place. Cant wait to bring my family from Hawaii to eat there. I had the hawaiian breakfast which was really good and my husband had the jack cheeseburger with mushrooms and he said tjat was the best tasting burger that he had in a long time."}
{"text":"My favorite steel cut oatmeat with scrambled egg whites and side of bacon. Add smashed avocado and a heart healthy breakfest to begin your day. Friendly and attentive staff. One of few dinners with steel cut oatmeal."}
{"text":"Love this place so much!! The food is SPECTACULAR. The only place I've ever found that serves blackened salmon for breakfast. YUM! The service is also very great! Never disappointed :)"}
{"text":"Passing through and found this gem on yelp! Just opened this week and was PHENOMENAL! The couple who owns the place were very friendly and came by our table to shake our hands and make sure we were enjoying ourselves and our food! The staff was wonderful as well! Not just our awesome waitress Ariane, but the entire staff made their rounds to make sure every table was doing great! Everyone's food was top notch! It makes me upset there isn't one in Houston!!"}
{"text":"New favorite breakfast place after Sunday  mass! Food was delicious! Service was great! Atmosphere nice! Our server Gabby was very informative and attentive! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and both times I loved the food. I had an omelette and a skillet. My stepdad and boyfriend had the chicken fried steak and they enjoyed that as well."}
{"text":"Stop by this morning for a bite and what a delight! It was about 11:45; a bit crowded so we option for the Counter, (as it turns out they are the best seats in the house). We put our menus down and watched plates and skillets pass, a much better way to decide. Great food, awesome team work demonstrated by staff, who were extremely friendly, very pleasant first experience. Yes I'll return!"}
{"text":"A friend of mine recommended this place and I'm a bit disappointed after having high expectations from here.  It was a busy Sunday brunch rush and the place is not that big, our server was nice (not as efficient) but forgot the whipped cream on my child's minnie pancakes. I order the chili to go on top of my loco moco without the gravy and it was an additional $2.50 charge which I had no problem with paying, the food though was just ok. It was not mind blowingly delicious. Mediocre would be a subtle way to describe it. The chili moco at Babystacks is a hundred times better than here hands down.  Would I be back? Probably not.  It wasn't for me and I'm pretty picky when it comes to breakfast or brunch places."}
{"text":"Stopped based on other yelp reviews, and we were not disappointed. Service was friendly and prompt, food was fresh delicious and the portions were very good. Next time in the area we will be back"}
{"text":"WOW!!!! This place is amazing. One thing is for sure they don't know what the word small means. The portions are huge and everything is delicious. I don't know how long this place has been here because I just moved here, but the place is very bright and modern and decorated nicely. The staff is very friendly and attentive and if you like coffee it is bottomless as they are always there to warm up your cup. I highly recommend this place. Come hungry or you will be taking home leftovers."}
{"text":"Wow! This is my first time here and I will be coming  back. The service is friendly and attentive.  The restaurant is clean and modern. I came for breakfast and ordered the chili relleno skillet. It is an epic meal. Lots of tastes and tortillas too!  I'll take some pictures next time. Come here and eat!"}
{"text":"Just had a pretty bad experience this morning. Surprisingly there was only a handful of people in the resturant but the food still came out very sub par. The island pork chops rice was undercooked and made the eggs in edible, the country fried steak was soggy and tasted like death. The one redeeming thing was that we had unlimited toast lol.. after telling the waitress about my food she just said.. sorry and kept moving. When she brought the check out again I mentioned about the food and had hardly touched my plate yet they still had the full charge on the ticket. Finally she removed it but man not a good experience all around today."}
{"text":"This place is really awesome. Open from 6:30 - 2 for breakfast and lunch. Food is really, really good - and the portions are not for small eaters. I would suggest that sharing a skillet dish would probably make sense! They do specials (check the whiteboard) but we never seem to get off the menu! Great people who will spend the time to get to know you, which is really nice. Coffee and fresh squeezed OJ (no alcohol) round out the meal!"}
{"text":"Small breakfast restaurant of about 15 tables open daily 6am to 2pm. The restaurant was busy for a Wednesday around 10am but no waiting.  My omelette and hash browns was just okay, quite bland. We only got one slice of toast with each of our breakfast but I thought the bread was good. Hubby did not care for steak or their grits. His overcooked steak was paper thin and looked more like a chopped steak rather than a New York. First time I've ever seen him push his food away. Coffee was good as well as the service."}
{"text":"Good breakfast/lunch place. Nothing too out of the ordinary when it comes to breakfast. I had the vegan skillet. It was tasty and I had enough to take home."}
{"text":"I would always go to Pegs when I would visit my family in Reno!! And was very excited when I heard they were coming to Vegas!! The staff is very friendly, great service and food is great!! The huevos rancheros skillet is delicious and the portions are big and prices affordable"}
{"text":"Love it here! Huge portions, great food, and a friendly wait staff... I have been here once a month since January, and have never been disappointed... my favorite is the cali benni. I haven't tried any lunch items because their breakfast is so good!"}
{"text":"Hidden little spot on Eastern near Freddy's/Krispy Kreme that's definitely worth a visit!  Came on a Thursday morning to no wait. We were seated right away and waited on.  Food was very good, portions are very large. We had  the Huevos Rancheros and Chile Rellenowhich the server called the best two things on their menu and they were delicious.  Great price, great atmosphere, delicious food. Will definitely return for a second visit."}
{"text":"Let me start my saying this place is family owned and AMAZING  home cooking at its best , you can taste the freshness of the food . The staff make you feel welcomed as soon as you walk into the door they take the time to say hello also they are on point to keep checking on you for refills for coffee or anything that you are having as a beverage the staff always point out the specials of the day that they are posted handwritten on the wall so always take the time to look at those since it won't be in the menu . THEIR menu is simple and I will point out that their food servings are very good size but their not shy to get BIG portions and their pacific island part of the menu is a MUST try , you won't be disappointed .  It's an average size building BUT they always try their best to accommodate everyone and there is even tables outside to even accommodate you and if you are bringing your pets with you . If you are looking for that home cooking  feeling restaurant and great food come here. IM DEFINITELY coming back !!!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by the food . Large portions, great breakfast variety and everything tasted fresh and delicious. Their Pico and pinto beans were perfect. The decor was very modern and clean. Staff was extremely friendly."}
{"text":"Food amazing. Service was meh. Was not busy and forgot my coffee waited 5 minutes and them had to flag down another server to get it.   Seems minor, but I needed my damn coffee.   Portions were large. Food great. Will be back.  Just don't make me wait for my coffee.  I tell you what."}
{"text":"This is a good place with a lot of good dishes. Portions are huge! We have tried huevos rancheros and it was delicious. The place is very busy on Sunday morning and we sat at the bar for breakfast. Definitely not a place if you want to eat healthy. I think we also got light bite burrito and it was not small or light but it was filled with many many veggies."}
{"text":"My first time and DEFINITELY not my last.  The food, the service, the speed, the portions....ALL first class.  This will now be our \"Go To\" place.  No more trying to decide where to eat.  THIS is the place !!!!"}
{"text":"Monday morning, and we wanted to have breakfast somewhere that we have not had b-fast before...Peg's had 4.5 overall rating so we gave it a shot.  We ordered the following: -Corned Beef Hash and Eggs: came with toast and fruits, hashbrowns or grits.  I opted for the extra crispy hashbrowns.  I also ordered a side of rice.  The eggs I requested to be over medium and broke these suckers up and mixed in with the rice.  The corned beef is chunky and I liked it.  None of that ground up meat stuff. The sourdough toast I got were Texas Toast size, buttered up, and was so fresh and delicious. -The \"Leo\" : lox, eggs, onions and capers, opted for wheat toast instead of a bagel, and hashbrowns.  Peg's cook sure know how to cook the lox because it was just right.  Typically at other places, the lox are either overdone or undercooked.  Not at Peg's. -Orange Juice: Large size and true to what it was listed on the menu..fresh squeezed!  Our tab was a little less than $40 before tax...so for fresh quality ingredients, it was worth it.  We will return."}
{"text":"This place was pretty good! I liked all the options. They serve you A LOT of food! The only recommendation I would make was that the beans we had that day were lacking MAJOR salt (possibly forgotten) and the English muffin I had for my eggs Benedict was soggy. Next time I want to try the loco moco I'm sure it's good!"}
{"text":"I had really high hopes for this place. Unfortunately, it's just an average breakfast spot that still needs to find its flow, at best. I came in on a Saturday morning and the place was jammin'! I sat at one of the counter seats that faces the kitchen. They also use the counter (literally in front of you) as a place to expedite and garnish dishes. If anyone coughed or sneezed, the expedited dishes would surely catch some of that! The seat I was asked to sit at was still not cleaned from the previous guest, so that wasn't a good start.   It's a very tight kitchen, so I understand they're just trying to make the most of their space, but the counter/expo line really needs some re-thinking.   The servers also toast their own bread on the expo line and that area is just a complete mess when they're busy. If the cooks are going to be a main focal point in the restaurant (by allowing customers to watch them work), they need to be more organized/clean, watch how they re-plate dishes and keep the language & messing around under control.  The expediter was also my server, might I add. He was so busy running the line, it made it difficult for him to also focus on the counter customers needs.   I ordered a coffee/water and \"Pegs favorite breakfast,\" the huevos rancheros. It was served in an actual pan - oversized and a bit awkward. The food, itself, wasn't great. The sauce was flavorful, but everything else on the  plate was a bit bland.  Prices are reasonable. I may be back again in a few months to see if they've improved the operation. I'll definitely try something else."}
{"text":"Just opened this month in Henderson.  If your'e looking for a hearty fresh home made style breakfast or lunch, with a little bit of a Hawaiin flair this is your place.  This new location is tucked behind Panera Bread and Koury's Fine Wine & Liquors on Eastern Ave.  The ambience and vibration is fresh and clean.  High ceilings and an open air restaurant with the open air kitchen all in view.  This is not a \"hole in the wall\", although I do love little hole in the wall intimate cafes, etc.  Big menu with so many choices for breakfast from traditional ham and egg, pancakes, to more exotic Hawaiin style dishes like Loco Moco ( eggs over hamburger patty, with gravy served over rice) with macaroni salad), spam and eggs, chilli rice and more.  There is fresh homemade taste to the dishes, and the servings are big.  On my first visit I had the loco moco and my friend had the spam and eggs.  Eggs cooked perfectly, and the brown gravy over the rice was seasoned and very flavorful.  My friends spam and eggs were traditional Hawaiin style with thick pieces of spam to go with the eggs.  On my second visit I tried the hash and eggs and my dining partner had sausage and eggs.  2 perfectly poached eggs served over a tasty Pegs cafe made hash.  Both dishes were served with crispy hash browns that were moist in the middle.  Hash browns had a nice buttery taste on the outside and were tender and moist.  The service here is aloha style, friendly and attentive.  Your coffee cup will never be empty!  I promise you, you will not eat lunch after breakfast at Peg's."}
{"text":"I couldn't shovel this amazing food down my gullet fast enough.   The tamale & eggs is a perfect sized portion for a hungry person. My wife's bacon was perfectly crispy per her request, the eggs were perfectly over-easy per our request. Good diner style coffee. The service was excellent. 5 stars. Perfect experience."}
{"text":"The breakfast here is unbelievable! Huge portions and a very good price. The service is even better than the food! The place was busy the entire time we were there and the servers kept our coffee filled and checked in with us. Highly highly recommended."}
{"text":"Randomly found this place on Yelp on our way out. Amazing breakfast. Great quality and service. Will be back."}
{"text":"very good service and tasty food! the food took time to prepare but was worth waiting"}
{"text":"Food was good. Service though left something to be desired.  Got my food a good 5 minutes before my husband. I was over half done before he even started.  With his pancakes came this tiny maybe 2 oz container of syrup."}
{"text":"Tried Peg's for the first time today. About a 20 minute wait for a table on a Sunday around 10 am so not too bad compared to some of the other breakfast places in the area.   Ordered the chicken fried steak and eggs, meat lover's omelet, and kid's breakfast of eggs, bacon, toast, and hash browns.   Portions were really big. Could feed one hungry person or two people could even split a portion or have leftovers to take home.   They serve lunch all day too. Saw some good looking pancakes and skillets that I might have to try next time. And they have a toy box for the kiddos to pick through.   Really great food and service and a good addition to the area."}
{"text":"I have eaten there twice in the last week.  The first time was the 1/2 ham steak and eggs and the second was the chili relleno breakfast.  The first meal was quite serviceable and reasonably quick considering it was a Sunday morning.  The ham steak was a particularly good piece of ham (8 oz.), not the sorry excuse for ham that one often finds.  On the second visit, a weekday, I tried the chili relleno breakfast which was gargantuan. A chili relleno was served with two eggs, pico de gallo, cole slaw, flour or corn tortillas, and beans.  I was afraid that the sauce on the relleno was going to be a bitter red sauce, but it was not.  There was a little heat which is expected.  All in all I was very pleased.  However, I will add that the chili relleno was not a poblano chili which would have made it even better.  For the best relleno in Las Vegas, visit Las Cazuelas across the parking lot.    The decor and and service in the restaurant makes for a very pleasant breakfast experience. They are quite busy on the weekends, right now."}
{"text":"Glorious Glorious. Best chicken fried steak and eggs in my lifetime so far. Service was terrific water and coffee always topped off. I highly recommend this for breakfast."}
{"text":"Wow!!! This place is amazing! Our new favorite breakfast spot. The staff are great, but the food tho! They have a ham steak as big as your head, killer old school hash browns and the best omelettes....ever!! Oh and don't forget the endless, homemade toast! Cheers!"}
{"text":"So glad we had a chance to eat here!  Service and food was awesome!  Reminds me of the old Coco's Coffee Shop on Kapiolani Boulevard in Honolulu, Hawaii!"}
{"text":"I never write reviews, ever but today I was shocked.  The food here is delicious, the prices are comparable, but beyond that the service was incredible.  If you're in the vegas area this beats any restaurant I have ever had breakfast at there and totally worth the small drive!!!!"}
{"text":"The customer service is great. Thanks to Ari. The food was wonderful large portions. As a tourist it was great to see a lot of the locals here which means it's great place. Definitely worth the drive."}
{"text":"Absolutely awesome.  Huevos Rancheros to die for.  Service was excellent, fast and attentive.  Reasonably priced for the quality."}
{"text":"Peg's Glorified Ham n' Eggs - Henderson, NV  In Vegas, we have a lot of great breakfast spots to choose from and I am always down to try someone new.  Peg's Glorified Ham n' Eggs isn't new.  They're just new to Vegas.  I've been to the original located in midtown Reno and was extremely pleased with my visit. I gave the original location 5-Stars and have no reason to give this location any less.  Peg's serves breakfast all day, the portions are huge, and the prices are better than most.  I am more than just a fan.  I will definitely be back.   THE FOOD:   The first page of their menu consists of eggs, skillets, Benny's, biscuits, waffles, hotcakes, omelets, scrambles, and even Hawaiian dishes like Loco Moco's.  The 2nd page of their menu consists of healthier choices, lunch combos, sandwiches, and burgers.    THE SERVICE: Gabriela was my server on my first visit to this location.  She's a pro and transferred from one of the Reno locations.  It's good for us when a business sends their best to a new location.  Service from \"Car to Table\" was excellent.   ADDITIONAL INFO & TIPS: *Located right before St. Rose Parkway if you're heading south on Eastern Avenue (across from Chick-fil-A) *Hours 6:30 AM to 2:00 PM (Everyday) *Sit at the counter for a view of the cooks in action *Daily specials posted on the wall (BOLO) *Restaurant is typically busy after 8:00 AM.  Dies down around 1:00 PM.   *Unlimited toast (great for a carb-a-vore)  MY FAVORITES AND RECOMMENDATIONS: *Meat Lover's Omelet (packed with a ton of meat and eggs) *Chili n' Rice (They also serve chili omelets) *Ground Chuck & Eggs (I assume the Loco Moco and their burgers must be good since the beef patty is excellent) *Side of Portuguese Sausage (big portions, a little on the spicy side) *Hash Browns (get this extra crispy)"}
{"text":"Peg! Get in the kitchen and make me an ... omlette!   Who doesn't like to wake up on a nice morning and go enjoy a tasty breakfast with no clean up. Peg's has easily been added to the top of my breakfast rotation because of the consistent good food, solid service, and laid back atmosphere. The best thing i have had here to date is hands down the chicken fried steak. The crust on this thing is what makes it and you will not be sorry you ordered it. Food comes out quickly (at least usually), and always served with a smile. I did however deduct one star for my egg whites on an over easy egg, i would like little to no jiggly jelly (you know what i mean). In addition to that, something like inexpensive coffee, or a side of panacakes (yes its pana) with your breakfast would take this place over the top. So its good and consistent, which is better than other restaurants trying to do the same thing."}
{"text":"Oh my lord! Great breakfast has arrived.  Think about a place that will satisfy all your cravings in your pocket and stomach. Easy the best hash browns in town. OJ, fresh. I ordered the breakfast sandwich and everything about it was perfect. Crisp. Cheesy. Most importantly eggs cooked to perfection. I cant think of a better time at breakfast. The waiter could have been a little more patient though. I looked like she was taking advantage of the hype and getting you in and out as quickly as possible. Not the restaurant fault. She needs to make rent."}
{"text":"Great breakfast dishes-  had Joe's scramble with ground turkey...well seasoned and not dry ....coffee on point-didn't taste water down. Fast service- our wait staff was very attentive ....clean and bright environment."}
{"text":"Had the Hawaiian. Excellent quality. Plenty large serving sizes. Very friendly service!"}
{"text":"WOW! Just WOW!  This place knocks it outta the park. SOOOOO lucky to have this family owned joint here in Henderson-"}
{"text":"This is a fabulous place to eat. I recommend it to everyone.  We ate there twice for breakfast on a five day trip to Las Vegas. The French toast was the best I have ever had."}
{"text":"This place is really good, great service, yummy hot chocolate and they are fast! I got chicken fried steak (just a tad bit salty than I like) but still yummy the hash browns and eggs were perfect. My spouse got spam and eggs and it was delicious also!"}
{"text":"Comfort foods like pancakes, omelets, skillets, burgers, fries and grilled cheese are common items on the menu. They do have things like salads and egg whites, but mostly it's that yummy diner-esque feel foods.  Good for a morning where you feel a little worse for wear from a long night out, breakfast with the kids, or you're craving French toast, Peg's is the place."}
{"text":"Today was mine and my husbands first time here!  It  was a good atmosphere we were sat immediately, drinks were great tired the fresh OJ yum! And I ordered the chili relleno large portion it was very tasty had a great pico de gallo and cabbage slaw and beans amazing! my husband was jealous he order the stake and eggs it was good! We are definitely going to return !"}
{"text":"Thank you Em....the hash browns?!?!? to DIE FOR!!! Perfect ham steak!!! And the biscuits n gravy???? WOW!! The food was great! Service- fantastic!!!! Thank you so much!"}
{"text":"Great place,  amazing food and diverse selection. Service is always on point ! Juevos Ranchero is my favorite but everything is delicious"}
{"text":"I brought my dad here one morning when we were looking for a breakfast spot. Neither of us had been here, but we both agreed we'd love to come back. Our server was very nice and had such a soft voice perfect for a breakfast spot, the food was great and very quick if you're in a hurry you honestly could probably be out in less than 45 minutes maybe 30 if you order as soon as you sit and eat quick. I got what was like a glorified blt with eggs (I don't remember the name) but we easily could have shared it since I had half left when I was done. I ordered sausage gravy for my hash browns and it was amazing so I'd love to come back and try the bisquits and gravy next time I'm craving some. I'll def be coming back."}
{"text":"Horrible. French toast was dry, pancakes were under cooked, and the Reuben had no flavor. To top it off, it was ridiculously expensive."}
{"text":"My husband and I Stopped here on our way back to Arkansas. Amazing! Could not believe how great the breakfast was! I had never seen a meal that huge. The combination of beans and eggs for breakfast I had never had but I loved it. I wished I lived closer so I could go more often. Definitely worth traveling again to."}
{"text":"Stopped into the restaurant before catching my flight from Vegas and I was not disappointed. The waitresses are nice and the food is amazing! I got the Altogether Sandwich with fries and I would highly suggest this dish! It was sooo good! Everything that was brought out from the kitchen looked amazing! This breakfast restaurant has a Mexican Flare that I absolutely love! They serve macaroni as a side dish which I though was odd but overall a great place to eat!"}
{"text":"Been to this location a couple times and have nothing but good things to say!! Awesome friendly staff and the best hollandaise ive ever had!! Best hidden gem I've found in the area. Good job managment!!!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick bite. Ginormous delicious food. And great service. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Breakfast here now and request for Chile Rellino and eggs over medium with a plain waffle and water deink.  And everything was excellent and I'll be back."}
{"text":"First time here and love this place!! Richie was the best and very attentive. Eggs cooked perfectly, and I'm very picky. My husband said his Monte Cristo was probably the best he's ever had and on menu full time and not just special. Owner walking around and serving as well, visiting with folks. Will make this a habit"}
{"text":"Pretty good breakfast! The waitress was a doll and the ambiance was quiet. I'm not much of a breakfast person but Man! It was a tasty :)"}
{"text":"I loved this recent addition to the Henderson brunch scene. I can't argue with great food and great service. I liked that the restaurant felt like a diner, but with a more modern feel.   The menu has the usual breakfast staples, all day lunch, and some unique combinations. It was hard to choose just one thing from a menu featured platters that included Mexican food items, Hawaiian items, and great omelet combinations among other things.   All of the employees we encountered were great including our friendly waitress. We were seated right away, our food came out quickly, and we had everything we needed.   Since there were too many options to choose from I ordered two items. The Tamale and Eggs Skillet was great. I loved the unique items on the platter and everything included was delicious. The plate included eggs, beans, hash browns, a tamale, pico de gallo, and a slaw. The hash browns were perfectly crispy, the tamale had great flavor, and I loved the pico de gallo and slaw. The pico de gallo and slaw really made the platter unique and sent it over the top. My second entrée was French Toast to which I added cinnamon apples and was served with a nice portion of syrup. I enjoyed this breakfast staple. My husband ordered Loco Moco. We both thought this was delicious and liked the meat and gravy. The macaroni salad on the side was great!  I'm glad this new spot has entered the Henderson brunch scene. I'll be back soon for sure!"}
{"text":"Diner food, beautifully decorated indoor space. Some outdoor seating with umbrellas. Friendly staff. There was a wait, and our server passed us several times without checking on us. I needed a replacement fork, so I waited while my food got cold. When I was ordering, I asked about house-made items and got a blank stare. This kind of restaurant needs a claim-to-fame item(s), ex. house-made jam, fresh-baked bread, seasoned potatoes, etc; otherwise, it's stuff I can make at home/just like any other diner."}
{"text":"This place is seriously legit. I cannot put into words how on point everything was, from the hosts, to the service, to the food. We loved everything. Pegs has a warm and inviting atmosphere with friendly and attentive service. I ordered the chile relleno which was probably the best one I've ever had. My husband ordered the Monte Cristo. Soooo incredible. My girls were so excited to see Minnie Mouse pancakes on the menu to arrive to the table with fresh fruit for the face and whipped cream. This is our new favorite breakfast spot! Ask for Gabi, she's a terrific server and she made our morning."}
{"text":"I have heard a lot of positive reviews about this place and decided to give the breakfast joint a try. I surely did not regret it at all!  The food was extremely delicious and the prices were economical. I tried the Pegs Breakfast Burger which was huge, jam packed with flavor, and very very fulfilling.   For beverages, I had a cup of black coffee along with the burger which was very much up to standards.  The staff was extremely friendly and the place is definitely worth visiting. Looking forward to visiting it again in the near future!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. But unfortunately I couldn't. After this experience I don't plan on ever coming back and do not recommend others to eating here.  The wait wasn't too bad for being Saturday. So we were seated fairly fast. Our waitress was ok nothing spectacular and after how everything ended she was mediocre.   So I will make my complaint and horrible experience simple. I ordered the salmon and eggs (grilled)  *While waiting I prepared my coffee- and the cup had lip stick marks- mind you I'm not wearing any lipstick!  G R O S S!!!******  *Now when the waitress comes with my dish she drops off a 'blackened' Salmon, I have to literally call her back to ask if my salmon was grilled or just burned.  *She looks at the ticket and says oh I did put in 'grilled' not sure why they gave you blackened   -Then an older lady appears at our table and asks me if I want to eat the rest of my side dishes while I wait, I responded  \"no, I will wait\"- (at this point i am pissed because she plans on serving me cold food)-  ******Now here's the best part, I finally get my order and the salmon is served grilled-----but it's RAW!  Oh man, at this point I can't take it! I call back the waitress and tell her the food is RAW and at this point I lost my appetite- I would like to cancel my order, I am no longer hungry. She quickly grabs my plate before I could capture the lovely experience!   A good 10mins pass and no manager comes by to check on us or ask me the generic question-what can I do to make your experience better?  They literally do not give a SH*T  So when the waitress comes back to the table I get no acknowledgement. NO ounce of remorse or any apologies, call me old school but I expect more from a hospitality establishment.    -So I ask her do you guys actually care about customers you gave me a dirty coffee mug, wrong food, and raw food. Where is your manager at?  Usually they come talk to the table! She looked at me as if I was schooling her on something new.  At this point she Finally goes and tells the manager to come to our table or remind her!!!!   So here's the THE BEST PART, she sends over one of her minions to act as the manager (what manager is dressed with an apron and sous chef gloves on) She didn't want to OWN the mistakes sends over an employee acting as the manger! WTF!!!  This guy clearly doesn't know the first thing about handling customer situations, all he does is say sorry, and pretends to show any interest-  He literally says- we tried to bring your food out as fast as we could!  Oh man! I couldn't help but complain about the lack of and the experience, that it did no good or justice to my situation.  I clearly will not be back, or will I recommend this restaurant to anyone else. Maybe I am over reacting but, I am HANGRY. I haven't eaten breakfast or lunch and I am running on air!  But I don't plan on coming back- the last straw, was when the manager didn't want to come to my table to apologies for my horrible experience, she sends over someone pretending to be one."}
{"text":"I ordered from here today. My order was for the Hawaiian breakfast. On the comments section, I wrote \"Can you please substitute macaroni salad for rice please?\" Only because I'm allergic to mayonnaise. When my order came it had macaroni salad all over the plate with my 2 sunny side eggs over it with the meat on the side. I ordered through a third party that delivers for this restaurant, so the customer service girl spoke on behalf of me. They told her it's confusing and could go either way. I told her it's not confusing to me, I simply asked to substitute macaroni salad for rice. What they gave me was substitute rice for macaroni salad. Was I wrong?"}
{"text":"Spotted this new place on the way to Panera. What a great surprise. Contemporary decor, friendly service, great options for breakfast, brunch or lunch. Specials are listed on a chalkboard giving it a homey feel. Light nice music could be heard through their sound system adding to a very relaxing atmosphere where one can talk and hear!  Ordered scrambled eggs with lox and onions, served with lettuce, tomatoes, capers. Dish included a side of hash browns, served with a toasted bagel and cream cheese. Friend ordered cheese omelette with corned beef and hash served with fruit (instead of toast). Both dishes were delicious. Person next to us ordered the special...one of Peg's Glorifed Skillet dishes, served with warm tortillas. It was her second visit this week.  We have a lot of new choices for breakfast/lunch in Henderson now. I hope this one stays around."}
{"text":"I haven't been to this Peg's yet, but I'm writing a review, preemptively, because I know it will be just as delicious and wholesome as the other Peg's locations in Reno. For those of you who have yet to experience Peg's, I am envious of you. The first experience at Peg's is one to stow away for the long-run, as it is a truly memorable experience. I say this not as a biased patron, but as a humanitarian who strives to deliver messages of health and happiness through oral ecstasy."}
{"text":"Our new favorite breakfast place!  Service was great and the food was outstanding.  Way exceeded our expectations!  We were promptly greeted and seated and our waitress was bubbly and took good care of us.  Tried the Sierra omelette and the huevous rancheros.  Next time we'll try something sweet!"}
{"text":"The staff was so friendly and gave exceptional service. I enjoyed the food as well, but the service is what prompt me to write this review. They did not let a person walk in or leave without being acknowledged. Very welcoming!"}
{"text":"Had a lovely little breakfast at Peg's Saturday morning. It was busy and we have two small children so we opted to sit on the patio. It was very nice experience. The service was pretty good and they brought out crayons and paper for my almost 3 year old to color on.   My hubs ordered the French toast with eggs and bacon and was pleasantly surprised by the portion sizes. His French toast was yummy (I nabbed a bite!). I ordered the Peg's Omelet with ham and hash browns. Mine was good though being honest I've had better.   Overall a nice morning out.   (We we're under red umbrellas thus the tint in the pics)"}
{"text":"We stopped in today and were so happy we did! The food was delicious, the portions LARGE! Gaby, our server was sweet and she really knows the menu. Everyone was warm and welcoming. Stop in soon, you will not be disappointed. They are a great addition to Henderson."}
{"text":"Place is great! Good service, big portions, cool decor. Get there early on weekends because it gets packed around 10a!"}
{"text":"Everything was perfect!! Staff is friendly and efficient BUT the food is amazing!! Thanks for a great breakfast"}
{"text":"I am a server, and today I broke every rule and showed up right at closing to Peg's. I really wanted to leave, but the host assured me it was all good and to come in. They said another couple had just sat down too, no worries! I am so grateful to Peg's for feeding two hungry souls after a long morning! Their food is amazing, and their service is too. :)"}
{"text":"I usually don't review because food is most times, just that. But this place deserves a plug because it's awesome. Everyone is friendly and unpretentious, the food simply amazing, and the service and restaurant quick and clean. I had the huevos rancheros dish and it may have possibly been the best breakfast I've ever had. The presentation was beautiful, the portion perfect, and the accompaniments thoughtfully designed. The coffee was at first quite strong (tastes like Bustelo) but I downed 2.5 cups. I sat at the counter and the manager Cordell  (?) was super friendly and prompt with refills. If u live in vegas u MUST try this place. Many hopes that this place kills it in henderson!"}
{"text":"Second visit and it's official: they have the best omelets in town, I wish I would have taken a picture, they are very fluffy like they must whip the eggs before cooking. Great ingredients options too.  Their ranchero sauce was tasty so I'm definitely going to try the huevos rancheros on my next visit."}
{"text":"Our large party of 12 arrived after a week long multi-family vacation! Busy Saturday - staff were amazing. Welcomed us - seated us within 20min & EVERYONE'S meal arrived, as ordered, and HOT! Cordell was our server. He was GREAT! We come annually to visit and will definitely be back! Thanks everyone!"}
{"text":"I ordered the chili rellenos, it was very good and a cute presentation served in a skillet"}
{"text":"Even though it was lunch hour I had a craving for breakfast. Ordered country fried steak and eggs and the wife had pancakes with a sausage patty. Everything was very tasty and portions were very generous. Owners Jewel and David chatted with us a bit and we were glad they brought their Reno based charm and hospitality to the local area. This American diner is a safe bet in Vegas/Henderson for good food and good value.  Will have to try the Hawaiian, Mexican and New York dishes next time!"}
{"text":"Tried twice & was really disappointed. Just up the street (Eastern) EGG WORKS is FAR SUPERIOR for breakfast/lunch foods."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about Peg's in general. This was one of my favorite places up in Reno, and I was thrilled that they were opening a location in Southern Nevada. The food is just as wonderful and the staff just as friendly!"}
{"text":"Sooooooo, happy they've come to Henderson!!! I discovered Peg's during a trip to Reno several years ago and visit them still whenever I'm there. This is their first week here, and I have to say it's consistent with the Reno restaurant's great menu and fantastic staff. The real attraction for me is their Hawaiian breakfast menu which includes traditional eggs, meats and sauces with white rice. Yes, it includes Spam, Portuguese sausage and Loco Moco an island favorite. I'm sad that once they're discovered by the masses, there will be a wait to get in just like in Reno. For sure they're gonna need to expand sooner than later! Welcome, Peg's!"}
{"text":"This is my first time trying this amazing place ,I'm not a big breakfast  person but people talk so much about this place that I had to try it, I order the altogether sandwich and it was delicious  and my coffee too, now I can't wait to try my next breakfast at Peg's Glorified Han n Eggs!"}
{"text":"So this is my third visit in a short time, but the food is that good!  The food is delicious, generously portioned and unique recipes. For example:  you can get skillets with hash browns, pick, beans and tortillas; there are 7 different types of Benedict's; aloha options and lighter choices right on the menu!!!!  My current favorite is the sausage gravy with chicken fried steak or biscuits. The gravy is amazing and the biscuits light and fluffy. I have never been disappointed. Only one location in Henderson but worth the drive. Another great local place."}
{"text":"AWSOME AWSOME!!!!! Great food, all great service and never a wait. I absolutely love this restaurant not only are they one of the best breakfast places up here in the Henderson area but they have great service good prices always satisfied, big portions.  they take good care of you! try it out it's really really good! ask for Kimora she rocks it!"}
{"text":"So glad that Peg's decided to come to Vegas, we have been enjoying Peg's in Reno for years.  The food is delicious, service is wonderful and fast.  Their biscuits and gravy is to die for.  Their portions are large so remember that when ordering.  They had a prime rib special last time I was in there and it was remarkable."}
{"text":"I'm not a breakfast person but the corned beef hash left me extremely satisfied. The portion was quite generous. The flavors were amazing. One thing I would do differently is possibly substitute the hash browns or toast. Service is good. My coffee was always full. We'll be coming back"}
{"text":"My husband and have been wanting to try this place and we finally were able to. It's so yummy and the staff is amazing."}
{"text":"We came here a couple weeks back... And it felt like a good vibe, great service, great food....  Went there today 3/26/2018...  Worst service EVER!!!!!! first off... Yea i have a big family.. So we ordered for our kids first, then when all the kids were taken cared of with drinks and food... we decided to order....    25 minutes went by... And everyone in there was just cleaning, and no one was cooking...... I looked at my wife and said.....ummm maybe they ordered take out for our food and said itkind of loud.....  35 minutes in.. Server didnt check up on us or anything.... And when he looked over he noticed we didnt have food... I saw him inputting it in on POS quickly so he could get it ordered....... Ugh yeah fuck that... Told wife cancel order. And get Check please. And straight bounced out of that place quick...   To the server... Here is a peice of advice and tip since we didn't leave anything.... Check with your tables from time to time\" ask \"hows the food\", \"need any water?\"... We literally had to flag your ass down for more juice and napkins... And don't blame the POS. for not inputting your order... worst part it wasnt even that busy!!!!!!!!!..... Now because of you, we will never go there again!!!!!! Fricken sad....."}
{"text":"This place has huge portions, waiting in line is worth it. Loco moco is Great and the eggs Benedict is awesome! Staff are great and the food comes out quickly."}
{"text":"Decided to come here at spur of the moment for the first time. The service was really good. I was seated immediately and everyone was pleasant. I decided to go with the country fried steak and was not disappointed. The portions were good sized. The food was delicious. I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Only been open two weeks, was busy so we sat at the counter... great service, delicious food. Sitting at the counter was great as got to preview all the food going out so could pick food for future visits. Food was hot, fresh and delicious. Will definitely be back and highly recommend."}
{"text":"Hello and welcome to Peg's Glorified Ham n Eggs. I had once ate at the northern Nevada and now that they are in Henderson, I had to go. How to describe peg's...comfy little Diner with a homey feel. We arrived on  Wednesday morning and this place was quite busy. We were sat at one of the last tables and were asked dink order right away. (YAY!!!!) The menu is not too over run with too many items. Bonus was the HawaII side of the Menu Loco Moco, Spam and Eggs, and various dishes adding White rice. My wife having a Chomoro background, I have learned to appreciate the Island Flavors. I actually had the Chicken Fried steak however. Because as you may know by now that is what I judge a good breakfast place on. If you can't make a simple gravy then Its' hard to rate you. Josie had the 3 Piece French toast. This is where our meal took a small left turn. We had a good seat where I could see the pass and see the food get expedited. I was watching meals come out when the table behind ours received theirs. One which had an order of pancakes. I watched my order start to die under the heat lamp while our order waited for the french toast. Our order arrives soon after but only has two slices of the french toast. (Is there not enough room on grill for three pieces). My Chicken fried steak was good but The gravy had broke a little but still had flavor and was still hot. I had also ordered toast which never arrived. My CFS was good had chunks of sausage and the add a sprinkle of Paprika on top just before serving. I thought that was a nice touch. The meat was tender and could be cut with a fork. Josie's French toast was thick and had a hint of Cinnamon and Nut Meg. Why we waited for the 3rd slice I will never understand. I did notice the the grill is not large and maybe with how busy it was there was not room to cook our food all at the same time. Or maybe complete my order before the order received after ours. Thank you for dining at Peg's. We will return. We liked the vibe and the Menu. Even with the snafu with the FT it was a good experience. The staff was friendly and quick on the spot with drinks. They were also apologetic about the FT. They are located in busy part of Henderson, but was easy to find and get to. Check them out. Especially if maybe you like some island flair."}
{"text":"My wife and I were curious and eager to try Peg's as a welcome addition to the many choices on Eastern Ave for breakfast. They have only been open for 4 days but they definitely have their act together. Friendly greetings as we entered and attentive servers. Nice choices on the menu along with daily specials too. Kudos to Gabriela our waitress who was pleasant and on top of things. Welcome to the neighborhood and GOOD LUCK"}
{"text":"A neat energetic little place for breakfast and lunch. Nice menu friendly staff and decent pricing.  Good choice of Hawaiian inspired dishes. Not very large but accommodating and can get a little busy at times. Worth a try if you're around."}
{"text":"I don't know what the hype is all about at this place? Came in on a Friday for brunch and first off, our server was just a tad bit annoying. She came off as tense and overwhelmed, and portrayed herself as being busy but really, she just kept forgetting to come back with the things we requested or the things she'd say she would come back with. My son and I usually share and she was the very one to say she'll come back with a plate. A little after five minutes of our food coming to our table, she still never came back with the plate. It was one of those moments where you had to be there to see the annoyance of the server. We ordered the Corned Beef hash, Traditional Benedict, the Hawaiian breakfast, and the Belgian waffles with strawberries. We've had better but the Belgian waffles stood out. The portions were huge but the food wasn't up to par to my brunch loving self."}
{"text":"Waffles were yummy and the Portuguese sausage in the Hawaiian breakfast was GOOD! Sat at the counter and had an eyeful of the kitchen. Dang they're busy but efficient and in such a small workspace."}
{"text":"Had to see what all the hype was about and Peg's did not disappoint.  This place is always busy so be prepared to wait. Service is good and super friendly.  Ordered the huevos rancheros, bc how can you not with all the reviews and pictures of their signature dish.  First off, the dish is huge.  I mean BIG.  So be prepared.  This dish did not disappoint.  The eggs were cooked perfect.  Cucumber pico de Gallo was fresh.  Everything was so tasty.   Mini ordered the Belgium waffle, huge.  But it was a little dry.  But the toppings made up for it.  One huge downfall was the fresh squeezed orange juice.  Love the thoughtfulness but way way too much pulp.  You could barely drink it with a straw bc there was so much pulp.  Not a fan.  But that's not enough for me not to go back to this gem.  Thank you peg for bringing something different to the valley."}
{"text":"Awesome food and great service! Must try the skillet breakfasts!! The interior is a huge improvement over the previous tenants. Their coffee is good and sting as well. A must try!!"}
{"text":"Brought the family here for a late breakfast. Quick, friendly service with sizeable portions. I had the Hawaiian breakfast and it was fantastic (eggs, rice, Portuguese Sausage, Spam).   We will be back."}
{"text":"We've eaten at Peg's in Reno several times.  (I reviewed once).  So glad to have a location in Las Vegas.  The food and menu are the same, which is to say delicious!  We went when they were open for less than a month, and surprisingly didn't see many missing beats.  Seated quickly with menus and drinks arrived timely.  It was early on a Sunday morning and they could have used one more server, but the server helping us was really moving an putting forth effort.  We'll be back often."}
{"text":"Delicious!!! Did the happy dance while eating my Hawaiian Breakfast plate!!!! Ono food, great service! Will be going again!!"}
{"text":"Unbelievably good. Portions are huge. Every thing is fresh and Homemade. Service was amazing even when it was busy busy busy. Bacon lovers you gotta check this place out. We had the Tamale skillet and I could drink the sauce they put on top. So good."}
{"text":"Cute little place with a very cool restaurant name :) they have a nice stream of staff members so even though it was busy with a line out the door, they still manage to get our food out in a timely manner. I really appreciated that since morning breakfast joints are usually excused for their lengthy wait time on the food so long as the coffee keeps getting refilled. We ordered the Hawaiian breakfast with spam and saugage, corned beef hash, vegetarian burrito and the Benedict. Everyone was satisfied and happy with their meals. The portion were a little outrageous and I think I have left over for two days. Overall a good experience."}
{"text":"First timer and it was delicious! They have a vegan skillet for any plant based folks and it was delicious. It's basically a ton of hash browns and pinto beans with their cabbage slaw and salsa. Simple but when you mix it all together it's delicious and tastes really fresh. Also their side of fresh fruit actually tasted fresh and had a variety of fruits. My boyfriend got the huevos rancheros skillet which he said was also tasty! Coffee was good, service was nice, and the restaurant itself is open and really clean feeling. Definitely returning."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this restaurant since it opened last year and it is awesome! It brings homestyle mom and pop style cooking to a town that is flush with stamped brands of fast food and restaurant options.   The owners believe in quality over quantity which keeps the food tasting great. This restaurant mixes things up with their daily specials and are always open to talk about making dishes even better.  On top of the quality menu dishes they provide they work to hire and retain some of the best restaurant staff I have seen for this size restaurant. The restaurants manger Cordell is amazing. He aways works to improve the service every time I have visited and pushes all around him to have the same level of service. I have seen him work in all areas of the restaurant and he never acts that what he is doing is beneath him.   A special thank you to the owners Jewel and Dave for bringing Pegs to the valley and in finding employees like Cordell and helping them find and build their place in this world. All of your staff deserve my thanks!   Thank you!  Tom M"}
{"text":"Ok...by the time I decide to take a picture of my food to post I have already inhaled it!!! :) I have been 2 times and each time I have ordered the chilie relleno breakfast platter. It has 2 eggs, hash browns, these incredible beans, and a chilie relleno that is wrapped in an egg mixture(not your typical batter) and this Pico De Gallo that is packed full of cucumber pieces...I spent about 10mins trying to dissect it to see what all was added because it was AMAZING!!! from what I could see it was tomatoe, jalapeño, cucumber, shredded carrots, black beans, corn, olive oil, pepper, and citrus of some sort either lemon or lime...and I am sure I am missing quit a few other ingredients...but it was delicious! The chilie relleno wrapped in the egg mixture was delicious, plenty of cheese and the chilie itself was cooked to tenderness perfection. The beans are pinto beans but are seasoned perfectly, a great pepper flavor.  My man had the chicken fried steak and eggs. He said the gravy was delicious and he is EXTRMELY picky about gravy but he said the chicken fried steak was something he would not order again. But everything else was perfect.  The service is fantastic. It is a very busy spot so you may have to wait for a seat but it is definitely worth the wait. We love to find great breakfast places and this is up there in the Top 3. We will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Great, Delicious, Tasty!!!! Nice portions, you won't go hungry. I tried the Sierra Omelet and my boyfriend the Breakfast Burrito very good. Our plates included the best cole slaw I have ever tasted plus crispy hash browns. Definitely worth the wait!!!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a quick place to grab a yummy bite after a nearby appointment with my 2 year old.   This place had great options for food, kid friendly and fast! It was a cozy (small, but not too cramped) clean and they must have seen the slightly stressed look on my face because I've never gotten coffee so fast. Which I appreciated. The staff was friendly and helpful.   I had a traditional eggs benedict (my usual at new places) and my kiddo had french toast. Both were delicious.   I did not use the restroom so I don't know if they had a changing table or can judge cleanliness, but the location is newer so I doubt it would be sub-par."}
{"text":"Another fabulous breakfast at Peg's. Best biscuit and gravy in town. Afton was very attentive, friendly and knew the menu well. Our coffee cup was always full. Excellent corned beef hash. This is our favorite place for breakfast and Afton is our new favorite server!!"}
{"text":"We were encouraged by the crowd, but unfortunately it was disappointing.  We were seated promptly enough, but waited five minutes for someone to realize we had no coffee or  water. We immediately placed our order while we had the waitresses' attention.  It was 25 minutes later that we were served a cold waffle and \"heat lamp\" bacon.  My Husband's meal was warm so that's why I gave two stars rather than one.  With the food's flavor being nothing special and the service being average, we won't be back."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Peg's in Roseville CA, and Reno NV. And this Peg's in Henderson is my favorite of all. Very clean, friendly, and super delicious. I had the steak and eggs with a pancake and it was delicious. Well cooked and served hot. Definitely a place to go to with family and friends."}
{"text":"Our Saturday morning breakfast date. Love the food and the service. Go early because they get very busy. Ari is the best...she always has a smile and goes out of her way to make sure we're satisfied. Highly recommend Peg's!!"}
{"text":"Ugh! I love this place. Awesome food! Big serving, delicious, and presentation is on point as well. Very friendly and welcoming staff."}
{"text":"What a great find.  I loved this place.  Can't wait to go back.  Eggs benny and pancakes (cause I couldn't decide). Both were awesome.  The orange juice is super delicious; nice and sweet and tasted fresh squeezed.  Service was friendly and prompt.  See you there!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast! The tamale and egg skillet was out of this world! Such great flavoring and perfect portion size. Service was speedy and the restaurant was clean. Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Yes, I've only been to this location once but I knew it was five stars before I arrived.  My fiancé and I have visited one of the Reno locations before this so we knew that we were in for some delicious breakfast grub as well as fabulous service. We got both of those here and Peg's is a welcome addition to the plethora of breakfast options on Eastern Avenue. I love tamales so having one for breakfast made me and my tummy very happy ;) I had the Tamale and Eggs, which is a chicken tamale topped with ranchero sauce served with two eggs, hash browns, pico de gallo, cabbage slaw, and pinto beans: delicious!  It's a very generous platter, too, so I didn't finish all the sides that came with it, but the tamale was fresh and the hash browns were nice and crispy just like I requested. There are many tasty options on the menu including the Hawaiian Breakfast with Portuguese sausage, Spam, eggs, and rice that my soon-to-be sister-in-law had as well as the Meat Lover's Omelette with sausage, diced ham, bacon, jack and cheddar that Mel ordered. We also shared a half order of the Biscuits & Gravy which was quite fabulous; I loved the savory gravy on it. Other menu items available are many varieties of egg Benedicts, omelettes, skillets, scrambles as well as pancakes, French Toast, sandwiches, and burgers. I recommend a visit here if you love breakfast as much as we do.  Review #100 for 2017"}
{"text":"Food:  - Club sandwich no ham and requested that instead of a triple decker just make it a regular sandwich with fresh fruit - bacon and eggs with hash browns - super fresh squeezed OJ.  Everything tasted super fresh and crispy. The fresh fruit really was fresh unlike the fruit I've had at other breakfast places. Really enjoyed it here!  Service: they were very busy as we were there at prime time Sunday brunch but we got seated right away for outdoor seating under the umbrella and our waters were refilled twice.   Ambiance: cozy and casual. I really enjoyed the outdoor patio. It's dog friendly!!  Location: in the plaza behind Panera Bread.   We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Always went to Peg's in Reno when I went to UNR and was excited when I saw the Peg's sign go up a few months ago, and thought this day would never come.  I was never disappointed with the Country Fried Steak back in Reno, and my very first bite brought back memories. It was just as massive and delicious as I remembered.   Vegas residents need some Peg's in their life, and this is a great place to start. Will be back on my next cheat day... or week."}
{"text":"We were pleasantly surprised. This is a nice place. The food is really good and the portions are large. The sausage was tasty the ham was excellent and the hash browns were perfect. The service was a little slow but they were really busy so that was understandable.  The waiting staff was very friendly and our drinks were never empty. The grits were good but I am not a grits expert so I cannot tell you how good they were. I do know we will go back. Bianca was our waitress and I would ask for her."}
{"text":"I've been waiting years for a Peg's to come to the Vegas area and finally, my dreams have come true! Mostly.    The atmosphere is a slightly more modern looking Pegs but still has that diner feeling to it. The staff was friendly and the place was clean.  Our table ordered the smoked salmon benedict, huevos rancheros, and loco moco. Each dish was a large portion for a decent price and even better, tastes exactly like the original Peg's I fell in love with.   The only down side? They don't offer my favorite dish, the crab cake benedict. :(  Peg's has been my favorite breakfast place since I was a kid and this one is as good as I remember. If you get a chance and don't mind a little bit of a wait, head down and try a Reno favorite, now in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Had the Teriyaki Chicken breakfast plate and was extremely satisfied with the portions and it tasted great. The service was exceptional as well. Definitely recommending this spot"}
{"text":"The food is good. They give a lot of bacon which is good (or because we were there an hour or so before they close). But the Belgian Waffle and their hash brown are reaaaaally good! The Belgian Waffle's sweetness is perfect.  The service is good too, but a bit slow. She forgot my tortilla (which was supposedly goes with my meal) and didn't bring the extra plate til we're halfway through our meal. But she's nice enough (nicer if you're older) We'll be back"}
{"text":"When my husband and I dined at Pegs glorified ham and eggs up in Reno I found the food to be quite delicious however on my visit here in Henderson my ham was cold, my bananas were mushy not caramelized and they never came by and asked us if we wanted any more toast.  We are going to give this location another shot because we feel that maybe they were just having a bad morning but if my next experience is the same we will cut this restaurant out."}
{"text":"Great food! Great service!! Gabriela was awesome and always checked up on us!! Definitely coming back here!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. Breakfast is awesome. They have grits! Staff is amazing and they keep your glass full of coffee and water."}
{"text":"Wifey and I came here after doing some research on yelp.   And, thank you yelp... you got it right again!   Wifey had an omelet and grits, I had country fried steak and eggs.   It was all super delicious.    The place was hopping, but the staff there was super friendly and really great.  They were really hustling.     If you are in the mood for a good breakfast that will get you a good start to your day, Peg's is a great choice!   All the folks working there were super friendly, it's a great way to start the day.     Will we be back?   Sure thing, that's some good food."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for breakfast and seriously was the best experience! Everyone was extremely nice and the food blew us away! Came out fast and extremely delicious. Oh and the caramel bananas were bomb.com"}
{"text":"Omg. Best place I've ate in reno, I've tried biscuit and gravy all across the u.s. and hands down I have finally found a place that beats the airport mom and pops place. Hats off to pegs"}
{"text":"This cute little breakfast and lunch spot offers up great food and service! Newly opened on Eastern near Lone Road they are open 7 days a week from 630 AM to 200 PM. Peg's has been in the Reno area since 1999 and this is their first location in southern Nevada.   We stopped in for breakfast on a Sunday and although they were very busy we were seated quickly. There is a mix of booths and tables with an open kitchen in the back. The menu is full of all the breakfast favorites: Egg dishes, skillets, omelettes, pancakes, waffles and benedicts as well as some Hawaiian offerings like loco moco and spam & eggs.   Our server was over quickly to offer us coffee and drinks. For breakfast we chose the traditional benedict and the turkey patty & eggs plate with cinnamon apples. We both really enjoyed our choices. The benedict was served with a  large helping of crispy hash browns and the poached eggs were cooked absolutely perfectly. The turkey patty was far better than expected. Although it was thick it was moist and flavorful and not the least bit dry. The warm cinnamon apples were delicious, soft and full of cinnamon flavor.   I can't wait to come back for lunch. The two current lunch specials sounded wonderful; Teriyaki short ribs and a prime rib philly...mmmm. So happy to have Peg's open here in Henderson and look forward to returning soon!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were looking for a breakfast place on Yelp and saw that this place was pretty new with great reviews. We gave it a try and were not disappointed!!!! I had the veggie Benedict which was absolutely delicious.. only bad thing about my meal is I wish that the onions were more grilled/caramelized. But delicious none the less. Portions are huge!! And service was quick and sweet. Definitely will be coming here again!! One more thing I recommend actually is their freshly squeezed orange juice, way too good for words."}
{"text":"Late breakfast, only 10 minute wait but well worth it.  Wife and I didn't want long wait so we sat at the counter.  A joy to watch the kitchen at work.   Service was great. Food was fantastic.  Hash browns are the best."}
{"text":"Hits the spot, hungover or not. It's really good food, the kind you should drive across town at least once for. Even the toast is tasty. Service is friendly. Restaurant has a retro yet modern feel. Portions are enormous, everything made to order, really fresh. A menu that everyone can find at least one thing they would like off it. I didn't want the vegan skillet to end and it was plated so good, you don't know where to start. There's biscuits and gravy, hash browns, cut fruit, all the comfort foods but some lighter options as well. I would absolutely return.  I only docked a star because one of the super friendly employees who worked the kitchen line liked to help his wait staff by picking up the money off the table - with his food gloves on. Take 'em off dude! This is Vegas and I can assure you that $5 has seen the inside of a strip club before. LOL!"}
{"text":"For just opening a few days ago, I was very impressed with the quality of service! Great food and great tea selection for us tea drinkers!"}
{"text":"We visited this new Henderson spot for breakfast over the weekend and had a pleasant meal. The wait was a little on the long side but tolerable.   Service was a decent. They were busy so food came out a little sporadically. Everyone at my table received their food a food 10 minutes before I got mine so I had to play catch up. They ran out of clean cups so they had to bring out our drinks in styrofoam cups instead.  The food was good and we enjoyed our meals. They're relatively new to this location so I'm sure they'll work out all the kinks soon."}
