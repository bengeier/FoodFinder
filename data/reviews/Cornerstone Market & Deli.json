{"text":"Nice local market. The deli is fantastic and the fresh produce can't be beat!  Nick is a terrific guy and it's nice to support a local business and get great value in return!"}
{"text":"Great place but unfortunately burned down not too long ago. Hopefully they get back on their feet soon."}
{"text":"Excellent service and best deli and produce...glad they are here for my grocery needs!!"}
{"text":"The best market around! They always have your everyday items and the not so everyday finds like ghost pepper cheese or beet hummus."}
{"text":"They have great desserts, Deli meat/cheeses, cheap fruits and vegetables, exotic produce sometimes.  The staff is always very nice."}
{"text":"This place is a gem...I was so glad they reopened after the fire...but I feared new place would mean the charm would be lost.  Thankfully the new building didn't mean losing that charm at all.   The staff is always so pleasant...it is like every customer is family.  The prices in the deli are great and the quality even better.  Same with the produce.  Try the mini strawberries. I have never found these anywhere else and they are so sweet.  This is typically my experience, I find things I do not see elsewhere.    Check out their facebook page for weekly deals."}
{"text":"As a recent transplant from San Francisco, California, I highly recommend this store. Not only I can now rely to get local produce from this farm. I can also maintain the same healthy lifestyle as I used to have back home, instead of relying on getting produce from Walmart or Dave's grocery store.   As you walk into this store, you're greeted by many rows of fresh fruits and vegetable that is undoubtedly much better quality than the ones in Walmart or nearby grocery store. Ever since I moved to Akron, OH, it has been quite hard to get the right produce at the right price and quality. Of course, this store offers high quality produce at a very reasonable price.   I also notice that they got the entire deli selection such as turkey, ham, salami, and an entire rack full of Italian seasonings and let's not forget our primary source of canned plum tomatoes from Italy!! They also sell shredded or grated Parmesan cheese, although I prefer to have it whole, I don't mind paying extra if it's the same quality.  After frantically looking for a good local grocery store, I finally rest assured that I can entertain my guest with my amazing culinary skills and of course, fresh & local produce from this store.   I am looking forward to another day shopping at this store!! Wooo..hooo.. I'm so IN  LOVE with Akron, OH now because of this store! =)"}
{"text":"I like the selection of produce at Cornerstone quite a bit. Their staff is friendly and the music is a good while shopping. Would recommend to others."}
{"text":"Great fresh foods at very reasonable prices. Always friendly service. Very clean establishment, and locally owned."}
{"text":"Love the prices! Fresh produce and good assortment. Love the addition of the deli counter"}
{"text":"I figure that the new digs deserve a new review.  My husband and I just visited the new market last weekend... it is bigger and better than the old building!    Yes, the aisles are wider; yes, there is a larger selection; yes, the lighting is better.  The parking lot was jammed, the produce was beautiful and fresh, and the prices were GREAT (big sweet red peppers for 0.99 per lb.)!!    They still have the same varied selection too... Gold N Krisp potato chips in a full-size bag or single-size bag for lunches.  Several choices of onions, garlic, apples, oranges, mushrooms, etc.  We bought some split-top sausage buns to do double-duty at our cookout (we made sausage and hot dogs for Father's Day)... the buns were sensational - fresh and soft and pillowy!    We love, love, LOVE Cornerstone Market!!   It's good to have them back and better than ever!"}
{"text":"Pictures are from the old building that was struck by lightning and burned down... will take new ones when there are less people.  The building is new and the same quality remains with wider isles and more products.  The deli is now part of the main floor and there are more cold cases of cheeses, salads, and grab and go desserts.  There are public bathrooms just past the registers... take a right at the water fountain!  Today was their reopening... they posted on Facebook last night... no other warning... the place was packed! So nice to see do many people come out on mothers day and show them love!"}
{"text":"I love this store!  Its right around the corner from my neighborhood which is great!  I get my fresh vegetables and fruit there. They have yummy chocolate candy that I am hooked on, monster cookies for my husband, a great deli...what more do I need?  Everyone that works there is friendly and helpful.  I moved here last July and so happy I found this store!"}
{"text":"Very fun place to shop. They have a great deli and great staff that are always very helpful. The produce is also amazing. Great prices"}
{"text":"Love going to this market! Even if my wife sends me with a list, I really don't mind. It's great prices on everything and we actually go out of our way to make sure we get our fresh produce here."}
{"text":"Great produce at great prices! Love their bakery products as well as small local business products here."}
{"text":"Nice little old school market! Fresh fresh fresh. Stopped in for a lunch sandwich and the place looks great! Sandwich was really good too!"}
{"text":"Freshest produce at very good prices year round! Some fun, unusual packaged foods can be found here, too. Beautiful, new building with convenient parking."}
{"text":"Shop local!!  Great produce and fruit selection. Not full line grocer so don't expect to get your Lean Cusines here. I'm new here from out of state and just stopped in to look. Spent $50. Great place."}
{"text":"This place has awesome prices and a really good selection of produce. Their potatoes are always cheaper than everywhere else and they have fruits and herbs that are hard to find elsewhere."}
{"text":"There's nothing more inviting than walking into a store and being consumed by the delicious smells of fresh produce. I have yet to visit any other store whose fruits & veggies are as clean, colorful and at such a great value!  They have some unique juice flavors for only .99 cents a carton! Their scones (which are hard to find), especially the lemon poppy seed are worth the trip alone. Although the deli's salad selection could use a little more variety, the store is always clean and uncluttered.  Some of the female staff members aren't very polite and their plants are way over priced (hence the 4 stars); otherwise a great local business worth supporting!"}
