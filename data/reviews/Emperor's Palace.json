{"text":"Not very good the waiter kept insisting to order more food than we came for even after we told them no thanks and are in the middle of eating but the food was good came for soup dumplings could be bigger as a real one but it was only 3.25 and a beautiful restaurant"}
{"text":"Tonight, myself and a friend went to this new restaurant in what used to be the old Chinatown. We were curious what the restaurant was like and if this new Chinatown could succeed. First of all, before you even walk in the place, there is street parking(which should be no surprise) and actual off street parking within 100 feet of this establishment. Also before you go inside notice the themed decor on the outside of the buildings including on the windows of the second floor. Walking inside, you are greeted with a host and very beautiful inner decor including goldlike trim and chandeliers. We were seated quickly and with friendly welcome of the host. 

The menu is gigantic to say the least. You might think with this large of a menu, food quality might suffer. 

They serve standard Chinese cuisine from various parts of China and Americanized Chinese as well as northern Chinese. They even serve eel, congee, duck, and frog. They also seemingly have a decent selection of vegetarian options.  In addition to all that they have dim sum choices too. 

The staff is first and second generation Chinese so their English is ok but be patient with them. 

My friend and I ordered fried dumplings, pork chow mein, and a Yu Shiang pork entree. They were served in family style with a plate for each of us to dish out what we wanted. The Yu Shiang pork was delicious and had some heat to it but not overwhelming. It was served in a spicy sauce with vegetables and rice in a separate bowl. The pork chow mein was standard and you get a large portion. The fried dumplings were fantastic and came with a salty savory sauce. 

Overall this restaurant is a great addition to the near East side and worth checking out. 

They also have a lot of dining space and a banquet room so in case you are thinking of somewhere for a group of people to gather and celebrate a special occasion. 

Please check out."}
{"text":"Very very good! Ordered delivery since it was cold. I had Shanghai bok choy with garlic, Sichuan beef very spicy, whole crispy duck, happy family and pineapple buns. Did I mention it was very good? Since I'm from Philly and moved here, I needed real Chinese food and this is just wonderful! The sichuan beef was very good  to my liking and the spiciness was just right, it was hot not medium but hot! The crispy duck was not dry and it had meat! I think the duck was better than Sang Kee in Philly. The delivery guy was very kind and delivered food to my door. Reading from other reviews, I guess it just all depends on luck!"}
{"text":"What a gem in Cleveland! The sesame ball and the egg tarts are some of the best that we have had. Considering that we have had dim sum in Chicago, LA, HK and Singapore, this was really a nice surprise. 

The crullers in rice crepe was also delicious! It's a Cantonese-style dish and not easily found in most dim sum places nowadays. The crullers were crispy with a thin layer of rice crepe. 

The dim sum all tasted very fresh. The portions plentiful and price was reasonable. The staff were very friendly too. 

We were there in the morning and didn't really feel like we were in a bad neighborhood as others have mentioned. And we liked that there was plenty of parking across the street from the restaurant."}
{"text":"Friendly service over the phone and delivery (delivery service to Tremont was the main reason we gave this place a try). On top of that taking over an hour when told forty minutes, nothing was well, good.  I ordered the orange chicken and requested that it be generously spicy.  It was mild at best. Flavor was ok,  however it was so overcooked it ruined any goodness there may have been.  I also got the veggie fried rice and chuckled when I thought about salting my Chinese food.... super bland. My BF got the Kung pao chicken and same thing... dry and overcooked.  Pretty sure we didn't keep this menu."}
{"text":"My family and I came to CLE for a visit and we were craving Chinese food so we decided to give this place a try. We're from NY so we know what good Chinese food taste like besides Chinese food in China but wow this place is amazing! When we told our waitress that we wanted dim sum she told us that dim sum would take a while because it is all made when we order. It reminded me of Nom Wah Tea Parlor, a NY dim sum restaurant that serves everything fresh. So we ordered pineapple buns, shrimp dumplings, pork buns, sao mai, congee with preserved eggs and pork, sponge cakes, egg tarts, and chicken feet. It was all so good, we had to reorder the dishes! We were recommended the general tso chicken and the pepper steak by the waitress and I would have to say not only was the portion HUGE but it was DELICIOUS. If I ever visit CLE, I would definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"Food is good but service is bad. They serve fresh dim sum but we waited a long time for our food. The wait staff was overworked and disorganized. They did not have enough high chairs or booster seats for our kids."}
{"text":"I relocated to Cleveland and have been trying to get a feel of the restaurants that will deliver to my place. I found this restaurant on GH and from the rating thought it was the lesser of the three evils so to speak. I then saw yelp rating and figured, why not? I had only ordered takeout from another place but disliked their portion to price ratio. This place's ratio did not bother me so I thought I'd try it out. 

Well, I must say, big mistake. After struggling to give the clerk/phone operator my number, she could barely get it down. When she mentioned it would a 40 minute wait, I figured it will probably take 50 mins. It took almost an hour and 15-20 minutes. During that wait, I had to call back just to have the same phone operator try to blame it on my number. Turns out I did give her my number and the driver took too long. Very disappointing. 

Now on to the food. I had ordered the sesame chicken dumplings and crab rangoon. The rangoon was just about the only decent part of the meal. The chicken was flavorless, the rice was far from anything to rave about and I approached the dumplings with caution. For the prices they have, I would save my money for a pizza or latin restaurant or walk to another restaurant I might randomly find.

I would only keep their number to place on do not call list. Yikes..."}
{"text":"If we ever get our food, I'll let you know if it is any good. We ordered at 6pm and it's now 8pm. Called the place twice and they offered to do nothing about it."}
{"text":"I truly felt like I was in the Emperor's Palace! The decor of this restaurant is elegant. The food is absolutely delicious. Today I tried pork buns from the Dim Sum menu and crispy duck from the entr√©e menu. The buns were beautifully made and presented and were outstanding in flavor. The duck was beautifully done and tasty. It was served with healthy rice which is white rice mixed with wild rice. The service was friendly and attentive. I came all the way from Chagrin Falls to eat here today and I give it an A-1 + review. I shall return and soon.

{"text":"Service was really good, but the dim sum was mostly just okay. I did love the bbq pork buns, though! And my egg drop soup was so good. It's located in kind of a weird place, so be prepared to parallel park; it sneaks up on you."}
{"text":"Yeah I lived in China and been around different places to experience awesome Chinese food.  For example, Markham, ON's Chinatown and around Louisville, KY area there are awesome Chinese food places. However this place is not the place to go for any type of food. 

Being a relative native of the NEO for years, I was happy and proud to see old Chinatown have a new place but this food was so disappointing.The Atmosphere is pretty tacky old school Chinese but wasn't the worst thing I've seen.  

Food quality reminded me of a cheap attempt of trying traditional Chinese dishes.  The menu really did not have an identity to cling to. Like when people talk about Cantonese, most people understand it encompasses the the traditional 5 spices montra and Szechuan tends for spicy and livelier notes.  The food was to broad ranging in flavors and reminded me of cheap fast Chinese delivery which isn't bad but it isn't good either. Sauces are too thick and flavors blend to blah.  I only had three dishes to check how it was and just like I said, disappointing. 

The service wasn't the greatest but you could tell they were trying their best.  

Overall would go there again if the food quality got better."}
{"text":"Great food, but their on-line delivery service sucks. Never delivered at the time it was promised. This has happened 2xs. There won't be a 3rd.
Person I talked to today was going to do another order for me (they barely speak English there.), & I refused. When I called back to cancel, because I didn't hear back from them, I was told they are on their way, & they hung up on me.
I am less than a mile away from them. And, each time my delivery had been 40+ minutes late. First time was due to their vehicle breaking down. Today...\"they were blocked in\", & it has been over an hour since I was promised my delivery.
Won't be ordering from them again.

Update: 10/24/17
I was craving their food. So, I gave in & ordered delivery. They actually delivered my food ON TIME! Completely ignored my request for a future date / time delivery, but that is NOT A complaint! One day, I will get it timed right. But, in the meantime, increased their rating from 2 stars to 4."}
{"text":"Highly recommend this place if you want to try authentic Chinese food, not American Chinese Food! I just moved to Cleveland this April from China. Looking for great Chinese food is one of my big interest here. However, Yelp rate didn't really help to tell the authentic Chinese food. This restaurant definitely deserves 5 star in terms of food quality! The Dim Sun is so good and reminds my time in Hong Kong. Quality of food is consistent and not using heavy sauces. It is even better that most Chinese Restaurant with higher rate in NYC! I will definitely go to this place on a regular base, and highly recommend it to my home sick Chinese Friends."}
{"text":"The delivery was prompt and the gentleman was very courteous, but the food was a huge disappointment. The shrimp fried rice was incredibly bland and the Malaysian shrimp was very salty and dry--no sauce at all. Wouldn't order from them again."}
{"text":"This restaurant, while showing signs of considerable investment of money, does not live up to its image with quality of food. There are much better Chinese restaurants in Cleveland, henceforth, I will defer to them for my Chinese fix. The front of the house seems eager to please, but one has to ponder what's going on in the kitchen. A gustatory disappointment."}
{"text":"This place is good and cheap. It was like $7 for a humongous plate of delicious eggplant stuff. The menu is huge. The only issue is my guts were not totally happy with me post lunch.

The location is great and strange, close to the Plain Dealer building down Rockwell. Apparently this giant gilded building was the old \"Chinatown.\" Now Emperor's Palace is the only thing there, although there are signs posted saying that \"Chinatown Development\" is up to something. Very very cool location, interesting decor."}
{"text":"I got congee with fish and shredded lettuce ????? and scallion pancake???, both were fresh and delicious. 
Fish congee was thick and delicate, the fish slices were very tender, yummy. 
Scallion pancake was very authentic and not too greasy. 
The place was clean and beautiful, shinny, magnificent. Haha. I like the Chinese zodiacs outside, cute.
The service was great, all the waitresses were friendly and nice, served me fruit after meal, even I just had two dishes, I felt so sweet~"}
{"text":"In a bit of an out-of-the-way spot...but in a beautiful building!  We came on a recent (frigid!) night before a show downtown.  We decided to have both some traditional Chinese fare plus a few Dim Sum items as well.

We started off with hot & sour soup...and although the portion was on the small side it was quite tasty and a good balance of spice and sourness.  The hot tea kept flowing as well!!!

We then moved on to the main dishes.  We shared a General Tso's chicken and three Dim Sum items: steamed pork buns, a tofu wrapped meat dish and finally some shrimp dumplings.  All dishes were tasty and filling, but nothing that blew us away.

For dessert they brought us out a pineapple sticky bun to share, which was top notch!  Overall a very nice meal (and very reasonably priced), but I believe there are plenty of other good Chinese restaurants around the city that eclipse this meal."}
{"text":"I will NOT be returning to this place again. Service was horrible and food was tasteless. There isn't any body coming around with carts of food. About10 minutes wait for a waitress to come take our orders. 10-20 minutes wait for the foods. I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"I gave this place a 5 star due to the fact that they do have a very savory and fresh quality food. So far they're better than the other Chinese places especially with their dim sums (Bo Long).  

I would go here first before I would go anywhere else esp. if I am in the mood for some dim sums."}
{"text":"So we found out about this because of the Cleveland Night Market.  We went back on a regular night.  The inside is fairly authentic.  The service is really great.  The menu will take the normal American a little off guard.  They have most of what one would be normally used to but they they have the truly traditional dishes.  Not quite brave enough just yet but working on it.

The servings are huge, so be careful.  My favorite of the night was crispy garlic beef.  We also had spring rolls and crab Rangoon.  Others had General Taos and an Orange Chicken.  All were fantastic.

So my one really big surprise, the deserts.  They gave us a sampling of an egg tart and some other sponge cake.  They were amazing.  I have had pastries in China towns in NY and Chicago.  Bit pretty much the same and very bland.  These were not.  A must have."}
{"text":"Every single dish we order is better than the previous. The boyf and I are slowly working our way through the menu and thus far, after a handful of dinners, we will never order Chinese from any other place. 
The basil & chicken was perfect...the dumplings, the curry chicken, and as of late, the curry beef. Omg the curry beef. I want to swim in a pool of this curry beef. So perfect, so tender, so delightful. The seafood combination platter is full of chunks of various seafoods, you can distinguish each individual seafood meat even though they are all in the same pile...absolute perfection all around."}
{"text":"This place has terrible service and I don't recommend delivery.  I ordered before and the food never showed up.  We needed to fight them to get our money back.  I gave them another chance and once again our food simply did now show up and the person answering the phone hung up on me when I requested money back.  This is the worst Chinese restaurant I've ever ordered from."}
{"text":"The worst experience I've had at a Chinese restaurant in a long time, perhaps EVER. Too much to say, here are the low points:

Ordered 3 Hot and Sour Soup. Waiter comes back, \"We're out.\" My daughter changes to egg drop soup. Waiter comes back, \"Kitchen too busy to make it. Won Ton soup only\". Felt like Seinfeld. \"NO SOUP FOR YOU!!!\" Really?

Ordered BBQ spare rib appetizer and our four entrees. Pointed to the items on the menu so he could read the names in Chinese. Waiter even said my crispy duck would take a little longer. No problem.

We waited. And waited. AND WAITED. Finally I flag down one employee (manager?) who gets our waiter. By now I'm unhappy. He goes to the kitchen and comes back with......the appetizer? Nooo...... the crispy duck! \"Where's the appetizer?\" He goes back to the kitchen. Out comes the other three entrees. WHERE'S THE APPETIZER?

The duck is too salty and isn't crispy. The spicy beef and the pepper beef both had good flavor but not enough sauce. The only item that passes is the General Tso.

And what about the appetizer? The ribs arrived 10 minutes later. I sent them back.

After all that, all they did was put two sweet dim sum buns on a plate and said \"No charge!\"..... Wow. So generous. 

IF YOU LIKE CHINESE FOOD, GO SOMEWHERE ELSE.

Oh yeah, the chairs are short, flat and hard. Very uncomfortable."}
{"text":"Friendly server but food was just normal. Dim sum wasn't that great, but dishes like vegetable and meat were good. Overall is average and not too expensive."}
{"text":"We had a really bad experience tonight. We waited 2 hours for our food. Once the food came it was good...but the management and servers really handle the situation poorly. The manager told us she was ok if we left. They were not apologetic.  The manager actually said that the \"manager was on vacation\" so she didn't have to solve the problem.  My issue wasn't with the food...it was with the manager and staff failing to apologize and doing something to get us our food."}
{"text":"So I always like to review a place at least twice if the experience is somewhat negative, I'm big on second chances.

My entree was awful. Hot pepper beef and after a few bites I tossed it in the trash. Not spicy after I requested it and the meat was so over cooked you cannot chew it.

Also, this place will never give you any soy sauce packets. Even after I requested some, twice, I received one. One for three ppl. Cheap!

Also I ordered Vegan fried wontons to share with my vegan friend.
They were made with whole SHRIMP inside. I think they need a lesson on what vegan is. 

I likes two things, pineapple buns and scallion pancakes.


This place is a fail."}
{"text":"Lovely decor - very gold... but it gave me such a great flashback to some of the restaurants I've eaten at in China. Great service, although it can get loud at dim sum hour (around 1pm).  

I thought the dim sum was OK, but I do prefer Li Wah's dim sum.  Li Wah tends to serve more dim sum customers, so I think their food tends to be \"fresher\" and there's more variety.  Emperor's unfortunately ran out of congee when we tried to order and there were \"beef crepes\" but not the iconic shrimp ones, for example.  Also, I do like the carts that make their rounds at Li Wah, so it was a different experience without the cart system here.  Given everything is ordered from the menu, everything also comes out together... so some food got cold before I could dig in. The cart system makes it easier to eat as you go and savor everything - but on the flip side, you also tend to miss certain foods by waiting for the carts and overeat in compensation - so pick your battle!  

The dim sum variety here also tends to be on the sweeter side (Cantonese style), FYI."}
{"text":"So, I've spoken before about hidden gems...
I've never been to a hidden PALACE before. 

The Emperor's Palace is located on Rockwell in an older section of Cleveland's Chinatown area, on a street that is, to say the least, secluded. It is a MASSIVE storefront, with a whole collection of Chinese Zodiac animals (full sized statues, mind you,) guarding the large parking lot across the street. The front is done up in brass finery and the whole place just looks...impressive. 

Two other things that are impressive, the food and the service. 

The hostess was very gracious, seating us herself and then answering any questions that we had about menu items. They have many wonderful, round tables with that spinning section so you can share your food choices, and believe me, you'll want to. 

We decided on an eclectic collection of steamed and baked buns with pulled pork, shrimp dumplings and several appetizers. The main dishes we got were and AMAZING General Tso's chicken, and a chicken with garlic, ginger and Chinese okra that were just wonderful. The service, btw, was outstanding. Glasses were never empty, and plates were gone like magic. 

Their menu was massive, with a large selection of things like congee, many vegetarian dishes and a whole host of treats. 

The decor is very elegant, in golds and rich woods and a very nice atmosphere that lends itself to a nice evening with friends and conversation. 

(Speaking of which, many thanks, BTW, to our friends Richard and Sherri who introduced us to this place, we WILL be back.)

When we went, there wasn't a large crowd, but I'm guessing that this may be due to the secluded nature of the Emperor's Palace, but I hope that you'll try it yourself and see. If you want to be treated like a King, you've got to visit the Emperor!"}
{"text":"Came on a Friday for dim sum, party of about 10. No carts, but ordered off the menu. Had the usual assortment of dim sum in the bamboo baskets. All tasted fresh and hot, nothing seemed chewy - sign of being a left over from the day before. We didn't have any noodles or rice, just the dim sum plates. Some of the plates were some of the best we have ever had - hai cheeng - white noodle w/ shrimp - could have used a larger shrimp, but the noodle was tops, shaio mai and hai gow - both very flavorful. Service was good. Very nice decor - the wallpaper, the wood motif, the wall hangings would look over the top anywhere else, but here it seemed to fit the motif well. Place was kind of dead, people need to find this old Chinatown again and give the restaurant a chance. In New York or Boston, this place would be hopping with customers."}
{"text":"I've been on a search for good Chinese basically my entire life.  It's never been spicy enough, and the offerings I can get are slim.  Enter this lovely bright spot in my day.  They have vegan options AND the spice factor was finally perfect!

I ordered the spicy basil tofu with 3 cups sauce and the General Tso's vegetarian \"chicken\" so have options (and dinner later) plus veggie spring rolls, because why not?  Both were incredible; fresh crisp tender veggies (and loads of them) tofu was done properly, not mush like I've gotten other places.  The real star was the General Tso's vegetarian \"chicken\". Crispy outside, tofu and veggies inside, drenched in a perfectly spicy sauce that was not overpowering but had me looking for my drink.  

All in all, I'm looking forward to trying more of their extensive vegan/vegetarian options."}
{"text":"Excellent food and beautiful dining area! It was an early Sunday family dinner. We went to this restaurant by a recommendation from a close family member. The restaurant was empty so we immediately started contemplating whether we should stay. Glad we did! The service was super friendly, the food arrived quickly and it was fresh. The entrees were delicious and each one had a distinct taste like they are supposed to. We will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Lots of vegetarian and vegan options but overall I didn't love what we had. My favorite was the vegan general tso's chicken, which was fried balls of tofu in a nicely sweet sauce. I hated the tofu skin that came wrapped over nori; it was way too fishy tasting. Friendly staff though."}
{"text":"First experience was a great experience! 

They offer dim sum in the afternoon! Yay, exactly what I came for. Quality of food was great or I was really hungry; just know that I enjoyed it all! 

Service was great. Interior space was hugeeee with beautiful interior design. It truly makes you feel like you're in a palace with all the gold decors, chandeliers, and paintings on the wall. 

Definitely will come back when I have my dim sum cravings!"}
{"text":"for people coming from LA, I'm so sorry to give a one star review. 

on the other hand,  this is the worst dim sum place I have ever experienced in my life, in which I mean the taste!!!"}
{"text":"Had dim sum here on 11-6-16.  Ordered Emperor's steamed shrimp dumplings which were absolutely delicious, and priced at only $3.25 for four, a bargain.  The bbq pork buns (3 for $3.25) were a bit too doughy for my taste but the filling was very good.  Also ordered scallion pancakes (2 for 3.25) which were, again, good but a bit too oily for my taste.  Finally, had Homsuigok (3 deep fried dumpling filled w/meats & shrimp), but these were served at room temperature which was not very appetizing to me.  This place is very clean, well lit, but a bit noisy.  The floor is ceramic tile which is great for cleanliness but rough on noise absorption.  I would definitely come here again & order their lo mein and pot stickers which looked fantastic.  Good service."}
{"text":"Always a nice experience! I come here all the time with my family and the staff always remembers us. They also did an amazing job catering my graduation party which was a hit because of them."}
{"text":"Ate here for lunch and had high expectations, based on the other yelper's reviews but I was disappointed.  Ordered the kung pao lunch special.  Waitress asked how spicy and I answered medium.   The special included an egg roll and rice.  Both the egg roll and the kung pao were a little warmer than room temperature.  In fact, I looked around to see if they had a lunch buffet because I thought maybe they just took the food from the buffet and put it on my plate.   In regards to spiciness, there was no kick at all to the kung pao.  No real flavor in any of it really. In all fairness, I haven't had chinese food in a long time, been eating mostly thai; perhaps my taste buds are used to thai now.

I don't plan on going back"}
{"text":"This restaurant has been open for a few weeks and is located on Rockwell (off of E. 21st St). The decor both inside and outside is quite stunning and beautiful. Menu items include typical dishes like \"general tzo's\" and \"orange chicken,\" but the sauces are anything but ordinary. We had the General Tzo's Tofu - the sauce was sweet, delicate, and flavorful - nothing like I've had before. Also tried the stir fried green beans and Singapore rice noodles. The staff was more than happy to accommodate our vegetarian diet. They also serve Dim Sum (both meat and vegetarian options). 

The service is pretty good, but some servers need help from the managers to help with their English when taking orders from tables. Our main dishes did not come out at the same time, but was okay for us because we shared all of our dishes."}
{"text":"I went here twice in two separate occasions and I have to say the 2nd time around was much worse. Food was 50/50 okay. They got the basics down. Shu mai, shrimp dumplings were good. Atmosphere - room was gold everywhere. Gold wallpaper, 6 chandeliers. it was bedazzling. It felt like you really walked into the emperor's palace. 

I went the first time with a couple of friends of mine really early on a Saturday morning because we both were craving for some congee. Wonton gourmet was not open yet but I figured I give this place a try. We ordered their congee with pork and preserved egg. At first, I wanted to order a different type so my friend and I can try both but when we inquired about it, they told us that they didn't have any and that they had only made the pork one only.Maybe because we were there way too early but if you have it on the menu, you should have already made it. If you need time to make it, come early and open the shop. It had the right consistency however, it was way too salty. When it was time to leave, it took them twenty minutes to figure out that we wanted them to \"mi dan\". There were about five waiters and waitresses standing around clueless of what was going on. We both just went up to the counter and only then they figured we wanted our bill. There were not many tables there and I thought there shouldn't be any sort of waiting but this was a big letdown for being here for the first time. Poor customer service. 

Second time around I went with a large group of friends, maybe 8 or 9 of us. At first, I didn't want to go because I had such a bad experience for the first time. So I said, let's try it again because maybe I went way too early. This time it would be considered the time where the majority of people would go, around 1pm. Knowing that some of us have already dined, we all ordered everything what we wanted. I believe there were over ten items. We figured they could just bring everything out at the same time and we would get a feast of dim sum...but nope, they only brought out what they had available at the time. So if you can imagine 8 hungry men and women waiting on our food. Finally we get some food but it was only about 5 or 6 of the items we ordered and that was waiting for about 10-15 minutes. Hungry as we were, we gobbled it all up. Come ten minutes later and another, the rest of our food came. 

A list of some of the items I remembered:
Sticky rice ball - had no taste and outer layer did nothing for me. We thought this was the sticky rice with the leaf but we kept an open mind. If it had taste, I'd think otherwise but blah. 
Buns with spring onion on top - it had pork inside, this was on the contrary very good. We had 3 plates of those. 
Red Pork Buns -bread was soft but not enough sauce 
Shu Mai - fatty pork 
Shrimp Dumplings or har gow - some of my friends liked the thickness of the rice paper but I didn't. I still liked the ones from Li Wah better. 
Shrimp Noodle - noodle was thick. Maybe it's based on people preferences but I like mine thin and that it doesn't taste like last night's food.
Spicy Chicken Feet - plenty of big fat chicken fat, this was actually to my liking

Would I come again? Probably not."}
{"text":"Authentic Chinese food right in CLE. They have an amazing Dim Sum assortment. Lunch combos are from 11-4 and are $6.95. You won't leave hungry.

I got the Spicy Diced Chicken. My wife wanted to try it but she's not big on spicy food so I ordered it as \"medium\". I thought it was a step above \"Midwest spicy\" but it was too much for her. I can't wait to try maximum spiciness.

Very nice interior decoration. Parking is convenient (on street and a lot across the street) and it isn't hard to find at all."}
{"text":"The best Dim Sum in Cleveland. Great service. Spotlessly clean. Parking is great. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!!"}
{"text":"Spotted photos of this place from a fellow whose Instagram I follow and decided that the best way to celebrate some good news was to venture in this past Saturday to get some dim sum with my best friend.

As a long-time patron on Li Wah's dim sum hours, my expectations for Emperor's Palace were moderately high. Given that it was rather full when we arrived, I was quite excited. We had a choice of tables, one right next to the door or one in the side room that was much quieter. Opting for the quieter room, we sat for a good 10 minutes before anyone inquired about drinks or food. 

I'm used to the little roaming carts filled with delicious bites, but I also liked the idea of asking for items right off the menu at Emperor's Palace. I generally get the same items and then will try one or two things new when I'm at Li Wah's, so being able to tell them exactly what I wanted without waiting for that particular cart to roll around was great, but I also didn't get to see much new either. There was also no particular order in which items came out.

For the most part, everything was mediocre at best. We go the char siu bao, shao mai, shrimp in rice crepes, 1/2 roasted duck, har gau, and the sticky rice in lotus leaves. Everything in some kind of rice-wrapper was mushy, the duck wasn't crispy but it was flavorful (and most of the fat that I'm used to being rendered off was still there, contributing to the soggy skin), and the char siu bao had this strange acetone-like taste if you inhaled as you bit into the bao (did not finish these). 

The only thing that was really good was the sticky rice in lotus leaves. The rest was really disappointing and the service was slow and inattentive. I don't expect world-class service, but I do expect at least a basic level of service. It felt like they did not really want us there at all."}
{"text":"No no no no.....do not go here.

We got here around 11 AM. There were no lines, there were no carts, and there were maybe 10 people inside. This was a red flag. But we sat down anyway just to see what they served.  

We were looking for a place that had mango pudding and assortment of Jell-O's... Li Wah is amazing, but they really dropped the ball with desserts. Only offering delicious egg tarts and a red been in coconuts Jell-O situation...

We figured if emperors Palace could come through with the desserts we would be happy to dim sum hop from Li Wah's to Emperors Palace!

We ordered basics, beef shumai, and spareribs with black beans... pork buns and a few other dumplings that looked good...The first dishes to arrive with a beef Shumai in the spare ribs... No color, the dumpling wrap around the beach shumai was soggy and falling off, there was no meat in the spare ribs, just a super oil and absolutely no potatoes or taro root... and no black beans...

We took one bite of each dish, got up from the table and walk to the front to pay our bill. No we did not want to take our dishes take out, no we did not want to pay for everything that we ordered, we just wanted to pay for the two dishes they came to our table and we wanted to leave.

It took some negotiating but I was firm, and we left paying for the two dishes and leaving a tip.


We drove directly to Li Wah's and had a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"This is the BEST Chinese food in Cleveland. I got my co-workers hooked on it, and now we are all addicts. We have all eaten Chinese food all over the country and the world, and nothing really compares to this place. This place truly is a gem in all senses of the word. The building is amazing, but the food is even better. The service is also amazing. I can't say enough about their food. Their vegetarian and vegan options are out of this world, and I am yet to try something I don't like. I normally get the basil and chili chicken, but even when I try something else, I am never disappointed."}
{"text":"Great lunch deal!  $7.50 include large portion with brown or white rice with a spring roll.  Great flavor and big portions equal happy full stomach.  I'm definitely coming back for my second lunch visit.  If dinner is anything like this I will be making additional trips."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food that I have ever had. Quality and taste is very good. Decor is nice, service great."}
{"text":"Awful food, ordered orange chicken which is described as \"all white meat\" and it is anything but. See the attached photo (number 156 in the yelp list of photos for this place) of this garbage they charged me $20 for. Ended up eating the boring fried rice and throwing the rest away."}
{"text":"I heard about a group of people reviving the Rockwell Chinatown, but I hadn't gotten around to visiting it yet. Glad we got around to doing it, it was a great experience!

We got a number of dim sum dishes to start out, the shrimp dumplings were excellent and the soup dumplings were great too. I don't mind that they don't have the carts - it gives you more time to think and they have a picture dim sum menu if you need it. The dim sum was definitely better than Li Wah and cheaper!

We picked out two main dishes - the steamed fish and a lamb stew. The steamed fish was very fresh, probably alive until this afternoon right before we ordered it, was well prepared and had good flavor. The lamb stew had very good quality meat and tasted very fresh as well. My wife grew up in China and went to university in Guangzhou, the area of China where you might find some of this restaurant's food, and she was impressed with both of the dishes. The prices on the main courses were cheaper than the other restaurants in the area as well.

The decor was great. It was definitely the best decorated Chinese restaurant in Cleveland. The bathroom was acceptable - not always a given in Asian restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"As others have said, this place is hidden. It's on a side street where you wouldn't expect a restaurant to be. But as you get closer you see how large the building is. It's also very cool looking. It lives up to the 'palace' in the name.

The inside atmosphere matches the outside.  It's very decadent. Lots of gold. 

I was there at lunch and had no issues getting a table. They were somewhat busy. But not crowded.

The food was amazing. I ordered a dinner portion of General Tso's Chicken and asked for it to be extra extra spicy. They did not disappoint. It had a great kick. Not to the point where eating it was uncomfortable or made me regret asking for the heat level. 

The chicken was of good quality. Much better than what you'd expect from a regular $8 Chinese meal. 

The only thing I didn't really care for was they did a vegetable spring roll with the meal in lieu of an egg roll. It was good, but I would have preferred an egg roll. I'm not sure if it was an option, I did not ask. 

The others in my party ordered General Tso's shrimp and Chicken and Broccoli. Both were very satisfied.

I'm glad that I randomly chose this place and was certainly not disappointed. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"The Dim Sum isn't brought around on carts, but it's hot and fresh. Best in Cleveland I've tried so far."}
{"text":"Been here many times. A quiet gem with delicious food and attentive staff.  If you like spicy food, ask for hot and you will get it."}
{"text":"I don't know why this place is getting a bad yelp rap! It's really affordable and the food is really good! The servers were helpful in suggesting dim sum options and quantities. We had the juicy dumplings, the shrimp dumplings and the pork buns with some soup--all of which was delicious. We did have one dumpling that was cold and had thai-like food inside (peanuts, cilantro, chicken I think), that one was a bit strange. Unfortunately you cannot get the shrimp crepes later into the evening, but the food we ate was great as was the service and we got soup for two plus 6 dim sum plates for $30."}
{"text":"The food is good enough--standard dim sum at a good price. But I just made an account in the restaurant to write this review. I've been waiting for a waitress to acknowledge us for the last 45 minutes. We haven't gotten water, the other food that we ordered, a box for our leftovers, or a check. Save your time and go to Li Wah."}
{"text":"It's a little confusing finding the entrance because it looks like there is a door every five feet along the establishment. Just head for the statue and you're on your way. Once you come in you are greeted with a lot of elegantly tacky decor. Gold everywhere. Everything seemed larger than life. Expensive furniture, high ceilings, really huge windows, huge tables... Oh, the tables. They're high. The chairs, pretty low in comparison. Like, I'm 5' 8.000194\" which I thought was slightly above average for the Asian male, and the tabletop was at LEAST nipple-level. When I went to sit down, I had to catch myself because I felt like I was going to fall to the ground. It's awkward at first but in the end I wasn't uncomfortable eating at all. This is more of a friendly warning than a complaint. 

The real estate of the table was more bothersome since they sat our party of five at a very spacious 8 seater, so it felt a little weird for us to be so spread apart. But this, too, ended up working out because we ordered so much food that it barely fit on the table.

Most of what we ordered was really, really freaking good. I'd say my favorite dish was Fish Fillet w/ Spicy Tangy Sauce. Someone else ordered it and I wasn't really salivating at the thought of it, but when I tried it, it was so flavorful and delicious. The sauce was out of this world and had a nice little kick to it. Also had mushu pork, which was also good but never came with the sauce I thought it was supposed to, so it was a little dry with the wraps.

I also wanted to try their dim sum, which is made to order and offered all day. Had the siumai, ha gao, and turnip cake, and they were made to perfection. Large pieces, juicy, meaty filling in a nice, moist skin. The turnip cakes were huge and some of the best I've had. I'm inclined to say their dim sum was better quality than Bo Loong and Li Wah. Yeah, little ladies pushing dim sum carts may be cooler, but having it made to order helps the quality and certainly prevents them from drying out--something that happens all too often at the other places.

There were a few misses, like forgotten sauces here and there, and bringing food out without rice, but overall the food was delicious and had very generous portions. Service was pretty good with no language issues. I would definitely return. 

tl;dr - all gold everythang, nipples, and bomb ass food."}
{"text":"Great dim sum spot. 

The place is ladened with gold from top to bottom. 

The dishes were already steamed and ready to be served on this Saturday afternoon; the food were superrr fresh and authentic. I judge dim sum on the quality of Asianness. The beef balls were so springy -- so on pointe. I also recommend the shrimp dumpling har gow, pork dumpling siu mai, shrimp noodle crepe roll cheung fun, beef balls ngao yuk, and phoenix claws chicken feet.

I also had to have my honey walnut shrimp -- excellent quality made HK style.

This is located in Old Chinatown"}
{"text":"I visited Emperor's Palace with my mom and dad last night, just a few days after their grand opening. Our first impressions were very positive and we're planning on visiting again soon to get to know their menu a little better. My dad was very impressed by their boiled chicken (see photo... as I'm not sure if that's an accurate English translation for this dish). The boiled chicken was very tender, but not bloody at all... which I'm told is something difficult to achieve for this dish. The ginger dipping sauce for the chicken was great. Our soup - mustard vegetable and pork - was fine and certainly as good as soup we've had at Siam Cafe nearby. The Chinese bok choy was also prepared very well. 

If you decide to visit and are similarly impressed, spread the word - I'm not sure if these guys are marketing themselves aggressively enough."}
{"text":"Five stars, to me, means close to perfection, so I don't award them lightly.  But Emperor's Palace is truly outstanding--and I didn't even know that it existed until Chinese New Year, when my Chinese friends took me there for a super-delicious meal.

Now, I had an unfair advantage, because my friends had long conversations with the servers about what goodies would be coming our way--and, of course, these conversations were in Chinese.  If my reward is food this good, I think I need to begin studying Mandarin.  A reviewer said that her order was \"dramatically different from what we know them to be.\"  I think that the problem for most of us Yanks is that them there crafty Chinese habituate us to food specially crafted to our palates in most restaurants.  (My Chinese fiance would always say that Chinese food had to be \"edited\" for 'Mericans,.  It needed to be fried and oilier than normal, sweetened when it would not normally be sweetened, and cooked longer.  He was a great cook, so he had a lot of credibility.)  

And, yeah, the area is certainly \"bad.\"  Those who don't spend most of their time in the CSU area, as I do, might want to make the first visit during daylight hours.  There is no parking lot.  We had no trouble finding parking, though, although the restaurant was crowded--Chinese New Year, remember?  Oh, and there are cool statues of Chinese zodiac animals lining the street.  Oh, and the interior is GORGEOUS.  

I recommended the restaurant to all my friends, regardless of national origin.  I haven't had the opportunity to eat there again, but I am eager to do so.  My opinion:  well worth a try, if you like authentic, tasty Chinese food.  (Obviously I do!)"}
{"text":"It is not often that I will venture to a restaurant 2 days in a row.  It is not often I will Yelp about a restaurant two days in a row.  I have a feeling it is going to be often that I visit Emperor's Palace.  I have a feeling it is going to be often that I rave about their food.  I have a feeling that I will often tell everyone know to eat there.  Have you been there yet?  If not, go there now!  It is truly the best Szechuan Chinese, if not all Chinese in all of Cleveland.  After yesterdays visit, I realized there is way too much on the menu that I would like to eat.  Tonight I ate General Tso's Veggie Chicken.  At first I was confused what this meant, however I asked the restaurateur how this could be and she described it as a special mixture of vegetables which included mushroom, soy bean ham (excellent as it turns out), and onion among other ingredients.  She said she is Vegan herself.  
I thought that in my last days of omnivorous eating I would be taking in as much meat as I could, however the cooking is so skilled and fine tuned here, there is no need.  I challenge you to eat the General Tso's Veggie chicken and really tell me its not meat!  It is so good and filling!!!!
I also sampled my lover's dish, was Orange Chicken, which was in fact a real dead bird!  The chicken was fried to crispy perfection and the sweet sauce was perfect.  The restaurateur also told us they do not use white sugar but rather honey and brown sugar.  
We also shared a bowl of Hot and Sour soup which I will say for the first time I enjoyed.  My lover normally orders this wherever we go and I never like it.  Tonight I found Hot and Sour soup to be exceptional.
I have tried 5 different dishes so far and all have been delicious.  I wish I could eat them all but I fear I will simply not have the time.  I highly encourage a visit to this restaurant if you are at all on the fence about where to dine.  I live about 30 minutes outside of Cleveland and I know I will be making weekend trips here already.  I promise not to post an excessive amount of updates on my soon to be visits however I know I will want to.
Oh yea...as previously mentioned the d√©cor is phenomenal.  I forget I am in the United States when here.  It is simply amazing!!!!
Oh yea # 2... the price point here is perfect, some of the best tasting food anywhere priced moderately per person.  This is a treat and a hidden gem I hope they stay around for a long long time even after I am gone."}
{"text":"Never again!! Another botched order. Left out ANOTHER ITEM. Never will I order from here again, promise that!! **** EDIT**** GrubHub called me, The resturant is \"too busy\" to bring me my item. The one thing I REALLY WANTED from the order. Grub Hub acknowledged my many issues with this place. I DO NOT recommend ordering from them."}
{"text":"Ehhh..just no.

This is not in a good area, its not easy to get to and there is no parking. The decor is tacky, and every dish we ordered was drastically different from what we know them to be. Neither of us liked how they tasted either.

We will not return."}
{"text":"Great Chinese food for takeout/delivery. I just came here in person for takeout for the first time and the employees are very nice, and the space is very nice as well!"}
{"text":"Super old school Chinese. Dim sum was limited but good. Very authentic.  It's BYOB So grab some beer, saki and a few friends have a fun night out with great food in a kitschy environment."}
{"text":"This review is for their dim sum food and service specifically. We had a group dim sum outing with 8 adults and 3 kids over the weekend. Luckily, the wait wasn't long, and they had enough high chairs for the babies! Although it took a bit longer for the food we ordered to come out, the food here is definitely better quality than at other dim sum places in CLE. Here, there aren't dim sum ladies pushing carts around, so you order from the menu like you would normally at a restaurant. We enjoy dim sum here because the food tastes fresh, and we can avoid huge crowds or waiting for an hour for a table. The staff is incredibly nice and friendly here! The ladies aren't rude, which sometimes is associated with dim sum service ...or general Chinese restaurant service ;p. Trust me, it's not common to find such good staff service, so kudos to the Emperor's Palace staff! 

We ordered everything from shrimp dumplings to banana leaf sticky rice, and even side a huge bowl of congee. They introduced their new dish to us, a turnip/taro pancake filled with bits of veggies and meats. I definitely never had this dish before, and I've grown up on dim sum. We loved it, and will definitely order it again on our next dim sum trip here. I also really loved their beef balls! If you've never had these during dim sum, just be aware that they are indeed cooked thoroughly even though it's pink when cut it in half. So good! In addition to the dim sum foods we also ordered their beef ho fun(fat rice noodles), and their Singapore chow mei fun(rice vermicelli) both of which were delicious! I'm so impressed with their continued efforts to brings us new dishes! Thank you for not being another stagnant, boring Chinese restarting in CLE!"}
{"text":"I was at Emperor's Palace first for dim sum brunch with friends about three weeks after it's opening.  This was very good and there is a central buffet area where you can pick the dishes you like and a server will bring it to you.  The shrimp dumplings (har kow) were a little dry but the rest of the dim sum was great and very authentic.  Food was flavorful and not overly greasy.  The sticky rice in lotus leaves, chicken feet, tripe, steamed beef meatballs, and pot stickers were delicious.  The jellyfish was also great.

I went back later in the week for take out dinner after a late meeting and ordered the Szechuan tofu and the Hunan shrimp.  The Szechuan tofu had those wonderful mouth numbing peppercorns in the sauce and the Hunan shrimp was flavorful with fresh vegetables.  I ordered the spice level at medium hot which was perfect for me.
It came with a choice of steamed jasmine rice or \"healthy rice,\" a mix of some jasmine and wild and brown rice.  I tried the \"healthy rice\" and found it quite tasty and will probably have it again.
 
The menu is large and has many authentic dishes.  I speak Cantonese so ordering food is pretty easy, but the managers speak English very well and remembered me from my first visit.  Overall, very good customer service, great food quality.  

I would give this restaurant 5 stars, but my only drawback is its location, especially at night.  Rockwell is a bit isolated from the other restaurants and businesses at night and there are some occasional individuals requesting handouts as you go toward your car.  I feel safe, but I think this may turn some people off."}
{"text":"There was a roach crawling from my plate. Never again! She was very rude after showing her and when I tried to chime in, reiterating that there was a ROACH in my food, she said she doesn't argue and walked away"}
{"text":"A party of 4 of us wanted to try some place new in Cleveland for dim sum and heard about Emperor's Palace located in the old Chinatown area. 

The restaurant was easy to find, with plenty of parking in the lot across the street from the building. The lot is very distinctive because there are 12 stone statues of animals standing guard facing the restaurant. These are the 12 Chinese zodiac animals, a very nice landmark.

We were very impressed with the decor inside the restaurant. It is ornately decorated with gold and other Chinese trimmings. The staff was very friendly and quite knowledgeable about  the menu too. Our drinks were kept filled (hot tea and iced water) and the dim sum dishes we ordered were delivered to our table piping hot.

Compared to other dim sum places in Cleveland, the food here was head and shoulders above the rest. The portions were larger, the temperature was good (we know it had not been sitting in a cart cooling down), and the taste was more flavorful. The Phoenix Claws we had were plump and not overcooked. The Turnip Cake was thick and crispy on the outside. The riblets in black bean sauce were tasty morsels of deliciousness. We had two pastry dishes, both which were excellent. The pastry was flaky and light while the filling was savory and hot.

While this restaurant's dim sum selection is quite large, we would have liked it if they had a couple of items we liked at the other large dim sum place. Unfortunately, the Emperor's Palace did not serve fried sticky rice or our favorite dessert, \"tau foo fah\". Even then, I would not hesitate to return to this restaurant for some excellent and authentic dim sum!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and a great d√©cor.  I have never had a bad meal here.  I definitely recommend it to everyone."}
{"text":"Great place to eat! This was my first visit to the Palace but I was impressed by the quality of the food and presentation of the dishes. Service was friendly and helpful. Definitely a place to frequent and bring friends"}
{"text":"Delicious food and gorgeous restaurant! A must-try in the CLE area!"}
{"text":"We did carry out, restaurant was beautiful inside.  General Taos Chicken was excellent.  Cashew chicken and  Szechuan chicken tasted the same but with different nuts.  Basil shrimp were pretty hot,  that dish was so so.  Did not try their Dim Sum.  Fried rice was very plain.  Staff was very nice and friendly.  It was good, not great, but nice for take out."}
{"text":"Oh yay, a new dim sum place in the CLE!  

A lot of their dim sum food is on display in the center of the restaurant.  To order, you go to the center display and point to what you want, or you pick from the menu.  I wasn't really a fan of this.  There isn't much at the center display, and then you need to dig through the menu to try to figure out what it is you want.  They said they didn't have carts because kids would try to grab things off of the carts... but I think kids can just as easily grab things off of the center display too?

The food here, I would say, is pretty comparable to that other dim sum place about five blocks away.  Some things they do better (their egg tarts, for instance), and some things not as well (their rice noodle rolls).  One plus is that they do seem to put a bit more care into the preparation and appearance of their food.  In terms of variety, overall, it is okay.  They have all of your basic dim sum dishes - that is, ha gao/xia jiao (shrimp dumplings), siu mai/shao mai and whatnot , but the other restaurant does have some extra pickings, such as mussels and salt&pepper shrimp.

Not bad overall, but I think I will still mostly opt for the other place."}
{"text":"Big disappointment tonight here. Service was curt and unfriendly, but the food was dreadful. Even the water had an unpleasant chemical quality. Soup was thin, wantons had only the meerest hint of pork, the chips were overly greasy and cold, the fried rice was cold and tasteless and the \"crispy\" duck was over-salted, over-battered and unappetizing. 
We decided never to return. There are too many other good choices in Cleveland's Chinatown neighborhood."}
{"text":"Stopped by for brunch. Having a bite with grandma :) Shrimp dumplings here are always quality good, it's not ginger that's inside the dumpling with the shrimp so no worries. Just bamboo shoot, complements it well. And had some soy sauce cruller noodles. I find the cilantro meatballs are very salty. Fun times."}
{"text":"Kinda torn between three and four stars, but I'll boost it to four based on the strength of the dim sum. I do prefer the instant gratification, gluttony and \"oh, that looks good\" effect of traditional cart-delivered dim sum, but there's a lot to be said for fresh-made. We tried a variety of dim sum items off the menu, and they were all very fresh and good. We didn't try any Americanized dishes, but we did get the salt-baked shrimp, and it was pretty solid. I would have preferred a lighter and more crispy batter and more heat from the peppers, but it was fresh and tasty. It'd be fun to see this desolate stretch of Rockwell turn into something better, and I'll be back to check in on this nice little palace."}
{"text":"It took us a while to find good Chinese in Cleveland... Coming from Philly, i have been disappointed in the Chinese offerings here in Cleveland until now. This place has amazing food. When you arrive it looks like  you may be in the wrong place other then the Chinese decor on the door and the abandoned parking lot across the street. Dont let that fool you. Go in and get some great Chinese food!"}
{"text":"Very authentic food. Atmosphere was too lit up.   Parking was easy. Dim sum was excellent."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE....

I just left here.... I arrived at about 12:15... I was the only one in the restaurant. I guess this should have been a warning sign considering every time I had been to Li Wah there were lines out the door at this time. 

First thing I noticed is there were no little carts being pushed around with all the little goodies inside. 

I ordered off the menu. Shumai, Hargow, Shrimp Rice Dumpling, Shrimp Rice Crepe and Steamed Pork Buns.....

I waited about 15 mins for my food to arrive....

The Shrimp Rice Crepe has no taste even with the extra soy they added. Was too thick . Crepe to shrimp ratio ....eh

The Hargow I spit out . It has boiled peanuts or stale peanuts on the inside that had an industrial chemical taste to it....

I had never had steamed bbq pork buns before but have always wanted to try .... I took a bite of the fluffy steamed dough which was good... I smelled the contents of the bun and smelled what I could only describe as AMMONIA!!! 

Save yourself a trip and go to Li Wah which is literally minutes from here on Payne Ave"}
{"text":"I remember when this place was the Shanghai Restaurant. It was one of three restaurants on the block in the old Chinatown, the others being \"The Three Sisters\" and \"The Gold Coins.\" The Emperor's Palace is in the old Shanghai location, but it has been completely remodeled. It's a very clean restaurant. Sure the decor is over the top and looks like something out of a set from \"The King and I,\" but let's talk about what matter most: the food. It's excellent and you can have it prepared American style or traditional Chinese style. I really enjoyed simple broccoli and chicken with fried rice. Very good. It's become my favorite Chinese restaurant in Cleveland.

UPDATE: I like the interactions the waiters have with you about Chinese food when ordering. I'm trying to try more traditional Chinese style prepared dishes and today did not disappoint. My server suggested I try fresh garlic sauce Chinese style. They'll even put it on the side for those who are not brave at heart. The regular garlic sauce is great as well and can be put on the side to limit calories, fat and salt. It's a great way to expand your awareness of Chinese foods. And you can say no MSG. I'm a big fan of this place."}
{"text":"My first visit here was for dim sum and it's not very traditional with it at all as far as serving it. Then again, I don't know if pushing the carts around with it is very traditional in itself so take that for what it's worth.

The menu and offerings is pretty similar to everyone else in the area so I can't say there's anything that really makes this different from the rest in that aspect. One thing that we did end ordering was the pork belly. Now I haven't ordered this or seen it at other places but it was mind blowing. It truly melts in your mouth. The reaction is like soap to greasy water. Amazing.

My second visit was so Christmas Eve I believe and was for Dim Sum as well. The place wasn't very busy but the service was slow and the food wasn't great. It's almost like the expected it to be busy so they prepared all the popular dishes ahead of time and was going to reheat and reserve as people ordered. You could tell the food was a bit old. This was very disappointing. I doubt I'll find myself here again but who knows!"}
{"text":"Several of my friends told me about this place. It was hard to find at first. The decor on this place is really nice. The only problem with the table we sat on was not leveled and was rocking back and forth.

The service was nice and the waitress is pretty helpful with suggestive order. The service was a little slow.

We had the dim sum and it was quite good. I like them because they are not as greasy as others. The pineapple bun and the fried pork bun is the best of all the dim sum. The waterchestnut cake is one of my childhood favorite is on the menu. It's a sweet dessert. 

For everyone who is direction challenged to this restaurant. You go to either St. Clair Ave or Superior Ave and enter either 21st St or 24th St. Rockwell Ave is between the two street.

Will definitely go back to try more dishes."}
{"text":"Great new Chinese restaurant in Cleveland. The location is in an out of the way area full of warehouses, but you can tell you've arrived by the colorful exterior and stone statues of the Chinese zodiac animals. The interior decor is elaborate and new with crystal chandeliers and lots of gold. 

We went as a group for dim sum on Christmas Eve for lunch. The waitress/hostess was very accommodating for such a large group, although she and the servers definitely had some difficulty with questions in English from dim sum newcomers. Unfortunately, as others noted, they do not serve dim sum off carts. We ordered off the menu and were told that several items were \"sold out\" at 1pm. I guess they can't make more? 

That being said, the quality was the best I've had in Cleveland (with the caveat that I'm accustomed to dim sum in San Francisco, Southern Cal, and New York.) The har gow were large, filled with equally large chunks of shrimp, and the siu mai were sizable and tasty. Lotus wrapped sticky rice was filled with pork, shrimp, sausage, and (oddly) meatballs but also really good. The turnip cakes were also a hit at our table, although they were steamed rather than pan fried the way I like them finished. Tofu skins wrapped around pork  filling were served in a rich sauce and were quite good. Some at the table found the short ribs a little greasy, as were the scallion pancakes.

I'm excited to discover this place! I will definitely be back again to try more items."}
{"text":"Emperors serve great Cantonese food. Yes I specially recommended this place for Businesses or dating. The decoration are very classy and elegant. I  offer authentic cantonese Dim Sum. More healthier, tasty, and the texture is correct. I can tell just because I am a Chinese  grow up in Hong Kong.  I am a picky eater!"}
{"text":"definitely a good place for 'dim sum'. :)
as far as i know this is the only place that offers pretty authentic 'dim sum' menu and the other foods on the menu are very nice too.
it's a little hard to find this place at first but after the first time, i've been going there like 3 times a week now!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese delivery serving downtown. A little pricey but combo platter portions are massive and the dim sum options are fantastic. Orange chicken has actual dried orange peels. Hong Kong roast pork is incredible. My go-to when I crave Chinese food."}
{"text":"The decor is a lot better than many of the shabby chinese/asian restaurants in the area.  There is also plenty of room in there.  However, the food and service on the occasion my family went there was pretty abysmal.  Not waited on for probably a good 10 minutes after we were seated.  Food came out exceptionally slow.  The Dim Sum was easily the worst I've had--even though they came in the usual steaming cookware, I suspect the food was microwaved and served.  In one particularly heinous serving, I ordered Beef Tripe, a common staple at most Dim Sums;  turned out to be a luke warm mix of tripe, potato, lung (yes, lung), and meat.  \"Steamed\" pork buns did not appear steamed but instead look like they were browned in a pan on both sides;  inside was soggy and did not taste fresh.  

Their regular menu items didn't fare much better.  Deep fried shrimp that did not taste fresh--seemed like already cooked shrimp was re-dipped in fry oil to \"freshen\" it up.  Other dishes like Seafood chow mein was OK but nothing special.  Most dishes were very oily.  The one I liked the best was the crispy duck.  

A shame this place looks good but serves less than mediocre food.  Avoid."}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant on a Sunday lunch.  This restaurant is the beginning of the rebirth of the old Chinatown in Cleveland.  There is ample parking in a lot across the street.  The interior is new and modern. 

I first perused the dim sum on a \"salad bar\" like setup.  No carts being pushed around.  I wanted to pick up some dim sum and bring it to my table, but a server offered to bring it over for me.  I chose shrimp dumplings, pork sui mai, and later got another dumpling dish.  The shrimp dumplings were large, plump, and had large chunks of shrimp in it.  The sui mai was very fresh.  The last dumpling a picked had a combination of shrimp, pork, chinese sausage, and maybe water chestnuts.  All the dim sum was awesome!  Only complaint was no soy sauce or hot chili on the tables, not really necessary, but never offered.

I ordered a lunch entry of Spicy Basil Chicken, which came with red and brown rice, and spring roll for $6.95. The waitress asked if I wanted it mild or medium and I was going to choose hot, but asked for medium.  After waiting over 30 minutes, the entree finally arrived.  The chicken dish was a little on the oily side.  I started to eat this dish, which had fresh green and red jalapenos and red chili peppers.  As I ate, the pores in my head started opening up and sweat started to pour from my head.  Medium was ridiculously hot.  Comparable to eating a couple of drops of Pure Cap hot sauce.  It was an OK dish, just a little greasy and way too spicy!

In concluding, the Emperor's Palace is worth checking, based on the decor, location, and dim sum.  This is some of the best dim sum in Cleveland.  The service definitely needs improvement but I still enjoyed this dining experience."}
{"text":"We were in town and were tired of the hotel food but didn't want to go out to eat. We placed our order and paid online. My wife had the shrimp and garlic prawn with egg drop soup and I had the chicken with garlic sauce. Everything was good and still hot when it was delivered. I wouldn't say it was extraordinary but it was good."}
{"text":"Great food and quick delivery! I definitely found my spot. 

The General Tso chicken was delicious! I tried the mild sauce which was just the right flavor and proportional to the chicken. I finally found a place with good authentic fried rice. The shrimp spring rolls are great too. 

Can't wait to work through the menu!"}
{"text":"Hit or miss sometimes it is awesome sometimes I think they serve old stuff.... Happened twice but Ive been there a lot.... Overall not bad"}
{"text":"Last night my husband and me visited this restaurant for our one year wedding anniversary. This is a brand new restaurant. Our first impression is gorgeous. There are many century-old antiques, maybe made in Qing dynasty. The owner and all of the waiters and waitresses are very friendly. We ordered three dishes, whcih is Crispy Flounder, Shrimp with walnut, Mixed seafood and meat. All are great, expecially the  Crispy Flounder and Shrimp with walnut. STRONGLY RECOMMENDED!!! Another surprise is finally we got 10% discount because students holding student ID could get 10 percent off. 

Today we came again to try their morning dim sum. GOD! They have more than 40 types of dim sum. My husband and me, both belong to eating machine level, Our stomach is almost bombed after we ordered 10 dishes dim sum. TOO too too delicious!! STRONGLY RECOMMENDED  Shrimp rice cr√™pe. This is our best favorite. much better than any other restaurants!"}
{"text":"Went here with fellow yelpers Fung and Jaime. 

And it was probably the more decent dim sum in Cleveland.

First, the restaurant is quite gorgeous. The first restaurant open in the \"new\" Chinatown, it's quite pretty- gold and red all over the restaurant and it's brand new.

The dim sum was order only though- although it was fresh, I still prefer my carts, so I know what I'm ordered. I would definitely recommend the siu mai and the ha gao, and even the chicken feet. The sticky rice with preserved meats were okay, and the cheong fun..was not that good. (the noodle was too thick).

Coming from a Canto viewpoint, I must say it's the better of the dim sum places. My lunchmates did not agree...but honestly, I think it was the best in Cleveland. Did I like it? meh...I woudl go again though....but all I know is that it beats Li Wah, that's for sure....."}
{"text":"This appears to be a new dimsum place in town. Food is comparable to Li Wah's (some dishes better, some dishes worse). Decor is really nice, looks new and clean. They don't have the carts to bring you the dimsum, but you can take a look at the dishes in this big cart they have in the center of the restaurant, which is nice for people who know what they want, but don't know the names of the dishes. 

What we ordered:
Hom Sui Gok: much less oily than what I've had at other dimsum places, which is good in that it leaves you feeling healthier and without a layer of oil around your face, but bad in that it makes it taste less good 
Pan fried pork dumplings: Yummy with the san ji bao sauce and vinegar
Clear shrimp dumplings (x2): standard
Xiao Long Bao: Too large! No soup inside. Disappointed :(
Shrimp he fun (x2): could have used more shrimp! Otherwise, flavored nicely with the sauce that came with it. 
Chicken feet: Meaty, one of my dining companions said this tasted better than other chicken feet in the past. I would have preferred it to be flavored a little bit different, but still decent for Cleveland
Short ribs with black pepper sauce: I think I ordered wrong. Was expecting small rib tips with black bean sauce, but ended up being something else. Oops.
Egg tarts: Felt that it could have been warmer, but overall, standard
San ji bao (x2): the sauce that came with this was delicious. 
Pork in this flaky crust thingy: yummy crust, pretty standard
Thousand year duck egg congee: better than other places; actually flavored! Tasted yummy with sriracha
You Tiao: bland but not oily. Tasted fresh, but could have been fried more with fluffier and softer interior
Cha Sao Bao

16 dishes for 6 people. Came out to be around 66 total for the final dining bill. Price seemed much better compared to other dim sum places in Cleveland. Overall, decent dimsum, probably one of the better dim sum joints in Cleveland. Would go there again."}
{"text":"I'm back in Cleveland again for the BrickUniverse LEGO convention. Where did I go for the first dinner?? Yep, back at Emperor's Palace for the tasty dim-sum. This time I took a friend who lives in Chicago to try out the dim-sums. Even he said the food is WAY better than the ones in Chicago. We tried out the beef stir fried flat noodles, steamed pork buns, BBQ pork buns, egg-tarts, the super tasty shrimp dumplings, Sao mai, and beef tripe. (Yes, we ordered too much food, but I get to have midnight snacks). I know I will find a way to eat here again before I head back to Texas next week."}
{"text":"I haven't  had the opportunity yet to try the dim sum, but the combination lunches are excellent! I love the hot pepper chicken, and my friend's General Tso's shrimp looked really good. The service was top-notch! I think we had about 5 different servers while we were there, but not in an annoying way. There was just always someone coming around to refill water, bring plates of food, clear plates, bring the check, etc. 

The restaurant itself is seriously beautiful! It made a random Tuesday work lunch feel extra fancy! 

Chandeliers!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese food near downtown Cleveland for the traditional and non-traditional tastebuds.  Venture out and try the dim sum.  Beautiful decor.  Hasn't been crowded any time we've been there.  May be a front for the Chinese mafia, but I'm cool with it since the food is good.

Don't give up if you can't find the door.  The restaurant seems like it's an entire block, but there's only one set of doors to enter through...and you can't really tell which from that side of the street.  Been there 3 times and felt dumb each time."}
{"text":"Li Wah reminds me of a scene in Big Trouble in Little China. The scene where David Lo Pan is doing the sacrifice of the two green eyed girls so he can reclaim his youth and complete his transformation into an immortal ruler of the underworld. The green neon lights they use really remind me that part! Emperor's Palace reminds me of the other part of Lo Pans place with all of the statues and elaborate furnishings. I came here on a beautiful January night with my brother and father. The vegan options are plentiful which made my brother happy. I tried a bunch of things off the menu and enjoyed them all. The building is very impressive from both the outside and inside. I thought the experience was great. I am wondering why I have not been back."}
{"text":"When your Chinese food cravings kick in, this is the place to go. Classic Chinese take-out food at a cheap price. They also do delivery if you're too lazy to get out of your pajamas to get food. The General Tso's tofu was so good. The sauce was a nice blend of sweet with savory, and the portions are very good. Better put on stretchy pants before you start. They have a large vegetarian menu which made it easier for me to pick out what I wanted. I would just steer clear of the steamed buns. I ordered vegetable buns (3) and egg custard buns (4). The texture was very rubbery on the outside but inside, the dough was almost raw. 

The service quality and employees were phenomenal. Everyone was so friendly and ensured that I was happy with my order. I would definitely would come back here the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Ordered small egg drop soup and large shrimp, beef, and chicken lo mein combo, paid $13.00 + $3 for delivery. The lo mein was completely void of spice and flavor. The noodles were overcooked and mushy as were the shrimp. The chicken tasted like rubber and the beef was the same. The egg drop soup literally had no taste at all and was so thick it tasted like eating bland flavorless paste. Will never try this place again."}
{"text":"We only had dim sum here, but I would give it a 4 for dim sum.

Hai gow was a slightly wrong consistency.  The dough was too thick -- it should be a nice thin layer over the shrimp, but it was more like biting into a thick piece of dough that had a shrimp in it.  Tasted good still, but not quite right.

Turnip cake was great.  It was made fresh for us, we ordered it and it was brought out.  It was just right!  Which is great, because it's one that the bf and I both like, but don't like it @ Li Wah.

Dan tat was perfectly baked, can't say anything more about it.

Ran out of gai lan, which is odd... seems like an odd thing to run out of.  We always order a veggie dish with our dim sum and gai lan is the bf's fave.  But we had to opt for something else that day.

There's more variety at Li Wah, and some things are better here, some things are better there.  For those of you looking for the fun of grabbing things off of carts, they don't push carts here.  But food is decent.  It was well worth a try, and not a bad dim sum day... but I think we'll be going to the other one for our regular weekend dim sum.

-----------------------------------
Explanation of my rating system -
5*: Epitome of something, the best I've had, would LOVE to go back
4*: Great food and happy to go back regularly, but not the best of the category
3*: Food is fine.  I may spontaneously decide to go there based on convenience.  But no need to go back either.
2*: If you insist, I guess I'll come along. I'll find something to eat. But I wouldn't have picked it.
1*: No plans to come back.  I'll try to talk companions out of going."}
{"text":"This place is beautiful inside. The exterior is just as impressive, its too bad Cleveland sucks so unless you're going here to eat, you probably will not be wandering the neighborhood in order to stumble upon the place. I hope word of mouth spreads a good name for this place. We called ahead of time because we could not make it until within 30min of closing, to see if it was ok we still came. The lady on the phone was more than happy to have us and said she would be waiting for us, making me feel warm and special inside. Thats good customer service!

 I truly feel like a Chinese Emperor. I came here on their opening day for dim sum and was not too impressed, I have stuck with Li Wah which I will argue has the best in town that I have tried so far. Coming back the other day for dinner, I was super hungry and hoping their food had improved since opening day, I was not disappointed at all. I was actually quite happy and will be going here again soon to try more off the menu. 

I ordered the Chicken w Cashew nuts and it was flavorful and a generous portion, I ate the rest for lunch the next day and was full again."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. Cleveland only having two dim sum places doesn't really spur healthy competition that you would want to see in an industry so when I heard about this place I figured I would go and try it out and see if it was better than Li Wah or Bo Loong.

I went on a weekend around lunch time, when you would expect the dim sum to be the best as that is the peak time for dim sum. The first thing I noticed walking in was that there was hardly anyone dining in. I figured maybe it was just because we got their at the beginning of lunch time.

I'm an ABC so bare with me on the names of some of the dishes. We sat down and ordered har gow (shrimp dumplings), siu mai (pork dumplings), cha siu bao (pork buns), don tot (egg tarts), chicken feet, and ja leung (fried dough in rice noodles).

As we waited I sipped on some tea and found it to be the strongest I've ever had, probably because it had been sitting around for a while. It was so strong it almost had the color of a Coke.

When the food came, it was less than impressive in appearance. Much of it looked like it had been reheated from the previous day or had been sitting out for a while and that was reflected in the taste and texture of the food. The har gow was very mushy as if it had been sitting in the steamer for too long (and it was also very salty) and the ja leung was stale. The siu mai had little taste and the cha siu bao just didn't taste right. You could tell that the custard in the don tot had settled as the top layer of the custard was starting to pull apart from itself instead of having a nice even surface. The only decent part of the meal was the chicken feet, the taste was spot on.

I was extraordinarily disappointed. The place was clean and the decor was updated so one would assume the food would match the atmosphere.

When we left, the place was still nearly empty, now I can see why. I will probably be sticking to Bo Loong or Li Wah for dim sum."}
{"text":"Best spot in Asia town, hands down! We ordered the wonton soup, dim sum (pork steam buns and Shanghai juicy dumplings ), some beef dish (can't remember the name), Kung pao chicken , and a ginger shrimp. Everything was so flavorful. The king pao chicken was tender. The Beef dish was a little chewy but still amazing flavor. The shrimp dish wasn't too ginger-heavy. It was perfect. They asked if we wanted our food spicy and we requested medium. It came out more mild--Not spicy at all. At the end they brought out some house dessert for us to enjoy- YUM. I'll be back here sooner than I'd probably like"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite Chinese restaurant. Beautifully clean with opulent surroundings. There were 3 in our party and all of us had wonderful meals. 
The house special egg foo young was the best ever, anywhere. It was rich, savory with a lot of taste and the right amount of salt. So good!"}
{"text":"Two Words. THEY DELIVER!

Little known fact. Not stated on there web site. Liked the food so much I simply had to ask if they deliver as I live within 3 miles of there delivery plan.

Also conveyed to me was a 2000 person sister restaurant located in China along with an interesting fact that the owner doesn't work. He doesn't need to. Good for him/her. The chef is newly appointed from China.

Very rare (food and delivery) for a good Chinese food restaurant in Downtown Cleveland.

Great employees. Eclectic decor. Delicious food. NO MSG!

Go there."}
