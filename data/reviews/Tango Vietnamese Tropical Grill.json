{"text":"Ok place, food wasn't great.  I would probably rate it about a 2 or 3 star at most for food.  Reason for the 1 star?  Beware of some shady business practices going on here.  I went in here with my family and my parents (total of 4 adults and 2 kids).  When we were settling the bill up, the waitress tacked on an auto-gratuity of 15% without informing us.  And no where on the menu does it say they will auto-grat.    Next, my dad gave a large bill to pay for the meal, and the waitress returned without the original receipt and with the wrong change amount.  She was supposed to give back $15 but only gave back $7.  Which was weird.  So, there wasn't a way for my dad to reference the original bill, or verify the correct change amount.  So he left a tip, but asked for a copy of the receipt on the way out.  The waitress hesitated, and then after a good 5 minutes produced the receipt as we left.  Turns out (as you can see above) that she auto-gratted us, short changed us, then took a tip.  So my dad went back and demanded his tip back, which he got.  But seriously, I would have asked for the auto-grat too.   Just be ware, check your receipt, and make sure they don't swindle you."}
{"text":"I love Vietnamese food and this is one of the worst places I've ate! pho was very blan and quite pricey. Service is HORRIBLE! The waitress was very rude and it wasn't even busy! Very disappointed in this place never coming back again!"}
{"text":"Good Service, Good food will come back again and again for the green curry chicken with coconut rice... OMG it is just to die for."}
{"text":"The food there is not top quAlity.  But defiantly worth what u pay for :) it's almost the same price as the fast food ones"}
{"text":"Tango is a fairly new place that serves Thai/Vietnamese food.  I have been there a few times for lunch and overall the cuisine is good.  The one dish that earned the 5 stars (instead of the 4 that I was initially planning on giving it) for Tango is the Spiced Lemon-Grass Basa.  Superbly cooked fish with your choice of plain or coconut, white or brown rice.  A side of vegetables and some Thai inspired salsa to accompany the fish.  Insanely good stuff.  The pho bowls have a pretty flavourful broth and is one of the better places in town that I have tried.  I have not yet tried the bun but feedback from my colleagues is the bun dishes are pretty darn good.  Their spring rolls are also highly recommended, always really crunchy on the outside and yummy filling on the inside.  We visited this place for lunch again today and I had No. 85 Sliced Pork with 2 pan fried eggs on rice.  The pork was well flavoured and the eggs were cooked perfectly over easy.  Some 'bun' sauce to mix in and a delicious lunch was had!  One of the other good things about this place is they don't skim on the portion sizes.  I have trouble finishing the Basa and pad thai dishes anytime that I order them.  2 meals for the price of 1!  Prices range between approximately $9 to $17 depending on what you're having.  Next time you're in the neighbourhood and you feel like some Vietnamese/Thai food, stop by Tango!"}
{"text":"Well not sure why there are some three stars and two stars on some of the reviews here, but I would definitely go to this place to have one of the best vietnamese/thai food in Calgary. I give it a 4 star, as it will not be a place you will leave saying the food was amazing, but very places in Calgary is. The food is however definitely really good and well priced. Service was great and staffs are friendly. I love the interior and good for any occasion."}
{"text":"I strongly suggest you find another place for pho .... the food was maybe 3 stars and the service was 1 star so i meet in the middle with a 2 star rating. We had beef vermicelli- pretty simple stuff. But the beef was lacking flavor and had the weirdest texture. The meat spring rolls were not great but i will give the veggie spring rolls a thumbs up. Service was horrible- worst service ive had in a while. Pricey pho  Definitely better Vietnamese cuisine out there and for a better price."}
{"text":"At my last visit we ordered a Thai curry which was really disappointing. They seem to be good with pho and vermicelli, but not with all the dishes."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and their food is pretty good, depends on what you order though. We ordered their sweet amd sour beef stirfry on rice and lettuce wrap spring rolls and a sate pho. for the price rhe food is fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"The sate beef pho is one probably the best Ive had in the city. Everything else I've ordered has been amazing as well. Unjust negative reviews."}
{"text":"My last few visits to Pho Tango haven't been very pleasant. I'm all for second chances, but the consistency of poor quality food and horrible service is enough for me to say i'll never go back. Many times i've waited over a half hour just to place an order. Also, when having a table for two the food isn't brought out at the same time. Sometimes my guest has been finishing their meal when i get mine.  My last and final visit i was served pho with over cooked noodles and a glass of water with lip stick on the rim of the cup. Being one of two customers in the restaurant you'd think that service wouldn't be so bad? Wrong, The staff has a good habit of hiding in the kitchen until payment is due. It took over 15 minutes for a staff member to come out from the kitchen to bring me another glass of water. To finish off i paid the bill in full without even a sorry from the staff.  I like the pho here, but won't support this type of service anymore."}
{"text":"Just finished eating here and am stuffed to the brim. The portion sizes were huge! For a starter I got the single serving Wonton soup which was enough to feed two. My husband got the salad rolls which he thought were good minus the mint leaf which threw off the flavours. The lemongrass chicken satay was delicious with a kick of spice and the tropical chicken satay was a little on the bland side but still good. Our waitress was super pleasant. All in all, it was a great dinner and we walked away with tons of leftovers! I recommend it!"}
{"text":"Just finished eating here and praying I do not get a sick tummy. We won't come back here. Service not good, floors were really dirty and we were the only ones inside at 515pm on a Friday evening. Telling. Hubby ordered the Bun with grilled chicken which came cold. You apparently have to ask to have it warmed up for which the staff advised they use a microwave. Don't want to know that. He gave his meal a 2 star. I had the seafood satay pho. Meh. Was not served hot, noodles were a tad overcooked and it was an odd 'creamy' style satay. 2 stars. No dessert offered, just the bill. We got our tea at the end of our meal. Hardly acceptable."}
{"text":"Was hoping to post a photo of the disgusting slop that was supposedly sate beef in my sub. I was unable to get the steak knife I was given through the sub. When I opened it to see why, I was met with a nauseating pile of beef fat, gristle and veins. A very uninviting shade of gray with nary a drop of sate sauce in sight. I literally would not have fed that to a dog. Found out recent new owners which may explain the drastic change in food quality and the painfully slow service. Had I waited any longer for my Vietnamese iced coffee to drip I would have been late getting back from my lunch break. Will never return here again."}
{"text":"Was looking for a neighborhood eat that we hadnt been to before. IT WAS SO GOOD. The spring rolls are to die for. Its upscale interior surprised us in a good way and the food was ALL amazing. And fast."}
{"text":"Food is fantastic!! Service is excellent!  Went in this past Wednesday for a business lunch and the waitress  wasn't pushy when we were taking awhile to review the menu while we discussed some things right off the bat. Very friendly every time I go in even just for take out. The place is very nicely decorated and furnished."}
{"text":"As we have just moved back to Calgary we are reestablishing our routines and schedules, and rediscovering our city. Tango provided the best pho we have had in a long time, crtainly better than anything we found in Edmonton. The broth was clear and delicately flavoured but not cheap and watery. Sprouts, lime and basil were fresh and plentiful, and the noodles were toothsome but not chewy.  Fantastic value, amazing quality.  When we sat down, a table of the city's finest was just settling their bill.  Decor high end, but perhaps they spent too much on swanky light fixtures. Washrooms clean and stylish Service attentive but not intrusive.  Bravo."}
{"text":"NOT FOR VEGETARIANS!!  Terrible.  I wanted Bun but with just extra veggies and no meat or spring rolls.  The lady working seemed to not understand what I was wanting so I asked if I could do lemon grass beef Bun but with veggies instead of beef, no springs and an extra Bun fish sauce that would come with it.   Got home and opened up this weird stir fried, sloppy mess; a far cry from Bun.  I called her and explained that I wanted Bun with bean sprouts, lettuce, carrots and rice noodles not a stir fry.  I went back and she gave me just rice noodles and veggies, which was fine but instead of the sauce that comes with the Bun she poured straight up fish sauce into two containers and left it at that. I ended up just eating the veggies and tofu out of the original stir fried mess and realized there were chunks of chicken all through it which means that they didn't clean out the pan from the last order they made. Will definitely not go back."}
{"text":"Tango is one of, if not the best place to get pho in Calgary. They use coconut milk in the broth which adds more of a consistency than the other places. Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"Ooooh Tango! Why the whack they've called it like that - no idea. This place is as remote to tango as a greyhound bus.  But the food was good! And the portions were not just huge, they were *overwhelming*... Like, dude, you ask for a \"medium\" soup, and they bring you a bowl size of an SUV tire. And you are like: \"That's medium? Oh wow, and what's full-size?\" And they are like: \"Oh, it's about double of that...\" Even the chop-sticks were a size of hockey sticks there.  Scary!  I always had troubles getting out of the table after pushing that huge a portion all the way down to my stomach. Yep, gained some pounds there, because it was cheap and we were going to Tango for a long-lunch' trips.  So really, if you are hungry and stuck around the Calgary International airport - do not hesitate to drop in. With outrageous prices of the taxis you will at least make your belly happy and positive. :-)"}
{"text":"I came with some friends and was impressed with the interior design of Tango. I felt like I was in a modern bistro, you can tell the owners invested quite heavily in the look and feel of the restaurant.   With the design in mind, the menu's prices were reasonable. Not exactly inexpensive, nor expensive either.  The food however, was quite disappointing. My friends had the chicken sate noodles and the house special pho, both which were received by complaints of suffering from blandness and lack of taste. I ordered a rice dish, which was supposed to have shredded as well as charbroiled pork. The shredded pork was fine, however the \"charbroiled\" version seemed pan fried, without any sort of grill taste. Also 'com' dishes are served with fish sauce, which I had to ask for.  We went around 11AM and was the sole table of customers, however we found the service a bit slow. When we paid for our bill, we waited a while for our change. We paid using a $100 bill and received a lot of toonies and loonies as I think the restaurant didn't carry a large enough float.   Overall, disappointing.  My friend said his review would be summed up as, \"nice interior and that's about it.\""}
