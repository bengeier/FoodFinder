{"text":"Great little restaurant.. I'm the king of kabob and this place is like my Kingdom.. Great friendly service and the food is great.. Very fresh and home made.."}
{"text":"Delicious food, great people - I love family run restaurants. No matter how far it is for me, I would come back. Definitely recommend, although it is a bit small and the outside isn't the most aesthetic, the food makes it worth it!"}
{"text":"Authencity of the dishes and traditional methods to cooking as well as eating (abgosht) not to mention friendly service with smiles all around make this a neighbourhood favourite of mine!!!  must TRY it's a hidden gem where quality meets homemade goodness  tell em' I sent you"}
{"text":"Highly recommended.. if you are looking for high  quality fresh food, this is the place to go...best customer service and the staff is extremely friendly going out of their way to make you feel comfortable. A very cozy, home a way from home feel. They also do catering which is what I use for all my family events."}
{"text":"Very tasty food, very friendly service. 

The server helped us figure out what to order and explained everything on their small menu, and the chef joked with us while we were waiting. There is a big TV over the door playing Iranian (?) music videos.

The food was incredibly tasty (though I wish they had some greens we could get, other than the onion, radish and parsley garnish).

The place is a bit hidden, it's on the side of the building, the street side, not the parking side.

Very limited seating and VERY casual, but a great vibe overall."}
{"text":"Sardab is located amongst what I like to designate as Kabab Alley.
A stretch of road between Finch and Steeles along the ever busy Yonge street.
I can never drive pass the area without smelling like a piece of succulent Meat.
Often you'll see Smoke Signals as well from Outdoor Grills[Super Khorak].

Sardab a restaurant space facing a side street makes hungry minds curious.
Little cosy Patio and no English words on cuisine types/styles makes you wonder.
Man inside the Patio sees us and gives us more motivation to join him inside.
Wander within shows pedestrian Persian Take-out slash non-fancy Dining.
The female of the Family run-style welcomes us further as we look on Menu Wall.

Vaziri ($10.99) - Ground Beef & Chicken Leg

I pick up the Vaziri from the counter and the Lady tells me to sprinkle RED stuff.
She commented that it's Healthy.  Nice of her to keep my Health & Fitness in mind.
Somagh(powdered Sumac) as I later found out supposedly gives lemony flavours.

One look shows evidence that this is as Family-style as it gets, typical routine.
The Meats are as good as I've had at various other Pars Food Joints in Toronto.
What makes this one stand-out for me is the Tea offering at the back.    3.5'd

Self-serve Tea free-of-charge makes this place more comforting than others.
Tea, the signal of an end to a pleasant Meal and beginning of good conversation.
As we sipped away relaxing, digesting, and thinking of our next destination ahead.

I do enjoy myself the Friendliness of the smaller family-run Persian shops much more."}
{"text":"Based on the reviews, we popped in here for dinner after work on Thursday to check it out. I was a little surprised at how small the place is but it does seat approximately 16 people - albeit quite tightly!

The prices, compared to other Kebab shops in the area, are quite good. Koobideh for $6.99? I'm in! They also offer complimentary, self serve Persian tea! Yay!

The Koobideh itself was the juiciest I've ever had. Later, after talking with the owner, I learned that he only uses AAA Angus beef (with approximately 20% fat) which he grinds himself. You can definitely taste the difference. Everything, even the rice, was delicious!

Just a side note: They don't accept credit cards - cash or debit only."}
{"text":"We had the koobideh (cooked medium) and the barg (cooked \"juicy\"). Both were tender, juicy and flavourful - the koobideh was especially good! The service was friendly and the parking convenient. The only downside: It was a little hard to find because it was at the back of the plaza."}
{"text":"Honestly, when I saw the outside... I was asking myself where am I? Is this the right place? It was, and it is small, but I think that is the charm of this gem of a restaurant! The food was delicious, cooked to perfection and tastes very fresh! On top of that free self serve tea! The owners were very kind and sweet people, and smile a lot... You can tell they love their business! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"this was an amazing experience tuely home made food the chef Hossein is truly the best in the business"}
{"text":"Amazing family run restaurant. Small and cozy, no fancy dining cost, but you still get the fancy quality of the food. I would definitely recommend coming here. Great kabob and jujeh!"}
{"text":"Is Sardab Restaurant another Kebab place just like one of the numerous in this area?

Vaziri ($10.99) - Ground Beef and Chicken Leg

Tender and Juicy Ground Beef! One of the best one I ever have! Chicken Leg is well flavoured with a nice hint of citrus! Portion is great to share or for my friend probably can just lick the plate clean!

And how about a cup of hot tea at the end of our meal?! That's heavenly even on a hot afternoon... 

Free parking can be a little tight as it is shared with other businesses in the plaza.

Maybe I should come back and try the lamb?"}
{"text":"Best persian food out there, as I am very picky. The staff is extremely friendly and they seem to have a great customer base. I have seen a lot of familiar faces. 

The place itself is a cozy home away from home feel. It is mostly for take out, catering, and delivery.. But you and also sit and dine both inside and outside on the patio. 

FANTASTIC catering and delivery service! 
I found them from a party I had attended, Sardab provided the catering. 

BEST SALADS ! 
The sauce for the salad dressing is to die for!"}
