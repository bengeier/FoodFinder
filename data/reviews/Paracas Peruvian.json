{"text":"Came in as a walk off from street.  Ordered ceviche thinking it had to be good.   The food was terrible.  The whole thing was sitting in lemon soup.  It was so sour i cousnt eat more than a bite.   Worst experience ever.  

Will never go back"}
{"text":"On second visit I've come to the conclusion my prior review was overly harsh, this is a four stars restaurant. The fish is very fresh and well prepared, the service is friendly and the ambience is comforting."}
{"text":"The food maybe ok for a non-Peruvian. As a Peruvian this is maybe the worst Peruvian restaurant I have visited in Toronto. The ceviche was clearly prepared the day before (overcook and out of the fridge), the jalea has almost no fish on it and it is only lettuce,  the anticucho and the lomo saltado was ok not greta....there is better places  in Toronto"}
{"text":"I'm updating my earlier review, but still 5 stars!

Are you tired of downtown hipster joints that charge you $12 for a \"sharing plate\" that's so small you guard it with your life? Have you grown weary of these douche caves serving you octopus and ceviche and acting like it's something new to Toronto?

Paracas has been serving this stuff up for years in generous portions with nary a pair of skinny jeans in sight! Of course, if you speak Spanish, you have an advantage. If you want to eat delicious Peruvian delights, you're definitely in the right place! Ask Pepe, the owner for a recommendation on what to eat and drink if you are unsure. Service is always helpful.

This is a true mom and pop place with all the charm and value you'd expect. Sit back and enjoy the fire and garlic of the orange habernero sauce. Have a pisco sour or huge litre of sangria that's spiked with cloves and cinnamon (not to mention alcohol) and soak in the wonderful food, service and atmosphere of Paracas.

Possibly my favourite restaurant in the city."}
{"text":"Overall it's ok, but it's too expensive for what it is. Breaded chicken breast costs $22, and it was  so-so.
The menu is quite big making it hard to decide. 
Our service was quite slow due to a backed up kitchen but the owner was nice enough to treat us to a round of drinks. 
When paying my bill, it turned out a dish go missed so I got two bills. 
I don't regret coming here, but I don't know if I'll be back."}
{"text":"We had a delicious Estofado de Pollo (Chicken Stew) and Lomo Saltado (Cooked in a real Wok) and a Causa Rellena as an appetizer. It couldn't be more delicious. Good service. Taste is worth the price."}
{"text":"How have a lived so close to this place and never gone?! What a dummy!

I came here with a half dozen friends. We each picked a dish off the menu (no easy feat) and shared everything. 

Everything was amazing: balanced flavours, good texture, excellent use of spices. The beef hearts made us all groan in joy. They were cooked medium rare and had a fantastic bite to them. The baby goat stew was meaty, and addictive. We considered ordering another. The paella was the best I've ever had. The rice was cooked PERFECTLY and the fish melted in your mouth. The steak was more well done than I like, but the crusty char more than made up for it. We also had a mixed meat platter with ribs, chorizo and lamb. Scrumptious. The hot sauces that accompanied the meal were out of this world. One was blended with parsley or coriander. I could have drank it from a glass. 

The ambiance is also wonderful. The staff is warm and the decor makes you feel like you are in another part of the world. Peru maybe, I don't know. I've never been there. 

This is my new favourite spot in the neighbourhood. Standing ovation."}
{"text":"I'm giving five stars to this charmin place, because we enjoyed authentic and delicious flavors; we were treated like friends; and because \"Don Pepe\" is a fantastic character.

We went on Tuesday night. There was only one table of six people debating about life and it's vicissitudes, so, at the beginning I felted out of place cuz we were on celebration/party mode. However, Don Pepe, the wine, the Pisco, and the food made us forget about the pretentious talk, and transported us to Perú.

We ordered anticuchos de corazón; papa huancaina; chupé de mariscos; and paella de mariscos.

In every single bite of the anticuchos, I felted love and exotic flavors. The red salsa Pepe brought like a sider, with the bread, was spicy and with notes of ginger (pleasantly surprised).

The chupe de mariscos was the perfect soup for warm up the soul in a cold era. So tasty!!! It doesn't ask anything to the Pho, Ramen, etc... This soup by itself is like a meal.

The paella had crab, lobster, shrimps, clams, and a lot of character. The white corn made it really special.

I just would advice the place to perform some of those sweet Pisco cocktails we girls like, cuz Pisco sour, for a stubborn Mexican like me, tasted like a bad margarita...

Gracias don Pepe por el pastel y la calidez. Nos vemos pronto!!!"}
{"text":"Ummmm... what the hell was that? Was the sentiment I felt after dining at Paracas. Upon initial entry, everything seemed to have a layer of dust on it, from the out of place wooden clown to the oversized glassware. It was as though one had gotten in a time machine, gone back to the 90s and found themselves in a restaurant that had closed several years earlier. Though the hours indicated they were open until 10 (and we were there at 7:30), half of the lights were off on one side of the restaurant. Nothing but a pale flicker of a television as our waiter (the only waiter) sat idly watching as we choked down our food. Now finally, to the food. It was edible but that's about as far as it goes. \"Authentic Peruvian\" if that means poor quality ingredients, lazily slapped on a dish drowned in a pool of sauce. You've been warned. There are plenty of other Peruvian restaurants near by unless you want to take a trip to the sub par Peruvian twilight zone."}
{"text":"A true hidden gem in the city. This is a restaurant where meatlovers meet seafood at the intersection of flavour. 

Everything i tried was excellent and it's been a long time since i've enjoyed dinner this much and have been so impressed by new yet familiar flavours. 

The sauces are what makes everything really interesting. They clearly know how to cook seafood, and slow cook meats (but you might not get a perfect medium rare steak here) but the sauces is what takes every dish to whole new level. When they start your meal off, they bring you a generous basket of bread and you wonder how anyone could go through all of that - then you realize you can when the sauce your dipping in is that good. 

Standout dishes for me are the baby goat and the beef hearts. 


I sincerely can't wait to come back for another meal."}
{"text":"It's good food, sometimes too salty. Makes me think that they do it on purpose so that one consumes more alcohol.  The sangria taste good.. a bit pricey, especially if they won't drain the red cloves from the sangria. Try the jalea.. which is flour dusted  seafood like calamari and other seafood tid bits.. deep fried. Also try the lomo salteado.. its  beef strips with french fries  sauteed with onions and tomato... a hint of sesame oil to boost its flavor-full-ness... all on a bed of rice. Its pricey,, but service is good.. so depending on the girth of your wallet.. thread carefully."}
{"text":"Amazing service, delicious dishes, decadent desserts. This place is amazing and I make sure to visit it every single year for my birthday."}
{"text":"I called to order take out and was rudely told that they will not take orders over the phone unless you have been there before. Usually I would have avoided an establishment for that kind of silliness but I had read that their ceviche was really good so I went anyway. Whoever wrote that their ceviche is good must not know much about it"}
{"text":"We were driving on St. Clair West and randomly found this restaurant as many were not open on a Monday night. The first impression was that the place looked closed, despite the only couple sitting at the entrance. Barely any lights were on in the restaurant and no one greeted us upon entering. We sat down and found the prices to be a little higher than expected. Nice salsa music was playing in the background and we eventually agreed on the baby goat and grilled salmon. 

The servings were huge and impressive (we both needed take out containers). The baby goat was a stew but it came on a plate that made it a bit difficult to eat especially without a spoon for the sauce. The sauce was very flavourful however one side of the goat felt a bit chewy. The grilled salmon was done to perfection with a nice flakiness to the meat and crispy outer layer. The dill sauce was delish! A flavour that I've never had before, a nice tangy sweetness to the salmon. The grilled vegetables were a nice touch to the dish. 

The food was worth stopping for, but the ambiance was a bit lacking with the cold air, lack of lighting and not the cleanest bathrooms for a more fancy place. They did try to set the mood with slower romantic music after seeing we were the only couple in the restaurant."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat when I'm in Toronto. A mom and pop shop with great flavors and freshly made food everyday! Everything I order here is amazing from their cow's heart, ceviche, to their seafood paella! Their lemon veal is to die for! 

If you want great authentic food and great service, this place is a must!"}
