{"text":"Been here a couple times and always had a enjoyable time. The atmosphere is real chill."}
{"text":"Great place to check out the games, and with the 20 beers on tap, there is never a dull decision,"}
{"text":"Came here twice now and I must say it's a hit or miss type of place. First time I had a great meal..their chicken wing platter was really good. However, more recently I tried their parmesan chicken sandwich and it wasn't the best experience. The food tasted like something from a regular grocery store. Could be the item I ordered but will likely try their wings again."}
{"text":"We went there with a few friends on a Saturday night and it was a pleasant stay. We had the seafood platter and some burgers. The platter was good but the burger (Queen's Angus) I had wasn't that great. It didn't taste like much. The combination of the stuff that was on it didn't seem to be a good one. I don't know how the rest of their food is but I wouldn't go there for their burgers. Just plane and flavourless but that's my personal opinion.

The place itself is quite cozy and they got TV's everywhere but it seemed they were understaffed and people who came in and waited at the entrance to be seated seemed confused when none of the staff would show up for minutes or not at all. 

Despite that it's still a good place to spend the night once in a while."}
{"text":"This honestly was one of the worst places myself and my partner have been to. The food was super bland ( I had the steak and mushroom pie) and it tasted like dog food. The mashed potatoes and vegetables were cold and and had no seasoning to them. As for the wings they were very small and were nothing to write home about. The service was not good, the waitress didn't know the menu and wasn't very talented (took away pints before they were done). She should of written down the orders and she had made a mistake on the meals. She did try her best but it seemed she was in over her head. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone if they wanted to go for food, but the restaurant itself looked nice and I would maybe try to go for a drink but nothing else."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, great service and a comfy welcoming place. Large portions, so bring an appetite or be prepared to share or bring food home. We will definitely be coming back here again!"}
{"text":"This is my second visit of many more to come. It's a comfortable place with super friendly staff. The food is delicious and comes in very large portions. I'm especially impressed that the manager has been on the floor both times and assists serving tables. It's nice to see a manager who is visible and approachable and obviously very much involved. I have only written 2 reviews here because for me to write one I have to be over the top impressed. It's definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"Food was amazing. Service was great but the uniform might need an update. How short can skirts get...."}
{"text":"I arrived at the pub and ordered a coors lite. The beer had a huge head on it that I let settle to 3/4 of an inch below the rim. I asked the bartender on the next pint to eliminate the head. She laboriously poured the next pint, scooping and filling, scooping and filling, and placed yet another pint in front of me with a huge head. 
 Shortly there after the manager was out testing another pump for air(my mistake), and I made an offhand remark that none of them seemed to be able to pour a pint.
 After the manager/owner left, the girl, who seemed miffed, enquired of me whether I was happy or not with her pour. I thought I might give a tip on how to pour a proper pint without head. This did not please her and I was told by her that she knew how to pour beer and was insulted and demeaned by my statement. 
 This girl was all of 22 yrs old and determined to be correct without sensibility and I must state that I felt affronted. I think further training of staff is required at this establishment. I stated to the young lady that this was my first and last visit to that establishment. I left a $5.00 tip even though it was undeserved.
My point is this, if you are running a new establishment, you want to attract customers, not castigate them.

{"text":"If I could give it half a star I would. I have been to many bars in my lifespan, but this bar is by far the worst I have ever been to. STAY AWAY! FAR AWAY! The waitress are very unprofessional and unpleasant. Never greeted my family and I. Took forever to take our order. I say it took the waitress 20 mins before they acknowledged our presence. Once my order was taken, it took like 45 mins for it to come out. The pasta I ordered was soggy and cold. My son asked for bbq wings but they gave him hot wings. Once we told the waitress the issue, the girl mumbled something under her breath and gave us attitude. HORRIBLE. This place has zero respect for there customers and should go away, quickly."}
