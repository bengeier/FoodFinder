{"text":"Nous avons essayé les crevettes à l'ail, les dumplings au porc, le riz frit aux crevettes et le poulet kung pow. Tout était très frais et bien assaisonné. Le service était rapide et courtois. restaurant très propre, au décor moderne. À essayer!"}
{"text":"What a letdown!! I went by the reviews here and decided to eat at that restaurant based on the glowing reviews. What a disappointment. The menu was very limited and I ordered beef dumplings and shrimp fried rice. Both were bland and had no taste. The rice had very little shrimp, and was super oily and had only peas and corn. The dumplings had no taste whatsoever. The other thing I noticed was the cook was outside a lot smoking! I don't know why this place had all these reviews. It was terrible."}
{"text":"special dish if you preorder. Nice to try! The mandarin fish is so yummy! And all the foods are fresh made by chef! This is definitely the best Chinese restaurant in the town!Hope to come back again!"}
{"text":"I think taste wise, the food here is in the upper tier in comparison to other Chinese restaurants in Montreal and I would definitely give this 5 stars. However I think I would take off 0.5 of a star because the portion sizes are a bit too small. If only the portions are a bit bigger! 

It offers a more authentic menu of Chinese dishes where you would see ingredients such as Chinese yam. The dishes I've tried are seasoned beautifully and they really let their natural flavours shine through. I especially took a liking to their utensils and plates used. It's a pale turquoise colour which is a refreshing change from the usual white plates you would usually see.

This restaurant is actually right stab center in downtown but I guess it's hidden amongst nearby office buildings that I never really took notice of it. Those of you who haven't tried this place yet, I think you would be pleasantly surprised!"}
{"text":"One of the most authentic Chinese Restaurants in Montreal. The thoughtful decor and guzheng artist create a wonderfully traditional atmosphere that reminds me of the restaurants in China. The menu is unique and authentic, and all the dishes that we ordered were delicious. :)"}
{"text":"Because of the recommandation of my friend, I came to JCer to try their sour soup beef, a Guizhou dish that I tried and liked when I traveled in China. I wasn't disappointed but I have to admit that the taste wasn't stunning. The beef was tender but not really savoury. The vegetable we order was okay but again nothing special. However, what enhanced my dining experience is the low noise level and the great interior decor filled with beautiful details in the restaurant. The decor is really amazing and I was really delighted by the visual impact of this decor. The price is a bit higher than other Chinese restaurant, but it is quite okay because of the food ambiance and beautiful decor."}
{"text":"A rare example of Huaiyang-style cuisine.  Everything we ordered was fabulous (5+ different entrees)!  The staff was very helpful describing the meals to us, and making recommendations.  We had the rubs (!!), kung pao chicken, roasted pumpkin, seasonal vegetables & fried rice.  In another nice touch, the owner came out to ask how we were enjoying the meal, and how his chef was specially trained--in China--in the Huaiyang style.  Nice atmosphere to boot."}
{"text":"The decor is really nice, new, and clean. It has a quiet and relaxing atmosphere as the place is fairly new and there is not much customers in there while I was there. The plates are beautiful and are from the same set ( turquoise ? Blue green ? David's tea colour ?) It is suppose to be a classy Chinese restaurant that gives a different kind of feeling ( as in not the typical Chinese restaurant feel you would find in China town)
I ordered a few dishes with my friends but I couldn't remember those names. The chicken was juicy, some spicy dish has just the right spiciness. Everything taste great. But the only reason for giving them 4 stars is that I feel like the portion is smaller than it should be. 
All of the dishes we tried tasted really good though, the price is reasonable for this type of restaurant, it would have been a well over 5 star if the portion is just a little bit bigger. (It is close to a lot of universities like McGill, U Laval, Uqam) 
The Restaurant is kind of hidden in a office building though. Even with me passing by almost once a few day, it took me a while to notice it is a restaurant, and took me a while for my friend to convince me to go and try with them.

Overall, I would say. Good taste and atmosphere. But go eat at this restaurant only when you are not TOO Hungry or you have a lot of money to spend : )

Bon Appetit~"}
{"text":"Amazing food! Very authentic. The owner was eating behind us and made sure we got excellent service. My parents are from Shanghai and loved the food so much, they want to return tomorrow!"}
{"text":"Finally a well-decorated authentic Chinese restaurant from the region of shanghai/Hangzhou (ze jiang province). This new hidden gem includes plates like smoked fish entree, long jing tea shrimp, beer duck and shredded pork with vege. Great choices for people who want healthier and non-spicy Chinese food. Very affordable combo for business lunch.  The service is very nice but not yet familiar with their menu (i ordered a chicken soup and then a duck hot pot once, the server didn't warn me that i ordered 2 soups!)"}
