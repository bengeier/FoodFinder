{"text":"This is the best Chinese I've had in Madison so far.  The food can be a bit salty but that's par for the course with most Chinese food.  We usually order egg rolls or crab rangoons as appetizers. We've had the general Tso's chicken, moo shu chicken, lo mein, fried rice and chicken with cashew.  All are made well.  I especially like the Double Woked pork belly and the Stir Fried Pan Fried Egg Noodles. Some of the other Chef's specials look good as well but we haven't gotten a chance to check them out yet. The prices here are not as cheap as some of Madison's other Chinese restaurants but the quality definitely is high.   We've never sat down in the restaurant to eat but I've gone in to pick up the food a lot and the staff is very friendly.  One of the women even remembered me by what I usually order.  They also deliver for a small fee.  I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"We had a fantastic take out dinner from Magic Wok. We had 7 items from the menu and all of them were delicious. I was pleasantly surprised!!"}
{"text":"One of the best Chinese places in Madison!

The Gen TSO chicken is amazing.
House fried rice is different and delicious.
Chicken Lo Mein is also very good!"}
{"text":"Hands down a well rounded restaurant. Any one who has had the typical experience of average to questionable Chinese take out can take a deep breath. Magic Wok is quick, consistent and quality. No need to waste you're time checking out other \"options\" for Chinese take-out in Madison. Thank you Magic Wok!!!"}
{"text":"Are you kidding with these good reviews? Are you relatives? Lol
The WORST meal I have had since moving to the area.
Arrived at lunch to this dreary place, we were the only ones at noon which should have been a red flag. The miserable waitress barely spoke and never did crack a smile. Was she angry we were there? Ribs,2 were fatty,the other 2 tasted like they were a week old.
Ordered Sesame Shrimp and got some sort of meat, were told by Miss Crabby she made a mistake and it was chicken, (who knew,  I thought we were eating pencils erasures.) Mongolian beef had lots of rice and what may have been beef in days past. Sad, miserable place, crossed off our list to ever visit, but,
how does this place stay open?"}
{"text":"Most authentic Chinese available for delivery in Madison.  Not your typical strip mall joint!"}
{"text":"I've driven by for years but recently had a reason to stop unplanned - hungry children.  Fantastic food, generous portions.  Our family of 5 (kids 13, 11 & 9) could have been well fed with three entrees plus egg rolls.  We'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"I ordered Pad Thai Ho Fun and Salt and Pepper Shrimp. The shrimp was okay but it was covered with chopped jalapeños, which I've never seen before on this dish. The Pad Thai was super disappointing. It had tons of meat on it, no veggies, and didn't taste anything like Pad Thai. Definitely not ordering from here again."}
{"text":"If you loved the food at Orient House before the ownership change, this is the place for you.  The cook and his wife were the back of the house at the old Orient House.  Tried them for the first time tonite and were recognized immediately by the wife who tends the front of the house.  

Here's what we just had:  Chicken with Sweet Corn Soup is great with lots of chicken in the rich broth.  The Hot and Sour soup needed a little salt but had lots of veggies, tofu and cloud ear mushroom.  If you ask for a big bowl of it, it is BIG!

The steamed dumplings were some of the largest I ever saw, filled with a golf ball size helping of ground pork well cooked and seasoned; the wrapper was not thick and doughy like many dumplings and pot stickers.  And there were six dumplings instead of an odd amount, making sharing as a couple nicer.

WARNING--the portions are HUGE for the entrees.  The Moo Shu chicken had lots of chicken and crisp veggies, not too wet to keep the wrappers together.  The wrappers did not seem to be house made and were thicker but were definitely not the tortilla wrappers Orient House uses now.  It comes with four wrappers but there is enough Moo Shu for at least double that number. They also bring you a nice amount of white rice to help you finish the remaining Moo Shu.

I had the Orange Pork which came with an overly generous amount of stir fried pork in the sweet brown orange sauce with slices of orange peel in case you are into that (my peel wasn't bitter, either).  It also included broccoli florets which were crisp and bright green.

We also ordered the Sautéed Green String Beans from the vegetable section of the menu.  The beans were large and crispy with that same light sauce as Orient House but without the ground pork.  A definite keeper.

One of the things we used to enjoy about Orient House were the traditional Chinese dishes that reminded me of the wonderful food on my trips there.  I was devastated when I could no longer get my Scrambled Egg and Tomato.  So taking my old OH menu with me, I asked if the cook could make some for me and I was thrilled to again have a source for one of my favorite dishes.

It is just the cook and his wife running the restaurant so it may take a little longer for service but the food is definitely worth the wait.  I was told if we wanted to have any of the old traditional dishes prepared, just let them know ahead of time and they will be sure to have the ingredients, so that's exactly what we intend to do.

While the traditional dishes are not on the menu, from our experience ordering off the regular menu tonite, the food is high quality and well worth the trip to the east side.  The restaurant has been brightened up and is more inviting now, although the street front could use better branding so you know what you're looking at.

All in all, this will be a regular stop for us now and can't wait to tell our friends that we can once again dine on excellent Chinese fare at Magic Wok.  Give it a try."}
{"text":"We found the Magic Wok on Yelp while we were visiting Madison and it was delicious. We ordered the vegetable spring rolls, cashew chicken and Kung pow chicken (our regulars at our hometown Chinese restaurant) and were very happy. The food tastes fresh and the staff is friendly. Don't be deterred by the exterior or non decorated interior. You are in for a treat! What a gem of a restaurant."}
{"text":"The wonton soup is really good. And the man there is super friendly. If I lived closer I'd come here more often. It's not the best Chinese food I had but it was good. 
The prices are great and lunch specials are worth it. That's it"}
{"text":"I've finally found a good Chinese carryout in Aurora. The food is good, and most of all consistent. The owner is always pleasant and friendly, and it's effortless, not staged. I hope they expand, I bet that would be one comfortable dining experience."}
{"text":"Tried a few other Chinese take out places before I tried this one.  Make this place your first try,  think you'll be glad you did.  The food was fresh and the portions were huge.  The vegetables were steamed well and the chicken was great!  Egg rolls were good too!  I think they are made with rice paper,  not the wonton wraps."}
{"text":"This food is amazing. First off let me say that this place is always spotless clean. The family that runs this is always so nice and they honestly do have the best food."}
{"text":"3 stars for the friendliness of the staff, quick delivery time, fair pricing, and overall quality of ingredients, but I felt that my meal lacked flavor and spice. 

Ordered the garlic eggplant, fried rice, and an egg roll for delivery. The food came very quickly (within 30 minutes) and the woman who took my order on the phone was very warm and friendly. 

The fried rice was the highlight of the meal--decent texture, not too salty, and loaded with fresh-tasting vegetables. The egg roll was nothing special--it was pretty bland, didn't have a lot of vegetable variety in it, and I got zero nutty flavor from it, but it was crisp and not greasy, so that was a plus. The eggplant in garlic oil was not a hit for me at all. Eggplant was overcooked and mushy, the oil was overpowering and had zero garlic flavor, and though the dish was advertised as hot and spicy, it had no heat whatsoever. Not impressed. 

I probably won't order from them again unless I'm in a pinch and I want delivery Chinese food quickly. There are much better places in the Madison area--it's not worth ditching those places to give Magic Wok another try."}
{"text":"Very yummy. In a store front with limited seating. I'm thinking it is mostly a take out place. Very nice people, very clean. Said she'd put different veggies in my husbands dinner since he didn't want so many onions. Good experience, we will come back!"}
{"text":"Authentic Chinese cuisine. Recommend large bowl noodle  soups. Garlic eggplant excellent. Fast service."}
{"text":"Some fresh crunchy veggies added to the common fare made our dishes more enjoyable.  Fast takeout!"}
{"text":"This is possibly the best Chinese food in Madison. The produce tastes like it just came out of the garden, and the dishes are freshly made. I'm in a bit of a food coma  so I can't accurately describe the deliciousness, but do your taste buds a favor and eat here."}
{"text":"Former Orient House team resurfaces at last! Atmosphere is under sparse, but that's good, because your food deserves your undivided attention. You should eat here right now. And come back often."}
{"text":"I ordered a an entree and an appetizer for delivery from this place an hour and a half ago (6:15 p.m. on a Thursday night), and it still hasn't arrived. I called 15 minutes ago to inquire, and was told my order was \"on it's way.\" Being that I live one mile from the restaurant, this was obviously a lie. I'm not sure how good the food will be, if it ever arrives, but it's beside the point, because Chinese food shouldn't take 1:30 in Madison, WI on a Thursday night."}
{"text":"Very sad! Magic Wok is closed now. I went there today (11/5/17) the place was empty. I have no idea why is closed. Their food was great."}
{"text":"The first few times I ordered from Magic Wok the food was really, really great, but in the past month or so it seems to have gone way down hill-- the lo mein is greasy and flavorless and the moo shu is advertised as coming with \"four pancakes\" but it actually came with four stale tortillas (as in mexican tortillas) that are clearly mass produced and not made in house.  The moo shu filling at least was pretty good, but overall I am unimpressed lately with the quality.  I hope it is just a small setback and they'll get back on track, because this used to be some of my favorite chinese in Madison."}
{"text":"Incredibly consistent and very good Chinese food! All fresh, seemingly not frozen so even the Sweet and Sour Chicken seems healthier than those counter only joints. Sesame Eggplant is dynamite; its sauce goes great on any of the other dishes. Sweet and Sour Fish excellent too. Very friendly young family running the place and we're really grateful to have great Chinese cuisine in the neighborhood!!"}
{"text":"Yummy food. General Tso's is pretty decent. Egg drop soup is very good."}
{"text":"Only came by for take-out, it was fast,correct, parking was not a problem on this day and it is close to Players bar if you need to kill some time! The egg foo young is good! Thanks for the tip Chy."}
{"text":"We were hot, tired and hungry... Was looking for some place close, but hit the delivery button instead. We had fried potstickers, fried rice with chicken, bbq pork and shrimp and sesame tofu (our faves forever). The order arrived within 30 minutes, steaming hot, and at least $5 less than any other place! 

The dumplings seem to be homemade and perfectly chewy. The filling was was very tasty and not greasy at all. There were 2 meals worth for each entrée, plenty of meat in the rice and the fried tofu was some of the best I've had in Madison. Next time we'll try dining in and maybe at lunchtime. Definitely under-rated, especially for the $5/serving."}
{"text":"Chinese food exactly how you would expect it. Tonight, for 2, we ordered spring rolls, crab rangoons and the seafood special. All were great. I really enjoyed the vegetables in our main dish. These two apps and the entree was just the right amount of food. Delivery did take a little over an hour to be delivered on a Sunday night. I would order here again."}
{"text":"I've eaten here 6 times, including one time with 7 friends and have been very pleased, as were my friends. I would say this, along with Double 10, are the 2 best Chinese restaurants in Madison and I've eaten at most of them.

They seem to do a lot of take out but they have never been busy when I've been there. This is definitely a great, local restaurant that deserves your support!"}
{"text":"I've tried a few Chinese places in Madison until I found the one I liked, Double 10. I was sad to hear Double 10 closed recently, so I had to search for a new place to go. This place had decent reviews on Yelp so I decided to give it a try. The only downside to this place was that it's a 20 minute drive from my place. 

They have an online ordering website for easy ordering, except they have a small fee for processing your order online (lame!). So what did I do? I called them instead and it didn't cost me a thing. They are quick! They said my order would be ready in 10 minutes. We came half an hour before they closed and they had everything set to go for us. 

We ordered the Chef Special #1: sizzling pork belly with red chili in black bean sauce. Chef Special #10: walnut shrimp. Vegetarian 200: Szechuan style green beans.

The sizzling pork belly was something new for the both of us and we were pleasantly surprised with how good it was coming in with only the thought that it sounded good. Thank goodness we chose right! It's something we order over and over again each time we go back, and we also ask for it to be made extra spicy. The walnut shrimp was also really really good, except we were really really sad at how small the portion was. It left us wanting more. Finally, the Szechuan style green beans were absolutely awesome! We also asked for these to be made extra spicy, just the way we like it. The green beans were still crunchy and not soggy and soft. The Szechuan sauce is fantastic.

All in all, this is the best Chinese place that we have found in Madison so far. We make that effort to drive the 20 minutes to pick up the food here and it's so worth it.

During later visits, we have ordered General Tso's chicken, eggplant with hot garlic sauce, and double woked pork belly, to name a few. Everything is delicious!"}
{"text":"I love Chinese food. Well, I really love Egg Foo Young, and I order it nearly every time I eat Chinese. This was probably the best Egg Foo Young I've ever had. It was outstanding, and a huge portion. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Still the best Chinese in the area and the owners are always pleasant and eager to serve!"}
{"text":"Here I am back again two years later. I eat here sporadically ( so many options) and I feel compelled to update my review.

The last two times I visited Magic Wok I found the food and service to be superlative. Crispy chicken egg roll, Mongolian chicken, Stir fried, pan fried noodles, hot and spicy vegetables and oh, those amazing Szechuan green beans! I am also a fan of their vegetarian hot and sour soup. Each dish has a personality of its own. Servings are generous and the waitress has a great memory as to what we eat and how we like it... Medium hot, no MSG, mustard with the egg roll.

The restaurant is often empty or there a few folks scattered about. The take- out flies out the door and that seems to be their bread and butter. I see that the building is for sale. I hope Magic Wok will stay and that the restaurant would get a facelift. A liquor license would also increase their eat-in devotees.

Eat-in or take- out, either way you will be pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"This was a very good delivery choice.  The general Tso was very good tasting and of good quality ingredients, but I ordered it spicy and it was not even close to spicy.  Not even a little spicy.  My wife order the kung pow which was much better than the general tso.  It was perfectly spicy and had a great blend of ingredients.  Overall the price was ok.  There is certainly a lot of competition for asian delivery places in the area, so its a toss up with some of my other local favorites."}
{"text":"One of the more decent Chinese places that offers delivery. Food came about 35 minutes after I ordered. Their crab Rangoon did not have much filling. I ordered their beef with broccoli and General Tso's Chicken, you are able to get it mild, medium spicy. I ordered medium, could have used a little more heat to it. Both were tasty. Would likely order from them again."}
{"text":"Finally a delivery chinese cuisine,  both, my husband and I could love! Crab Rangoon and sauce were awesome! The general tso chicken was our fave!"}
{"text":"Not bad, not great. 

The general tso's was delicious. It had a nice flavor, nice bite sized pieces. The sweet n sour chicken was good (the chicken itself)- good breading, not greasy- the sauce was excessively watery, where I am used to a much thicker sauce rather than liquid. The flavor was good though, if they could thicken it up some. The crab rangoon was great. It was light and crispy, good flavored, and again, the sauce is the same as the sweet n sour sauce, liquid, not sauce.

The wonton soup was a disaster. The broth was flavorless, the wontons were so overcooked they fell apart, and I have never had wonton with large pea pods and large pieces of onions.

I might add, I am from New York so used to NY Chinese, and am on the hunt locally in Madison for a place to frequent, and I don't think it will be this one. Sorry."}
{"text":"Disclaimer - I'm from SF originally, so I'm pretty much a Chinse food snob. I gave up on ever finding really good Sichuan or Hunan or Hong Kong or even Mandarin food in the Midwest long ago.  That said, this is pretty darned good!

I was feeling poorly and wanted some comfort food delivered.  I ordered the Sichuan String Beans (spicy) and the Pork with Scallions.  The food came quickly and was hot and fresh.  The string beans were almost spicy, and if I had ordered \"very spicy\" I probably would have been satisfied.  I realize that most of the Asian restaurants in Madison cater to the bland midwestern palate, so I don't blame them for that. More importantly, the beans were FRESH and CRISPY and flavorful.  The Pork was also very Umami and garlicky in that greasy comfort-food way that Americanized Chinese food can be.  

In sum, I wouldn't choose it over Ichiban or Zen Zen Taste for serious chinese dine-in.  But the comfort food dpartment, it is first rate!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese restaurant in Madison! Orange chicken, friend rice, dumplings, and lo mein are scrumptious. Service is extremely friendly and excellent!"}
{"text":"This is a step up from your average Chinese restaurant. You can really taste and see the quality of the ingredients they use. I go to other places and it's obvious they just thawed out a frozen bag of veggies and threw it in the dish. Everything tastes fresh here. I originally went to get a quick fix for a Chinese craving and left very impressed. The House Special Fried Rice is a little spicy, aromatic, and totally addicting. Their streamed dumplings seem a little sturdier than the ones I've gotten elsewhere. I really enjoy the ho fun (wide rice noodle) dishes. Delectable flavor with tender noodles. The prices are average for the neighborhood, for a one person order maybe $8-12. I definitely recommend this place if you want Chinese, but are tired of low quality ingredients or sloppy preparation. They get it done right and are friendly to boot."}
{"text":"I love this place.  I was away for 4 months & looked forward to coming back so I could come here.  When I got home I ordered something that I have never had before, & probably won't ever order again.  It's the Garlic Chicken.  I love garlic, but this is just too salty.  I think that they use garlic salt instead of fresh garlic.  Everything else that I have had here has been great."}
{"text":"Sometimes we forget about this place as there are two other Lao places close by.  But OMG is this place good.  Best Chinese  we've had in Madison.  Atmosphere is nothing great, but the food!  Try some of the chef's specials!  Sizzling beef was amazing.  MooShoo also delicious.  They do a ton of carry out, but darn is it good.  Now on our rotation!"}
{"text":"I've gotten food from here twice, take out both times. I ordered the cashew chicken a few months ago, and found when I got home that I was given the cashew chicken, but no rice. The food itself was delicious and I was lucky I had rice in my home, but it put a damper on the experience. When I wrote back Magic Wok through Eat24, they asked what I would like to be done about it. I said preferably to be sent some rice (I had already changed into my pajamas), or if they couldn't do that, to refund me the price of the rice. They then quickly notified that the cost of the rice would be refunded:

Then, Wednesday night my boyfriend and I ordered more. Cashew chicken (allergy friendly, thank you) for me, sesame chicken for him, and two spring rolls. When we got home with the bag, we opened it to find only half of the rice was there. Maybe I should've checked considering what happened last time, but I figured that was a one time thing. I was a little frustrated, but we had more rice at my apartment again.

I will still likely go back because the actual food was good, but will be certain to make sure that they don't skip on the rice from now on."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews I decided to call for some info if they have a buffet or menu. The guy on the phone was rude. So i decided not to go to the place. Angry people stay away from the phone !!!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese food around..haven't had a bad meal.everything is wonderful..Owners are very friendly and will take special request..very reasonable..hope they stay around a long time..highly reccomend."}
{"text":"Delivery with NO eating utensils. Ugh!!! Shrimp fried rice and soup. But nothing to eat with and no napkins. 

I tried to eat my rice with coffee streets I had in my hotel room ."}
{"text":"Delivery on Sunday evening was about an hour. No problem!  It was dinner time. 
The fried dumplings were okay. I'll get spring rolls next time. Egg drop soup was hot and it's a huge order! Although a little bland, it was decent. It was disappointing not to get the green onions pictured on the menu. Would make a huge difference in flavor.  Beef Lo Mein was very good. The noodles are done perfectly. But no veggies to speak of except an onion or two. Based on reviews and pictures I'd expected a bit more. 
I'll order again and see what happens!"}
{"text":"This is the second time the estimated time was 45-1 hour and the food came after 1:45-2 hours. Plan accordingly. Disappointed"}
{"text":"This place honestly has some of the best Chinese food you can find anywhere. Their lunch specials are a decent value but the real stars are their house specials and fried rice. I have tried most of the house specials now and they have all been excellent."}
{"text":"Dang, so good!!! We are in town from California and stopped here for dinner. We had the general Tso's chicken, mongolian beef and vegetable fried rice with an order of egg rolls. The egg rolls are about three times the size of typical egg roll, and the fried rice is extremely flavorful. The service was good and the prices are great, as usual for Chinese restaurants, and even the fortune cookies had a lot of flavor. We wish we could come back."}
{"text":"I have had Chinese food from several take out places and this has to be the worst of all. Chicken and broccoli is mostly broccoli and no chicken. Chicken was not fresh, it was chewy. I paid extra for dry and bland lo mein. It was just boiled noodles lumped together. Never coming back to this place again."}
{"text":"I tried this Chinese spot because of the previous reviews and was truly disappointed!

I ordered the sesame chicken and ham fried rice combination plate and received only three pieces of chicken and the rice was entirely too salty, I'm assuming they put too much soy sauce on it.

So overall, I was not pleased."}
{"text":"Heard about Magic Wok opening on Atwood so my husband and I decided to give them a try.  We were pleasantly surprised.  We started with Wonton Soup and Eggrolls.  The soup was delicious and there was plenty for both of us and enough for a couple of bowls at home.  The eggrolls were crispy and very flavorful.  Enjoyed it a lot.  I had the Orange Chicken, but was skeptical because it's usually a hot and spicy dish, but they told me they would do it without the heat.  It was amazing, perhaps the best Orange Chicken I've had anywhere.  The portions are large, so I brought enough home for four lunches.  My husband also thoroughly enjoyed his Lo Mein.  We can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I ordered take out here at magic wok the food was hot the flavor was great. Best filers Chinese I have had. It did take awhile to deliver that's why I get it 4 stars instead of five."}
{"text":"My daughter and I took my 85 yr old parents here for dinner due to all the positive reviews online. The food was outstanding and the portions quite large--enough for another meal at home the next day. My parents thought the food was the best Chinese food they've had since moving to Madison. If I lived in Madison, I'd be eating here regularly! The positive reviews are correct--excellent food! The prices were reasonable and the service was great!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese takeout I've had in Madison! We tried the spicy salt and pepper shrimp, orange chicken and egg rolls. All were really good!! Only downside is they don't deliver to campus so we had to pick up, but it was worth it."}
{"text":"I usually order Asian kitchen for late night  take out, but I was referred to magic wok and decided to order some nummy food for late night take out.

For this order, I got the Kung pao chicken and the triple combo lo mein (beef, chicken, and shrimp). The Kung pao was your standard nuts, chicken, and green/red bell peppers with rice. It wasn't out of this world good, but the portion for late night take out was very large. I was still eating my late night takeout for lunch and dinner the day after, which was very nice.

Likewise, the lo mein also came in a very large portion. I ended up getting more meat than noodles ( which I'm not complaining about ). The quality of the meat wasn't cheap and the steak was seared very nicely. Even so, the noodles were pretty greasy and lacked any certain flavor.

The take out delivery was prompt and way earlier than expected.

Overall, good takeout. A step above AK"}
{"text":"I brought my son here, expecting your usual fried Chinese food for a quick lunch and I was totally blown away! Everything was made to order and their sweet and sour chicken had a wonderful breading and great sauce! I'm surprised this place wasn't packed!"}
{"text":"As I set out to do after my last review I've continued exploring the menu and discovered what have become my two fave dishes from Magic Wok - chicken fried rice and chicken lo mein. I've ordered from here too many times at this point to rate it anything less than five stars. While I was in the process of packing up my apartment and moving they were a godsend - I'm fairly certain the deliver guy was feeling deja vu when he returned to my apartment a couple of days apart. 

Both the lo mein and fried rice are very generous portions that feed me for a few meals at least, and both reheat quite well. The lo mein features large slices of chicken, onions, sprouts, bamboo shoots, and probably another thing or two I'm forgetting. The fried rice is also chicken-heavy and has a bit of egg and some veggies. In both, chicken is the centerpiece; I'm still surprised at how generous they are with the meat. The lunch deal is still amazing, but if you go for the lo mein be ready for it to come on a bed of rice. A little strange, but I love rice so I'm not complaining. 

I recently stopped in to pick up my food and the restaurant is warmly lit but was completely dead on a rainy Tuesday around 7:30. Decoration is a bit bare, but you're going for the delicious, inexpensive food, not the ambiance. Long story short, Magic Wok will make for a magically delicious meal."}
{"text":"Tried Magic Wok again, and I decided to upgrade my review. We got delivery this time, and it arrived quickly and very hot.

The Hot and Spicy Lamb was the standout. It was delicious, with tons of veggies (mushrooms, onions, green peppers, carrots, and jalapeños) and lamb in a flavorful, spicy sauce.

The Eggplant in Hot Garlic Sauce was also great. Lots of sauce, and not deep fried, which I appreciate.

Beef and Green Peppers in Black Bean Sauce was pretty standard. Again, I appreciated the generous amount of veggies. The Hot and Sour Soup was also pretty average, but seemed homemade and not gloopy with corn starch.

The Crab Rangoons were awesome again, with really good sweet & sour sauce. All-in-all, lots of food for the price, and most of it really tasty. I'm teetering between 3 & 4 stars."}
{"text":"This is our #1 choice of Chinese food in the area. The owners (Banza & husband) are genuinely wonderful people! They will make special requests for vegetarians - literally anything you want. They even know its us by name based on our order. Super clean restaurant as always."}
{"text":"The takeout is ready very soon, just about ten minutes. The food is very good, the portions are large, and the prices are quite reasonable. Good vegetarian options as well.

Edit: as I've explored the menu over multiple visits, I've founds lots of things I like but quite a few that I did not like. Good: eggrolls, crab rangoons, chow ho fun, lo mein, Szechuan style string beans (my favorite). General Tso's chicken. Not good: The sweet and sour chicken (bland, completely plain fried chicken served with that orange sauce on the side), hot and sour soup (I didn't like the flavor or texture)."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best Chinese meals I've eve had!  Chicken fried rice is incredible!!"}
{"text":"Holy food goodness!! My friend and I have been on a mission to try all the Chinese restaurants in the Madison area, and this one was a PLEASANT surprise! The meat quality is very good, and the prices aren't bad at all! We were in food heaven! The wait staff is very friendly, the atmosphere is inviting, and we didn't feel awkward at all for being the only customers! We were actually surprised to be the only ones, considering how good it is. So everyone - go to Magic Wok, you won't be disappointed!

PS - my fortune told me I'm alluring, so they really treat you topnotch here. They feed you up, get you a little fatter, and still boost your confidence. I'm in love."}
{"text":"This place is pretty solid as far as Chinese goes for Madison. Delivery is quick and the food is consistent. Hit up the chef's special menu if you're willing to venture away from American Chinese takeout classics."}
{"text":"Confession: I am most likely to seek out Chinese food when I'm sick, or feel sickness coming on. So today was the perfect day to try a new place.

I was the only customer at 3:45 pm, and was warmly welcomed. I ordered at the counter, but decided to eat in. I used the restroom (basic but clean, with really nice smelling hand soap) and my food was ready when I came out, moments later. I was invited/instructed to take a seat at a table in the raised front window area, which was perfect.

I first noticed that the hot and sour soup (my cure-all) was served in a real Pyrex/glass bowl, not plastic. Yes!!! It was piping hot and full of very silky strips of tofu, homemade? Not a lot of mushrooms, and light on the vinegar flavor, but full of egg shreds, julienned carrots and plenty of heat from spices. They don't have shrimp or pork egg rolls, only chicken or plain veggie. I got one order of each and they were done perfectly, not greasy, with a nice crunch. I would describe the flavors of everything as comfort food. Nothing too original or interesting, but very enjoyable and soothing. I preferred the veggie roll to the chicken, just my personal preference. The next table's food smelled heavenly when it arrived, I'll get a meal next time I come.

It was plenty warm enough inside on a gray cold day, with a dimly pleasant lighting level and nondescript instrumental background music at a comfortable volume. The interior is basic diner, with a few Chinese items thrown in so you know where you are. A huge red statue of Buddha at the entry is a fun touch. Random, but I really liked the front door. It's clearly original to this historic Atwood building, antique with the patina of age and so many thousands of hands opening it over the years...

The waitress checked in unobtrusively to see if everything was OK at the right time, and it was. My dishes were removed promptly and politely as I finished with them. 

Six bucks and change before tip, and I left full, warmed, and feeling better. Can't ask for much more."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery -- spring rolls and spicy garlic eggplant. The food arrived hot and on time. Spring rolls were good, very crispy, and flavorful. The texture of the eggplant was good, but a tad too spicy since I'd selected medium and the heat overpowered any garlic flavor. My major complaint was that the eggplant was just too oily. It's fine and I appreciate the delivery option, but not really a draw."}
{"text":"Bumping them up a star for seriously stellar take-out service. They're efficient, speedy (never more than 10 minutes during the week) and so darn lovely when I pop in for my pick-up. Food is piping...PIPING hot when I get it home, though my drive isn't too far. After having it several times I can highly recommend the crispy pan fried noodle with every protein imaginable, just ask that they don't fry the noodles to death. They sort of know me by noodle now, \"Oh.... not so cripsy, yes, we have your order ready.\""}
{"text":"The food is really good but the service leaves a lot to be desired. My husband and I sat for 30 min for our appetizer, waited an hour for our food, waited 30 min for a refill on our drinks, then waited another 30 min for the check when my husband gave up and took our left overs up to the counter himself and asked for the check."}
{"text":"My wife and I just stopped eating our meals from here and we are immensely disappointed, I say stopped because neither one of us finished, not because of the portion size either! I'll start with what I had had which is the General Tso's chicken, the most bland sauce you can imagine, I'm glad I got it spicy as that was the only flavor, and it appeared all they did was throw some crushed red pepper flakes in it unlike other places that put the little red peppers in. I actually considered putting barbecue sauce on it since it just tasted like I was eating chicken fingers! There was plenty of sauce, it just had no flavor. I will say the chicken was all white meat and of good size, so it didn't feel like you were eating just breading.
My wife had the beef with broccoli, again very bland. Her meal was very dry with almost no sauce and the broccoli was obviously old and tasted as such with white around the edges and no vibrant green color that fresh broccoli has. Once again the beef seemed to be of higher quality than most other places, but it literally tasted like we were eating unseasoned beef strips.
We will never eat here again and I am disappointed that I wasted $20 on such a terrible meal. To quote my wife \"we should have just gotten Arby's!\" \" Read less"}
{"text":"By far the best, hot, delicious delivery food I've EVER gotten. Very quick, nice and tasty. Always recommend it to people -- you need to try it now."}
{"text":"Egggh... mediocre. Bland, white-folks-style Chinese-esque food. Nice people, I'm sure, and affordable. But... boring and flavorless. 

I won't be ordering from this place again. I can make better myself."}
{"text":"I've never been a huge fan of Chinese food. Mainly because I could never find a dish that I loved or a place that could consistently make that dish amazing every single time. Look no further! This is by far, the best place for Chinese food in Madison! The fried rice is incredible with hints of ginger and fresh sliced jalepeno that give it a fantastic, spicy kick. We always get the General Tso Chicken (add extra broccoli) and Szechuan Beef (extra green onion) and both dishes are delicious. Each time we order, the food is ready within 10 minutes and is piping hot. Egg rolls and crab Rangoon are tasty as well! This is our \"go-to\" place for Chinese!"}
{"text":"People, I have no shame admitting this: Magic Wok is the closest I've ever gotten to a committed relationship. Mondays are a devastating routine of shattered hopes & dreams upon re-realization that Magic Wok is closed.

Have you ever been in love? Like, really, indomitably in love?"}
{"text":"I was so skeptical of this place, honestly.  But after three very very tasty orders, I have to say that it's a great place.  The people behind the counter are great, the portions are very large, and, most importantly, the food is just good.

My favorite so far is the house special fried rice.  A nice medium spice, lots of ingredients... I just can't stop eating it. 

When you call for pick up it's just.... \"ten minutes!\""}
{"text":"Love this place! Best Chinese food take out around. The combinations have a ton of food. Some of our favorite are sweet and sour chicken, broccoli chicken, pepper steak and Singapore noodles. The owners are very friendly and the service is very fast! If your in the search for local take out Chinese food look no further!"}
{"text":"This review is based on having a Chinese takeout meal with my family on Christmas.  We placed our order with a very nice and pleasant woman and it was ready 20 minutes later.  Things got bad when we each opened up our containers (chicken with mixed vegetables, Mongolian beef, 2 noodle dishes and ma po tofu) and they literally all looked and smelled the exact same but obviously some had different meats and some had noodles.  The food was greasy and there was no point in trying anyone else's food because they used literally the same sauce on everything-generic Americanized Chinese food sauce.  It was pretty bad folks.  We will not be back."}
{"text":"Based on the reviews, i was hopeful that this place would be better than all the other Chinese joints in town that serve the same quality, same disappointing (soulless) Cisco food. No. While our large order came incredibly fast for a Friday night (30 mins delivered!) we were not at all pleased with our purchase. 
Crab rangoons, spring roll- ok. 
Chicken wings, very bad. (VERY DRY)
Sesame chicken, huge portion but dry, hard to cut, flavor ok but same as everywhere else (happy wok, taste of China, China star, you name it). :(
Pad Thai was the most unusual... NOTHING like Thai pad Thai. Flavor was entirely that of charred meats. And oil. So much oil. Had all kinds of meat in it, no veggies. Quite good if you love the grill flavor. Not so good if you like the bright flavors of traditional pad Thai.
Don't recommend. We never waste food, but our leftovers will not be eaten, unfortunately."}
{"text":"We had delivery on a late Friday night and we had high hopes based on the Yelp reviews here but were pretty disappointed. Not much flavor and everything was a bit overcooked and dry. Won't be ordering again."}
{"text":"Maybe this is a relative rating; relative to every other Chinese restaurant in the area.  If you are in town from New York, Chicago, or even downtown Cleveland, I suspect you won't be selecting Magic Wok. For those of us who live here, this is really is the best of the best. 

The General Tao's is definitely not a General Tso's, for better or worse.  It almost tasted like a hot sauce for the chicken.  Their fried rice is dark, but very well done.  The Pad Thai is good.  The chicken dishes are good.  Everything is good.  Probably even above good.  They only use white meat chicken, that means chicken breast.  That's why it earns a 4th star.  The people that work here are very nice and hospitable. 

If I have one recommendation, it's the size of the fried chicken chunks.  It's like 1/4 chicken breasts that have been breaded and deep fried.  Which isn't bad per say, but you definitely need to cut the chunks into 6-8 pieces to be able to enjoy it with the sauce of choice.  

You can always judge a Chinese restaurant based on how leftovers taste the next day, and Magic Wok passes that test."}
{"text":"Better than your average China Town/Kitchen take out, but not 5 star dining.

 The chicken egg rolls didn't feel home-made to me (fairly generic) and the crab rangoon contained a small amount of filling (lots of cream cheese with barely any crab).

The shrimp lo mein was definitely better than average with very little grease and a nice amount of shrimp. The general tso's chicken was spicier than most I've had. The chicken was good quality. The breading was quite crispy, which I liked.

Overall service was good and prompt. Would visit again."}
{"text":"Do not order delivery. It took 2 hours for them to make 2 dishes and drive 7 minutes to my apartment."}
{"text":"We thought this sounded like a great place to eat so ordered carry out to take back to the hotel. We ordered General's chicken for my husband, sweet and sour chicken for my son and I asked for a spicy recommendation for myself and was told a salt and pepper shrimp would be good. We also ordered fried dumplings and crab Rangoon.
Everything was okay, pretty average really. Doesn't compare well to what we have at home, but fairly average. Son was not impressed with his, hubs said it was ok, he's had better, and mine was, frankly, disappointing as the shrimp had a heavy breading on it, which I would never have ordered it if I'd known. No veggies or sauce of any kind came with it either, just breaded shrimp. We did like the fried rice a lot. The dumplings were ok, and the crab Rangoon was ok too, just not impressive or special in any way. 
I know this place has pretty high ratings, but in our opinions, just plain kind of average. We would not choose to go there again but hopefully it will be better for you!"}
{"text":"Just great.  It's just great.  My wife and I have been looking for a place to get \"Chinese\" food in Madison...not real Chinese cuisine, I mean greasy, sugary, fried American Chinese food.  This place, of the 5-6 we've tried in the best.  Their food tastes like real food, but also tastes like the cheap stuff you've come to know and love.  Somehow it balances the two, I don't know how!  I'm not even sure they deliver to my area, I've haven't bothered asking, I'm willing to drive the extra distance to get it because it is so friggin' good."}
{"text":"Best takeout possible. Good for hangovers and laziness. Mushu and hot and sour soup are highly recommended by me and my associates."}
{"text":"I'm traveling from NY where the best new Chinese food is found in Flushing, this place didn't disappoint! I really enjoyed the hot and sour soup, shrimp lo mein. Hot and sour soup has quite a kick!"}
