{"text":"Excellent Latin American food and very good service and also good place to have some drinks after dinner. I didn't like the deserts specially the 3 Leches but the rest of the menu is fantastic."}
{"text":"Pretty good food. Service is great. Went there on opening day and for a lounge experience on the second floor. It was packed and quickly got claustrophobic. Getting a drink on the second floor is a battle when it gets packed. Would come here for food but not for anything else in the future till it's run a little bit better."}
{"text":"I came here for my friend's birthday and sat at the lounge area upstairs. We had each ordered a 12$ drink and sat down to chat and have a good time. Within 20minutes the waitress repeatedly came up to us asking if we wanted more drinks. I was not even half done my negroni. Finally she blatantly told us we have to leave the table if we're not going to order more drinks.   I cannot believe how rude and unwelcoming she was. We came to your establishment to celebrate an event. We are paying customers and inturn should receive a decent level of respect and courtesy.  How fast do you expect us to drink a cocktail? We would have gladly ordered more drinks, in fact we left and brought our money to a venue that appreciated our business.   I understand there is limited seating and the waitress makes her living off of the tips from the tables but give me a break, I shouldn't have to feel rushed and hustled in a place like that.  We went in with the intention of getting some food and drinks and to have a good time and instead received arrogance and poor service. Your server ruined the whole experience and i doubt we'll be returning again.  On a good note, the negroni was made well and the bartender was friendly."}
{"text":"Brunch opening week. Tried their pancakes and the Ranchero. The Ranchero had so much variety and was full of flavour! Their pancakes were MASSIVE!! Definitely to be shared. Perfect mix of 2 fluffy pancakes, queso fresco and guava sweetness!   Both dishes were delicious! Our waitress was very attentive and helpful in providing recommendations. Love the atmosphere! Will definitely return for more."}
{"text":"TLDR; brunch food is passable overall, but expensive. Order 1 pancake, not the stack of 3 because it is huge and deathly sweet.  I came for 11:30 Saturday brunch with a couple of friends. We made reservations but the restaurant was very empty. Even by the time we were done, there were plenty of seats. Service was kind of slow, especially for the number of people there (there was maybe one other table when we sat down).  I order the Ranchero and we ordered one pancake to share. This is kind of off-menu, as the menu pancakes come in a stack of 3. I would definitely NOT order the full stack. We split the one pancake, which is huge and includes all the same toppings, between 3 people but couldn't even finish it because it was so sweet. The Ranchero was fine.. honestly a pretty plain breakfast, just with a Latin twist.. The rice was not good. It was plain white rice, which was so bland. The chorizo and the bacon on the other hand were very salty. The eggs on the tostada were kind of strange... I was completely not a fan of the beans. Overall, it was a good portion of food, but for a price tag of $23, I was not impressed."}
{"text":"I loved the atmosphere. I thought the duck confit rice dish was amazing. I could eat that over and over.  Scallops were great. The rest of the food we ordered was blah. Our waitstaff were super friendly.   We reserved a booth well in advance but we were short one person so they said they couldn't seat us there and ended up giving us a table near the front of the restaurant.   And damn it was cold we could feel a draft. :( just get some heaters :) or let your guests sit where they booked!"}
{"text":"Beautiful photos on Instagram. That's what gets me out of the house and trying out new restaurants! Baro, just opened a few months ago, has been all over my news feed, I just had to try it out.   Accurately depicted in the photos, the decor is unique and grungy with a splash of class. We were seated right away although the place was already pretty packed on a Thursday night.   I understand that the restaurant is still quite new and they're learning to perfect everything, but here is a list of what they need improvement on:  1. There is a constant cold draft if you're seated near the bar. I was freezing my butt off the entire night.   2. The servers are not trained properly - Our waitress didn't know that certain drinks came without alcohol until I pointed out the fine print on the menu (which she didn't even read) and she thought that all tables came with chips & guacamole, when in fact, they were not free. She also did not make helpful recommendations on menu items - When asked, EVERYTHING was delicious.. so it didn't really help me make up my mind.   3. The Ceviche Flight ($32) was underwhelming - 5 tiny bite sized samples of all their ceviche options. I think my favorite one was the Tiradito.   4. ROPA NUEVA ($32) - The server said the beef was braised for 24 hours so I thought this would be a winner. Unfortunately, it tasted like it was braised in soy sauce, and the meat was not tender, but instead extremely dry. The yuca gratin was delicious though!   Overall, Baro is overpriced for what you get. I would suggest skipping the food and just coming for a social drink, unless they massively improve on the flavor and consistency of their food items."}
{"text":"Baro opened earlier this month adding some Latin American flavour to King West.   The space is gorgeous, fun, and lively!  There are three floors and they plan to have a year round patio space!  They take reservations which is great though.  The restaurant is still working out some kinks..   So, we started by ordering drinks.  The first two drinks were sold out.   It took a while after ordering drink #1 to find out their signature Mezcal was not available.  It took a while after ordering #2 to find out Mezcal #2 was also not available.   At that point I have no idea what we got for drink attempt #3.  We ordered a few items, the duck confit rice was standout and I'd order this again.   The pork with goat cheese tortillas was also a tasty choice.   Empanadas were cute but small and not particularly flavourful.   Love the mix of taro and plantain chips that came with the guacamole.   The fried fish was not bad, but nothing special.   Did not love the pork belly it was overcooked fatty but too crispy at the same time.   As for dessert, the tres leches cake was completely underwhelming. It wasn't sweet or moist enough. I was disappointed as usually love this dessert.   I'd come back again to check out the patio, but order other items."}
{"text":"I came here with a couple girl friends for dinner on a Wednesday. Great ambiance. The food was good. The Churros were to die for!!!! All in all, it was a great experience and will take more friends here for a fun night!"}
{"text":"Wow, this was the most foodie restaurant I've been to in Toronto in a long time.  The food is incredibly tasty and amazingly presented.  The cocktails are to die for!   Plus they have a great wine list.  They are very popular so you have to make reservations in advance.  Great service, great atmosphere, totally brilliant food."}
{"text":"This place is really good. We went with a group of people- around 20 people. I find that usually with large groups, the quality of the food goes down. Maybe because preparation is a lot faster than with smaller groups?  Anyways, at Baro the food was still so good so I can't imagine how much better it would be with a smaller group"}
{"text":"Got together with my university boys for our regular catch up dinner and decided to go with the recently opened Baro located in the heart of the entertainment district on King West in Toronto. For months I had been watching it been built slowly but surely and was super excited to suggest it to the group when considering dinner options!  Baro brings the best of the former King W restaurant, Valdez (and it's speakeasy hip hop cocktail bar Escobar), and gives it mutant super powers spread over 3 floors a dining floor, a raw bar and the loft which, as I understand, is what Escobar was and you need a password in order to access the space.  The decor is really nice, it feels almost like it's part rainforest, part ancient ruin part sophisticated night spot. And to add to the AHEM aesthetic of the venue, it would appear that Baro has poached every attractive server, bartender and chef from the rest of the city. This human aesthetic is only exceeded by how attractive the crowd is here. I felt like a wallflower in my fancy jeans, blazer and Chelsea boots. TL:DR - this place is all kinds of sexy...  ... then there was the food. This place follows the Toronto Tapas trend that forces me to evolve past my Joey Tribiani mantra of NOT sharing food. Toronto is all about shareable plates, and Baro is no different. Here is a recap of what we (5 guys) ordered and split evenly between us.  PLATICOS  CGS $15 chips + guacamole + salsa - The chips were fresh made and had varied flavours all of which delicious. The guacamole and fresh salsa were also excellent. That said I don't think this dish is worth $15 for what you get. If this was a complimentary starter for when you sit down I think that would add some value but I highly doubt the food cost on this is even $3 so the markup is a little crazy.  EMPANADAS $7 corn meal + beef + potato + peas + aji 3pcs - 3 bite-sized empanadas per order served on a paper bag. I thought these were delicious and the presentation was cute and fun. The Emps might look super teeny tiny BUT they are packed to the brim with filling. Definitely a great buy and delicious. We had 2 orders for the table, I could have easily eaten 2 orders on my own.  CHORI PAPA $15 chorizo + potato + peppers + chipotle golf + goat cheese + 4 tortillas - This was the table favourite. A glorious pile of ingredients served in a skillet with steamed tortillas. Sort of like a do-it-yourself soft taco appetiser. The flavours were incredible again and te meat was seasoned very well. I would definitely highly recommend this dish.  CEVICHE  TIRADITO $19 albacore tuna + passion fruit & lulo + squash + chile + cilantro + sesame seeds - this original tuna ceviche was easily one of my favourite ceviches I've ever had for two reasons. First, there wasn't an over-abundance of citrus. I've found many times a lot of restaurants go a little crazy with the lemon and lime and the end result is you miss the taste of the fish, Baro uses citrus as it should be, enough to make and flavour the dish, without overpowering it. Second, the fish was served in almost sushi style sliced rather than chopped chunks in a bowl.   MAINS ARROZ CON POLLO $30 breast and pamplona + avocado rice + spinach + saffron jus + patacone - Saffron rice was tender, moist and full of vibrant flavours and the chicken matched the rice on all three categories. The chicken breast ws massive, definitely too much for one or event two people to handily eat on their own.   ROPA NUEVA $32 braised beef + yuca gratin + rapini + garlic + chile + oregano - this was fall off the bone fork tender, the meat was soft and deeply seasoned in a beautiful sauce. The yuca cratin was similar to mashed potatoes  PERTH PORK $27 loin + grains & legumes spicy rocoto pepper + celery root puree + apple salsa + mustard jus - This dish reminded me of the pork you would find inside a Cubano sandwich infused with the flavours of a pork chop which was brought about but the apple salsa. The pork was super tender, very good. I didn't get very much of this dish so I'd like to return and try it again.  Split 5/6 ways the meal overall was very reasonable at about $60-75 a person after tax and tip. I didn't drink any alcohol but the cocktails my friends ordered looked incredibly well made with a high degree of skill and precision put into making them.  I'd like to return and try a few more things, including some drinks before awarding the next star. Definitely an excellent spot for groups, date nights (and fellas, this is impressive to bring a first date - just keep your eyes on your date).  Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"I had low expectations about the opening of another King West bar barn, but decided to give it a try, and the low expectations were met.   I ordered a tequila from their long list in the cocktail bar, and a sangrita to go with it.   Saw the barman making me an an enormous Sangria and quickly had that sinking feeling.  I explained what a sangrita was, and how it's a standard companion to good sipping tequila, but they didn't have it or know about it, and I just thought, what a pity to spend all this money on this pretty place and know so little about what you are doing that you can't get even the basic things right. And since my expectations were so predictably and efficiently met, I won't be rushing back."}
{"text":"My girlfriend took me here for my birthday and WOW. I absolutely LOVED everything about this place. Not only do they have a cocktail lounge on the second floor with trendy wall art, the entire main level of this restaurant makes you feel like you're somewhere down south. I honestly felt that I was dining somewhere in Miami or Mexico. The atmosphere was fun, hip and vibrant. If you like popular latin music then you'll love the music and vibes that Baro offers! Moving on to the food.. we started with the flight of ceviche you can order and let me just say this was the BEST ceviche I've ever had. Just thinking about their ceviche while I write this review makes me want to go back for more! The main dish we got was the duck confit rice.. WE ATE IT ALL. Plenty for two people but SO tasty that you couldn't not finish the entire dish. To top off the amazing dining experience I had here, I told the one server that we wanted churros (one order only has 3) and asked if we could have 4 because it was my birthday. They brought out 4 churros with a candle and gave it to us for free! AMAZING! I recommend Baro for a date, for groups, for friends and family or if you just want a good time and some amazing food!"}
{"text":"Dont even think about leave your jacket at that service were you pay 3 $cdn for theyre completely disorganized that systems they have don't work  propertly"}
{"text":"Came to baro to celebrate with a few friends on a Sunday evening. We got the Latino Street Party sharing menu - normally $65/person but it was on special that night for $45/person  chips and guac - good, nothing special  ceviche - very tiny pieces of fish but a very generous portion   Chori Papa - flavour, the flour tortillas were very thick  Bandeja - the pork was drastically overcooked, making it tough and chewy. The plaintains were like little hockey pucks. The guac had so much citrus in it, it was inedible dessert were little truffles - ho hum  we told our server that the bandeja was terrible and the manager came over and comped us a tasting menu fee. Because of their quickness to resolve, I would probably come back to try a few more things.   Overall the food is okay, but the service is spectacular."}
{"text":"Full Disclaimer for starters my exposure to Latin American food is limited so I am going to base this review on the taste profile I like as oppose to what they are supposed to be. This was a planned trip so we had reserved seats in advance for a Friday (recommended as I saw a few people being turned away when we were heading out). I had gone through the menu beforehand and still wasn't sure what to order when we got there. The latino street party tasting option looked enticing as one would pay the same amount. However we had to skip as my other dinning companions (DC) are picky eaters. I had the tasting of ceviches which for some inexplicable reason had a shrimp taco as well. The tuna ceviche was decent, the hamachi was ho hum, the shrimp taco was middling. I expect a lot of tang and burst of flavors on ceviche which were there however the hamachi didn't have the fresh flavor one craves (maybe cured too long?)  On to the mains I went with a chaufa and DC's ordered the miso cod with dashi broth. I ordered a margerita as well which is OK. I didn't know what to expect from chaufa. I am pleased to report it was better than I expected. Served in a piping hot bowl (bibimbap style) that started to cook the rice to a nice crisp and added texture. The medley of meat and vegetables was well balanced. My DC's enjoyed this dish as well. This is a large serving so can even be shared by two.  Miso Cod hmm I did try this dish and wasn't impressed at all. Devoid of seasoning was unexpected as well. DC's commented on being overly salty at the end. Dashi broth didn't add much to this dish IMO.  The presentation is nice for all dishes and is in line with the food that is offered in the the entertainment district (with price to match I should add)  Will I visit again not sure at this price point there are plenty of other options IMO."}
{"text":"Pretty solid tapas place.  very modern elegant casual style decor.  service was excellent.  craft cocktails were a highlight.  we tried a bunch of different dishes.  the pulpo was a highlight.  I wish the menu was a little more straightforward in describing the dishes.  for example, if the menu described the OG DUCK CHAUFA as what it was which was essentially fried rice with shreds of duck in it, I wouldn't have been so disappointed when it came out.  all in all a pretty positive experience, but a bit underwhelming given this restaurants position on various \"top restaurants in toronto\" lists"}
{"text":"Went to this place on their opening week. It was very poorly run. We sat at the bar and watched our food sit there for literally 15 minutes after it was made... Our waitress was just chatting with another waiter the whole time beside the kitchen. The food was cold by the time it got to us and we were sitting 2 feet away from the kitchen. Needless to say, the service could definitely be improved.   On the plus side, the decor here is great! Unfortunately, food is definitely a pre-requisite when I spend this much on a restaurant."}
{"text":"I was there for opening night but with all excitement forgot to check-in. Then I did a pick-up order and noticed they weren't on Yelp, so I added them. I have been a few times now.   The food is amazing! Fresh and flavourful. The menu has been scaled back a bit and the prices have increased a bit, not really surprising with the new building and make-over, I'll get to that in a minute.   My faves: Coctel ceviche is going to have sex in your mouth and make you feel all tingly inside! Holy mother of God I was not expecting the burst of flavour that came from this dish! Shrimp, avocado, tomato, lime and cilantro is orgasmic!   Chori Papa is still on the menu, thank goodness because it is absolute goodness! Love this dish.   New item - Bar Snack with the option of adding crickets for $1. Do it.  Tostada is yummy!   Noquis is a great vegetarian option for someone. Gnocchi with a cream sauce, Gorgonzola cheese and peas, very delicious.  Chaufa - Chef Steve has upped his game! The combination of flavours in this one is outstanding! Duck confit, rice, edamame, egg, chili, papi Kung fu and tobiko (fancy name for fish eggs); your tastebuds will thank you. For one person $35 is a lot but for two I think that's reasonable.   Chocolate - again, another orgasmic experience! Just get it! You will thank me. (I brought this to my chef friend and he had the orgasmic experience too!)   Churros - yummilicious! Get it!   Now about the building. Kudos to Baro for the absolutely amazing job on making it wheelchair accessible! I was blown away. The bathroom on the main floor blends right into the wall and the size is very generous. I work with people who have disabilities and it's so hard to find a venue that is accessible. The entertainment district doesn't think people with disabilities get out much. There is an elevator to access all four levels.   The staff are phenomenal! From the minute you walk in and the ladies at the front desk greet you, to the servers, the bar, to the kitchen. My favourite seat is at the kitchen. I love watching them prep and plate the food. I'm a little sad that I can't see as much now because the counter wall is a bit higher and I'm short! Ha!   So get up and go right now! You're welcome!"}
{"text":"You don't come here for the food.  It is a beautiful restaurant with a pretty good vibe. Everything tastes the same. Spicy and dry. Ordered the empanadas. Very expensive. Very dry.  Service felt very corporate, I wouldn't have thought that would be the case. I felt like I was at a keg or cactus club. Also their space Pablo, should not be called that. Very insensitive to the latin community."}
{"text":"Overall great They were very patient with our 14 month old! Food good, service and interior great!"}
{"text":"Great service and delicious food makes this hot spot one I see why people are talking about! I came here to celebrate a girlfriends birthday and we were all impressed. We started with the guc, which was spot on! The best dish was definitely the octopus - even one of my girlfriends who isn't an octopus fan enjoyed it and said she would have it again. We also shared the ceviche and empanadas, beef causa and matambre. The flavour of the dishes were all so different, yet oh so delicious. We also all had the Batanga to drink - it was excellent! The server was helpful and attentive. I will definitely be back and recommend checking it out."}
{"text":"The bartender on the third floor (blonde hair Christa) SUCKS. So rude and RACIST. You're gonna lose so many customers if you don't lose her"}
{"text":"One of the best eats in the city! Highly recommend this spot. Atmosphere is positive and lively, food is on point every time and service is impeccable. All staff were personable and well versed with the menu. My favorite dishes were the Chaufa & the Pulpo."}
{"text":"Been here several times as we live right across the street. Food is decent for Latin American food in Toronto. Service is not bad. Bigger space than Valdez used to be but the speakeasy at Valdez was better. It used to be hip hop and more chill in the back. Now it's electronic with more douches. Their concept of hand picking customers to let into the back is pure discrimination. Surely they'll drop this practice after a year of being a newish spot. Was excited for the new Valdez now just disappointed."}
{"text":"Célebre mi cumpleaños este pasado sábado. Wow me encanto el restaurante y la atencion al cliente El pastel de tres leches no lo recomiendo mucho.  Pero los churros están increíbles. De preferencia los patos principales están mucho mejor  Que las tapas.  Aunque muy recomendable los ceviches"}
{"text":"Had a really great experience at this restaurant tonight. My friend had a foodora issue (more with foodora, less with this restaurant) a couple of months back, and the manager followed up with her immediately after and offered to make her a reservation if she wanted to give it another go.   Her and I went tonight, and every aspect of the dinner was wonderful. The manager had made us a reservation at 7pm on a Thursday - a busy time for them - and we were seated promptly at the bar. This was actually great, as the kitchen is all open. The wait staff was extremely friendly and professional, and ensured any allergies were looked after.   The food was also incredible - our server suggested 3 to 5 dishes, and we ordered 5, which for two people was a lot, but I had no regrets. Loved the variation of corn chips and vegetables that came with the guac, and the while the rest of our food was amazing, the chori papa was amazing. We were more than stuffed.   All in all we had a great time, and I would highly recommend this restaurant. Great vibe, great food, great staff."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant and the food was delicious!  Presentation was nice and the portions generous.  I ate here for brunch and they even went out for almond milk for my latte (they only had regular milk).  The ambiance was perfect - inviting, hip, chill.  The decor is culturally eclectic, really LOVE THIS PLACE. (I had the Florentine, Pancakes & Parfait - all so delicious)."}
{"text":"We had dinner with my boyfriend to Baro last week. Let's start by saying that the food was great and the cocktail delicious. Our waitress was great too!  The only thing I wasn't very happy about is the service at the beginning when we entered in the restaurant. We made a reservation for 8.30 and the table wasn't available so they sent us to the bar upstairs for a drink which is fine.   Since the restaurant opened recently it would have been nice to indicate us the way to go to get to the bar.  Once our table was ready someone came to inform us upstairs but our cocktails were not ready yet. We were informed that we had to pay upstairs for the cocktail which i understand because the cash registered are not on the same floor but it doesn't really make sense when you are about to have dinner in the establishment.   Also since the drinks were not ready they could have told ask the barman to cancel the order and ask for it for us downstairs.   So we go downstairs and have to give our information about the reservation again to the hostess and then ask for our coats to hang. That would have been nice to do when we very first arrive and before they sent us to the bar. I mean it's not mid-season where you have a light jacket, it's winter when you have the big winter coat. That would have been easier also to take our drink to our table than having my bag, my coat and my drink in my hands...  I read a lot of press release how the staff has been trained on the service and I agree they were all nice and smiling, our waitress was great but service also comes by those little things.   The 3 stars is really for that, food was good apart from that, but the service at the beginning got me annoyed."}
{"text":"Home to my favourite cocktail (Five Flower) and absolute favourite bar (Escobar) in the city, this unique venue deserve a 5/5.   The main floor offers a full dining experience, specializing in Latin cuisine. There aren't many other Latin restaurants in Toronto, let alone one with the ambiance like Baro. The restaurant features an open kitchen, and sitting by the bar gave me a glimpse of the action - I am sucker for open kitchens. The restaurant decor was also meticulously designed.   Upstairs you will find Pablo's Snack House, which offers tapas and shareable plates. I have yet to eat here, but enjoyed the drinks.   Finally, hidden away on the second floor is Escobar, a speakeasy hip-hop bar. This is my go-to place on the weekends...great music, friendly/attentive bartenders and a trendy, easygoing ambiance. Management is honest, very accommodating and makes me feel like a valued customer. If you can get your hands on the password, definitely check it out."}
{"text":"This place is great, if you want a chill, but lit night on King West. After securing the password from a friend, we went to Escobar, their \"secret\" bar upstairs.Their menu was rather small, but it was done well and they had some classic dishes on there. Realistically though no one is really coming upstairs for the food, instead it's a place to dance to some good music (mostly hiphop) and have some good cocktails. I will say, that this faux exclusiveness is a little much because no one even asked us for the password when we got in. Additionally, they have a \"VIP\" area which you can't get into unless you know someone, but this area is literally the same thing as the other side. Give it a rest guys."}
{"text":"I used to think about the one time I went to Valdez all the time, and when they closed down I was in a panic until I learned that Baro is the reincarnation. Finally got to try it, was not disappointed. I liked everything I had. Shrimp Ceviche, OG Duck Chaufa (which is ammmmaazinngg), my drink was great (though I can't remember the name of it) and even though I was so full and didn't want desert, I couldn't help but finish the churros suggested to us. It is on the pricey side - but I would rather spend the money here over many other restaurants in that strip. Not sure if seating for 2 has that many options (we were seated at the kitchen bar, but we didn't see any other small tables on the first floor)."}
{"text":"This place has great atmosphere and excellent tapas food.  The main dishes are ok but sharing the tapas dishes is really encouraged. I had a main, the chicken with avocado rice and I was really disappointed, especially for $32. It was really salty. The tapas however were excellent as were the churos for desert. After dinner we moved upstairs to the lounge which was ok but not amazing. The staff were friendly, especially in the restaurant downstairs. The place is very busy on a Saturday night though so if you go then expect to feel a bit rushed. All in all I'd go back for the tapas!"}
{"text":"My friend and I came here several times on weekends. We loved the ambience of the bar and Samy, one of the servers, was very sweet and kind. Also cute lol. I would come back to see him again!  But I only can give 4stars because of the overpriced drinks!"}
{"text":"LOVED! My friends & I ordered a bunch of things on the menu to try & here is what we loved: duck confit rice ($35 - supposedly one of their most popular dishes), CGS which is chips & guac ($15), chori papa ($16 - ask for more tortillas) and Lomo saltado ($36 - beef tenderloin). There are three levels, we sat on the 1st floor for dining."}
{"text":"We went to this place last night and we had a horrible experience. First we tried to access the other dance  floor and we were told that it was at  full capacity , but we noticed how the bouncer was letting in only people that he knew. Therefore I went up to him and his statement was !!! !!! Nothing !!!!!!! He did not know what to say when we asked. Second the bartender did not know how to make a whiskey sour and he was over changing us! We went to a different bartender at the end of the night and he charged us less! Very bad service!"}
{"text":"Just came for drinks before dinner.  Friends had reserved a booth on 2nd level.  Cool looking place, nice looking crowd.  Service was good, even though so busy.  Main floor is narrow and really busy and loud.  Glad I wasn't on that level."}
{"text":"Favourites: nikkei ceviche, choir papa, duck chaufau(don't compare this to regular fried rice), pulpo charred octopus Five flower cocktail $17 (worth it) So-so: chicken wings, empanadas, matambre(flank steak) Dislike: ice cream dessert,  choros(not bad but way too much sugar)"}
{"text":"Came here twice, loved the ambience and the food was amazing.  Juicing chicken I have tried so far in Toronto.  Duck chaufa and avocado rice with chicken is a must try. The shrimp tacos are good too!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a Sunday afternoon around 1pm with a group of 6. The place wasn't fully packed. The interior is lovely! Felt like I was transported away from King st. Large booths with comfy seating, the cocktails were beautiful, and the service was nice.   We started with the empanadas. It came in a cute little brown paper bag. They were piping hot, felt freshly fried! Lots of meaty stuffing that oozed out of their shells. They were quite small though, about 2-3 bites. We also got the salsa, chips and guac, which was good nothing special except they come with a variety of root vegetable and plantain chips which were thing and crispy. So the apps were all good.   For the main I got the eggs Benny blanco, it was quite disappointing. The eggs were overcooked, and the middle was stiff. And the mustards greens on the side were not dressed with anything, literally just tasted like blanched bitter greens. The pan de queso was good and crisp if thats a redeeming quality."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere & food. Absolutely love the 2nd floor lounge & workers there. Bartender in the speakeasy part (Escobar) refused to serve drinks to people who wouldn't start a tab (\"I don't want to keep having to process one by one\"). And wasn't keen on providing water to DD drivers (I guess for lack of tip). Disappointing and Strange, so that's why not 5*."}
{"text":"I've been dying to try out Baro and my dinner went even better than I dreamed it would! The last time I came here, we didn't make reservations so we had to go up to the lounge area (still pretty awesome). It was a ladies night type dinner for my group, so we decided to go all out on the menu. We ordered the tradito ceviche, chips & guac, duck confit chaufa, picada and pulpo. Everything came out like a quick fire! I was so impressed on how fast the first dish made it to our table with a full house of diners.   I LOVE chips that aren't just your regular potatoes. Here they use purple yams, taros and all sorts do root vegetables served with fresh salsa and guac. Even if you're in the upstairs lounge, you HAVE to order one of these!  Pretty much everything we tried was beyond expectations. The pulpo was so tender and flavourful, the tradito ceviche was beautifully plated as well as refreshing. The duck confit chaufa is a MUST experience here! I was wow-ed by the size of that rice bowl when it landed on our table. Seriously, a much larger portion than you would expect, pictures do not do it justice. There's a whole flavour trip with these dishes, so you need to come try them yourself.  The only personal thing I would say is to not order the picada if you can't handle it. You really need to be in a big appetite mood and on a cheat month to order it! The menu states it clearly it's everything you want to indulge in (deep fried wings, GIANT PIECES OF PORK BELLY, croquettes). It's really good but definitely have the capability first to order it!   One thing I love about Baro is how bright and refreshing the space is. This isn't your typical dimmed lighting dining space, this is a well lit and fun dinner space. It almost feels like you're eating on a patio with beautiful plants but you're really inside a narrow restaurant.  I've tried two cocktails here and I have to say the prices are worth the splurge. I've had the mojito ($10) and five flower ($15). The mojito was ordinary but the five flower had such depth and indescribably rich flavour to it. Come for an excellent dinner and stay for a fun night upstairs!"}
{"text":"I've been to Baro and Escobar a few times and I've always enjoyed it so I decided to celebrate my birthday at Escobar. I reached out a month prior to ensure a smooth night, however your bar manager Dirk made me feel like more of an inconvenience than a paying customer. I booked a booth through him and he met myself and my party of girls at the door and looked miserable. He made me feel like I was wasting his time. I initially decided to get 4 bottles and was thinking about getting another 2 but I quickly changed my mind when I realized that my business was not appreciated at this establishment. I told him I had another 4 guests that were arriving a little later (the rest of us arrived at 1030) and he told me to tell them not to come because they won't get in. Unbelievable. I get that there's a max capacity but the way he spoke to me was so rude. Its unfortunate because I really like Baro but I don't think I will come back again. I would rather go to a place where I feel like my business is appreciated."}
{"text":"This place is super trendy. The restaurant is decorated to be aesthetically pleasing with lots of greenery.  The prices are steep. I think to avoid having a scare when the cheque comes around, it's well worth to pick plates to share. We weren't that hungry so we got the chips and guacamole, a pitcher of sangria (which by the way can easily be split between six people), and the empanadas. The empanadas came in a cute paper brown bag - nice touch.   It was very hot inside, distracting us from our conversations. But, it was a good time! Definitely a place to try in the summer."}
{"text":"Dirk, the manager, is the prototypical power trippin' bouncer. He refused to let us in despite being on the guest list and then proceeded to let a massive group in immediately after us. I really hope that they change the management of this place, because with this attitude they won't last long."}
{"text":"Loved the decor! Loved the food! Service was great and attentive. I had the cuban rice and beans, the picada platter that had all things i love since i'm latin. The empanadas were to die for. Def a must."}
{"text":"Recently opened on the King W strip, this jumping place seems to be the new 'it' place.  4 floors of Latin American flair, it will definitely leave a good impression on you at the end of the night!  The first floor is their restaurant- highly recommend reservations if you want a meal here.  The 2nd floor is their cocktail bar/lounge area.  First come first serve and we were lucky to grab one of the last tables.  It's a bit small - long and narrow but nothing a few drinks can't cure!  The drinks here - oh my definitely try the Five Flower - are nicely cultivated with a little of something for everyone.  You won't find these cocktails anywhere else.  They also have wine, beer and tequilas/rum etc if mixed drinks aren't your thing.  The 2nd floor has a tapas style menu but since we didn't try any food here I can't comment on the quality/taste.  But I'm definitely intrigued to come back and grab a bite!  The service was friendly from the hosts on the first floor to the servers on the 2nd floor.  It was busy but everyone was friendly.  Overall a great atmosphere and a lovely way to spend the evening.  It looks unassuming from the outside but once you step inside you just get that fun vibe.   The 3rd floor I believe is a 'secret bar' and the 4th floor is their event/party space.  Definitely will return to try out the food!"}
{"text":"We used to love Valdez and were sad when it closed down. However the chef from Valdez opened up Baro, and we are excited to try it.  The atmosphere is very exciting, this is not a quiet place. We got to our table and the waitress was there in no time telling us about the specials and took our drink order.   The menu is very similar to the Valdez menu. We ate tostada, chicken wings, empanadas, and of course chrizo. The wait was a little long, but before we complained the hostess gave us ceviche complimentary. For dessert we ate churros. The drink and cocktail menu is very extensive, and the prices were very reasonable.   Overall the experience was fantastic! We love Mexican and Latin food, and this place did not disappoint. Highly recommend for anyone."}
{"text":"Omg. This may be my new go to gig in town for a girls night out. The food is amazing. The drinks are a bundle of joy. The ambiance, decor, location. The idea just makes me want to go out again!   The food choice meets many of the criteria I look for in great food. Artistic and color without being afraid to use vibrant colors. Texture that creates a fine balance such as a crunch, topped with a pizazz of fish, finished with a light drizzle. Flavor that mixes well with aroma and keeps things light yet fragrant at the same time. Especially given it was more of a tapas style, it was so fun to gossip with the girls, drink up frothy drinks, and continually reach of food. They do not go light on the alcohol which is nice knowing you get what you pay for. The service was amazing even though it was bustling. The interior was bright, warm, and vibrant and packed with people. Too much fun!  Recommend asking to go to esco-bar through the backroom so you avoid the front lineup. That bar gets packed! Only thing I would say is it could get pricey fast. Three girls with drinks, our bill rocked out to approx $420 for the night.  But hey, worth it. Good food, good drinks, good company is priceless.  Would totally recommend this place and can't wait to go back to it next!"}
{"text":"Baro is sleek, chic, fun, and delicious all at the same time! We came here after careful consideration and recommendation from locals, after all we were only going to be in town for a day on a business trip.  The place is huge with two full floors (that I know of) both with bars and tables. The upstairs layout with couches is more suited for lounging, drinking, and snacking, whereas the bottom floor has bigger tables for a proper sit down dinner. They play great, catchy Latin music here.  For food, we ordered a large array of dishes: CGS ($15, house made chips, guac, salsa): I absolutely love house made chips, it's crispier and fresher. The guac and salsa tasted house made as well. Empanadas ($7, beef, potato, peas): tasty, but not a big fan of empanadas Chicken wings ($15, w/ guava bbq sauce): the wings are so juicy, fresh, and the sauce is delicious! Flight ($32, mixed ceviche): seafood was fresh and I love ceviche Chori papa ($16, chorizo, peppers, goat cheese, tortillas):  Duck chaufa ($35, basically a bibimbap): Weird this dish is called \"chaufa\" and not bibimbap because it's almost exactly what it is. It was very tasty, not heavy with a hint of sweetness. Whole fried fish ($42, branzino, rice, avocado): the fish was excellent, fried perfectly and not overcooked, while remaining tasty.  Everything here was enjoyable from the food to service to the upbeat and chic atmosphere. The only caveat is all menu items are grossly overpriced ($15 for chips and dip, $15 for a few wings, $35 for fried rice, etc)."}
{"text":"Great spot! Went for dinner and got in without reservations. The ceviches are to die for, especially their Nikkei.  The cocktails are good too. I also had the Duck Chaufa which I enjoyed"}
{"text":"A Spanish bar with great music, mediocre service and hit or miss dishes.   I'm not even into Spanish music but their playlist was amazing! It was not even that busy on the Saturday night that we went but the service was quite slow. However, they were polite and very smiley which we always enjoy. For the food, we first ordered a platter of apps which was a HUGE disappointment... we swolled everything down thanks to our bottle of wine which kept us happy. Surprisingly enough that platter filled our bellies to the top but we kept seeing this one dish being sent out from the kitchen. It was the duck charfa, so being the curious people we are, we made the order. It came in a stone bowl and it looked amazing, it smelt amazing and it tasted like heaven!! We were extremely full but we ate us every last grain.   Honestly, that last dish saved this place to give it a second chance. Knowing that dish was good I'm sure there are other delicious dishes on the menu as well. It really is a hit or a miss!   Oh and there is a 2nd floor to this place which is a lounge! Awesome vibe and good music as always."}
{"text":"The portion of main course is huge. It can definitely be shared between 2 persons. Pork chop tasted dry, appetizers are good. Ceviche and octopus are very fresh."}
{"text":"Came here last Sunday to celebrate my sisters birthday.  I'm not going to speak of the expensive prices as I'm okay with paying for quality. This was not quality food. I returned the ceviches I ordered as they smelled and tasted rotten.  This was handed to the manager who with out asking took them from me. I later went up to the manager and spoke to him about the lack of service and the horrible ceviche. He apologized and said he would make it up to the table. We were not compensated for the ceviches, however we did incur additional charges of $4 per person for cutting our cake. I'm completely disappointed and cannot believe the lack of professionalism at an establishment that I've heard so much about. Our group of friends and family won't be returning to this \"restaurant \" nor Will I be recommending it. The 1 star was given because there was no 0 star option."}
{"text":"Update: We were invited back and boy was it a different restaurant. Service was absolutely fantastic and very knowledgeable.  Drinks came quickly and the food was incredible especially considering they just introduced a new spring menu.  A very very special shout out to the beef dish (local lomo?) the glaze on the beef was out of this world and it was truly one of the best mains I've had.   Will return again and would recommend you try it as well at least for a cocktail in the beautiful dining room.  ------------   Extremely mediocre in all senses.  DRINKS -took over 20 mins to get a rye and diet and when we followed up they said the bar was really busy... -they mistakenly brought Rye and gingers instead  FOOD - the food came out before the drinks which was not a good start  - the chips and guac were very tasty, would have paid 7$ for this not $15 - the Tostada was just a giant chip loaded with guac, under it i may have found a tiny bite of chicken  - flank steak with chimmichurri was not warm  - the tamale was a giant corn cake that tasted like cardboard, very dense and completely under seasoned also couldn't taste any chicken in it  Overall the decor and atmosphere were good but compare the prices and food to other great restaurants in king west I would not return or recommend to anyone. The food severely lacked seasoning and service was sub par."}
{"text":"I loved this place... I went with a group of five people where we were able to create our own sharing menu (aside from the pre-composed tasting menu they supply). This afforded us the opportunity to try a wide section of menu items that appealed to us. I can't really choose which dish I liked best, they all had great qualities and flavour - it just kept getting better and better as the food came out!  We decided on the following: - CEVIVHE TIRADITO (albacore tuna + passion fruit & lulo + squash + chile + cilantro + sesame seeds) - SHRIMP TACO (argentine white shrimp + salsa golf + horseradish + tomato + avocado + taro shells + mustard greens) - SEARED SCALLOPS (tamal de olla + crispy maitaki mushrooms + maduro + olive + chia seeds + cherry tomato) - PULPO (charred octopus + chorizo + potato + fennel + tomatillo & poblano + cilantro) - OG DUCK CHAUFA (duck confit + rice + edamame + papi kung fu + chile + tobiko) - LOMO SALTADO (beef tenderloin + pomme anna + seasonal veggies + tomato + soy & ginger jus)  The staff were very helpful and on top of their game considering it was a full house that night. I will definitely be going back to Baro - most likely sooner rather than later...  Side note: The only chink in their armour were the beer options. My friends stuck to the wine & cocktail offerings and they seemed please with their choices..."}
{"text":"The TRUCHA (trout cievche)  was mouthwateringly perfect, so refreshing! I wish I didn't agree to share it lol  EL TIPICO 22  such an interesting combo of flavours, lights but perfect to share with 2/3 ppl so everyone can have a little taste.  Always a great start to snack on and share with the table: house-made chips + guacamole + salsa  SEARED SCALLOPS my favourite item on the menu, cooked to perfection, full of flavour and I'd highly recommend!  I don't typically go for duck with the Chaufa was a generous portion served in a hot stone bowl and full of flavour (highly recommend to share 3/4 people)   LOMO SALTADO the beef tenderloin is melt in your mouth and served with surprisingly crunchy veggies. It's good for that person who is apprehensive about Latin foods or not a huge fan of unique combinations of flavour.  CHORI PAPA 16 although this was a great taster for me, I personally am not a huge potato fan. I think as the manager suggested take it home for leftovers and fry an egg on top for breaky.   The atmosphere is great for a date night, going out w a few friends or out to celebrate. Extensive cocktail list and upbeat music.  I'd share everything on the menu, this is the spot to run down the menu and have your fill!  Exceptionally Friendly service.   CGS 15 house-made chips + guacamole + salsa  TRUCHA 21 trout + pineapple agua chile + lemon + fresh cucumber + avocado + cilantro  EL TIPICO 22 ocean perch + tomato aqua chile + avocado + jicama + sweet potato + citrus + chulpes  SEARED SCALLOPS 25 tamal de olla + crispy maitaki mushrooms + maduro + olive + chia seeds + cherry tomato  CHAUFA 35 duck confit + rice + edamame + egg + papi kung fu + chile + tobiko veg and vegan available 25  CHORI PAPA 16 chorizo + potato + peppers + chipotle golf + goat cheese + 4  our tortillas  LOMO SALTADO 36 beef tenderloin + pomme anna + seasonal veggies + tomato + soy & ginger jus"}
{"text":"My friend and I were walking around King West and stumbled upon this beautiful restaurant. We were planning on going to another restaurant down the street but decided to give this place a try. Honestly I regret this decision because the food was mediocre and not worth the price. I had the Gringo and my friend had the benny. Plates were quite bare and very average tasting. I had to ask the server for butter which he essentially took two slabs from a brick of butter that was hardly melted. I would not come back again, this place is only nice for pictures."}
{"text":"Good food. Nice atmosphere. We went on Valentine's day, they had a special menu. We would go again for sure to try their regular meals..."}
{"text":"Baro opened only 2-3 weeks ago and is the newly reopened and slightly more east (but still on King West) version of Valdez. My group agreed it was a \"soft\" 4 out of 5. Things were generally good and I thouht it was an improvement from Valdez.  The best part of the meal was the duck confit rice (delicious!), branzino was tasty but we recommend to debone it yourself because the server didnt debone the best. The mussels were unfortunatwly undercooked. We ordered the hamachi ceviche which was good. Tamales were a bit bready but cocktails were good. Service was very attentive. Overall a fun place for a group meal but a hit of miss depending on what you order."}
{"text":"A top restaurant choice among the ocean of options in Toronto! Chef Steve Gonzalez and his team are serving up some of the best latin street food in the city. Upon arriving, we were taken to the upstairs bar for a couple cool draft beers prior to dinner. Dinner itself was also a trip; we shared the Octopus, Empanadas, and the Chori Papa, AND all three (3) were displayed beautifully and tasted absolutely delicious. Dessert is a MUST (i.e. the deconstructed Butter Tart). All in all, we had a cool experience at Baro, and look forward to being back."}
{"text":"Baro is a fabulous place for Sunday brunch. I was able to  change my reservations the same day online. It's very fancy and upscale along King Street West.   I loved the decor of this place. Clean wooden tables and chairs. The choice of brown manus complement each other well. The tables had centre pieces of white and purple lilies which was so beautiful and elegant. There were green plants all over which was appreciated for clean fresh air. I also liked the cleanliness of the washrooms. Music was your standard top 40.   It's important to note that their brunch menu closes at 2:45pm. Our waitress was friendly and wished me a happy birthday because she saw it on the reservation details. That's nice customer service. She was very attentive.   Prices are very affordable for brunch here. A good sized plate costs around $17 on average. I ordered a decaf coffee with almond milk and sugar. I got no sugar and had to follow up. It would have been nice to get sugar with my coffee the first time around. I also had a pitcher of sangria. Oh boy, this was a strong pitcher. I definitely paid for what I asked for. Nice and chilled, it was perfect for brunch.   My main order was a side of yuca chips and chipotle mayo. I've never had yuca chips this way so it was interesting to eat. Yuca is a root vegetable similar to the family of sweet potatoes. It is grown in South America. It can be quite bland so flavouring is essential. It is mostly starchy. My main was the avocado toast. It only comes with one egg so clearly I ordered two eggs. It's only one slice of toast aka frono cultura as well. It was kind of small. Eggs only come poached well done or runny. This part of the dish was underwhelming. The avocado was like guacamole. It was tasty. The side salad was huge to say the least. It was an accompaniment of baby kale, arugula, spinach and lettuce: drizzled with walnuts. There was also a few slices of radish. It tasted alright.   Overall, I'll probably visit this place again but order something different on the menu."}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday celebration with my best friend. Restaurant was overall good from service to food and drink.  Drinks - we got the Baro Sour and Man Latin. Baro sour was the clear favourite, very tasty! It's their spin on the pisco sour which is a popular Peruvian drink. The Man Latin was good but I wouldn't recommend if you don't like strong tasting drinks, it's more of a sipping kind of drink.  Food -started with the tostada, a giant chip with guac & chicken on top ($7). Guac was smooth and the combo of chip chicken and guac was a good light started. Probably a dish you could make at home. -next, we had the Chori Papa which definitely my kind of comfort food with a baked dish of chorizo, potato, onion and peppers. You also get 4 warm flour tortillas to make your own little wrap.  -for our main, we got the duck chaufa, this thing is huge, could probably share with 2-3 people. This is a tasty rice dish with duck. It's for a hint of spicy for those spicy lovers. It's a nice warm filling dish on a cold day.  Had a good experience. Food is on the pricey side but definitely worth the experience."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I came here on a Thursday around 5pm and had no trouble getting a table. We decided to dine at Pablos since they had happy hour specials. We ordered the fish tacos, mac and cheese, pulpo (charred octopus), and 15 oysters (it was $1 each)!! We also got a large pitcher of red sangria for only $20 which was amazing.   Our server Rosa was super attentive! She had a very likable personality and made our dining experience that much more enjoyable. :)"}
{"text":"Wait is it Miami or Toronto?  On the inside you wouldn't know where you are.  Caught Baro last week during a business trip and loved the vibe.  We ordered pretty much all the small plates and they ranged from average (pork) to good (empanadas) to awesome (most of the other things).  The crowd seemed very \"look at me\" but still liked the scene.  Will definitely go back next time I am in town - hopefully when it is nicer and the roof is open.  We checked out the second floor lounge and it was loud and full of v-neck t-shirts.  Not my scene.  Interesting place overall."}
{"text":"Every time I visit Baro I always have the best service, food always taste yummy! The consistency of this place makes me always come back since it's such a great spot to catch up with friends.  They have a good selection of cocktails too.   Some of the food I recommend trying out when you visit: Seared Scallops $23 There's about 3-4 scallops and they cook perfectly! This dish is a must try.   Empanadas $7 Comes in 4, one of the best I had try in the city. The sauce that pairs with is soo good I always ask for extra.   Yuca fries $7 Cook perfectly and has a nice soft crunch   OG duck Chaufa $35 This is a dish I always get when I'm here. It's a very filing dish."}
{"text":"Baro, nice cozy spot, with a young, latin vibe. Great service and fun music. Enjoyed the mixed platter of ceviche and some st simon oysters.  Although I was clearly the oldest person there, I felt very at home. I recommend if you are in the neighbourhood. :)"}
{"text":"My hubby and I came here on my birthday and we were very well accommodated that night. Fun and spacious decor, fantastic cocktails, huge portions (I meant HUGE), excellent service and the price was right. Even though I still think Valdez was better in terms of the culinary quality but to be honestly fair, Baro is pretty decent too. My hubby and I ordered the Tasting Menu and oh my lord, the portions were huge and we ended up having two large boxes of take-away at the end of night. We will probably come back to check out other floors for a different vibe and experience."}
{"text":"Went to Baro for the first time on a date, and although the date didn't go so well, this place is my new favourite bar.   Their cocktails are delicious, pretty, and boozy. The second floor is loungey, cozy, and usually lively. I went on a Friday night and it got crowded - people were standing around everywhere chatting with one another, but Saturdays seem more tamed. The couches are first come first serve but can reserve if you really need.   Apparently there's an upstairs which is a big loft-like space for events and dancing?   I haven't had a proper meal here yet either than some chips and dip, which were pretty good for such a simple order.  Looking forward to checking out their half priced wine Wednesdays! .... But will probably keep getting their old fashioneds!"}
{"text":"Closer to 4.5 stars.  The food was very very good.  We ordered the beef meatballs, empanadas, the chorizo dish, and the duck confit with fried rice.  Every dish was distinct, flavourful, and had been carefully prepared.  Unlike a lot of \"small plate\" places, the portions here are a good size.  The duck confit was an impressive amount.  There were two of us and we were very full, at the end of the meal.  The staff were friendly and very attentive; my water glass was never half-full.    It's also a fun, lively space.  They're doing a take-off, from Spanish \"street food\", but higher end.    The only \"con\"?  Maybe a little loud?  (Hint: I'm stretching to find a con)  For two people, with dessert and 4 drinks = $150 (before tip)."}
{"text":"Pretty fun spot and the food was very good. Port tacos were excellent and the ceviche was also very good.   Service was friendly and great atmosphere. Overall a cool spot."}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I came here for our GNO after hearing good reviews about this place and was pretty disappointed with the food and service. Upon entry we were greeted by the hostess who was very nice and seated us at a table in the back area of the restaurant. The ambiance was pretty romantic with dim lighting and Spanish music in the background. My girlfriend and I ordered a bottle of white wine, ceviche and rice and beans while we waited for the rest of our friends to join us. The hamachi ceviche was salty and a bit on the fishy side and the rice and beans looked like jail food or something, pretty flavorless IMO. I just returned from Barcelona last November and had some wonderful Spanish tapas there so I wasn't too impressed with the food at Baro. My girlfriend later on ordered the duck confit which tasted pretty good but looked more like a seafood fried rice in a stone bowl they might have served at a place such as kingyo izakaya or a jambalaya restaurant. The real turning point at this restaurant was when I asked the server about the wine. My girlfriends and I were having a hard time drinking it because it tasted unlike any pinot grigio we've had. It was tart and a bit carbonated on the tongue almost like a moscato without the sweetness. To me, it was pretty disgusting and I was struggling to drink it. I had no problem paying for a bottle of wine that I ordered but I figured I'd ask the waitress out of curiosity what the wine was supposed to taste like in case there was something wrong with it. She then gave a weary look and told us she will talk to her manager. They basically spoke around ten min later in front of our table, and although she apologized for the delay, the manager never once approached our table to find out what the problem was or came to make sure we were doing alright. The waitress came back to our table and took the bottle (which was NOT empty) and said she will get someone at the bar to taste it. She came back and said it was fine and that it was supposed to taste like that. I thanked her for checking and made a mental note not to order that wine again. Although I didn't like the wine, it would have been nice if they returned the bottle that we not finished so one of my other girlfriends could have had it. I found that this was very unacceptable and was insulted that the problem wasn't rectified in a manner that was not speedy or satisfactory. I ended up paying for the wine, which we never got back and still received no word from the manager. I walked out feeling like I did something wrong by asking a question about a shitty 50 dollar bottle of wine that we never even got back. Zero stars for customer service."}
{"text":"Can't speak for the food, but the drinks were refreshing, strong, and delicious :) I really enjoyed the mix of hip hop and it was a friendly crowd"}
{"text":"Had dinner here last Saturday, followed by drinks upstairs.  Food was just okay. The best thing on the menu was a rice dish reminiscent of stuffed pepper filling. Delicious.  Everything else we ordered (2 types of ceviche, \"big ass steak\", and a whole bunch of other things I can't remember) was unremarkable.  Lots of beautiful people in here and I loved the decor. This is what earned it 3 stars.  Club upstairs is WAY overcrowded. Stayed a grand total of 7 minutes before breaking free. Wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"WHAT TO TRY?  Known for their Latin dishes, if it's your first time and have an appetite, try their Latino Party Set dinner. It comes with four courses. First it's the chips, guac and salsa - guac is made in house and can be right in front of you if you sit by the right corner of the bar!! The chips are not just the regular tortilla chips but also taro, banana, purple yam, yaca root - very fresh and crispy.   Then you have Nikkei which is a ceviche with hamachi and ponzu sauce. A bit on the sour side with the overpowering lime juice but it's quite a refreshing appetizer.   Then comes a pan of various sorts of Latino food including empanadas, chicken wings (absolutely loved the smoked guava BBQ sauce!! The chicken wings were crisp and flavorful on the outside and juicy in the inside! And arepitas which is a white corn meal that's fried with honey butter and queso d'hoja   The chaufa is a fusion of Asian and Latin cuisine with rice in the hot stone pot served with duck confit and edamame and egg. I personally loved this dish not only for its flavours that remind me of my Asian cuisine but it's cleverness in combining these two cuisines together. Very tasty!  Lastly, was the ginger and chile popsicle that's water based, but still got a taste of some fruit notes like mango and apricot even though this popsicle might not have those ingredients!  Last tips: the latino party set dinner is cheaper on Sundays! If you want to save some money, ($55 pp vs $45 pp) go on Sunday! If you can choose to sit by the bar, you can see the business of the chefs in the kitchen and can find out more about the dishes having that 1:1 experience with the chefs. Usually Kevin, the head chef is in so you can get a full story about how each dish is made! The staff were all friendly! If you decide to do a-la-carte, I suggest not to skip out on the chips and guacamole appetizer, the chicken wings and the chaufa rice dish! All were really good so hard to choose, I know."}
{"text":"This place is called a Latin American bar/restaurant but we spent the night listening to hip hop music (like any other place nearby) because the only place with Latin music was the restaurant downstairs which closes at 12am. Fail!   So if you are looking for a cool place with Latino vibe and great service do not waste your time there. A friend had high expectations to celebrate her 30th birthday there and we she got was an unpleasant night  The service was the worst, rude and disrespectful. I don't like to share bad reviews but this is something that I need to share with everyone interested on this place to eat and party."}
{"text":"Good food and drinks. Good vibe. Similar to Valdez, with some new items. A bit pricier. Have not checked out escobar yet, but I heard it's more of a scene now. My only criticism is that they don't call back or have a good reservation policy. I left messages twice and they went unanswered and they were really unaccommodating with a group reservation where they were insisting on a set menu for a group of 8 on a weeknight.   Would go back."}
{"text":"Our waitress was hilarious and knew the menu very well! Food was superb. Definitely a must-try."}
{"text":"Came to Pablo for their happy hour deal, which is $5 select tacos, 5 oysters for $5, and $20 pitchers of sangria/mojitos. We got a small pitcher of sangria (about 6 glasses?). The sangria tasted literally like orange juice and wine, there were no other fruits in it. It was okay for the price I guess.   I wish they had more items available but the interior is nice for a small group after work hangout!"}
{"text":"From 5pm to 7pm weekdays you get to enjoy $1 raw oysters and $5 wine upstairs from Baro's called Pablo's Snack House.  The oysters are fresh.  Definitely will go back for more oysters. What i really enjoyed about my time at Pablo's is that the ambience is very relaxing.  There are a combination of tables and chairs, as well as sofas where you can just hang out with your friends.  On top of that,  the associates working there are so nice and personable.   Can't wait to go back there again."}
{"text":"Went here yesterday for apps and drinks, as such was only on the second floor.  Apps were good not great, I really liked the sloppy joses, the salsa was interesting as well with a hint of cumin in it.  Great music but a little loud for so early in the night.  Very difficult to get a drink at the bar but once we secured a comfy sofa the vibe was great.  Smallish beer list, very good cocktails! Decor and ambience in an old Colombian style, very well done, I would definitely return."}
{"text":"Sooo goodd!! The cocktails are awesome! The service is great! The foood is sooo unique & delicious!!! The staff is supper nice. They sent a bottle of champagne after a table/reservations mix up. Friday night is salsa night!!!"}
