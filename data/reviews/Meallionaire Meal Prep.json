{"text":"Hands down the best meal prep I have had. My life is busy and I don't get the chance to cook how I like but MEALLIONAIRE filled that void. The chicken is so juicy and never dry like some others I have tried. What makes it the best is the owner is super nice and always available to answer questions. I really like how the meals are made fresh the day I pick them up that way I know they will last and be fresh for another week at least. The names of the meals are fun and different. I always have a great experience when I order from them. I would highly recommend this company for those needing fresh, flavor meals!! Thank you guys for these yummy meals!"}
{"text":"I was so happy to find Meallionaire and the variety that they offer. I ordered the Karma, Jamaican Me Crazy, & Cajun Me In, and all were delicious! I do have to say the Cajun Me In was my favorite - the salmon was so flavorful and juicy. I love that they have meals for all tastes including vegans, vegetarians, gluten-free, etc. If you want the convenience of having meal prep done for you & enjoy the taste of your food, all while eating healthy...then Meallionaire is your go to!"}
