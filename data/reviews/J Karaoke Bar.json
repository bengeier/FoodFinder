{"text":"Food was delicious, best food we've eaten so far in vegas! And the prices are really good. The karaoke was soo much fun! We could have been there all night"}
{"text":"My friends had the birthday party there, thus we went there for dinner and party.  It was fun.  Food is great and people are so nice there.  Fast service.   Pretty clean.  We tried garlic chicken and fried calamari.  We love it.   We had fun for karaoke as well.  We already said we would go back again."}
{"text":"We love J Karaoke! Great service, great atmosphere, and amazing food! Please order the fried chicken! It's a must! The soju is amazing too!"}
{"text":"This place has an amazing atmosphere!  The bartenders are not only nice but very attentive. Food here is amazing since it's also part of the sushi resturant DOH. This is a fun place and I can't even begin to describe the rooms! Different themes and all. J karaoke us a MUST!"}
{"text":"I like this place a lot. It's fun to have a private room with close friends or colleagues and sing your favorite songs. The only thing I wish... is that the list was updated. There's more songs in Korean than there are in English. Definitely a place to try out though."}
{"text":"The best!! friendly staff awesome soju awesome food what else can you ask?? Great environment!! shorter waiting time compared to the rest karaoke bars!!"}
{"text":"This is now my favorite place to go! I always have fun here and suggest all my friends to go as well! Every time I'm there Antonio takes care of me! Everyone is so nice and friendly ! 10/10 would recommend."}
{"text":"This is my first time here and this one of the best experiences I've had. Staff are amazing and efficient to serving you. I would recommend this place to all my family and friends. Thank you so much!!!"}
{"text":"The staff was super helpful and accommodating. Their rooms have plenty of space (we had 15 in our party) and we all still had plenty of space. Welcoming and homie atmosphere. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This place has a cool little bar up front and private karaoke rooms in the back. Cool laid vibe place with a nice vibe. Good place to bring a group."}
{"text":"Fun place to do karaoke. Great service. Only con is that parking is a challenge. Other than that, I enjoyed my time. We'll be coming again for sure."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! Joseph and all the bartenders were nice and friendly. I tried the hypnotic breeze which was awesome. They also sell food! I tried the grilled corn, simple with enough flavor! Def recommend this place to chill out have a drink and socialize!"}
{"text":"One of the better karaoke spots. The bar is great, food is great, heard the fried chicken is the best. Tonight , was introduced to this great drink, NIKKA. I will come again"}
{"text":"I love this place! Great interior, upscale atmosphere. We tried J chicken and pilaf, and they were delish  with reasonable prices. Since it opened recently, the inside was very clean, modern and artsy. Good people good music, good food.  Definitely will come back:)"}
{"text":"this place is awesome! great food and drinks, great music selection, awesome hosts. definitely a great choice to get your karaoke fix!"}
{"text":"I have never been to a karaoke  bar before and was a little nervous but the staff was so welcoming and made me feel at home. And great prices on their beer buckets is a plus!!!! I can t wait to come back."}
{"text":"This is my best friends new favorite place. It marries everything she love including a wine bar, karaoke and a bookshelf. Antonio is very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"It was our first time here, celebrating my sons 21st birthday. It wasn't what I expected. All the karaoke rooms are isolated and closed off. The bar area is the entry way into the joint, about 20 feet all around. Not much space to be out with others, no dance space. It's great if you have a private party with big groups.  The staff is nice. Karaoke charged by the hour, pretty affordable rates. Overall not bad, but it's not open for karaoke sharing to a crowd of that's what you are expecting."}
{"text":"love this place clean and nice have good food and customer service specially recommend bbq cream chicken and bingsoo which is korean style sherbet definitely will come next time soon"}
{"text":"These place is awesome love the atmosphere and the staff are super courteous. The bartender Eddie is exquisite and very knowledgeable. The food is second to none very delicious from the variety of pastas to the sushi. Every thing is made to order which gives the food a more fresh taste to the already stupendous menu. I recommend this place to anyone that wants to have a great time and enjoy delicious food."}
{"text":"This place is great. Came here for my first time in Vegas and I love karaoke so my group of friend decided to check this place out. The guy working here tonight was very polite and helpful. Prices are a pretty decent price. It's about $20/hr and drinks are cheap. On Sunday and Monday's you can get a shot of Jameson and any bottled beer for $8. Bottles of soju are $8 daily + there is a great selection of mixed drinks and wines.  Food is really good too, fresh and tasty! Restrooms are clean and rooms are soundproof so you can really go all in! I would recommend this to anyone who wants to let loose and have fun with their friends."}
{"text":"My new favorite spot!  Karaoke rooms are great and themed! Food is yummy and the bartenders are awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Best place to have fun with your friends! Friendly, Great prices and all around an awesome time! They catered to our every need and made sure we had a great time! Can't wait to do it again!"}
{"text":"This is the best karaoke bar I've ever been to! The ambience, service and food are all fantastic. I ordered the bbq chicken, which was so savory I would order it again. The pineapple crush (? I forgot the name) was my favorite drink. The karaoke rooms were equally impressive with their unique styles and high quality sound systems. And I absolutely love the fact that there's a LIBRARY with a neat selection of books! It's such an awesome hangout to bring your friends. YOU MUST GO!!"}
{"text":"The best ... EVER ... definitely a place to go hang out ... very very friendly people and great great customer service"}
{"text":"We had a great time and really enjoyed the atmosphere all evening.  Previous review mentioned a higher than expected total when my bill cleared.  To J Karaoke Bar's credit, they refunded the dollar after seeing the review here. Thanks to their team for being on the ball."}
{"text":"this place is really nice. Very friendly servers. The bathroom is a plus too, since it's really clean! Been here a couple of times & never had a bad time."}
{"text":"I just recently celebrated my birthday party here and it was awesome! I booked a reservation online through their website about a week in advance for a group of 12. The staff continually called me to confirm the reservation and I made a bunch of changes to it throughout the week and they were still able to accommodate me. None of my friends had ever had the private room karaoke experience and they all had a blast. The staff is super attentive and they are very prompt and friendly with their service. I've never written a review for a place before but after our experience, I just had to. Thanks everyone at J Karaoke!"}
{"text":"Favorite spot to come after a long day! Always feel welcomed by the staff as soon as i step foot in to this modern establishment. I've been here a few times and never had a dull moment. Staff is always professional and know how to keep their guests happy! They have a wide variety of alcohol, unlike other karaoke joints. The servers and bartenders are hot too! #1 chill spot/karaoke in my books so far!!!"}
{"text":"This place is dope! The design and decor is very modern and chic. The rooms and pricing is great and the staff is super friendly and accommodating. Definitely making this place my main stop for karaoke!"}
{"text":"The place is beautiful inside super nice friendly staff and clean, but I have to say that I did not like the specialty fries. It was a good portion to share but taste wise- didn't go so well."}
{"text":"Great place to spend your night times! Very upscale decor, great sound system for karaoke rooms.  We ordered fried chicken and some appetizer dishes, honey honey cheap, and they were so good!  Highly recommend this place if you want to have some fun with your buddys!"}
{"text":"So much fun! Karaoke with your friends without feeling stage fright! Wish there were other locations in my own city. Definitely a must!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Don't forget to grab a drink at the bar, it'll make you sing better!"}
{"text":"Came here for a work related function & I enjoyed everything but the smell. They have a very wide variety of karaoke music. They have good snacks and beers.  I'm giving it 5 stars because the employees were very friendly and courteous. I'm going to give the overall place 4 stars thought because the room that we were in smelled like a bathroom. It made my experience a bit unpleasant.  Maybe we just came in on a bad day. I don't know, but I wouldn't come here again unless I had to."}
{"text":"Great place! We went in to celebrate a friends birthday, and they were helpful and kind enough to let us bring in a cake early. The song choices were all there, and the rooms were large as we had 16 people comfortably seated. Great bar, and easy to use karaoke system as well. Only complaint we as a group had was that there was only 1 Taylor Swift songs we knew and it was one of her older songs, but I guess Vegas isn't big on Taylor Swift."}
{"text":"Been here twice one separate occasions with my siblings on during our Vegas trips. My sister recommended this place based on the yelp reviews. We have never gone to a karaoke bar in Vegas but we were trying to be adventurous.   The first time we came here we were unable to get a room, I forget if it was because our sister was underage at the time. Nevertheless, we were hungry and decided to eat dinner here. We ordered the Specialty french fries, chicken wings (soy garlic and korean spicy sweet), spicy rice cake, and mild ramen with egg. THE FOOD IS AMAZING. My favorite is the specialty french fries although I wish they had 2 eggs instead of one and the soy garlic chicken wings. My siblings were pleased by the food, nothing was bland or dry.   The second time we came here, we were able to get a karaoke room and soju! The lychee soju was great. I love the karaoke rooms, probably the best I have been to so far. They have so many songs to choose from (english, korean, japanese, filipino) and you can adjust the settings. The karaoke system here had the best sounds. They even have tambourines in the room that people can play while singing.   I don't think 4 hours of singing was enough for the 4 of us. Wish we could've stayed longer. Will come again if I am in a singing mood or just want to eat good pupus."}
{"text":"My second time here! Brought my cousin out to check this place out. He loves karaoke bars so it was only natural to bring him out to this establishment! They always have prompt service and great food! I wouldn't be surprised if we come back for a third time!"}
{"text":"Super fun place.  If you like karaoke it's great to have a private room.  Selection of songs is smaller for English but there is still soooo many to choose from.  Cocktails and food are also available"}
{"text":"Great staff that they have going on here. Very friendly. The karaoke rooms has a huge variety of songs. Can't go wrong with this place."}
{"text":"Great song selection, room is a good size, acoustics is good. Food and drinks are great!"}
{"text":"Just walked in and the staff are so friendly!  Clean rooms, big rooms, fast service. Better than  most karaoke bars for sure.    We had calamari fries, garlic chicken, and special fries.  It was very good!!!  Will be back for future events."}
{"text":"Place is boss as hell!! Great service and great food! Drinks are on point! We love this place!"}
{"text":"Great little karaoke place in Chinatown. They had a good selection of drinks and food on the menu. Song selection was pretty great and rooms were comfy and clean. The barkeeps were super friendly and polite. The only downside perhaps was the wait (as expected on a Saturday night) as we were given a 45 minute expected wait time that ended up closer to 1.5 hrs. We were offered a couple of free beers after our expected wait time was up as they were waiting to free up a room. Overall a pretty nice karaoke place but be ready to wait your turn on a busy night!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere.  Perfect for any occasion.  The private rooms can accommodate up to 30 people.  The staff is very friendly.  The rooms are very inexpensive.  We had a great time!  We will definitely come back the next time we're in Vegas!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! The drinks are perfect, the staff is super friendly. The food is delicious. Joseph David, Jake, eddie are awesome bartenders. What more could I say about the new karaoke hot stop in Vegas? Definitely come check it out!!!"}
{"text":"A great place to do karaoke. Definitely recommend. A lot of great workers and has a great variation of food and alcoholic beverages. I definitely recommend"}
{"text":"Clean and great service from everyone we encountered: bar tender, owner, room assistant person  It's a cute little bar in front and karaoke rooms in back  Large selection of songs"}
{"text":"Love this place!!!!!! Awesome cocktails and super cool bartender!!!! Got 10% off right away went here in my birthday and had an amazing night!"}
{"text":"Happy hour is 6pm to 9pm and great time to enjoy date night with friends that \"can't\" stay out too late because of adulting.    Love the scoring after each song, build some competition for the night.  Great selection of new songs and the remote is easy to manage to search by artist.   Food was great, must try their Korean chicken wings and calamari. The only thing we didn't do and should have done was order some soju bombs"}
{"text":"This place has great food and great drinks! Great place for us to have a chill night I highly recommend this place if you want to have a good time!!"}
{"text":"Had dinner at Lotus of Siam and tried to find karaoke at one of the places in the same strip mall, but everything was either closed or actually a hostess club. Took a car across town to J karaoke and it was great - friendly staff, good prices, good sound system, decent English song selection. Everyone has a good time - it was everything we were hoping for and we'd definitely go again."}
{"text":"Awesome place, arrived pretty late, but the personnel were very accommodating.  Had a great time for the price."}
{"text":"This place is amazing !!!! Came in here after having a couple drinks at the golden tiki on a Wednesday night and everything hit the spot ! We ordered wings with Bbq and spicy Sweet sauce with the Cajun fries and they were bomb af  The music and atmosphere and food made me wonder why I've never been in here before Lol will for sure come back, the staff was super attentive and super nice too. They even gave us some free water bottles since it was hot out"}
{"text":"First time here pleasantly surprise didn't do karaoke just sat at the bar order some gin and tried a couple of their best appetizers Korean ribs and fries. Will definitely come back and recommend"}
{"text":"This Place is really awesome. It has a great atmosphere and the staff here is really cool. If your a local and want to do karaoke, this is the place to be."}
{"text":"First timer here & we had a blast! Came here with a few friends to celebrate my hubby's birthday after eating a nice dinner around Chinatown.  Actually, we were trying to get into another karaoke bar up the road but they gave us the run around & we said forget it... let's go to J's & check it out.  Best choice!! At 3am, we had the best time for a couple more hours before we ended our night.  We ordered a bucket of beers & sang the night away. LOL.  Staff got us a room real quick & they were also very nice. We got a medium size room.  More than enough for us.  Their song selections were pretty good too.  We stayed till closing & it didn't feel like we were being rushed either.  I'd definitely come back here for sure as probably our go-to spot.  From what I remember, the pricing for the room wasn't too bad either. Our group split the bill which wasn't a whole lot for the 2 hours we stayed there.  Bathrooms were also clean but a bit dark for me.  Not the greatest when you're a bit too tipsy ya know??? LOL. Then again, no one wants to see your drunk a$$ roaming around lookin' like a hot mess. Hahaha! Maybe turn up the lights up just a tad bit??? Anyhow, this place is fun! Must try!"}
{"text":"We came for a bachelorette party. Made reservations a few hours before and were easily accommodated. Great selection of songs. And we loved the soju cocktails!"}
{"text":"Always love coming here! Amazing staff, especially Antonio! He was super welcoming and friendly. Me and my friends always have fun and they're constantly checking on us and making sure everyone is super happy! Love it here!!!"}
{"text":"Very nice ambience, great environment to come down to relax and listen to great music. Great service and excellent drinks. Ask for Antonio. Thanks Antonio!"}
{"text":"So much fun!! You can fit at least 8 people comfortably. They have a great song selection and the service is easily requested by the push of a button. Antonio helped us and he was amazing! Can't wait to come back for more celebrations amor just plain fun.  *great drinks *great ramen"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, great environment! Best karaoke in Vegas! Totally recommend!! antonio was really helpful and accommodating!"}
{"text":"Super good! The hosts were extremely nice and told us about happy hour and gave us 10% of for industry night. Will definitely be going back here!"}
{"text":"Came here for my friend's surprise b-day party recently on a Saturday evening. We had kept the birthday boy with us while eating dinner while the rest of the party got essentially the largest room this place has to offer (Room M - located in the far back of the venue, the last room to the left). Since we were rushing in for a surprise, we didn't look at the beginning at the venue and went to the room.   Located next to Marugame Monzo, it is along with other places in one of the hardest strip malls to park at. Most of us has had multiple experiences in the difficulty of parking in this strip mall. Theres so much this strip mall offers, and not enough parking. There's tons more parking located 2 building back but theres no easy way to access it.   Room M is the largest room they have to offer (I believe). It has 3 long tables lining the sides of the room with a large TV in the front and smaller TV to the rear. This room can easily fit 20 people with probably room to spare. Theres enough room that even with the seats filled, the center of the room Is still empty for uh ... \"entertainment\" XD This room prices at I believe $60/hour, which isn't bad if you have enough people to split but the drinks stack up. Between a few of us, we had gotten a bucket of Cass (6 bottles) and a large bottle of Lychee Soju. Seats were fairly clean but the tables would do a better cleaning. We were given complimentary French fries to each table in the room. What was surprising was the microphones are both wireless. Never had seen that in karaoke places here. And each microphone has a replaceable cover over it too.   We had paid separately. Due to possibly the size of the room or maybe the number of people, they had placed an automatic 18% gratuity, plus the bucket and soju totaling into mid 30s, which resulted in the bill getting to mid 40s after the gratuity.   Not much of a fan of kararoke esp since majority of the songs I listen to aren't usually available nor am I much of a singer.. Quite the shy type XD"}
{"text":"If your looking to have fun with family or anybody, head on down to J Karaoke Bar. It's not that far from everything, and it's worth the drive. They have food, drinks and music. And it's next to China town. It's my first time here, and they have karaoke, YAY. So sing you heart out and let loose, have fun."}
{"text":"Fantastic Karaoke bar! Great bartenders Tony and Chase with great selection of beers. Definitely worth the night out!"}
{"text":"So much fun there! Service was amazing and they are so fast and explain everything so well there! Definitely my new karaoke spot!"}
{"text":"Great Atmosphere. Great food and drinks. Antonio is a master behind the bar! If you are looking for a great hang, this is a place! The Korean short rib salad is amazing!"}
{"text":"So nice staffs. Nice design. Nice drink!!!!!  high quality sound system!  U guys should come hereeeee To visit my crewssssss"}
{"text":"Love this place!!!! Great selection.   Theresa a lot of Korean songs but enough to choose from!  There  are individual room and alcohol!!!"}
{"text":"Impecable service! Shoutout to Joseph who made this traveler feel right at home! P.s. the food is aaammmaazzzziiinnnggg"}
{"text":"First time here and staff is great, food, entertainment & vibe-- had a great time on my bday with family and friends .."}
{"text":"Antonio, Jake & Sean are definitely the best bartenders in Vegas, there's also really good music. I always have the best time here, I highly recommend it to any local or even tourist."}
{"text":"The Karaoke experience was great! The workers are amazing! Their music selection updates every month and it's never a disappointment. Will definitely come back and sing karaoke again"}
{"text":"I decided to reserve a private karaoke room here for my birthday and it was totally worth it. The larger room is 40 bucks per hour and the staff is 100% helpful and nice. I loved this place. They had a decent selection of songs. I had a pretty big group with me and they kept the beer flowing, service is awesome. I would very much recommend this place. I had so much fun."}
{"text":"Best karaoke in town! The  GUYS are great here,  always greeted with a smile. .. Well stocked full bar. .. Trendy, great atmosphere,  top of the line rooms and equipment! My friends and I are regulars here we never go anywhere else!"}
{"text":"Had a BLAST here! Rented a room for 12 people. Good decor and seating. The happy hour room rate is a STEAL. Great happy hour specials on food and drinks.  Music selection was pretty good. Lots of popular music. Was pleasantly surprised by the hip hop selection. There's also a button inside the room you can press for service. Service is great. Even on a busy night they took good care of us. I will most definitely be back. Everyone at my party had a great time."}
{"text":"J Karaoke Bar was such a blast. Me and my friends had an amazing time. We ordered one room and spent our time for 100%. So sorry that I can set only five stars. I would give all 10. IT WAS AWESOME. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Went here recently for a friend's birthday celebration and the service is tops. Not only did we get complimentary  (and great tasting!) shots, we got tasty complimentary food too! Staff are really helpful and friendly, and they even adjusted the hourly rate after most of the party left. We usually go to Q a few blocks further west, but I think this place is bunches better. They're songbooks are updated too! I love the ambience of the place: decor and lounge music were to my liking. Props!"}
{"text":"Best karaoke bar in town! Service us amazing everyone is friendly and fun! If they werent working we would have invited them out with us lol! The food and drinks were so good and came out fast and it was all very affordable which is hard to come by in Vegas! The music lists are up to date and the whole vibe of the place is fun and current!"}
{"text":"A gem. You well be surprised seriously.  Let me give you some ideas of why you want to come:  real books on the wall to read.  Open late.  Karaoke galore.  Private rooms and lounge. Great great great. And did I say great drink prices!!!!  Seriously. You need to come. First time but fun... and food."}
{"text":"The best karaoke bar EVER!! Clean, great sound system, great service and very attentive staff."}
{"text":"Great place to be! Jim is a great sever/host! We come here all the time and the customer service is never short of awesome!!"}
{"text":"Love this bar!!  Ambiance is pretty and nice. Food and drinks are cheap and super delicious.  Service was awesome and helpful. We even went a little too crazy in the karaoke room. Got a good long list of songs to sing. Slightly disappointed that we couldn't find some recent songs available but that's any other karaoke joint. I blame the company who makes karaoke books.   Definitely my favorite place. Been to other karaoke bars around town and this place tops it. It's chill and welcoming."}
{"text":"Came here with my team who are mostly non asian, got a bottle of jameson, a bottle of soju, a few shots and they had the TIME OF THEIR LIVES SINGING TO JUSTIN BEIBER. trust me, it works. I love this place.  I will bring them here over and over in the future and make them memorize big bang and 2ne1."}
{"text":"Always a good time with great food, I enjoy how the sound system and comfortable rooms"}
{"text":"This was a totally fun night! The staffer who assisted was very friendly and pleasant. It was happy hour when we went, which meant not only drink specials, but half-price karaoke rooms. Just $10 an hour for a small room. The song selection was pretty large. The videos that accompanied the songs were hilarious. We enjoyed a couple hours of karaoke and a couple bottles of soju. Very fun! And all the walls are chalkboard paint, so you can do a little art too. The rooms were spacious and comfy. It's got a nice ambiance. It definitely gets crowded late at night, so you might have a wait. But if you go during happy hour (ends at 9pm), it wasn't crowded at all and we had no wait. I'd definitely come back."}
{"text":"J Karaoke is AWESOME! We ended up here after hanging around the Cosmopolitan and feeling like we needed to get off the strip.  It was a dual birthday celebration weekend and J Karaoke was a must do!  The vibe there is very relaxed and welcoming.  The staff was super friendly and helpful throughout our time there and we were immediately escorted to our own room upon arrival.  The only negative thing I can say about J Karaoke is that they have a smaller selection of songs in English (but SO MANY in Korean!). However, in many ways, this added to the overall experience of feeling authentic.  The drinks were stiff here and well worth the price and we tried some bar snacks that were even better than expected.  Get the Ranch Fries and the Corn Cheese.  We had no clue what corn cheese was but I felt like it was imperative that I tried it.  I will keep you all guessing, but order it!"}
{"text":"Awesome karaoke bar in the heart of Vegas' Chinatown. Great service and not too crowded. So much selection including English, Korean, Tagalog, Japanese, Chinese songs. They have a full bar, and delicious soju cocktails. And they have my fave-pineapple cider on tap."}
{"text":"Came in here for for a quick beer. Bartenders were cool, music was fabulous and the overall atmosphere was cool! A great place to unwind after a stressful work day! Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I was here last night after I had just landed and I gotta say it was fun. My favorite had to be the food."}
{"text":"Good food and karaoke always a good combo! Fun place to get away to away from the strip! Rent a room and sing your heart out..."}
{"text":"WMM (worth my money) rating  5 out of 5!!  I apologize I'm in Vegas and I'm doing this with a few drinks. I can simply say I love this place. Stumbled in here while waiting for a reservation and ordered a few drinks before dinner.   They are awesome!!! Great liquor selection as well as they take pride in their cocktails. A plus for Vegas off the strip...  A beautiful selection of karaoke rooms and did I say the bartenders are awesome. If your a Japanese beer fan they have \"Hitachino\" on tap..What!!!!  A must for drink or two before the party gets going..."}
{"text":"This was such a fun experience! The facilities are so clean and the songs are up to date. The food was okay, it seems that the food was a bit pricey and it wasn't as flavorful as Bazic's was before the management change. The drinks are on point and all the Soju flavors are delicious, they were also very strong. Overall, we will be heading out here again, the location is okay and the parking is horrendous on a weekend night."}
{"text":"I can't count how many times I have been here for karaoke or even just drinks at the bar. I should be part of their VIP club haha. Happy hour is from 6-9pm daily where rooms are half off, well drinks are $4 and bottled beer is $3. They offer food as well. Most of the time my party will just show up randomly and be able to rent out a small/medium room without any wait.  This last weekend I had reserved the VIP room which holds 20+ for a work gathering event. I had called about a month in advance to reserve since it was a Friday night and I know the place can get packed.  ***Other karaoke joints would not let me reserve a room even when I offered to pay in advance. They said its first come first serve.*** Shout out to Antonio who helped out with everything. I love to sing, so of course I had a blast. The rest of the party did also! Service was excellent and fast. You push that red button and someone will be there to assist you. Song selection is pretty good and they add new songs often. The remote is easy to navigate, they'll even give u a tutorial in the beginning if you are not familiar with it. Parking sucks in this plaza, especially if you come during dinner time because there are soooo many businesses. Note: the VIP room is in the back (room M) and everytime their back door was open a foul smell would come in. Keep your door closed so the smell won't come in."}
{"text":"Super clean Spacious rooms Food and drink selection is vast  Solid track options  Service is responsive  Cost is decent, didn't feel like the rooms were super overpriced   Overall Thoughts  Karaoke isn't my cup of tea but J Karaoke makes it worth wild with it's end to end approach"}
{"text":"Everyone go see my boy Antonio. He is the best bartender in Vegas. They play any song you like! They are the best bar in town!!"}
{"text":"BEST karaoke bar we have been to by far. We have been to our fair share of karaoke bars, namely in LA, but J Karaoke Bar stands out amongst them all. We wanted to sing K on our little getaway in Vegas and we're glad we found this spot. Fully stocked bar, right off the strip, and a fantastic selection of English/JPop/Chinese/Koop songs. We have no complaints whatsoever. The servers here are also extremely attentive and prompt. We are impressed!   The soju here is super cheap at $9/bottle. We got the original and grapefruit and it kept us going all night. Love this place!! Will definitely be back when we're in Vegas again. Thank you!"}
{"text":"If you come here for karaoke, you better keep an eye on your tab! Thank god I left early before my party got super hammered. I might of had 2 shots of soju and a beer which kept me on the safe side. Your bills could rack up!  Ordered a Stella for 5 bucks which wasn't bad.  Fries were totally not worth it for 8.95 I believe. It was basically frozen fries topped with some sauce etc, I just felt that for the price these needed more substance it was all very superficial.  Service was great, all the guys that worked there were very nice. And it helps that the place looks very nice. I had my eye on this place when they were on construction. The deals on karaoke rooms didn't seem that bad either, just remember keep an eye on that tab! I think next time I'll try the fried chicken!"}
{"text":"Good food Great service and when you plan a party to hold here they'll tell you about the least expensive time to have your party like happy hour. The person who helped us told us that the discounts for happy hour extend not only to just drinks and food but to the rental of the karaoke rooms too. I moat dev reckoned this place."}
{"text":"My favorite place to go after work or on the weekends. All the bartenders are super nice and make great drinks. I have so much fun every time I go.its open super late too!!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! This was an incredible experience. This was my first time at a Karaoke Bar and I'm officially addicted and can't wait to book my next reservation. J Karaoke Bar was perfect! The food was incredible, service was top notch, and everyone was so attentive. The rooms are perfect for groups. We had a group of 8 and enjoyed every minute. The sound was perfect!   We will 100% be back. We loved the happy hour and stayed for about 4-5 hours. #LOVEDIT"}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic place to be. Service and all is amazing I loved every second of it! 10/10 recommend"}
{"text":"If I could give this place 0 stars I would! I experienced the worst costumer service in my life here! Tikis kitchen is closed so we went to J's for food I ordered one beer and 20 piece buffalo wings, when i started eating the wings they were extremely hot my mouth was burning and nose started to run so I tried to get the rest of the table to eat them but they were way too hot even for them! So I called over waiter and just asked if I can switch out the set of 10 wings we didn't touch into something less hot, the manager comes over and tells us no because they are regular buffalo wings ha No they weren't I love buffalo just had some at peppermill the night before and they didn't burn my mouth and make nose runny! We weren't asking for refund just simply asking for something we can enjoy eating without burning up! So the conclusion was that he wouldn't do it I had to pay for a 20 piece wing I couldn't even eat I seriously only ate 1 wing and the 2 other people with me couldn't even finish 1 themselves! Your suppose to at least try to please your costumers!"}
{"text":"Just karaoke is the premiere location for dancing and singing with a group of friends. We came here with high expectations and we're not let diwn. Chase was catering and professional as he showed us a great time. 10/10 would come again."}
{"text":"Been here a few times.  The first time was on a double date. The food & drink was served fast & finding songs was easy. The remotes are HUGE lol!  I loved how they had tambourines and multiple mics. It was a fun double date.  The other times I drank with friends at the bar. They have great bartenders-- great spot to go in Vegas."}
{"text":"We came here tonight to celebrate our friends birthday. I really like they have individual rooms for private party's. The sound is great and the drinks are on point. Most definitely coming back."}
{"text":"This is the best place to just hang out and enjoy some drinks and laughs with your friends!"}
{"text":"This place is legitly cool. First off, the staff are attractive... when you include that with private karaoke how can you go wrong?  Rooms are in a good price range. And the atmosphere is comfortable in an aesthetically pleasing yet simple way. You will enjoy it if you are  genetically a cool being or most likely in your mid 20s... although that does not mean that older crowds should stay away. Please spend your money here... Oh yea, there's a fucking library.... Also, there should be more bacon on the specialty fries, just saying."}
{"text":"Great place to sing your hearts out and drink! Service was great!! I recommend their lychee or yogurt soju!"}
{"text":"So much fun with a group. The technology is really cool, the place is clean and the drinks are well priced. My friends and I had a great time and we can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"The service is great. The food is great. Overall a great place to pregame and hang out before going out !! Dabin is the best!"}
{"text":"I love Yosub. He played all my favorite music. Good bartender. Good service. Makes me feel like family my favorite."}
{"text":"This is a new neighborhood place.  Well designed, each room has its individual character.  Service is fantastic.  Everyone gets red-carpet treatment.  The best thing about this place is the sound system.  All their equipments are new, I feel I'm living in 2020.  The second best thing is the fried chicken.  It was so tender, juicy and well seasoned."}
{"text":"Place is pretty cool! The drinks are medium oh priced and it's in china town so the location is pretty convenient. The karaoke rooms are a great way to make a fool of yourself!"}
{"text":"The drinks are really good here and the ambiance is very hipster like. The decor is eye catching and gives the place a relaxed feel. The bartenders are great, the food is pretty good, and the karaoke rooms are spacious and funky. They have a decent selection of songs and decent prices for the ambiance. It's pricier then other karaoke places in the neighborhood, but you're paying for the  ambiance. It's worth it for a special event with your friends or family."}
{"text":"This karaoke place is the bomb! Clean! food is amazing and rooms are huge! We celebrated my sis in law birthday here and we just had a blast! The music selection is great and they had quite a variety! I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Best karaoke spot in las vegas!!!! Fun friendly atmosphere. Hip and chill vibes."}
{"text":"J Karaoke is the place to have your afta party in Vegas if you're looking for a chill good time with your friends. They are open until 5am and they have songs in English, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, Chinese, Indonesian, Thailand and even some Russian songs. They had a great selection of English songs with the top hits throughout the years as well as the newest songs playing on the radio today. As expected their Vietnamese selection wasn't nearly as glorious but it was not bad at all. What amazed us the most was how there was NO WAIT?!?! compared to this really busy place my friends usually go to. It is only $20/hour and half off during their happy hours between 6-9pm.   Each room has two TV screens so you can either sing while sitting down or you can get up and really perform for your friends. They even have these tambourines for anyone who wants to really feeling the music. They also had pillows giving these rooms a very comfy homey vibe. They also have wifi available for guests. The password is in the front.   The remote controller was a bit complex since it is made to adapt to multiple languages, but there is English markings on the essential buttons. For instance you can search by \"title,\" \"artist,\" \"language,\" and \"nation.\" Once you found your song, you can either press \"start\" or you can press \"reserve\" to put it in queue. If you didn't know the song as well as you thought, there is also a \"skip\" button.   DRINKs: - Beer (Corona, Modelo, Heineken, Newcastle, Cass, Asahi, Tsing Tao) $4/bottle - Bucket Special $18/6 bottles - Coors light $5/16oz, $15/60oz - Stella Artois & Blue Moon $6/16oz, $18/60oz - Cocktail Soju $6 - Martini $10  - Other cocktails $10   Between the six of us, we each paid about $20 and it more than covered tax and tip for over three hours of fun. I really like how their machines have a scoring system and we always scored above 80s and even 100 twice!! Either the machine is extra nice or they just want to keep us in high spirits :) Regardless is our new go-to Karaoke spot in Vegas!! Woo Hoo!!"}
{"text":"I am here on a friend's bday and I had so much fun. We got room E and the rooms are very urban and clean. The room fits 13 people comfortably and it's great for parties for sure. Their drinks are fairly priced/cheap.lol The staff is friendly and helpful, we will definitely be back! :D"}
{"text":"Nice spot has a great menu and is super clean. Great music to set the mood for a great time. Best private rooms in Vegas."}
{"text":"We went this past weekend to celebrate a friends birthday. When I originally asked for the rate per hour, I was told it was $10/hr for the small room. I made a reservation online and did not hear anything from the bar until 30 mins before my reserved time on the date of event. I would recommend they implement a better follow up system. My party ended up arriving about 20 mins late. The room was held for us and not given to anyone else as I confirmed that we were on our way. The room size given was decent and fit 8-10 people but it smelled dirty. Some of my guest referred to a \"feet\" smell. During the night we had to use the restroom and YUCK someone had made a mess. Good news was the staff cleaned it as soon as we brought it to their attention, but the bad news is that it wasn't cleaned thoroughly. Finally, when I went to pay for the room at the end of the night I was told that the rate after 9pm was $20/hr. I informed the gentleman that this was not disclosed to me. Also they automatically charge a gratuity fee so be careful. The reason for my rating is lack of follow up, dirty bathrooms, smelly room and not being disclosed the correct rate when I initially asked for rates. The positive things were good music selection and quick response when we buzzed for someone to help us."}
{"text":"We came here after a friend's wedding to keep the celebration going. This was my very first time ever going to a karaoke place, and was a great time. Nice to have your own private room to enjoy some karaoke shenanigans, and enjoy time with your friends :-)"}
{"text":"This place is pretty chill place. It's a karaoke bar where they have private rooms if you wanted to have a more private setting.   The bartenders are pretty nice and attentive. They pay attention to you right when you walk into the door. The specialty cocktails were all pretty delicious. One of my favs is the Blue Hawaiian.   They also have this thing where if you review them on Yelp they give you a free shot! It doesn't even have to be a 5 star rating. When I first heard it I thought they were trying to buy off reviews but I asked them and they made it very clear that they'll still provide a free shot even if it was a 1 star review. So that's pretty cool!  One wall is a book shelve full of books! I thought that was pretty darn neat! I mean I wouldn't pull a book out and read it but I thought that was pretty neat.   Def a perfect place for a nice chill night with friends."}
{"text":"Always come here for karaoke! They have a good selection of English songs new and old. And even hanging out at the bar up front is fun."}
{"text":"Sing your heart out until 5am!? Then eyyeeeee-iii-eyyeee will always love youuuuu! hoooohhhooo- i - eye - will always....  Okay so this place has such a cool ambiance. When you first walk in you will see tables because you can actually order food, drinks, and chill out while you wait for a room to open up (in our case, we didn't even have to wait more than 10-minutes).  We got their \"small\" room which had plenty of room for the 4 of us. They had 2 screens one in the front and one on the back wall. This is so you can sing your heart out while standing up and facing your friends.  The rooms are clean and I'm glad they have the microphone covers. Sanitary points for sure!  The song selection wasn't as much as I would have liked. They have some recent songs but not too many. They do have some international songs and a lot of Korean songs (if only I could sing to them). They have 2-pages of Tagalog songs.   Sound quality was good... the music wasn't an annoying midi as compared to other karaoke places I've been to. I was going to take 1-star off for a lack of newer song selections but everything else made up for it. I do hope you guys add newer songs by the time I come back!  The drinks... delicious but not as strong as I would prefer.  We got to try their honey bread and it was DELICIOUS!  Their bathrooms are also clean. No complaints here.  Service was great! They were very friendly and attentive to our needs.  The bigger rooms can get a bit pricey per hour but isn't too bad if split between a ton of people.  Plenty of parking...  I did enjoy my time here overall and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. Walked in randomly with some friends. Friendly staff members not to mention cool decor. Their Garlic chicken wings and sweet and spicy wings are on point as well as their Garlic fries with an egg on top and seaweed ads the Asian zing. Ask for Dabin. We didn't even sing. It's a karaoke bar..."}
{"text":"Great location, easy to book and Excellent service, friendly and lots of fun. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I planned a birthday party for my best friend on 5/8/2017, and let me start by saying Sean and Jim were fantastic! The room was half off for the first few hours and the drink specials are some of the best in town. Like most karaoke venues, there was a good selection of songs and the sound quality was definitely up to par. Again, nothing beats the service. 10/10, would definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"I called them to ask if there was a wait list. They told me that there'll be a 45 minutes wait and can put me on the wait list. They told me I am 3rd on the list and they'll call me when the room is open. My friends and I went there after 45 minutes and notify them we're here. After 30 more minutes, they told me I'm first on the list. We waited for another 20 minutes. I went up to them and ask how much longer is the wait. The other employee told me to put my name on the list. I told them I've been on the list for more than an hour and a half. When I looked at the list, MY NAME WAS CROSSED OUT!!!! That's outrageous!!! There was no call! No notification! Horrible customer service. Guess I'm never coming here again."}
{"text":"Awesome! Seriously awesome! Had a great time. Such fantastic service. Great selection of songs. Truly the best karaoke bar I've been to."}
{"text":"Awesome. This place is so rad. I recommend going for sure. They have lots of options and each room has its own ambience."}
{"text":"Came as a group as a way to relax after work. The rooms were clean and looked very trendy. We had a toddler with us and he was treated like a king. The popcorn they brought in was delicious and the service was perfect. Everyone there were nice and thoughtful. Thoroughly enjoyed our four hours there!"}
{"text":"Great song selection and modern decor. Staff was very friendly and accommodating. Drink and food selection was ample."}
{"text":"Awesome vibe. Love the manager named Antonio! I'm coming all the way from up north (Turlock) and this guy knows how to treat a customer! Thank you very much for your awesome service!!"}
{"text":"J Karaoke is awesome. The rooms are very spacious and the audio is awesome. We also really liked the sour apple sour soju. This place rocks!!!!"}
{"text":"Every time we are in town we stop here for good eats and karaoke! The bottle prices are reasonable compared to the the main drag, so you get more for your money here.   Having a private room is nice since you can sing you heart out without judgement   Only thing I think needs work would be the song selection, there isn't any country or good oldies that could be added for a more universal audience.   Overall, we love coming here!"}
{"text":"My new favorite karaoke place!!friendly staff. A lot of new songs. I love the fries also!!!"}
{"text":"Chase was very attentive and was there when we needed him. The bar is very clean and the bartenders are the friendliest:)"}
{"text":"Let me just say that music is my life and I've been singing since the day I could talk. So, when it comes to karaoke, I'm always down for it. No need for a drink or two. But for those that do, welcome to J Karaoke Bar!  The first time I came here, I had called in advanced to see if they even had any rooms available. A lot of times karaoke rental rooms fill up quickly and calling ahead of time will save you a drive if your group just can't wait. This was the case for my first visit.  That night I had called my usual go-to spot, Q Karaoke, to inquire about availability. But as always, they had no vacant rooms. And that happens all the time at that joint. That's when this place came to mind. As much as I frequent the Chinatown area/plaza, I have never been to J Karaoke until now. I usually go to Q Karaoke or A18 which are all along Spring Mountain Rd to save a lil drive, but now that won't be the case every time I get the need to bust out a vocal!  From the outside, the place looks very small. You wouldn't think there would be a long, stretched out hallway that runs all the way down from the entrance. As you enter, there are a few tables and chairs in front of the bar, with additional seating on the left side. Perfect for drinks and conversations with your group if karaoke is not the only thing on your list.  Just like most karaoke bars where you can rent out different sized rooms, each one is equipped with a call/service button if you need to order anything from their menu, if you have any problems with the sound system, or for just customer service in general. The first time I was here, the room my group was in had a slightly bad smell. Don't know what it was, but I'm hoping they at least tried to clean the room before letting us in.  The sound systems they use are really on point. It makes you want to rock your heart out and sing like nobody can hear you. The walls aren't as soundproof as other ones that I've been to, as we could hear what's going on in the rooms next to us, but no biggie. It's fun to hear your fellow peeps having a blast too. :]  Customer service has always been great. No problems there. All in all, I will be returning for good times. Love how they're open super late for Vegas standards. Perfect for those who can party all night long and want to do something that doesn't require going to The Strip :]"}
{"text":"SPACIOUS!!  Newest kareoke bar in China town I would have to say. The decor is kool & hip w/ chalk board walls w/ chalk writings. The entrance area has a bar & lounge  area w/ one wall full of books. Then in the back there are a bunch of rooms.   The staff is SUPER nice & attentive. Greet you right away & get a room set up for you as fast as possible.   The rooms are clean & some rooms are set up a little differently than most places which is FUN. the SOUND SYSTEM is AWESOME!!! makes any Singer sound good ahaaaahaha   The music lists are always up to date w/ all the new hip songs which is the BEST!   They also serve food as well which is ALWAYS a plus.   JERKY COMBO $17.95 - we usually order this when we drink soju... it's dried squid...  dried fish... peanuts... & jerky & they come out warm which is always the best served w/ Mayo & sirachi sauce.  GLASS OF PINOT NOIR $6 - Robert mondavi... pretty cheap I would have to say ahaaha & it tastes good.  PEACH DELIGHT COCKTAIL $6 - SUPER SWEET hahaha & I typically like sweet drinks... but when you make a SWEET SOJU cocktail... they could be deadly..  BOTTLE OF SOJU $9   SMALL ROOM $20 - this room could fit up to 8 people it's pretty spacious still I would say you could fit up to 10 comfy. They do charge every minute here though... most places round it to 30min cuz usually you are prepping & just gathering your stuff at the end... but o well. Ahaaha we still have fun nice place to sober up for everyone while having fun."}
{"text":"This is a great place to hang out and do karaoke in fun, but private environment. They have decent food and drinks, which are delivered to you in your private karaoke room. You can get help immediately, by pressing the call button on the wall. The place is clean, and service is very good. The song selection is average, but regardless, you can have a great time if you are with the right crowd.   This place is located in Chinatown, and parking can be a HUGE hassle. If possible, catch an Uber/Lyft, cab, or other ride."}
{"text":"Had so much fun and the best idea for shy singers!! Had the best date night here!!!! Go be be coming back asap"}
{"text":"I didn't come here to karaoke, but the rooms look big & comfy. I like how when u walk in, it looks like a hip library to ur right. We sat at the bar to drink & the grape soju was so good, I didn't need a chaser! the bartender is also super friendly! heard a lot of good things about this place. will definitely come when I wanna sing my heart out (:"}
{"text":"Awesome service, great place to hangout have some drinks and sing some karaoke service from Sean is top notch!  The grapefruit Korean Wine is the best also ask for the Number 4 from Sean!!"}
{"text":"Great venue, rooms are good quality, hosts are great (especially Damon), drink selection is nice as well.  Would visit again. 10/10 (but need more Phil Collins songs)"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I've never karaoked before and this was a great first experience! The selection is perfect for everyone! The service is great. The second you press the call button someone is at your door to help you! I will definitely come back! What a fun time!!"}
{"text":"Happy hour from 6-9 pm is so cheap! Has a fairly good selection of songs. Good location with parking although the strip mall can get crowded. Lees sandwiches, a Poke place (forgot the name) and Kung fu are great restaurants nearby in the same plaza for food"}
{"text":"If you haven't been here you must goooo!  The staff is always on point and the food is great. Their Karaoke selection is phenomenal. They have PLENTY of private karaoke rooms. Oh did I mention their drink selection is amazing??  We visit this fine establishment about 2-3 times a month. I have never ever had an issue with this place.  If I wasn't short on time I could go on and on.   If you ever need anything ask for GM Anthony and tell him Fahad sent you!!!!"}
{"text":"Cheap drunk food that's perfect to keep the night going.  $9 soju and a full bar.  Open extremely late and a perfect post clubbing destination.  We came to try some food and drink as we were craving Korean wings and chicken.  Food was pretty good drunk food but not quality by any means.  Nice spiciness that wasn't too overpowering. The garlic wings were dry but true to their name.  But for about $10-12, it's very tasty.  J karaoke is known as the best karaoke in town so I'll rent a room and experience the true story of J one of these days."}
{"text":"I just visited this place Friday for a work teambuilding and it was amazing.   There are a bunch of rooms you can rent that will accommodate different sized parties. The rooms themselves are kept well ventilated and cooled so you aren't feeling like a stuffed sardine.  Inside the rooms are benches, chairs and tables so you can sit and eat while watching people karaoke which is played on two screens. There are cute little laser lights in the room to provide light other than the tv cause you can keep the room lights off if you'd like.  They have a bar and kitchen in there and anything you order they will cater to your room. Their food was amazing! I had the coconut shrimp and I'm craving more!  We ordered onion rings, chicken wings, chicken bites and mozzarella sticks and everything was pretty tasty. It was soooo much fun!!"}
{"text":"Such a great deal and so much fun. They have newer songs and really nice technology. I especially love the lights. My group had a blast and will be back."}
{"text":"This place is baller! I called during dinner to see if it would be full for later in the night. The guy who picked up was helpful and honest in assessing the situation, so even though I couldn't make a reservation due to our party size, I was confident to go there anyway. Each employee was super courteous and fun and collegial to all. Facilities were clean, nicely decorated, and had a good sound system. Fair alcohol prices. The only thing was that a MAJORITY of the song selections were Korean. In a binder full of songs, there was maybe ten pages on English songs, and a lot of classic karaoke choices was not available. Also I wish they had a binder organized by artist, cause I think that would make a much easier to browse.   I'd still recommend for any out of towners who want to extend the party longer."}
{"text":"Awesome place, great rooms, great song selection! They were super accommodating to our needs as a large party and were open late enough for us to have an awesome time after dinner. Highly recommend this place for a great time."}
{"text":"Best Karaoke spot in Vegas  great food and service!! Fun urban design, great prices!!"}
{"text":"One of my fav karaoke spots for karaoke! Rooms are clean and their staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Nice, clean Karaoke joint in Chinatown. Good sound system. Excellent drink selection beyond just beers. Best of all? Friendly staff. Always accommodating."}
{"text":"5 shots and 2 casinos later, we found ourselves wandering inside this restaurant. Little did we know, we walked into to an experience that will settle our expectations for our future Vegas visits. Not only was their food on point but the atmosphere grew on us; the drinks flowed endlessly, the music was on point, and the staff was welcoming. Highly recommend this joint."}
{"text":"Probably the best karaoke place ever in Vegas! Great music, a pole and updated karaoke book?! What more can you ask for? The staff is great and interacts with the guests often! The food is good.  The place is also clean and obviously taken care of! I definitely recommend this place to a lot of my friends. Came here with a group of friends and they absolutely love the atmosphere. The cocktail soju are tasty and fun to drink. You definitely gotta try the blue raspberry and the lychee. Food, give the soy ginger chicken wings a shot. Wouldn't really recommend the bulgogi nachos if you're not into salty food. Wayyyy too salty!  Also, have Joseph take care of your group. Such a chill guy. Very informative of their menu and karaoke."}
{"text":"I absolutely love karaoke, and although Q karaoke has been my go- to for over a decade now, it's far too busy now. I went to J karaoke instead, and now I think I have a new favorite place. The prices are great, they have a friendly staff, rooms are nice and clean, sound system is great, and they have 50% off rooms from 6pm to 9pm. If you're looking for karaoke in the early evening, this is the place to go :D"}
{"text":"Nothing but great things to say about this establishment. Great service and great song selection. Two thumbs up & two big toes up! * Antonio is the man!"}
{"text":"Always a good time here. Quick service and strong drinks. Don't forget the great music selection. Can never go wrong. Came here on a Thursday and good atmosphere."}
{"text":"First time and already loving it, great prices on karaoke rooms and beer, party all night long!!! Amazing karaoke spot and will definitely come back soon."}
{"text":"A few friends and I have been here a few times. The first time we rented a room, ordered food, and had some drinks. Although, the food took a long time, we had a great time and looked forward to coming back. We decided to go on a week night a few days ago. We ordered one plate of food, which took 45 minutes and we had to ask if we were going to get it after the 45 minutes. We had 3 carafes of soju. We were charged for 6?? The soju was completely watered down. When we asked why we had been charged for 6 carafes, they told us we had 4 when we clearly had 3?? Currently, I would be sure to check your check before paying and when ordering food, follow-up. I hope their level of service we experienced a few months back, returns."}
{"text":"Told a Table was available in 20, 3 hours hours later we were good to go to a sister property"}
{"text":"One of my favorite place to chill. Everybody is really friendly. Like the music and very good food too."}
{"text":"This place has such a fun, friendly, and inviting atmosphere! My friends and I decided that we wanted to get away from the Strip and when we saw this karaoke bar on Yelp we knew we had to come here.   Upon arrival they set up the room super fast and at a reasonable price. $30/hour for a medium room is not bad! The list of songs available is updated every month so they have a wide selection in all different languages. They also have snacks, alcohol, and drinks available to order at a reasonable price. The staff are very helpful and kind. When you're in room there is a button you can press to call for service as well. There were two monitors in the room and the navigation of how to play songs was fairly simple. The seats were comfortable and they also provide you with tambourines too, which I thought was a cute touch.     My friends and I stayed for about 2 and 1/2 hours and we had a blast! It was definitely a very memorable experience and I would highly recommend coming here if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"This place is the bomb! we stopped by here last night for the first time. I was really surprised how great the food was because I thought it was probably not going to be too good at a karaoke place. Boy, was I wrong.  Upon entering, you get a really nice feeling, there was a fireplace, a piano and tables and bookshelves with books. The bar has a nice selection of wine and spirits.  The staff took us to room J. There are 10 rooms (each room are themed differently) you can book a room in advance esp on the weekend. The rooms are very clean with comfy booths and tables and the karaoke machines. The call button is mounted on the wall if you need the staff just press the button.  Happy hour at 6pm were half off! Rooms are priced from $20/hr (for up to 8 people) and $60/hr for the VIP room for party of 30 people.   We ordered Butter calamari & langustine, the calamari had no breading and it was one of the best calamari. The Korean Style short Rib Salad was amazing. Chicken thigh skewers were flavorful. The  chicken wings were crispy and sweet. For drinks we had half carafe Lychee martini.  The staff who helped us is super friendly and helpful and very quick with deliveries of food and drinks. As we walked in the room, he said 'let me start out with 2 bottles of water.' Anyone would think that was free but it wasn't. Not a big deal but just a suggestion for them to let us know it isn't free.   this is a great venue, where else in Vegas can you get a room for yourself! we will definitely return."}
{"text":"This is awesome place!! J karaoke is the place to go! Better than q! The place looks so cozy, classy and cleaner. Plus they have a full bar unlike the other one. The room is perfect temperature. Also the service is soooo much better, their staff is on point and very welcoming especially Antonio. The only thing I don't like is the food! They are horrible!! Taste like shit even the noodles is flat out instant ramen noodle! They add some meat and veggies but an Asian guy like me knows my ramen noodle legit. 1 out of 10 in the food department."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was great. Everyone had a great time and Jim was especially accommodating!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is amazing. Without feeling too clubby, it's comfortable with the library feel, and great music. The bartenders are amazing and friendly and attentive. Definitely have to try the food. It is so amazing. From the fries to the pasta!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing came here was greeted by Antonio! Very professional very fun atmosphere not like your usual hole in the wall karaoke place! Super clean and amazing drinking thumbs up for a great time!! Just be ready to sing cause that's what it's all about!!!"}
{"text":"Good Service and good karaoke room . The servers are friendly and take care us really good . Food are delicious and goid price . I like this resturant and I will come back to here again."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  Having a birthday party with friends and it's a lot of fun. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"The vibe and atmosphere is super chill and laid back, love the electronic music and classic book wall. Great to relax from a hard days work! Bartenders are friendly and down to earth! I just found my spot!"}
{"text":"This place is incredibly fun! Great environment and wonderful staff. Shout out to Anthony at J Karaoke! :)"}
{"text":"We had so much fun! This place has karaoke rooms and you can rent the room for however long you are there. Of course we had several drinks and we tried their chicken wings and fries. Both our drinks and food were good. The customer service was great too. You can choose between Asian and American music. There were some songs I wanted to sing that they didn't have, but we had so much fun that it didn't really matter. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty decent!!! If youre ever in vegas and dont want to feel so tourist-y with all the hustle and bustle in the strip, then do karaoke! I honestly think this place is not bad for people who cant stand the other kind of partying! They have pretty reasonable prices, the location is not far from the strip, and it's a pretty decent area! They charge by the hour, but if you dont use a full hour they charge every 15 mins, and 30 mins. The only thing wrong, and everyone in the group noticed was that the music had a louder bass than usual, we couldnt hear our voices with the loud beat. But other than that food was good, the people were nice and accommodating."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The service is great, the food is great, and the karaoke system is exceptional! I definitely recommend. The only thing I can complain about is we had to wait, but it's understandable because its a Saturday."}
{"text":"Such a fun place to come for drinks and entertainment!! Girls night done right. And Chase is a great bartender!!"}
{"text":"I've had my birthday here! VIP room 2 years ago. Back again tonight for my company's after holiday party and the service is still the same- amazing and accommodating! Happy to be back and served by Jim! He is awesome! Thank you for putting up w my team!"}
{"text":"First time to this karaoke bar and this place blew my mind. Great customer service and fantastic environment. No your shit because this is your place."}
{"text":"Great place to have a private room to sing and party with friends. Good drinks, foods available, and great service! Come early and get happy hour prices for room and drinks."}
{"text":"My boy Antonio was a great bartender! He's chill and talkative so you wont feel left out! Im all the way from SoCal and this is the shit!!!"}
{"text":"Woohoo! We went here for 2am karaoke with a group of 10. Super fun.   Loved the private rooms.   We got snacks, they were OK. Same with the drinks. Not totally divey, but totally not fancy, either.   Great selection of songs & the bartender helped us with the song picking machine.   Smells a little like cleaner? My germaphobe friend appreciated the little disposable paper mike covers LOL  Only $20/hr for rooms that hold up to 12 on weekend nights. Cheap!"}
{"text":"If you're visiting Vegas and looking for something to do off the strip come to J karaoke! The manager Antonio is so friendly and makes you feel like a local. Will definitely come back when I visit Vegas."}
{"text":"Love this karaoke bar! You have to get the Cajun fries! Great happy hour $3 bottles of beer!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!!very fun!!!this is my first time and my and we are having a blast!!! Great food and drinks as well. Happy hour is on! So 1/2 off the room!! So perfect!!! Love it!"}
{"text":"Fun new bar that just opened! Love the atmosphere and the vibe! Everyone should check it out ;)"}
{"text":"I love this place it was amazing  The music was great the sound system was fantastic  The food and drinks were delicious!  Great costumer service too The controls were easy to use and the rooms are incredible, very unique and cute  (:"}
{"text":"Our group had a great time in our private karaoke room. The room was clean and cozy. The host was attentive, answered all of our questions and provided all of our needs. There was a large selection of songs to choose from and the remote was easy to use. There was also a bar and seating when you enter if you just want to hang out and socialize. We're already making plans to go back!"}
{"text":"This place is great. Really friendly staff, especially Damon! They have a full bar, which is hard to find for a karaoke place! The selection of songs is great and the rooms are really clean.  Would recommend, would come back for sure!"}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate a birthday and had a blast. Drinks were delicious! Soju isn't watered down. So good! Sound is great and mics actually work."}
{"text":"The best !!!! Incredible service!! Great staff! Strong drinks! Will try food next visit! We had a blast!!! Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Spent our New Year's Eve here, we always come here for celebrations and it's always a hit. Service is fast and friendly. Rooms are clean and well air-conditioned unlike other karaoke spots I've been to in the past. The selection for music is vast but they could use a update on new songs at least in the books: I found a lot of unlisted songs in their artist section by using the remote. But still love the place."}
{"text":"Been here an hour and WOW! This place is awesome! Great place for large parties. Very clean and modernized looking as well. The song selection/sound system is off the chain also!"}
{"text":"OMG?I love this place! I like the drinks here and the stuff are super friendly. It's a good place to go to karaoke and have a drink with your friends! Go there on weekends and have a cocktail!!! Great bar!"}
{"text":"Honestly this place has a sick concept. Bring a group of friends and let the drinks flow while having a room to yourself to belt out your favorite songs. Couldn't have asked for a better time! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I've never karaoked before and this was a great first experience! The selection is perfect for everyone! The service is great. The second you press the call button someone is at your door to help you! I will definitely come back! What a fun time!!"}
{"text":"As someone who rarely Karaokes, perhaps all the missteps here were just par for the course given their glowing reviews, but we had a bad sound system, slow service, a longer-than-quoted wait, and pretty bad snacks. Folks mentioned a free shot but it's now a free cup of soda."}
{"text":"Great service, very fun and inviting atmosphere. People here are always friendly and welcome. Honestly one of my favourite bars here in. Las Vegas. Good food, great selection of drinks, and great place to be."}
{"text":"Great time! Everyone is so friendly and fun to be around. I definitely recommend coming here for a great time off of the strip . You have your own space to sing as many songs as you would like to. Def stop by!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing with great food and drinks! This place is open late and the karaoke rooms are awesome! they have 3 different sizes and opted fir a medium even though there was 8 of us. Super fun and they have tons of songs to choose from. I'm a local and will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Located in the Chinatown plaza between Wynn and Valley View, so you know the parking can be challenging, especially being a few doors down from Hot N' Juicy. Once you enter, you will see bar and a wall with hundreds of books. I'm not sure if the lights are ever bright enough to comfortably read, but it was a nice touch. We had made reservations in advance, but it appeared to not be necessary when we arrived (probably because it was a Tuesday night). There is a hallway marked by letters for each room. We occupied room E and it was more than enough space for our party of 10.   The staff here is so accommodating and the attention to detail is second to none. When you're ready to order food, drinks or have technical questions, just press the red button by the door. They literally run to your room within 10 seconds. There is also happy hour on the rooms from 6pm to 9pm! Since we arrived at 8pm, our first hour was $17.50 and then back to the full price of $35 for the second hour. They also asked if we were worked in the industry without us having to mention it upfront. The additional 10% off definitely helped. Just make sure if you have your employee ID or business ready at hand.  The room comes with two mics and two TVs on either side of the room so you can either be shy, or face your fears and sing your heart out in front of your friends. They also provided two tambourines for additional entertainment. The selection of music was pretty extensive. Many different languages that I won't even try to get into. The most impressive was how up to date the English section was. Even when we were settling the bill at the bar, they asked if we wanted a bunch of water bottles to go! Yes, please and thank you!  Overall I would definitely come back and take advantage of the whole happy hour next time so we can use more money towards food and alcohol instead. :)"}
{"text":"Always a great service, friendly bartenders and a clean environment! Their drinks are priced at a reasonable range and the rooms as well. korean song are always updated to the most current versions of Karaoke and so are the American musics. Their fries are really good as well and for late night, their fruit combination is really sweet and fresh to have with couple drinks."}
{"text":"My favorite local bar. The bartenders are amazing, great drinks, fair price, good conversation. Rates for the karaoke bar and very reasonable compared to other karaoke bars. Plus they have a great menu. It's a Korean fusion place yummy bar food different from burgers and fries. The Korean spicy chicken wings are my favorite. Come see Joseph and Sean they're my favorite people ever."}
{"text":"After a round of drinks, someone in our group recommended Karaoke and everyone was game. J Karaoke is one of the highest rated spots in LV, so I called ahead to see if they could accommodate, last minute, a group of 10 people. They said, yes, and we headed that way.  Located in Chinatown, in a strip mall, I was the second to arrive. They have a bar up front and one member of our group had a drink already when I arrived. As we started spilling in, they showed me a couple of rooms and we grabbed the larger one. Good thing, because our group grew to 12 people.   Private rooms, with 2 large tvs, 2 mics, disco ball and tambourine (this was the BEST prop for Karaoke). Song selection is offered in 3 languages. Staff kept the drinks flowing (full bar) and had snacks (edamame, fries, wings, etc).  A few members of the group acted like they weren't going to sing, but once inside the room and a couple of drinks, EVERYONE was singing and dancing. Our group lost track of time, because we were having so much fun.   Highly recommend and would definitely return!"}
{"text":"always a good time here. Great place to grab a drink and hang out. Bartender Dabin served us at the bar and she was really fun."}
{"text":"Antonio is an awesome server with great energy! Got my entire group of 7 in fast and easy with a plethora of drink options!"}
{"text":"They are great ! A must do ! Great service & fun environment I'm coming back for sure ! My friends and I really enjoyed J karaoke bar ! They also have happy hour from 6-9pm with 3 dollar bottle beer & 4 dollar well drinks ! Go to J karaoke bar !"}
{"text":"This place is always so much fun. The staff is so attentive and the drinks are reasonably priced along with a full on food menu. Best karaoke bar in las vegas"}
{"text":"My friend and I came here for karaoke for our friends birthday. While we waited there was a nice seething area in the lobby by the bar where we were greeted. My friend and I ordered wine and were able to relax. When my friend and I were ready for our karaoke room we were escorted and they had a tambourine in the room with some shot glasses and of course the karaoke book.   We were offered the menu which had a huge selection of snacks. We ordered the fries and sweet potato fries here! Our server was on top of our service with drinks, orders, cups and more.   The room we had was very spacious. We were offered multiple joiners of juices and fruits and I love the offer for healthier options. They also kept up with keeping our rooms clean which we appreciated.   Overall this is one of the best places for karaoke and fun and drinks for privacy with friends. I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"This place was fun, and the karaoke aspect was a good value. They talked us into buying bottles of alcohol because it would come with some appetizers. After we bought a second bottle no more appetizers... not a big deal, but that was part of the reason we bought bottles."}
{"text":"so fun, i really enjoy singing especially kpop. I have two little asian boys at home and they are adopted so its great that i can connect with their culture through music. They dont go to the bar with me, but when im there, i facetime them so they can watch their momma sing to some lovely tunes. They like to fall asleep to me singing kpop, its lovely"}
{"text":"The service was wonderful.   The food was very tasty.   The karaoke, although not my really my thing, was fun.  They have small rooms were you and your friends can sing without worrying about the horrific sounds being created.  It was a good time and I would go back.   The Karaoke machine was easy to use."}
{"text":"Amazing! From the food to the service I am always impressed. Not only do they have great employees but you cannot beat the prices. If I could leave 10 stars I would."}
{"text":"Uhm.. I didn't know they auto grat you if you come with a party of 5 or more.. I go to karaoke all the time and J was one of our go to spots.. have always tipped 20% tip or more. We JUST realized today that they put gratuity on our ticket. I can't even imagine how many times I've been tipping them extra. For what kind of service? Sometimes we don't even order anything. So we've been tipping 38% the whole time for them to guide us to the room. I work in the restaurant industry to know well enough about customer service and that includes making sure that the food (if they order) is prepared to their liking, making sure that the customer is doing okay, if they need any refill on their drink, etc. They never came to check on us. Which is pretty normal at Karaoke bar, yes. Theres not much service necessary there. That's why putting automatic gratuity on a party of 5 is absolutely ridiculous.  And if they do, they need to let us know. At least highlight or circle the god damn receipt. I NEVER thought we could get auto gratted at a karaoke bar. For a FIVE top. Now that I know, it's not that big of a deal.. like I said, I always tip at least 20%.. but the thought of the fact that we've been tipping additional 20% ON TOP of the automatic  gratuity just makes me so upset. For service that's not fantastic to begin with."}
{"text":"Was looking for a karaoke bar in Vegas and was so excited to find a Korean style noraebang! The staff was really cool and ask my friends loved having their own private room to sing in.  They have a wide selection of Korean, Japanese, and American songs. They also had both Korean and American food and alcohol. Such a great discovery!"}
{"text":"Dabin and Sean are AWESOME!!! This is my favorite NRB spot!!! Thank you for a wonderful memorial weekend!!!!"}
{"text":"Omg! So much fun! Came with a group of people and was amazed by the great service and fun that we received here.   The room was decorated so cute. Two tv's in the room. A laser light machine. There was also a Beatles decal on the wall. I loved it right away. I liked that it was a dining table instead of a coffee table. It was easier to access the food.   We ordered food and soju. Everything came out fast and hot. The wings were surprisingly delicious. Big wings, crispy, and perfectly sauced. I will be back for the wings. We have a couple different types of fries and nachos at the table. All were delicious.  This place is so cute.  The decor is so cute. If you are looking for karaoke in Las Vegas check this place out. It's right off the freeway. It's in a parking lot with some of the best food in Vegas."}
{"text":"Want to have a good time with your friends in a private room try this place out. Rooms were roomy...feels kinda like your in the basement of a dingy nightclub with no air, after a while it got really hot in the room. The bar area was updated and had a good drink selection. I personally like a open forum karaoke bar because I love listening to the good and bad singers. I would go back if there was a large group of people!  -1 star because it was so hot in the room!"}
{"text":"Hidden little place! Walked in and was pleasantly surprised by what it looked like, beautiful display of books, awesome music and the bartender is super sweet. Awesome place to spend Saturday night with friends!"}
{"text":"I really like this karaoke place, really helpful staff and friendly atmosphere! The drink specials are fantastic and the sound quality is fantastic! Would definitely come back again : )"}
{"text":"Great concept karaoke bar..clean modern private rooms. Stylish and fun off the strip place with great prices and sushi selection. Will come back with a group of friends for special occasion to sing our asses off!!! Great place to have fun:)"}
{"text":"Awesome place!!! New and modern and cheap drinks staff is great too... New karaoke system"}
{"text":"Love J! This place is always great! Always the best service and super accommodating. Reserved for a large party and had some last minute changes but they helped fix things real quick when moving to a smaller room. The song list is huge and cool since I love Kpop and Jpop so my co-workers and I had a variety to choose from. If I could give more stars than 5 I would! Also, highly recommend the lychee soju! Extremely delicious and hella smooth!"}
{"text":"My friends and i had the best time here this weekend. J karaoke is by far the best karaoke bar I've ever been to. It's clean, easy to find and the staff is friendly and accommodating. Its hard to find places close to the strip where you can spend a couple hours hanging with your friends drinking without breaking the bank. They have a great selection of drinks and they even have Hennessy which is so hard to find sometimes. There are songs in English and korean. The selection is really up to date as well which is awesome because some places dont have top 40.   Restrooms are super clean too which is a plus.  I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"I love the service here at j karaoke. They really take care of their guest and remember the previous visit. Talk about service and customer service! Jim and Sean are amazing here! Def coming here again!"}
{"text":"Decent karaoke prices and such a fun atmosphere !! :) always have a good time here and the food is bomb too."}
{"text":"I came here with my friends from Seattle. We rented a room for a few hours and it was really affordable. I think it was around $20 an hour. They serve a ton of different drinks from beer to wine to even soju and Hennessy (my favorite). I didn't have a chance to try the food because I was having so much fun singing!  The staff is incredible. Attentive but not overbearing. Super nice and friendly. The decor is modern but comfortable. It's very modern compared to the businesses in this area.  Restroom and karaoke rooms are clean and easy to find. I would recommend this place if you're looking for a place to hang out and drink with friends or if you're wanting to have a fun date!"}
{"text":"Went here last night at around midnight. Clean rooms. Great service. Decent prices. I loved that all of the equipment works well. You get two wireless mics. Music book was limited but toucan search songs by title or artist. Way more selection than in the book. I found my go to spit for late night karaoke in Vegas."}
{"text":"Awesome place. Came here with several coworkers and had a blast. The people there were really friendly and the bucket of beer of Hite kept coming... the food was ok..... the fun factor was AMAZING! Planning to come back again."}
{"text":"One of my favorite karaoke places here in Las Vegas. Came here on a Monday night and got a room with a group of 7 friends and we got perfect. No wait time and were walked to our room immediately.  The room we got has 2 television screens. The booths are really comfortable. The table is pretty high quality and sturdy and two mica and some props to make the entertainment fun.  They have a huge selection of music to choose from and has a majority of the music we wanted to sing.  This place also offers alcohol and we grabbed a few bottles of solju. Majority of the solju we got was leche.  Overall experience we fun and the service was quick and excellent!"}
{"text":"I've been here 5+ times and every time has been awesome. We always get complimentary snacks and Antonio is always so hospitable. Used to go to Q Karaoke, but this place is our new favorite spot, especially because they romanize KPOP songs. The strawberry soju pitchers are the best :)  Always count on this Karaoke spot for an awesome time!"}
{"text":"Always have an great time here! Every employee is super accommodating. Their alcohol is reasonably priced as well. I've only been here twice but both experiences have been consistent. Highly recommended! PS Antonio is daaa best!"}
{"text":"Great place for bday parties! Food is great, happy hour is decent. Staff are friendly and professional. And they have lots of songs!"}
{"text":"I'm from California here to party and this place is open super late compared to anything back home, it's cheaper than Cali and has a bunch of room"}
{"text":"It has a pretty nice environment. I have gone here a few times, and I always have a great time with friends. Definitely a must!"}
{"text":"Amazing service as always! The drinks are delicious and a wide variety in songs for karaoke!"}
{"text":"This place is NICE...but why wouldn't it be? Everything here is brand new. The karaoke systems are brand new, the wireless mics are brand new...the speakers and sound systems are high quality and perfectly clear. Loved the way they decorated and painted the walls. Would definitely come back. They have happy hour discounted karaoke from 6-9pm on weekdays. I do wish that Doh's menu was available at J Karaoke too as the menu I saw at J wasn't too appealing to me but I love Doh. Drink menu was great though. Check it out people."}
{"text":"Great location! Friendly staff! Best happy hour deal from 6PM-9PM which includes cheap beers and half off on karaoke! If you're looking for a place to sing your heart out and drink affordable alcohol, come to J Karaoke!!!!"}
{"text":"Bartenders are very nice and accommodating. I started coming here a lot cuz of the friendly service. I brought my mom and sister to sing here once and the workers constantly checked on us to see if we need anything. I like the service overall that's why I am now a regular. I like the vibe and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Awesome funny place. Decent song choices, need more musicals though. Fun. Comfy. Good specials."}
{"text":"Soju killed me the night we went here.  Met up with some friends after a night out. Place was perfectly air conditioned, it was so damn hot that night.   We ordered some snacks, from what I can remember   I was drunk, everyone was nice; the room was big and spacious: we sang a lot of Backstreet Boys. It was a good night   Literally no one was a dick, even though we were hot messes."}
{"text":"I hosted a surprise birthday party here with a group of 20+. The food was delicious and the atmosphere was fun and perfect for our party. The music was not of very high quality. There was a large selection of songs, however it was missing a lot of my favorites (no Biggie or certain Destiny's Child songs). Overall, it was a good experience for my party. However, due to being overcharged for the room, I will NOT be returning. I checked my bill and noticed it was much higher than expected. I spoke with the cashier who \"fixed\" it. I received a new bill that was lower, and so I immediately paid and left. However, I should have taken more time to  recheck my bill. It was still over by $40."}
{"text":"Great place to hang with friends! Awesome song selections and great food! Antonio was an excellent host! Went with my workfam tonight for a farewell get together with around 11 people on a Monday night and reserved the largest room which had plenty of space. Happy Hour was from 6-9 pm with 50% off rooms, so it was a great price! The tambourine was addition of fun in the room. Lol. Will definitely be recommending and coming back for the shoju!"}
{"text":"My friend and I picked a number and then said we would Yelp all bars in the area and go to that number on the list.  J Karaoke won.   While it's a Karaoke place, we simply sat at the bar and enjoyed the shot and a beer special ($8) which is killer. Nice bartender. No one pressured us for a room.  We hung out for a couple hours. Will likely go back!"}
{"text":"Joseph is the bomb dot com!  This place is awesome!!! You definitely need to try their Midori Sour!"}
{"text":"Ok I have to say this place is awesome!! I just dropped a drink and they hooked it up (not on purpose tho) I have never been to a Karaoke bar and I have to say I will be back!!! I am having such a blast and Sean is the sweetest honestly he gets the party going!!"}
{"text":"Out of the numerous karaoke bars throughout Las Vegas, J Karoke is definitely my favorite. Not only is their aesthetics 10/10, their drinks and customer service are also 10/10. There is a wide variety of music and their prices for both drinks and rooms are a solid A+. Their french fries are even on point. Basically if you're not trying to waste your paycheck at the nightclub, come here. You'll have a 10/10 night."}
{"text":"They're fantastic. The soju is fantastic! Ive tried different soju cocktails from different places and theirs is probably the best. Get it! The mango soju is really yummy. The rooms are spacious. They have a lot of different songs -- from English to Korean to Chinese. Even if you don't karaoke, just hang out! Good music, good drinks,  what more do you want? Oh service is awesome too!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Couldn't expect any less of a classy Korean karaoke bar. Great selection of international music and American music. If you are not familiar with Korean, the device may be difficult to navigate. If you have troubles, the friendly staff will help out. The place is hip and very clean. Atmosphere is comfortable and fun. Definitely come during their happy hour 6-9PM to get a discounted room. Great place to hang with friends and share experiences. Definitely check this place out when you have the chance!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Costumer service is amazing and the staff is amazing. I love it here. The karaoke is amaz"}
{"text":"Great crew working here. They are always nice and remember my drink! The place is clean and very upbeat. My favorite karaoke place. I'm here almost every other weekend :)"}
{"text":"What a fun find after dinner at doh!   This place is great and affordable depending on the room size. Before 9pm we even for half off per hour!   The rooms were very clean and open with fun tambourines, menus for food and drink, sitting room, and microphone covers aka little microphone protection!   LOADS of songs to choose from! We're So coming back - my husband has found his home away from home lol"}
{"text":"Second time here! Cheap drinks, good times and awesome bartenders! Thanks chase and tony for great service!"}
{"text":"Excellent service! Just had to wait cause they were busy it was a Saturday. Ramen and special French fries was really Good!"}
{"text":"Best place to go and hangout. Food was great, service was wonderful, and happy hour was a great deal. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"I love this place!! There's never a wait like Q karaoke and their service is great! Always a fun time here!"}
{"text":"Late night valentine with my yummy bestie. J karaoke is such a great place. Friendly staff, good food, quality karaoke and open pretty late!! Our favorite karaoke place"}
{"text":"My crew was looking for a place to sing at since our usual spot (Q Karaoke) was remodeling.   Upon entering, you get a really nice feeling since the ambiance is set by seeing a selection of wine and spirits along the wall behind the cashier counter that doubles as a bar.  The place is larger than it looks from the storefront and I think it has 12 rooms (each appeared to be themed differently) so you are almost guaranteed availability on a week night. The rooms are clean and well-appointed with booths, chairs, tables and the awesome TJ media karaoke machines. The call button is mounted on the wall next to the light switches so be careful if you are messing with the lighting options.   Pricing seemed reasonable to me as import beers were only $4/bottle. Rooms were priced from $20/hr (for up to 8 people) and went up to $60/hr for the VIP room which can handle up to 30 people.   The staff (especially Damon) is super friendly and helpful and quick with deliveries of food and drinks. A+ on the service!  Also, the artwork on the bathroom doors is a nice touch.  If you need a place to unwind and let out some stress, this is a great venue!"}
{"text":"We had such a great time Antonino was the best! He really made our first experience here amazing! We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Really like the waiting area. THey have small medium and large rooms that are different prices. Its about 30 per hour for a medium room. HAppy hour is cheaper but ends at nine. their alcohol menu is pretty extensive. The bar is located in a strip mall at Chinatown."}
{"text":"Karaoke, Soju, and friends is the best combo. Been to this place a couple of times with many group of friends just to kick it. I love it here and we have a great time. The songs are always updated which is good. Many variety of selections of good music. To me this place is great for having them drunk nights with friends. I will always bring my friends from California to come to this place when they visit."}
{"text":"I've been to this bar a few times! Just a fun atmospheric place to be! Staff is great & drinks are great! I do love the popcorn they give out! Mmm"}
{"text":"My favorite karaoke place in Vegas! Great selection of songs, remote has labels, yummy drinks and food, and comfy rooms with super strong AC :)  I took my co-workers here when they were all in town and it didn't disappoint! Plus the staff is so nice and accommodating. Thanks for the good time!"}
{"text":"This is a Karoake joint that sells pretty good finger foods while you drink their cocktails or resonantly priced soju. It's always a good time when I come in here. The bartenders are very welcoming and definitely make you feel like you're here to have a good time right when you walk in the door. I've never had any problems with them but I've seen rude customers treat them disrespectfully and they were able to handle that professionally. Of course I laughed at that whole interaction right after because I couldn't believe they would argue about anything here. Ask them for what hey think you would enjoy, they would definitely start you off right."}
{"text":"This place is so chill and laid back I love! There so many room for karaoke and they have so many song!!   They also have a nice selection of food and drinks."}
{"text":"We came here to celebrate my birthday! We had an amazing time with awesome service! Will definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"This place is great. Private rooms to song all your guilty pleasures. And Damon was the best waiter! He helped us out all night. I will definitely be back every time I'm in vegas. This made the trip!"}
{"text":"These guys don't play games when it comes to karaoke especially on a Birthday Eve! 21+ after a certain time and the service is awesome on top of your karaoke sesh. Thanks J Karaoke! (:"}
{"text":"What a great place to enjoy a birthday! So much fun  and a comfortable for a group are NOT karaoke aficionados. Love it!!"}
{"text":"This place is okay.  The employee handling the register was amped and hilarious, but it's just another karaoke place. There is nothing innovating about it when comparing it to other karaoke spots that I've been to. Their rooms are clean and the prices are fair if you watch yourself to the minute but if you don't and you add the overpriced drinks, there's no deal in this.  Their song list was decent, some choppy instrumentals. We had a 90's theme going that came to a road block when we found out they were missing some classics like \"Bug-A-Boo\" by Destiny's Child and \"Back Here\" by BBMAK!!!!  Let's not misinterpret me. This is a fun zone and I enjoyed myself a lot but when a place has a 5 rating I expect it to be the best of the best and this was nothing above average as far as the facility goes. The overall experience? Well we all know drunk karaoke will always be fun."}
{"text":"Great time, great prices, so much fun!!!  Great happy hour specials!!  Food is amazing!! Karaoke prices for a private room are AMAZING!! AND 50% OFF during happy hour!"}
{"text":"My favorite karaoke spot in the city!   Great location and hours. Love the private rooms and happy hour before 9pm. Clean and fun atmosphere.  Parking can be a problem in this parking lot.   I'll be back next time I'm in town for work."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere but still a bit small on song selections. Their food is pretty decent."}
{"text":"This is legit the best spot in Vegas to get your night started/end it. They have the best selection in town for songs. You may think this is a biased opinion but legit best french fries in the game. No joke. Love this place and the staff. Some of the coolest guys ever. Thanks again."}
{"text":"Awesome servers! Celebrating my friend birthday and my birthday eve! Had an awesome night!"}
{"text":"Dranks are the best + Super Cool Crew + best prices for the rooms = Awesome Pre-Birthday"}
{"text":"This might be as good as it gets in terms of norebang in Vegas. They have nice interior, decent prices on the rooms/drinks, and most importantly, the better selection on songs as it is as recent as it can be compared to other places.   The sound quality isn't bad, though there was no option to really tweak the system to change the settings. Service was great, and if you can handle the wait on certain nights, this place is worth going to to get your singing on."}
{"text":"I love going to karaoke bars and J karaoke has to be my favorite! I love how they have songs in many languages and update their songbooks frequently. Their sound system sounds better than the other karaoke bars too. Every time I come here, I have to get their lychee soju. It's my favorite cocktail  Our host was really nice too and asked if we've been here before and if we knew how to operate the karaoke machine. Overall, I had a good time"}
{"text":"Came out here for my first time with my cousins. Was skeptical at first but the atmosphere was very welcoming. I was also curious about the variety of the music but they had everything I wanted to sing along to. I had such a great time. If you're looking for a good time with your friends in Vegas, definitely recommend checking this place out!!"}
{"text":"My friends and I came here on our last night in Vegas and we had more fun here than at all of the clubs we went to this weekend.  The bar itself is really nice, and very clean. We were so impressed by the decor. You can sing in the lounge or you can rent a room. We were a group of 7 and it was only $20 an hour which is a steal compared to the karaoke bars in Seattle. There's a huge song selection in English and Korean. A huge TV and extremely easy to use Karaoke system. There's a button to ring for help so you can order without having to leave the room which is awesome.  The drinks are cheap, especially when you compare it to drinks on the strip. You can get a bottle of Soju for ONLY $9! They have a special that goes on, on Sundays and Mondays where you can get a shot of Jameson AND any bottle of beer for $8. I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw that.  The service is also fantastic. Super nice staff that's helpful and ready to help you with anything. Also really random but the restroom plays really lit music, it's awesome! I would definitely return the next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Fun place for any Vegas visitor. Probably the best Karaoke in town. Thanks Sean - we always have amazing time eventhough your singing is not that great LOL."}
{"text":"Like the drinks and they make it pretty much toy flavor standards. Old fashion with makers is a must. New systems in the room and enough everything to get just the right amount is wild. :)"}
{"text":"Apparently I'm even more clueless than I thought as I never even knew that you could get private karaoke rooms!  Totally awesome!  The guys who work here are super nice and accommodating and the bottle service is actually reasonable!  We might even become regulars!!!"}
{"text":"J karaoke is the best karaoke place in town. Hands down this place has great costumer service! Their song selection is on point and their food is bomb! I will be back soon!!!"}
