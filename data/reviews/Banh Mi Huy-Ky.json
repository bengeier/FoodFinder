{"text":"Simple and inexpensive meals - items are under the $5 mark - to-go or you can eat at one of the four seats available around a simple table. This is clearly a take-out counter more than anything else.  The $2 Banh Mi sandwiches are decent. The bread would be greatly improved if they would toast it a bit, but the fillings are good. I'm fond of the shredded pork sandwich. They also offer chicken, bbq pork, pork floss, and chicken floss. The hot peppers range from not-that-hot to I-can-feel-where-it's-sitting-in-my-stomach. The pickled veg is nice too.  I tried the tapioca dessert ($1.25) and thought it quite good. Coconut milk, soft tapioca, and what is something like banana, but didn't have the texture of banana.  They also have fried spring rolls, fresh spring roll plates, bubble tea, and desserts (more coconut milk-based desserts). Overall, this spartan space is a great place for a quick and tasty bite in the area. Would certainly make (and have made) subsequent visits."}
{"text":"I've had better but ok for $2.75 and being relatively close to me so convenience was key. clearly a quick take out place"}
{"text":"I'm giving it four stars in comparison to other banh mi places I've tried in the GTA. Coming from Montreal, which has quite a large Vietnamese population, I've had really good banh mi (consistently!). Since moving here, I've tried Rose's, banh mi bale (both locations), oceans, tnt, and some others I don't remember (and Banh mi boys doesn't count, that would not be fair to the traditional preparation). My complaint with the other places is that they either don't seem clean, fresh, the bread is not right, or the meats are a little off. You need the right combination to make me a regular and huy-ky has managed that. The barbq pork is my favorite and the $1 pork rolls are also pretty good. Friendly staff, fresh food. Great little place, better than most."}
{"text":"These people don't wash their hands or wear protective gloves when preparing your food. We walked in there to order sandwiches and the woman was on her phone, didn't hang up, stayed on the call and was attempting to prepare our food. When we noticed she didn't wash her hands or protect her hands, we were like, \"we're outta here\". A friend also went there and he said a kid was working there, the kid was outside smoking then went in to make my friend a sandwich and he too didn't wash his hands. Yuck, where's the health department?"}
{"text":"By far the best pork and chicken Banh Mi in Toronto. Be sure to get the pork and chicken mix, extra meat.   Spring rolls are also delicious as well as the steamed buns. I had the moon cake today and the green been is bomb!"}
{"text":"Best banh mi in Toronto for the price! 3.00 for either mixed meat or tofu sandwich! So tasty and fresh.   I have travelled throughout Vietnam and it taste almost as good at the banh mi street stalls!  *everytime I have eaten here (3 or 4 times) it has appeared clean and they have used gloves"}
