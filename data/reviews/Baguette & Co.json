{"text":"Super tasty sandwiches, reasonably priced and very friendly staff. Kind of funny location but worth stopping in if you're passing by."}
{"text":"Simple and fantastic. The staff are sweet, the place is small but comfortable. I had a banh mi which was great as everyone else has said but my favorite part was the soup and the smoothie. They make everything on site and it is the perfect lunch spot."}
{"text":"Mhmmm eating their grilled pork bahn mi, east style. So delicious!

Great portions, the bread is just the right consistency and as a person who usually doesn't choose pork (but I went with it based on a previous reviewer's photo of their sandwich), the grilled pork is really good.

It's a cute little shop and friendly staff. 

I definitely would recommend dropping by for a decent priced yummy sandwich!"}
{"text":"This review is long overdue! We've been coming here pretty much every week for a few months to get their amazing banh mi sandwiches. 
We've tried the beef and the grilled chicken and the flavour in both is killer - something about the way the chef cooks the meat, it's very tender. It's such a simple yet flavourful sandwich and the price? It's about 6 bucks for a large- you can't beat that!

The service is always on point - the family is very warm and welcoming, they know us by name and what it's important about any restaurant is the consistency and this place is always consistent! A hidden gem in my backyard and I'm so happy to support a local business like this!"}
{"text":"Amazing!!!! I try to come here at least once a week for a really tasty Banh Mi sandwich. A steal at $3.99 for the grilled pork Banh mi. The staff are very friendly and welcoming. We need more places like this in toronto!"}
{"text":"Finally! Delicious bahn mi sandwiches in the west end! I am a bahn mi aficionado and I regularly visit bahn mi boys and Nguyen huong and this place is on par with them, perhaps better even. Full 5 stars for the pork bahn mi with kimchi added. Must try, and super affordable! I'll be back, soon....

Also the owners/staff are super friendly and helpful, and the place looks very nice inside."}
{"text":"Everything is always so fresh and the family that owns it is so lovely. 
It's extremely affordable but you get a lot for what you pay for. 
I always get the tofu sandwich and add avocado.
If you need a quick snack when you're in this neighborhood definitely the right place."}
{"text":"Absolutely love the banh mi. I've tried the pork, chicken and beef banh mi and they're all great. The people who run the place (I think they're a family) are so friendly. Prices are really reasonable too - about $4+ for a banh mi. 

My only gripe about the place is they keep on running out of the large baguettes and the soup! I have to come much earlier next time."}
{"text":"Not what I was expecting, it was much better ! I tried the pork and beef baguette, Mmmmmmm
I'm used to the traditional style Banh Mi but this was slices of beef, pork with all the good toppings. Definitely coming back ! Great price also. 3.49-3.99."}
{"text":"I live near this spot and frequent it often. Lovely family who runs it, cheap prices, and absolutely delicious food. I love that you can choose between having your bahn mi either East or West style. It makes it a great place to take your picky friends. They've got more than just baguettes too, including fresh cut fruit, drinks, and soup. I recommend it all."}
{"text":"the food here is amazing and exactly what is to be expected.  the service is great and the prices are incomparable."}
{"text":"I can't wait to go back to that place! I had the grilled pork banh mi($3.99). The bread, meat and veggies were so fresh. The pork was so tender and perfectly seasoned. My picky daughter even loved it and told me that she would like to go back soon. 
You can place orders online then pick them up if you don't want to wait. It didn't take long to for them to prepare the sandwich though."}
{"text":"Finally stopped in to give it a try after having flagged it on the Yelp app for some time.  Ordered 2 12-inch baguettes, grilled pork and grilled chicken, both East style.  Portions were really filling, generous with the variety of ingredients.  I would highly recommend the grilled pork one, super juicy and flavourful.  You can dine in at one of the cute small tables for two (maybe a handful) or take out.  Would stop in again if en route and craving!"}
{"text":"Went here to get lunch take out around 1:30. They are busy on Saturdays and only staffed with 3 people including the person at the cash. Once I got in I ordered, only to wait 10-15 minutes. They take orders according to who arrived first, including customers who sit in. Did I mention the 3 workers include those who are the servers too? My biggest complaint would be how understaffed the place is, I know it's most likely a family place but still, it's a Saturday at lunch time. I got the spicy pork Korean bah mi. Decent price ($7.50) and very flavourful."}
{"text":"Waited a long time (4 months without my weekly sandwich!) for Baguette & Co. to re-open in their new location further west on Dundas in the Junction.  Parking is better, and way more space.  I love it for a quick bite - banh mi is delicious, and the family owners are friendly and welcoming.  Congratulations on the new location!"}
{"text":"I have been in here twice.. the first time was last year shortly after they opened.. I tried both the pork and chicken banh-mi-style sandwiches. I was looking forward to it since I love banh-mi and I like supporting small businesses in my neighbourhood. Unfortunately, the meat in both sandwiches tasted like either it had been sitting out too long or the oil used to cook it was old.. something about the meat just tasted off. Anyway it was disappointing and I didn't go back.

The second time was this morning. I was surfing Yelp and I came across this restaurant again.. all of the reviews are so positive and the photos looked good. I thought maybe they had improved since being open for a while. So I went in for lunch, and unfortunately this time the woman behind the counter was really rude! I'm not sure if she was the owner or just an employee. Anyway she scowled at me when I walked in. I was looking at their menu for about 5 seconds when she snapped at me if I'm going to order or not. There was literally no one else in the restaurant so I don't know why she was acting like that, maybe she was having a bad day? Anyway I said that I was having trouble reading the sign (it is written in very tiny writing on a chalkboard at the back). Instead of taking the opportunity to tell me about their menu or to make a suggestion about what to order, she told me that \"the majority of people don't have any trouble reading the sign\" in a rude tone of voice. After a moment's awkward silence I just ended up walking out. 

Not a good experience. Too bad!"}
{"text":"Very excited for this banh mi spot to pop up in the neighbourhood.  Now I don't have to travel to Chinatown for a cheap banh mi.  The ingredients are yummy and fresh.  The service is also very friendly."}
{"text":"Vietnamese banh mi sandwiches in the neighbourhood! Both the pork and chicken tasted great. Good pricing about $4.50 for a large baguette sandwich. Didn't like the Vietnamese coffee - wasn't strong enough to my liking. Service was a bit slow with line ups but they will probably work this out soon since they are still pretty new"}
{"text":"Do you know those places that you always want to go to but every time you remember them they are closed?  Baguette and Co is that place for me so imagine my pleasure when, during a conversation about what to have for dinner while driving home from a family visit, we passed an open B&Co. 

We both ordered the larger of the two sandwich options, opting for one beef and one pork, both spicy and both eastern style.   I believe the large sandwich is 12 inches with the small being 6, kind of like a Subway Sub except on a beautiful French baguette. 

Not similar to Subway Sub is everything else, quality, freshness, flavour, price.  These Bhan Mi fusion sandwiches are delicious.  I appreciate the 
ability to customize ones sandwich through east/west style options, toppings and dressings.    They have multiple hot pepper options - from scotch bonnet and down - love it.  

The most surprising part of our visit was not how much we enjoyed these gems but that our price for two large take out sandwiches was less than $12.  I had to ask whether they had made a mistake given the quality of the ingredients, that we had ordered two drinks to go along with our food  and that they cook the meat to order, but no, $12 was the cost of our dinner with beverages to boot.  

This is a lovely place to visit with a seemingly very lovely family running it.   Maybe 8-10 seats available in the restaurant. 

Our take out was a bit soggy by the time we ate it approx 15 minutes afterwards but we did order extra sauce"}
{"text":"I work out at the LA Fitness gym that is 700 m away from this location, so I decided to give it a try.  The place is pretty small, but clean and neat.  I called them to order ahead of time but no one pickup the phone.  When I got there, they have a large order in front of me and waited for about 15 minutes for my order. Their menu is pretty simple, not many choices.

I ordered the regular pork BBQ and spicy Korean Pork BBQ baguettes.  Each was $7.50 CDN.   I like the bread itself.  My husband and I gave the pork BBQ 4 stars and the spicy Korean Pork BBQ 3 stars since the sauce it the pork is a bit tangy and not as good as most spicy Korean BBQ sauce that I got used to.  They were generous on the meats.

We are not hash with our ratings because we came from California where there are a lot of good Vietnamese Baguette shops that are better.  Since we don't have much choices here, I can understand why many people gave it 5 stars.  It is better than average, but not exceptionally good."}
{"text":"this is my go to place for work day lunch. low price, yet great Vietnamese sandwiches. I mostly get char grilled chicken sandwich, Asian style (Viet style) with sriracha, hoisen,.kimchi and avocado. it's extra for kimchi and avocado but the price of the sandwich it self is really cheap so no one gets hurt. baguette breads are fresh, and they have weekly special menus so it's a good idea to peek on their Facebook page."}
{"text":"Great little Vietnamese sandwich spot in the west end!  Choose your own style (East or West) and customize to your liking with assorted mayos, sauces, cheese, and add-ons.  I tried a Korean Spicy Pork East style (butter, pork pate, pickled carrots, soy cilantro) with hoisin sauce.  The baguette was fresh, the fillings ratio was good, the meat was flavorful but not spicy.  The daily soup was chicken udon soup, great portion of udon with two slices of chicken breast meat, the soup was blend though.  Also had the Sunny Side Up smoothie (orange juice, banana, mango, pineapple), it was delicious and refreshing.  The food and price here are great, and the service is quick, no wonder this place is always busy when I visit."}
{"text":"Just ordered the Southern, Panko crusted whitefish banh mi which was delicious!  It took less than 10 minutes--such a lovely place.

The flavour was quite good, there was avocado smashed in one side, spicy Japanese kewpie mayo on the other, veggies and banana peppers topped the banh mi.  I am curious if the jackfruit so maybe I'll try that next time.  It looks like this may be a weekly trip.

The great part is fresh made lunch for $7.50 . You get your veggies, carbs and protein.

Today I got to see someone use the pay it forward board--no questions asked!

Part of me still wishes there was something small I can get on the side be it fries, a simple homemade lemonade, or whatever.  Bottled beverage is not my choice unless I really really must!

Wifi would be great as well!"}
{"text":"Pros:
- Very inexpensive! A banh mi sandwich with pork, chicken or beef is under $4, pre-tax (they also serve soups, salads and specials). Beverages, including iced coffee, cappuccino, and all kinds of sodas are well-priced.
- Comfortable seating. There are only three tables available, but it's comfortable to stay and eat in a small group.
- Terrific food! We had sandwiches, which were outstanding. The ingredients were fresh, and the bread was light and crisp. The iced coffee was perfect!
- Local ingredients. Many of their ingredients are locally-sourced, which are listed at the front of the order counter. It's always good to support restaurants that care about where their food comes from!
- Good for kids. They have activity sheets and crayons to entertain any kid (or grown-up).

Cons:
- Can't dine in with large groups. Although the seating is comfy, don't dine in with any more than six people. I'd suggest take-out.

Overall: An excellent sandwich/soup/salad stop that's easy on the wallet, but doesn't sacrifice quality."}
{"text":"I've been in Toronto less than a week and I've already been here twice,  it's that good!  The staff is very sweet and willing to help with suggestions or answer questions.  It's also super cheap! I ordered a 12 inch grilled beef, east style baguette with hoisin sauce all for $6. Absolutely love this cute little place. It's also really great for lunch on the go."}
{"text":"Seriously, awesome sandwiches. I always get the char pork east style w a cucumber slice. This banh no can't be beat and is easily my favorite sandwich on the west end. 
The baguette bread is perfect- crispy thin shell and a soft cloudy interior. The meat is a good portion in each sandwich and it's heated through; you're not getting cold cuts here. You can order t east style for a traditional banh mi (sans cucumber for some reason) or west style w lettuce, tomatoe, cheese etc. 

The soup here is awesome too. $2.75 

They just recently started to serve freshly made salads. They have three kinds: market, Asian, and harvest. A half size is $2.99 and a large is $4.99."}
{"text":"Baguette & Co is located around a 5-7 min walk from Dundas/Keele. As a fan of the banh mi sandwich, I was excited to try this place out for the first time (and I've been to quite a few banh mi places around Toronto). I was definitely surprised by the taste and quality of the banh mi! I got the grilled pork banh mi and the pork was marinated well (good quality meat too), the bread was toasted just right, and the fillings in the banh mi did not overwhelm the entire sandwich, instead, it elevated the meat and the bun. 

Add to the fact that the service was attentive and the staff were super friendly, will definitely be back for more in the future. Also, Baguette and Co has a Feed it Forward program which you can contribute to help subsidize meals for those in need (love the idea!).  

Overall, delicious place with great food and staff!"}
{"text":"Delicious bahn mi for relatively low prices! Not as meat packed as bahni mi boys but you can pay an extra dollar for \"extra protein\" and the price is still cheaper than bahn mi boys. Soup is delicious too! You can tell it's bone brothed and not just some powder nonsense."}
