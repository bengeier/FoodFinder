{"text":"This is one of my favorite places. The atmosphere is friendly, the service is outstanding, food is great and coffee is awesome. If you have not dined here yet shame on you."}
{"text":"So glad this restaurant has moved into our neighborhood.  We don't have to go far for a great breakfast.  The best (BEST!) cheesy potatoes I have ever eaten.  Cozy place to have breakfast or lunch with decent menu options at reasonable prices.   Give this place a try.  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"We have gone to this restaurant for dinner and loved it.  I contacted them about a surprise party for my mom for her 75th Birthday.  They do private parties!!!  We had my mom's party today and was not disappointed!!! I cannot thank Kim, Don, Premo, Cody,Amy and Chef Mike for such a spectacular day for my mom!  They made it all about herm. It felt like we were at home with our friends and family!  The food was spectacular!!!!  I know as after today they will have new customers.  It is Brentwoods little secret, but not for long!  If you want a new place to try go here!  If you have a special occasion to celebrate like a birthday, communion, confirmation, graduation or Anniversary, please call Kim.  I promise you won't be disappointed!!!  Can't wait for our Valentines day,  Dinner, menu is awesome!!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I visited The Crack'd Egg this morning for breakfast. The restaurant's atmosphere was warm, welcoming, and cozy! I loved the decor and the environment. The waiter was on point and super friendly. Additionally, the food was excellent and we enjoyed every bite! ~ A great small business to support that provides a great experience!"}
{"text":"I've been twice, a Sunday each time. The menu is scaled down on Sundays, which is something I personally dislike. I feel Saturday and Sunday is your prime chance to pump out your best dishes, not the b class to save time.   Each time I went, I felt very rushed, despite the restaurant not appearing busy. This is very annoying to the point where you are asked if you have decided 3-4 times within two minutes of sitting down. Maybe this is a tactic to rush people before they have a chance to realize nothing amazing is on the menu.   Each time, I have ordered a coffee - each time, the cup had old coffee stains on it which is disgusting.   Onto the food: I have tried the breakfast pizza, which sounds like a light, fresh spin on breakfast. However, this dish was LOADED with olives and easily became overly salty. I actually felt a tad sick afterwards.  The second visit order was the chicken/ egg dish. You get two small chicken fingers that seemed just a tad overlooked. The marble rye toast and eggs were good enough. My main complaint with this order was with the side of \"potato pancakes\". They were smaller version of McDonald's hashbrowns.... Nowhere near what a potato pancake is supposed to be. They should just call them hashbrowns.    A friend ordered the cracked Arnold- they rated it mediocre.   This place could be good if the had better menus on Sundays and focused on improving their service and cleanliness.   Save yourself the disappointment and head to J. Ts diner a few doors down. They don't try to be as fancy, but they cook good meals."}
{"text":"Let me begin by saying I don't tend to like diner's.  This is different the place is clean and the staff is so friendly.  My breakfast was amazing.  Best home fries I have had in a long time.  My food was so delicious.  I only wish I had more home fries"}
{"text":"15-20 min wait to be seated. 50 Min wait for food.  Very below average / bad food. Dry pancakes. Cold food.  Undercooked Potatoes.  Eggs were slightly runny.  Don't even look at the turkey sausage it was terrible. Waitress was nice."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped here for a late breakfast on Saturday.  The restaurant wasn't crowded and we were seated promptly.  Our server, Danielle, greeted us immediately and took good care of us while we were there.  I can't complain about the service at all.  I got the lemon ricotta pancakes with blueberry syrup.  I tasted neither lemon nor ricotta in the pancakes and the blueberry syrup tasted bitter and burnt...maybe it's just my tastebuds.  My husband ordered the 'Release the Crack'n' which was a little bit of everything - pancakes, eggs, potatoes, toast and bacon.  He thought his meal was quite good.  I was slightly put off by the music though.  The music playing in the restaurant was loud and very, very Christian.  Perhaps this doesn't bother most, but it was off-putting to us.  I don't mind a little background music while I eat, but I never like it loud enough to notice.  This was our first time so I'm not sure if this is an all the time thing or just the choice of a specific person this particular day.  Our meals with coffee were around $30, which was a little steep but we received plenty of food and were full all day."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place! I ordered the Greek omelet delish!! Service was good looking forward to sitting outside love that they put large glass doors on so it can be opened to cafe style seating during nice weather. Great place"}
{"text":"Great independent diner serving breakfast all day. I went on a Friday mid-day and it was quiet, but service was good. Basically, everything we tried was great - eggs over medium, bacon, corned beef, turkey sausage patties, pancakes, potato pancakes (though these would be more aptly described as hashbrown coins or something). It's a bit of trek from Pittsburgh proper, but I think it'd be worth making the trip again on a day when we're in the mood for brunch and a drive."}
{"text":"Just tried The Crack'd Egg diner this morning for breakfast and it's easily a new favorite. The place has a very cute set up and is extremely clean! They have a huge menu with so many options of not only breakfast items but lunch items as well. I've been to other breakfast places that are so busy and filled up it's a little intimidating! It wasn't all that busy today, but they of course have a good turn out for a newer diner! The price is very reasonable and the food is very fresh! This is a great add to Brownsville road! Very convenient location!"}
{"text":"Had breakfast there on Sunday, the food was plentiful and extremely delicious.  Plan on going there on a weekly basis.  Great job!!"}
{"text":"The cutest little breakfast place around! The inside is surprisingly spacious for the area. There is a cute little outdoor patio as well. Not only was the restaurant nice, but the food... oh my god. It was a little pricey for a breakfast, but you got more than your money's worth. I had the banana pecan French toast, and wow, I have never had anything like it. If you can get the pecan praline syrup on a meal, absolutely do it. It is incredible. Love this place!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place out. I love a good breakfast, and the menu sounded great. Talk about being underwhelmed... The food was so blah. My potato pancakes looked like something you'd buy in the freezer section at Wal Mart, and they were clearly left in the deep fryer too long. The gravy was gelatinous. My partner's pancakes were uncooked in the middle. All this said, I continue to hear good things about the place. So I'm willing to give it another try. Just not yet..."}
{"text":"This is a little sweet secretin the South Hills Pittsburgh. My son saw the reviews on yelp and we went for it. So glad we did. The breakfast was the best ever. We typically just go to the food chains but now that we found this place we have changed our tune. Weekends are are to get in but weekdays are good."}
{"text":"Cute little place, very family friendly. They gave my niece a balloon after she was done eating! And they had toys and games for kids to borrow while there. They have a tiny patio where I saw a couple of dogs. Food was good, not great. Everyone seemed okay with their meals. My sister in law got biscuits and gravy we were shocked at the small portions. We got a bacon basket, which was awesome. We had to ask for coffee refills, but they were busy. Decent place for breakfast in the area!"}
{"text":"This morning was my 4th visit to this restaurant and unfortunately my last. I really wanted to like it because it is local-I live very close-and independently owned. Never have had a great experience food wise and lately it seems on the dirty side. I ordered the grin-eggs over medium, toast, and bacon. It wasn't busy in the dining room and I specifically told the young man who was my waiter I like my bacon crisp and do not want any uncooked white on my over medium/hard eggs. When my order came it was without my toast-he said it was in the toaster. I had to flag him down 5 min later to ask for my toast. He went into the kitchen which was also not busy-the door was open because of the nice day and I could see him grab my toast without washing his hands-he disappeared somewhere to butter it/ brought it to my table-never apologized or stopped back to see if I wanted jelly(not on the table). This same young man went on to handle menus/money and whatever I don't care to think about. AND my egg whites were runny and bacon so gummy I couldn't eat it. I am picky about cleanliness and also a nurse so know not washing hands before handling food can lead to illness. The owners need to educate food staff on importance of hand washing to protect the public."}
{"text":"This is such a great little place for breakfast or lunch or even brunch. Great food, staff, friendly warm environment."}
{"text":"We were greeted by a very gracious host. Upon being seated our server came over to take our drink order from us. after the drinks were served we ordered our meals. A short time later our breakfast dishes were brought to our table. My wife and I were very impressed with the presentation of the food and the amount that was on our plates. are eggs bacon and potatoes were cooked to perfection. I recommend this place to anybody that's in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Food was delicious.  1st time here.  Service was grear and very attentive.  Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Great food overall and staff friendly and attentive.  My wife's eggs Benedict was the only complaint as the poached eggs were both cooked hard which is not how they should be. Portions are huge and prices are a bit high, but the food quality is quite good. Very busy on weekends but the weekdays are a great day to go in and have breakfast or brunch."}
{"text":"I tried again with the family tonight during Brentwood Light up Night. Service was very friendly like usual. I orderd a bleu cheese burger wihtout the bun (see pic). The beef is grass feed and very good. The bleu cheese did the trick for me with the toppings of tomato, onion and lettuce.   We also had a nice hot cup of wedding soup and it was wonderful.    I am keeping this at 3 stars for the time being, this is definetly better the the other breakfast place a few buildings down."}
{"text":"The Crack'd Egg is a cozy and friendly neighborhood breakfast spot! As a new resident to PA I so appreciate the love for breakfast foods and all of the options Pittsburgh has to offer. I was looking for a spot where I could eat alone and would have the charm of a neighborhood spot but still accept credit cards (what can I say.. I'm a millennial and rarely have cash).   I visited on a Friday morning. It was busy but not too busy to be seated immediately. The service was quick and friendly. Surprisingly quick!! I ordered pumpkin coffee off their seasonal menu and that was great. Then I ordered chocolate chip pancakes and bacon.   This isn't your greasy diner type of place so that's why I'm excited to give it 5 stars. I'm happy to support a neighborhood gem that serves delicious breakfast food in a clean, upscale environment with friendly service and good prices.   I can't wait to go back to try the cinnamon bun!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times, but today WOW, what AWSOME servce from ?? Marlene?? Anyways, food was good as always, just not sure why they serve the sweet sausage crumbled, still not bad tho. But if you go, hope you get this new girl, she's a great server & always attentive to your needs"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place.   Clean nicely decorated.  Service was excellent.  Waitress was very attentive. Took a little while for our order but nothing crazy.    Food was well worth the wait.  Good portion size.  More than I usually pay for breakfast but was worth every penny!"}
{"text":"There's nothing more that I love than breakfast. Replacing an older breakfast joint, the Crack's Egg really cracked the code to a great spot. Totally renovated and open space. The coffee is strong, hot and bottomless.   I've visited twice and can't wait to go back for more. Omelettes are fluffy and full. Selections of breads to accompany and choices of potatoes makes me very happy on a Saturday AM drop-in.   While I haven't (yet) tried the waffles or pancakes, from a distance they look amazing! One of these options will definitely be my next morning fill up though it will be hard to veer from my love of omelettes.   Stop in and check this place out!"}
{"text":"Had a week worth of work here in the Pittsburgh area and was looking for a good breakfast place. Warm interior and a super friendly staff, Marlene in particular showed a great service. I had a corned beef hash and it was excellent. I came by two more times after that and had the same thing CBH. Most definitely come back again and would recommend this place. Also price was very reasonable."}
{"text":"This place is so cute and quaint, not to mention the food is delicious. I have been here numerous times with friends and family and I never have been disappointed. Everything is fresh and the service is good. The cheesy bacon pizza is delicious."}
{"text":"Love this place ... Service is great waiters are friendly environment is nice and clean cute upscale place...."}
{"text":"Great food and a lovely ambiance.  Friendly servers who were very attentive.  I was really impressed by the menu- who knew there were so many great breakfast options? I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent, French toast, pancakes, waffles, eggs, potatoes, even the coffee was delicious.  Definitely give this place a try..."}
{"text":"It's nice to see a new breakfast spot in the South Hills area of the Burgh- they were in need of one. This place is very cute and homey, with friendly and welcoming service as the icing on the cake. The food is very good- we came here for breakfast and had a wonderful meal. It's nothing that will blow you away with unique and crazy flavors, but instead it is comforting, delicious breakfast food that you are already familiar with and love."}
{"text":"I love this place!! I just don't like that there is no privacy in the bathrooms. When I was 6 months pregnant I was in the bathroom puking, and everyone in the restaurant heard! How embarrassing, but I laugh about it now!"}
{"text":"The food is good but the service can be a little slow.  I really enjoy the lemon ricotta pancakes if you can catch them on the menu when you go.  Great casual and inexpensive option for breakfast."}
{"text":"Service was very good. Pankcakes were awesome. Omlets can use a little more work.... All ingredients look to be prepared separately and then folded at the end. Hard to eat without ingredients falling out."}
{"text":"The Crack'd Egg is definitely in my top 5 favorite breakfast places in Pittsburgh. I love the atmosphere and how it is so cozy. All the servers I've had have been so nice and helpful which makes the expirevce even better! All the food was fresh and handmade which is a pleasant surprise compared to most breakfast places. I am not able to have cream as asked if she had soy or almond milk, unfortunately they didn't, but they said they would look into getting some next time and were so helpful providing me with alternative options. There specials each week are so tasty!!"}
{"text":"the decor here is beautiful!!! And the service is always very kind. The reason I have to unfortunately knock it down a few stars is things are changing here fast. My dad went to pick us up lunch from here about a week ago and they told him they don't serve grilled chicken or turkey sausage anymore. The turkey sausage I can understand if it isn't popular to save money but grilled chicken? That comes in some of my favorite and what I'm assuming so of the more popular entrees (grilled chicken salad, grilled chicken sandwich) etc. they still serve chicken but only fry it now, maybe it conserve it and save money, which I understand but I can't deny it's a bit of an inconvenience to people who prefer grilled. Overall it's still delicious food, but hopefully not much else will Change."}
{"text":"Stopped in this cool little cafe for a quick lunch, and was happy we did. What a great little gem right in Brentwood!  Right across from the giant eagle on Brownsville road, it's easy to get to with plenty of parking on street and around the corner. Lots of space inside with a cool set up. The menu is awesome with great breakfast items and lunch meals. We had the grilled chicken sandwich and the tomato basil soup. Soup is made fresh and it's excellent. The breakfast menu had plenty of options as well as daily specials. The day we were there they had a smores pancake that looked amazing!!! We will be back... Often"}
{"text":"I'm a breakfast lover and this spot definitely hit the spot. Ordered release the cracking and it did not disappoint, pancakes were so large and fluffy. Prices were perfect for the amount of food you receive. Definitely keeping on my list of top places to go to!"}
{"text":"Overall, a solid breakfast choice and we will be back.   We stopped by on a Saturday morning and were told to sit anywhere.  I chose a table in the front near the open garage door - very comfy with a nice cafe feel.     Both of our breakfasts were plentiful and tasty (skip the biscuit and gray though - the gravy was sub-par).   Staff members were friendly even with the chaos that a table on the patio was creating with their two dogs.   The chaos was actually quite entertaining and the people creating it were really good-natured, so it wasn't unwelcome or annoying.   You can BYOB to make bloody marys and Irish coffee and such.     Prices were reasonable, but don't forget to pay the meter....one $15 ticket later."}
{"text":"We are so happy to have this little place close to us! We've been here for breakfast, lunch, and dinner and have always been wowed. Sometimes you don't expect diner-like places to have anything really outstanding but this joint changes that! Before I got pregnant the eggs Benedict were my favorite. Even the oatmeal is good! Husband loves the chicken and waffles. I don't think they're doing dinner right now but if they bring it back you need to try the meatloaf and mashed potatoes. Better than home-cooked. I really hope this place sticks around because next to Frank and Shirley's it's our go-to for breakfast."}
{"text":"The Bird and I have been to the Crack'D Egg nearly a dozen times already.  Don't let the name fool you this is not just a breakfast place.  From burgers to huge salads to the incredible meatloaf you will not be disappointed !  (Yes the breakfast items are great and fun!). The fact it is also a BYOB place just adds to the place!  We can't wait for the spring when they will open up the front garage door and we can sit outside and enjoy a glass of wine."}
{"text":"My wife went to this place first after a friend recommended it. She came back bringing me along for the ride, and I'm glad she did. The menu has a wide selection of breakfast and lunch items. I'd take off half a star if I could, mainly due to parking issues.  The prices are slightly higher than some breakfast places, but the quality is very high. We both ordered their Eastwood Omelet $9.99. It was a combination of cheese, onion, peppers, ham and bacon. The meats were of much higher quality than I expected. Great job! I would also recommend their cheesy potatoes. First Watch now has some serious competition for a place that specializes in breakfast. They offer limited outdoor seating,  but the interior is very homey. Service could not have been better. They have a loyalty program. We joined. Need I say more?"}
{"text":"Food was interesting and delicious. Service was quick and waitress was on point."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I have gone here a few times and it has become our favorite breakfast/brunch spot in Pittsburgh.  The prices are very reasonable, especially considering the service and quality of food you receive. When it's nice out you can sit outside, or sit inside and enjoy the sunlight as they open the garage door at the front of the restaurant.  This place is BYOB and also have a BYOB Bloody Mary Bar on Sundays (this is something you never find)!  I have ordered a different item off the menu all three visits and I would re-order and recommend all three (corned beef hash, breakfast burrito, chicken and eggs).  I cannot wait to go again on Sunday!"}
{"text":"Went here on Wednesday and was pleased. Only had breakfast and will come back for lunch/dinner. Food was great and service was great.   A little advice if the owners see this, don't yell that orders are ready from the kitchen. Just buy a bell and ding it when orders are up."}
{"text":"Holy Moly Breakfast Nirvana!!! The Crack'd Egg, just Crack'd into my top 3 favorite morning eateries in Pittsburgh! I plan on becoming a regular here before the rest of the Burgh finds out about this place. It's literally perfect.   The food, the service, the upscale diner setting, I wouldn't change a thing. And on top of it all, the prices are very reasonable! Oh yeah, and it's BYOB!! Oh yeah, and it's never too busy!!!  The only reason that I'm writing this review and not trying to keep this place as my own personal secret is because I don't want to run the risk of them not succeeding.   I HATE driving down Sawmill Run Blvd from Green Tree, but for this breakfast insanity, I'm just gonna have to suck it up."}
{"text":"Great food. Great coffee. Servers, all of them, were there for anything we needed. Everything came out hot. Kids food first. All three kids were even given a balloon when we were done.  Small family friendly environment. Well worth any wait."}
{"text":"So the only reason this place doesn't get one star is because the food and the decor is actually pretty good.    However after that it goes way down hill faster. Today was our third time here and the service continues to get worse & worse. Our server today Jules was the epitome of atrocious.   If I was dying of thirst, I would of shriveled up and died. I got one refill of water after begging for it. She never took our waters from our table to refill.   Then my wife asked for more sriracha honey sauce for her chicken & waffles, Jules never brought it. It seemed like she was avoiding us for some reason.   I'm not quite sure how this place works, but It doesn't seem like the servers have sections. Jules had tables outside, two tables right by the bar and tables in the back of the restaurant. How can a server possible be all over the restaurant and give good service.   And to recall our last visit I ordered a dish with a poached egg and it was hard inside. The server told me I was wrong and that's the way the egg was suppose to be. Well obviously she doesn't know what a poached egg is. How can you work at a bfast joint and not know what a poached eggs. The manager that day gave me 10% off my entree. Thanks for the $1.90 savings?!?!?  I really want to like this place the food is really good, but service is poor, it takes too long for the food to come out, it makes me not want to come back.   Crak'd egg thank you but no thanks"}
{"text":"Was on our way for breakfast and was stopped at light and changed plans when saw the sign. And glad we did. We will definitely be back. Food and customer service you don't find at many restaurants any more."}
{"text":"Excellent service atmosphere and food  our new spot ....we had the cheese omelet meal the waffles with praline syrup and bananas"}
{"text":"This was my first time I've tried this place, and it certainly won't be the last! I really enjoyed my visit today. We went for breakfast and there was plenty of parking. I imagine on the weekend, it will be really tough to find parking if it is packed. They have meter parking, and unfortunately I didn't have cash, so we planned to just keep an eye out. However, our seating did not give us the view of the street. The waitress was super sweet and gave us some quarters - just in case. I had the Eastwood omelette with crispy potato pancakes. They both were very delicious. The crispy potato pancakes were cooked perfectly! They were crunchy and very flavorful. I would be happy with just those! The omelette included peppers, onions, cheese, ham, and bacon. Every ingredient stood out but didn't over power any of the others. So with each bite I tasted everything!! This was one of the best breakfast meals I've had in awhile. Can't wait to try something else on the menu."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our time here. Friendly service and good food. Prices are a little high but, overall it was great!"}
{"text":"The Crack'd Egg was more like a scrambled experience.  Once arriving, the hostess was outside having a conversation that the waitress openly admitted to us. They weren't sure what to do with us, only to eventually seat us. We waved this off as a weird fluke and tried to get on with the meal.  After getting seated, we realized that our table was a very awkward size. I was so far away from my dining partner that it was uncomfortable. Some of the seating is also on a higher level than the middle of the floor so I felt as if people were staring as me/our meal the entire time which was uncomfortable.  After ordering a tea and waiting on my deal, the chicken and the egg, a waitress spilled her tray of drinks which flung themselves far enough to also get on me more than the table at which she spilled at (higher level seating 1, me 0). I understand that mistakes happen, but at this point it just seemed like the whole staff was unsure about everything going on.  When the meals finally arrived they were okay but not great. I'm so glad that I asked for the gravy that came with my meal on the side as it was very heavy and I didn't end up using it at all. The chicken and eggs were tasty, but nothing to write home about. However, because the food was good and better than your average diner, I'm giving this place a 3 stars because of all the other awkwardness."}
{"text":"Just across street from my coffee latte found store, I see this. So..carrot cake looks great as I walk in. Clerk seating me says oh yes and made here in house. That i'm having now. Not amazing but pretty good. Have asked for eggs, bacon, potatoes, and a biscuit. Cool setting here with roll-up glass garage door on front facing street. Cool. Overall everything was very good and service excellent. I would absolutely return."}
{"text":"This place is a fantastic breakfast nook! The cute place is very well decorated, and even though we didn't sit there, I thought their bar was beautiful. The place isn't very large but they have found a way to include a lot of seating without feeling like the table next to you is too close. We took our seats and the waitress came right over to ask for our drinks, I got a vanilla cold brew coffee and it was so good, dare I say better than Starbucks! I really appreciated how friendly and attentive our waitress was. I know from experience that being a waitress is a hard job. The menu had a great number of awesome sounding breakfasts. My boyfriend got the \"Release the Crackin\" which is basically a little bit of everything, and I got a biscuit and gravy with potato pancakes. My food was delicious, my boyfriend's meal was epic and looked freshly made. The pancakes were huge and a different texture from pancakes I've had but I really liked them! This is a great place for breakfast and it's very affordable!!"}
{"text":"This place is cute and quaint for a relaxed Sunday breakfast. I had their Lenten special, which was a salmon eggs Benedict with a lemony hollandaise sauce, served over potato pancakes and cheesy potatoes on the side. I wish I would have substituted for a different side because it was just too much with the hollandaise (but still delicious). It's BYOB, so don't forget the necessary mimosa parts!"}
{"text":"Visitors from out of town and we felt right at home here at The Crack'd Egg. The staff was AMAZING. Friendly, courteous, and WONDERFUL with kids. We had a very squirrely and hangry 2 year old and they went above and beyond to keep her entertained and happy. I think it's fantastic that they have a kids toy station for kids to go pick what they want to allow the adults a minute to get their morning caffeine pumping in their veins.  The food was outstanding. Everything that was ordered in our party of 6 was top notch and we all licked our plates clean. Notables: My husband had the TOP O' THE MORNIN' Hash and I had THE CHICKEN & THE EGG. Amazing.   We left highly recommending this place to our local family who hadn't been before, and will definitely return whenever we're in town!!"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our breakfast there.  The kids loved it too.  Very friendly service and good food.  I'm not a huge fan of french toast but theirs was very good."}
{"text":"I thought this place was great, very reasonable prices and extremely friendly staff. I came here around lunchtime on a weekday, and was able to be seated right away, which is nice. They have an open front to their restaurant, with a garage-door-style opening that can roll up or down in inclement weather. The decor inside was extremely charming, and spotlessly clean. I ordered the cracked egg sandwich with bacon, and loved it! I would probably recommend asking for provolone or mozzarella cheese in place of the American cheese, but that's just a personal preference. Will definitely go again."}
{"text":"Grand Opening today at this establishment. We knew it was coming so we were excited to try out a place we had heard was going to be good. The restaurant feels like you are stepping into a friend or relatives eat in kitchen to have a meal. The staff is very friendly. They are knowledgeable about their menu. There is a \"breakfast bar \" type counter where you can sit or their is a large dining room. Everything is new, fresh, and clean. Its contemporary yet home-y.  I ordered the waffles. They come with 2 eggs and a breakfast meat. I gave my son the eggs. I ordered bacon as my meat. The waffles were crispy on the edges which is how I like them. The bacon was a little crispy and the saltiness wasn't overwhelming. The sweet of the waffles with the saltiness of the bacon was a great bite.  My son ordered blueberry pancakes. He chose bacon as his breakfast meat. The pancakes were full of blueberries. They were fantastic.  I think we just found a new breakfast place. They also serve lunch and dinner. I will definitely be coming back to try more dishes."}
{"text":"I only review the places that you MUST visit or purchase services and the ones to steer clear of, this is a hidden gem in Brentwood. Have been there several times for breakfast, never an extended wait, servers are super friendly, food is fresh, eggs NOT cooked in a vat of grease (thank you), French toast is devine, and although their iced coffee comes from a concentrate, I fell in love with it. This is one of the cleanest restaurants I've ever been. My only complaint is that they don't do a bigger dinner menu, I'd love to see them do Farm to Table entrees with substance."}
{"text":"It's Sunday so free street parking! I wanted more than I could eat but ordered it anyway.  Everything tasted great and the waitress remembered my name and how I like my eggs. Impressive since I wouldn't call myself a regular.  Our table was too small to hold all the plates so that was a bit annoying, but we made do and enjoyed ourselves and the food nonetheless."}
{"text":"I visit this place sometimes on the weekends for brunch because it is so close to home. The quality is always pretty good, prices are reasonable, great diner coffee But leave extra time if you go here because the service is quite slow, the food usually takes at least 30-40 minutes and the servers don't seem to be in any hurry either"}
{"text":"A hidden gem in the South Hills!!! Food was delicious, service was great and atmosphere charming!!!!  We will be back!"}
{"text":"We've been there three times. The first time we had a big group with lots of kids. They put us in the back out of the way and it worked out really well. The food was decent but with all the kids I didn't pay a lot of attention.   The other two times we only had one kid and the food was really bad. The hamburger was prepackaged and WAY over cooked. I got steak and eggs and the steak was so salty i could only take two bites and my mouth was on fire. It took me the entire day to get the salt taste out of my mouth. Really, I don't mind salt, but this was insane.   My wife got eggs Benedict type thing and the eggs were way over cooked. It was supposed to come with sliced mozzarella but they left it out.   Regretfully after those two experiences we won't be back."}
{"text":"I was hesitant to try this place with my pap since we are both some what picky eaters and didn't know what kind of items to expect.  We both enjoyed it.  It was a cute place with nice waitresses.  I got a croissant sandwich that was really good.  The croissant was nice and flaky and I got potato pancakes as my side and they were good.  The waitress asked if I wanted sour cream or applesauce with them and I said sour cream but I didn't get it.  I could have asked her for it but after trying them I decided that I didn't need it and ate them happily plain. My grandpa got an open face sandwich and he enjoyed it but it came out cold so he asked for it to be heated up.  He was fine with it just being put in the microwave but they recooked it.  They didn't say that but it took a long time for it to come back, I was practically finished when it came back, and I noticed that the two bites he took weren't there so I concluded that it was a whole new plate.  I also kept seeing complaints about the prices being to high but to me the prices were average for the items being locally sourced."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick B-fast to meet a friend who really liked the Crack'd Egg.  Liked the service and friendliness of the staff.   The menu has some creative takes on some old standbys.  My Capri Benedict is two eggs on two thick sliced tomatoes with some Motz cheese, Hollandaise, and Balsamic Reduction and some great home fries.  Really a nice B-fast."}
{"text":"This was my first time here for breakfast.  The food was fresh, the menu names creative and the server very personable!  I knew it would be a good experience when our server just gave us four quarters for the parking meter and told us about the street behind the restaurant to park next time.   The coffee was hot and not your typical water downed breakfast java.  It was bold and delicious.  They offer three different kinds of potatoes; cheesy, home fries and crispy potato pancakes. We had the latter two and they were both full of flavor.    The toast options were more extensive than most as well.  An added bonus included in the jelly selection orange marmalade and apple butter... again outside of the norm.  I had the chicken and the egg. Two homemade chicken tenders smothered in a very yummy homemade gravy, two eggs (mine over medium for a little dippy action), home fries and two thick pieces of marble rye toast.  My daughter had the Eastwood which was a stuffed omelet with all kinds of goodness.   My only lack of five stars was the price. For two of us with tip $30 for breakfast. A bit steep. But you pay for the ambience and the quality food.  Don't worry. I will be back!  Well done!!!"}
{"text":"I stopped over here after my blood work \"fast\" to try out their breakfast. They actually serve lunch and brunch but I opted for breakfast. The place is very clean and there are tables and booths along with a bar to eat from.  Upon arrival I was told I could sit anywhere I wanted. I chose a large booth and my waitress was extremely attentive to my needs. I even had a cloth napkin which held my silverware. Portion sizes appeared huge but I had a craving for an omelette. If one on the list didn't meet your expectations then you can order a \"make your own\" with one meat and 3 other fillings. The omelet comes with toast of your choice, and your choice of home fries or potato pancakes.  Most omelets are 3 eggs so I ordered one with Swiss cheese and veggies. Everything you need is right on the table including ketchup. I got my food in a reasonable amount of time.  This omelet was delicious and the rye bread that came with it was very thick! Quite filling to say the least. I had coffee-your standard type you would get in most breakfast spots but I liked the fact that the food was not greasy and believe me hard to finish. Prices are very reasonable for what you are getting. This is a very small place on Brownsville Road almost directly opposite Brentwood Towne Square. Parking however, can pose a problem. Street parking is available if you are lucky enough to find it. You cannot park in the Towne Square and walk up. Signs are there stating they will tow unless you are visiting one of those businesses.   Definitely a must return to try out for lunch. 2 hour street parking is available during the day but again the spots are very limited."}
{"text":"I can honestly say that this is the first breakfast spot we've ever been to that had cloth napkins.  The people there were really nice and our food came to the table quickly. My wife and I both ordered a side of fruit and while it wasn't canned fruit, some of the grapes were a little rotten. My ham and cheese omelet was pretty good, but the ham was actually cold. If it would have been grilled, like the side of ham my wife ordered, it would have been better. So the food wasn't bad, and the people were friendly, but the rotten fruit, cold ham, and the fact it was actually a little on the pricey side for breakfast, I could only go 3 stars."}
{"text":"This is about my fourth time coming here, and the food seems to only get better.  They have refined their eggs Benedict recipe, The Cracked Arnold, to where it is a bout the best I've ever tasted.  Of course the corn beef hash is great too.  Its hard to go wrong with almost anything on their menu.  On weekends it gets a little crowded as all restaurants do, so if you want no wait and faster than usual service, stop in during the week.  Still for how crowded it is the weekend service is still pretty good, and the food more than makes up for it."}
{"text":"My partner and I visited for an attempted quick bite. Don't come here if that's what you're looking for. We were here for almost 2 hours in total. My meal was mostly delicious. If you make it here, get the cheesy potatoes. The bacon was a disappointment. It was a dried husk compared to the beautiful thick cut bacon pictured in the photos.   My partner's \"over medium\" eggs were incredibly runny, and his pancakes were like stiff Frisbee. The nice potential of this place is the BYOB bloody marys, but we didn't think ahead to do that."}
{"text":"Overall Impression: A well-themed BYOB breakfast joint in Brentwood that has twists on breakfast classics, is moderately priced, and uses quality ingredients. The orange cloth napkins are just a bonus!  The Food: I don't know what more you could ask for--because they allow you to BYOB for Bloody Mary's and Mimosa's and have literal BUCKETS of bacon. Those two factors alone should make you want to high-tail it in there. My boyfriend and I frequent this place on weekends for breakfast, as he lives right down the road, and we've never been disappointed. I'm a chicken and gravy fan, so I usually order the \"Chicken and the Egg\" with my eggs over-easy with mini potato pancakes. The fried chicken tenders are decent although you may want to order extra gravy, it's a little skimpy for true gravy fans. The eggs are cooked exactly how you want them and the mini potato pancakes are perfectly seasoned. The boyfriend usually goes for the Eastwood omelet and adds ghost pepper cheese for an extra kick, and the eggs are fluffy and generously-filled. There is always ample toast and coffee creamer. The menu allows you to BYO-omelet, has a wide variety of choice, and even names a local sandwich, \"The Brentwood Duke,\" as unique to the local area. There is little left to be desired with so much quality and variety attached--not to mention there's eggs on almost all breakfast dishes in a multitude of ways.  The Restaurant: I can only describe it as a quaint modern diner with an upscale twist. They use bright orange, green, and splashes of red to give a positive, fresh feeling, and they try keep a spacey feel to a rather cramped space. The ladies at the seating area are always pleasant, and you can choose to sit at the bar or within the restaurant--we prefer to sit at the bar, as there's more space to eat. The only aspect of this location that is borderline obnoxious is how small the tables are combined with how much stuff they try to stick on them (advertising, eating accoutrements, trash bucket, etc.), but I understand that they wanted to fit as many tables/booths as they could to their small space--maybe just nix the extra bits on the table? Between both of our breakfast plates and another plate in the middle of a shared waffle, we were accidentally pushing each other's plates halfway off the table and had to put all the extra things on the floor. Beside the small table space, they make up for it with their high emphasis on service. Their waiters are always very attentive and quick to clear unneeded tableware/refill coffee and water. It does get a little pricey if you start to BYOB because they do charge a cork fee. We've easily paid $50 with tip for breakfast between the two of us, which is a little much to me, but the quality backs the price.  TL;DR: The best breakfast place in Brentwood area for sure, and definitely good enough to be within the top 10 for Pittsburgh. The next time you want a breakfast date, go here. You'll love it."}
{"text":"I went here for the second time this morning with my father for brunch. We had an enjoyable experience again. We had a hard time deciding what to get because the menu had such a nice variety. I decided on the Belgium waffle and turkey sausage. The waffle was really great but I wasn't crazy about the turkey sausage. It was way too spicy for me. Our waitress was very nice too. The place is small, but adorable and well kept."}
