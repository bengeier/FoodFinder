{"text":"My want is put 0 star but it is not possible 
Where is my dresser? Im waiting more than half hour today and more half yesterday to talk to anyone on the customer phone, but this is not a real customer phone
My order was to be here May 24 and today is jun 2 and nobody answer my, my email or whatever disapoint is less than my feeling about this trash company that have no customer services"}
{"text":"First time visiting this location. We ordered a kids bed and a few other things for pickup. Immediately, I liked that it was quieter than the larger stores.  Staff showed me what to do, were friendly and prompt (about 5 mins to bring it up). But if you did have to wait, there's a small retail selection to check out. Good experience."}
{"text":"We have had a good and bad experience at this location.  You simply cannot get through on their phone number...just rings busy.  However, we did order a buffet online and it was delivered there in no time.  But trying to get in touch with them via telephone is impossible, and if you contact their toll free number it does not give you the option of speaking with a live person.  IKEA as a 35 yr customer get your act together."}
{"text":"Horrible experience today.  Waited 20 minutes just to ask a simple question because there was only one sales person on the floor who was with another customer.  When she was finished I asked her if they had a certain pillow cover in stock.  This woman, Joanne, decided to give me a lesson in reading Ikea labels instead of just answering my question. She was hyper and sarcastic and I immediately reacted to her attitude and not in a good way.  If Ikea only has one person working the floor, which is ridiculous, they should at least have someone who has good customer relations and not someone who obviously did not want to be there.  Also, the store could be better organized in that if the pillow covers had all been in one place instead of randomly located all over the store, I may have not have needed to approach this miserable woman and ruined my day."}
