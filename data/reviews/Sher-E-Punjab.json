{"text":"Solid Indian food  We've been to Sher-E-Punjab twice now with friends, and I'd say that food has been consistently good. On our last visit, we ordered Vegetable and Meat samosas (very good), Butter Chicken (good, although not a favourite), Curry Lamb (would have liked more meat vs. bones), rice and naan. Surprisingly, the four of us were quite full. Portions appear small, but again are very filling.  The atmosphere is nice, nothing to write home about. The service was very attentive. Overall, a solid restaurant."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and service was good.  Food is fine, but not spectacular.  It is a good place to go if you are in the area, or are hanging out there, but it isn't a place I'd seek out."}
{"text":"Great Indian in a crowd of boring Greeks  Sher-e-Punjab serves reliable quality food and good service with many wonderful vegetarian options.  It is a regular stop for us."}
{"text":"Sher-E-Punjab is an underrated, somewhat upscale Indian restaurant on Toronto's Danforth strip. Recently renovated and re-opened for about 2 months now, this classic mainstay has been located at 351 Danforth Ave since the 1990s.  IMG_4375The Good: They make a mean cocktail with homemade chili-infused vodka that has marinated at least 4 hours. The beverage, mixed with lime juice, soda, and mint leaves, took a good ten minutes to make but was served with utmost care. A lot of time and effort went into making this drink, and it was probably the best alcoholic beverage I've had out in a while. The sizzling tikka ($13) came out super hot, with perfectly moist and spiced chicken paired with sizzling, crispy peppers and onions that had an ideal amount of crunch. The naan was a warm and comforting side dish as we sat in a comfortable booth looking out at quaint shops along the Danforth.  The Bad: Our favourite Indian dish and the cuisine's staple, butter chicken, was thoroughly delicious, but did not quite top of list as the best we've ever had. We think Eglinton's Mount Everest restaurant beats them on this dish marginally.  Overall: Sher-E-Punjab is an unexpected, yet delightful Indian dining experience. Though seemingly unassuming from the outside, its trendy atmosphere, delicious handcrafted cocktails, and the slow-cooked homestyle food is simply amazing. I don't give many places stellar reviews, but this is truly a hidden gem in Toronto's multi-cultural food scene.  The Crowd: Kind of dead on a Sunday evening at 8:30pm, but 3 other 30-something couples.  Pricing: $5-9 for appetizers, $6-11 for alcoholic beverages, and $9-13 for entrees, except for a $28 lamb chops dish  http://thegirlsonbloor.com"}
{"text":"Delicious and not nearly as greasy as the usual Indian fare. Was perfectly seasoned and not too heavy. Ordered the tikka masala, Chana masala and veggie samosas and all dishes were very well enjoyed. We will definitely be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Sher e Punjab is my new hidden gem. The staff are polite and knowledgable. The restaurant is neatly decorated according to their theme and the food is as exceptional as their location and their prices. I highly urge you to try this authentic dining experience because you will be blown away"}
{"text":"Loved it! I just moved into the neighbourhood while unpacking I decided to get takeout from this restaurant. I have pretty high standards for North Indian food considering my mum is a Indian chief! Service was great, took my order promptly, offered me the ability to pay cash/credit and the food arrived warm and quickly.   The food was not overly greasy and tasted amazing, the right spices and flavour. Saag Lamb - was great, lamb was tender and not too fatty. Chicken Jalfrezi - was done nicely with green peppers and chicken breast! I LOVE baratha - it my fav, I get it wherever I go and Sher-E-Punjab - you hit the mark.   As a Punjabi person myself - proud to say that this is truly authentic food."}
{"text":"This indian restaurant is a bit unexpected on the Danforth but I understand it's been here for many years. We've been frequenting it for a couple of years and really enjoy the food and the service.  The family business is well run and the service is warm and authentic. The food is well prepared and genuine. My faves are the Chicken Tikka Massala and the various curries. The Naan is my favourite. The restaurant is quite large so there's lots of room for large groups and if you're there early for dinner (with kids) you can get a great table up front with big window view of the Danforth for people watching. Like many local businesses, it's closed on Mondays and is more of a dinner than lunch place during the week."}
{"text":"The Butter Chicken, Malai Chicken Kebabs and Paneer Tikka are to die for! Definitely a great place for all lovers of Authentic Indian Cuisine"}
{"text":"The best pakoras ever...light, not cakey like some I've tried, and never greasy."}
{"text":"Best Indian food I've had in the city. We ordered the butter chicken, tandoori chicken, naan and samosas. All excellent and tasty. The mango lassi is also very good."}
{"text":"This is the best Indian restaurant experience in Toronto. The food is INCREDIBLE, the decor and atmosphere is extremely high-end and the staff are wonderful. The prices are exceptionally reasonable for the wonderful food quality. My favourite is the butter chicken, chicken tikka masala and paneer makhani (not on the menu, but they will make it if you ask).  After years of going to Sher-E-Punjab, we decided to have our wedding reception there. We booked out the restaurant for the evening and it was the most amazing time. The guests were served wine and appetizers during the cocktail hour and then we had table service for dinner. We met with the manager, Jaspal, beforehand to choose the dishes. He had a long list of avaiable items and we mixed and matched so our guests could have lots of variety. Our guests were blown away by how good the food was! We were so excited to finally show our out-of-town friends and family what a high-quality Indian restaurant was like. Jaspal was so easy to work with and was extremely accommodating. His main goal is to make you happy.  The servers were the sweetest, nicest, attentive people I have ever met. They were so on the ball and wanted to make sure everyone had what they needed. If a dish was getting low, they immediately brought out a new one. I cannot say enough good things about the service and the manager, Jaspal.  I highly recommend this restaurant for a lovely dinner anytime or if anyone wants to hold a private function. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I went here a few months back and loved it so much that we are now regulars at this place. It has amazing indian food, with even better service and staff. Extremely friendly and caring. They're butter chicken is amazing and mango lassi is to die for. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for some really good indian food with excellent service."}
{"text":"Indian again?   Yup indeed, I can never get sick of Indian food, so many spices, flavours, temperatures? and varieties to savour. One of my primary choices for take out. As you can likely tell from the multitude of Indian food reviews.   Anyhow, I was fortunate to have enjoyed a meal from Sher-E-Punjab the other evening and I can say they definitely have earned my repeat business. And I look forward to trying more dishes from their menu.  With a comment like that, why only 4 stars? Well, the only negative I have to offer is not enough rice. And really, it's quite the cheap staple, but the standard dish of curry was accompanied with a small serving of basmati rice, which left me with an above average serving of delicious curry sauce I was incapable of enjoying.  My order was Beef vindaloo, with basmati. It was about 15$ which is a fair price for a decent curry, and the spice was definitely right, chillies simmering in the sauce, just how it was meant to be. The dish contained an ample amount of beef cubes which were so tender, they flaked right apart with a fork. It was euphoria on a plate. I would have loved to finish the entire dish, but the inadequate serving of rice left approximately a cup of curry sauce I could not enjoy (not unless I took a completely primitive approach and picked up my dish and drank it)   Perhaps next time, I'll order two sides of rice, although it really should not be a necessary purchase based on how little the cost of rice, it would be easier if they were to just increase the portion size."}
{"text":"We tried their food a few weeks ago. Food was good. Loved he ambience. Very decent price. I loved the Daal Makhani. It was super good. Chicken tikka was also good.  I'll definitely go here again."}
{"text":"I have been going to Sher for the last few years for my Indian fix. We have always had a great experience dining in although this is my first time reviewing (after just enjoying our first take-out meal).  This is comfort food to the max - so rich, so much flavour and very generous portions. Tonight my wife and I got: 1 curry shrimp, 1 butter chicken, 1 palak paneer (spinach/broccoli/cheese) and 2 naan. We make our own rice at home.  Total cost with tax and tip was $50 and this will easily provide another meal or two for my wife and I.   Best Indian food around, great service, deserving of 5 stars."}
{"text":"Went in a Saturday 2 pm with whole family, as they only open at 2, friendly worker, sat us, indoor decor pretty eclectic pieces as well as memories of India, and picture frames, menu simple straight forward. Water and Papadum served, we ordered Appetizers :beef and veggie samosas (very big) main coarse Beef vindaloo spicy and extremely salty, ;butter chicken subtle still pretty ethnic not so \"blain\" ordered naan and white plain rice(very plain) ;paneer tikka tasted like fridge smell, and filled With food colouring. On sizzler but didn't feel it was cooked, cooked exterior Almost burned edges but motor inside. Would I go again, sure just order different meal."}
{"text":"Best Indian we've ever had. Had the samosas (veg & lamb), the chicken tikka masala & some sort of bread pudding for dessert - all phenomenal. Very reasonable prices & you get very generous portions. Great service & lovely decor. Can't recommend this place highly enough!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend was craving Indian Food around the Danforth area and I found Sher-E-Punjab! The food and service were beyond what we expected! We ordered lentil soup, Butter chicken, Sher-E Tandoori, chicken biryani, and naan! Everything was nice and fresh. The tandoori chicken exceeded my expectations with the perfect spice, flavour, and it wasn't dry at all! Loved it. The naan was so fluffy and tasty. I just wish the proportions can be a tad bit bigger for the butter chicken. Otherwise, excellent food. Service was immaculate with the servers being knowledgeable about the menu, being very attentive and friendly. I want to go back and try other delicious looking dishes on the menu."}
{"text":"Had delivery from here last night.  It took about an hour which is what I expected as this isn't pizza.  The delivery driver didn't have too much change on him so I ended up giving him a $5 tip. I had the seekh kabab, beef samosa, beef paratha, naan, and raita.  All of the food was bland.  The kabab tasted horrible, everything else lacked flavour.  However the naan was decent.  I've been to many Indian restaurants and being of that culture, have a niche for this type of food.  Believe me, this place needs a change in their cooking..."}
{"text":"We went here while on vacation on a Wednesday night. First off the decor was absolutely gorgeous nothing like other Indian restaurants. The server was great he made wonderful suggestions and was very pleasant. Now let's get down to business, the food was scrumptious we order traditional tandoori chicken, fried fish, chicken tikka and chicken tikka masala. Every thing was melt in your mouth good and cooked to perfection. Wish we had places like this in DC!"}
{"text":"Trip to this place had some highs and lows.  The service was friendly and I liked the atmosphere of the place.  And the vegetable pakora was truly exceptional (perfect texture, hot, and crispy) and I appreciated the generous portion of tamarind chutney.  I also loved how the tamarind chutney wasn't overly sweet but was rather tart and sour which for me is something quite good. The rest of the meal wasn't quite up to scratch though.  While the nan bread was great, the rice looked like it had been handled too much (too many of the grains were broken into small slightly gummy pieces).  The chicken jalfrezie tasted ok (a little too many cumin seeds for my taste though - and I like cumin too) but the shrimp curry was very disappointing (tasted like pieces of shrimp in mildly spiced ketchup sauce).  If you're in the area and are craving Indian food, Sher E Punjab is fine but I wouldn't go to this neighbourhood just for this place."}
{"text":"Best Indian food on the Danforth!! Biryani is good. Meat is a must!! Curry good perfectly!"}
{"text":"Eaten here a few times, the food is great especially the naan it's real and huge so if like me you normally order more than one there is really no need.  The paneer is great,  I've only eaten the vegetarian options but they are all amazing.  The service is quite good and the restaurant is beautiful."}
{"text":"Half the reason one goes out to a restaurant is for the ambiance, which includes the customer service. Customer service here is very poor. Staff is unsmiling, tries to hurry you out of the restaurant, and generally treats you with a level of disdain. Will prefer to go somewhere that is more leisurely, and does not try to market itself based on the painful history of 1857. Disgusting."}
{"text":"Came here a few weeks ago with my cousin during lunch time. Love the ambiance of the place! No tacky Indian decor whatsoever!!! Price was great and the food was pretty good. Had the Lamb kebab, tandoori chicken (half) and the pakora appetizer. Staff was also great with checking in on us as well!  Paid about $30 with the tip included for two. I'd say that's a good price."}
{"text":"I have eaten here numerous times and the food and service has always been great. This has to be the best or one of the best Indian restaurants in the city. Its very well designed and decorated and very clean.  It's a 2 minute walk from Chester Subway and Green P parking on Chester."}
{"text":"Love this place. Food is flavorful and fresh. Vindaloo has the right amount of heat. Aloo Gobi was perfect. Refreshing raita. And the naan was hot and fluffy. New decor is awesome. And the service was spot on. Nothing bad to say about the place."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery and it came on time. Food was pretty good. I'd give them another try and maybe go I to the restaurant next time to experience more of the atmosphere and service."}
{"text":"This is by far my favourite Indian food I've had in Toronto thus far.  It's reasonably priced and delicious!  I've only ever gotten delivery and I've never been to the restaurant for dine-in but the delivery is so fast!  Probably it helps that I live fairly close by, but it has shown up within 20 minutes every time we've ordered."}
{"text":"We went there on a Saturday night and it's been the best Indian food we have had so far in Toronto. Have tried a few places including some that were highly ranked on some websites.  We had the pakora, lentil soup, palak paneer, butter chicken, some naan and desert. All of it was delicious no doubt about that and the service and the interior of the restaurant were good, too.   We will go back there."}
{"text":"Indian food with a softer taste Beautifully decorated this 35 year old establishment, open for dinner only, definitely caters to mainly non-Indian origin client base. Being lighter on spices it surely is more acceptable to their base. For Example the fried starter dishes of pakoras and fish are done to perfection but do not carry the Chaat Masala condiment to wake up the taste. Menu is limited but still covers a large variety of Indian cuisine. Service by three young waiting staff, two boys and one girl supported by their manager, is to be appreciated. They were all on the go. Pricing is acceptable.  A good restaurant which would make your evening out an enjoyable one."}
{"text":"Full disclosure: I went to high school with the son of the family who owns this restaurant. That being said, if I didn't like this place, I just wouldn't review it at all.   But whether I know these people or not, I can confidently say that this is my favorite restaurant in the world. Yes, you read that correctly. Not my favorite INDIAN restaurant in the world, but my favorite OVERALL restaurant in the world. I can't get enough. The chicken tikka masala, the naan, the beef samosas, the pakoras - all unbelievable.   I moved out to Los Angeles a few years ago, and I miss this place dearly. Even more than I miss my family. Sher-e-Punjab - PLEASE, for the love of god, open a location here in Los Angeles? I'll be your best friend."}
{"text":"Came here with two friends who are avid Indian food lovers. We each picked a dish and shared - spinach paneer, lamb saag and black lentil daal. We also got chicken biryani as a side, papadum and naan (my friends have no gluten concerns). We started with vegetable pakoras, which were good flavour wise, however, seemed to be more dough than vegetables. The main dishes were all very different. The spinach paneer seem to be very bland, especially in comparison to the lamb saag and daal. We all enjoyed the chicken biryani. My friends said the naan was good and the papadum was good too. Service was quick and attentive. Overall, good dining experience.  I'm not sure I'll be racing back though. I think there are equally as good or potentially better Indian restaurant options in the city I need to check out."}
{"text":"The food was great at this place. Definitely worth trying if you are in the neighbourhood. The decoration is very modern and chic. The environment is cozy and clean!   We ordered:  Lamb saag, half tandoori chicken,  pakora and garlic naan. They are all flavourful and well prepared. The chicken can be marinated a bit more but it is still delicious. I'd give 5 stars to their portions.   The naan bread was very well baked with fresh garlic on top. They smelled wonderful. Probably the best naan I'd ever had."}
{"text":"Sher-E-Punjab is arguably Toronto's best North Indian restaurant. Unlike most Indian restaurants in North America - the ambience is sophisticated, modern, and trendy.  The owners certainly have refined taste which is evident from the outstanding décor of the restaurant.   Sher-E-Punjab serves traditional North Indian comfort food at very reasonable prices. The food was tasty, rich, and full of flavour. Highly recommend their Dal Makhani and Chicken Tikka. However, there is room for improvement. The chapatti had a very thick texture to it. A traditional chapatti is supposed to be light and fluffy - it was avoidable and unappetizing. The food also lacked spice to it - even though I requested the food to be medium spiced by Indian standards.   Service was friendly and inviting. Overall they've earned a solid 4 stars. Fix the breads and add some spice - and you've got yourself Toronto's best Indian restaurant!"}
{"text":"Lamb saag was excellent and butter chicken was average. Based on food alone, this place deserves 3.5 stars. However, they charged us separately for naan AND rice. I can understand them charging us for naan. Even some U.S. Restaurants do this. However, rice is part of the meal! Nobody eats butter chicken by itself. I wouldn't mind paying slightly more for the dish, but why do it in a round about, shady way? Instead of charging $12 for the dish and $3 for rice, why not make the meal $15? Shady shady."}
{"text":"Decent food with great atmosphere and service.. A lot better than other Indian places in Toronto..Definitely worth a shot.."}
{"text":"Food has been fantastic every time I've been here, although the mango salad is hit or miss (mostly hit though). All of the meat and curry dishes are phenomenal. Will go out of the way for it (although it is super close to Chester station, basically across the street from it). Staff is always friendly and the prices won't break your wallet, great value."}
{"text":"Firstly, the owners have created a really cozy and modern atmosphere to dine in. The service was prompt and they have a decent selection of wine and cocktails to pick from at very affordable prices. The food was to die for...we had paneer tikka, beef vindaloo, butter chicken, chana masala, fresh naan...deelish!"}
{"text":"If you have not been here since the renovation you are missing out on a gem. This place is awesome. The setting is amazing, the service is spectacular, the prices are reasonable, but best of all it is by far the best Indian food in the entire city. You have to eat here. And where else in this city can you get cheetah on tap? Amazing..."}
{"text":"Takeout from this place is great. I like a butter chicken - solid 4.5/5 and not too spicy but spicy enough with great flavour. The biryani has some good kick but again, not too much. Excellent naan.  Great raita. Overall super tasty- not quite Lahore Tikka but close enough."}
{"text":"Tried this place twice and have two different opionions.  Goat curry was good but the fish curry was saltier than a salt stick.  That is all."}
{"text":"I visited with my vegetarian sisters, so we had a meatless meal and it was totally delicious. The Palak Paneer is amazing, as are the pakoras. We also really enjoyed the Channa Masala and Aloo Gobi. With excellent prices, good service, and a comfortable decor, I'd totally recommend it and will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious food and great service. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I was very impressed with this restaurant. I went there with my girlfriend and we both really enjoyed the food. The restaurant is very nice inside and puts some of the old Greek places on the danforth to shame. I was also extremely shocked to see dinner for 2 for such a reasonable price. The service was also good and the waiters are very nice. I would definitely go there again next recommend it to everyone"}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant for a meetup.   Server was really nice and they agreed to seperate check, which is always a bonus!  You can have \"half-orders\" which is great to try different things and they serve an appetizer plater with mango chutney and some sort of bread (sorry don't know a lot about Indian food) for free!  I had a half-order of shrimp curry and a half-order of butter chicken. You have to order rice on the side, shame it is not included for me.  My rice arrived after my dish so I had to wait 5min to start eating. As we were a group of 28, maybe it is part of the problem. The food was really good and I'm not too fond of Indian food.   I usually cannot finish my plate in restaurants in Toronto but for this one, I finished it pretty easily so I'd say the portions were a bit small.   I couldn't really tell the difference between my two half-orders but I don't know. Again, might be cause of my lack of knowledge of Indian cuisine.  I would recommend this place! There is a patio, I like the decoration and the food is good."}
{"text":"My new job on this site should be to alert people as to when restaurants are closed lol. Last week I walked to Dukem in the freezing cold to find out they were closed until further notice. Today, I am finding out Sher-E-Punjab is closed as well. They are doing renovations until March 10. Other than that, I love this place."}
{"text":"Delicious and flavourful. Great take out. Highly recommended if you're looking for Indian food on the Danforth."}
{"text":"OK. Just OK.  Decent Indian food, decent ambiance, pretty good service.  The food is nothing to write home about, but it is not bad.  Whoever gives this restaurant 5 stars for food should venture beyond The Danforth (yes, I realize this is the best indian food on the Danforth, since it is the only one!).  The GTA has some amazing authentic indian food.    The Mulligatawny soup had only Dhaal in it and NO other vegetables (hellooo, cook?).  The vegetable pakoras were soaked in oil, dripping everywhere, and were mostly onions inside the batter.  The Saag Paneer used cheap Paneer (you could taste the difference, yes it is possible) and the Saag curry was pretty bland.  The Chicken Tikka Masala was probably the best of what we tried, but devoid of any subtle flavors - just tomato/curry taste.    The $3 pita side came with only 1 (one) piece and the $3 basamati rice side (curries come a-la-carte, with no rice or bread) was equally small and the rice was small-grained (read: cheap).  It seems that this place caters to the \"white people\" crowd who have no clue about authentic indian food (or have some weird ideas how 'they' want it to taste)"}
{"text":"Never disappoints.  I have been going here for 15 years and my parents have been going for 35 years.  The food is always fresh and flavourful and I have not had a bad meal yet.  The Pakora is a great appetizer to share and we always get the butter chicken, tikka masala and sizzling chicken.  We have taken our out of town guests here and they also were very impressed.  Unless I move away, I will also visit for 35 years."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the top Indian restaurants I've been to! The lentil soup was sooo yummy, the beef samosas are so fresh and to finish it all off a delicious warm rice pudding! Soo yummy! It is definitely a place to check out! It smells so amazing in here!"}
{"text":"Really good naan and curry. Word of advice: even if you get the mild curry the chillies they use are HOT. I learned the hard way by eating one thinking it was a green onion. Lol!"}
{"text":"This place is no improvement in my opinion. Went in thanksgiving there only a couple of tables and it took 35 minutes after I ordered.  If you are parking maybe not a good idea to go in and wait forever. The server are very patient with all my questions but I dont get it why it takes so long to prepare the food and it took  another 20 minutes to get me the bill so unpleasant. Had the lamb sagg/slow braised boneless lamb it's extremely salty"}
{"text":"We came here to try out Indian food and scout for places where we could possibly host a dinner party. After reviewing many many restaurants, we decided to try out Sher-e Punjab who had gotten good reviews. Walking in we could see a big party enjoying dinner a la family style. Good sign! Sitting down we were quickly approached by a server who offered us some water and menus.  After going through the menu we decided to start with samosas. One portion contained two samosas, we had one meat samosa and one veggie. The veggie samosa was way better than the meat one. It had a lot more flavour, felt like they forgot to season the meat one.   We followed this with an order of sizzling tikka chicken, paneer tikka masala and sizzling paneer. The first two were delicious, very flavorful! The last one sadly was very boring, dry and tasteless. With this we had plain naan, which was freshly made and very good. Included with any meal is papardom with chutney.  The portion size was good and we packed the left overs to go. Price was good for this, however let's talk about the bad things. First of all, as i mentioned previously we came here to talk to them to se whether we could have our dinner party here. However, we asked the waitress repetedly to talk to the manager and she kept saying he would come to us in a few minutes. He didn't! The whole dinner passed and we had to leave so we asked one last time upon which a young guy approached us. He was not the manager but took our contact info and promised the manager would call the next day. Let me tell you, he didn't! We kept calling and calling but never seemed to catch him. In the end we decided to have our dinner party at a different location. It does not seem to be in their interest to please possible future customers. I'm very disappointed!  To sum up, food is decent and so are the prices. However don't rely on them to help you out with a dinner party!"}
{"text":"17 happy customers. Good location for large family events. Very happy we came here. Food and service was excellent. Prices fair.  We look forward to coming back here again."}
{"text":"Amazing food and amazing staff.  Place looks amazing. Who would have thought Indian at the Danforth would be that good. Can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"I loved this place, ambiance is authentic and amazing, and food is awesome and HOT, I love it hot! Service was pretty good as well. I have tried some Indian restaurants in Toronto, and this one is the best so far:)"}
{"text":"Wow!  I have eaten a lot of Indian food but this is the best in Toronto on my opinion. Right in the middle of Greek-town. Traditional dishes with a bit of flair. Reasonably priced and very friendly service. Chicken Tikka is unreal."}
{"text":"The butter chicken was the perfect blend of subtle spice and creaminess. The samosas are huge and tasty. The portions were great, and the value was top shelf. Definitely will come back."}
{"text":"Went here on a risk, I'm snobby with Indian food and generally not a fan of what most Indian restaurants pretend is 'Indian' food. So, based on reviews I decided this restaurant was worth a shot. I was pleasantly surprised. The decor place was pleasant using earth tones, service was prompt and food was served quickly. We ordered the palak paneer and another dish. The naan was great (as with most places), the palak paneer and the other dish was good. Summary: Not a place that is a \"must go\" but if you are looking for decent north Indian food, Shere E Punjab fits the bill."}
{"text":"No complaints about this place! The atmosphere is very different from the Indian restaurants  I've been to before, but it is very comfortable nonetheless, not like an authentic Indian restaurant, but more like a Indian version of Milestones! Whether that is appealing to you or not, the food is fantastic, just as good if not better than other places we've tried.  We had chicken tikka and lamb vindaloo; both had ample portions of tender meat and delicious flavors. This would be a great place to take a date: Romantic atmosphere with dim lighting. Everything was well presented and the price was right. Very nice overall, clean and meticulous with friendly, attentive service."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery, and the food that arrived was inedible. I'm quite confused by all the positive reviews. Beef vindaloo consisted of large chunks of tough beef in a sauce that tasted of nothing but salt. It was so salty I could only have two bites before dumping the rest in the trash. I love Indian food, but the food here is awful."}
{"text":"It's a shame their decent food is marred by terrible service and overall management.  I recently moved into the area and was told by several people that this was the best Indian in the area. I decided to take my parents there for dinner based on these recommendations, and it was a mistake!  Initially the service was good if a little slow; it does not take 15 minutes to pour two glasses of wine and deliver them to a table. If only we had known...  We ordered three dishes, rice and naan. My stepmother explicitly asked for her Aloo Gobi to be mild as she can't stomach spicy food. My paneer and my dad's chicken were ordered at medium. And then we waited.  After a reasonable time, the sizzling platter of paneer arrived. Assuming the other dishes were right behind, I chose to wait and eat with my parents. The platter had gone cold by the time the Aloo gobi showed up, but then.... nothing. No chicken, no rice, no naan.  We asked three times. THREE. And that Aloo Gobi? Extra Spicy, to the point my stepmom couldn't eat it! Seriously.  Eventually the rice (steamed) and Naan trickled out to the table, but my dad's meal was straight up AWOL. Turns out the young server had forgotten to punch it in! Asking three times hadn't reminded her to check with the kitchen.  By the time it showed up, we were clearly very upset. And at the end of the meal, they just handed us a bill and said sorry. That's poor FOH management.   Why wasn't the server better trained? If she was junior, why were there no managers on the floor? Why didn't the expediter in the kitchen catch the fact there were three covers but only two entrees? And why didn't they do anything to make up for the fact they completely ruined the experience? I have no problem paying for the food we ate, I have a problem with management not doing a damn thing to rectify their obvious mistakes.  Needless to say I'm not going there again. In fact, I had Indian a few days ago, but I went all the over to Banjara to go get it."}
{"text":"Best Indian food in Toronto. Definitely my favorite restaurant overall. You have the option to do half orders so you can try a little bit of everything. They have great vegetation options. But I'm a carnivore. On the list of of delicious things I can highly recommend are the samosas, mulligatawny soup, garlic naan, bryani rice, shrimp curry, and their spicy Caesar cocktail. The spicy beef vindaloo is my absolute favorite. The pieces of meat are large and and fall apart with a fork. Lamb saag is fresh and full of spinach and curry flavor. Their butter chicken is the best I've ever had. The chicken is well marinated, the sauce is creamy, a little bit sweet and spicy. You just have to try this place you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Delicious lighter home-style food which is really refreshing in what is normally an overly greasy, heavy Indian food landscape.   The chicken tikka was really tasty. Only complaint is some of the chicken pieces were a bit mushy (over-marinating?).  Bharta was nice and smoky and tasty.   Saag paneer was particularly yummy with a mix of spinach and other more bitter greens to give it a bit more flavour. And thankfully it was light and fresh tasting.   Daal was wonderful too, though was a yellow daal substitute for the black daal on the menu. No complaints though: it was delicious.   Breads were nicely done too.  Pakoras very good to start and nice homemade tasting tamarind sauce.   Rice pudding was so wonderfully lightly sweetened and relatively thin. No cloyingly sweet glop here!  Overall, I was really happy with the meal and good value compared to others!"}
{"text":"We ordered in - the food was amazing with the perfect amount of heat. We've subsequently ordered in a couple more times.  My favorites are the Palak paneer, Daal & Bhartha.The raita is great too."}
{"text":"I was there for dinner yesterday and we had a lentil dish and a lamb dish. When it was added to the two appetizers and the papa poppadoms there was so much food we couldn't finish it all.  I was also given some kind of yogurt mango drink that was just incredibly wonderful. I would definitely have that again  A glass of chardonnay and fabulous company was all I needed for a perfect experience.  I will definitely be back"}
