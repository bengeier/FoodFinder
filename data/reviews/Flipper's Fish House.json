{"text":"It was a family tradition to come here all the time with my dad,mom, &sister when i was growing up.. I remember how great the food was and how excited i was to come here.. after I lost my father we stopped going and sort of forgot about this place.. after YEARSSSS of not going I went yesterday with my mom, and i was so amazed at how identical it was.. not one thing changed.. not to sound like a sob story but I felt like a little girl again when the waitresses were just as sweet and the food was exactly the same as  it was growing up.. thank you for not changing a thing"}
{"text":"Nice little spot in the borough I frequent with my dad

The Snapper grilled on the open flame is something we continue to come back for, full of flavour and cooked to perfection

Each meal also comes with an open salad bar so you can munch while you wait for your entree

Recommended eats if you like tasty whole fish"}
{"text":"This is probably the best place in Scarborough to go for seafood. Especially if you don't really like seafood. My son and hubby love it!  Food has very generous serving and I love the rice. Just like Oma makes ( I am Oma). The decor is dated but I don't mind. And I don't have to watch skinny waitress showing their everything which seems to be the trend in most of the chain places.  I do wish they would carry more deserts. And don't sit near the front. You smell stale smoke from all the smokers congregating around the front door."}
{"text":"I went to Flipper's for a banquet that my school was hosting. The banquet hall itself was located down many flights of stairs, underneath the actual restaurant. It's a fairly large space, however the wall decorations (large pictures of mermaids etc.) were a bit distasteful. 

The food was served buffet style. I got a greek salad, clicken (breast?), potatoes, carrots and string beans. There was also some bread and butter available at the table. Standard banquet hall food. My complaint is that everything was very dry. When the chicken was first served, it was okay but soon enough it dried out along with the vegetables. Perhaps the quality had to suffer because there were a lot of guests that needed to be served."}
{"text":"Really cool fishing boat theme. 
Super friendly and quick service.
Went during lunch on a Friday and the place was pretty empty. Probably a total of four tables being served including myself. 

Seafood platter $15.95 - comes with two different fish I think, scallops and shrimps with a side of rice, potatoes and veggies. The veggies were steamed and seemed like the ones you get frozen. The carrots texture was like rubber. The fish were grilled and drenched in a buttery garlic flavour. I don't find the fish that fresh as some pieces had a fishy flavour. The potatoes were in the shape of balls and a bit smaller than ping pong balls. They tasted good topped with tartar sauce. 

Halibut special$16.95 - This was not on the menu but located on a board at the back of the restaurant. You get the same rice, potatoes and veggies mentioned above but you also have a choice of the soup of the day or salad which you can get from their salad bar. I went with the soup of the day which was beef barley soup. It was really flavourful and had rice shaped noodles with some beef chunks. It went well with the complementary bread. 

Being a seafood restaurant I was really expecting more from the fish but it fell below expectations."}
