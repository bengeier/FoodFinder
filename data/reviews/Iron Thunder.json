{"text":"Only reason for the 2 stars is because i came here before and service was great as well as the food! Came here tonight and the food again was good but!!!....we asked for lemon cake and wings to go, and my hubby ended up in the er because what he thought was lemon cake was actually almond! And our winds were full of blood i have pics but cannot post. Called bk to let management know and she hung up on me...called bk to speak with general manager and she said she was general manager explained what happened and she said \"well there is nothing i can do\", and hung up again! It is a shame when u have a solid restaurant locally and it is poorly managed by incompetent people....hannah will def give this business a bad name with her poorly put together uniform and poor management skills...well and our friends will not come bk to very under cooked food and management with people or customer service skills.."}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant for the first time and was shocked by the skimpy outfits the girls had to wear. Made me feel embarassed for them. Definetly won't be taking my grand kids there. Its a shame since the food was really good."}
{"text":"Im surprised there are only 3 reviews for Iron Thunder.   I have been here about 6 times since it opened. (All for lunch I believe).   Every time I visit, everyone is friendly....service is good (usually very prompt) and most importantly, food is always great.  Very consistent.  Not sure where this place gets their chicken from but the chicken sandwiches are enormous!!  Even the amount of chicken they pit on their salads is huge.  Also, the chicken tastes great. Never tough.  I would highly recommend this place for lunch and/or dinner!"}
{"text":"I went to this place when it first opened and I was impressed. I enjoyed the food and it came out around 20m after ordering. The girls were new of course but they were nice and we didn't have to wait to order. I do want to note that the outifits the girls wear are not skimpy unless they have a theme night. They just wear a t-shirt and shorts. After eating I played billards with my friends, $1 a game. It was a good time."}
{"text":"Love this place. Food is great and not to expensive. Service is EXCELLENT. If you get Felicity or Stephanie. They're the best. So young, but the service they give is better than most twice their age. Keep up the good work ladies."}
{"text":"First time. Called in for some wings. Wings are pretty good.Wings were ready when I got there. That's a plus. Was only about ten other people in the place. All guys except for one \"woman\"..all the others were waitresses. Must have been pajama night. They were in there night gowns. What Was left of them. Bartender was in a pair on daisy dukes that was about 2 sizes small and her wife beater was about to bust out. The guys and \"woman\"shooting pool was loud and about drunk. All and all not the place to take the wife and chaps. But if you want some cold beer hot wings and cheap looking redneck girls. Come on. I'll stick to take out. Three stars are for wings and friendly service."}
{"text":"My first one star ever. My wife and I stopped in for lunch hoping  for a good new sports bar resturant in town. we walked in and found a table and sat down. It was not very busy and as we looked around it looked like the kind of place we really enjoy. We Sat and waited and waited while servers walked right by us like our table was empty. After 15 minutes of being ignored we left."}
{"text":"Don't even waste your time here. We sat there for 15 minutes waiting for the waitress to take our order. Then we sat there another hour waiting for food that never came. The acting manager that day thought it was amusing and offered no real apology. The assistant manager finally came by trying to get us to stay but at that point it was  way too late. In a way I am kinda glad because our waitress kept picking her pants out of her ass. I don't know why the feel they have to dress waitresses in ill fitting uniforms. I also heard the food is not that great so I will just drive on by to the next restaurant I see and not waste my time at the Iron Dud."}
{"text":"This post is based 95% on service. Our food was very tasty for the most part minus the mac and cheese which was very greasy, we were literally pouring oil out of the cup it came in. My buffalo chicken sandwich tasted great despite coming with lettuce and tomato a requested be left off. What upset me the most though was the nearly 10 minutes my drink was empty. I understand being a server you can get busy and have trouble getting  to everyone  but my server was sitting down enjoying her lunch while I was hoping to get a refill to wash down my sandwich with burnout sauce. I have had good experiences at this restaurant that's the only reason I gave two stars but today was not one of them. I will give it one more try and hopefully the service will be better."}
