{"text":"Try Sangak and Barbari. I know this place for two years. They have got better and better.   They also have a small grocery store."}
{"text":"This is just based on the fact that they stated they were open and I drove over the the bakery and they were closed. I called to see what happened and the guy answered and said they closed 2 hours early because they were slow.   Call until you get someone to make sure they are open...I would love to try to eat there and I will adjust it once I have it but it would be nice if they honored their hours of operations."}
{"text":"We just happened to be in the neighborhood and got a whiff of the bread (smelled awesome) and decided to go in. We've never had Persian bread before, so we asked the nice woman behind the counter and she recommended a VERY long flatbread. It was piping hot and ridiculously cheap ($2.50). We got home and ate half of it in about 5 minutes. It was delicious! Toasty sesame seeds and flavorful toasted crust with a surprisingly moist and chewy interior. Absolutely delighted with the bakery and look forward to returning and trying many of the other offerings they have available."}
{"text":"Barbari! Barbari! Barbari! They don't start making until 4pm but so worth the wait! I normally prefer sangak (especially in Iran) but the barbari here steals the show!!! So nice to get fresh bread daily!  We come home and cut into bread size (toaster size) pieces and put in the fridge. They are both perfect toasted! Trust me....get the barbari hot at 4pm & you'll have a hard time getting it home! Yum!! So glad they opened!!!"}
{"text":"Good super market with fresh breads, clean and friendly staff, I strongly recommend this place to every one."}
{"text":"My Favorite shop in the whole Las Vegas! Yes, I'm Iranian and I can't leave without my Sankgak! You have got to toast a sangak in the morning to understand my pain!"}
{"text":"I honestly have nothing to compare it to as I have never had barbari or sangak bread before. I came around 6:30pm and the barbari bread was so delicious and hot. It had toasted sesame seeds. The sangak was warm as well which had a chewier thinner texture. If I had to choose between the 2, the barbari would win it for me. The portions are big and it sure is a bang for your buck. I toasted some this morning, put a little jam on it and had it with my coffee. I will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"I happened to see the sign for this new Persian bakery on Flamingo as I was heading east.  I made a mental note to stop on the way home.  It was late afternoon and much of their sweets were gone except for baqlava, the way it's spelled here.  They sell it by the pound and I asked if I could get a half pound.  The answer was yes and that was what I got.  The half pound came to 6 bite sized cubes of rich pastry topped with pistachio.  The cubes are soft and have a great honey flavor but they are not dripping with honey.  You can pick them up and eat them as they are.  The baqlava are very good.  While waiting, I watched a man making some sangak bread, something of which I'd never heard.  The bread is a long piece of dough--perhaps 3 feet in length with holes in the dough.  The worker was stretching the dough much like pizza dough and then he put it on a griddle to brown.  As I was leaving, a gentleman asked me if I'd ever tried the bread.  When I said no that it was so large for one person, he told me to try it sometime.  Freeze it and then cut off what you want to eat and toast it.  Delicious, he assured me.  Next time when I'm near, I'll stop and get one and I'll take his advice.    Everything was A-OK with my visit.  Perhaps I can up it a star after I try the bread and some other pastries if I get there earlier in  the day."}
{"text":"I always stop by here to buy fresh Persian bread the staff is super nice and friendly. If you are in a area and want to get some authentic Persian bread, then this is the place to go.  They also have a market that you can buy Persian items from.   Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Discovered this not too long ago. Sanghak is freshly made and delicious. The baklava made here is simply fabulous."}
{"text":"Amazing!   We happened to be driving by and decided to walk in because I've never heard of the bread that they were advertising.   Boy am I glad we did this.   The sangak bread is absolutely fabulous.  I mean this bread is so delicious.   We got an older one and a fresh out the oven one.   Obviously the fresh one was outstanding but even the older one was excellent.  We also got barbari bread which is also pretty darn good (even if we got the day old stuff.)  The little grocery store is nice too with interesting items, some I've never seen before.   The most important thing is the service.   The first time we came in I had no idea what I was looking at.   Everything was explained to me and we even got to try before buying.  When we came in a few days later to buy we were also given more information.   I really appreciate that they were so honest as well about how old the bread is and when to come in.   Give this place a try.  Don't be intimidated because everyone who works here is friendly and they want you to try their bread.   And the bread is incredible!!!"}
