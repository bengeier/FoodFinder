{"text":"Exceptional Company & Wonderful Customer Service!!  I would highly suggest them to anyone and will be calling on them again"}
{"text":"So.........I'm a total lazy introvert... I don't like driving, going to restaurants (unless I'm really, really in the mood) or dealing with people any more than I have to.  When I lived in another state, I used a service just like Delicious Deliveries, so I actually searched for them as soon as I moved here so I could continue having the convenience.  I order about once every week or two, and I do use coupons whenever they apply to my order to make it more affordable (there are always coupons on their website).   So it works out that ordering from DD is almost the same as ordering in pizza, though I do tend to tip DD drivers a little extra because they have to drive across a much bigger delivery area than most restaurants cover.  For the service - I always order online, it's easier because my cell phone doesn't have great sound quality.  I like that you can put in detailed instructions both for the food items individually and the order as a whole - I'm a picky eater and some pizza delivery websites I've been on do not let you put directions in for the individual food items, so they mess up and miss my directions.  Not with DD, they get it right on each item.  I can put in complicated directions too, because my apartment is a beast to find.  I've never had any problems with the customer service.  The drivers are great, they make sure my food is correct, and they separate the cold and hot items (which I've had pizza places not do... ick!!!)   On the few occasions something is made incorrectly by a restaurant, DD has been really helpful and quick to make it right.  They always give an accurate time up front when the order is placed so you know what to expect and I usually have my food within an hour.  For the type of business they do, I can totally live with that ... unlike a certain \"freaky fast\" restaurant that regularly takes over an hour to get my sandwiches to me.    I love the selection.  Sushi, steak, burgers, thai, italian, local family owned restaurants and big chains side by side.  They even have *healthy* food that can be delivered... which is probably my favorite thing ever.  LOVE being able to have Pita Jungle & Picazzos delivered."}
{"text":"I mean really, who doesn't like to have dinner delivered to them!!! We absolutely LOVE ordering from Delicious Deliveries! Our food arrives on times and the drivers are so sweet!"}
{"text":"The company I work for has ordered from Delicious Deliveries for quite some time, and their quality, time management and customer service has gone out the window.  We generally order for meetings, and allow 15 minutes of wiggle room between delivery time and when the meeting is going to start.  For the last few months EVERY delivery is late.  They pretend that its ok because they call (an hour or more sometimes) after we place the order to tell us it's going to be late, but when a company has definite timelines about when the food needs to be delivered it is not ok.  We have already spoken to management, and they \"put a note in our file to tell the deliveries to be on time\".  It has gotten us nowhere.  When we tell them that we need the food for the time we placed the order for, and not when they change the time to they say 'sorry', and 'they wish they could get it to us on time'.  If you want to order food and don't care about what time it is delivered, then it is a good service.  For us, we have to stop using them since we cant ever guarantee when the food will be delivered in time."}
{"text":"Oh Delicious Deliveries! You steal my wallet, yet fill me with a complete meal and the bonus side- I can stay in my pajamas. For those of you who don't know- the idea is simple. Hit the DD website, type in your zip code, and up pops a list of restaurants to order from. The brilliance? Not all are Chinese takeaway, Jimmy Johns, or Pizza! The ultimate easiness for the nights we're lazy, don't want to cook, or just plain and simple don't want to get in the car and drive (or the times we don't want to deal with people). But I digress.. Click some buttons, send in your order, and wait for the phone call. The call is just to reiterate your order is correct and make sure you get the correct pricing.   Ah, pricing. Yeah, I won't lie.. This is expensive. For most places, there is a 20- minimum charge and it must be at the restaurant- the tax isn't included, the delivery fee isn't included, it must be 20 on salads, soups, entr√©e(s), in any order, in any combo you'd like. Delivery charge from what I've seen has been between 6-8 dollars.  I've had the same driver multiple times and bonus points to him for dealing with my loud-yet-tiny pug who thinks she's a macho guard dog. I don't know his name, but he doesn't blink an eye.  The wait? Eh, been usually about an hour. I don't know if I can peg that on DD though- I mean first they have to place the order, then it need to be prepared, then it has to be picked up, then delivered.. Since you need a minimum of 20 dollars worth of items, it's more to prepare than one sandwich and you're good to go!  I personally love this concept for the lazy times. Try it. Same food from the places you know and are familiar with in the comfort of your own home- where you can eat in any outfit you desire."}
{"text":"I have this thing about eating ribs, I unno if ya'll know this or not - but I can't eat BBQ Ribs infront of just ANYbody, I need some privacy to hide all the shame and Delicious Deliveries helps me with this!  A few clicks here and there and your meal is on its way. They have a wide variety of places on its roaster, however - I think they could be a lil more willing to travel, I live off of McClintock & Broadway and Camelback & Scottsdale isn't THAT far! There's a chinese place I often order from in Guadalupe and they still deliver! But back to the DD...  I like that the website is easy to navigate and that they do allow for nearly ANY substutition and give plenty of options in ordering. You can even have several orders with different methods of payment in one delivery! Huge Plus!  I have waited a while though - an hour and a half was the longest I've waited with 50mins the average. They have these huge insulated carriers that keeps everything nice and warm. They do give you a call to make sure your order is correct, another plus.   I would recommend this for office parties/meetings and of course the shamful indulgence that MUST be feasted on in private... like me and my BBQ Ribs!"}
{"text":"Had some trouble with my delivery, called their corporate offices and was given amazing customer service.  The CEO called me to follow up and called again after I placed another order just to make sure it was ok.  I'm very impressed this the management."}
{"text":"The whole office ordered lunch & delivery through Delicious Deliveries today. We had a quick delivery time (little under 30 minutes) & a personable driver. Food was fresh & tasty! Great experience, only downside was I did not like sauce on my burger. Not their fault though!"}
{"text":"Rude person on the phone. Incorrect times. food late. I will never every use this service again!"}
{"text":"I have ordered Delicious Deliveries for 3 years now and I'm very impressed with their service.  I have ordered from Chili's, Applebees, Teakwood's, Claim Jumper, Marie Callender's, Subway, BJ's Restaurant, Tropical Smoothie, Macayo's, Garcia's, Buca Di Beppo and California Pizza Kitchen.  I've never had bad service and the food was nice & hot and in sturdy containers.  Our delivery times was anywhere from 60-90 minutes.  They always tell you in advance the delivery time so you are not caught off guard.If there is a downside, it's the flux of the delivery service fee.  I notice in the evenings it's $5.99 but during the day it's $8.99.  Plus you add a 3% charge on using a credit card and tax and tip you could easily be looking at an additional $20 to your bill beside what you pay for the food.  I understand it's a service and they need to make money too but the extra $20 in fees and what have you, I just order maybe once a month as a splurge.  I would love to order more often if the fees came down.  It's a great service if you don't want to wait for a table or the hassle of going out.  I love the fact that you can have anything from Mexican food, burgers, fries, soups, salads or a full dinner and dessert delivered to your door.  You can only tolerate pizza or Chinese food for so long.  I would recommend DD to anyone and you should try it once or twice."}
{"text":"as I was thinking about getting something delivered tonight I remembered Delicious Deliveries! tonight I don't really feel like spending the money but wanted to yelp about all of the times I have used this service.   they are awesome.   You can select from a variety of many local restaurants to have delivered to your house. it is a bit pricey but sometimes it is just worth it. I have personally ordered over a dozen times.   ask for coupons, a lot of times you can get a free appetizer or dessert which pays for the delivery cost and then you don't feel so bad ordering $40 of delivery.   there was one time when I ordered one of my favorite caesar salads (cheesecake factory) and when it was delivered it was NOT caesar dressing but watery milk w pepper flakes or something really nasty and not edible. I called to see about getting my money back and they gave me a pretty hard time. they tried saying he would refund me for the lettuce part but not the chicken part or something really strange unless cheesecake factory agreed to refund them.   it got silent on the phone because i guess he expected me to be satisfied with refunded lettuce so i was like \".....do you want me to call cheesecake factory and ask then.................?\"  he realized i was fiesty and not giving up until i got what i wanted and lets be honest, deserved- i wouldn't pay for a watery milk salad w pepper flakes anywhere!   so they eventually took care of it after forcing me to be difficult.   but that is literally the only problem I have ever had with the many, many times I have used their services and is really not a big deal and i will totally be using them again when im so lazy that im willing to be a bit spendy."}
{"text":"Sunday at 4:30pm I ordered 1 small pizza, caesar salad, 1 pasta entree from Nicks restaurant, 2 miles from my house.  Delicious Deliveries took the order and gave me a total of $55.97.  Wow that seemed a lot for a 2 person order so I asked if the delivery fee and driver tip were included.  Yes it was, 15% automatically included for driver.  What they didn't mention is the charges include a delivery fee $8, convenience fee $2.15, plus, driver 15% is on top of and INCLUDING those two convenience and delivery fees!     So it continued......    And it will be there in 75-90 minutes.  Huh?  Even on a Sunday evening at 4:30pm?  Yep.  Typical delivery time I was told.  Delicious Delivery places \"orders\" when driver is on his way to pick up from restaurant.   Got order hot in 70 minutes. I signed a generic receipt with credit card for $55.97 (no detailed receipt included, or I would have balked at the double dipping of up charges).  I blame the driver, not Nick's, for not ensuring I got utensils, napkins, and no butter for the bread.  Isn't that the delivery drivers job & why he gets tipped?  I received none of these yet I still had to pay the 15% driver tip whether he deserved it or not.  Interestingly they emailed the detailed receipt later, which showed these high charges.   In other words, for my $36 order I tacked on 50% surcharge for delivery.  Next time I will pick up my own order in less than 20 minutes, 40-50 minutes quicker than delivery, and save $17.16, the price of another 1-2 entrees!"}
{"text":"I have had multiple times where information given to me was incorrect, financial discrepancies (extra money taken from my account which had to be addressed) and once was spoken rude to by an employee who thought he was calling the business (not myself, the customer). All this plus a 10$ delivery fee. I gave them three tries, this will be my last. I hate leaving poor reviews, but this company is sketchy and poorly managed. It's unfortunate, because they provide better delivery options than other delivery companies, but it's honestly not worth it."}
{"text":"Fantastic concept, food and service!! Perfect for those times when you are SO hungry, but too lazy to cook (or no food in the fridge) and you don't want to go sit in a restaurant. They've got a variety of restaurants, and the selection changes based on your zip code. I've personally ordered from Delicious Deliveries at least once a month for over a year and I've never had a problem! Food always arrives within the timeframe they give, and it's always hot and fresh.   Before you order, check on their website for a coupon! Sometimes they'll do free delivery or a free appetizer from certain restaurants. You can order on their website, on the phone, and now they even have an app!   Stop ordering pizza and Chinese food. Treat yourself - you deserve it!!! Thanks for feeding me, Delicious Deliveries!"}
{"text":"I love the idea of getting specific restaurants delivered. Something other than pizzas and Chinese. I'm not a fan of waiting over 2 hours and then getting the food cold. We've ordered from Delicious Deliveries since they opened, they used to be fast 30-45 minutes and slowly and slowly the times then became 45-60 and 60-90. Then when you call them and ask where your order is they actually have an attitude with you. This is poor service. I don't think I'll be ordering again because ordering at 5:30 pm and it arriving at 8 is unacceptable by all standards of business."}
{"text":"This is a GREAT service! We discovered this service when we first moved to Arizona 8 years ago since then we've been loyal customers. It's a great option if you don't want to go out to dinner.   Yes, we've had a few bad experiences over the years but they are always nice enough to give us a coupon in the mail to make up for the bad experience. In certain cases we've even gotten refunds due to a resturant making a mistake in a meal here or there.   If you like resturant food but don't always like to go out for the resturant food then this a great option for you! Our household really does depend on this service a lot and its a great service overall even though its a bit pricey it is still a nice little luxary to have."}
{"text":"Love love love love Delicious Deliveries. Love. I've used them for 4 years. They are prompt, polite, and my order is always correct. I love that they bag the cold items (salads, drinks etc) separate from the hot. I love that I get utensils, plates, condiments, anything I ask for. As a single, and extremely busy, woman I appreciate being able to get pretty much any food I want while never having to pry my fingers off of my work laptop at home. Were it not for them, I would have starved to death by now.  These guys are the best, give them a try!"}
{"text":"this service is great for whenever you're feeling like delivery and you don't want pizza.  i order from them maybe once a month (usually from los olivos) and am always pleased with their service.  the food arrives hot and if something isn't right, they'll go out of their way to fix it.   with the delivery prices and the tip, it can get a little expensive, but it's still a totally fun service to use.  my only real gripe is that i wish they had more restaurant options; they've had the same places for a super long time."}
{"text":"This is pricey. Really pricey. However, the businesses they can bring to your door! Its like having a new place to get take out from every time!   My friends and i have returned to this option a number of times, usually when everyone is confident of having the money to pay for what they'd like. The most difficult part is getting everyone to decide on a place. They could not do split orders amongst various restaurants. Which is understandable but can be frustrating when one person is dead set on Thai and another wants Tex-Mex.   Soda prices are incredibly high. Apparently the driver stops by Circle K (or other store) and purchases the drinks out of pocket. It is understandable that they'd want to get reimbursed, but the prices are so much.   Nonetheless, every once in a while, it is the perfect choice. Especially when pizza and sandwiches have become unpalatable because you see the delivery guy elsewhere and think he's a friend...until you realize why you recognize him!"}
{"text":"SO slow!! It took over an hour and a half for them to deliver our food and when we called to see where our order was we had to wait on hold for over 5 minutes. Finally, to pay with a credit card the person delivering had to write down my credit card information on paper...."}
{"text":"I too am a fan of Delicious Deliveries......But......I just noticed that they have upped their delivery charges to $9.00. Sorry DD you have just priced yourself out for me. And \"methinks not\" is why they got one star. BTW We have used them for 3 years and I always overtip, but at 9 bucks for delivery....nope, there are others."}
{"text":"The only reason they got 1 star was cuz you HAD to give 1.  This business LOST over a $50 bill because the letters on my Credit Card aren't raised! I couldn't believe it! They could've RUN the card right there before the order even went in. All the driver has to do's verify the numbers are the same and my ID and they'd have another $50. Are their drivers THAT incompetent they can't verify the numbers? Instead they saved me a BUTTLOAD of money cuz I kept my money local.  Offered the exact same thing from Biscuits in Ahwatukee. Saved me over $30... and the food was even warmer I'm sure! I'll NEVER even TRY to use this service again. They're way overpriced, but I was willing to pay cuz I was LAZY today. Thanks DD you saved me money!"}
{"text":"My new choice for 3rd party delivery. Minimums and fees are rather high, but the service is excellent.  - Website is easy to navigate - I like multitude of choices - The office promptly makes phone calls to communicate changes to orders - Charges are easily corrected for restaurant errors - Food is delivered professionally - Operation runs smoothly from customer point of view  I wish them success in growing the business."}
{"text":"This is really a great option when you just don't feel like going out. I used to use \"Steaks R' Us\" (now closed) when I lived in Tempe, and craved something other than Pizza or Chinese food. I was frustrated that nobody had opened a similar steak-delivery-restaurant in Scottsdale. However, to my delight, I recently discovered \"Delicious Deliveries\" and they have restored my faith in humanity. They offer delivery from dozens of restaurants to satisfy any craving, fair pricing, and it's at your door in about an hour. Bravo!  Check it out here: http://www.azfood.com/"}
{"text":"I absolutely love Delicious Deliveries. The website makes ordering very easy, and show's you which resturants are in your area based on zip code. We use them both at the office, and I use them at home.   I've ordered from them a number of times, and my food has always been hot."}
