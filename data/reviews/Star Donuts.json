{"text":"We were excited to give this shop a try based on the reviews. We went in on a Sunday morning about 10:30 and there was about 4 other customers in the store. They had maybe about half a dozen doughnuts in the case. We left without any. I don't understand why these shops don't keep their cases stocked"}
{"text":"Cute lil donut shop with friendly people. Donuts are not the best, some in my half dozen tasted a bit stale, but overall, a good place to get your donut fix. (o:"}
{"text":"This place was nice. From the very warm customer service to the taste of their items.   It's hard to see off the road a bit, but worth trying. My family usually goes to a local store to pick up donuts and I have to say, we won't be going back to the other stores when we get in our donut fix anymore.   There is a list of smoothies on the wall which are great! My kids loved the ham and cheese croissant! They were light and fluffy and tasted great!  The glazed donuts reminded me of a Fresh warm Krispy Kreme donut, but not as sweet. They were well balanced and very fresh. Compared to the other places we've tried in the area, this trumps them. They don't have a huge selection of donuts, but the taste and quality more than make up for it.   If you can stop by and try them out, the price is reasonable and will be worth the trip.  You'll be glad you did it!"}
{"text":"Great fresh donuts. The cinnamon rolls are so light and delicious! The owners are friendly and really appreciate repeat customers.  Come on Surprise,  support these guys!"}
{"text":"Finally a real donut shop in Surprise! All fresh and taste delicious - get there early for the best selection."}
{"text":"Hot, fresh, and homemade! Get there early to get them piping hot from the oven! Best donuts I have had in a dozen years! The stuffed croissants with jalape√±o are a must!"}
{"text":"I dont often eat doughnuts but when i do its from here ! There doughnuts are by far the vest ive tasted and i am quite the doughnut fanatic as well as a workout feend! Lol anyways they were nice as always and ill be back"}
{"text":"Great, traditional donut shop with broad assortment, wonderful tasting product, and very welcoming customer service.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Very, very good donuts.  Very good prices.  Fresh and satisfying!  I will be a regular customer."}
{"text":"We're very happy to have a new Boba place in town!   I have been here twice. The first time I was disappointed because the donut selection was so small and basic. It could hardly compete with two Dunkin Donuts and various grocery store bakeries in sick a small area, right?  The boba was good. The donut was okay. I returned a week later with some school kids and treated them to drinks and snacks. Because I knew what to expect, it wasn't disappointing. I appreciated the simple selection and the cheerful service.   The place has grown on me and I hope it starts introducing more variety and more fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"So I had a craving for some deep fried sugary goodness and stopped at this place on a whim. I only got a maple bar and a crumb donut. Maybe I'm a donut snob but the maple bar just didn't have enough frosting and the donut was a little dense. The crumb topping was good but again donut a little dense for my liking. I will give them another try and order a variety."}
{"text":"Best donut place in the West Valley (& probably all of AZ. Just saying).  Donuts are always fresh and yummy.  Boba drinks are super tasty & the boba isn't frozen like other places. Staff is friendly, courteous & honest.  Plus, I've tried a lot of donut places looking for \"the one\".  FINALLY found it & family that visit from out of town completely after too. Thanks Star Donuts!!!  Keep up the great work.   P.S. Facility AND bathroom is always clean.  I"}
{"text":"The best donut an boba shop hands down!!!!!!! Perfect service, donuts always fresh, and boba is delicious! Thank you star donut"}
{"text":"This place made me a donut lover!! Not sure if that's a good thing for my waistline, but it's true. Favorites include: glazed lemon filled, glazed, chocolate glazed, bear claw, and their danishes. Don't forget to grab a tai iced tea--I recommend the black milk tea. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I was in there today and the young girl that worked there came out crying and I asked if she was okay and she said I just got fired. Her name is Stephanie, such a sweet girl.. GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE!!! Much better then the owner. The owner treated her like crap, would get mad at her for helping... I feel so bad for her. She's a young single mom. Good Luck young lady. I gave her my number so if she needed a personal reference I would do that for her. I'll never go back to this donut shop"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. Only 7.99 for a dozen donuts. They have a good size selection. Friendly service and I bought my donuts Friday morning and they were still fresh Sunday morning.  Best donut shop in the west valley."}
{"text":"I have been going to Dunkin for ages, guess out of habit.  Donuts have gotten smaller over the years, instead of cream they use milk in their coffee and, the donuts are half stale from being kept in an open rack next to the ice machine with the blower blowing on the donuts.   I saw Star and thought I would give it a try.  WOW,  friendly service  nice sized donuts and FRESH.  Coffee was much better and CREAM!   Everything you would want and more.  Sorry Dunkin I'm now a STAR."}
{"text":"Meh, although I am not a donut aficionado. I still prefer Dunkin' donuts. The donuts here left a film in mouth."}
{"text":"Always fresh and high quality  Get there early for the apple fritters and cream filled raised doughnut with dark chocolate glaze Wide variety of classic donuts"}
{"text":"Good morning, yesterday we stopped by Star Donuts,  we bought a variety of donuts, we were disappointed with the glazed donuts, they were denser and didn't have that great flavor, orange i think,  one reason that we love your glazed donuts was the lightness, and comparable to the big name ones.    Yesterday they were just like all the rest, dense. With a glaze.  I hope this was just a mistake, we will try one more time in a month or so but wont be ordering a dozen."}
{"text":"This place is the best dounut shop in Surprise. Most friendliest people and they work hard to provide a great service and food. Their dounuts are always delicious!"}
{"text":"Best glazed doughnut holes! Glaze is delicious and has great flavor. The doughnut hole itself is soft and fluffy. Happy to have a good doughnut shop in Surprise!"}
{"text":"We're visiting from Texas and are used to eating Dunkin Donuts but we decided to try this place for a change. The donuts here are 100% better than Dunkin!! I bought a dozen but didn't get to eat one until the next morning but it was still so light and fluffy!!"}
{"text":"Enjoying a donut as I write this reveiw! 5 stars all the way around! Owners are nice! Lobby is clean. They have Bosa Dunkin and KK BEAT! Happy it's so close to home. We will be back!"}
{"text":"The cinnamon rolls are HUGE! They put Dunkin or anyone else to shame... The donuts are very \"sugary\" vs fluffy, I guess is how to describe them. I think they are too much for me, but maybe its because I ate too many at once? Overall very good and I will probably be back to try again."}
{"text":"First time here, your ham, cheese, and jalapeno croissants are delicious, I will certainly be back for more of those! But I really came for boba, and it was sadly not good :(. Overly gooey, not slightly firm yet soft and chewy. I was disappointed."}
{"text":"Small donut shop, but great quality and service! The donuts are delicious and I'm especially happy that they sell boba! Must try the taro root babo. Delicious and refreshing. The family that owns the shop is super nice and very friendly. Please stop by and support this local business!"}
{"text":"Been out here 5 winters and this is the first time here. I'm from Illinois and with all the problems the state and our city has, we do have a locally owned donut shoppe that has the best donuts in the world. Star Donuts is a close rival. Star doesn't have a huge selection. I had a cinnamon role and a glazed. Both were excellent. I can't say anything about the cream filled or cake donuts....yet"}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a try early in the morning on my way to work and I'm so glad I did! This place has some of the best donuts you will find in the valley.  Very nice customer service with great options! Try them out. The BEAR claws(filled with fruit!!) and fritters are so amazing!   Will defiantly be back again! (':"}
{"text":"I love this place. The doughnuts are always fresh, soft, and delicious. They actually serve drinks with boba here and they get the boba right every time. Some places over cook or under cook their boba, but not here. If you haven't tried Thai Iced Tea with boba yet, you're missing out. A husband and wife duo own this establishment and you'll usually find the husband in the back making doughnuts, and the wife up front, manning the doughnut counter and the cash register. They are really good about keeping the place clean. The wife is super sweet and treats regulars by slipping in an extra doughnut every once in awhile. I'm super happy that they opened up in our neck of the woods."}
{"text":"Delicious donuts, extremely friendly and accommodating staff and reasonable prices. I always get the glazed and maple. My children like the Bavarian creme-filled. The best thing besides the donuts? The coffee is strong and delicious unlike most donut shops! This is a great place to stop early in the morning to Surprise co-workers or your family! Worth the calories!"}
{"text":"Best donuts! Hands down. DD didn't even come close to these.  Customer service is excellent.  Make this your first choice for donuts AND coffee."}
{"text":"I went to Star Donuts for the first time last week and have already been back.  This is by far the best donut shop I have found in Arizona.  They put Krispy Kreme and Dunkin to shame.  Good selection of donuts and they are good size too.  Will be going back again very soon! If any of you are from California and have been to Winchell's, yea this place is right there at their level."}
{"text":"My go to donuts.  I get cravings for this place.  Not even on the same level as Duncan donuts.  The owners c are very nice too.  My favorite is a white, white, chocolate sprinkle cake and maple bars. Yum yum"}
{"text":"I would have loved to try these donuts, but we got there two hours before they said they closed and the doors were locked. Sign said they were sold out."}
{"text":"Amazingly delicious fresh donuts. Place is small but clean and the owners are always friendly. The only downside is they run out quick or don't make enough of the popular selection."}
{"text":"We've visited this local business several times throughout different hours of the day, pastries/donuts are always fresh. The owners are friendly. This is our go to place now when we get a sweet tooth"}
{"text":"Very good donuts and great service. I am glad to give my money to a small business. I hope they stay around for a long time."}
{"text":"Finally a real donut shop in Surprise!  My family loves this place.  All the donuts are really yummy! I like the glaze.  My family has gone there three times since they opened.  Both my husband and myself have taken some to work and everyone liked them.  This weekend I tried the ham and cheese croissant.  It was great!  It's a mom and papa shop and I like that."}
{"text":"Update: The doughnuts are great but this business closes early all the time due to sold out doughnuts.  Here is a tip; Please make enough doughnuts so I'm not driving 20 minutes just to get disappointed!!! This has happened 3 times. I will start calling first because this is ridiculous.  I drive the distance because the doughnuts are worth it.  It's just unprofessional to close early almost everyday.  Please get it together business owners because You have a great product!"}
{"text":"Great Mom and Pop-like donut shop! The glazed donut and donut holes are to die for. The time my family came in, the owner gave my two daughters a free donut hole which was very refreshing to see from a business. If you are looking for the non-chain donut shop in Surprise, this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"Simply the best donuts I've ever had. Karl's Bakery on Central Ave is the only place in the valley that comes close to Star Donuts. I'm super stoked they're in Surprise!!!! Love this place!!!!"}
{"text":"The donuts are delicious and always super fluffy!! I always love going here and also getting boba with some pillow donuts. :) The boba is really thick when she makes them and the service is super quick. Nothing can beat them! Love love love this place!! Super nice and always willing to make you happy when you stop here  Thanks Star Donuts!!"}
{"text":"Amazing donuts, cheaper than the popular chain, and friendly staff. Try the buttermilk donut! It's superb!"}
{"text":"Donuts here are so soft and fresh. I love just the plain old glazed donuts...they are so soft and not too crazy sweet.  They go great with coffee.  They are even good a day later warmed up. The owners are extremely nice. Love this place."}
{"text":"Stopped in an early weekday morning while vacationing in AZ.  The woman who helped us was very friendly and helpful.  Picked up a half dozen to include a cinnamon crumb cake, twist, raised chocolate frosted with sprinkles, chocolate raised with cream, raised with blueberry filling and chocolate cake with chocloate frosting and sprinkles.  All these donuts were fresh and delicious.  My absolute favorites were the cinnamon crumb and the raised blueberry filled (and normally I am not a raised donut girl).  Notably, even on day #2, these donuts still tasted really good.  Store is small but the donut cases were full when we were there that early morning.  I noticed they have an extensive smoothie and tea drink menu to include boba, also.  It was a little too early for a sweet drink and donuts combined, perhaps in the future as the drinks did look yummy.  The cup of coffee I got here was awesome.  Smooth and not acidic.  Perfect accompaniment to the donuts.  Glad this fairly new donut place has come to Surprise.  I will definitely be back for more when I am in the area in the future."}
{"text":"We love this place.    Always friendly.  Donuts always fresh and yummy.  Recommend without reservation."}
{"text":"Great donuts..gourmet donuts for sure. These are definitely the best donuts I have had on a long time.  Only problem is I can't eat this stuff ask the time.  Lol.  won't be going back to Dunkin donuts as long as this place is here."}
{"text":"My husband brought these home for breakfast today. I had a buttermilk bar and a chocolate glazed creme filled donut. The buttermilk bar was very good. It wasn't overly heavy like they can be at other places. The creme filled was amazing! It had chocolate glaze on top and was sliced open and filled with vanilla creme. The creme was like a mixture between butter cream and whipped cream, but not overly sweet. I really enjoyed this one. I think we had tried this place when it first opened and weren't too impressed. I seem to remember the donuts looking really small but this time everything looked good and, more importantly, tasted good! We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"A big plus for Surprise. Other then Dunkin Donuts and store bought. There isn't much choices out here for donuts. Well on Friday I took the kids there for a donut. Was surprised by the selection even for late morning. Their fancy donuts are huge. The donuts are very good, I still like the Donut shop on Grand Ave. However this is a great place. The workers are really nice, not a lot of seating inside, but there is seating outside. Well worth your visit, prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"hello there im  movie mike i stop off  today to get my friend something sweet   when you walk in you are greeted by a smile and a hello they have a huge  selection to choose from if you are  in the area stop in for something sweet they have drinks too"}
{"text":"Just went to your shop today and asked for long johns with buttercream filling. You said you could do them so i came back in half an hour and you tell me you cant.  Dont tell someone you can make something if you cant.  Thanks for nothing.  Probably wont ever come back to your shop.  I wish you luck anyway."}
{"text":"Wow! I never expected donuts this good out of such a tiny bakery!   Pros: I love the warm neutral colors when you walk in, the ambience is nice. When I first walked through, I noticed the smoothies. They were delicious. I ordered a white and chocolate donut with coconut shavings, both were absolutely wonderful. I love their coffee, as well. All at such a wonderful and inexpensive price.  Cons- The size is small, but surprisingly, you can maneuver quickly. I don't like it when an employee sweeps up trash, right next to you. Lastly, the seating is too narrow to maneuver in.  Overview: Nice little bakery, equal to or greater than an average starbucks. Prices are low enough so you can actually go buy a donut without becoming bankrupt (laugh here). I love it, and recommend it to everyone!"}
{"text":"My family thinks these donuts are as good as we got out in California. We heard that they had the best glazed donuts and  fritters which my husband likes and is very picky. I'd definitely recommend Star donuts to friends and colleagues."}
{"text":"Best in the west valley for donuts.   Apple fritter is great don't miss if in area. They make a nice variety fresh each morning"}
{"text":"AmAzInG!  After a long awaited donut store in the center of surprise, we spotted the  \"Grand  Opening\" sign, could or be? Star donuts is finally open! Our family of four entered & spotted am almost-empty donut case.  With hunger and disappointment, we waited in line, willing the case to fill. Out from the back emerged a donut God, armed with trays of fresh donuts that seemed to sparkle in the Saturday, Arizona sunlight. We made our way to the front, not turning away like the many defeated that left in disappointment. Alas! It was our turn! With a filed case we bought our share, 12 for our family, please. So worth the wait! Melt in your mouth, not too sweet, light and fluffy!  Our family will be back, no matter the wait."}
{"text":"Always friendly when I go to location, very accommodating and willing to make donut if does not have up front. Light and fluffy donuts, some of the best I have had."}
{"text":"This shop is a Surprise gem! These rival the best donuts I have ever eaten.  So light, fluffy, and fresh!  The prices are great, and the owners are friendly.  The selection is smaller than you might find elsewhere, but I appreciate their focus on doing a few donuts right."}
{"text":"I was in this star donut during their grand opening and it seemed ok at first. I ordered a dozen donuts and as I was selecting my donuts I saw a tiny fly in the glass case. I swiped my finger to make sure it was on the inside and I told the worker in front of the other customers that I don't want any because there is a fly inside case. I left empty handed. That's just nasty to have a fly in the case going on the donuts. I WILL NEVER GO BACK TO THAT PLACE. You people probably think no big deal but if I see that it just grosses me out."}
{"text":"Since I tried their delicious donuts I stop going to Dunkin' Donuts. it's fresh and delicious . Way better than DD,"}
{"text":"So far some of the best donuts I have had in Arizona. When I got done with 2 of them I was disappointed I didn't buy a 3rd. People working there are super friendly."}
{"text":"So I stopped by here for the first time the other morning (because DunkinDonuts was crap) and I am very pleased. This will probably be the family's donut shop now. The donuts are big, fluffy and fresh and the blended drinks are so good! Sweet and creamy and I love having boba as an option"}
{"text":"Best donuts in Surprise ! Not horribly pricey !  They are always made fresh !  Nice and soft !  Quick and easy to stop in and get some to go!  Lines usually aren't to crazy busy unless it's national donut day but they were worth the wait !   Love love love star donuts !"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite donut shop in Surprise! Small establishment, plenty of parking, delicious food and quick service.  Came here a little after 6am this morning to grab some donuts for the shop. With the variety of donuts they have it was hard to decide...so I just grabbed a dozen and a half! Each of the donuts I chose were all sooo good! From the gigantic Apple fritter to the Bavarian cream filled donut and all of them in between, I would recommend all of them!  Having a freshly baked, rich, soft and sugary morning breakfast treat is an amazing thing. Just biting into those puffy sweet morsels will make you want more! Needless to say, my co-workers and I demolished them all! I will be back for more to fill my donut needs when I work out all of the donuts I just ate."}
{"text":"The place was small but sweet and the staff was really friendly. I first came for the boba but grabbed a dozen variety of donuts OMG let me tell you I'm not a donut person but these donuts are light and fluffy I have to restrain myself from eating another. My girls who really love donuts enjoyed them so much and said they were the best they have had to date.     The coconut boba was really good exactly what I expected and satisfied my craving. I'm so happy to have a boba place in town.     I would definitely be making all my donut and boba purchases here!"}
{"text":"My coworkers and I love the donuts here. Especially the donut holes. Soooo soft and fluffy.  Their ham and cheese croissant warmed up is SO good! I get that for breakfast every once in a while! Try it! It's huge and super soft!  Their thai tea and milk tea are pretty good too.  Always the same couple working, and they have always been so friendly! Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"The best donuts!! Oh wow. We tried multiple flavors and the cinnamon crumb is amazing! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place has some great donuts. The only thing I was disappointed about was the service. I went into the store Saturday morning with my  five year old daughter and ordered a dozen, the lady behind the counter continued to sigh every time  my daughter asked her a question and wasn't fast enough at responding on the next donut she was going to pick. I figured being a donut shop in surprise they are probably use to family's and kids going in and ordering but I guess not."}
{"text":"Star donuts seems slightly misleading as a name.  They offer 40-50 flavors of smoothie and boba, so maybe star smoothies would have been a better description.  This shop does sell donuts, however they have a limited selection of about 5 flavors of donuts in the raised (yeast) donut and those same 5 flavors in the more dense cake style donut.  They also offer an old fashioned donut, bear claws, cinnamon rolls, and apple fritters.  Very basic donut flavor options.  The donuts are delicious, I just wish they would branch out from chocolate, vanilla, maple.  Also they did not sell simple glazed donuts, which are my husbands favorite.    Overall the small shop was clean, and the staff seemed friendly.  And the donuts that were there tasted delicious!"}
{"text":"The donuts are fresh and really good. My favorite is the whipped cream filled.  The owner is really nice and friendly.  These are the best donuts I have had in a long time. They are also much cheaper then other donut shops in the area."}
{"text":"Bought donuts for my Co workers,  they all loved them!  Fresh, soft and delish. I got a Taro Boba, was disappointed that they didn't have non-fat or low fat  milk so was super sweet. They sell out fast so you gotta get there early."}
{"text":"By far the BEST donut shop in surprise.  The service is great, the donuts are fresh and they have BOBA!!! Love this place and and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I love this doughnut shop! Absolutely amazing donuts and fantastic Thai tea. The bobas are sooo good."}
{"text":"Some of the best Donut shop coffee I've ever tasted...warm and friendly staff, and the ham, cheese and jalape√±o croissant was delicious! New in town and will definitely return. Awesome that they take credit cards too!"}
{"text":"Donuts were great. Very fresh and soft. Service was ok. We only saw one employee the entire time, but was friendly. My daughter and I also tried some boba, but couldn't get over the texture. The flavor was good, but definitely not a fan."}
{"text":"Great donuts, very fresh and owners have a decent selection.  The cinnamon rolls are delicious, but I have been there on two occasions when they have been out. Also, only coffee option is k-cups.  Hoping owners will continue to fine tune and make small improvements...much better than Frys or Dunkin Donuts."}
{"text":"Holy delicious! Every single donut is amazing, the dough is so fluffy and flaky, no wonder the line is always out the door! This is our Sunday morning ritual."}
{"text":"Nice to have fresh donut shop in Surprise now! They are open early to allow people to grab some donuts on the way to work. Very friendly people, good selection, soft as a pillow donuts. You can smell them cooking as soon as you get out of your car in the parking lot. Check out the apple fritters, not only are the huge but they are delicious!"}
{"text":"Drive up just as they were turning the open sign off. It was about 4:00 on Sunday. Owner was mopping the floor and invited us in. They offered us what was left (about 15 donuts) for $5. We graciously accepted and are glad we did. Everything we have tried is fresh and delicious. Cannot wait to go back when they have a full selection. So great to have a good donut shop here in Surprise. They might be new with some bumps to work out but hopefully they are here to stay."}
{"text":"great real donuts... from the east coast and this is exactly how the ones I grew up with taste! always fresh super fluffy and light...wonderful place. will return for sure."}
{"text":"The thing I miss most about living in Southern California is the donuts. SoCal has a donut shop on almost every corner fresh and inexpensive. Arizona has a few decent shops, most of them are too far away. I am very excited to have Star Donuts fairly close to my house.  The staff was very friendly and efficient, filling orders and moving on to the next customer.  The selection was perfect. I do not enjoy the Dunkin idea of having 30 different kinds of donuts, but be out of the popular ones, pick a reasonable selection and have plenty of each on hand.  The donuts were excellent, soft, fresh, plenty of flavor, not overly sweet. We had Glazed twists (a houshold favorite), maple bars, blueberry filled, sugar and crumb donuts. All were exacly as they should be.   Prices were on par with Arizona donut shops, not the $5.99 a dozen you find in SoCal, but reasonable for here. I though the 10 cents extra charged for filled donuts was a bit silly, but it is pie filling after all and that can be costly.  Great shop, welcome to the neighborhood, we will definatley be back."}
{"text":"Delicious!! Been waiting 'forever' for a great doughnut shop in Surprise, and now there is one!  Great shop, friendly staff, good prices...simply awesome doughnuts, fresh, light and fluffy!!"}
{"text":"Fast, friendly service. Great prices and delicious donuts!! My favorite is the mable log. I wish they had some more options that were original or maybe had some specialty Donuts but otherwise they have all the traditional great flavors available."}
{"text":"The best Apple Fritter in the area! Friendly service, nice little shop, really tasty donuts. Give it a try...you won't  be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great selection and prices are good. Donuts were soft and fresh. Very yummy! Will for sure go back."}
{"text":"YUMMY!!! Fresh, soft and many different options. Not has many as Dunkin but way better tasting! Staff is very friendly. Seating area is small,nice and clean. Very happy they came to Surprise!"}
{"text":"Best donuts ever!!! Always fresh and super tasty! The staff is great and always will to accommodate your needs! We love this place!"}
{"text":"Decided to stop in here after visiting pie Wei for lunch, so glad I did! Super nice girl behind the counter and phenomenal chocolate chocolate nut donut! Yummy!"}
{"text":"absolutely delicious apple fritters what a weird concept that somebody actually put apples in their apple fritters and they are big the size of your hand"}
{"text":"I gotta say this place is damn good!  Saw the coming soon sign forever.  Without a Bosa in Surprise the only choice we have is DD, which is not good.   These guys are very friendly, and already very busy!   I am not a fan of cake donuts necessarily, but my kids are, I tried one of theirs and could become a fan of them here!   The non-cake ones that I had were outstanding.  Will be back frequently I suspect!"}
{"text":"The donuts, Apple fritters, and the croissants are so delicious. Employees are very nice and prices are reasonable :) also you are in and out very quickly. You won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Love this place! Friendly staff and wonderful freshly made donuts. Also you have to try the breakfast sandwiches especially the ones with ham and jalape√±o."}
{"text":"Delicious donuts and great service! Wish they had a large selection of cake and filled donuts. A half dozen is about $5 - not bad at all. I'll be back to try their drinks!"}
{"text":"Every now and then, you just need a donut.  There are some delicious donuts here in the Phoenix area (Lamar's, Bosa) and I was excited to see a new shop opening up on Bell Rd.  I drive down Bell Rd to work every morning and for the last few weeks, I had seen a sign out front that said \"Coming Soon\".  Well, I drove by it the other day and it was changed to \"Grand Opening\".  I decided to stop in and sample their goods.  I parked, walked in and here is how everything went down...........  I got in the place and there were 2 people working, a man..who seemed to be the donut maker, and a lady who was working the front ringing people up.  There was a lady already at the register who had placed her order for some donuts and was waiting on a coffee or something.  They have one of those coffee machines that you find at cheap gas stations...the kind where you put your cup underneath it and then press a button and it comes dripping out.  Well...that wasn't working so well.  Something was wrong with the coffee maker and the guy employee/owner was taking it to the back to get it fixed?  Anyways...the lady finally was rung up , grabbed her donuts and was on her way.    While all this was going on, it gave me some time to browse their selection.  They had pretty basic offerings and I had a general idea of what I was going to get.  There was one other guy in line in front of me.  It was his turn to order.  This is where it went a little hectic (I was running a bit late to begin with and I figured I would just pop in, grab some donuts and be out in a few minutes....that did not happen and here is why.)  The guy in front of me starts asking the people if they can \"fill a chocolate long john\".  I instantly made my \"you have to be fucking kidding me face\" and shook my head.  Hey...I'm all about freedom of choice.  We live in America, damn it!  But if there is a line of people behind you, just choose from what they have in the case.  This isn't \"Donut Throwdown\" and the last time I checked, \"create your own donut day\" falls on February 30th!  Get outta here..........  Anyways...the nice people that own the place granted his request and went and got the jelly donut filling machine, popped his long johns in there and gave it a squirt.  He replied with, \"I always liked those as a kid.\"  I felt like replying with, \"Where the fuck did you get your donuts from as a kid?  I've never in my life seen a jelly filled chocolate long john.  Anyways......he was on his way.  It was finally time to get my donuts.  I went with a regular glazed, a raspberry filled jelly donut, a  double chocolate cake donut and a chocolate covered buttermilk bar.  A tad under $4.00 later, I was out the door.  Here is how the donuts were..........  Regular Glazed-  Very light and airy.  When you bit down, it was like a soft pillow collapsing.  The donut had good texture and a good amount of glaze.  It was probably my favorite of the bunch and I would definitely get it again.  Raspberry Jelly Donut-  Once again, this was a very light and airy donut.  The jelly filling was just alright.  It was not sweet enough and the jelly part didn't have the best texture.  Decent but not a standout donut.  Double Chocolate Cake-  This donut was pretty small.  The overwhelming theme of all the donuts I tried was that they were not too sweet.  The chocolate icing was pretty thin and the donut itself was soft.  I like a little crunch/texture when I bite into a cake donut.  Sadly, this one did not have either.  I would not get this one again.  Chocolate Covered Buttermilk Bar-  Why do buttermilk bars always have the thickest icing?  My buddy said it perfect... \"It's like buttermilk bars coating is ice creams Magic Shell of the donut world\".  I couldn't have said it better myself. This donut didn't have the great \"tang\" of a good buttermilk bar.  It was pretty small too.  Probably wouldn't get it again.  Overall, this place is ok.  The lady working the counter was nice and friendly, the donuts wont break the bank, but there are better donuts out there.  This might be a good donut for Surprise (compared to Dunkin or store brands), but it's not in the same ballpark as others I mentioned before.  I will probably be back at some point.  It's on the way to work and its conveniently located so I'm sure Ill stop back in. I also like to support mom and pop type stores when possible.  Stick to the glazed and you will be alright."}
{"text":"Really good fresh donuts.  I liked it a lot.  Not a ton of variety but what we did have was really good.  We also tried a couple of smoothies and they were good as well.  Would definitely try them again."}
