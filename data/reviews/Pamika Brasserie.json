{"text":"Highly recommended beautiful ambience with tasty food! Exciting place for people who like to explore Thai cuisine! Visited for the first time, we were warmly greeted. We were explained about the restaurant, a simple tradition (i.e. to share all dishes and bringing all meals, all at once) and the special dish of the day. All meals were finely plated and decorated. They were filled with fresh, tasty, and distinctly flavored ingredients.  Our choices were: Pamika Tum Thai, Crispy Shrimps, and Pineapple Fried Rice; Our choice of dessert was Mango with Sticky Rice and we had a cocktail (Bangkok Delight). I'll definitely try this resturant again and will recommend to my friends. My only dissatisfaction is the waiter! She was quite nice but rushed us into ordering, taking unfinished dishes, and speeding us into ending of this fine experience as quickly as possible!!! The resturant was not busy and perhaps half empty; therefore even I could not imagine any reason why :)"}
{"text":"Loved it! Tiny place and left me thinking i had made a mistake, not the case. Excellent mango salad, pad thai and a warm seafood salad mmmmm! Great hosts and service. Will indeed visit again"}
{"text":"Amazing service! From the Hostess, Waitress and even the Busser that made sure I got another beer!  The food is exceptional and the green papaya salad is a must!"}
{"text":"Came here with the girlfriend and had a stellar experience.  We are vegetarians and the staff made accommodations for it. The variety of food which is prepared in that small tiny kitchen -  the freshness and taste is amazing.  They have a limited but good drinks menu and while I got the Thai iced tea as I was driving - I noticed others having a blended pineapple drink which looked delish.  Great place and friendly staff! Five stars!!"}
{"text":"Although, the ambiance and atmosphere with the friendly staff were all pluses, the food was not. Thai food is a very flavorful food that lets your palate take a short vacation to Thailand while sitting at your table enjoying your food. I am astonished that most reviews rated this place as the best Thai place in Montreal. I have been to Thailand more than I can count, and the food here, was nothing to rave about, in my opinion. Get better chefs who know what real Thai food should taste like and this place will be wall to wall each and every day. Went here on a Wednesday night and there was only 1 other table besides ours who were dining. I really looked forward to having our dinner here and so wanted to love this place, but the experience with regards to the food itself, was just not here."}
{"text":"Nice thai food restaurant! We had the pineapple fried rice, pad thai, and plat du jour which is set tum thai with pork chops. The pineapple fried rice was my least favourite, the rice was too mushy. The pork chops were very tender and tasty, as well as the papaya salad came with it. The pad thai was good too with their spicy sauce served on side. The service was attentive too! Recommend you to make a reservation if you are going on weekends night. Hope they could expand their dessert menu though. I definitely would like to come back again!"}
{"text":"Klein maar gezellig. Heerlijk eten, correcte prijs en fijne bediening. Net naast ons hotel, ideaal dus. We bestelden 3 gerechten die we samen deelden. Tof concept."}
{"text":"We went right out of the way to go to this restaurant and it was absolutely worth it. The only thing I would have liked is a bit more explanation of what kind of restaurant it was before ordering. It's set up like an authentic Thai meal, so platters are ordered and shared with the table. Very good overall though! Would recommend!!"}
{"text":"J'ai bien aimé ce petit restaurant chaleureux. Le service était excellent. Le pad thaï était délicieux, très goûteux! Le porc sauté au gingembre était bon, mais m'avait pas la même complexité dans les saveurs que le pad thaï. De plus, il manquait des légumes en accompagnement."}
{"text":"Our last night in Montreal and we were craving some good Thai food. My husband and I found this place on Trip Advisor and then cross referenced reviews, which were all good so we decided to give it a try. The restaurant is tiny (when paying the bill we noticed the kitchen was a dorm-sized one-woman operation!) and we sat outside on the deck at a table overlooking the street. Our waiter was super nice and was helpful as we were undecided about what to order. We decided on a noodle soup, a chicken salad, and a shrimp dish (our server did warn that this might be too much food but eyes tend to be bigger than stomachs). They came out one a time and we were never rushed or felt like we were waiting to long. The flavors in each dish were excellent. All the veggies were fresh, flavorful, and cooked just right. The soup was thick, which I hadn't expected but still very good. The chicken was very spicy, which we like. My husband didn't prefer the shrimp dish, it was a bit too sweet for his tastes but I enjoyed it. Anyway, taken together the atmosphere, service, and food created a 5 star experience for us! Oh and I forgot to mention my pineapple drink! Delish (see pic)!!"}
{"text":"Everything was phenomenal! We stopped here on the whim, and although it was quite crowded we were given a table after minimal wait time. Ambience is lovely. Food was so delicious and fresh. Def coming back when I'm in the area!!"}
{"text":"awesome staff, good flow of dishes - you definitely want to go for family style dining. the duck salad was a hit - lots of sustained heat but it never overwhelmed the flavour and savory-ness of the duck. lots of less spicy options too, definitely going back very soon to sample the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, great food perfect atmosphere for a date! Papaya salad was awesome."}
{"text":"I'm totally baffled by all the good reviews this place has. This was easily the most disappointing meal we ate in Montreal.  Yes, this place nails the superficial things: it's a gorgeous interior, a lovely porch with a view, and the presentation of the food is stellar.   But all that glitters is not gold. The food is bland and overpriced. This was the worst pineapple fried rice I've ever had. It just tasted like buttery rice and was almost totally devoid of the spices that give it color and flavor and make it my standard go-to dish at Thai restaurants. The Pad Thai was also unimpressive. And if you can't do a couple of core-menu dishes well, what are you doing selling Thai food at all?  The signature cocktail epitomizes Pamika: it looks beautiful when it arrives, but then you realize it's just a bunch of gold flakes and ice and a pineapple core with hardly any liquid and certainly not enough alcohol to stop the flood of regret you have from wasting one of your few dinners in Montreal at this place.  Bottom line: Pamika prizes style over substance. The food is bad, the prices are high, and it's not worth your time. Don't fall into this tourist trap."}
{"text":"Pamika is authentic and delicious Thai food! We had never been to Montreal and we found this place on Yelp and decided to try it out. We lucked out and found the food to be amazing, the atmosphere cozy and the owners were nothing but welcoming and fun. We will definitely go back next time we are in Montreal. Our favorite dishes were the Tom Yum soup and the sauteed vegetables with shrimp."}
{"text":"Amazing customer service. Fresh authentic food... family operated... Great sauces... A special place;)"}
{"text":"Ordered for delivery, got the papaya salad and the panaeung curry with beef. I asked on the phone about the difference between the two listed papaya salads,and he explained that they don't recommend the one to Westerners (forgot which one, esan or siam), which I thought was cute, so I said I will go with the normal one then and maybe try the other one next time. Well, I certainly won't, as the one I've gotten was definitely hot and flavourful enough for me. Authentic tho, with the tiny shrimps, peanut halves and some tomatoes slices and nice dressing. The meat in the curry was tender and good,the sauce was rich and creamy. The basil and turkey berries just gave that little extra authenticity and well rounded flavours. It came with white rice (at no extra charge). Will order from there again. Delivery was fast."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Thai food I've ever had.  Started off with the spring Thai rolls - absolutely delicious.  Fresh and not greasy. Pineapple rice and crab were delicious as well as the red curry seafood. We were looking for a Thai place and after seeing the reviews on Yelp, we decided to try this place.  So glad we did.   The food is so beautifully presented and the ambiance is beautiful. Nice wait staff and water with mint is served makes a nice touch. I ordered a mojito and it was so good with a nice big sugar cane in it.  I highly recommend this gem when visiting Montreal."}
{"text":"I don't review restaurants as much as I should but tonight's meal deserves 5 stars.  Our first time in Montreal, we were looking for local restaurants with interesting food but not too expensive.  After reading the reviews, we made a reservation at Pamika.  We ordered the red seafood curry and the yellow chicken curry.  They were nuanced with lemon grass, kaffir and coconut  flavors, not too heavy or spicy,  Incredibly delicious."}
{"text":"I found this restaurant exploring online and was drawn to it because they offer Thai bbq, where you grill your own food on a personal gas grill over broth. The location threw us off because it is part of a hotel and very small, but do not let that fool you. We were greeted by very friendly servers who remained friendly and attentive throughout our entire meal. The Thai bbq was so much fun and delicious. It turned a romantic night out into such an amazing experience.  I can't comment on the other menu items, but the bbq was delicious. You get a generous portion of meat, seafood and veggies. You definitely need to pay the additional $4.50 for extra noodles, but that is a small cost considering everything else you get. I definitely recommend this restaurant and will go back for sure. I only gave it four stars instead of five because of the size and the look of the restaurant, however that did not interfere with the service or food quality."}
{"text":"We came here in a visit to Montreal. What a great experience. The place is nicely decorated with an exotic atmosphere. The food is great, the drink are so good, and the staff are just amazing. I would definitely recommend this place for anyone looking for a fun experience and great food."}
{"text":"Perhaps the best Thai food I've ever had. And I've had a lot. A unique spin on every dish that made me wonder, \"Maybe this is how the dish is actually meant to be prepared!\" and brought into question all Thai food I've had previously. The Tom Yum soup comes in an actual coconut, which is always fun because you can scoop the coconut meat off the inside. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Not even in Montréal yet and we were searching for something to satisfy our Thai tongues. This place was on the top of the list. The location's pretty central considering Sherbrooke's one of the main boulevards.  The service wasn't what we expected because we were forced to turn away, due to the lack of seating. Make sure you have a reservation! We were back a couple nights later and noticed how top-notch and accommodating the service can be. The prices aren't too complementary to the portions, unfortunately. For example, the PAD THAI (ooooh my god, please don't get me started, I love this dish everywhere. Ya gotta be able to make this dish anywhere).  Now, the other noticeable quality for Pamika is the taste, and how authentic it is. Our taste buds were all over the place, such that the ecstasy had us saying at one point that this is the best Thai restaurant in Canada. My Thai girlfriend agreed it was as traditional as you can get, without actually being in Thailand. It's really 4.5 stars, because of the smaller portion. But, you can't really go wrong here."}
{"text":"Small but cozy space and personable staff that really did try their best to make our experience a good one. Unfortunately the kitchen didn't deliver on its potential - especially given the other positive reviews. Started off some pleasant cocktails.  Tom Yum soup was delicious filled with seafood. Papaya salad was incredibly spicy despite discussing level of spice tolerance - even my friend who enjoys spicy food had trouble with the dish and we resorted to chewing ice cubes for a few minutes to recalibrate or taste buds.  The wait staff did their best to accommodate and offered a spiceless replacement which was rather salty.  Chicken cashew dish chicken was very dry but I could taste the potential of it had it been not overcooked.  I can imagine it could be a better experience during the summer when their outdoor grill is working but our experience was unfortunately rather a grim one."}
{"text":"So good!!!!!!! Authentic Thai cuisine but with a really relax and modern vibe and really good drinks. One of the few dinners I've had where every dish we ordered was amazing!  We got the papaya salad and tom kha as aps and they were to die for and also quite big and so very worth it price wise. For mains we got the pad Thai and the pineapple fried rice which were also amazing.  Staff was super nice and outgoing and customer service was great- they brought our drinks a bit late and so they offered them on the house which was so nice !  100% recommend!"}
{"text":"The real fun for us was experiencing Thai food in Canada vs. the U.S. and getting dishes with ingredients different than what American Thai places feature, like tapioca noodles and Thai sausage.  That said, none of the four dishes we ordered was really a knockout.  The gyoza, fried dumplings with a ground pork filling, had a very good tasty filling and were nicely fried; but were still just a basic fried Asian appetizer.  The larb, a Thai chicken salad, was just too intense, both spice-wise (two warning peppers on the menu) and also with the level of sourness and herbs.  The shrimp fried rice was a nice, thick, sticky rice dish, but not a dish to stand on its own; and the soup, featuring soft-boiled egg, tapioca noodles, Chinese greens and \"Thai sausage,\" was a tasty Cantonese-style soup, but bland for Thai food.  The \"Thai sausage\" didn't seem to me to be anything more than meatballs made of ground chicken.  We were lucky to be seated on a busy Saturday night, and the service was harried but apologetic, failing to bring us the second beer we ordered, for example.  A fine experience, but I think we could have done better."}
{"text":"Authentic Thai food. Nice small terrace for sunny days. Small restaurant. Casual ambiance. Will come back for more. That's all you need to know."}
{"text":"Loved the decor.  Food was delicious.  We tried the gyosas, chicken satay, pad thai, pinapple rice and all was yummy! We loved the pinapple bangkok deink."}
{"text":"Got the crispy shrimp and pamika pad thai delivered on a Thursday night. The food arrived on-time, warm and tasty."}
{"text":"Nous sommes des habitués, du gout, des produit de qualité, de la quantité et surtout un service amicale.  Essayer le pad Thai et la soupe servie dans sa noix de coco !  Genial"}
{"text":"Very good thai food, reminiscent of what I had while in Thailand!  We ordered the green curry, pad thai and beef penang. Special mention to the beef penang, it was amazing. I could eat that for a long time. All the dishes were good and we, three women, all left full. A hip atmosphere, the service seemed a bit scrambled and hectic but it was 8:30pm on a Thursday.  If you want to go Thursday - Saturday definitely reserve, this place was full. We didn't and they sat us at the bar, which was fine. A bit pricey, but delicious, and they don't rush you, service was generally quite good!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best thai food in Montreal. I ordered a drink wich was delicious, and the pad thai wich was to die for. My bf had the beef in a tasty sauce with rice. We ordered also the rolls for entree. From the service to the food and decor, it was all exceptionnal!"}
{"text":"Je suis allée à ce restaurant une fois seulement, mais j'ai tres hâte d'y retourner. La cuisine y est délicieuse et le personnel est très sympathique et jovial :)."}
{"text":"My favorite Thai restaurant here so far!!The green curry is everything! I love spicy food and this place is so perfect. I order mine Thai spicy and it definitely doesn't disappoint. We also love the pad Thai and the spring rolls. Haven't tried much else yet because we are so obsessed with those 3 items. Give it a try. I don't think you will be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Stop searching for a Thai restaurant in Montreal - I've discovered the best one in town!  Came to Pamika for dinner last week and literally didn't want to leave or stop eating! The restaurant was packed on a Tuesday night but we had reservations and were quickly seated surrounded by awesome Thai decor and a cozy ambiance. We were told that the special of the day was a mixed dish of papaya salad, sticky rice, and pork chops so we decided to start with that, and then order two more dishes to share (it's basically a tapas style restaurant) which we were told would be enough food. We opted for the beef curry and the crispy shrimp.   The special of the day came out first and was so delicious I could cry. The papaya salad was spicy but so flavorful while the pork chops were sweet and tender. The sticky rice was great to cut a bit of the spice from the salad. Next, our curry came and I literally never wanted it to end. Perfectly marinated and flavored, this is hands down the best Thai beef curry I've ever had! Sadly, the portion wasn't that generous and it was quickly finished leaving a ton of sauce that I wanted to bathe in to avoid wasting but alas... sometimes things don't always work out your way. Finally the shrimp came out - to be honest, I was really underwhelmed by this dish but hubby loved it so maybe it's just me but I wouldn't order it again.  Solid service, amazing food, a bit pricey, but will 1000000% be back. 4.5 stars but since we can't give half stars, an easy 5 star rating goes to Pamika. Can't wait to be back!"}
{"text":"Honestly, I stopped going to thai restaurants in Montreal because they never match up to the freshness and tangy-ness of real Thai food. This restaurant was recommended to me by many friends who've visited Thailand as well (and whose taste I sort of trust) but unfortunately, this place has also disappointed me in terms of authenticity.   We ordered Lab Kai (Chicken Salad), Chicken Green Curry, Pineapple Fried Rice, and Chicken Satay. Lab Kai maintained its level of spicy which I appreciate but the texture did not match the Lab Kai I had in Thailand and other places in Asia. The taste lacked a hint of lime and lemon grass but out fresh chilli which was a good touch. Green Curry was not my favourite. It was sort of bland. I liked the pineapple fried rice, I think best dish among all that we ordered. Satay was all right.  We thoroughly enjoyed Thai Bucket of alcohol (we had Gin + Sprite). Alcohol level was good. Worth the money."}
{"text":"We loved it! We were visiting Montreal with two kids (9 and 11) and our parents. We love Thai food and saw that Pamika had high reviews. There were six of us, and we easily found a table for our size party indoors. The food was delicious. The spices weren't overpowering, and the flavors were wonderful. The staff is attentive. The decor and ambiance was nice. It's a cozy restaurant with a great menu."}
{"text":"The place is so cute! Outside patio with sunset view! Loved the food also, 5 stars! Best papaya salad and pad Thai, everything was amazing!! Visiting from FL very impressed!! Thanks -Suzy"}
{"text":"Make sure you reserve before coming to not wait 45 min like us.   The pineapple drink came inside an actual pineapple. If you want a refill of this drink, it's 25% cheaper. It's better to share one drink and then get a refill.   As for the food, we took the shrimps wrapped in noodles as an appetizer. It was crunchy and delicious. For the main, we tried the red curry with seafood and some spicy pork. Both were ok but if you're used to eating spicy stuff, it's not really spicy. The waiter warned us about how spicy the food is and to be careful but I was a bit disappointed. Look for the pepper signs.   For us spicy food lover: 1 pepper: nothing at all. Just sweet.  2 peppers: ok i feel some tingle... 3 peppers and more: yeah ok now we're talking  The service is awesome. The bartender was very friendly and nice and gave us a free shot for waiting. The deco is dark but perfect for hanging out.  Overall, it's very pricey for asian food (you can pretty much get the same dish for cheaper with a bigger portion elsewhere and with a more authentic taste) and it was overly sweet. Although the service was awesome, I don't go to a restaurant for the service but for the food."}
{"text":"Mon meilleur resto thai à Montreal. Service excellent en plus. Chapeau à la gérante pour son service très attentionné. Excellent cocktail Tom Yum Mojito, pour la bouffe tout est excellent, ça fait déjà trois visites cet été et toujours à la hauteur."}
{"text":"One of the best thai restaurant in Montréal in my opinion. They also offer food in different levels of spicy. I eat a lot of spice so i took Thai Spicy and i loved it. The lab kai is a must try. It's a chicken salad that one wraps on a cabbage leaf. Every item on the menu is to share so it's better to come here in groups. The pineapple fried rice and yellow chicken curry is also really good. Im definitely coming here again to try other things from the menu like the penang curry and to have their lab kai again."}
{"text":"This restaurant has been on my list since last winter because it's the first Thai restaurant that I know in Montreal, so I came there with a high expectation. Since we didn't make our reservation, we are told that we have to wait for a long time for the table or we could sit at the bar. Emmm this restaurant is very popular!!!!!  -Pineapple cocktail. I chose it for its attractive appearance, however, when it came to its flavor i can only give 2.5/5. The reason is that I couldn't taste any pineapple in it and the rum was too strong at the beginning and I have to wait until the ice melted and the drink was finally smooth enough to drink. I think adding some pineapple purée will give a nicer and more refreshing taste.  -Tom yum soup Just right spiciness and competitively generous amount of seafood in that pot of heart warming soup. However, I was expecting more umami and sourness in the soup to give me a kick. Overall, it's 4.5/5.  -Special combo Grilled pork- the best thing of it was that i could taste the flavor brought by the reaction between pork fat and the flame but the pork itself was not marinated enough so it's not very tender. And it became chewy when it generally cooled down. I like the flavor but texture has to be improved. 3.5/5. Papaya salad- Crunchy and refreshing, but the acidity was not enough so it couldn't bring enough freshness after you eat the pork, and personally I think it's too sweet. Good point of this salad was that they added dried shrimps to it so you can actually taste a different type of saltiness. 3.8/5. Glutinous rice plays the connecting rule when you are trying to eat all the thing in this combo together. It cut down the sweetness of the salad.  -Pad Thai I must admit that when I couldn't take my eyes off it the second it came out of the kitchen. The standard that I used to judge if the pad thai is a good one is the aroma of the wok. It's the flavor and smell that a really hot wok and speedy cooking process brought. In this case, it's good enough. However, this dish is too sweet for us thus we asked them if they had the seasoning such as chili powder, fish sauce and spicy vinegar. It became better after we added the lime juice and a little bit vinegar and a lot of chili powder. The bartender who standing right in front us looked so surprised when he saw us doing so. If you considered yourself as a spiciness mania, you can add the chili powder because it brings an aroma that alleviates the sweetness. 4.8/5.  Overall, the dining vibe is comfortable and taste of food is on standard. Recommended for those who want to give a try on Thai food and living in Montreal."}
{"text":"Pamika Brasserie was very accommodating for our group of 5, and the interior was absolutely stunning.  We had a 7:30pm reservation on the Sunday of the long weekend, and they had to turn others away at the door. Being a smaller restaurant, I would highly suggest reservations. It was 100% worth it to plan ahead for this food. We ordered chicken pad Thai, yellow curry, pineapple rice, cashew nut chicken and spring rolls. Everything was delicious, my personal favourite being the pineapple rice and chicken pad Thai. The yellow curry was also very flavourful.  One of our group had never tried any Thai food prior to this trip and she loved it! Everyone in the group was very impressed."}
{"text":"This is a great authentic Thai restaurant. Papaya salad is fresh and delicious. Ask for a Thai ice tea, and add a little dark rum if you're up for it. The bartenders are very nice and accommodating, and they even gave us sips of extra drinks he was making without charge. As with all authentic Thai food, it is very spicy, but you are able to order it from 0 to 5 spice level so that you can get exactly what you want within your tastes."}
{"text":"I went on a Tuesday night. It's a small cozy place and the food presentation is really charming. Although, having been to Thailand, I couldn't help but compare the food. The Tom Kha Gai was perfect, sour and not to rich from the coconut milk. Unfortunately, the pork in sweet and sour sauce was overcooked and dry but the sauce was good! Also, the pad thai noodles were overcooked as well but the sauce was really delicious and authentic like the one in Thailand. The homemade iced lemonade tea (it's orange), is a \"must-try\"! Finally, there was only a choice of sorbet for dessert, which wasn't phenomenal, I wouldn't have minded the traditional fried ice cream or fried banana. I haven't tried that many Thai restaurants in Montreal, all in all, I would recommend it to try, perhaps the other meals executed to perfection, but wouldn't go again before a really long time."}
{"text":"Service 4/5 Food 2/5 Ambiance 4/5  Thai iced tea (1/5): Wayyyyyyyyyy too milky/creamy, there's barely any Thai tea taste to it. I saw that it was already premade behind the bar counter (looked like spicy mayo) and then they poured condensed milk on top which made it even a lighter orange. I tried it and immediately did not like it, I had other people try it at my table, and it wasn't just me. I told the server I did not like it and he asked if I had Thai iced tea before.... Really? I said I drank it all the time. He asked if I wanted more condensed milk or cream, I said no. So he said I didn't have to drink it and took it away, also took it off the bill. He came back with pineapple drinks for us to try and it was good (that was a plus).  Tom yum soup (1/5): This was extremely salty. Like I was pouring salt down my throat. I felt my blood pressure rise by the second. I had to drink a whole cup of water.  Chicken skewers (2/5): It was lukewarm to cold. It was alright with the peanut sauce.  Pamika Pad Thai (2.5/5): This decent, but a little too sweet. The serving size was a little small.  Papaya salad of the day (piquant) (4/5): It was spicy but pretty good. It was a pickled papaya salad that came with sticky rice and pork on the side.  Piquant Thai Salad (no rating): This dish was extremely spicy (for me), I only had just a small taste and needed a lot of water. But everyone else at my table said it's good."}
{"text":"nice restaurant, if you want to eat spicy food, this is really a place to go. the owners are super nice, and I love their drink serve in a real pineapple."}
{"text":"Beau petit decor ET ambiance intime.  On a pris 2 soupes qui ressemblaient à ce que l'on peut manger au Thai express... pour moins cher...  Le service a été correct, mais on a dû se lever à plusieurs reprises pour avoir des baguettes et un bol."}
{"text":"I expected a lot looking at the reviews and ratings but was disappointed . Ambience was nice, but food did not meet the expectation. Server who attended gave us nice option to pick our food but served different item. Quantity was very very less and very pricy . This restaurant gave me disappointment . :("}
{"text":"One of the best experience of Thai food in Montreal. The declaration of the wall, the chair and the food are magnificent, it was like in Thailand. The atmosphere, customer service are good. Strongly recommend to try the BBQ and hot pot but they only have it in summer time :("}
{"text":"BEST THAI IN MTL!!! Green curry, Pad Thai, papaya salad, chicken satay, shrimp.. are all amazing!"}
{"text":"In the spirit of fairness I will state that my first visit was pleasant and both my friend and I enjoyed our dishes and had great service.  But this is not what has prompted me to write a review. I arrived this evening at 9:50 asking if there was still time to place an order to go, and I was told yes. I then placed my order but waited in the foyer telling the server that I had just played a soccer game and might not be so fresh to be in the main area. He told me no problem and I heard him relay the specifics of my order to the kitchen.  And then I waited. A simple pad thai order, but it was nearing the end of the night so I wasn't going to be fussy. At 10:26 I decided to leave (they close at 10:30) as I leaned forward and saw that the kitchen staff were in fact cleaning and not cooking my order. During this time there were roughly 10 separate occasions where a staff member had come in the same area as me to put something away. Not one person had spoken to me since I placed my order.  When I left I ultimately felt pissed off and offended that perhaps it was my younger demeanour that caused them to ignore me. To this I can only speculate, but when it comes to my personal finances I can say this: if you can't be bothered to serve me, then you don't deserve my money."}
{"text":"This place deserves 6/5 starts. I am on a trip to Montreal with my husband for 4days. After a long drive from NY we were very tired and hungry. We got this place through yelp and went directly without any reservation. So we had a place opposite to bar. Even though we don't drink, we felt very comfortable and coming to food it was so delicious. We ordered omelet, pine apple fried rice in which they keep chicken fried rice in a pine apple. Also we had a soup which tasted very good. I highly recommend this place to dine in. Their service and everything is very good !!"}
{"text":"The experience was amazing. The waitress explained the menu in details. We had the cocktails Bangkok Delight & Pamika Mojito. As meal we shared 2 appetizers: Gioza & the dumplings. We also shared the chicken \"Meal of the day\" the side dish was the papaya salad with hot peppers. As desert, we had the mango ice cream & coco ice cream. The service was perfect and also how they decorated the restaurant is unique. Better take a reservation."}
{"text":"Last night, we went to Pamika. I was super excited since Thai food is one of my favorite kind.   The place is petite but adorable. Our dinner party was 8:30pm; but food was served at 9:40ish... by then the hunger was making few people cranky.   Since we were a huge group, the food was served as buffet. The appetizers were the best!!! From shrimp rolls, vegetables spring rolls and seafood salad. The rest of the food were average.  The shocking part was the price; 40$ for the small amount food. What was unbelievable is that if you go on their website the group menu goes up to 35$.   We never investigated, since it was a bday party and it was very late, and there is a massive snow storm."}
{"text":"The food was really good and crazy portions. Also came fairly quickly. Even the drinks are huge. I love how they encourage sharing. We had some great service in Montreal, but honestly none compared to here. I wish we got the server's name. He was so friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Not the best Thai food I've ever had, but still really really good, probably the best Thai food in Montreal."}
{"text":"We were on a mission in Montreal to have some extravagant French dining adventures. After three days of some really decadent dinners (and a lunch of classic poutine), we wanted a break with something more casual and lighter - and not so European. She started with the famous Pineapple Cocktail and loved it! Thai rolls were good. Had to ask for more sauce but no problem. Had a great soup...had 'Tom' in the name but not \"Tom Yum\" and it's not currently shown/updated on their web menu. Oh well. It was great though. We also had Chicken Green Curry. Was excellent! Great flavor profile and balance. Not too hot. \"Pamika Pad Thai\" was also great. Very relaxed, friendly, but attentive service. Very good time."}
{"text":"What a great experience at this authentic thai spot! I love spicy food so thai is a natural fit. Their menu is small but every dish was pleasing to both the eye and the palate! No doubt the spicy level is high, but it's definitely part of the authenticity. The mango and papaya salads were delicious. The pad thai and and cashew chicken were layered with flavor and the pineapple fried rice was perfectly made and served in the pineapple! Great service and freshly made creative dishes.. Montreal is becoming my favorite city!"}
{"text":"Had 3 dishes and all 3 were great. For those who have been to Thailand it brings back the memories and for those who haven't been it give an authentic experience of the delicious food. I definitely plan to go back and I highly recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"This place is exceptional! The only reason I'm deducting one star is because some of their dishes are too spicy to eat. However, they do warn you about that on the menu and the waitstaff do the same.  The service here is awesome. A server is constantly refilling your water glass and are very helpful in describing the special(s) and suggesting items. Last night I went for dinner around 8:30 pm with a reservation I made earlier in the day. It's a small and dimly lit restaurant, perfect for a nice date or even for a small group of people. They have some special tables for larger groups and outdoor seating when the weather permits.  For three people, we ordered the larger Tom Yum Soup, the fried fish special of the day, the pineapple fried rice, and the Seafood Red Curry. All of them were absolutely delicious and not too spicy. The soup was full of citrus and cilantro, the fried fish was glazed in orange and delicious with the accompanying green mango salad, the pineapple fried rice was mild and served in a pineapple, and the red curry was my favorite- flavorful with spices but not too spicy.  In the past, I have gotten the green curry which is FIRE!  The ambiance is lovely, the service is 5 stars, the food is delicious, and the price is reasonable. I will definitely return to Pamika for all my Thai cravings."}
{"text":"Excellent Service! Excellent Food! I had the papaya salad as a starter and the red curry seafood and vegetable plate as my main dish.  They were both delicious!! So much flavor!!"}
{"text":"Really delicious food and helpful, kind service. Truly a quality experience, I don't have any complaints and felt taken care of by the service instead of stressed or pressured like at a lot of places in Montreal. This business knows how to give you a wonderful evening!"}
{"text":"Truly amazing food. Tiny place. Authentic. My husband is Thai born and said it was the best Thai food he has had in the west. Will come back the next time I visit MTL.  We ate the phad thai, som tom, cashew chicken, mama tom yom, red curry with shrimp and calamari.    Addicting and even though I was stuffed, food was finished!!!!"}
{"text":"We chose Pamika as our first meal in Montreal and boy, we were not disappointed!!!  The lush greenery outside this tiny restaurant almost obscures it from street view but if you're able to spot this hole in the wall - enter and never look back!! It's an incredibly cozy 14 seat venue with an equally tiny exposed kitchen in which the restaurant's namesake, Pamika recreates with amazing accuracy and authenticity the traditional fare of her homeland.   After a long day of driving to Montreal from NJ, my husband and I were famished. We ordered the cashew nut chicken and the pad thai. The pad Thai was amazing and the portion was hearty but the real star of the meal was the cashew chicken. Being a foodie, this means a lot coming from me - the cashew chicken at Pamika was the best meal I've ever eaten!!! Absolutely out of this world amazing!!!   The service was kind and friendly (we were so grateful that the waiter spoke perfect English and that they provided us with English menu's instead of the French menu posted outside the restaurant).   All in all - I couldn't have asked for a better experience for our first dinner in Montreal!! The Experience at Pamika Thai brasserie did not disappoint!!!"}
{"text":"Our usual thai spot in Mtl is restaurant Thailande on Bernard but we wanted to try something different that night so we ended up at Pamila Brasserie. We went on a tuesday night without a reservation. The restaurant was packed but the waiter managed to get us a table pretty fast! The ambiance was great with all the lights and colors. Cocktails were great; i highly recommend the ThaiBoxer which was amazing! The curry was authentic as was the green papaya salad with its face-melting peppers...! The service was also very friendly! The restaurant was a little bit on the pricier side but it was definetly worth it! Will go back"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a truly authentic thai restaurant you must try Pamika. This small resto is a must try as their dishes really take you away to Thailand. The interior decor is simply remarkable and cozy. I would recommend for groups, a night with friends or a romantic dinner for two. Their dishes are truly authentic and packed wirh awesome flavors..every bite will keep you on the edge of your seat. Dishes are reasonably priced and they have set group menu's for groups of 8 or more which range from 35-50$. Would definitely come for more!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had the place to ourselves on a snowy Sunday night. The atmosphere is cozy, modern, and inviting. We had the jab soup, chicken with cashews, and the pad thai. Two of these dishes would have been enough for the two of us - the portions are generous. The soup and the chicken were my favorites - very flavorful and unqiue. The pad Thai is good too, not amazing though (note: it's not sweet like a typical pad thai). Great waiter, reasonable prices. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Amazing Thai experience, easily the best I have ever had..first went on date, and is now my go-too for all occasions. Dishes are delicious and original, good portions, very easy to share. Also make solid cocktails. Owners have an amazing story, run by a young couple, husband met his wife in her home country of Thailand during a vacation. She is the chef and runs the kitchen, he runs the front of house and service. This definitely one Montreal's too hidden restaurants, make reservations because they are packed all week!  #hiddengem #musttrythecashewchicken #lovethisplace"}
{"text":"Nice restaurant with a friendly staff! The decorations inside are cool the Thai looking furniture and decor almost feels like your escaping the wet Montreal winter. The food is nice I had the spicy chicken special, could have used a bit more spice. And they have a fun drink menu, more geared towards ladies drinks ;). Overall good place to get your Thai fix! PS you might need a reservation!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and a good experience. They were very accommodating to our group of ten despite not having a reservation on a Wednesday night around 9. Service was slower than expected though   Multiple meals were ordered but the kao prao and the crispy pork belly were my favourites. They have a little kick if you like a little spice"}
{"text":"Everything I tried here was amazing, fresh, and authentic, but my favorite was the green curry. The atmosphere is warm, intimate, and modern. This is a great spot for a date or a cozy dinner for friends."}
{"text":"Mouthwatering and absolutely delightful! Their food takes you to Thailand and back in one sitting! Absolutely amazing! The staff, the ambiance and the entire experience was absolutely perfect! We ordered Tom Yum soup, pork chops with sticky rice and papaya salad, pineapple fried rice, and mango with sticky rice."}
{"text":"Authentic, but very small menu, including lack of appetizers aside from salads.  Stupidly spicy Chili and Lime Pork. Spiciest thing I've eaten in a while with all the peppers cooked atop the pork. Server saw me dying and was nice enough to bring over a side of rice to help tame my burning flavour palette. Pad thai is a very peanutty but tasty version, not the ketchupy or overly tamarind based flavours most places offer up. After the first dish I think the server was suprised I still wanted hot sauce on it.   Maybe closer to a 3.5 star eating experience but the friendliness of the staff made up for it, and there does seem to be a lack of thai food in this area of the city."}
{"text":"The first time we came here with friends and ordered their Large Beef Penang, Large Chicken Green Curry and Papaya Salad. The food was extremely good and service was great.   However the next time we went here a day after Valentines and ordered the exact same things, we were given food which was completely different. Maybe they have changed chefs!  It wasn't appealing to look at as the Curry and Penang were watery and tasteless. We had asked for it to be spicy, but the Curry barely had ANY taste at all. The food came out after much delay, and even then it was only the Beef Penang and it took them another 15 mins for the Curry. Service was slow, and food was below average.  Consistency is key in this business. And to maintain the standards, of food and service both.  Disappointed with our experience as we really love Thai and had a great time the first time around."}
{"text":"Typical Thai restaurant. Nice decor cocktails are great.  Service is really good.  Price for 2 is average."}
{"text":"Would not recommend, although the food was not terrible, the service was horrible, rude and condescending waiters. We ordered a curry that did not specify that the meat would not be boneless. We were disappointed and kindly asked if we could exchange it for something else and received so much attitude back. They agreed to change it to another curry that was boneless but very rudly took the first curry and slammed the second one on our table. The portions were very very small and the bill was pricy. The green curry and pad thai did have flavor but would not come back"}
{"text":"There are few times when I leave a restaurant without having an ounce of constructive criticism for the establishment but this was certainly the case with our dining experience at Pamika Brasserie. The warm atmosphere, welcoming staff and out of this world thai food (oh and on point mojitos) makes this a 5 star restaurant without a doubt. Would HIGHLY recommend!"}
{"text":"Je recommande ce restaurant Thaïlandais pour les amoureux de la cuisine Thaï authentique! La chef, Pamika, a quitté Bangkok pour venir s'installer avec Pascal à Montréal et ouvrir ce resto. J'en suis à ma cinquième visite. Dans le  menu, vous retrouverez le vrai goût des mets typiquement Thailandais au travers d'un menu de partage, permettant ainsi de découvrir plusieurs plats dans une atmosphère conviviale. Je vous conseille de réserver car il y a environ une douzaine de places et les repas sont préparés sur-le-champ par Pamika. Tout est frais et savoureux! Le service est impeccable et chaleureux. Allez-y, vous ne regretterez pas votre première visite et dès votre départ, vous penserez à votre prochain souper chez Pamika!!!"}
{"text":"My friends and I shared the special of the day that included pork chops, a cold and spicy papaya salad, and sticky rice. Best pork I ever had in my life.   I also went for my birthday, and when I asked if they had a birthday special for desserts they said that they didn't have anything. A few minutes later, the waiter comes around with a bucket of pineapple!! It was nice to have something!  The special Bangkok Delight drink (that comes in a pineapple) was really good and strong.  Great experience in a really nice atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Wow! Quelle découverte! Meilleure thai en ville! Authentique et savoureux. Plats à partager: allez entres amis ça vaut la peine!  Thé thai: miammy!  Pad thai: bien équilibré et savoureux. Salade de papayes: pimentés comme je les aime. Amateur s'abstenir...ce n'est pas 4 piments pour rien! Je le recommande chaudement!  Salade de canard: bien...pas mon préféré.  Carry rouge: parfait! Je le recommande.  Service impeccable. Notre serveur connaissait très bien les plats. N'hésitez pas à demander conseils (surtout en terme d'épices)!  Rares sont les restaurants à Mtl qui osent le piment (autant)!"}
{"text":"Second time dining here and I'm still amazed. I highly recommend to make reservation ahead (especially for terrace seating) as it would get packed quick. We ordered chicken satay, Red curry seafood and mango sticky rice. All the dishes are delicious and filling! We were two, so one appetizer and one main dish was sufficient enough to share. For drinks, I ordered a Bangkok delight (served in a pineapple ) and my friend had ordered a Thai Boxer. We both preferred Bangkok delight but Thai boxer is refreshing. Our waiter and busboy were kind and friendly, both explained well when we had questions. Overall, my friend and I enjoyed it and we will definitely go back. Our waiter suggested to come in a bigger group next time and try the bbq special (only for terrace seating)."}
{"text":"Vraiment chouette resto au décor authentique. Nourriture gouteuse et bien assaisonnée. Service chaleureux et attentionné. Le Pad Thaï est délicieux. Si vous cherchez un Thaï au centre-ville, celui-ci est recommandé."}
{"text":"First night in town so met friend here for a quick meal before next stop. I like the decor, great for a date. It's October so no outdoor dining.   Waitstaff were fantastic. Very pleasant.  I had the Full Mooner (Thai Shakes) with gin but I think they were very light on the gin..hardly tasted it.  There was a special for the night- sticky rice, papaya salad (hot/spicy) and fried chicken. It can feed one as an Entree or 2 can split it as an appetizer. So we had this and the Gyoza  The Gyoza were disappointing. I have had Gyoza's before (even frozen ones from Trader Joe's) that were better.  The meat inside was dry and felt rubbery.  The papaya salad was good and spicy but not sure it complimented the meal it was paired with. The sticky rice also was sorta hard...it felts more like old rice vs fresh sticky rice.  Then we shared the Vegetables with Shrimp served with white rice. The flavor here was just missing.  Coming from an area where Thai food is a-plenty, I had higher expectations and I don't think the meals lived up to what I know as great thai food."}
{"text":"I get why it's highly rated.  I too recommend it.  The Thai is good (its at the same level of decent nyc Thai) and the seafood soup as well.   Service was very good, tho my pad Thai and soup came out at the same time (but that's not the reason for four stars - I sparingly give five stars).  Overall, good experience and I'll come back."}
{"text":"As a person who lived in Thailand for nine years this restaurant really takes the cake as far as authenticity. Just come here don't worry about anything else. Get in a taxi and order. Everything is good. Even tried the lobster pad Thai and it was phenomenal."}
{"text":"I would have given an excellent review for Pamika, if it were not for the long waiting, 1 hour to get what we ordered , and the seating, that was very uncomfortable! We we were a group of nine, we arrived few minutes before our reservation which was at 9pm; the table wasn't ready. We had to wait a dozen of minutes, for the previous group to finish. We got seated inside, in the left corner with stony walls, around a round table, which is cozy by the way and looked great for our group. However the leather seats were too high, and our feet were pending with nothing to support them. We were slipping all night long, this was very uncomfortable. An hour after ordering food it finally came! The waiter and the manager apologized, they were very friendly, they visited our table regularly to check everything.  Finally, food was yummy; we ordered a special group menu; Pamika Tum Thai (Green papaya, dried shrimps, carrots, fresh chilies, roasted peanuts), Crispy shrimps (Fried shrimps wrapped in egg noodles), Pamika Pad Thai (Chicken, rice noodles, tofu, chives, bean sprouts, crushed peanuts), Chicken Cashews (Chicken, red and green peppers, onions, cashew nuts), Pineapple Fried Rice (Chicken, carrots, tomatoes, onions, fresh pineapple), Red curry seafood (Shrimps, calamaris, Thai basil, kaffir leaves, red peppers, coconut milk)."}
{"text":"Bonne cuisine thaïlandaise. On retrouve les saveurs thaïlandaises grâce à l'utilisation des bons ingrédients. Excellent rapport qualité prix et belle approche de découverte culinaire grâce à la découverte progressive des plats et le partage de ceux-ci. Laisser vous guider par les personnes du service sur les quantités et le choix. Petit point d'amélioration : étoffer la carte des vins (aujourd'hui 2 blanc et 2 rouge) qu'il est toujours bon de déguster avec la cuisine thai (Sauvignon Blanc, pinot noir servi frais,...)."}
{"text":"We did a get-together for New Year's with about 8 of my friends and everyone loved the food. Very flavorful soups and salads. We got 5 services to share and the portions were adequate. The resto suggested us to go with this option and it was a good idea! Desserts were good. Service was friendly! Do reserve before-hand since this place gets quite full and busy :)"}
{"text":"Great Thai food, just as authentic as being in Thailand! The manager is super friendly and offers great recommendations! Make sure you try the gyoza's and the pork special! So delicious! Make sure if you plan on eating in you make a reservation well ahead of time!"}
{"text":"Une belle découverte !  Petit resto intime avec beau menu de plats à partager.  Très bon service et prix raisonnable.  J'étais un peu pressé et seule j'ai donc pris uniquement la soupe mais je me promet d'y retourner entre amis et d'essayer le bbq Thai en été."}
{"text":"Great location and beautiful ambience! Street parking very close to restaurant. The service was spectacular,  and it helped that the staff also spoke English. The history behind the restaurant is quite interesting and is clearly reflected in the restaurants operations. The food was delicious, truly authentic flavouring. The sea food entrees were clearly fresh and tender,  Bangkok Rolls were crispy and flavourful. The Pad Thai was spot on.  Truly a worthwhile stop."}
{"text":"I hate to give negative reviews but this time I believe most of the favorable yelps have it wrong. There is nothing bad about Pamika but the food is very  pedestrian. We tried a few of the dishes that a lot of the yelpers were raving about ;the cashew chicken, Pad thai ;and pineapple fried rice. They all were on a par with your average Thai fast food take-away and if anything these dishes tasted overly sweet. We had the highly recommended pineapple cocktail which helped to bring on a sugar rush. I've waited a few weeks to write this review because I may have been a bit hyperactive after eating here..but my initial impressions have not changed. I gave it 3 stars but  its more like 2.5 and 2 stars would be too harsh. There is Way better Thai food almost everwhere else in Montreal."}
{"text":"Very good \"real\" Thai flavors.  Went with a big group so had picked one of the tasting menus and all items were great!"}
{"text":"Loved the experience of grazing through a variety of Thai dishes. All new tastes for me,  loved every one. Delightful atmosphere. We tried 3 different times to get same-evening reservations. Hard to do but well worth a try."}
{"text":"The staff were very kind but their service was so unbelievably slow. We waited for over half an hour to get out bill. Food was fine. Ambiance was nice. But I'm so sorry waiting 30 mins between appetizers and then having to wait so long to get the bill is ridiculous.  Definitely not coming back again."}
{"text":"Pamika is a really amazing Thai place. Very unassuming from the outside, you will be surprised when entering the restaurant. It has a very nice decor and you are instantly intrigued by the delicious smells. The food is some of the best Thai food in Montreal and the service is great. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Best Pad Thai ever. I had to try the Pad Thai and it was very good. I figured the good reviews could not be wrong. Decided that I had to sample the fired rice also, which was delicious. It was only the second time ordering the pineapple fired rice, which I'm not a pineapple in my food type of guy, but I would order it again and comp it up again! I'm glad I skipped my usual spot that I visit when in town and tried this gem."}
{"text":"This may be the best Thai food we have ever had. We were in Montreal for a mini vacation from Rochester. This place was recommended from our Airbnb host. It was Sunday night and we stopped in for dinner around 8pm. Thank goodness we made a reservation because there was a considerable wait.  The restaurant is small and the smells were great coming from the kitchen. I ordered the Panang Curry and my wife ordered the chicken pad thai, of course. This was my first order at a Thai place that didn't include pad thai as I wanted to try something new. I am so glad I did, I have been on a Panang Curry kick the last few months and have even attempted making it at home. This place really is a gem."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is cozy and the owners are extremely friendly and welcoming. The food and drinks are fantastic. We ordered the pad thai and stir fry with shrimp. The portions are very generous. We only ordered two dishes and that was plenty. The shrimp dish is very tasty and the pad thai is incredible. It is definitely my favorite place to go to for pad thai. The pineapple drink is amazing!!! Excellent service and food!"}
{"text":"En déménageant à Montréal il y a trois ans, j'étais évidement très enchantée par la variété de bons (lire: excellents) restaurants. Par contre, étant une grande fan de bouffe thaïlandaise, j'ai eu beaucoup de misère à trouver un restaurant thaïlandais à la hauteur de mes attentes.   Heureusement, Pamika existe! C'est une brasserie thaï qui inclue de bons cocktails et plus important encore, d'excellents mets. Chaque jour, Pamika offre un spécial du jour - prenez le en entrée sans vous poser de questions, c'est toujours bon. Ensuite, vous ne pouvez pas vous tromper avec un bon cari rouge.   Bref, c'est en découvrant cet endroit que s'est acheminé ma quête pour le meilleur restaurant thaïlandais!"}
{"text":"The food was flavourful without being overwhelming. The yellow curry was ideal, the fried rice was tasty, and the pad thai was solid."}
{"text":"Ambiance très cosy. Nourriture très bonne, fine, goutu. Et très bon service. On reviendra!"}
{"text":"The taste of the food are good and orthodox in my opinion. And they are able to keep the spiciness of how the food should be. Overall I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Excellent, authentic Thai and super convenient location near Sherbrooke station! This place is small (just a few tables, best for groups under 4 people) although I suppose in the summer the patio increases their capacity. The vibe is intimate and cozy. Food may take a while to arrive, but it's worth it. Presentation is excellent (fried rice served in a pineapple, tom yum soup served in a coconut!) and the dishes are flavourful, with a really good amount of spice. I really loved the spicy chicken salad with lettuce leaves. The menu is small with some interesting dishes, not just your usual standard Thai dishes that you see everywhere. Be sure to see what the daily specials are. Service when I went was excellent and thoughtful - definitely no attitude from the server regarding my subpar French! I would certainly come back here next time I am in Montreal."}
{"text":"Solid neighborhood joint that puts on airs of being the spiciest, most authentic, least-compromising Thai restaurant you've ever tried. Don't believe the hype. By U.S. standards this is very middle of the road, standard Westernized Thai food.  Our bartender repeatedly warned us about how spicy and special the food we were about to try was, and it...wasn't.  Red seafood curry and green chicken curry were both tasty but pretty standard in spite of all the pretension.    There were no exotic herbs or sweat-inducing chilies showcased. These were just good mild-to-medium coconut curries like even *I* can make at home with a can of Mae Ploy paste.  Everything was tasty enough though.  The green curry includes winter melon, which if you haven't had it, is very delicious -- kind of like a watery potato or piece of yucca.  The seafood in the red curry was delicately cooked and not rubbery; both dishes would have benefited from more vegetables and fresh herbs and garnishes.  Unless you're interested in sweet-sounding tiki cocktails, the alcohol menu is fairly limited.  The (admittedly drunk) bartender was bragging about how the most renowned mixologist in the city designed the cocktail list, but honestly, nothing appealed.  We did enjoy some coconut ice cream for dessert, which I suspect is a concession to Western palates and not actually native to Thailand.  Bottom line: better Thai is to be had in Washington, DC, New York City, etc. So don't get your hopes up.  This is just nice, average, slightly overpriced fare."}
{"text":"Incredible food and service. Dom is a gracious host and talented chef. The atmosphere here is cozy and the decor charming. A definite plus on your visit to Montréal"}
{"text":"delicious AUTHENTIC Thai cuisine. My boyfriend and I visited and had a great experience.  The only thing we didnt love was that they play American music... it's such an authentic play it would have been great to hear some music from Thailand."}
{"text":"Nous sommes allés dans ce petit mais réputé restaurant thaïlandais, et je n'ai pas été déçue.  Nourriture: la nourriture fut supérieuer à mes attente, beaucoup d'épices, très bien assaisonnée, plusieurs choix végétariens et différent niveau de piquant. Nous avons pris plusieurs plats à partager, des gyoza sont croustillant et juteux mais manque un peu de saveur 3/5, le panaeng de buf à un fort goût de citronnelle et les portion manque un peu d'équilibre (quantité riz/curry) 3/5, le fameux pad thaï vaut le détour, le meilleur pad thaï à ce jour dégusté dans Montreal, saveur bien équilibrée et avec option végétarien 5/5, le sauté au champignon était le meilleur plat selon moi, le parfait équilibre de saveur avec une pointe d'épicé 5/5 et le Kra prao était également très bien assaisonné avec une bonne dose d'épice comme on aime, juste l'uf frit qui ne servait pas à grand chose posé sur le riz 4/5. Nous avons également pris leur trois desserts, qui sont tous à base de noix de coco, je ne me souviens plus trop de ce que c'était, mais je me souviens de la crème glace coco était délicieuse et des texture intéressante des deux autres desserts avec du tapioca et de la châtaigne d'eau.  Décor: nous avons été placés à l'entrée mais l'entrée vraiment, sur le coin gauche de la porte il y a un rideau qui cache une petite table de cinq personnes, ben nous étions la ! Cet espace était quand même super cute avec des guirlandes et des statuts en pierre de type thaï, mais le toit de cet endroit était une sorte de bâche qui n'est pas vraiment résistante à l'hiver et l'humidité donc il y avait des gros spots de moisissures dessus puis ça c'est moins nice pour les gens qui freak out (comme moi). Puis dû à l'isolation improvisé de cet espace nous avions deux chauffage d'appoint comme seul chauffage puis ce n'était pas assez avec le rideau pour bloquer les courants d'air de la porte d'entrée malheureusement.  Service: Le serveur unique, seul pour tout le restaurant était génial, parfois oublié de nous apporter une nouvelle carafe d'eau mais outre ça il a répondu à tout nos questions puis était super agréable et charmant."}
{"text":"Keeping this short...went for my first time on Monday (February 1st, 2016) because of a recommendation by tripadvisor. The place was small and cozy, nothing terribly special, but the food was absolutely amazing. We tried three dishes that our waiter recommended, the warm noodle salad, the pad thai, and the green curry chicken, all of which were out of this world flavourful and delicious. I left full yet there was still more I saw and wanted to try so I will 100% be going back and bringing friends with me!"}
{"text":"Skip the mama's Tom yum, unless you like a package of ramen thrown into a bowl with a few shrimp added for $11. The pad Thai was edible but forgettable. Too bad too. I had high hopes based on other reviews."}
{"text":"Great to be back in Montreal and finding new restaurants!  This one is part of Hotel de Paris on busy Sherbrooke street and Saint André street.  I used to stay at the hotel which was not fancy but very affordable and a 10-12 minute walk from the main stages for the famous International Jazz and world music festival every summer.  There was a simple, small café for breakfast.  Now, they completely renovated the space and it is a gorgeous Thai restaurant!  My traveling companion has stayed at the hotel with me before.  We were absolutely wowed by the transformation!  One of the owners, Antony, was tending bar where we sat for dinner.  Antony was mixing up fantastic Thai cocktails and my Pamika mojito was terrific, adorned with a sugar cane stalk.  My friend loved her drink as well called a Thai Boxer.  My Beef Penang was in a perfectly spiced coconut sauce and the meat was the best I have ever had for this dish at any restaurant.  We shared the smaller sized and priced portion and, along with a very admirable pad Thai, we were quite satiated.  This restaurant seems to be getting more and more popular due to word of mouth so I suggest making a reservation.  If you want a delicious Thai meal in a very beautiful neighborhood in the lower Plateau, Pamika Brasserie is a wonderful spot!"}
{"text":"Definitely my favourite place for mango sticky rice! I also tried their pad Thai and chicken pad kra prow dish. Can't say those were the best, but decent tasting."}
{"text":"We were here on a beautiful late-spring evening and sat on the terrace. The vegetarian options are not listed on the menu, but our waiter pointed out what could be made with tofu. The papaya salad was fantastic. So spicy! Our cocktails were also delicious. Service was very courteous and helpful.  My only objection is that the restaurant is in the same building as a hotel, and the hotel patrons sat above the restaurant's terrace and smoked cigarettes. Not very appetizing."}
{"text":"This place is a gem, I like everything about it - from food to location to service to ambience to decor. Fresh, authentic Thai food presented in artisanal fashion. They've got the best Tom Yum soup in town."}
{"text":"Very very delicious. Probably the best Thai food I've had outside Thailand! Kitchen is tiny but they make very flavourful dishes. I suggest you order balanced numbers of spicy dishes and mild dishes. The candy they give you at the end is yummy too."}
{"text":"Was in Montreal for the weekend with some girlfriends, and called as we had heard amazing things about this place.  Not surprising, they were fully booked but the staff member went above and beyond to squeeze us in and we were and are so thankful, as it was seriously THE BEST THAI EVER and such a fun evening.  Being someone who has been to Thailand multiple times, I am confident when I say this food is 100% authentic , and we cannot wait to go back!  Highly suggest the coconut soup and the \"Thai Boxer Pitcher\" cocktail!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite experiences ! So romantic, intimate and exquisite. It will hold a special place for me.  The pitcher of Tom yum mojito is a must!"}
{"text":"Hands down, my favorite pad Thai of all time. I normally steer away from ordering pad Thai because many restaurants make this dish on the sweeter side which I prefer it to not be. The spicy level we ordered was one step below the super crazy Thai spicy. I am so glad I did because the dish was truly spicy and we were sweating by the time we finished.  The pineapple drink was amazing! It was this cocktail they made inside a pineapple so we looked pretty cool drinking out of it. Tom yum is another good entree to try especially with the cooler weather. I wasn't a fan of the papaya salad though..it was too salty and not sour/spicy enough. Overall, love this place and would recommend it!"}
{"text":"One of the best Thai places in town.. very nice and cozy restaurant with limited but great outdoor seating..severs are very prompt and polite and the food awesome ..I do take away the 0.5 stars cause while the pineapple drink served is awesome it hardly has alcohol ..I bet it would do them good to label it is a virgin pineapple drink ...but worth tasting nonetheless .."}
{"text":"My husband and I were staying in the Hotel Paris, which is attached to the restaurant so we decided to place a carry out order. I got the shrimp and vegetables with Tofu in place of the shrimp and my husband got sweet and sour pork. The portions were large and the service was fast but I have had much better Thai food. There were lots of veggies and tofu in mine but the veggies were cut far too large and there was not a lot of flavor. We were not asked what spice level we wanted and the food was very bland. I would not go back again."}
{"text":"Went there on a Tuesday night with friends. Place is charming, staff is outstanding, food is good not great, ambience is awesome. Love their sharing, eat whatever comes out first concept. A must visit"}
{"text":"Best Thai food in Montreal.  Request for the food to be spicy. Order the fried items over the curries.   General ambience is nice.  The cocktail selection is good."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went there for our anniversary and we loved it! We ordered some drinks (one was off menu, their special spicy mojito recipe - delicious) which were properly strong, and the mango salad (was ok), the pineapple fried rice (amazing!) and the green chicken curry (WOW). Will definitely be returning, this is now our fav Thai place in MTL :)"}
{"text":"Great Thai in Montreal. The food is awesome and the service is super friendly ! I am leaving in 3 days but I will try my best to squeeze another diner there... SO good !"}
{"text":"I came here for the first time with a friend, and I must say - I really enjoyed our dinner! I love their evening menu concept - it is designed in a way you can share your food or ordering for 2 people and more. We ordered a variety of items: the Tom Kha Kai soup - so smooth and refreshning, Pad Thai - balanced flavors, not too spicy and not too sweet, a set of Thai pork chops - very delicious, perfectly cooked, and lastly, their famous Bangkok delight - beautiful presentation for a drink, not too strong, neither too sweet.  Pay attention to the spicy levels on the menu... the pork chops plate was accompanied with a papaya salad, which contained bits of red chilis, and I accidentally ate it - very spicy!  Their amabiance is nice, but perhaps a little too dark for me. I wish there was a bit more light in the place, and considering for a Thursday night - it was very noisy. The place is relatively small in size, so it can get crowded or full quite easily. Unfortunately, there is no private parking as well, there are some parking spots available on the same street of the restaurant or not too far away around the block.  Overall, I would definetely recommend Pamika Brasserie! Great place to bring a bunch of friends and hang out over some delicious food, so worth it!"}
{"text":"Legitness...yes, that is a word.  Anthony at the Bar is part owner, all hotness.  He's pretty sweet and made sitting at the bar so fun.  He's not bad to look at and also very funny.  Enough of my crushing.  Let's talk about the food.  Had the egg rolls, pad thai and green curry.  All very good, pad thai was my least favorite but the other two were absolutely authentically delicious.   My friend had a watermelon mixture drink, and says it was great.   I really liked this place.  Made some friends at the bar.  Next time I'm in Montréal,  i will definitely be eating here, partly for the food but mostly for Anthony. Lol Deducted one star because...it was piping hot in there.  I was literally dripping with sweat."}
{"text":"This is the best Thai food I've found in Montreal. Great curry. Really good noodles. And they deliver during the week. Major bonus."}
{"text":"Excellent atmosphere. Super friend and helpful stuff. Very good food, real Thai. Good place for a date, the music is low and the lighting is cozy."}
{"text":"The place is small so it would be best that you book a reservation. Also, it was packed when I went there  I've started with a drink, a Thai milk tea. It's not for everyone, they put a lot of condensed milk, but I would say it was ok for me.  How it works is that all the foods are to be shared. We had a papaya salad, a tom yum soup, crispy shrimp wrapped with noodles and pineapple chicken fried rice. Portions were big enough for two.  Food was ok, nothing exceptional, and service was good. I was served quite quickly contrary to other people.   There are not a lot of Thai restaurants in Montreal so I really wanted to try this place. At about 70 dollars for 2 it's a bit pricey, so I would say, give it a try, at least one time."}
{"text":"I'm shocked to see any bad reviews of this place at all. I thought this was some of the best, and freshest, Thai food I've ever had, and I've had plenty. The service was good and the waiters were flexible with requests. The patio is also really nice. It was slightly expensive."}
{"text":"The moment you walk in it's got a very inviting ambiance with Thai decoration. There were nobody to great us as several staff/waiters walked by us, so that felt unwelcoming plus i had a reservation. Restaurants are often under staffed. The food on the other hand was pretty good. We had the house special which was the popular combo papaya salad: it was good but because I went to Thailand, I found they were not crunchy but saggy and they put way too much peanut in the mixture. The flavour was good enough. It came with the pork chop in a soy sauce marinade that was delicious, it's a must have. Although we never had it in Thailand. We also ordered the red curry seafood, the flavour was so on the spot, I'm not crazy about frozen squid throw in there but the shrimps were ok, not the wild ones with tons of flavour. I would go back to try a couple other plates. Small menu, easy to order."}
{"text":"This is by far the best Thai food I've ever had and I've eaten at sooo many Thai places!! We had Thai ice tea which wasn't too sweet, maybe a little too milky but overall pretty good. We had the shrimp rolls, mango salad, pad thai and pineapple fried rice and it was all phenomenal. I added some spice to my dishes and it was perfect. I would recommend a spicy fish sauce instead of chili sauce that would add a nice touch"}
{"text":"This newly opened restaurant offers some great authentic Thai cuisine.  The young owners are really nice and the cook is a recent immigrant from Thailand, so you know it's authentic.  I highly recommend the spicy chicken soup.  It's fairly sweet and spicy, with a deliciously complex flavor.  The bar is decent, for $12 you can have the Bangkok Delight, a rum cocktail with mango puree and Thai basil served in a pineapple.  It's f---ing delicious and refills are just $5.  It's a tiny spot, so make a reservation."}
{"text":"Wow! Une perle bien cachée sur Sherbrooke! La formule est en mode \"partage\" et ils sont très accomodants pour sans gluten et végétariens. Le padthai est vraiment bon et tout le monde avec moi (on était 6) a adoré tous les plats. Les présentations sont superbes: leurs cocktails sont servis dans des ananas ou des verres vraiment beaux. Le décor fait authentique, mais je dois avouer que la musique avait pas vraiment rapport: hall n oates et autres trucs rétro...  J'étais trop absorbée par ma famille et l'expérience de la bouffe que j'ai oublié de prendre des photos, mais j'y retournerai assurément! J'adore cet endroit!"}
{"text":"Authentic Thai food in Montreal. Cocktails pineapple was good. Staff very friendly we love this place."}
{"text":"Went to Pamika on a Saturday night. The restaurant was full. Good we had a reservation. It is a casual place, with a very cosy atmosphere, with wall statues. We were seated at the round wooden table , not very comfortable. The couch was slippery. In addition, there was some delays in serving the food. Besides that, our evening was perfect. The diner was great. We ordered around 7-8 dishes , here are some details. The tum tai salad was so fresh and crunchy. The pad tai, one of the best in montreal. We also had the fried shrimp and spring rolls as starters. For the hot dishes, the chicken cashew, the pineapple fried rice and the seafood red curry where really good. Regarding the drinks, we ordered the Bangkok delight. It is a drink that comes in a fresh pineapple. Lets no forget to mention the impeccable service. The host and waiters were professional. We even had a visit from the manager asking for our feedback and opinion.  I do recommend this restaurant as it s one of the best tai restaurant in montreal."}
{"text":"Jolie decoration pour un rdv galant, style caverne, lumieres tamisées, il y a de l'ambiance intime; les assiettes ont des saveurs corrects avec belle presantation. Mais je ne comprends pas le nom \"brasserie\" du resto puisqu'ils ne brassent aucune biere.."}
