{"text":"Not fresh food like it used to be  They serve frozen food now!   Really bad!  Also the soup is not homemade anymore   They have just lost a whole bunch of customers!"}
{"text":"The pressure of being an yelp elitist has taken its toll on me. The countless attempts to discover the latest and greatest in the food business has effected the shape of my existence. Meaning i'm getting FAT people. So I have been looking for healthier options and getting tired of eating subway daily.  So i thought i would find a new sandwich place and remembered passing by this place on route to my job.  This is a mom and pop operation in an industrial area in Markham mainly focused around Italian cuisine. They have an array of sandwiches and wraps; also full entree's such as pasta and burgers. Their daily special had butter chicken- which was surprising and I will keep an eye out for those as well.   I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich $5.99 with cheese (+.50 cents) and asked for it to be spicy. The lady preparing it for me had a chili paste of sort and spread it on my home-styled bun. She layered the chicken breast perfectly over and added freshly cut tomatoes and onions and lettuce. Was great.  The perfect proportion of every food group neatly packed in a 6 inch bun and it cost about 6 dollars. Not bad I said to myself as I secretly thought out fat shaming insults towards myself- however that caused me to end up in a hidden escape like this. So life goes on!"}
