{"text":"I thanked God so much when I found this place.  Coming from California, I couldn't find real Korean food and good service.  For some reason, the service personnels in Toronto are pretty bad.  Downtown Toronto Ktown has many Korean restaurants but the foods weren't that great.  Something was definitely missing.  But now, I'm so happy that I've found this place.  Seul Long Tang and Kalbi Jjim is so delicious.  It was so good I ate this three days in a roll.  This is so far my favorite place to go in Toronto!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is steps from my house, so I was excited to try this new restaurant.
The time that I went, they didn't have pork bone soup (they have it now for 8.95), so I was a bit disappointed.
The restaurant decor is modest, and very traditional - probably more authentic than most of the other ones in Toronto.

Two side dishes - the kimchi and the radish.  I'll be honest, when a Korean restaurant only serves 2 side dishes, usually I won't come back - I think that's what most people come for.

In all honesty I don't even remember what my dish was called, it was beef with noodles in hot sauce, with ice.  For what it was, it was done very well.  

My mom ordered a beef soup - with a clear broth.

For what this is, it's done beautifully.  
However, I think this restaurant caters more towards Koreans, as the dishes are more traditional.
I might come back because it's close by to try the pork bone soup.  And the wait staff are very friendly."}
{"text":"Even with an address, I could not find Sinchon Food while I drove around the strip plaza, maybe my Yelp Friend is trying to play a trick on me.. maybe the address is for a special massage parlour? Then out of the corner of my eyes I saw some Korean words, and Sinchon Food is tucked in at a corner inside the strip Mall. 

All the Sinchon Food's waitresses kept speaking Korean to me then finally realized all I understand were welcome and thank you and good bye and you are cute.... 

Waitress: First Time? 
Me: Yes 
Waitress: Menu on the table layer.. what do you want? Lunch Special? 
Me: (Confused) Can I have a minute? 

Ended up Sinchon Food has one speciality... everyone order the same thing, especially when the weather is chilly... 

Sul Lung Tang - Beef Bone Soup ($7.95) a milky, cloudy soup with wheat flour noodles serves with rice. You can order either with brisket, tongue, tripes, knee caps, tail.. this really reminds me of Vietnamese Pho :) 

The Soup is served unseasoned as one can use the sea salt and pepper on the table to season according to your own preferences. If you like it spicy, the waitress can get you the red chili paste... I saw the older couple asked for it in Korean. Beef Bone Soup supposed to have simmered for over 12 hours and have this comforting effect and give Korean the I am at home vibe.... 

Only a few piece of beef brisket in my soup, but I think the star supposed to be the soup... yes it was really tummy warming and especially you are a soup person!! 

For Dinner, Sinchon Food serves more family style like in a big hot pot starting from $27.. I guess no one should be eating dinner by themselves and it is all about sharing food with families and friends over some soju!

Sinchon Food is really a Korean franchise with world wide location!"}
