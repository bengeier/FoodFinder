{"text":"Overall experience 5/5  Service 5/5: very goodThe manager/owner was very attentive. As soon as we were running out of tea, he came right away to fill it up and he was very nice and patient when we were ordering.  They have a large menu..i felt pretty overwhelmed because i didn't know what to order, but thankfully my cousin (Yelper Z) was there to recommend some dishes.  Atmosphere 5/5: pretty nice. It's not super fancy inside, but it was comfortable.   FOOD:  Appetizer: Satay mock chicken kabobs- 4.5/5 So...here's my problem...IT TASTED PERFECT...but as soon as i finish eating it...which was in a few seconds..my throat and tongue became itchy...(YUPPP, i didn't know that satay was a coconut/peanut sauce)..thankfully i didn't have a serious allergic reaction....   Mains: Sweet and sour chicken - 4.5/5....loved it,..enough to share it with another person...however it was a bit too sweet..thank goodness my cousin told me to order the lemon chicken to balance it out  Lemon chicken - 4.5/5...  i appreciate how they put the sauce to the side. There's nothing worse then someone drenching the 'meat' and ruining the whole dish.    Final thought: LOVED EVERYTHING! I CAN'T WAIT TO GO BACK! infact...i'm going to go back next week! =D =D =D I'll post up pictures soon."}
{"text":"Wow. What service! Extremely fast and helpful.  It is very clean and well lit.  We came around lunch time but did not order any lunch specials.  The lunch specials were very cheap, however, you cannot do a special order.  There was not a long wait for the food. It came quite fast and it was very good.  We've ordered rice, fried 'chicken' with sweet and sour sauce, fish taro, gluten appetizers. Everything was great! I would recommend this restaurants for celebrations like birthdays or special occasion or even just for lunch."}
{"text":"Been going here for about a year since my family is buddist and they have to eat vegetarian food at least once a month. This is probably the only good vegetarian restaurant i enjoy. Best and unique dishes you will ever find! Usually come here for dinner and i love their menu. Everytime i go, i like to try a new dish. It's amazing how they can make tofu taste and look like REAL meat. It's really fantastic here!"}
{"text":"Great service and great food! Large menu means plenty of choice - something vegetarians don't often get! This is often our restaurant of choice for special occasions. Attentive servers - all questions are answered respectfully and their recommendations are helpful. Ask for the \"special\" menu if you want something different - there are even more traditional dishes that aren't on the English menu. Love the chicken with black bean sauce in hot pot, chinese broccoli with ginger sauce and beef with black pepper sauce. Great place!!"}
{"text":"This is the only restaurant I do not have to worry about which dim sum item does not contain meat or fish - this is a vegetarian/ vegan place!!! I wish I have more room in my stomach to sample all their dim sum items, they are just splendid! I had dinners there several times too.  I just love their quality of food and presentation.  The location might not be convenient for people living downtown, but it is worth having a ride there for a good meal. I will be back for more & more!"}
{"text":"best service in my entire life. the people are so so respectful and kind.  beautiful,delicious food. omg. this place is a palace. make sure to come."}
{"text":"My FAVORITE vegetarian restaurant.  My best friend is a vegan and swears by their food too!!!"}
{"text":"I have tried 2 vegetarian restaurants of this style thus far (this and lotus pond) and I have to say that this one is superior.  When I went, the staff was very quick to serve us and friendly enough. I (as usual) ordered the wrong thing (mock seafood chow mein.. really?) and wasn't that happy with my seafood, which is why this place is not getting 5 stars. My boyfriend ordered the mock steak and LOVED it though, the sauce was unusual and tasty, and the mock-meat was soft and went well with the sauce. The appetizers that we ordered were also really good (I don't exactly remember what, some sort of chicken skewers). I blame being dissatisfied with my own meal on my own choice (because mock seafood probably tastes horrible no matter where you go), and I would definitely go back!  The atmosphere is really nice also, and everything looks very clean. The only complaint I have is that this place was slightly difficult to find (and when I say slightly, I mean that I was driving around plazas on steeles for like a half hour until I found it)... but this could just be me being bad with directions ;]"}
{"text":"If you like chinese food and you are a  vegetarian, you will love this place!   In the past, my impression of chineses vegetarian food is a bunch of greasy vegetables and with lots of starch. This place has changed how I view this cuisine.  I go to this place 3-4 times a year, I'm sure I'd have gone more often if 1. my family member likes vegetarian food 2. I live in the neighborhood (yay, every single visit of this restaurant is a well planned day trip to Scarborough area and have to get myself mentally prepared for the long drive and annoying traffic)  I have been to this place for both lunch and dinner. For lunch, they have a good variety of dim sum to choose from. All dishes are delicately prepared. You will recognized a lot of the similar items as a regular dim sum place, but you will be amazed how it could be replicated with veggie and starch.  They taste almost just like regular dim sum! All dishes are really hot when they bring it to your table. The environment is clean and overall very quiet because tables are mostly for set-up for small groups (4-6 people).  I really like plain stuff sometimes, and buns.  One of my favourites is their multi-grain steam bun! I like their steamed milk dessert too.   For dinner, they have lots of really good dishes, cooked in Chinese style. E.g. vegetarian ham wrapped with lettuce...vegetarian chicken  I can't remember what I ordered, but a lot of the chefs recommendations are yummy!"}
{"text":"Being a vegetarian.. the only thing i miss about meat, is the savoury marinades and sauces used..but its all here at graceful vegetarian !!!  one of my favourites here is the lemon chicken, SATAY CHicken SKEWERS, sweet n sour chicken,  and lots of others.... i would say their dim sum is ''arriiite'' , like someone said here, one of them is mushy-ish  Also some advice... to save money skip the fried rice and just order a small bowl of white rice,( their fried rice is overpriced in my opinion)... their individual small bowls of rice, is waaaaaaay cheaper n good enough for me  i like going to this restaurant knowing i can order anything on the menu that is allll vegetarian.. so many choices ...!  if your a vegetarian ...visit this place! especially when u miss those 'lemon' 'sweet n sour' sauces - marinades MMMMMMMMmmmmmmmmmmm !!!"}
{"text":"When I stopped eating meat, giving up giant dim sum brunches with my family was the hardest thing.  This place was my only consolation!  Even my father, who seems to have an innate distrust of mock-meats, was willing to eat here, and with good reason--the food here is really good.  Really really good.    I've since started eating meat, but I'll still make the trip to Pacific Mall whenever someone suggests we go here.  Try the turnip cakes--they're so good."}
{"text":"My husband brought me food from there that I ordered over the phone. I ordered the lemon chicken and sweet and sour chicken. The sweet and sour chickn looked like the photos and tasted ok...in my opinion not enough batter. The lemon chickn was ridiculous. I got about 15 pieces of dried up chickn with the tiniest of little lemon sauce on the side. I mean tiny. If I had been the one picking up this food I would not have paid for it. Oh well I guess I am out 30 dollars. You live and learn. Maybe the food is better when you actually eat there than take out. I will stick with Zen Gardens from now on."}
{"text":"This place is amazing, some of the waitress don't speak English but the gentleman that speak English is very nice and food is good."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant! I drive up whenever I have access to a car for a few days, and get our fix of vegan dim sum. It's worth the wait-I think it's my fourth visit in just over a  year. Vegan mock sui mai, har goi (etc.) are fantastic! The prices are great,  and the staff are so accomodating. I tell everyone I know about this place-delicious! (from downtown to richmond hill.. it's worth the trek!)"}
{"text":"I've eaten vegetarian Chinese before, but not quite like what this place serves up.  The quality of the food they deliver is excellent.  I can honestly say that there were times where I couldn't even tell that it was vegetarian.  For example, there is a dish in which they bring a hot stone bowl and pour in what looks to be beef and a Japanese mushroom.  The vegetarian \"beef\" looks and tastes like beef, but is made of gluten (as is most vegetarian Chinese substitutes).  I even had a vegetarian shark fin soup that was flavorful.  Overall, it was a great dining experience and I would come back here again.  The staff are great.  Courteous, prompt, and efficient."}
{"text":"I went here with Elise R. and it was nice to know that this place is a vegetarian restaurant, so we could eat anything from the menu.  It is nice to not have to ask for substitutions or worry about that when you are placing your order.  This place was relatively hard for us to find we had to call them to figure it out, although the address is marked as Steele's Ave, it is actually facing Kennedy, it is behind Pacific Mall, behind Market Village.  There was lots of room to be sit and you get a menu that is in English you write down how many of what you want and they bring it to you as the dishes start to get ready.  Food was flavourful, although their Spring Rolls could be better, I'm picky when it comes to spring rolls mostly because I've been spoilt by my parents who can make some pretty mean spring rolls.  Tea was included with our order which was nice (Jasmine Tea)  I will most likely go back if I am in the area,  it is a little out of my way but all vegetarian Dim Sums? why not? Lets go!"}
{"text":"Only been to this restaurant once since I'm not a vegetarian. It is located on the west side of market village facing Kennedy rd.  The staff were extremely friendly and their service were timely as well.  You pretty much can't go wrong with any dishes but I would recommend that you as a larger group; maybe 6+.  The dishes are quite expensive and you won't be able to order smaller sizes so the bigger the party the more dishes you can try out.  It was quite dead inside last time I was there but don't be fooled... the dishes are good and worth a try.  Cheers."}
{"text":"A really good vegetarian restaurant if you live outside of Toronto.  It's located right across Pacific Mall so the parking may be hard to come by depending on which days you go.  The menu at first look is overwhelming.  Nothing is really grouped together properly so it might take you a good 5 minutes to carefully look over the dishes.   There are so many items on the menu as well.  They have a good variety of vegetarian and vegan dishes so it will appeal to everyone.  Lots of mock meat dishes.  My favourites  are the ham and vegetables on a potato nest and the popcorn chicken with lemon sauce.  One of the best things about the dishes is that the vegetables are so fresh.  Their hot pots are amazing as well.  The service is good and the food comes out fast.  The only downside to the restaurant is that it's a bit over priced.  The address for the restaurant is different.  The actual address is 7131 Kennedy Rd.  Hope that helps."}
{"text":"The staff are very nice and helpful. They helped us with suggestions. We ordered hot and sour soup and loved it.   The food was served really quick and tasted good. Food was not very spicy or greasy. Should try this place if looking for vegetarian option. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"This place gives the meaning of veggie delight!   The mister and I came to the outskirts of Toronto to celebrate the mister's great aunt 80th birthday. The families booked 4 large tables for aunt's celebration. In the past, I have been to very few vegetarian places. I love to eat veggies, but eating real vegetables, not the vegetarian chicken. Usually, they put too much salt and seasonings in making vegetarian duck, beef, etc., which I dislike.   But Graceful Vegetarian does veggies right. Not too salty and hey, this tastes like chicken. We had 10 courses for this banquet dinner. So the mister and I left with 10lbs of veggies in our stomachs.   Here is list:  1. Appertizers: Squid, Duck., and Sliced Meats ( yes, it's vegetarian)  2. Shrimps and Sliced Fish with String Beans 3. Fried Potato Basket with Chicken and assorted veggies 4. Shark Fin Soup 5. Abalone on bok choy 6. Fried Taro with Crab Claw inside - yum  7. Assorted mushrooms on bok choy. 8. Scrambled Eggs Whites with Corn over broccoli  9. Seafood and veggies over noodles and fried rice  10. OMG the desserts!: Steamed red bean buns, sweet red bean soup, sweet fried crispy noodles in honey, and gelatin round patties.   You would think eating veggies is healthier but not here! The mister and I overate to the point that we could not walk. Graceful Vegetarian has an elegant ambiance and a great place for celebrations. I would recommend to all even meat eaters. Service was outstanding and attentive!"}
{"text":"The place is Closed. The surrounding dwellings are Closed. The mall looks run down... Disappointment.."}
{"text":"SO glad I had a chance to come here before they close and move to a different location. Decided to eat here with a friend who's vegetarian after seeing that it's one of the more popular restaurants in the area. Honestly, I didn't expect to enjoy the dim sum as much as the traditional ones I usually go to, but was proven very wrong.  All of the dishes we ordered were excellent. Despite there being no meat or seafood, everything was flavourful and tasted on point. Portions were much larger than I thought they would be, having heard that vegetarian restaurants charge a higher premium than normal. While it's true that the price point can't compare to those early morning specials at dim sum places, the quality of the food (and the overall experience) made it worth it.  I must also point out that service was EXCEPTIONAL. We were seated and given tea right away, but no one rushed us for orders even though we took a while. No one rushed us after eating, either. Empty plates were cleared regularly to make space on the table. They even packed our leftovers for us after I indicated we were finished! Most importantly, the servers were always smiling and warm and made us feel extremely comfortable the entire time. The ambience was also great - calm, nicely decorated, decent spacing between tables.  Will definitely be keeping a watch on this place and trying to convince my non-vegetarian friends to give it a try! Fingers crossed that they're not relocating to Vaughan or something..."}
{"text":"If you are vegetarian or just avoiding mystery meat dumplings all together, Graceful Vegetarian is a nice option!  We arrived at 10:15am to find out they open at 11am on Sunday. It is conveniently located at Pacific Mall, so you can wander around before or after your meal.  The restaurant is clean, bright, and much more elegant than expected.  The service was attentive for a Chinese restaurant.  There were only a few tables with customers, the restaurant is quiet and less hectic than most other dim sum places.  We tried a few items but I can't say any of the items were amazing. The BBQ buns (similar to BBQ pork buns but vegetarian) were hot and steamy, but not as sweet at the meat equivalent.  The vegetarian \"shrimp\" dumplings were mushy.   If you squished them with your chopsticks they almost fell apart.  The deep fried donut and rice noodle wasn't bad but very crispy.  My favorite item was probably the deep fried tofu! Then again, I like almost anything that is deep fried!  Overall, not a bad meal, but I probably wouldn't go out of my way to revisit."}
{"text":"My favourite vegetarian restaurant! The first time I came here, I was surprised at how realistic the mock meat dishes were. My favourites are the mock fish and the mock steak... very nice flavour, texture... and it even looks real! The food is seasoned nicely...  ... and it's not too salty or greasy. My mom wanted to find out what was in their sauces! Their satay chicken kebobs and walnut fried rice are quite tasty too. I also love the tapioca dessert. The only thing I am not a fan of is their hot pots, which seem a bit bland to me. Also, for a vegetarian restaurant, the dishes don't have a lot of actual veggies. Nonetheless, the food seems to be prepared well with care.   The service is very good... when you ask for something, it arrives promptly, and they are very accommodating.    It's a bit pricey, and the portion sizes are small compared to other restaurants for the price, especially if you compare this place to the nearby Ginger and Onion Cuisine (which is super duper cheap), but it's far from expensive I definitely recommend a visit here!"}
{"text":"Food was just okay. We got the spicy eggplant with bean curd and stir fried veggies. The spicy eggplant was with tofu and was really good. However, the veggies were undercooked and no flavour. Was really hard for me to choose something I wanted since the fake meat contained gluten (I have a gluten allergy). Prices seemed really over priced for what you got. For two main courses with two rice bowls it was $40"}
{"text":"Graceful Vegetarian Restaurant specializes in \"mock meat\" dishes and offer a large array of vegetarian/vegan items.   Decor/Atmosphere: I usually do takeout, but the decor is simple but clean and elegant. There is a lot of space and large ables for groups/families. I love that some of the tables have a lazy Susan in the middle - it is ideal for dim sum and family style food. The overall feel reminds me a lot of the restaurants I've been to in China.   Service: Service is great. Staff is very friendly and helpful. Food doesn't take too long and the quality is consistent.   Food: I've tried many items off of the menu. My favourites are spicy mock chicken hot pot and sweet and sour mock shrimp. I also recently tried the mock har gow and siu mai dim sum, and they were absolutely delicious. I haven't really had anything off the menu that I didn't like, but you definitely have to be open to trying out the fake meat to really get a full experience.   Price: Its definitely on the pricier end when it comes to Chinese food, but its completely worth it, because the food is such great quality and they offer such unique items.   Overall: I have been coming to GVR for over 10 years now, and I love it as much today as I did the first day I tried it. I highly recommend this restaurant to vegetarians and non-vegetarians that just like good food."}
{"text":"Have been going to this restaurant often, because a family member is a vegetarian. Completely breaks the stereotype that vegetarian food is bland and boring! High quality food, well plated, and excellent and polite service. Probably the best Chinese style vegetarian place. For those who do not like the \"mock meats\" there is still plenty to choose from vegetable and tofu wise (ex. fruit salad spring rolls=yum!). In addition, to the people that actually care, they have  good quality tea, and a decent selection as well. One downer is that you will be paying ALOT for the delicious veggies and well...gluten(what they use to make the mock meat). However, I believe it's worth every penny [especially since i never pay the bill in this restaurant ;) ]! And there's complementary dessert too btw.  I recommend: the fried milk (dessert), pumpkin (mock) sharkfin soup, classic sweet and sour pork (you won't believe its not meat!) and the lettuce wrap!"}
{"text":"This place has very good vegetarian food.  Worth a try if you have not been here.  Prices are not cheap but reasonable."}
{"text":"Great staff and service, the food was ok, pricey and not nearly as good compared to The Buddhist vegetarian kitchen in Scarborough."}
{"text":"Have been eating at Graceful for several years now though not as often as I like.  IMHO it is the best vegetarian dim sum in the GTA.  Service is impeccable, very gracious and efficient.  Prices are a bit high but you get what you pay for.  Definitely try the mock chicken satay.  It is amazing.  Hot and sour soup, the red type,  is also very good.  I like how they have replicated a lot of typical dim sum dishes."}
{"text":"My aunt and uncle took me here yesterday for dim sum. I am a vegetarian and I've never had vegetarian dim sum before. I was very skeptical.   We ordered an abundance of food. My favourite dishes are the bbq pork buns, curry fish balls, chicken nuggets, pan fried roll noodles, taro fish, pakora, and veggies with ginger.   The service is probably the best I've ever experienced in a chinese restaurant.   Some of the reviews say the food is bland. I don't have that issue because I drown my food in hot sauce. I suggest you all do the same :)   I am excited to go back for dinner! Definitely give this place a try."}
{"text":"Normally i would NOT venture this far north. But since i was up there anyways, why not get some grub?  A vegetarian friend of mine highly recommended Graceful and the reviews on yelp were fantastic. They were right!  Annoyance first though... what a hard place to find! The address is Steeles, but it's not on Steeles at all! It's around the back of a mall on the side that faces Kennedy. Tricky, very tricky!  Once we did find it, and were seated, the graceful experience began :) The service was so attentive, and the restaurant was bright, clean and busy. We got a pot of green tea right away. Delicious. Then had veggie spring rolls for starters. They came out super hot (wait 'til they cool! Ouch!). Between us we had the mock steak w/honey & pepper sauce and the fried rice noodles w/XO sauce and mock beef. WOW!! I swear it's the best fake meat i've ever had! The mock steak w/honey pepper sauce was fantastic! I would have preferred the noodles w/XO sauce to be saucier, but it was still good. Although it was nothing compared to the honey pepper sauce (SO YUMMY).  The portions were good and large and I took the leftovers home with me. I couldn't resist dessert and we ordered the Honey Crispy Twists. Four little pieces of wontons, nice and crispy with hot honey drizzled over them. Simple and just what i wanted."}
{"text":"Wow! What an amazing restaurant. I've been a vegetarian for most of my life and finding good, vegetarian options can be very difficult. The fact that this restuarant is completely vegetarian was a pleasant surprise.  I contacted the resaurant before my visit to Toronto, as I really wanted to find a vegetarian version of sesame chicken (which is not an easy task). I immediately received not only a response, but a picture of their sesame 'chicken'. When I finally made it to the restaurant I was pleasantly greeted. My mom and I shared the 'chicken' satay, which was delicious. Our server also verified any food alergies, which was nice as someone with a peanut allergy.  The sesame 'chicken' was so good, that I broke my number one rule of traveling, and returned a second time. In addition to the sesame 'chicken' I worked with the same server from the day before to create a personalized udon noodle dish. It, too, was delicious.  What really sold me on this restaurant was the fact that the server remembered our conversation from the first day (going to the zoo to visit the panda cubs) and truly made me feel welcomed in the restaurant. The menu is diverse and the service very attentive."}
{"text":"My cousin took me here for dim sum as she is Vegetarian, and I was quite surprised by the extent of options on the menu. Overall a good experience but, I have yet to be wowed by anything particular yet so, I will have to come back and try more items!"}
{"text":"The vegetarian food here is decent. We ordered the eggplant stir fry and the sweet and sour mock chicken. The eggplants were great! However, the sweet and sour chicken was quite disappointing. The oil left over from the frying process did not taste fresh and the coating for the chicken tasted off.   Service is average for a Chinese restaurant, which is sub par for an average Canadian eatery. They also do not accept credit cards.  Overall, I would stick to the eggplant and their other vegetable based dishes if I choose to venture here again."}
{"text":"Love this place. The food is great. I have yet to try something that I don't like. I think they really shine in the 'mock' meat section. That's pretty much what my vegetarian mother likes to order from them. I would definitely recommend it for vegetarians looking for other options. The only downfall is that they are pretty expensive for the amount of food you get."}
{"text":"This place is soooo good! Unfortunately, it suffers from a problem unique to Chinese cuisine: too much choice. Whenever I go here, I need someone else to make the executive decisions for me, as I'm always overwhelmed by the sheer variety of dishes that they offer -- and considering that all of them are vegetarian means I'm left with many decisions... Frequently, I'm unaware of what's coming next, and despite this, I'm always delighted."}
{"text":"My friend is a vegan so i looked on yelp for good vegetarian or vegan places and this place had some good reviews. I'm very pleased with our visit. The food tasted great, although i would recommend to stay away from sweet and sour mock pork because it was basically just a dough ball, and stay away from any mock shrimp because it had a very unpleasant texture and taste it was very weird. But other than that all the other foods were amazing. The flavour in every dish was amazing. All the mock meat made of tofu was really really good. The fried rice was a little bland but still very good. At the end we got the black sesame soup dessert. It wasn't as thick as i thought it would be, not really worth 4.50 but it was still good. Overall i would definitely come again."}
{"text":"This is one of the best vegetarian restaurants for dim sum that my family has ever had. There are numerous varieties of dim sum dishes that are tasty.  Their service deserves a full 5 stars for their friendliness, prompt service, polite staff who bring your food and the owners are very nice one of the them offered to help us take a family photo after seeing us attempt to do a selfie.  We ordered a few dishes from their dinner menu and the food was average as it lacked slightly in flavour and the rice noodle dish came with a lot of noodles but very little vegetables.  The tofu casserole dish lacked salt and flavour.  Ever since we started going here we have been going back 5 times for their dim sum."}
{"text":"First time visitor and a beginner vegetarian. Have been trying to find good eats in Markham area and this was on top of the yelp listings.  The restaurant is great as are the staff, but pricing for some items are not worth what you get. I am also gluten intolerant and the staff advised me not to order anything that had a mock meat in case I were to react. So that left me with 10%of the menu to choose from. Not many choices that were worth eating out for... Especially for their prices."}
{"text":"Rare is the place that I can pick anything on the menu.  I wish I could try one of everything here, but stomach not so big. The food is wonderful, though some items can be a slight too oily and salty if you are sensitive to those things."}
{"text":"On a normal basis, I typical avoid strictly vegetarian food-it never appeal to me or the people I tend to dine with. Rarely do I enjoy an all veggie meal. I did so at Graceful Vegetarian Restaurant. Though there are a lot of mock meat dishes, you have to remember to take most of the description with a grain of salt, try to remember that these are standalone dishes by their own rights-and are not meant to be compared in likeness to their meaty counterparts. With that being said...we also, all need to remember that it the sheer cost of time and energy put into these tiny dishes to perfect the taste and texture of various type of soy to make it palatable in for many ways.   The food was very well prepared and tasted of quality. We came late before closing (yes, we were one of those dreaded diners that night) with very little expectation of being blown away. We ordered only a few dishes-there were some misses and some were great hits. Even the misses had redeeming factors, it was just not for me. As a small app, we decided to go with the jelly fish, the texture was not exactly alike and was a bit tough and chewy, yet the marination the went with it was very pleasing. The Siu mai was delish, once again not exact but was none the less a strong alternative to actual pork siu mai. The hai gow was where I felt it was lacking, though my boyfriend loved it. The skin was well made but the filling was made to replicate the looks of shrimp but fell short on texture-it came out rubbery and tasted as so. My absolute favourite dish was the mock sweet and sour pork, it could've rivaled its counterpart. Most ill-prepared sweet and sour pork can be over-fried to achieve its crispy exterior leaving the meat dried and rubbery or sometimes, restaurant cut cost by going with a lower grade meat that once prepared, taste stringy and almost gamey. This, however, the sauce was a lovely combination with the crispy, slightly chewy (in a good way) fried pieces of soy gluten-crispy battered exterior and lovely juicy interior.   The restaurant was very nicely decorated-clean and bright. The price is steep but justifiable because of the quality. It was a nice change of pace-it's not any healthy but a nice alternative to meaty Chinese cuisine. You should come in for a try when you're feeling a case of the fancy or simply want to try something new yet familiar."}
{"text":"What kind of sorcery is this?  This place was recommended to me by a meat eater so I had to check it out.  Most items here are either vegan or can be veganized upon request. I tried out their spicy chicken hotpot. It has the taste and the texture of real chicken. Safe to say this is the best mock meat I have ever had.  Fancy place. Good for groups and events. Quick & friendly service.  I strongly recommend this place to everyone especially those who think that a vegan lifestyle is extreme and restrictive. Next time I will try their sweet & sour chicken / pork."}
{"text":"My sister is vegetarian, so I've been to many vegetarian restaurants and this one is the only one I'd be down to go again. Service was professional and I liked the appetizers and tofu. My sister did the ordering so I'm not exactly sure which dishes I ate."}
{"text":"Did not like any of their dim sum including the pork bbq buns and overly oily eel. Almost identical ingredients were used to make the siu mai, ha gouw and dumplings which tasted similarly disgusting. Giving a few stars at least for the flavour in the baked tomato and rice with imitation meat dish as well as for the attentive service. However, the rice was too heavy unlike at most Chinese restaurants where it is usually lighter."}
{"text":"When I lived in the Detroit area, my family and I would find an excuse to drive three hours north to eat here.  The excuse being \"OK I'm hungry.\"  We're 75% vegetarian; the remaining 25% is vegetarian by proxy.  Anyway the entire menu is vegetarian, and the vast majority is delicious, pretty authentic, and non-oily!  They offer popular dim sum dishes, mock beef, chicken, duck, and even fish, with realistic flavor and texture (which is a little startling after 10+ years of being a vegetarian).  My personal favorite is the mock beef hotpot.  Since moving out to the SF Bay Area, which is a veg-haven in itself, I've held every restaurant to the standard of this place.  So far its variety and quality is unmatched."}
{"text":"My favorite place for veggie Chinese. I am not a vegetarian and usually hate veggie, but my wife is a vegetarian so we come here a lot, and I really enjoy it. The menu is vast, food is really flavourful, the service is impeccable, and the mock meat is so good, the restaurant is good for regular chinese food lovers (like me). How they make so many vegetarian items taste so good ans unique is astounding. To top it off the place is run by two great restaurateurs: Allan and Ken. These guys work so hard to make their customers happy.  Note: Veggie Chinese is more expensive than regular Chinese, they do not cook with any garlic or onion, as veggie chinese caters to Chinese Buddhists who do not eat meat, or onion, or garlic."}
{"text":"Garbage. It was my mother's birthday, we spent almost $500 a table. We read the set menu, and expected something spectacular.. This was not the case. Every dish that came out tasted EXACTLY the same - flavorless. Seemed like the chef slapped the food together within seconds. The presentation was terrible.  If disappointment is what you're looking for, search no more.  All in all, we felt ripped off. We will never go again."}
{"text":"We have been going for Dim Sum at Graceful Vegetarian Restaurant for years! We drive from the Port Credit area of Mississauga for the wonderful vegetarian food and the great service. There is a wide diversity of dim sum options, which is rare and wonderful for me as a vegetarian. I have not found better vegetarian dim sum in the GTA! We have always been welcomed like family and the staff have known our kids since they were babies. I highly recommend Graceful Vegetarian Restaurant!"}
{"text":"In the category of vegetarian restaurants, I feel this place deserve a five stars for their food. I had low expectation for this type of imitation meat restaurants, but this place did it well.  The steamed dishes were great, highly recommend the stewed beef with daikon dish.  The imitation fish on the fried noodles was amazing with great texture."}
{"text":"DEEE-licious! and the best service I have experienced in any restaurant.   Price is a bit high though. but overall, very satisfied."}
{"text":"It was quite busy the day we went for dinner. Smaller restaurant but lots of tables and staffed well. The Ford carnet out in good time but we weren't a fan. Dishes were either under seasoned or over seasoned. Prices are higher given we're in Markham and there's lots of competition. Probably wouldn't go back unless we had to."}
{"text":"Finally! A good quality vegetarian restaurant! Who would have thought Vegetarian and Chinese would go together!?! I discovered this restaurant probably close to ten years ago, when I first became vegetarian. Every birthday or special occasion, this is the restaurant I would pick to go.   The quality of the food here is the highest of any restaurant i've been to. The quality has waned a little the last two times I visited, but it's still far above other chinese restaurants. They have the vegetarian versions of popular chinese dishes like Har Gow, Sui Mei, BBQ pork buns, and rice noodle rolls, amongst other dishes.    They use soy based products as meat replacement. A lot of it tastes pretty similar to the real thing, such as their mock chicken and beef.  Others, while it still tastes good, it has it's own flavour (the mock shrimp).    Try their Zin-Zang fried rice or their baked porkchop rice, both pretty excellent.   The spring rolls are equally good too. If you're in the daring mood or want to try something new, this place is worth checking out for sure!"}
{"text":"If you are vegetarian, you never get to truly enjoy dim sum, so for all you veggies, this place is dim sum heaven. They have a meat free version of nearly anything you've ever wanted, including butterfly :) The chairs are covered in fabric like you're at a wedding and the servers are cute and friendly. The whole experience is entertaining and fun."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice. As a vegetarian it was quite refreshing and all the dishes were creative and delicious. Staff were polite. Definitely coming back.  I thought the mock Chicken kabobs and the sweet and sour mock pork were great."}
{"text":"Ambience & Decor: Ethnic, traditional. Service: Service is very good. The staff are welcoming. Some of the waitresses are not fluent in English but the men who run the place do speak it fluently. Food: Very good. This is the place for vegetarians & questions about menu items are answered. They don't seen to have egg-free noodles on the menu, though. Maybe they can substitute egg free noodles? It would also be nice if they added vegetarian congee to the menu. Graceful Vegetarian - a vegetarian friendly place."}
{"text":"I tried this great restaurant based on the ratings that previous yelpers gave it... and I am not sorry I did.   I had a bit of a tricky time trying to find the place since I am not that familiar with this part of the city. But basically if you go in the Pacific Mall parking lot and just keep driving around it, eventually you'll find it. It is in the building behind the mall.  I was keen on this place because last week I opted out of going to a different dim sum restaurant (that serves meat) with my (meat eating) sisters because I don't speak the language and can't decipher between what is vegetarian and what isn't. BUT at THIS place, I get to order anything. In fact, I even picked a number at random for one of the dishes we tried.   While everything is vegetarian, the menu is in english too so you can know what you are ordering. And if you have any questions, the servers speak english very well and can help you out.   The menu is at the table when you are seated. It is paper and you just write a number beside the dish you want corresponding to the quantity of that dish you would like. I probably don't need to explain this as it is pretty intuitive, but at least you know what you are getting into before going.   I ordered the spring rolls, Shanghai dumplings, deep fired pumpkin and stuffed buns. All items were delicious. But my favourite were the dumplings.   The place was very clean and the service was excellent. Overall it was a pleasant experience and I will be going back. Next time my sisters are in a dim sum mood I know where to suggest. =)  When you are done eating, you can always stop in at the market in the adjacent building and pick up some more stuffed buns or dumplings to reminisce on your experience at a later date."}
{"text":"This has got to be the best Vegetarian Dim Sum place I've ever had the pleasure to eat at.!! I've really only been there for their dim sum but I've heard from a hardcore meat eater, the fake meat there tastes better than the real deal. HA!  One dish that I completely fell in love with and can't get enough of is the Turnip Cake with XO sauce. It is cooked to perfection and generous amount of spice. Try it!"}
{"text":"We're extremely anxious and glad that this restaurant finally re-opens in the new location.   We're particularly fan of the dim sum at Graceful. The cooking is truly above most dim sum joint in Markham (despite being a vegetarian restaurant). The finesse of each dishes, the balance of flavors, the restraint use of oil / grease are much a welcome addition.    Going to Graceful and enjoying each dishes is an experience that you cannot replicate anywhere else. In each dishes, you often wonder how do they make the \"mock meat\" so close to the real thing while only utilizing plant-based product and while tasting so good and refreshing. Leaving Graceful each time will leave you feeling very satisfied and somehow refreshing!  Recommended / favorite dishes for Dim Sum - Shark fin soup (mock) - Rice in clay pot with mock salted fish - Friend Wonton with Sweet and Sour soup - Mock Goose Meat - Mock tender beef with turning  We truly are a fan and will be coming to Graceful for years to come.   Oh, we forgot to mention that the service in this restaurant is arguably the best from any Chinese restaurant we encounter!"}
{"text":"If you are exploring vegan options, this restaurant is a perfect place to do it. TIP: if you're a die hard carnivore, don't come here expecting the \"meats\" to taste exactly like the real thing; instead, keep your mind open and enjoy the different textures,  delicious flavors, and the knowledge that no animals were hurt in the making of your meal.  Hidden away in the back recesses of the same  lot as Pacific Mall. There is a Chinese Vegan restaurant that's nicely decorated, with warm lighting and a friendly host/server/manger. It was cold and rainy but Kam welcomed me with a smile and nice hot pot of green tea.  My party of 11 arrived soon after and we were seated at a large table with a lazy Susan, ideal for our upcoming foodfest. When we ordered, Kam asked about any food allergies and assured us that any vegetarian item on the menu could be made completely vegan. We shared 8 entrees among ourselves and tried mock shrimp, roast pork, and jellyfish; we were all pleasantly full and satisfied at the end of our meal. My friends and I enjoyed our time together, the food and the stellar service here. If the owners are reading this, you need to give Kam a raise because he took excellent care of us.  They will be closing this location by December 3, 2017 and relocating. Please check their Facebook page for their new address."}
{"text":"Love this place. Fast service and cheap vegetarian/vegan food. Their meat alternatives really taste similar to the actual product - so much so that we had to ask if it was legitimately meat free. Give it a try! Just don't order their smoked tofu wrap (something along those lines) - it tastes terrible!"}
{"text":"First time trying out this place and I have to say I am really impressed! The flavours are great and there's nothing to complain about. Will be coming back to try out more dishes."}
{"text":"Best Turnip/Radish cake (or whatever you call it). Hands Down...better than any other restaurant/dim sum place i've been to.  Dinner and dim sum is good here. I like their creativity and it tastes good too. Way better than any vegan restaurant you can go to in the annex!"}
{"text":"I came here for my friend's bday. This was a second time that I've be been. But the difference was 10+ years. Can't really recall how it was back than. But I remember my huband left hungry lol. 10+ years later I'm here again, we ordered quite a few dishes to try. It was a variety of dim sum and side dishes.  We Ordered: Mock Duck with Jelly like Noodles. Mock Jellyfish Stir fry Turnip Cake Steam Bun with Mock Meat & Crispy Bean Curd Deep Fried Mock Shirmp Balls Mocked Japanese Grilled Eel Mock Seafood Jumbo Dumpling in Soup Mock Shrimp Ha Gow Steamed Tapioca Pudding Cakes Baked Mango Pudding  Overall, all the food was quite good. My fave one was the steam bun with mock meat and crispy bean curd. I love the contrast of textures."}
{"text":"I came here to try some vegan food. We were in a rush as my buddy needed to go. The service was fast and we were able to make it on time. I heard this place is closing up which is a sad this as the place looks nice organized and price is good.   I hope this place stay open and I came again to check it out."}
{"text":"Had dim sum here today, it's no where near what I'm use to. It's definitely not fresh, steamed food tastes from frozen and fried rolls tasted as if they had them sitting in the kitchen ready to serve, not fresh! The soy sauce by far was the worst, not sure what kind they use but it's very pungent. I could not finish eating my meal. Only upsides was the tea and that it was not expensive."}
{"text":"it's kinda expensive here.  food can be very starchy.  i am talking about the dim sum stuff or dumpling skins....doughy and chewy.  everything is made freshl though.  service is okay, very courteous.  this place would not be my primary choice for chinese vegetarian food.  i go here once in a blue moon."}
{"text":"This place blew my mind.   I am a big meat eater. Everyone who knows me, knows this. But it was my cousins birthday and she and her husband are vegetarians and they chose the restaurant. I would have never chose this place on my own.   This place is completely vegetarian, even the seafood dishes are created with mock seafood meat. Some of the dishes were really comparable to actual meat. Some dishes that stood out for us were the Deep Fried Spare Ribs and the Jellyfish dish. How did they get it so spot on?  The dish to stay away from is the siu mai. The texture and taste of that wasn't the best.   Service here was really good too, servers are attentive and kind which you don't always get at a Chinese restaurant.  5 stars for really impressing me - without meat."}
{"text":"I'm pretty much as far as a vegetarian as you can get without mainlining bacon fat into my veins - but m'lady be a vegetarian and I wanted dim sum in Markham, so Graceful was the compromise.  I'm treating this place as fairly as possible for what it is and in comparison to other vegetarian places I've been to - it's pretty middle of the road.  I'm not sure if it's the Buddhist influence, but the food is pretty bland.  If you've tried Chinese 'faux' meats before, you may be impressed with their efforts to approximate the full meat experience - but the food was a lot better and more creative at places like Joe Yee (now closed)   The two of us ordered 8 dim sum dishes - the total came to $40 with tax and tip ($3 - $5 per dish) and we were stuffed, but neither of us were satisfied.  Pretty pricey compared to normal dim sum, but I guess they are serving a niche market.  The har gow ('shrimp dumpling') was extremely thick skinned and was starchy - 'faux' filling notwithstanding, this was off to a bad start.  The sui mai ('pork meatball') had an odd sticky texture.  Xiao long bao ('Shanghai soup dumpling') are usually sucky even at a regular dim sum places (you really have to go to a good specialist for this) -- but the XLB here was bad even by dim sum XLB standards - had no soupy or savoury element at all, just a slight ginger hit.  I won't have been able to guess they were try to imitate XLB if I ate it blind.  The passable items were the smoked 'duck' which bean curd wrapped veggies with a strong taste of smoke - not like duck at all, but at least it was interesting.  And the deep-fried items were not bad - but I noticed most Chinese vegetarian places do a good job of faking deep-friend things - so this might be inherent.  Oddly, the best thing we had the chicken nugget.  If you fed this to most people and didn't tell them, they would probably think they were eating a pretty good chicken nugget from the freezer section at a grocery store.  So - I guess this was good?  This was my first time having faux meat dim sum, and it was pretty bland.  Even when accounting for the inherent difficulties of attempting vegetarian dim sum - things like thick dumpling skins are big mistakes.  While the most of dim sum looked the part, many of the textures/tastes were very off.  I will say that the service was excellent and it's hard to slam people for trying something as ambitious as this.  But like Icarus, they flew too close to the sun... on wings made of dyed, reshaped and poorly flavoured tofu."}
{"text":"The best Chinese vegetarian restaurant in the York Region.  High class decoration with good service.  Delicious food and capable to do banquets.  I brought my Muslim and Indian coworkers here, and they all loved the food here."}
{"text":"Hands down, this is the best Chinese vegetarian restaurant I've had in the GTA.  I've been here on occasion for both dim sum and for dinner. The dishes are a lot more varied and unique when compared to the nearby Lotus Pond. Flavours are a lot more refined without an overreliance on greasy sauces or heavy seasoning. The chicken kabobs are one of my all-time favourites.   If you're vegan most of the menu selection is vegan and many of the items can be made without eggs. I have brought my vegan friend from out of town here on a couple occasions and whenever he comes back to TO this is one place he's sure to visit!"}
{"text":"Came here to try out some vegetarian dishes as my sister has been on her health kick lately.  I'm a carnivore so this wouldn't have been my first choice spot to dine in but I'm game to try anything new.    We arrived a little late for lunch so the restaurant was pretty well empty except for 1 other table.  The dining room is not huge but was bright and clean.  The wait staff are quite attentive and efficient.    We ordered deep-fried taro fish cake (crispy yumminess with sweet chili dipping sauce), vinegar marinaded black fungus (wood ear mushrooms soaked in light vinegar/soy based sauce), braised noodles with black fungus, melon and mock meat (very mildly seasoned but still tasty) and soy wrapper filled with chopped veggies (similar dim sum items are stuffed with meat and steamed at other dim sum places).  Overall, the food was good.  But you felt like you were eating a vegetarian meal which is not necessarily a bad thing.  I just wouldn't do it too often, that's all.    I would probably revisit this place with my mother-in-law as the flavour base here is something that she would very much enjoy.  Solid 3 stars."}
{"text":"Ate here again because we were bored of our old Dim Sum watering hole (Crown Prince). Ordered:  Har Gow (shrimp dumpling) Mock Pork Belly Fried Pumpkin rice noodle roll wrapped yu tiao (fried dough) BBQ Pork Bun chiu chow fun kor (peanut vegetable dumpling) Siu Mai steamed veg lotus leaf wrapped sticky rice Chili dumplings (that were drenched in soy sauce and not chili...) Tapioca Pudding  To be honest, was quite disappointed this time. The dumplings all fell apart and were sticky. BBQ Pork buns were still moist. Mock Pork belly was good, as was the fried pumpkin and the noodle roll. Everything else was not that great and came out pretty expensive compared to the cheaper Dim Sum options around the GTA.  Probably won't come back again for awhile if it's this inconsistent!"}
{"text":"Very pleasant, peaceful restaurant with very friendly and helpful service.  The food isn't amazingly delicious, but it's satisfying and there is a big menu with a lot to choose from.  I've never seen a vegetarian hotpot before, so that was a nice novelty."}
{"text":"When you live in a city with a huge Chinese population, you can most assuredly expect at least one vegetarian based Chinese restaurant in the area. Markham in fact has several, but this is the one I prefer to frequent.  Graceful Vegetarian has the standards that I would expect from a vegetarian Chinese restaurant. The assorted gluten, a staple of Chinese vegetarian dining, is available as an appetizer, and offers a wide variety of flavors mixed together. You can also in the mornings order vegetarian dim sum, which gives you things such as deep fried milk, taro fish, and vegetarian dumplings. The imitation meats there are surprisingly realistic, to the point that my friends and family thought we were eating real crab and real chicken.  Compared to some of the more modern vegetarian Chinese restaurants, Graceful Vegetarian is more traditional, serving dim sum esque dishes. The flavors are very well done, but there's nothing out of the ordinary and no new fusion style dishes. The drinks are pretty good, and I did get the red bean ice which was very sweet.  I highly recommend this restaurant to any vegetarians who aren't gluten free and are looking to try quality Chinese food in the Greater Toronto Area."}
{"text":"3.5/5  I've visited Graceful a couple of times when I was little, but mainly stuck to Lotus Pond since their portions are larger. However, I had to go to Pacific Mall this past weekend, and to avoid driving all over the place I decided to have lunch at Graceful.  Lunch on Sunday wasn't too busy, but then again there was the freezing rain the night before, which might have explained the wealth of parking spots available. The server gave us the dim sum menu, however he didn't give us the giant menu book until we asked for it...tsk tsk.  We ordered siu mai, vegetarian abalone sashimi, sweet corn soup with mock ham, mixed mushroom fried noodles, and the vegetarian mix (medley of mock meats together...forgot the exact English term). I absolutely loved the abalone sashimi and the vegetarian mix, and would've ordered seconds or thirds if I were hungrier (I did buy a vegetarian mix home though). The siu mai was nothing memorable, and the sweet corn soup was decent, though the mock ham was too grainy (Lotus Pond has it exactly like chopped ham pieces). The biggest ripoff, however, was the mixed mushroom fried noodles...one person can easily finish the plate, yet it was around $16. The taste wasn't bad, but definitely nowhere near a $16 value.  I think my experience would've been better if I stuck solely to dim sum. The end result was around $68 for 3 people! If I take away the noodle dish it would only be around $50, which is the average I spend for dim sum for 3 people.  Our dessert also took a while to come out, and we had to ask the server to follow up twice on it. The sesame balls tasted very good though, so maybe it was worth the wait?  I'm torn between whether to add the .5 for not for service, as I found it to be overall borderline. I believe considering the cost factor I'll leave it at 3.5, and in my next visit if I had a better experience I'll upgrade to 4."}
{"text":"This place has the best service in all of Scarborough! I love their congee and the pricing is decent."}
{"text":"I can't believe I've never reviewed Graceful Vegetarian. This is my ultimate favourite vegetarian restaurant in Scarborough.   Graceful definitely has a special place in my heart; my family and I frequented it lot since my 20s. I cannot even count how many times we've eaten here. I've had major gatherings here, even including birthdays and post-funeral dinner. I've also ordered ginormous take-out orders for parties at my mother's house. The managers and the waiters here, although I still don't know their name, pretty much recognize me and also my entire family. They're always kind, prompt and respectful.   The food here is amazing, no matter what you order. Some of the regular dishes we get are the fried taro fish and porkchop fried rice (vegetarian with egg)."}
{"text":"Took a bunch of meat peeps to join me, since dim sum isn't usually something I can have, and absolutely no one was disappointed. People who expect meat are going to be let down. That's vegetarianism. Tofu will never be beef. But for vegetarian food (and especially dim sum) this place is great and one of the best I've had."}
{"text":"What an amazing restaurant! Clean, well organised menu and amazing speedy service. The quality is amazing everything came out hot and fresh.  Top choice and not to mention also vegetarian! Will come back."}
{"text":"I try to go here when I can. I absolutely love this place for a good meal.  I haven't been in year but I still crave it. It's just a bit of a drive for me to get there but it is worth while.   The dim sum is great and so are the main dishes."}
{"text":"Went there today after not being there for a while.  This place is good.  Refined Cantonese vegetarian dining.  Portions are not massive, and the food is prepared with care.  It is evident in the quality of the seasonings and the product itself.  Delicate tasting food - not sure how else to describe.  They strive for a quiet and relaxed dining experience.  It is a very welcoming place and a pleasant environment.  Small restaurant.  One of our favourites is the stuffed, braised tofu skin.  Never disappoints."}
{"text":"Fake meat costs more than real meat but I have to say the fake one worth a try! We had lotus fired rice, crab meat broccoli and eel  Eel is a must-try!  Unfortunately, today is the the first day in lunar calendar so the menu is limited  Will come back and try the other food"}
{"text":"A co-worker recommended this restaurant to me and am I ever glad that she did.  We thoroughly enjoyed our dim sum lunch this past Saturday.  The service was very fast and friendly and the food was excellent.  We liked or loved everything we had apart from the the fish balls in curry sauce (the texture was not to our liking).  I would highly recommend the rest:  hand stuffed butterfly mock steak (probably my favourite dish that we tried), sticky rice in lotus leaf, mock bbq pork buns, friend rice noodle rolls, deep fried curry samosa and deep fried tofu (my second favourite)."}
{"text":"Nice veggie restaurant, the dishes here were not too oily. Love the fresh tofu/ vegetables here, very close to the pacific mall"}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place! My hubby brought me here on one of our first few dates and we absolutely loved the food. It's great food for vegetarians who like tofu and mock meat. We have been back numerous times and also when I had cravings during pregnancy."}
{"text":"After a day of Christmas gourging, I went here on boxing day for a meat-free dim sum. Also being boxing day the restaurant was not very busy so I didn't have to wait for a table -- a rarity for dim sum.   The dim sum menu is fairly lengthy and most of the dishes sounds good. Service was incredibly polite, courteous and friendly. The waitor was pouring tea for the table so that he could get us another fresh pot, he was even apologizing for not getting our first plate out fast enough eventhough it wasn't that long ago that we placed our order. A lot of the menu seems to be vegan, though there are many dishes that were made of gluten, so if you are on a gluten-free diet or have allergies this may not be a good restaurant to go to.  Some good plates: Smoked mock duck - great smokey flavor and was wrapped in bean curd and shredded veggies. Glass drunken noodles were served on the side which were extremely slippery and was difficult to pickup with chopsticks. Mock Goose - eventhough the slices of mock goose resembled spam, it had a nice flavour and was also served with a side of glass drunken noodles. Rice paper wrapped donut fritters - yes you could get these at any dim sum restaurant, but these were extremely fresh, fluffy and crispy. Seems like they make them fresh in house. It was also a huge plate, much larger than other dim sum restaurants and was served with tasty light peanut and hoisin dipping sauces. A steal at $3.50. Raddish cakes in XO sauce - Great flavours and nice amount of spicyness. Stewed mock beef - great savoury sauce with a hint of sweetness. Curry spring rolls - a nice alternative to the regular spring rolls. A nice amount of heat and the serving was large.  Plates that were not so good: Siu Mai - was extremely soft and mushy Har Gow - the rice paper dumpling was very thick and lack flavour and had no texture.    The restroom was a surprise. I thought I walked into a storage room. They were storing folded tables and chairs and laundry bags of used table linens. Though it was generally clean, it was weird that they were storing stuff there, including in the stalls. I think this is a hygene issue if this furniture is used in the dining room without being wiped clean.  The bill came to $40 for three of us and we had three boxes of food which we couldn't finish, so I think it is very reasonably priced. I will definitely come back to try more items on the menu."}
{"text":"The Graceful Vegetarian Restaurant is located at the end of one wing of the collection of buildings attached to the mall. It is a small box with an assortment of round tables interspersed with a couple of square ones. Like any of the Chinese vegetarian restaurants it was sparsely decorated and a bit run down. We were seated at one of these smaller tables and were pleased a menu that offered a selection of dishes. We each ordered a dish and a selection of appetizers. We had high hopes based on the menu and the reviews I had read on Yelp. Sadly, the food when it arrived was disappointing. Not only were the portions small for the price, but everything lacked flavour. Nothing arrived as expected, including a deconstructed wonton and salt and pepper shrimp that we had to assemble ourselves. In the end the overpowering taste was sugar and grease. Everything was greasy and bland and after we left we had MSG induced headaches. What we couldn't understand is that the place was so popular and busy, maybe because of the location and ease of access for those shopping at the mall. An experience not to be repeated."}
{"text":"I went here yesterday after the good reviews from Yelp.  However it was for dinner and not dim sum.  The food came out slow but service was excellent.  Food was okay, having eaten at a few chinese vegetarian restaurants it was not bad, good selection of dishes.  Nothing spectacular though..   the restaurant decor is quite nice, very comfortable and semi-grand looking. Big shock from what i thought it would look like from outside.  The major downfall is the price.  The prices are quite high and portions arent that big.  (maybe its my expectations of having left overs after a meal)    most dishes range from 11-17 dollars ... most in the 13-14 dollar range."}
{"text":"Many people I know are not too fond of this restaurant but I wholeheartedly disagree.  Sure they lack staff and maybe it's a tad more expensive than your traditional dim sum place, but I would definitely recommend anyone to give the dim sum a try. My top favourites are any dishes with mock meat, the fried wonton chips, the fried milk and the common dim sum dishes like har gao and siu mai. Even though there are very few waiters, they are always polite and patient.  My main criticism is the mixed gluten plate (not sure what the proper name is in English for the dish). I've tried it a few times and every time I think it was a disappointment. Compared to the cheap plate i got at T&T Supermarket, the quality of the one here isn't that much better.  If you're looking for value for food, this isn't a good place to go. However, if you don't mind paying an extra few bucks for some good quality food, then I would highly recommend Graceful Vegetarian Restaurant."}
{"text":"Vegetarian restaurant   Location:  Currently in the building behind pacific mall. It's going to be moving soon. The building is being torn up  Parking: Tones, the building is half empty so park away  Decor: Very very dated hopefully the new place will be newer  Food: Ok. Maybe it was the selections from the group I was with. We got some good and some just ok things.  There are better vegan places in Markham that are better and slightly less expensive. I'm a strong believer that you get what you pay for and I don't think we quite got what we paid for.   It might be because the place is closing down to re open later in a new location. I'll go visit. Maybe the new location will inspire"}
{"text":"Never again! The food was good but the service was awful! We were never given the main menu so when I ordered something I had from there before, I described it. They were crisply chowmein noodles with vegetables. I even repeated that we wanted them with vegetables and the server said he understood. What we ended up getting was noodles with a ton of mock meat which my husband dislikes. When we brought this to the servers attention he argued with me. I sent it back anyway. We were charged for that dish.  Meanwhile we were waiting for one last dish which took forever to come. I noticed people on the tables around us were also waiting and getting impatient. 15 minutes AFTER taking back our noodles he came back to ask if we would like to order the kind we wanted. Given how long the food was taking to come out we said no. He also asked if we wanted more tea, which we also refused. A few minutes later he brought out a pot of tea... Hello?! Maybe he needs a notebook to write things down?  We left and drove to lotus pond vegetarian restaurant where we ordered the same items plus a dessert. We had excellent polite, quick service. We were even handed the full menu as we sat down...!! The food was excellent and the bill was less than at graceful for more food!  Save your money and go to either Wutai or lotus pond. I will never return!"}
