{"text":"It is truly a Grill house. Appropriate for large groups of people. Food portions are large. Staff is always dresses as cowboy. If it is your birthday the Staff will gather all and sing loud bday song"}
{"text":"The food was excellent, however the location is very run down. While the theme of this restaurant is a run down look, this location is even more run down than just in looks.

While the food would have us going back for more, not sure if the state of the restaurant would be something to subject ourselves to again. In need of some TLC."}
{"text":"It's a chain, it's not always 100% but it is damn good Tex Mex. My fiance and I frequent this location and split our 1lb steak fajitas and 2 texas size margaritas. I am not a huge meat eater and would generally order chicken when I have the option - but the steak here is really well cooked and certainly tastier than the chicken (the chicken is however moist as sometimes we have done 1/2 and 1/2).

Watch out for the free chips and salsa at the beginning - they too are killer and dangerous when you have a pound of meat and veggies coming your way. Oh make sure you pick up on your waiter/waitress' super-cheasy nicknames, they're always good for a laugh.

Margaritas are tart, salty, sour, sweet, and tequila-filled. We love them and can't hit up Lonestar without having one. Might want to follow it up with a beer to compliment your meal though.

Saving the best for last - the tortillas. This is the reason Lonestar gets an actual review from me given we are taking about chain-produced fajitas. The tortillas are made in a machine in-house that you can watch go to work. They come out hot and they're almost a bit thicker than the ones you can buy at the grocery store. I toy with buying some to bring home for some kind of sandwich or dessert filling one day.

One final note - if you like hot sauce, theirs is spectacular. We have purchased a bottle to bring home on more than one occasion."}
{"text":"We came during a concert, so the place was packed.  It was over an hour wait.  After 20 minutes, I asked the hostess how much longer the wait would be.  She gave me some pretty big attitude, saying how she just told me it would be over an hour.   A few minutes later, a party of 7 didn't show up when called, so we were seated.

The fajitas were tasty.  I'll agree that they don't offer many sides, but the food tastes really good.   While we were waiting to be seated, they also brought us nacho chips, which were warm and delicious.

The reason for the 2 star rating is the hostess and the manager.  We found something in our food that shouldn't be there and while it was appreciated that the manager came out to apologize, the apology just didn't cut it.  A free drink, something off the bill, a desert, anything at all would have saved this review.

Good food, just please inspect it carefully before eating."}
{"text":"Good place for a quickie spot to have drinks and a bite to eat before the game. Love the free chips and salsa. Ordered the calamari and it was surprisingly good. BF's burger came out super pink in the middle and throughout but they were able to recook it no problem. Even gave him a new bun and toppings. Service was good despite being really busy but I guess that depends on your server... Table next to us didn't get their food til after we we're already eating and they were sat way before us. If I were feeling for a restaurant chain type of place to eat it would definitely be this one."}
{"text":"I Had the tex mex burger and my god that was awful. I didn't know it was possible to completely mess up something so simple as a god damn burger. Anyways, the two stars is for the waitress who was super friendly , patient , and helpful."}
{"text":"This is my first time going to a place like lonestar and enjoyed the atmosphere despite it being a hectic baseball filled evening in the city.  The complementary chips and salsa was alright but nothing spectacular. The drinks were fairly weak and average price as far as mixed drinks go.  The service wasn't all that great but it's to be expected given a busy Friday night.  In general,  there isn't anything significantly extraordinary about this franchise and pegs itself as a typical bar with a cowboy themed name.  I wouldn't particularly make this a place I would propose as a first choice to others but definitely a back up,  at most."}
{"text":"Service was terrible. We weren't greeted until about 10 minutes later and this is how it went.
*Puts comp'd salsa chips on the table*
*10 minutes later* \"What can I get ya?\"

This is a place I have never been to before so it was my first time. Our server did not even take the time to explain the menu to us. He just explained his \"Favorite dishes\". He mentioned that the Browned Tilapia was one of his favorite dishes so I decided to give that a try.

I was very disappointed at my main course. Veggies were dry & my Tilapia was swimming in Pico de Gallo, which had absolutely NO TASTE whatsoever. I paid almost $20.00 for a bland meal & shitty service. My server did not even come back to ask me how my meal was and I had to get up and grab Ketchup for my partner's fries from another table. No water glasses refilled, NOTHING!

I am disgusted at the type of customer service this place is providing to it's CUSTOMERS with the kind of pricing they charge.

Never returning back!"}
{"text":"Service was ok...
Food took forever to arrive and side orders were missing...no nachos refills
:-/"}
{"text":"Fajitas & Beer....perfect combination
Wanted some classic fajitas, atmosphere is ok. The restaurant has it's usual south western flair, nothing special.
The waitstaff was decent, not setting the world on fire thats for sure. Average wait time for food.
Had queso w/ mexi beef, this dish was ok, I wouldn't order it again. Served luke warm & forgot beef, sent it back, returned w/ $1.29 worth of mexi beef.
Fajitas were ok, nothing special.
Overall, won't be going out of my way to come back here.
It was close & convenient at the time"}
{"text":"Classic corporate tex-mex.  What do I mean by that?  The chips and salsa are decent and bottomless.  They also have all of the regular mexican sounding menu items like chimichangas, enchiladas that no one really knows what they are except they have some sort of cheese and bean with them.  I had the fajita enchilidas which were decent.

Our waitress struggled quite a bit with the order even though we only had three people in our party...  and two people were sharing one meal.  Not impressed with her but you don't go expecting nobel laureate waitresses I suppose."}
{"text":"This is a spot for tourists eat. 

End of."}
{"text":"Holy Margarita! Me and three girlfriends went there to celebrate after exams. It was great drinks, free basket of tortilla chips and salsa and they make the chips right there. We ordered chicken and steak quesadillas and we shared and swapped. We left with bellies full and thirstys quenched and it didn't break the banks of these poor university grads (hopefully). I'd do it again."}
{"text":"We went to Lonestar for dinner tonight and the restaurant was not busy. We were seated right away. We ordered two standard items off the menu but it took nearly an hour for our food to arrive. By the time it arrived, we had lost our appetite and were too angry to enjoy it.

UPDATE: I was contacted by Lonestar management the following day which impressed me. They wanted my contact information so the manager of the Newmarket location could communicate with me. I provided it promptly and, nearly a month later, I am still waiting to hear from anyone. 

It is obvious that prompt service is not a priority to this location and that the problem originates at the top and trickles down. A very disappointing end to an already disappointing experience.

Because of this, I have degraded my rating from a 2 to a 1.

UPDATE: Well I finally heard from a General Manager Patrick \"Ranger\" Clarke on September 17, 2016, over a month after I was told a manager would be in touch.  He said the usual expected things like sorry for the poor experience and that he was terribly sorry that he didn't get back me in a timely fashion.  He invited me back to the restaurant and agreed to send me a gift card.  Now it has been over another month and still nothing.  It is now over 2 months since my original review and the lethargic approach to customer service continues.  I am escalating this to their corporate office.  This is like a bad joke.  I have degraded my rating from a 1 to a 0."}
{"text":"As others have noted, Lone Star is decidedly more \"Tex\" than \"Mex,\" but it's still a decent place to get your fajita/quesadilla/enchilada craving satisfied. 

My boyfriend and I shared the 1/2 pound original chicken fajitas with honey garlic teriyaki sauce and were quite pleased. The chicken was very saucy and mixed with green peppers and onions, although unfortunately our dish was heavy on the onions with only two little green pepper strips. We had to ask for seconds on the fixings (guacamole, sour cream, pico de gallo, lettuce, cheese), but our waitress was very nice about that and the refills were complimentary. The tortillas were very likely my favourite part as they were fresh, bready, and super delicious.

Our group also had the complimentary nachos and salsa which I didn't think were anything to write home to mom about. We also had the spinach dip appetizer which had a little bit of a spicy kick to it, but fortunately even I, the queen of low spice tolerance, could handle it. It was served with both nacho chips and some sort of pita bread slices.

The restaurant's atmosphere was really nothing special. I really expected more of an either Tex or Mex vibe, but the most relevant decoration was Coronita bottles filled with salt and pepper on the tables. The service was friendly and prompt, and the prices were a bit higher than I would have expected, but not completely outrageous. As my friends and I were taking in a Jays game that night (stupid Red Sox beating my team, you suck!), the location was perfect, but I don't think I'd ever seek Lone Star out when I'm not in the area."}
{"text":"Thursday night,  me and my girl were shopping around and we where really hungry ,  unfortunately,  we had the worst idea ever,  have dinner at Lone Star. After waiting a long time, one of the waitresses,  a teenager straight from high school took our order. The Thursday special, Texas size smoked pork back ribs with French fries and coleslaw. French fries were old and soggy,  coleslaw was terrible, it tasted like poison! Ribs were OK, nothing to talk about it.  The worst thing about this place,  besides the food is the service.  One of the waiters was hitting on the customers, a group of teenager girls. If you want to put your money down the drain its the perfect place,  I'll never step my foot in a Lone Star again."}
{"text":"The BEST food.  Good service.  Decent prices.  You wont be disappointed.   EAT AT LONE STAR!!!!  

If i could rate this place 10 stars I would.    Food  and service is always consistently great.  The fajitas are legendary however if you are not in the mood for fajitas they do have other GREAT menu items.   Because the fajitas are so good I've seldom had other items although when I did I was definitely not disappointed.

Bottom line, EAT AT LONE STAR !!!  There are other restaurants with similar names and food but they don't even come close to the original (on Front Street)."}
{"text":"This is a review of an experience back in July 2016. 
We came here for my husband's birthday, it was his choice to give this place a shot. We started with the nachos, which were very small (only 1 layer) and absolutely not worth the $16 they cost. I thought they forgot some of it somehow.
I asked to order the fish tacos with no cilantro. The server said they couldn't remove the cilantro as it was also in the pico de gallo. I asked what she could suggest on the menu that I could remove cilantro from, or didn't have pico de gallo. She said \"you've come to the wrong place if you don't like cilantro\". I appreciate that, but my husband wanted to try it for his birthday so I didn't want to complain and thought they could be accommodating. I ended up getting a pulled pork sandwich that wasn't great. The meal was almost $100 and was really not that enjoyable. We won't be coming back."}
{"text":"It took them a few minutes to seat us (the place looked empty) but apart from that, the food was great!

We had the fried mac n'cheese bites from the kids menu - my 2 year old loved it.

The missus has the peppercorn burger and she loved it as well. The patty was nice and juicy and fries were well spiced.

I had the chicken adobo, I was hoping for some gravy on the chicken but it was a nice version. The meat was well cooked and it came with some shredded fried tacos which was a nice spin

Overall, a very good meal!!"}
{"text":"My husband, 3 year daughter and I went to Lonestar in East Gwillimbury Tuesday night. Cowbell was our server. He was personable, attentive, friendly and our food was prepared perfectly. JD, was managing, and was also very kind and checked in with us often. We had a great time and definitely will be back again very soon!!! Thanks Cowbell and JD! From 6-shooter, Brass Spurs and Dirty Horse."}
{"text":"It had been a number of years since we'd been to a Lone Star restaurant so we thought we'd check it out once again.

My partner ordered the brisket and fries and I had the ribs. The brisket was a very small portion of over-salted meat, not at all like the excellent brisket we've enjoyed before at other restaurants. My ribs were fine but not on par with the ribs at Baton Rouge.

While the food was disappointing, the real story was the non-existent service. After our order was taken and our meals were served, our server disappeared. No quality check, no offer to take another drink order or a dessert order.

We had to track down our server to request the bill and pay. If our experience is any indication, service and food quality have seriously slipped at this chain. We won't be rushing back to any of the Lone Star locations."}
{"text":"I usually just come here for the drinks, haven't gotten a chance to eat here yet...but I surely will try out their food one day. They have a great drink menu, with lots of delicious drinks. I especially love their margaritas. The service is great, the drink servings are amazing and their bartenders are nice."}
{"text":"I'm lowering the rating a bit now. I stand by what I wrote above but I have been back 3 more times over the last little while (why would I return? because the kids like it - and if you've ever eaten with a kid - you need to consider the peace of mind that them enjoying their meal will contribute to you being able to inhale yours :) )

the service is always slow. Its clear by the average age of the employee in here that they have a very high turnover of staff (the entire staff looks to be about 23 years and younger). This is fine - but just hire more of them and it would go towards speeding up service. 

Someone from head office put a comment on here to contact them. I did - and they said they were sending my contact info to Richmond Hill manager to contact me. They never did - and my review was months ago. This screams at me of crappy customer service - they just wanted to have the posting on here making it seem like they were contacting me to 'fix' the problem. How do I know that? I used to be in the resto biz so I still talk to people - and this is a regular trick that is all over yelp!! The only thing that irks me more than poor customer service is when you try to sell it as good customer service!!"}
{"text":"It is what you expect it to be.  Lone Star is long on that contrived southwestern bar room charm and short on really worthwhile food.  I had the \"Big Rig\" burrito, one of the entrees the place is known for.  It was a perfectly serviceable burrito, but not worth the $15 I paid for it.

The staff were very pleasant and attentive without hovering, though clearly there is a dynamic going on that you and I, as customers not employees, aren't supposed to see (but do) or understand (and can't).

The Bottom Line:
If you want a standard tex-mex meal with standard beer because you're a tourist staying nearby Lone Star makes sense and will fill your appetite.  If you're interested in something more, you'll need to find somewhere else to go."}
{"text":"Early summarization:   Ehhh.

Honestly... I went with a group of friends. 2 in our party are from out of town, one used to live in Toronto, and I have recently moved here. We all have verrrry varying restaurant opinions (i'm gutsy, they.. not so much), and we came here simply because my ex-Torontonian friend had been there before and thought it would satisfy all our individual needs.
I had the veggie fajitas, which were awesome because the skillet had SO MUCH MUSHROOM! and i love mushroom. But it was very blah. I COATED my food in their hot sauce. (which I'm pretty sure was just Frank's, re-labelled. not that there's anything wrong with Frank's). 
What got me was that all the food, though ordered together, came out staggered..We got our fajita cold plates loooong before the hot plates. Then my other friend's food came out... then five minutes later, my other friend's burger-- minus the fries, which they told us would be along \"shortly\".

?

I confused.

Anyway.. Next time I want a fajita or anything mexicanish.. I'll go to Hernando's.
I suggest you do the same."}
{"text":"If I could give 1/2 stars, I'd give Lone Star a 2.5, but the staff was so nice, that I'm rounding up to a 3. Eating Tex-Mex at a place called Lone Star Texas Grill and then being objective about the review is going to be difficult for a Texan in Canada, but I'll give it a whirl.

I've tried and tried and tried to find decent, even average, Tex-Mex in Toronto, to no avail. Someone mentioned Lone Star Texas Grill to me and, because I live in the area and had passed it one billion times, I finally decided to try it as my craving and hankering for food that reminded me of home had gotten completely out of control.

The place is huge, so, even though the Leafs were playing at home that particular night, it wasn't overly packed. It took a few minutes for someone to come over, but once they came, they continued to be helpful and accommodating. Four stars for the staff!

Now, the food. The chips and salsa were good. The chips were overly salty, imho, but were fresh, and the salsa was good. I wavered between the chicken fajitas and the chicken enchiladas, but decided to remain a purist and ordered the fajitas. As soon as I saw the chicken, I knew it wasn't going to be good. It looked like chicken that was processed like deli counter meat. It was definitely not the fajita chicken I'm used to in Texas. It was pretty bland, as were the guacamole and pico. The tortillas were good, and the rice was marginally good. The \"saddle beans\" (not sure where they got that name, as that's not what we call them in Texas) were good, as beans go. The fajitas, though, were the worst part of my meal. They were pretty disgusting.

I guess if I'm absolutely dying to have Tex-Mex, Lone Star will satiate a craving, but all in all, it's really only average. I have an idea -- let's all take a UYE to Houston so I can show you guys some *real* chicken fajitas!"}
{"text":"Never again will never come back here.  Go the distance and go to the airport location.  

Horrible service and food was ok!"}
{"text":"This location is not as good as the airport location. They have done something to their fajita chicken that makes it taste cheap, like it has only been seasoned (or pre-made) with pepper.

I really hope this place starts to make their chicken like the airport location. I won't go back until they do.

Update: they've upped their prices but they've upped the quality of their food. The service is pretty decent."}
{"text":"Wish I could grade a negative star.  Will not be returning ever.  Service is absolutely horrible.  Lots of servers standing around talking to each other without any attention to customers.  We left after an hour with no food.  The people in the booth beside us got the wrong meal and the wait staff didn't replace it."}
{"text":"We went on a Sunday night, restaurant was pretty busy but service was ok. Our big disappointment was with the food portion and the price. We order dos fajitas with steak and shrimp for $39. We were surprised how small the portions were - my husband could have easily eaten the protein by himself and the sides are tiny. Would not come back for the fajitas although the table next to us got the fish tacos and they looked more substantial."}
{"text":"Finally tried out the Lone Star, as I frequently pass the Lone Star - but never stop to eat. I was very pleased with the entire experience. 

As mentioned in other reviews - the wait staff at this location is fantastic. The food is also great. 

If you get the chance - request Dakota to be your waitress. She's one of the best waitresses I've seen."}
{"text":"This is an awesome restaurant to get Tex Mex at. We came in and the wait was about 20-30 min. because it was busy and there weren't any tables. We finally got our tables and got tortilla chips with salsa. When we decided what we were in the mood for, ordered. I recommend the BBQ Brisket burger. Very good brisket! Also, they don't have it in the menu, but you can order fries with your burgers (another family member tried ordering it with their fajitas but the server said they couldn't). Overall great restaurant."}
{"text":"We came here for all you can eat ribs yesterday. They were kind of busy but we didnt have to wait for a seat, sat on patio. Everything started out ok but went downhill fast. We ordered immediately after we arrived (we knew we wanted ribs) We waited more than half hour for our food. We ate the first plate, they were ok. We were trying to order our next plate but our waiter disappeared... finally came back... we ordered next plate. He didnt clear our plates so they sat there for the next 20 mins and we also had to ask twice for drink refills. When our order finally came (half hour wait) it wasnt even a full rack it was a 1/4...why did it take the same time to bring out a full rack as a 1/4 rack? By this time we were quite irritated, then we cut into the ribs and 1 is semi cooked and 1 is practically raw   We had had enough. So we asked for bill, told waiter they were raw and he was like \"oh ok... hey look the power went out in that building\" seriously buddy??? we wont be back."}
{"text":"Located conveniently near the airport, this place is one of our family favorites for when one of us needs to picked up from the airport during rush hour. Rather than brave the rush hour traffic we eat out near the airport, and this is the place we more often than not go. Everything about the restaurant is fresh, fresh tortillas, fresh nacho chips, fresh. 
As the name suggests it serves up mexican, barbeque, and tex-mex food. It's a kid friendly place, has a decent sized patio, and also features live music some nights. The cost of an entree tends towards $10-$15, with the kids menu considerably cheaper. One downside, the only toilets I've ever seen are downstairs, so I'm not sure if it's wheelchair friendly."}
{"text":"One of the emptier lone stars I've been to. We went there to watch a hockey game and was able to get front row seats because it was empty. This was the playoffs! Drinks were fair quality but the wings were very disappointing . they seemed just-thawed and sauce was just poured on."}
{"text":"For them to say that this place is famous for their fajitas is an absolute joke and a flat out lie. Me and a buddy came to eat at this location and were extremely disappointed with the service and the whole dinning experience. Our server took at least over 10+ mins to bring us two glasses of water and nachos which shouldn't take that long In my opinion as well as brought us a cheese dip they call queso , which costed us like $6.00. Although it was somewhat enjoyable no one told us how it was going to be. After finally getting our meals the fajitas wraps smelt absolutely disgusting like If it had come out the washroom and was out on our plate, as well as the fries portion was those for a child (next to nothing). After attempting to eat the disgusting \"famous award winning fajitas\" we had to ask the manager for something else. We received chicken fajitas served on a steaming plate with dishes with a baby amount of toppings , cheese , lettuce etc. The chicken which was served on the steaming fajita plate was burnt , and the onions and peppers included were burnt to absolute fuck."}
{"text":"This location has been around for some time but it took me a while to come around to it. Located in a plaza with a gym, banks and anything else you can imagine it does stand out as having one of the nicest patios in the area.

The service here is excellent and lively and matches the atmosphere very well. From my two visits I have understood that they really stand out on the fajitas, they have all you can eat nights on Tuesdays and various other deals throughout the week. The fajitas are served with fresh tortillas that really make this dish stand out. There is no shortage of food either and for the price it is a great meal.

I recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants to grab some good tex-mex and a couple drinks if they feel like it while in Newmarket. Also the patio in the summer is sublime and they have pitchers of sangria as well!"}
{"text":"Had a fish taco, love it! 
And love the lone star hot sauce!"}
{"text":"I was rather disappointed in this dinner experience. I gave it three stars because the staff was awesome and we got seated in a reasonable time on a Friday night but the food was not worth the ridiculous amount it cost. We were a family of five with two small children and we still ended up paying over $100 for dinner and two beers. My daughter and I shared a double fajitas and it was silly what we were served for $30. There was about a half cup of rice and beans for us to share between us and the meat on the fajitas came out ho hum. Glad I gave it a shot, I wouldn't go twice."}
{"text":"Typical chain restaurant food, but still tasty!  We had a 15 minute wait for a table, but they provided tortilla chips & salsa which was nice.  After we were seated, our drinks arrived promptly and we were given plenty of time to look through the menu.  I had the chicken fajita wrap and it was delicious.  Our waiter was friendly, and he shook our hands when we left!  Conveniently located near the Convention Centre, the CN Tower, and the SkyDome (Rogers Centre)."}
{"text":"A good suggestion - read reviews before stepping in a restaurant. I always believe that one's experience doesn't have to be same as others but....

We were on our way to All Stars (the one by Yonge and Elgin) when we came across this place. We have lived in the area for some years but never visited this restaurant - feeling that this place would be expensive and we wouldn't be able to afford it! 

We were welcomed in well - restaurant half empty on a Friday night - we thought we would be served well and on time but alas, I was wrong. We waited for 20 minutes for someone to come to our table - I lost it and had to go to the kitchen to get someone to come to our table - my 2 kids were HANGRY! Inspite of me asking someone to come to our table, a lady showed up  5 minutes later - we decided that some other place deserved our hard earned money. We walked out!

Personal suggestion - read the other reviews, hardly anyone has good to say about this place - I won't be stepping here again! I wish I could give negative or a zero rating but I can't!"}
{"text":"Typical Tex-Mex with a big chain feel, designed more for high-volume than delivering a unique experience.  The food (a chicken fajita wrap) was decent but nothing to write home about. The bartender was very friendly and kept me company during a slow afternoon.  Overall, almost a perfectly average experience.

At least they were not forced to wear \"flair\"..."}
{"text":"It pains me to give this a single star. Why? Because it deserves no stars, or perhaps negative stars (however that might be possible). The food at this \"restaurant\" is terrible. My fiance and I went on a Saturday night, around 6 or 7. Our initial impression was fair in that we were seated quickly and our drink order was taken just about immediately. Following that, we ordered appetizers and food. 

Following that...nothing. For 20 minutes, radio silence. No appetizers, no waiter, nothing. I had ordered chicken fingers as an appetizer. How long does it take to fry chicken fingers? Perhaps a few minutes. Had the place been very busy, I might have understood the delay...especially if it had been communicated to me by my waiter. However, there was no explanation, and no waiter.  And it was half-empty.

The food was awful. How do you mess up chicken fingers? By frying them for too long. These were fried a few MINUTES too long. The food, the \"world famous\" fajitas...were tasteless. Our sides looked like they'd been sitting out since first shift and I had to grab passing bus boys and girls to get water for my fiance (who is pregnant!). 

To communicate how terrible our experience was, please know, Yelp community that I created my Yelp account a few minutes ago, just so I could give this place a terrible review. 

Oh, and our waiter...? He calls himself crazy horse. He was perhaps the worst waiter I've ever had. Ever. Like, in my life. Stay away from this place. Order a pizza, make some pasta, whatever. But don't, please, don't throw your money away by eating at this poor excuse for a restaurant.  The food is expensive (for what you get - my over-fried chicken fingers were over $10), the service is awful (the only thing which arrived at the table quickly was the bill - which prompted crazy horse to sit down at our table and wait while we keyed in the numbers on the interac - real nice). 

I have to stop writing now. I have too many colorful adjectives to use, and I am so frustrated at wasting the money that my sentences aren't cohesive as it is. 

Be warned."}
{"text":"I should have gone with my gut feeling and stayed away. I went in the afternoon, completely empty another sign to have left.  I stayed and sat down, service was very slow and non welcoming. They bring out the chips and salsa that are cold and greasy. I ordered the fish tacos, supposedly very popular as the server told me.  Took forever to come out and when it did it only had 2 small pieces of fried fish in one taco. Rice was bland and beans tasted as if they just scooped it out of the can.  Trust me just go somewhere else, sad to say just go to subway and get a sub, because your gonna pay alot for something crappy."}
{"text":"The manager reached and sent a gift certificate, asking we give them another try for dinner. We did, and it was much, much, much better (we didn't mention the previous visit so there was no special treatment). We may even go back - though the fact that it was so good this time just makes it that much more troubling that it was so bad the other."}
{"text":"Fantastic experience! Service was great, friendly, and fast. Food was fresh & hot. Had the fajitas (as I always do) and 10/10 was impressed. The tortillas where super fresh and the steak was a sizzling medium/medium-well. More than satisfied. Love this location for its consistent high quality!! Definitely a huge recommend! *tip I always visit approx 2 hours before dinner rush. Staff is fresh and ready to help, food is fresh and hot, the lack of the dinners means nothing sits under a heat lamp."}
{"text":"Update: visited the resultant for lunch on October 8 with the family.... I think we were the first ppl there for lunch.... the reason I went back was the outreach I receive from the manager after posting my original review.... service was way better and the food was good...... overall if this is the norm then it's worth your while!!!"}
{"text":"Super Alternative zu Burger, French Fries und Co. - toller Service, gute Laune, junge Servicekräfte hoch motiviert. Gut besucht und dies bestätigt die Qualität der servierten Menues.
Wir waren zu dritt dort und auch unser 12jähriger Sohn hat es fein gefunden. Toll ist, dass man auch outdoor sitzen kann. Wir empfehlen dieses Lokal absolut! Preislich zwischen 15 und 25 Canada Dollars."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner on a Monday night but early as we have kids. I was actually very surprised at how busy it was hoping this was a good sign (IT WASN'T)
We ordered a 2 person fajita the chicken/steak combo. the steak was spicy as was the rice that comes with it. now I don't mind spicy but mention it somewhere on the menu or at least when we are ordering. 
Our kids had the burger from the kids menu which they had a hard time eating as it was also spicy !! from the kids menu ! go figure. 
Overall service was good and the place had a great atmosphere but the quality of the food was only so so."}
{"text":"Excellent service, staff was friendly from the moment we walked thru the door. The restaurant was packed with ppl from the auto show but plenty of staff on hand to keep everything moving well. Got our much needed lunch and beverages in good time and everything tasted great. Would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"As far as lone stars go this location doesn't quite live up to their standard. Was here the other day for lunch, service was longer than expected (it wasn't even that busy!), ordered a pitcher of beer which tasted as if it had been sitting in the tap for months, the only redeeming quality was that the food was as good as expected (got the steak sandwich with rings)."}
{"text":"To start the chips and salsa they provide everyone was good. We were hopeful. Then dinner came. Over-priced, bland (actually terrible) food that took almost an hour to arrive. Two entrees (one the chicken - if that's what it was, and one the tenderloin skewers) just were not good - food was on hot plates, but rewarmed and tough. And the beans tasteless. Yet the side vegetable were so over salted they were inedible. Definitely a pass. Too bad, as it's a great location."}
{"text":"The menu to have some pretty tasty items until I took a bite into my enchilada and there was a piece of metal from a can in it, yum yum."}
{"text":"Stopped by just after 9 o'clock on a Saturday night to get a couple orders of wings as carry out. Big banner saying half price wings after 8:30 PM. Gentleman said at the carry out check out that it would be only a few minutes. 27 minutes later got the wings. One order ice cold one order was hot. Wings tasted ok but can't image anyone paying almost $2 a wing regular price. Was told Steph the gm was off... Didn't seem like anyone was in charge or even cared. I predict this place will not be around in a year."}
{"text":"I can't recall how long I have been going there, 10 years possibly. Some of the best Fajitas I have ever had. 

The place is NOT run down at all, it's a country look they are going for(they also play country music while you eat, but not that load).

Large patio for summer use. They have a tortilla machine in the center of the place, so you always get fresh(just pressed from dough) tortilla for use in your Fajitas."}
{"text":"A friend introduced me to Lonestars a few weeks ago, since then I have been back twice. Everytime I have shared the fajitas (chicken and steak) for 2. I've found the food has always been great, staff have always provided great service and atmosphere to be fun! I love the complimentary chips and also as well as the bottomless sides with fajitas (guac, sour cream etc etc.) Overall great value and great staff, will definately be back!"}
{"text":"The fajitas are great here. I've been going to the Etibicoke location for years and was thrilled this location makes them the same way."}
{"text":"Amazing nachos! If you're looking for a meal out of nachos I definitely recommend this place. They also have toppings and cheese covering unlike other restaurant chains. Great staff and great service!"}
{"text":"Lonestar has moved. The change in location is interesting but not in a bad way. However, I noticed that prices have gone up slightly. I'd say on average it has gone up about $1-2 for each dish. Not a whole lot but noticeable. They still have complementary salsa and chips but they now charge $1 for each refill. 

Other than that, food is still great. Drink are great but a little on the expensive side. Although prices have increased slightly, it's not so much that I am put off. If I could I would give it 3.5 stars now."}
{"text":"I regularly come here for the fajitas. They changed location and possibly management has changed too. Service is still great. Things have gotten a bit more expensive on the whole. I usually come for dinner and order the regular fajitas (delicious and good portion sizes). My most recent visit I came for lunch and ordered the \"lunch fajitas\". I was quite disappointed with the portion size. I'm not sure if they downsized all dishes in general or perhaps the lunch fajitas is a mini version of the  regular/dinner fajitas. I had presumed they would be the same portion-wise and the only reason why the lunch fajitas were a few dollars cheaper was because it was lunch time. Also I used to get queso as an additional sidekick (a side sauce to go with your dish)  but I don't see queso in the list of sidekicks any more. Pity. 

The menu says that chips and salsa are complimentary but each refill is $1. However, in the two times I've been there since they changed menu and location, I haven't been charged for a refill."}
{"text":"I was so happy to see the place called Lone Star because I m from originally from Texas even though I lived in California last 20 years.  My husband I decided to give it a try while we were here for visit for a week.    

We ordered a bbq brisket sandwich and lone star chicken salad.  Salad was ok but little dry and boring and the sauce on bbq sandwich was very sweet and the fluffy bun in top was crunchy so it was hard to eat. The fries were dry and cold.  It was the worst 50 dollars I have spent on food.  Please do not waste ur time or money here. I gave two stars out of respect for Texas"}
{"text":"Had a horrible experience here. We had to leave before our food even got to the table after a 1 hour wait. They kept telling us our food was ready but we never saw it. They must have brought 4 rounds of chips even after we told them we didn't want any more. Manager was nice and comped our drinks and apps but our waitress was incompetent."}
{"text":"This place is a joke! Terrible service. My drink was empty for over 15 min. The fajitas were puny only came with 3 shells and 1 tablespoon of cheese. Really!! you need to cut corners this much."}
{"text":"This happened to me a year or two ago there. I am a vegetarian and ordered the veggy fajitas. Then the waiter asked that for 2-3 dollars more I can get extra mushrooms. Ive been to the lone star in kingston and it came with so many mushrooms that I thought why would I need extra... It was the location at kingston that got me hooked. When my food came I was shocked that there was only onions and broccoli... Ive been to several lone stars around ontario and I know each ones food is different but the one on front street left me wondering if it was a joke. Conclusion; will never go back there because in my opinion its the worst of the franchise and there are other locations nearby which are much better.

Lone Star pickering and ajax are much better; kind of funny that people in the core are getting less."}
{"text":"Do you like bland Tex Mex food?  If you do, be sure to drop by here.

There are several locations spread in and out of the GTA, and the Oakville location is their latest opening (at the time of this review).  I have never been to a Lone Star Grill, so I went in with no expectations... keeping in mind that Mexican food in Canada generally sucks really bad.

The guys will probably like this place.  90% of the waitresses are all fit and wear sexy cowgirl outfits.  The decor is similar to Montana's, but much cleaner and more substantial.

Food though, is the sad story.  Even though they make very nice fresh tortillas, everything else was really, really bland.  When you think Tex Mex, you think spicy, but it is the complete opposite.  Chicken and steak taste exactly the same, and lacking any heat whatsoever...it even lacked salt. Even the hot sauce was not hot!

Chalk one up for another bad Tex Mex restaurant in the GTA."}
{"text":"We always request JD she always makes it perfect. Great atmosphere, great food and fantastic server with JD!"}
{"text":"Food was good but the place could be cleaner. I had the fajita and enjoyed a cold beer. Service was great!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Their ribs are the best! If you sign up to their site, you can get some good deals and discount off the bill. We like to bring guests from out of town or special occasions as you can always count on good food here. Service has always been good as well."}
{"text":"Food isn't bad but the real star here is their service. It's impeccable. I cannot say this enough. Every single time I've come here, I've always gotten what seems to be the nicest server in the world.  Intuitive to our needs, but not overly presumptuous. Kind and courteous but not overly bubbly and annoying. Always available to help. They make sure they walk by often, without pestering you but they're just 'around' in case you need them. Just so lovely! 

We've never left here unhappy."}
{"text":"Très bonne Fajitas, très bon accueil et prix raisonnable. 
À refaire..."}
{"text":"After walking around the area for an hour,  I came across this restaurant.  First time here and tried their NY Steak. Steak was Very well cooked and tasty.  The staff are very friendly and professional.  Service was in timely manner and the food came on time."}
{"text":"I'd like to rate this 0 out of 5 but the lowest you can give on here is a 1.  I've been to this restaurant a few times and never had such a bad experience as tonight.

1- Service was slow.
2- The music was so loud you had to yell so whoever you were with could hear you.  Because of this I learned that the person at one table owned a sailboat, another person at a different table didn't own one, but does sail, and the people at another table like to travel to Mexico and aren't fond of some of the procedures at the border crossings.  I left there with the start of a migraine.
3- The food had more salt than what's on my car.  I'm still trying to get rid of the taste of salt out of my mouth.
4- The food wasn't very hot, lukewarm at best.
5- Our waitress could have been better.

The original plan was to go to The Keg, but the wait for a table was over an hour.  We chose the Lone Star because it was across the street and we've been there before and enjoyed it.  In retrospect, we should have waited for the table at The Keg."}
{"text":"Awful service. Ridiculous wait time for placing order, getting drink etc. should have spent a little more and gone across the street to The Keg."}
{"text":"Great food; we really enjoyed our tacos and fajitas. Not sure what constitutes Texan cuisine, though. Mexican + ribs? Patio was roomy, service was fast. Could likely find comparable food for a fair bit less, but it's King street."}
{"text":"Despite being your typical chain restaurant - it does the tex-mex rather well. Enjoyed the fajitas and a nice steak as well - both times felt excellent.

Service is efficient, never had to wait long and food always delivered on time. The chips and salsa are complimentary when you sit - nice touch.

Decent prices, I feel it delivers exactly what people expect..."}
{"text":"We had the steak and the fajitas. The steak was nice and it was the temperature we ordered. The chicken and shrimp fajitas were nice too but I only got 3 tortillas. There was enough food for 5 tortillas. I did not anticipate that and ended up filling up my last tortilla to the point where it almost fell apart. The free chips and salsa were a disappointment. We got all the small broken chips while every other table got the big pieces. We figured we got the last batch but they should throw that out or give it to the staff not the paying customers whom they hope will return. I think our server was new because she kept looking at a man who followed her everywhere. She looked to him for his approval. She never refilled our drinks we had to stop and ask her. She took about 15 minutes to give us our check and clear our tables. I am going to give her the benefit of the doubt that she is new. I am disappointed in the man who followed her around for not staying on top of her (figuratively) about her tables."}
{"text":"I thought it was good, not great. The service - though friendly -  can be slow during peak times. Loud, lots of TV's. It's a huge, underground space, but doesn't feel claustrophobic. The menu is good, solid bar food, with a Southwestern edge. Fairly priced. I'd come back here again."}
{"text":"Good food, bad service. Would not recommend. Would've done 1 star but the handsome guy making the tortillas redeemed the rating, thanks man!"}
{"text":"Food: 8/10
Atmosphere: 8/10 
Service: 8.5/10
Overall experience: 8/10

My family has been coming here for years, and if things continue on as they have been, we are looking at being lifers!

The food may not be the absolute best, but it is a really fun environment for any group of people. The service is great - staff are friendly and really do want to make your meal enjoyable.

We always get the fajitas (steak). Onion rings are also good!

THE BOTTOM LINE: not the world's best tex-mex, but definitely a family fajita staple."}
{"text":"There is only one reason to come to Lone Star, and that's the Fajitas.
This location was recently renovated, and it was more than needed. Their new digs make the former big box restaurant into something more cozy and inviting.
The Fajitas are where it's at though. Steak and Buffalo chicken are staples for us. The steak is always done to perfection and is so delicious! The steady run of fresh tortillas, made on site, and warm salty nachos makes this an incredibly filling meal."}
{"text":"The service provided by the attendants was great; but  I am not a fan of paying exuberant amounts of money for tasteless tiny amounts of food. I was a fan of the Lone Star restaurants but over the years food portions keep getting smaller and the prices have risen unreasonably. There are better restaurant options out there that would make you feel that your money is well spent. Sorry, will not be treating my family to Texas Lone Star anymore."}
{"text":"It was ok. Not great, not bad. Dependable. I ate at the Keg steakhouse the next night. It was pricier but considerably better. This place isn't bad at all, just not great by any means."}
{"text":"The food is good.  However the service is absolutely brutal.   We ordered appetizers to be shared by the 6 of us.  The apps show up and I had to ask for napkins and plates.  Plates show up 5 mins later with no napkins.  The main courses arrive and my taco came with a side of sweet potato fries.   There was a max of 15 sweet potato fries on the plate (half of what the other plates had).   I highlight this to my waitress so she takes the tacos back to the kitchen to get more fries, why do this VS just go back to the kitchen to get more fries.  5 mins later she come back with my plate.  Meanwhile someone at the table ordered fajitas, but there were no utensils on the table.  If the manager at this location is serious about trying to fix things at the restaurant, staff training for service is critical."}
{"text":"i had the big burrito, the tijuana one, amazing burrito, nothing can compare, you get some pico de gallo and guacamole, it complimented the meal well, everyone should definitely get it"}
{"text":"Nothing better then the chicken fajitas. Something about the delicious mesquite that just makes it. Find lone star has gone a little down hill but still delicious."}
{"text":"Food 7/10, service 4/10 slow very slow, ok atmosphere. There is defiantly room for improvement."}
{"text":"Great wait service, Smaller than average portions.  A bit on the pricey side.  Careful of Canadian A1 sauce (Yuck), it's completely different than the US version ."}
{"text":"We love this restaurant, the atmosphere, staff (we love Ammo who always takes care of us), and most importantly the great food!  You are always started off with a basket of warm tortilla chips and salsa to wet your appetite while you review the menu.  The fajitas are amazing and a great value.  If you have any room after eating your entree definitely go for one of their delicious desserts!"}
{"text":"First of all, it's a franchise so you have to judge accordingly.

It's not family owned or run, with grandma or grandpa in the back cooking from scratch.

That being said, it's one of my favourites - but that's because I'm a meat and/or tex-mex fan.

I don't find it too salty or greasy, where I feel ill or uncomfortable afterwards.

I've been here at least 10 times, and have never had a problem with service.

My husband use to come here as a starving student and spend only $5 on a bottle of beer, and fill himself up on complimentary tortillas and salsa all night (students, don't get any ideas!!)

He grew up near the border, and has verified they are very good torts.

My favourite food here are their homemade tortillas.

If you have children, they LOVE watching how they are made.

If you're a hang around the bar person, they have t.v.s showing the game."}
{"text":"I went on a Sunday night..  it was really quiet but there were still a few patrons there in the bar area watching some sports.

We sat in the dining area, almost by ourselves..  yet the service was fantastic.  Friendly, helpful and courteous.  Lone Star is Always a winner.

I think they gave me extra chicken too cause it was definately a Texas Sized meal.  I had the Chicken Fingers with the Excellent Texas Butter sauce (on the side, not tossed in it) and its quite tasty.  The other meal was the *new Stir Fry..  with the Jalapeno Fire sauce i think it was called...  and it was pretty bland.  so I would stay away from this one.  Not bad, not great by any means.

But overall I still give big thumbs up to this place.  I suggest you stick with the TEXMEX cuisine.  She just wasn't in the mood for it.

Cheers!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were in town celebrating our honeymoon and decided to go to this restaurant because it was so close to our hotel and we were tired from traveling and it was nasty weather out. The girl at the hostess stand was sweet and acknowledged us as soon as we entered. The table we were sat at was being waitressed by an AMAZING waitress named Carter. She was super nice and a great waitress! She was very attentive, even though she had multiple tables to attend to that evening. We started talking and she had asked us about visiting the area and we told her we were there honeymooning. When we were finished with our meals she brought us out a complimentary cheesecake dessert with cute little heart strawberry and cool whip designs. My husband and I were both so surprised and it meant so much to us for such a sweet gesture from someone we just met! Our meals were delicious and prepared in a timely manner...we would definitely  recommend this restaurant to anyone visiting this area!! Great job to the staff that evening...especially Carter!! :-)"}
{"text":"I come here often with family or big groups and unfortunately this time around wasn't that great. 

If I based this review on all of my visits so far up to now, I would rate it 4 or 5. They're popular for their fajitas and that's what we always get but I find their service is very inconsistent. 

So today (labour day) my fiancée and I walked in and was greeted right away by a friendly hostess. She offered the patio, bar and dining area. We decided to stay in the dining area. Right away I noticed there were 6 tables (including ours) with about 2-4 people at each one and one waitress. Our waitress was very nice but she was busy. It took her about 5-10 mins to come to our table but by that time we already knew what we wanted to order (thankfully-not sure how much longer we would've waited if we were given more time), once we ordered she offered to bring us water. It was starting to get a little busier and noticed the manager (I assume it was him anyway based on his attire) started helping. He served us chips and salsa, which is amazing by the way! You can get as many servings as you want but be careful not to eat too much before your meal! We went through two servings and still didn't get our water...I guess she forgot! Instead we asked the manager and he brought it right away. 

We ordered chicken fajitas (serving for one) and a bbq bacon poutine. We weren't too hungry and knew that we'd get full from the chips and salsa! Service on the food was quick, quality was ok. They gave us 3 tortillas which wasn't enough, it took a while to get our waitress's attention! By the time we called someone over for more fajitas we had been waiting for at least 5 minutes and our chicken was starting to get cold. Finally the manager brought us more. I had two fajitas, my fiancée had 4. The poutine really wasn't that great but then again...Lonestar is known for their fajitas. 

I'll probably be back in the future because the rest of the family loves going so we'll see how it goes next time!"}
{"text":"The quesadillas are amazing. The guac isn't good and I found a big fluff in mine which was gross.good place to go. Choose wisely, some things are v $$"}
{"text":"Went here for a father's day dinner with my wife and two little ones - horrible experience. We had three different servers take our drink orders.... which never arrived. After waiting for 20+ beer-less minutes to try to order our food, we had to leave. I've had poor experiences at this location in the past, but this one took the cake. Add the fact that the menu prices keep going up, chips and salsa are no longer free, and there are a growing number of better quality tex-mex options in the GTA (there's a Chipotle right next door!), and I will not be returning here with my family."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.  Impressive veggie option!  \"Grilled Portobello & Crispy Avocado\" fajitas were a definite win.  Drizzled with chimichurri and served with sautéed onions, bell peppers, corn, shredded lettuce, salsa, beans, rice, sour cream, etc. and unlimited soft/chewy house-made tortillas, the meal was big enough to share. I took leftovers home and had dinner for 2 days!!  The \"Dirty Queso\" (NOT veg) despite being very fake-cheesy was actually quite tasty as well.  Would definitely eat here again when craving solid Tex-Mex.  *TIP: Order the \"Pepita Mole\" as one of your \"side kick\" options -- it's delicious! (but skip the guac... looked like it was squeezed out of a plastic bag)."}
{"text":"This place is awful! I have no idea how anyone can give this place a good review.  The fajitas Una were really only half a serving, the tacos came out cold, and the portions appeared catered to toddlers.  This is a reminder of why mom and pop restaurants are better.   It's all bottom line here, nothing else. Horrible, horrible, horrible (the 1 star is for the staff member who tried his hardest to keep us happy).

UPDATE
Me and my wife woke up this morning with REALLY puffed up faces.  Our only allergy is dust.   Put 2 and 2 together and you can figure out how well kept this place is. Never again..."}
{"text":"Okay ... let me start by saying, this was not a great experience.

After a long day of work related activities in Richmond Hill, our staff team decided to grab a nice meal together before heading home. We weren't very picky on where to eat so we chose Lone Star Texas Grill just because it happened to be across the street.

Now I know they're not known for healthy meals and small portions but I was in the mood for something \"light\". The menu was full of unappetizing options and referred to the \"Texas Size It\" promotion similar to what McDonald's offers...really not my style. After looking over the menu several times, I decided to order the fish tacos.

I had no idea what to expect since this wasn't a fresh seafood restaurant nor was it known for it's amazing fish tacos.

As expected, my first impressions were not great. The fish was deep fried, the veggies we're low quality and the sauce was some sort of cheesy bean dip ... YUCK !

This was my first experience at Lone Star and I get it ... fun country environment, staff dressed as cowboys(girls) and country music playing all night long but for me, the most important thing is the food and on this occasion, the quality and presentation was not there."}
{"text":"Drove by this place everyday, never intended to visit, and it looked like it was devoid of any customers from afar. This was probably because I always thought Texas Lonestar was the same restaurant as Texas Longhorn in Mississauga which was horrible to say the least. Awful service and below average food for the prices you pay.

Running out of close restaurant options, we decided to try it anyway and man was it the exact opposite of what was in my head all along. It was packed, good service, good food, and a totally different restaurant in every way.

Had the chicken fingers and the quesadilla and was pretty happy with it. Prices are pretty standard. Will definitely go back to try other stuff."}
{"text":"Please do not go here. The waiters and waitresses are mostly racist. I was here last night with a friend who is White, to whom they were exceedingly attentive. When I asked for a refill of water, the waitress took almost 10 minutes - attending to the other tables around - and finally I had to ask another waitress for more water, at which point the first waitress brought a glass of water which she must have SPAT into or done something horrible to because since I drank from thst glass, my top lip and the region immediately above my top lip have been blistered. I have photo evidence, and I am seriously  thinking of suing this place. 

In the meantime, please do NOT go to this Hell Hole and warn others not to go there either. If I can prevent at least one more person of colour from experiencing what I experienced - after being nothing but exceedingly courteous and friendly to all the servers as I always am - then that's some consolation. The waitress who did this to me will soon experience Karma I'm SURE"}
{"text":"Came here with three other friends this past Sunday for dinner. We were sat in a booth by the window which was actually nice and spacious. Two of my friend shared the Steak Fajitas and the other one had the Big Rig. They frequent this restaurant more often than I do and they always order the same thing. I opted for the Ribs & Chicken Wings Combo with the seasonal vegetables. I loved every bite! The chicken wings were really good, crispy and saucy. And the ribs were cooked perfectly, fall off the bone juicy. The seasonal vegetables however were a bit disappointing as it was just tiny strips of peppers, carrots, and zucchini, but the coleslaw was good. I love icebergs (beer with margarita mix on top) so I got one of those too. Service was great, we had to wait awhile for two of our friends and she was more than happy to bring us more drinks and their complimentary chips and salsa while we waited."}
{"text":"I´ve not been to their new location yet but we were always satisfied and stuffed whenever we went to the old location and the one at the Airport.

So what do you expect when you go to a Tex Mex Restaurant? Steaks, Beans, Enchiladas and a Cocktail or a Coke to wash everything down. Mostly been here before or after a Jays game. The interior is supposed to make you feel as if you were in Texas. Well all I can say is I´m going for the food not for the decoration.

As for the food. The Steak is that good you didn´t even have to cut it. It was melting in your mouth. The Chicken & Steak Combo Fajitas were just as delicious. If you choose an appetizer I suggest you take the Classic Poutine Texas Style. 

All in all I´m looking forward to checking out their new location in April. Good job Lone Star!"}
{"text":"Calamari was delicious  , we also had a chicken burger that was amazing! Unfortunately we didn't get a picture of the chicken burger ... it was that good!!!
Great quick service ."}
{"text":"This has to be the biggest joke of the century calling this food \"authentic Tex-Mex\".  The food is horrible, the service pathetic, and the long wait for food not fit for human consumption horrible.  SAVE YOUR MONEY AND GO SOMEWHERE ELSE."}
{"text":"Disappointment in food. Your better off going to burrito boyz.

The starter of nachos and salsa were tasty and fresh and the chips were warm (nice touch).

The burrito was filled with low quality meat and ultimately tasted very similar to taco bells burrito.  The side of rice and refried beans were not the best, I have had better.

 The portabella mushroom avocado taco had half of a delicious mushroom between two tacos. The mushroom was well seasoned and warm.  They only had one slice of hard avocado in each taco. Basically the cold pita was filled with mostly lettuce and some sparse tomatoes and lacked much of any flavour. The side caesar had fake bacon bits, frozen cheese, the dressing tasted more like blue cheese than caesar.  (huge disappointment! )

The atmosphere was cowboy and cowgirl themed, not much life. I will not be returning here.

The only good thing at this place was the top notch bartender who was attentive and fast and genuinely happy, nice and caring.

The bill came to $46 for two people. We could have went to the mandarin for that price and had all you can eat.  I suggest this restaurant reduce their menu and make it a buffet style with chefs and staff making the food items fresh in view of the customers, similar to a roast beef or omelette station at a resort where people line up for the food."}
{"text":"Went with wife and 4 year old for a dinner before catching our movie show...we had a 1.5 hour buffer with the theatre being just 10 min drive away at the most. We got to the movies late...enough said on that.

Awful food on top - I order fajitas and the rice was burnt and sticking to the hot plate. My wife was served a frozen coleslaw with ice crystals inn every bite. 

One star for Hurricane, our waiter, who was apologetic and conscientious. But even he cannot redeem this place. We are done with this place"}
{"text":"Worst service yet. Took 10 mins to get us seated despite the fact that the restaurant was 75% empty, 15 mins for drinks, 1 hour for the meal and the waiter came by exactly 4 times including once to give us our check. Nobody came by to ask how our food was/bring any refills. The only time we saw the waiter other than when he was bringing food/drink/taking order was when he walked by us to sing the birthday song and we had to flag him down there or else we wouldn't see him for another hour. They brought the wrong appetizer and when we told him his reaction was \"oh. really?\" Fajitas are a joke the portions were tiny. Overall bad experience definitely won't be coming back."}
{"text":"My date and I both proceeds to projectile vomit within 10 minutes of leaving this place. Something was defiantly wrong with the food. 

We both shared the fajita plate for 2 with chicken and steak. That was a very bad idea."}
{"text":"Amazing food; even better service.

My wife and I got there at around 7:30pm on a Friday night. It was fairly busy. We were greeted immediately by two hostesses upon entry who were very friendly and seated right away in the dining room at our request.

Our server Jolene (which I'm sure isn't her real name) was awesome. She came to the table very quickly and was very attentive through the evening. Never once did our drinks or chips get empty before she asked if we would like more.
She also had great advice on which sauce I should get on my ribs and even recommended what was possibly the best dessert ever.

That said, our food was excellent. Our Quesadillas came out very quickly and were very good. My ribs and the wife's lettuce wrap chicken fajitas were also quick to arrive and Jolene was sure to check if we needed any hot sauces or additional toppings, etc.

The ribs were also excellent - I had the chipotle sauce btw - and my wife said her fajitas were amazing too.

Perhaps best of all was the apple sizzler dessert. Jolene genuinely appeared to be thrilled to bring us something that she knew we were going to love - and love it we did!

Amazing experience. Can't wait to go back. Would also definitely request Jolene as a server again."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere but food is a bit overpriced. Ie. wings special on Wednesday is $1 each.  

The service is friendly and ok. The food is at best mediocre. Orders Nachos and a large burrito - the burrito came with refried beans which was sweet and rice. The burrito barely had any meat in in and was stuffed mainly with the same rice and beans. Salsa is good though."}
{"text":"Went here after seeing a play at The Royal Alexandra. Bit daunting walking down into a basement, but it was pleasantly warm and welcoming at first glance. 

The wait staff here are ALL wonderful. They share the tables, we got lots of attention. All the girls were very friendly and accommodating. 

One negative; I ordered the deep fried avocado as a starter. They didn't have any ripe avocados... Bit surprising given the type of cuisine they serve, so I asked for the deep fried pickles, again, no pickles.... I settled on the deep fried (notice a theme) Mac and cheese balls with jalapeño dip, very good. 

Both mains were plentiful in size and tasty. The piece de resistance was the sizzling Apple pie with ice cream and rum sauce... Very very yummy!

Worth checking this place out if you are nearby."}
{"text":"Came here for my son's 23rd birthday. The server was very slow and neglectful, we actually had to chase down another server to get drink refills, nachos and even our cutlery. The food was good, however the fries were just warm at best. There were 7 us at dinner, so not an extensive size group.
We told the server when we arrived that we were celebrating a birthday and it appears that she forgot as other tables got a song from the staff, but not us. Most restaurants even offer the birthday guest a gratis dessert, but nothing here.
Very very disappointing experience.
I wanted to complain but a couple of the ladies in the group didn't want me to. I really should have.
The other servers appeared to be busy and helpful. Ours disappeared somewhere , so I won't judge the entire staff based on this terrible server tonight."}
{"text":"Have visited the Lone Star on Dixon many times. The food is of consistent quality, priced reasonably and delivered with pleasant and hard working staff. I've had a variety of entrees, all good, nothing outstanding, but worth the cost. I've never had to wait long to get a table. 

We usually eat there in conjunction with a park, stay and fly, and it has become somewhat of a family ritual to stop for dinner. 

Good place!"}
{"text":"It's an American chain, need I say more. Taco Bell would have been better than this place. The place was empty that should have been a warning. The food is loaded with sodium from beginning to end to make you drink. We were looking for something fast and easy so on the advice of the waitress we ordered the fajitas. It wasn't fast (30 minute wait), it wasn't good (taco bell is better) and it was way over priced  for what it is ($50.00 no drinks). I don't mind paying for good food but when taco bell got you beat, you are over priced.  Lots of fake smiles and friendly service. Just don't order the food.

Seriously, don't make the mistake I made and wonder into this place unless you are a junk food junkie."}
{"text":"Rating of 2.5 stars - falls short of 3 stars. They did some things well but they fell short in so many ways. The restaurant has a great location, near the ACC, Skydome, Convention centre and hotels. As a result, the place was packed with many families. 

Service was average at best. We were greeted when we arrived and brought to our seats quickly. Things went downhill from there, no servers arrived in the first 15 minutes after we were seated. I had to wave someone down to help us out. Our food and drinks arrived quickly but it took forever to get our bill and pay. 

They give you chips and salsa on the house which is appreciated. The drink menu definitely needs an update in my opinion. They only have big name beers on the menu which goes against the current trend of serving interesting craft beers. Some of my group ordered the frozen margarita's and most found them to sweet. 

I ordered the fajitas since they were making the tortilla shells from scratch in the middle of the restaurant. They had a cool machine with a conveyer belt that carried the freshly made tortilla shells. Like everything else, something good was followed by something poor. When the shells arrived, I was given only three. I ordered the large portion and three shells was not nearly enough.

I tried both the chicken and beef fajitas. Both meats were good quality but not marinated in anyway or cooked in any kind of BBQ sauce. The result - decent fajita's but without any real flavour. These could be amazing fajitas if they add some kick. 

There is so much competition in the downtown core... no reason to settle for average.

{"text":"It's been years since I've stepped into this Lone Star, and having read the reviews on this location I was skeptical, but when my pregnant friend craves chimichangas all week... well, I found myself here yesterday for lunch. 

The decor is rustic, ringing true to the southern feel. From wood stained booths, to cowboy hats and boots, this restaurant goes all out to make you feel like you're in the south. 

Our server was great, we let her know our other guest were running late. No problem, she dropped off our drink orders and some complimentary homemade nachos and salsa and said she'd be back once our full table had arrived. Once everyone arrived, she gave our new guest a few minutes before she popped by to take our orders. 

The \"lunch\" menu is small (4 items), but the dinner menu is all day. We ordered the fish tacos and the chicken chimichanga off the dinner menu. The fish taco meal comes with Mexican rice, refried beans and 2 soft shell tortillas brushed with mole and topped with cheese, slaw salsa and fried tilapia. The fish was fried perfectly, not oily and it stayed crispy in the taco. I would highly recommend this dish. The chimichanga meal comes with Mexican rice, refried beans and a large tortilla stuffed with chicken and topped with ranchero sauce, cheese, sour cream and cilantro. Guacamole used to come free with the meal, but there's an additional cost now. 

The only complaint we had with our meal was the burnt chicken taste in the chimichanga. I recall reading another post on here about that. Kitchen managers, please go back to the old recipe! You now have a couple patrons mentioning this.

All in all, the atmosphere, service and food were up to par for the franchise. Keep it up."}
{"text":"I love the fajitas here! It's a chain with cheesy decor and cowboy hat clad staff, but they have their own fajita machine and do this one meal very well. I can't speak for the rest of the menu, but I can probably safely say don't bother and stick with what they do best.

The margaritas are also great. I guess it should be expected given the Texas theme. The beer list is pretty small, but they have Rolling Rock, so I didn't mind.

The service was prompt and attentive.

This restaurant scores an extra point for being another large alternative for pre-gaming before a Jays game."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times. Food is consistent, service is good. The bar area has TVs, tables with high chairs as well as booths. Love the salsa and chips, so much better than store bought! My mom and I like to get the fajitas. Toppings are always fresh and unlimited.

If you're going there with a large group, call ahead. Dropping in with 30 people and no reservation is not cool. I just hope none of those people wrote a review as it would be completely unfair and not a true representation of the service there. 

I like going here when I have no idea what I want to eat. Something for everyone."}
{"text":"Go to place for fajitas.  Won't order anything else, don't ask me about anything else. Why would you order anything else ?"}
{"text":"We went tonight but they are closed!  For good!. Sign says it will reopen elsewhere summer 2018. My kids were disappointed."}
{"text":"A tex-Mex restaurant chain which originated in Ottawa Ontario and now spread to 22 locations.  FYI the restaurant was once the highest grossing in Canada.

Decor: half the booths had no cushions, \"when we had a refurbishment they were torn and we threw them out\" - replace them perhaps ?

A resourceful staff member took us To a booth with cushioning which as torn on one side and wet from being freshly wiped.

Drinks; marguerita please - \"oh, we have run out of padron\" but recommend another brand - a Google search drew a blank.  Fresh lime - \"no, we use a concentrate and dilute it\" when asked for a tequila plus limes to do a DIY drink we were given an odd stare.

Guacamole - looked like it came from a pump dispenser.

Waitress - \"Please no sour cheese\" - what follows - sour cheese

Seriously - perhaps this establishment deserves to have been left to die rather than thrive as a perveyor of \"zombie cuisine\" ie. Better eaten by the undead...."}
{"text":"Great fajitas.   Although the meat is sweet, and I normally prefer spicy, it at least tastes like something which is much more than a lot of fajitas at restaurants.  

The free nachos and salsa are addictive, I probably don't want to know how many calories are in a whole bowl.   If you can do better than me and keep your portions in check, the nachos are great.

The servers are upbeat, friendly and efficient.   The sodas came with free refills.

They have a special for large groups who are all ordering fajitas that keeps the bill down.   If you each order your own fajitas it is pricey."}
{"text":"Craving fajitas and they had just the fix! Ordered the fajita Fiesta which came with assorted meats and ribs. Although the fajita was absolutely delicious, the best thing was the ribs!"}
{"text":"Great new location! Me and my friend were there for an after Jays game. I got the chicken enchiladas, very tasty and big portion. The service was fast and friendly, very good as usual. I cant get tired of their chips with salsa!!!"}
{"text":"We were having fajitas and all the food came nice and hot - everything looked like it was fresh and smelled amazing. However, I noticed that there was a short curly hair in the rice. 
We immediately stopped eating and called our waiter over - he apologized and said that he was going to get a new order of the chicken and rice. When the 'new order' came, he only brought us half an order of the meat and want really the empathetic to the situation. 
Even though we didn't expect a discount or anything, most restaurant managers would've approached to apologize and offer a discount or some kind. THAT DID NOT HAPPEN HERE. 
I ended up emailing that night and I received NO RESPONSE. We were very disappointed and will no longer return to any Lone Star."}
{"text":"The place is clean, the service is efficient (if you are in a rush because you have tickets for something, this is a safe bet) and the location is convenient.

The food is good but for a casual Tex-Mex and beer joint this place is overpriced.

Much of that is the nature of the location; many of the restaurants and bars here are geared towards tourists. Another factor is that this is a chain and a lot of people will pay a little more for name-brand recognition.

That being said, this place does make its own tortillas which are quite tasty, however it is far from the only place that uses its own tortillas (and chips) in this city. I have no complaints about the food or the service, but I have had better for less money elsewhere.

We spent as much on one appetizer and two pints of beer as we would have on a whole meal in at least 6 other Mexican sit-down restaurants that I can think of in this city.

Plus, like a lot of other bars and restaurants located near the convention centre and ACC this place has no personality. 

It lacks the intimate ambiance of one of the more upscale Mexican places.

It lacks the eclectic music and cool atmosphere of a real Tex-Mex bar & grill.

It lacks the homey charm of many of the smaller family-run Latin restaurants.

It is your typical chain bar/restaurant that tries to be fun in the generic and sterile way that a marketing committee would approve of. 

If you are all ready in the neighborhood and looking for a good meal with good service, this place works.

I wouldn't make a special trip to this place just to have some Southwestern food, though."}
{"text":"I went here with a group of ladies after a successful shopping trip for a future bride. We called ahead and made sure they would be ready for us but when they seated us our tables were dirty. Our server Cow Bell cleaned the tables. D took our drink orders. It he came back about 20 minutes later took our food orders and then disappeared again. A long while after that our sinks arrived and some salsa and chips I ordered for the tables. It was well over an hour before we got our meals and three of them had to be sent back because they were either cold or not complete. There was only one other table in the restaurant so not sure really what took so long. It then took forever to get our bills. Not a great place to go with group. Side note music was lap crazy loud and we could not really talk to each other."}
{"text":"Appetizers eaten before any drinks were brought to the table. 30 minutes after being seated served one drink. Waitstaff non-existent. Manager no help either.  Plenty of other choices in the area do yourself a favor and pick one of them instead.  Bathrooms are disgusting which is a reflection of the entire establishment."}
{"text":"I like the atmosphere here. I know it's typical of most sports bar/grills but it's nice. There is something special about this place that I can't quite put my finger on. I didn't have the opportunity to star too long since we ran in and out of here before we went to sit in the CBC Hockey Night in Canada audience.

The food here was incredible OMG best nacho's ever! They bring you a small dish of complimentary nacho's when you get there and they are delicious! My friend got a burger here and said it was also phenomenal. 

As for the service... IT WAS GREAT! From the moment we walked in the door we were catered to and felt like Texan Cowboys!

The only thing about this place is that it was a tad expensive but typical of it's quality of a restaurant.

If your on front, around the CN Tower drop in here if your looking for a good sports bar. It was a great experience and I'm sure it would have been better if we had the opportunity to stay longer than we did."}

Fresh salsa and chips when you first sit down is a nice touch.

Good value for your money."}

{"text":"While staying at the Hilton nearby, this is the closest restaurant within walking distance.
I was expecting an in-authentic Chain Restaurant and here's the weird part:
It was actually good, not amazing, just harmless generic food.

The decor is nice and the waitresses dress the part. You do have to put up with some country music, but the bar section is sports only.

The food was acceptable, not too spicy or aromatic, but fresh.
The prices are a bit too high to my liking, $17 for tortillas and about $30 for a steak.

They do have free sauce and chips for dipping as well as free refills.

The service was \"fake friendly\", but somehow still a bit distant."}
{"text":"Server was nice. We were seated quickly. 

I ordered the Bubba BBQ Brisket burger with fries. Wish they had put another topping on the burger (literally just brisket on a bun) - bacon or mayo or something would have been good. It was delicious otherwise! Fries were good. 

My partner ordered medium rare rib steak. Was NOT 14oz, no way no how. Also wasn't that great. Veggies and whatnot were good. 

Food took forever to come out."}
{"text":"Stopped by with the family. The place is busy all the time - we had to wait more than half an hour for a table, and the lineup was growing in length as we were seated. Staff are friendly, and the place is pretty family friendly.
The food is pretty good - decent burgers, ribs, wings, fajitas, with a good selection of drinks for kids and adults alike. There isn't anything super specially good about the food, it's just what you expect in this price range delivered without too much wait time.
The bonus is the gluten free selection here. They have a separate gluten free menu with a solid selection of entrees available. There is only one gluten free appetizer and dessert so fill up on the mains.
There is a take out counter so you can grab and go if you choose, and also a sports bar side so you can watch the games while you pig out.
Nice place, but make a reservation first or be prepared to wait a while - the price of success, I guess."}
{"text":"this place sucks! The service is slow and crap, and the cups/cutlery/seats were dirty. It's great that they start u off with free chips and salsa but they were pretty stale. I had the tex mex salad and this was just not good.  I'm biased though because the corn salsa had coriander and raw onions in it, both which i hate with a passion.  do NOT come here"}
{"text":"This is was the first time that I've visited a Lone Star Texas Grill. I was pleasantly surprised by the food. The décor and uniforms of the staff match the whole Texas and wild west theme. 

I enjoyed the salsa and chips that they served. The chips were crunchy and not overly salty. We ordered the fajitas platter to share for 2-3 people. This was just enough for 3 people. I really liked the soft tacos. The consistency of the dough was soft, but with a slight chew to it. They are freshly made too! They have this cool machine on site that makes them.

The steak was cooked well.  The texture of the meat was soft and had a good meaty flavour to it. My only complaint would be that the side dishes that came with the meal weren't fresh. The cheddar cheese was a bit hard, and the lettuce was a bit wilted. Overall I enjoyed my experience here. 

If you are looking for something to eat in the area or close to the airport this is a good option. It was pretty busy for a Wednesday evening especially with the location being so close to the airport and hotels."}
{"text":"When you think of Toronto, what comes to mind?

CN Tower

Texas BBQ

Wha? Texas BBQ? 

Located across from the Toronto Convention Center is the Lone Star Texas Grill and like everything in Texas they do it up BIG at the Lone Star Texas Grill. The restaurant is huge. The restaurant decorations are huge. The menu is huge (well maybe not huge, but I've got a theme going here...work with me people!) and diverse -- as long as you like all things Texas. 

And BBQ.

If the Lone Star Texas Grill were an animated cartoon, it would be owned by Fred Flintstone's rich Uncle Tex Hardrock (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0580159/).

The Lone Star Texas Grill features Big Salads, Mesquite-Grilled Steaks, Ribs and Chicken and more. But, Fajitas seem to be the specialty of the house. The menu claims that as recently as 1986 fajitas were unknown in Canada until their introduction by the Lone Star Texas Grill (http://www.lonestartexasgrill.com/Fajita). Uh-huh. Seems like that might be a Texas sized exaggeration.

Still, my lunch companion and I decided to roll with it. I ordered the steak fajitas and my companion the steak and chicken. While I found the tray of side items to be a bit lacking, just lettuce, cheese, a dab of salsa and some sour cream,  the fajitas themselves did not disappoint. The steak was tender and deliciously seasoned. The beans, rice and sautéed onions were all very good as well. The tortillas were another highlight. Made on site, they were warm to the point of still being a bit doughy even though they were thoroughly baked in the custom tortilla oven. It didn't take long to start filling up, but the food was so good that we were both inclined to overeat. 

The service was attentive and friendly. Our waters and sodas were refilled without asking.

Lunch for two, including tip, was CAD $60.29 which is a lot for lunch. Thank goodness for expense reports! There is a lunch menu also available, so I assume the items on that menu are more targeted for the lunchtime crowd. But we weren't really worried about that, so we stayed with the primary menu.

All in all, a terrific meal. Not five star, because ultimately the Lone Star Texas Grill is just another chain restaurant. Still, I would definitely visit here again for lunch."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  The food is great from the fajitas, burgers, ribs, etc.  You can't go wrong.  The service is great, especially in the bar area where the ladies are both efficient & beautiful."}
{"text":"Typical family restaurant setting: kids everywhere, people in sweats (me included) and a really long wait.

HOWEVER, their tex-mex is actually really good.  The portions are massive, they have great margaritas and I was a big fan of their mexican rice and spicy refried beans.  

Similar to all chain restaurants, but one my favs that I've tried.  Also, our waiter \"red neck\" was extremely nice."}
{"text":"Grill it and they will come.  So here i am.  It seems like a solid crowd for lunch, the food is good the drinks are cold.  I like it.  Steak makes me happy, and right now i am very happy, but in a rush too.  So gotta run.  However, i will be back.  T'was good."}
{"text":"Food and service is great here - the chips and salsa for free is a bonus!"}
{"text":"One of our favourite chain restaurants in Newmarket. The steak Fajitas and shrimp are delicious. The price is reasonable. Lone star after multiple visits, always taste as good as the first time."}
{"text":"Someone felt like fajitas so here we are on a Sunday night.  Place is busy but not full and we got seated promptly.

Ordered the pink Cadillac margarita, fajitas, and chicken avocado salad.  Free salsa and chips to start.   How can you go wrong?

Margarita was good with just enough tequila to make you happy... Salad was fresh and tasty with generous portion of avocado and chicken.  Fajitas were good except for the rice that they also put on the hot plate which promptly burned.

Service is friendly.  I just wish the place was more acoustically kind to not have conversations etc bouncing off the walls and ceiling.  Worth a trip back when you feel like tex mex."}
{"text":"I went to lone star expecting to get a quality meal with quality service. I did not receive that. Half way through my meal I found 2 long black hairs in my fajitas. I told the waitress and she did not comp the whole meal. Extremely disappointed will not be coming back to this location."}
{"text":"terrible service. i was given the wrong order and they forgot my appetizer. your better off going across the street to the keg considering its priced the same.. dont waste your money, its too expensive for the lack of quality and service."}
{"text":"It cost us $50 dollars for dinner for myself and my fiancé and we were literally robbed of that money. We decided last minute to go to Lone Star mostly because I felt like having their chips and salsa which in all honesty was the highlight of the meal. We got sat in a booth, our waitress greeted us and took our drink orders. My fiancé ordered the brisket with a side of rice and I ordered the chicken quesadilla with a caesar salad. When our food arrived, the first bites were just about as terrible as it can get. The quesadilla had barely any vegetables or chicken in it, it tasted bland and felt like I was just eating a tortilla with just a dumping cheese in it. The tiny little caesar salad side that came with it had a bitter dressing to it that just didn't taste right. My fiancé's meal, the brisket with a side of rice, was equally disappointing. To start, the side of rice was more like a tablespoon of rice put into a little bowl and tasted more like it was microwave rice. The meat in the brisket just tasted all wrong, too dry and oddly seasoned. Overall, it was a waste of money. We are never going back. Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"Ok place. 3 stars for being in Canada, would be a 1 star if this was in the  lone star state.

Positives:
- Walking distance from several hotels
- Close to the airport.
- Several TV's in bar
- Good and friendly wait staff
- free chips and salsa
- other choices in the area are a step below this place.

Negatives:
- Poor draft beer selection. They have 8 beers on tap, all taste like Coors. Not one craft beer in the bunch. Sad when corona in the bottle is the best beer they serve.
- Had the Chili jalapeño fire fajitas. Truth in advertising, not one jalapeño on the skillet. Had some mildly spicy red color pepper, but definitely not a jalapeño.
- fajitas also had a sweet sauce poured over the meat. Really? Why?"}
{"text":"Arrived for a lunch and was surprised at the selection of hot sauces...fajitas...delicious chips and salsa!  Enjoyed the chicken bowl with a full avocado!  Crazy friendly service and warm atmosphere.  my new fave in this area."}
{"text":"I just spent the longest time debating on 3 or 4 stars for this place. In conclusion I give it 3.5 (as much as I try to avoid 0.5s on Yelp).

I went there after the Jays home opener (so it was pretty packed with people from the game as it's the first bar we walked by on Front Street).
They are supposedly known for their margaritas and fajitas. We all tried the Texas sized margaritas and yes they were sugary goodness. 
What really makes this a memorable place though is the staff, although I do get the feeling they recommend everything that's pricey on the menu,  apart from that, very friendly and it's fun to hear the \"Yee haw\"s across the PA system every time they do a shout out or announcement of some sorts. 

A big reason I did give this 4 stars was their Birthday \"song\". One person in my group was celebrating his birthday and they do a very cool/\"embarrassing for the birthday person\" Hoedown type of song (and I believe they also take customer volunteers to help too). 

As for the food, we definitely appreciated the complimentary supply of corn nacho chips with salsa that arrive with us to the table. I split a con queso (a cheesy dip) that is said to go with their complimentary chips, it was some what of a better tasting cheese dip with the taste of jalapenos than what you would find at a typical bar I guess. Worth the $6 (especially if you split it!) 
The rest of the dished ordered were nothing spectacular, I would give the food here a simple 3 star rating. 

I would recommend this place especially if you are looking for this type of cuisine. Prices are comparable to something like Jack Astors. This is the Jack Astors from Texas? I think I can safely say that."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a steak.  I didn't hate it.  The flavor was pretty good, maybe 6.5 out of 10, but the cut was awful.  When paying nearly $30 for a ribeye I expected a little better.  I don't mind the fat at all in a ribeye, especially when well marbled, but there was a LOT of gristle.  The staff was polite and patient with the difficult table full of youngsters that we had with our group.  The fajitas seemed like a success for the others in our group, both steak and chicken, although nothing special.  I think by the looks of the burgers and other sandwiches that might be the best bet at this place.  It seemed their ribs were a source of pride but we did not experience those on this visit."}
{"text":"The first and only time I had stepped into a Lone Star Texas Grill was about ten years ago.  I remember that visit as fairly lackluster and since then hadn't had a strong affinity towards Lone Star Texas Grill and their many locations all over Ontario.

However, I have to say that returning here I was honestly blown away by the new look, taste, and flavours of this Tex-Mex chain restaurant.

The Coconut Shrimp was great!  It was perfectly breaded with coconut shavings and fresh out of the fryer.  The Texas Red dipping sauce made it more delicious.

The Lone Star Salad was a healthy and fresh salad made with mixed greens, fresh tomatoes, green peppers, sauteed red peppers and onions, glazed pecans, and jack cheese tossed in a honey spiced citrus vinaigrette.  I liked this salad because there were elements of raw and semi-cooked items.  The honey spiced citrus vinaigrette indeed was a little sweet yet spicy too.  

The Chicken Fingers were really good too.  I also loved the ranch dipping sauce that came with this.

I tried three types of fajitas that night.  (All of their fajitas arrived on a sizzling skillet of grilled peppers and onions and piled high with the protein of your choice [or veggies] and served with fresh-baked tortillas, southwest rice, shredded lettuce, cheddar cheese, sour cream, pico de gallo, and a choice of side.)

Despite sharing family style, we did get our own portion of shredded lettuce, cheddar cheese, sour cream, and pico de gallo.  The fresh-baked tortillas were also served in a container that kept the soft tortillas fresh and hot.

The Mesquite-Grilled Chicken was a boneless chicken breast butter brushed and seasoned with a unique blend of Texas spices.  It was paired with their original recipe mole, which was so good!

The Mesquite-Grilled Steak was a traditional skirt steak seasoned with Lone Star steak salt and then basted and grilled over Mesquite wood.

The Veggie Fiesta was a sight to behold because it looked so amazing piled with fresh avocado wedges.  There were also Mesquite-grilled Portobello mushrooms and Haloumi cheese with grilled peppers and onions as well as black bean and corn salsa.  It was drizzled with traditional chimichurri sauce too.

In my fajita, I put some of the skirt steak, chicken strips, and veggies.  I put mole sauce, guacamole, and some spicy relish too.  I loved how soft the tortilla was!  It was fluffy and a little chewy too and wrapped everything up together so well."}
{"text":"This Lone Star Texas Grill is located near the north west intersection of Carlingview and Dixon on the Etobicoke side of the 427.  

Perhaps a decade?  That's the last time I stepped food in this place.  I live less than 10 minutes away by car and while the airport strip is close to where I live I don't necessarily dine along Dixon often unless it's the Airport Rd side to go to Zet's.  This restaurant is a standalone structure with their own parking lot which is free for patrons and while the establishment has a large bar and dining area (separate) the amount of total seating this place offers is quite staggering and they seem to be able to fill it, at least the evening we were there.

It was the choice of the mother of the birthday boy to select this place and while I like Tex/Mex I know this place is a chain type place, you know like Chili's.  My problem is that I'm spoiled and I'm not afraid to admit it.  I'm spoiled by having good to decent to amazing Mexican food and the Tex/Mex spin well we're nowhere near the Rio Grande so... ya.  I get that this place won't be awesome but can it be at least decent?  That's what my expectations were coming into this place.

Well I ended up ordering the Fajita Fiesta which includes, grilled chicken, grilled steak, shrimp, 4 bones of pork ribs and the other sizzling things on the platter for two which I shared with my wife.  The meal comes with all the sides included which are unlimited that you'd also expect like lettuce, tomatoes, cheese etc.  Flour tortillas also come in those plastic holding containers and have maybe 4 or 5 in each.  

Not for anything but honestly there's really nothing special about the food here.  Based on the fact that there's some really good Mexican/Central American/South American places here in the city as far as the south of the border (US border that is) it's not like we don't have the capability of having better options up here.  This place though I don't know if it's the fact that it's a chain or that they're catering to the broader general public there's absolutely nothing of risk on this menu.  The quality of the fajitas, side and everything else honestly tastes like it was made for that type of consumption.  From the cheese looking like it came out of those ready shredded bags from Kraft to the blandness of the meat to the hot sauces that are not even remotely hot, yup this place is that type of place.  Still, I wasn't expecting the kind of authenticity I'd find in the US but rather exactly what this place is which is a chain Tex/Mex environment.  

Chichi's back in the day was also a chain Tex/Mex (more Mex perhaps?) and their fried iced cream was actually really good.  The version here was a disappointment I'm afraid to say.  The crunch was not hot and crunchy but rather cold and soggy.  

My friend's mom ordered a frozen marguerita you know, it's a special event why not have a special drink?  It came in a plastic stein type mug, not a stemmed glass with flash.  Me, I was just drinking brand name beer.  To sum it up going to the Lone Star and expecting good Tex/Mex is like going to Red Lobster or Bubba Gump and expecting good seafood.  They're simply \"chained\" to their own rhythm so don't expect extraordinary, just expect standard status quo.

The service was good and friendly although it seemed a bit disorganized but overall the service was fine.  The tables could have been cleared a bit faster and without us having to ask however."}
{"text":"Although a bit campy, Lone star is great for always delivering similar service and food quality. Love splitting the fajitas with friends. Affordable and the freshly made tortillas always make for a good addition to the meal."}
{"text":"Came for a quick bite. Pretty good. Really enjoyed the chips and dip. Glad it is family friendly environment. Found the fajitas portion a bit off. But overall glad with my experience."}
{"text":"We ordered vegetarian Fajitas and drank the 3 Amigos Margaritas, which was good and well served by a waiter called Lighting, who also guided us to choose the appropriate dish to order. Overall a good restaurant, will definitely visit it again.

The ambience of the restaurant was good and literally made us feel to be in Texas"}
{"text":"No more nachos chips, menu has been greatly reduced, food quality is fair to poor, sevice was slow but attentive."}
{"text":"I don't know what it is about Lone Star, but its one of the few chain restaurants I actually don't mind frequenting. Despite not having ordered a ton of things on their menu, I'm a huge fan of their always hot and fresh tortilla chips and their generous fajitas for two.

Although Lone Star isn't the most upscale or the most casual of restaurants, it's over the top campiness and environment makes for a pretty fun date night or a simple dinner with friends. Recommend trying if you're around."}
{"text":"My wife & I have been to Lone Star several times, & have yet to be disappointed.  The food quality is consistently good, & the service is good as well.  The interior is decorated in a western theme, with lots of cowboy boots & other items adorning the walls.  The servers all use western nicknames, much like the Melanie Pringle's staff use 50's-inspired names.

Their fajitas are excellent, although the only complaint I could make is that they could put a little more on the skillet for what you're paying.  The fajitas aren't cheap, & when I was working in restaurants \"back in the day,\" I know our fajitas looked mountainous compared to Lone Star's.  Despite the slightly smallish fajita portions, my wife orders them every time.  I've tried various things on their menu & haven't been let down yet.  I found their brisket sandwich, peppercorn burger, ribs & fajitas to all be of good quality & their chicken fingers are excellent.  When we order a kids' portion for our son, I'm usually hoping that he can't eat them all & that I can help him out.

The prices are about average for a family restaurant & we'll be back there for sure."}
{"text":"Decent food ,  good service.
Steak was slightly overdone .  Tortillas are home made and excellent.
The free salsa and chips are great .
The calamari appetizer wasn't very good."}
{"text":"What great service! Our party of 6 arrived around 1pm for a sober up lunch! The waitress was friendly and very attentive! You know you will get great service when you waitress does not have a pad of paper for your order! 

She brought us some chips and salsa when we sat and kept refilling it once it was empty.  I ordered the BBQ bacon burger. At the table we had two sharing fajita another burger with avocado and a Cesar salad.

The restaurant is quiet large and has a fire place in the middle of the seating area. Lots of booths and plenty of cocktails and drinks.

The food was great and they brought two sets of taco shells and veggies for the couple strong the fajita.

This was a great location with great service. If you have a layover or your plane is delayed, this is a great space to kill an hour or two.  

Definitely worth a visit if your near the airport !!"}
{"text":"The fajitas are absolutely the best here.
Steak n' shrimp combo can't be beat. The soft, warm and tender tortilla shells are made in house. No jokes.

You can see their tortilla wrap machine as you walk into the dining room. It's pretty cool, mini conveyor belt style. Kinda reminds me of the Krispy Kreme days...

The service is top-notch too. She was friendly and visible, so it was easy to get her attention for  refills or napkins. She also inspired my gf and I to continue heading to the gym but that's another story.  

The atmosphere is lively and the food is fresh. I forgot to mention the complimentary chips and salsa. This was one of the highlights of our dinner. I kid you not, they were fresh, crispy and not too salty. They were perfect with the salsa!

Overall, it's a great place for buddies to hang out and eat. It's also a place for a date because it's casual and the decor around the restaurant is something to bring up for conversation.

Giddy up fellow Yelpers!"}
{"text":"This is true tex-mex.  My sister in law is from Texas and she loves it.

They have a machine that makes fresh tortillas, which the kids love.  But the best part is you can get quality steaks or fajitas for a reasonable price. Great for family's or large functions."}
{"text":"Went here for fajitas with husband and son. My husband and I shared a fajita for two, which I can undoubtedly say it was the worst we have ever had! I could only have a bite and my husband ate half of first wrap until he just gave up. The guacamole was old and disgusting and the chicken was not grilled! I'm sure it was cooked in a different manner and than just placed on this non-sizzling, cold iron board! It tasted like boiled chicken more like it! Our son had a steak which was very average and at a cost similar to keg. 
When our waitress, Tennessee, came to clean up, she clearly noticed that the whole fajita dish was barely touched. She asked if we wanted it to go and we politely said it was not good at all. She then proceeded to bring the full bill (100$) and that was that. 
Overall, the food was not worth it at all and the service was very disappointing especially when there was a clear message that the food was disliked, fact which was ignored and no remedy was offered.  
You are better off and in the similar price category to go to keg, jack Astors, moxies, bullocks etc."}
{"text":"My wife and kids love it here and me too.  Great service and great food!  The Mexican style food is great and the steaks are awesome.   A good selection of beers too.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I kept seeing this place every time I went downtown for something. I have always wanted to try it. So after the raptor game we went! I'm so glad we did!

The service started off very slow- we couldn't get anyone to notice us at the front for a few minutes and the place wasn't that busy. But, we got a seat as soon as someone spotted us. Our waitress was super nice and helpful with what was good and what was to be avoided.

The food was delicious! We ordered the Dos fajitas. Buffalo chicken which was more so flavourful then overpowering. So yummy. The fajita fixings were delicious as well! Lettuce, cheese, Queso just to name a few:-) The only thing is I wish they gave more Mexican rice. 

I would definitely come back here for some more fajitas! Yum yum!"}
{"text":"Lone star has been my favourite restaurant for years now, but recently it has really been decreasing in value. The price has just ket going higher for the quality of food tat just keeps getting lower and lower. I don't enjoy this restaurant. The fajita wraps are very thick and very small. They meat is fatty and a very cheap cut of meat. They provide you with very few condiments for your fajitas. Oh and should I'm mention THAT YOU NEED TO PAY FOR YOUR CHIPS AND SALSA. And frankly they charge you and expensive amount for chips tomatoes and onions. I don suggest you go to this restaurant. The food s bad and not authentic, the service is bad and so is the price. I you want good authentic Mexican food with better service go to La Tequiza in the Vaughan mills plaza."}
{"text":"If you've been to mexico or even texas you know this is far from the ''real deal'' but it is not terrible. This location in particular is the best one I've been to. I only order the fajitas and they come in quite an abundance. they make their own tortillas. and the chips n salsa are free so you can't go wrong with that.
You are looking at $16+ for fajitas for one (1/2 pound) so they are a bit on the pricey side. But when I crave fajitas they are my first choice."}
{"text":"The best Torts in Town! If you have ever studied law you'd know why that's amusing.

This is a pretty nice place for its purpose. The food is pretty decent, the service is ok for the most part and it's pretty family friendly. I like the quesidillas. They could do a little better on their beer selection, why not get some ontario craft brews guys? Bud and Coors? Am I going south of the border? 

Regardless, I like this place, i've been back a number of times. I probably will go back."}
{"text":"We dropped by for lunch on a Saturday afternoon. The restaurant wasn't crowded yet there seemed to be no staff. We waited a long time (like two servings of tortilla chips later) before someone came to take our order. Anyway, it took even longer for our meal to come out. We waited..and waited...and waited. Looking around the restaurant, I noticed that practically every table was waiting for their meal. A little while later I noticed a large group (10 or so) receiving their meals. It seemed everyone was focused on this group including the manager. The manager, rather than apologizing to the other guests for taking a long time, spent her time tending to the tortilla and directing her staff as they tended to the large group. 

We eventually received our meal. It was ok. Nothing to write home about but no complaints either...at least about the food. We had absolutely zero service. No drink refills. Nothing. 

Definitely not the fault of the staff as they get their marching orders from above. Poor, poor, very poor management."}
{"text":"I have to rate Lone Star a 5!  They have the absolute best chicken fajitas anywhere. And it's not so much the chicken part as much as its the tortillas part. OMG their tortillas are to die for - cooked one at a time in a special oven right there in the restaurant. 

I've always been seated quickly. The restaurant is pretty big, so there's lots of space. The free chips and salsa are awesome and served right away. The wait staff is friendly and quick. And the food never takes more than 15 minutes when I'm with 2 people. (Went with a group of 8 once and it took a wee bit longer.)

I would definitely recommend Lone Star to anyone looking for a neat place to eat!"}
{"text":"Came here last yearafter an amazing experience at their Ottawa location. It was nothing but utter disappointment; tried to give it a shot again and this place has gone to the dogs. We left after an hour with no meal served, 2 flat drinks, horrendous service, no decency of filling up the complimentary chips since we were waiting.  Saw two similar poorly served customers leaving as well. To top it all the place was not even half full.

This lonestar location sucks, please avoid it like the plague."}
{"text":"Wow what a perfectly horrible experience.  Our food took approximately 30 minutes to arrive and when it did the fajitas had no toppings.  The burrito came with french fries(??) And one of our meals came on a plate that did not look like it had been washed.

One full meal went back (and returned 15 minutes later meaning the rest of us ate while one person ate alone).

One of our drinks came in a glass that was cracked all the way around the glass.

The people at the table behind us sent their meals back and it looked like nearly everyone was having difficulties.

We wish we had read the reviews here prior to deciding on this location.

A truly bad meal experience."}
{"text":"The Mesquite Chicken Fajitas were excellent. We ordered the \"for one person\" order, and it was large enough for two people. We almost struggled to finish the last fajita.  4 start for the food.

The staff on the other hand, could be a little more pleasant. Maybe the dining area staff is nicer, but the bar area are little cold !  2 star for the attitude."}
{"text":"Huge disappointment. We didn't mind the wait for a table but the wait for our dinner was ridiculous and it was cold when it arrived. My husband's beer glass was sticky on the bottom and the draft was bitter. 
Waste of money. At least our server was pleasant. Sad night out for our family of 5 for dinner."}
{"text":"I only come to Lone Star for one thing, the fajitas.  I won't be able to comment on anything else but the fajitas are pretty solid.

The good:
- Unlimited salsa with chips (they even brought them out to me while I was waiting for a table!)
- Lots of seating so there's usually very little wait unless there's a game
- Fajita fix-ins (lettuce, cheese, tomatoes, sour cream) and the tortillas are unlimited
- Prices are pretty reasonable - about $20 per person if you get Fajita Fiesta

The bad:
- Could have a better beer selection
- Fajita side-kicks are not unlimited:
(Guacamole, Jalapeño Relish, Saddle Beans, Refried Beans, Queso, Roasted Tomatillo Salsa, Chimichurri, Pepita Mole, Chili Fire Jalapeno)

Tip: if you sign up on their website for their newsletter, you can get a free appetizer."}
{"text":"I really like this place for a chain restaurant. Tex-Mex food is not easy to find in these here parts and they do it pretty well. Also, free tortilla chips and salsa while you wait? Yes, please!

The servers are nice, try and make conversation and all have ridiculous fake country names which I find hilarious and kind of cool.

It's hardly incredible but I'd much rather come here than a place like Montanas, for example."}
{"text":"The restaurant inside is very nice. It's clean, well maintained and the staff is very attentive. My husband and I are visiting from the US and were quite surprised that we couldn't get a medium rare hamburger. So I ordered it medium. I got well-done. It was like eating cardboard. I mentioned to my husband that the meat had been frozen as well. I took one bite and sent it back. 

My husband had the burger with pork belly. His burger was also well done and he said it lacked flavor, but he was hungry so he ate it. Hubs also got onion rings, but didn't like them. 

We spoke with the manager. He did admit that the hamburgers came pre-formed and frozen (thawed prior to cooking) and the onion rings came out of a box as well. 

I will give them credit though. They comped our ticket, only charging me for my beer."}
{"text":"Been here only once and man the service sucked here

Service was soooooo bad

Our server that was serving us decided to pay more attention to two females he was serving instead of our table

Took him almost 10 minutes to take our drink order

Another 15 for the food

Food came out slow as well

Don't get me started about how long it took for the bill

I didn't want to give him a tip but my wife instead tipped him a small tip

Will not go back to this location"}
{"text":"Those tortilla chips just keep coming!  (Unless you tell them to stop lol)

The waiter who served us was very attentive and helpful in making our final choice in regards to the order.  

We both got the 9oz. flat iron steak that came with a salad to start, veggies and a side. 

I got the medium rare steak with ceaser salad and onion rings.  

Steak was cooked to perfection: as soon as I cut into it a bit of blood so juicy squirted out.  I was simply impressed and my mouth even salivates just thinking back.  

No complaints whatsoever, my boyfriend and I will certainly like to come back in the near future."}
{"text":"I've visited different locations of Lone Star throughout the GTA. They are usually okay. The Newmarket/East Gwillimbury location is fine but sometimes service is enthusiastic to start and then it fades away. I usually have to budget for a couple of hours for dinner as a result. On one hand, you don't like to be rushed but on the other hand, you can wait a long time for food and drinks. The quality of the food is usually fine too, I haven't had any problems. I usually order the chips and salsa (there is now a nominal charge for these), a Golden Cadillac margarita and fajitas. If they could be more consistent with their service, I would improve my overall rating."}
{"text":"Waited more than 30 min in line..hockey team players grpup of about 10 came in after and were told 1hr wait. They started chatting up the manager and then got a nice big booth ahead of about 5 families waiting..must have slipped the guy a $50. Unacceptable Will not return."}
{"text":"Walked in.  Stood there for 5 min.  No-one to greet us and show us to a table.  

Service was so so.  The girl improved as we stayed. There were a lot of servers on for a Friday afternoon. 

I've been here a few times.  Maybe next visit I will just do drinks at the bar.  

Food is ok."}
{"text":"It was across from my hotel so easy to get there, ate at the bar and the food was pretty good although the draft beer selection was a bit limited. Had 2 guys sitting next to me who had way too much to drink and who ended up picking a fight on the way out and were escorted out. Strange to see a \"Texas\" place in Toronto but it was OK."}
{"text":"Good service.
Decent food. 
Onion ring can use bit more flavor but the soup, fajitas, poutine and steak salad were great."}
{"text":"My mom and I stopped in for a quick drink while we waited for our dinner reservation down the street. Note, we didn't try any food while we visited.

When we first sat down the bar top was pretty dirty (crumbs, wet spots, etc) and we had to ask the bartender for a cloth to wipe it down.

Service was friendly and prompt. Our drinks were a-ok.

Would return again for a couple of drinks if I was in the area."}
{"text":"Used to come here all the time.  Great service and food guaranteed.  Even wrote head office about this location's greatness.  BUT something has changed here, and it's beyond apparent after three visits. Culture change required? Not sure. But used to be a home run, now it's so-so. I guess on Yelp it's A-OK now, but it used to be a Woohoo! without a thought."}
{"text":"Stake was very good. Service was a bit slow but we had a big family so it's understandable. Fish and salads where good as well."}
{"text":"Went on family day with a friend. Was very busy. A 20-30 minute wait. No worries we wxpectwd it as it was right at dinner time and it was a holiday. I found they handled the wait very well. The only downfall is they need a bigger waiting area. It is amazing how rude people get when they here how long the wait is. Relax people it is dinner time it is bound to be busy. Food was great as always. I have a food allergy and they were able to cater to my needs. Will go back for sure."}
{"text":"There are few places to go for decent tex mex. Good portions. Great salsa and chips before meal. Drinks are large. Service is sometimes slow. Not a place to go in a rush. Tonnes of parking. Loud restaurant."}
{"text":"Not what I expected. My last visit was 2 years ago with a group for a birthday. 

Food was \"meh\" most of it was overpriced. I would much rather go to a Taco Bell. The quesada's were & $16.30.... Really???

Service was slow (20-25 minutes) before a sever came by our 10 person reservation. The decor was dated, and the place needed a sweep. 

Not recommended."}
{"text":"Been a few times and have been served cold food, had bad service and mostly just not a good feel.  Sorry for not being more specific, but I really tried hard to wash the memories of the place from my soul.  Still have nightmares of it."}
{"text":"Went to watch the leafs game opener. The service was great, all the servers were very attentive. We also got free shots for every goal the Leafs made that night which was a bonus. The free chips and salsa was good! I ordered the burrito, which I felt like was meh, the beans on the side was dry and boring, burrito itself couldn't pick up to consume... The chicken salad was amazing though (tried some off the bf)"}
{"text":"Fajitas are good but is getting expensive.  Better dinners for less available elsewhere.  Their homemade Flour Tortillas are usually under baked and therefore almost raw tasting.  Usually send most of them back to get replaced.  

Caesar salad dressing is overly sweet tasting and they normally put too much on.  

Just okay.  Not great."}
{"text":"We came here for the fajitas and that's what we got. They were very good, I thought. But it's still hard to rate this place more than 3 stars. It just doesn't stand out as anything other than another cheaply priced chain restaurant.

Service was nice but slow."}
{"text":"This place is just A-OK. They are known for their nachos and fajita. So if you are in the mood  for that, then this is a great place to go. 

The good things:
1) there is a patio!
2) the nachos come free!
3) It is family friendly. 

This place has been in Pickering for as long as I can remember. I am not that old, but I am old enough... and it has been here long enough. So it is good because it is that \"old faithful\" kind of a place that may trigger a bit of nostalgia from decades ago. 

The not-so good:
1) You may have to wait... sometimes 20mins.. it just depends. But the way I see it, I can run home and put something together in that same amount of time... I want to eat NOW! I don't like to wait... but here it may happen. I guess that speaks to its popularity. 
2) They have deals. One of which is the Family fajitas for $44. This sounded like a great idea until it was only offered in chicken or beef. We asked for the veggie one but the deal wasn't offered for vegetarian. I don't quite get it, because generally veggies are cheaper than meat but I guess I am not as good in economics as I once thought. =S

If you are out of ideas on where to eat, this place isn't that bad, but I wouldn't go rushing out to try this place especially since I predict it will be here for a little longer."}
{"text":"We used to come to Lone Star a lot back in the day when it was a fun experience @ a reasonable cost. Imagine being rushed to the point of having the servers not give you a chance to look @ the bill or even give you the daily specials?

How would you like to spend a day's pay on three appetizers, one beer and a margarita? Now you can! Cold nachos for $15, tortilla with chicken for $11 and a few cold fries and cold gravy for $71 for all with tip. 

Has the new menu with $17.50 chimis and $35 fajitas made this place the envy of the Keg? You decide.  Except you get server who rush to turn over tables, cold soulless food, and a forgettable experience. Note to the media person who is reaching out to the good folks who left other reviews, take a hint and observe and solicit feedback in the moment about the quality from a holistic perspective."}
{"text":"Tortilla maker wasn't working, so didn't get to order what I wanted.  Took 15 minutes to get a Pepsi and much longer to get our meals.  Had the nachos and it was meh.

All in all, it was not a good first experience!"}
{"text":"Still churning around in Mediocreland.  I find I frequently go to Lone Star, but only if it is someone else has made the choice.  On the way there tonight, I detoured past another new restaurant hoping it was finally open.

Sure, the food tastes good, but the portions are downright dainty--not \"Texas Sized\".  I had the combo fajitas, steak and shrimp with the refried beans as an additional side for $22. One tortilla held the 9 morsels of steak, and the next tortilla held all of the shrimp.  I had two more tortillas left and no more protein, so I used the refried beans as a protein substitute so I could finish the veggies.  The most generous part of the meal was the high price.

And here begins the rant about inconsistent marketing. A Texas style restaurant with Parisienne size portions = fail.  Servers who walk around introducing themselves with rugged names like \"Rawhide\" and \"Stetson\" while disco music plays in the background = fail.  And a new menu that has a lot less to offer than I have seen in the past just feels like more failure.  At least the speed of the service seems to have a \"siesta\" vibe to it..."}
{"text":"I'd never been here before but my brother goes all the time so I figured it must be good. My husband and I went and ordered the fajita's for two. What we received was what I've received at other restaurants for one person. The tortilla was slightly under cooked and doughy but I will say, their salsa is fantastic! Over all, I was not impressed and will most likely, not go back."}
{"text":"Great food, but service is lacking. I've been here several times now, and every time I've ordered the fajitas (which I do every time I go) they get the order wrong and don't bring all the fixings that are promised in the menu.

They never bring enough shells or sour cream/cheese/lettuce/salsa, you always have to ask for more. They never bring guacamole unless you ask for it (which the menu says is included) . This stuff is supposed to be unlimited so why are they so stingy with the toppings?  For the amount of meat you get , they need to be bringing more toppings to start off.

And they never put enough grilled peppers in their fajitas, you always get 90% onions and 10% peppers (maybe you get one or two for the whole dish).

One time I asked for guacamole, they brought me an extremely chunky poorly-made one, that was not blended properly, had to send it back.

The last time we went there this weekend, we asked for no onions and extra peppers in the fajitas, but when the plate arrived, it was their standard lots of onions and barely any peppers. So we had to send it back and wait for them to make it up again.

They really need to pay attention to orders and get it right the first time. And for god's sake, put more grilled peppers in the fajita dishes, don't be so stingy."}
{"text":"This is the new location since it recently moved from Front Street. Not much has changed about the place except the prices maybe and the fact that they now charge $1 for extra chips and salsa. I do love the chips though so I don't find it troublesome. I visited this location 2 days after their grand opening and found it was really quiet - possibly because it was on a weekend. 

I tried their burger and fries and was extremely happy with how soft the brioche bun was and how juicy the burger was. I would go back for this burger however now that the restaurant has been open for quite some time I wonder if the quality of the food is still good.

I will definitely visit this place again."}
{"text":"I love Mexican food and Tex-Mex but find my visits to Lone Star are few and far between. It's not that the food is bad. It's not. It just seems inauthentic. Pre-fab. It's like considering East Side Mario's to be authentic Italian food. It's just not. For a quick fix, sure. Lone Star is good. But for the real deal, the choices are slim in the area unfortunately."}
{"text":"oh my, where to begin?
This was a pretty dang bad dining experience. unfortunately, it wasn't a lot of the 'just a bad night' kind of things...it was poor management and incredibly horrible product.

let's begin, shall we?

First of all, it was late. I was heading home from a gig and there's not a lot open for food at that hour (10:30-11pm). We saw a Montanas in the same area, and we like Montanas, but decided that we'd try Lone Star as a change.

i dropped in quickly to make sure they were still open, even tho the sign outside said they were open till midnight. (Hey, things change, etc...late night is never a guarantee)

Not a single employee to be found. A few patrons. Some loud hip hop being cranked on the stereo system.  No servers, no bartenders, no one at the counter...I looked around the restaurant (didnt' just stay at the front desk).  Finally I saw a server clearing a table and practically had to run after her she was so uninterested in what was going on.  \"Yeah, they're open for another hour\"

Great...so we park, come in.  Restaurant is closed but could we eat int eh bar.  sure.  One table available...underneath the speakers.  Cranking that same horrible hip hop/urban pop.  

Nevermind, we're hungry.

It was only a little annoying when the server/bartender (an elvish little number, with CFM cut offs, boots and basically a redneck Hooters look) decided to fall into her obviously well rehearsed semi-flirtatious litany of quick bar choices.  I mean, she was a little too flirty for 2 obviously gay men ( aka we were dressed better than the rest of the guys in there, trimmed our nose hairs, and went to the gym).

Nevermind, we're hungry.

Bartender makes a crack about her DM being there, else she would join us for a margarita.  She made this crack to every other table within earshot, incidentally.

Curiously enough, we figured out who the DM was: the loud obnoxious drunk guy in the bar with his buddies partying.  Delightful!

Waitress who delivered our food dumped a whole bowl of sauce on my partner.  He was wearing a brand new Under Armour shirt.  They brought him plenty of 'moist towlettes'....okay, finally a wet washcloth.  yup, it was ruined (which we didn't discover till we got home & soaked it).  I had bought it for him cuz it was red and looked great.  Nordies.  Expensive.  The waitress said she'd take care care of his meal. When the bill came, waitress was gone, we informed the bartender/server.  The DM came back and gave us *half* off *one* of the meals.

Yeah...$6 off after ruining a  shirt.  Nice! 

Other exciting highlights:
- Service was sporadic.  we noticed that for a long period of time, the bartender/server (aforementioned provocatively dressed female), the DM and 2 of the DM's friends (a rather unseemly bunch) returned together from the back 'employees only' area of the bar.  Bwahahahaha.  you know, in the strange way that you immediately think of drug deals/use or sexual favours.  Not saying that was going on, but the sheepish looks on faces, the body language, the innnnnteresting situation of ALL the working members of the restaurant being off the floor at the same time....?  Puhleeez

- The place is Tex Mex...I had the Tijuana burrito. Someone should give their marketing people a map.  I'm sure y'all know that TJ is not near Texas. If you're unaware of that fact, then I'm sure you'll miss the tidbit that TJ doesn't really enter into the scope of 'TexMex'.  (\"It's in Mexico\", as my Canadian native partner stated (I live about 14 miles from TJ incidentally))  TexMex & TJ style Mexican food are QUITE different.  durrrrrr

- Oh, and btw - The TJ burrito was nasty.  It was barely seasoned ground beef. And i'm unsure how they found jalepenos that had absolutely no flavour at all, but somehow they exist.  not that I was expecting a capsacin orgasm at a chain restaurant, but it was just tragically....bad.

- Random and various disturbing restaurant frights: Sticky floor, dirty tables, filthy window sills.  I'm amazed we didnt' get food poisoning actually.

So, about a $60 meal, plus a shirt ruined  for having our eardrums assaulted, our sensibilities accosted, insulted, required to put up with loud obnoxious drunks because of the fact he is the District Manager (!) and fed barely edible gristly crap presenting itself as \"TexMex\"

you'd think Texas would sue them for food slander

AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COSTS!
You have been warned.

No wait, it could almost be kitschy like a tragic dive bar...or the gastronomic equivalent of the Jerry Springer show.  Then again, you may like the Jerry Springer show...and crappy food.  Enjoy!"}

Chicken Tortilla soup to die for, peppercorn burger is great also!

{"text":"We came here for a quick dinner on my birthday from the recommendation from my husband.
The all you can eat chips and salsa was a nice touch and was very yummy.
I ordered the brisket burger with fries, I wasn't very impressed with the food.
The brisket was fatty and sinewy and I ended up taking it off my burger and just eating the burger on it's own.
The fries were way over salted making this meal VERY sub-par...
I think the only part of the meal I enjoyed was the free chips and salsa. 
Our waitress wasn't very attentive, she kept dropping things, took way longer than normal to refill our drinks and accidentally threw a knife at my husband... yea not impressed.. Maybe I'd try a different location next time."}
{"text":"Just had dinner here for the first and last time. Hubby and I both had ribs. Ribs would have been good, except they were cold by the time they came. We didn't get the onion rings that are supposed to be included. 
The waitress seemed to be in a rush. She took my plate as soon as I put my napkin down. My hubby wasn't finished when she took his plate. 
I won't be going back in a hurry."}
{"text":"Very good food, (try the steak fajitas) The restaurant is very large and has a nice patio. 

The tortillas are made in house and it was doughy and delicious. The server was really attentive, providing us with all the extras that we wanted and getting refills just when we wanted them. Another bonus is that once you are seated, they treat you to free tortilla chips and salsa for you to munch on, while you decide on the menu. 

The Apple Sizzler is amazing!!"}
{"text":"This is a decent place to go for brews and eats before a ball game. The beer is a little pricier than most places but on par for the area, which gets spillover crowds from the Rogers Centre and the theatres in the area. The ambience--Texas trailer town--is kind of hokey, but I didn't find that the girls in cutoff jean shorts troubled me much. Not my go-to place, but I'd go back."}
{"text":"Lonestar on Front Street for me makes me think of GREAT food but IFFY service!

For the staple fajita or taco dish, this restaurant is just delicious! No matter how many times I think I am going to order something else, I always spring for the fajitas or try a different mexican-inspired dish.

The fajitas are so delicious because of the choices of meat and the toppings you get to create your yummy creation. 

First off, you get a choice of beef or chicken, which is cooked and grilled with amazing seasonings and spices.

You also get a wonderful toppings platter, which consists of fresh crunch lettuce, chopped tomatos in a salsa/bruschetta format, cool sour cream, smooth but tangy guacamole and punchy cheddar cheese.

To wrap these tasty ingredients up, you get the BEST FAJITA SHELLS IN THE CITY, all warm and soft. I am telling you, after I am done with my actual food for the fajitas, if there is a shell left, I am devouring that as an extra snack. They are just amazing and are always fresh.

As for drinks, who could go wrong with a great margarita or daquiri?

Lonestar makes those amazing frozen drinks with flavours such as raspberry, strawberry, banana, mango or the traditional lime taste.

If I get my fajitas and a drink, my entire meal ends up being around $19.

The Lonestar on Front Street offers up all of this delicious food and great bar space and large screen TVs to catch any sports game, but the only thing I have to warn you about is the service.

Sometimes you get lost in the shuffle there, which can leave you at the table for a long time, either waiting to order or to grab your bill."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I was an avid customer here for the last six years (came at least once a week). What I am about to describe is perhaps the worst dining experience I've ever had in my short life. Alright here it goes, my visit on Friday June 30th 2017:
- 6:36pm - we arrived at the restaurant and were told it would be a short 5 to 15 minute wait (which it was, we were a party of two)
- 6:41pm - we were seated at our table with our menus by a hostess (which by the way walked is around the entire restaurant before seating us at our table) 
- 6:49pm - table seated after us (directly behind myself) was served by our waiter who served us just last week
- 6:55pm - made eye contact with not one, but three waiters, all of whom have served us in the past (though none of which came over)
- 7:11pm - family directly in front of us seated and served immediately by one of the waiters with whom I made eye contact
- 7:15pm - concerned waitress from other side of the restaurant came over to ask if we had been served. She was notified we were unable to order or eat as we had no time ( we were going to don mills VIP for 8:10pm). She seemed genuinely upset. 

As a longtime customer I am utterly disgusted by the complete lack of service. You completely failed to recognize two people sitting at a table with menus for over thirty minutes. We were not offered a drink of any description, nor did anyone take our order until the time specified above. Whatever changes have occurred over the last few months to your establishment have not been for the better. I can confidently say I will never visit your restaurant again as I have never been ignored as a paying customer ever."}
{"text":"Good spot for dinner and a movie. Unfortunately, I am from NJ...8+ hours away.

If you drive like a good Samaritan. 

This place was awesome! They had WiFi, food, drinks and NHL. What more could you ask for?

Our bartender/waitress was pretty cool. Very sociable...thought we were from Ontario until my friend said \"awesome\" with an \"accent\".

I ordered the Texas Po' Boy Sandwich and boy was that thing interesting looking. 

The presentation was ahhhsuum!

The cheese looked like an intricate web of gold protecting a nest of bell peppers, grilled onions and chicken. It tasted like real food. Wholesome. Good. Filling. 

My friend ordered what I wanted to get:

The Santa Fe Chicken Sandwich. It looked like two thick triangular slices of awwwwsooome.

The experience was great and I would recommend this place to any out of towner. 

It was aawwwhhhhssssooooooemmm."}
{"text":"If every restaurant were run like this one, the world of dining out would be changed.

I've been to this restaurant countless times. First off, the food is delish. It's a Tex-Mex menu that's varied and tasty. My favourite is the soft-shell vegetarian fajitas (portabella mushrooms, peppers, etc) or shrimp fajitas, served on fresh-made tortillas and served with barbecue beans. Mmmm. And the portions are more than generous.

On weekends there is often a line to get in, but every so often a server will come through the packed foyer with a tray of small plates of tortilla chips and salsa for people to nosh on while they wait. Sometimes they'll serve small cups of margaritas. The wait doesn't seem so long when they're feeding you!

The service is consistently great: always attentive, friendly and helpful.

I don't know if it's the owner or manager who I see running this place, but whatever his position, he's brilliant.

You can see him patting servers on the shoulder when they've done well and high-fiving the staff after a large party has been well looked after. He clearly has an affinity for managing young people and creating a \"team\" work culture.

Whenever there has been any delay - because the restaurant is full and there are large groups being served - the manager is quick to visit other tables and apologize, offering a free appetizer or dessert. Customers never feel ignored at this restaurant. (Seriously, this guy should teach restaurateurs how to run a restaurant!)"}
{"text":"Yummy I can still taste the Lonestars amazing food. I ordered a dinner for 2. The tacos were soo soft the food was nice and hot the way I like it. I have to go back. The price was right, didnt think the server was that attentive to us but the place was busy."}
{"text":"Would like to let you know that you now have to pay for the complementary chips ($1.00 each serving). 

The fiesta fajitas has gone up $17.00. It's use to be $65.00 and it's now 82.00. I'm surprised they still have free refills on soft drinks. 

I didn't know they were hurting that bad.  

Will not be back here and the worse part is that this use to be my favorite restaurant."}
{"text":"This was my first time this at Lone Star location. I think I went to another one in Mississauga but it was years ago. Anyway we were going for my daughter's birthday and with it being a Saturday night I made a reservation. We got there a couple of minutes early but our table wasn't ready. We were told it would be a few minutes and as soon as a table opened up we would be seated. But I made a reservation....doesn't that mean a table should be \"reserved\" for us???  After about a fifteen minute wait, and another party being seated ahead of us who had just walked in, we finally got seated. 

The food was good, although I found the condiments served with the fajitas a bit stingy, I had to ask for extra salsa. Our server was efficient, and friendly enough I guess. We did enjoy the free chips and salsa. I don't know if the Tex mex food is that much better than anywhere else I've eaten, but my kids really like the Mac n cheese bites.  My overall impression is that it's not somewhere I would be rushing back to."}
{"text":"Atrocious customer service!!!! Went there on a Wednesday night only to sit there for approximately 40 minutes without having my order taken.Was told they would get around to me and my husband but we sat there patience draining as the server chatted away with a larger group.This is my 2nd lone star experience with horrible customer service.My first visit was bad :wrong food,lacked requested items and overall crappy service but atleast i enjoyed my meal when it eventually came.This time however I was not given the chance to critique the food as we sat there ignored.If you believe in God then pray before you enter.Let me help you:
Dear God, 
I hope that as i enter the doors of lone star that you bless the servers working today.I pray for them to acknowledge my presence,take my order and actually bring the food requested.I pray for my time on earth to be spent enjoying life and not in wondering why i wasted my time gas and effort to eat at this place.I pray.Amen.
If that doesnt work nothing will."}
{"text":"Well I returned! Very very lovely service from the wait staff to the manager. The food was good as well. I did not get the tacos. However this place is the nicest most welcoming place I've visited so far in Canada."}
{"text":"Lovely reno in 2011. The bar is now cozy amd the patio more inviting.  

The salsa improved - good flavour (less stewed tomatoes taste), the gratis tortilla chips were warm and tasty. The large margarita hasn't got much alcohol in it, but the flavour is consistent with other locations. 

Tip: if you order the steak fajitas, order them one level less-cooked than you normally prefer it. The steak still cooks while it's at your table and you end up with perfectly-cooked steak."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this Lone Star for a while. The menu has gone through quite a few changes which is good as it allows you to try new things. I always get fajitas and they're delicious! Our server was not very good. He did not listen well and would tell us he was going to do something and then either forget or do it very slowly. The food was very good though."}
{"text":"Being American and having been to Texas, this is decent Tex Mex, for Canada ;-) But sitting outside on a beautiful night was nice. And all the servers were really nice! Food came crazy slow, but she kept us stocked on chips and drinks. The buffalo fajitas were the best thing I had."}
{"text":"I love Tex-Mex!  

The fajitas are my go to food here.  You can see the little tortilla press working away, which are nice and fresh - surprising for a chain.  They offer you more tortillas and toppings if you need em, which I find you often do with those tiny little topping trays they give you! 

The last time I came, my boyfriend and I split the fajitas platter.  It had chicken, steak and shrimp fajitas - all very tasty.  But then it also came with some ribs.  Save yourself, and do not order the ribs here.  They were disgusting and tasted like chewed up street meat!  No joke.  

The prices are pretty good, especially for the quality of food."}
{"text":"Definitely not one of my top places to eat in the area. The service was average, but the quality of food was not. For the price you pay, you get little quantity, especially for being a Texas Style restaurant. I order chicken quesadillas, which is hard to go wrong with, but they managed to do so anyways. Very little chicken throughout the whole thing. It tasted very bland. The salsa was mediocre. The queso was not something I'd ever recommend. It tasted like a cheese-whiz and tomato soup. Again, not Texas style. Maybe I had high hopes walking in the place, but for the prices they have, it's not worth it in my opinion."}
{"text":"Lonestar, what have you done to me? You have broken my heart :(

I was fairly impressed when I came into the restaurant to see the recent renovations, it looks much better. Has more of a relaxed atmosphere. Better use of space especially since they never used the back room anyway.. It was nice to be seated in that part of the restaurant last night.

However, it all seems wonderful and great but to start off with, our sever disappeared after taking our order... Never to be seen again, turns out she went on break and never got anyone else to take over the table for her.. So service went down the drain until we had to get the manager who made sure for the rest of the night we had someone to take care of us.

Now for the very very depressing, upsetting disappointing ruining my life part.. THEY CHANGED THE CHICKEN CHIMICHANGAS!!!! 

Okay, that felt good to scream a little. They are now using the same chicken as the fajitas, and it has that burnt taste, as it is cooked on the grill. Not the taste you want to be in your chimichanga that's for sure. Before the chimi was made with boiled chicken, and it worked perfectly. The chicken is also alot thicker, as they just cut it up and throw it in.. I can only hope that by some miracle they change it back otherwise I now have to find somewhere else who makes a Chicken Chimichanga. I lost Mexi-Cali Rosa's and now it seems Lonestar too :("}
{"text":"Somehow this has become my go-to Lone Star location. Service here is quick and friendly! The only thing I wish is that they didn't bring the chips and salsa as soon as you are seated because I can eat baskets as they are pretty addictive especially when the chips are hot and the salsa is chunky! 

They have a couple specials which seem to bring me back regularly, Tuesday is $12.99 chimichanga night for me and Wednesday is a large sized ribs for the price of a regular portion!

The 3 amigo margaritas for $9.99 are a tasty treat! You get to pick three different flavors, there is five to choose from! 

The food here is your average Tex-Mex options. Alot of birthdays seem to happen here everytime I come, also there does seem to be alot of kids that attract here for their birthdays. Probably because they get to wear the big funny looking hat!"}
{"text":"Everybody love the food that we got but the portions are relatively small for 4 people even though you get unlimited wraps. Also, the waitress was very friendly and accommodated everything we asked for but the service was kind of slow :("}
{"text":"Horrible restaurant. It took the waiter 20 minutes to come introduce herself and bring us water/drinks etc. After being seated. Food is below average quality, overpriced mediocre food. Just go eat at Oceans across the parking lot."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and both times the experience was...average.
Everything about the place is average - the food, the service,the decor...whatever else.Well, maybe not the decor- it's the chalkboard drawing everywhere - like Jackass' which I LOVE. So I may be biased.

 I'm not saying anything was bad - in fact, when we arrived, the waiter brought us a bowl full of greasy salty nachos as an appetizer - that we didn't know we wanted until we ate it. The meat fell of the bone and was juice as can be; the wings were just spicy enough and the portions were prefect. I love the cowboy out all the staff wore - I would have totally asked to work there if I didn't already have a fantastic job I like - it really DOES bring out the best in you...from bottoms up:)

However, the rid & wing combo (which came with a side + coleslaw) was $22.99 = not cheap. ME = moderately cheap when it comes to food. If this plate was $18.99 I think I would be in agreement. There is something that is missing here - that just won't let me agree with the price or a 4 star rating.....

it is a good spot to go to if you run options of restaurants along Front street- otherwise it never dawns on me to go here - but great spot!!!!"}
{"text":"Love coming here after landing at the airport.  Try their Fajita Fiesta.  It comes with steak, chicken, shrimp, and baby back ribs.  Ribs fall off the bone.  They are the best when it comes to fajitas. This location is just down the street from the airport so if you are hungry you should come here.  It closes at midnight so plenty of time to eat before heading off."}
{"text":"Walked in at 9:25pm on a Sunday night, asked what time they were open till. Was told 10pm. So I asked if the kitchen was still up and running (like closed the doors at 10 or the kitchen at 10) was looked at by the 3 staff standing there with puzzled faces. . . . \"Ummm we're not sure???\" Seriously? Take your money where they appreciate you business."}
{"text":"I can't decide whether the Tex or the Mex is better here.  And to be honest, it really doesn't matter.  This place is pretty much like most other Lone Stars that you'll visit, except without much of a cozy feel about it.  It seems like they tried to do \"Texas\" and \"Sports Bar\" and didn't do either particularly well.  Yes, there's no sombreros on deer heads, but there's nothing that makes this place stand out from its supposed Rio Grande roots either.  You could easily be sitting at the bar watching a game and the only thing that would make the experience novel is that there's a Dox Equis in front of you.

The staff is friendly.  Almost too friendly.  Like \"Office Space\" friendly where you become distracted trying to find the 15 pieces of flare.  The menu stands up like most other Tex-Mex places and is franchise friendly.  That said, the freshly made nacho chips that come out as soon as you get to the table are truly fantastic.  If Lone Star get one thing right, it is this."}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner here our last night in Toronto. We were over all the fancy food and just wanted something simple  We sat in the rear of the dining room, which was nice and quiet. We were seated quickly and got our appetizer even quicker. (queso=awesome!) Our waitress was amazing! She even got my husband a pitcher of soda because he was so thirsty. Big thumbs up! We had the fajitas and ribs for two. The tortillas were amazing and the meats were great! If they had a LoneStar anywhere near our home we would definitely return!! If you're looking for a simple easy place to bring your family or have a drink, I suggest LoneStar!"}
{"text":"Ok so this Texas girl had to see what is really happening in this place. The bar (expectation) was set really high. Could they impress or satisfy a true Texan in Toronto? My answer is yes, yes they did. 

It's kind of cute to walk into a place in Canada to see everyone dressed up like they just stepped off a ranch in Montana (yes there's a difference). It's almost like Hooters - Texas style. Not as raunchy (boobs in your face -although there's nothing wrong with that either.). 

The waitress explained  how the restaurant came to be. Two Texans playing in the CFL wanted Texas food close. Yay! It's a shame there aren't guys like this to provide the same love of Texas food in Seattle but that is for another review. 

I decided to order their famous Fajitas. They were served on a sizzling platter with peppers and onions. They smelled so good and tasted even better.  The tortillas were awesome and made fresh on site in their tortilla factory. 

I will say the beans were strange (one of the reasons for 4 stars). I cannot even explain the taste. It was odd. I couldn't expect absolute Texas perfection. 

I will probably visit them again. They are located directly across the street from the hotel where I normally stay. Next time it'll be fajitas and margaritas. 

A little taste of home 1600 miles away."}
{"text":"came for this fish taco... it did not dissapoint :)

came in on a Wednesday afternoon. was seated by the bar.. food was warm. i enjoyed it. service was good too."}
{"text":"The first few times visiting, I would have given a solid 4 stars. However the most recent visit was not so good. We showed up for a late dinner and could tell that the rice and beans had been sitting."}
{"text":"Perhaps it was the cold beer or the excellent service from Arizona, or the fajitas, which came out sizzling, but I really liked this place.

Here are a few pointers that may help you here...

1. The location means that business will be driven by events, such as Jays games. At these times the place can be slammed and service won't be quite as good.
2. The beers are cold, but they don't have much selection of local craft beers on draught.
3. The nachos and fajitas are among the better choices. The chicken for the fajitas is tender and juicy.
4. Prices are a bit high for Tex Mex. Expect to leave full, but with your wallet a bit too empty!"}
{"text":"Food was pretty good. I had the Cabo Tacos which were spicy and tasty. Our server was friendly.  The only real issue was that we had to ask three separate servers for silverware AFTER we got our food."}
{"text":"Consistently good food and good service. Love the Carne Salado which is their version of lettuce wrap. Looove their margaritas."}
{"text":"Do not come here.  It took over one hour to get the meal and appetizers,. That is why they give chips to nush on, but the salsa sauce is bland and lacks taste.  To make up, the manager offered only 25% off and for us a desert."}
{"text":"#TORONTO #DOWNTOWN #TEXMEX #YELP

Holy Portions! Lone Star Texas Grill really packs it on the plate. I ordered a Fajita Enchilada after seeing the picture Amna S. posted and boy, it didn't disappoint. My boyfriend ordered a Medium-rare steak, cooked to perfection and spiced to satisfy. Tortilla chips and salsa on the house as starters - perfect!

The restaurant has a bar area and a dining area like most of its kind. It was lively - a mixed crowd of professionals and casual ongoers. 

The servers are cute and efficient, dressed in jeans and plaid cowboy shirts. 

I highly recommend this place to Convention goers who are looking for a low-key place for a quick lunch (not Baton Rouge or Canyon Creek). There's also a food-court in the same building, but I'd skip the food court and go to Lone Star instead."}
{"text":"I came here expecting the food to be pretty great from the reviews but I found it a little bland. Inside is nice, staff is nice but food is nothing special so I probably will not return."}
{"text":"Been going to Lone Star restaurants for many years and always for the fajitas which have been second to none

Last two visit to Lone Star were not the greatest. Ordered steak fajitas which is my go to dish at Lone Star and was very disappointed with the food quality and the portion size. The steak arrived it it was not medium rare but blue. Basically in cooked meat with grill marks on the outside. Staff explained that steak fajitas are all done medium rare which I understand but did not expect blue. They took the order back and did something with it like microwaved it and the same plate was delivered back. Steak was like rubber 


This lunch for 1 was $30.00 and wasn't edible. 
Didn't finish the meal, they gave me the bill and the staff wasn't too concerned over my experience. Talked to the manager who was less than impressive. I paid the bill and left 

I hope my bad experiences are simply isolated events. Lone Star typically has very good food for reasonable price but two meals later and paying almost $70 combined I'm not too keen on paying for meals that I can't eat

I think it is time for a break from Lone Star"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on the weekend, the place was busy!! I think they recently renovated this place and the inside looks pretty nice. I was surprised how big it was inside and there was also a 2nd level. We asked for nachos to start (it's free). Ordered the coconut shrimp and steak & chicken fajitas combo. Both were good but I prefer the steak more than the chicken. They bring out on a sizzling hot plate and you can make your own. Was so full after the meal! If you are craving for fajitas, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Food: 3.5/5
Service: 5/5
Location 3/5
 
I came here for lunch with a friend today. I've passed by many times having worked for 4 years in the entertainment/financial district, but decided to take a chance today. The hostesses and servers were very friendly and attentive, checking in several times to make sure everything was going well. The food itself is typical \"bar and grill\" fare but with a tex mex twist. There isn't a separate menu with lunch specials but the price point is average at around $15-20 for a meal. Once you get there they bring out a bowl of complementary tortilla chips and salsa, which I loved! The chips were still hot and the salsa was very fresh (no Tostito dip vibe at all). I got a Cabo soft taco with a Caesar salad and my friend got a grilled chicken sandwich. The soft taco came filled to the brim with chicken and bacon, with fresh avocado on top (which I thought was a very premium touch). It was seasoned just right, had a nice sprinkle of cheese, and the hot sauce on top have it a nice kick. The food arrived quickly and we wrapped up our entire meal easily within an hour.
 
Great food and service for the price! It's a very convenient lunch location if you only have an hour lunch break and you work near the entertainment district. Not very busy so you won't need to worry about waiting for a spot."}
{"text":"Where do we start about this horrible experience. It was a slow night at this restaurant. My wife and I were seated promptly. The hostess asked us twice if we'd been there before and then decides to tell us about the deal they had that day, \"4 people could eat for $45\" HELLO, there were only two of us! All very robotic! Our waiter \"Maverick\" (This had to be joke) but no, the joke was on us. We ordered two drinks AND 2 glasses of water. The drinks were slow coming and when they did NO water. Not a big deal, we simply asked for water again. We ordered Chicken Fajitas and a Rib Chicken wing combo. We ordered a second round of drink and water , again no water came with our second drinks. Still not making big deal out of this Maverick guy not remembering water. when the food came out there were a few issues. The fajitas were every light on everything, how much could filling the sizzling plate up with pepper and onions be? The chicken was tasty but still not very much for $17.95! The dish was supposed to come with rice but Mav said some BS about the rice wasn't ready and he didn't want to make us wait, we ordered water again.! The dish came with beans, something I usually like, they were COLD. The rice followed second later, still not water, and the rice was cold also. How is this even possible if they made a fresh batch or rice? Our other dish, the ribs and wings were also cold and not very good at all. The wing tasted like frozen wings with some sauce thrown on them. The kicker was the price of the dish was $24.95. We did get water with the guacamole that Mav forgot.

The only redeeming quality was that they took the ribs and wings off of our bill. It was a nice gesture but didn't makeup for all the miss steps and the is NO excuse for cold food!

STAY AWAY! I would have gone with a one star review but the fajitas were tasty. One more thing, what kind of bar only has one type of gin? If it were a bottom shelf gin it would have been okay with it but it was Bombay. One of my pet peaves are weak drinks. I would rather pay more for a strong drink than drink tonic water with a lime."}
{"text":"Really like this place. Dining experience is consistent. My kid loves the fact that chips are delivered to the table right away!

Had them cater a birthday party, which went really well. Great way to avoid some hassle, a fun alternative to pizza or hot dogs.

Only one sub-par experience, which was on Fathers' Day. Happily waited 20 minutes for a table, only to be told we couldn't have a high chair at that particular table. Told it'd be another 15 minutes for a suitable table. Huh? Would've thought it would be obvious we'd need a high chair, having had our 1-year-old in our arms. Chalk it up to a busy day, and maybe an inexperienced staff."}
{"text":"Hmm..kinda on the fence on this one...I really want to like Lone Star because I am lover of Tex Mex cuisine, but since my last visit it seems the quality of certain menu items has either degraded in quality or has gotten smaller in portion size.  One of the redeeming things that Lone Star is doing right is the fresh in house tortilla chips with salsa.  These are complementary to the table and are very addictive.  
 On this visit I ordered the fish tacos.  This entree came with a side of dirty rice (being an avid rice eater) it was very sub par and the temperature was quite cool.  The fish tacos were tasty, but very short lived (3 tacos instead of 2 would have been a perfect size).  The other food at the table were receiving the same comments for the sides as my order.  There was a big difference in food portions on two of the same meals that it looked like someone got chipped off.  Our server was great and the quality of the service was right on target. Its unfortunate the inconsistent food quality  and portions sizes  really brought the score down."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times over the years & I've never been blown away. I find everything I've had very generic. The atmosphere is very family oriented, it's not bad it's just not my cup of tea. The serving staff is always chatting to each other. I don't mind it that much but it's not as inviting as I would like. It's not a bad place but it's nothing special either."}
{"text":"Drinks were cheap and came with warm crispy chips and fresh salsa. Very good would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Poor service, long wait times and mediocre food.  We said we'd never come back after the last lousy experience, but gave it one more try tonight.  45mins waiting for our food so far.  Water glasses empty and the place is packed.  Under staffed and overrated.  Spend your hard earned money elsewhere"}
{"text":"Can I put 0 stars?

The service and food at this place are ULTRA sad. ULTRA!

Do not let curiosity get to you. Go to McDonald's, anywhere but here.

This place doesn't even deserve a negative review."}
{"text":"Was really in the mood for Tex-mex so headed to lone star.  Not all would go to downtown location which is usually quite good.

Service here was very friendly and right amount of attentive.

Fajitas - shells were nice but seasoning on beef was just okay.  Meat was sliced just off the bias so not as tender as it could have been.

Overall was okay but not great.  Go back?  Probably but it will be a while.  Service was very good."}
{"text":"2.5 Stars. 

Not all restaurants of a chain are made or managed equal. Lone Star Texas Grill is no exception. 

I want to say this restaurant is sticking to it's southern decor so the fact that it's dim and some spots on the table are sticky can be overlooked. I wasn't expecting a steakhouse atmosphere. But rusted air vents with dust bunnies inside? Yeah that really doesn't belong. 

Asides from decor, service was attentive and quick and friendly.

Complimentary chips and salsa is awesome. And the chips come warm in a basket. Awesome! And it's refillable too. 

The steak here is really their strength. All their cuts are tender and delicious. They're really well seasoned and cooked perfectly. It comes served with one huge piece of brocolli and one huge piece of carrot. (both really bland) And a side of your choice. The sides are not worth mentioning. Subpar. 

Calamari here is tasty. Fajitas area one of their strengths too and come loaded with stuff. Big portion size. 

I did recently pass by their downtown location. It looked sleek and new from the outside and the place was packed. Maybe I'll check out this location next time. This review is really mixed because while I love their steak and chips and salsa, I do not like anything else here.

Just go to the downtown location."}
{"text":"It's one of a chain. This one is generally clean, decent service and decent food.

Tonight we had chicken fajitas for two and a kid's quesadilla. The kid's meal is reasonably priced and still enough food for my kid. They now charge for chips and salsa, but only $1. 

The tortilla shells were on the gummy side tonight, not great, but I based my rating on having been here many times as they are good with allergies and my kid likes it a lot."}
{"text":"I find Lone Star to be a very good restaurant.  

It is very clean, and there is a strong focus on presenting a family atmosphere.

I am a regular here, and the Staff are very good at making sure that the food is served hot.

I find that there is a good variety of food for me to eat.  I have to eat gluten free because of health conditions and it is great to have a restaurant that serves TexMex gluten free.  Just remember to tell them that you want corn torts or lettuce torts if you have food issues like me.

I am a big fan of the ribs.  They are a good sized portion with lots of sides.

Tonight I am having the steak fajitas on lettuce torts.  With a nice big side of guacamole!  The meat is well seasoned, and I know that they have me covered.  ;)

It can get loud and busy, so we typically find times to go when it is not overflowing with people.  If you don't like a lot of noise, it's better to come earlier before the dinner rush.  They are always packed on the Sunday of the long weekends as well too.

We love their food. We've been doing a lot of takeout lately, with my wife picking up dinner, or my checkins would have tripled by now"}
{"text":"Yes this is the best place to eat in Oakville!! There are some days the food may not be amazing, but if you tell your server they will be happy to make you new food!  We visit Oakville 6 days a week and we eat here at least twice a week!! The food is fresh and hot and cooked to perfection. 
I recommend asking for Rebel, Arizona or dolly!! Majority of the servers are amazing and on top of their game, but these are our favs!! They will not disappoint. They are under new management I think now... I know they have a new guy there running the place!! Well he's awesome if you have any issues just ask for the Bucket or management.  Don't leave if you're unhappy. 

I'd for sure give more than 5 stars if possible lol"}
{"text":"Decent place, great selections of ice cold beer.  Complimentary nacho chips and dip were excellent.  Service was very good."}
{"text":"This restaurant epitomizes why I don't eat at chain restaurants. The food is definitely NOT fresh. Has a plasticy taste to it starting with the salad dressing to the steak. Dressing tastes like it came out of a plastic container and was mass produced. I could taste the fuel used to cook my steak. Over salted and over seasoned wedge fries come with your steak to induce you to buy over priced booze. Horrible experience, won't come again. If you want a real steak for half the price, go next door to the Airport Cafe. I didn't go there because they were closed for the holidays, like many family operated restaurants are. I feel like chain restaurants are always calculating what corners they can cut and figure out what they can get away with to maximize their profit."}
{"text":"If I could write this review with no stars I would. ....The wait staff was kind but the restaurant really needs a better quality of food. Very processed, low budget. Burgers definitely had a filler of some sort in them.We asked for medium and got well done.That is because the filler will not cook medium. The meat also had such a strong flavor of garlic and spices it was nauseating . We waited so long for just burgers and soup fries. Which took us one hour and a half with just one other table to be served. I say for price I would much rather eat at Burger King!!! Must be the alcohol that keeps them open."}
{"text":"This is the second Lone House I've been to.

It's OK. It's one of those places that Lee's siblings and family like to go to for large group gatherings, the food is pretty OK and pleasing for the average person. It's Canadian Tex-Mex, which is a little bit different than US Tex-Mex in ways that I can't completely put my finger on. The food is pretty average, nothing spectacular, but nothing terrible.

I would give this place two stars because they recently started charging for chips and salsa, which I find a little bit ridiculous. On the other hand, the server totally busted her hump, enough for me to give 4 stars, so those two things cancel each other out."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I'm a native to California, so I have much pickier ideas about Tex Mex and Mexican food than the average person.

The food here was fairly average at best, with an interesting flavor profile to me - much more hints of cooked tomato flavor than I'm used to encountering in Tex Mex food. Drinks were good, but it was the service that propelled it from \"meh\" to \"pretty decent.\"

I don't know if it was just the luck of the draw or if this place has unusually nice waitstaff, but our server was bubbly and adorable, and it really took what was a fairly awkward dinner and made it enjoyable."}
{"text":"Pretty bad service and mediocre food. We were a group of 5 celebrating a birthday on a Saturday night. The restaurant was understandably busy but the service  we received was awful. The food itself was okkkk, we orderex the nachoes and salsa which they now charge for, which is ultimately ok because the proceeds were going to a local food bank, but the chips we received were all crumbs so we asked for another which took a pretty long time to arrive.  Lastly the food that we received after waiting about 40min more was only warm and not hot. But the drinks are good. So overall not a great experience. I highly doubt we will be coming back."}
{"text":"Ok, first off, the reason this place gets a 4 star rating is because they MAKE THEIR OWN TORTILLAS!!!  That being said, normally I would have given 3 stars.  The place is typical \"we're tex-mex\"  decor.  The waitstaff is friendly and have code names like \"Dallas and Cayote\"...totally NOT their real names.  The tortillas are really good and the prices are fair.  The only complaint I have as an actual Texas boy from Houston is that The meat portions on the fajitas are not Texas sized.  almost more grilled veggies than meat:(  But all and all a good attempt at recreating the Tex-mex feel and taste.  The bottled hot sauce they use is actually made in Texas, which adds a little more authenticity."}
{"text":"Usually has OK service.  The food is OK.....but the real reason to go here is the fresh tortillas.  The portions are decent and the pricing is pretty much in line with what you get.  The place tends to be darker and not as clean as most other Lone Star Texas Grills I have been to, but the location is conveniently located near my office."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch and got a table right away. The staff were friendly enough but slow as molasses. We put in our order and waited over 30 minutes for our lunch specials. Not a server to be seen. Hubby had to get up from our table and go find out what on earth could be taking so long. Food wasn't that great this time around. The fish in the fish taco was the size of a baby's finger and the beans that came with it were not cooked enough. The chicken bowl was good. The shrimp salad was way underdressed and the shrimp were cold. Horrible enough experience not to go back anytime soon. Oh ya they started charging a dollar for the chips and salsa that used to be free."}
{"text":"I was walking around hungary one night and I was tired of boring ol' McDonald's so I thought to myself to try out Lone Star for the first time. As a entered the restaurant I was greeted right away. The waitresses had on Texas style attire and cowboy hats on. I felt like was in San Antonio for a split second. It was pretty cool! I asked for a take out menu and I ordered the Mesquite burger with cheezy fries. The waitress so professional and polite. I waited 10 mins before my order came and I eft. Had my meal back at work and I was blown away. The burger was so big and full of flavour. I was a bit upset about the potion size of the cheezy fries because it was so delicious. I will be going back there again despite how expensive it is."}
{"text":"I saw this place out my hotel window.  I'm from Texas (lived there 37 years and counting).  Figured why not?  In the spirit of giving credit where it is due but also giving constructive criticism:
Ambiance - nailed it.  With the country music blaring I felt at home.  The only exception was the abundance of hockey on the TVs in the bar but I can forgive that.  This is Canada after all.
Chips - not bad.  I've had better but these would be standard fare in Houston. 
Salsa - just ok.  This could be better. 
Margarita - I ordered the Cadillac frozen.  That is a standard margarita with a shot of Grand Marnier.  This didn't taste quite right as I started, but got a little better as I went.  Still below average.  This place could really use a margarita machine and a better margarita recipe.  
Meal - I had the Pork Carnitas Quesadillas.  These were pretty good.  Better than I expected to be honest.  
Overall - not bad.  I'd go again if I was in the area."}
{"text":"A typical family restaurant with Tex-Mex options. Great for kids and the complimentary chips are delicious."}
{"text":"Wow! 33 bucks for a hunk of burned fat with a garlic grease baste.
I should've walked out when the nasty attitude hostess refused to answer me when I asked for a booth, also the place was empty as a tomb at 7 pm.
Simply do not eat here you will regret it."}
{"text":"Slow. Slow. Slow.  I Had reservations for a large group(12). I was expecting to have to wait for food. However, the restaurant is mostly empty. The service is absolutely terrible. I'm working on my third refill and third bowl of chips"}
{"text":"This spot used to be my go-to fajita, margarita-cravin' joint in the suburban RH jungle. Feelin' nostaglic on my birthday this year, my mom and I decided to head there for dinner. I even fought tooth and nail against \"wouldn't you rather go to...\" recommendations. It was happening.

We arrived to a 30 minute wait, and on a long weekend, our mistake, not theirs. We sat in the lounge and were promised a table when one opened up. 45 minutes later and no wait staff in sight, we moved to a now open and empty section of booths and flagged down the bartender to alert a server.

The rest of the dinner was night-marish - the fajitas, when they eventually arrived, were the wrong order and only half of the meat and veggies showed up while the other half was still cooking in the back. The \"fixins\" were miniscule at best - when did the portions shrink down to the approximately size of the legal mice type on the menu? The lettuce and tomatoes were enough to make one fajita, and when I requested more, they never came. My subsequent fajitas consisted of meat and hot sauce alone.

The topper on my birthday cake? My mother, bless her, asked the waitress if I could have a dessert for my birthday. The waitresses response?  \"We don't do birthdays\". My response? I don't do bad service and poor food. Goodbye, old friend."}
{"text":"Went here to have supper and was not disappointed. I had a peppercorn sirloin steak with baked potato.   Steak was cooked to perfection, ( Med rare).   Will definitely eat here again   Servers were friendly and well informed and actually seemed to be enjoying work tonight. Desert was their apple crisp which came on a sizzling plate,  my wife said that it was worth coming for without the main course."}
{"text":"I give this place for stars for a chain restaurant! They serve you hot tortilla chips which not a lot of places do. Overall yummy- Love the calamari and portions are huge! Both of us wish we had stopped at appetizers because we could not touch our mains.
I highly recommend the margaritas.. Obviously a must try at any Mexican (or Texmex) place but they particularly stand out here. Lots of different flavors but I loved the one with blue Curacao because it had lots of salt.. More than the mango or original, not sure if that was just a fluke. Will be returning, and I don't speak so highly of many chain places."}
{"text":"I had supper tonight at Lone Star Texas Grill.

\"Rangler\" was my server and she started me off with some warm tortilla chips and salsa.  Yum!

I ordered Southern-Fried Chicken Fingers with medium sauce.  They were good.  They were tender and the sauce had a nice bite.  Because of the free tortilla chips, I didn't need to order fries.

Rangler was great.  I had had a busy day talking retirement with people from 9:30am to 7:30pm.  She was very friendly and silly ... just want I needed after a hard tiring day.  Thanks, Rangler!"}
{"text":"A colleague and I had a client meeting in Oakville this morning.  Afterwards we had lunch at the Lone Star Texas Grill, not far from the client's site.

Our server, Nevada (her Lone Star name), took great care of us. She was fun, friendly and helpful.  She brought us some chips and salsa to munch on as we looked over the menu.

We both ordered \"Big Rig\" Tijuana Burrito (a 12-inch flour tortilla filled with Mexi-beef, Mexican rice, refried beans and Con Queso. Topped with their own Ranchero sauce and Jack & Cheddar cheese, served with guacamole, sour cream and Pico de Gallo).  I ate some rice but concentrated on the burrito.  It was delicious but it defeated me and I left some.

I'd go back the next time I'm in Oakville and am hungry."}
{"text":"I go to the Lone Star quite often.  It has a wide menu so there is something for everything.  It doesn't have the character of a small italian restaurant on college, but the food and service are great and the price is reasonable."}
{"text":"I'm normally not a fan of chain restaurants because it's often a case of charging for the popular name instead of any quality in the food. However, this place is really great. Only been once, but they had the best fajitas I have ever had and the ribs were also decent. They also give you unlimited toppings and shells, and the shells are freshly made in-house. They are so incredible!  I could just eat those! The complimentary nachos and salsa they give at the beginning of the meal are also really tasty. The restaurant is also massive, so you can eat right away which is always a bonus in Toronto. The bar was a fun place to sit as it had a good atmosphere and comfortable booths. It's a bit on the pricey side, but overall it was delicious!"}
{"text":"For a corny chain restaurant, I was super impressed with my first visit to this location! We came for a friend's 25th birthday. 8 of us had drinks around the bar and then we moved to our reserved table in the middle of the restaurant. 

The birthday man did the 72 oz. steak challenge. The staff did a great job of making a cheesy big deal out of it and checking in on him while he was going at it. They were a lot of fun and accommodating --bringing him a new knife when his became too dull from sawing at the absurd amount of beef they encourage people to eat. They also brought him ice cream for his birthday, which he shared with the table to save room for beer post-ginormous steak (and two sides!).

I had shrimp fajitas which were loads of food; I only ate about half of it and my fiancé finished it off. I may have also been a bit full from the ridiculous quantity of tortilla chips and salsa that were replenished quickly by the staff while we waited for our food.

The servers were great at their jobs: casual enough but also on top of our needs while we had dinner. The food was perfect -nothing ground-breaking, but yummy, fresh comfort tex-mex. A perfect place for a big group, especially if you are feeling low on protein and want a free t-shirt --the 72 oz. steak is free if you eat the whole thing in under an hour!"}
{"text":"The fajitas are amazing. It's all I've had here though. The friends I went with had really good things to say about the coffee as well. The guacamole is really good!"}
{"text":"100x better than the last visit.  HalfPint is the bomb!  She gives amazing customer service and goes above and beyond any expectations!!  Our server Carter was top notch and provided everything we could ask for!  Great experience."}
{"text":"I don't know about their other food cuz I don't eat meat, but their fajitas are great! I always get the veggie when I go. I also like the freshly made tortilla chips with handmade fresh salsa too. Very refreshing."}
{"text":"Food 3/5, Server (Utah) 5/5, Hostess 1/5. We were driving up Yonge for fun and randomly looking for a new restaurant to try & came upon Lone Star.

Upon entering, the young hostess w/ long dyed reddish hair had a very cold demeanor. We were seated in the middle somewhere. However, we had wanted a booth (there were only 3 of us). This was close to 8pm in the evening on a Sunday & there were many empty booths (at least 8 +). However when we enquired for the booth, the hostess said they were reserved (really now?) & that the booths are for more ppl. One hour later, it was clear no one was coming. Also another party of 3 came in shortly after us & got a booth (seated by the same hostess)! Wtf? When asked about it again, she said nothing. Another guy came to her defence but his explanation made no sense. Excuses. Gotta love it. 

The best thing about Lone Star were the FREE salsa & nachos. Had two of those!

I ordered the ...

Cabo Tacos - Mesquite-grilled chicken with bacon, Jack cheese, fresh avocado, topped with crispy corn tortillas straws and brushed with our house-made Tomatillo & Poblano pepper sauce. 
 
It came w/ two tacos & I was so stuffed. The food was alright and the portions were generous. Our server Utah was excellent. However, the hostess's attitude really did it for us. We are not coming back again."}
{"text":"Amazing! 

The food is delicious, just amazing. I recommend the fajitas! 5/5 stars!

The service is very good. The new manager isn't personable, but oh well. The waitresses (and waiters) are very nice and they will accommodate you. Very good service, 4.5/5 stars.

It does get busy, so get ready to wait for a table during prime dinner hours.

The bathrooms kind of suck, they are very small, not enough room to wipe if you ask me.
The wifi they have does not work, you have to sign in, and the sign in never works. 

Anyway, amazing amazing amazing restaurant! Love it there, it is my favourite restaurant!"}
{"text":"Warning: Bathrooms are not accessible in this restaurant. They also do not have a change table for little ones.

The food here is usually very good, although I know to order chicken mostly. I usually have had a good experience but the latest one with a baby was very disappointing. 

We went in for their new 3 course special. They were very busy on Sunday with parties and we had to wait. Most people that walked in afterwards had to wait much longer. 

Now the last time we came in with a stroller and were seated at a booth with the stroller at the end. This time we came with no stroller and were seated at a booth so I asked for a high chair and am told they do not allow high chairs at the end of booths even though there was plenty of room for it at the back of the restaurant. I ask if there is any other tables and they say no and that if I want that I have to wait even longer then the 20 minutes I was already waiting. So we say fine we will try the booster. 

Unfortunately, this booster has no seatbelt which is a total safety issue. So because we had already invested time waiting and were hungry and had no other option, we had to hold our 10 month old baby throughout dinner to keep him from falling out or climbing onto the table, which he tried to do many times. 

Last time we had a great waitress and I can always tell when a waitress is a mom because they don't put hot plates or cutlery infront of a little boy but this time was not the case. I was also disappointed in the kids menu. I get to have grilled chicken fajitas but for kids they only offer breaded chicken fingers? At least they did have seasonal veggies on kids menu which were very good. 

My other big issue with my meal was that it took so long to be brought the second course which is a salad, I asked my waitress where it was, and then about 10 minutes later received the salad at the same time as the main course. I had to ask her the same things multiple times because she kept forgetting. The only reason she got 15% tip was because of the mess we left behind. 

To recap: Very disappointing service. Fajitas are always excellent. Stupid no high chair rule with booths. And unsafe booster seats."}
{"text":"friends and i were lured in with their happy hour specials. we saw that there were drinks and assumed there were HH food specials too. oops.. we were wrong!

they have $5 margaritas and so i had a strawberry margarita on the rocks. it was tasty but not very strong. 

i shared a chicken quesadilla with one of my friends. it was just mehh. it was nothing spectacular. 

the best thing was the free chips and salsa. lol

service was good but then after a while we couldn't get our server to get the bill. our plates had been cleared for long time before we could get anyones attention to get the bill."}
{"text":"Perfect place if you have teens with appetites to feed!  Just make sure they come hungry. I took 1/2 of what I ordered home and it was good the second day!  It was fun will do it again for dinner soon"}
{"text":"Incredible service.  Best food ever.  In the past 2 months, I've been here 9 times.  I can't get enough.  The salsa is great here, and the new lone star layout is great."}
{"text":"We've been coming here once in a while for years. The last time we came they were closed for renovations, which were needed. 

The service was friendly and had refills coming without asking, the chips and salsa are a nice touch, especially when you have to wait as long as we did for our food.

One person in our party ordered steak, and the rest of us had burgers. It seemed as though they put everything on the grill at the same time; the burgers were all over cooked and dry. It took a long time for the food to arrive; I noticed people had come in and ordered after us got their food before us. The server even came by an apologized and offered up more chips and salsa. By the time the food came we weren't so hungry, but choked down the burnt burgers and went on our way. 

Previous visits hadn't been as bad, but there are better option around."}
{"text":"Fajitas are great here, chips & salsa very good too. Burgers not the best. Friendly, attentive servers. Overall, I would come back, but would only order the fajita's!"}
{"text":"We came here after being ignored for 45 minutes at The Pint Public House.  Hostess tells us they are closing in 10 minutes.  We umm and aww cause we don't want to put them out.  She says HEY LETS DO ROCK PAPER SCISSORS TO SEE IF YOU STAY.  We try and she goes JUST GO SIT DOWN.  Seriously the friendliest, sweetest server ever.  The other guy who served us (snakebite) was super friendly as well and didn't rush us at all.

One of the best experiences after one of the worst...food was awesome too!!!"}
{"text":"Went here last week for lunch and ordered the Fajita Enchiladas for myself. The whole dish was amazing, except the rice. They seemed to be a bit overcooked and dry, but that was completely forgivable seeing how good everything else on my plate tasted. The food was filling, delicious, and definitely worth the $16.00 price. 

The food did take some time to arrive, but thankfully the complimentary corn chips and salsa kept me from getting too impatient. The service was also good, but nothing exceptional or out of the ordinary. I'll definitely be returning here and I look forward to trying some more items from their menu. 

My only complaint has to be the the music. Despite the fact that it does go with the whole country-western restaurant theme and atmosphere, I'm totally not looking forward to the loud country music. Yikes."}
{"text":"We came here a few weeks back and ended up getting takeout, not wanting to deal with the super long lines and the wait times. I tried calling twice and the phone just kept ringing and ringing. I handed the phone over to my boyfriend and lo and behold, he got someone on the phone. We ended up getting fajitas for two plus an order of those yummy nachos and salsa. They told us it would be ready in 20 minutes and about 10 minutes later, we left to go pick it up. 

I figured that since it's such a busy restaurant that our takeout would be MORE than that long. But we walked in and our takeout was ready and piping hot. I was really surprised since the entry area was FULL of people waiting but we were able to walk up, pay and head out!

Our food was super tasty and just as good as in the restaurant. Usually we get a second set of fajita wrappers as the meal goes on so I asked for an extra order but it was waaaaay too many. You probably only need to get one order to have enough for two people.

All in, another great experience at this Lone Star!"}
{"text":"This Lone Star is pretty decent and is newly renovated as of May of this year. The  renos are nice, everything is updated and very clean. If you've never been here before, most people go for the free nachos because  they're usually pretty yummy with fresh salsa!

I went here with two of my friends on a Sunday night around 5:30ish for an early dinner and it was already busy enough for a Sunday. It didn't get much busier but it stayed steady throughout the night. You get a nice basket of nachos when your server comes by and they're usually amazing. Ours were a little greasy for our tastes but they were still good and that salsa is great too.

I ordered the chicken sandwich (fried) with french fries and my friends ordered the chicken fingers and una fajita. It didn't take too long for our meal to come out and everything was piping hot and fresh. My sandwich was pretty good, but the bun was an odd choice - it was a flatbread or something and it didn't really add anything to the sandwich. I actually could have done without it. Other than that, the chicken was well breaded and pretty darn good. The fries are pretty basic but they're sprinkled with some yummy seasoning that makes them just better than okay. My friends both enjoyed their meals and had no complaints! 

I've been here many a time and I've tried lots of different things on the menu (yes my choice this time wasn't very \"texan\") and have yet to have a bad experience with food here. Everything is tasty, fresh and always delivered to the table hot. Something to keep in mind for kids is that they have that really cool tortilla machine that is pretty cool. I've seen many a kid spend at least 10 minutes or more watching the tortillas come down the machine (they get flattened and then fire baked, they puff up and then fall back down and so forth) so if you have kids that would be interested, its a good way to get a few minutes to you and your hubs during a dinner out with the kids ;)

My meal was a little on the pricey side, about $14.50 for just my dinner (I had water to drink) but its a pretty neat place to go and depending on what you get, you can get a pretty good sized meal for not too much money. Overall, I'd definitely recommend this place, especially if you've never been to a Lone Star. It's probably one of the beset places to eat in the area right now."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurants a few times out of convenience. Steak and rib dishes were pretty good. The rest of the Tex Mex dishes were not memorable. I usually sit at the bar area and the services were not good.  Margarita was supposed to be their specialty....NOT.  Pouring beer was not their strong point, either. 1/3 of the glass was foam..."}
{"text":"Came here for a PartyNite event.  Got nachos and poutine... both were great!  Service was awesome!
I was disappointed they ran out of calamari though. 
1st time here and I would come again"}
{"text":"Looked closed from the outside. Poor hygiene of server, major b.o. My friends recieved dirty glasses with their pitcher. Drinks were very very sweet, not very good. Sweet potatoe fries really fried, and had been sitting. Not returning."}
{"text":"Although Lone Star is a chain, the food here is pretty decent and they have great crowd-pleaser type foods. They are more known for their Tex-Mex fijitas and do a great job at it.

The King street location is in the basement so it felt a bit dark but they made it work. There is also a patio outside which is great.

I ordered the T-bone steak, which was a Texas taste Tour promotion special. The steak was cooked perfectly and came with sauteed onions, mushrooms and a loaded baked potato - delish!

Service was quick and friendly. Extra points given for having goose island IPA on tap."}
{"text":"Awesome Chicken Fingers, best I've ever had!! Will definitely be back for more. Wait staff quick and friendly, watched the hockey in the bar area. Nice place.
Oh yeah, and you get complimentary chips and salsa with your meal."}
{"text":"Serve dishes sooooooooo slow, few tables at that moment. We wait more than 45 mins after we ordered. Even without a waiter! But chips for free, that's the reason for the second star."}
{"text":"As soon as we got there we kindly greeted and given a choice whether to eat in the dinning room or at the bar. We chose the bar which was comfortable and clean. 

For drinks they have many beers on draught  and lots of cocktails. The beer sizes are good they have a pint to large size. 

The fajitas are famous there. They are ok lots of topping options. I found the vegetables to be a little undercooked and the chicken dry. Although the not great the atmosphere is fun and the servers are friendly.

Not to bad of a restaurant. Would probably go back for The beer and customer service. Kind of disappointed."}
{"text":"If I could give this place zero stars I would! The most disrespectful staff on the planet! Came here with friends waited an hour for our food to come out and there was short dark hair in our food. They offered to remake it. Waited another 20/30 min and again MORE HAIR. Manager came out and tried to imply that it was one of our hairs by saying \"my entire kitchen staff are blondes\" We were nice about but decided to leave at that point. We were waiting for two friends who were in the bathroom one of the chefs WHO WAS NOT A BLOND (neither was anyone else in their kitchen) came out and said \"I'm going to have to ask you to leave\" we explained we were waiting for a friend in the bathroom. He accused us of causing a scene for just waiting then said wait outside when we refused he said well I'll have to wait with you. 2 seconds later says \"YOU SHOULD CHECK ON YOUR FRIENDS  MAYBE THEY FELL INTO THE TOILET\" and then ran and hid behind his managers after completely disregarding us."}
{"text":"The best fajitas around. Fresh tortilla shells make the difference. The staff at this location are wonderful, friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"Great people. Very help full servers they are all ways there to get you what ever you want. I go back time and time again. I not saying the food is not great, but it's the workers that make the Lone Star what it's all about. Friendly and very happy people that want to be there. Plus there Ribs Are just killer awesome. Lots of meat. You will never leave there hungry. If you have not tried the deep fried Ice Cream do it!!! You will not be sorry."}
{"text":"My son loves this restaurant and we have been coming for years. However, over the last couple of years the service is really hit and miss, leaning more towards \"miss\".   

We were last there a couple of weeks ago on a Saturday night.  
We were seated without too long a wait.  The waiter came by fairly quickly  and took our orders without issue.  After a  bit of a lengthy wait, we noticed one of the servers (not our waiter) carrying what appeared to be our meals.  He didn't seem to know where he was going and as he got closer to our table, he turned around and walked away.  SEVERAL minutes later, he returned with our same meals.  We all had ordered fajitas which  (normally)come on a sizzling hot cast iron dish.  When the meals were brought over, not only were they not sizzling, but the actual cast iron dish wasn't that hot.  
Despite this we started eating our meals and were looking for our waiter to get an extra napkin as well as some salsa sauce.   He didn't come anywhere near our table for the longest time. At one point we saw him nearby at 2 other tables he was serving and tried to call out, but he didn't hear and turned and went back the other way without ever having come by our table.   I had to get up and go to the front of the restaurant to ask one of the hostesses to ask someone else to get me a napkin and salsa.  Finally only AFTER we were finished our meal did he come by.  He then acknowledged he hadn't come by for some time, which I wholeheartedly agreed and told him we were trying to get a hold of him the entire meal and he never showed up.  

FYI, my family and I typically eat here at least 5-6 x per year,  probably for almost 10 years now.  Probably just an oversight this time but we've had too many bad service experiences here recently and finally decided, with my son's consent, to stop coming here.  I even found another Mexican restaurant not too far away which has great reviews.  .  

I only gave this review 3 stars based on the previous good experiences I've had over the years.  If it was just based on this experience, it probably would have been a 1 or a 2.

Despite the recent bad service, I do like the food at Lone Star and certainly hope they can work a little harder on better training their wait staff."}
{"text":"They moved to this new location. 

Great eats. We all had the make your own platter and it was great. Really loved the soft shells. Comes in hot!

Staff was very accommodating and the ambiance was nice but a little dark."}
{"text":"I will start by saying I have attended this location many times!!! And never had a problem, but tonight's dining experience was just so terrible it's left a taste in my mouth that will last awhile. 

Was excited to see some new menu options, as I was not in a fajitas mood. I ordered the new fried chicken sandwich. The menu does not mention anything about the jalapeño relish being included on the sandwich, when my sandwich arrived it had the said relish I did not order. I asked my waitress (wildflower) who was great by the way. To send the sandwich back and get a new one without the relish. While I was waiting I started eating my small side Caesar salad, where I proceed to find not one, not two but three lettuce cores. This felt a little over the top to me, for the size of the salad. 

I wish I could say that was it but my friends meal was not any better then mine. She order the steak fajitas Lone Stars most popular order. The fried onions and peppers were barely cooked, they were almost raw. It was sent back to kitchen and returned with under cooked veggies and now OVER  cooked steak. My friend was disappointed considering the steak was fine the first time. So back again to the kitchen. 

By the time all the corrections were made, we lost our hopes of enjoying a nice meal, we ate and once it was time for the check were extremely disappointed to see nothing was discounted or comped, considering how problematic the whole experience was this evening. 

The one shining light on the meal was the waitress she was wonderful and supportive to the plight of the meal, we assured her nothing was her fault and she did a great job. 

I think it will be awhile until we return to Lone Star after this exhausting dinner experience this evening.

The night before again I had great service at a table with a customer.  Tonight I was by myself and 2 CBC employees came by, one with a Scottish accent.  The older guy was telling funny '70s stories, and I've been a bartender and waiter and all was well.  I didn't know them from the man in the moon but these guys I bought tequila for and they wanted to reciprocate.  

To the self-forcibly friendly blonde bartender, making patrons repeat themselves, blaming the Scot for not speaking clearly when reciprocating for a beverage, for running off the Scot and his Ontario colleague, for being aloof...for doing a SHITTY-ASS job judged by a Chicago bartender...I wish the 5% tip you immediately bitched about to the Filipino cook and female colleagues...I wish I made it 0%, but of course I stayed and was polite and turned the thing towards you so you knew I meant the 5% tip.  

WHY would you ignore these guys buying me a drink back?!  WHY would you steer them away from Johnny Walker?!  Why were you so palpably nasty underneath a Saran-Wrap thin veneer of forcible friendly?  One employee needs to go.  The rest of the staff and company do a great job.  5 stars outside of this consummately unsavory experience with civil, mealy-mouthed customers from Scotland.  Sad.  Dogshit experience tonight.  100% dogshit.  But a WONDERFUL Tex-Mex replicated locale with great staff outside this instance.  Brav-O!"}
{"text":"Previously this was our fave Tex Mex restaurant for 15 years. Now appears to be under new management, new menu, higher prices! I asked for a garlic shrimp skewer with my rib eye steak, new waiter didn't know what I was talking about. He brought me a supposedly garlic shrimp side dish consisting of a few tiny tasteless shrimp (what garlic?) buried under onions peppers and tomatoes. Awful! Red Lobster has nothing to worry about. I told him so. He said nothing. No offer even for a substitute. There was no salt or pepper at our table. I had to ask for both, separately. My daughter's fajitas had undercooked veggies. Steak was not up to previous Lone Star standards even though now $34! Used to love this place but I guess they fired the old staff including the cook. Bye bye Lone Star."}
{"text":"What a terrible experience. 

We came here last week and waited at the front reception for 5 minutes, until we were told to seat ourselves. 

Then after we did we waited in the dining room for 10 minutes, and no one even acknowledged us, or offered to bring us menus. 

We got up and left and no one noticed or even seemed to care..."}
{"text":"I took my mother to Lonestar Milton for a late Mothers Day dinner. What a mistake! The food was horrible. 
I ordered a 14oz Steak dinner and my mom ordered the ribs. We ordered calamari to start. 
The calamari was decent. 
The rest was NOT edible. The ribs were hands down the worst I've ever tried. The steak was over cooked and a obvious cheap cut of meat. This meal was not even up to mall food court quality. 
We spoke to the staff and management who were all understanding and did not charge us for the rib dinner which could not be eaten.  
I've  never complained in my life about food at a restaurant and definitely NEVER sent food back. That's how bad this food was."}
{"text":"Lone Star was a \"lets go here instead\" when Pai was 150% full.
Out of all the options on the street, Lone Star wasn't a bad idea. The inside was basically empty as everybody wanted to be on the patio but us.

Our server was amazing and he kept coming around to fill the chips and salsa (which are complimentary) and to check in on us.

The food was decent:
1. My sister got the steak and it was cooked perfectly like she wanted; medium rare with a side of mashed potatoes and vegetables.  
2. My sister's boyfriend got the salmon which I didn't like as it smelled/tasted fishy but the sauce that came with it was bomb.  It was spicy and had a distinct sweet flavour.
3. My boyfriend got the bacon burger and it was HUGE.  It was actually delicious besides the fact it was a heart attack between 2 buns.
4. I got the ribs and chicken wings; both with BBQ sauce.  I loved my mashed potatoes and ribs which were tender and saucy.  The chicken wings however was a huge negative. Gross.

Overall, the place was nice but not nice enough for me to visit again as there are so many more places to eat in the downtown core."}
{"text":"The food here is consistently great!  The staff on the other hand is a hit or a miss.  If you go with a large group expect lots of screw ups and slow service. If you go with a group of 4 or less you should be safe"}
{"text":"Used the call ahead that they have, arrived 10 minutes prior to the time, and was seated immediately. Colt (his LoneStar given name) was our server, very attentive and knowledgable! The homemade nachos and salsa are pretty good! 

I was reluctant to get the 14oz ribeye steak after my experience at Montana's where the steak was absolutely tasteless, tough and watery bagged mashed potatoes. 

If you want an awesome steak, LoneStar is the place to go! I had asked for salt and pepper when I received my steak - prior to tasting it, and by the time Colt came back with the salt and pepper shakers, I had eaten a couple of bites of the steak, and declined the salt and pepper shakers!

The only complaint I have about the steak is that I did not have enough room to eat another one! Will definitely make a return trip, and will most definitely ask for Colt as a server! 

So glad Colt recommended having the steak medium well (I usually order medium rare) as I wasn't disappointed! 

Great job to the other waiters and waitresses who kept checking on us in between Colt checking to see if we needed anything! 

Look forward to returning!"}
{"text":"First time eating here last night Family Day Our family of five arrived at 6:30pm and were greeted by  lots of other families waiting on tables too. We hadn't booked a table so we're advised it would be 50 minutes waiting time. Luckily for us very luckily I walked through the bar just as a table became free so we're able to take the table in the bar straight away. I'm not sure we would have waited 50 minutes. The service was friendly and swift despite it clearly being very busy. We got a couple of portions of the $1 chips and salsa for starters very fresh chips and salsa amazing value. My wife and I got the Fajitas for two with steak and Chicken. They were amazing the steak was particularly good. Again the tortilla shells were super fresh you can see them make them fresh in house. Two of our kids also ordered fajitas which they loved our youngest got the chicken nuggets and fries which he ate which is always hit or miss. The kids meal came with desserts ice cream and worms which they also really enjoyed. All in all a very enjoyable experience really good food good value and friendly staff. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time on a Monday night. The ambiance was nice and the restaurant looked fairly clean. Ordered the $19.95 deal which was a steal for the chips & cheese & salsa, side salad, and an entrée. I ended up getting the steak entrée, which also comes with frozen veggies, potato wedges, onion rings and a baked potato. It was good aside from the vegetables that tasted frozen. The beer also came a little bit warm. Overall, the food was mediocre, and the service was okay. Will be coming back next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Excellent service; prompt, friendly and attentive. A Well-managed establishment. Good atmosphere and a great menu. Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Quite possibly, and this is not an exaggeration, the worst food in Richmond Hill. Every time myself and my friends have gone over the last two years, we fall tremendously sick with food poisoning. 

The manager is unfriendly and the food is not fresh. Lately, the waiters have started this new system where they \"force\" you to sit in the bar, so it is easy for the waiters to get to your table. If the restaurant is empty, why can't I sit where I want? It's very strange. 

Lone Star was great 15 years ago, but not any more I'm afraid."}
{"text":"As with other Lone Stars, the food here is great but the service stinks.  We waited and waited for our food, and it took near 2 hours to have lunch.  While I like the food, they really need to work on efficiency... Especially when serving kids!"}
{"text":"Friendly wait staff, very attentive.  I ordered the Cabo Tacos (they may have been a seasonal special) and they were very good. Too much food for me... I ended up picking the chicken out of the second taco just to finish it. A nice warm spiciness to them.  

Prices are reasonable. Lots of TVs in the bar area where I sat. Lots of high tops for parties of four or less. 

If you are super annoyed by country music ( I am not ) then I would not advise here as they play nothing but country music."}
{"text":"Wasn't terribly impressed with the experience I had here. Came with two co-workers for lunch on Wednesday afternoon around 12:45 PM. The place wasn't really that busy at all (maybe only like 2 or 3 other tables in the dining area when we first got there), which partly contributes to the below-average review. While the hostess and server were both friendly, the food took sooooo long to come, it was kind of ridiculous. I ordered crispy salmon tacos, and my co-workers ordered fajitas and enchiladas. All relatively simple things. Our server told us the food would probably come quickly, but in the end we ended up waiting for about 20 minutes for our food to come... only to find out they messed up my order and gave me a sandwich instead. Not impressed. They took the food back to the kitchen to fix my order, but then it was ANOTHER long wait... during which no one really came to check on us or update us on the status of my meal. When we managed to flag our server down, he told us they were \"fixing it\" in the kitchen and that it would probably come out in about 2 minutes. He was mistaken though, because it was at least another 10 minutes before my food actually came - another waitress actually came to our table and took my co-workers' meals back to the kitchen to \"keep them warm\" in the meantime. A nice gesture, but still can't compensate for the fact that we wasted a lot of time just waiting for our food.

The tacos were pretty good, were presented nicely, and were a good-sized portion. They also came with a side of mashed potatoes which were tasty. If the service had been better I would have been able to give this place a better rating because the food is decent, but the tacos just weren't quite worth the wait. It also took us some time to get someone's attention so we could get the bill and pay. In general, service was lacking because no one really bothered to check up or pay attention to us, which kind of soured the whole experience, especially given that they were NOT busy at all!

Also I'm torn between loving the environment (all that country music and plaid) or just finding it ridiculously tacky."}
{"text":"I've been here three times. No matter what we order, the food all tastes the same as though it's baked in the same bbq sauce. 

Staff is friendly but they are not good at serving large groups."}
{"text":"Food was surprisingly more delicious than I anticipated. 

I should have eaten here last night instead of the go horrible excuse of Caribbean food I had. 

We had the steak nachos, margaritas and chicken and ribs combo. Well seasoned and cooked to perfection. 

The waited was kind enough to change the drink my wife had for something else. I appreciate that. 

My only disappointment was the wait for the food. I don't have. A problem waiting as I can tell the food was freshly made. I wish someone followed up and updated us on the wait time. 

Nice atmosphere, cool staff and patrons"}
{"text":"I've been to 2 other lone star's, both of which were really excellent.  It has been 4 years....so maybe the quality of the food has gone down with this chain?

The chips and salsa are great, as usual.  And, for those complaining about paying for the salsa, they donate the proceeds to charity, that's why they started charging for it (I actually ASKED my waitress folks, imagine that!) 

The margarita was average, no salt on the rim.

The fajitas, I had the steak, added salsa.  Meat was tough, overcooked, etc.  I was not happy, skirt steak is really tough when it's not medium rare!

I'll try the one on Dixon......or, more likely, I'll read some current yelp reviews for it, to determine  whether it was an off night or a bad location, before I venture back!"}
{"text":"The fajitas are fantastic!   You get complimentary chips and salsa.   Great place! Extremely large too so great for large groups.   I imagine there are a lot of office parties here! 

I've also had the steak,  it's pretty good too, but the fajitas are fantastic!"}
{"text":"Quick, friendly service. The bartender had to ask one of the guests of our party what was in the drink he ordered (a black Russian), but other than that the service was good.

The tortilla soup has become a delicious classic for me whenever I visit a Lone Star. The brisket sandwich was done perfectly, with the shavings perfectly pulled and coated in a delicious smoky BBQ sauce. The bun was toasted just right."}
{"text":"Order the wicked cheesey dip for your compelmentary bottemless tacos/salsa!

If you want to avoid kids screaming sit in the bar! Their wait staffs very friendly and quick.

The chicken/steak fajita's for 2 are also delicious!

About a 10minute walk from union station."}
{"text":"Uninspired and insipid Tex-Mex fare.  Only the beer was good, well-served cold and frosty.  And you'll  need a few to choke down this dismal food.  We started off with some tortilla chips and an acceptable queso dip (rather runny though) but things worsened from there.  Overly sweet and greasy chicken wings, ditto for the baby-back barbeque pork ribs (more Southern than Texan - but this was Canada so maybe its all the same up in the Great White North), dull and chewy beef fajitas, tough and dry ribeye steaks ... eh, why go on with this review, it's too depressing to recap it further.  (When the waitress asked if we wanted to pack up the leftovers, we blanched and hastily but gently rebuffed her.)"}
{"text":"Well, I guess the first thing we need to talk about is Lone Star's questionable decision to do away with the free nachos and salsa. I remember that was a big highlight of a trip to Lone Star, but times are tough, I suppose. You want those nachos and salsa, you're sure as hell gonna pay for 'em.

Anyway, I decided to order the Chicken Chimichanga (\"Ancho-brushed flour tortilla with wood fire grilled chicken and jack cheese, crispy fried and topped with ranchero sauce, cheese, pico de gallo, cilantro and sour cream\").

I'll be honest, this was exactly what I wanted when I walked through the door. I wanted something ludicrously big and overflowing with sauce and cheese. The taste isn't exactly robust; the more you eat this thing, the more apparent the limitations of its flavor. But that didn't bother me in the slightest. The chicken was plentiful, and the accompanying refried beans and rice were perfect.

Sometimes you just feel like a meal that's absurdly, obviously bad for you."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner, and I probably wouldn't return here to dine-in. 

Service was horrible! We walked in and waited where we were supposed to (near the please wait here sign), one waitress was like \"one moment,\" so we waited and she walked away. Another waitress comes towards the table, sees us and told us after that she \"thought the other waitress helped us.\" We waited for about 10 minutes. That was ridiculous. After getting seated, our waitress took the longest time to come take our order, at this point I just wanted to leave. 

However, the food was delicious!! We got the coconut shrimp as an appetizer, and the fajita fiesta for 2 as our main course. Both were well done, and we were satisfied with meal. 

Wouldn't be back at this location for dine-in though, probably try another location."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday night.   

Their website has a special that should feed 4 people for 55 dollars.  

it is a fajita special.  Fajita wrap is made fresh in house and is unlimited. Way thicker than typical fajita wraps.  More like a Pita.  

anyways, we order steak and buffalo chicken.   the steak tasted good.  no complaints about the taste.  However, the bill was 58 dollars.  When we mentioned why, they said because steak costs more.  However, on the website it does not mention this.. the server also did not mention this.   Not a big deal but it would have been nice if he mentioned it earlier. 

probably wont be back."}
{"text":"Average food at best. Went for their Cinco de mayo specials. Nothing great. Servers were trying to cope with the traffic and were confused about table numbers and messed up our order over and over.

Probably not going to return to this location!"}
{"text":"Very standard chain like food.
The staff is friendly and the bar area is lively, but the food is nothing to write home about
The steak salad I had here was much better then the actual tex-mex food i tried here

The steak in the salad was cooked very well and the salad had a lot of flavor

The Enchilada meal was on the bland side in every aspect of the meal
I am a huge rice lover, and the rice here really did not cut it for me. It was very blahh, as were the beans that came with it.
The enchilada itself almost reminded me of the ones i microwave at home, with very little flavor aside from the steak that was inside.

To be fair I really did not expect this to wow me from the get go, as Tex-Mex is not very prevalent in Canada, a solid 3 for Canada, but lower when compared to the standard stuff in Cali or NY"}
{"text":"Went here for because I had a craving for beef and the Greek restaurant's steak looked pretty pricey.  So we switched to Lone Star.

The steak tasted good but it was really tough. I couldn't really complain because I was busy chewing when they asked how was it. 

The unlimited tortilla was not as hot and fresh as I wanted it, it was a bit on the not so hot side. Probably because there wasn't too many people in the restaurant when we got it. I also asked for their sour cream dip. Makes it taste so much better.

I think I should have just stayed at the Greek restaurant in the end."}
{"text":"My daughter loves the ribs here. The fajitas are ok, and the rice sides are fine. It's not bad, but not great either. Basic standard chain food fair.
It can get very busy, so make a reservation if you are going to be in a rush."}
{"text":"I've had good to great experiences every time we have been here. Tonight Harley was serving us and she was awesome! Funny, attentive and knowledgeable about the menu items we asked about. My hubby had a steak which he says was awesome. I had some Mexican Chicken Bowl thing (I think it's specific to the summer menu). It was awesome (although too spicy for my taste but that's not surprising!). The bowl would convert nicely for anyone that wants to make it into a vegan dish.  Definitely recommend it and I'll be having it again (except without the sauce which is what adds the spicy factor)."}
{"text":"Wrong wrong wrong.  I came in late night when lots of waitress standing around but none greeted me to a table.  I had to ask.  The nacho came out promptly but I couldn't eat much because it was so greasy.  I added a pic to show how shiny and oily the chips were - like leaves with morning dew in a bad way.  I had the falafael enchilada with mesquite skirt steak and it was good.  I liked the baked beans, slightly sweet but not
over powering the bean taste.  The falafael just had meat and cheese and some salsa sauce on top.  The side of lettuce and tomatoe was ok - didn't look too fresh.  I asked for it to pack it up and I was given just a take out plastic box - no bag, no plastic utensils, no napkin.  The place was huge with plenty of parking space.  It is close to lots of hotels near airport.  If you feel like some meat, go to Zet's which is open 24hrs and cheaper and better tasting food.  Since both basically offer no service, Zet is better choice."}
{"text":"The restaurant was practically empty yet it took a while to get our food. I had the fish tacos they were good. I'd recommend getting the spicy sauce on the side and putting it on yourself, its rather piled on.  

It was two rather big tacos with a big spoonful of rice and a dipping sauce bowl of refried beans.

The rice... I will eat almost anything and I could barely choke down a forkful. It looked like leftovers from the night before. The beans were for sure. They had a sprinkling of hard cheese and had a thick skin. Not the making of a delicious meal. 

The tacos were good but I can't say anything else good. Also it cost $22 with a pop and tax and tip. Not worth it for just 2 tacos and a pop."}
{"text":"Another great Lone Star location.

Not all of them are great, but this one was as good as a model downtown one, at least for my taste.

Food quality was Lone Star level. Service was friendly, fast and efficient. Clean new place with right music at right volume, people around enjoying their meals and atmosphere.

Margaritas and ribs were as good as they always make them, steak was gorgeous - please don't come to me with the Keg greasy stuff... Portion sizes were right on the money.

Lone Star is not cheap, and that's ok. I don't mind paying for something decent, and the price is right.

This is a new location, and I hope they'll keep it going as well as I've seen them during my first visit."}
{"text":"I love this place.

Not without shortcomings, and definitely on a pricey side for a tex mex - but still one of my \"default\" destinations in Toronto.

My favourite plate is a stake and ribs combo with Texas-size margarita. Fajitas are also good, but be prepared to work on them - too much to stuff in, not enough to wrap around...

Staff is super-friendly, open, helpful, and overall provide a genuine feeling of hospitality. Rare thing - and I only observed that at the Front Street location, others were hugely inferior in this sense.

Safe to drop in with children. I've seen great little fiestas going around, with quite an amusing participation of the restaurant staff. They also did not hesitate a second to calm down some drunk idiots annoying the rest of the customers, and did that in a very polite and professional way.

The place is always at least half-full, but you never need to wait for more than 5-10 minutes after dropping in in the worst case.

Also, same level of service and quality of food have not changed for at least two years I am going to Lone Star - impressive. Keep on the great job, guys!

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I sincerely hope this isn't any Canadian's only experience with Tex Mex, because as an American, I can tell you this is a bad one.

This place has been open in Oakville for awhile and we just tried it for the first time. I was initially excited because QUESO! It's hard to find up here! The service was friendly and the decor is like a caricature of Texas. It's like someone visited Texas once and took all the stereotypes home with them to Canada.  

My Husband and I ended up getting the queso and fajitas to share. The queso was so-so - good enough that I'd be happy to have it again because even mediocre queso is better than no queso at all, but also strange - it kind of tastes like spaghettios with no pasta in it.

The fajitas came hot and sizzling to the table along with tortillas and toppings. It looked good! We happily made our fajitas and chowed down, but within moments, our eyes met across the table, each registering a small amount of disgust. 

The meat (steak and chicken) had no seasoning and was super bland. It was also rubbery and felt like it was incredibly cheap. But the worst part was the tortillas. I have had a lot of tortillas in my life, including in Mexico, and I've never had a tortilla that was so elastic that you could pull on it and instead of tearing, it just snaps back, like skin. They almost felt like they were made of rice! 

We decided to just deal and eat, because we were both starving and we didn't want to waste the food, but it was like when you're in college and the only thing in your apartment to eat is a dusty package of ramen that you find shoved behind the microwave that was probably left by your roommate's ex 2 years ago. It's not satisfying, but at least you're not hungry anymore. 

I wish I had had that ramen, though. The ramen wouldn't have cost me $75.00."}
{"text":"Friendly and helpful staff. The food is always awesome. Sucks that they charge for tortilla chips now. Delicious and always fun."}
{"text":"I was starving on arrival to Toronto! I was passing by and felt like having a steak.  I was not disappointed. Large portion and very tasty."}
{"text":"Food is good, I had the rib and wings combo,  my wife had chicken fajitas.  Maybe Sunday of family day weekend was a bad day to come but service was very slow... too almost 45 mins for dinner to arrive.  Waitress seemed slammed and wasn't easy to flag down for missing condiments, extra Tortilla shells etc."}
