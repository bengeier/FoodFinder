{"text":"First visit today. 

When I walked in, the first thing I noticed was the dirty mirrors that covered the north wall. They had a thick film on them. Most likely hadn't been cleared in over a year. 

The woman at the counter greeted us right away, and was very friendly. I ordered the beef & broccoli and a medium Mountain Dew. The \"Mountain Dew\" didn't taste like Mountain Dew at all. It wasn't the right color either. I'm guessing it was some kind of generic soda. After explaining that it tasted funny, I asked to have Dr Pepper instead. The Dr Pepper also tasted funny, and was probably generic too. As a side note: Sometimes I buy generic soda in two liter bottles, and I do like the taste of most of them, but these two sodas tasted too bad for me to finish them. When my broccoli & beef arrived, I noticed that the meat was so dark it was almost black. That usually means it isn't very fresh. It tasted very salty too. Some of the broccoli was yellow as well. The only two flavors in the meal were bland and salty. Even the fortune cookie was bland. 

The staff is friendly, the food is cheap, and you almost get what you pay for (except for the soda. I would have preferred tap water). I'm assuming that something changed about a year ago. This place had good reviews before then. Unless they make some radical changes for the better, I don't plan on returning."}
{"text":"Great food and at an affordable price! $25 fed my family of 5 :) And my wife loved it...\"It's just what I have been looking for! And it hit the spot!!\""}
{"text":"Been here twice, so far pretty good.  Lunch specials are good price (~$5.55), and fairly good portion of food.

(lunch) Kung Pao chicken here is amazing, love the flavor and variety. Quite spicy (though from what I hear you can request it not to be spicy).

(lunch) Tried a little of my friend's orange chicken, the sauce and texture of the chicken was good (crunchy/crispy, if I recall right).

(dinner) Teriyaki Chicken was just alright though, the sauce seemed strong.

Plan on coming back again, maybe for more that non- or light spicy kung pao"}
{"text":"I was very disappointed in this meal last night. Based on the reviews I expected good quality food but instead the lo meins were lacking flavor, the orange chicken was soggy, and the crab cream cheese puffs had no crab. Don't eat here, there are other choices in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Love Queens Bowl. Good quality food at a good price. Their service is friendly and fast."}
{"text":"The best $5 dollar Chinese food around!  I come here regularly for their lunch specials.  You can get a very tasty Mongolian beef dish with white rice, egg roll or crab puff for under $5.  They have about 14 lunch specials to choose from or the extensive a la cart menu.  It's no frills dinning at its best."}
{"text":"They fix My Kung Po special with vegetables I like, no celery. Husband and wife team work very fast to get your order quickly on lunch hour. Very large portion for lunch low price."}
{"text":"Just horrible.  Food lacks taste/flavor.  First time there and last time.  I ordered my food at 11AM \"right when they opened\" and said I would be by at 11:45AM to pick it up.  I arrived at 11:50 and the place was empty, no customers and one lady working behind the counter. I asked for my order and she told me \"Oh I forgot about your order. I had a big order and forgot yours\".    She put it together quickly, like in 2 minutes (one entrée and one chicken bowl).   I ordered Orange Chicken and had a few co-workers try it to make sure it wasn't my taste buds.  All said its missing something and one said it tasted like they used Sweet and Sour Chicken and poured Orange sauce over it.  I gave most of it away and threw away about 20% of it.  I called and told the lady and told her the Orange Chicken tasted like sweet and sour with orange sauce poured over it. She said, \"same chicken for all entree's and we pour the sauce for the entrée you select\". . . So, now I know why it lacks taste/flavor.  Will not go back. . the egg rolls were good though.   Also, the pricing is not correct in the menu pic on this site.  The entree's are about .50 cents more and the bowls are 5.35 each. . not worth it.  Too expensive."}
{"text":"This is the first time we ordered from Queens Chinese Bowl. It is Fantastic.We ate 3 hours ago and my boyfriend is still talking about it. We are very very picky about fresh good food, and this was both.
We asked for a recommendation when we called and we ate all 3 entrees and we are not big eaters..it was just so good we couldn't stop."}
{"text":"This is the best beef chow fun in town.  Very authentic and just as good as the stuff i got in cali.  This is not on the menu so make sure to ask the super nice owners for it."}
{"text":"This place is an institution. I've been eating here for over 30 years. It's not the best, but it's definitely one of the best values in the area for a quick Chinese meal. The food is always fresh, and they will make it to order for a reasonable price. The combo meals are the best value. Give them a try, if you've never been. It's best know for take-out, since it's just a strip mall store."}
{"text":"This is some extremely terrible Chinese food. I really wanted some Chinese and took a chance on this place. I ordered the general chicken combo which comes with an  egg roll and \"fried rice\". Firstly you get a decent amount of food but the quality is really really bad. I hate to leave such a negative review but I feel totally duped. The general sauce taste like pure salt. No flavor. The \"fried rice\" is white rice that has a brown hue on it. There are no vegetables or egg or taste. Nothing! 

I HATE Panda Express but I'd much rather waste my money there than here."}
{"text":"Was looking for a good local Chinese restaurant that delivered and this place did!  Best egg rolls I've had in a long time and the orange chicken & Mongolian beef was great too!  This is our new fave :)"}
{"text":"Good family owned fast food Chinese restaurant.  IMO, much better than something like Panda Express.  The owners are a nice older couple who are always there.  Very inexpensive prices, lunch specials at $5.55 and they deliver."}
{"text":"I eat here probably 4 times a month, and that's been for the past two years. The food is always amazing, and the customer service is amazing as well. They have great portions, they don't fill everything with just rice, and the prices are wonderful! All of my coworkers and my self, love this place."}
{"text":"Super nice people however the food was so tasteless. Sorry I hate to give a bad review but I should have \"listened \" to the yelpers. It was Saturday, and we literally were the only people there(second red flag). Nice people. Got the food to go. Very disappointed once we started eating. My kid was as well~ and he rarely complains. Thought I'd save the food and \"doctor it up\" the following day with my own seasonings. Nope. Right into the trash. Bummer because I bought a large quantity for the next day.Lesson learned."}
{"text":"My family has a spot that we have been frequenting in the Metro area for 20 yrs.  & this may have topped it! Found on AroundMe app one night & it checked all our boxes- delivery option, cheap, delicious, soup that tastes authentic, fresh veggies- just such a find! My husband & I have become regulars."}
{"text":"Well, they deliver to my house so that is something. The food on the other hand, is not that great. It hits the spot when I am in the mood for some greasy msg laden noodles but overall nothing to go out of your way for."}
{"text":"I wish there was a negative 10 for this place. While the cashier was super friendly, the food was overpriced and SO disgusting!!! We ordered crab puffs, chicken and broccoli, orange chicken and kung pao chicken. Everything except the chicken and broccoli had a strange taste to it. It was like someone has spilt a chemical in the food. Horrendous!!! The chicken and broccoli was mediocre...nothing to rave about. We had high expectations for this place and we're sourly disappointed. Don't waste your money...Panda would be a much better choice."}
{"text":"Worst Chinese food I have ever eaten.  Went for lunch special, beef and broccoli.  Food has a chlorine taste to it, as if there was soap residue on the items they used to cook it or else the water quality was so poor that it could be tasted in everything.  The foul smell in the dining area didn't help.  I was the only one there, took about 3 minutes to make- suggesting to me that it was reheated or something.   Took one bite of beef, one of broccoli, one of the rice, closed up my styrofoam plate, threw it out, and left.  Almost an $8 lesson.  You have been warned."}
{"text":"NYE. 9:30. Our Chinese food/Twilight Zone NYE tradition was almost ruined because we ordered food from our usual place too late and they were closed. But Queen's Bowl was indeed open, and they delivered! It took under 30 minutes, the food arrived piping hot and delicious. Now we have a new regular Chinese food delivery that we love! Thank you, Queen's Bowl! Happy non Chinese New Year!"}
{"text":"The husband and wife are very polite. Good food for a reasonable price. You got to try the #65 Chow Fun with pork. That was the bomb!!!"}
