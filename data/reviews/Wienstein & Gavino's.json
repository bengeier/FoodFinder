{"text":"Service was outstanding.  I ordered pasta arrabiata and it was quite good.  The coffee is very good here too along with the pizza crust."}
{"text":"I traveled to Montreal for the first time for business and had dinner here with some coworkers. For a Wednesday evening, the place was hopping, but we were still able to get a table. We were served warm bread and olive oil and pesto once we sat down. I had gnocchi, which you could pair with any sauce you wanted, which for Montreal didn't seem overpriced at around 14$. The portion was enough that I had leftovers for lunch the following day. The waitstaff was on top of everything, so I didn't feel ignored or intruded upon. Nice atmosphere.  The only thing I didn't like about this place, is you don't get free refills on soda, which I was told is common for Montreal. It was 3.50$ for an 8 oz glass of soda."}
{"text":"Such good food!!! Not cheap. I had the duck confit mushroom risotto and it was THE BEST. Also the bread dip they give every table is Sooo yummy."}
{"text":"Just had margherita pizza and it was really good.The amountnofnsauce and mozarella was used perfectly..loved the combination.. thebservicenwas pretty goodni forgotnthe name of the waitress but she wad awesome...if i ever come back to Canada I willndef come back to W&G...."}
{"text":"Pros  - Good portion - Great location - Patio seating allows you to people-watch - Moderately priced - complementary hot bread and pesto - decent bar  Cons - food takes a while - bartenders are not experienced - kinda pushy about drinks (but given the location, that's not surprising)"}
{"text":"We had a great meal & experience overall....very family friendly for starters. The restaurant has a really cool, fun atmosphere. Is it loud? Yes...but we were on a family vacation not a romantic or business dinner so it didn't bother us in the least...  Kids menu is great - plenty of options. Bread was hot & pesto was fresh & delicious.   Bruschetta was perfect & a nice portion size for sharing.   My husband's seafood risotto was excellent ... I got the garlic shrimp but wasn't exactly as the menu described it & a bit lacking in garlic & sauce considering the title.  Was not looking for a pasta with red sauce & this is how it arrived.   Service was a little slow initially but picked up & ended up being great by the end.   Would definitely come back though & try something different."}
{"text":"The staff at Wienstein & Gavino's truly know how to provide exceptional service to their customers.  The food was delicious and the portions very filling.  The wait staff was extremely pleasant and really managed the large party very well.  We were a party of 44 traveling with a youth hockey team.  Everyone enjoyed the food and atmosphere.  If your looking for a great meal in a fun atmosphere I would visit W&G."}
{"text":"Spaghetti was pretty good. American style spaghetti not very italian. The noodles did not taste home made. The sauce was meaty and with a sweet hint. Very satisfying. They gave us bread with pesto. bread was very good and still hot from the oven the pesto was with olive oil. Tasted amazing."}
{"text":"A little pricey, it is on Crescent Street afterall. Good ambiance and great people watching from the patio, especially the Sopranos-like paesanos in the restaurant across the street. Had calamari that was literally delivered by a crane, it was huge; and very good. Pastas were crafted well and very satisfying. Princess Bride enjoyed the salads and bread there. C'est bon mes amis."}
{"text":"Came in for a quick drink. Nice environment, drinks weren't bad. Glad that the music was not overly loud. Very good BOGO drink specials during happy hour."}
{"text":"We booked online and told the restaurant that is was our 25th Wedding Anniversary and that with my two adult children we would be arriving at 7:15. Mentioning this to the Host and then to Billy our server was unnecessary. They were both very aware and proceeded throughout the night to make our experience special by seating us immediately in what I would consider the best seat in the house and being there with recommendations and service without looking for them once. Our meals were extra ordinary, pasta, pizza appetizers to die for and fabulous tasty deserts. We couldn't ask for a better memory to have. My wife and family were so pleased with our 25th wedding anniversary experience of fabulous food and five star service experience in the heart of Crescent St.. Thank-you Billy and W&G for our time with you."}
{"text":"if you are looking for a delicious dinner and a hip bar/lounge scene, wienstein and gavino's is the place for you.  the wait staff is helpful, friendly, and attractive.  the menu has plenty of choices (pasta, pizza, and main dishes) for those who want italian.  the crowd is eclectic; we noted a healthy mix of college kids celebrating birthdays, families, and couples.  the gnochi was hearty.  our waiter offered to top it with some mozarella and bake it.  the serving size was more than adequate(!).   my wife had chicken filled with goat cheese and red peppers.  again, her plate had lots of food.  make sure you come hungry!"}
{"text":"Super place for families. Tony our waiter did everything and more to accommodate us. Food was underwhelming"}
{"text":"Ate there twice this week, food excellent both times. They need to expand the desert menu tho."}
{"text":"Huge portions and tasty food.  The restaurant is very big so tables are pretty easy to get.  My kids couldn't get enough of my gnocchi with pesto sauce.  The osso bucco was enormous and the kids menu pizza was big enough to feed an adult."}
{"text":"This place was recommended by a bouncer outside a bar down the block and couldn't have been more pleased. The service, ambiance and location were all perfect for what we were looking for. We didn't realize how much the Italian cuisine dominates in Montreal. So pleased with our dishes! I had the manicotti special which was amazing. The bread and butter at the table was also so warm and a perfect accompaniment to the pasta dishes. The menu was huge and offered a lot of options."}
{"text":"The staff were very nice and the food was great.  The pasta portion sizes are way too large for most humans!"}
{"text":"The food is always amazing. The wait times are a bit much... but what do you expect lol, this place is in a perfect location and has such a great Italian decor. Makes me feel at home.  It isn't too pricey, which is good. I always get the Tortellini with rosé sauce, it is incredible :D!!   I always come here when I'm looking for good Italian food. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Okay okay okay! First of all best pasta ever! I had tortellini rose gratinee yes I know very boring but how can a chef go wrong with that dish, Right? Well anyways it was amazing!! Even the drinks were delicious!  The only problem I had .. it was extremely loud.. I could barley hear my freind.. by the end of the night I was annoyed it felt like I went clubbing. It was terrible. But the food is worth it. Hopefuy when it gets warmer outside we can sit on the terrace.."}
{"text":"Waited two hours for my pizza and while I got my pizza I just asked for my bill so I don't have to wait another hour for it .... Not happy"}
{"text":"Nice restaurant, great vibe, great area. We ordered the mussels and the assorted meats plate. The red broth with the mussels was delightful and was the perfect dipping sauce for the bread. Meat platter was basic and again the bread stole the show. Each meals is paired with hot fresh bread, how can you go wrong?"}
{"text":"I made a reservation for New Years Eve specifically because the restaurant said you could order of the regular menu as well as the special new years menu. Having a food allergy this works for me because there are certain things I can't eat. When we sat I asked for the regular menu and they said \"Sorry its only the special menu this evening\".  It was really all down hill from there. My girlfriend and I dined alone, and picked a later time to go to dinner. We were sat in between two large groups, both having small children. We were lost in between and sometimes would go twenty minutes before even seeing our server. It got to the point where I had to flag them down and ask for the check. I know places are busy on NYE but still not ok.  On a positive note the food was good, but I was disappointing with the bait and switch menu, and the lack of service."}
{"text":"OK food, great ambiance/look, bad service and - not worth the price. While their risotto is fantastic (not too creamy), their steak was gummy and the majority of it was inedible fat. Veggies and potatoes were very good but let's be real, that will never make up for a bad steak. Their desserts are overpriced and way too small (not the delicacy type tiny). The waiters/waitresses were extremely rude, water was not refilled and they didn't bother to come check up on their clients. Given the great downtown location & trendy look, I gave it two stars but...save your money."}
{"text":"Ça faisait longtemps que je n'avais pas mangé des pâtes aussi bonne.  Paperdelles sauce aux champignons.  Succulent.  Grand restaurant donc, bon pour les groupes.  Ambiances agréable. Un peu bruyante mais ce n'est pas tellement une place pour les souper romantique. Stationnement très difficile.  Les prix sont raisonnable surtout pour cette qualité de bouffe.  Allez-y sans hésitation"}
{"text":"Can't understand the thing with this restaurant! It was very noisy, difficult to talk to the person on the opposite side of the table. The pasta carbonara was average, nothing special. The staff was nice and attentive but I Would not go here again."}
{"text":"NOT SAFE FOR FOOD ALLERGIES  I like this place and have gone several times for drinks, dinner, etc. I actually like the place a quite a bit, but I will never order any of the 'gluten free' pasta ever again. For someone with a true wheat or gluten allergy, the salad is the only safe bet for dinner. I got quite ill after ordering the gluten free pasta on a busy night, which is a real shame because it actually was pretty tasty.   I've talked with the manager about this and she said that they boiled it in the same water as the regular wheat pasta. Their kitchen has a lot of cross contamination. It's fine if you're doing the paleo diet or avoiding certain grains out of choice, but otherwise stick to the cocktails and the salad menu."}
{"text":"Great place on Crescent St.  Italian food was awesome.  The bread and pesto was out of this world.  Ate the the yellowfin tuna with veggies and fargola- amazing.  Great staff and excellent service"}
{"text":"A good place to go when you are shopping downtown and you do not really want to venture out to try something new and interesting.  It is always really good service and the dishes are always ok."}
{"text":"We came here for restaurant week on a Friday night and the place was packed! It was bar-level noisy, so unless you and your date can yell to hear each other it's not ideal for intimate conversations. (On the plus side, could be great for group outings --at least 4 different groups were celebrating birthdays, complete with a sparkler on their dessert).   We thought the food was delicious and reasonably priced given that it's an Italian restaurant and you get free bread at the start. There's a $10 menu after 10pm (with a small selection of their regular dishes), and a different special for each day of the week for ~$25 which comes with a glass of wine. Hubby and I are already looking forward to coming back and taking advantage of these specials!"}
{"text":"Came here a few years ago for a friend's birthday. Honestly, I find that they priced their food a bit more than it should. I remembered I had a pasta and nothing was special about it. And my friends ordered other stuffs but didn't really grab my attention. I was quite disappointed as I heard good reviews about them... guess not!"}
{"text":"Why anyone would eat here in a city with a great Little Italy is beyond me. We went on the strong recommendation of our concierge and it was a mistake. It is on a street that is nearly a constant frat party, there is a ton of smoking on the terrace, even early in the evening, and the food was below average at best. I know everyone says that this place is an institution, but the food was institutional, so I recommend that you find some nice little place in Little Italy to enjoy real Italian food."}
{"text":"Waited forever to be served. I asked the waiter to check on our order because the table next to us ordered 5 minutes after us but they were already half way through their meal. My wife said they are going to spit in your food. Don't know if they did that but they added an ocean of salt to my hamburger. For this we paid sixty dollars."}
{"text":"I don't get the hype. This place has bland food and horrible customers and costumer service. They are genourouse with their servings though. They place is gorgeouse I'm guessing great for whine lovers I saw a good collection. But overall the diners at this place bothered me and the waiters were a bit absent minded."}
{"text":"Strange place... Rocking club like music with a pretty big Italian menu. We ordered the pizzas which were just ok."}
{"text":"This is a quintessential Crescent street experience: high on flash, low on content.   My pastas were alright, though nothing you could not do at home with a sauce bought at the grocery store. The white wine was way too cold when they brought it and very overpriced for such an average pinot grigio.   Places like those have their purposes: you can take a large group there as it won't bother anyone if you are noisy, and people's expectation regarding food are usually low. However, if you want to treat yourself to a good meal in good company, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"When in Montreal this past weekend, my friends and I actually came to this restaurant twice - once for dinner and then back for Sunday brunch.  Our dinner here on Friday night was one of my favorite meals while in Montreal.  This place has really great atmosphere - the décor is on the traditional side, but the music was current and a little louder which gave it a fun almost bar vibe which was great for a Friday night dinner with friends - might be a little loud if you were looking for a romantic dinner spot for two.  We decided on the a la carte menu even though it was taste of Montreal week.  A friend and I split the mussels to start and a pasta dish recommended by our server.  Both were delicious and it was plenty food for two.  I also sampled the caprese salad and Mediterranean salad which my other friends ordered and both were really good!  Also, this restaurant has some very reasonably priced wine, so it is a great place to have a few glasses of wine and get the night started.    Our brunch here on Sunday was good, but I definitely preferred this restaurant for dinner.  It opens at 10:30 for brunch on Sunday which is nice as most restaurants on Crescent didn't seem to open until 11 or 11:30.  I ended up ordering the mushroom and peppers pizza which was pretty good - I personally prefer my pizza crust a little thinner, but it had a great homemade taste and wasn't greasy at all.  I was really envious of a friend's order of the eggs benny, so if I am ever back for brunch this is what I will order.  Service was also a little slow for brunch, but this could be because we were there pretty early and it wasn't that busy yet so not many people seemed to be working.  Overall though, both of my experiences here were really good and this restaurant is definitely on my list to come back to when in Montreal again!!"}
{"text":"Grâce à mon blog (La Boufferie), j'ai été invité au lancement du nouveau menu de Wienstein & Gavino's. Le personnel était super accueillant et sympathique. (J'ai été invité pour un événement privé, c'est évident que le personnel est accueillant et sympathique me direz-vous, eh bien, je vous assure que ce n'est pas toujours le cas).  Sur place, j'ai pu goûter plusieurs plats de leur nouveau menu... pizza, pâtes, viandes, etc. et même assister à une démo de cuisine italienne par le chef lui-même qui est bien drôle.  Pour moi, le plus important dans un restaurant italien est la sauce. Si la sauce est bonne, tout peu passer. Ici, la sauce tomate est absolument délicieuse!   Il en va de même pour les boulettes de viandes qui sont juteuses et goûteuses.   Je vous suggère la poitrine de poulet parmesan gratinée au mozzarella et la lasagne au ricotta et épinard.   Ce qui m'a charmée? Les pâtes sont faites tous les matins que ce soit les pâtes ou les pâtes à pizza. L'endroit offre également des pâtes sans gluten, bien que celles-ci ne soient pas faites sur place, le restaurant n'utilise pas celles du commerce. Comme il y a trop de farine dans leur cuisine, ils ont trouvé préférable de faire affaire avec une entreprise qui leur fait des pâtes fraîches sans gluten. C'est tout à leur honneur.   J'ai adoré mon expérience. Tout ce que j'ai goûté était très bon.   *** Du dimanche au jeudi, le restaurant fait des spéciaux sur les plats et, le jeudi, sur le vin. Les bouteilles sont 30% - 40% moins chères. Pour ce qui est du vin, on retrouve des bouteilles allant de 33$ à 500$. Il y en a de tous les pays et pour tous les goûts."}
{"text":"My wife and I are visiting from the U.S. and decided to give this place a try last night for dinner since it seemed to be crowded, unlike many of the neighboring restaurants.  The food was good, but the service was awful.  That extra 40 minutes waiting for someone to come to our table and bring the check and wrap the food was not enjoyable.  The server could not handle a full section properly and nobody tried to assist her with waiting tables.  I had to get a manager to finally make it happen.  Too bad, but poor service is never a fair compromise for good food."}
{"text":"Very much a Crescent street tourist hangout. About as authentic as Mario and Luigi.  Great for American tourists and Mom and Dad visiting their little princess who goes to McGill ;)"}
{"text":"Decent food, quite loud for a Thursday night. Delicious bread and pesto- warm and satisfying. Service was great."}
{"text":"Terrible service and 50 minute wait for food.  Completely unorganized kitchen.  The appetizer was good at least.  We left before our meal was served."}
{"text":"This place was great! A group of us were in Montreal a couple of weeks ago for Osheaga and we went to Wienstein and Gavino's on our first night in the city. I love the decor, there's outdoor seating, 2 floors with tons of space, very accommodating staff (especially for a group of 12 who made a reservation 30 min before we arrived) and the food and drinks were great! A little bit over-priced for smaller portions, but we expected that. Our server was awesome! We'll definitely return the next time we're in the city."}
{"text":"The food was not bad but nothing to die for either. Menu wise its a regular Italian restaurant with marked up prices and nothing special.  The location is great. If visiting as a tourist and want to experience Rue Crescent street, you can just be seated outside and spend time enjoying the crowded street view with Italian food and wine."}
{"text":"C'est un restaurent tellement beau et qui sert vraiment de la bonne bouffe italienne. J'y suis allé 2 fois plutôt qu'une et j'en redemande. L'atmosphére est génial et chaleureuse. Il faut dire que le service est très rapide et très courtois, les serveurs travail super bien et mérits totallement leurs pourboires. Si vous voulez manger à votre faim et payer un prix trés raisonable je vous conseil ce resto sans aucun problème vous allez passer un bon moment. Il faut juste trouver une place de stationnement et n'hésitez pas a reserver à l'avance le resro est souvent rempli de client."}
{"text":"Sadly, 2 stars for food but 5 for service. We sat on the patio and both ordered a pasta dish with Alfredo sauce. It was wallpaper paste with zero seasoning. I added a ton of pepper, salt and even threw in the yummy pesto / olive oil dip for bread, to no avail. Gummy and gross. We headed inside for 'just one more drink' and ended up staying 4+ hours. Service, again, was exceptional (patio and bar). Maybe just an off night (Friday) for the busy kitchen?"}
{"text":"We went to Weinstein and Gavino's on a Friday night dinner after a long day of travel. The staff was very friendly, there was an excellent bar selection including wine list, and the pasta & pizza were excellent made with fresh ingredients. The atmosphere and clientele we're professional and sophisticated.  There was one HUGE drawback in what would have been a perfect moderately priced casual bistro; the noise. We had to scream at one another in order to communicate. The noise was so intense the waitress got one of our orders wrong as she could barely hear the order. She profusely apologized. Furthermore, she stated that noise was a common complaint. Not since attending a One Republic concert in a domed stadium have I experienced such deafening noise. There is club music playing in the background that if it was turned 10db lower it would be appropriate. However, people have to yell over the beats which creates a building escalated volume with horrible acoustics.   After having my ears ring and a horse throat from screaming, we cut the experience short. It's a shame as the restaurant has a great formula for success that is ruined by what I consider to be a serious risk to permanent hearing loss."}
{"text":"We stumbled on W&G after our concierge told us Rue Cresecent was a good place to look for dinner.  The whole area seemed pretty touristy and more of a bar scene than good food, but W&G looked pretty good.  Service was good, the menu had a nice selection.  I had a pasta dish with chicken.  It OK.  nothing special but decent.  The Risotto was excellent though.  Bread before the meal was good too.  Overall, probably a good place to grab some good food before hitting the bars or if you are in the area, but not worth traveling to or going out of your way for a meal."}
{"text":"We were visiting Montreal for a couple of days and our hotel recommended this restaurant. First, I will say that the restaurant is located on a lovely street with outdoor seating. We opted to sit indoors to experience the interesting decor. We were greeted by our waiter, Henry. He was very friendly and he helped me decide which wine to choose by giving us samples to try. He brought an unbelievably good pesto to the table for dipping with some bread. The pesto was so authentic and good that we ate it up, in what seemed like, a split second. Henry said, not to worry, he would keep it coming. All three of us enjoyed our entrees. They were large tasty servings. When we finished the meal and on our way out of the restaurant we were greeted Joel, the manager. He was very friendly and funny, and asked if we enjoyed our meals. We told him that the pesto and entrees were delicious. We chatted with him and had a few laughs. We would definitely return to this restaurant for the excellent service, food and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Delicious food, great price.  Pints could be a bit cheaper, but $10 Pizza or Pasta from 11am-3pm is a steal."}
{"text":"Weinstein & Gavinos was a true disappointment during our lunch. Which took me by surprise, considering I've been eating there for the last ten years.  Our lunch was such a disappointment, that could easily been avoided. Did they change owners? Chefs? If they did. The poor quality showed in our meals.  The hostess, was polite but little to no enthusiasm.  Our waiter.. Poor service. He did not speak clear, was often in a rush(the restaurant had only  six tables with average of 2-3 people per table. This is at 12:30pm, while the restaurant has well over 20 tables.  My steak salad was simply unacceptable! The steak was incredibly salty, over cooked, dried and tough! Did not taste fresh at all. I understand meat is not their specialty, but if you put it on your limited lunch menu. Learn how to properly cook it please!  Due to my poorly lack of taste salad, I was offer to choose something else on the menu instead. Which I did.  I choose a Caesar salad. Which I've been informed of being delicious. I guess not!  It was a simple mix of lettuce, a few overly salty croutons with two Parmesan shavings. While all this was drenched in a store bought overpowering taste of garlic salad dressing. I chose to add mozzarella Fior di latte(Fresh mozzarella) $5.00 for just two slices?!   May I add that my meal included a vegetable and barley soup. Thank you for the generous amounts of vegetables. Yet I again did not appreciate how salty it was! Salty should be used to bring out the flavour of something, not to make it taste simply like salt. Again something as simple as soup, was disappointing!  My friend's salad which was suppose to have mixed greens, oranges etc. It had very little of everything and freshness was not there at all either. Did they use a mix of greens that come in a bag already premix?! In every salad, freshness and taste is key! It simply was not there. Yes, the cost of my meal was taken care by the restaurant. Great! Thank you. Yet, where is the apology from the waiter? Who simply took the dish away. Disappointing yet again. Yes, the tip we left was low, when the bill was only $12.00. The waiter never said thank you or goodbye upon my friend and I leaving the restaurant. What happen to manners?  Sad that our lunch was this disappointing. Next time, I will think twice of going back."}
{"text":"Beautiful food and restaurant. they give ya food for days and days!  I got the deelish risotto (they have multiple risottos).  the service was great too."}
{"text":"The restaurant was a bit too dark to fully enjoy our company but I didn't find the music overbearingly loud like some yelpers.  I think the atmosphere is very sports-bar/beer garden esque but with a family-friendly menu and romantic lighting? Haha, it wanted to be everything! The portions were quite large so our group of 8 split 5-6 items and the staff were very accommodating.  The drinks were great and we left with some recommendations on where to head for nighttime dancing.  The restaurant is conveniently located along the strip of clubs/bars so it was very easy for us to get around."}
{"text":"We took a weekend trip to Montreal for my brother's bachelor party. The concierge at out hotel recommended Weinstein and Gavino's to us. We were a large group of 22, but they had no problem accommodating our group.  Everything was GREAT. We sat on the top floor and got a nice view. Our waiter, Tomi (sp? he was Croatian) was excellent. The guy busted his butt for 22 people without a busboy helping him and did a wonderful job.  All of our appetizers and entrees were amazing.  Most of our group got the osso buco (veal) and the risotto del pescatore for entrees.  I ordered the fried calamari (very tasty) and the risotto del pescatore.  We all had a round of Jameson shots for a toast, and at the end of the night, Tomi gave us all another round on the house, which was very classy of him.  After we finished dinner, we went downstairs for some drinks. The bartenders were extremely friendly, and gave us recommendations to go at night (which we used).  I highly recommend Weinstein and Gavino's to anyone, Montreal natives and tourists alike."}
{"text":"Love the pasta and salads! Beautiful terrace in the summer! I would definitely try it if you're in the downtown area."}
{"text":"I enjoyed this restaurant very much.  At the beginning they bring you some complementary homemade bread with some olive oil/pesto to dip it in.  Yummy yummy.  I ordered the gnocchi with a pesto sauce.  It was some of the best gnocchi I've ever had.  There was a TON of it as well.  I couldn't finish it all.  I will definitely go back there again when I'm back in Montreal."}
{"text":"Mixed menu with Italian and Mediterranean. Good outside terrace great for people watching in the Summer. Food is fair and prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"There was a lot of hype about this place upon my arrival and I must say that everything was average. It is a huge facility and judging by the rate and speed which the tables turned over, this restaurant was about volume. Very loud ambience although the decor was very nice. Food was fine but not spectacular. I had the Fitello de Manzo which was nice and tender but the sauce was made from a demi-glace powder and was really over bearing. Being and Italian place I expected a great wine list. Again average at best. Featured Italian wines were Bolla, Australian was Yellow Tail- you can see what I mean. I ordered a glass of the premium Chianti, I Mori, and it arrived warm and filled to the top. If you are going with a group of friends, business colleagues, then great. Going for an authentica Montreal/Italian culinary experience then go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Excellent.  I could not find anything to improve.  The service was superb and the steak was excellent. Large wine selection. The location, especially during the Formula One weekend, couldn't be more centrally located. I recommend adding this to your to do list."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good, while not the greatest. Liked the lasagna (3.5-4/5), shrimp pasta was okay, arrabiata good but a little uninspired, good bread and pesto, didn't like the Parmesan the second time we went. Would go back."}
{"text":"Its an OK , but doesn't measure up to New York Italian restaurants , risotto was undercooked and the chicken parm was dry"}
{"text":"Honestly I have always loved this place.  Their risottos are always amazing and the diverse me u let's anyone enjoy themselves.  The service has been a bit poor st times but is still a great place.  Order anything and you will have a great upscale-casual dining experience."}
{"text":"My husband and I used to be regulars here many years back when we were dating. We went back during Grand Prix for old times and realized how much we used enjoy this place, be it summer or winter. During summers they have 2 terraces to be enjoyed with a pitcher of their sangria (sadly for me there's no sun late afternoon). I'm picky when it comes to sangria and these ones are one of my favourites on a hot summer afternoon! Their happy hour (at the bar only) lasts from 4-8pm, 2 for 1 rail drinks and most beers as well as their house wine. At their prices you can't go wrong! It's a 2 floor restaurant right in the heart of downtown with a great evening vibe for all ages.  Service is always good, except when you run into a newbie. Then again I may be biased, we were such regulars there that we had our own waiter and bartender.  My favourites there are the pizzas and the basil pesto cream gnocchi! Oh and if you still have some space... their tiramisu is definitely worth trying!"}
{"text":"Huge italian resto located in downtown. Came here several times. They give fresh warm bread with pesto dip as a starter which is a big plus. The portions of their plates are huge. The best dishes ive had so far is the fried calamari and the mussels. The octopus is pretty good also. Their pasta and pizza come in many varieties. U can also choose the type of pasta u want. however, their fish is a bit dry and i wouldnt recommend that.   The service is pretty good. The dishes come quickly and they always come refill our bread."}
{"text":"Came here in March while on a weekend getaway from Toronto.  Made last minute reservations, so it wasn't planned at all.  I really didn't know what to expect, but I knew it was a huge restaurant.  Personally, I'm not a fan of big restaurants, but I'm a huge fan of W&G now.  Ordered the calamari to start.  Some of the best calamari I've had.  The portion is big, so I'd really recommend it for 3-4 people minimum.    For my main, I ordered the shrimp risotto...and wow! This was 4 months ago and I still think about that Risotto.  Perfectly cooked risotto swimming with jumbo shrimp.  Perfect meal!  Loved it!  Since the restaurant was so big, and busy...I was expecting it to be hard to get good service, but our server came by once in a while to check in on us.  Not too often, but just often enough to refill our glasses from the wine sitting on ice.  The only problem, like I've said, is the size of this place.  It can be hard to navigate to find a washroom, and there are so many tables, can get crowded.  These servers are magicians being able to serve so many people....and do it so well.      Great service, great food.  I'm 100% coming back."}
{"text":"This place is stuck in an identity crisis. It really can't decide whether it wants to be a bar, a lounge, a club, a chain restaurant or an upscale restaurant. So W&G decides it will do all of the above. Because of this, I was a bit hesitant to enter (as you can imagine this place was a big hot mess), however thanks to my \"seriously snotty about food\" friend we entered at our own risk. And let me just say, I had a pretty damn good time! We made an attempt to sit at the bar and moved several times because of the unbelievably loud sound system blasting dance music. For a second i thought the entire place was going to be lifted up on hydraulics! Once we settled we had a few ordinary drinks which were fine, but free shots were great!   Once we had enough of the nightclub/bar/lounge, we decided to stay for al fresco dining. This was a dream to my ears as it was outside and away from the noise. We had the Osso Buco over buttery pasta (excellent, although I thought the pasta was a bit overcooked) and Mussels in curry broth (good, although not hot enough for me). The place has a great mix of people, no pretension and something for everyone since this place tries to please everyone by having multiple personalities.  Good times."}
{"text":"I went there the day before Montreal marathon to get my fill of carbs. At that time I did not live in Montreal so I looked for reviews and a place that would be safe for gluten free eaters. A few of my friends had mentioned that it is a big place and good for groups and that I could be disappointed because I like more intimate places. However I really enjoyed the place and the food and also our waiter was very aware of gluten sensitivity which made my experience a great one and ensured a safe meal. Even though there were many groups that night, the restaurant is laid out on several floors and our table was not in the middle of them. I took a simple pasta dish as I was running the next day but would go back for trying other italian fares, now that, 2 years later, I live in Montreal."}
{"text":"Laarv and her companion searched Crescent Street for the perfect dinner spot.  We were in the mood for something simple but delicious and not over priced.  Well, we found the simple when we stepped foot into Wienstein & Gavino's.  Laarv was served a \"Mama Celeste\" pizza and was told it was a mahgarita pizza.  Laarv's companion ordered a greyhound.  Our waitress was confused and brought him something that was not even close to a greyhound.  Wrong juice, wrong glass.  Mixed drinks were cheap, now we know why.  Laarv left unsatisfied."}
{"text":"Attending a work halloween party here! Had loads of fun!   Music was great! It was hard staying seated! You just wanted to get up and start dancing!   Service was really good! The wait staff and hostess were incredibly nice!   Didn't have to wait long for the food! I ordered Chicken (can't remember which one though)! It was delicious and really fresh! It came with spaghetti on the side! It was really fulfilling!  I can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Italian certainly wasn't my first thought when visiting Montreal, but W&G proved to be a worthwhile endeavor.  The restaurant is large (two floors), yet has a surprisingly cozy aesthetic. The menu offered a great variety of options with room to customize. I ordered an off-menu linguine in white clam sauce and wasn't disappointed at all! The pasta is fresh but the linguine was thicker than expected. Flavor of the food is terrific and the bread is served with Pesto (very exciting)!  I found the service to be a bit off. Our waiter wasn't very attentive and kind of grunted responses to us. He did accommodate when I asked for a non-menu item but was just generally not very gracious or kind. We also waited nearly 20 minutes for our check after asking. There just wasn't much urgency, but it isn't anything to hold against the restaurant. Would go back for the food, in hopes of getting better service!"}
{"text":"This was one of those places that McGill students had their parents take them for dinner during university while I attended there several years ago.  On a recent visit to Montreal, I brought my husband there to see if it was still as good as I remember.  It was. Pasta was fresh, menu as extensive as ever, bread and oil dipping sauce delicious.  The place is huge and we were seated right away, even on a busy night.  A good place to go for good italian food downtown."}
{"text":"Good place to eat when you are in the neighborhood. This place is huge, very good for large parties. Lot of options to order. Good quality of food with nice and welcoming staff."}
{"text":"All around a pretty terrible experience at this place and if it weren't for the fact that some others in my party actually liked their food, it would be getting a 1 star from me. To frame it up, came here for a work dinner this evening, I didn't pick the place and actually showed up about 15 min late so by the time I arrived everyone had a drink and had ordered already. No worries, I take a min and order a drink and my food but from there everything starts to go downhill pretty quick. To sum up:  - I immediately notice a coworker who ordered a Negroni get his drink and it wasn't even 3/4 full in a rocks glass, plenty of ice though, ok whatever. - I ordered the Osso Bucco when I showed up late, yet somehow was the very first one to get their food, yet someone who ordered a salad funny enough ended up getting his food halfway into my own meal... - Which I must say, was quite the chore. This was BY FAR the toughest tasting veal shank I've ever tasted. Nothing fell off the bone, not a single bite was what you'd consider tender. To put simply, it was dry as sand and was like chewing on leather. My jaw legit ached after eating it. If it wasn't for the fact that I was pretty hungry and the sauce was a tiny redeemer I would've given up after a few bites. This thing easily should've been in the slow cooker for at least another 4 hrs, terrible for something that's 28CAD and on the higher end of the menu. - My own drink (an old fashioned) came out only 3/4 full as well, yet was piled to the brim with ice, at least it was decently stiff.  - My coworkers 2nd and 3rd orders of Negroni came out EVEN LESS that before, we're talking barely half a rocks glass full, with a ton of ice piled in. - I had to ask 2 different ppl 3 times to get a glass of water. - After we got our food and the waitress came around exactly once to ask if anyone wanted drinks (at which point completely ignoring I had no more water left), she never came around again other than to take dishes and run off. Never even had a chance to get another drink, which I guess in a way is a blessing in disguise based on what we'd witnessed.  Incredibly disappointing and for a downtown area chock full of restaurants you can be damned sure I'm passing this one by in the future."}
{"text":"Wienstein & Gavino's ist ein typischer \"Hipster Laden\", sehen und gesehen werden ist hier angesagt. Der Aufbau der Ladens ist echt cool, auf drei unterschiedlichen Ebenen, Unten eher Bar, die Mitte irgendwie die Mitte ;) und oben ein großer Restaurant Bereich. Über die komplette Breite des Laden zieht sich im Mittleren Teil die Küche, von oben kann man dem Werkeln der Köche schön zusehen. Das Essen war wirklich lecker und super frisch. Warum nur drei Sterne, wenn bis jetzt alles positiv war? Der Service ist eine Katastrophe, wir hatten einen Kellner, der unglaublich verpeilt und überfordert war. Gefühlt war er für 20 Tische verantwortlich und ist gnadenlos abgesoffen. Wir haben ca. 20 min auf die ersten Getränke gewartet und das zog sich durch den ganzen Abend. Wer viiiiel Zeit hat sollte sich den Laden unbedingt mal anschauen und ich drücke die Daumen, das er einen besseren Kellner als wir erwischt."}
{"text":"I had the Salsiccia Italiana and the Margherita Pizza at Weinstein & Gavino's. The sausage antipasti was a nice portion but wasn't too impressive and the pizza was quite a bit disappointing.   The place has nice service and vibe to it, and the fresh bread and pesto they give at the beginning is good too. Besides that pretty meh!"}
{"text":"Ate outside and it was quiet enough.   The thing with the food is that it isn't blow your mind awesome... But it's good none the less and you get your bang for your buck.   We ordered the meatball appetizer expecting mini portions but they came out huge. I had a risotto that had quite the deep dish and my companions had the mix_n_match pasta and sauce dishes. Everything was quite good.   Server forgot my soup but I was really full and nearly forgot myself. It was only okay but the bread was excellent too.   Will return."}
{"text":"Food was really good. Has risotto with shrimp, calamari and lobster. Friends also enjoyed their food. Loved the pesto and bread that they had in the beginning of the meal. Service was a little slow or otherwise it would have been a four star"}
{"text":"LOVE this place.   This is hands down the best spot in the city of MTL to get some amazing fresh pasta. The noodles are homemade the same day and the sauces are full flavoured and always seasoned well.  I find the prices are very fair, and they have some great wine choices. They serve fresh baguette with a delicious olive oil and fresh basil- just this alone is worth going for!   The atmosphere is awesome, great vintage Italian vibe. They can accommodate large groups or small. Went there with a group of 20 and it went very smooth.  I love making my own Italian food, and this is the only restaurant I can go to who make it better than I do!  Awesome spot"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Great food.   Not from around here, so I can't speak for the locals, but it was enjoyed by these 10 guys from out of town.  Ask to get a seat on the 3 rd floor to look over crescent st."}
{"text":"Let's be honest - the patio is a major attraction here, putting you right into the street action. The menu is pretty good, too, offering a good selection of Italian fare. Our service was very good - professional and friendly. The wine list has a good selection of Italian wines so you should be able to find something you like on the list. We started with the soup of the day - mushroom - which was excellent. Their version contained herbs to add a garden flavour to the earthiness of the mushrooms. I had the special, which was risotto with prosciutto, peas, caramelized onions and chopped hazelnuts - terrific! The combination of flavours was excellent, but the one drawback was the risotto was a little too dry, it was almost a pilaf. My friend had the veal chop special which was also very good, nicely flavoured, but once again, cooked a little too long. For dessert, he had the almond and rum brownie with ice cream. While very tasty, the brownie was so hard he actually bent the spoon trying to cut it. Nice place, I would consider coming back again, especially for the patio."}
{"text":"Honestly, I've never written one of these... but after last night I felt that I needed to tell the world how awful this place is.  I went with my boyfriend and thought \"hey, cool design, specialized menu, should be good!\" I was wrong.   Probably because I'm Italian and grew up eating really good Italian food, but this is crap. I had the speck pizza. It was dry, overly salty and sort of all-around gross. He had the Alfredo with spaghetti. Where do I even start? The pasta was hard- no. not al dente. Way undercooked. The sauce was lumpy with bits of cooked eggs in it and tasted like jarred sauce with eggs and butter added... Not good.  The ambience was cool and the wait staff while very friendly, had no idea what anything on the menu was. We had two simple questions (What kind of cheese is on the pizza and what was the soup of the day) both of which he blatantly said he didn't know and would get back to us.. never did.  If you're going for drinks, hell yes! The drinks were fun and the ambience is great, so it really is ideal for 5 a 7 with friends, but this place SUCKS as a resto. Will not be returning, at least not for dinner."}
{"text":"This place was recommended by the hotel staff- we probably wouldn't have chosen it ourselves, just walking by.  That being said- I can see why they would have recommended it- nice decor, nice wine list (not a lot of by the glass options though), young hip crowd, close by... probably seemed like our kinda place.  When we went we were seated quickly, but that was about the only thing that was quick.  There was a party of 8 attractive women, a table of 2 attractive women, and another of 4 others that were half-good-looking surrounding us, a couple.  Our male waiter seemed more concerned with those around us...  The bread came and was delish! (what a french baguette should be- crusty on the outside, but warm & soft on the inside).  We munched on that... I waited forever for my glass of wine... which wouldn't have been a big deal, except I'm normally gluten free, so this huge hunk of delicious bread sitting in front of me, taunting me... not a good thing.  Normally, I'm fine watching people around me eating delicious food that I don't.. but that's when I'm drinking.  So, yeah...  My salad came- flavorless & oil-covered.  I would have loved some pepper... was never asked.  Food came, and it was pretty good.  Had one of the specials, risotto, and I definitely enjoyed it.  It was way more food than I could finish.  He had the chicken ripieno- instead of it being filled, the filling was just on top... but he enjoyed it.  Misleading name.  Despite neither of us being able to finish our entrees, we did order the tiramisu for desert.  It was good, but not life changing (as described to one of the tables around us).  Overall, food was good, but definitely over-priced.  Even though our actual waiter wasn't particularly attentive or nice, the girl who brought most of our food to us was quite friendly.  I hope he tips her well... she definitely makes up for his lack of service.  The music here is WAAAAAY too loud for a restaurant... and it's too clubby.  This place was confusing... seemed conflicted.  Are we a nice restaurant or a club?  One plus- There was a hilarious drunk woman in a super short dress who loved dancing... so even though we were just sitting there a lot, we were entertained."}
{"text":"One of the oldest restaurant on Crescent street. I have been here many many times. Never been disappointed.  Excellent service from the host to the waiter.   Got bread with pesto; the pesto left me a bitter aftertaste. I got Mac N Cheese with lobster. A heavy dish due to the creaminess. The taste was average. My sister got the 1/2 chicken with salad and fries. She devoured her whole dish.   Overall, it's an excellent spot for big parties. It has always has great vibe. Great choice of music in the background."}
{"text":"Good place with excellent menu choices and wonderful & friendly wait service."}
{"text":"I visited Montreal about three days after I was told I have Celiac so just wanted to give the two restaurants who actually had accommodations for me a shout-out. They have a gluten free penne and I believe there was a GF spaghetti as well. Also was told meatballs were GF as well (just make sure they don't bring it out wit the little crispy bread garnish on it!) - got GF penne with pesto.. so good! Super full after"}
{"text":"I was so grateful for the service my boyfriend and I encountered during dinner. My boyfriend is wheelchair bound, and although the business doesn't have an accessible entrance, they do have a ramp available (we called ahead and asked, which I would recommend for any future handicapped guests). The staff was awesome and helpful from beginning to end. The food was awesome, super fresh pasta and the cocktails were great. A completely delightful experience!! I would highly recommend this one!"}
{"text":"My best friend and I had not intended to go to Weinstein's & Gavinos for dinner, but we happened upon the establishment because the reception desk at our Hotel recommended the place because his friend Zeb was the bartender there. We arrived and was able to get a good spot at the bar and ordered our drinks (me a glass of wine and he a glass of Jack & Diet Coke) and the Jack was very jacked up - which many would consider a good thing if you wanted lots and lots of alcohol. We had pleasant company with a local who was there that night enjoying a drink and chatting up the bartender who also hooked us up with a free shots and we knew if we sat there, we'd get more free shots.  There is a pasta factory in the back and you can see into the kitchen if you sat upstairs. The sound system was a bit loud and we ended up having dinner outside in the front. It was raining but they have a canopy set up so that you have the option of sitting outside without getting wet. It was a Friday evening between 10 - midnight that we were there. We ordered the Osso Bucco over buttered spaghetti and the Steamed Mussels in Curry broth as our starter. We felt the portions were big enough to share which we were right. They also bring you out a fresh warm baguette to dip in pesto and Olive Oil. Overall, our experience was surprisingly pleasant and our bill with 1 main, 1 appetizer and two drinks totalled $50. The only drawback is, that if you're not a smoker, understand that sitting outside will subject you to other people smoking."}
{"text":"I went to this resto with my friend looking for a quick lunch. This place is really nice inside and they have so many wine bottles they need ladders to get to the top shelves! Definitely do not want to be in this resto during an earthquake! I ordered grilled octopus because it's not something I eat everyday. Before the meal comes, the waiter brings us a baguette with a plate of pesto! Yummmm every resto should do this!! Our waiter was really nice and even brought us a second baguette after we chowed through our first one.... I'm a sucker for bread, it might be a problem ;) The octopus was really yummy and served over fennel, onions, capers and white beans... The only hitch was that it was quite oily and it was a hell of a job to fit everything on your fork without anything falling off on the way to your mouth! Overall, good service, good meal, good environment, not too pricey and the service was quick! :)"}
{"text":"Swung by after work for happy hour. It's 2 for 1 from 4-8pm. Great atmosphere and friendly service."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of big restaurants because they tend to produce lower quality food since there are so much staff involved. That' s just my opinion. Wienstein and Gavino's is REALLY huge....two floors with a HUGE kitchen! I came here for a friend's birthday yesterday and I was not impressed. My pasta was overwhelmed with sauce...i ordered a prosciutto, mushroom linguini. And there was too much sauce! It was heavy, it made me sleepy and too full too fast. Pasta is not meant to be drenched in sauce, you are supposed to taste the sauce AND the pasta. I hardly tasted the pasta but more the sauce. My boyfriend's pizza was very generic. Just plain with cheese and tomatoes...nothing special. Don't get me wrong, service was very attentive and decent, but food just didn't impress me. I didn't like the atmosphere as well...it was too noisy and I had to yell so many times to talk to someone who was even next to me. It was more of a bar atmosphere. I dont mind that but I don't like to eat dinner in that kind of atmosphere. Don't think I would go again."}
{"text":"Warm candlelight and freshly made pasta called out to me on a freezing Monday night in Montreal.  This place hit the spot.  The wine was delish, the bread was fresh and served with a tasty pesto oil dip, the portobello mushroom pasta was just right and the tunes were funky.  Service was attentive and wireless worked well. Got some stuff done and got myself all fed up. (:"}
{"text":"The main appeal of W&G is that it's the perfect place for a birthday dinner. It's fancy-ish, there's plenty of room, and the price is somewhat decent. The decor is really nice: you've got impressive chandeliers and nice vibes. The food itself is alright (you can't really mess up pasta) but not particularly memorable. If I had a big group, I would definitely bring them to W&G!"}
{"text":"Bon service mais probablement un des pires repas que j'ai mangé. Mon risotto devait contenir au moins 5 cuillères à soupe d'huile."}
{"text":"One of my fave spots here. Very italian, very lively...and the decor and brick walls are really breathtaking. Awesome for a romantic dinner or large groups/parties. This place is huge, too. Check out their site for pics of their wine selection- omg! Wonderful food that fills you up quickly. We were a very roudy bunch that night- it was so much fun- even the waiter was going along with it!"}
{"text":"\"I thought midi-chicken meant half a chicken breast or something.\"   First off the portions here are huge! The look on my friend's face when he saw half a chicken being brought towards his direction was pretty priceless. The waiter who served us was super friendly and had quite the sense of humour also. The fries at this place are pretty amazing too. I don't know if it's the seasoning or the way they fry it, but whatever witchcraft it is they're doing behind the kitchen, it's pretty darn good. Another thing is that I love is how they serve the food when it is still hot and fresh. Everything came pretty quickly and for the great price, the food tastes even better."}
{"text":"Been there many times before. Love the homemade loaf of crusty bread and Pesto. I ordered the lasagna and without disappointment. The portion was perfect! I ended my dinner with a cappuccino as always. Great family place and everything on the menu is pretty good. Will return.."}
{"text":"After being BS'd by Le Warehouse for 45 min we decided to try our luck here. Staff was extremely friendly and fun. Everyone tried the various selections of pizza without complaint. Good spot to fill your belly before heading out."}
{"text":"Good food, great service and \"local flavor\" - recommended..."}
{"text":"Italian comfort food at its finest in a casual but upscale environment. My family recently enjoyed a trip to Montreal and we indulged in lots of haute cuisine. On our last night we just wanted a nice big meal (you know how some of the very high end restaurants can leave you hungry due to small portions). We actually canceled our dinner reservations at a very high end restaurant and opted to come here instead for some down to earth food. The restaurant is gigantic and we didn't have to wait to be seated. We enjoyed the free hot bread and pesto/olive oil dip along with a Caesar salad, caprese salad, osso bucco, spaghetti carbonara, and fettuccine with vodka sauce. The service was very friendly and attentive. We did not feel rushed in any way. We left feeling full and happy. I highly recommend it for a casual but delicious meal with great service."}
{"text":"Très belle endroit d'extérieur comme d'intérieur avec un bar énorme au Rez de chaussé et espace restaurant sur une belle mezzanine .  Restaurant italien donc ma femme et moi même prenons des pâtes, ce n'est pas le meilleur restaurant italien que j'ai pu faire sur Montréal mais les plats sont corrects ne vous en faite pas.  Point négatif le service qui est très long peux être parce que nous étions un groupe je ne sais pas mais vraiment long entre l'apéritif et notre plat . Après l'addition ne fut pas énorme pour 2 personnes avec apéritifs et plats .  Apparement les 5 à 7 sont parfait au bar donc je reviendrais tester pour vous dire ;)"}
{"text":"In town on business and was recommended by a friend!  Sat at the bar had an excellent three-course meal for $23! Canadian!! I have to say I was a little bit reserved but the bartender Dave pushed the three-course special back at me and he said this is excellent not to pass it up!  And I agree 100%!!   I had the bruschetta and the fish option,  (I can't remember the name) White flaky fish but very good!"}
{"text":"We ordered 5 different pastas for the 6 of us. The pastas were fine. The service were bad, our waiter inattentive."}
{"text":"Perfect food. Nice place. Great service. I always judge a place with a good eggs florentine, they passed with flying colours."}
{"text":"Mmm...one of my favorite dining destinations in Montreal. In the heart of the action - great wine lists and a beef carpaccio to DIE FOR!  Yes, I realize it's a little touristy but it's great! Never had a bad time here!"}
{"text":"Came here years ago, didn't recognise the interior this time. How things change. We came in at 2:00 PM on Sunday, got seated, the waitress took our beverage orders, served and then we waited for our food orders. My poached eggs in \"inferno\" sauce were good, came with 2 pieces of crusty toasted Italian bread, rosemaried pan fried potatoes, and a spiced baked apple and baked orange slices. The sauce was basically your standard tomato sauce, spiced, with a few veggies, the eggs were well poached, overall the dish was good. Olive oil is on the table for your convenience/preference, srevice was a bit on the slow side, even though the clientele was tapering off. I had to ask for a coffee refill, wait staff could be a tad more attentive. Came back the following week and this time the wait was even longer, despite the fact that again, the place was not that busy. The waiter was unaware that merguez sausage is NOT made with pork! Perhaps an cultural/culinary education for the wait staff is in order? Overall a very average resto."}
{"text":"Listen, the food here is quite frankly below mediocre. But when you don't know where to eat and it's a Thursday night during summer weather and want a terrace, you work with what you get.   Essentially, you're paying for the vibes and views of Crescent street, not the taste or quality of the food. The portions are large but the food is ridiculously bland. The best part was the complimentary baguette with pesto!! The red sangria was good and the service was fine.  I got the mushroom truffle and white wine pappardelle pasta because silly me, I've had mind blowing similar dishes at Italian restos. It was SO BLAND. Also, I love mushrooms but I don't like the ones they use - they chop them so largely that they become too slimy and chewy. The gigi sauce is better but no one was impressed.  The dessert was actually disgusting. WORST tiramisu everrrr - so gummy and nasty. Just don't put it on the menu if it's that bad!!!  Would I go back? Only if I wanted some sangria on a terrace. *Tip: I've been before and their pizzas are way better than their pastas."}
{"text":"Average Italian dishes in a refined and convivial atmosphere on Rue Crescent. Lovely patio with people-watching potential, however, the wines by the glass are overpriced. Beer selection is average. Not a bad choice for families with children, although this does detract a little bit from the New York-meets-Hollywood mystique the place is attempting to cultivate. Pizzas are ok, with good crispy crust. Service is good. More American than Canadian."}
{"text":"Ordered pasta. Was delicious. The price is reasonable comparing to the food. The place is nicely decorated. Good experience overall."}
{"text":"Why is it ok for 2 girls to be harassed and touched and accosted at 5pm in Montreal? Get your act together #wienstein&gavinos! After repeatedly told to LEAVE US ALONE these pervents continued to harass and touch but it was just fine because they're regulars and pay '$500 a night in tips'. Really? REALLY?! Get some class! I regret not making a huge scene and getting the Montreal police in there. 2 thumbs down! It just disgusts me! Do NOT dine here. You should be shut down for allowing this kind of behaviour to happen!  And please read my previous reviews. This is an honest review."}
{"text":"I have to start this off right - I had the best pizza I have had in North America at Wienstein & Gavino's. It was quattro fromaggi (I believe - four cheese nonetheless) and was one of my most fantastic food experiences ever.  Sitting on the terrace, enjoying my beers and conversation with a friend, we happened to get hungry and ordered up this pizza. I have a wheat allergy - however any discomfort resulting in the following week from this pizza were well worth it.  Our server was attentive without being annoying and socialized with us a bit, but not inappropriately he still tended to his other tables. It was a great experience and I would definately recommend this place."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant at least once every time I visited Montreal in the last five years. But I have never been impressed by the service here. The food is average at best given the price. The only reason tourists like me would still go there is because its location. It's close to my hotel. But if I ventured a bit east to the plateau,  I would have had a much better experience, whether or not the waiter/waitress spoke fluent English. Montreal is full of culinary adventures, W&G really needs to step up quite a bit to make it."}
{"text":"i had octopus with capers and somethin somethin for an appetizer.  it was quite lovely.  very flavourful.  the chicken parm for dinner was average.  nothing special other than it was humongous!  3 of us could have eaten it, (especially after my octo)  restaurant was nice, casual setting.  i didn't find it overly interesting, but cant complain. (much)  Takes Amex"}
{"text":"Great environment, service is good, have special meals every day. I ordered the Thursday special meal veau, too salty for me, but the amount is sufficient. Pizzas are great, others are just so so."}
{"text":"We chose this place because the patio atmosphere was good and they had space on a busy Sunday afternoon. We went for a pitcher of sangria, wanting to sit there awhile.They served some decent bread with a pesto dipping oil, which was quite good. I tried the prosciutto e arugula pizza, and it was really decent. This is a great spot to people-watch from, there are lots of bars and cafes around and lots of pedestrian traffic as well as drivers to entertain you.   I'm sure it can get pretty busy. I think this was pretty good value given the location and the service was not bad either."}
{"text":"This place is huge. Great busy atmosphere. Prices are excellent for what you get. I had their soup of the day (vegetable), Caprese salad - huge, Margherita pizza. Couldn't finish it as I wanted to save myself for the lemon sorbet- huge!  Excellent all around! BTW  Wait staff was very attentive."}
{"text":"Great resto-bar at the center of downtown. The personnel will make you keep coming back for more. The menu is larger than what I'm normally use too. However there few disappointments as its constantly being updated.  The staff is warm and hospitable. Which makes the night a pleasure for anyone. Go to the bar and be treated by the barmaids who are very easy on the eyes. Or be seated at a table and view the hard working staff.   I been going here for some time now with a dear friend. I don't see that changing anytime soon."}
{"text":"This place is good when you don't mind eating in a huuuuuge restaurant, so a pretty noisy place. If you're looking for a romantic atmosphere, this isn't the right restaurant. However, the food is good and I like the fact that they serve bread with pesto oil. The price is correct because you've a lot of food in your plate and it's good quality food. Plus, there's always someone asking if you need something and that's pleasant."}
{"text":"I met up with my boss in Montreal on a cold Sunday night and we were both hungry after already having travelled for a while. We were staying at the Delta Montreal on rue President Kennedy, and wanted some place lively but not requiring us to dress up. Our concierge suggested going on Crescent Street that has plenty of lovely restos and bars.  Out of all the restos we saw even still open (it was the first weekend of the year) Wienstein & Gavino's had the brightest lights and looked the most inviting. Although I did find the name bizarre.  We got a table no problem, (duh, late Sunday night) and sat upstairs, but for a cold night, there were still plenty of people there, mostly couples on dates and a slightly older crowd (35-40+) The food was delicious! We started with the bruschetta, and there was plenty of warm carbs being placed on our table and a self-serve balsamic vinegar and olive oil to accompany it. My boss enjoyed her pasta dish, as well as I enjoyed my penne with garlic and veggies. The taste was very fresh, since I am not a huge pasta fan, but I really liked my dinner. The service was impeccable too.  Afterwards, we enjoyed a glass of wine at the bar and the bartender was flirty, but nice and I could tell wanted to chit chat with us. It was an overall very pleasant environment, service and food!"}
{"text":"I don't eat italian food often because I'm really picky about it.  Since it was a warm saturday night, my family and I decided to try their terrace. When we arrived, they said we had to wait 30 minutes to get an outside table. My boyfriend pointed an empty table and they agreed to let us sit there if we stayed less than 1h30. Ok... the wine was good. The food was ok. Actually, the carbonara pasta I had was ok but the squid ink pasta my boyfriend got was pretty delicious. That's why I'm giving it 3 stars."}
{"text":"C'est sans réservation que nous y sommes présenté et on nous a trouvé rapidement de la place pour 7 adultes (un samedi soir 18:30 hrs). Le rapport qualité /prix est très bien. Pour avoir visité l'Italie récemment je dois dire que le repas et le service étaient très typiques de ce nous avons reçu lors du voyage.  Très Italien avec un petit côté nord-américain.  à éviter si vous chercher le Resto très romantique pour le repas tranquille en tête à tête. Excellent service et attentionné."}
{"text":"We visited on a Friday evening at around 7pm and this place looked filled - at least the terrace was. Inside though, there are 3 floors: not too many seats on the ground floor, but plenty on the 2nd and 3rd. The 2nd floor features a very good view of the kitchen, which is pretty cool, but can be pretty noisy and hot. The music seemed very loud on the ground floor, but on the 3rd floor, it was much quieter and easier to hold a conversation up there. They have an extensive drink list and a far smaller food menu. Their bread comes with pesto oil which is pretty neat. The soup of the day was a cream of asparagus and I do believe that in their stations, each one has bread, Parmesan cheese, pesto oil, salt and pepper, as well as the daily soup. Considering there are 3 floors to the establishment, I guess this is a way to speed things up. Our seat was wonderful, by the window, so that there was a breeze and some natural light streaming in. Service was okay, our server came by to check on us once and was fairly polite. Prices are relatively reasonable given that this area is slightly touristy. Even when we left at around 8:30pm, there were still plenty of tables, so I wouldn't say they get completely filled to capacity, given that they do have 3 floors of seating."}
{"text":"Came here in late september with my wife and two toddlers.  We'd been cruising up and down Crescent street trying to find a good place for lunch and found the unassuming entrance to W&G.  We entered and were surprised by how large it really is -- two big floors, a massive bar on the ground floor, plenty of seating on both. It was pretty empty on the second floor, which we were required to use because we had kids with us (not a problem at all but Montreal bar and restaurant kid regulations seem to be wildly disparate and confusing).  Totally dug the atmosphere in this place -- wood beams, tasteful decor, big windows.  Now if you've been cruising up and down Crescent Street for an hour with hungry gremlins in tow, you don't want to have to wait long for service.  We didn't.  Drink orders were secured promptly, then bread arrived with olive oil -- meltdown averted! The kids and I ordered pizza, the wife ordered something with salmon or a soup or a salad or something made up of all three (as she is prone to do). Food didn't take long at all.  OK, so we ordered pizza -- super adventurous right?  There was a very comprehensive menu, but hungry as we were, we went simple.  All pizza is not created equal, and this was superb -- homemade crust, crispy and chewy, a tangy marinara sauce, flavorful and fresh toppings, and just the right blend of cheeses.  Loved it.  After, in order to delay our trek back out onto Crescent street, we lingered over dirty martinis (wife and I), and chocolate desserts (gremlins).  Loved it.    Oh, I forgot to mention an excellent wine list!  So there's that as well.  We enjoyed this place and will be sure to return on our next Montreal adventure."}
{"text":"The service was great! The food as well! Even though I ordered one of their personal pies I shared with my family, everyone had different types of food. If I come back to Montreal, I def visit G&W again!"}
{"text":"we have ordered Sunday Special OSSO BUCCO (Milanese style braised veal shank, gremolata $28). today is 23 with a free glass with white/red wine your choice. It was worth every penny. 2nd, we ordered MISTO DI MARE (Lobster tail, mussels, clams, shrimp, scallops, tomato sauce, white wine $27) I love seafood but I am also allergenic. if it's not fresh, my body will have reaction. in addition, you can tell by the texture and smell of the seafood. I am sure you all know what I am talking about.  hands down it blew my mind away. It's the best linguine seafood pasta I ever had. The linguine was perfectly cooked. The waitress service was exceptoinal. Best of all, the price is very reasonable. I totally recommnad it."}
{"text":"Its a very nice restaurant with a lovely atmosphere, it can get noisy a bit but its not that bad. Food is great, the bread and pesto is excellent ( free too) the bruschetta is very tasty, had the pasta and a non-alcoholic drink, its a restaurant I will be going to very often :)"}
{"text":"Their pasta is made FRESH.. from scratch. How can you beat this? Their bread is warm and comes with olive oil and balsamic vinegar. Their house wine is always good. I always have a good time here.. So many reason for the 5 stars! Everytime I'm back in Montreal I make sure to come here. I have been here at least 30 times and have not once been disappointed. Their arabiatta is excessively spicy but they gave me a \"toned down\" version of it once I let them know ;)"}
{"text":"This rating is only for the atmosphere in the restaurant. I was literally drenched in sweat after coming out of the restaurant. The temperature was 34+ deg and the air conditioning was not working in the restaurant. This was the most uncomfortable good Italian cuisine I have had.  Everyone in the restaurant was complaining about the heat but nothing was done to fix it. Paying $80 for a dinner for 2 adults and a kid, I would except a good dining atmosphere.  Food was great. Everything was freshly made. The pasta melted in out mouth. 5 stars for the food."}
{"text":"Très ordinaire la pizza rien de Wow...en plus le serveur avec ses manières hautaine me dit que les fours  à certains endroits vont jusqu'à 2000° ...lol et que le prosciutto se mange seulement froid, une chance qu'il est italien . La meilleure pizza là-bas se mange soit disant à moitié froide et en plus c'était trop salé, comme une salade ou presque. Désolé mais je n'aime pas le concept. Le nom du restaurant est bien cool mais la nourriture est ordinaire et le staff aussi. Je ne vais pas y retourner ."}
{"text":"This was our first dinner stop in Montreal. The food was really good! The restaurant looks great - it's 3 floors so you might have a little treck like we did. The atmosphere was a little bit loud - we had to shout across our small table to talk to each other. I would go back for their pasta!"}
{"text":"I went here a couple of times and I am in love with the ambience and the location. The food however wasn't special, they played it very safe with the dish options and the taste was rather average.  I was extremely taken back by the service, the waiters were rather rude and it seemed like the customer's time had absolutely no value.   I would not recommend this restaurant to friends and family."}
{"text":"I went with my family to celebrate Mother's Day. I didn't know the place, I read about it in their Facebook advertising. We were greatly amazed by the place, the food and the attention. It is big, has terrace, prices are very affordable and the ambience is really nice. I totally recommend this restaurant and we are going to come back."}
{"text":"Like Yelps awesome description for each star ranking,this place is really just ''meh''.  Great place to JUST have drinks on the terrace during the warm summer days/nights.  Food: I mean, it's Italian food. There's really nothing 'that' great about it, and without tooting my own horn, I feel there's a lot of things on the menu that my friends and I could make. But yes, it is good.  Staff : Nothing special, but nothing bad neither.   Decor/ambiance : probably one of the good things of this place. It has a nice urban/old style to it.  LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION. This place is perfectly located on one of the most touristy streets in the city.   I'd take friends there only if we haven't made plans/reservations. It's acceptable."}
{"text":"I love the decor in this restaurant. The food is well above average. For a full bar, the beer list is a little lacking. This service was prompt yet not particularly friendly.   I definitely recommend a visit."}
{"text":"Great décor. Get a seat upstairs on the balcony for an amazing view of crescent street. Relatively cheap drinks, fresh hand made pizza."}
{"text":"While not the best Italian in the world, it was pretty decent.  The atmosphere and staff were very nice.  I was eating alone at the bar (on business) and enjoyed my meal.  I had the gnocchi with pomodoro sauce and it hit the spot.  The bread was great as well.  I would definitely go back"}
{"text":"Worst meal I've ever had. The service was bad and the flavors were horrible. Don't waste your time, go somewhere else"}
{"text":"It was nothing above average but the bread with pesto oil. I ordered the Montreal Table menu for $31.  The bread with pesto oil was soooo good! Definitely will try that at home too.  The starter was bread with fig and vinaigrette sauce. The fig was tasty but it felt like it needed more seasoning.  The main dish was beef ravioli. The cream sauce was way to thick and lacked seasoning. I had to put a lot of salt on there. The dessert was some pumpkin mousse. I have never been a big fan of pumpkin so I didn't really like it either.   Overall, average restaurant, I would give it a 2 star if it didn't have the bread."}
{"text":"Great service, great attitudes and phenomenal tasting chicken parmesan. The reason i gave it 4/5 was because i felt the seating was a bit odd -- they have two floors and we were seated upstairs when half the first floor was empty which made our waitress take a bit longer between trips. The grilled calamari and chicken parm were great generous portions as well as delicious. Highly recommend for brunch able to accommodate parties of all sizes."}
{"text":"I love almost everything about this place. It's decorated beautifully, the interior architecture is really nice, pretty exposed stone walls and nice dim lighting, and everyone who works here is sooo nice. Also (and I'm sure people will hate me for saying this but...) the place feels like you're in Toronto.  For starters, the pesto oil that they bring out with the bread before you order food, is very tasty and fresh. We ordered the paesana pizza and the duck confit risotto, and the tiramisu. The pizza was really good, and for a bigger contemporary style restaurant like this, it's still impressively authentic (thin crust Napoli style stone oven pizza)... The duck confit risotto was incredible. There were big chunks of duck confit in it and it wasn't fatty at all but perfectly rich and delicious and the duck confit flavour was really infused into the perfectly cooked risotto - the best risotto I've had in this city yet. I will definitely be looking forward to the next visit here to order it again - and for duck confit risotto it was very reasonably priced, I want to say cheap even, but let's just say, you can't go wrong if you order this dish.  The tiramisu was pretty good, but not authentic at all - but I'm very picky when it comes to tiramisu, and for me it was too thick/heavy.. It seems like the mascarpone cream was either mixed with a butter cream type of icing because it was very thick and very sweet but I still liked it - I wouldn't order it again though unless I was really craving it and didn't feel like making it myself.   We will definitely return for the pizza and I can't wait to go back for the risotto. I highly recommend this place for date night or a huge birthday party. Just go!"}
{"text":"Our service started out okay when we were the only patrons on the patio, but slowly dipped as soon as more people arrived (on a 7 table patio).   Our waiter was impatient from our first order and we sat between the clearing of our appetizer plates from even ordering our entree for a good 10 minutes.   After ordering our entrees, 5 minutes tops, I asked if I could change my pasta option for my entree and was told he would check, 10 minutes later he came back and said no can do. I'm very familiar with the restaurant business so this alone would not have been a count against the service but was still surprised how long it took him to check.   Our entree came and my daughter asked for more bread, he nodded and we waited for bread for the entire time. No mention that there was a table limit or he couldn't do it. We waited with our finished entrees for a good 15 minutes (no sight of the waiter despite a now filled patio) had to wave him down and then waited another 5 minutes at least. When he came with the check he cleaned our table with a dirty rag left the rag there and tended to another table and then came back to us to take care of our bill, leaving the dirty rag the entire time. As we were walking out we saw the manager, who had come out multiples times seeing impatient tables and did nothing, and told him our service was poor. He said it must have been a mistake and our server was the best they had, no apology and basically shooed us out and told us he didn't care.  Lastly, the food was mediocre at best. Definitely go someplace else."}
{"text":"We wandered into this place near St Catherine and Crescent early dinner hour. It is a clean, massive restaurant and there were a few tables filled. Service was good. Good with allergies.  We started with the complimentary baguette and pesto which was delicious.  We shared the Salumi plate which was okay. It had some pickled vegetables, fior de latte, Asiago, salami and a whole lot of mortadella. Generous size.  We also had: Kid's pepperoni pizza which was a good size Seafood risotto which was loaded with tiny scallops, not much lobster. It was good. The lasagna which was good but enormous with an obscene amount of cheese We brought home leftovers for all of the above."}
{"text":"to be clear: The stars are only for the vibes and decor of the place. The Crescent location is beautiful, spacious, and wonderfully decorated. I've come here for everything between large birthday party dinners with 15 guests to small family dinners, and every time the seating is great. No problem there.   The issue with this place is the food really. First thing they serve you is the usual bread with a pesto/oregano mix for you to dip, which tastes good because the bread is warm and who doesn't love pesto. But its all downhill from there... I've been here four times and every time I leave with a terrible stomach ache. The pastas are okay, the pizzas are dry, the appetizers are tasteless, the only thing that's acceptable to eat is the osso bucco pasta.   There are so many better places to eat in MTL. Maybe go there for the bar, but definitely not for the food. The hype and popularity of the place is so not worth it"}
{"text":"Not sure if this is a bar or restaurant . It's definitely a loud bar with food attached. So if quite dining is a must forget this place. The Omni suggested when I asked for casual Italian food . I definitely got casual. Personal size pizza was marginal at best . Wife's meal of grilled octopus was very good and worth getting again if I ever feel like getting a 17.50 scotch Manhattan . I should know better. To qualify as an Italian restaurant. Make sure the name if the place has an Italian name at Least."}
{"text":"Went here for a birthday celebration dinner and found it was lovely dining experience - place is on 3 floors (not great as washroom on bottom floor!) but food  and service great. Fairly busy on a Sun. nite and imagine if there was a hockey game it would be even busier! Great selection of Italian dishes. Staff brought a tiramisu (that I had ordered) with a sparkler in it and \"sang\" - the dessert was GREAT! Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Endroit sympa pour se retourner entre amis dans le centre-ville. La nourriture est bonne et les quantités adéquates. Petit bémol sur le service, car notre serveur était figé dans la cire (aucun sourire). Bref, une place sécuritaire pour un rendez-vous en ville."}
{"text":"Wienstein & Gavino's  has the best representation, presentation, and quality that I have ever experienced. Hands down the best  food and service. I recommend this restaurant to anyone who enjoys high quality food, wine, , and over the top service."}
{"text":"After almost a year, we decided to go eat in downtown Montreal.  I had always heard about Wienstein & Gavinos but never got the chance to go. Finally, I decided to check out this place. They started us of with a mini baguette with olive oil and pesto sauce. Which was a change from your normal butter and bread.  We ordered greek salad and grilled octopus. The salad was amazing, the tomatos were really tasty. The octopus was fresh with a nice vinaigrette. We ordered veal parmesan and rib eye steak as our main course. The veal was accompanied with a spaghetti pesto  topped with pine nuts. It melted in your mouth the only flaw  was it was a bit too salty for my taste. The steak was accomabied with a side salad and fries. It also raste amazing but again a bit salty for our taste. The waiter was very friendly and helpful with the menu. Ambiance was great, we were near the balcony which had great view of the street.  All in all it was a great night and I was really glad i tried it out, I will definitly be going back."}
{"text":"Great for groups, I can't believe how big this place is.  Some of the best pasta I've had -- made fresh from scratch.  Excellent service, too.  I can see why it was recommended by our concierge.  We were there for at least two hours and had a lot of fun.  The low reviewers need to relax."}
{"text":"I came here during the Montreal Grand Prix weekend. The service was excellent, the food was fantastic, the pasta phenomenal. It was a last minute dining choice, but a good one. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a hearty good meal. The bread starter with the pesto was great. We had the Osso Bucco - cooked to perfection, Al Funghi Pasta - great flavor, and the  Gigi - a party in your mouth. Great food! Go try it!"}
{"text":"We were seated on the roof top patio, very nice! Got to see a lot of the downtown happenings. The pasta here was delicious! Andrew was our server and let me tell you he is the best, funny, attentive and gave his recommendations which by the way were great! The atmosphere here was lovely, it's nice for a date night or to take the whole family out! Coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"Located at 1434 Crescent street in Montreal, Wienstein & Gavino's offers the perfect place to dine whether it is for a special occasion or a quick brunch.  The food is absolutely delicious and the service was amazing.  The venue is beautiful with three different floors, two outdoor terraces and on the street level there is a four sided bar.  They have a variety of wines and drinks to choose from to accompany your meal.  I had the sangria and it was delicious.  My boyfriend got the rum and coke and they were extremely generous with the amount of rum.  It was delicious and worth the price of the drink.   It was less than ten minutes after ordering that we received our food- it was honestly the fastest service I have ever experienced.  Although the service was unbelievably fast, the quality of the food did not suffer because of it.  It all tasted amazing.  I ordered the  RISOTTO DEL PESCATORE Lobster tail, shrimp, scallops, calamari, saffron, bisque and butter   and Gaudy ordered the  pasta GIGI Tomato sauce, cream, prosciutto, mushrooms, basil    I had been waiting for Gordon Ramsay to make my Risotto for the first time I ever ate it but since I knew I would wait years for that, this was a great alternative.  It was just amazing.   The prices are a bit high so it's not somewhere I would be able to eat every night but I will definitely go back to try more of their menu.  It was amazing."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, friendly waiter, delicious pesto and baguette on table, great salads and pizza. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Oops I just realized I never finished my review. LOL well I had the most spectacular filet mignon. I went there during Halloween time with the whole family. This placeis great for groups. It gets super busy after midnight of course so best tip is that if youre going for more like a dinner night out reserve and come early when there is still less of a crowd to hear the other person on the table."}
{"text":"We sat outside on the small terrace but the indoor space is huge with 2 floors and a dj playing commercial music (not too loud). The location of this restaurant is key, right in the middle of the crowded Crescent St. The food was mediocre. Italian themed. Nothing memorable except the warm bread with pesto starter which was delicious."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place. I have tried it several times since I was young. The pasta are really good and the pizza also. Don't expect to be super impressed when you only pay 13 to 20$ for pasta and pizza; for the price I was really surprised of my plate. I recommend the gigi pasta with mushrooms, prosciutto, basil and cream so so yummy. They offered me a special lasagna with a lot of vegetables. Really nice of them :) They always offer you as a starter bread with oil and balsamic. The bread is warm and fresh, it's delightful!! For you information it can get really noisy during the week end (Thursday-Friday-Saturday). Perfect place to bring some friends, for groups and family when there is less noise. Enjoy the terrace during the summer with a fresh drink or a sangria."}
{"text":"This place looks beautiful and I've been many times trying to find something on the menu that is actually worth the price tag. The pastas we had (linguini carbonara, penne arrabiata, tortelini rosé) were all very ordinary and not worth the cost. The appetizer we had was bruschetta and it was pretty good. The best thing here is the olive oil basil mix they bring at the start of the meal to have with bread. Overall very underwhelming. Maybe their pizzas are better, but I would definitely go elsewhere for pasta."}
{"text":"The place could have changed but my memory of it was of flavorless food surrounded by tasteless people with flashy gold jewelry (I'm talking the guys here...the girls were a little too brassy blonde). Maybe the place has changed though...I'm only giving it two stars because maybe it has gotten better but Crescent St was always...well if you can't say anything nice. For good food and a great time, there are a gagillion better places than here like L'Academie on St.Denis."}
{"text":"Yummy comfort food! Always have a reliably delicious meal here. If you're in the mood for a great plate of pasta this is a great go to. They even have gluten free and whole wheat options! My favourite part is the hot fresh bread and herb and olive oil dip before the meal."}
{"text":"This is a great choice for Italian cuisine. It is in close proximity to Peel metro and very close to St. Catherine street. But now to the food:  For starters they start you off with a baguette and this homemade oil to dip your bread in. Both are amazing. I look forward to eating it every time I go. And there pasta is to die for. I usually have the half tomato half Alfredo. I've also tried the pizza which was also very good. My close friend had the fillet minion and adored it. To top it off the servers are very polite and friendly ( a group of 15 of us went for supper and asked the waiter to take a picture not only did he take great shots he took a selfie of himself as a joke because he claimed to be the best server-which he was. We all laughed and for him to come in the photo.)"}
{"text":"I have a very mixed review about this place. While this wasnt my favourite , I also didnt hate it. So first off, this location is huge, it has two floors and is perfect for large groups (just make sure you reserve in advance as it does get very busy). The decor inside is rustic but nice and comfortable/clean. The prices are very cheap as well , and you get very big portions for your money. They serve italian food like pizza, pasta , risotto as well as a variety of starters and they have a wide variety of alcohol and cocktails. My issue was with the quality of the food , while it wasnt horrible , there was really nothing about it that stood out, it was very bland/ordinary. I ordered a Lobster Mac & Cheese which is usually one of my all time favourite things , but this one just fell flat. There was barely , and i do mean BARELY any lobster inside and the mac&cheese was super creamy but the cheese inside really had no taste and the noodles were overdone. Another person at our table had the risotto and had the same thing to say about it , just very bland and overdone.  However, someone at the table did order pizza and they seemed to be happy with it , so im thinking pizza is the safer bet when coming here. Their cocktails were pretty good all around though , so that was a plus. However, Ive been here twice and the first time our server was great , she was friendly and handled our group very well , she didnt miss a beat and made sure we all had what we needed. However, the second time I came here the server we had couldnt even be bothered to smile and kind of seemed annoyed just to be there. So service seems to be hit or miss. One thing I did enjoy was that they start you off with free fresh warm . baguette that comes with a delicious pesto dip (and they keep it coming !)  All that being said , I wouldnt be opposed to coming back here again if I were invited but it wouldnt be my first pick for dinner. Maybe I would recommend it more for drinks and snacks."}
{"text":"LOVED W & G's.  We were in town for a mini-vacation on Thanksgiving (2010) weekend.  A friend, who goes to Montreal every year for a guys' hockey trip, suggested it. The decor is awesome - lots of dark wood, a huge bar with bottles of liquor, wine and champagne along the walls of the restaurant. They played great dinner music (softer house & progressive music is how I'd explain it). I would highly recommend this place for just a drink or dinner while in town."}
{"text":"Que dire...? Peut-être qu'à trop en faire, on se perd. (Trop) nombreux plats de pâtes, grillades, poissons, salades... Un Costco de la bouffe, quoi! Mauvaise expérience. Une salade césar dont les feuilles de romaine étaient submergées par la vinaigrette et une lasagne dont les pâtes avaient été cuites depuis un moment déjà de par leur texture. Si on lésine sur la qualité, on se reprend sur les prix. Si c'est bon, on ne regarde pas à la dépense mais si c'est immangeable, ça fait mal au coeur de se délester de quelques billets, voir plusieurs car ce n'est pas donné, tout de même. Point positif: le service."}
{"text":"Positively awful. We had a reservation for a large party (12 people for a double birthday party) but even after arriving on time we had to wait 45 minutes before being seated. Maybe it was on purpose so we would order drinks, but they weren't very good and didn't use fresh ingredients (got the Caesar but the savory items that came with it tasted rotten). We then waited more than 1.5 hours to get our food... When most of the other parties around us had all been seated, ordered, got their food, and were paying the bills all in the span of us sitting there and we weren't even the largest party. Service was rude and inconsiderate, no one ever tried to even apologize for the extended wait. Food was okay. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Very nice food!  Gluten free pasta was great.  The Ribeye was amazing!  Good place and good atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Food was great, nice atmosphere, service was friendly and excellent. Nice outside decks. Kid friendly."}
{"text":"Crescent Street is one restaurant after another. We were a family of seven. We sat at a table on the second level (there are three levels.) On the first level, the music volume was off the charts LOUD. We could not have enjoyed anything with that much noise. The second level was a long flight of stairs up, especially for my 92 year old grandmother, but the music volume was more tolerable.The brick decor was charming. The service was pleasant and friendly. The food was pricey but tasty. If you're not going to be bashful with your prices and you're serving pasta, then give your patrons an ample portion."}
{"text":"I completely agree with the comment that this resto is suffering from an identity crisis, not knowing whether to be a bar, resto, lounge or club.   When I went for the first time in 2008 I was left with a very positive impression and I looked forward to going back. Strangely however, I returned about four times after that and EACH TIME, the menu had less choice, the meals were downgraded, smaller, and more expensive!   We gave it one more chance in 2010 and after that it was blacklisted unfortunately. It was better many years ago.  I simply would not recommend this resto, although I'd say the service is no issue."}
{"text":"Went after a gym session as I was starving. Place is really nice, the menu is affordable and they have a daily special that comes with a glass of wine. My friends and I started by sharing a plate of deli. The plate was nice, but I think that there wasn't enough cheese (plenty of meat though). For main course, I ordered a place of spaghetti carbonara. The portion was good (was barely able to finish) and tha plate was good (creamy and a lot of bacon). I would return."}
{"text":"This is a restaurant that I have been going to for a longtime since it was recommended to me by a friend. The location is wonderful - right on rue Crescent. When the weather permits, I love sitting on the patio which overlooks the street. The inside of the restaurant is very nice, and the place itself is very big.   The food is decent...nothing special. They serve your typical Italian dishes (pizza, pasta, etc.), but there are specials after 10pm, and they also serve breakfast. Prices are also fair. My favourite thing about this restaurant is the outstanding service that I always receive, in particular one waitress (unfortunately I never got her name). I have many food restrictions and she has always been the most accommodating server. Another perk is that Weinstein's can also be a fun place to drink.   Overall, amazing service, a great location, and half-decent food."}
{"text":"After a few recommendations we decided to try this place out on our trip to Montreal. When we first entered we were a little confused on where to sit. The bottom floor has a lounge vibe, the middle floor seems to be the loudest with the kitchen in view, and the top floor has a great amount of seating with a nice view of crescent street. We opted for the top floor.  First and for most this is not a spot for an intimate date. It is quite loud and difficult to have a conversation even with the people at your table. We all enjoyed the complimentary bread with oil & pesto. It certainly came in handy because we did have to wait quite a bit for our food, which is most likely due to how large the restaurant is.   I order the caprina pizza (I believe) and was impressed! I also liked their mojitos as I ended up having three! As for service it was mediocre. Not horrible but not great.  I would recommend if you're going in a larger group looking for a good time and don't mind waiting longer then average for your food."}
{"text":"I love to travel and find new restaurants. I am so happy to have found this gem in the great city of Montreal--a city with more good restaurants per square foot than most cities in the US--mind you,I love explore and try new places very much--But I look forward to my next visit to W&G's.    It was a Friday evening and the music in the bar was extremely loud--The hostess seated us downstairs not far from the bar. We immediately said it was just too loud to eat, let alone talk at all. We got up to leave and told the water server why we were going. He said to wait, took us up front to the hostess and told her to give us Table 10--apparently a quieter spot. We were ushered upstairs and around a corner--The place is huge--and to a dining area from which the noise and music of the bar was distant and faint. Thank goodness--They almost lost us, and we wouldn't have had that wonderful meal!  As soon as we sat down, the waiter brought warm Italian bread with pesto snd olive oil for dipping. So so so good!  We are vegetarians, and my husband and I shared a bruschetta, which was very good, presented in an unorthodox fashion--all piled up high on the toasted bread. It was delicious. For entrees, he had cheese tortellini in a wine and cream sauce, which he loved, and I had a pasta dish with pesto, pine nuts and goat cheese. The plates have very wide rims and a deep bowl which isn't all that wide -- at first glance you think it's one of those tiny portions that some restaurants serve. But in reality, there was more food than we could eat, even as hungry as we were! The service was terrific and the prices extremely reasonable.  So, we will definitely return to W&G'S!"}
{"text":"ATMOSPHERE: Very beautiful on the inside. It's vintage and classy and has 2 floors, so there's more than enough room. Plus, in between the two floors, it seems like there's a kitchen or bar, which is pretty cool too.  FOOD: Overall, the food was pretty good! For appetizers, I had fried calamari which was pretty good. Their warm bread was pretty good as well, it comes with a homemade pesto sauce. For the main meal, I had the veal with mashed potatoes and veggies and the meat was tender and juicy. I'd only come here occasionally.  PRICE: Prices were a bit overpriced for the food that you're getting. If anything, I feel like I paid more for the restaurant itself and less for the food.  SERVICE: The staff was nice. They did what they had to do."}
{"text":"I had their PROSCIUTTO E ARUGULA pizza at 15$.  The pizza was really hard to cut so eating it was a mess. In terms of taste,  the arugula and the prosciutto made a really good combo. But the unsalted mozzarella was not  good at all, the texture it added to the food was unnecessary and it only diluted the flavors.  The ambiance was pretty nice, it was Thursday night and quite busy, to my surprise.  But the food is definitely overrated, at least for my pizza. Everyone else seemed to enjoy their pasta, so I might go back for that.  Also, the waiter asked my friend if he wanted meatballs with his pasta and he was charged 2 meatballs for 8$. That's pretty expensive for meatballs lol."}
{"text":"Decent place, lively atmosphere but food is sub-par.  Meatballs were greasy tasting and the carbonara was bland with undercooked \"pancetta\", which tasted more like raw ham."}
{"text":"I give this place a\"meh\"- for some reason, this place makes me feel uncomfortable.  It's a good place to enjoy a summer night on the patio and people watch on Crescent street, but it's a bit smoky though.  Food is  tolerable - although the pasta was homemade, it was slightly disappointing.  Staff were friendly but seemed a bit forced."}
{"text":"Went to check this place out based on the reviews of other Yelpers.  It was a little crowded for dinner on a Thur. evening but they seated us right away.  The bus staff was overly helpful (this could just be normal for Montreal) in assisting us with our daughters stroller.  They carried it upstairs and parked it out of the way for us.  Coming from NY you don't often see service like this.  Anyway, the meals...  I ordered the pizza and DW had the meat Lasagna.  Both meals were pretty sizable and we both thoroughly enjoyed the food.  The wine \ beer list was pretty extensive as well which was a plus.    Don't be fooled standing outside this place, there is a massive multi-tiered upstairs dining area.  I would definitely check this out while in Montreal.  Hell we're here for a few more days we might hit it up again."}
{"text":"Really good consistent Italian food! Love their lasagna and their Greek salad (best creamy feta)!"}
{"text":"Not bad...no complaints...good place along a busy stretch.  Don't specialize in anything really.  Had some veal and LOTS of drinks.  Nice little patio, and good selections of everything.  Again, these type of places are a dime a dozen on Crescent St."}
{"text":"Very good restaurant. I loved the food. We were 9 people, 5 of us order the individual side pizzas and 4 of us order the pastas. Everything was delicious... The pizzas size is big enough for two people, they were cook on point. I had the seafood pasta and it was great. There was a lot of seafood very well proportionated, it also had lots of sauce as well as the others on the table.  Our waiter was very good. She always had a smile. I will totally come back to this restaurant when in Montreal."}
{"text":"Had the linguini with arrabiata sauce and seafood. Some of the best Italian food I've ever had outside of NYC, and better than many places I've eaten at in NYC. Sat at the bar for my first night in Montreal while here on business and it was a perfect end to a day of travel. Excellent service, very quick, lots of menu choices, and pleasant atmosphere."}
{"text":"Really good. The bread and pesto dip are worth the visit alone. I got gnocchi with Parmesan sauce. My guest got penne with Vodka sauce. Large portions and tasty. The waitress was great too. Ask to sit out on the street for great atmosphere and people watching"}
{"text":"Mediocre experience. Inattentive and lackluster service, expensive mass produced beers, boring food. My friend got a burger and said it tasted like one of those frozen patties you get in packs of 100- he maybe should have taken the hint when they said they \"Don't do rare or medium\"  $14 salad was honestly hilarious- small bowl of mesclun and some chopped apples with a little ball of cheese. I got linguini with ragu sauce- no complaints but no surprises. The only positive I can say was they messed up our order of calamari and gave us a large when we asked for a small, so that made up for the other stuff a little bit.  I couldn't tell what type of restuarant it was from the outside, but I decided it is \"wannabe upscale italian bistro\""}
{"text":"I disagree with people that have said the food here is mediocre. I had the soup of the day, which was a seafood bisque, and a tilapia dish as a main. I love soup and can't stop raving about that bisque. Appetizer & main were great. My peers ordered steak, and rose cream sauce gnocchi. Tasted both dishes and both were excellent. Also got to try their starting salad with thickly shaved parmesan on top, very good. The bread was warmed and doughy in a good way, also came wrapped in a little paper slip. Service was extremely professional: attentive, informative, friendly. The atmosphere is warm and welcoming with soft lighting. Will definitely come here next time I'm in Montreal."}
{"text":"I am on, on average 90 flights per year for Business. We just stopped in for a cocktail. We ended up sharing the soup of the day, a sausage plate and a bowl of pasta. What really stood out for us, was the quality of the food. Sabrina the bartender was a breath of fresh air and energy. We would HIGHLY recommend this place to anyone. They are building a great thing in Montreal."}
{"text":"Tres grand resto ideal pour organiser une soirée en grouoe. Les assiettes de pasta ordinaire mais l'entrée pieuvre tres bonne. Belle deco rustique."}
{"text":"The server, who looked Spanish, was horrible. So horrible, I realize I don't even know his name. He ignored me when I called to him and only raised his hand to acknowledge my call the second time around, without turning his head. When we were paying, he left the credit card machine with us, so we had to tear our own receipt, while he chatted with a larger group.There was not one smile. No introduction. No request for drinks. The food  left us desiring as well. Monotone tub of gnocchi. Pasta with meat sauce, fries and the calamari were good. Bruschetta was freshly made but just didn't have anything to it. Bread was cold but we were so hungry, bread dipped in evoo and pesto was good. The server experience really ruined our first night in montreal for that trip. I have been here many years ago and was hoping for the same fun night out but I guess things change."}
