{"text":"I have gotten some decent pizza from here before. The last several times the pizza was near burnt dried up and just plain tasted awful. After last night I promised myself never again. unacceptabe."}
{"text":"Deep S*** Pizza -  Fooled me twice, I feel shame! If you like your pie to be made on a thick piece of drywall, have so little cheese that the mozza looks translucent, pizza sauce like a bleached out crime scene - no evidence of red anywhere, and have toppings so sparse that it looks like confetti on a church floor from a wedding that occurred a week earlier, this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"Just came home after the bar. Every pizza place around  was closed and called deep dish. They said it would be $28. I had no prob since they were the only place that would deliver at that hour. I called after 20 mins to make sure that they were coming  and the guy that answerd  said did u order a pizza? When I said yeah he said then fuck off and hung up on me!!. Eventually the pizza showed up and was a pep pizza. So I just paid for a pep pizza when I ordered a Canadian .28 bucks and had someone tell me to fuck off. Don't think they will get my service again ..."}
{"text":"If they had called the place simply Deep Dish Pizza they might have gotten 3 or 4 stars for me.  But the fact they are trying to pass off their stuff as Chicago Pie, simply is fraudulent considering how stupidly good the real stuff in Chicago is.  It's like naming your car dealership Ferrari Supercars and only selling Corvettes....  Their pizza is decent but there are a ton of better places in Calgary, Nick's and Vogglio D'Pizza instantly come to mind."}
{"text":"Scene: Purchased slice of Meat Lover's pizza.  Negatives: The only thing that is deep about the pizza here is the sense of disappointment you feel when you eat it. The toppings are as superficial as a Polly Shore movie. Given its extreme dryness, I could not eat it. I plan on returning it to the museum at Pompeii (pending carbon dating), as the only logical explanation for the condition of this pizza is that it is an artifact stolen from the site of the Mt. Vesuvius eruption of 79 AD. Exhibit A is a photo of said pizza, with a small water bottle cap on the dish for thickness reference. Mmm, that bottle cap is looking pretty tasty right now.   Positives: Since the storefront is emblazoned with \"deep deep deep deep deep dish pizza\", I give props to the owners for hiring someone with a stutter to do their signage."}
{"text":"My favourite deep dish pizza spot! Get it made extra spicy just the way I like it. Loads of topping and lots of cheese... still can't get over how heavy it is every time I pick up lol"}
{"text":"Do not order from this place, long delivery, lots of excuses, cold pizza. Do not order."}
{"text":"This review is for 403204 Chicago deep dish not the one that has been around forever. We called and wanted 2 stalls, they said they wouldn't deliver 2 stalls, so we got 2 mediums. Was supposed to be $33.99 it was $49.95 when it came to the door. When I called them they said $33.99 plus delivery (to make $49.95), I said how much was delivery? They said whatever the difference was... I spent the next hour on the phone telling them they owed me $10 and having them insult me literally making sexual references about my mother and other insanely rude comments.  I have never had such a horrible and unbelievable customer experience.  Do not go here!"}
{"text":"The words \"deep dish\" have never been so recklessly and cavalierly used.  Come on, guys.  A think crust does not make it deep dish.  Heck, sparse toppings on top of a thick crust definitely does not make it deep dish.  This deep dish pizza flies in the face of every characteristic one would use in defining a deep dish pizza."}
{"text":"When my regular pizza place was closed I thought I would try this \"Chicago Deep Dish\".  I put quotation marks because this is one of the many knock off CDD's in the city.    I too waited over an hour for my pizza.  when it arrived it was almost cold!  The meat quality on the pizza was not appetizing, the crust was soggy.  At $23 for a large pizza, I expect better quality.  We didn't even eat half of it.  The one small perk to this place is that you can get a free 6 pack of pop or a 2 litre with your order, if you mention it.  This is one of the lowest quality Chicago Deep Dishes in the city, I'll spend my money elsewhere in the future."}
{"text":"Ordered pizza from 403-531-3131, pizza was delivered late, understandable, it's Halloween. Pizza was hard on the bottom, real soft above that and sparse on the toppings. Been ordering for 10 years and first time I had a complaint but it a total 0. I called them, said I had a complaint, she asked me what did he look like,big guy, little guy? I said It's not the driver it's\"ss the pizza. Told the ugliness and she took it personal. What do you want me to do about it, in a rude way, not the helpful way.  And then said you know I'm not there , you know that don't you. I said, you talk to me like I'm stupid one more time. She yelled the same words back at me, I hung up what a voice what customer service..what crap. Dog is eating the pizza frozen for a couple weeks. I'm not calling that number again."}
{"text":"I've ordered from here many times. Definitely one of my go-to places when ordering a pizza.  The food always arrives nice and hot and I have never been dissatisfied with one of my orders.   I highly recommend a  medium half all-meat half cheese pizza, its always been enough for the four people in my household.  Chances are there will be leftovers as well.   If you are looking for quality deep-dish pizza look no further, Chicago Deep Dish is the place for you!"}
{"text":"I seem to get hooked on certain foods periodically throughout my life and right now, pizza from Chicago Deep Dish Pizza is on my top five list of favorite foods.    When delivered, this pizza arrives at the door piping hot and is always the way I ordered it.  If I ask for extra mushrooms, there are obviously extra mushrooms.  The ham they use has good flavor, as does the Italian sausage.  I love their Hawaiian with mushrooms and Italian sausage.    When we're in the mood for a good, thick crust deep-dish pizza, this is our go-to place for sure."}
{"text":"Okay! If you call this place expecting Lou Malnati's or Giordano's then you don't know anything about pizza...congratulations you played yourself.   This is not classic Chicago style.   BUT it will definitely hit the spot in your time of hunger!!!  Called them, easy to respond, got a Zeus plus Bacon medium.  Came in 30 mins, cheaper than room service, tasted great!!!  It's not \"classic pizza\" but the square form is smart and easy to share with friends.  Ingredients aren't straight out of Tuscany but taste just fine!!  Definitely way better than any Canadian pizza I've ever tried.  I will definitely order here the next time I'm in Calgary!"}
{"text":"Calgary has a signature pizza and its found here. The small pizzas can feed 2-3 of us and that's a small size. Our go to pizza is the Mr. Universe which is loaded with tones of meat and veggies. It's always made right and always hot, fresh from the oven.   The staff were nice and it didn't take long from ordering to having the pizza made. We did not order any of the extra stuff but it sure looked good.   It's worth a try if you have not tasted a real deep dish pizza made right."}
{"text":"This one's a little tough for me to write considering I've been deflowered by REAL Chicago Deep Dish Pizza. Had I written this review BEFORE I lived in Chicago, I would have probably given 5 stars, but now that I've had the REAL thang, I'm sorry, but it's only going to be 4 stars.  Real Chicago deep dish pizza can only be experienced in one of two places:  1. Chicago 2. Your wildest dreams  Real Chicago deep dish pizza is to die for. Well, you WILL probably die from it if you eat it often enough cause it's the furthest thing from being good for your body, but it's the closest thing to being good for your soul. Post break-up pints of ice cream have NOTHING on Chicago deep dish pizza - TRUST ME.  As for Chicago Deep Dish pizza in Calgary, not bad. I have tried it a couple of times, from different locations, and I'd say that my favourite location is the one in Edgemont. The owner is a sweetheart and he custom-makes the pizza to how you want it. I LOVE spicy food, so he hooks me up! He also has no problem supplying me with ranch dipping sauce free of charge. He's very nice :)  No, it's not REAL Chicago Deep Dish pizza, but it's GREAT pizza from a GREAT owner at a GREAT location.  If you're thinkin' of trying it, take my word for it, try the Edgemont location. I've never regretted it, and neither will you."}
{"text":"Consistently good pizza.  Hits the spot and good quality.  Keep in mind that one or two slices is a meal here they are generous deep toppings.  A Large does myself and my partner a few days.    Nice touch they will do a half and half if we can't agree on the type of pizza."}
{"text":"Best pizza in nw calgary... Been coming here for years...  Unbeatable pizza...  Give them a call i assure you, you wont be disapointed.... 403-503-0808 Always open late for delivery or pick up.."}
{"text":"I called a couple hours before they closed was told it was a 45 minute wait that's typical I waited over an hour finally it showed up the lasagna was greasy but cheesy  the toast is Texas toast but it was burnt in the edges and most of it was hard and not very edible  The chaser salad though was delicious disappointing that it's not an actual cease dressing packet and the lasagna half as with almost no noodles and there vegetables one slice of a carrot WTF did you throw the leftovers in"}
{"text":"This place has been getting a bad rap which I do not understand. Having been a chef for 10 years I understand the need for a very clean kitchen but some of the best food I have ever eaten has come out of the dirtiest places. Don't get me wrong, I am not saying this is some of the best food I have ever eaten! But really as long as the cooks hands are clean I am willing to over look a dirty floor if my food comes out tasty.   So this place is not a true CDDP I guess, which does not matter to me at all! What does matter to me is that it is 2 blocks from my house and has a pick up special of a 14 inch pizza for only $6.99! At that price I would expect some pretty bad pizza but low and behold each time I ordered it I am finishing the whole thing in a hurry. Only draw back of this place is they sometimes do not have certain toppings so when you call be ready to switch your order.   Lastly the two guys that work there, and possibly own the place are super friendly and always excited to see you, customer service one does not expect from a pick up pizza place late at night.   Oh, and putting crushed chilies on top when you get home is a sure fire way to enjoy the whole pie without realizing!"}
{"text":"Thank you for this chance to write about Chicago Deep Dish Pizza in Bowness when there is no immediate email address to write to them and complain. My co-worker and I ordered a Hawaiian pizza this summer with extra cheese, and it was so good that we convinced our boss to order another today (December 16, 2010) as it was our celebration of a couple weeks off for Christmas and New Years. What a mistake this time. We ordered exactly the same pizza with extra cheese.  These were the results: 1. The person who took our order got the street incorrect. 2. My boss phoned after an hour and 15 minutes only to be told it had already been delivered and paid for! 3. We got a phone call afterward asking where we were located. 4. It was delivered slightly warm after being ordered an hour and 20 minutes previously. 5. There was absolutely no extra cheese, (the person who took the order not only got the street incorrect, but also blew the extra cheese request) 6. We were hard pressed to find even ANY cheese. 7. Very skimpy ham and pineapple.  Plenty of crust. 8. All in all, it convinced us never to order from Chicago Deep Dish again, which is a shame since we enjoyed the pizza we received in the summer so much. 9. To all Chicago Deep Dish managers - Unfortunately, sometimes word of mouth will work against you.  Please pay attention."}
{"text":"Our family has always enjoyed a good thick slice of pizza with loads of cheese and toppings. One slice does it all...but we don't stop there...gotta have a couple more so you feel like you're going to explode.   The building has recently been renovated so it's easier to find, plus its right across the police station so you may expect cops in there all the time :)  Prices are good for the food you get and it's pretty quick too. From the time we order to pick-up was only 20 min.   This is a Calgary staple and has been around for a long long time. If you haven't tried it, you should do it soon!"}
{"text":"Love this place! It's hearty and full of goodness.   If you're really hungry and need a scrumptious pizza to fill you up...try this place. I've never been disappointed in the quality, only surprised how heavy each pizza is. From the toppings, to cheese and thick crust...it's certainly going to satisfy you. One or two pieces and you're stuffed.  This is the one place that I've never had a pizza problem or had a bad experience. There has been some imitation Pizza's that i accidentally went to, but never again.  Try this place out, you'll be happy you had it."}
{"text":"I wouldn't even  feed this pizza to Sarah Palin.  We had it delivered to my condo - after the deliveryman scuttled off into the night we opened the box to find the pizza semi-burnt with half of the toppings missing.  I called them to see what we could do and received a screaming earful of incomprehensible  ESL threats (comical, really).   I decided to leave the matter until the next day and return the pizza in person, hoping for more progress than what I'd just experienced.  That night we ate some salad instead, calling it our \"anti-moob\" action.  Upon arrival to their dank, filthy, repulsive location the next day, well......let's just say if I wanted to be verbally abused by a hairy, irate, trainwreck of a man I'd go visit Mel Gibson.  He looked at the pizza and said there was nothing wrong with it, but that if I wanted they would give me a free pizza to replace it. I politely let \"Mel\" know that if that's what their pizza was supposed to be like, I'd rather not.  There's a chance that Hitler may rate this place higher than one star, but it's doubtful.  We certainly won't return."}
{"text":"I'm sorry, but I still like an old school, heavy duty, big and somewhat greasy pizza.  This location has never failed us and there is pizza night in my house once a week (usually for boys night, but I usually indulge in a piece or two).  You know you have a pizza box of craziness when a size small weighs 5lbs.  Good times."}
{"text":"Deep Dish used to be my favorite pizza until I ordered one from this location.  The toppings are down to nothing, the pizza is not deep dish anymore and no cheese.  It did not taste anything like the ones I buy from the 531 3131 location.  what a disappointment."}
{"text":"The pizza is eatable but honestly not amazing. It's not AT ALL like Chicago deep dish pizza ! The crust is so thick but that's not what Chicago deep dish pizza is! It's supposed to be filled insanely high with toppings and LOTS OF CHEESE but instead you're eating a lot of dough! i also specifically asked for no mushrooms and had it delivered and it got here with LOTS OF MUSHROOM! My husband hates mushrooms so he had to pick them all off but what if it was an allergy?! We'd be screwed. Also for a medium pizza with delivery it came to 37$.... I had Pizza Hut a few weeks ago and it was better and only cost me 21$ with a dessert! Personally I will not order from here again! And I think they need to change their name! ITS NOT CHICAGO DEEP DISH PIZZA.... you're giving that pizza a bad name!"}
{"text":"I'm normally skeptical of \"value\" priced pizza but I was home very late after a delayed flight and there guys were about all that was open so I gave them a try & was pleasantly surprised.   $30 got us a HUGE pizza that was absolutely loaded with good toppings & lots of cheese.    Thanks!!"}
{"text":"Damnit!  They piss me off because the pizza is so yummy, but they take so long to deliver your food to you.  Honestly, I don't want to be waiting for my pizza for about and hour and forty-five minutes before I have to call to find out where it is.  I just want it to get there so I can eat it while it's hot.  I'll tolerate waiting an hour, but when it's closer to two it's a little delicious.  Still, I always order from them and hope they'll be quicker because I love Chicago Deep Dish pizza so much!  The favourite from them is pepperoni-hot pepper because they really load up on the peppers... both hot and oni!  The pizzas are square so the middle pieces are my favourite by far... no crusts!  Yippy!  So, in exchange for ordering my favourite pizza, I sacrifice my time and waste precious eating hours.  It's a trade-up, but it's totally worth it."}
{"text":"Zero stars! 45 min late . the  driver answered his phone in the hall of my condo @ 1:30 AM. Started yelling to the person on the other end while holding my cold pizza. Ordered from here for years never again."}
