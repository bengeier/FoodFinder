{"text":"Three words for this place: (and each word the same)

Amazing, amazing, amazing!!

Try the food here along with experiencing the wonderful and friendly service and you TOO will understand the above statement. 

My girlfriend and I had walked past this location many times while it was under construction before it opened, eagerly awaiting the day when we could officially grab Greek food within a 5 minute walk from our place. 

But would the food be up to snuff? 

Finally the day came after they had opened when we decided to find out for ourselves.... First impressed with Grillway's very clean/modern (yet still cozy and invitating) interior, we were secondly dazzled by the friendly and pleasant staff behind the counter. 

We opted to each choose one small dinner each (Souvlaki, the other dinner being a Gyro) that I believe came with rice, potatoes, and salad - along with pita and housemade Tzatziki. 

\"Mouthful after mouthful of WOW\" is what you might say to describe the food here if you need to elaborate further than just \"Amazing, amazing, amazing\". 

Either way, both statements are true. 

Go and see/taste for yourself."}
{"text":"The restaurant is clean, staff is friendly, food was tasty. All at a reasonable price. I ordered the lamb souvlaki, with potatoes - that sauce on the potatoes was so good! The portions were huge, will definitely be coming back to try out the other items on their menu"}
{"text":"After going to the original Grillway on Annette street for years, the son of the owners had opened their second location on Bloor. A little more modern than the first with a smaller menu, the new place is comfortable and welcoming. 
I'm THRILLED to say that their fries are exactly like the original Grillway and for that they get my 5 stars!! Best fries in the city - a little battered on the outside with a real crunch to it but soft on the inside. The onion rings are absolutely delicious as well. I didn't really get a chance to sample more on their menu but I absolutely am going back. 
The food prep area is really clean and the veggies are all fresh. 
Looking forward to the next meal there!"}
