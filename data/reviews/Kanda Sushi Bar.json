{"text":"We had buffet.....sushi was good but I was very disappointed with the Chinese food. It was bad as per my taste."}
{"text":"In terms of quality, the sushi is pretty average, even for a AYCE.  However, when I studied and worked downtown, I could always be sure to stop by, stuff my face silly, and leave within 45 minutes-1 hour.  Service is quick and efficient, and because the lunch menu is fairly compact, the food's pretty consistent"}
{"text":"This was the WORST customer service I have yet to experience. I was treated by the hostess/waitress at the front counter as if she was doing me some big favour by listening to me while I was listing off the take-out sushi. Eye contact was sparse and she was constantly rushing to answer my questions, at times walking away in mid sentence. Eventually I got my order through. Then the food came (she dropped it on the counter and said, \"Your orders ready\" without looking at me or even acknowledging whether I heard her from across the room). I paid $40 but only got $20 to $25 MAX worth of sushi at any other place. The sushi was ok despite being sparse. The sashimi was about 1/3 of the thickness that you would usually expect. The slush bubble tea was not the smooth silky texture you would expect, but rather the granulated ice slush you get at the convenience store for $0.99--but you'll pay $4 for the slush here.   Skip this place. It's not worth it the price and the customer service is the worst.   Had they charged half the price or if the portions were double the size, then I would perhaps forgive some of the attitude and maybe give them 2 stars, three max."}
{"text":"We went there on a Saturday for lunch. The service was really fast and everything was delicious. We have been to other Kanda restaurants before, but this one was clearly the best one! The avocado rolls were huge! (and not the all rice, tiny avocado piece in the center like in other all you can eat sushi places). The caviar sous-marin  and the spicy salmon rolls are the best!! Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Location is good, but that's about it. The selection is quite poor and the service is slow. I much prefer Tokyo Sushi for price, food and service."}
{"text":"Fantastic sushi. Some of the best I've had . Service is kind of hit or miss and as for price for what you get is quite fair ."}
{"text":"BAD SERVIVE and sad to report the negative experience but this was really not expected.   We arrived at the location at 9.45 pm and saw a bright illuminated sign in the window indicating that they close at 2 am. This was perfect!  Right after we ordered we were told that last call was at 10.30. We still thought all.was ok and th at we could eat at our own pace.  Not so. At 10.30 they started closing the place down. We received the bulk of our food at 10. 45. No way we could eat it in such short order. Especially since one of us has had a stomach surgery that greatly reduces the pace at which I can eat.  So we payed ans politely asked if we could carry the 10 or 12 pieces we had not had time to eat. WELL THEY WANTED TO MAKE US PAY AGAIN....$1 PER PIECE as if we had over ordered.  I mentioned that the hours in the window were different and they told us this was hours for another restaurant in the basement.   So we had a half our meal. Payed full price and we're refused the inconvenience of carrying or food out.   Crap service especially that when we walked in we specifically told the hostess that the 2 am closing time was perfect for us. ..which she never bothered to correct."}
{"text":"Expérience client 'pour emporter' laisse à désirer (Kanda Brossard).  La majorité du temps, ma commande est incomplète si ce n'est pas simplement incorrect.  Encore une fois aujourd'hui (2 juillet), je commande un rouleau Philadelphie et un rouleau saumon californie avec 2 mayo épicées en extra.  J'arrive pour prendre ma commande, et en raison de mes expériences précédentes, je vérifie l'exactitude de la commande.  Comme de raison, il manquait les mayo épicées.  L'employée va m'en chercher... pendant ce temps, je m'aperçois que je n'ai pas reçu un rouleau saumon californie mais bien un californie... tabarouette que je suis tanné. L'employée m'offre de refaire ma commande mais j'ai déjà payé et je n'ai pas le temps d'attendre. J'pense que je vais me trouver une nouvelle place à sushi.  Vraiment terrible comme expérience"}
{"text":"Coming from two people (me and my gf) who regularly enjoy the awesome quality of sushi and excellent service at Kanda Pointe-Claire, we came into Kanda Decarie with high expectations.   First off, the place was freezing cold. I couldn't tell if we were sitting indoors or out and they didn't bother to change it at all..  Then the food came in.. Every single thing we ordered was well below subpar. The rice was just not cooked enough and the rolls would fall apart when you tried to pick it up. It felt like we were eating from your average sushi stands and even those had better food.   Lastly, we ordered 2 bubble teas (pineapple w/ tapioca & coconut w/ lychee). Not only did we wait 15 minutes for it but when it finally came, she had the tapioca & lychee in opposite bb teas.. -_- We pointed this out and she apologized and took them away to make us new ones.. or so we thought! When it came back, it was ridiculously obvious that she just scooped and swapped the bubbles. Final product was lychee and tapioca visibly mixed together in both plastic cups.   We asked for the bill and left. AVOID THIS PLACE!"}
{"text":"We came to eat at lunch time, their were crumbs all over the chair and tables. The tray that holds the soya sauce looks like it hasn't been washed in a long time. It was so caked on i had to almost break the soya to get it off the tray. After the waiter picked up the table and dropped salt everywhere ( on table and chair that we were sitting on) he never came to clean it. The sushi was good, if only the people took care of the place it could be like it was before."}
{"text":"Very fast food and great service.  No guilt factor when you order a lot and there is a very homely vibe.  The restaurant seems to have had a lot of money invested into it as it's in a prime location, but many people would rather go to its competitors.    Hot food is excellent although sometimes seems to be a bit of a limited menu compared to others.   Sushi is good, but no where near excellent.  For the price, I always get my money's worth especially during lunch time.    Overall a convenient awesome a volonte sushi and does not deserve a bad grade at all."}
{"text":"Disappointing sushi selection and quality.  Sushi rice was too wet and menu selection is very limited.  Salad tastes wonderful, but you don't go to the AYCE sushi to eat greens.  Not to bash this place, but I think I'll stick to Sushi Palace near Rue Grenet."}
{"text":"Ate here with my parents. It's now $18.40 to eat the ever shrinking all you can eat menu. The service is slow and not attentive. The quality of the sushi is passable.  I am now officially over this resto chain.  I understand that this place will last because of all the offices along Decarie - captive audience.  Their others probably will die because the quality to price ratio has gone way down."}
{"text":"Service is slow.  Sushi is mediocre.  $17.24 gets you a very limited sushi menu.  The rest is Chinese dishes, so why call it a sushi bar?   I asked the waiter if the single piece teriyaki order is large or just a small piece. He said it was a small piece, so I ordered 4.  He served me 4 giant pieces of salmon teriyaki.  I told him it was way too much and please take it back. He asked me if I wanted to keep one and I said ok.  Then another waiter serves me another giant piece a minute later. I told him I already have a piece and he got annoyed with me. The previous waiter obviously added \"1 piece\" to my order by mistake!  I had to tell him this.    To top it all off, it's a pay at the cash restaurant, even though they give you the bill in a bill folder with a place for the credit card and then don't bother telling you you have to go to the cash to pay.  I had to sit there for several minutes trying to get someone's attention.  Very rude.  Not worth the price. In Toronto I can get a much better AYCE sushi meal with better service for $13. (See Masa Sushi on Charles St. E)"}
{"text":"The service was okay, not friendly, but not unfriendly. It was lunchtime and the service came quickly, which my friend thought was very surprising, since usually it's slow.   There isn't lots of sushi choices, but still, the sushis are good.  Not much to say about this sushi bar, except that it's okay."}
{"text":"Great place for a quick fix for the price all you eat  for $22.  Smaller sushi pieces with more rice than u like but still fresh and reasonable good."}
{"text":"Another all-you-can-eat sushi restaurant in the downtown area of Montreal. A bit cheaper than others, but it shows. (Note: you also gat a discount if you are a student, which definitely appeals to the young folk in the area) The bright spot for this restaurant was the salmon and eel nigiris, but this was definitely overwhelmed by the inconsistency in the rolls and the slow service. Haven't been to the other Kanda establishment, but the decor was nice."}
{"text":"I'm totally a fan, and when in Montreal for work or play will often find myself here. This sushi bar is an all-you-can-eat without the negative stigma of a buffet. Rather, your sushi is made-to-order, and you simply put in additional requests. Although the sushi is very safe (read: no specially-cut eel or blowfish), the basic rolls are fresh and well-prepared. I have happily sat here for a couple hours ordering sushi and doing work, and (likely because it was neither lunch or dinner rush) wasn't hurried or bothered. Although Montreal boasts better sushi, Kanda is really solid sushi with a pleasant and non-distracting atmosphere for a relatively cheap, fresh lunch."}
{"text":"Food- 3.5 stars Service- 1 star  It is a strange feeling to be in a restaurant, a place that is by no means close to full, and to feel unwanted by your server. Maybe this guy was just having a terrible day but with every question, every request, my friends and I could feel his hatred burning. It started with inquiring about whether or not we had to do the all-you-can-eat. Most places I know have that as an option but this seemed to be the be all and end all by the way he was speaking... except it wasn't. Awkward.   Note to you: we didn't get the AYCE, but you might as well if you're remotely hungry because it will come to about the same price.    The miso soup was a bit blah. The edamame was good and came in a huge portion size. The maki itself was great! I had a spicy salmon roll as well as a dynamite-tempura shrimp one, both very fresh, tasty and covered in fish eggs. Tried my friends tuna sashimi- not so fresh tasting, but at least we had a few rolls going to make up for it.   Bill confusion, pay upfront. They probably won't separate it for you but we got them to split it equally four ways. Good food, which for the most part gets utterly burried under some you're-dumb-why-are-you-here? service. Unfortunate but true of this experience I had."}
{"text":"J'avais rendez-vous chez Kanda Sushi mercredi soir sans savoir que c'était une place où on mangeait des sushis à volonté. J'ai été agréablement surpris par la fraîcheur des poissons, des makis et des sushis. Aucun ingrédient exotique mais l'expérience de déguster des sushis en plusieurs batchs a été super agréable. Le décor est ordinaire mais l'ambiance est calme et le service est rapide. Je n'irais pas là pour un souper romantique mais j'y retournerai sans hésiter pour un souper avec quelques amis."}
{"text":"Excellente place a sushi !   Le principe du buffet a volonté est genial. Le goût est là aussi ! Decoration sympa.  Essayer les sashimis de saumon, une tuerie !!  Pour ceux qui n'aiment pas le poisson cru il y a un grans choix de plat de poulet,  boeuf sauté,  nouilles etc"}
{"text":"A lot of young men work there. They look like part-time students more than sushi master."}
{"text":"Great food selection and its a bring your own wine!  Been here about 5 times over the past year and always had great service, I don't get all the hate this place gets in the reviews.  It's an all you can eat restaurant people, not the Ritz!"}
{"text":"Service is bad, food is slow, and the nigiri sushi didn't taste much because it was practically all rice. I go there with friends when we are really hungry and want to stuff ourselves, but if one wants to enjoy actual sushi, there are many other places in Montreal.  On the other hand, the Korean BBQ they have upstairs is alright, you just have to pay some extra bucks for it (you can still have sushi with the BBQ). The service is mediocre, and they do not allow you to change the grilling plate once it gets charcoaled (unlike most Korean BBQ places)."}
{"text":"The quality of food, i can bear with. Service, not so much. Granted i came on a Saturday night during peak hours, and the busyness was expected, but at least seem to want to cater to us? Definitely understaffed, and servers were just running all over the place like no tomorrow. Trying to flag down a waiter was almost impossible. Once you actually had them flagged down, it was like they were ready to move onto another table when you had barely gotten a sentence out. Service did get a little better towards the end of the night as people were leaving, but that didn't really make up for the majority of the night.  I've worked at an ayce sushi place before, and i understand the struggle of busy nights, but at least make it look like you want us there? Especially when it's $30 per person.. All in all probably would not come back on busy weekend nights."}
{"text":"If you want good, cheap, and great experience go there.  I highly recommend to go there after 5:30pm since the menu and food is way much better then, also their weekend menu is better, though a bit more expensive."}
{"text":"Went for a Sunday lunch.  The food is very mediocre. With so many all you can eat sushi places at similar prices, one should expect decent quality food.  Kanda is the equivalent to the \"fast food\" of all you can eat sushi. The rolls are pre-made, so they leave the kitchen at record speed. Our sushi roll order came in under 3 minutes. The sushi is somewhat hard and the fried roll is not even remotely fresh.  Likewise, the other sides are rather bland. The general tao chicken was decent, but the tampura batter had almost no flavour and the dumplings were tasteless.   Look somewhere else for a sushi lunch. There are plenty of good places to go to, where the food is made to order, and the service is still great."}
{"text":"I'm not rating the kanda sushi bar, but the chinese restaurant downstairs in the basement! It's probably my fave canto place in montreal. The dishes are delicious everytime we go there. They have many kinds of fresh seafood and you can choose which flavor to combine then with.   The staff is always friendly and nice. The place is pretty clean, even if it's in the basement."}
{"text":"My first experience at Kanda St Catherine was unpleasant. The food was terrible especially given the price they charge. It felt like it is made in a factory as it lacks freshness and taste. To top it off, the place itself is dirty, I went to use the rest room and I was shocked how dirty it was."}
{"text":"Went there for Mother's Day   Terrible experience. There is a difference between \"All you can eat\" and \"All they want you to eat\"    They don't bother bringing your order - they make some of it only   Slow service and long wait for the food like they can't handle to volume or is it a ruse to control the open food bar    Well that's an illusion   Don't think all you can eat is real.     Food was expensive for this quality.  Low end of the good scale plus their frying oil was old   Left a rancid taste in the mouth like cheap French fries    Gave me stomach ache all night  Quality has been going downhill for a while now and I won't be going back   I can't recommend this to anyone especially when it's a special occasion when restaurants are busier"}
{"text":"I usually order delivery from these guys. Their take away menu is affordable and filling -I usually get their bento box combo A - which includes 8 California,3 pieces of shrimp, crab and salmon sushi (1piece each) and a seaweed salad for 11$. I like their vegetable and shrimp tempura - remains crispy even via delivery. As for the quality of sushi - not superb- I usually don't eat California rolls - but for fast food- I like it better than the sushi shop. And the Bento box is quite filling.  I use just-eat because of the free delivery and 15$ min purchase, they also give coupons emailed often.   I have also ate their all you can sushi menu in house. It's Sub par compared to their other locations, but that's what you get for all you can eat sushi."}
{"text":"I have read mixed reviews on this one.  Is it the best Sushi, no. But considering it is all you can eat, how good do you think it can be.  Was brought here by a friend for my birthday and as a whole I had a good  time.  Love the sushi pizza, the maki rolls were good to quench my Sushi craving & all the extras like broccoli beef & general Tao filled me to the brim. As a fun outing when craving quantity over quality, this place is he place to go:)"}
{"text":"Solid, solid sushi. This is 5 stars for an ayce type of place so I hope I'm not setting false expectations.  The sushi selection at lunch is pretty varied (red tuna). The salmon sashimi is a delight and the variety of rolls is awesome.  The Asian dishes like shrimp or General Tao are superb. Only letdown, was a oddly tasting miso soup. It's also odd ice cream is extra here as it's normally included elsewhere.  Right across from the metro with a parking lot and between two major highways, the location is close to everything."}
{"text":"4 stars because it's bang for buck value.  You can bring your own wine, and eat all you can eat! Who's gonna complain about that!?!  It's easy to say if you're expecting top grade sushi, this isn't the place. But it's actually better than a lot of standard sushi shops.  Stick with the sashimi and the dumplings, the rolls are okay, hit or miss...  I find you can have a great meal one time and everything is super fresh, and sometimes it can be stale and not as great tasting..  I start with a small order to see what's tasting the best on that given day, and order more from there...  And hey, I never leave here without absolutely getting all my money's worth, great spot.   Cheers !"}
{"text":"Love this place. The food is always fantastic. The service is very fast and the price is very good too. Would recommend this place to everyone who loves sushi."}
{"text":"Wow.  I guess you need to know what you are doing here. I went in for lunch and they sat me down. There was a lunch list there that it looked like you needed to mark what you want.  I just assumed this of course by looking around.  They did not instruct me what to do nor was it written on the menu. I didn't have a pen either.  I waited 10 minutes and no one showed up to explain the process.  I left and went next store to Dunn's Famous Décarie"}
{"text":"Du ma meiiii. Very good.   All you can eat quality food. Oh my god.  Every bite is like an orgasm in mouth.  Du du du du ma mei.  Wee ouh wee ouh."}
{"text":"Yeah, I wasn't very impressed with this all you can eat sushi joint. I found it strange that 1 order of a maki roll was for only 2 pieces. What the what? I spotted a tray with pre-plated sashimi on it covered with saran wrap. So yes, it's quick and edible but even at $14.49 for lunch I still didn't think it was the worth the money and have eaten much better all you can eat sushi in my time. Also found it strange how limited the all you can eat menu was, but I suppose that makes sense if everything is pre-made... sure, it's busy so what you get is fairly fresh but personally I'd rather wait and get something that has been made to order. Also found that the nigiri and maki rolls fell apart very easily.   As a final warning, I'd suggest you stay away from the edamame, it looked pretty wilted, wasn't salted and was just plain bad. I couldn't finish it.    So if you couldn't tell by this review, I will not be returning to Kanda any time soon."}
{"text":"OMG! Forget the sushi bar and head downstairs to the Chinese restaurant. I assume it's owned by the same people, but the food quality is entirely different. This place is amazing! I passed by probably hundreds of times and never knew what was going on in the basement. Hidden down there is a truly wonderful place with very standard Chinese dishes but the key is really asking what is good. Our favorite dishes of the night were the crab and shrimp, recommended by the waiter. As the photos show, we got Salt and Pepper Fried Soft-Shelled Crab, Beef Fried Rice, Fried Pork Intestines, Chinese Broccoli with Oyster Sauce, and Jumbo Shrimp - Hong Kong Style. They excel at seafood here, so make sure to order a few dishes to try. The intestine preparation was ok, but it's not what we expected and forgetting that every other item was delicious. This is a restaurant going on my rotation from now on."}
{"text":"The sushi was great but aren't the best I had. They have a lot of choices to chose but for the service, they sometimes forget about some orders. Except for this , Kanda is a good sushi restaurant"}
{"text":"Very bad experience! The Szechuan shrimp was awful, don't take it. One of my friend was sick, sashimi was badly cut and not fresh. The only good thing is that they fill up the water when you ask! Honestly i know many AYCE in montreal and this one is very special."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were in town on vacation for a week. We wanted to stop in a nice restaurant for sushi and this was conveniently located a few blocks from where we were staying. The atmosphere seemed nice and we were seated right away due to hardly anyone being in there during the lunch time. We were asked in French what we would like to drink?  Once we spoke in English we were treated poorly. We each ordered iced tea. They were brought out in a can with a straw in them, while other customers were given glasses.  We were offered no water either. We were given an all you can eat buffet menu with no other option to order from a regular menu.  Nothing was explained to us indicating the all-you-can-eat only option.  Once we realized that was our only option, we started to order more at each time.  Every time our rolls were brought out we had to request a new menu, they were not presented to us automatically.  We felt as if we were bothering them each time we asked for one.  Also felt as if we were bothering them each time they brought out our food.  Food wise the rolls were good.  It wasn't top-notch maki, but it was a step up from buying the pre-packaged rolls in stores. There were a fair amount of options for rolls, but their full menu was not available for the all-you-can-eat buffet. They also had some decent sushi as well, but again nothing too extravagant.  When we were finished, we were given our bill and asked to pay up front (spoken in French, when they knew we spoke English)!  We noticed other customers paying from their tables.  There was no total written on the bill and when presented to the \"cashier\", she had a confused look on her face.  She totaled up our two all-you-can-eat lunches($24.99 each), along with our two iced teas($1.50 each), plus tax.  Our total should have been $52.98+tax (around $55), we paid about $63!  They must've decided to include a tip for themselves without our consent. I'm really glad we didn't leave an additional tip at the table! To sum it up: Rude service Decent food Over priced + over charged Needless to say, next time my girlfriend and I are in Montreal, we will not be returning to this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Looking to satisfy my sushi craving and wanted a la carte or bento box style so as not to be overly stuffed for lunch.  Kanda Sushi happened to be in the vicinity.  This is an AYCE sushi and there you go - my idea of moderate eating totally vanished.   This is not a gourmet place for sushi, but good variety and fresh fish.  Surprised to see the place packed for lunch, and pleasantly surprised to see speedy service.  Salmon and butter fish sashimi was so good especially when it is not usual to be in lunch menu.   Lots of free parking, bring your own wine and able to pay by Amex are big plus."}
{"text":"My favorite all you can eat sushi in Montréal. Taking into account the quantity, quality and price. They have different menus depending if it's lunch or diner. At night the choice is larger including dumplings, but it's pricier.  It's full most of the time, even during the week, so if you have requests, you will need to ask them several times. And the toilets are not always clean."}
{"text":"Delicious traditional Chinese Cantonese food served in the basement floor. Bring your wine and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Not the best Kanda location in the Montreal region but does a great job for quantity and not quality. Avoid during lunch hours at all cost."}
{"text":"Wow-  I couldn't disagree more with the previous review.  Fresh. Fast. Fabulous.  I am seriously drooling thinking about the slabs of ice cold salmon and tuna sashimi I inhaled during my stay in Montreal.  $14 gets you access to all you can eat- not one of those nasty places where it's all sitting there or floating around a lagoon.  You are given a paper menu/pencil, mark off what you want/how much you want.  Hand paper to waiter, order comes back in under 5 minutes TOPS.  Order more if you want.  Try to arrive either before noon or after 2- if not, line is out the door!"}
{"text":"Usually I do not write a negative review. However, this time I felt obliged. Kanda have made a name for themselves, but when we went for  launch this Monday it was horrific  nightmare. Food was oily and saggy. Sushi the rice was filed with  oil and not tasteful. The Salmon was fatty and not the prime style cut. Even the service no-one smile at you from the hostess to the people that take and bring the food. I understand it was busy and they did not expect that on a long weekend holiday but they colud have taken their time make the great food that we use to have on the past."}
{"text":"I do not know about you but here it is my openion.I wnet at lunch one of the few palces that offer Sashimi at lunch and it melt in your mouth. then the tuna sushi is out of this world. the smaoke salmon is really supper at lunch all of trhs for 14.99$. Light high quality Sushi.  At night the Jumbo broiled shrip galic is super beside what ever you have Sashmi. the beef sashimi is the best in the world so smaoked and tender is great even peoplenot used to it praised it. I have been in vages suhsi , vancouver sushi itcy Ban this palce is here in montreal up to this catagory. enjoy it"}
{"text":"I've been to ALL the Kanda Sushi's on the island of Montreal for the last 12 years.  I've watched the quality degrade over the years till only one Kanda maintains its quality, which is the Kanda in Laval.  Last time I ate at this new restaurant on Decarie, it wasn't too bad and I even wondered why the other two reviewers gave such a low rating.  The second time I went, the food was at its most mediocre ever.  The sashimi wasn't fresh and tasted like the fridge.  The rice in the sushi was not cooked well enough and the flavoring was just not up to par on the other entrees like dumplings, shrimp and salad.  Definitely wouldn't recommend going there, unless you have a strong stomach and an undistinguished palate :)"}
{"text":"L'endroit par excellence si tu veux te bourrer de sushi ET de plein d'autres délices comme des edamame, du boeuf aux champignons, etc. etc. etc.   C'est un \"all you can eat\" donc jeûne la journée d'avant pour être certain d'engloutir le plus de bouffe possible!!!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to any Kanda sushi places in ages... I ordered on their delivery service. The service was 45 minutes long which is not too bad. As for the quality of the food, I can say it is not the best out there, more like okay, it is eatable and it fills you up. The price was around 17 to 18$ for 14 sushi (sushi with fishes mostly) and two eggs rolls. I can't complain at the price I am paying because it was cheap for a reason, the fishes are the sort that get refrigerate and defrost for consumption.   Their level of competitiveness has gone down a lot for the past years, others all you can eat sushis are more competitive with nicer decors and better service. It used to be a hot places to frequent for the sushis lovers in Montreal but it has since become a common food and not a luxury food.   I will say it is okay... When you are craving for sushis and your taste buds don't care too much about the freshness of the fishes. Go for it!"}
{"text":"Kanda is a bit expensive, but you get good quality  all you can eat food. Usually all you can eat restaurants have very low quality items, but this place does well"}
{"text":"Kanda chinesse restaurant in basement of Kanda Sushi.  Really amazing food! The portion are also decently big. My dad and grandma always complain when we go to a restaurant and this one is one of the rare ones that they say the food is good.  A bit more pricey than what you would pay in Chinatown but the dishes have more variety too. Have been satisfied at all the dishes we ordered the few times we've been.  They seem to be well known for their seafood dishes. We ordered the ear cooked 2 ways (steamed & fried ) and both ways were delicious."}
{"text":"while the price is appealing, not much else is.  the rolls are not original or particularly well executed, they use too much rice and the seaweed paper is chewy, the fish was not fresh but tasted OK.  maybe its a culture clash - myself being from California, where I can find a better sushi place by sneezing onto my GPS."}
{"text":"It's mot 3 1/5 * but I found some typo mistake on the board. I don't know why but I'm annoyed to see some mistake on a menu, it kills the professionalism of the restaurant. Anyway, I went there to carry out and it's pretty fast, they have the best cheap sushi in my opinion. It's tough to find some good cheap sushi, especially some all you can eat sushi place with some decent quality. The carry out I had is obviously not all-you-can-eat but 12 pieces (6 california rolls,6 tuna rolls, 6 blabla don't know rolls! The fish is fresh, quite good even thought it doesn't beat some other sushi I had, but it's definetly a good spot for cheap date. for 30$ you're out with all you can eat, a soft drink and a tip."}
{"text":"We went for the all you can eat lunchtime deal, and it wasn't half bad. Not the best sushi by any means, but for $20, you get what you pay for (and lots of it).   The hardest thing about this place is not getting carried away. Their menu is extensive, and it's easy to want to order one of everything. With that in mind, you should know that if you don't finish everything they'll charge you for any remaining pieces (I think it's $1 or so per piece).   Service was fast and friendly, but if you can, avoid peak hours (between 12pm-1pm), as it can be incredibly hectic during these times."}
{"text":"I was so very disappointed in this kanda location. a few girlfriends and I decided to stop in for a quick dinner and even though the restaurant was almost empty they took forever to come bring us water and take our order and then again to bring us our food. I understand we went on a week night and not during peak hours but Once we got the sushi we barely ate any of it because the rice was stale and tasted like it was old and some of the fish had dry edges to it. I don't understand why it felt like we got old sushi that had been sitting around and why the service wasn't great when the restaurant was less than half full and they had a full lineup of sushi chefs working. Even the water had a strange taste to it. The only thing that was ok was the tempura. Another positive is that it's bring your own wine and that it's not very expensive but that's not enough to redeem this. I'm confused because I saw good reviews for this location and I hope I went on an off night but I can safely say that I won't be going back to find out."}
{"text":"Normally I'd give Kanda 3 stars because the sushi is so so especially when compared to other sushi places in Montreal.  Really if I'm coming here it's because I'm going for quantity not quality.  That being said after my most recent visit you can sure I'll be avoiding this place like the plague.  My boyfriend and I came here for a friend's birthday dinner.  The service was spotty in that they forgot to bring a few items that we had ordered but that turned out to be the least of our problems.  The sushi was okay but a few pieces just didn't taste right. I thought it might be a question of personal taste because nothing seemed to taste rotten but boy was I wrong.  About 24 hours later those off pieces came back to haunt me with a nasty case of food poisoning.  Now if it had been just me who had gotten sick I would have given them the benefit of the doubt and not written this review however it was not just me who got sick.  My boyfriend also fell victim to food poisoning as did two of his friends and these are the ones we know about.  Coincidence?  I don't think so.  I really hate writing one star reviews but this was inexcusable.  Like I said if it was only me who got sick I wouldn't have rushed to such solid conclusions that the sushi was the culprit but it wasn't just me.  I do enjoy the occasional night of all you can eat sushi but next time I won't be coming to Kanda for that."}
{"text":"Disgusting. First glance table wasn't clean where we are seated. Utensils and plates given to us aren't clean, still had some sushi residue and other things. Staff not friendly. Ask this one lady to change our plates, we were constantly ignored & she only \"noticed\" when we came up to her. Petty. So if there plates, utensils & tables aren't clean, imagine the food they are serving. Food wasn't that great either. When giving you the food you ordered, they would just drop it or slide it on your table. Also, the floor, I'm not sure if they know how to broom. Full of fallen food, tissues and place mat. I really think the staff were not thought what is a good customer service."}
{"text":"Perfectly satisfactory sushi - for $21.49 Cdn you are able to consume all the sushi you can eat - be careful to not order too much as there is $1 penalty for each piece you cannot finish.  The rolls are standard - you won't find any exotic ingredients here like macadamia nuts or mango, but again, fine.  Fish is fresh - we liked the nigiri and sashimi of salmon, hamachi and tuna.  Of the cooked options, grilled squid was a tad tough, the pork katsu flavourful, the tempura dough a little thick...  Service is efficient if not a little brusque."}
{"text":"First off, I am about to review the basement of Kanda, so the byow chinese food section of Kanda and not the all you can eat sushi on the main floor. We ordered steam fish, orange pork, beef stew, garlic stir fry bean stalk and garlic stir fry 'veggie heart' (literal translation from Cantonese) with stir fry chicken slices. The steam fish was amazing- super fresh and super well cooked, in Chinese we say the meat was absolutely silky which in terms of fish standards is an A+. The orange pork was super well executed, not too much breading and the pork was fresh and still moist. Alot of bad restaurants tend to use just the fat parts of the pork or old meat that's going stale since it's easy to hide in this dish but this one wasn't the case at all. The bean stalk dish was delicious! Plenty of wok 'power', wonderfully executed. The veggie heart dish was delicious too but they were stingy in the veggie portion for that dish. My only complaint is that the meat in the beef stew was a bit dry but nonetheless executed really well and reminded me of home. By Chinatown standards, the price to portion ratio is higher but the food is well done and ingredients fresh."}
{"text":"This company should be out of business , it's the lowest quality sushi place , nothing is fresh here colour  of the fish is always pale why? Because the fish they use  Is  prepackaged  and frozen , quality is piece of shit . it's just disgusting ."}
{"text":"One of my least appreciated sushi place, I think that their sushi are not very fresh nor tasty. I think that it is a very plain Japanese all-you-can-eat restaurant, so don't expect quality food. The entrance to the restaurant is quite tricky and easy to miss, beware to drivers."}
{"text":"\"WOULD YOU LIKE EXTRA BLAH WITH YOUR BLAH...?\" Ok, so did I mention anything about the blah? I know, I write \"blah\" a lot. Wanna know why? It's because I had a lot of \"blah\" at Kanda's. I ordered a lot of different sushi's, but it was hard to differentiate one from the other. It was all...you guessed it: blah. No flavor, no freshness, nothing that good sushi brings you. Just \"blah\".   Made a reservation thru their web site. When I arrived at the restaurant, the hostess said she didn't have any reservation under my name...as Seinfeld would say, they know how to take a reservation, they just don't know how to keep it. The service was average. Just average. Barely average. We were rushed out. We had barely finished our plates that they were waiting with the bill. I mean, it wasn't 00:30 , it was 19:45. They seemed in a rush to get rid of us. Oh yeah, it seems that certain pieces of sushi are available only Friday's and Saturday's. I guess the Sunday thru Thursday chef doesn't know how to do all the types of sushi's. It's not so bad I guess, since I'm pretty sure I would of not been able to tell the difference with the other ones. On a personal level, t.v.'s in a sushi bar? what is it? a sports bar or a sushi bar? It is my perception that Kanda is a pretty big name in sushi, since it has a couple of franchises. I guess a known name is not a guaranty of quality. Live and learn. I will never go back."}
{"text":"This review is not for the Kanda Sushi Bar, but the Chinese restaurant that is hidden in the basement under Kanda. I don't even know if it has a name, but it is one of my current favorite Chinese restaurants in the city. We've been many times as a large family and with friends and every dish so far has met expectations of all who have gone. The prices are a little higher than the regular Chinese fare, but it's totally worth it. This is truly a hidden gem."}
{"text":"This is my go-to AYCE sushi restaurant! The location and menu selection are really what makes this place worth it.   This Kanda location is right in front of Namur (metro station), which is a big plus for getting there easily without having to brave those cold winter nights for too long. The interior itself is pretty big and has a modern look to it. There's even a downstairs area which is just as big as upstairs, with bathrooms and what appears to be an entirely separate dining area (? Is it a secret restaurant? I have no clue)  I've mostly had the lunch menu (it's fairly cheap, around ~16$ per person), which is already pretty big. On top of the expected sushi selection (nothing too fancy, but some of those makis are pretty original), there's 3 kitchen menus with various dishes, from tempura to general tao to noodles. The sushi itself is really tasty (for AYCE standards), I like the flavour of the rice and the sushi doesn't fall apart. The makis aren't overly big either, which is a plus for me at AYCE sushi. When I went last night for dinner with my fiancé (we brought a bottle of white wine, it's BYOB!), I noticed that the menu was A LOT bigger. There were a lot more kitchen items, as well as additional sushi options (including various sashimi, which are very good). The food itself tastes better at supper (better staff?), but is obviously more expensive (we ended up spending ~60$ for the both of us).   Some essential menu options to try include tempura jumbo makis, kanda makis, beef sashimi (supper only), and, as dessert, their \"petit pain frit\" (it's a sort of fried layered dough ball topped with a thick sugar glaze, it's really tasty and better than paying 4,95$ extra for fried banana). AVOID the sushi pizza (we couldn't even finish it, the toppings are so unappealing). Please change your recipe, Kanda!!  Expect to lose an item or two from your orders during your meal, though. It has happened to me every single time that I've went that a random item that I ordered won't show up. I'm not sure what that's about lol"}
{"text":"let put it like this, i came to montreal over the weekend to unwind - decided to munch on some AYCE sushi, there are a few good places in NY and NJ \"read my other reviews\" , It was hard to pick out a place in montreal, so I decided to give kanda a shot.  Location -      Its about 2 blocks from the McGill station, not bad  About Place/menu    So the restaurant has about 2 floors - but on a sunday afternoon only the main level was open, and it was busy the wait time was about 3 minutes to be seated, this is really all you can eat, you get a sheet a paper and you order from there, they had sushi (fish top rice bottom) salmon, tuna, crab, and a few others (also had Salmon sashimi in 2s so if you want 10 order 5) , they also had cut sushi (in 2's) had the california, salmon, avocado, - no hand rolls (cone), asked if i could order a la carte, and was told it was not avail.  they also had a cooked menu selection like chicken/beef/salmon teriyaki- wasn't interested   Quality Rice was fine, they didn't over do it with rice, and the rice was edible not hard like others state. Salmon - AWESOME! Avocado - Creamy and nutty :) Wasabi - looked abit old, still enjoyable but looks old and dry  Price Lunch was $15 and they had a 10% off student discount my school id from NJ worked, so that saved me $1.50 helps with taxes.  Overall, place was clean,service was quick waited about 2-5 minutes to wait for order to come through, which i got in parts,  nice staff, would come again"}
{"text":"Pour 2 personnes, ça m'a coûté 61$, et ce, sans alcool. Ce prix ne m'aurait pas dérangée si la qualité et la variété avaient été à la hauteur. Premièrement, ce n'est pas vraiment un sushi bar. Allez-y, vous comprendrez... J'y suis allée un dimanche soir, et 4 sortes de sushis n'étaient pas offertes la fin de semaine. Plus une autre sorte qui était rayée du menu pour je ne sais quelle raison... Bref, cela limitait beaucoup notre sélection puisqu'en partant, question sushis, il n'y a pas tant de choix... J'ai aussi commandé un cornet (temaki) au saumon épicé : un misérable bout de saumon était inséré à l'intérieur d'une tonne de riz et de 3 goutte de mayonnaise épicée. J'ai appelé. le serveur pour lui montrer l'intérieur de mon cornet et en commander un autre. Il  en a rapporté un autre sans problème. La soupe miso n'est qu'un bouillon dans lequel flottent de minuscules morceaux de tofu et quelques algues... La soupe miso la plus dégarnie que l'on m'a servi de toute ma vie! Les crevettes panées se noyaient dans une grasse et épaisse panure, et le buf au sésame n'était que des morceaux de tiraille, vraiment dégueulasse. À moment donné, l'un des serveurs (on en avait 3 différents!) a rapidement déposé un plat sur notre table : c'était des tranches de poisson. Le problème, c'est que l'on n'avait rien commandé de tel! Sachez également que si vous commandez un jus de litchi, il vous sera servi dans un verre en plastique avec un couvercle et une paille et que ça vous coûtera 2,50 $. Ce jus est très bon... dommage que le verre soit, dès le départ, à moitié rempli de glaçons (comme ça, ils économise sur le jus...). Aussi, côté décor, je me suis demandé à quelle fréquence l'immense arbre artificiel qui trône au milieu de la salle était nettoyé. D'autant plus que son feuillage de style \" lierre \" s'étend sur presque la totalité du plafond...  Bref, avant de partir, j'ai fait par de ma déception au serveur. Il a écouté et c'est tout. Voilà, mon devoir est fait : je vous éviterai de gaspiller votre argent dans ce resto de ploucs..."}
{"text":"First time at this place and it was amazing!   After 3 sold months of midterms, my class decided to celebrate by getting sushi. We were 60 people who came. We made reservations in advance for a Friday.   When i got here, i was quickly escorted to my table where most of my classmates were already talking and ordering.   We had more than enough space and the waiters added more tables as more people showed up.   I'm used to ordering at sushi buffets using iPads, but here, they have a big list on paper and you write the quantity you want. If you're a small party, it's fairly simple to order.   Service was very quick. We got our food in less than 15min and all the same kind of things arrived together. (Ex. All the sushi and sashimi came at the same time and all the tempura came together)   The food was exquisite. Some of the best sushi I've ever had! The hot and sour soup was not the best though. I hear the miso was quite tasty. The ice cream was also great.   The only problem is that since there aren't pictures or descriptions, so people who haven't had a lot of sushi experience might feel overwhelmed by all the choices.   Ah, and I feel the need to add that the decor was quite stunning! It was very rustic, yet clean.   It was a wonderful experience and I would definitely recommend this place. But be forewarned: prices during weekends are pretty steep. My meal came to 39$ (after tax and tip, excluding alcohol, since we brought our own wine).  (I'd like to apologize on my class's behalf to anyone we may have disturbed on Friday. Please don't penalize the restaurant for our noise!)"}
