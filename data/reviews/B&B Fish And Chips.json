{"text":"I really love this fish and chips store. Its the only one i've ever been to and im soo glad that it is literally just seconds from my home. I've been coming to this fish and chips store ever since i was a kid and was attending  the elementary school down the street. I gotta say the prices did go up... i remember buying just the chips for $2.10 and now its about $3.25. I remember asking the lady there why did you guys increase the price (just out of curiosity) and she claimed that they haven't and it was always at that price which is completely wrong lool.   But nevertheless i really love this fish and chips store....i usually just get the chips but whenever i buy both, the fish comes out really greasy and if you squeeze it a bit, it does drip out of your hands so if you have high cholesterol or not into oily fish then stay away!   But in my case the fries i gotta say is AMAZING its actually the best tasting fries i have ever  tasted (and i've tasted many different fries but this beats them all!!). They have other things on the menu like onion rings and other types of fish and beef-gravy (no chicken) but i have never had any other things in the menu besides there specialty.   There is no seats inside to sit and eat, just a little waiting area around the corner to wait for your order but they do have a little bench outside that people tend to sit and enjoy there fish and chips. The store itself isn't appealing...dark and full of potted plants on the window and not bright.   But overall i only go for the food..don't really care much about the store design. The price of the chips if ya'll are wondering is $3.25 for the chips and $9.90 for the fish and chips.   Oh, most importantly this is CASH ONLY they don't accept visa/debit and they do have a beverage fridge in the corner."}
{"text":"Funky little store that doesn't look like it has changed in 20 years. First time I went I didn't know if it was really a fish and chip shop due to all the plants in the windows. Once inside you'll see it is exactly what it says it is, fish and chips.  Your order comes wrapped in yesterday's newspaper. The batter can be a little on the heavy side but they make up for it with reallly good fries! Costs about $10 and they're quick. Oh, and no where to sit inside and eat."}
{"text":"Awful place. Had several times of stomachache after having the oiliest fish and chips. Never wanna go again. Recommend this place to someone you hate. BI"}
{"text":"I normally go to Reliable Fish n' Chips to get my fix, but this time decided to venture further down the street to the other little fish n' chips spot on Queen Street East in Leslieville, B & B Fish n' Chips.  Outside, the quiet, little, dark store front with windows filled with potted plants is a bit discouraging compared to Reliable, which is bright, modern and normally buzzing with the cook frying away and clientele tucking into one of the specials at the window counter. These few blocks of Queen Street East have little restaurants that have since been transformed into dive bars (Tasty Chicken House, anyone?). Since I couldn't find a recent review of this place, I was concerned that it was indeed a dive bar.  Inside, I found a little old Chinese man reading a newspaper. I ordered up a fish n' chips and he promptly opened the fridge door, which must have been there since the shop originally opened way back (50+ years), took out the batter and fish, and went to work.    The fish went into the hot oil, and then the chips.  Then it all came out, was drained and went onto a sheet of paper, which was wrapped into a cone, sprinkled with salt from a repurposed Huy Fong rooster brand chile sauce jar, and was swiftly wrapped into a bundle of old Sing Tao newspaper.  Ten minutes later, I got home and opened up the bundle to reveal, golden brown fries and a good hunk of fried fish with what looked like a pretty crunchy batter. I doused it in malt vinegar and went to town. Despite having steamed in the paper bundle for a good ten minutes, the batter on the fish retained a good crunch, the fish itself tender and juicy, and the chips were divine - a nice, firm, almost crisp exterior and a lovely fluffy interior. Difficult to explain, but it is definitely hard to find nice thick chips done well like this.  A negative is that the fish was a tad too brown - but probably because I distracted him with conversation the entire time I was there - and greasy. But eating over a pound of deep fried goodness never leaves you feeling nice and light afterwards.  The price was $9.75, almost at par with Reliable.  A diamond in the rough. Definitely my new go-to place for fish n' chips.  Sorry Reliable!"}
{"text":"I have to agree with previous reviews the fish was soaking in grease. The taste was bland and greasy. The fries were okay. Overall I would pass."}
{"text":"Food is very greasy. The amount of grease on the paper was disgusting. You could ring out the grease from the fish. Halibut fish was soft and mushy. Im from Nova Scotia. I know my seafood.  Halibut doesn't taste or feel like that. Tartar sauce you have to pay for. Packets at that for $0.20 cents. Come on now. I will never eat from here again."}
{"text":"I found that b And b fish and chips was too greasy and over priced. It is a nice restaurant with good service. The gentleman in the shop could lessen the batter so you can taste the fish. Not so big on it wrapped in newspaper but hey u get what u pay for."}
{"text":"When I entered B&B Fish and chips it took me back to when i was a kid coming home for lunch and going to B&B for some fish and chips wrapped in newspaper with the dusting of salt and vinegar. Unfortunately that's where the memory ended.  The price of the fish was really cheap for Halibut, so I thought I was going to get a very small portion.  When the cook pulled out the pan pf fish from the fridge, it appeared to be about 6\"x 6\" and about a 1/2\" thick.  I wondered how they could sell halibut sooo cheap and not lose money.  The fries were 1/2\" cut and crispy. I'm not sure what kind of fish it was, but it definitely  wasn't halibut.  It was greasy hard cooked batter and the fish so so soft it turned to mush in my mouth, with only the taste of grease, no fish taste."}
{"text":"Looks very old from the outside, but that didn't stop me from checking this place out. I had a craving for fish and chips and my thought was, \"this place looks like it's been around for a while, maybe there's a reason for that?\"  I think there is. I was greeted by a Lucky Cat and a soft-spoken older Chinese man. Him and his family have owned this place for the last 30 years or so, I believe. I can tell that the man has been making fish and chips for a while. - Careful, nice and quick, and packaged my food perfectly (looks like he has a good technique going). Just like other reviewers, I took transit home and a half hour later the food was still crispy. I loved the fries and the fish was great. The fish was a little greasier than I'm used to, but nowhere near as bad as some as the negative reviewers claim.( - What do you expect? Fish and chips is a greasy meal in general.) Personally, l'm not normally into thickly battered fish, but I really enjoyed this one! (It's sort of in between thin and thick, actually)  Take-out only, but you can't go wrong with this place because the fish and chips is  cheap, but still very delicious. Lots of chips with a nice portion of fish. Otherwise, if you want a little less greasy fish, then Reliable fish and chips is a few blocks west. They're pretty solid overall, too.  End note: I don't know why, but I found it really cool that there's Lucky Cat in there AND the man wrapped the food in Chinese newspaper. It's like a cross-cultural thing. The man was very grateful for the tip I left and put it with the Lucky Cat."}
{"text":"Great little place run by a Chinese couple that live in the back.  They take time at preparation, and I always enjoy what I get.    It's a fish & chips store with no frills.  Pretty simple.  Order, pay, take-out, eat."}
{"text":"From reading the other reviews and with the look of the restaurant I was unsure about it, but decided to give it a try.  I was impressed with this place, the older gentleman was nice and quick with our food. It was pretty greasy, but tasted good all around. Good was pretty heavy, but I didn't mind it."}
{"text":"I wanted a touch of nostalgia for lunch.  I believe B&B is the last chip shop in Toronto that still packs it in a newspaper cone.  My family has been coming here on and off since my mother was a teenager.  That's right my MOM.  I used to love coming here as a kid and leaving with a cone of hot fries to hold.  NOTHING has changed about the place in decades, for better or for worse.  It's a little dingy.  It's the same old Chinese man.  It used to be OK food for GOOD value and great nostalgia factor.  The prices are exorbitant nowadays though.  I haven't been in 2 or 3 years, and it is now $12 for fish and chips, 20c for each wing's tartar packet.  Serving size is still the same.  Thin crisp piece of \"halibut\" (seemed too soft to be halibut).  Lots of fluffy, greasy chips.  I don't mind paying for tartar and having a tiny piece of fish when it was $6-9, but when it's $12 that's too much.    Thanks for all the memories, B&B!  but you are dying a slow death and will probably be taken off my fish and chips rotation."}
{"text":"The most grease I've ingested in one sitting - ever.  The boy and I tried the fish, fries and onion rings. Fries were good, the wait was fairly short and serving size was good for the cost. But again sooo greasy, even after I picked my fish up in some paper towels and squeezed it a couple times. The onion rings were equally as oily.  Chippy's on the west end is far superior and has waay more options."}
{"text":"Consistent food since I was a kid. It's one of my favourite childhood memories.  I always go for a visit every time I am back in Toronto."}
{"text":"Yes B&B is greasy but what do you expect from fish and chips? I actually love the taste of the batter, and the freshly cut fries are the bomb. The halibut is fresh and hot, though the portion size could be a bit bigger.   No fish and chip place is cheap like it was a decade ago - it's called global overfishing, people. Actually this place is still cheaper than Reliable and Off the Hook. Get the halibut at Hooked nearby and cook it for yourself for $20 a filet, by that comparison the low teens price here is very reasonable."}
{"text":"An old style feel good place with whats got to be the worse fish I have ever eaten. Sorry, but too much batter and soaked in grease, whats to like. Years ago this place had it going on and it was good. No more, thanks!"}
{"text":"have been coming here since I was a kid, coming back whenever I have the fish & chips craving. Honestly nowadays it's probably not the best but very good price for a big piece of halibut and large portion of fries. the last time I was here though it was overly greasier than usual but can't complain too much about grease if you're having fish & chips"}
{"text":"Dated store.  Fish and chips was barely ok but would not go back unless I am very hungry.  Service is not their strong suit.  Fish and chips are freshly fried, but not that well executed."}
{"text":"It's a mystery how B&B can charge  so much less then anybody ($7.67 after taxes for F&C) yet have a product that few can touch. B&B has become my go-to-place if I'm looking for good old fashion fish and chips, and it's not just the price that keeps me coming back.   This is very much a traditional fish and chip joint, no frills, nice big piece of fish (I suspect halibut) that's properly battered , thick hand cut fries and all coming to you in a newspaper cone which is a real nice old school way of enjoying the meal.  I'm a fan but why no perfect score? In the summer when I eat it the fish and chips is great but I've gone during the winter twice and not quite as good. First time the fish was overcooked and the fries a little dry, the second time, much better, I was happy with my meal but still not quite as moist as when I have it during the summer.   In short, traditional, no nonsense and affordable, really what fish and chips should be."}
{"text":"Wow, that's one greasy meal. Really enjoyed the chips but found the fish very greasy. Had my gall bladder out shortly after. Not sure if there is a connection :-)"}
{"text":"When I was a kid many moons ago there were three things you could depend on at a fish and chip joint.  1. You're gonna to get a big helping.  2. It's gonna be greasy.  3. It's gonna be wrapped in newspaper.  This place has got that all covered. So if you're a grease-a-holic like me, check it out. I think I just talked myself into heading down there right now."}
{"text":"If I wrote a full-review it would almost be word for word, the same as Emily C.'s; therefore, instead of writing all the details again I encourage you to read her experience. I will only note the differences. I'm not from the Leslieville area, and made a special trip to B&B's after reading numerous positive reviews.   In my case, the fish was perfectly fried to elicit a beautiful golden brown colour that maintained its crunch despite a 20 minute car-ride. The fries are fresh and cooked perfectly. I have nothing bad to say about this place! If I'm in the area and have a hankering for some fish and chips I'll be heading back there for sure."}
{"text":"Way too pricey for the chips and fish  - plus the fish was not as tasty as halibut I've had previous in various locations.  Would go back for the chips, but I'd skip the fish next time."}
{"text":"I was craving greasy and it's a long weekend so why not?   VIBE  I was greeted by a Fortune Cat. You can't get any chinzier than that. The Chinese owners may take one or two minutes to say hi but they're lovely (and interesting). Decor has a LOT to be desired but what do you expect? This place has been in business for over 30 years. You've got white tiles, newspaper clippings scattered all over the wall and the obligatory posters of the different types of fish (Hello, Penrose I'm looking at you as well).  There's three plastic patio chairs. Take a seat and have a gander at the lovely 3-D fish poster they have. It's quite fun. Service was quite quick but I was the only one there until someone came in about 5 minutes after so I can't say how quick it actually is when there is a bonafide line up. I also love that they use a Chinese newspaper to wrap up all of the goods. Amazeballs.    THE GOODS Let's compare cost. Next door, at Goods and Provisions, a full meal is $23 to $26 for a main. At B&B, my fish and chips with tartar sauce (40 cents for two packs...WTF) was $9.16. Not a fair comparison but I'm letting you know what next door charges.   To the food: Nice flaky halibut that is not overly greasy but a bit crispy. Definitely needed some salt and tartar sauce.  The fries were greasy but this isn't Fresh or Live Organic Raw Food Bar. I want them greasy and they were thick and chewy too. Mmmm.  I'd love to try the onion rings and other menu items like the scallops. My mom had some of my fish (she's an avid fish and chip goer) and she said \"Yeah, these guys know what they're doing.   OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK Get some seating and a table people! All they have to do is take out this big white box that's beside their counter and voila, you have at least two happy customers who don't have to commute.  Unless you live in Leslieville or are driving, you're going to get major hunger pangs  while traveling with the take out. That said, with the bus commute (the bus was taking particularly long today) the fish and chips were wrapped so well that they were still pretty warm when I got home.  PSST: Cash only."}
{"text":"Greasy but good. Fish is great, fries are great. Sever asked if me and my girlfriend were sitting outside on the bench so to fold the newspaper with protective paper in a cone bowl, so cute She gave us the little wooden fork thingy, this made the meal out side with my love on the bench in the sun very memorable.  This place is old school and very cute...  4 stars because greasy, it doesn't effect it's lovely flavor. The flavor is great, it's just heavy so you need to be ready for that.  Enjoy, really great low key mom and pop Greasy Fish and Chip place... :D"}
{"text":"I was driving along Queenie (East) and I saw Reliable Fish n chips (name always amused me... like they ALWAYS have fish n chips in stock!) but I couldn't find a spot to pull over.   Decided on the newish KFC at Greenwood but then I see B&B fish n chips so I figured it looks like it's been around a while so WTF I'll try it.   Went in and ordered... $14.00????  Surprisingly, when I walked out to go get cash at the atm a rough toothless rubby walking by yells \"B&B hasss ssshhhhittt fish mmmannnnn!\" at me. I laughed to myself and continued.   Once back the old guy finishes up, I pay ask it out to eat on the street.   WELL that drink knew his shit!!!  It was awful!!' Just a hunk of orglange grease!!    I ate a few chips....had one full bite of the fish and spat out the second!!  Steer clear"}
