{"text":"What do you do if it's 10pm on Easter Sunday and you're craving gourmet pizza that could be delivered right to your door? Yes, I know that sounds way too picky and demanding, but well, what's your point?! And yes, this is EXACTLY what just happened to me this past Easter Sunday as I was hanging out at a friend's close to Yonge and Eglinton. Luckily after a couple of failed attempts, google pointed to Classico Louie's Pizzeria. Honestly, we were too happy to find a place that was open that I didn't even care to read the reviews on Yelp! And what a pleasant surprise!

We ordered an extra large Pizza with Italian sausage, caramelized onions and mushrooms. This pizza arrived within 30 min, as promised, and one look and it was clear that we had hit the jackpot! 

Generous amounts of all the the three toppings, loaded with cheese, on that PERFECT golden brown and thin crust, and oozing with the mouthwatering aroma of garlic and oregano! Mmmmmmmmmmmm

{"text":"This place would have got 5 star if it wasnt for the cashier telling me that what i wanted on my sandwich wouldnt taste good... I dont care what you think would taste  good my mouth my taste buds, i kind of gave her a face like what do you mean you \"cant do my request because YOU think it wouldnt taste good\" thats when she responded in a way to humour me and drop the conversation. Thank you ill get my second choice since it seems like such a chore to do a simple request. The sandwich i had was absolutly delicious flavourful toasted to perfection. The ceaser salad was equivalently delicious with what tastes like house made croutons cooked to perfection. My tastebuds are beyond pleased my mind kind of annoyed i didnt get to try my original choice as im sure it would have been amazing. Ill be back... For the food!!!"}
{"text":"got a stone cold pizza with the wrong toppings, paid for premium and got regular. When I called and told them all I got was a denial that the pizza could have been cold and as for the wrong toppings which ruined the pizza\"sorry about that\" and the phone is hung up. Will never order from Classico again!"}
{"text":"Best pizza around! A perfect neighborhood joint and the owners are so kind. I am not sure about the food outside of pizza though because that is really all we ever get!"}
{"text":"Ask anyone living within 5k of this joint and it'll be clear that this is a must-try spot on the gourmet pizza scene. The dough is as classic Italian as you get lest you compare it to the artisans sculpting it in the back. The toppings are as fresh as if they were taken out of your nonna's grocery basket. Top-it-all off with reasonable prices for dine-in, take-out and delivery and you'd be a real paisano if you didn't try it out."}
{"text":"Their specialty pizza #6 with tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese, goat cheese, eggplant, & roasted red peppers on whole wheat crust IS INCREDIBLE! Certainly one of the best pizzas in midtown! The best!"}
{"text":"The pizza was ok. Not loads of flavour but overall nice fresh taste with great crust.  What I didn't like was the price. $9.75 for two slices!!!!!  A medium pizza at Pizza Pizza cost $5.99 .  Sadly I wont be going back, such a shame as I just moved in down the street from here and it was going to be my new pizza place.  I would never eat at a place where two slices cost almost $10."}
{"text":"We *tried* to order pizza from this place to support local, non-chain businesses 2 times. 

In the first case, the pizza did not arrive for an hour. I called them to learn that they did not see the online order. So I canceled the order because the owner would not compromise in any way (i.e., no discounts, still an hour wait for the pizza).

In the second case, I ordered only half of the pizza with meat. Instead, the whole pie came with it. We had to call and the owner again said there was a mistake with the online ordering company's website (idk why they insist on using them). He agreed to send a free vegetarian pizza. But he sent the smallest possible size although the original order was a large pizza.

In addition, I got charged both online and at the door by this place. I had to call again to fix the issue.

In addition to these logistical problems that won't end, the pizza is just not that good! It's bread-y and the toppings are not fresh nor abundant.

I don't ever plan to order from here again."}
{"text":"Not cheap but worth it compared to what's around the Yonge & Eglinton area.  One of top options for pizza and wings!! Picked up a 12in pizza and BBQ wings combo.  Pizza was delicious, perfectly baked (no disgusting fake tomato sauce like at Panago), so flavourful! And the wings were great too - I'm not a fan of BBQ but hubby was happy. 
Worth the price and time (pick up since delivery is $13). 
Will definitely return!!"}
{"text":"My favourite pizza place in midtown! Great prices for great pizza! And the cookies are YUM!"}
{"text":"An Italian Mom and Pop's pizza joint between Eglinton and Lawrence. Perfect for a quick bite or maybe some people watching on Yonge. The service is fast. You order and pay for food before sitting down. Not a sit-down and get served type of restaurant.

As for the pizza, there is A LOT of variety. I really like anything with ricotta and also the one with the red peppers. I would also recommend the sandwiches. Great value and you can fill your belly for less than $5! :)"}
{"text":"Amazing freshly made soup. Really nice pizza and place has a liquor liscense which is a bonus."}
{"text":"Pizza is bland and I've had cardboard that has more flavour than their pizza.
They claim they're open until midnight, but that's a lie. I went at 10pm to order a veal sandwich, they said no can do.

There was 5 people in the kitchen sitting around doing nothing, but apparently a sandwich was too much to ask for. But they offered me their stale tasteless pizza that has been sitting around all day.

Yeah no thank you, I'm never returning to this place."}
{"text":"Great pizza, great lasagna, great Greek salads. We have only ordered take out and have never been in-store but if I'm ever hungry near them, won't hesitate to go in."}
{"text":"Picked up 3 slices to heat up at home on a Saturday night. Counter staff was friendly and quick with service. Could see 6-8 drivers, cooks, and other staff in the back. This is a new location next door to the previous one. Brand new reno gives the place a clean and modern feel.

Louie's makes delicious pizza. Crust was the same on all 3 slices - thin with thicker edges and a nice gourmet flavour. They're large so I went with the folded approach when eating.

1 Mushrooms, Red Peppers and Goat's Cheese
Reminded me of Amato's Capri pizza which used to be a go-to of mine. First slice I had from Louie's and it was excellent. Could use chicken.

2 Pepperoni
Beautiful grease-wheel style Pepperoni slice. Simple and gets the details right. Cheese was chewy and stringy. Pepperoni coverage was uniform.

3 Spinach, Red Peppers and Feta Cheese 
Great veggie option and I don't normally get Feta Cheese, but it was good. 

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Best thin crust pizza with loads of toppings. Also love their salads, wings, sandwiches and lasagna. Great service and beautiful space!"}
{"text":"Awesome gourmet pizza place, especially if you are vegetarian! They serve by the slice, you can take-out order and the pizzas are very yummy. Tons of quality topping to choose from, goat cheese, red peppers, mushrooms that are not burnt and dry, eggplant, hot peppers. The dough they make is flat, thin, multi-grain, crunchy only at the crust."}
{"text":"I've had pizzas from here a couple times and I wasn't too impressed. The crust was slightly undercooked and had a thick coating of either flour or cornmeal on it that I found off putting.  Also off putting was the sauce that rendered the pizza too salty and out of balance.  Not many choices in this area, I tend to stick to Mammas Pizza or Pizzaiolo."}
{"text":"This place has decent pizza, but definitely not the best in the neighbourhood. Personally I think it's overrated. There was confusion in the pricing on the menu online, since there seems to be two different websites with different prices. Not the most positive experience, even when they ended up charging me more than what was listed on the online menu."}
{"text":"Whenever I'm even remotely in the area of Classicos, I cannot resist a couple of slices, especially the eggplant, or the sun dried tomato. The pizza crust is thin, crisp and the taste is fantastic...Unfortunately need to watch my weight so always skip breakfast or dinner just to eat here."}
{"text":"This place is the best! Cozy, really good food, and great service!! Love it here. Great place to bring the family."}
{"text":"I visited Classico with a friend after having a terrible experience at a local bar that was newly opened on Eglinton.  We had left the bar hungry and disappointed, and decided to come to Classico for a slice of pizza in order to satisfy our hunger.  The initial impression of Classico left me with a feeling of warmth, as it is a very inviting atmosphere.  With patrons sitting on their sunny patio enjoying the weather, we were just as happy and enjoy our food indoors.  They had their windows fully open with a very pleasant cool breeze flowing through the small restaurant.  Even though the prices were modest, the service was very impressive.  We ordered our slices and drinks, and they kind lady at the counter offered to bring our food and drinks to us when it was ready.  In total, I paid just under $7 for a slice of deluxe pizza and a can of Coke.  They also serve wine and beer, which is always a good companion to a tasty slice of pizza!  All of their pizza on display looks like delicious gourmet food, with fresh ingredients clearly being used.  The green peppers and mushrooms on my pizza were fresh and crunchy, not soggy and shriveled like most places.  I was really impressed with this place, and will most definitely be returning in the future!"}
{"text":"Try the new tomato-bocconcini sandwich - it's a mouthful of mozza-goodness! This is a great example of simple food - done well. Fresh tomatoes and a very generous helping of cheese served on a fresh french stick-style bun for only $3.95. It's actually cheaper than their pizza slices (which are also very good - they have a unique cornmeal crust and really creamy, salty goat's cheese) and a nice change when you want something really fresh and not re-heated.

The perfectly crispy crust surrounds soft bread, fresh tomatoes and olive oil spiced with basil, oregano and black pepper with so much perfect, gooey cheese that it was coming off in long, stretchy sumptuous strings with every bite.

Crispy but soft and gooey, savoury, sweet and tangy - it's a great lunch for a great price. Plus, you can enjoy it on their little outdoor patio and relish in the summer sun while enjoying free wifi - what more can a person want?  

My favourite place in the neighbourhood: I almost hate to share it, but it's a sin to keep it to myself."}
{"text":"Dropped in for lunch the other day.

Initially, it was overwhelming because they have a huge variety of pizzas. I ended up getting a slice of the ricotta-spinach-red pepper pizza. Heaps of toppings on a thin crust, this pizza was to die for. It's a little bit more expensive than your chain pizza joints, but very worth the quality you're getting. In spite of the small space, there is a seating area so you can get your pizza to go or to stay. Classico also has pasta, cookies, and wino on their menu.

Good for: quick meals, pizza parties"}
{"text":"Had been ordering pizza here for quite a while, until we received the worst service we have ever experienced (from anyone, not just restaurant). Unfortunately the food is not worth the poor service experienced. The delivery is often spotty and owner and employees do not stand behind their product. Will not be going here again."}
{"text":"I loved this pizza! Ordered takeout with friends on Friday night. Delivery took 30 or 40 minutes. We got pepperoni and hawaiian and both were delicious. The crust is on the thinner side but has a nice chewiness too. Meats tasted like good quality. Pineapple was cut into nice small pieces. Can't wait to order from here again!"}
{"text":"Classico's is a great italian dine-in/take-out restaurant halfway between Eglinton and Lawrence. During the non-Winter months, the front is opened up to create a large eating area including patio which brings in a nice breeze into the restaurant.

They have some great lunch specials. $8.85 for a hot lasagna with garlic bread. Or $2.50 will give you a good-sized salad to go with your slice of pizza The pizza slice was okay, the cheese was gooey and the crust was thin and soft, but it could use some more tomato sauce! At least it doesn't feel like my slice had been sitting too long. The salad was good - it's a whole bowl of romaine, with large croutons and parmesan cheese. I unfortunately haven't tried any of their soups, but definitely look forward to trying them in the Winter."}
{"text":"While expensive for pizzas Louie's never disappoint in taste.  They excel at making the most amazing vegetarian pizza.  The combinations thy come up with are incredible and delicious.  It's definitely my favorite pizza place in toronto."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, there is no way to give them this feedback on their website or I would have done it there instead.  My first time there tonight, I was served by a woman who coughed several times on her hands while taking the order before me.  When she went to get my slices, she used her hands to assist her in getting them out.  In addition, she was handling glasses of water for seated customers.  Ironically, there was a small sink right beside her. Too shocked/uncomfortable to say anything, I just paid and left, then threw the slices out."}
{"text":"Probably the best delivery option in the neighborhood. Personally I think sticking to the basics there is the best with the Pepperoni. Would stick to pizza though, the Veal Sandwich I had from there was disappointing. Wings are decent, but nothing special with all the other options in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Nowadays, Toronto is awash with \"authentic\" neapolitan pizza joints, promising personal pies of dinner plate size, for $15-$20 a hit. 

It may be authentic, but unless I'm in the mood it's just not pizza to me. 

Real Pizza is carved from a pie the diameter of my arm (I think it's diameter; I never was much for math). It features minimal exposed crust, golden and dappled with bubbles from baking. If the dough is clearly docked, I protest. 

It features judicious application of slightly acidic tomato sauce; still crimson red. 

A thin layer of mozzarel'. Not cheddar, not brick or swiss or 'Merican. 

Toppings? Go nuts, but you can't go wrong with pepperoni (the smaller the better, strewn with abandon across the pie's surface), mushrooms (just crinkled from the oven's heat, and green peppers (because they're for grown-ups). 

And it should fill me up for under $10. 

In short, it should be Louie's."}
{"text":"I have eaten here a couple of times recently thanks to Behrouz's suggestion and I must say I'm very pleased.
The dough of the takeout slices I've had is the best I've tried so far in Toronto (and by far!) The toppings and range of the veggie slices also leaves you wandering why no one else offers such toppings! So far I have really enjoyed the spinach, ricotta, red pepper and the eggplant, goat cheese, sun-dried tomato pizzas. 
I also tried an Italian sausage, mushroom and onion for takeout which was also tasty but a bit too salty for my taste! 
Overall an excellent option for pizza and I can't wait to try their sandwiches!"}
{"text":"I ordered pizza delivery, and I've been a regular customer. This time I ordered direct rather than through Just Eat or UberEATS.  They forgot to put Italian sausage on my pizza, which for me is as fundamental to pizza as cheese.  When I phoned to ask that they send just the Italian sausage so I could put it on myself, the guy refused, and instead offered a credit for the missed topping.  What am I going to do with a credit for a topping?  He then offered a small pizza.  I found that insulting, considering that I had ordered their largest Party size and fully loaded, so I asked that if he couldn't send the topping then at least give a credit for a large, and if necessary with fewer toppings than my original order.

Well they lost my business for good owing to their shortsightedness.  I can get a similar pizza and mostly organic at that, for a bit more money, delivered from Magic Oven instead - and those guys let me know that they did not have a certain topping, beef salami, so I could modify my order.

Subsequently the guy pretended that the person who had offered me the credit for the small pizza wasn't there, and he had no knowledge of it!  So I got nothing."}
{"text":"I don't get it guys. I really don't get it. 

Thought about getting a specialty pizza but there was more bang for a pizza and wings combo. I went with meaty toppings and BBQ wings. Added a few sodas and a cheesy garlic bread (curiosity).


Pizza- 2/5
The pepperoni was bland, the ground beef was a dry crumble, only the mushrooms tasted right. WTF happened here?

Wings- 3/5
Hard to mess up wings. These were good but no dipping sauce option (at least online) so I was BBQ out in no time.

Garlic Bread- 2/5
Meh. Totally meh. You can make these at home so save your money. Baguette + butter + melted cheese. Nothing special about any of the ingredients. Louie's should change the bread, this tasted like that midnight snack you make half asleep. 

That'll teach me to skip grocery day. LESSON LEARNT.


I RECOMMEND- Not believing the hype! Or that you try a lasagna cause the pizza is NOT it.

EXTRA TIP- $2 delivery fee via just-eat.ca"}
{"text":"I am a native New Yorker (not the city, but close enough to it that I feel myself entitled to be snobby about pizza). Having lived elsewhere in the US and in various places around the world, I have come to realize that the classic New York pizzeria pizza is a rare thing, very difficult to find outside of about a 100 mile radius of NYC.

So I can't tell you how freakin' excited I was to come across Louie's Classico right in my neighbourhood. It is honestly the BEST pizza, the closest thing to authentic NY pizzeria pizza, that I have had in Canada (after a 5 year search between TO and MTL). 

From a base that is done right, you can get gourmet pizza. But if the pizza itself is lacking, it doesn't matter what you put on top; it's still going to be mediocre. And this is why Louie's Classico is tops in my books!  So yes, they do gourmet well, but if you want to understand what I'm talking about with authentic pizzeria pizza, go in and try a plain slice (and by \"plain\" I mean just cheese):

The crust is a perfect thickness--just enough to get a good crispy bite on the bottom and some saucy dough at the second layer. They also coat the dough with cornmeal which adds just a bit more flavour and texture to the crust. It's so good that I will finish the crust my husband discards (he's Canadian and doesn't have quite the same obsession with pizza I have!). The sauce hits that perfect spot where it's not too sweet, not too acidic and not overwhelmed with spices. It's just right. And the cheese is fired to the optimal level with some spots browned and crispy and the rest soft and stringy. It's all about balance. To me, it's not that Louie's is \"gourmet\"; it's just GOOD.

In my opinion, pizza's always best from the place itself. The atmosphere at Louie's is just what you want a family-style pizzeria to be--laid back and casual (think: paper plates and a TV). But ordering in is also essential with pizza, and delivery from Louie's is still pretty excellent. I always go back to the plain when I want that taste of New York, but their range of toppings is fantastic--something for everyone! All that's missing is the little cups of Louie's Italian Ice that you eat with a wooden spoon :)

So there it is: 5 stars from this pizza-picky New Yorker!"}
{"text":"Pizza is yummy no question but ordering in is difficult because nothing stays warm. Unfortunately to make things worse, when you call to complain they aren't prepared to do anything for you. Most they were willing to do for us was give us a $2 credit. Great thanks. That'll get us a fresh and hot new pizza no question."}
{"text":"Came in here today for pizza. I have to say that they definitely have some of the best pizza in the city. I love the Greek salad. Mmmmm. Would definitely recommend this place.
