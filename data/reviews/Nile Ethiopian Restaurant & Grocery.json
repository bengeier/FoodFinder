{"text":"This was my first time eating Ethiopian food and I must say that it was a wonderful experience. My girlfriend (who has had Ethiopian food many times before) and I went while visiting Charlotte and we are very glad we found this place. From the outside it looks like just a grocery store but don't let that fool you. Inside in the back is seating and the woman that cooked and helped us was so wonderful and kind. I don't like very spicy food and she tweaked some of her recipes to accommodate my tastes. We had had the Tibia and the Shiro and both were absolutely amazing. The meat was tender and cooked to perfection and the Shiro had such great flavor. The injera was so good and cooked with love (as was everything). After dinner she recommended a tea (cardamom I believe) and it was a great way to finish off the meal. I was so happy with this meal. And my girlfriend also said it was one of the best Ethiopian experiences she has had.    I would recommend this place to anyone wanting to try Ethiopian here in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Seriously good food at this hole in the wall. It's the real deal. The dining area is in the back of a convenient-store-sized grocery where a number of interesting items can be found. The meals are made to order and drinks can be bought in the store front, but I would recommend the tea with your meal. The lady running the joint is very kind and accommodating even with her limited English. Would definitely come back.  The take away: If you're looking for an experience, you'll definitely find it here."}
{"text":"Great tiny place. Service was far above average from the wonderful women who were also preparing our food. Great find for authentic food!"}
{"text":"My wife & I felt we had dropped into a shop in any  Ethiopian town. We were greeted by the sweet smile of the proprietor & cook of this delightful place. The food was excellent. Our coffee was hand roasted as we waited, it smelled so good! We will be back."}
{"text":"Small restaurant with great food and incredibly friendly service. Highly recommend checking it out"}
{"text":"Amazing! Best Ethiopian food I have ever had. Family owned. Outstanding service. The veggie platter was outstanding."}
{"text":"Dear all Charlotteans, If you are searching for a dynamic, tasteful, ethnic dining experience: you have got to try Tigay's food. I ordered standard dishes: Beef Tibs, and Kitfo.  As someone who comes from an Ethiopian household: it is rare to come across someone who can bring the authentic  taste of DELICIOUS home cooking to the restaurant table. The display was amazing, the flavors explosive and unforgettable. If you want Ethiopian food, you are doing yourself a disservice by not coming here. My tastebuds are still dancing  from the spices.   Absolutely phenomenal, I'm hooked. Most def a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Just got another takeout today, and Nile's food is still very tasty and well-prepared. Definitely a place to try if you like Ethiopian."}
{"text":"If you haven't been to Nile Grocery and Cafe, you're missing out.  All their dishes are delicious!  My favorites are beef tibs and the vegetarian combo.  Everything is prepared to your taste - as mild or spicy as you like. Their injera is addicting!  It's a type of spongy bread made with a super grain called teff, which is high in protein, iron, and fiber.  Break off a piece and use it to scoop up the flavorful stews and vegetables.  The portions are huge.  You will have enough to bring home and enjoy a meal of left-overs. This place is a small restaurant where you are treated like family. Their service and hospitality are excellent.  I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This is the best customer service and food in town the people will sit and talk with you as if you all were old friends. The BEST part is that they are a big part of the community helping develop and improve peoples lives that need help. I was introduced to them by a close friend with there involvement in the community and i made sure to check them out......I want to thank them and everyone who is going here to build up community in charlotte.  POSITIVEGOODLIFE"}
{"text":"Amazing family owned restaurant and grocery.  Will bend over backwards for their customers. Always feel super welcome, best beef tibs in charlotte and nicest staff. The husband, wife, and son who run it are charming and so friendly. 10/10. Their card reader doesn't include a tip line, so bring cash to tip. There is also a small selection of ethiopian/ eritrean groceries and coffee pots."}
{"text":"Definitely a hole in the wall...but one that you'll want to find yourself in.   The food is tasty. They have a simple, one page menu - and by one page, I mean there is literally one sheet of paper floating around. At first my husband and I ordered 2 servings of the veggie combo. One was definitely plenty, but I think because the other Ethiopian restaurants in town have you order two, I was conditioned. One order to share will fill you up. The $9 veggie combo included the red lentils, yellow cabbage, and collard greens. The injera is very, very good. They don't serve glasses of water, so grab a bottle from the front of the store and bring it with you.  Yes, the front of the store is a small grocery section. You can pick up some spices, rice, flour while you're here.  The dining space is very small, perhaps 4-5 tables. On both occasions that I've visited here, the place is full of other diners chatting it up or grabbing a quick bite. The service is friendly.  Make the drive out this way for a tasteful plate full of spice. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Wonderful food cooked and served by the nicest sweetest lady ever!  She helped our family - some newbies to Ethiopian food- pick out just the right dishes. Thank you for a wonderfully perfect lunch!!!"}
{"text":"Very small restaurant, only 4 tables. What I like:  - The owners are very, very nice and helpful.  -  The menu during the week is very simple, with half a dozen choices all for less than 10$. - The food is of outstanding quality. - Kitfo with raw meat  - Great coffee  Be prepared to wait a bit as the food is prepared from scratch. On the weekend they will have other typical choices as Zigni and Doro Wat."}
{"text":"Do not judge this place from the outside, or you will miss some of the best vegetarian food in Charlotte.  The couple that run this plan are a testament to families moving here to make a new life. They are some of the hardest working people I've ever met and they take their grocery and their food preparation very seriously.  You want fresh meat?  There was an endless stream of folks coming to buy their raw beef tibs to make at home.  But if you look around the corner, you'll see three to four sets of benches where you get to eat the good stuff.  The menu is limited to the veggie combo and beef tibs.  No doro wat here, but that's honestly ok.  The veggie combo is the most amazing 10 dollars you will spend and even with two people sharing it, will fill you up most happily.  But the clincher is the female owner makes sure you know what you're eating, how to eat it, and most importantly, that you enjoy it.  They don't treat you as a customer, you are family.  What more can you ask for?  Oh one thing that needs to be addressed, none of the hours and dates for the Ethiopian restaurants in the area are correct.  Please call them to be sure"}
{"text":"Great Ethiopian Food!  Great Service!  They are making dishes to order so you can call ahead if you know what you want!  Vegetarian and Meat Dishes!  Today I enjoyed the Beef Tibs, ordered Medium Spicy, it was about perfect!  POPROCK!  Injera (I think here they may have spelled it with an \"E\" ...Sour, Soft, Highly Porous Bread served under your food and used to pick up your food instead of using a utensil... She said she makes her own!  I have never been a fan of the Bread and I have eaten about a dozen times at three different Restaurants, counting today.  This one is the BEST I have eaten so far!  Timatim sounds like the name of someones \"Spiritual son\" though it is a Tomato Salad!  They called it something else here... The language barrier was enough to make it enjoyable, I got everything I wanted and got to use more vocabulary than usual which was nice!  Timatim Fit Tit is served with Injera and I have been served where it was rolled up in the bread like a fat Burrito!  Timatim is one of my Favorite Salads in the world and this one it FANTASTIC!  First rule of a Rod0 salad is to spell it Zalad and leave the lettuce out!!!  Timatim dose NOT Ever call for lettuce!  Everyone makes Timatim it a little differently, using most of the same ingredients in slightly different proportions... If I understood correctly the Oil part of the Salad is a Dressing from Germany!  \"What\" I asked???  Where? \"Did you say Germany\"?  Yes Germany!!! !! !  Whoa!  Tomato, Peppers, Red Onion, Lemon and a Dressing from Germany!  This one is FANTASTIC!  In a dead heat for First place!  If you want this dish you may have to describe it if they do not know it by name!  Looking Forward to the next meal here to check out the Vegetarian Dishes!"}
{"text":"Delicious food!! We had the Tibis dish which was amazing. Family owned business, husband and wife. They were so welcoming and friendly. Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Wow, amazing food. I have a food baby and it is totally worth it. I am so glad that we came here. Great service and wonderful food. Come here you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I have been a regular of this wonderful place for about 5 years now and have had everything on the menu at one point or another!  The owner and chef, Tsige, is a warm host. She makes everything to order, so not only is your food organic and healthy, it's also guaranteed to be fresh. The down side of this of course is that it may take a little longer to prepare.  The food and experience are truly authentic, as evidenced by the many Ethiopians who frequent the restaurant. Some of my favorites:  * Veggie combo (a delicious combination of collard greens, lentils, cabbages, carrots, potatoes, and any other delights Tsige may throw in.   * kitfo: a spicy beef tar tar, ground beef  * tibs: wonderful marinated beef tips  All of the above served on this wonderful spongy bread (injera), which gives it a great flavor contrast and balance.   The place is small and cozy and definitely off the beaten path,  but you won't regret the drive.   For the coffee lovers, nothing that beats Ethiopian coffee! Ask Tsige  for the coffee ceremony - she'll roast the coffee beans right in front of you and let you take in the aroma.  Enjoy your experience - and don't be surprised if you find yourself addicted to this wonderful cuisine!! :)"}
{"text":"Whether you're a world traveler or just a food adventurer looking for something new, both Ethiopian food and Nile Ethiopian Restaurant and Grocery will satisfy your tastebuds.   Don't be scared by the outside facade or the foreignness of it all, because hidden inside this hole in the wall is friendly service and great ethnic food at an affordable price. Our party of 4 ordered bottled waters, the Veggie Combo, and the Tibis which, with the injera, was enough to fill us up for just $25. The lady who served us was very friendly and eager to explain any questions we had. Although they do not have a large menu, each item is somewhat broken down into what they obtain. I won't go into the complexities of Ethiopian food, but this meal was an enjoyable experience in both taste and service.  I would love to come back and try out their other options at his hidden gem."}
{"text":"A very nice family runs this place. The food was wonderful. The mother used oil instead of butter for those of us who are lactose intolerant. I especially loved every single part of the veggie sampler, although everything we'd ordered was delicious. Unfortunately I don't live in Charlotte, or else I'd come eat here all the time!"}
{"text":"The best Ethiopian food this side of Addis Abba!  A real hole in the wall. I wouldn't have noticed this place if I wasn't specifically looking for it. My mother and I were on a quest to find some authentic Ethiopian coffee. They had it, but only in the green, unroasted form. Unfortunately, I don't have a coffee roaster, so I had to pass.  The location is cut into two sections. The front is a Ethiopian general store. They sell ingredients for Ethiopian food, DVDs, soda, exotic spices, and kitchen gadgets to make your flat bread on.  The back area is a restaurant. Their menu is literally one page, for the entire restaurant. If someone else is looking it over, you're going to have to wait. There's only about 5 things to choose from, so it's not a big decision.  We had cabbage and onions, served with collard greens, and beans, all served on a large piece of flat bread. We had to have the waitress explain what we were having, since the menu descriptions are rather loosely worded, and mainly in Ethiopian. The food was heavily spiced, and delicious. The beans had a delicious smoky flavor, and the cabbage had some sort of yellow hot spice on them.  The staff was incredibly pleasant and helpful, but with rather limited English. They were alarmed when they saw that the Coca-Cola was 'beyond the expiration date,' and insisted that we not drink it. I've never paid attention to the Coke expiration dates stamped on the bottom of the can.  The place was rather clean, and they showed Ethiopian movies on the TV set.  I'd definitely recommend checking this place out for a culinary adventure."}
{"text":"This is the best place in NC to get Ethiopian food.  I drove an hour and half from Winston Salem just to try it.   It was definitely worth the drive."}
{"text":"Hands down the BEST Ethiopian Restaurant in Charlotte, NC! Wonderful family owned business with authentic food and great service! It can't get better than this!"}
{"text":"Nile Ethiopian Restaurant has some of the best food I've had in Charlotte. The staff were kind, helpful, and went above and beyond to explain the dishes and the customs surrounding them. Long story short: go whenever you get a chance.  Nile is in a strip mall with a few other stellar food destinations, such as La Shish Kabob and Golden Bakery a bit further down. Don't walk past it. When first walking in, you mostly see the grocery side of the location and you have to ask to be seated. There was no one else but family of the owners when we went in, but they welcomed us warmly and kindly as we asked about the menu.  We ended up splitting the veggie platter (only 9.99!) and that was more than enough for the both of us. The owner kindly helped us navigate through each element on the plate (two lentil based dishes, a cabbage/potato/carrot combination, a chickpea based dish, and a mix of greens) and offered to help us with the etiquette and process of eating the food. As another reviewer said, when you are here, you are family. Both my friend and I were charmed by the kindness of the owners and we both absolutely loved the food. When I first decided I wanted to try Ethiopian food, I spent quite some time considering which Charlotte place to go to and after the experience at Nile, I don't think I'll go anywhere else."}
