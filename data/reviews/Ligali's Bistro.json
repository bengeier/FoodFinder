{"text":"So...I got a groupon for this restaurant and I couldn't wait to go and try it out, but I was utterly disappointed.   We arrived @6:45 for our 7pm reservations...finally got seated at 7:30.    The drink I ordered at 7:20 didn't arrive to my table until 7:55pm.  I ordered the pork chops, which weren't cooked to my specifications.  My partner order the mussels but couldn't eat them because they were too salty.  We decided to go on a limb and order the preach cobbler which was very doughy and obvious that canned peaches were used...I paid $29 for the groupon that would cover $50 worth of food...my total bill was $27 (after all the deductions for sub par service and food) :( lost $2.  Wouldnt recommend"}
{"text":"Place is cool as hell on the inside. I got the salmon, it was cooked perfectly and the sauce was outstanding, the vegetables are fresh, and the sticky white rice complemented it perfectly. salad with mixed greens also fresh the dressing was perfect. Peach cobbler was killer."}
{"text":"The service was fine and the drinks were mediocre for the price. I ordered the burger (medium), it was not medium and it was clearly a frozen patty they grilled up. It was about the size of a McDonald's cheese burger. The \"frites\" were okay - not like the delicious ones i've had at upscale restaurants. My husbamd ordered the wings and a caesar salad - both of those were okay. Sauce on the wings did taste good. Ended the night with a 50 dollar bill for a McDonald's cheeseburger and fries and a few wings and a salad. Way over priced for the quality of the food. Would not go back."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this new restaurant in Tremont,  heard nothing but good things about this place. The chef is well known around the city for his food and my wife and I was looking forward to indulge in the experience. Being a chef myself I expect certain things to be done correctly. Sadly the service was mediocre, servers didnt know anything about how the food is prepared or cooked. I ordered the mussels as my appetizer that was suppose to come with frits and a aioli dipping sauce. What I got was frozen deep fried fries not hand cut and instead of a aioli (fancy word for flavored homemade mayonnaise) I received ketchup...  For my entree I was intrigued to get the lamb chops(more like lamb bites). I specifically told my server that I'm allergic to the red wine in the sauce and the they served me the sauce anyway... we sent the dish back and told the staff that I didn't want anything in replace of my meal...  The so owner I guess then insulted my intelligent by saying that they redid my meal from scratch. Remember that this is all of 5mins of me sending the dish back to the kitchen for her to tell me they remade lamb chops to a medium temperature.  Omg, what was most disappointing was the fact that EVERYTHING on this menu was frozen, nothing fresh or made from scratch and I'm sorry that's not being a chef by cutting corners like this... Come on where's the passion that got you to this point. I was embarrassed and appalled by the lack of knowledge to running a business and for the price your charging for this frozen product doesn't match up at all... I left and went to the Tree house to have the most amazing burger I've eaten in a while! Great food there! I strongly suggest if your a foodie don't even bother trying this place unless your drinking and drinking only..."}
{"text":"Love this place! The atmosphere is very nice and upscale. I had the Thai wings, and fried green tomatoes. Everything was delicious. I'll definitely go back!"}
{"text":"The food is expensive and comes in small portions. My party and I were waiting on our food for about an our, only to find out that the oven broke. I had high hopes but it wasn't worth it."}
{"text":"One star? .... Well for playing music at a highly audible level to rupture eardrums, to upset the local residents, and of course to attract inebriated clientele from the Ale Fest across the street.  I must have missed the motion for a noise permit in the monthly block club meeting. Thanks for perpetuating the decline of civilization.  But I do \"hear\" when the music not loud lol,  their food is unique and nice.......ps please don't play the song \"Happy\""}
{"text":"This restaurant serves American cuisine. The food and service were okay. I'm going to have to try them again next year to see if things improve as this is a new restaurant."}
{"text":"My husband and I dined at Ligali's Bistro yesterday. We had a really great experience. The food was awesome, the drinks were divine, and the view of the park was spectacular. We had crab cakes to start followed by salmon and lamb chops, they were all delicious. I highly recommend Ligali's Bistro."}
{"text":"Went in with very low expectations due to the previous reviews. After all was said and done, we really enjoyed our entire experience at this restaurant. The cocktails were delicious. Especially the cucumber basil martini recommended by our server. Service was very good as well. our appetizer, the scallop BLT, was great. Scallops were cooked perfectly and it was a solid balance of flavors. I had the lamb entrée while my girlfriend had the salmon. The lamb was cooked perfectly although could've used slightly more seasoning. The blackened salmon was very good but a little overdone. all in all we would go back in a heartbeat and definitely plan on doing so soon. Despite the previous reviews, give this place a try."}
{"text":"I forgot to mention n my previous post that our waitress Bria was amazing. She was very attentive n kind n has a beautiful spirit. When going to Ligali's ask for Bria n u will get excellent service. N don't forget tell them Veronica sent u."}
{"text":"Never got to try the food.  Never got any service.  Just returned form a trip, and thought I would treat myself to a nice meal in  a neighborhood restaurant I haven't tried.  Hostess seemed confused that I was ALONE, and I should have just given up then.  Sadly, I chose a table, ASKED for the wine list, and began my wait.  In the fifteen minutes I sat awkwardly at my table, no one said hello, no one brought me water, no one acknowledged me.  When the waitress ( who seemed to be the only wait staff) had crossed the room a few times, carefully avoiding making eye contact with me, and the hostess had found time to bus a table and adjust her hair in the mirror, but no time to check on me, or bring water, or reassure me that someone would take my order, or tell me that she was sorry but they wouldn't be able to find the time or energy to serve me a meal, I left.  I told the hostess in my fury that I had been waiting fifteen minutes, \"Oh, she must not have seen you there.\"  Oh, right, my fault completely.  Sorry that I simply sat at my table.  Ligali, you get one chance to make a good first impression.  Your hostess and waitress made it clear that my business isn't valued -- so I won't burden you again with an attempt at patronage.  Ever."}
{"text":"I had the Salmon for $20 and it was tasty.  Nothing spectacular but it was executed well and the presentation was adequate.  The service was way less than acceptable.  I came because I once visited the church that Chef Eric Wells attends and thought I'd give his restaurant a try.  Well Eric I hope next time I visit I can have a better experience."}
{"text":"This was our second time at Ligali Bistro. The first experience was not good. We found the food mediocre. The drinks are good though. The service was excellent. The crab cakes were disappointing--I could not find any evidence of crab meat. Our second visit was a few weeks ago. The food was much better this time around. I did enjoy my meal of duck. Again, the drinks were great. The crab cakes were improved, but still mediocre. The service this time was not as good. Our waiter put our check on the table and we were only half way through the meal. When I spend over $100 for dinner, I expect the check to be brought when we are finished. Very rude. I am not sure I we will go again. I would certainly not recommend it to a friend. I hope this was an isolated incident. We live in the neighborhood, and it would be a very convenient restaurant to visit occasionally. We might give it another chance in a few months time."}
{"text":"went w/ 2 friends. staff was friendly but we wouldn't return. had wild mushroom flatbread appetizer - just ok, lacked flavor. .burger was very good but served w/ what appeared to be frozen shoe string fries. has to ask server for ketchup,  salt & pepper, long wait most of meal eaten by the time condiments received. Restaurant has a hodgepodge feel to it, not sure if it's trying to be French or Italian. Feel sort of bad writing this b/c we got the impression the staff & management is trying hard, but they need to improve service & flavor of food."}
{"text":"I hate to leave a bad review but have to do it this time. I was excited to try this cute new restaurant in Tremont, but the food was so disappointing. I had the halibut, which was somehow cooked to be chewy on the outside. Not pleasant. It had very little flavor; the lime-butter sauce on top didn't do anything for it. I had asparagus and wild rice as sides. I would venture to say that the wild rice was straight-up Uncle Ben's. The asparagus was the most disappointing thing on the plate - it was thick and very yellowed. Clearly very old, bad quality asparagus. I was amazed they served it.  The boyfriend had the lamb chops, also with the Uncle Ben's but with a decent sautéed vegetable medley. His lamb chops had good flavor but were poorly cooked. No sear on them at all, which is a cardinal lamb chop sin in my book. Also not the requested medium temperature.  Probably won't be back, which is so sad because I so wanted to support a local Clevelander (the chef is from around here and trained at a local culinary school). Overall, the food seemed like it was prepared in advance, with a lot of shortcuts and not much attention to quality, something that the restaurant's website and decor seem to advertise."}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVED this spot. We are crab cakes, shrimp, and bruschetta. The good was great, drinks were amazing and food was on point."}
{"text":"Stopped by Ligali's Bistro for happy hour last week and this place rocked.  The restaurant itself has a cool trendy vibe that is perfect for Tremont.  The staff was knowledgeable and friendly.    We had the Fried Green Tomatoes for apps and drank some killer Dark and Stormy's. The other drinks on the menu looked good, but the Dark and Stormy was too good not try a second one.  Happy Hour Prices weren't bad. I would definitely recommend giving this place a shot."}
{"text":"I chose Ligali's for the location of my boyfriend's 60th birthday dinner and I am SO GLAD I DID!!! I CANNOT possibly, adequately express here how awesome our experience was. We received stellar service from our hilarious and attentive server, Jeremy, who helped make the evening unforgettable. And also, we received great hospitality from the talented and efficient Chef Gerald, who honored all of our special requests with great cheer. Gerald and Jeremy were both remarkably accommodating and welcoming! THANK YOU GUYS SO MUCH!!!       Our somewhat loud and um, unorthodox party of seven enjoyed the privacy of the very little room in back of the restaurant. The room is very small, but sort of made us feel like we had the whole place to ourselves! I'd recommend this space to anyone for intimate gatherings, as they even let us spice it up with candles and our own music!        The food was excellent and we enjoyed a large variety different offerings. A few of the favorites were the wings, mussels and bruschetta flatbread. We washed them down with several bottles of wine, which Jeremy was very timely with, and that was a favorite as well for SURE!        They allowed us to bring in a cake and they presented it dramatically by turning off the lights in the room first before making the entrance. The sparkler candles (I brought) made this surprise one of the highlights of the night and led to multiple rounds of boisterous singing.          A round of coffees (brewed ingeniously by Jeremy, who improvised for a broken coffee maker by brewing it in the iced tea maker - NICE JOB! Thanks!) and a round of whiskeys brought this extraordinary evening to it's dreaded end. We will DEFINITELY BE BACK!! Thanks again to Jeremy, Gerald and the Ligali's team for a great night that we'll be raving about for years!"}
{"text":"We went on a Thursday night,  830p, had the dining room to ourselves. We got the scallop BLT appetizer. It was gone in 4 bites, but delicious nonetheless. She had the special, goat cheese stuffed pork chop. I'm not a pork chop fan but it looked great and she enjoyed it. I had the salmon, which was great. I really liked the vegetables that came with, rice was great too. Thoroughly enjoyed the experience,  will be back."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was nice, the service was good, and the food I picked has me thinking about going back the same week. I had the crab cakes and fried green tomatoes for starters, then the Salmon for my entree and finished with Peach Cobbler. Everything was very good except the cobbler.  Outside the cobbler, the only constructive criticism I have is the menu is not a French theme at all, but the server told us it is a French restaurant.  Whatever the case, I will be back for the food that I had and the prices were very good."}
{"text":"'Words can't express...' but for you guys I will try to describe the experience my husband and I received at Ligali's Bistro and do it justice!  I will pre-face this to say that it took awhile..a loong while for us to venture to Ligali's.  Honestly, their earlier Yelp reviews were frightening and I had ZERO desire to test the waters.   Marketing IS definitely the key to this restaurant game.  Unbeknownst to me I was slowly being woo'ed by Ligali's.  How? Do you ask...  First I noticed them on Groupon offering $29 for $50 worth of food.  That peeked my interest but the bad reviews had a stronger grip on me so I scrolled past those Groupon offers on many...many occasions.  Next I began to notice their presence on Instagram.  Enticing little pics of wings covered in some delectable sauce and the 2 (ok 3) words I love to see...'Happy Hour prices'!   Lol!  So what?! I'm cheap..but I prefer the word frugal ok? .    So this information/subliminal marketing has been filed in the back of my mind and when the time came for me to figure out a dinner spot not too far from the Wolstein Center, my mind thought of Ligali's!      On 2/12/15, BaeHubby (BH) as my husband will now be known as, headed to Ligali's Bistro for a pre- Charlie Wilson concert meal.  As we sat outside the establishment, I remembered the Groupon offer..#djm and bought it on the spot.  We headed into Ligali's on the bar side of the restaurant. Seating consisted of high tables and chairs and bar stool accommodations.  At the time there were only a few other patrons in the space so BH and I chose the bar.  Our server/bartender quickly explained Happy Hour offerings both meals and drinks.  I heard him mention something about peach and told him yes I'd like one of those cocktails please and thank you. Lol.  He glided (yes glided) off to prepare it while we mulled over the menu.  Our bartender, who will now be known as Ricky, came back with my beverage and my BH some ginger ale and water.  We placed an order for the crab cakes with aioli sauce and the tomato bruschetta flatbread for starters.  As we sat chatting, Chef Eric Wells (Executive Chef at Ligali's) breezed in the door with groceries.  He proceeded to speak to each of the patrons in the space including BH and I.  He spoke to us in a manner similar to that of the other patrons and I said 'Ummm you know we go to the same church as you do right?'  He chuckled and said of course he recognized us.  A few more words were exchanged and he breezed back out of the establishment, promising the room that we were in good hands.  And guess what??  He was right!   After our appetizers were delivered I noticed another couple a few stools down had ordered the wings.  They looked even better in person y'all so I hailed Ricky and asked that he add those to our order.  I couldn't believe we had forgotten to order the wings!  Foolish mortals!!   So back to the food... The crab cakes... Omgee!  The crunchy crust, the lump crab meat, the sauce?! Shet up! Divine!  I didn't want to share them with BH but I did.  A little piece. :). He stated the bruschetta was just as good.  I didn't want to try it because I didn't want to mess with my mouthgasm that was occurring.  The wings arrived and after 1 bite I started my happy chair dance!  I do that when good food is involved.  After the appetizers we ordered the Cajun Pasta with chicken, andouille sausage and shrimp.  I was planning to split the order with BH as we both were pretty full off the apps.  The Cajun Pasta arrived and as Ricky sat it down, I asked him for an extra plate so I could share with BH.  This is the great service part y'all... Ricky ALREADY had the extra plate in hand!   Yasss!!!   Great service ANTICIPATES your needs and doesn't wait for you to ask for something.  I fell for Ricky right then and there.  Lol  I had already noticed his work ethic as it SHINED throughout the dinner.  He polished glasses..he polished silverware before he laid them out on our freshly splayed placemats. The bar area was immaculate.  He was never too far (but also not too close) as to not hear if we needed anything.  This guy was Amazing!   I asked how long he had worked at Ligali's and he said 4 months.  I told him he did his job VERY well and that I was IMPRESSED!   Good help is hard to find so I hope Chef Wells keeps this young man on for a VERY long time.   After our dinner, Ricky was right there with the bill.:). I gave him my phone with the Groupon certificate on it and he brought me back the adjusted amount.  The Groupon brought our bill down to just over $12!  Since we had a budget of $60 for dinner and due to Ricky's amazing service he ended up with an almost $20 tip.    I posted about my wonderful experience on Instagram and Facebook and now I have the opportunity to post it here!  Chef Wells and his staff have obviously worked VERY hard at turning those negative reviews into a dining experience worth bragging about.     Great Job Ligali's Bistro!!!   The Savol'"}
{"text":"Horrible service. We waited over 30 mins and hadn't received anything but water....and there was only one other table there. We finally walked out after complaining to the ONLY sever in the building. #FAIL"}
{"text":"The sooner this place goes out of business, a better place the world will be.  The wait staff is poorly trained and indifferent which makes you want to run out of the place moments after you sit down.    The menu is supposedly \"asian inspired\"  but putting soy sauce on something doesn't make it anything other than more salty...probably to hide the lousy quality of the food.  There is nothing on the menu that I haven't seen anywhere else nor is there anything on it that I couldn't make myself.  I imagine the owner just took a bunch of recipes out of a stack of back issues of  Food and Wine from last century given how boring panko crusted anything is in 2014, tried them two or three times and declared himself a chef.  I see he's won a lot of awards which just means that our standards for rewarding achievement have fallen apart.  Save your money and go elsewhere.....anywhere."}
{"text":"I truly wanted to make this place a new go-to since I live in the neighborhood but that's not going to happen.  We didn't get off to a good start--we waited by the empty hostess stand for awhile before giving up and taking a bar table.  Beer list was nonexistent, wine choices were sub-par and cocktails still seemed too summery for a cold November day.  Overall menu was underwhelming--nothing jumped out as a must-have or an interesting choice.  When I go out to eat I prefer to order things I can't have at home but herb crusted chicken, honey and soy salmon and a pork chop aren't anything special.  I'm not sure how to classify Ligali's--their food identity is unclear.    We ordered the crab cakes as a starter and they were fairly decent but didn't taste the \"red chili\".  Husband had the Ligali's burger which wasn't impressive and overcooked.  I ordered the Asian Peanut Noodles and added shrimp after seeing a different guest do the same.  The spaghetti-style noodles came out coated in a thick but soupy peanut sauce which tasted fine, but on the bland side.  It could have used some spice.  Vegetables consisted of raw broccoli with a few thinly cut peppers.  I ate the whole dish and things were mediocre until the bill arrived.  Adding shrimp tacked on $14.  Seriously, 5 shrimp drove up my meal to a whooping $30.  I asked the server if it was a mistake because surely it couldn't be right.  He said he got the price from the owner and there was no adjustment.  Had I known that prior to ordering, I would've taken my business to the upscale thai restaurant down the street for a much better version of the dish.  Oh well, what's done is done.  I had already eaten the whole thing; we paid our bill and went about our night.  I'm disappointed because I really wanted to like the place but have no intention to return when there are so many other options in Tremont."}
{"text":"Great happy hour and dinner. Scallop BLT was great as was the French onion soup. Bartender was amazing!"}
{"text":"Went Friday before Christmas. Liked the intimate seating and the decor. Nice menu. Had the Caesar salad and beet salad for starters. Very good except the two slices of beets were skimpy on a mound of Arugula. The orange slices were a sweet touch. The mussels were good. But we've had more favorable ones elsewhere. The special was OX Tail with African spices on Couscous. Delicious. A hardy portion and I took half home. Definitely try Ligalis. There is a nice bar area for meeting friends and happy hour."}
