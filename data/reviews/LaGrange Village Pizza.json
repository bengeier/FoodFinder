{"text":"We dined in and had the Philly Cheesesteak Pizza. By far the best Philly Cheese Steak pizza I've ever had and I've tried several other places.  Their steak was excellent (not cheap steak) and the cheese sauce was very good. Their fried pickles are also excellent!  You can tell they are homemade and are not frozen from a box.  The service was great and the entire staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"This place absolutely rocks. If you're passing through lagrange, do yourself a favor and get some pie. The staff is dynomite and the pizza will not disappoint."}
{"text":"Very happy with our experience, pleasant environment and friendly staff. Food was fast and tasted amazing. Only thing weird is they sell pop by the can or 2 liter."}
{"text":"Travelling and tasting unique restaurants has been my passion for a long time.  Pizza, an American classic, is one thing that I can gauge any city by.  For the most part in most of the metro areas I visit where the chain restaurants are plentiful by the dozen, I seek out the unique flavors of the city.  Upon recommendation I stopped at Village Pizza.  Not only was the service personal and friendly, the prices were very reasonable and the menu simple (THANK YOU FOR THAT!)  As we waited we were treated very well and provided water during our wait.  Staff personalized this visit, and we felt very respected and valued as customers.  The pizzas came out and the boxes were heavy - the first sign that I was going to be delighted with this meal!!  They were gracious and very pleasant.  I took the pies home and the entire family of seven were completely delighted - these were REAL pizzas!!!  Not some commercially prepared, skimpy, bland pizza - these were homemade and DELICIOUS!!  So good, in fact, that several teenagers and adults could not finish three pies!  We ended up taking them home with us!  More than 400 miles and two days separated us from the actual original purchase and the leftovers WERE STILL AMAZING!!!  I recommend going out of your way to try their pies - even my father who would never want to eat a pizza LOVED THEM.  I cannot tell you how high a compliment that is!!!!  I cannot wait to go back!!!  Keep doing what you are doing Village Pizza!  OH! - and PS:  PLEASE try their fried green beans!!!  Never had having them before I loved them so much and especially with the dip which came with it.  Everything at this store comes highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"okay we found a good place for wings since moving nearby! Loved the hot garlic wings. Done well. I hate when wings are raw or rubbery. These were perfect and meaty too. Pizza was very good. We will order again!"}
{"text":"Great pizza, great service.   When we moved to the Lagrange area, our search began for great pizza, and great Chinese food. We have found them both. Village Pizza was such a nice surprise. Their crust, sauce and toppings are wonderful. We just love their meatballs. The service here is always so good. Everyone is friendly, from the counter staff to the delivery people, to the servers. We have had a few things on their menu, and order pizza from there at least a couple of times a month. I just can't wrap my head around how that place down the road keeps winning awards. This is clearly superior pizza."}
{"text":"Can I give them minus stars.  No....well this is a poor pizza company.  So do they deliver in the time they say...NO they don't.  When they fail to deliver in the promised time and you cancel the order cause they failed do they say I'm sorry and do anything...NO.  in fact the delivery boy thinks when he is sent out to deliver as part of his job description that he is doing it out of free will...your being paid it's what you do and you need to do it in a timely fashion.  I suggest anyone before ordering from these folks Google 1) the worst Wal-Mart in America, and 2) yours is a very bad hotel.  Because Village Pizza in Lagrange Ohio is right up their with those 2 of the Worst.  And I will make sure they are out of business for not caring about or delivering on their basic most simple job, if getting pizza's to people in a timely manner."}
{"text":"I believe all the five star reviews must be from friends of the owners of this place. The pizza is terrible. I drive out of town to avoid it. There is way too much odd textured cheese on their pizza that turns to a half inch thick layer of rubber once it begins cooling."}
{"text":"The BEST!    Village Pizza has a wonderful & friendly staff who provide excellent service every time that we have been there (and that has been alot of times).  They remodeled their restaurant a couple of years ago & did a great job of creating a warm and friendly atmosphere.  And as I stated before their staff is always friendly and accomodating.  I have lived in LaGrange for years and Village Pizza is somewhere that the village should be very proud of.  By the way their food (pizza, etc) is awesome.  Very consistient & always good.  The BEST PIZZA around."}
{"text":"Just moved to LaGrange and wanted to give this a try. We really liked it, the taco pizza is like my mom's taco pie with pizza crust, It was delicious! And the boneless wings were really good too, we tried mild and sweet BBQ and liked them both, though the mild was a little hotter than I expected it still tasted yummy. Friendly and fast service but it is a little pricier than some chain pizza places. It was $45 for two mediums and an order of wings. So we won't be ordering frequently because of that reason only. Otherwise we love it and recommended it!"}
