{"text":"I don't know why this is four stars...
My food came out well before my partners. One might assume eggs benny on waffles would take less time than steak and eggs but maybe it was because when i asked for medium they gave it rare. The home fries looked like they were McCain fries and the eggs were bland. I had to send the steak back the first time. When the steak was cooked more (still under done), it was quite frankly disgusting. Not the seasoning per se but the meat was very bad. They said something is wrong with the supplier, so until it is resolved stay away. I took a bite and put it aside. 
The eggs benny... Well I mean wow these were terrible. The sauce was lackluster and strangely textured (congealed a bit?) on top of cooked centre poached eggs. The yolk should be runny. The waffle also tasted like it was out of a packet. I don't care if (cheap) food is store bought but it should have some pizzazz at least. 
The customer service could have been better. Maybe it was that she was new and the amount of tables were too much. She was friendly enough i suppose. 
Oh and the latte sucked. 

TL:dr terrible food.  Just ... Terrible"}
{"text":"Perfect place to hang out on a weekend. Good music,  people and food! Owner even offered to refill my coffee for free!"}
{"text":"Joseph prepares an excellent classic breakfast for $5.99, always happy to substitute items for more eggs and bacon!  After 3 visits, I'll be returning often for this well flavored and nicely priced breakfast, served all day.  Relaxed decor with free books to read, very friendly staff.  Highly Recommended!"}
{"text":"Walk past this small cafe/restaurant everyday on my way to work and decided to leave a little earlier for work one day to be able to stop and try this place out. The big garage door in front was open letting in great sunshine and fresh air which I loved! In addition, Enigma proved to have the sweetest atmosphere and excellent food (the potatoes that came with the breakfast were to die for!) and experience. One of my new favourite places!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and very friendly, attentive staff. They were very accommodating with vegetarian remixes of various meals. Extra points for the sheer genius of breakfast poutine.

If you're missing Alternative Grounds on Roncy, this is a fine alternative with similar ambiance."}
{"text":"Charming Cafe with books lining the shelves so you can read while you enjoy a cup of their rich coffee with eggs that are so fluffy, it's like eating a cloud. Their attentive servers will ensure that you have everything and the cook has a shuffle to his step. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Tried this as I was in the area and had decent reviews on Yelp.
It wasn't busy at all. Waitress came by quickly with menu and water - thankfully, as it was so hot today!

Asked to sub the peameal bacon on the eggs benny as am veggie. Was offered spinach which was great.

Little bit of a wait for the food but entirely reasonable.

Forgot to say I wanted my eggs medium poached and wasn't asked but that's how they came out 

Would have liked more of the hollandaise sauce - was a bit stingy. The muffins also got soggy and not sure they were toasted. Haven't ever had this happen before - maybe should have requested toasted muffins?

Potatoes were mixed with very small pieces of onions red peppers and green peppers and had an interesting flavour- liked it.

I think I'd go again and make sure I asked for toasted muffins and a bit more of a generous helping of hollandaise. 

Price was more for less than at Coras but as a stand alone establishment I guess this is to be expected.

The chef cane out to greet a family that was there which was nice to see.

Went to use the washroom downstairs- be careful as I nearly got stuck on the stairs when I couldn't open the door back to the restaurant- you have to give a good shove!"}
{"text":"After reading a few great reviews I was in the area and stopped in. And the food was very basic and the service only O.K. Fine for a typical greasy breakfast to cure a hangover, but if you are looking for anything great this isn't the place."}
{"text":"Enigma gets another star because things are a-changin!

First, and most exciting to me, the hours have become consistent. I now confidently leave my house in the morning knowing that I will be able to get the coffee I so desperately need.

Enigma 2.0 has retained the great coffee, friendly service and good food with good value of the past and kicked them all up a notch while adding a great all-day breakfast at $5.99, daily lunch specials and a new can-do attitude.

My faith rewarded!"}
{"text":"Cute little restaurant with jazz music playing and books all over for you to read. The staff was friendly and the food was good and reasonably priced. I will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"A hidden treasure! Went on a sunny Saturday morning anticipating huge lines for brunch, was happy to get there and it was half empty! Quick, friendly service, and good eggs bennys! This is the kind of place you could come to alone and not feel weird eating by yourself."}
{"text":"Just another reason to love the area. Delicious coffee, perfectly poached eggs Florentine and excellent home fries. My new fave breakfast place."}
{"text":"Really good coffee and a tasty breakfast wrap -- nice and filling and it came with home fries which was nice. Prices are very reasonable and the place is nicely decorated and cozy. They have a lot of books and other entertainments to keep you amused. A great place to sip coffee and people watch. The service is friendly and casual."}
{"text":"This eclectic little cafe on Bloor St. W is one that's not to be missed IMHO.

My friend and I, having exhausted all the brunch spots on Dundas St. W., arrived here around 12:30pm and were seated immediately. They have about 10 tables inside and 1 outside. The interior decor makes you feel like your sitting in someone's home.

My friend ordered the Eggs Benny on a waffle and was very impressed. She liked the change from the traditional English muffin and thought it tasted really good. 

I ordered the waffle with fresh fruit and a side of scrambled eggs (to add a tad of protein to the mix). The waffle was golden and fluffy. The fruit was fresh and crispy including raspberries that tasted like they were picked from someone's backyard. The dollop of whip cream on the plate was fresh and I would be surprised if they didn't make it in house. The scrambled eggs were nicely salted and cooked perfectly. I thoroughly enjoyed my meal.

The coffee on the other hand was a little too strong for my liking. I had to add a ton of sugar to place it in the drinkable category. My friend did not share my thoughts on that so maybe I just started off with the bottom of a pot.

Price point was extremely reasonable and they take cash or debit (but not American $50's). Service got better as our visit went on but it was still hard to ever make eye contact with a waiter or waitress.

I have at least 2 more menu items on my 'must try' bucket list so there is no question in my mind that I will return. This place is on to something!

Bon appetite!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place...but it fell way short. Came here on a Sunday morning, and it was quite busy, they cleared a table (except for the crumbs and spills) for us and then we sat down. It didn't take too long to order. 

What was bad, was the time it took to get food...I MUST HAVE AGED DECADES. Breakfast food is also notoriously easy to prepare (read: should be quick and fresh). Service is way sub par (one man beside us actually got up and left the cafe to take a smoke he was waiting so long, and was so frustrated) 

We ordered two classic breakfast, one with bacon and one with sausage. The bacon was crispy, the eggs were done well, but the toast was way over toasted (and super scratchy and dry), and the sausage was an Italian sausage, not a breakfast sausage (I LOVE Italian sausages, BUT NOT when I'm expecting a breakfast sizzler). The potatoes were also not crispy, they were just potatoes. 

I will not be coming back here :("}
{"text":"I thought this was a regular cafe and boy was I surprised, poutine, classic comfort food and enough breakfast options to make anyone's day. This unassuming place has quite a bit to offer, and all freshly made. My order of mixed vegetable poutine, took about 15 minutes to make but the wait was worth it. Everything was perfectly seasoned, and not soggy like other places I've been too. What a great place to spend a lunch or brunch.."}
{"text":"I had high expectations after reading the reviews. I came on a Sunday afternoon and was pleased to see it wasn't busy. I was looking forward to trying the eggs benny on a waffle. However it was not what I expected. The waffle was practically burnt and dry. There was hardly any hollandaise on the eggs, the coffee tasted watery and the service was slow. They had 1 person serving and taking care of the bar. During breakfast, the smoke alarm goes off (that was probably my waffle burning lol). I was very disappointed. I usually don't write off restaurants so quickly, I would go back and give it another try, although I am hesitant."}
{"text":"On our way out to catch UP Express and glad we found this place at noon.  Not much choice on this strip (Mugshot restaurant smelled bad and the guy really didn't want any customers so early so we left).
The coffee and food were better than expected considering the humble appearance.  In fact, better than the 2 fancier places we tried that week.
(why do breakfast places have bad coffee?!).
Service was good for a 1-man operation."}
