{"text":"This place is the best in upper NDG for bread that I have found. I get the Carre Ble Entier (whole wheat loaf) about three times a week, and bagettes and ciabatta's on occasion. The pastrys are good but a little pricey for my budget, not to say they aren't worth it i just preferr to spend my money on huge abouts of bread.  The only thing that irritates me is in the weekends when they operate the number system. Although it is meant to make things easier, it creates havoc. Please god put the number wheel closer too, or even outside the door with a clearer sign. Then put the dam thing away on weekdays becasue people don't know when to take tickets.  As you can tell I care greatly about efficient numbering service systems."}
{"text":"Came here to try out some sandwiches and salad. They were a little better than average. I would have given it 3.5 stars because for a bakery it had a lot of variety of breads and pastries. The negatives were: dirty bathrooms, tables were not clean, and less than average value. For the price one would expect better sandwiches. Perhaps sandwiches and salads are not their specialty. I shall try their breads next time."}
{"text":"I wanted to try their croissants. They have 100% butter, almonds, raspberries and pistachios, cheese, honey and sesame, hazelnut praline. I chose the pure butter. All delicious! I plan to try the other flavours later. They also have a gluten free product showcase: cookies, cakes, muffins, breads. That's really appreciated! And this month, the blueberry pie is on promotion. It's blueberry season!"}
{"text":"Bel emplacement, un beau \"before\" avant une séance de cinema au Cineplex, viennoiserie et café ... Mais ce que j'aime par dessus tout, c'est leurs gâteaux... Texture, goût et présentation! Super comme gâteau de fête."}
{"text":"Their traditional baguette is good among the bread chains. Very crisp crust, wheat-y aroma, it smells freshly baked. Price is reasonable and open until fairly late.  I'm not a fan of their new coated baguettes though. The crust is hard like rock (risk of mouth injury if you don't chew carefully). They're salty and lack the aroma of the traditional baguette."}
{"text":"Ce Première Moisson est vraiment très agréable. L'espace est très grand et le personnel efficace et souriant.  J'y suis allée pour un gouter, avec mes amies nous nous sommes partagées le pain du mois: choco blanc et noix de coco avec un thé. Nous nous sommes régalées !  Mention spéciale pour le pain de décembre choco-canneberges à tomber par terre! J'ai déjà hâte d'être à l'année prochaine pour pouvoir en racheter.  De toutes manières Première Moisson est toujours une valeur sure, tout y est délicieux !"}
{"text":"This is the place for any types of breads and French Pastries. They always have something special on their menus for breads. Their French Pastries are freshly made and delicious. This place on Monk land can accommodate so many people. I had their maple syrup Mille Feuille and it was delicious. My stomach was full and yes even being a chain, I liked it and enjoyed the vibes. At the moment they have specials for Easter especially with their chocolates Easter eggs. In addition, their breads are all an art. I'd definitely recommend it to all as the quality of food is perfect.   -:)"}
{"text":"Personnellement, très cher pour ce que c'est niveau sandwiches ou autres. J'y suis allée à quelques reprises, et chaque fois pour me retrouver confrontée  à plus de cowboys que d'indiens; neuf employés pour quatre clients et nous attendions, organisation confuse, et, pas toujours mais trop souvent, à peine aimable le service, je dis à peine pour rester courtoise.  Le fait qu'il y ait trop  de personnel à servir n'est pas rare, et à moins qu'il y ait eu amélioration sur  ce plan, et sur d'autres questions, personnellement je reste assez désabusée."}
{"text":"They have a reputation for amazing breads, cheeses. pastries as well as cakes....and it's justly deserved. They have a variety of things you can pick up fresh, made the same day. I love their breads and some of my favorite breakfast places offer slices of fresh bread from this place. Heavenly!  I came here with a co-worker to get some of their lunch options, I took their Italian sausage sandwich, which I had them grilled for me. It was delicious. I took a side of chinotto and we dined on the terrace under the sun in warm weather and light refreshing breeze. I was a happy man!  I'd rate this place 5 stars but will dock this place 1 star for a stupid comment one of the staff said to us who didn't want to prepare 2 sandwiches for us because apprently we weren't paying on the same bill. I was forced to get another number and wait a few more minutes for honestly no reason at all.   Silly staff woman can't handle 2 sandwiches."}
{"text":"Premier Moisson is the go-to bakery/cafe in the neighbourhood. They are open late and have a good collection of breads (including one with no ingredients that contain gluten). They also have a few gluten-free pastries. The breads are pretty good and the pastries are enjoyable - though not the best in town. Nevertheless, I'll pick them over any nonlocal chain coffee place anytime. This is quite a spacious bakery and there's ample space to sit with some outlets for those of us accompanied by our laptops! They have a good variety of lunch items as well: different soups, salads and sandwiches etc.  There was a cozy beautiful bakery right in front of them that sadly moved recently. So this is my new fav. bakery/cafe close to villa-maria metro station :)"}
{"text":"I was in town visiting family and we decided to drop by for dessert.  As always this place is a mob scene due to their amazing breads and desserts.  We took a number in the chaos and looked at the pastries.  As I stared into the glass display I noticed a significant amount of flying bugs. They were all through the long display, flying around and landing on the pies and pastries.  It was impossible to ignore and others noticed too.    I can understand one or two flies can get into stores but this was really bad.    A shame for such a great place but I walked out and won't likely be back.  They need to fix the problem."}
{"text":"Les produits premières moissons sont tous très bon et de très bonne qualité. L'odeur en entrant, on voudrait tout essayer. Cette fois, j'y allais spécifiquement pour des macarons, un vendredi matin 9:00. Il n'y a pas beaucoup de clients, toutefois, je prends un numéro pour me faire servir à la pâtisserie. Malgré la dizaine d'employés et les quelques clients j'attends presque 10 minutes pour me faire servir. Je suis pourtant là bien visible.   Les macarons étaient très bons et ils offrent une bonne variété à prix compétitif."}
{"text":"Première Moisson is a staple in the city when it comes to bread and pastries. There's a dozen alone on the island so I guess they're considered a chain but damn, they're consistency is impressive. We decided to grab a box of pastries after a hot yoga session (treat yo self!).  - Pastries - we ordered a couple types of croissants for everyone to try along with a peach turnover pastry. I had half of the cheese croissant (it had cheese inside for extra cheesiness) and half of the almond croissant ($3.25); flaky and filling is divine. The 100% butter croissant ($1.65) was devoured by my dad so safe to say he liked it.  We also tried a strawberry rhubarb pie ($9.25) that we saved for New Year's eve. I found the filling a little too sweet for my taste buds but a few others liked it."}
{"text":"Their desserts are so delicious, as our their lattes. Really impeccable French baked goods! This Is the real deal. Love their cakes too."}
{"text":"I am hooked on the croissants from Boulangerie Premiere Moisson. I have been to three of their locations, and they all have not disappointed me. The croissants are fresh, very tasty, and delicious. The plain croissants are buttery and have lovely flakiness to it. The almond croissants are not like all others. It has almond paste baked into the center, and it almost tastes like a soft, flaky cake. It was delicious.  There are street metered parking which makes it very easy to access by car.  They take both cash and credit card. They speak the universal language of pointing my finger at their croissants. But they also speak French and English in case you can't use your pointing finger.  I would come back again. If you are visiting Montreal, this chain of boulangerie is a must visit. Try the croissants and let me know. If you know other boulangeries, please also let me know."}
{"text":"I have come here twice now but have only tried the chocolate croissant and regular croissant. Both are so buttery and delicious, probably the best croissants iv ever had. I would like to come back to try their food and more of their desserts, the bread also looks heavenly and I noticed that a lot of people ordered the baguettes."}
{"text":"6 of us came here for breakfast.  The atmosphere: There are a handful of tables here where you can sit after you order the food from the counter.  Food: Cajun quac Chicken sandwich (2/5 stars) chicken was really rubbery would not recommend.   Croissant sandwich with ham and cheese was very good. (5/5 stars) Would recommend getting it toasted.  Croissant with cheese was good. (4/5 stars)  They had a big selection of sweets as well which we did not try.  I was mildly dissapointed they did not have more savory types of croissants.   Service: Not all the staff speaks English but they tried and we had no problems communicating."}
{"text":"Great place!   Gluten Free options like pastries and Cakes.   A variety of stuff to buy like fresh bread, pastries, jams, frozen items, pâté and many other items.   It's right beside the movie theater Cineplex Laval and beside Centropolis.   Lots of seating and an inviting space to have breakfast, lunch or a snack."}
{"text":"Everybody talks about this place. But its just another chain with over priced products. The breads are good but everything else is fancy packaging at a cost. I eat here because of convenience."}
{"text":"Casual clean place to have breakfast , lunch , snack, coffee, cakes or just bread !! Many tables and relax atmosphere."}
