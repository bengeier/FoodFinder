{"text":"Their chicken wings and lamb pudding is only things that taste good. Chow mein is tasteless and water downed...no flavour at all. Plus they over priced....I guess that's how they stay in business. Not a place to party it's always empty...no surprise there with their ridiculous prices!"}
{"text":"If you go there for the dance club, be prepared to finish your drinks by 2:00 am because they confiscate all alcohol at this time.  We were on the dance floor during last call and came back to our table to find all our drinks had disappeared, including our water.  I saw a bouncer pull a drink out of a patron's hand while he was drinking.  Not cool."}
{"text":"They should have someone with good phone manner answering the phone. Chick sounded like she was at home, bout hello. And a dry hello at that.  Then she says, Name? I just dropped the order and said forget it and hung up on her...and went to Friendship Restaurant instead. At least the girl knew how to answer the phone and take a pick order. When you work at a restaurant and don't know how to answer the phone you have issues. Maybe you should have stayed in school. You could have got a better job if you're not happy with that one. Miserable."}
{"text":"I really come here for their spicy chicken wings. They are so flavorful and crispy. I usually am only a fan of saucy wings but this is the exception. I still am not a huge fan of their food though. The flavor is lacking which is disappointing. The service isn't always the fastest but I find that seems to be the case at a lot of west indian places I go to. They have beer bucket specials and parties on weekends and Thursdays. You can also come play pool here and they cater for special events."}
{"text":"Bad service. Don't feel welcomed at all. Too many over drunk customers bumping into you.  Empty dance floor.  Should they still be serving alcohol to people when they can't even stand on their feet?  Way over priced food. In Scarborough, really?  $15 entrance fee? For what?"}
{"text":"Hm.  Honestly, 3 stars cause the food is amazing when they are on point, but unfortunately usually the food is stale.   Twilight is so inconsistent with this stale food. You order food and your expectation is for it to be fresh, that's the goal. Something they make just for you. But when you pick up the food, it's sometimes fresh (not often) and sometimes stale. I have never dined in person here. I've only ordered for pick up or through skip the dishes. Been trying twilight and their sister restaurant: starlite since last spring 2017.   Both twilight and starlite are inconsistent but I'd vouch for starlite more - they have gotten numerous orders wrong BUT the food is 85% fresh most of the time. And the orders aren't off by that much. For example, order jerk chicken fried rice - they give jerk chicken on top but with mixed meat fried rice (beef, shrimp and chicken) when you know you ordered specific chicken fried rice with jerk chicken on top. Or you order pepper shrimp fried rice and they give you pepper shrimp only. Classic. Anyways that's starlite.  They seem to have a bigger crowd / takeout system than twilight. Same owners, so food tastes similar. Probably just depends on the cook. Its that bad that you have to pick the busiest day to get food from them to hope that it will be fresh. Friday night/ Saturday night seems best to get that fresh food....but it's a 50/50 shot.   Maybe they'll read this review and change their bad habits. You have to wonder what else goes on in the kitchen and what else could be in your food when they serve stale food."}
{"text":"This place has great food and the night life is a awesome...I have no complaints"}
{"text":"The restaurant is dark and dingy on the inside ... not very inviting as a sit down place but food quality is good and portions are large.   A very good take out option."}
{"text":"We ordered chow mein, ginge rice, chilli chicken and session chicken.  I can only say that the sesame chicken was flavorful but the rest was quite bland. I personally will not be returning"}
{"text":"I heard a couple things about this place, and went for xmas...on a night they were supposed to be having an event. No one showed up, so that was a failure..they even closed up early. I may try again for another event in the summertime."}
