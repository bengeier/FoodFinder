{"text":"OMG! SO amazing!!! I actually ate here about 3 weeks ago, but I forgot to review till now. It is SO good. So many things to chose from. The people are friendly and the service is quick and accurate. The food tasted fresh, and it had lots of flavor. I am sort of picky with my ranch dressing, and I LOVED it here. Go here if you have a chance. Going back today to eat there for the second time..."}
{"text":"Great place to eat! I made up my own salad and was given many options. The veggies were fresh and flavorful. I also ordered a small cup of soup on the side. The soup was also very good and wasn't just loaded with salt and broth, but with chicken and veggies. Great place to eat if choosing to eat healthy!"}
{"text":"Came here because I was craving a big salad for dinner.  As previous reviewers mentioned, the lettuce and veggies were all very fresh.  My issue was with the proteins.  The chicken was the bagged Foster Farms like chicken with the fake grill marks.  Toss and Take Salads just made me miss Market Street Bistro, which closed when the economy turned.  They used to grill the protein to order.  This was more like a subway."}
{"text":"Great place to get a amazing salad!!!! Make your own or try one of there signature salads...  They use local produce to so that's awesome...  Great local small business"}
{"text":"I'm glad to finally see Toss & Take Salads here on Yelp. I made the suggestion to the manager a few days ago after eating here a few times. 

I discovered Toss & Take Salads a few weeks ago on my way to my normal Starbucks run. Toss & Take Salads has been open for about a month now; so far so good. Since then I have been here 4 or 5 times.

Here's how it works: you can choose a salad that is small, medium, or large, or you can order a wrap. I usually order a small salad, which is plenty for me. Each salad starts with a base of romaine lettuce. For the small size ($6) you choose one meat (buffalo, grilled, or teriyaki chicken, tuna, surimi, ham, ), three add-in vegetables (choose from grilled veggies, cucumbers, grape tomatoes, spinach, mushrooms, bell peppers, mandarin oranges, hardboiled eggs, etc), cheese (blue, parmesan, or shredded cheddar), and your choice of croutons, pasta (rotini), and/or tortilla chip strips (for some extra crunch). There are about fifteen or more different salad dressings available to choose from. A medium salad ($7.50) comes with 2 selections of meat and 4 additional ingredients, and a large ($9) comes with 2 meat choices and 5 additional ingredients. For all salads you have your choice of cheese, croutons, chips, and pasta (they don't count toward your ingredient total). The wrap ($4) comes on a flour tortilla and has a meat and three ingredients. There is also soup available, and you can make any salad into a combo for an additional cost (includes drink and soup). They also provide catering with a jumbo salad that can feed 5-8 people ($28).

Each salad is hand-tossed in front of you with each ingredient you have chosen. They ensure the salad dressing is well-distributed. The salads are delicious, and all ingredients appear fresh; romaine lettuce is crisp, baby spinach is not wilted, and there isn't a hint of spoilage (anything slimy) in any of the other raw ingredients - mushrooms, bell peppers, broccoli florets, etc. There is an excellent selection of ingredients to customize your salad. 

If you like salads, there is something for everyone, and the prices are reasonable for what you get - a healthy, fresh, hand-tossed salad made to your specifications. You can't go wrong. I definitely recommend this place if you're interested in eating a healthy lunch. Hopefully they'll stick around for a while.

They accept all major credit cards - VISA, MasterCard, AMEX, Discover"}
{"text":"Disappointed because we have been here twice and totally enjoyed all of the fresh ingredients and delicious salads. For the past month, however, the lights have been off and the \"Open\" sign has been lit but the door is locked!!! Is the business closed? A total bummer...super weird!"}
{"text":"So....I was excited to finally try this place out only to see it closed with a notice on the door stating that some permit was expired.

Very disappointed and hope it gets figured out"}
{"text":"The portions are huge and the lettuce is crisp. I love the fresh veggies! The employees are extremely helpful and pleasant! I would have given 5 stars if the ranch dressing was homemade and not from the bottle. Overall, its a great place and I will continue to go there for my salad fix!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty awesome. I come by for a salad regularly.

Subway feel for salads... but better.

So many different protein choices as well as veggies. This place also offers wraps but I have never tried as a Celiac. I just do the salads, avoid croutons, and my Celiac self is just fine."}
{"text":"First time here,amazing idea. Kinda modeled off of Subway in that you go down the line saying exactly what you want. Very delicious will be there again for sure."}
{"text":"I started going here when they first opened and they were great! Everything was very fresh. Portions and pricing were descent and I loved getting the dressing tossed in the salad.  I always got the tilapia because I don't like, as previous mentioned, the protein selection (packaged/fake grill marks). However, I recently noticed quality/freshness had diminished and prices have gone up. 

Recommendations:

Get rid of the microwave!! At least put it in the back so I don't see you microwave the frozen tilapia I order! Invest in a grill and quality will skyrocket. 

The soup used to be made fresh daily and served from a pot. Now it's stored in a cooler where they also place in the microwave when you order. Chicken noodle  is delicious but a little salty. 

Staff is always short-handed. They need to hire at least 1 more person between 11-1pm and 5-7pm because service is so slow (not the fault of the employee)! I usually go in with another person and it takes us at least 15 min to get our food. 

Hopefully, the owner takes a look at this and makes some changes. I really want this place to stay open, considering there aren't very many quick/healthy places for lunch/dinner.

I will still go back and enjoy a salad from time to time, but with these changes I would probably go back everyday! I think a couple of improvements will make this a hot spot for lunch/dinner!"}
{"text":"Craving a fresh salad so stopped by here today. The sign said open but door was locked and look closed on the inside. Disappointed because I've eaten here before and it was decent and quick for a lunch hour."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! Healthy, fresh, and delicious! This is hands down my new favorite place, I've been waiting for something like this for a long time."}
{"text":"Great salad and even better soup.  I had the Corn Chowder and it was outstanding.  Love this place.  Try it!!  Everybody needs a healthy option a least once a week.
I'm going twice a week.  Tonight was my first time there.  Really good.  Really fresh!!"}
{"text":"I have been here several times with my husband and it is great everytime. They have many options for proteins, vegetables, and dressings. The salads and wraps are prepared in front of you with the most delicious ingredients. I wish the owner would franchise it because it is so delicious!"}
