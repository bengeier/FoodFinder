{"text":"I had the wonton brisket noodle soup (number 5 on the main menu)  and it was not to par.  The brisket was over cooked and the noodles hard.  The soup itself was decent."}
{"text":"Awful. Too many noodles, not enough meat in their special - I was fishing around just to find some tendon (which was quite soft, I have to say). They mix in the bean sprouts rather than serve it on the side, which I don't like, and they don't even understand Viet...so ordering a Ca Phe Sua was a bit confusing - especially as they don't have it anyway! For what you get for $8, I'd say find a better place."}
{"text":"This restaurant is located inside the plaza, which might be confusing if you're looking for an entrance outside. Which can be a good thing, because patio seats means you're sitting right next to the hallway. Well, it is an interesting set up.

They've got different types of dishes. Pho, bun, grilled meat on rice, some vegetable dishes, etc.

Prices are competitive I guess for cooked food? You're looking at $9 for a bowl but it comes with one size only. I mean, you are right next to a massive chinese supermarket so you definitely have a lot of ... alternatives to choose from when it comes to food options. And there's a BBQ place around the corner as well.

Bean sprouts are included in the bowl, if you don't notice them like me and decided to ask for more. You could probably try asking for more anyways. If you need some chili peppers just ask for it.

Food was alright. I personally find it a bit small and wish they would offer upsizes for an extra dollar or something. The broth made me thirsty after awhile; good thing there's that chinese supermarket to pick up some drinks.

Would probably only come here if I'm also doing groceries."}
{"text":"I'm a student and I live really close by. Unless I m hanging out with friends, I go here to eat every single day. The reasons why I like here so much are the food taste really delicious (I tried everything in the menu), the price are cheap for this quality and quantity. 

I have been to Vietnam twice in my life, and I love pho a lot. I tried different pho in Toronto but I think this place have the most similar soup base compare to what I had in Vietnam. Although the pho noodles are not as good as Vietnam, It is still pretty good compare to most of the place in Toronto. The beef are fresh and just perfectly done every single time (never over cook. I hate well done beef in a pho). 

Their grilled lemongrass beef, pork chop and chicken taste really amazing and really juicy. I don't know what's their secret methods but I know whenever I order it and they will grill it at that time. They make sure the food that provide to customers are freshly made. Tbh. I love the lemongrass even more than the pho haha.

The last part of their menu are Thai food. I tried all of them and my recommendation will be pad Thai, Malaysian fry rice, Thai beef and the red curry chicken. 
Pad Thai - their sauce just perfectly prefect. Not too sour, not too sweet. Just right
Malaysian - smells really good, a little spicy and the favour will be a little bit like xo sauce.
Thai beef - fresh deep fry beef with their own secret sauce. Similar to other Thai food. Sweet and sour and a bit of spicy. Yummy. 
Red curry chicken - a little of spicy , love their curry sauce. Delicious. 

All the food served with rice and veggies except pho of cuz. Most of the food are around $8-$10 and really good amount of food. I know I might be over compliment but this is one of my favourite restaurant so yeah lol."}
{"text":"I was around the area and saw this place, honestly didn't have high expectations since it looked a bit run down but was pleasantly surprised! 

I got the chicken vermicelli and iced milk tea and both were surprisingly good! The milk tea was creamy and had strong tea flavour. The chicken  vermicelli was loaded with veggies and generous portions of meat. The girl there was very friendly and nice!

I enjoyed my meal there and will def go again if I am in the area. Prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Very mediocre pho, to say the least. Everything is pretty average in it: broth, meat, vegetables. Meat topping was generous but beef in my bowl was very chewy and not tasty; broth tasted bland too.

Price is a tad high considering the fact that you place your order at the counter and bring it to your own table when it is ready. I guess the higher price goes to the servers' tip? I have no complaints here as staff is friendly.

However, all in all I don't recommended it, unless you are happy with a quick fix of \"unauthentic\" pho."}
{"text":"Great restaurant with very friendly customer service! Owner King Is excellent guy! The food is amazing, I try the Pho. The soup taste excellent, no MSG. Very fulfilling!!"}
{"text":"Ordered their coconut chicken fried rice ($8.50?) Got it to go. For a location in this area, their food isn't cheap. Pho starts at just above $7.00, if I'm not mistaken. Anyways, back to my order. My dad chose to order this, and when he did, I already knew that I shouldn't have high expectations for it. 

The picture of this fried rice on their overhead menu was very yellow. As in curry yellow. When I order coconut fried rice and it comes very yellow, I'm always highly skeptical of how much coconut is going to be in it. Usually, it's stronger on the curry than the coconut. The coconut chicken fried rice here proved to be no exception to this rule. There was absolutely NO coconut taste. There was also very little chicken, and not many vegetables. Way too much rice to other stuff in this fried rice. The rice itself was not dry enough (as in not enough wok heat). The grains of rice in fried rice are supposed to separate. This was incredibly clumpy. Taste-wise, this was fairly heavy on the curry powder. It tasted like a clumpy rice version of Singapore fried vermicelli.

I'm sorely disappointed. I will (hopefully) never get rice from here ever again. We'll see about their pho."}
{"text":"This restaurant is in the Peanut Plaza and you pay upfront, wait for your order and then take it to a table.  We both had the House Special Pho, which were $8.95 each.   The broth was good but the beef wasn't very tender.  The place is rather small and the tables close together which is something I don't really enjoy."}
{"text":"Located in the peanut plaza and is pretty small, like some of the other places in the plaza it can be overlooked. Been getting pho here once in a while and their broth seems surprisingly good. Not the best pho place I've been to but it's def a good place to check out if you love pho or if you're in the area and just want to grab some quick pho. The only thing I wish they had was the option for portion sizes for pho like at other restaurants. The pho here only comes in one standard size when you order it. Overall I'd come back once in a while."}
{"text":"Pretty well priced and fast service , hence their name \"express \" . Usually order pho , but the chicken wings are also pleasantly satisfying and is also great value .  Don't expect luxury pho here , but is more of casual and comfort food . Overall, customer service and food is good ."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and had their beef pho. Broth was bland and there was some strange odor coming from the bowl. Beef was also slightly over done.  Unlike regular sit down pho restaurants, you don't get a plate of sprouts and mint leaves. Instead, it's all in the bowl (whether you like it or not)."}
{"text":"I was actually going to get groceries but was hungry and as I was walking towards the grocery store I saw a sign with different deals.

The prices looked fair so I decided to go in.  I ordered the house special Vietnamese noodle beef soup.

I sat down and in about five minutes my hot bowl of noodle soup came to me.  The first thing I did is take a sip of the soup and the broth tasted very good was actually very impressed with the soup broth.

it was definitely very good and the portions for good had a lot of meat and I strongly recommend that anybody that's in that area to make their way to this restaurant because it was a pleasant surprise"}
{"text":"This is the best pho restaurant ever, I love all kinds of the dishes on their menu especially for the Thai Red curry chicken,that was the best,everybody should try it!!!"}
