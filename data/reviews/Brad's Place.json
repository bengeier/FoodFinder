{"text":"I love this place - a \"locals\" bar that the owners clearly have a lot of pride in (you can tell that they did much of the build-out themselves, which is great for a locals watering hole). It is a fun place to watch a game with moderate priced food and very affordable drinks.

I can only give three stars as my wife feels some of the patrons are a bit too \"local\" and \"regular\" for her taste."}
{"text":"Worst service ever!!!!! Beyond unprofessional, at any Point you will find someone who works there off duty and wasted it's such a dysfunctional place with a bunch of alcoholics but my credit I'll give them is the food is decent but it's a complete dive that smells with people who have never been able to make it professionally in any other room so this is what they do for a living and consider it service"}
{"text":"This place is okay... I wasn't impressed and won't be back since Ahwatukee is full of sports bars. Tables weren't clean, asked the waitress what was good here since it was our first time and she said what do you mean? Miller light not on draft only bottles. Food was below average. Cole slaw was sour."}
{"text":"I had lunch here with a childhood friend and loved it! It was great! The bartender was always checking to make sure we were okay and never had a problem getting drinks refilled. The bar itself is a nice little sports bar, wall mounted televisions and sports on all the channels. The clientele earlier in the day (noon-ish) was regulars and older crowd but towards the middle of the afternoon younger clientele started coming in. I had the crispy chicken sandwich! So good! I ordered it with onion rings which were perfect but the sandwich itself was so good! The chicken was just as it says on the menu...crispy! It came on a hamburger bun but the chicken was so large it dwarfed the bun! The sandwich came with cheese., lettuce, onion and bacon! Very, very good! So looking to spend a leisure afternoon having drinks with good service and good food, you need to check this place out!"}
{"text":"My fiance' wanted to try something new. So we opted to come to brad's which is near our home. Long story short, that same night we got food poisoning. We had to go to the ER and evrything. Since this event occurred, well will not be returning. The service was decent, a lot of swearing occurred by the servers and bartender which I believe to be unprfessional. At the bar, I watch the bartender just dip the cups in cold water and place the cups on the shelves for reusing (this was mid-way through meal...of course I stopped eatting) If I could give them a half of a star I would."}
{"text":"Walleye is pretty darn good. Wasn't a fan of the coleslaw but that's just my preference."}
{"text":"I kid you not when I say the food is delicious, the service is the best I've experienced. It's a very welcoming place I would call a second home. 5 stars hands down in my book."}
{"text":"Having lunch with my wife. Both of us are trying the Walleye Platter (Walleye Friday). The pan fried is awesome! A little place next to the Safeway (Starbucks side 48th & Elliott) with Midwest food (Owner is from Minnesota). They have fried Bologna sandwiches on the menu. Will come back to try one. A best kept secret of the Ahwatukee area."}
{"text":"Today I had the Burger and Fries $4.99 ( dine in) special. Sat at the bar and placed my order with the bartender. Some time later the Bartender brings out my order in a to-go container. I tell her I'm eating here as the sign reads dine-in. 
The burger bun was hard and smashed thin and the fries were cold, hard and tasteless. Won't go back...."}
{"text":"Terrible service, food, and environment! The waitress was very open about swearing and wasn't that great with manners either. Also the food was OK, but I ordered a ceasar salad for $6 and got a small salad on a big plate and a grilled chicken breast sliced. Plus to top it all off, the place smelled like smoke because they let customers smoke on the patio and the inside just smells terrible with the mixture of greasy fish and cigarette smoke. Would recommend any other restaurant over this one. But if you can look past it, that's fine by me."}
{"text":"We're from Minnesota, so this bar that welcomes those from the Upper Midwest is like home. We love the burgers and walleye. Service has always been attentive.
The craft beer selection is slim (the owner loves Sierra Pacific Pale Ale, and that's a plus) and the patio is mostly for smokers only. That keeps us inside.
But, it's our \"neighborhood bar\" and we come back again and again."}
{"text":"Been here more times than I can count!  Service is awesome!  Jen, Sara, Christine, Jake and Brad, (owner), fantastic peeps!!  Fun atmosphere good food cold brew.  Gotta come check this place out!  Perfect for Sunday football, especially for all you Vikings,  Bears fans!  Trivia nights and bingo... What gets better than all of that!!!"}
{"text":"probably wont be going back,ok fish and chips, not much beer selection"}
{"text":"What a wonderful place to hang out everybody knows your name the bar staff is very friendly the food is amazing and as much Sports as you can take on any given day what more could you ask for"}
{"text":"Brad's Place is the kind of great little neighborhood bar you find all over the midwest.  Not so much here in the valley, and certainly not in Ahwatukee.  Hidden away to the left of a Safeway on 48th and Elliott, small, very low key, it's not fancy, and it's decorated up like somebody's overambitious home rec room.  The kind of place where even with MNF on a group of people can stake out a corner of the patio to watch a sitcom together over drinks.  And I love that there is almost always a hockey game on and almost never basketball.

I've been stopping in here about once a week after work for the past 9 months, and I suppose I'm a regular since by the time I sit down Julie has usually set a beer down for me.  She really is one of the hardest working people in show business.

Foodwise, I haven't ordered much since I get there pretty late.  The steak sliders are excellent.  That they use King's Hawaiian Rolls for the bun puts them over the top.  Their bacon wrapped meatloaf is good as is their spaghetti.  And the cheese curds are the real deal, likely imported from Wisconsin.  

They do trivia, and it's usually packt.  And they generally have some sort of live music on Friday and Saturday nights.  All they're really missing is having Old Style, Schmidts or Stroh's on tap.  I almost don't want you to \"discover\" the place"}
{"text":"Bummed it is closed but appears to be undergoing a renovation and re-branded as Wild Hare Irish Pub. Looking forward to the re-opening. Hopefully the food doesn't change too much."}
{"text":"Went with friends to Brad's Place, Elliot Rd. in Phoenix on 12/21/2010. We arrived at 6:15 PM and the place was half filled. We placed our food order and finally had to asked where the food was, 30 minutes later. The server said it would be coming up in 5 minutes, the second time she had said that. I finally went to the kitchen ans asked where our food was. The cook(who was dressed like he was homeless and dirty) said 5 minutes but there was no plates on the prep counter. I went back to our table and said, \"we are leaving\". I do not know what happened at do not care but we went to Keegans on Ray Road and the service was 100 times better than Brad's."}
{"text":"Have been coming here on and off  for the last several years to sing karaoke on Saturday night... it's a little hole in the wall but I almost always have a good time. Sometimes it's over-crowded and we'll go over to Native but it's one of my favorite places to sing (I like that they have an outdoor section, too.... Esp. love the cheese curds (cheese from Wisconsin)..."}
{"text":"We've all heard about judging books by their cover. Well, if I were one to judge a restaurant by it's decor, I probably wouldn't have tried this place. Not that it is bad, (a bunch of sports stuff on the walls), it is just a little plain and doesn't give off that \"good food\" vibe. Sometimes I feel like I just walked into someones game room in their basement. 

After setting first impressions aside, we decided to order. I have to say, everything was much better than expected. Fried cheese curds & pork chili verde were great. There is not a huge selection on the menu, but if you can handle a HUGE pork chop sandwich (see photo) or a burger, you'll be good to go!  

They have Happy Hour from 10:00am - 7:00pm, Karaoke on Saturdays and Trivia on Wednesdays.  Heavy pours on the wine and Saturday Happy Hour. We will be going back for sure!"}
{"text":"We are officially regulars:) moved into the area bout 3 months ago and kinda shopped around for our neighborhood bar. Brads place is definitely our favorite. The bartenders are all fantastic, food is super good which most of the time is cooked by the owner himself so you know he's gonna actually care about what he's putting on your plate! Brad the owner is also very friendly and makes you feel super welcome, like an old friend. It's not the fanciest place but I wouldn't really call it a dive just chill and a great place to unwind."}
{"text":"Brad's Place was ok.  My friend had the walleye special, which was good.  However, everything else was just ok.   I'd recommend the taco place two door to right over Brad's - unless all you want is a beer!"}
{"text":"Went to see a buddy play there. The patio (which is within 2 feet of the doorway) was loaded with smokers so we asked the waitress to close the door ... which she did. Then the owner went and opened it letting all the smoke pour into the restaurant/bar. We again asked the waitress to close the door ... which she did. Brad the owner, went an opened it again ... apparently he could care less what his customers' want. It was so bad we left stinking of smoke. Well one person tells another person who tells another person and ...  way to go Brad!"}
{"text":"Not a classy location, not the finest of bar furniture, but, the service and menu make up for some of those elements. I can't eat furniture, so the food and quality is more important than what I sit on. This establishment only ranks 3 stars because of some of niceties. However, if you want a decent drink and a wholesome meal this is a place to try. 

I will be returning in the future to see if my review holds up after multiple visits."}
{"text":"I had one the most original burgers I have ever tasted at Brad's Place in Ahwatukee. A bratwurst burger topped with sourkraut and cheese. Add a some pickles and mustard and this thing was incredible. Friendly place and good food... now, that is a great combination."}
{"text":"Sucks.. Really wish I had the opportunity to eat here.. Walked in waited 10minutes standing..  Proceeded sat myself.. Grabbed my own menus.. No one walked up to me asked if I needed help or to order anything. Continued to wait.. Walked up to the bar told bartender it would of been great to have a server. Left menus at the bar and went on with my life. 

Keep in mind.. I could of walked in, put my order in myself.. Than walk in the back grab it and eat it probably before getting noticed.... 

Sucks went to Applebee's instead. -_-"}
{"text":"It's an ok sports bar. The placement of some of the tv's is bizarre. Beer prices are fair, and they have a pretty average bloody mary if you show up early for football games. Don't think I'll go back. There's better options in the area."}
{"text":"I will start with a thought that popped up in my head about Brad's Place. Its a statement that I usually put at the end to summarize my review....So I will start with the end: Brad's is placed ever-so slightly higher on my personal sports bar totem pole simply because they have an AMAZING fish fry. They are, however just average, with nothing to really make note of on the menu they have.

By the way, my usage of \"Fish Fry\" within this review is being considered as an exemplary  example of the usage of the word \"Fish Fry\"...........I digress..

Brad's place isn't in my neck of the woods anymore. Because of this, it will be difficult to reason why to come back here, since it offers the same amenities other bars around town offer. The only dish I have tried from their location is the Walleye Fish Fry they offer on Fridays. It's fresher and tastier than other fish fry options out there. Its hard to get a quality fish fry, let alone one in Arizona, so trying their option really made my day. However, the rest of the place is pretty average, hence the average rating. The rest of the food options don't jump off the page, nor do the drink options, etc. Its a great area location to go for some drinks and to watch a football game or two, but it isn't a must-go for me. I have other options in my area that I'd opt for before Brads....but if you are in Ahwatukee, this is a good spot to watch your weekend sports."}
{"text":"They don't have pitchers of beer but they have really big draft on tap!

Friday fish fry is actually really good. Canadian white fish fried to perfection with really good crunchy french fries. The coleslaw is sweet, runny, mayonnaise-y.  Not my kind of coleslaw.  

Local neighborhood bar where you expect to hear everyone to shout \"Norm!\" when the door opens because it seems like everyone is a regular. Older crowd so none of that youthful shenanigans.

A great place to watch a game."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, this is my least favorite bar in Tukee. It's filthy, gnats and fruit flies are abundant, bathrooms are nasty. Wouldn't dare try the food knowing how dirty the place is. The AC is never working or turned on. If you are not a regular, don't expect good service. Check your bill, they will charge you full price for happy hour drinks (happened twice) and give you attitude when you bring it to their attention. On duty staff drink with the patrons to the point of intoxication. Enter at your own risk."}
{"text":"Fabulous fish fry.....walleye!
Better drinks........Old Fashions!!
Spectacular mixologist.....Sarah!!!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! It is a small bar owned by a guy named Brad. The best part is, it is a Vikings bar! Go Vikes! I first experienced this place when I lived in Ahwatukee. My friends and I were looking for a good bar to eat at and watch a baseball game. 
Brad's has a huge menu that can be overwhelming but I always enjoy having a lot of options. I remember ordering the Grilled Cheeseburger. It was two grilled cheese sandwiched with a burger in the middle. It was to die for. I have been back a few more times since then and every time, I have had a pleasant experience. I will recommend this place to people new in the area because I like it so much. 
I attended the Football UYE this past Sunday and, unfortunately, watch the Vikings lose but had a great time anyway because the bartender/server was great and kept our refills coming. I ordered the biscuits and gravy meal that comes with eggs and breakfast potatoes. It was delicious. Another person ordered the Pork Loin sandwich and it was bigger than the bun. I will continue coming here when I have the chance.
Heads up, it is hidden in the Safeway parking lot on Elliott and 48th Street so make sure you are on the lookout because it is a small place."}
{"text":"So I just had probably one of my top 10 most disappointing dining experiences last night at Brad's Place. My friend and I ordered the pulled pork sand which that was described as \"dry-rubbed\" pork served with a side of bbq sauce. What we were served was the pork loin sandwich. Which was very bland and unremarkable. The waitress said the kitchen would make the pulled pork sandwich if we wanted. Which we did. Took almost 20 minutes for it to come out and what came out of the kitchen was a sopping and soggy sandwich drenched in BBQ sauce. Couldn't even taste anything that resembled a \"dry rub\". Just an overly sweet commercial tasting bbq . I left Brad's Place vowing to never eat there again."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood place! Local crowd, small town feel. Get the steak sliders with fries. Their on kings Hawaiian rolls and are yum. And the beer is cheap and they keep it coming. Not a bad place. Try it sometime if you are in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"The BEST bar food in town! My favorite is their turkey sandwich. Along with the great food, every bartender that has had the misfortune of serving my friends and I drinks have provided us with fun conversation. Whether we are there to wind down from a long day at work, or there to get a little more wild, we ALWAYS have a good time. Brad's Place takes care of us! :)"}
{"text":"Went there with friends for Karaoke. Now that's not my thing. Not even a bit. But it was chill, little hole in the wall. They got lots of singing time. Service was good. Maybe I'm a snob for atmosphere. Mm yeah. But ok to grab a beer, or 5. Not a great first or third date."}
{"text":"Brad's place has become my families' place of relaxation. We always come for game night and their food is really good. I had the chicken wings, my mom had the chicken, and my dad the burger. It's not easy to match my high standards for chicken wings, but they surpassed my expectations. Definitely an awesome local bar!"}
{"text":"Went into this local eatery with about 10 friends on a Sunday afternoon for an impromptu lunch. The staff was very friendly and did their best to get us in & out quickly as we only had and hour before we had to head back to a conference. The waitress took our orders quickly, and brought our food out one at a time to speed things up. Everyone's food looked good- mostly standard bar fare such as burgers, hot dogs, grilled cheese, etc. 

The bar itself had a strong Midwestern theme, with Chicago, Wisconsin, and Minnesota sports memorabilia (see photos). Since we were there on a Sunday, they had football going on all of their TVs, so it looks like a great place to chill out and watch some sporting events. They also had an outdoor patio (with another TV) if the weather draws you outdoors. 

This place is located right at Elliot Road & 48th Street in the shopping plaza with Safeway. Check it out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Awesome place to go and unwind on a Friday night after a long week.  The new owners just recently re-did the place (actually within the last few months).  They removed the wall separating the dining area and bar, and put up a bunch of new flat screen TV's.  For a \"sports bar\" style place, this place definitely has some better food.  The prices are a bit on the higher side, but they definitely are worth it for what you get.

My favorite dish is the cheese tortellini in white sauce...so GOOD!  Their pizzas are awesome too.  Great service by all waiters/bartenders...been going to this place for a long time and have never had an issue."}
{"text":"We liked this place. It's a \"everybody-knows-everybody\" bar. Service was great, got to watch the Diamondbacks game. Cold beer. Wings were not good enough to get me to return. Okay but not going on any lists. I had a good time listening to the guys next to me call some old friend on speakerphone, totally tanked and trying to explain who they were. Free entertainment."}
{"text":"We go to Brads occasionally because it's our neighborhood bar and we want to support local Ahwatukee business owners. However, we have been complaining about the menu problem at the Yelp or Google site! We've been telling them for over a year that the link to their menu doesn't take you to THEIR menu! It takes you to an Italian restaurants menu! 

We've been told that the owner refuses to have that taken care of! My understanding is that he said... \"nobody cares about that\"! I'm here to tell you that I as well as numerous others DO care about that! I would call and order takeout occasionally if I could see a menu! Give me NO OPTION of a menu and I call someone else for takeout! 

How long will you be a cantankerous bastard and watch money flow OUT of your pocket to other local businesses? I'd bet you lose $5K minimum/month by not taking care of that menu problem! 

The food's good and reasonable but if you don't know WTF they actually have and when you look at their menu it's all Italian food! In which Brads doesn't carry! It's slightly confusing!"}
{"text":"I've never been a sports bar guy. Well... let me stop and rephrase that. I've never found myself frequenting sports bars until I moved to Phoenix. When I moved here, I found that meeting up with new and old friends at sports bars can actually be fun. The key is finding the right sports bars, and Brad's Place fits that bill.

So what, to me, is the \"right\" kind of sports bar? A place where you can go and enjoy some drinks while watching an athletic competition. There are enough tv's to satisfy most, if not all of the patrons, and the service is friendly. Hopefully there's food, Good food is a bonus.

 If I can get all of that without having to deal with the following then I'm a happy camper:

1. Rowdy/Drunk college kids

2. Rowdy/Drunk older dude (possibly shirtless with a painted face) who thinks he's a college kid or

3. Rowdy/Drunk, defensive D-bags who act as though the end result of a sports competition determines whether or not their steroid dealer is going to stop taking their call and Ed Hardy/TapOut/Affliction will continue to produce merch.

Yeah, so basically what I'm saying is that I'm not looking for trouble with anyone, a fight or jail time to result from a trip to a sports bar.

Like I said, on my visit, Brad's Place was the good kind. We sat near the bar and for the most part had a variety of football games to watch on the span of tv's. They had happy hour Sunday morning as well. Can't beat that! 

It's a decent sized place with a patio out front if you feel like sitting outside. On my visit, it wasn't crowded at all. That was great. 

I ordered the breaded pork loin sandwich for lunch and it was surprisingly very good. It was cooked perfectly so that it was still tender. The breading was crispy, but not over cooked or greasy. Same with the accompanying fries. I would absolutely order it again. 

If you're looking for the \"good\" kind of sports bar, Brads Place is the place for you. If you're a person that falls into one of the \"bad\" sports bar categories I mentioned above... Please stay away from here... and get help."}
{"text":"I went to Brad's Place with some friends just to watch college football on a Saturday morning while on vacation... The bartender was nice and friendly... the drinks were inexpensive.  It was very nice to find out that it's a Minnesota pro sports bar! There were plenty of TVs and they had a patio.  Thanks for the hospitality and I will be coming back!"}
{"text":"First and the LAST time I will go to Brads Place. 
Our Uber driver just dropped us off at Brads to enjoy a night of Karaoke. We had 3 couples with us and wanted to have a great night. Went to the bar to order drinks and within 30 seconds the bartender Sarah DENIED service to our girls. 
She told us that our girls were way to intoxicated because my wife was stumbling. My wife has a handicap and always walks with a limp and I am absolutely APPALLED to think she was mistaken for being drunk. This was our very first stop of the night and no one even started to drink yet! We then went over to CACTUS JACKS next door and spent well over $300 on food and drinks  between the 4 couples and had a great safe night of fun. Look around Sarah next time before you judge a person. You might just learn something!"}
{"text":"The service is always amazing . Trivia is always a big draw on Wednesday and Saturday. However the recent minimum wage law made Brad increase his prices . $7.00 for a mug of beer is outrageous, especially when you don't have enough mugs. Advise to Brad spread the cost out to you menu items too."}
{"text":"This place really is just a hole for the local drunks to fall into. I have given it three tries but each time I leave thinking what a dump!  It looks like it was decorated by a 12 year old, the food is terrible and the clientele is annoying. Stay away at all cost!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to Brad's Place for the first time last evening.  And we were completely impressed with everything about this establishment.  The atmosphere was so relaxed and inviting. The service was superb.  The food was fantastic.  I got the fried pork loin sandwich (which like the size of a man hole cover) and $12.99 prime rib dinner... excellent!!  We will definitely be going back again and again.  New favorite hang out."}
{"text":"I called ahead to see if the Ravens vs Red skins would be on a TV and was assured that it would be. I have been twice prior and knew the tv selection would be limited hence why I called ahead. I got to the bar less then 10 minutes later and the same person who did remember my call told me she could not show the game. Poor service, ok food and pure lies to get you in the door."}
{"text":"This place has been so much better since Haunah S has stopped coming. Best bartenders ever."}
{"text":"First time here.  Food was fantastic!

Service was great - it was only 1 woman running the entire show and she did a great job at prompt service to everyone and keeping the drinks refilled.

Prices were reasonable as well.

I plan to come back. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Hit Brad's Place for lunch when the other spot we were aiming for happened to be closed on Sundays. 

Didn't have elevated expectations but the food ended up being quite good!  It's basically a neighborhood sports bar with a midwest flavor. Vikings, Packers, etc. on the walls. 

The food took a while to come & trickled out 1 dish at a time. That might have been a function of lack of staff though as our server was all over the place - running food, behind the bar, in the kitchen. I was also probably least affected because mine came first. Was probably another 15 minutes + before the rest of our table was served.

So as far as my opinion on restaurants, it's mainly about the food. I can deal with service, delay issues if the food is good. Mine was.

I ended up getting the breaded pork sandwich. It was huge. Overlapped the bun by about 3-4 times. It was tasty and the fries were good too. And the rest of the table seemed to like their burgers, dogs & sandwiches.

Definitely wouldn't be averse to trying more of the menu if I ended up back this way."}
{"text":"Stopped into this place for the first time tonight. Not impressed. Me and my girlfriend sat at the bar which was dirty. She then proceeded to squirt water from the soda gun on a nasty bar rag and slop it around to wipe the bar. She asked for id's which is expected but then after my girlfriend gave her hers she sat there and questioned it for 2 minutes...made her walk to the end of the bar and looked her up and down as if that would help her identity her more. How about ask her for some info on the dl? Or a credit card. Won't be back :)"}
{"text":"A friend & I visited this quaint little Awatukee sports bar today for lunch & boy was I surprised! This is not your average sports bar menu. 
Let me begin by saying Brad, the owner is apparently a popular guy in these parts & is known quite well to all the locals. I got a bit lost on my way over and was given directions by three people all willing to help once they found out where I was heading. COOL! 
OK, back to the menu. I had the Bratwurst Burger, yes I said Burger! This thing was Fantastic! And Actual Patty burger made from ground Bratwurst & Bacon! There I have said it, BACON ground inside the burger. HEAVEN. Although the beer selection left something to be desired, I noticed that they were cooking with allot of beer. Score One For Brads Place! A little beer creativity in the kitchen is always a welcome sight. 
Sports: Televisions O Plenty & this is definitely a Viking's Bar. Lots of purple stuff on the walls. As I understand, they have every sports package available and there aren't any bad seats(so to speak). 
The ambiance could be a bit more stylish, but for a local neighborhood they have it down fairly well. Good Local Bar, glad I tried it!"}
{"text":"Always a cold Guinness  on hand!  Friendly staff, good Midwest menu.  Packers, Bears,  vikings fans are all welcome!"}
