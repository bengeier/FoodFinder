{"text":"First time here and we loved it! We've been looking for a great mexican restaurant and found it here. The salsa was very good and spicy. We had a burrito and it was freshly  made. Also a taco de pescado and it was delicious! Been looking for a good fish taco and i finally found the place to get my fix. The hubby had ceviche de camaron which was bomb! A little pricey but well worth it! Definetely coming back!"}
{"text":"This is still a pretty new restaurant in the area but it is definitely a must try! Everything we order had plenty of seafood. Not like other places that are lots of veggies and little seafood. You definitely get what you pay for here, if not more. When you arrive they give you a cup of caldo. Almost like a preview of their food and man was it good. All the waitresses were very helpful they didn't hesitate to attend our table weather we were their table or not. I will definitely be returning here again."}
{"text":"This is a new restaurant in this area, came here for lunch and ordered the shrimp cocktail which didnt have much flavor, however it was packed with shrimp.  Everywhere else i have ordered a cocktail at they skim you on the shrimp. The service was good as well i will eat something else next time and see how that goes."}
{"text":"By far the best michaladas/ seafood! Service is A+ plus, very friend and welcoming. The price is worth it."}
{"text":"I usually don't bash places but this place has the worst service ever they don't know how to manage the place, We stood there for 20mins waiting to be seated when there was 3 tables open but needed to be cleaned but the waitresses didn't even bother to clean them or even pay attention . It was a busy day but that just shows a lack of management and that wasn't the first time that happened.   Iv came here twice and I will never come here again I felt like I was being judged by all the waitresses iv never felt so uncomfortable in a restaurant because of the staff.  The only good thing I have to say about this place is they must have a good cook because the food was good but they should get all new waitresses"}
{"text":"Great food and friendly service. Mainly Spanish speaking waitresses although a couple speak English. Although this spot is fairly new, it's probably one of my more favorite Mariscos spots. Clean looking. The food taste fresh (as fresh as desert Mexican seafood restaurants can get). The bacon wrapped, shrimp stuffed Jalape√±o Popper appetizer is really good. The rojo agua chiles is my favorite (really really spicy). Nothing to knock them on so far so they get a deserved generous 5 from me."}
