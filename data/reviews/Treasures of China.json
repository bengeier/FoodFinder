{"text":"Food was horrible, had a lot crushed bones in it  And it tasted really bad, although the staff was nice and over expensive"}
{"text":"Make's my bowel's cry out for better times.  Why do I insist on torturing myself, I am a glutton for punishment. Perhaps in a past life I threw a baby from a cliff in some sort of sacrificial ceremony and now I am cursed in this life with the inability to make good decisions for myself.  Treasures of China is the proof of life after death, which is ironic since every time I eat here I feel one step closer to the grave."}
{"text":"The food is pretty bad, you can never get a drink refill because the staff is too busy and it's way too crowded even on weekday evenings. It's not worth the trip unless you need a generic buffet place that has tables that can seat really large parties. I had only 2 plates last time I was here because the food was not worth it, even though I could go for more. I remember getting the wonton soup, which had no flavor and I also got over cooked ginger beef with barely any sauce on it.    I don't really like going here, but somehow I've been here three times in the past 2 years and I've never had a good experience, except for last time. You see, through the over tired staff and shoddy food, a young man aged 8 or 9 was seating around 3 tables away from me and he made me smile. He was scrawny, had large glasses and an awful bowl cut his mother gave him, and he wore a large gold chain necklace around his neck that must have weighed as much as him and he wore a 3 Inches of Blood concert t shirt. I stood next to him while picking out my food, and he was talking like he had been listening to rap music all week long, yet had a small town Albertan southern accent of cute mixed in. This kid's image is forever implanted in my mind. Who ever you are kid, you are awesome."}
{"text":"When busy, this place is one or two steps away from breaking out into a complete chaotic food fight. There are babies crying, people running around, parties in every corner with random people doing random things, it's significantly loud! It's crazy.   I'm not really sure why we come here, or why anyone else does, but people certainly do. It's cheap Chinese food, you get excited for it, but when it's all over, you regret it."}
{"text":"The price has gone up and the food quality and taste has gone down. Big Time! Truly the worst good experience in a very long time."}
