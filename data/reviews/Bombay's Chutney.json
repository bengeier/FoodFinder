{"text":"Came here really hungry so by default everything should've tasted good, right?  Well the Aloo in the Aloo Tikki was dense and there wasn't a lot of channa.  Then we ordered the Bindi and Malai Kofta.  Bindi was good but the Malai Kofta was horrible.  It was a yellow colour had an overpowering taste of cardamom and was sweet.  The Kofta were dense balls.  After asking the waiter if it should be sweet he said that's how it comes unless you ask otherwise.   Seriously?  I've eaten this dish a hundred times and this is the first time I got it tasting like a dessert.    The waiter/manager didn't ask if we wanted anything else if we didn't like.  So we just left it and I guess they threw it out.  The Bindi and the roti got them 2 stars.  Don't come with high hopes if you visit."}
{"text":"I have been looking for a \"quick\" place to grab some Indian food to take home. I tried this place on the way home and ultimately was less then impressed. Don't get me wrong, the food was good, however the overall experience was not so much... There was a long wait for my pick-up and while trying to pass the time a language barrier made it difficult to explore new menu items. I did however enjoy a Kingfisher (Indian beer) while I started to write this review... It was a little pricey for take out, and while the food was good, I have had better experiences picking up $7.99 Butter chicken from M&M Meats and taking home for the family!  ; - }"}
{"text":"The Prawn Vindaloo is \"to die for\". This is a great little restaurant :)"}
{"text":"No No No Don't eat here!!!! I was traveling with family and I wanted Indian food. I was so excited to see this close to the hotel. I ordered Chana Masala the menu say that it included rice. I purchased my food and went back to the hotel. What I received was a \"TV dinner\" that they didn't even take out of the packaging. NO KIDDING. and no rice was included. The TV dinner only contained the Chana Masala. AND it was gross. This is a real review. They should be ashamed. Really Ashamed. How do I give no stars? 1 star is to much."}
{"text":"I ate at this location again the other day and had another pleasant experience.  The service was friendly, the food was very enjoyable and the price was reasonable.    I had the Beef Vindaloo with Naan and it was excellent.  (I've previously had the Butter Chicken and Tikka Masala, both of which I also recommend.)    I can't comment on authenticity either.  I was first exposed to Indian cuisine by a friend who brought me here.  I've always enjoyed the food, so I come back.  That's enough for me!"}
{"text":"Food was fantastic with authentic taste however service was terrible ..... I recommend the beef vindaloo .."}
{"text":"I used their  online ordering system that you can order pickups with 10% off.   We ordered a medium butter chicken, mild chicken tikka masala and a veggie samosa. I placed the order online and in a minute they informed me through email that they were preparing my order and it would be ready in about 40 mins. I arrived about 30 mins after and my order was ready to pick up.  The samosa came in a brown paper bad with a big tub of dip.  The chicken tikka masala and butter chicken came in two black tubs sealed like a frozen dinner, so I didn't have to worry about spilling it.   Both the medium butter chicken and mild chicken tikka masala weren't spicy at all so next time we'll order hot.  The samosa was smaller than what we expected and the sauce was ok.  The other food was tasty and the online ordering system was pretty easy to use. Overall not a bad place to try and I didn't have any issues using the ordering system."}
{"text":"My friend brought me to this place and WOW was it ever flavorful!! We had the lamb Birmani which is a delightfully seasoned stir-fried rice; the Allogobi which has cauliflower and potatoes again wonderfully spiced; the delicious and tender chicken Tikka came on a sizzling hot platter accompanied with an extra plate of basmati rice and a large warm daily made Nann bread. I could get addicted if I didn't know how to tame myself!"}
{"text":"Horrible wait times. Just wanted to order some appetizers with friends but were made to wait for 1 hour, my theory is that they were disappointed in the amount of food that we ordered so this was our \"punishment\"."}
{"text":"I have gone with my family to the Burlington location over 4 or 5 times and to this Richmondhill location around 3 times. Clearly obvious I can't get enough of this place. Of all things I tried here, my fiance and I would agree that their lamb korma and garlic naan is the best combination. I also had the paneer makhani and butter chicken which was pretty good. The service can vary as certain servers are more professional and very accomodating than others. Overall recommend this place!"}
{"text":"We ordered the Chili Chicken and the Prawn Vindaloo with Naans, and some samosas for a take out.  Service was polite and quick, packaging was excellent and the food looked really great.  Not sure if we ordered the wrong dishes, but were not delighted with the taste of the food.   The Chilli Chicken was dry, and did not taste very authentic. The prawn Vindaloo was a bit too spicy and sourish and somehow not perfectly balanced.  But somehow everything looked very clean and well made and well packaged ! Will try this place again maybe with the dishes mentioned by some of the people here just to  be sure. Ah, also a bit expensive as compared to most Indian restaurants in the GTA !"}
{"text":"I went back awhile ago and continue to be disappointment.  I recall when they opened up and it sounds like the management had changed the quality of the food and overall service went down hill from there.   I'd recommend folks avoid this place and look for alternatives."}
{"text":"My family and I have been to this restaurant 5 times since our first visit which was back in 2012. This year itself, we have been here 3 times. This shows that the service, and taste of food meets our expectations.  Being Indians, and vegetarians we enjoy the quality of food, and can easily spot if something is wrong in terms of taste, especially if a short cut method has been applied.   Sure it gets busy inside, and there is a wait, but its always good to make a reservation on weekends. We normally order the paneer tikka skewers, a gravy dish such as Dhal Makhani and a dry vegetable dish such as Gobi or Bhaingan Bharta (spelling). The quality of food has been consistent throughout for the most part, except for the naan. Usually we ask that the naan have some butter applied to make it not dry, but even doing so, it still is semi dry.   The staff are very friendly, and we have had no issues with the orders taking longer than usual. The food is always piping hot, and therefore there is no need to complain about the temperature of the food. The spice level is perfect.   Definitely recommend this place to locals and to those who want to venture out a little bit."}
{"text":"My favourite Indian restaurant to go to for my curry fix! The restaurant is definitely small but cozy. The staff is friendly and the food there is absolutely to die for! Prices are pretty good good, especially considering the quality of the food."}
{"text":"Came here one day for lunch. It was the 4.99 lunch special sign that got me curious.   4.99 item if you're wondering is Bombay chicken fingers 6 pieces served with fries. Must be for the frugal students at the high school next door.   Interior:  Beige and orange colour theme. 12 tables inside with glass top and artistic inlays, few tables bench seating. Restaurant is in the corner unit of the plaza with one big bay window providing natural light. There's spot lighting with a recessed ceiling. Wood chairs with beige cushionn beige and orange interior. Bar/Cash is tucked in a dark corner in the front.  Food:  I ordered Beef Vindaloo 7.99  Dish flavourful spicy nice smooth texture filled with tender beef pieces. The Naan (bread) was huge and serves on a platter on it's own it was warm and tasted excellent.  I received a good amount and it arrived hot and without too much delay. I'd re-visit."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with their bhel puri . We ordered two plates of Bhelpurifor snacks .They charged us  $6:00 for a plate for puffed rice with some sauce and onions . This was nothing close to Bhel puri  . There was no puri in it ..We called them to check if it was a mistake and he told us that is not their main dish .. then why are they selling it ?? It just left a bad taste in our mouth . We could have got a thali for this price from another restaurant"}
{"text":"Recently found this place because my spouse and I were looking for an Indian restaurant that could replace our craving for Indian food when Nataraj shut down.  We were pleasantly surprised. Even though the food takes about 30-40 minutes to get to our table after ordering, the chicken tikka masala and butter chicken are scrumptous!  We've been there several more times since our first visit, bringing our friends and family. Nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Went here one evening to try their food. Ordered a thali, chicken tikka masala and biryani. Biryani wasn't up to the mark but the other two items were delicious. Really yummy........ Quite place with a few customers that evening as it was a weekday. Will be going again for sure as we love Indian food"}
{"text":"One of the best Indian restaurant in GTA. I took my girlfriend with me for a dinner and they surprised me. Delicious food,we ordered Chicken masala and chilli chicken it comes with rice and butter naan. We also drink masala tea which is good. This place is too far from my home but my girlfriend want me to go again. See you Bombay soon"}
{"text":"DINE IN EXPERIENCE Have always been a huge fan of Indian food and definitely love butter chicken. My husband is a very picky and skeptical eater. He will only stick to the same restaurants where he knows it's safe and food is always good. He gave me a thumbs up when he gave this restaurant a passing mark for good butter chicken. The price of the dinner butter chicken was $16.99 and I don't think it's worth the price for about 4-5 pieces of chicken. It does come with rice or a massive naan. It's the biggest naan I've every seen made. You have a choice of plain or garlic naan. There might've been a third option but I can't seem to remember. Food is delicious, I definitely will be coming here more than once. Oh and their beef and veggie samosa is delicious.  STAFF It's family owned it seems and the food is authentic. The staff is nice and will be checking up on you to see how's the food.   TAKE OUT Take out does take a while as they are making it from scratch. It's best that you call in to order. It took about 40 mins for them to prepare our take out order on 3 dinner butter chicken meals.   PARKING If you are dining in that plaza on the weekend, good luck finding parking. There's a lot of great restaurants in this plaza and there's just not enough parking."}
{"text":"Great Indian cuisine in Richmond Hill!  They have a lunch express which was a great portion.  Food was fresh and tasty.  Took a little long to prepare, but was worth the wait."}
{"text":"Was very skeptical when we decided to have dinner here, but I was impressed with the food.   We ordered the hot appetizer platter, butter chicken with roti and lamb tikka with naan. Portion size of the platter was generous, enough for 3-4 people to share. Love the veggies Samosa, somewhat different from traditional Samosa, they used an almost wonton skin life wrapping, very crispy and not doughy at all!  The butter chicken and lamb tikka were milder than I expected. The butter chicken is much sweeter than others, but the sauce is very good for dipping with your naan. The lamb was cooked nicely, very tender and juicy, again wish it could be more flavourful."}
{"text":"This would be my first time ordering Indian food. Obviously, I found this place on Yelp since that's my go-to when I'm unsure of quality and service. Today, I ordered the chicken tikka to go. I was the only customer there, and the lady said about 25 minutes (keep in mind that all the staff were sitting and eating together at a table). I figured fine, it would take a while for my food...15 minutes past, and the staff finally got up from the table and all went to the back. First of all, did I really have to wait for my food to be made because nobody wanted to get up and prepare it? Secondly, why does everyone have to go together to the back and leave me alone questioning where my food is? Anyway, after about 5 minutes my food was finally ready and I left.   Once I got to work and was about to dive into my food, I realized, they didn't supply me with any napkins or plastic cutlery. Woopty doo, how would anyone be able to eat their food? Whatever it was fine, I found a fork in the kitchen at work. The packaging for the take out food was very interesting...remember how I said my food was basically prepared in 5 minutes? Unless if they have some packaging machine at the back of the restaurant, my food literally looked like it had the same packaging as those in microwaveable food. You know the black plastic tray then the clear plastic film on top? That's exactly how I got it. Pretty odd to me. Wasn't very much helpful either when I couldn't finish it all during my work break and had to take it home...no cover for my food obviously!   Lastly, I'm not sure how usually Indian food is priced. As I said it was my first time. But anyway, I feel like it was pretty pricey for the amount of food I got. I paid in total for the chicken tikka and a can of Coke, a little over $19.   Don't know if I'll go back here. Maybe if I'm in the area and want some Indian food. Going to look around Richmond Hill for more Indian restaurants to compare."}
{"text":"There really is nothing quite like driving around with a friend, unsure what to eat and then deciding to roll the good old Yelp app dice and stumble upon what I can only describe as pure culinary gold!  Bombay's Chutney, the little Indian restaurant tucked away in the west corner of the plaza at Bayview and Major Mackenzie in Richmond Hill, literally blew my mind, my taste buds but not my wallet!  We walked into a near empty restaurant, normal seeing as it was 8:30pm on a Thursday, the staff looked at us and I know they were likely hoping we wouldn't be very demanding as closing time was nearing (I hate doing this to restaurants at the last minute - but WE WUZ HUNGRY).  Quick to service us, our waitress checked on us twice quickly within the first 5 minutes of being seated but thankfully for her, this was not my first Indian Rodeo, I knew what I was coming for and I was coming in HOT!!  For our appetizer we  decided to share 2 items: Pani poori and 2 Beef samosa's. The Pani poori was just I had remembered it at other Indian favs adn we devored this DIY appetizer quickly and with little shame. Moving hungrily onto the Beef samosas, I was floored by how fresh they were even at this late hour. Perfectly cooked and not overly greasy - double YUM!  Our mains came shortly there after and we both ordered Naan with our meals and decided to share a rice (which ended up being totally unnecessary). The rice was unnecessary because Bombay's Chutney makes the freshest and Biggest naan bread I've ever seen. Like ever! No seriously it was massive! More than enough for all your sauce and scooping needs.  I had chicken Tikka Masala. Lots of onion and peppers. Flavorful but not overly spicy - really enjoyed my choice of falvour over spice (usually I'm a vindaloo kinda guy).  My friend had butter chicken which was in 2 words \"yummy and awesome\". Seriously I tried a bite and note only was the chicken cooked perfectly like my own the flavour from the sauce was rich and filled my mouth to the point that if I breathe the right way I can 'almost' taste it still *drools excessively*  The biggest surprise of the day was the bill. $44 almost on the dot for 2 mains, 2 appetizers and an extra serving of rice - WOW. There was also lots of leftovers so we're looking at 2-4 servings worth for such a nominal fee - totes worth it!  Far and away GHEE BEST Indian cuisine I have eaten in quite some time and a more than pleasant surprise.   To quote Guy Ferri - BOMB DOT COM!!!  5/30"}
{"text":"I find the service very sad and it feels like they dont want to be there. Food did not seem so fresh. Lamb biryani was tasty but the lamb pieces were tough. There were fried onions on top which were store bought and not fresh. They stuck in my throat. I find the portion size small for the price. On occasion the paneer is not fresh and tough to chew. Ive been avoiding going but admittedly there are no indian restaurants in richmond hill."}
{"text":"Bombay's Chutney is a neat little Indian Restaurant located in the heart of Richmond Hill. I have eaten here on many occasions my guests and I have always enjoyed our meal and the experience.   Religiously, I will start my dinner with an order of beef samosas. They arrive at your table piping hot served along side some stellar tamarind chutney. The beef filling is bountiful and seasoned well; these will forever be a staple of mine. From the tandoor I would typically select the chicken tikka, seekh kebabs or paneer tikka. For mains the butter chicken here will make the cut every time. The blend of masala and spices is near perfect and the boneless chicken pieces are tender and definitely pre-marinated. I've eaten butter chicken everywhere, and BC's BC holds its own.    It is important to note that if I were vegetarian I would be most pleased with this restaurant. I find most veggie heads love paneer, as do I. Bombay's Chutney boasts 5 vegetarian curries which showcase paneer: Chili paneer, paneer makhni (butter sauce), saag paneer (spinach), karahi paneer and mattar paneer (peas). In addition to the plethora of paneer dishes they have several other vegetarian ones including my absolute favourite, Malai Kofta.   To accompany the dishes you can order biryani or naan. Unfortunately I have never tried the biryani because their garlic naan has always been way too spot on to deviate away from. The naan is brought to your table straight from the tandoor and is always perfectly cooked. If you order the garlic rendition it will be brushed with butter then absolutely riddled with garlic bits before going into the tandoor. The garlic bits caramelize and crisp up and my goodness it's perfect.    Overall a solid experience each and every time I visit this venue. The only quam I have with BC is that they now have a huge sign at the front of the establishment advertising a $4.99 lunch, I feel that this takes away from the class of the restaurant a bit, but you gotta do what you gotta do.   Service is always awesome and they have a bar complete with various wines, liquors and beers including Kingfisher! Nice."}
{"text":"Overall 3 star with a 1 star briyani. But overall, okay Indian food. I might add that the naan and curry were good.  This is my second time at the restaurant. It Offers North Indian food with a decent variety of dishes. The restaurant is small, quaint with simple yet nice decor.   The naan, paneer was great flavourful. Huge naan and a good quantity of curry. The briyani is where my problem lies- used frozen vegetables, and the spices tasted weird, likes they were raw and hadn't been cooked out and infused- it wasn't worth the third bite. Nah-uh!  Get the naan (which is huge!) and curries, and Maybe he sizzling platters. Try a mango shake too!"}
{"text":"Wish Yelp would allow half stars, as I would rate Bombay's Chutney 3 1/2 stars.  We've frequently driven by but never stopped.  One day we decided to visit for lunch.  The space is small but cozy.  Service was efficient.  I had the channa masala with naan.  The channa came in a deceptively small looking copper pot which actually held a lot of food.  It was nicely flavoured and the medium spice level was just right.  The naan was fresh from the oven, huge and thankfully grease free.    Mr leny had the meat thali which he said was delicious and very filling.    There seemed to be a good selection of veg and non-veg options at fair prices.  We will be definitely be back to try other menu items."}
{"text":"I absolutely love their food. I usually get their butter chicken with rice and a chicken tikka masala with nann and it is so reasonably priced for the quality and amount of food you get. The only thing is i prefer to takeout and eat it at home than to sit inside."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place, but was disappointed.  Greeted by a wall of smokiness, which was due to the lack of ventilation. Opening a door was a great idea, but the door was an \"Emergency Exit\" and behind a group of approximately 14 who immediately closed the door as soon as they got cold.  Waited over 30 minutes to get our food, and tables that had sat down before us also did not have their mains out yet. As well, the two female servers would regularly go into the kitchen to help with the cooking (very probable), so if you wanted a water refill or the bill, for example, there was no one to ask from time to time.  The food itself: -Mattar Paneer was served in a watery sauce, but otherwise okay.  -Karahi Chicken lacked the ginger taste; there were thin slices of ginger, but they were tasteless. There were also no visible tomatoes; maybe they were in the sauce. However, the sauce itself had flavour and was not watery. -Naan was slightly burnt in a few places, but were large pieces  Atmosphere: While the restaurant was nearly full, the tables were almost crammed together, with just enough space for the waitresses to walk between. There was unused space between the eating area and the kitchen (other than the washrooms) that they could have broken down the wall, added some space and a few more tables.  While drink service was okay and the bill came to under $30.00, I will not be going back soon."}
{"text":"This is not a great place to go to if you're allergic to dairy and, like me, don't know that much about Indian food. It took the server and me many tries until we found a dish that we could eat (she wasn't too familiar with the dairy content of the dishes, either.)   I ordered the lamb vindaloo which was very good, and my friend had the paneer makhni, which he loved and lorded over me for the entire meal, in its cheesy, creamy goodness.  Atmosphere is casual but comfortable, service is friendly and prices are pretty good.  Tasty, but will probably not return, due to the difficulty with ordering non-dairy stuff, which is generally not a problem in Indian restaurants."}
{"text":"I'm not usually a fan or know too much about Indian food, but I really liked this place. I'm usually turned off from Indian food because of the spice blends, so I might not be the best judge in terms of authenticity, but in terms of overall flavour, this was quite enjoyable. I ordered the tandoori chicken and it was huge! It was like eating half a chicken. The Naan was also very good. My only complaint was the service, which was quite slow. I give it 4 stars because I enjoyed my meal, but I can't really comment on authenticity because I'm not exposed to enough Indian food."}
{"text":"I love Bombay's Chutney!  I am a regular here and it is definitely my go-to restaurant if I'm looking for a satisfying lunch on my day off work.  I admit, I do come as often as once a week sometimes because I cannot get enough of their Butter Chicken.  The lunch special of their Butter Chicken includes the Butter Chicken with your choice of Naan Bread or Rice and a side of salad.  I always end up getting their Naan Bread.. might I add that the piece of Naan they give you is enormous!  I've only come here a few times for dinner service and I have to say that the portion sizes for the lunch and dinner are exactly the same, so I'd rather just come here for lunch rather than paying more for dinner service for the same amount of food.  I think for dinner I've only ever tried their Lamb Tikka the very first time I came, but I wasn't a fan of it as was dry and tasteless.  I have yet to try their Tandoori Chicken, which is probably the only other dish I would try or their Samosas, which I've heard many good things about.  Maybe next time, if I go for dinner service, I will consider trying a new dish.  The customer service here is not always the greatest and really depends on whom is working at the time I go in.  They do not really seem enthusiastic about working there, especially when on the phone.  But I usually call in for take-out and by the time I get to the restaurant the food is ready for me to take home to eat so no complaints there. I highly recommend checking out the lunch specials! Mmm Mmmm Good!"}
{"text":"Horrible .. if you care for your Heath stay far away from this place. I ordered butter chicken and other veggie dishes, my chicken was raw not by just looking it could I tell when u bite it, it was raw. The owner would not believe me and wanted to come to place to get it out of the garbage to believe  it. I have never in my life had a restaurant owner behave the way he has."}
{"text":"Excellent. We arrived as they opened and got our order in just before the place filled up.  Always start with the classics. Butter chicken and palak paneer, with naan and papadums and some pickles and chutneys. Chai and mango lassi were both excellent. Food is fresh and very good. I've been to countless Indian joints and this one is in the top 5.   Thick and yummy curries!  Alex"}
{"text":"Just wanted naan it took them about an hour, but naan was really good hence the three star"}
{"text":"Service was not so quick the day I went.  We ordered a Chicken Biryani and a Beef Curry with Garlic Naan, and two Samosas.  The food was decent.   Samosas were not too fresh and wasn't very crispy.  The curry was very mild for indian food and felt that there wasn't enough spices.   The best of the night was the Naan, as it appeared to be stone baked made from fresh dough.  Service was not so good that night, we went fairly later (8:30?) and many of the tables already gone.  However, the dishes remained, it felt very strange for us to be eating our food with dirty dishes on all the neighbouring tables.   When we finished our meals, there was nobody at the service bar.  Took us a while for us to finally find someone (he was outside) to finally tally our bill.  Overall, the food wasn't bad, I'd probably go again to try other dishes."}
{"text":"Went here tonight with 2 friends. The beef samosas are amazing. We ordered the chili chicken which took 40 minutes to come out. We were pretty much ready to leave. Had to ask for water multiple times before we got it. Asked for napkins and only got the one wrapped with the spoon and fork. The chili chicken was lacking in everything. It wasn't even hot, the top looked dried out and there was way too many onions. The chicken itself was dry and not spicy or very tasteful. i'd go back for take out samosas, thats about it."}
{"text":"Came in for a late lunch, was seated, and ignored for 5 minutes.  Only one server waiting on 4-5 tables.  I rarely lay down a 1star, but here I sit at Swiss Chalet across the parking lot. (I walked out)  I was looking forward to a curry but will have to find somewhere else -- where the employees head is not firmly planted in his a**.   LOL.   Oh well......"}
{"text":"Great flavours and good sized portions. I've been here at last half a dozen times and I've never been disappointed. Steady stream of people and lots of takeout. While food can take a while to come out, it's definitely worth the wait as the curries have been excellent. I've tried the Butter Chicken, various kormas and vindaloos and again, they've all been quite excellent. Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"The lamb biryani that I had was delicious and very filling. I especially enjoyed the metal ornate bowl that it was served in. Price-wise, everything could have been a bit cheaper (maybe by a dollar or two)."}
{"text":"Having frequented Bombay's Chutney a variety of times, I can honestly say I am a fan of their food. The samosas as an appetizer are always delicious, the butter chicken poutine is a must try and I love their biryani and butter chicken mains! However, prices may run a little high - as a rule of thumb, the beef samosas are $0.99 each and their lunch special for butter chicken is $10.99 served with a naan and around 5 pieces of chicken (although these pieces of chicken are extremely tender and a personal favourite!)   If you're looking to try some delicious Indian food, I'd recommend dining at Bombay's during lunch for a cheaper price!"}
{"text":"I used to love this restaurant. Last night, my girlfriend (I'm the boyfriend on her Yelp account) and I went to get some food to go. Now, I don't know if what followed is some indication of the standards at this particular location dropping dramatically or some kind of out of the ordinary f%&*-up, but I'm fairly certain the shrimp that was used in the royal platter was off. Like, smelled like maggots and garbage-juice off. We spent 58$ for this platter and 6 beef samosas and almost all of the meats smelled/tasted like they were starting to turn.   It's important to point out that when I came to the restaurant, they had mentioned that they just got power back because the winds yesterday were intense enough to cut the power in a few places. I'm not sure how long they were without power but I suppose this could be a potential explanation as to why all of the meats were smelling....sour.   I'm very disappointed that anyone could serve the shrimp that I smelled and if the people running the kitchen can't tell the difference between good meat and bad meat then they shouldn't be running a restaurant because they're going to kill someone. It felt like I was living an episode of Gordon Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares.   Ignoring all that, if this was a freak accident and the food is normally the quality that I remember from before, it's still definitely not worth the now jacked-up prices they've implemented. Which used to be 1-2$ less for the same items. Even back then they were still a little high. Now, they definitely would not be worth it in my opinion. I definitely can't trust this location anymore after what happened."}
{"text":"Just to be cleared. I'm only basing my rating on 2 dishes because they're good at it. This place make one of my favorite butter chicken  and pretty Dezzzz vegetarian samosa. Legit, authentic Indian food feel. Their portion is small, but dinner for 2 I do recommend it with 2 serving of different roti, is satisfying enough. If you are a bigger guy. This might not be enough. (So be aware)  I can't suggest the other dishes thou I have tried it. It aren't the best. But I want others to know what they do well on since they do deserve it."}
{"text":"the food is good but for Indian food it's a bit pricey, I guess their main customer base is all the office workers nearby (Microsoft, Loblaws, GSK)."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times before. It's the best Indian food in the Richmond hill area.   This time we ordered the tandoori platter and chicken Bryianni. With 2 veggie samosas to start.   The samosas were good, filled with potatoes and peas and tasted very fresh.   The tandoori platter was filled with meat and salad. The salad was old brown iceberg lettuce, with big chunks of raw onion, not impressed with that!   The chicken Bryianni is my fav and it's amazing! Get it every time! Medium heat is enough for me.   Service wasn't great, was waiting for water for a long time. Decor doesn't make sense and is not very welcoming.   Overall, good food, bad service!"}
{"text":"One of our Richmond Hill faves, take out or eat in. Love the Chicken Tikka Masala. Lollipop Chicken a favorite for the kids.  Malai Kofta was a new one on me, and quite tasty. Always very polite service."}
{"text":"I've been looking for a place to top Bombay Bhel but this one is far from it. Flavors not as distinct and the garlic naan doesn't even come close to Bombay Grill. Why do they all have to use the name Bombay? Nothing really noteworthy here but didn't taste bad either. I always get butter chicken and one new dish. The reason for this is that I know I will at least like one dish because butter chicken is always yummy. The second dish was some kind of spicy lamb curry flavored dish. I guess the search continues but I doubt I will find any other Indian restaurant that will top Bombay Bhel."}
{"text":"I frequently eat at this restaurant.  I have for many years.  Today I had the beef rongenjosh.  The service was good and the sauces were spiced nicely.  The beef was very hard and dry though.    I often have curries and like my meat stewed and soft and to be moist.  Not like the other foods that I have had here and enjoyed.  I will come again, but will not try this dish here again.  The location is handy if you are doing a lot of shopping with a big parking lot.  They do have beer and liquor, and the chefs are quite friendly."}
{"text":"Awful watered down curry with no flavor and bland. No filling in the paraths. It seemed like the food was reheated. Would never go back"}
{"text":"First time ordering from her and I got the Aloo Gobi and Channa Masala. My aloo Gobi didn't just have a hair in it a whole HAIR BALL! Not going back."}
{"text":"Mattar paneer wasn't like anything I've had before had 2'bites and threw it out the paneer was cut very think gravy was tasteless  Butter chicken was average at best  Garlic naan was great though   I personally wouldn't be back as 5 mins after I was finished eating I had to use the washroom. And I have a very strong stomach."}
{"text":"I've tried many Indian restaurants in the GTA yet keep finding myself coming back to Bombay's Chutney. I grew up with authentic home made Indian food as a child and was able to relive those kind of flavours here. The Vindaloo is spiced to perfection and the lamb chunks melt in your mouth. The Biryani is also a must or some garlic naan as perfect side dishes. Onion Bhaji here is probably the best in the GTA. The Tandoori platter or the Royal platter are both of excellent variety and grilled to perfection. Pair everything with yogurt and mint chutney to elevate the dishes. Kheer can be hit or miss, but definitely a great desert option!"}
{"text":"This is like having Indian food from the mall.  More like a fast food eatery. No ambience Disappointed but now I know.... We tried a few dishes but all seemed to have tame flavours for pedestrian appetites."}
{"text":"As I sit here in a food coma, I reflect on the flavours that have exploded.  Of course I ordered palak paneer, rice and naan; what else is new. I opted for take out and was pleasantly surprised with how hot the dish stayed during my 'road trip' home. I got lost, filled up on gas, did some dishes and pretty much just lolligagged for about 15 minutes thereafter. I did find it odd that the take out is in a vacuum sealed package. I immediately regretted spending $13 on what looked like a frozen tv dinner.  After I opened the package, I couldn't resist but to dive in. Unfortunately, I'm that girl that will eat anything, regardless how it looks. I was extremely happy to find the meal was fresh made and sooo yummy. I got mild but am thinking the next time I go I'll get medium. There are plenty of paneer chunks too. The naan bread is bigger than my head.   I've been eating for about 25 minutes and am stuffed. Looking at my plate, I've eaten exactly half the portion they gave which is remarkable since I am a bottomless pit.   Needless to say I'll return for some more palak paneer. Perhaps I'll try the matar paneer and some dal.   My bill came to $13 for dinner. I would say the portion sizing could feed two. They would be content."}
{"text":"Ugh, not really, thanks tho. I would try again maybe it was an off night? Food was too soupy. I am an indian food snob tho. Yeesh. Whats up with this pre made mango lassi shit? Some a hole is making a killing selling highlighter fluid and passing it off as mango lassi."}
{"text":"Good portions and they do not skimp. Good taste and lots of meat and rice. The spice is just right. Also polite customer service and cashier. Cannot complain about much (okay they could stay open later there is no late Indian dinner anywhere)"}
{"text":"Butter chicken lacks chicken! Barely any chicken. Expensive for the sparse portions one gets at this place. Dirty spot to dine with friends! Avoid. Avoid Bombay's Chutney.  Try Mt Everest restaurant (804 Eglinton E) and you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Mediocre as far as Indian food goes. It's relatively more authentic than fast food chains, substantially more expensive, and definitely doesn't hit the spot. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Tried the lamb Biryani for takeout. Cool packaging. Higher price point within GTA for this similar item and food was rather bland. Very little meat to rice ratio."}
{"text":"One of my go-to places for indian food as its close to my house and the food is consistently above average. Service is hit and miss, sometimes it's very good, sometimes you wait forever to get anything. It's more of a takeout place, however they won't do the thali as takeout and that's my favourite thing to get. Small, clean restaurant, but again, more of a takeout place than sit down restaurant."}
{"text":"One word describes my experience here (ugh). I had driven by this place a few times and gave this place a chance last week. Like sushi, indian food is hit and miss and this place was a miss. I had the 'butter chicken' and it was very dry (I have had butter chicken before and this dish almost tasted like it was made the day before) I had a side order of nam bread with this (which also tasted very stale) This restaurant was definitely understaffed and poorly managed. If you are craving indian food, do not come here!"}
{"text":"I have to start by saying that this review would have been 5 stars if not for the service.   I had a craving for Indian food tonight so on the strength of Kris U.'s review, we decided to try Bombay's Chutney.  The restaurant was not busy when we arrived but it still took some time for one of the waitresses to come by and take our order.  After waiting over 30 minutes and still not receiving our beef samosa's (and watching take out customers get served before us), we decided to pay for our flat beer and leave. The owner/manager was, at this point, serving take out customers. Prior to that time, there were two inexperienced waitresses serving all the sit down and take-out customers on what had become a busy night. The manager begged us to stay and promised that the food was ready. We decided to stay and about 5 minutes later were rewarded with lukewarm beef samosas (which were actually tasty but would have been delicious if they had been hot).  We then waited another 15 minutes for our main courses despite being told that everything was ready 20 minutes before then.   We were getting up to leave a second time after seeing yet more take out orders being filled before ours when the manager finally brought out our food. I will admit it - It was all very good. The garlic naan was huge and served hot. The shrimp vindaloo was an explosion of flavour and the perfect combination of heat and spice. The chicken tikka masala contained tender white meat in a mild and very flavourful sauce.  The kachoomar salad was awesome.  Very fresh and crunchy with a delicious light lemon mint dressing.  It was the perfect accompaniment to the spicy dishes.   Although we were ultimately served great good, the entire experience was very frustrating and disappointing. The manager did not find our frustration worthy of any sort of discount and excused the entire experience with the words: \"good Indian food takes time. Look at all the take out customers waiting. They all know the food is good\". We left with him promising to \"take care of us next time\". Yeah right.  I think \"take care\" means something different to him as it does to us.   As much as I liked the food, I can't see myself rewarding this establishment with my business again in the future given the service and attitude we experienced. Even giving them my take out business would make me hate myself a little (ok, maybe a lot).   The search for a great Indian restaurant in Richmond Hill continues..."}
{"text":"This place has been around for quite awhile but I rarely see them bz!  I thought the place would die out but it keeps chugging along.  Good for them!  I went there a couple of years ago for lunch with a client but not been back since.  I didn't think it was any different from Bombay Bhel (I think there is a relationship).  As the Bombay Bhel become BOMB-ed and BAIL'ed lately, I needed another place to get my curry-on.  Ended up trying the Chutney!  Wow, the food and flavours were great.  Don't know why I didn't come back to this place sooner.  Been here twice over the last week with the wife.  Seems the place does really well on weekends and they have a good take out biz.  Have to say, the Vindaloo is very good and the heat is nice.  The two veggie curries we've tried were passable but not on the favourite list.  Veggie sammies are tasty, beef sammies were good.  Will be going back to go down the rest of the appy list and try some tandoor stuff. If you are in a hurry - this curry isn't the place you are looking for.  The service is slow - I don't mind as I'm hoping that each delicious pot is being made fresh just for us.  Yum!  Cheers."}
{"text":"Ordered the butter chicken with some naan which was pretty good until we noticed the uncooked pink colour inside the chicken. Service was moderately slow despite how slow traffic was inside the restaurant. Naan bread was generously portioned. Had the chicken not been undercooked I would have given it a better rating. Overall 2/5 stars. Good value but hit and miss with the food."}
{"text":"Food is great but sooo over priced and the portions can be inconsistent and terrible for the price"}
