{"text":"Tonight I watched people pay off the bouncers to enter before me.  I waited for over 20 minutes as multiple parties pulled out $20-50 dollars A PIECE and stood in front of the regular line to pay off the bouncers and enter before those in the traditional line. I was appalled as I watched the blatant bribery occurring before me, and later asked the bouncers if this was an accepted practice, only to them rejecting my question and asking me to leave. This is unbelievable, and the KK has lost my service for life. How dare they allow such shady business practices; I do not want to participate in a bar willing to see past its willing patrons for a few measly dollars on the side."}
{"text":"So to get things started they play the same playlist every night. My poor friend has to listen to this average music as she rests her weary head each night. Second: these weak cheerleader bartenders are slower than my grandma who can't walk and never want to serve us all the alcohols. Just trying to get crunk with my friends!!! LET ME GET LIT. Third: we ordered Miller lite beers (triple hops brewed) and they finessed us and gave us BUSH LITE!!! Im sorry what???? Not what I ordered??? I thought this was America. I feel so cheated. I cannot even believe what is happening to me right now"}
{"text":"This bartender sucks. I know that this place hires hot girls for a reason, but it is still a bar, and when I go to a bar I expect to be able to buy alcohol. Unfortunately, this bartender made it incredibly difficult. A friend and I were at the back bar getting drinks. This woman served everyone around us at and then moved to the other side of the bar and started to serve everyone over there. What???? We were standing there for over 5 minutes waiting while she served every single other person. She would not even make eye contact with us. Finally she sort of looked around the bar to see who to serve next when I shouted \"EXCUSE ME\" to try and get her freaking attention. She begrudgingly came over and STILL without making eye contact asked what we wanted. We asked for 5 vodka sodas. All 5 of these drinks were maybe 1/5 alcohol, 4/5 soda. That is not the ratio for any cocktail ever, especially not the ones I know and love at the KK. She provided us with terrible service and terrible drinks. We did not give a tip."}
{"text":"My friends and I frequent this bar on the weekends but yesterday was the first time we attempted their food (we were desperate). The cheese curds were surprisingly good, as were the chicken tenders. Good bar food is a must and they have it! Obviously not homemade but it will do the trick.  It's definitely not the cleanest place and the crowd can be questionable. But hey, it's a college bar in a college town."}
{"text":"I think my friends secretly hate me...I'll give the good, the drinks are pretty damn good. Some really nice eye candy.  The bad why is it so sticky??? I'm hoping spilled drinks and not body fluids......I understand college bar but ladies have some class as much as I love the hot outfits seriously pick a person not 8. I did actually buy 2 guys drinks for having the dirtiest pick up lines. I agree on other reviews if your're looking for a STD, maybe roofied this is the club for you.   Oh the bartenders are awesome make great fun shots"}
{"text":"I've only been here once but the time I had was pretty awesome. $3 pitchers of bud?!?!?!?! Thats awesome! There were not many girls in this place then again I don't remember seeing that many women in Madison. I thought it was supposed to be a college town? Oh well I liked this place and if SDSU ever plays UW again I definitely go back."}
{"text":"Frequent this place for lunch. Great burgers and steak sandwiches."}
{"text":"Went to this bar on a Thursday and Friday night.  Originally from college towns and then living in DC, my friends had told me there were high expectations for nightlife in Madison.  Unfortunately, we were sorely disappointed for Thursday night in particular.  This was one of the stops on Thursday, well, and on Friday night as well.  We may have gotten there somewhat early, around 11 o'clock, but there were 4 people there.  Seriously, 4.  It was hilarious watching a girl peek in and tell her friends \"they're carding guys, it's a no-go\".  Really took me back.  Friday night was better, there were more people, but it was just OK.  I guess the dance-off that took place saved it from a one-star rating."}
{"text":"This is one of the WORST bars I've ever been to. I made a long trip from Nebraska and saw an unfortunate loss but still wanted to have a good time. So I went to the Kollege Klub and the bouncers were taking bribes so long story short me and my buddies paid $45 to get in under the table. They probably would have let me in if I was a minor.   That's not all! I got kicked out twice, the first time for dancing and the second because the bouncer didn't like me. This is the worst bar EVER! I left my coat call the place and get made fun of by the staff. So don't forget your coat. Also they have a ton of cock roaches  in their kitchen so don't get the food. This is the worst establishment that I have ever been to in my life. I hope this place gets closed down in the future for how terrible the management, bartenders, and bouncers are."}
{"text":"I was brought here by some UW alums, as we were all in town for football.  Any bar that has Spotted Cow on tap gets a one-star bump from me, so they get... one star.  I get that working here makes you a big-swingin-d!*k in the UW-Madison social circle, but holy frijoles, a more colossal collection of douchenozzle employees would be hard to find anywhere outside of NY/LA.  This is possibly the rape-iest bar I've ever been to, and I live, work, and play in Scottsdale, the fertile crescent of rape-y bars.  I can't wait for my next trip to Madison, but this place will not be on the list."}
{"text":"I will make fun of this place until the day I die, but I will find myself ending up and this venereal palace of Jersey Chasers, Frat Boys, Athletes, and underagers for the rest of my undergraduate life.  At first I was dragged here, but now I embrace every experience like its my last. Girls clothing options are particularly funny, along with popped collars and ed hardy T shirts from the frat guys.   Also your best chance of running into Ron Dayne outside of the state fair autograph sessions."}
{"text":"If you've ever said to yourself, \"Hey, know what I don't have but want? Gonorrhea! I should get gonorrhea!\" but don't want to have sex with someone, the KK is the best place you could possibly go. If, however, you do not want to get gonorrhea, syphilis, or any other of the countless airborne genital-infections, I would avoid this place. I don't even want to think about the kind of people who have fun here."}
{"text":"The KK! Your quintessential college student bar scene! There's just something about standing in an overly crowded room with everyone wearing the same colors before a football game! I would advise that you have a few drinks before going in...you know, so you can stand the crowds and the music (am I showing my age)? And don't go with the expectation of getting a specialty cocktail. Just go for the experience and the drinking glove!"}
{"text":"This is the bar to go to if you are looking to get or give STDs.    No thanks."}
{"text":"Went up to a security guy to tell him there was a leak in the ceiling creating a puddle on the a floor. Told him it could end up being a huge lawsuit. Told me the floor ends up drenched at the end of the night anyway. That's great... NOT. Then later in the night, another guy told us to leave, didn't ask nicely -- told us he didn't see our feet moving...called him a dick & still think he is one. Don't go here, trashy, not safe, and nobody cares about the people in the bar, but more so about the people getting out of the bar at 2am"}
{"text":"This is a wonderful family-owned college bar. They have delicious food and great lunch specials throughout the work week ranging from taco salads to the infamous 'Klub' Burger - all equally as good. While there are a lot of athletes and a majority of the greek community here, they are not the only types of people you'll find. You can expect lots of loud music, fun dancing, and a really long line on game days. There's a reason the line goes down the block to Walgreens- it's a fun time. So get over the fact that you may have to wait an extra minute for a drink on a Saturday night and stop by. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Not bad, it's pretty chill and the drinks are cheap.  I would never go on weekends cuz it gets way to packed, but hey it's a chill place where you can talk or dance."}
{"text":"Had some friends come from out of town and wanted to check some local bars. Stood there for over an hour with cash and card in my hand and they just blatantly ignored me! If your not a white American, this is the perfect place to go get yourself and your friends humiliated."}
{"text":"Hands down the best bar in Madison.   As someone who would frequent the KK on multiple nights of the week, this bar truly encompasses what the University of Wisconsin is all about: energy, sports, and a great time.   You can go there Tuesday through Friday and find amazing drink specials like $1 grilled cheese during FAC (Friday After Class), as well as, 2 for 1s, beer and shot night, and more. The food is unreal, you can go there and get a great, cheap breakfast, lunch or dinner.   This bar is the quintessential Badger sports experience. Especially if you are there for a football game, before, during or after, you will find this place packed with the game playing through the speakers and everyone wearing red.    If you are EVER in Madison, this bar is a must."}
{"text":"One of the few bars in town that still plays decent music. The $4 double long islands on Saturdays is the best deal around. Service varies. Bouncers often to take bribes from underagers to get let in and for people to skip the line which can make an already slow moving line unbearable. One of the few bars in the area that has a coat check, every bar around should take a page out of KK's book and start doing that as well. Some bartenders will get you your drink right away with friendly service and others will leave you hanging until you decide to just leave the bar, you never know the service you'll get."}
{"text":"Got ripped off and spent 2 hours on the phone with my credit card company! I tried paying part cash part card for my tab. They took my 70 I gave them for my part cash must have put it in the tip jar then charged me 83.00 and took it upon themselves to tack on an 18 dollar additional tip onto my receipt I already signed! Be careful if you go. I will not be back."}
{"text":"The new renovations look great, the floors aren't sticky....yet only downside is the bathroom spots got switched so there will be a learning curve involved, and no novelty condoms wtf???? Also L-Berkotitz was nowhere to be seen"}
{"text":"Would be a lot better if it wasn't a basement and management didn't require that their bouncers exhibit a level of douchiness unparalleled by even the frattiest, paddle wielding frat boy that frequents this place."}
{"text":"Not the nicest bar in Madison by a long shot, but the KK provides solid entertainment.   The good: Drinks are cheap, bathrooms and new layout are much nicer than in years past, a make shift \"dance floor\" usually makes its way near the back. The bar food is decent overall.  The questionable: If you are a jersey chaser of any sort, there are always plenty of athletes here....from benchwarmers to quarterbacks.  The bad: The floors are disgustingly sticky. The crowd can range from douchey and jerky to skanky and wasted. Lines can be stupid long and the occasional bouncer showcases an enormous power trip.  I've had plenty of evenings at the KK...some much better than others. Memories..."}
{"text":"Meh is right.  Fun if you want to go there and get wild with people looking to bring back the true meaning of dirty dancing.  The bar is pretty hard to get to and the drinks are alright.  It's impossible to move through that place when it's busy and I feel like everything is always dirty and wet.  The floors are disgusting and the women's bathroom always smells of sweat and vomit.  My friend one time vomited in the middle of the bathroom because of how nauseating the smell alone was.  I can't say I haven't had fun here, because truthfully if you're hammered and want to dance - it's a good time.  Just not my first choice."}
{"text":"Of all the places in Madison to go out, to eat at, to do anything at, why would you go here? (Especially when there is a line. Seriously.)"}
{"text":"Kollege Klub is a relatively large bar, but there isn't much to offer here aside from a group of college bros and a drunk, boisterous crowd. There's popular music being played consistently and the crowd is young, but other than that, it didn't do much for me."}
{"text":"Overall had a good experience with this establishment but the lines at the bar were a little long for a Friday afternoon... Other than that I was treated with good service and will probably come back soon. Too much ice in the drinks though."}
{"text":"From the moment I walked into the KK I knew it was fate - the faint smell of Spotted Cow lager lingered in the air and Marvin Gay played in the background I could feel the gentle suction of my Van's sneakers peeling off the the booze-soaked cement. Steak sauce, ketchup, and two varieties of mustard lined each table alongside a dispenser of perfectly creased napkins and the bartender Lexi greeted me with a soft but sincere smile. I ordered a fireball shot to wet my whistle and it was the best I've ever had. I ordered another. One more. Thrice I ordered fireball shots, without looking back. Another kind bartender - an elderly fellow- offered me some water (my people call it agua), and I felt the hydrogen and 2 oxygen selves traveling through my veins like life itself. I came into the Kollege Klub a young, naive nomad, and left reborn."}
{"text":"If someone has something negative to say about this bar, they definitely didn't frequent the University of Wisconsin, Madison. I came back to visit last weekend, and of course the majority of the weekend was spend at the KK.   The chicken fingers and fries are to die for, and you should definitely try the infamous pink drink!"}
{"text":"The other reviews are correct: it's dirty, there's lots of underage kids, and the service is terrible.  We went here on a Saturday afternoon during one of the basketball games for a couple drinks.  The service was terrible. There were 5-6 bartenders working and 4 of the girls were standing behind the counter talking while numerous patrons waited.   We got a pitcher of beer (finally) and grabbed a booth.  After a few minutes, we were hungry so we ordered food, but getting service was like pulling teeth again. When the food came out, it was greasy and disgusting; we didn't finish the french fries.  Overall, it was a terrible experience and I won't be back."}
{"text":"Unfortunately not too impressed with the friendliness of the staff here. They could do so much more to be welcoming and accommodating but they just done time and time again. There are many bars in the area that have a more welcoming atmosphere. Recommend going there instead."}
{"text":"You know, if you want to ~actually~ be of age and STILL get denied from a bar, then do I HAVE THE PLACE FOR YOU!!!!!!!!! Make sure to get the bouncer who's hair was cut by a computer (@steve), it's a riot no matter what (if you are a girl you can match with him on tinder but I wouldn't recommend it). It's your choice!!"}
