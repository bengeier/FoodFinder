{"text":"The chef here is very creative. All food here is fusion. They add western flavor to the traditional Asian food. It really worth a try. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Very good... BBQ pork fried rice.... dumplings delicious! Roughly $ 20 rice/ noodle bowl. Noodles are fantastic! Went back for second stop as I was staying at Tropicana.
Chicken pad thia..... with vegetarian egg rolls....a little greasy but delicious an satisfying. A slice of lemon would have added to dish.... more than 5 stars if I could!"}
{"text":"Decently good food, and super fast. Staff is very friendly, would highly recommend. Kung Pao Wings are a must-have!"}
{"text":"We loved it so much the first time we just had to go back. Had the Mongolian beef it was disgusting. It had so much fat I couldn't even eat it. My husband had the wonton. Let's say would never order that again. Thumbs down"}
{"text":"You know what this place is actually very good everything is put together very well the food seems fresh and the noodles in the wonton soup are sooooo good! The only thing I will slightly complain about is that I asked the chef to use light oil but my food was still extremely oily I had to pay it down e try time before eating with a napkin. But other than that I enjoyed every entree we got. We also got the mixed veggie, orange chicken and the king pao shrimp. They were all very good in flavor and the ingredients can tell were fresh. I would come here before I go to the food court for sure! Next time I want to try the pho and the pad Thai. I wish they had more vegan options with tofu though. The older gentleman that helped me at the cash register was so seeet and kind I loved him! He went out of his way to pour me some siracha to go I appreciated that a lot!!"}
{"text":"I am very impressed to say the least!  The vegetables are so fresh.  The sweet and sour chicken bowl was delicious and my Husband loved the Thai Curry Shrimp Bowl.  The Guest Experience Specialist of the Tropicana was AWESOME!  She is so professional and aims to please!

The decor was authentic and the atmosphere was sheik and upbeat.  We will definitely come back.  I wish nothing but luck and blessings to this establishment.  Thank you!!"}
{"text":"After attending a concert across the street, we escaped the chaos  and went to The Trop in search of some food. The sign said open till 11pm and we arrived at 11:20pm but they still took our order. Score!
I had the Pho, hubs had the Pad Thai with shrimp, baby girl was craving a burger but settled for Bao buns. Everything was delicious, fast in a lovely setting. You order at the counter, take a number and they bring you your food very shortly after. Will be back."}
{"text":"I have to say I was quite impressed with this spot. It's a little hidden next to Robert Irvine's. I stopped in to get a snack before heading to the airport. The veggie egg rolls were delicious. I think the veggie fried rice was, too, turns out I just am not a fan of fried rice. The portions were quite large (appreciated), and the staff was very friendly. Wish I had figured this place out earlier in my stay."}
{"text":"Just had shrimp pad Thai and it was not very good to say the least. The tofu they added to it was so soggy and saturated in oil, it was disgusting. The sauce was bland and was probably the worst pad Thai I've had, and I've had quite a lot. My husband had the red lotus fried rice with chicken and said it was okay. I tasted it and thought it was okay at best, but I certainly wasn't yearning for more. I wouldn't return or recommend to anyone else. And a rip off, even for being on the Strip."}
{"text":"We are locals and after having a really nice Chinese dinner twice at Wazuzu at the Wynn that was reasonably priced with great service, this was a disappointment.   We were asked if we were \"dining in\" and we said yes.  So it was disappointing when my $15 meal was served at the counter in a plastic container and my husband's was a wax paper lined flimsy cardboard box!  Really?   We couldn't even have plates?   His beef and broccoli was \"ok\" he said.  My honey walnut shrimp would've been much better if it wasn't so salty!   This was not what we expected, especially for the price.   They should just move their restaurant over to the food court.   Not worth the money, guys- sorry."}
{"text":"Not worth the money. $15 for entree plus $5 for rice. Ended up paying $32 for entree, rice and egg rolls. My dish, Kung pao chicken, was very soggy and flavorless. Next time go to Panda Express. It will be 1/3 the price for 3X the flavor. LOL"}
{"text":"Tonkotsu ramen was good
 but it tasted like chicken broth.. so don't expect authentic tonkotsu ramen. The meal size is normal but the slice of pork was generous. Was a very expensive fix and would probably try something else next time."}
{"text":"During my stay at the Tropicana hotel I decided to try this place out. They have a food court style of service but the decor and ambiance is 3 notches above the stereotypical asian food court type. The furniture and decor compliments the overall outlook. I order the Red Lotus chow mein and to my surprise it was pretty decent. Looking forward to try other dishes next time."}
{"text":"I got room service from Red Lotus while staying at Tropicana... the Ramen was good as were the Edamame... service was very quick as well... very good!"}
{"text":"We had dinner here two nights in a row. The food was quick, cheap and excellent. If we were staying longer we would have been back for more."}
{"text":"Tried the chicken pad Thai and bbq pork pad Thai. Both dishes were large portions but contained a seafood taste. The chicken didn't taste like chicken.  I had to throw it away. Service was quick and friendly. Also their menu has changed from the yelp menu."}
{"text":"So happy that I have eaten at this authentic place. There are so many pho restaurants in Las Vegas and I'm glad I got to try this place , the service is just amazing as their food. I am definitely taking my family and friends to try this restaurant. Thank you red lotus"}
{"text":"The food here was great! It is designed kind of like a food court, but the setting of the restaurant is also designed very nice!

I had the Thai curry beef bowl and I recommend that if you are a fan of Thai curry"}
{"text":"We tried Red Lotus on our last visit to the Tropicana. The food ranged from real good to hard to eat. We shared several appetizers and I though the portions were small for the price. The buns were pretty good but the Edamame (which had the largest portion) was so tough we couldn't eat it. I don't know that we I will ever get my spouse to try the place again. I would try one more time and order something different but with Robert Irvines and the South Beach food court having much better food I don't know that I will take the chance on wasting the money."}
{"text":"Really nothing special, nice decor, polite staff, but menu should be improved. What about combo - 1 entree with rise or noodles for people who want to try different things? Menu was not clear for me and I ordered 1 entree, which was a huge portion for 1 person"}
