{"text":"I have had lobster rolls before and loved them. We drove all the way to lakes Las Vegas just to eat here. The rolls were $17 which seemed high but I really like lobster rolls so I figured I would go for it. It was a big mistake. The lobster roll was a small hot dog bun stuffed with flavorless lobster. Save your money and find the Maine Lobster Lady food truck. Hers were twice the size on a real sandwich roll way better. Super bummed I had high hopes for this place."}
{"text":"This place will never last. GREAT idea, but so poorly executed. If you want a hot dog bun with some lobster on top, here ya go. They have no idea how to make an edible meal. If you can screw up anything with lobster, that's pretty sad. No flavor and expensive. Pass on this one."}
{"text":"This little lobster shack is located lakeside in the Monte Lago Village in Lake Las Vegas.   While the restaurant is a bit spartan inside, the real star is the multiple lobster dishes and friendly service.  We have an affinity for lobster rolls and these did not disappoint.  There was a nice generous portion of fresh succulent lobster on a fresh roll.  Included with the sandwich was a side of cole slaw and some kettle chips.  The hand cut fries made an excellent accompaniment.  The only reason why I gave it a 4 star rating is because I prefer my rolls buttered and toasted.  At least they saved me some calories.  For a casual, lake side lobster meal, I would highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Are here a few weeks ago. Cute little spots. TONS of lobster in each dish. Will be back again!"}
{"text":"I pay attention to detail, I ordered their famous Lobster Rolls. Oh boy, I highly recommend it! The bread was warm to the touch and the lobster is generous. Every bite was delicious until the very end.   The place is very clean, organized and very friendly environment. I'm definitely telling my friends & family about this location."}
{"text":"I can't say anything bad about this place! We had the chowder, lobster roll and lobster mac. It was very flavorful and hot hot hot! Will be back with my family for sure"}
{"text":"Went there today and was very pleased with my Lobster roll!  It beat the crap out of the Lobster roll I had in Vegas at the Crab Corner, where there was much more bread than lobster and it was only a dollar cheaper!  This lobster roll was very tasty and came with good cole slaw and a bag of chips.  The service was awesome!  It's a small place but cozy.  We were treated well and really enjoyed our rolls.  We also had the zucchini and artichoke dip ...I enjoyed that as well ..but next time will try the lobster dip :)"}
{"text":"We loved it small shop with friendly service. We had the lobster roll, shrimp roll, and lobster mac n cheese. All absolutely delicious. Complete with chunks of lobster. You certainly won't have to pick at your food to find em  Definitely worth the price!"}
{"text":"In town for my son's lacrosse tournament - I grew up on the east coast and love a good Maine lobster roll and so does my son.  We made a point of visiting Lobsterman's Restaurant to check it out.   The lobster chowder came in a very savory broth with lots of lobster and big chunks of potato, very tasty.  The coleslaw that came with the sandwich was not over-sauced, flavorful and the cabbage was crisp.  The lobster rolls were very good.  A generous serving of big chunks of lightly seasoned lobster meat on a toasted bun.  The bun is definitely the weak point of an overall very good experience - it could be more buttery, more toasted and of a lighter consistency, but it's just fine.    The woman who served us was extremely friendly and helpful.    We did see reviews suggesting that $17 for a lobster roll is too expensive.  I don't know where those people eat a good lobster roll...in Maine, Boston and even on the west coast, a solid lobster roll is $20+, so I feel this was very reasonable for what we received.  Yes, lobster rolls are a lot more expensive than your average sandwich, but this was well worth it.  We both will be back and hope that the Lobsterman's Restaurant is here when we return."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Should you ever find yourself nearby, please stop in. The lobster is so fresh and so delicious. The lobster roll was perfect and not too heavy. The lobster mac and cheese was perfect."}
{"text":"The lobster mac and cheese is the best I've ever had. Large chunks of lobster. The lobster roll is delicious. Five star service. Friendly. Will be back soon."}
{"text":"Delicious!!! I ordered a lobster roll as well as the lobster flat bread and cannot say enough good things about these yummy delights! The lobster was fresh & amazing!! And I am very particular about items mixed with mayo but they don't pre-mix their lobster meat for the lobster rolls so they were able to put it on the side. The flat bread had artichokes and light cheese and was just amazing. Plus they were very very generous with the lobster portions!!  Will absolutely be going back next visit!"}
{"text":"A proper lobster roll. Toasted bun, lots of lobster meat with a light coating of seasoned mayo. No other fillers etc. It was excellent and I'm not usually a fan of the traditional hot dog buns.  The menu was small but it had the key lobster dishes and as a bonus the coleslaw that came with the sandwich was crisp and very flavorful without being too sauced just like the sandwich.  Nice setting outside. I just wish they had other things I miss from home like steamers."}
{"text":"I just had the BEST Grilled cheese lobster  sandwich ever!  The lobster was prepared perfectly, juicy and buttery.  Prices are not reasonable, especially for lobster.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"We ended up at the lake to take in the 4th of July fireworks. In the absence of more enticing food vendors and with long lines elsewhere, we decided to try Lobsterman's. In fact, there was hardly anyone inside at the time. This soon changed and they later sold out of food. Good for them, bad for the hungry, but lucky for us.  We ordered the lobster roll and the lobster Caesar salad. The lady mentioned that they had moved here from Maine, so it seemed like the appropriate choices. I admit that I thought the prices were high--$17 for the lobster roll and $16 for the lobster Caesar. But I'm not well versed on the lobster economy. (A quick Google search reveals that the lobster roll price is competitive albeit completely marked up from what the fishermen receive).  In any case, we enjoyed our food. Both dishes came with large chunks of lobster meat. The salad was perfect for the warm weather. The roll filling was creamy and delicious with the surrounding bread being nice and soft. The whole thing kind of just melts into your mouth. I felt like I could totally go all Miki Sudo/Matt Stonie on it and stuff it into my face. But of course we were sharing and this is the kind of thing you need to savor. If I had one complaint it's the \"Dirty\" potato chips that came with the lobster roll. Those chips pretty much suck.  I'm a fan of this place. Solid food and friendly service with a smile. When the lady brought out our order, she was apologetic for the wait, but it was unnecessary. I could tell they were overwhelmed by the crowd but grateful for the business. A restaurant at Lake Las Vegas would be tough to keep afloat, pun totally intended. Hopefully now that there are two ways to reach the area (Galleria Drive), business picks up."}
{"text":"The lobster mac n cheese was awesome! Never been there before but love lobster and it did not disappoint. I will definitely be going back and telling my friends."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I love heading out to the village whenever we can. We decided to have lunch and stopped by. The service was amazing and we were greeted with a smile. I ate the lobster Mac and cheese and my fiancé had the regular Mac and cheese. The portions were a healthy size. We both enjoyed our food and will most likely come by again. The prices are a little high, but I expect that since lobster is not native to Vegas. It's worth a try if you love heading to Lake Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Name says it all as far as the menu goes - Lobstermans.   While they do have a few token other things, 95% is lobster based.  It is fresh, it is delicious, and they don't skimp on the portions.  While I have never been to Maine, it is exactly how I would picture a Maine lobster shack menu to be like.  Located right on the water in Lake Las Vegas, the atmosphere is gorgeous.   It is nothing fancy - more like a fast food type restaurant than anything, but the staff is very friendly, and the personal service was excellent.  Considering the main ingredient, prices are very reasonable.  Most items $10 to $20.  Lobster roll was $17, and so packed with lobster, I did not eat my bag of chips."}
