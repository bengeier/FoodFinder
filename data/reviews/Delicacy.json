{"text":"This restaurant is clean and pleasant. The chaat is excellent. As a vegetarian, I can't speak personally about the butter chicken, but my companion said that it was a 6 out of 10. The pani puri was good, especially if you like sour pani - every place seems to have sweet pani these days and I can't stand it! It's clear that what they're going for is authentic, fresh Indian cuisine but some of the spice ratios seemed a little off. I suspect that the issue is that they don't have a lot of experience cooking large quantities of food. I'll be back in a few months and I fully expect to see improvement as they get more comfortable with cooking on a larger scale."}
{"text":"Stopped for an inexpensive take-out butter chicken on the way home from work after the sign outside caught my eye with the $5.99 price tag. I suppose the rice to butter chicken ratio was a bit off, as is mentioned in an earlier review, but regardless, I think I got my money's worth, so I can't really complain. Aside from that, I was happy with the quality of the chicken as well as the flavour of the dish."}
{"text":"Butter chicken didn't taste like it should've. Regardless of price I feel they could've done better.  Guy behind counter seemed nice, but probably won't be back here again."}
{"text":"The food at Delicacy is really quite tasty. I've tried their veggie thali, samosas, naan, and pakoras so far and have been impressed with what I've got. In my thali, I had saag paneer and chana masala with rice, salad and papadam. The thali was to go. When I opened it, I was a bit disappointed to see such unequal proportions of rice to veg dishes (meaning I had tons of rice with no nearly the same amount of saag or chana) but the food was still very yummy. The samosas are very good and the pakoras are equally excellent.   The staff here is also incredibly friendly and warm. I will come again to Delicacy to try their rotis or try some other veg dishes. While it's not at the top of my Indian take out list, it is definitely cheap, tasty, and quick. Worth your time if you're hungry and nearby."}
{"text":"I was lured into Delicacy by their incredibly cheap lunch offering of Butter Chicken for $4.99. I set my bar to a medium height, as I am a butter chicken fiend. I only order butter chicken when I'm on my own because, well, I want it all to myself. Greedy, yes, but at least I'm honest. Back to the meal. A reasonable portion was served, reflective of the price, served in a bed of rice with a garden salad on the side. My first note was that the chicken had very little spice to it and a stronger tomato flavor than I've experienced with the BC. That's a nice way of saying it needs a lot of work.   I'm sure I'll be back here again, I'm hoping for some improvement to the dishes. The interior is clean but could use some more personal touches and the staff are friendly. If you're looking for some butter chicken to savour, try Mother India just down Queen St in the meantime."}
{"text":"Their goat curry is delicious! For $9.99, I got the goat curry,  basmati rice and salad. Quite economical considering that it is a full meal/  Meat was tender and flavourful. Curry had that rare quality of home-cooked taste. You can request your spice level, at the time of ordering and the chef/owner seasons it accordingly.  I am Indian myself, and we cook goat curry at home all the time. I'm happy to find a place which knows how to really make it , and is not resorting to short-cuts or using the same sauce base for everything.   Interior of the restaurant is simple cafeteria style decor and is very clean.   It appears their samosas are also very popular, judging from the numbers of orders they get.  They have a good selection of chaats, vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes. Will go back for sure!"}
