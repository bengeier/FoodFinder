{"text":"My review will be short and sweet.  I AGREE with everything everybody had to say about this wonderful little Italian store in Bloomfield.  I hate grocery shopping (especially big store grocery shopping like Giant Eagle) but love to shop in this lovely little store.  Prepared foods are fantastic and the lunchmeats are always fresh and delicious.  I always manage to find everything I need here.  I am Italian and grew up with grocery stores just like this.  I feel like I am home every time I enter."}
{"text":"The food is great. The employees are friendly, helpful and curteous. The place is spotless- always. You can get a great hot lunch. The menu selection varies from day to day. But it's always very good. And they make frozen dinners you can take home and cook. Everything about this place is much better than Donatellis. What's not to love?"}
{"text":"7/31 - Move to Bloomfield. 8/1 - Go to Groceria Italiana. 8/3 - Go to Groceria Italiana. 8/4 - Go to Groceria Italiana. 8/5 - Go to Groceria Italiana.  It's just that damn good. This place is what it would be like if your Italian grandmother opened a grocery store near you, so that you could still enjoy her homemade goodness while you're away.   Everything I've had from the hot foods table is phenomenal -- the oft-touted meatball sandwiches, the eggplant parm, the stuffed peppers (brought 'em home to my dad dahn in Washpa, and he said it was THE best stuffed pepper he'd ever had), the chicken cacciatore, the Italian sausage, the rotini with meat sauce, and the pepperoni rolls. OH, the pepperoni rolls! They're big, they're stuffed with quality pepperoni and cheese, they're crispy on the bottom, and have what I consider the determining factor in what makes a pepperoni roll awesome -- tons of burnt cheese crusted on the outside. (Side note: If you want a pepperoni roll and are in Bloomfield, come here; don't go to Pizza Italia.) But, it doesn't stop there.   It's easy to walk straight over to the hot foods and ignore the rest of the store, but don't. The freezers are packed with good food glory! Grab a bag of the frozen, homemade gnocchi and a quart of the marinara sauce (kept in the cooler with salads), and you've got an incredible meal in 5 minutes flat. The gnocchi are perfection -- dense, yet light, and the flavor screams, \"I'm homemade! Boxed, pre-packaged gnocchi ain't got nothin' on me!\" I'm going to buy 4 more bags of them today.   They also have frozen, homemade pierogies (haven't tried 'em yet), pastas, sausages, Italian ice, and -- drumroll, please -- tiramisu. There's a sign on the front door that says, \"We have the best tiramisu!\" and they are not lyin'. It's phenomenal. Because of that, it's also super dangerous stuff. Diet-ruining, can't-stop-eating kinda stuff.  They have a nice li'l selection of pantry stuff, too -- quality olive oils, vinegars, anchovies, olives, spices, mayo, etc., as well as a small refrigerated section with milk, and some local produce, like lettuce, cukes, tomatoes, etc. This is definitely a place you can pop into to try and avoid a Giant Eagle run!  Last, but not least, something good to know: I asked one of the guys working there if they had certain days of the week designated for certain dishes, and he said, \"No, the two ladies just come in early and see what's in the kitchen and make whatever they feel like making that day!\" I love that. Somebody's grandma really is making this food, and you can tell it's all made with lots and lots of love.   Groceria Italiana, I will be patronizing you for years to come!"}
{"text":"Not sure if they were having a bad day at the office or absolutely did not want to serve me. Got glared at the moment we walked in the market. Went to the back to order an Italian Hoagie. Was told \"We don't got no bread\" and that was it. Definitely saw bread in the store. If they don't want my business that's all fine and good. But they definitely deserve to be aired out for this considering there was clearly bread in the store. Walked down the block and ended up getting great service from Donatelli's."}
{"text":"Out of 5: 4.0 - spinich linguini 4.0 - garlic herb pasta linguini 2.5 - fettucini: Harder to ensure separation, unlike the linguini  2.0 - gnocchi 1.5 - Ham Capicolla 4.0 - tuscan bread: fresh and soft throughout.  on select days it isn't as good, but most of the time it is awesome."}
{"text":"The single best Italian grocery in Pittsburgh. Amazing made from scratch foods. They serve the single best meatball hoagie I've ever had. Perfect ravioli, pasta and tiramisu. Go here as often as you can."}
{"text":"Stopped in here recently for the first time and was excited to see a couple women there preparing fresh raviolis.  I bought a couple boxes of the raviolis, along with some fresh tomato sauce and one of their store made lasagnas to serve to some friends that night. Everyone was blown away by how fantastic it all tasted.  Will definitely be going back regularly."}
{"text":"Living near Groceria Italiana is like having my Italian family nearby.  Easy access to excellent food.  Homemade pasta, sauce, desserts, etc.  Their ready to eat food is delicious.  There is no reason a meatball sub should be a weekly part of my diet - but I can't help myself.    Everyone that works there is so helpful.  I've had a few parties catered by them - and they were overwhelmingly gracious.    I highly recommend stopping in this place to grab dinner - either for ready made food or their pasta and sauce.  You're about 10 minutes away from deliciousness."}
{"text":"Cute little hidden gem in the heart of Bloomfield. If you aren't paying attention, you will just about miss it as I almost did. They have the best fried dough I've ever had!"}
{"text":"It's a nice small and authentic market that's just one block off the main strip. I absolutely love this place! If you come at the right time, you'll be able to see the fresh ravioli being made right in front of you."}
{"text":"They have hot food section in the back! Their meatballs and sauce! Man, I usually don't like tomato sauce (hate ketchup too) but holy mima these were good even after I microwaved them. $1.55 for each make them little..steep for unassuming little meatball but I enjoyed them. Slight sweet-ish cheesy-ish with nice texture - I can't be a professional critique  Little on saltier side though.   I saw homemade pasta, tiramisu, and ravioli as well - all around $8 each bag/container."}
{"text":"I hit this spot everytime I visit Bloomfield for a haircut.  The homemade ravioli and Italian sub are my favorite!"}
{"text":"Groceria Italiana is a hidden gem off of Liberty Avenue in Bloomfield. They have a small deli with italian style meats and delicious cheese, they have salads and ready to eat hot food as well and they have tons of sauces, breads and pastas. Although I have not tried all of their goodies yet, I am pretty obsessed with their homemade ravioli. I have tried the imported cheese and the traditional cheese and both are delicious. Just follow the instructions on the outside of the box and you're set. They are totally affordable for the quality you are receiving. They also have homemade lasagna, homemade meatballs, homemade meatballs and desserts. YUM."}
{"text":"Yaaas little neighborhood Italian grocery store, you go!  I dropped in here at the recommendation of a friend who knows Bloomfield well, and suggested we go there to grab a takeout lunch.  Near as I can tell, they stock great Italian staples as well as any store in the Strip, and they also offer fresh pastas, meats, hot foods, and baked goods.  I got eggplant parmesan over pasta.  The former was mind-blowing, the latter was, unfortunately, pretty \"blah\".  I appreciated that they do take debit/credit cards, as that can be hit or miss with small independent stores."}
{"text":"I live down south now on a private beach, where it's warmer than PGH. and love it but reading these reviews sure did make me homesick!"}
{"text":"What can I say about Groceria Italiana that hasn't already been said?  PLEASE OPEN ANOTHER LOCATION! The south hills needs a place like this. If I didn't live so gosh darn far away, I'd be here multiple times a week.  I stopped back to Groceria Italiana after a food tour in Bloomfield a few weeks ago to pick up a few things for dinner. I decided to purchase the special- sausage ravioli because the owner had informed us that everything is made in house. Even the suasage is ground and tested in house before putting into the ravioli. I also left with marinara sauce and pepperoni bread.  The pepperoni bread was light, fluffy and delicious.  The ravioli is easily the best ravioli I have ever had. Each little pocket of heaven was hand made and was slightly different in shape and size from each other. The tall tale sign that they were pressed by hand. We followed the directions on the box and BAKED (not boiled) them in sauce. I've literally thought about those ravioli every time I have had italian food since. If you are anywhere near this place, stop in immediately!"}
{"text":"I have been eyeing up Groceria Italiana for months, but I had to wait for the right moment.  I knew it was going to be an amazing little store, and sometimes I start weeping when I am really happy... which is awkward in a little grocery store.  I finally got a box of the Gorgonzola artichoke ravioli.  They weren't cheap, but they were AMAZING.  I want to try all of the flavors.  The inside was rich and delicious, and the noodle was homemade perfection.  I really want to try the Tiramisu, but I'm turned off by the fact that it is frozen.  Fresh would be better.  The actual store has everything you could ever want: meats, cheese, prepared foods, and specialty Italian items.  There is also a public lot next door, which is convenient.  The employees are helpful as well.  Check it out ASAP."}
{"text":"Years ago I discovered this quaint grocer and their awesome lunch counter. The meatball hoagie and weeding soup are seriously are amazing and authentic. I have not had better wedding soup in the city. I'm also in love with the homemade raviolis, (read the directions, these are baked not boiled.) My favorite is the artichoke gorgonzola, they are often sold out. If you're lucky enough, you'll get a chance to see the raviolis being made in action by one of the lovely pasta making ladies. Make certain to use the homemade sauce as well, we're talking heavenly good. Also, if you get there early enough, grab a warm, fresh Tuscan bread, (but maybe I shouldn't be telling you this.) it's crispy on the outside, and warm and soft on the inside. I dream of this bread. The deli counter is as well fantastic, get some meats and cheeses and have a banging sandwich. Anything you try from here is sure to keep you coming back for more!"}
{"text":"I have driven near this countless times, and always said \"I want to check that place out\" but never actually did it.  That was until I did the Brewery, Bites and Bits (or Bits and Bites) tour.  Since last Saturday, I have been there 3 times now, and I am sure that I will keep going back more and more since we live so close in Polish Hill (which lacks such an amazing asset to the neighborhood).   They had me at their meatballs and sauce.  I am Italian, and I was that kid that took for granted that their grandparents would be around forever to give me the recipe to the family sauce and meatballs.  After losing my Grandma to cancer, and my Grandpa shortly after continuing to decline with Alzheimers, I sincerely regret not learning more about how they cooked, etc.  These meatballs and sauce were the closest thing that I have tasted.  SCRUMPTIOUS, and they bring up some many fond memories of my Grandpa in particular, even better.    After the tour, we decided to go back and get some grub to make for dinner, and explore a tad more. We got the Tiramisu, Eggplant Parm, some Sausage Ravioli, the Marinara (their house made), Pepperoni roll and the gnocchi.  My husband thinks the Tiramisu is the best he ever had, and I am not one who loves Tiramisu but I even think it is absolutely amazing.  The Pepperoni roll is amazing too... not as dense tasting as some others that I like, which makes me feel less guilty after eating it.  The Sausage Ravioli is awesome... not boiled, they recommend baking it with a light layer of sauce, the ravioli and then equal mixture of sauce and water covered with foil and baked.  I seriously do not think I have ever loved ravioli as much as I loved this!  The Eggplant Parm was awesome too.     We ended up back there 6 days after that, for meatballs and sauce... AMAZING again.  Complete consistency.  We got another tiramisu (which by Sat was gone again with me just having one bite).  We were there again the next day... I am starting to notice a trend :)   The owner is the sweetest and spunkiest lady I have met in awhile and everyone who works there is truly wonderful... if I could buy all of my groceries here, I would.  I cannot recommend this place enough.  A+++++++++++++++++++++++, keep up the fabulous work.  We will be back... probably in a few days :)"}
{"text":"I visited after work last Fri. to pick up dinner.  I considered getting the raviolis, but decided against it because (1) I already had some frozen raviolis in the freezer (though I'm sure theirs are much better); (2) They're not cheap, at $7ish per box; (3) I wanted a hot take-out dinner.  Since I'd heard good things about the pepperoni rolls but had never tried a pepperoni roll, I asked the guy working behind the counter if they had any.  He confirmed that they did, so I bought one of them plus a tiramisu, which came to about $12.  Upon arriving home, I decided to heat up the pepperoni roll in the toaster oven.  It was excellent, with light and fluffy but substantial bread, plenty of pepperoni slices, and a layer of mozzarella cheese.  While I liked the flavor, it occurred to me that some marinara sauce would make it even more flavorful, so I heated up some in the microwave and proceeded to dip the roll in the sauce as I ate it.  (As a newbie to pepperoni rolls, I don't know if this is a common practice.)  Ideally, I should have asked if they had any marinara sauce for dipping, since a higher-quality marinara sauce would have been even better.  Oh, well--I'll do that next time.  The tiramisu was even better than the pepperoni roll.  I've had tiramisu a couple of times, but I don't seek it out since I'm not a huge fan of coffee-flavored desserts.  This tiramisu is addictive, however, and the espresso-soaked ladyfingers had me wanting more every time I ate a piece.  Even if you're not a big tiramisu fan, I'd suggest trying their version--it's tiramisu the way tiramisu should taste.  Perhaps the most notable thing about this store is that the majority of products appear to be homemade (i.e., non-commercial).  Aside from the items I've already mentioned, they have an assortment of cheeses, pasta, and pizzelles.  I look forward to visiting again and partaking of some more Italian goodness soon!  EDIT: I tried the sun dried tomato basil ravioli, and they were absolutely delicious. Just make sure to bake them according to the directions--the reviewer who said they fell apart on him obviously tried to boil them.  Looking forward to trying more delicious flavors of raviolis soon!"}
{"text":"I love the homemade mac-n-cheese on Fridays. I stop in every week for it. Last week, I got a large and went back for more. But, lately it's been hit or miss. Today is the 27th of May and I ordered the mac-n-cheese and it tastes like a completely different recipe. It is all watered down and gross. This happened another time about a month ago. I honestly don't know how it could taste so different from one week to the next, but it absolutely does. I don't know if someone else is making it on the weeks that it tastes this bad, but we threw it in the garbage can today. When you are a regular customer, you expect the food to taste the same all the time and they need to fix this problem."}
{"text":"I first visited Groceria Italiana as part of a Bits and Bites tour.  We had returned from Rome only three days before, so I was skeptical of most things American that claimed to be Italian.  I was pleasantly surprised by the store!  As part of the tour, I was able to sample meatballs and pasta.  They were very tasty and left you wanting more.    We bought several types of ravioli, two types of their home made pasta, some meatballs, fresh bread and a few other items.   I can't wait to make some amazing Italian meals at home with their products.    I wish we were closer to Bloomfield.  We'd be back much more often than we likley will be.  That being said, I found the store awesome enough that I'd take a trip to the area just to return to the store."}
{"text":"If you visit this store good luck finding them open they close when they feel like it stopped on sat 230pm there were workers in the store the door was locked they would not answer just motioned to me they were closed all I wanted was manicotti  ruined good dinner plans."}
{"text":"One of the best Italian grocery stores in Pittsburgh!! When I walk into this store I am hit with the scents of Italian food and it reminds me of the best of my childhood when I would make homemade meatballs with my Italian mother."}
{"text":"I bought an Italian sandwich from the deli, tiramisu, and fresh fettuccine to cook later in the evening. The deli worker was very helpful, and made me a delicious sandwich, packed with meat and cheese for around $6. The tiramisu (~3) was phenomenal and so fresh. I made a fresh clam sauce for the fettuccine and the homemade pasta really made a difference.  I will note is that the packaging for the pasta said to cook it for 20 minutes. All you really need is 5-7. I double checked with them before I left that the timing on the package was wrong, and they agreed."}
{"text":"I consider myself a lucky girl to live in Pittsburgh's own Little Italy (although it has taken it's toll on my waist line, truth be told). Two separate and delicious family owned Italian grocery stores and countless amazing restaurants.  Groceria Italiana is one of those quintessential corner stores that make you think of the way things may have been when your parents were young.  If you're one of those on the go-doing a million things at once types who rarely find the time to cook a meal, look no further than the hot food options they offer. It's that perfect delicious comfort food that these up coming autumn days.  Skip out of work early and make a pit stop here on your way home, you'll thank me later."}
{"text":"We first ate here on the Burgh Bits and Bites Tour in 2012. I've driven 30+ minutes several times a year since to purchase their homemade ravioli (literally hand-rolled, stuffed, and cut with a family recipe), marinara sauce, and bread. Out of town family requests I bring this home for special holidays and birthday meals. Caution, they sell out near Christmas, so stock up early."}
{"text":"Delicioso!  I shopped here today for the second or third time. I had previously tried some of their desserts which were very tasty! Today, I tried a small sampling of their pasta and meatballs and purchased an amazing loaf of bread and Turner's milk (which is by far the best milk I've ever tasted). The employees are very nice, and the owner seems like a real gem. If more small businesses were like Groceria Italiana, we wouldn't have chain stores!"}
{"text":"I had such high hopes. And though they clearly pride themselves in their pasta and ravioli, mine fell apart like crazy. It was a mess. An expensive mess. Artichoke and Gorgonzola everywhere. Not only the seams fell apart. The pasta broke all over. I may go back for tiramisu in time, but I'll definitely hesitate before spending 9 bucks on a dozen pieces of watery mess again."}
{"text":"Groceria Italiana is seriously our favorite place to go for any of our Italian food needs. The staff has always been incredibly nice to us, and they'll remember you after only one or two trips. Great people! You can tell it's a family-run business!  Of course, even if the service was awful, I would probably be able to overlook it for the food! The pastas that we've tried are all really good. The ravioli is excellent! We like their lasagnas, but haven't quite perfected how to cook them in the little pan. They just never crisp up for us, but it doesn't really matter. The flavor is still a winner. Be warned, though...the lasagnas are VERY cheesy (which I love), but that might not be everyone's thing. My go-to would be the eggplant lasagna or cheese ravioli if I was in a heavy pasta mood. If you get their plain pastas, you won't be disappointed, either. There's just something about fresh pasta that can't be beat!  Their pepperoni rolls, if you're there early enough to get one, are my another favorite. They practically taste like pepperoni croissants...and who wouldn't want that?   Not to be overlooked by my sweet-tooth having self are the desserts. The almond cream cake and the tiramisu are two of my favorite desserts around. Just let them sit out to thaw for 20 minutes, and then allow yourself to be overwhelmed by the deliciousness! The tiramisu just blows my mind. We usually buy two when we go...and they don't last more than a day!  If you're not in the mood to do your own cooking, you can always hit up their prepared foods section, too (where you'll find the pepperoni rolls). The meatballs are soooooo good, but don't forget to grab a batch of their marinara!  Places like this are too wonderful to overlook. I'm just bummed that it took me 7 years of living in Pittsburgh to find out about Groceria Italiana!"}
{"text":"Love this quaint little Italian grocery in the heart of Bloomfield. I try to go at least once a week to pick up homemade pasta, tremendous anti-pasta, Italian meats and cheeses, fresh cannoli or just enjoy the wonderful smell when you walk in."}
{"text":"Awesome little grocery store in Bloomfield. Inside is pretty small, but it's well-stocked with Italian goodies and so many things here are homemade. And what's even better is that nearly everything is reasonably priced: tiramisu is $7.50 (3\"x8\"), frozen ravioli is $7.75 for a dozen (there are a ton of different fillings you can choose from), frozen perogies are $4, and frozen meatballs are $5.50. And of course I had to try their pepperoni roll ($4). The roll was easily the size of two of my fists. There's a bit of an air pocket on the inside (see photo), but the taste is spot on and will easily fill you up."}
{"text":"What Groceria Italiana does best is prepare Italian dishes such as lasagna, ravioli, and pasta for customers to reheat at home. I bought some meat, cheese & spinach ravilois to heat up at home. Your instructed to bake them for 45 minutes at 350 deg F on a layer of pasta sauce; if you follow these instructions, then they will come out great.  I also picked up a bag of 12 perogies for $4 which are the best I have found at that price in Pittsburgh.  My favorite part is the deli counter where you can pick up both American and Italian specialty deli meats such as capicolla, prosciutto, and sopressata. The sopressata is housemade and fantastic.  The staff is very friendly and helpful. Don't hesitate to ask questions if you're unsure about something as they'll most likely be able to point in the right direction.  I'll likely upgrade GI to four and a half stars when I am permitted to do so."}
{"text":"Are you kidding me? Is a South Hills guy like me gonna be the first to review this joint????  We've been getting ready-to-eat takeout meals from this neat little market for years. It's very old fashioned, and everything is homemade from scratch. You basically take the food home, reheat it if necessary, and you're set.  Tonight we had the most sublime stuffed egglant ever. So light, so fluffy, so rich...  Also.  THE BEST.  RAVIOLI.  IN THE MULTIVERSE!   Thick little packets of stick-to-yer-ribs goodness they are.  They excel at Italian bread as well. It's doughy, somewhat delicate, and coated in flour. If you only ate this bread, without butter, you'd be content. It's even good enough to eat without spaghetti sauce to soak up. Speaking of which, their sauce should be considered a controlled substance. It's addictive.   I've also had their little meatball sandwiches from time to time.   The meatballs are pink inside.   Unh.   Mozzarella and red sauce coats it.  Oooh.   Ok, ok this is a family show.   Anyway, next time you want to grab something after work to eat at home, do me a favor; stop by here instead of Wendy's or Subway. Ok?   Home made ethnic takeout always burns fast food.   Man, just when I thought I was getting tired of Italian cuisine, Groceria Italiana makes me fall head o'er feet for it again.   And I'm as Italian as the Pope is Buddhist."}
{"text":"Best Tiramisu ever! But a sub-standard attitude? I was flying to Florida to visit my sister and wanted to gift her the tiramisu. Reached the shop 15 minutes before closing time and was treated to rude customer service. I was told that the store generally closes earlier than the closing time as there is a lot of cleaning. Well I do sympathize with that, but I dont see that as a reason to deprive a fan of some divine Tiramisu!"}
{"text":"I love this place! So far I've been there twice for pepperoni rolls, once for pizza crust and pizza sauce, and another time to grab some frozen ravioli. Everything has been super tasty, especially the pepperoni rolls that everyone have been raving about. We got the prosciutto ravioli to cook at home and it was tasty! I would also recommend buying pizza crust here because it's super cheap and much better than any store bought crust. Some of the prices are high (I think it was $8 for ravioli), but you do get a good amount and everything is legit so I think it's worth it! They also have a meat/cheese counter and a small menu of hot prepared foods ready to go!"}
{"text":"I'm so lucky to live in Little Italy. I absolutely love this neighborhood and the culture and food. Authentic markets like this one make my world so much better; it's a reminder of years spent in my Nana's kitchen. The smells, the tastes, everything. Their homemade ravioli and tortellini are among the best I've ever had and the homemade red sauces are comparable to my Nana's. The staff make you feel like family on each visit. Everything is always fresh and just all around perfect."}
{"text":"Always stop here for some excellent authentic Italian eats!  Love the pasta and they will slice some excellent soppressata thin for you too. Love this little store!"}
