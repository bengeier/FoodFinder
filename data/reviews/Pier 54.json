{"text":"I came here for Valentine's day and was seriously disappointed. Walking into the place, there was no host to greet or seat us. We had reservations and ended up walking around the empty tables looking for the one with our name on it. We finally chose a table and the food was pretty good, but my date asked for a steak knife to cut her lamb with, and our server said the place had no steak knives. Also our wine was served in tumbler glasses"}
{"text":"Loved eating at Pier 54!!! Wonderful service, food was delicious and beer was cold and awesome! Really enjoyed sitting and watching the water. We will eat here again soon!"}
{"text":"Love the new menu! With all the new options I have a hard time deciding what to order. Everything I have tried has exceeded my expectations! Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Love this place, its outdoors, everyone is extra friendly, service is a little slow but food is excellent."}
{"text":"Location, check.
Views, check.
Service, check.
Food...it can easily be improved. I felt like I was being served food that came from the frozen food aisle and microwaved. I understand it's supposed to be a casual neighborhood spot to mingle with your friends and enjoy the views but again the food needs improvement. Check it out for the unique views and have a beer or two."}
{"text":"Awful. Walk in confused. We seat ourselves. Sit awkwardly. Wait twenty minutes. Get up. Get the waitress to take our drink order. Wait. The owner asked if we needed anything and we said we need someone to take our order and she said she doesn't handle money and allowed us to wait. Then we complained and she lied and said she came over multiple times. Couldn't get out soon enough."}
{"text":"This place is great. The live music and atmosphere is great. Do not overestimate the food thoug. It's so-so. I still love this place and do not get here enough.

Being so close to the water makes you feel like you are not even in Arizona. This small bar is very romantic and also like  a dive bar at the same time.

Love it!"}
{"text":"Peer Off The Pier My Dear
By The Rue

Satruday night stopped at Pier Fifty Four, 
This is a place I'd never been before, 
The second I pulled up I knew I had scored,
Live acoustic music didn't bore,
I'm going to come by here a lot more,
Really was hoping to check out some slores,
I guess this night it just wasn't in store,
I wonder if it's because I'm poor,
My friends wife calls me a male whore,
Even though all the stories are just folk lore,
After hiking Usery Mountain my legs were sore,
This place sits on the lake shore,
I like to mine for gold not ore,
I cut some serious rug on the dance floor,
Not as good looking as the God Thor,
My kiss will rock you to your core,
I'll steal your underwear from your drawer,
After the 3rd orgasm you'll yell \"FORE\"!

Back Door!!"}
{"text":"1st off.. love coming here on non-holidays when the full menu is served. The food can be great and the environment is awesome! You would think that you would staff up vs penalize your customers for wanting to come spend the holiday at your place. Not everyone is a fan of pork and 20 versions of eggs Benedict. Big fail, we almost left but she served me my beer before we could cancel the order.

A little shocked to seeing family and children being sat in the smoking section while the nonsmoking section goes vacant. 

Our free entertainment was the 2 man group and the elderly man with his fingers in his ears. We would have bought him a beer or joined him if he didn't leave. 

This is one of my favorite places to come and I am super disappointed with the Easter disaster. Food was bland and came out under cooked twice. Two stars for today.. waiting for another mind blowing experience so I can update my review."}
{"text":"Terrible experience.  Went with my daughters for breakfast, after 1.5 hours of waiting one of my daughters had to go to work, ordered her eggs to go, it took them more than half an hour for the waitress to come out of the kitchen with her to go eggs, she had to followed my girl to the parking lot, my daughter arrived late to work and of course hungry.  My order wasn't good at all, chicken w/coliflower pure or i don't know what that was.  Music very loud, couldn't enjoy the songs; we were all sweating by the time we had our meals served.  At the end i received a strawberry covered in chocolate as a courtesy.  When i bit it it was the most horrible taste as it was a lemon covered in chocolate, imagine that.  This is the worst place i have been going and of course non of us will come back."}
{"text":"Pier 54 is a great place and environment. Service is very personal and friendly.  When I went in Matt was behind the bar.  He worked multiple tables at a time, with the bar, and I never had to ask to order anything he always asked me.  He really hustled to make sure everyone was taken care of. This is an awesome spot to sit outside and enjoy the nice weather!"}
{"text":"Go here only for the \"ambiance\" of being on a muddy lake.  The food was overpriced for the shack of a place it is and was not too good - we had fish tacos and fish and chips.  My warning should have been 0 customers on Sunday at noon.

The kids menu is very limited with 4 items.

If you go, bring a jacket and have drinks and greasy, but good, onion rings.."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places when the weather is nice. Good food and service had always been friendly. The view is beautiful, not many waterfront places in AZ. Menu has changed but we have a party here every year of 8-12 people and everyone's able to find something. Good selection of beer and such. It's is an outdoor eatery, food may cool off fast.. sometimes they have live music so maybe hard to carry on a conversation, but it's a fun fun place with the right people!"}
{"text":"Another restaurant recommended this restaurant to us as there had been a miss communication with our reservation. The manager of the restaurant that we were suppose to go to sent us ahead and said she would be right over to take care of the bill. Once we were seated, we informed our waiter as to what was happening. The owner of Pier 54 came over and immediately started getting angry at us. When the manager of the other restaurant showed up, she showed the owner that she was giving us cash and we could order whatever we wanted. Instead the owner of Pier 54 said she didn't want anyone's cash. At that point we did not feel comfortable staying there and the original restaurant, The Watershed, invited us to come back over and have lunch on them plus a free cruise of the lake. We will never give our time or hard earned money to Pier 54. Don't waste your time, go to The Watershed instead."}
{"text":"We had a fantastic meal at Pier 54 tonight.  I had the Octoberfest special which was a Brat on a pretzel roll with sauerkraut.  It was perfectly grilled and was a blitzkrieg full of flavor.  The only thing better was our Fr√§ulein Cait, who knock it out of the stadium with her service, and her smile.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place! It's a cute, quaint little place on the lake in Tempe. There food is great and service is laid back and polite. I love having cocktails here while listening to the music performers and looking at the beautiful sunsets on the lake!"}
{"text":"Been to this place 3 or 4 times and I will absolutely keep coming back! The staff is really welcoming and customers are always friendly. My roommates and I enjoy coming here for happy hour, soaking up the sun, and ordering the 5 dollar pitchers of bud light. Overall,  this is a great laid back place to go to with your friends!"}
{"text":"I'm giving the two stars just for the restaurant vibes and views. 
We came on Friday night at 10:15 pm we were greeted and a guy told us that it's self seated and he brought us the food menu as well the drinks menu and he was nice and welcoming. A 20 - 25 minutes later after failure tries to call any one to take our orders a guy named Miles came to us with such an ignorant attitude and said hey guys the kitchen is closed! No food just drinks!! We waited this long with the food menus and he saw us but didn't approach to us until around 10:40 pm. We told him that we came for dinner not drinks and that we were here at for 25 minutes and they gave us the food menus and he rudely said kitchen closed just drinks and took the food menus away!! That's really rude and ignorant and a horrible service from him! With no apologies and no attempt to solve the issue he just gave us the \"unwelcome\" treatment and we left because we were really disappointed and he said ok then bye! OMG if I was the owner I would be ashamed of him.. even the guy who greeted us was upset watching us being treated like that, he waisted out time for half an hour or so, he definitely ruined our night, and still he didn't apologized about his mistake! Why would they greet us and give us the menus unless they were welling to serve us diner, but obviously this Miles didn't like us and didn't want to serve us. He didn't even try to see if they can make us those burgers and didn't offer a snack or bar food. We talked to the bartender and he gave us the owners number and he apologized as he was nice and polite but omg this Miles was really the worst server I ever met! I would never ever go back again just because of him and I really wanted to give this place a try as I live 3 minutes away. Good job making customers run away Miles (y)"}
{"text":"I'm just confused. I sent back a bad overcooked burger and clearly the cook got pissed off at me. No fries on the reorder. And another completely overcooked burger. And he spiced it up the second time just to mess with me? I live in the Lakes. Seems pretty dumb to mess with a customer. Never going here again."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for the first time this afternoon and we are leaving quite happy! I had the chicken tenders with fries.  The chicken was tender and plentiful and the fries were spiced just right.  My husband got the chilled smoked salmon wrap and loved it.  And the lake view was amazing. We will most certainly be back,  sooner than later!"}
{"text":"This was a wonderful surprise to find an almost Island like sitting in the middle of Tempe Arizona. We sat on the patio close to the water and the food was wonderful waiters delightful. I would return again"}
{"text":"The good at Pier 54 has improved so much in the last 6 months!  Their menu is full of interesting things, and it is all well prepared using great ingredients.  In years past, we would come for the view & ambiance (lakeside!), and suffer through the food.  But now the food is wonderful!  And the tradition of great 1- & 2-man live entertainment lives on - great fun!
We had a happy hour with 25-30 people in the 'downstairs' area by the dock.  Despite the large group, the staff kept all of us happy with drinks & food."}
{"text":"My mom was in town, and wanted to see where a relative got married a few months back, so I showed her The Waterfront. Next door, she noticed a restaurant, Pier 54. She mentioned she'd like to try that out for lunch before she left. So we did.

Service: Bad. We arrived around 11:40, 40 minutes after they opened. We walked onto the patio/deck, and didn't see a server at all, so we just sat ourselves. After a good 15 minutes, a waiter walked out and took our drink order. Another 10 minutes, drinks arrived, and we decided to place our order then. We didn't receive our food for another 20 minutes or so. We didn't mind TOO much, since it was a nice day and we had a nice view of the man-made lake.

Food: I ordered the Fish & Chips and both were pretty good. Sadly, the fries were probably the best item we tasted. My Fiance had the regular burger & fries, and her burger was over-cooked and very dry and lacked flavor. My fish, was battered to perfection, although, the middle of the fish (most dense area), was cooked, but the consistency was different from the fish on the outer edges. Kinda mushy and not as appetizing. I enjoyed the ends and outer edges of the fillet of fish the most. My mom had the 1/2 sandwich & soup- roast beef panini & clam chowder. I took a bite of the panini, nothing special. Not gross, but not GREAT. its just ok. The clam chowder had a great flavor, but was awfully runny and thin and not as thick as most chowders. There wasn't many items: potatoes, clams, etc in there either. I was mostly a thin chowder broth.

In the end, I don't think we'll be back. Great location and nice atmosphere (minus the annoying bird that kept squawking all day long), but it was nice to enjoy the weather, the view and the ducks in the lake). I dont know why the service was soo slow, on a sunday, with only 3-4 tables. (more arrived as we left, but we were still shocked by the slow speed of the waiter). He was friendly, so I give him that, but we were really looking forward to this place, and it let us down quite a bit.

If you dont' mind slow service and can use a very laid-back atmosphere, then you'd like it. The food was passable, but nothing to drool over."}
{"text":"I ate at Pier 54 again on 3/24/17. It was a terrible experience:

- Very bad service, waited 45 minutes for sandwiches.
- Food quality was disgusting. My wife received a dry, tasteless Reuben, and my MIL received a dry, tasteless grilled cheese sandwich.
- Fries were not brought out until after the main entrees came out. Fries were greasy and disgusting. 
- Wait staff was apathetic, slow, and unpleasant. Our server did the best she could with the support she received. Terrible, terrible wait staff/management.

I paid $48 for the worst meal I've ever had. Very bad service and management. 

If I'm paying a premium to eat on the water I want excellent service and good-quality food, not cheap buns and frozen fries from Costco. 

There was even a disgruntled customer who left her meal at the bar, and who told the entire crowd how lousy her meal was.

Pier 54, time to get a makeover or move on. 

I'm moving on. I live in the Lakes and will never, ever return. Terrible, terrible experience."}
{"text":"Slow, but very friendly service.  Food came before utensils, napkins, syrup, and ketchup.  Had to go to the bar to get a drink because I couldn't catch the waiter's attention. Decent Bloody Mary (would've been better w celery) southwest eggs Benedict, French toast, and southwest sandwich. I'm giving 3 stars for the friendly (but slow) service, relaxed and fun ambience, and the nice view.  Would've been 4 if they had been more attentive to our table, including clearing the dirty dishes in a timely manner.  Dirty dishes that sit attract flies!  This place has full shade on all outdoor tables on the regular patio, but it looked like there was minimal shade on the dog-friendly patio area.   Cute place. With minimal tweaking of what they already have going on, there is lots of potential here."}
{"text":"We had lunch there today. If you are looking for an easy going place w/a gorgeous view, you just found it! I was a little disappointed the menu wasn't as extensive as online, but maybe that's because we were having lunch early on a Sat. Either way, there was plenty to choose from. Hubs had a sandwich that was generous in portion and accompanied by tons of fries. I had the feta/spinach omelet, which was really good. It came w/hash browns. Our waiter was attentive. Super-reasonable prices since we both had alcoholic beverages and before tip, were barely at $30!!!"}
{"text":"Waterfront dining in the East Valley that doesn't cost you an arm and a leg....who would have thought?

Now the food is average bar style foods, wings, burgers, popcorn chicken...not fine dining by any means, but plentiful and comforting. They do have some seafood dishes...but after our first experience I tend to avoid the seafood. I had ordered the artichoke & crab dip and salmon salad, which I happily ate, and my husband shared, and we both had significant GI distress that night. However, I think this must be the rare event, and to be fair, we tend to have delicate GI systems. 

The service tends to be inconsistent, more often slow than not, but always friendly and polite. The bar area seems comfortable and reminds me of Cheers...there are always a few people sitting there enjoying their beers and watching the TVs. I keep expecting to see Norm and Cliff sitting there.

But it's all about the view and atmosphere at this place. It's cozy, even though it's outdoors, with a very pretty and relaxing water view as the occasional boat is trolling around, and stylish homes line the shores. Living in the neighborhood makes it very easy to visit this place. I don't think I would ever drive here for the food, but if I were desperately missing a lake or oceanview, this might be a reasonable substitute.

Oh yeah, apparently although they used to allow dogs on the patio, they're no longer allowed to. We end up tying our pooch near the door so that she gets to meet and greet people as they walk through."}
{"text":"A good place with a perfect environment to hang out. Prices are fair. The only negative point is that its not fancy at all."}
{"text":"This outdoor bar/restaurant is a smoker lovers paradise. Which we are not. Almost everyone at the bar and the few dining tables they have were puffing up a storm. The place has a nice view of the small man made lake and that is appealing but the smoke! It's everywhere. Beer selection on tap is very limited to about six choices. On a hot day here, its hot. No misters operating but a huge movable swamp cooler was doing some good. We didn't stay long enough to eat. Suggest you read the reviews and like someone else on here has said it appears the five star reviews are from people with 2-3 total reviews. You decide."}
{"text":"We took our 4 children for Sunday brunch ages 12, 10, 5 and 6. 6 people ate till everyone was full for under $45. We sat by the water. The kids loved watching the boats and ducks. Kids menu is an awesome value, with breakfast almost as big as an adult portion. Service was very good, and everyone was very friendly. The hashbrowns are THE BEST I have had at a resturaunt. The potatoes are thin and very well seasoned. The kids loved the pancakes with a scoop of icecream!! I loved the the veggies used were not canned or frozen in the omlets. The children left saying..,, \" We should come here for breakfast everyday!!\"  A great family friendly place for breakfast!! Thanks to the staff working, we will be back soon."}
{"text":"Are you like me, in that you like dining outside when the weather allows? Do you enjoy seeing a serene body of water in the middle of a desert? How about good food, great service, and maybe even some nice live music in the background? What about having a beverage  at a very relaxed  and casual patio bar? If so, then you will really like the experience that awaits you at Pier 54!
Now, I have a small disclosure here. When I say dining outside, I literally mean outside, as there is no \"inside\" here. No kidding! This is a completely outdoor venue. BUT, there is plenty of cover overhead to provide shelter from the sun, (or occasional light shower, which seldom occurs in the Phoenix valley). In summer, there are misters and fans to help provide a measure of comfort, and in the winter there are patio heaters to take off the chill. 
The menu offers a nice variety of delicious offerings, and there are also food specials and happy hour specials as well. One unique special I've never seen anywhere else is free wine. Yes, seriously, free wine. If you are a couple that is dining after 6pm and you spend $30 in food, you get a free bottle of house wine. And it's not like the food prices are expensive, so we have actually had to add an additional side or an appetizer in order to make the $30 threshold, but it definitely works!
The live music I mentioned - that is on Thursday through Saturday evenings, and it usually consists of a solo or duet performance, with an occasional traditional 3-piece group mixed into the schedule. It's free, by the way - no cover charge.
Finally, I have to address the fact that this really is a venue by the water, as it sits on the shore of a private lake with impressive private residences lining the opposing shores. You will likely see an occasional watercraft (quiet, trolling motors only) cruising by as you dine - extra bonus! 
For those of you who have \"kids\" with 4 legs, this is also a dog friendly venue, with a lower deck of tables right by the water where you can dine with your furry friends!
So yes, this has become one of my favorite venues to frequent. Check it out - you may thank me later!"}
{"text":"Love going here for the atmosphere and location. The food is pretty good too. I had chicken skewers. They have a nice variety of food items on the menu. Live music on Fridays and Saturdays. Right on the lake and you can watch the sun go down. There is no indoor seating so you have to be mindful of the weather. But in Tempe...the weather is usually pretty nice!"}
{"text":"Had a great experience at the Pier!! Great place to enjoy great food, drinks, and a relaxing environment. My server was Matt, he went above and beyond to ensure we had a great experience and we had what we needed. This place will definitely be in the rotation... Thx, Matt!!"}
{"text":"We went here for our 6 month anniversary and I have to say it could be a 3 star maybe higher depending on where you sit and who you get as a server. We sat downstairs to be close to the water and some of the tables and chairs had pigeon poop or similar on them (very appetizing). I got the lamb and my wife got the salmon. Here are some of the reasons they get a 2 star: 

1) My wife and I don't drink soda, but the water was so nasty we had to order an apple juice and a diet soda just to have a drink. My wife's apple juice had floaty things in it and it made her really sick afterwords. 
2) One of the waitresses accidentally set chips and salsa on our table (we thought it was something they give all their customers) and then our waitress saw her do it and came and grabbed the chips off our table and handed it to the table next to ours who ordered it.   
3) A Lot of the customers seem like locals who go there all the time. We got treated as if we weren't customers and more like an inconvenience (not part of the \"in\" crowd). Our waitress visited our table only a few times very briefly and took forever in between trips. We waited over 15 minutes just to get the check. 
4) The water where we were sitting had a bunch of filth and was turning my stomach. We ended up moving tables and that wasn't much better. The table was dirty and my wife got her brand new shirt dirty...there was an exposed socket right next to us and a bunch of local kids running around our table. (hindsight we should have sat up stairs - might have made it a 3 star). 
5) The lamb had a bunch of fat on it. 
6) The food was inconsistent, my wife had fries with her meal and she said they were the best fries she ever had so we ordered another side. The 2nd batch were gross and not even close to the first batch. 

Although the ambiance wasn't there, here are the reasons they didn't get a 1 star: 
1) My wife's salmon was good
2) The lamb was good (minus the fat) 
3) french fries if you get a good batch are delicious! 
4) cool that is by water in AZ and that you can ride a boat to the restaurant"}
{"text":"After reading some of the reviews my husband and I decided to have brunch here on a sunday. We thought wed try since most of the reviews were good. Well... we thought wrong. Please just dont go there and I really dont know how people are giving this place a good review...THIS PLACE SUCKS!  We got there and thought it was a nice chill place with outside tables and a nice view of the man made lake. We also though how lucky we got since we beat the morning rush. Then we noticed it'd been awhile since we've been standing there and still no one has asked us if we wanted a table. I stared at the asian guy at the bar and since he didnt say anything, I decided to knock on that little door assuming the kitchen then finally the asian guy says you can sit wherever you want.  Then came a little lady from downstairs to asked us for our drinks I swear 10 min later i mean she dissappeared then here comes the water and orange juice. The oj was nasty tasted like concentrated made for mixed drinks, t'was flat.   While this is happening the table next to us had complained about her food and she was just sitting there waiting. The server comes back after being gone for a long time and we placed our order and this time im really looking at the time cause damn i was getting hungry at this point. Then came a family of 4 with a baby. They sat and sat and no one has come. You could tell by their faces they were getting irritated. It has been 36 min from the time we orderd and we're still waiting for our food and the baby is crying now. As soon as i saw the server I told her to boxed our food cause we had to go and she said 'let me go and check to see if the food is done' I chuckled out loud thinking this rediculous. She comes back from the kitchen and says,  \"my manager says you guys can just go and you dont have to pay for the orange juice\" i laughed so hard and we walked out.  At the same time the family of 4 walked out with us I mean i dont know what else I could say to convince you not to go to this place. I just hope that you'd get a better experience than us if you go.  Sucks we waited all that time and didnt have a chance to try some of the \"good food\" they supposedly have that  people had written on here about."}
{"text":"What a wonderful hidden gem! we went for lunch...i ended up not eating and enjoying a few drinks in this amazing arizona weather! Our waitress Kit was outstanding and so much fun! My guy did eat and loved it! I am looking forward to visiting this place more often and spending some daytime here! It was crazy windy, Kit gave me a hair tie..and my guy a blanket...what?? love it."}
{"text":"We have gone to this outdoor caf√©, which is  situated on one of the lakes nearby, several times. We've always enjoyed the atmosphere and the live music. The wait staff is friendly and the food is decent for bar food, but pretty overpriced. Be aware that some appetizers are really small portions and really expensive, I didn't feel they were worth the price. I still like this place, because it's really cute and comfortable!"}
{"text":"I'm very torn on the stars for this review ... The view, atmosphere, upgraded comfortable patio furniture, music, ect are fantastic and definitely 5 stars. The food is around 3 stars and any drink other then beer is 2 stars at best.. Really hoping the food and drinks get a little better, we really want to support this local gem."}
{"text":"Our guy Matt the bartender did everything to make our experience extraordinary. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"What a charming little place. It took my honey and I back to our beach trips and how much fun chowing down next to water is! We started with some brews and the crab artichoke dip. Beer is always good, and they have a decent selection - they need more local stuff though. The dip was solid, as were the chips and other dipping bits. 

For dinner I had the bowtie pasta - needed a little bit more salt, but otherwise it was delicious!  I didn't get the bread that I was supposed to though :( My honey had a burger, and said that it was pretty good. 

Overall, it's a lovely place with solid food. The view and atmosphere is casual and lovely, and the service was friendly. We'll definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"We bought some out of town relatives here to do something different. While the  view of the lake are great, we felt the service, atmosphere and food needed some improvement. The chairs were breaking, our server wasn't very attentive (drinks were never refilled) and the food was just OK. The fries were over seasoned and the chicken was dry, but the fish in the fish and chips was good. This place seems like a better place to go for a drink on a nice evening opposed to a meal."}
{"text":"I only went here because a co-worker suggested it for our company gathering.  Ugh.  First of all there are so many smokers outside, it ruins the whole concept of being outside!  I'm sorry but GROSS.  The server was very nice (and the only reason to give 2 stars) but the food was just hideous.  Everything was overcooked...to the point of being hard as a rock.  The patio itself is dirty and overrun with weeds and such.  Again we couldn't really enjoy the view because all of the smokers were at and/or near the bar where the view is.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"Entirely outdoors, Pier 54 is where my heart is. Real tasty food, location, ambience, live music, friendly faces, whatever your heart desires, you find it at Pier 54. I can't even begin to describe all the mouthwatering food I ate here, from meat or cheese platters, to burgers, to lamb skewers, to Romanian sausages (mici), even the salads taste amazingly good. I love their food presentation, which teases my taste buds as soon as the plate is in front of me (hence all the photos I take!). A few weeks ago, I had the best burger ever, juicy, with avocado and finished with an egg.... Just reminding myself of those flavors makes me salivate! I also had a Hungarian soup (unfortunately I do not remember the name of it), so good I ended up wiping the inside of the bowl with a piece of bread (manners had no room here!). We also had a few parties held at Pier 54 and they met all our expectations.
The live music is different every week (I believe Thursday to Saturday) and I love that they encourage local musicians to come and showcase their creativity. Oh, and I should also mention the sunsets, so unique in Arizona but even better from one of tables at Pier 54, right on the lake's shore. Did I mention we eat there at least once a week????"}
{"text":"Pier 54 wins the award for the WORST service in the Valley.  Our waiter, an Asian gentleman who never introduced himself, didn't spend any time with our large group.  Members of our group could barely if at all get refills and the food was just okay.  The waiter clearly didn't want to be there and after his service we didn't either.  Don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"They close at 11PM on a Saturday...do I need to say more? The service is still wonderful as the staff does not make the hours."}
{"text":"I read the other reviews on here expecting the experience to be pretty meh. I had been to The Watershed next door which had really slow, terribly service so I definitely had low expectations of lake view over quality of food and service. Pier 54 ended up being wonderful! Came in just after happy hour for taco Tuesday. Got a nice table immediately, served water and drinks quickly. Servers were nice and attentive. I liked the tacos and the prices were good! I would definitely come again for taco tuesday or happy hour. The deals for couples are also interesting. Definitely worth the view and going somewhere unique in Tempe ."}
{"text":"WOW! What a nightmare this place is! If I were you I would stay far away. I was there this last Thursday around 5PM. We were a party of 5. We were greeted pretty quickly, drink order taken, but then waited for drinks to arrive for at least 15 minutes.The bar was busy and taken care of , our waitress only had two other tables. Finally ordered. Food started to come out. Two of ordered fish and chips. Both came out without tarter, we had ordered extra. Waitress said they were out of tarter. We both said we didn't want fish W/O tarter. She took them back . I then ordered a burger. It came out almost raw, and smelled like rotten meat. Fries were ice cold. I sent that back and said I was done, I wanted nothing else. As my party was finished with their meals the waitress bring me another plate of fish and chips and says that they \"mixed\" up some tarter sauce. I kid you not , the tarter sauce was pink colored. I thought it was strange she didn't ask me before doing this, but the attempt to please was halted. Everything on this plate was cold as well. I think they took my other fries and fish I sent back and put them on a new plate with the \"mixed\" up tarter. 
Believe me out there, I am not that fussy , but this place really takes the cake!! RUN!
To top everything off , no one ever came out to see what was going on, apologize, try and correct the problems the waitress was having...nothing. The waitress just said she wouldn't charging us for what was sent back!! Yikes! Like she what we were going to pay for any of it??
Pier 54...hope you read these reviews..you really need a serious makeover of staff and policy."}
{"text":"Wonderful !! Decided to give this place a try because of the beautiful lake view. Staff was very friendly and it wasn't too busy so we were sat right away. The views were absolutely gorgeous and the food was good too! I got the club sandwich & fries- the fries were real potatoes so they were quite tasty. Easy to find location near Lakeshore and Baseline. Will be back!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years and I love the outdoor ambiance. It's a very relaxing environment and the food is decent. It's very laid back. Come here if you want to kick back chill.... Not if you're uptight and impatient. The service can be slow but it's not a fast paced type of place. So if you wanna chill outdoors by the water with a couple drinks and appetizers, this place is a perfect gem."}
{"text":"Cool marina style bar, however the food is seriously lacking.  Can't stress this enough, a $10 burger should be something special. Go for a HH drink and grab In-N-Out on the way home."}
{"text":"We got here and ordered happy hour tacos. My friend had mahi mahi and had 3 large bones and when my other friend asked to have her taco exchanged she not only got a smaller taco bit got charged for both. Horrible place."}
{"text":"Second time here. First time was ok. We are renting on the lake so it is sooo convenient. But second time was ridiculous. The burger was completely overlooked. Like foul overcooked. But the cook clearly didn't like us sending it back since we didn't get any fries the second time (we didn't eat the first - I guess we should have?!) and the second burger was clearly messed with by the \"chef\" who peppered the sh!t out of it in addition to overcooking it again. And then the waitress also didn't care. Watershed it is. Done with
This piece of shit."}
{"text":"Nice lakeside bar...  Beautiful views. . Special shout out to Tedi the owner he is amazing and went out of his way to accommodate us! Every time,The Pier does not disappoint!! NOW with my Favorite IPA on draft, I am in heaven!"}
{"text":"Can't beat their bottomless mimosa weekend special and the view is very nice.  I had the french toast, which was ok, but nothing special (did not taste any banana or vanilla).  It did take a long time for food and checks, but we had a large group and the staff were very apologetic. The service was excellent, so friendly and always checking to make sure we were doing ok, refilling waters and drinks, etc.  I would come back for drinks on a nice evening."}
{"text":"Really good food right near the water to enjoy while you eat! Reasonably priced and friendly staff. It's a great location, especially being in Arizona."}
{"text":"I love this place! My friends and I visit all the time for the awesome happy hour, excellent service, and incredible view. And the food is delicious!"}
{"text":"The place used to be nice about 4-5 years ago. Seems like they cannot handle more business. The service is always slow and on the bad side. The view is nice and I believe they count on their local customers from the surrounding houses for business. Food is a hit or miss too. Sometimes they have really nice food. Sometimes the burgers are cold. And unfortunately, I encountered some rude behavior from the waiters too."}
{"text":"Greatly impressed by how improved this restaurant is! We went a few years ago before the new management or owner and the food was never more than ok. Gave it a try again since the location is so good and really enjoyed it. Service was nice and the food was good, a bit above what I'd normally expect for bar food. We went when it was around 88 degrees and it was cool under the shade and they had fans running. Would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I've been to this place about ten times over a period of about 5 years and live within walking distance.  The food has been consistently very good (3 to 4 stars) and the service has always been very good as well (4 to 5 stars).  Waterside seating is unbeatable in the desert (5 stars)!  Twice I have had unpleasant experiences due to what I feel are rude or inconsiderate smokers who want to sit upwind of non-smokers.  Seriously, if you are sensitive to this do not eat or drink here because this is a 'smokers rights' place as I was told by a long time local the first time it happened.  I suggest an upwind non-smoking area be designated to include the tables between the bar and lakeside seating areas since this is the prevailing wind direction.  Only about 17% of people smoke these days so it seems poor business practice to cater to this minority of customers at the expense of the 83% majority.

Just went back after a long while and now there's a no smoking area so I am raising my rating to 4 stars."}
{"text":"We just went here at around 7pm. We walked in and noticed a swarm of flys over the fan in the picture. Thought nothing of it, but we were WRONG. This place should be shut down because of the flies and mosquitos swarming the dining area. Not only were the flies an utter nuisance, but our waitress and all of the staff were acting as if nothing was happening. Service was bad. We got our food to go after protecting an appetizer from the bugs. I regret that. This was a $50 meal for two with no alcohol. We could have gone to Flemmings with that kind of tab. The food we opened when we got home was anything but good. My boyfriends burger was burnt to hell after ordering medium rare, and my ahi tuna was overcooked at on a low temp causing a pink inner and stiff steak. Pilaf was good until I thought about how the flies could have easily flown into the kitchen and blended with the rice. I FEEL ROBBED.  Do not attend!!!"}
{"text":"This place is nice to come and have a drink at the bar or for a nice dinner. The view is beautiful at night but the only downside was the service. Our food was pretty good but it took forever to get to us. I had gone on a Saturday night for my birthday so I was planning on having some drinks but my waiter was hard to get a hold of and she only stopped once to serve us some more water. On the other hand if you mention your birthday they will bring you a slice of cheesecake but according to my waiter they don't sing happy birthday. Overall this is more of a place to go and have some drinks with a couple of friends but I suggest you eat before you go because the food takes forever."}
{"text":"I was disappointed with this establisment. The food was average, with my dogs I was relegated to a small strip of the patio but, worse, I had asked that my fries not be darkly fried, which they accomodated. However, the chef saw fit to use burnt toast; actually black, on my sandwhich, turning it around so I didn't notice it until I bit into it. I told the waiter. I don't know if he bothered to report it. They certainly didn't make it up to me. Finally, there are some specials, but they are only for two people or more. As a single person, they severely limit my options in this regard. I gave the waiter a 15% tip; I've worked as waitstaff before. He had forgotten my drink. I normally tip 20% or more. Needless to say, I probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Cute little place along the lakes. Drinks are expensive and the food is small portions with even bigger price."}
{"text":"Very nice environment with bad food, and awful service!!! Worst place I have ever been. Very careless people. Took them 45 minutes to bring a food and they weren't even busy. Not worthing your time and your money."}
{"text":"Pretty average food. The dog patio isn't great, it's down below by the lake and out of sight of the bar and kitchen. This translates to way less than attentive service. We had \"brunch\" on a slow Sunday and the service was pretty poor. Lovely setting, better concept than execution. If you're looking for good food and service, this is not your place. If you're looking for average food and unreliable service, go for it."}
{"text":"A group of us went for happy hour and received terrible service. The bartender told us to \"deal with it\" and we promptly left. They were under-staffed which is bizarre for happy hour, especially at a waterfront restaurant. The Watershed next door is a much better option!"}
{"text":"Decided to check out this place because it is a cute and romantically lit with string lights bar by the lake. 

First off, the place was a bit hidden. However, sitting by the bar looking out to the lake, especially during sunset, is an awesome trade-off. Our server was very nice and attentive. She was also the bartender who made our awesome drinks: Manhattan and Moscow Mules. She even asked for a whiskey preference when it comes to Manhattan :) 

We ordered a grilled salmon with a side of rice and a affettato misto sandwich with fries. Sadly, the food couldn't compare to the great service and drinks. My sandwich was VERY dry. The ciabatta bread was a little bit stale. The supposed-to-be homemade pesto is too basil-y and tasted like it came from a store-bought jar. The lettuce was also not so fresh-looking. At this point, the only thing I was looking forward to trying is my side order of simply basic fries. It turned out to be so-so: plain and not crispy :( My friend's salmon was gamey and the rice was super bland, which was describe to be somewhat like a grainy mush... 

Overall, great atmosphere for a casual and fun date, awesome drinks, decent price. However, food needs a lot of improvement so maybe eat before then come by for drinks afterward!"}
{"text":"This place is a fun relaxing hangout. Great happy hour specials daily. It's right on the water and always promises a beautiful sunset. 
Everything I've had on their menu is delish and tasty. They have a nice appetizer selection including a great cheese board and panko crusted Brie. 
I will continue to come here especially now that the weather is almost perfect. (It's outside seating). I've even come here in the summer and it's doable. Lol. They have sunscreens, misters  and fans. 
There is usually live music on the weekends which makes for a great casual date night. 
If you want a place to decompress from a long days work, this place has the cure!! Come and check it out."}
{"text":"I went here last night for the first time with a couple of friends. I give this place two stars because our food was good and the scenery is awesome. Our waiter Miles was terrible, sorry Miles. I was in the middle of giving him my order two times and he interrupted me and told me to hang on while he would just walk away and help someone else!! It was crazy! Finally got our apps and drinks in with him but after that we had to flag him down for everything!! Service was soooo bad. This is a cute place but more bar than restaurant. Lots of smokers...."}
{"text":"Beautiful Outdoor Setting on the water. Makes you feel like you're no longer in the city. Happy Hour till 6pm includes $5 pitchers of Bud Light & $3 well drinks. The waitress had difficulty explaining food items on happy hour menu. Ordered wings-6 for $3.75 on HH, and antipasta butcher board for $9.75. Wings were perfect, crisp on the outside and juicy in the middle. Butcher board was basic came with a lot of hummus but only a little brioche. Overall great visit & amazing atmosphere."}
{"text":"I visited Pier 54 about 3 weeks ago after a spring training game with some friends. The first thing I liked about this place is that it is an outdoor setting only. The combination of great Arizona weather and the fact it sits waterside makes for a really laid back and comfortable setting. The live music only further enhances one's experience.The wait staff is attentive and quick to serve. Sit back grab a beer and enjoy the view, cause the food takes some time getting to the table, but that is not necessarily a bad thing in my opinion. I had the Southwest Style burger, which was good, but not quite what I expected totally. Though I'm not a big beer drinker and nowhere close to being a connoisseur, this is the place where I was first introduced to Kronenbourg beer. The crab cakes as an appetizer are worth a try.  A great local hangout."}
{"text":"This place is in a beautiful location, but is a total dump. I walked up and saw all the dead plants, flooded ground due to out of control misters, and an overall run-down appearance."}
{"text":"Great little gem in the middle of Tempe. Makes you feel like you are at your favorite beach dive, if only for a moment. There is a new lake side restaurant next door as well, allowing you to beach (lake) bar hop to one more spot. The summers, I'm sure are brutal, but when it's acceptable to be outside, it's worth wasting away a few hours, dreaming about cheeseburgers in paradise."}
{"text":"How the hell did I end up in San Diego?? I was just on the 60!

I was so pumped about Pier 54 that I could barely eat, even though the food was pretty darn good.

Built along the edge of those zig-zaggy man-made lakes in the middle of Tempe, Pier 54 is tucked away from any traffic noise and the hustle and bustle of sprawling Phoenix life.  It's set up as a bar / restaurant combination, with a bar in the middle and seating all around it.  The bar has a couple of TV's mounted (old school non-flat screens!) so you can catch the Suns or the other teams that let Phoenicians down.

The food was good; I wouldn't send an email back home about it but definitely didn't detract from the experience.  I had the Shamu which was a battered cod sandwich.  It was pretty good and although the bun would have left a little to wish for, they toasted it which immediately adds some points - sneaky.  The fries were seasoned and came out hot.

Add the fact that even though we showed up five minutes before their last call takes place at 9:30p, the staff was really friendly and helpful.  They only had two beers on tap, but as previously mentioned one was the Kronenbourg 1664 which is one of my new favorites.

All in all, two sandwiches and a couple beers set us back about $25 bucks.  Not bad considering the area and view.  I'll definitely be returning for both Happy Hour and dinner in the future."}
{"text":"The first time we were here we ordered the salmon sandwich which was decent. I was very happy with the whole experience: music, drinks, food & a view. The second time I was totally disappointed! We ordered the chicken skewers which was a mistake, they were cold and dry! We ordered the smoked salmon flatbread and it tasted like a can! Music was not as good as the last time and you couldn't hear it because of the music next door. I still like the wine special, the view and the bartender's service was awesome!"}
{"text":"I live in the area and Pier 54 is very popular with the Lakes residents. Nice little place right on the water with typical bar food. Dog and people friendly."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place so much! Went there for a dinner with friends on a Friday night, the place was busy but not packed. Our server brought us waters, and then we had to wait a half hour for menus after asking multiple times. We got the hummus as an appetizer and it only came with pita bread so we asked if we could have some veggies on the side since it was being shared by four people. We had to ask for the veggies again because the server forgot, and he still didn't bring them until we were halfway through with our entrees. We had to ask repeatedly for the server to refill our water glasses, and throughout our meal he didn't check on us at all. The food was average and was a little disappointing, certainly nothing to make up for the service. While the location was nice, the side we were on had smokers, and in a small place like that it was just really unpleasant. This place seems like it has potential, but they really need to train the staff better, we won't be back after the experience we had."}
{"text":"I was skeptical about coming here, because of some of the reviews, however coming here was a great decision. I sat on the edge of the lake and watched the sunset while enjoying music being played live and drinks. Truly an awesome experience. I had calamari salad which was fresh with a garlic dip sauce, while my friend had the mix board with garlic bread and good quality meats. I will be back !"}
{"text":"Food was much better than I remember.  They have updated their menu and it's really nice.  Perfect for a causal relaxing Sunday brunch !!  I'll definitely be back.  Great ambiance and especially wonderful today bc weather is amazing and perfect to sir outside by the water."}
{"text":"I was very excited to dine here, but sadly my experience was awful. We asked to sit on the patio by the waterfront and our waitress told us that only people with dogs could sit there even though all but one table was open. I asked if she could please ask her manager if they could make an exception and she came back and told me that her manager said no. Apparently I have to come back with my dog in order to sit in that area. While our waitress was very nice the service was very slow and the food was terrible. I am extremely disappointed that my experience was not better because I love the venue and the vibe, but I would not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"An easy Sunday lunch that turned into a 2.5 hour debacle. This was our first visit and will sadly be our last.  When we sat down, we were told that the kitchen was backed up because of a large party who just placed their order...but turns out never got food before closing their tabs! Suspect it was just an excuse for the horrible service we were about to get.

We ordered the meat platter, BLT, and Italiana Salad. The appetizer came out minutes before the main course and was completely underwhelming. Salad greens were wilted and the bacon on the BLT was the only standout. Everything else was bland and mediocre.

We waited an hour for our food and another hour for the bill. And while we waited we saw several parties sit down but change their minds before getting service and others were in the same boat as us - just waiting. Luckily the other servers stepped in to help our otherwise slammed server. I've never been so tempted to warn people walking in to turn around and cut their losses!

Bottom line - Pier 54 boasts a great location by the lake but the food and service leave something to be desired."}
{"text":"We got bikes for Christmas and love exploring our local restaurants!! We were heading for The Watershed, but found Pier 54 to be quite the quaint little patio with a beautiful view of The Lakes. I felt like we were in Huntington Harbor on vaca!!!  We ordered beers and Clam chowder.  OMG!!  The clam chowder was just like the coast with tons of clams!  We will be back for sure on a regular basis."}
{"text":"Sweet location on a small lake in a nice subdivision. Cool atmosphere and the food is good and reasonably priced. Good date spot."}
{"text":"Greatest lakeside spot for a casual drink"}
{"text":"i had no idea this place existed! cute little place on a great patio over looking a lake. you feel like you've left AZ. 

their food is mediocre and it's nothing fancy. literally, their calamari is basically just fish sticks if that gives you any idea. we ordered chips and queso (decent), chicken strips w fries (delicious), quesadilla (good) and few other items. 

But the casual setting with the great view makes it a super nice spot to come for lunch and hang out for a bit. they also had a great bar area so even if you don't want to eat, this is a great drinking spot

i would totally go back!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Super chill laid back environment. Our server was awesome especially with how busy it was. The food was spectacular. Will definitely be back. 
PS to all these bad reviews, chill out. If you could stop looking for the bad and see how amazing this place is youd love it."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite local hangouts that has never disappointed, and seems to be getting better with the changes they are making to the menu. They have added some great salads, excellent sandwiches, and a few cool appetizers to freshen things up. 

I will take pictures of the menu on my next visit, but it was late and I was enjoying wine with friends to get into trying to update yelp.  

On this visit I kept it simple, BBQ sliders with fries, bottle of house red, and these awesome smores puffs things that made my week. All three items were great, as was the service. The BBQ pulled pork was juicy, with a hint of heat, and the fries seem to be house made fresh cut, which is awesome for a small local establishment. 

This lakeside spot is great for a lazy day of drinking or  nice bite to eat with family & friends. It doesn't hurt that the food is great, the staff is friendly and the drinks are cold while being within in riding distance via beach cruiser from my home."}
{"text":"Food is phenomenal, wait staff is professional, personable and effective. Plus the view! Love love love this place!"}
{"text":"I don't really know what to say because this place is magical. I couldn't believe it was less than a ten min drive from my place on Tempe Town Lake. The view is BEAUTIFUL. I shared a Cesar salad with a friend, which was perfect. The dressing was not anchovy-based so that was a fricken plus. I love love love Pier 54, and I recommend it for the perfect date destination."}
{"text":"This is a great place to be.  We used to live right down the street and came here at night and always had a good time.  Best place to sit and look out at the lake.  The food is pretty decent and great drink prices.  Never had a bad experience.  Get the smore fondue dessert if they have it."}
{"text":"Not accommodating. Rude server. Place was empty. Still rude. Do not bring anyone here. For the love of god, do not come here. Please save your time."}
{"text":"This place is anything but fancy but its exactly what you are looking for in a neighborhood eatery. I have tried several things on the menu and all have been pretty dang good for a small little place like this. The views over looking the lake are great and you have to love the open air environment. They occasionally have live music which can be good and bad as it sometimes is a bit too loud for the small space and well it doesn't exactly pull in top talent however still just a great neighborhood joint to grab some food and a beer. Oh and if you order $25 in food.. so basically 2 entrees and an appetizer you get a bottle of wine free. That is tough to beat right there!"}
{"text":"Is customer service dead? A group of friends and I came here yesterday evening to celebrate a birthday. Upon walking up, the outside of the restaurant is very cute and it's right off the water, making it the perfect spot for a date night or other special occasion. We were so excited to celebrate our friend's birthday, and one of us had called a week ahead of time to place a reservation. The girl on the phone told us that they do not accept reservations. When we arrived last night, we were greeted by a painfully awkward hostess who seemed to lack basic social skills. I politely informed him that we were here for a group, and needed room for (up to) 20 people. He said they don't have room for that many people, and said he would have to ask the manager. We are a pretty low-maintenance group; it's not like we were asking for a separate room for the party. We just wanted maybe a six seater to get us started, and have people casually come and go. Apparently this was too much to ask. 

After a few minutes of discussing this with the manager (who was very unfriendly and hesitant to even sit three of us), she finally sat us down by the lake, where we were able to pull two tables together (with no help from the manager or waitstaff). Not only did they make us feel completely unwelcome, but they couldn't even figure out how to put two tables together to at least seat a few of us... not ok. Maybe I'm a little old fashioned, but I've worked at some pretty awful places, but was still able to at least smile and treat people like humans. We ended up taking our food to go after waiting forever for some mediocre pita and hummus. It's very disheartening to realize that people just don't care about their customers anymore. I don't see this place staying in business long, which is a shame because the view/atmosphere is amazing."}
{"text":"We have ridden our bikes here a couple of times now and enjoy sitting outdoors and looking over the water. It makes you feel like you are somewhere else. 

It only has outdoor seating and they do take reservations although the couple of times we have been there we have been able to find a place to sit down. 

Food and service have been good when we were there. I have tried the flatbread and the turkey con chile sandwich. They were both fine. My husband has tried fish and chips and a burger. I prefer crispy fries and these are hand cut so not my favorite, but had no complaints, just preference. Not amazing, but it's really more about a nice place to sit outside, relax and enjoy being near water. 

One other time we stopped by with friends after trying dinner next door on a Saturday night and they had live music and that was good too!"}
{"text":"Pier 54 feels like its situtated somewhere in Florida. Great outdoor seating with that nautical feel. Stopped by on a Sunday for breakfast. Word of warning - don't come here if you're in a hurry or hungry. That being said, the servers could not be friendlier. Try the omlette, but the ordering process re: ingredients, is a bit convoluted."}
{"text":"This place could be a really great neighborhood spot.  It has great potential but the food misses the mark completely.  They serve the stuff that is left over in your pantry/fridge but don't want to make so you decide to go out instead.  For example they use canned salmon on top of their \"salmon salad\".  I mean how hard is grilling a piece of frozen salmon?  Their \"salmon tacos\" are the same thing.

Their menu is all over the map and needs to be cut down by 50%.  Its just a bunch of random bar food.  They should choose just a few things and do them well.  Not 40 things microwaved poorly.

Don't even get me started on their ice.  It makes their drinks disgusting.  I'm almost positive it is lake water.

Our server was nice but a complete clusterfuk.  It took 15 minutes to get dressing for a salad.  Not more dressing, just dressing period because they just forgot to put it on.

I will eat and drink almost anything anywhere but I have to draw the line somewhere."}
{"text":"Drinks Only! That would be my advice. We went here last night with a group of six and ordered multiple apps and dishes and the food was almost inedible. Don't get: pork tacos, fried cheese or calamari!! We tried fixing dishes with salt and even that didn't work too well.  Also drinks were ok but all the tap beer served was somewhat warm. Basically go here for the music and ambience and maybe a mixed drink."}
{"text":"We found this and thought this would be cool to have dinner by a lake.  It had great reviews. This is definitely not a place for kids.  If you are looking for a place to take a 1st date this is place the prices are decent and a great view. It is a bar atmosphere. The food is okay. Service again okay.  I gave 3 stars based on view."}
{"text":"Stopped by for happy hour specials. Ordered chicken tenders & fries an appetizer due to the special. The tenders were really great, fries were a little over crispy. Gummy bear cocktail is absolutely phenomenal! Didn't care for the other drinks I had. Patio is super cute overlooking the lake. Staff were friendly as well. Nice little hangout place."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to take out of town guests...and dates!! I have literally brougt so MANY different people here. It's all outside, atop a lake, hidden in a little quaint neighborhood. I call Pier 54 my \"Hidden Treasure.\" The white lights they put on aty night....awesome. The musicians they have on the weekends....phenomenal. :) LOVE! Also dogs are welcome!"}
{"text":"THIS IS LONG BUT WORTH IT. I've worked in the restaurant industry (Full Time) for the past 8 years now. Most bad reviews are hard for me to take seriously because usually the review is written by someone who hasn't worked in a restaurant. So I had to point that out before I begin so everyone reading this has a better sense of validating the truth to this review as it comes from the perspective of someone with an extensive back round in restaurants.

So here is my family's experience we went through yesterday at Pier 54 on Easter Sunday. Let me also point out that my family has been regular customers there literally for 20 years!

My Mom called in advance and made a 12:30pm reservation for 10 people at Pier 54 on Easter Sunday. Everyone places there order at 12:45 with the waitress. At around 1:50pm give or take a couple minutes, my dad asks waitress if our food is coming and she says,\"yeah I know it's taking a while but one of the ovens is broken.\" It's been an hour still  with no food, and she now tells us this about the oven? Is that real? At this point I look around the restaurant and I see some lady customer get up from her table, walks over to a waitress and screams at her saying she's walking out because her family too was still waiting for their food after over an hour. Within 15 minutes like a trickle effect I watch 3 more tables walk out haven't even gotten their food yet either.

I now look over  to see what the owner is doing. (Like I said my family is regulars so we know exactly who the owners are.)  I am not even making this up I watched the owner get in her car and drive away as she can see plainly her restaurant and staff in disaster mode, and even worse an entire restaurant of upset customers walking out whose Easter was now ruined, and not even a sense of decency on her own to come over to every table and try to remedy the situation. I too work in a restaurant so waiting for food is understandable especially on a busy holiday, so we weren't even upset about the wait, but just the fact that not even a manager after all this time had even yet come over to apologize let alone the owner herself who left when her restaurant needed her most.

Just before 2:15pm (an hour and a half after placing the order) 5 orders come out, but 5 of us still have no food. 20 minutes later the other 5 orders come out.  So it's close to 2:45pm, (2 hours after the order was placed) and finally everyone has their food. Now the fact that most of the food was cold was one thing, but if any Chef that I've worked with would've seen the lack of quality of the food they served us on those plates, they would've shut down that kitchen themselves. 

Most of our table now leaves to find another place to eat. Im fed up and finally get up and ask the bartender who the manager was and he said he was. I explained to him what was going on, he apologized profusely and said our entire bill would be taken care of. Our waitress even comes back right after that apologizing, saying how terrible she feels that our Easter is ruined and and tells us we don't even have to wait for a bill because of what happened. So even though we had a bad experience at least the manager and server did something to try and fix it.  The owner finally comes back in her car, which now the restaurant is cleared out. I walk up to her and have a great talk with her for 15 minutes about our experience, and about what went wrong, etc. She follows me back to the table where the rest of us were and she even apologizes in TEARS, saying how terrible she feels, and how sorry she is. My dad assures her everything is fine and that hed still always come back and bring others like he has been doing for 20 years.

We finally are leaving and I kid you not, the owner comes back with a bill for an $80 drink tab, saying shed take care of our food but we had to pay the drinks because its against the law to take care of our drinks. Giving away free alcohol vs having to COMP drinks are 2 different things she just didnt want to pay for the bill even after her fault for ruining our Easter. That showed us right there the person she was. I brought over the bar manager who earlier told me our bill was taken care of and I ask him right in front of the owner's face, \"did you tell us our entire bill would be taken care of,\" and he replied, \"yes I did say that.\" The owner then says, \"oh he doesn't know the rules, he was mistaken.\" She then tells us to pay the bill and that also we werent ever welcome back. At this point yes my dad did lose it and started cursing, which how can you blame after going through the worst restaurant experience ever in his life and then still being asked to pay $80 and being kicked out? THE BEST PART..As we were walking away I stepped to grab my keys on the table, the owner picks them up and throws them over the fence. Pier 54 in all my life I have never seen so many upset tables at once and for that you are by far the worst restaurant ive ever been to."}
{"text":"It is the pinnacle in entertainment experience!  The owner and management team is personable and very customer service focused.  I have traveled the world for 30 years  professionally and personally and  am amazed with the value and overall experience of the quaint \"San Diego\" like experience.  They accommodate every dietary request, we are a low carb family, with a smile and the meals are fabulous.  The vista is breathe taking and casual at the same time.  Please visit and enjoy!!

Why did I take the time to comment? I observed the most tragic \"lack of parenting\" phenomenon. I personally observed a family unit represent the worst in American entitlement culture .  The was an apparent  disconnect in expectations.  I support addressing them and I personally do but the manner was unacceptable!!!  The customers dropped F-bombs and where out of bounds of appropriate behavior in the background of Easter.  The owner comp'd them the meal and the family still retaliated on YELP. Really, this is a first class establishment and deserves 5 stars and if it dips based on a server mistake address it professionally with the owners and it will be resolved to your satisfaction.  

Please give this restaurant (Pier 54) a chance and you won't regret it!!  

I will sign my name and list my email if you doubt my conviction!!

{"text":"We've visited this restaurant monthly since 1990 and in that time it's had many owners.  The recent new owners offer poor quality food and even worse, terrible live music.  We have always endured through good food and bad, but the weekend music offerings have always been solid until this past year.   We enjoy hearing quality musicians, not obnoxious sing-a-long drama wannabes with no sense of musicianship.  Will be finding a new place to listen to music on Saturday nights.  The view overlooking the lake IS fantastic, and the staff always polite and capable."}
{"text":"Matt is the worst bar tender ever. Arguing with customers and rude. I will never eat or drink here again 



Every time I come here he is rude. Not personable at all."}
{"text":"Great food and great staff. Matt the bartender is the best. We live in the area and love going to the pier for happy hour with $3 well drinks and a great view right on the lake."}
{"text":"Beautiful view, terrible food. Go for drinks and avoid the food at all costs. I have eaten here several times and every time it gets worse!  This time, I ordered pizza and I took a bite and it was frozen! If I wanted red barons pizza, I would have stayed home. Asked for pepperonis, charged .50c and there was one pepperoni on it. Waste! These owners and food staff should retire."}
{"text":"Great little hidden restaurant in Tempe right on the lake! Food is good and the environment is very unique. They are dog friendly but be aware that there is no indoor seating, only outdoor. The upper patio is covered and has misters but I would be strategic as to when you visit to avoid the sweltering heat during the summer. Overall, I liked it and will be back with my dog!"}
{"text":"Ordered take-away for dinner. I arrived at the time they said it would be ready but had to wait another 20 minutes for it. Salmon looked like it was pre-packaged, thawed fish that comes in those vacuum seal bags and it was way overcooked. Also ordered bruschetta and it was on toasted white bread. The two meals and tip were not worth the experience. I would not try them again."}
{"text":"Looks like a pretty local spot. Decent prices and friendly bar staff. I think they could of used some live music on the patio Saturday afternoon, but thats just me. 
Positive......food looks great, even though I was just drinking today.
Bartender was great and friendly very quick.

Negative......I don't want to see your cooks on break smoking at the bar then head back into the kitchen.
I disliked your beers on draft. 

When weather permits.........this is a great bar to be outside at!!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a laid back vibe, look no further. The water front restaurant reminds me of something you'd find near a beach Mexico. Nice beer selection for such a small place. Good food at a cheap price. Spend $20 on dinner and you get a free bottle of table wine. Outdoor seating only, and smoking is allowed. Only knock would be the cleanliness, but I'm not expecting much anyway when going to an outdoor only dive."}
{"text":"Very casual bar. Food isn't bad and the drinks come quickly. I used to live in the neighborhood,  and although it was usually a crowd that consisted of regulars, everyone has always been really friendly there. Lots of parking, and because it is a bar inside a neighborhood it is quiet and relaxing. The main reason to go to the bar is for a view at sunset. The bar overlooks a neighborhood lake, and people can actually travel by boat to the bar and dock right there. Calm, peaceful and friendly. They usually have someone playing live music on weekend nights and that can get pretty loud, so if you are looking for quiet on a weekend look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Beautiful location. Right on the water. Cool to hang out and have some drinks. Good service. I don't recommend the food.  We had a variety of items and no one in our group was pleased. Expensive to boot."}
{"text":"The real reason to come here is the location. Located far from major roads on a quaint little lake sits one of the best patios in town. 

The breakfast food we had was mediocre as the eggs were a bit over cooked and took time to arrive. 

If you do want a beer they have a good selection, and I cant think of a better place to sit and enjoy one."}
{"text":"This is for a visit from October 2015. 

A big group of us were in town for an event and made reservations at Pier 54 for a group dinner. The service was not good at all. We were 20 people separated into multiple tables. It took a while for the waiter to come and take our orders and to bring us our drinks. Then, things got worse when it started to rain! Obviously, the restaurant cannot control that, but what they can control is them helping us and they didn't. We had to move the tables ourselves underneath the limited area that was covered and at one point, the waiter was just standing there watching us scramble and move the tables and didn't even do anything. When the food came, it was cold and dry. And when we asked for our check, the waiter offered separate bills for each table which we gladly accepted since she offered and then later when we expressed concern about how long the bill took, the owner came out and said it took so long because we asked for separate checks. Hmm.. let's rewind there... the waiter offered so we gladly accepted otherwise we all had cash to pay for the bill. My last comment is that I honestly think this restaurant shouldn't have taken our reservation because they were not equipped to serve such a big party."}
{"text":"Lucky to even get one star.....place was dirty and service was extremely slow. Waited to be greeted by our server for over 15 minutes. Beer selection was nothing I couldn't find at a corner gas station. Ended up leaving after one round to enjoy a better atmosphere next door at the watershed."}
{"text":"Delicious food, great service and AMAZING view! I recommend everyone to stop. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Would be a great hang out if 1) it weren't mid-summer since all seating is outdoors and 2) if they cleaned up around their patio.  My garage is less messy.  Had the fish and it was undercooked....  Beware."}
{"text":"the pier 54 is a great local spot to have a nice drink and a great meal. They have live music on Friday and Saturday night the food is delicious and the people are great I highly recommend it"}
{"text":"Good neighborhood spot. Very casual and dog friendly. Cocktails are strong, and food is as good as I'd expect in any bar daring enough to have seafood on the menu. It is outdoor seating only - great for cool Zona nights, and the lakeside view is sweet. Lots of free parking is a bonus.

I would recommend they have more support staff. The waitress was too busy so the service suffered and she was a wreck."}
{"text":"The view is amazing!! Very quiet and comfortable atmosphere.  Service isnt the best, even on a slow day. Seems like the server/bartender has too many other things to do than serve the customers. I will definitely come back, i love it here too much, just wish the service was better."}
{"text":"SAVE YOURSELF THE TIME AND A HORRIBLE STOMACH ACHE. Absolutely worst service I've ever experienced. Waited at our table for 15 minutes before anyone acknowledged us, when a waiter finally came over to ask what we wanted to drink, he was rude and got our order wrong! Then we put in our dinner order, the food was mediocre at best...very bland. After we left both of our stomachs started lurching, we were sick all night long. Needless to say, we will NEVER be back!!"}
{"text":"Such an amazing place. It was a wonderful evening to sip some wine and ended up here with my lady.

Ordered:
Sparkling Chardonnay: Tasted delicious and was lite. This is my first time trying wine and totally loved it.
Hummus Appetizer: Tasted great. Pita bread was freshly cooked and hummus tasted really good.

Good ambience by the lake and so peaceful. Totally recommend this place if you are around Tempe and wanna chill sipping wine."}
{"text":"Romantic beautiful venue. Drinks on the deck overlooking the water. Casual atmosphere, no pretense here. We even had a magician come to our table and do a card trick and left us with a souvenir. Shared an spinach artichoke dip which was yummy. Would definitely come back again. Also had live music which was a plus.  This is all outdoors so be prepared."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to hang. Beautiful view and fabulous people. Especially the staff. Special shout out to Larissa and Andrea the amazing bartenders!"}
{"text":"I hesitate to even write a review because I don't want other people to know how FANTASTIC this place is. Wow. We had no idea what to expect when we came here (it was just close to where we heading after dinner) but oh my gosh, what a hidden gem. Except its apparently not that hidden because its a lively outside bar/restaurant. And the food is good and so cheap! Flatbreads, huge salads, delicious sandwiches (my husband got a chicken sandwich that he raved about). They had a deal that if you spent $25, you got a free bottle of wine. Seriously???? How awesome! And I almost forgot, its on a lake so you instantly feel transported to a beach vacation.

Go try this price! I honestly cannot think of a negative thing to say."}
{"text":"This place is really cool--kind of gives the \"dinner on the dock\" feel of SF, but it's inexpensive and casual. There is no indoor seating, so mind the weather before you head out there. It's kind of hidden so make sure you read the directions on where to go!

Service is comparable to any other bar/sports bar kind of joint, and the laid back atmosphere is part of that."}
{"text":"Cool place to hang out lake side and enjoy a drink. Enjoyed the pork tacos, thanks!"}
{"text":"I went to the Watershed last Thursday and I loved it. So I came back on Monday afternoon and the Watershed was closed. So we came to Pier 54 instead.

The food and drinks are much more casual compared to the Watershed. I had soup and salad and my friend had a burger. We enjoyed our food and the service was great.

The view of the lake is not as good as The Watershed.

Overall, it was a good experience, but I don't see any reason why I would come back."}
{"text":"everytime i go here i crack up laughing and meet the funniest people at the bar...they serve Heffveisen on tap-fabulous and the bartenders and waitresses are super nice. I am pissed OFF however that they no longer can have dogs there. TOTAL BUMMER! Oh and the veggie burgers rock! and so do the yummy french fries-steak fries. its a good place- go visit and the view is nice, right on the lake and all lit up."}
{"text":"We love the atmosphere of PIer 54. The pizza and quesadillas are pretty good. You are really going there for the atmosphere and a drink.

Heads up DOG OWNERS: Recently they are NOT dog friendly any more. The pup's have to stay on the outside of the fence. But the waitresses are always so nice and bring a bowl of water for the dog. So still bring them, just know there not allowed on patio any longer."}
{"text":"Our second visit here (a week after our first) and loving this place! They appreciate their customers, are friendly & personable and the food is amazing. Besides the obvious great lake view, they know how to treat their clients.... Thank you Pier 54!"}
{"text":"I met a friend here last night for dinner, this was our first time here. I was surprised initially how fast and attentive the service was, sadly it didn't last long. Our server never came back until after we were finished with our meal. I would have loved to have a refill on my drink or some more ranch. Guess that was too much to expect. The views and setting are stunning and well worth the trip through the neighborhood to get there. The giant fans were a big detraction (kinda noisey but you can't avoid them) and the cigarette smoke from a fellow diner was gross. We will go again and hope for better service next time. I'm sure as the weather continues to cool the fans will be uncessary. Hopefully we won't encounter any smokers again."}
{"text":"Came here with my girlfriend for some dinner during happy hour. I had the pulled pork and it was pretty tasty, good size portion on a pretzel bun. She had a prosciutto spinach croissant and enjoyed it as well. This place seems like a nice laid back place, I'll definitely be back cuz it's close to home. The view of the pond is nice too!"}
{"text":"We have been in Arizona for 3 days now and each day have stopped here at least for an appetizer.  Twice for meals.  The service has always been timely, efficient and friendly.  It's self seating with a few exceptions of crowded nights.  It is all outdoor seating with a smoking section and some bar seating.  There was a live band last night, Thursday.  She was amazing.  
The food has been fantastic every time.  The owners have only had this place for a few years and have been striving to change the image from fast and greasy to relaxed and offer fresh healthier alternatives.  They hand pick their vegetables.  They cut their own French fries.  We got the garlic fries one night.  It was amazing.  Big enough chunks of fresh garlic to offer a little heat.  It may not be what you're use to.  They're not twice fried, like McDonald's.  We had the ahi tuna steak with mixed vegetables.  The glaze was perfect.  A reduction of soy and garlic and not sure what else.  The steak was big enough for my husband and I to share.  Comes on the rare side unless you specify otherwise.  But that is how we like it.  Fresh vegetables were organic cauliflower, green beans, yellow squash and red peppers lightly saut√©ed so that they were still crispy.  Perfect!  
  They have a small kitchen.  So if you have time restraints talk to your server and they'll tell you what can be done quickly.  They always have something fun going on.  Happy hour every day (I think) from 3-6.  They had a raffle there one night this week for a free hair appt, pedicure and massage.  And everyone is right.  You can't be the view!   

This is a place to relax, catch up with friends and not be forced to eat the same ole bar food that we have all grown tired of.  Light up a cigar.  Laugh and talk.  Life is too short not to enjoy it."}
{"text":"There is only outdoor seating.

We had a party of 12 and they were NOT prepared at all. They knew we were coming. Our service was horrible very slow and the sever was never around. The food came out cold and not all at once. I was done eating before the hostess got her order.

A couple people in our group had eaten here before and they said the food was bad then but they were giving it a second chance and yet again the food was another big disappointment.

They had big cooling fans blowing on our table and when the band played the section we were sitting lost power so we had to finish in the dark and sweating our asses off cuz the blowers went out. 

If its winter & you want to have a drink by the \"lake\" then yeah I'd suggest this place, but don't waste your money if you want food."}
{"text":"Take your date.  Take your mom.  Take your out of town guests when it's snowing and sleeting from back where they came from so they can be jealous of your wonderful life in sunny Arizona.  This is a great place that most people don't know about.  You go through The Lakes in Tempe (it's a little fancy suburb).  The restaurant is right by the lake.  You feel like you are somewhere tropical!  
The menu is nice and simple, but there isn't a bad thing on it!  The beer selection is great and the mixed drinks can't be beat!  My boyfriend and I go here all the time and take all of our Chicago family and friends when they come to visit.  
This is the perfect little spot :-)"}
{"text":"Don't be put off by the looks of this small, outdoor restaurant. The food is excellent! 
A few tables surround a large open bar, all with a view of the smallish man-made lake that sits inside an upscale housing development. As we ate, we watched a beautiful sunset over the lake, and also saw a few homeowners guide their boats up to the restaurant's small dock. 
Everything was delicious, from the hot crab and artichoke dip through the entrees to the dessert. I like to try something new, so I ordered salmon tacos with mango salsa and chipotle mayo, My husband is more traditional, so he had the Torpedo -- a man-sized prime rib sandwich with plenty of tender meat. I was tempted by the brie quesdadilla with candied walnuts, and my husband wants to go back for the Southwest pizza. 
And for dessert? Get this -- they bring a hibachi to your table so that you can roast marshmallows, dip them in a pot of melted chocolate, then roll them in graham cracker crumbs! Unfortunately, we didn't have time for that luxurious experience as we were on our way to an event, so we got the New York cheesecake with berries to go. 
Around the bar, the crowd was young, with some middle-aged people, and a couple of seniors. But they all were having fun, which made the mood of this small place happy and lively. 
The place is owned by a husband/wife catering team, so the menu may change with the seasons."}
{"text":"A few mishaps, but we'll try it again for the waterfront alone. We arrived kinda late (930pm) on a Saturday night. The guy singing had just ended, but it seemed like he was a hit. 
We were greeted immediately and we could choose our own seats.  
We tried to order the spinach artichoke dip, but they were out.  We ordered a Flatbread...also out. The server was trying to help us out,  but it definitely was bizarre to be out of key items. 
We settled on sharing a sandwich instead of getting an app like we wanted.  Chicken pesto sandwich was good!  Hand cut fries aren't my favorite, but these were okay. 
Drinks were good.  
The waterfront view is perfect. 
The crowd is a little.....um....everyone surrounding the bar was over 45 and smoked. 
We'll go back to check it out during the live music"}
{"text":"Haven't  even eaten but I'm giving it a 1 star. There's not that many people here but the service is HORRIBLE!  3 waiters walked pass me and didn't say a word; I came in and stood there forever and wasn't sure if I was supposed to seat myself or not. No greet- nothing! It took over 20 mins for anyone to even acknowledge my existence. I actually got up and got my own menus! When the waiter came over- instead of talking to me- he checked his phone. Just rude. I'll stick to the watershed next door.

Update: my shrimp was raw !"}
{"text":"First off, let me start by saying I love the fact that this place is on the lake and that it is dog friendly. That being said, we went here on St. Patrick's day and it was a little busy but not too bad, we got our seats right away and our waiter brought our drinks and menus out promptly. They had cheap drinks (I'm pregnant so I didn't get to enjoy them, but my friends absolutely loved them), and we were really enjoying ourselves.

 After waiting about 20 minutes, we finally got our order in. The waiter seemed out of it, almost like he had had one too many Irish car bombs himself, because every time I spoke to him it took him way too long to respond. People that came long after we did got their food way before we even got our appetizers. When we got our entrees the burgers tasted charred and disgusting, it was a weird spicy taste that ruined the whole thing. The cheesecake was pretty good for desert and we loved the ambiance, but after the food..I will not go out of my way to go here again."}
{"text":"Very disappointed you can't have your dog with you upstairs anymore. Hope they change that and how the food is prepared back to how it used to be."}
{"text":"Love finding places to dine in Arizona with my pup. She doesn't get any people food and has not become a begger yet, therefore she's a good dinner companion. Every time I come here there are other pooches and they all sniff each other out, it's great. Any place that allows furry friends on the patio gets my respect. So when I've been working a long day and don't want to leave Clover at home while I chill out, this is where I'll head.

The food is not mind blowing but it's good. I've had the salmon salad a few times, it's different and pretty good. In the winter they have a fire going, so it's lovely to sit next to it with a nice view of the water in front. It makes me feel like I'm not in Arizona, eating in a strip mall like is often the case.

I hosted a birthday dinner here for a friend and the owner was so great and helpful. She had me send people's food preferences ahead of time and things were ready to rock when we showed up. They had hot chocolate going to warm people up, had to have some baileys in mine, it was a great night. We were served so quickly and they did a great job remembering everyone's orders.

Great little hidden gem in Tempe, I want it to stay hidden though!"}
{"text":"I always been a fan of this place. I love its laid back atmosphere.  They have live music pretty regularly and there outdoor patio is just the right size not too little and not too big.  This evening a guy named Jake played and he is AMAZING.  

The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is I've been on a Malbec kick for a few years and there Malbec is mediocre at best.  I wouldn't order it again and it was warm, really warm.   I don't think I ever had red wine that warm before.  

But overall for a neighborhood spot this is one of my favorites."}
{"text":"Just came here on a slow Saturday. My girlfriend and I ordered an omelet, skillet and biscuits n' gravy. The food came out and nothing was as expected. The omelet was under cooked and watery, the skillet was just a mush of things thrown together and the biscuits were tiny with the gravy barely noticeable. In fact the gravy looked clear because it was also so watered down. The only thing we really couldn't look past was the omelet. My girlfriend tried it to make sure it wasn't how it was supposed to be and the one bite made her feel sick. Between the two of us we've had many years working in the restaurant industry so we are very patient and neither of us hardly ever complain. However we decided we had to send back at least the omelet. That was the plan at least except our server didn't return until we were ready for the check about 30 min later. She walked past us several times though and didn't acknowledge us or the empty coffee cup, the uneaten food or the empty waters. We were finally able to ask for the check and inform her that the omelet was under cooked after we ended up splitting my unappetizing skillet. When she returned with the check she said she let the kitchen know about the omelet and they said \"it wasn't undercooked that's how it comes.\" It was a final test of patience as I wasn't about to argue about a dish as simple as an omelet that was raw inside and had a pool of liquid In and around it. We left having experienced the worst food and service we've ever had together."}
{"text":"We live close to Pier 54 and visit it occasionally for a drink or light dinner.  It's a nice change to be able to sit outside in Arizona when the weather allows, and the weekend live music is pleasant and not overwhelming.  

Pros:
Food.  Really good and at a reasonable price.  Not too fancy, but a cut above the usual bar food you'd expect from this kind of place.  The sandwiches and flatbreads are nicely prepared. 

View:  Situated on Tempe's Lakes development, Pier 54 offers a nice view with plenty of seating when the lower level (lakeside) is open.  And the misting system is much better than other outside bars in the summer, if sometimes a bit too \"wet\".  

Dog friendly: Dogs are welcome, and we enjoy this feature.

Entertainment:  Subtle guitar players on weekends.  Not too loud to drown out conversation.  

Cons:
Service:  We'd give it a higher rating if it wasn't for the spotty service.  If the bar is over half full, service is dicey, particularly on weekends.  If you're sitting at the bar, it's quite efficient, but Pier 54 needs to work on their staffing needs.  We've regularly waited ten minutes for our first contact with a server, almost to the point of walking out.  Either hire enough servers or schedule more at heavy traffic times.  That said, all the wait staff we've had were friendly and pleasant.  

Decor: Pier 54 could use a facelift.  The tables and bar are old and dingy, and the overall decor looks like it was slapped together by college kids.  While cleanliness is average, the place is is serious need of a makeover.

Summary:  With the nicely appointed and great food offered by Waterhouse next door, Pier 54 faces some stiff competition, but it's nice for what it offers.  I'd recommend weekday nights until they figure out how to properly staff the restaurant.  Nice little neighborhood pub. 

Note:  This is a bar that permits smoking as it's all \"outdoor\"."}
{"text":"Views and Drinks are fabulous.  Now they could work on cleanliness and the wait staff.  Good ok.  But you come here to look out at the water any way."}
{"text":"Great place on the water nice people good food good drinks great atmosphere nice vans beautiful lights nice houses cool trees nice tables"}
{"text":", I've been wanting to check this place out for awhile and thought today was the perfect time... or so I thought.  We got there and they were busy but with several tables opened and maybe two people at he bar. When we walked in, there was not one server on the floor and the bartender was missing as well. After waiting a few minutes someone came out of the \"kitchen\" and I asked about seating. I was told it was open seating with the exception of the downstairs area.. well I didn't even know they had a downstairs so I was fine. We sat down, just two of us, and proceeded to look at the menu.  We waited for about 15 min and not one person acknowledged us during this time.  No one offered water ... mind you this was Saturday afternoon (12:30) and it was quite warm/hot.  Water would have been nice. After another 5 min or so we decided to get up and leave.. on our way out, a waiter did notice us but made no attempt to talk/stop us. During our 10-15 min there we had noticed three people walk in and sit at the bar, bartender came out and promptly served them their drinks... I wished we had sat at the bar.  We ended up leaving because even though we were not in a hurry, the fact that no one even acknowledged us or offered water made it not worth waiting to see how bad the rest of the service was going to be... not sure if I would ever want to come back, to bad because they seemed kind of a fun casual place to hang out."}
{"text":"Barely sat down and had to leave because of all the smokers. Only seating is outdoors and a majority of customers seemed to be smoking. Very disappointed because I wanted to enjoy the view and taste their food. Won't be returning"}
{"text":"We love to go here because it is in the hood but the service is S l o w. We waited 45 minutes for lunch. They hooked us up with lemon cake because we waited so long, but lunch shouldn't take this long. The food and drinks are yummy!"}
{"text":"Been making this little joint my cocktail lounge, as I could spit on my place from the patio. .. when I first started coming here about seven months ago. Smash.  Couldn't go wrong....

Lately. .. what the Fart noise happened?!

Beer is always flat, got rid of the best one too and brought in several flavorless substitutes. Lamb too tough, fish overcooked... I don't get it.

BUT! The sandwiches are pretty damn good. Breads are fresh, served a bit toasted. .. warm and a bit crunchy. Fresh meats and cheeses. Get the cheese and meats with a cocktail. 

Also. Go for the pastrami cheese burger. You'll pay the same at another bar for a comparable burger; but this one has pastrami.... so that's good.... ask for fries \"crispy\" otherwise they have a tendency to arrive much as a cat from a storm... \"wet and disappointing\"... what that's not how you feel when your cat shows up like that?! You know what.  I don't need this crap...  

Where was i...Oh, yeah. MAHI MAHI tacos. Those were freakin good. 

 Food. .. good-ish... they really can do it. .. i dunno, be specific on how you enjoy your grub cooked? Cocktails; reasonably priced and heavy handed. Get a good looking doll down there with you and have a nice night. 
 
FIX YOUR BEER!"}
{"text":"This place is one of the best venues in Tempe. Cheap drinks, waterside, and one of the only places around here to find live music on the weekends. Service has been great everytime I have been there. It does get a little busy on the weekends and recommend getting there before 6. Not to mention the gorgeous sunset being able to be seen right from the table. I will always come back!"}
{"text":"the only complaint i have is that they close too early! other than thatt, the food is amazing and the service is great. a warning: be prepared for an amazing but strong drink if you give the bartender free reign:)"}
{"text":"Much better than watershed.  Great atmosphere for drinks alongside the lake.

Live music was decent, food was good.  

Would recommend."}
{"text":"Best bar menu in the valley, live music weekends, perfect view of lake, cordial staff....Its the best!!!

{"text":"This place is awesome. Our server, Miles, was friendly and helpful. The atmosphere was perfect and the food was phenomenal.  We will most definitely be back."}
{"text":"Very cool small outdoor bar that over looks the lake. The ambience is top notch and they have misters to keep things cool when it gets hot out. Last time I was there, there was a musician setting up for live music. I personally avoid live music at all costs, but if you're into it this would be a fun spot. Out of the few times I've been here the service has been pretty average. I've only eaten here one time and i am hesitant to give them another chance. The fish sandwich I ordered was nearly inedible. My friends both ordered soup and said it was mediocre. But their draft beer selection is pretty good and they have my favorite, Hop Knot, so the bar gets my stamp of approval. The only draw back is that they don't stay open very late 10pm most nights, so its a happy hour or early evening location. All in all the ambiance and the bar are great, there's entertainment if you like live music, but this shouldn't be your destination if you are looking for a meal."}
{"text":"Pier 54 was a cool spot. Food was very good (I got the Garden burger & side salad).
Service was pretty weak though. And one star off for the lack of TV accessible seating, and because half of the customers were chain smoking cigarettes."}
{"text":"1 star for the meat and cheese platters and the second star for the view and live music combination. The singer tonight was fantastic, great talent they found in him (unfortunately didn't catch his name). The meat and cheese played were very satisfying, the accompanying bread was crispy yet somehow soft. A perfect pairing. 

The rest however was just awful. To start the service was terrible. took forever to even be served water, let alone get our order taken because he just kept walking by. We waited ~40 mins to get said cheese and meat platters! Then the food....dreadful. Nobody finished their meals. They forget to even put my order in. The salmon was dry as a rock, the steak skewers were tough and overcooked, and they didn't have any of their tacos on the menu except brisket...and we don't think there was even any brisket under the huge beds of cabbage! 

Upside, if you spend $25 between two people you get a free bottle of house wine ($25 isn't even worth it though unfortunately)."}
{"text":"I love this place but will never go there again until they let you order a grilled cheese at dinner time. The waitress said they get the same request all the time and the owner will not let them serve the grilled cheese for dinner, even if you are willing to pay the full price for a dinner item. As a vegetarian there is not much to eat, and a grilled cheese is a good go-to. It is absolutely ridiculous that I cannot eat a meal they usually offer just because of the time of day. My entire family and I would go there for dinner all the time if not for this, so they've lost a lot of business. This rule makes absolutely zero sense and is losing them a ton of business, and not just from my family, as the waitresses said many others have the same issue. Awful."}
{"text":"We were told that we had too many people and were asked to leave after we ordered food and bevs. Staff was less than friendly while several fully uniformed workers sat staring past their drinks while seated at the bar. 
This is not the place that it once was where my friends and my dog were welcomed."}
{"text":"Great for listening to music on a casual evening,  Good food with a variety from light to more substantive.  Great fresh salad.......Wish I had a boat to float over there and listen from it. Good and pleasant service."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a drink on the lake-reasonably priced, decent food...to be honest, I've mostly just stopped in for a cocktail. Staff is great...and all around good deal"}
{"text":"I visited a couple weekends ago with my wife; very nice view of the lakes, pretty fair price on drinks.  However, the food and service was average at best. The place next door was hosting a wedding and had a larger patio, we will probably try that next."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed! I had quick service, great food, and a wonderful atmosphere!! Will definitely be back for happy hour! It's truly a hidden gem! :)"}
{"text":"Good food, friendly staff, and a nice relaxing atmosphere. The hot and sour flatbread is tasty!"}
{"text":"We have just put the final nail in the coffin for Pier 54.  Our first visit took about an hour and a half from start to finish and all we ordered were two salads.  They were great, but I just couldn't understand why the restaurant allowed 1 employee to work both the bar and the patio area.  After not being greeted 10 minutes after seating ourselves , we cut our second trip short because we were not willing to endure horrendous service again.  Pier 54 has good salads and a great view, but don't expect to be in and out of this place in a reasonable manner/have adequate service."}
{"text":"I rarely complain about bad service, but it was really bad here.  We were in town for an event and went to Pier 54 with a large group of people.  It took a long time to get our food.  Once we got our food, it started pouring.  Since the entire restaurant is outdoors, a good amount of the tables are uncovered.  No one came out to help us.  We covered our food with napkins and started to move the tables ourselves.  I understand mother nature is out of their control, but they could have done more to help us.
We asked the server to close us out and after 20 minutes, still had no check.  I went and asked her again and told her I was in a rush to get somewhere else..still no check.  The third time, i brought cash to pay.  She went back in the kitchen and didn't come back out for another 10+ minutes.  We were close to just walking out. (i honestly don't think the server would've even noticed)  From the time we asked for the check till when we left was almost 45 minutes.
I understand that good service can be difficult with big groups, but you would think that so many paying customers, they would try a bit harder to provide better service.
Although there were 20 of us, we sat at separate tables with separate checks.  5 tables of 4 people could not have been that difficult.  
We sat down at 5:30pm and left at 8:00pm to go eat dinner somewhere else.  It took 2.5 hours for 3 apps, one sandwich and 2 drinks...that is pretty unacceptable. 

I am only giving them 2 stars because of the nice view and the tasty cheese balls."}
{"text":"This place could be a great place to go if they would just clean out some of the clientele.  Please get rid of all the gross smokers and stop serving flat draft beers.  Nice views of the lake and the food is decent.  Always a let down when we go there because of some of locals that attend and ruin it."}
{"text":"One star because I have to.
It's unfortunate when you can't support a local restaurant, but the service today was dismal and inexcusable. 
Came for the ambiance, left with nothing but a bad taste in my mouth after an HOUR AND A HALF of waiting!!! No food, had to go to the bar to get my water refilled. We ordered chicken tenders and a Ruben, this was not a large or complex order. Not one patron at the establishment had food. All I could get is \"we're working on it\". 
Poor excuse for a restaurant. Couldn't pay me to come back and waste my time."}
{"text":"Order chicken wings! Waiter came back 30 minutes later and said!!
Sorry we are out of wings!! I am from Canada but you guys are not on this planet! Replace the owner and management???"}
{"text":"The bar is shaped like a \"G\" and my friends call this place \"The G spot.\" They took me along last night. I loved the outdoor setting overlooking the water. The place was jam packed when we got there, a guy was playing an acoustic guitar and playing songs I like. I liked the selection of beer on tap, the bartender made me a shot with whiskey and pineapple juice. (Sounds kinda gross but it was good.) I didn't eat, but my friends got a smores fondue. Service was great considering how busy they were.
I enjoyed the place so much we stayed until closing time."}
{"text":"I had very high hopes for this place... The location was great and the drinks were good. The food on the other hand was not good. We went for Mother's Day with a reservation at 11:30am. We didn't receive our food until about 1:30. Absolutely horrible. Our server ran his butt off trying to wait on the whole patio. Why they had only one server for an entire patio on Mother's Day, blows my mind. Once the food came it was average at best. Nothing to write home about. My boyfriend got the special which was a lamb shank with mashed potatoes. He said it was absolutely flavorless and gross. Even the table next to us asked what it was and said it looked disgusting. The manager really needs to realize they need more staff especially on a holiday to accommodate everyone and work on their food."}
{"text":"This place is super cute and it's nice to eat down by the water. Food is decent but the brunch menu is kind of lacking with not many options to choose from. Staff and service were great every time I've gone."}
{"text":"Enjoy a picturesque view of the lake while dining in a casual atmosphere. Pier 54 offers sandwiches, burgers, flat bread, and salads. The first time we went here our burgers were more on the well done side rather than medium as requested, but were still tasty. I've also had the salmon BLT, which had a generous portion of tender salmon with crispy bacon and lettuce. 

While I've enjoyed the food here, service can be hit or miss depending on how busy it is. On our last visit they were severely understaffed and the poor waitress was the only one there to check up on a nearly full seating of tables.

The plus of outside seating is that they are extremely dog friendly. The minus of eating outside (If you are sensitive to smoke) is the plethora of smokers that tend to frequent this restaurant.

While the atmosphere is great, some of the chairs could use some cleaning or replacement. The ones at our table had cushions that were supposed to be a cream color, but had some dirty brown spots on them.

Overall I'll definitely be coming here again to try more of their menu items, but probably at a less busy time."}
{"text":"The only good thing about this place is the view. Absolutely beautiful lake views. That's where anything decent ends. I went there with friends for what we thought would be a relatively short lunch. It wasn't even that busy because it was overcast but it took the waitress over 10 minutes just to acknowledge us. We ordered our lunches and my friends ordered some drinks. It took the bartender 15 minutes just to get the drinks. We waited more than an hour for the food during which the waitress didn't even come over to provide updates that it was coming out or being worked on or  see if we needed drink refills. We needed to leave so my friend actually had to go in the kitchen area to tell the waitress that we needed the food boxed so we could go. We get the boxed food over 15 minutes later & when I did get a chance to eat it, it wasn't even that great. Maybe this place is okay for drinks at sunset but that's about it."}
{"text":"Pros: 
-Dog friendly restaurant
-Strong drinks 

Cons:
-Slow service
-Mediocre food (at best)"}
{"text":"This place has such a nice spot! The view of the lake and the atmosphere takes you away and makes you feel like you're in San Diego! I loved the salsa which is fresh and full of flavor and has a bit of a kick! I was pleasantly surprised to see the crab cakes looked and tasted made in house.  .. mmm! The crab cakes were very good quality full of crab without the fillers and perfectly crispy on both sides. I also had a Tuna salad and was pleased as it was delicious and satisfying! It's an amazing casual bar environment to watch the sunset!"}
{"text":"I met up with a couple of friends here for dinner on a beautiful Saturday evening. The place was pretty poppin' so I was surprised that we were able to get a table near the water. There's a disclaimer on their menu that the service is \"very relaxed\", but I would say that we were ignored for about 20 minutes before anyone came and gave us the time of day. After that, the service was pretty standard. I ordered the southwestern chicken sandwich with fries and I enjoyed my meal, everyone else seemed pretty \"meh\" about everything. 

This would be a great place to enjoy a few drinks and the music and the view, but I probably wouldn't pick it out for dinner again."}
{"text":"We have been to this place numerous times over the last year and a half and Every time there's an issue slow service slow on drinks or wrong items
And then there is \"oh I forgot the salsa\" or no utensils then the nerve they have to apply a 20%
Gratuity if you are going to apply that and some do I get it I agree with it but please give a service 
That represents 20% most likely will never go 
Back with a party the place is running on a shoe string budget and doesn't hide it well the service says it all"}
{"text":"I'm in love with this place. Excellent food and great service. Plus the atmosphere is unique and and the view is beautiful."}
{"text":"Plus.....live music and beautiful views in a great community!
Negatives....slow service and average food. 
We go for appetizers drinks and live music!"}
{"text":"Incredibly cool place....
Outstanding service!!!
ICE cold beer!!!
Incredible view as the sun sets!!!

{"text":"If you're looking for casual drinks on the patio, this is the right spot.  Great view of the water, which is really unique in the valley.  The bartenders were very friendly, but as the menu states pretty clearly, don't expect fast service.  There were two bartenders servicing the entire place so it seems like they plan on being understaffed.

The menu is pretty big, and they've given many of their dishes fun \"nautical\" names.  However, it's pretty standard fare, so don't expect anything very unique from your food.  I will definately be returning for drinks after I've eaten."}
{"text":"It was fun to sit on the patio and enjoy the lake.  The atmosphere is inviting and fun.  If you want to drink and have a good time, is is a good place to go.  If you go to eat, don't expect a lot.  I ordered the lamb kabobs with the grilled veggies.  The two kabobs were about six inches long with small chunks of lamb.  They were placed on the plate--no rice.  I asked for the grilled veggies for my side.  The veggies were sliced Brussels sprouts, broccoli and yellow squash.  I thought that was the strangest combination of \"grilled\" veggies especially to go with lamb.

My cousin ordered the mahi-mahi tacos ($11.95, I believe).  It happened to be Taco Tuesday, but we didn't know until later.  His three tacos were small street tacos with about a 2x1 inch piece of fish on each one.  There was some guacamole sauce in top.  No sides, nothing but three street tacos which he gulped down in less than five minutes.  When we got the bill, the had been charged $9.95--Taco Tuesday prices we surmised, but then we wondered if those were the normal tacos or if they were Taco Tuesday tacos.

Appetizers or burgers are probably good, but maybe ask questions (which we didn't do--who would have thought?)

I'll go back but with no expectations."}
{"text":"Dropped by for dinner recently with a couple friends who are vegetarian. Pier 54 doesn't have anything for vegetarians aside from salad and soup. There was pizza and grilled cheese on the kid's menu and we asked if they could make an adult size version of that since we were hungry for some heavy food but they don't do that. My vegetarian friends ordered the soup that was available for the day (tomato soup) and all of us gave it a taste and no one liked it much. I ordered the chicken skewers, hoping for a nice filling meal and I got two thin sticks of chicken with a side of fries. The fries on the side were not good either. I had checked out the pics on yelp before heading down there and it seemed much better than when we went there ourselves but maybe it was an off night. For dinner, it wasn't my favorite as none of us were very happy with our meals. The redeeming quality of the place was the drinks! The drinks were fabulous! If you're a fan of sweet cocktails, the Malibu Mai Tai and the White Gummy Bear are awesome! My conclusion would be that I would go to this place for drinks and maybe try it out for breakfast, but not for dinner and definitely not if you're a vegetarian. Seems to me that this place has its specialties that it makes really well and you may want to stick to if you go there. Might be best to ask the servers what they think Pier 54 makes really well and go for it because otherwise you may end up with something not so great."}
{"text":"The food here was basic and unappetizing from the lack of flavor and innovation in the dishes.  There isn't a whole lot going for the place except for the location but even then, the entire place lacks soul and life. Through out the entire meal, I kept wishing I was anywhere but here.  There is a lot of incredible restaurants in the valley, unfortunately this place isn't one."}
{"text":"This place is great! I used to live around the corner and would always crave their strawberry salad and french fries. Another winner for me is the grilled veggie sandwich. I also could never resist bringing friends there to have the s'mores kit. It's pretty nice being near water in Arizona while munching on some gooey marshmallow goodness. 

I live in San Francisco now and really miss this place. Definitely on my list of places to hit for good food on my next Tempe visit!"}
{"text":"This is a wonderful place to come for a relaxing evening by the water! I come here frequently and the staff always remembers my face! It has a very friendly and family oriented atmosphere! Very neat bar with great staff."}
{"text":"I live within walking distance of this bar and I want to love it so much, but unfortunately it's the opposite. We have been there two times. The first time we left because no one ever came to take our order. The second time, after asking two different servers, we did finally get to order a drink. It will be our last drink there, however.  The place is dirty, the service is very slow, and the staff is not responsive to the needs of their customers. This could be a really great place but unfortunately, it's not.  Such a bummer because we walk past there almost every night and would love to make it our regular bar."}
{"text":"Oh dear this whole area has seen better days. Food OK but slow. There is no indoor part so I imagine they are almost dead in the summer, They had very inadequate, dirty, rusty coolers that blew out luke warm air. You have to use public toilets which are pretty yucky. Cheap and kind of on the water but that is where it ends. In the restaurant they advertise you get $5 for writing a review, i won't hold my breath for that."}
{"text":"The spot is really cool looking, a bar nestled up against the lake tucked into a corner of a larger building. I stopped by with a couple friends to have a quick drink. After quite a bit of a struggle to get someone to take our order and get some drinks, we enjoyed the time on the patio and the seats were a little old but still comfortable. 
Once we got our drinks, we never saw our server again. Once we finished our drinks and were ready to leave, I wandered around trying to find someone to pay our tab with for nearly 10 minutes before abandoning hope, guessing the total of our order, leaving $20 on the table and walking out.
I couldn't believe it. I read some other reviews now for this place, and it seems like this is pretty commonplace type service here."}
{"text":"I have fun at this place because there is nothing on the water where you can actually enjoy dinner. Food is consistent ! Can't say amazing but very enjoyable. 

For me it's the view, sunset, and the band!  They pour big drinks which is always nice. Bathrooms are outside of the bar and DIRTY.... This is why I rated four stars.

Also hard to sit outside with so many smokers.  Overall a nice place to enjoy if you want to be outside."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  I originally came for the waterside setting, but it's the food that keeps me coming back. These people know how to work with spice and that's what takes it from ordinary to extraordinary. Lamb skewers, fish and chips or fish tacos and burgers; all seasoned to perfection. The flatbreads from 3 to 6 are incredible and the in-house smoked meats are to die for!  Brunch on the weekend has also been wonderful, with bottomless Bloody Mary or Mimosas.  The kitchen is not fast, but this is a place you come to relax and enjoy.  Service is always with a smile, Miles and Maddie are always excellent."}
{"text":"Really cute place perfect for a date! Over looking the lake, such a pretty view! Good menu with decent prices! I had the green chili burger and the warm crap dip to start. It seemed the night I went there was only 1-2 servers so we had to wait a very long time to get water, to order food, to ask to turn the heaters on (they also provide blankets because they are an outside only restaurant which I thought was pretty cool) other than the mediocre service everything else was great!"}
{"text":"Went here on a date because the location is awsome.  The bartender knows how to make a solid Manhattan and even asked for my preference in liquor.  The food on the other hand could use some improvements.  I ordered the grilled salmon ( one of the more expensive items on the menu) and it was a bit dry and very ordinary. The rice it was served with was also very bland. I could have made that same quality of food on my own easily.  

This place is awsome for having a few drinks by the lake with a date but I would eat before I go."}
{"text":"Read the reviews and see who's writing them. Interestingly, most of the people who love this place have only written 1 or 2 reviews. 

After a year, I've not seen any positive changes. The best thing about this place, the view. On a beautiful AZ day, relax and enjoy the weather and view.

The food generally isn't good. Quality is worse than bar food. How can you mess up french fries and grilled cheese sandwich? The garlic parmesan wings were drenched in butter with huge chunks of garlic. I couldn't stomach all that fat. It was like dipping chicken wing in lard. I guess if you're into that. I recommend eating somewhere else then come here for drinks and enjoy the view. Don't expect anything fancy. It's a dive bar/restaurant that happens to be on the lake.  

As for the service. The Asian guy is always working behind the bar. It's like I can't get a break. I don't know if he's always an a-hole or he's just overworked. I've seen him interact with other people and he has zero personality. Super unfriendly. Doesn't say hi or smile. Doesn't appreciate his customers. On my first visit, he never acknowledged us and it took 15-20 mins for him to ask us what we wanted to drink. Last weekend, when we asked if there were any specials, he said no. What about the brunch mimosas and bloody mary's? Like he doesn't have time for us. Complete tool.  

I think the best experience I've had here was last Valentine's Day. Even though they ran out of champagne around 1:30p. Keep in mind, they serve $8 mimosas with $1 refills for brunch until 3pm. I guess they did not account for the crowd and beautiful weather. It also took an hour to get our food. Luckily we were just chillin, enjoying the beautiful weather. One of the older couples never got their food and left. Sad. I had the traditional breakfast. It would have been good if it wasn't cold. But, it's not that hard to make eggs, bacon, and hash browns. The server was apologetic and made up for the mistakes. Bald guy, I think. I've not seen him before but he was actually the ONLY good server I've had there. Owning up to mistakes and making up for it goes a long way.

I keep coming back for the patio and the view....only when the weather is nice. I love outside bars with nice views. I think on Fridays or Saturdays, they have live music? This place isn't worth going when it's really cold or really hot. They don't have enough heaters to keep you warm and not enough fans to move the air around during the hottest days.

Oh yeah, when the sun moved behind the trees, we walked over to the Watershed. Better view of the lake. Better wine selections and much nice restaurant."}
{"text":"I've been a loyal patron for years and there is a reason why: this place rocks.  What a great escape and awesome outdoor bar.  Friday and Saturday nights are always a blast with live music.  Very chill vibe and the friendliest staff in town.  My only complaint is the eyesore restaurant across the way."}
{"text":"I was very excited to try this place when I first saw it. Great view of the lake and the fact that it's all outdoors is nice. Drinks were good and the food was decent. 
With that being said I asked to reserve a table for 10 people and was shown that we'd be sitting right by the lake in a quite corner. Got there for my 7:30 reservation and we literally had to use the flashlights on our phones to read the menu. Extremely dark and being so close to the water probably not very safe. 
We rarely saw our waitress who was either new or just didn't care much to help our table. 
My boyfriend being a vegetarian asked to order a pizza off the menu but was told because he wasn't a child we couldn't order it. He ended up just ordering fries but our waitress was not helpful at all and offered to bring him a hamburger bun with lettuce and condiments in a laughing tone. I wanted to ask for a to go box for my food but seeing as our waitress was nowhere to be found we just wanted to hurry and leave. 
To top it off we waited at least 20 minutes for her to bring us our bill after we asked for it and the restaurant automatically had a 20% tip included. I also work in the service industry so I understand the importance of tipping but our waitress did NOT deserve the amount of tip she got from my party of 10. 
I'm sure if you sit by the bar and don't expect much for service this place would be just fine. Like I said their drinks were good but the service was awful."}
{"text":"Had horrible experience at the pier. Their grill broke we waited 2 hours for our food which was cold. Owners were very inflexible I even offered to split the bill they refused. Very bad experience. Supervisor offered to comp. us but owners refused to deal with us. Very poor management. As a person who is a professional in Tempe for 30 years I urge people to not use this restaurant. I have been going to this restaurant for over. 20 years and give them a lot of business which will cease. Very poor."}
{"text":"Ordered Fish and chips and they only offer Aiaoli sauce for tartar sauce....way over done and that includes the fries...too spicy and very soggy!  They need to hire another cook to help the one cook out!!  

They ran out of appetizers and also the Summer Shandy.  For a weekend shouldnt stuff be in stock? Eslecially for us being there at 7 pm..."}
{"text":"Nice little bar on the lake in \"The Lakes\" subdivision. The night we went they had live entertainment (2 acoustic guitar players/singers). It kind of gives you the feeling of being somewhere else - not in the middle of the desert. 

The drinks were good. The food was good but, in my opinion, a little over priced. My wife had the Mahi Mahi  ceasar salad and I had the Mahi Mahi tacos with onion rings. I happen to like spicy foods so the tacos were good - However, If you do not like spicy hot, do not order these. The onion rings were good - they were fresh made and the breading was unique.

All in all, a nice evening - good food (although a little over priced), good drinks, top notch entertainment, and great ambience!"}
{"text":"Please for the love of all that is awesome in the world owners read these posts and make changes. First of all I love pier 54 because it is a gorgeous scenery and chill spot to have a drink. You guys have a PRIME location but your losing local customers like me and at least 10 of my friends because the food is god awful and your bar is starting to look trashy. I've been in the restaurant business my entire life and alllll you need to do is seriously update your menu , use good  fresh food , and spend a couple 1000$ to spruce up the place. Everything is torn and ragged and so sad to see it start to look so bad. I've returned my food there not once , not twice but 3 times and I don't ever return my food. My burger was burnt and dry , fries were so over seasoned I chocked , my spinach dip had a giant piece of plastic in it, and the salmon salad tasted like it was caught in the dirty lake. Lastly the water just the water tastes like I'm drinking directly from the lake . Please please please just make some changes I want to love this place so badly!!! I'll come help you if I need to !!! The owners deserve a steady stream of business but you gotta realize you need to make some changes !"}
{"text":"Whenever I think of a patio I want to be at on a beautiful AZ day, the first place that comes to mind is Pier 54.  If you are looking for a place to take your time, have some drinks, enjoy a 'man made' lake, with a local feel, then this is your place.  

As a bonus, their food is really good!  More to choose from than just 'bar food' and everything has a unique twist to it.  I hope to see some local ingredients and all natural/anti-biotic free type proteins in the future.

A couple times we received some pretty poor service, which is saying a lot since every time we go there with a 'no rush, take our time' mindset.  But mostly it is just fantastic all around!"}
{"text":"When we have family visiting from out of town we always take them to Pier 54. The view is amazing and it makes you forget you're in the middle of the desert. The beer selection is basic domestics with a few craft beers. Servers can get overwhelmed when it gets busy because it never seems like there's enough staff. If you come here, try the crab dip, it's amazing."}
{"text":"IMHO, Tempe's best kept secret. I visit Pier 54 as often as I can -- and while the food isn't amazing (it actually used to be MUCH better, with some delish pastas), it's good bar food (great salads)... but let's be real. It's all about the view. Tucked away so no one knows it's there, friendly, relaxed service (and yeah, I mean slow service, but it's part of the charm of it -- come here, hang out, talk, spend time with your loved ones and snack a bit). I love going there and will keep coming back!"}
{"text":"A great local date night spot on the water, at the Lakes in Tempe.
This bar is mainly patio style, some area's are covered by sails while others are open air. 
 Great beer on tap including Kronenborg 1664! My second favorite beer! Food is okay, try the pecan and brie quesadilla and the daily soup! Service is normally quite good and they also feature great local musicians on the weekends, like Walt Richardson.  If you live on the lake, you can even dock your boat here! How cool is that?

There are new tables right down on the waters edge for that romantic date!

Give this place a try, you'll love it!"}
{"text":"Nice place to go on a date and have a few drinks hang out by the lake and listen to music"}
{"text":"Wonderful outdoor spot on the water. Miles, our waiter was excellent! Reasonably priced and delicious. Had the special encrusted pork chops. Yum.

They have a small kitchen, so be patient and relax with cold one.  Will be are favorite goto spot now."}
{"text":"Food was delicious but took a while to come out.  View was beautiful but seating area is limited. Staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Bartender had zero personality. Tried to order a grilled cheese, he said sorry, can't do. It's on the kids menu. Anyone with good restaurant business knows....your menu should be viewed as an ingredient list....up charge for the grilled cheese, fine. Never tell customer NO. Very unfortunate for a great location."}
{"text":"Horrible service, the waitress did not know the menu and misrepresented which sides came with melas and didn't even offer to fix the mistake. We waited an hour for cold food, incorrect sides, and rude service. I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"What to say what to say. Man I love this place! Amazing staff! Especially Maddie, I came for drinks once and received fantastic service from her and the next time which was a couple weeks later she knew who I was and what I wanted to drink! Incredible. Not only was Maddie's service and personality outstanding and welcoming the food and drinks were phenomenal. I highly recommend this perfect lakeside spot to anybody! Ask for Maddie."}
{"text":"I celebrated my birthday with several friends here, we all enjoyed the food & atmosphere, the service was great, the manager made sure we had enough chairs & tables & a server for our group. This is a great place to meet with friends & enjoy the outdoors & happy hour,"}
