{"text":"I used to be a regular at this place for many years but not anymore..
Customer service doesn't exist anymore .. New young girls don't want to move from their chair and just point with their fingers on where to look for stuff  .. I was the only customer in the store and there were like 4 employees and non of them helped me finding what I was looking for ... I'm taking my business elsewhere .. There are a lot of gourmet stores in Montreal and with this attitude they will not stay in business for long .. Too sad"}
{"text":"Un des meilleurs choix en épicerie fine à Montréal anciennement van houtte.personnel compétent et prêt à vous aider.on trouve de tout..."}
{"text":"Super épicerie! On y trouve toute sorte de choses, toute sorte de spécialité, des produits qu'on ne trouve pas dans les grandes épiceries. Je vais illustrer mon propos d'exemples: des biscottes ou encore du pain Azyme! Non, j'ai toujours eu du mal à trouver ailleurs. 
Belle découverte!"}
{"text":"Impressionnante sélection de produits importés de France. On y trouve aussi des produits réfrigérés, plats préparés, et les comptoirs à charcuteries, fromages et café (avec service). Un  peu cher par contre"}
{"text":"Great place to find european products, I found there the Speculoos! Great location, prices are not great but are not very high either, so in general are ok for being imported products. The attention from the cashier excellent. 

The only thing I didn't like (where they lost my 5th star) was that I felt being followed by the manager and not in the \"can I help you way\" but in the \"what are you doing\" way."}
{"text":"Great spot just across the street from LeMeac.  Fantastic coffee selection including recently roasted Blue Mountain and a number of local providers, a huge chocolate selection including many of the best hard to find artisan brands, a diverse collection of coffee grinders and brewing mechanisms from Siphon to Chemex to French Press, and a helpful staff more than capable of discussing the virtues of their various sources of maple syrup, vinegar, olive oil, meats, and cheeses.  Prices are high end, but worth it."}
