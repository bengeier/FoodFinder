{"text":"Excellent food, but unfortunately during my last visit I had the worst service and restaurant experience of my life! For that reason I can't return and recommend that restaurant ever again. We shouldn't support businesses like that."}
{"text":"Excellent food and cute spot but AWFUL experience. They do not know what customer service is. We've been to many restaurants in different countries and never experienced a service like this before.
Unfortunately, I have to say the owner was aggressive and we were kicked out of the restaurant for some reasons that I'm still trying to understand."}
{"text":"Delicious! Perfect from start to finish and great service. Will definitely be back soon. Felt like being in Italy."}
{"text":"What a fantastic restaurant ! Simple and clean in design, warm and welcoming staff.
We had an amazing lobster salad and a perfectly cooked Branzino for the main course. The place was very busy but he staff was extremely attentive and took pains to make sure we were not neglected.
The menu is small because the food is seasonal and very artisanal . The wine list is very complete and we had lovely Sancerre that complemented our meal perfectly.
I would recommend reservations .
Can't wait for my next trip to Montreal for a return to Trattoria Luciano ."}
{"text":"Vraiment un restaurant délicieux. Les raviolis aux champignons sont exceptionnels. A ce prix-la, j'ai juste été un peu déçue par la taille de l'entree mais l'ensemble du repas était vraiment excellent. Le staff est adorable et attentif !"}
{"text":"Great food, TERRIBLE service. So bad that the hot head owner and his family communally lost their cool and kicked my family and our friends out for reasons that are still a mystery to most of us. At least i'll never forget my 36th birthday!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Unpretentious, inviting and most importantly delicious!! A couple of reviews said service isn't good. That just doesn't make sense. We have always loved the service. This family run restaurant is warm and inviting. I"}
{"text":"Italian food is a major weakness of mine but as someone who is half Italian I might be a little biased on this subject.  Needless to say I get excited when I hear about new Italian restaurants opening up.  Enter Luciano Trattoria in Petite Patrie which is serving up classic Italian food.  It's a small restaurant so definitely reserve because it was packed to capacity on the night I came.  If you are just two you can also consider sitting at the bar.  The space is very welcoming and features an open kitchen so you can see the owner and chef Luciano D'Orazio cooking up magic in the kitchen.  Pricewise it is what you would expect for a restaurant in Petite Patrie

The restaurant has a small, focused menu which is generally the way I like things to be done.  I've said it before and I will say it again that it is best to focus on doing a few things well then trying to serve up everything and winding up serving only average food.  They have a few pasta dishes and one meat and one fish dish.  Now I must admit I do wish that they had one or two more meat and fish dishes but you still have a good selection of dishes to choose from.

I started with polpette which I'm pretty sure were made of veal and garnished with padano.  They very juicy and tender and covered with just the right amount of sauce.  That was followed by pappardelle with braised rabbit and shitaki mushrooms.  This for me was the highlight of the night.  They served the pasta slightly al dente which is how I like it and since the rabbit had been braised it just fell apart.  They also didn't try to cheat and make the dish mostly pasta.  The serving of meat and mushrooms was quite generous.  Dessert was a Nutella ricotta tart which was well balanced in flavour.  You could taste the ricotta layer without the Nutella overpowering everything.  The portion size was always just right for everything.  I always felt like I had enough to eat without feeling like I had gone overboard.

Be warned that the bread here is wildly addictive.  They drizzle it with olive oil and toast it before sprinkling salt on it.  Normally the bread is such a minor detail of a restaurant meal but here it is so good you could almost just eat that for the whole meal.  If you are not careful you will fill up on bread leaving no room for the other amazing food that you will eat.  Let's just say that it boded well for me that I was absolutely starving when I came because I did enjoy that bread quite a bit.

The waiters do a great job here of paying attention to the customers.  I don't think I saw them stop moving once until the end of the meal when the restaurant was starting to empty out.  They were constantly topping up empty glasses, bringing out plates and checking in on diners to make sure they were well taken care of.

It does get a little noisy in the dining room and I wasn't crazy about that.  I'm not a fan of having to scream at dining companions when I eat out.  I have definitely experienced worse though.  On a whole this restaurant is an awesome addition to the neighbourhood and definitely worth the visit."}
{"text":"I've always liked this place, enough so that I've returned 4 or 5 times and I've converted a few friends into Luciano followers.  Some can't miss: the grilled octopus is heavenly and the butter-sage pasta.

You will not be disappointed in the quality of the food and the ingredients.  The prices are a little high but you get a high-end food experience.  The place can get noisy and the kitchen is an open-area on the dining room, thus you will smell like an italian kitchen when walking out.

Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Service is #1 at this family owned restaurant. The staff are very friendly and entertaining, being very attentive to your needs. Our waiter even took the time to  translate all the menu items and give detailed descriptions. For food, the complimentary bread is delicious. The one-page menu has a wealth of appetizing choices to choose from. I personally ordered the salami and cheese board to start. It's definitely a good sharing dish in combination with the bread. My entree was the spaghetti cacio e pepe. It's a spaghetti pasta covered in a melted pecorino sauce topped with lots of fresh cracked pepper. The nature of the cheese makes it veer on the salty side, but not overwhelmingly so. All in all, we had a great meal and I would recommend this place wholeheartedly!"}
{"text":"Tout simplement MAGNIFIQUE!!!! C'est lorsque je visite ce genre d'établissement que je me rend compte à quel point Montréal est la capitale gastronomique en Amérique du Nord!!!

Le menu offert est fort simple et sans ribambelle! On mise sur la qualité des ingrédients et non la quantité......et on aime ça! Au choix: Entrées, pâtes et deux choix de viandes/poissons.....aucune pizza proposée.

Nous avons opté pour les boulettes sauce tomate-padano ainsi que la salade du chef comme entrées, les raviolis 5 champignons et les rigatonis all'amatriciana comme plats de résistance. Le tout était très savoureux et les saveurs étaitent bien exploitées. Le sel n'était pas mis de l'avant comme le font plusieurs restos italiens.

Pour ce qui est du service, le tout fut impeccable. Le jeune serveur attitré à notre table était très courtois et chaleureux sans prétendre tout connaître! Nous lui avons poser des questions sur la sélection des vins et il a prit la peine de demander au gérant de nous recommander une bouteille qui répondait à nos goûts! Très belle initiative au lieu de nous baratiner n'importe quoi!!!

Le seul hic.....plus de pain en milieu de repas....mais bon c'est pas la fin du monde!"}
{"text":"Wow! If you want a real taste of Italia, this place is key! Felt like back at home. Real authentic taste and will be coming back for sure. A must try! Go for it!"}
{"text":"Tout est parfait , Les gnocchis sont a la hauteur de leur réputation, Luciano fait les meilleurs gnocchis , ils fondent en bouche, avec une simple sauce tomatées, les raviolis aux champignons sont exquis ! Les portions semblent petites au premier regard, mais en terminant, on a bien mangé. La déco est simpliste, mais très jolie, Luciano aime venir jaser avec les clients, il est très humble ! :)"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to go to this restaurant since it's opening in 2015. This restaurant exceeded all my expectations and then some!!! I could write a novel on how my evening was marvellous and how the food was out of this world delicious!!! It's an open kitchen concept and you can see Chef Luciano and staff working their magic. For me, i felt like i was invited to an Italian family diner and i was the guest of honour lol! 

The owner, Luciano and the maître d' Angelo (also Sommelier) along with the staff, were so attentive to our needs that it made all the difference between a good night and a GREAT night. Just one example of so many: Our waiter opened a bottle of white wine for my friend. Smelled it and wasn't sure about it. Instead of just trying to pass it on to her, he asked Angelo for his opinion. She ended up with another white wine suggested by Angelo and was very pleased with it! 

The menu is short and simple so you can imagine that the ingredients must be top notch! They offer some fantastic grilled bread doused with olive oil and tiny olives while we waited for our food. We opted for the charcuterie platter and the grilled octopus. Both were very good but my octopus was perfectly executed. Tender, sweet grilled to a perfect crisp. Then my husband opted for the tagliatelle porcini and i opted for the branzino (sea bass). The tagliatelle was cooked al-dente just as it should and i regretted not ordering a pasta dish. It was creamy without the cream and so full of flavour because of the caramelized onions and the veal jus. But when i tasted my fish, i was glad i had ordered it! Seared perfectly, it came with grilled vegetables and a tangy herb vinaigrette. We were so full that i was \"sad\" that i couldn't try their desserts. 

From start to finish, this night at Luciano is probably one of my best restaurant experience ever! There isn't one single bad thing to write or say about this place and the staff. It took us a little more then an hour to get to this restaurant. I would do it everyday!"}
{"text":"I am visiting Montreal for the first time, and somehow happened upon this restaurant.  I can honestly say, I have never had better Italian food anywhere in the world.  Each course was completely mind-blowing. 

But, as great as the food was, the family who runs the restaurant stole the show.  They are completely charming.  The restaurant's namesake Chef Luciano d'Orazio and his wife and two teenage sons all work at the restaurant.  To say that this is an entertaining group would be an understatement.  By the time we left, we were sad to go. The warm reception we received from all of the staff at this restaurant was beyond any experience I've ever had.  

TIPS:  

1) Make a reservation, we didn't have one-but it was clear we probably needed one. 
2) Alessandro, one of the sons recommended the Papardelle coniglio.  It was incredible. I will likely be dreaming of this pasta forever. 
3) Do not try to choose a dessert, order them all.  You'll thank me. 

If I lived within two hours of this restaurant, I would dine here weekly.  This was truly the best dining experience I've had in my 38 years."}
