{"text":"Sweet Cocoa has an amazing reputation for making the most scrumptious of treats while somehow managing to make them look like they belong in a best dressed pageant! I made an order for 30 cupcakes and right away it was processed and preparation was under way! Throughout the process, I was kept in the loop of how they were being made and through that I could clearly see just how much time and effort was put into my order. When I received my cupcakes I was thrilled at how they turned out! They were beautifully made and looked too good to eat. I am glad however that I ate them because they were absolutely delicious! Taruna is a very skilled baker and has a fine penchant for delivering high quality baked goodies, to whoever has the good fortune of ordering from Sweet Cocoa. 10/10 would order again and 10/10 would be 100% satisfied!"}
{"text":"Taruna of Sweet Cocoa made an amazing cake for a special person in my life :)) i had an idea and design that we discussed and agreed on...she made the cake exactly as i wanted it.. she also gave me updates on thr progress during the week...the cake was delicious and both of us really enjoyed it... my friend took the leftovers to his work (the cake had his detailed work logo on it) and they were blown away with the quality.. it was eaten up in a matter of minutes... thanks for the great job... we'll definitely be contacting you again when we need cupcakes, cakes, etc made :)"}
{"text":"It is as good as it gets! I've had it many times and I keep coming back for more. Keep'em coming, Sweet Cocoa! we can't get enough. P.S.: the presentation is always amazing, very original and artistic."}
{"text":"We messaged the owner before coming to Canada and she answered us very quickly, the cake was adorable!"}
{"text":"I wanted a special and customized cake for my mother's 50th birthday and sweet cocoa made it possible for me in every single manner! Not only the design was customized but the flavor was also customized! And the fact that everything is made from scratch (including the jam!) makes it very delicious! Everyone at the party was very happy with the cake and I can't wait to get another one already!"}
