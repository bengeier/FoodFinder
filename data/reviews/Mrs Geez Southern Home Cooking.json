{"text":"Is this place still around? We were there once last Spring.  It was ok.  We returned one night a few months later, and vowed to never return.  We ordered crab cakes and they were the absolute worst!  To top it off, the place had a musty odor."}
{"text":"I tried the Sunday Brunch (complete with a great band!) on 7/25/2010. It was a buffet (Sever fixed your plate) that consisted of Southern favorites such as: catfish, fried chicken wings, meatloaf (meatloaf is PRETTY GOOD BUT ONLY SERVED ON SUNDAY!!), mac&cheese, yams, greens and corn bread.This was a test run. I wanted to invite members of our dining club the upcoming Friday. Our dinner club, called The Yacht Club, dined here on a Friday evening (7/30/2010). We had a reservation for 15 and our tables were ready when we arrived(NICE!!). The staff are very friendly and welcoming. The decor is on point. I love the bold color choice and the pictures of musical icons and symbols on the walls. Live music starts at 9pm on Fridays. The band for the evening, BLOCK PARTY, was great! The food here is pretty decent!  We loved the fried shrimp appetizer(GREAT!!) and also the appetizer platter( TASTE GREAT & VERY FILLING-came with hot wings, catfish, chicken fingers, mozzarella sticks  and egg rolls that where stuffed with some flavorful mixture!) All meals are served with 2 sides. To my surprise CORNBREAD IS CONSIDERED a SIDE!!$2.50 a piece!!! I feel cornbread should be complimentary at a soul food/southern cooking restaurant. Any other classy establishment gives you a basket of bread!! NONE OF US 15 PEOPLE LIKED THE CORNBREAD any way! (it taste like a spice cake with sage in it! I wish they would give you a choice between a  traditional recipe and their recipe!)    We also tried the smothered chicken(the chicken is good but DOES NOT COME WITH RICE, YOU HAVE TO ORDER SAFFRON RICE ON THE SIDE AS WHITE RICE IS NOT ON THE MENU!), fried pork chops(FRIED TOO HARD FOR THEIR THIN CUT, fried chicken wings (NOT ENOUGH BATTER but good), catfish(GREAT!), short ribs(GOOD), Mac & cheese (GOOD- taste way better than it looked),  candied yams (taste like they looked ...GROSS!), collard greens(GREA!T), dressing and gravy(GREAT!!), sweat potato fries(GREAT!!). ALISON F., GIRL I am really feeling you on the sweet tea and cornbread thing!!!!   I will go back!  I LOVE the Live Bands!I will smuggle in my own sweet tea and cornbread!!!  LOL J/K"}
{"text":"Best in Vegas love the chicken and waffles we'll be there on the reg And they treat their customers right"}
{"text":"we went here for lunch...first off, what soul food/southern home cooking restaurant does NOT have sweet tea??? oh, i know...Mrs Geez...so we get our menus, a notebook with a 3 rings inside with some computer printed paper inside plastic sheet protectors...MANY misspelled words on the menu...hmm??? ok...we can pass that up too...so we order our food, i ordered the chicken wings with mac & cheese & the dressing and my friend orders the smothered chicken with the dressing & cornbread...now we were a little irritated that they just dont give you cornbread at your table like MOST restaurants that serve it do, but OK whatever, waiter comes back, im sorry we dont have any cornbread...ok...so he orders the carrots instead...food comes to the table...they were very good sized portions, but the chicken wings have hardly any breading, and the gravy on the smothered chicken has no flavor, tastes like cornstarch & water...all-in-all we were VERY disappointed...service was not very good considering there was only 1 other table seated while we were there...needless to say we will not be back...sorry Mrs Geez"}
