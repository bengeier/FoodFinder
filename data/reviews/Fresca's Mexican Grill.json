{"text":"Really good fresh Mexican food, love the Tacos, Quesadilla, and Burritos and staff is friendly. A must have if your looking for fresh, healthy food (besides Subway)."}
{"text":"Bland food. Got the #7 platter which is a fish taco and a mini burrito. The fish taco had no flavor and the mini burrito was sub par. The iced tea is from a machine and tasted awful! I poured it out and got the instant lemonade instead."}
{"text":"While driving south on the 17, my wife and I saw the Anthem Outlet billboard saying, \"Avacado chicken salad $5.00 at Frescas\". Wifey says, \"hey, that sounds good. Let's stop!\" Big mistake. She orders the salad, I order 2 fish tacos. What could be easier? We order. We wait, and wait, and wait. 1 cook. 1 order taker. 1 manager, standing there in his old faded Levi's, doing nothing... When our order finally is up, there is only one taco. Order taker says, \"I thought you only ordered one\". Hmm, I don't think so. When I pull out my receipt, she's right. But I realize I was charged $7.00 instead of $5.00 for the salad. Order taker says, \"I'll order you another taco. It will only take 5 minutes.\" I say sure. After eating my 1 taco I'm thinking this is the worst fish taco I have EVER had. Do I really want another one? I reluctantly wait outside for taco #2 for 15 minutes and then approach the order taker and ask how much longer? They say \"Oh he hasn't started it yet. After you walked outside, a bunch of other people came and ordered stuff so he made their food instead of yours. Alrighty then. I guess I'll be on my way. Life's too short. Don't settle for bad food or bad service. PS. Wifey hated her salad. We continued home and had some nachos and a beer."}
{"text":"Horrible!  I asked if they had nachos, she told me she could give me a bag a chips and I could get some cheese whiz from Charley's subs!   Say what!??  WTH cheese do you use for the tacos?? Then when my 12 yr old ordered a kid meal she laughed and said \" that will never be enough food\" not everyone needs to eat 2 tons of food!  Seriously, just avoid this place!!!"}
{"text":"The worst. They didn't provide us dressing or guacamole for salad. The food was bland and the dressing was very watery and flavorless. Avoid this place. The employees were all lazy and unwilling to help, even after they forgot so many things. The pico tasted like it was made a week earlier and the tortilla on my burrito crumbled and oozed liquids as I ate. I should have eaten the crappy Chinese food next door. Even that would have been a huge improvement."}
{"text":"my son had the steak fajitas. they smelled horrible, really. the steak was crumbly and in bits, like ground beef. he absolutely loves mexican food and will eat basically any food you put in front of him, so one bite of the fajita he refused to eat any more and pushed his tray to the other side of the table. that's how bad it was."}
{"text":"So I eat at frescas alot and the food there is pretty good. It has really stepped it's game up. I will admit if you keep the food out for to long it's cold and gross but if it's fresh it's very good"}
{"text":"I have been craving quesadillas lately and good Mexican food is hard to find. I decided to try Fresca's. I have been here twice and ordered the quesadilla both times. It was great! I was really surprised since most places don't put a lot of work in making them. It was perfect both times which I appreciate. The price isn't bad, I paid around $7.50 for a chicken quesadilla. I will continue to order from Fresca's"}
{"text":"I just visited the Anthem Outlets location. They changed the menu and no longer carry what my family and I order from there. The build your own burrito is very plain. I can make that at home. I asked for no sour cream and got it anyway. You no longer offer the killer B burrito which had guacamole.   The taquitos no longer available either.   We will be going to other local mexican restaurants or I will just cook the same options at home.   I don't like this Chipotle style you have moved to. Disappointed."}
{"text":"Bland, utterly flavorless. I wish I went to subway. Oooohhh, their receipt was printed on their paper, too. I think dog food is better."}
{"text":"We are loyal Anthem residents and I feel a duty to let you know this food is so...so gross. I don't want to say it's flavorless, because the chicken taco I had suspiciously tasted like cleaning chemicals, ala 409.  The \"salsa\" is like some mushed up canned tomatoes with no spice or salt added. It's bad. Stay away."}
{"text":"I had the two steak taco combo--Yuck: The black beans were more like a soup. The \"steak\" was low quality and had the consistency of ground beef. (The rice and chips were fair).   The employee at the counter wasn't friendly. When I said thank you, his reply was \"yup\".   I wish I paid attention to the other reviews. Fresca's needs better quality meat and the food to be prepared with more care. For $7.25, it's a terrible value."}
{"text":"Located in the food court at the Anthem Outlets.  It was one of the more appealing and healthier looking options at the food court.  The food is fairly quick, cheap and convenient.  I had a shrimp taco for $2.95.  All sides are extra; chips & salsa, rice, beans, sour cream, guacamole, etc.  The shrimp taco is served on a small flour tortilla.  It's funny how they considered the shrimp to be \"jumbo\", there were maybe 4 little shrimps in it.  I would never have guessed it was served with pineapple salsa because it didn't taste anything like pineapple."}
{"text":"While any claim that the food is authentic (or good) may be overstated, I still consider it the best option in the food court. Don't expect any flavor and you won't be disappointed. 3 cups of \"hot\" salsa could not bring any bite to my burrito. If you want fried food, don't eat here- the tostadas are downright bad."}
{"text":"Shrimp taco was ok but they poured salsa on top and it was VERY soggy!! Flavor was good, texture not so much. Tacos Al Carbon was AWFUL!!!  Expected steak (Carne Asada) tasted like GREASY ground beef!! Salsa had NO flavor and NO spice! Tasted like tomato sauce....I'd take Taco Bell over this place ANY DAY!!!"}
{"text":"Wish I could give NO stars! Wow, I am truly shocked how terrible this food was. The worst fast food of my life, literally. My portion was skimpy, less than 2oz of steak fajita, burnt to a crisp and so oily I had to throw it out! The elderly couple across from me was appalled by the sorry excuse of a taco plate they received. Small handful of lettuce scraps with little else on top. TheY were also shaking their heads in disbelief at their plates. What a rip-off! Cannot believe I paid $10 to throw in the garbage, literally. They should close this shop. It's thievery. Not even exaggerating. Boycott this place."}
