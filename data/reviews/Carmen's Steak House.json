{"text":"I went here on a date with my boyfriend, and we couldn't be happier with the service, the ambiance, and the quality of the food. Of course it's pricey, but you get what you pay for. Their wine selection is incredible as well."}
{"text":"I was soooo disappointed! I loved the Origional Carmens - the food, the atmosphere, the service - were all top notch. Sadly not anymore. Food was mediocre at best, staff were kind but unprofessional. We would have been better off going to The Keg. Unfortunately - Carmens is no more....

To be more specific as per the managers request - the steak was terrible. You can on all you want about he quality , but it was awful. The best part (or worst depending on how you look at it) - was when the table across from us barfed all over their booth - and then ran out. Now - I know you can't blame the restaurant for that - but the open , very loud scene / argument that ensued between the staff - as to who was or wasn't going to clean it up. Well that just topped everything off. 

Hope the additional feedback was helpful"}
{"text":"Tried the tasting menu during thanks giving days with my long time no see friends. I was impressed by not only the taste but also the creativity behind each dish from which I can find the time and efforts the chef has put in. It's unique, a combination of great taste and visual presentation, and I call it art. My friend was quite satisfied and surprised since she never thought she could get close to such an experience if I didn't bring her there. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Summerlicious. The steak tartare was good .... The 10 oz sirloin was perfect. The dark chocolate cake was delicious. The minus 1 point was for the service. Our server was ignoring us and did not even ask us how the steak was ... We had to ask other servers for stuff... Also when it came to paying the bill...He gave me the machine, insert the card and left without saying anything...Left us with the machine ...The younger servers was great...So I felt like it happened due to racism. (He was asking other people how their meals were) Therefore I minus 1 more point.. Because I left with a feeling of being unserved..."}
{"text":"Me and my wife had a wonderful dinner here!  Food was well presented and sophisticated! Excellent service.  Their long standing reputation is well earned and they didn't disappoint"}
{"text":"We wanted to grab a good meal without battling the crowds on Friday night and this place delivered. They recently reopened we found out while dining that's probably why they are ranked the 17th best steakhouse in Toronto. I have eaten in many high end steakhouses over the years and these guys rank in the top 10.  James our server was excellent. The steaks were cooked to perfection.  I would recommend they serve fresh bread with an olive oil n spread or even butter instead of the bought garlic bread. Was bummed when we took the lava cake back to the hotel and it was upside down in the awesome to go box and they forgot the ice cream! Oh well that cost them a star otherwise great experience."}
{"text":"Tried Carman after my friend recommended it. I just loved my experience! Service is wonderful. The black cod I had is just a dream come true!"}
{"text":"Wow! First thing I'd have to mention is the beautiful building. The interior is done an old tudor style and lit with a wood burning fireplace - very cozy!
The staff was friendly and really knew the menu, ordering was a breeze.
The food earned five stars as well. I really enjoyed the cod dish and my boyfriend raved about his tenderloin all the way home!
If I had to correct one thing I'd play more modern music, bit because that's more of a preference thing I won't dock this restaurant a star. 
10/10 would return."}
{"text":"Excellent food and exceptional service. Great experience with my family. The lobster was amazing! Better than my past experiences with The David Duncan House (which i love as well). Our server Robel was funny and professional. Thanks to the chef's and Robel for a memorable evening. A great first impression!"}
{"text":"Took family to try the summerlicious menu.  My teenage daughter said it has a very relaxing ambiance.  As for the food, one of the best summerlicious/winterlicious meals to date.  To start, we had the escargot while my daughter had the steak tartar.  Both better than expected.  The escargot with parlsey cream and puff was very tasty and the puff made to perfection.  For mains, we had the black cod with miso and striplion.  Again, both were excellent.  The cod camewith a risotto base which was delicious. All three of us had the chocolate mousse.  Nice :)  Definitely would return."}
{"text":"TLDR; Winterlicious 2017, quiet and dim restaurant with good food overall. Caveat, I went here but didn't order steak so take my review with a grain of salt.

Steak tartare - good but could have used one or two more pieces of crostini. Small portion half the size of a small tuna can

Wild mushroom risotto - creamy but not mushy, lots of mushrooms. Good sized portion. I was stuffed.

Creme brulee - different from other creme brulees I've had. The top is caramelized and hard, but one you break it, the inside is quite liquidy. It kind of reminded me of a molten cheese tart, but it wasn't warm. It was good, but not what I expected.

New York style cheesecake with blueberry compote  - I split the desserts with my friend so we could try both. This is a plain baked cheesecake with blueberry sauce drizzled on top. Solid cheesecake, no complaints.

Started the meal with complementary garlic bread (warm and so good), cottage cheese, pickles and olives. Overall, not a bad meal although service was a bit slow sometimes even though there were only a  handful of tables filled when we were there. They also have coat check but the hostess was MIA so we just took our coats and left... Not the most secure coat check."}
{"text":"I've heard a lot about this restaurant since they have 50 years old history. The place was very decent when I first stepped in. I felt something not right when I sat down. A mid forty Chinese man with poor English was serving  us while a young Chinese lady was serving another table. I'm wondering is that a Chinese restaurant or a western steak house ?! The waitresses didn't have unified uniform. I expected the services and the atmosphere should be similar or better than The Keg, Buca, cafe Boulud, Joso, and etc. since they have 4 and half stars in Yelp. I kept persuading myself that the food must be good even they didn't have professional services. The price is not cheap when I went throw the menu. The tiger shrimp cocktail was $38?!!! My friend and I ordered the scallop, shrimp cocktail and foie gras. And lobster & rib eye for our main dishes. The scallop and foie gras were fine, very normal compared with other restaurants where I went to. I was shock when I tasted the shrimp cocktail. I don't understand why they charged so high for four shrimp and tasted worse than the one I bought from Costco ( maybe I expect too high for this restaurant). Forget about the appetizer. The funny thing was they served my friend black cod instead of lobster. Yea, the \"waiter\" placed the wrong order. My rid eye was tasteless!!!! I didn't expect they could made my steak like Cafe Boulud or Jacob, but please, at least better than the keg !!!! I  was so disappointed!!!!!! Oh and the wine was awful too. The restaurant is not very big. Only two table Canadian, and the rest (5-6) were all Chinese ( Asian ). It's not about the discrimination. It was something not right. I asked the \"waiter\" is the restaurant Chinese own ?? He didn't answer my question but he said oh, we have Chinese chef, and Canadian chef. One last thing was, we asked the bill, the \"waiter\" brought out the machine without cleaning up our table!!!! My half of the steak still on the table !!!!!!!! I really don't wanna waste my room to finish that. At the end I find out, they used to have very good food since they reopened last year winter and owned by a Chinese people. If the quality of the food (everything) is good. I don't care where they from. I don't think they deserve 4.5 star! It just misleading ppl going there !!!!!tt"}
{"text":"I've made it my mission to try every restaurant with my name, so I was pretty excited to see the restaurant participating in Winterlicious. 

Unfortunately it seems I just got unlucky with my first (and final) visit here... After they cleared our table of the entrees and sides, we were completely ignored for the next 20-30 minutes before a manager came by to sweep crumbs off the tabletop and hinted that we should ask for the bill. 

It's obvious they forgot to serve our dessert because they cleared our entrees as soon as we set our forks down, but never set the dessert utensils until we mentioned we were still waiting. I mean, I get that Winterlicious = smaller portions and less expensive cuts but I didn't actually expect the quality of service to drop along with it. 

Oh we did eventually get our dessert. The chocolate tart was too hard to cut with a knife so they offered to warm it up (aka microwave) it, which turned the mousse into a giant goopy mess. Wish I took a picture but it looked so gross I didn't bother...

With that said I did enjoy the food despite the poor service, but personally would not care to return for the regular or LiciousTO menu as it was really nothing special. I've actually had better experiences at The Keg or even Baton Rouge... At the very least I can say I've finally crossed this place off my \"Carmen Restaurants\" List."}
{"text":"I had high expectations for this place since the review was so high and the chef was granted with Michelin 1 star. But it was all a miss from the food to the atmosphere, although our main server was trying his best with the heat wave, since the A/C had malfunction so we were eating in a sauna room. The steak was overly seasoned, the plating was dull, and the sautéed veggie was just a big mess, some undercook others were over. Nothing came out right from the moment we sat down. The only reason I am giving this place a 1 star review is for our server."}
{"text":"Just had dinner  there and the service  was outstanding and  the  food was delicious!  Our server  was  Frank. He was funny, sweet  and charming!  Told us that what we ordered  was sufficient. The owner  came over twice  to chat us up and  make sure  we were happy. The menu was surprisingly  not a la carte! Our steak came with a small salad, 2 side veggies for the table and a side  of choice  potato each. Great time,  10 stars  if I could!  :)"}
{"text":"Under-rated generally. They have an excellent patio and a lovely interior in an antique style.  This is a classic steakhouse. They have the steak to match too. No idea why this place is often sparsely populated."}
{"text":"Dedicating my second review on Yelp to Carmen's. I don't usually write reviews, since I don't often go back to the same restaurant more than twice since I always prefer to try new things. But, Carmen's is different. It was more than just an ordinary dining experience, which is why I have been back three times already and am planning my fourth visit. The interior and the atmosphere are absolutely second to none. I am a foodie and I've been to all kinds of restaurants but Carmen's was the only one that I'd spend time browsing after my delicious meal. The food is definitely a five star and you wouldn't be able to find similar dishes elsewhere. A couple of my personal favorites are: The Miso Black Cod, The Seared Scallops, Steak Tartare, Beef Carpaccio, and Roasted Tomatoes & Black Cod Soup. The steak is always right on point, I get what I ask for. Very juicy and tender, good cut. The always freshly toasted Garlic bread, my oh my, LOVE the garlic bread, and the dipping sauces and pickles that comes with it, and of course, the free refills. I'd be down buying their garlic bread and bring them home with me. Last but not least, the dessert. I have a major sweet tooth and a occasional baker, and usually desserts at steakhouses are very generic. Always too sweet, and I could never finish them off. But the dessert at Carmen's, literally blown my mind. COCONUT CRÈME BRULEE!! Perfectly torched, not too sweet with the taste of coconut, and topped off with egg cookie, Vietnam coffee powder, and almond (yes, I loved this dish so much that I had to find out what it had). So... if you're someone like me, who is always down to try new and different dishes, definitely try out Carmen's. And definitely go for the tasting menu, it's nice to treat yourself to something a little fancy once in a while."}
{"text":"Came here for their winterlicious dinner menu on a Friday night. I booked online through their website and called the day of to let them know I might be 10 min late cuz of traffic. When I called the worker said she couldn't find my booking but said she can reserve one for me right now (so call to confirm your booking just in case)

The dinner came with appetizer, main and a dessert. For the appetizer we both got the beef tar tar, which was really goood. The main was obviously a steak. I asked for medium rare and it was cooked perfectly. 

The dessert was my favourite part. Their pana cotta was very delicious! And my girlfriends blueberry cheesecake was also amazing. 

Overall the place was enjoyable. They have fire places right next to tables, which felt cozy."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I had our engagement party at Carmen's Steakhouse and had an amazing experience. The service was more than we could have imagined, staff was friendly and eager to help with any request we had from the beginning until the very last second of our party. Food was absolutely delicious, majority of our party had the 10pz New York strip loin steak and it was probably the best steak I have ever had. If you are looking to book an event or just go out for a nice dinner- you definitely get what you pay for here. The general manager Karen made everything run smoothly. 5 stars from us!"}
{"text":"This was an interesting experience. I was craving steak and I saw that Carmen's had decent reviews. I decided to give it a try, and the dinner started off very well, as the location was quiet and the decor was nice. The service was very good 10/10 the waiter and waitress were both very good. We decided to order two set menus ($100 wagyu, and $88 dry aged steak) the two apps were decent, Nothing to talk about, but here is where it went bad. 
We received our steaks, which were both undercooked( it was almost blue and not hot, I wouldn't have even called it warm). We complained and our steaks were put back on the grill and it came back closer to medium. We proceeded to eat and the steaks were hard to cut through (Really? Wagyu beef?) and my steak had sinew all through it and I couldn't eat half of it (the steak knife couldn't even cut through it). We told the waitress and she said she was going to tell her manager we were given a choice of any dessert to make up for our steaks... there was no apology from the manager who did not even acknowledge us throughout the dinner and when we were leaving there was no acknowledgment either. (We were also charged full price for our meals, when we honestly could only eat half of it) 

I would not recommend going here just because of the management and steaks at a \"steakhouse\", as I don't think that is how you should treat your guests."}
{"text":"Went for Winterlicious..such a good deal for $53.  The best garlic bread (complimentary) in the world!  We almost asked for thirds! Butternut squash soup came super hot..would have like a little crepe fraiche if you know what I mean! 10oz NY striploin was huge and tender.  NY style cheesecake was delish.  Definitely recommend for winterlicious"}
{"text":"Great food, got filet migon and it was very juicy and tender; great service; ambience was also a start!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious and well cooked .salad , garlic bread and dessert was nice. Service was little poor. Totally was a great experience and I will go back again!"}
{"text":"Service was extremely slow and inattentive. The server offered more bread to which we agreed and it never came. My husband had to go to the bar to get a beer he had ordered. We were there for the summerlicious event and were obligated to have the prix fixe. We were so tired of waiting for service/next course, we asked for our dessert to go. They obliged. We will not be going back. Very disappointing. P.S. The food was just okay."}
{"text":"Dinner was a disaster!  I would NEVER go back!

We ordered Caesar Salad to start.  The dressing was flavourful, but overwhelmed with garlic (In a bad way!)  I love the garlic in the Caesar salad at Jacob's & Co.!  But this was ridiculous!  And the so-called croutons were dozens of tiny cubes of stale and dry Wonder bread!  But that was not the disaster!

The nightmare began after the waiters cleared the appetizers and the wait began! 10 minutes....  20 minutes... and the steaks were nowhere to be found!  After 30 minutes, we asked a waiter where the steaks were and he claimed that they were being plated, as we spoke!  5 minutes later, a different waiter brought out a complimentary \"scallop\" for each of us, as the steaks were going to be delayed further, he confessed!  I don't know if the dish presented was a scallop or not, as nobody at our table would dare touch it.  The dish contained something swimming in what appeared to be a coagulated milk sauce and it had the most foul and pungent of stenches - like the smell of dead fish in Lake Ontario on a bad summer day!  A few minutes later, the untouched plates were removed and there were still no steaks in sight!

40 minutes had passed since our salads had been removed!  And our steaks were nowhere to be found.  Ridiculous!  

45 minutes came and went!  And then the steaks finally arrived - cold, mixed up and not as ordered!  Those who ordered sauce, didn't get any!  Those who didn't want any \"au jus\" found their steaks covered in it!  I had ordered the Ribeye, done \"medium\"!  It was served freezing cold and beyond well done!  It was like of piece of shoe leather.  One of my dinner guests had ordered her steak \"medium well\" - And it arrived cold and bleeding like it had been freshly slaughtered!  It was so rare, it was almost blue!  These two steaks had to be sent back, as the others at our table forgave the sauce mix ups.

The waiter was very apologetic and clearly recognized that the two steaks had been very wrongly cooked.  He took them back and promised new steaks immediately.  We waited another 25 minutes before the second round of steaks appeared.  And they were cooked wrong again!  My medium steak was blood rare and my friend's \"medium well\" steak was medium rare, at best!

I would never go back and would never recommend this restaurant to anyone!  Some of the staff were great, but we never had the same waiter or waitress twice in a row.  They kept sending different servers to deal with each course and each issue.  Some of the staff could barely speak English and could not understand simple questions.  At the beginning of the evening, one of the servers, who brought us an hors d'uvre, referred to them as a \"bush-bush\", instead of an amuse-bouche, and did not know what she was serving, when asked!
All in all, it was a disastrous evening and a genuinely horrible meal!  And I still cannot get rid of the over-powering taste of garlic in my system from the Caesar Salad, even now!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a great meal with family in the front room after years away. Great service by multiple staff including replacing the garlic break (really good) and never being rushed between courses. Great food - enjoyed the steak. Cooked perfect for us. Love the place."}
{"text":"Well, it's difficult to say.

Whatever this place is, it is NOT Carmen's for anyone who remembers the original.

That said, it's still pretty good.

We had steaks; mine was medium rare as it should be. My wife's was medium, at best, and verging on well done.

The black cod was absolutely superb, but the spinach risotto in which it sat was a little too al dente and not that flavourful.

The service was ok, but no up to par of some of the other steak houses around.

But, the big issue for me was as much as it looked like the old Carmen's, it just wasn't the same.  So, I may be rating it more harshly than I should simply because I loved the old place and the new one can't help feeling like an imposter.

All said and done, the food ranges from OK to quite good, the service from unenthusiastic to OK, but there are other steak houses that provide equivalent quality with much better value or similar prices but much better food.

I had to go once -- it is at least CALLED Carmen's Steakhouse -- but I doubt I'll be back."}
{"text":"I am not sure how people have written such great reviews to a restaurant that is clearly sub par and not worth the price. 

I made a reservation and went today (Valentine's Day). The staff was nice and greeted us, took our coats and then seated us in the ground floor dining room. 

This dining room was at about 60% capacity. We were seated at a table for 2 on an angle in front of a fireplace. It was quite cold out this evening but that is no excuse for a cold dining room. I mentioned this to the so-called manager who said he would get someone to stoke the fire. There were 4 or 5 different people trying to tend to the fire interrupting my evening yet they were having issues due to ignorance.

We started with the $17 French onion soup which was decent enough but it was lukewarm halfway through due to the cold room. 

We then proceeded to wait about half hour to receive our salads. Nobody addressed this delay and nothing was said as I sat there twiddling my thumbs. I ordered the Caesar salad which again failed to impress. The dressing was a simple vinaigrette sprinkled with powdered Parmesan with a flattened bacon wheel and pickled anchovy. This was not what I was expecting for a traditional Caesar salad. 

I also ordered the rib eye to be cooked medium. When I received it on the plate the upside of the steak was charred without grill marks and looked much overdone compared to what I had ordered. The steak tasted ok and want dried out since the rib eye is a fatty cut.
The accompanying vegetables were well done and tasty. The presentation was also nicely done. The one thing that completely turned me off was the double baked potato. If you have tried a twice baked potato at the keg you would expect something rich creamy and delicious. The potato I was served was flavourless with some strange textures which was completely unpalatable. 

At the end of the meal I asked to have my meat packed up to go. I paid my bill expressing to my server Frank that
I had a substandard experience. He apologized for the delay on the salad, the cold room and there wasn't much he could do. I think service can do a lot more than simply play lip service and apologize for the terrible experience. The manager also failed to do anything to rectify the situation. 

We went out to the front after paying the bill to get our coats and the concierge could barely understand how to match a name to a table to get our coats. I had to point out my name on is reservation sheet. My to go bag was nowhere to be found so completely fed up I walked out of this restaurant. 

This was not the experience I was expecting to pay for and especially on Valentine's Day. 

Please save yourself time, aggravation and money and avoid this pace at all costs. The Keg is so much better than this place for a fraction of the price."}
{"text":"What a lovely restaurant! Inside has this wooden, antiquey vibe, with a roaring fireplace and stained glass art. Coat check is available too. We came here one Saturday night for date night and it happened to be winterlicious. Prix fixe for $48 per person. The service is spectacular, with such attentive staff. And the dishes came out quite quickly too.

What I absolutely loved: their bread..this crispy yet soft garlic bread with spreads and condiments. And their creme brule (MUST GET)

For the appetizer, we ordered the Caesar salad and the steak tartar. Both we deliciously flavoured, except the crutons in the salad were stale. I'd order the steak tartar again next time.

The main, we both ordered filet mignon. But the one cooked rare was significantly more tender than the medium rare. Get the baked potato over the mashed too. 

Oh the bread, I just kept thinking about the bread...until dessert came. We ordered creme brule and Cheesecake with a blueberry compote. But O.M.G that creme brule..the best creme brule we've ever had. It was the highlight of the meal and a must get. I would come back just to order the creme brule."}
{"text":"Went here for Winterlicious. Its old school steak house that honestly, has had its day. I gave it 2 stars for the service, which was great. Food, WAY overpriced (even for winterlicious) and bland. My Caesar salad was missing the oomph. Made me sad. Then I ordered salmon (maybe that was my mistake...going to a steak house for salmon). Salmon was ok, and as long as its not overdone, its usually ok. But the 'sides'?! I'm pretty sure that butternut squash smeared over the bottom of my plate was straight out of a baby food jar. And the 'veggies' on top? Come on...a couple of chopped up overdone peppers...for 53.00!!!! I want a little starch OR SOMETHING to fill me up. Left with a bit of a hunger on, and a lot lighter in the wallet. Ps don't order the overpriced pinot grigio....its a step up from chilled water."}
{"text":"Their best courses are all at one glance in the prix fixe menu! We read the star's reviews and able to give a try on my bday occasion.  What a surprise the birthday flute cake is so so so good :)  Thanks my partner Carmen and Carmen's team!
We enjoyed so much my birthday dinner celebration at Carmen's on the night of 21 July."}
{"text":"I'm surprised that nobody reviewed this yet, because I could have sworn that it was a T.O. staple. But then, what do I know... I'm from New York.

I ate here once & was blown away on a few different levels. Surrounded by old school wooden furniture & big beer steins over the fireplace- the atmosphere in here was classic! Almost kitsch, yet somehow old world. The hallways on the way in showed old clippings & photos of the celebrities that have eaten there through the years. I do specifically remember a photo of Nat King Cole shaking hands with Carman. Oh, I really would have loved to wander around looking at everything. From the decor to the clippings. It all just suited my imagination perfectly.

They brought all sorts of odd things to the table, including pickles, olives, cottage cheese- but my mind was on that steak. I had a medium rare filet mignon, which came to the table on a small round wooden cutting board with its heart still pumping. They asked if they could cut it open before me to see if it were too blue for my carnivorous tastes . Then they cracked that sucker open & shined a mag light on it & I didn't care if it was too blue, I just wanted to eat it. And I did. This is where Carman's enters itself into my mind as serving me one of the best steaks of my life! That was the day that I started eating my steak on the blue side. I have promised myself to return one day. It was a nice experience & I have a warm fuzzy place in my heart for them."}
{"text":"Carmen's is old-Toronto. I'm sure it was very popular back when doing out for a dinner meant something more than wearing your best LaCoste golf shirt with the collar popped. Sadly, this time is no more and Carmen's has really fallen by the wayside and clearly been unable to keep up with the times. 

The service and the food was excellent but atmosphere and waiters are almost gimmicky. I realize it used to be a very formal place but I think you can keep the classic ambiance and still update a little.  The silverware and flatware are all pitted and likely as old as I am. Same goes for the Menus, what are they doing with these. You really just need to see these books, I mean, menus.

When I attended on Wednesday evening there was only one other party  in the restaurant. Not exactly a happening spot anymore.

Regardless, I would like to go back on a Friday or Saturday. It would be nice to see if its busy on the weekend. You might even be able to wear a suit and tie at this place without getting the stare down from other patrons with confused looks on their face."}
{"text":"When they get it right, they are second to none. We order through Foodora. The first time we ordered the filet mignon it arrived hot and cooked as ordered: Chicago style medium rare. It was a lovely piece of meat with a light crusty exterior over juicy tender meat. The baked potatoe had a crispy skin with a hot a fluffy white center. The crusted chicken was flavourful and tender with a crusty coating; it came with perfectly smooth and buttery mashed potatoes and some asperagus. The fries are thin and crispy. The crème brulle has a beautifully burned-sugar top with nuts and egg cookie bits. The consistency it soft and rich; there is a vanilla/coconut flavour. There is a blueberry on top. The last time we ordered them there was no blueberry on top; more importantly, there was little sugar crust and it was not set.  Last time we ordered the baked potatoe it was old, thick and yellowed; the skin wasn't crisp and it was wrinked; it's as though it was yesterday's reheated. We ordered the fries again and some were dried out/burned while others were as good as the first time. The French onion soup isn't good; there is a glob of cheese and the broth is bland; the bread is soggy. The cheesecake was good once but other times it wasn't set so we didn't order that again. The iceberg lettuce salad is tasty, fresh and different. The burger is good; it's not a pre-made patty. The bun is also good but was a little soft when it arrived; not too bad for delivery though. If I ordered again I'd have my own toppings ready. The sautéed vegetables are excellent but be warned that it's a small portion. Expensive but hit and miss with the quality. For the price, it's a bit of a risk to order; it was the best steak we've ever had though."}
{"text":"What a great experience! 

Let me start by stating that I never went to this steakhouse when it was owned by others, so this is not a comparison.

I had stopped by a few weeks ago after working out (so not dressed up at all) and one of the waiters was very pleasant and took me on a tour of the restaurant. I thought it was a nice gesture and decided I would try this place soon.

I was waiting for other people to post a review because I knew it would be pricey, but I still hadn't seen any recent reviews and it looked interesting, so I finally decided to try it out myself. 

What an amazing experience! from the moment I stepped in, the staff were very attentive and friendly. I sat at a large table (that had very nice plates and cutlery) in front of the chimney and the environment felt very cozy and elegant. I even felt like I was somewhere else, nowhere near a busy area downtown Toronto.

The food was delicious! the complimentary garlic bread was warm and very tasty. I got a medium rare barrel cut tenderloin, which came with 3 side dishes. I was very pleased with how perfectly cooked my steak was! it was slightly salty for mi taste, but I tend to eat with low salt, so it may be perfect for other people. The side dishes were very good as well, particularly the mushrooms and spinach.

I had ordered a glass of wine (it's served 1/3 bottle) which unfortunately I was not very excited about. I made the comment to Mike, one of the servers, and a few minutes later the manager or sommelier (not sure who it was) came to my table and offered to change it for another wine. A great gesture added to the list!

The chef also stopped by my table to ask how I was enjoying my dinner. He was very friendly and I complimented him on the food. At the end, he sent me a delicious complimentary cheese and dessert table. Another great gesture!

In summary, I absolutely enjoyed my experience at this restaurant. Obviously it's pricey, but it was totally worth it. I felt like I was in my own private dinner with amazing service and food. I will return to try other dishes. 

I think a lot of people still don't know this place has re-opened (different owners), so it's still a bit quiet. However, if you've thought about going, you should definitely go!"}
{"text":"Read the reviews on Yelp and decided to try Carmen's out.  Showed up and found out the place had been shut down.  Terrible experience."}
{"text":"Fantastic place! Ambiance is lovely, with a real wood fire burning and olden day style decor. The smell it threw off was so warm and friendly. Of course this was a converted mansion, and love the original architecture. 
Service was very good, and the waitresses often came by to refill our water, ask us how everything was etc. 
Food was divine!  We got the prix fixe menu and let me say that it was well worth every single penny. I also got a French onion soup, which is probably one of the best I've ever had. Not too salty, very brothy, and just the right amount of cheese (Gruyere). We had steak tartare, scallops, prime rib with pork belly poutine and creme brûlée. There was so much food that we had to doggy bag some of it. 
This is truly one of the old style steak places that sadly is disappearing from the Toronto landscape. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Most Memorable Feature: Intimate atmosphere

Steak and Tartare were a hit but the salmon was a very big miss.  It was blander than cardboard even with the squash puree but dessert was deliciously decadent so we left on a positive note.  Pickles and bread are not my ideal pre-appetizer but maybe it's compatible with other people's taste profiles.  The quality of the salmon made me question the $48 bracket designation but the Steak and Tartare were very well prepared.  Servers were quite attentive and the restaurant had a very intimate atmosphere.

{"text":"The steak is pretty good but the service is so poor! I literary never see that poor service at any other restaurant . The gay name Jay or Jerry talked super fast , walked away super fast, and don't listen at all!  He poured full bottle of wine (5 oz)in my glass even when I said that's enough in the half way. Without sincere ,warm service how dear you ask for 18% tip !"}
{"text":"Amazing food and very vintage place. I love the real fireplace when we dine in every time. It's like dining in a traditional English house. 
The miso cod is so good, as well as the scallops. These 2 are the most you must have to try. Oh, one more thing, they have a really cool coconut flavour creme brûlée."}
{"text":"Fantastic restaurant! Delicious food and great service. We ordered the calamari, cod, filet minion and mashed potatoes and loved them all. The calamari was the best I've ever had! Cute, traditional decor and a quaint patio. I'm visiting from Los Angeles and will definately come back!"}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem for sure!  I grabbed a coupon from one of those deal sites; $100 for two 4 course meals.  A great date night spot, or a nice dinner for a family or group.  It's situated downtown, but off the beaten path in a beautiful old house with stain-glassed windows.  They have an adorable patio with a little waterfall that I would like to sit on next time, but we opted to sit inside.

They have a lot of old furniture, paintings and decor which make it nice to look at while you're waiting for your food or heading up to the second floor to go to the bathroom.

Apparently they always have the 4 course menu, or al la carte.  The manager came over to see how we were enjoying our food and was telling us about how they are technically a steakhouse, they try to highlight the accompaniments and other courses just as well.  So whereas you may go to one steakhouse and get a huge steak and a bit of veg and potato, here the steak is smaller but there are other courses that are treated as important as the steak.

Now let's get to the food stuff....the food review!

I had the steak tartar - YUMMY!   Lots of flavour and spiced perfectly.  My boyfriend got the caesar salad and said that it was average, so I would go for the tartar if you like it.  Second I got the miso black cod.  It was AMAZING!  Probably my favourite part of the meal.  My boyfriend's as well, even though he got the scallops.  The scallops were also cooked beautifully and had a delicious buttery flavour, but the cod was a star.  We each got the ribeye which had a nice crust, but was cooked to a savoury, juicy medium rare.  We had fries (the crispy thin ones!) and the mushrooms, so many mushrooms.  And last, the coconut creme brule.

EVERY dish was spectacular, flavourful and drool worthy.  Even with the 4 course meal, they did not skimp on the portions.  They were huge.  I had a nice piece of steak and some fries and mushrooms leftover for lunch.  

I can't wait to come back here.  .  ."}
{"text":"Came here for Summerlicious. To be honest, wasn't sure about this restaurant because we never heard of it. But reviews and pictures looked good so we decided to give it a try. 

Food was wonderful, i had the escargot with puff pastry...delicious! Steak was perfectly done and they allowed us to substitute to fries, which were crispy and perfect type of frites to accompany the steak. My friend loved the coconut creme brulee. Chocolate mousse was mediocre. 

Service was personable but slow. They meant well and was attentive but everything we requested took too long to arrive. 

The restaurant is hidden in a quiet neighbourhood so it was tranquil and romantic. Patio was so lovely and we got a peek inside which was really well decorated. Looks like a good choice for private parties too. What a hidden gem. I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Great decor, ambience, and food. I went here for an intimate dinner with my significant other and we had a great time. Love the stained glass windows and antique furniture. I was surprised to learn so many old Hollywood celebrities had graced the halls of Carmen's (Jack Lemmon, Peter O'Toole, and Pat Boone). Would come here again!"}
{"text":"Terrible experience!  Will NOT return or suggest you to try!  On Feb 3, 2018, 3 girls friends and myself went for Winterlicious.  Jason was our server - he was rude, arrogant and of course, not friendly.  Assuming it is because he had 3 back to back tables of Asian customers - including us, though we spoke perfect English and were very polite to him.  When one of my girlfriend ordered a glass of wine, on the menu shown as $17 (with no indication for 6 or 8 oz), later on shown as $24 on her receipt - when we asked for clarification - John said \"I always ask if you want 6 or 8 oz\" with a very rude attitude and no accountability.   We did not recall him asking that question when she placed the order.  During the dinning, he only did 1 quality check, compared to the other 2 non-Asian tables he was serving, he was there chatting and more quality checks to ensure their experience was great.  We asked for bread refill for 3 times - 45 min later, finally one of the bus girl got it for us.   The worst part of experience was when we asked for bill at the end of the night, he gave us one bill (assuming 4 girls would want one bill?)  When we asked for separate bill, he stormed away and came back almost throwing the receipts at us.  On the receipt (see picture attached) he had added the service charge to the bill.  I asked how come for a table of 4 he would add the service charge as it usually only apply if it is part of 8 or more, he simply responded \"that's the way it is when you ask for separate bills\".   Food was not amazing for the value you paid for - beef tartar was tough and flavorless.  Steak was over cooked (asked for medium rare came as medium).  Dessert was not the highlight of the night either.  Yes, worst customer service ever.  Winterlicious is suppose to allow customers to try and perhaps using food and service to entice customers to return.  I WILL NOT RETURN, and neither will my friends.   There are lots of better quality steak house in the neighborhood, why waste your time and money on this place?

Reached out to the restaurant - will update the review if they resolve the issue"}
{"text":"Came here for a date night.  The seatings inside the restaurant is dimmed and romantic.  There's also seatings outside where it looks very comfy.  The waiters are very prompt and attentive, they constantly check on you.  I think it was the owner who regularly comes to each table to check on you too.  Great customer service. 

We got free starters of cheese bread with dipping sauce and pickles.  I actually really enjoyed this-the bread was hot and fresh (and I just love cheese bread overall).  All the food we ordered - tartare, scallops, sirloin steak, side of potato gratin and herb roasted chicken tasted perfect.  The food was presented nicely."}
{"text":"We went to for the Winterlicous menu.  Had the french onion soup, steak and turtle chocolate tart.  The building and history surrounding is wonderful.  The food itself was meh.  The soup was watered down and pretty tasteless.  The steak was the best part of the meal, small but flavourful.  The vegetables we ordered were not well cooked and more raw than anything.  My dining companion and I ordered the baked potato.  It comes in its own dish which was awkward.  The waitress brought a tray with fixings - sour cream, bacon and chives but the trays were all half empty and we were only able to have it for few minutes before the took it away.  No water refills, no asking about additional beverages.  The tart crust was dry and the nothing to write home about. There were a lot of serving staff but they need some training as to how to serve.  Poor, poor service.  Will not be visiting again."}
{"text":"Really great place for all types of red meat! I went here with my father and we ordered the rack of lamb and the fillet mignon. The rack of lamb was exceptional however the marinade was SUPER SALTY (would ask to tone it down). The fillet MIGNON was also delish with a rich flavour. The building that it is located in is quite unique and I would recommend walking around to the other floors to have a look. Service was prompt, knowledge and good. The prices were expensive but not over the top since you can splurge even more at steak houses!"}
{"text":"Wow, just came here for dinner with my parents and had incredible service and food. I had the black miso cod and it blew me away. The atmosphere is very warm, inviting and cosy. I got the seat closest to the fireplace which was lovely on a rainy day."}
{"text":"Have walked past Carmen's many times and finally had a chance to stop for dinner. Excellent. No other way to describe our meal. Everything was delicious. Scallops, black cod, steak, fries, garlic bread....  We loved everything we had. Service matched the food. Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"We had dinner here for Summerlicious and had a great time. The steak was prepared perfectly and the staff were great. The waitress we had was very nice and friendly."}
{"text":"Carmen's is a familiar steakhouse name in Toronto. It lives up to its fine reputation with great food and service. The decor is traditional steakhouse, very comfortable and established. I was very impressed with the food. The Caesars salad was one of the best I've had anywhere. The lettuce was cool, fresh and crisp just like it's supposed to be. No root or tough ends. Garlic and citrus dressing with just the right amount of bacon, anchovies and croutons. The garlic bread is still awesome. My steak was perfectly cooked and seasoned, served in a perfectly balanced sauce. Sides included plump juicy mushrooms and a tasty poutine. Service was friendly and attentive. Wine list was very good with lots of great choices. Prices were very reasonable especially considering the food quality."}
{"text":"??When people ask me which Fine Dining to recommend in Toronto, I always has one answer, Carmen's Steak House by Michelin Star Chef Forrest Liu. I tried 5 times over the past year with 5 different groups of food lovers and all highly-recommended feedback.

==The Environment==
One of the biggest non-food-related plus for this Victorian style restaurant is its elegant, glamorous, romantic, and very private dining environment. The house itself is a historical building that used to be a high-end private membership club for wine and such in the old days for the old money. The Tudor interior furnishing are all very delicately put with ceramic decorations, solid wood and leather seating, Tiffany lamps, and the stained glass windows. The lighting of the inner hall is pretty dark with real fireplace in the winter which was quite cozy to be around. The hall room near the front door also has by-the-window seating which is quite nice for a sunny day. Now they have a cozy patio open for the summer time in a very quiet zone of downtown core.

==THE FOOD!!!!!==
The meal begins with the classic accompaniments of well-toasted garlic bread, kosher pickles, kalamata olives and creamy cottage cheese spread. Here are some of my all-time favourites:

- Spicy Steak Tartare: Usually I'm quite picky about raw beef as tartare often has very high requirement of the meat quality with very impressive sauce, or else, it will be plain. Carmen's Steak Tartare is one of its dish that I wish I would have more: the size of the chop is just about right that it would not be too big that you feel the meat is loose or it will not be too small that you feel like you are swallowing minced beef. You can taste each piece of the Canadian Prime Tenderloin with Quail Egg and a very subtle sour vege (I haven't figured out which vege it is - I will guess it is mixed with a hint of aioli) which brings out the sweetness of the beef very naturally. The spiciness is also very unique amongst all beef tartare and a perfect fusion match!

- Seared Scallops: This is the famous molecular gastronomy recipe pan seared Scallops with Jasmine Sea Salt Emulsion. Indeed special and unforgettable. This is a must if you like modern cooking technique and scallops! It was served with hot plate, and this is very important as it must be eaten while it's hot along with the creamy sauce at the base. Also if you eat it cold, the texture of scallop and the jasmine aroma will be greatly paralyzed. I initially had high expectation of the jasmine part but it seems that the tint of smell is still too light to be noticed. The surface was not overly cooked while the inside still has the smooth texture of a fresh lychee, and for scallop this size, the pan sear time cannot be over 50 seconds -- this means the kitchen has the highest standards on the delicates! Cooked perfectly!

- Miso Black Cod: the key to grilled black cod is the sweetness, tenderness, and the creaminess, and Carmen got all three of them! Every bite just melted once the fish touches your tongue and the taste of miso distinguish it from any other Black Cod. The Spinach Risotto uses overnight slowly-cooked chicken broth as base (or else it won't have the savoury flavour) and the saltiness matches perfectly with the sweet black cod (maybe a bit too salty for me, just a small recommendation). You can also get the Black Cod as a main on the regular menu.

- Canadian Prime Ribeye: this is one of the recommended main entree that represents the name of the restaurant. Generally speaking, it is cooked a bit over than the normal standard. That is because the outside is quickly fried such that it is crispy outside and tender inside, and this is what makes Carmen's steak special. I would say the steak is not as exessively impressive after trying out their amazing selections of appetizers. It is definitely fining dining performance for the couple of times I tried.

- 45 Day Dry Aged New York USDA Prime Striploin. This was introduced last year as a selling point because it is usually aged for 28 days but Forest decided to do 45 days for a more flavourful steak. But I think it is salty again without adding any additional spice to it. The tenderness and flavour were both fantastic. (As you can tell, I'm pretty tired typing right now and this review took me so long to finish = = but it's worth it!!! XD)

Out of the four different kinds of desserts that I've tried: Coconut Creme Brulee, Chocolate Decadence Cake, 50 Shades of Soy, and the Osmanthus Cheesecake, with the first two are still available on the main menu but the last two are only tasting menu and seasoanl offering; my favourite is the coconut creme brulee which has a thick layer of crusted peanuts (or other nuts) on top of the traditional french recipe. The Chocolate Decadence Cake is made with coffee creme, anglaise, and vanilla ice-cream, and it's definitely a pleasure for a sweet tooth. ?"}

and expensive???"}
{"text":"If you want to feel like you're somewhere remote outside of the city, this is a good option. There's a fireplace, which is nice, and it was completely empty at one point on a Friday night, which is like being outside of the city kinda. 

The server was good at upselling the steak cuts so watch out there, as the American version is almost twice as much as the Canadian version, but it's bigger. I thought it sounded good so I went with it. The filet mignon was very tender. It definitely seemed like a good cut of meat, but the flavours of the steak and the sauce were pretty mediocre. 

The appetizer Caesar salad was very bland: barely any Caesar flavour. It tasted like what Caesar salad wants to be but just doesn't have what it takes to get there. Maybe they watered it down, maybe not. It was amongst the most boring salads I've ever had. 

The asparagus was just bad. It was dried out, and the hollandaise that accompanied it was basically all just oil or butter and lacked any real flavour.

The ambiance was log cabin meets suburban karaoke bar; the building was nice and rustic with the exposed brick, fireplace, and wood everywhere, but the music was oldies and not appropriate for dinner. It wasn't clear what the vibe was they were going for but whatever it was it was a complete miss. 

The wine was so basic. The recommended wine was J Lohr. Like, come on, do you have no sommelier? I was waiting for them to recommend Barefoot or Yellowtail next. I ended up going with the Chianti that apparently has more character, as the waiter said. It wasn't anything special; quite disappointing actually. For such a fancy restaurant that charges $25 for an 8 oz glass of wine, I was expecting more. 

If you wanna spend $150 per person including tax and tip for a basic meal from a spot that can't even get the classics of steak and potato right, this is the spot to go. The whole Caesar salad, steak, potato and wine thing has been done countless times. You'll be happier if you go to The Keg to be honest. 

Though the service was friendly, and the fireplace was nice, I can't say anything would bring me back here."}
{"text":"In town for business and wanted something a little nicer for dinner.  Found this through Yelp so I wanted to give it a try.  Was not disappointed, I sat on the patio and had excellent service throughout my dinner.  The steak tartare was a special treat, delicious with just a little spice.  Writing this while I'm enjoying my crème brûlée, trying to make it last just a little longer."}
{"text":"We took advantage of the reasonably priced lunch menu to check out this new reestablished historical restaurant.

$15 for burgers and fries-particularly when we would presume the burger would be outstanding, given the reputation of this place as a steakhouse over the decades, sounded like a great deal.

We sat on the outside patio which despite the heat today, was super comfortable and inviting.  We were served by the new general manager who was helpful friendly and chatty.

Sadly the food wasn't good.  We had the privilege of ordering our burgers medium rare-however they came unevenly cooked, well done in some regions and raw in the other.  They were served on an egg bun which was quite likely a day old. The ratio a bun to meat was excessive, detracting from what could've been an opportunity to display what was billed as\" ground tenderloin.\"

The fries looked awesome, hand cut, crispy, and visibly seasoned. There there was such a large amount of salt, that they were difficult to enjoy. (And I like my fries heavily salted!)

It may be worth a second try for dinner-and to take advantage of the $48 summerlicious menu. Hopefully they will have mastered the grilling techniques and someone has hid the saltshaker.  I understand due to code, the traditional wood grill has been replaced with a gas grill-always a loss in flavor-but usually simplifying the chef job. Not so this time around it appears."}
{"text":"There was quite a difference to the last time I tried this place! The entree is not as good but the dessert selection is up! I heard from a few friends that the quality of meat is definitely inferior to a couple years ago! I have to change my review due to my recent dining experience!"}
{"text":"Lovely setting, we went here with a table of eight on a Saturday night. I understand that eight is a large table but still no excuse for poor service. We had one waiter who took our orders, this young man should find another career. Other servers were lovely but didn't make up for the waiter. He wasn't very pleasant and didn't seem to be pleased with a large table of happy people on holiday. My friend's food was taken away while she was still eating! She turned to talk to the person next to her and her food was gone! 

The food was delicious, well prepared and presented. Too bad the cranky waiter ruined a good meal."}
{"text":"I'm absolutely in love with this great steakhouse in the city! What a great find.
I was here for summerlicious 2017 and will certainly be returning to try their regular menu.
From the minute we walked in, I loved the atmosphere and decor. The interior was stunning with stained glass and wood. 
Our waiter was great and greeted us as we were being seated by the hostess and we felt welcomed immediately. I find that with summerlicious you sometimes feel like the waiter is annoyed having to serve you or something, but we didn't get that vibe at all. 
When we first arrived the dining room was empty and so we had the waiters full attention, near the end he got busy but there were still many staff that were helpful and filled in where he couldn't. 
After ordering, some warm garlic bread, pickles, olives and cottage cheese were brought over to the table to get us started. Everything was so delicious that we inhaled that right away! Our amazing waiter noticed that we had gobbled up everything and asked us if we wanted more, we obviously said yes! Most restaurants and waiters have to hassled for more bread but not only did we not have to hassle he brought us more out of his own volition. So impressed!!

Meal:

App - Steak Tartare -5/5
TO DIE FOR! First time I've ever tried this delicacy but it was fantastic. Nicely seasoned and with some fresh pepper that was ground right at the table took this app to the next level, had a little bit of a kick but was just right for me.

Main - NY Striploin w/ fries -4.5/5
I asked for medium rare steak, it came closer to medium but cannot complain too much as the steak was so juicy and well spiced. Wish I had the option for mashed potatoes as it's my favourite side with steak but only options were fries, veggies or baked potato. Overall steak was great!!

Dessert - NY cheesecake with cherry topping 4/5
Can't go wrong with a NY cheesecake. Was so delicious and waiter brought over extra cherry topping, he was so wonderful! Great waiter that really enhanced the overall experience.  

Will be returning again soon!"}
{"text":"Carmen's has a unique Victorian interior that can be a romantic place for dinner. Came here for summerlicious and ordered the French onion soup, steak, and cheesecake. The soup was filling and cheesy while the steak was cooked perfectly - very flavorful, not dry, and quite satisfying. Their garlic bread was amazing too! On the other hand, the baked potato and veggies were okay. The cheesecake was good but I wished it had the graham cracker crust instead of the pie crust.  

As for service, it was overall good, very polite, quick, and professional. Our waiter seemed like a nice guy but he had this low pitched, obnoxious tone that made it feel like he was bored of his job. Aside from that, everyone else was friendly. 

This place was quite pricey but it's good to try at least once. Just be careful of the crazy and weird people around the area (outside the steakhouse) especially at night."}
{"text":"Garlic bread is one of my favorite things EVER. The fact that they give it to you for free as soon as you sit down at the table is nothing short of amazing. This place has an old-world charm that is just lovely. The exposed wood beams, the stained glass windows, the fireplace...what a great place to have a cozy, relaxing meal. Service was good; staff was nice. The oysters Rockefeller were delicious!"}
{"text":"This is a fantastic steak house, although some might find the atmosphere a little outdated, I enjoy it's old charm. Nothing quite like enjoying a nice warm fire and eating one of the best steaks that I have ever had.
Sad to see places like the Keg doing so well when we have a true steakhouse like Carmen's in the city"}
