{"text":"I finally stopped by after driving by this new place almost every day. 

What's good?
-Corn empanadas  (Venezuelan my fav)
-burritos or Chimichangas

Whats not good..
-Pulled pork tacos 
This really knocked off a star. It smelt like fart or stinky feet. Seriously. But maybe its suppose to??? The tacos also broke through the corn tortillas. (They do not double it) 

Tacos are too simple and I definitely would not order them again. But I would come back for everything else. 

They have a huge selection of churros and empanadas. The owner is super friendly and the place is clean. Don't judge it for the plaza it's in."}

New owner operator Mexican food flare that delivers authentic tastes. 

I've enjoyed several meals here. 
I have had everything on the menu. 

Great food, fresh, and great price. 

It's a little gem in the neighbourhood."}

{"text":"So Today was my lucky day!
I was driving to work and forgot my lunch 
Not in the mood for mall food court lunch 
Drove past some construction and saw this sign , crossed my fingers it was authentic and made the right turn
Boy was I in luck
For starters the place is super clean and organized. The owners are extremely friendly as well , very welcoming and genuine
They knew it was our first time there and helped us decide, and while we waited for our food(fresh to order empanadas)
She gave us free churros to snack on I was wowed. BEST churros I've ever had, crunchy on the outside and moist on the inside perfect amount of powdered sugar and chocolate or dulce de leche inside.
Then to top it off her husband arrived and offered us Cuban espresso to try. I was so overwhelmed w the clear love they have for their customers and pride in their food.
I ordered 10 empanadas cause I mean I obviously have to try all of them lol.
My fav is the Columbian style beef/potato one was soo delicious
I definitely will be back for a Burrito and home made chips/dip
They even have a Salsa station with homemade salsa spicy or mild which was soooo good"}
