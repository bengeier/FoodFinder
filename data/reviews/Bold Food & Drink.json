{"text":"What an amazing meal! Everything was so flavorful down to the tortilla that carried the delicious lobster guacamole. I had the salmon dish, poached perfectly and perched on top of a coconut cake. Delicious! My husband ordered the surf and turf, cooked to order and succulent.  For dessert we ordered the flourless chocolate cake. It will satisfy all of your chocolate cravings for a month. Truly decadent however, you won't leave a morsel. 
The staff was so personable and knowledgeable, what a pleasure.  We will certainly visit whenever we are in town."}
{"text":"Dan is the man! Odd hour dining on Sunday afternoon- Dan, our waiter took excellent care of us while enjoying our entrees. We ordered from lunch and dinner menus. Great ambiance and definitely fit for foodies.  Super fresh salads and nice take on octopus salad.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I went to dine out here with a party of 10 and we had separate checks.  A week later I realized my credit card had been charged the whole amount for nearly a thousand dollars without my signature.  For nearly a month I had called 8 times and spoke to both Cyrus and Tyler (managers) and was told that my card would be refunded on numerous occasions.  Now, after such a hassle, Tyler states I have to dispute the charge with my credit card company.  Tyler was rude and not very accomodating considering none of this was my fault as a customer. Hopefully I will get my refund so I don't have to continue to deal with this.  I do not recommend anyone dining at this restaurant as customer service is not of utmost importance."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic.  The service experience here is a breath of fresh air in the restaurant world when we are usually inundated by people who have lost the art of giving patrons good service with a good attitude.

Tyler, the general manager at night is great and you know immediately he has a passion for the business and making his customers happy and want to come back.

Rachel,  The server we had, was very attentive, very nice, knew the menu, knows the wine, just awesome.

Danielle, one of the bartenders at night, was just a blast, we had dinner at the bar one night as well and it was just as good of his experience is having a server and equally is knowledgeable about the menu and drinks.  She also makes a really mean Manhattan.

Get the bacon wrapped chorizo stuffed dates, the charred ribeye is great, the Zen Power salad is solid and the hanger steak is great too."}
{"text":"The starter (the lobster tacos) was good, but the entrees and the dessert were a disappointment. The duck breast was practically raw and quite chewy. The season dessert the waiter recommended - and that a special pastry chef comes in to prepare - was a random assembly of carrot puree, a few caramel macaroons and tiny bits of spices cake. It didn't really go together nor taste great. The waiter was very friendly and the place looks charming, but for the prices (it should have a $$$ sign) I would have expected much better food. Perhaps we were unlucky with our picks, but we won't come here again."}
{"text":"I beg to differ from all of the positive reviews. This place serves low quality food at premium prices.  My steak was one of the worst I ever had. The side of saut√©ed mushrooms came right out of a can.  I would skip this place if I were you !"}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to try out Bold for dinner on a whim for something new. We were absolutely delighted by the whole experience. The location was cool and had a great energy. The service staff was extra attentive (thanks Ambra -- you rock)!) 

And the food was delicious. We chose the Amish Chicken Brasserie and the Colossal Gulf Shrimp and Grits. The chicken was wonderful; the shrimp was amazing - and lived up to the colossal name :) 

Key Lime Pie was great!

It is always cool when you take a chance on a place and it completely exceeds your expectations. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"They sure were BOLD to try to pass off our short experience as amazing... 

To start with, when we called on a Friday evening to check the wait time, we were first told 30 minutes. Not bad at all! So we called back seconds later to put our names in and a girl said there was absolutely no wait, in fact they had open tables as we spoke. So a little confusing already with the staff. The didn't seem to have their stuff together.

When we got there, we were seated immediately outside. It was a nice spot, under the canopy, with a fantastic live musician. It took a while for our waiter to greet us. He was friendly, but that was about all. Once he left us with the menus, it took him about 10-15 minutes to show up with our water. By the time he showed back up we were ready to order our meal. We put in 2 \"tiny\"s, 1 \"snack\", and a \"green'. My friend also ordered a drink. It took 20 minutes before our Little Devils and Lobster Nachos showed up (\"tiny\"). My friend's drink still had not made an appearance. Our waiter placed the food down and walked away. As we began to dig in we realized we had no silverware, napkins, or plates. We waited a few minutes and without anyone coming by, I had to go in and find a waiter (who wasn't ours) to get plates and silverware. 

Her drink did finally show up. Mango something or other, that was made with a very unripe mango with little flavor. Extremely disappointed with that.

The Food: The Lobster Nachos should NOT be called nachos. They are not nachos in the least bit. You are presented with 4 skinny wontons with the lobster mix on top. Very disappointing. Understandably it is a \"tiny\" but don't use the word nachos if they aren't nachos. The taste of the lobster, however, was FANTASTIC! My friend commented that the Little Devil had good flavor, but she'd had better around the city. Then our \"small\" and \"green\" showed up. I got the Bold Pommes Frites (aka fries), with the white truffle oil. I ordered the smaller serving which equates to about one whole potato). I highly suggest, if you get the fries, that you get them with the truffle oil. Otherwise they're just overpriced fries. The aioli they had was good. My friend's salad was far from what I'd call a salad. I wish I'd taken a picture of the disgrace. As described, it was a romain heart, but there rest of the ingredients were very meager, with 3 baby tomatoes cut in half (we counted), a drizzle of blue cheese dressing (which she said was good), and a very small serving of pork belly, which was the highlight of her dish. I would not suggest getting that \"green\" if you're looking to eat out and enjoy a salad. You can easily make that at home for cheap.

HOWEVER: the couple sitting next to us ordered what looked to be a fish dish (probably the Mahi Mahi) and the Bold Club. Their dishes were very full and smelled amazing. If I were to go to Bold again, which I doubt I will, I would skip the appetizers, smalls, and greens, and just get a main dish."}
{"text":"Great place for steak, the fish is amazing and the selection of drinks and wine is sophisticated yet very accessible. Staff is attentive and happy."}
{"text":"My girlfriend found this restaurant while researching places in the city for us to celebrate our anniversary. I was a bit hesitant to try and brand new restaurant but I'm glad we did.

The atmosphere was upscale but relaxing, our waitress was knowledgeable and attentive, the food was fantastic, and the price was reasonable. I can't wait to go back and try something else"}
{"text":"Had an amazing dinner here! Our server was super knowledgable about the menu & extra friendly!

We went with steaks & were pleasantly surprised. The Brussel sprouts were phenomenal.

Will for sure return to this restaurant when in town."}
{"text":"My first time at bold: FANTASTIC!
I was alone and was given a seat at the chefs table. That's a great spot to dine if you are into the kitchen dynamic experience!
The whole staff is very friendly.
I was served every single course by Sous chef Brandon. Very polite and nice gentleman. He even himself prepared some of my plates.
Executive Chef Dimitrius was very nice and attentive as well. Stopped by to check a few times.
I started with the Foie Gras, which is the only dish I didn't like. For me, the maple syrup takes all of the other flavors away.

I also got a complimentary appetizer from the kitchen delivered by Chef Brandon - date wrapped in pork belly (little devil) Delish... well balanced dish through all the textures and the touch of cilantro, siracha, and chorizo.

I had for my main course the beef heart. Chef Brandon excelled on it! Perfectly mediam rer served over a nice corn, fava beans, and bacon salsa. 

I ordered to go from their composed section, the beef short ribs osso buco with grits. AMAZING! The beef was so tender! Falling apart and the grits were creamy and very flavorful, even though I only took a few bites and packed to go.

I ended with the flourless chocolate cake! So so outstanding!
I CANNOT WAIT TO GO BACK! 

Service was great. Michel - the sommelier took excellent care of me. Great wine suggestion and very knowledgeable about the menu."}
{"text":"Came here at the behest of my sister, who wanted to explore the food scene in Cleveland a little more. We went there during lunch. For one thing, I was pleasantly surprised to find that the Flats is having another social scene resurgence. (After all these years having moved away and spending my time in Cincinnati.) The ambience at Bold is very nice, with spacious windows and an upscale, but casual, setting.

I'll have to say that the food is quite good. We went pretty aggressive on the menu. For the appetizers, we ordered a small selection of oysters, which were fresh and nicely briny, which was a nice start to the meal. We also got the main lobster nachos, yellowfin ahi tuna tartar, and a small side of pommes frites. The pommes frites (or fries), were nicely crispy, though a bit thin, kind of reminiscent of Lola's signature fries. The lobster nachos were excellent, served on sizable fried tortillas that I'm sure was made in the kitchen, which served as a nice serving platform for the lobster and guac. The tuna tartar (yes, with raw tuna) was also excellent and fresh, with an Asian spin with very nice sweet and salty flavors that were pretty well balanced.

For the main dishes, we got the duck breast and Boston lobster roll. The duck breast was succulent with a hint of gaminess (which I actually like) with strips of fat that made the dish absolutely delicious with the stuffing and huckleberries providing nice complement to the duck itself. The lobster roll was probably overkill considering the lobster nacho appetizer, but it was chock full of lobster. The lobster roll is about as straightforward as you can get, but was outclassed by the duck.

Overall, Bold is an excellent addition to the already flourishing and remarkable food scene in Cleveland (take that, Cincinnati--you can learn a few things for sure). It's a bit on the pricier side with regards to portions, but the quality of the food makes up for it. I'd give this place 4.5/5 stars overall. I can certainly see myself coming back for another meal, but probably not any time soon, as there are many other restaurants to explore in Cleveland.

For those who complain about the wait time, good food takes time and a good meal is enjoyed with plenty of time. If you're expecting some of these dishes, especially the main hot dishes to come out in 20 minutes, you're expecting fast food service or food that's being reheated. And that is a travesty. Sit down, enjoy the ambiance and the window views. Take an hour or two out of your busy schedule to enjoy the good food here. Or just go to Chipotle instead."}
{"text":"Went on a Thursday around 3:00 and wanted to sit outside.  We walked in and people saw us (manager was interviewing someone and two kitchen people) waiting to be seated at a table.  We were the only customers there and they were open, but they just let us wait there without addressing us or to seat us we waited a couple minutes and left.   If that is the way they treat their customers, I don't want to eat there."}
{"text":"My mother and I just dined her this evening. I am in town for the night from Miami. It was truly one of the best steaks I have ever had.  Charlie was the best server so sweet and extremely knowledgeable. My mother is going to be coming here frequently, and next time I am in town I DEFINITELY will be back. Thank you again Charlie for the great experience!"}
{"text":"Great food selection for those of us that eat fish / seafood.  Great ambiance, great service, and Tyler treated us very well.  Owner also came out to see how our meal was afterwards, which we appreciated - shows a personal touch.  Great drink selection along with great scotch / bourbon.  All in all we will be visiting here again soon!"}
{"text":"Went out with the girls and had drinks and food at the bar.  Service was fantastic,food was great and the drinks were very good.  Carlos and Danielle were a ton fun.  Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I can not even put my to words the experience we had at Bold tonight. The service from Charlie was impeccable. The chef Brandon went beyond our expectations. Now realize, our service was unbelievable before we even let them know what we were going through. So here is the story. Really, life at times serves you a big bum hand. My brother just in-law is ready to fight terminal pancreatic cancer. This was his 9th anniversary dinner with my sister in-law. They made this dinner so special, if life ends tomorrow it was worth living. Need I say more. What a special memory in a lifetime that is too short. Charlie and Brandon, thanks for the hugs and words of encouragement. Thank you, from all of us. We are enjoying every minute we have in life and are truly grateful for such a great meal filled with love!"}
{"text":"Attention to detail is the theme here...from the cozy semicircle booths, funky industrial lighting and indoor firepit to the delicious gin grapefruit martini, maple glazed Brussels sprouts and award running shrimp and grits. But the winner was the perfectly char grilled Mexican corn!"}
{"text":"Food was very good, well prepared. Service was slow. I'll agree with other reviewer that it was strange to have all of the televisions \"viewable\" in the main dining area (at least where we were seated as a party of 8)."}
{"text":"The service is not as high quality as their food prices. He forgot our second round of drinks that were supposed to arrive with the meal. Once the meal arrived he never check to see if we were ok with it... 3 inexperienced staff members brought our food to the table with no idea who ordered what and waiter didn't show up until we were done with the meal. The appetizers arrived early, I gotta give them credit for that.

The food is good. The only disappointing item is the lobster nachos. You get 6 tiny nachos with a little bit of lobster and guacamole on the tip. It really looked like a joke when he put it on the table. The 2 tacos are ok, not as impressive as people describe them in other reviews. According to my companions, burger and duck entr√©es were good. The brussel sprouts are really well done with cranberries, onions, seeds and a sweet sauce.

The drinks are not impressive at all for $12 each... and the price is not on the menu so hopefully I am helping you to be a wiser costumer."}
{"text":"I went here for $2 taco night with my boyfriend, and I was not disappointed. We sat in the bar area, and at first the bartender did not know that she was supposed to serve us. After about 10 minutes, she came over, apologizing profusely, and our beers were on the house as an apology. We started off with the small plate of the lobster nachos, which were to die for. I just wish that there were more than 4 of them (generously portioned- but still), but I guess that is what you get when you order from the \"Small plate\" section of the menu. Next, we each got some of the $2 tacos, which were generously stuffed. They only have 3 options, but they are all delicious. I got the chicken and the pork, and my boyfriend got all 3 (chicken, pork and the mahi mahi). The tacos were soooooo good. We also got a side of brussel sprouts, which were delicious. They were not crispy or crunchy like I normally like my brussel sprouts, but the flavor and the juices mixed with them -- it was out of this world. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"You really shouldn't have to pay $18 for a burger, but if you do, this is the one you want. Cooked to perfection with 2 of the best slices of bacon I've ever had. The fries were fresh cut and nicely done, but a bit thicker than I prefer. 

Washed it all down with an Arrowood Cab, which I haven't had in 20 years, but was as good as I remembered. 

The bartender, Rachel, was very attentive and friendly. Great selection of bourbons. Neat ambiance. Would not hesitate to come back with others to rip into the lobster nachos."}
{"text":"Really wouldve liked to get a seat in the dining room as it looked very nice but we settled for a high top in the bar instead. Hostess saod nothing was open in the dining room even though it was empty and they had full availability on opentable? Really enjoyed the shrimp and grits however but the other dishes I tasted were good but nothing fantastic. Tuna tartar had arugula in it which didnt work that well and mahi lettuce wraps had a bunch of great stuff included they were pretty nice. Service was friendly although couldve been a little more polished. Never understand how you can serve a side salad at the same time as an entree, thats just foolish. Bread course was not great either."}
{"text":"Exceptional food, lackluster service.
Four of us had a very enjoyable meal tonight; each of us very pleased with our selections.
But why oh why doesn't Bold train their waitstaff to be attentive?
In spite of our  very delicious dinner, the evening ended with tone of annoyance.
No idea why our waiter forgot about us. It took a while to get our plates.
Then, forever to get our check while our waiter frolicked with his colleagues.
And once I offered my credit card, it took yet another millennium for for the waiter to notice I was ready to pay.
I enjoy leaving a nice tip for a good meal, but tonight the poor level of service saved me several dollars."}
{"text":"This place made a delicious salmon! It's a pretty low key spot downstairs from the aloft hotel (very convenient for any work travelers). When I first arrived, they said their kitchen was closed (which was weird for this east coast gal because it was 8:30), but then they agreed to make one more dish, and I sure am glad they did."}
{"text":"It take guts to call yourself bold.  And the food was pretty much up to par, though not BOLD!  Start with a cocktail - wine list is so-so and the beers are the usual good selection. The bar is shiny in all ways: they make their own red wine reductions and use all sorts of unique bitters.  A true craftsman at the bar. 

The food was very good.  All the appetizers were tasty and unique.  The corn had a wonderful sauce, and the fish and chips were just he right balance of smelt and skin-on fries with a unique tarter and kobiko sauce.  The mains were generally great. The shrimp and grits was a standout: not too spicy, shrimp cooked just right, and rich flavors.  The steaks were just barely over cooked but had great texture and flavor.  The only disappointment was the Kabobs- not much meat and bland veges."}
{"text":"The one thing I regret is...that I'm writing this review late. In fact, almost a year after moving out of the Flats, where this well-run establishment serves up New American food mixed in with some unique twists on other cultural offerings. I'll have to admit, the options are limited for vegetarians such as myself, but the reason I'm still rating Bold at 5 stars is because of the versatility of combining appetizers. I ordered the chile rellenos, which was filled with the most heavenly cheese imaginable, and the fries, which were perfectly seasoned and light on the oil. I finished it off with a cocktail, which was perfect. 

A great bonus, maybe even something we have grown to neglect, is great service. Our server Loren (hope I'm spelling that right) was one of the best servers I've ever had at a restaurant. He regularly checked on my friend and I and knew the menu like the back of his hand. I was also impressed at his knowledge of the cocktails and beers on tap. I really need to come here again."}
{"text":"We went on the eve of New year's Eve. Ambiance was perfect. Hostess seated us in the fireplace area, very thoughtful on a cold winter night. Ordered the bisque, perfect. Then, we ordered the Ohio Burger and Manny's steak kabobs. They were both delicious. Our waitress was on it and even brought out dessert for my fiance's birthday. Amazing service, delicious food, beautiful ambiance - highly recommend and would come here again!"}
{"text":"If you want the best experience and the most awesome food you need to go to Bold!  Charlie and Sean are the best and so attentive. Chef Brandon is the best chef in Cleveland!  Hands down!"}
{"text":"Had a great experience here. My boyfriend got a burger, which was juicy and delicious. Fries were great. I had the devils on horseback and ahi tuna app, stack thing-both were great. Good wine list and nice decor. Service was fine, not overly packed for a Friday. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Two of the dishes came out cold(lobster Mac and cheese) and al the food here is just bland. I have been here three times and this will be final time. The food has no flavor and never has any of the times I have come."}
{"text":"BOLD Food And Drink was absolutely awesome! The restaurant is on the small side but it makes it a bit more intimate but it is not too quite. Everyone there was so friendly and nice which made our dining experience a lot more enjoyable. Our waiter Michele was awesome. Their Black Walnut Manhattan tasted very good and my Wife really enjoyed her wine. For an appetizer we had the Duck Foie Gras which was very tasty. I have never had this before so I wouldn't know what to compare it to though. For dinner I had the NY Strip and my Wife had the Sirloin and we split the Brussels sprouts. Everything tasted great and the steaks were cooked to perfection. Michele helped me pick out the wine that fit my taste. To top off the night we had a cr√®me Brule (sp) which was delicious. And lastly to show how nice Michele was to us when we were leaving he was carrying drinks to another table and passed by and opened the door for us with his other arm. Bottom line we had a great dining experience."}
{"text":"I have had 2 TERRIBLE experiences here! First time theService was good, but the food was terrible I ordered a filet mignon medium rare, the first time it came out well done, the second time it came out blue rare. Ridiculously disappointing especially for the price of the food. They should find a chef that can cook steaks
The second time This was a terrible dining experience! For an \"upscale\" restaurant they need serious improvement! Like new management, new wait staff, and a whole new kitchen! It took 1 hour and 45 min to get our dinner, when the restaurant was 3/4 of the way empty! How does that work exactly?! Then it took another 35 minutes to get 2 drinks.. the manager couldn't have cared less when we attempted to speak to him twice, and our waitress still added a 20% gratuity when every time we complained to her she made up a different lie and ignored our comments, she never once asked us what she could do to help or if she could bring her manager over to help. TERRIBLE RESTAURANT I would never in a million years recommend this restaurant to anyone 

If I could rate this place a -10 I would"}
{"text":"We dined at Bold during a recent weekend stay in Cleveland. 
Though not on the water directly, the outdoor seating area was very nice. Loud music heard from the bar two doors down, if you're not in the mood for that, you may want to sit inside. 
Our server, Fielding, was witty and knowledgeable. 
He was awesome. 
I had the club sandwich, shown here split into two. 
Half of the sandwich was quite filling! 
The honey mustard sauce was delicious (wish they sold it by the bottle!)
Also loved the cilantro mayo dipping sauce for the side order of chips. 
Overall great service, atmosphere and food! 
Would recommend."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places in the Flats.  My husband and I have been here many times for dinner.  We like to sit at the bar and love all the bartenders - the service is excellent.  In addition to great food, drinks, and service, they get high ratings because they have a good number of vegetarian-friendly menu items and a good seafood selection.  I've been a couple times for lunch (the lunch menu has a lot of really good salads).  I only wish they would do a tomato bisque and grilled cheese combo.  TBH I've never asked, so maybe they would sub out the kettle chips and do a small upcharge for the soup.

As for specific menu items: the vegan health & wellness salad is really good; the beets are good (a little too sweet though, but would order again without the agave); the charred street corn and chile rellenos make a good combo; the shrimp tacos are really good (husband's favorite); the tuna tartar was really good (although a couple more plantain chips would have been good, will have to ask next time); the zen power salad is also good (be forewarned, it is a HUGE salad); the pomme frites are good (that's hard to mess up though); the salmon and mahi are really good - as between the two I prefer the salmon, but that's just a personal preference.  I would love to try the shrimp and grits, but I HATE HATE HATE fennel and it apparently can't be made without it :(

This place also has great cocktails, and a good beer and wine selection.

Anyway, I highly recommend this place.  Be sure to make reservations (or try to get a seat at the bar) and be sure to save room for the key lime tort for dessert!"}
{"text":"This is the previous site of Ken Stewart's. Nicely appointed. I had the Little Devil appetizer, which was amazing, and the Amish Chicken Brasserie which was fresh, flavorful, and delicious.

I had the Key Lime Torte for dessert... also delicious! 

Discovered the chef here also runs the Forage Public House in Lakewood. Hats off to you Chef Demetrios! Kudos!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a cocktail and a nosh on a Saturday afternoon. (everyone else around us was celebrating some sort of Cinco de Mayo party that seemed to involve several local watering holes, we did not want to get sucked into that)

We arrived around 4:30 and there were plenty of seats at the bar and a nice Happy hour menu.  We all ordered cocktails and (over) ordered appetizers including the mexican corn on the cob (there were 3 of us and 2 come per order - but they were nice enough to give us 3 pieces), also a chicken taco, truffle fries (YUM - Cleveland does not disappoint with their potatoes or their truffle essence!), a couple of figs stuffed with chorizo and wrapped in bacon.

Lots of local beer on tap."}
{"text":"BOLD was a really nice place with some really good food.

I ordered the Cornmeal Crusted Canadian Walleye and really liked it. I would put a warning on this dish though and tell you it's VERY garlicy so be careful if you're ordering this dish before a date or client meeting, you may be breathing fire for a little bit afterward. If you're okay with that then I highly recommend ordering this because it was sooooo good.

I will certainly come back on my next trip to Cleveland and next time I really want to try some of the amazing sounding snack offerings including Grilled Octopus, Stuffed Chile Rellenos and the Maine Lobster Nachos"}
{"text":"Came here for an early, light dinner on Sunday. What a great time! Our server was one of the best we've had in a while. She was attentive, knowledgeable and fun. We caught the end of happy hour (3-6 daily) and for a $5 pour of red, it was delicious. 

We also tried the Mexican Street corn, which was savory, salty, smoky and sweet. They also have great views of the east bank and a gorgeous fireplace. We'll be back to try a full dinner again soon!"}
{"text":"This place took WAYYY too long to get our food. We walked in and almost an hour and half later we received our food. (The food wasn't even anything special!) The waitress forgot our drinks and blamed it on them having to open a new bottle of wine (and that's why it took 30 min to get our drink) and it was just a very bad experience. We did not get out of the restaurant until after 11pm! The manager refused to admit they were at fault. And the cherry on top of the cake is when I received my check the inside of the thing had food or something in it with crap all over my check.  Would not recommend ."}
{"text":"Nice food, good ambience, nice location (little walk from the water). Prices are high. The lobster Mac a cheese didn't taste like $31 or however much is was. I guess their sea food is fresh and it tasted good, but I still think it was a bit much. However, the place is already a fancy dine so it is expected. Service was good as well. We only went for a light meal before walking to the water to watch the boats, but I would go back again to try their happy hour."}
{"text":"I'll keep this short and sweet. Food is great. Servers are great. Atmosphere is great. Getting your food in a reasonable amount of time? NOT SO GREAT! Been here 4 times for lunch since it converted from Ken Stewarts. Not once has my food been delivered in less than 30 minutes. Today it took 40. Is the place packed? Not so much. Many unseated tables. No wait at the hostess stand. They're simply slow.

The BLT and Bold Club are very good. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Nice trendy spot for drinks and food. Had the lobster nachos and the sweetcorn on the cob (cheese and cilantro mayo) then was going to order burger but they were all out, so ended up getting the Bold Club chicken sandwich, and it was very good. Would of gave 5 stars but our server was slow and never brought out our utensils or napkins, it was busy but still no excuse. Closed our tab and went to the bar for more drinks. Now the bartender was great, great service and he had a great knowledge of drinks. Looking forward to returning."}
{"text":"The food and atmosphere was great.  Love coming here when we see a concert at Nautica.  The drinks are BOLD and strong.  We had a large group and all ordered something different, ALL was so good.  The service was great.  Our server Charlie made our whole experience FANTASTIC!!  Charlie had our food and drinks out while still giving us a relaxed time.  I highly suggest if you go, ASK FOR CHARLIE!!!"}
{"text":"The Fats Revival Martini was just what we needed before the concert the other night! Also the Lobster Nachos, Ahi Tuna and Shrimp Tacos were so tasty and prepared PERFECTLY!"}
{"text":"Great food and service. The corn  and devil eggs were great appetizers.  Nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Hands down the best filet I have ever had!!!! The staff was attentive and friendly and our food arrived quickly. Very upscale location thats reasonably priced! Great place for a romantic dinner and your date is sure to be impressed!!!"}
{"text":"First visit and probably the only. Menu was too adventurous for me.  Decided on the mahimahi, nicely prepared and tasty. The dessert,, can't recall the name was fantastic, a lemon and lavender sorbet and pudding.
 Our server was MIA most of the evening."}
{"text":"First our server was outstanding for a large number of reasons so thank you Michel. Then there was the food, i could eat here everyday we had a group of 4 everyone tried everyones plate and everything was amazing. Im not sure if you can order anything here that isnt fantastic. Great execution!!"}
{"text":"Great food, great experience, great ambiance. Service was on a slow side so if u r in a rush, not the place for you. One of our dishes took a long time, so they gave it to us complimentary. Would definitely go again!"}
{"text":"We went to Bold on a recommendation from our daughter and son in law. They raved about the food so we couldn't wait to try it. What a disappointment! This is truly a hit or miss place. Starting with the oysters. They were bland and gritty (not cleaned well). The accompanying sauces were vinegar and cocktail sauce ( I could've done that at home). My entree was filet mignon and supposedly garlic mashed potatoes. I asked for medium rare and received a filet that had a slight red center if you looked really hard and the outer part was medium well to well done. The so called garlic mashed potatoes were milk or water and potato buds blended well but very flat and bland. I felt like I was on a doctor restricted diet. Ugh!! We paid $140.00 for our meal and will never go there again. Waitress and ambiance was great which saved it all."}
{"text":"Get the burger! Staff recommended it and I'm super glad. Very juicy and served on a croissant bun.  The fries that it comes with are addictive. Light salt and garlic. Decor is clean and sophisticated inside, but still has TVs to watch the game. Large patio with plenty of seating to enjoy a beer on a sunny day."}
{"text":"beautiful place!! the steak was awesome, so tender and juicy, reminded me of the upscale steak houses i have visited along my travels. their menu is so full and plentiful, options for literally everybody. parking is a hassel, there is a valet but only during peak times, which you should definitely make a reservation because this place was packed when i went for lunch.

Service was top notch, friendly, fast and very helpful. Food was on the more expensive side but totally worth it, order a meal or a bunch of appetizers either way youll be a happy hippo at the end of the meal.

Great selection of beers and hard liquors. I like the atmosphere and the downtown feel."}
{"text":"My fianc√© and I love trying new places during restaurant week, and with downtown's booming restaurant scene, it was a tough decision. I ultimately chose this restaurant based on the restaurant week menu, only to find a completely different menu the day of the visit that was much less impressive. What made it a little more disappointing was upon arrival we were not even given the restaurant week menu. Strange. Our server was friendly albeit forgetful as he forgot most of the items we ordered and had to double check with us or bring us the wrong thing! Thank god for the excellent food runner who brought us little samples and fixed the waiter's screw ups. The walleye and little devils were superb! Skip the sirloin and Rhode Island calamari (not remotely Rhode Island-ish). Probably will skip this place in the future and head to sister restaurant Forage instead... better service, similar menu, easier access."}
{"text":"We were extremely please with service here.  The food here was simply amazing!  Try the fish and grits or the walleye!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, decent service, mediocre management.  

Similar to other restaurants in the flats - they close when the feel like it, even if over two hours prior to what is listed on their site and front doors.  Bad news for business travelers staying a Aloft who plan on eating in the area after a long day of travel.  

Bold - take some notes from Aloft upstairs on how to deliver excellent management & service."}
{"text":"Phenom food.  Get the chicken and share a salad. My wife and I went on a Sunday night and we enjoyed the crabby - and a bit slow - service. Sunday night is a weird night in Cleveland. Most places close early and the places that are open are being run by people that want to be closed. If Cleveland is to make the jump to a destination city, which it is not yet, it will need to be a better Sunday night city. Go TRIBE"}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place based on the menu.  Putting aside the waiter screw ups (this stuff happens so it's not worth dwelling upon), I was disappointed with the meal itself.  I ordered the sirloin steak and while it was pink on the inside, it was tough overall.  It wasn't seasoned at all so it lacked flavor although the accompanying sauce made a valiant effort to perk it up.  The roasted wild mushroom side dish was just bland, with no roasted flavor making itself known.  The wedge salad, using romaine instead of iceberg lettuce that I thought was an improvement on the standard, had a nice blue cheese dressing.  But the bacon bits/lardons were quite tough and didn't bring any bacon flavor to the dish.
It's a shame as I was hoping to add this place into my restaurant rotation.  One and done."}
{"text":"Amazing meal !! Both times I've been here. The lobster roll was good the lobster tails were good. The rocket salad hit the spot and had nice flavor. The filet was good. The Amish chicken was so tasty even the texture and tenderness were perfect. Dessert was really good we had the chocolate \"flour free\" cake with avocado ice cream on the side Mmmm..  Our server was awesome I believe his name was Michele
I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"The ambiance was fairly nice -- gas burning fire places, low light, as long as you place your back to the TV's. Why on earth would I want to watch a Batman movie while eating a 'fancy' dinner?

The water tasted funny -- strong chlorine taste -- but I didn't discover this until the drink menu had been cleared away. By the time I got to see a beer menu again, our dinners were 90% finished, so I went the entire meal without drinking anything. This tells you something about the frequency with which the wait staff checked up on us.

We ordered two appetizers -- neither one showed up before our entrees (!), and we had to ask about them. We ended up canceling one, and kept the other because it was apparently already in progress in the kitchen -- it was the last thing we ate, and was OK. Shrimp tacos -- tasted good, but on flour tortillas (first ding), and absolutely slathered in sauce (second ding). Meh.

Main entrees were both okay. Nothing special, but perfectly decent. On the plus side, they brought us some complementary oysters which were probably the best tasting thing we had all evening.

So, to summarize -- the kitchen screwed up our appetizers, the waiter was not really on top of it (the place didn't seem *that* busy), and the food was okay but not what I'd expect for the prices we paid. YMMV as they say."}
{"text":"I love a restaurant that has a full meal for the full day. We eat at odd times and sometimes it is difficult to find a place for a great meal. No worry at Bold. While the menu does have some weekend evening features and a few Happy Hour specials, the rest is always offered. For 3:30 diners, that is the perfect recipe for a relaxing meal. 

We started with Little Devils, a bacon wrapped date filled with Chorizo and sitting on two spiced sauces. They were excellent. The Fish and Chips were deep fried and breaded Smelt with fries. It comes with a tarter/remolade and ketchup, but our fine server (Mo - a real pro!) also brought a lime-mayo that I loved with the fries (I'm one of the four people on the planet that does not like ketchup on fries, mayo...WOW!)

My wife almost inhaled The Walleye served over shrimp and corn mashed potatoes and a green garlic butter sauce that she felt lighted the entire dish. I had the Veal Milanese, a way to large pile of finely breaded Veal. Initially, I thought it might have been dry, but hidden under the bubble of cheese was Angel Hair pasta with a fiery tomato sauce. The touch of heat was exactly what the dish needed... that and a second person to eat half the food!  I did what never do, I took home leftovers. My wife did what she never does, she cleaned her plate! Bold may be bazaro-world. The Creme Br√ªl√©e was a nice finale. 

Not sure why it took us so long to visit Bold, but we are certain a return visit will never be that long!"}
{"text":"Food is excellent and staff was amazing. I was visiting from San Diego, CA on a business trip. I considered the place to be upscale but I was dressed down in a hippy way and I was treated with the up most respect. Visit this place if your in town"}
{"text":"Atmosphere is modern fancy and quite loud for dinner.  Great place for large groups though!  I would recommend making reservations ahead of time. Entrees are approximately $20-30.  Great appetizers to try are lobster nachos and the corn. I also highly recommend the Amish chicken which is 2 chicken breasts covered in cherry tomato and mashed potato goodness."}
{"text":"Pretty darn good. I loved the location, atmosphere & our service was great. I had a yummy dirty martini and split their cheese plate with my mom that was tasty. They have a decent amount of options on their menu that looked like good choices, but I was craving a burger. The burger was above average and came with delicous fries in a  cute mini basket. We had a great girls dinner and I would be happy to return. Prices are also very fair!"}
{"text":"Went before a show. Time management was not great and they weren't that busy. My filet was not cooked properly ( no time to send back) nor as good as my wife's sirloin. The icing on the cake was being charged a $1 for bread when spending quite a bit on dinner and drinks. 
Really?"}
{"text":"$13 for a Titos and soda is where I draw the line. This is Cleveland, Ohio, least I remind you, and Bold is not even close to being one of the nicest restaurant in town. This is a price suited for Velvet Dog or perhaps Society Lounge, or a club in NYC or Vegas. This is a great example of another aggressively pretentious restaurateur taking full advantage of Cleveland's food scene. It's literally become South Park's SoDoSoPa episode. 2 Tito's and sodas + 1 specialty cocktail = $40 before tax....FOR THREE DRINKS. Unreal. At least come over and give me a kiss before you screw me.

I admit to this being one of the worst reviews I've ever made but it's incredibly upsetting that this is the price-trend in a city otherwise known as a bastion of affordability. 

Go somewhere else unless you take pleasure in wasting your hard-earned money on average drinks."}
{"text":"Had the amish chicken, it was above average.

Questionably dark outside/ inside

Not great at answering the telephone

good location

Not in a rush to get back

\"The biggest difference is this is going to a place you can afford to go to any day in the week.\"- not true."}
{"text":"I've been using Yelp for over 2 years now while traveling to find the best food, but rarely ever leave a review. Bold made me want to leave one... I had the Duck Breast and Brussels sprouts as a side and it was by far the best I've had. Loved them both, but the flavor of the sprouts was tops!!"}
{"text":"I've been here many times with friends or family, and I have never been disappointed. 

You can make a reservation here with Open Table which is super convenient and easy to use. Just make a reservation. It's always super busy here in the evenings, and it'll alleviate the stress of having to wait a long time to devour this scrumptious food. 

My go to is the Amish Chicken. It has everything you heart could ever want. Juicy and flavor packed chicken abed a mountain of fluffy & delicious mashed potatoes, tender grape tomatoes, and a wonderful balsamic sauce. Seriously incredible. 

Service is always awesome and there's a decent wine selection!"}
{"text":"I came here with a large group for a friend's birthday celebration. We had 8pm reservations and our table wasn't ready until 8:30pm. To rectify the situation, they brought over a complimentary bottle of champagne- much appreciated!

Our server was quite attentive and helpful with any questions we had on the menu. I ordered the Amish Chicken and was very impressed. It was super flavorful and rich. 

This place is on the pricier side but the quality of the food and mixed drinks is phenomenal. I would definitely come back in the near future!"}
{"text":"Bold is a new favorite spot in Cleveland. Have a great menu selection and the staff is very friendly. Have someone playing live music in the bar area on the weekend, is a nice touch. We had a big party of about 15 one time that I came here. Service was outstanding and everyone very much enjoyed their food. I will be a frequent visitor!"}
{"text":"Best food and drinks at the east bank! Highly recommend this place! Service is on point and vibe is great. The servers are knowledgeable about their food. I will be coming back regularly. We had the chicken, Brussel sprout sides, and a few apps! All amazing!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I gave this place 4 stars because the food was good, but I was tempted to knock it down a star due to our experience.  Since it's located in the Flats which is now back to being a trendy hotspot, I expected the restaurant to be more upscale.  The other customers were dressed very nice, which just isn't my style, but I enjoyed people watching.  I was mainly annoyed that we waited so long for our table when I had made a reservation.  We did arrive early, but we waited an additional 30 min after our reservation time.  

The manager could clearly tell I was annoyed and I suspect they figured out I was Yelp Elite member, because they offered us free drinks and appetizers (and he mentioned the vegetarian appetizers specifically....).  So, they had wonderful service recovery for two folks who clearly were not as swanky as the rest of their clientele.  

Now, for the food - my husband ate every bit of the Chilean sea bass and another seafood appetizer that I can't remember.  My salad was ok (got the one with beet dressing). It could've had a better greens to toppings ratio.  I also got the chile relleno - if you love cheesy goodness, then this is right up your alley.  I also had the brussel sprouts - they were a little crunchier than expected for me, but that's just personal preference. Their moscato was delicious as well. I would've liked to try a dessert, but by the time we finished, we'd been there an awful long time so we were ready to leave.

I won't be returning unless they add in some tempting vegetarian entrees, but if you're a foodie looking for a sophisticated dining experience, you should definitely try this place out."}
{"text":"For the record, let me start by saying that I'm thrilled to have The Flats back once again! In the midst of summer there is so much to see and do!

My boyfriend and I hopped onto the RTA train system. A short walk from Tower City and there we are, walking hand in hand on our way to check out Bold for the first time. It was probably close to 7 when we showed up. No wait, and we even found seats at the bar. 

I was able to try a taste of a Bordeaux Blanc. It's exactly what you might think - dry because of the Bordeaux grape, but white, light, and refreshing. (I had two glasses.) They have a full bar. Cocktails are $12 each, beer on tap and bottled, and of course, a decent selection of wines to choose from.

We split the East Bank salad - which they actually did split for us. It's great! Baby kale, pecans, a surprise of quinoa, light dressing... once again, really refreshing for the summer evening.

I ended up eating a small plate - the Grilled Octopus. Mmmm. The buttery octopus mixed well with cucumbers and hearts of palm - I was absolutely stuffed. The portions are huge!

Speaking of portions, babe got a ridiculous (in the good way) sandwich. The Bold Club. Good god. We both actually walked into this one thinking I'd sneak some bites, but I was just too full and he ended up taking home leftovers. 

He ordered the fries - I'm a fry connoisseur over here - and they DID NOT dissappoint. They're fried with garlic and however they season 'em, it's like they have a hint of malt vinegar minus the \"soggy fry\" syndrome that tends to occur when they get drenched. 

The atmosphere is swanky and party-like. Everyone was dressy casual - it set the mood perfectly for Friday date night.

Two thumbs up - I plan to come back again - maybe next time for those oysters. ;-)"}
{"text":"Came here with a few friends for dinner and drinks. We tried to make a same day reservation but they were booked until 9:30PM so make sure you get your reservations in early!
We ended up finding seats at the bar. I ordered a red wine and the kobe beef salad. The salad was great! Could have used a little more dressing but the meat was cooked excellent. 
The ambiance and d√©cor were great. Will return with reservations next time!"}
{"text":"We came here on a Thursday evening for a family Christmas dinner celebration. We had octopus and lobster nacho appetizers which were excellent. Super fresh and very tasty for the pickiest of eaters. We ordered the sirloin steaks and the NY strip steak which were cooked to perfection. We each ordered a side but they are big enough to share. We got mashed potatoes, Brussel sprouts, cream corn, broiled vegetables. All were yummy and tasted great. Mashed potatoes were good but the others were better. We also got desserts. I would say they were small but loved them. The chocolate cake was very rich like fudge, the key lime pie was perfect and the creme Brule was the winner. My one complaint was my drinks were horrible. I had to choke down an amaretto sour first,  didn't want to complain but sour mix was definitely off. So I ordered a Mai Tai assuming no sour mix but it was just as bad. This time I made the waiter take it back and got a Cosmo martini. Again, this tasted like pure vodka crap. Husband had a delicious walnut manhatten. Our waiter Shawn was personable and attentive."}
{"text":"Eveything was fresh with very good flavors, I would definitely recommend a meal here. We had the shrimp tacos (delicious!), the lobster nachos (good!) calamari (very good) and the kale and quinoa salad (very generous size and really fresh). Eveything was extremely tasty and portions were great. The smaller plates are appetizers so perfect for sharing. The drinks we're good but nothing that blew me away. Service was very nice. If I'm in Cleveland again some day, I'll come back."}
{"text":"I came here on a Sunday afternoon after a play. The atmosphere is gorgeous. I sat at the bar and the bartender was attentive and so sweet. I got the honey cured duck breast and a side of brussel sprouts. Everything was delicious. The only thing I would recommend is more of the cornbread stuffing with my entree. So good!! Bathrooms were clean and staff were so nice. The price point is not too outrageous for the quality of food and plate presentation. There is a large parking lot across the street. Parking was a pain in the ass only because I have to pay for being there less than an hour after already paying at the other parking garage for my play. But that's not the restaurants fault. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Chris was our server and very nice , good service . Split the lobster Mac and cheese (16$) and the Amish tacos (9$) with my sister . Wasn't filling , very small portions . 16$ for a small plate of Mac and cheese that wasnt warm and not amazing . Would be more satisfied if we got more for what we paid , but food was good."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. This is right down on the new flats. Watched fireworks from here!! We think this place is a winner"}
{"text":"The NY Strip was one of the best steaks I've EVER tasted !!!  After a tour of the new Flats East Bank we arrived half hour before closing with no other diners present so wife was concerned about kitchen closing soon & them possibly sacrificing quality. Our waiter Michele checked with the kitchen & they gave him the OK. Happily the service nor quality was sacrificed. Michele gave recommendations & we ordered the Shrimp tacos Fried Oysters Garlic Mashed potatoes & of course the steak. Fresh ingredients executed flawlessly that had our taste buds happy. We'll definitely be returning!!!  Guess what we returned within 48hrs with our best friends who were also celebrating their anniversary  (same weekend 2 yrs earlier) This time we loaded up & between the 4 of us we nearly got half of the full menu  Bottom line is this is now Wifey & ours Favorite restaurant. Oh we did return again for her birthday in November to try even more of the menu. BRAVO !!"}
{"text":"A lot of potential but.....
The restaurant looks great. Apparently it is now owned by the people behind Aladdin's so they have a good track record. All in all it was pretty good, however, there were several things that really kept us from enjoying it more (as it should have been). We were seated in the rear dining room which is lovely and actually a little bit quieter which makes conversation easier. The downside was that it was freezing in there. Easily 10 degrees colder than the front dining room. After ordering drinks, we mentioned to our server about the temperature and she said that she would talk to management. She did and it was made warmer (just not warm enough). By the time that our food arrived, every single person in the dining room (and all of the tables were filled since it was a Saturday night) that had a coat or a sweater was now wearing it. The apps were good. I forget what all we had but I do remember the seafood/avocado/pico de gallo and would recommend it. One member had the chili relleno and declared it the best he had every had. I had the chicken which came out with ice cold garlic mashed potatoes. I asked for them to be reheated and when they returned the chicken was now rendered bone dry. I didn't have the heart to send it back again so I sucked it up. Service was good but pretty slow. I'm guessing that they are still in their learning curve. Two more diners had entrees that they enjoyed but both said how much more enjoyable the experience would have been if we all hadn't been freezing. We will likely be back but we certainly could have enjoyed our first visit a whole lot more than we did."}
{"text":"The service was wonderful and the ambiance was definitely lovely. The food had a lot going for it and we enjoyed our diner, but I have to agree with many other reviewers that the prices are just too high. Because of the value overall, I'm giving Bold 3 rather than 4 stars. 

The menu shows some creativity with a nice variety of options. We decided to try the Brussel sprouts and the burger. First off, the ketchup was made in house and had amazing flavor. I typically don't use ketchup, but I licked the little cup it was served in clean. The burger patty itself was perfectly cooked and juicy, but it lacked seasoning and had a couple tough pieces. The burger's toppings weren't as flavorful as I'd expected except for the bacon, which I found overwhelming of the others. The bun was nice. The sprouts had a nice sauce and were cooked perfect. The toppings weren't impressive though. The Craisins were fine, the pepitas didn't add anything. There weren't enough of them for texture and something more salty would have balanced the other flavors better, like maybe some of that bacon. 

The cocktail I had was good. Our overall experience was pleasant. I just don't know that I'd be a regular here due to the pricing. There's just too many options for good food with better prices. Bold is certainly good and worth a visit!"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good. The interior is pretty cool but it's a little tight. I would suggest using valet parking out front to speed up the experience."}
{"text":"Pros: diverse menu and tasty food

Cons: very slow service-my party waited over 45 minutes for our entrees to come out and then when several of them arrived they were cold and needed to be remade. It took my party over three hours to get appetizers and entrees which is absolutely ridiculous. 

Overall good food but would not go back due to the poor/nonexistent service."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here on our anniversary, Bold Food & Drink rolled out the red carpet for us! They met us with a glass of champagne to help make this a memorable night. The food was great. Our waiters made great suggestions for both food and drinks. Thank you to the staff and Bold Food & Drink!"}
{"text":"Trendy, small, intimate little spot located in the revamped West Bank of the flats. BOLD is attached to the same building as a few other businesses, namely the Aloft hotel. 

For my experience, I walked in on a Friday evening and immediately sat at the bar. The bartenders were pretty attentive for the most part and made a decent Moscow Mule, thankfully served in the traditional copper mug. 

I ordered the Amish Chicken. It literally took over 30 minutes to get my food, which I felt was a bit long. They had some tables but the place wasn't packed. That aside, the chicken was good. Tender and had a very 'homey' flavor. Almost like shepherds pie. It came served on a bed of mashed potatoes with a savory brown gravy. I enjoyed it. 

Not sure I would go out of my way to come back here but I wouldn't be opposed to coming back if someone invited me. I'll update my review if I ever do. I'm not giving a 4 star when I don't feel it was earned though. Maybe next time. 

Here's my overall ratings-
Atmosphere- 3.5/5
Quality/value- 3.5/5
Food- 3.5/5
Drinks- 3.5/5
Service- 3.5/5"}
{"text":"Favorite place in downtown Cleveland, and without a doubt the nicest place in the Flats. Excellent service, inventive menu, and an experience that leaves you wanting more in all the best ways."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere down in the West Bank district. Loved over hearing the live music while watching the sports car drive by. The Amish chicken is a classic and super flavorful. I had the buttermilk salad and was shocked at how fresh and tasty it was. The hit may have been the side of roasted veggies - I love garlic! 

Definitely a fun spot for dinner during a night on the town!"}
{"text":"Kudos to the chef! The food was fantastic! However, I had some questions about the entrees. I asked about the veal Milanese vs the salmon. The server recommended the veal. Don't get me wrong: it was delicious! But PLEASE NOTE: this entree could have fed the entire table of four! We were attending the baseball game after dinner so couldn't take a to-go box. Wish the server had been more attentive about this!"}
{"text":"It is really difficult to put into words the dining experience we had at Bold last night. We started with the Lobster nachos, then added an octopus appetizer which was equally as delicious as the lobster. Our waitor Charlie invented a sampler dish so we could taste the best of everything chicken, steak and lobster and it was so delicious. The head chef Brandon (i wish I knew his last name) came out to meet us then brought out a tray of three spectacular desserts that we had with a glass of port wine. We honestly felt like royalty. Charlie went out of his way to make our meal so memeorable it made us cry. They took us away from reality for the night, because today my brother-in-law will begin to battle his pancreatic cancer. Thank you doesn't seem to be a big enough word for the truly memorable evening, yet the hug at the door from both of you before we left will be carried with us throughout this battle."}
{"text":"I recommend Bold for a nice evening out for good food and nice ambiance. We had a party of 8 and went for our annual Christmas Dinner - everyone enjoyed the food - from our salads to main entrees and dessert (best creme br√ªl√©e I've ever had). 

The cream corn side and Brussels were very good. I would pass on the mashed potatoes next time. The filet was on point along with the halibut special. 


The service was great, until the restaurant got busy and it slowed quite a bit near the end of the meal. Also, they were out of the wine we ordered twice and brought out bottles coating double what we'd originally ordered, hence the four stars instead of five.  

All in all a nice dining experience and will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"The food here is great! Entrees were reasonably priced, and the ambiance is great. Not too fancy for a group of friends, but not too low key to rule out date night. The bar in particular is a nice touch. The bottles take up shelf after shelf! 

The food is great, I had the burger ($13), and the Braised Octopus ($18). I did find it a little odd why the Octopus app was so pricey, but the flavor helped make up for that somewhat. 

The drink selection was excellent. They had Blanton's at the bar (something that as of recently, is becoming hard to find, for some reason), and while you won't find any Pappy's around, the liquor selection is still expansive.

Service was attentive, but the kitchen seemed slow, especially considering the fact we were one of two tables. Not to the point of being ridiculous, but I did knock a star for that. I'll be back...there's plenty left on the menu I'd like to try."}
{"text":"They have $2 tacos on Tuesdays!  The pork ones are the best - there was a bit too much mayo and the flavor of the fish was sort of lost in the fish tacos.

We also tried the walleye and the duck.  The walleye was cooked and flavored very well, and was served on top of a very delicious potato hash.  The cornbread that came with the duck was amazing, but the duck was very rare, and therefore very chewy.

The service was a little bit slow."}
{"text":"We had high hopes for this place based on other reviews we read. We made 8 pm reservations for our anniversary last weekend. We arrived around 7:30 and asked if any chance we could get in early since it appeared there were many open tables. No luck, as we were told they were short staffed and to check back in around 8. Hostess didn't even get our name however. No big deal. We had a drink at the bar. Unfortunately the vibe was a bit irritating as we listened to the bartender and servers grumble about how busy they were etc. Again, restaurant  looked kind of empty as it was a gorgeous day out and a summer festival was going on in the flats there. We checked back in for our reservation ten after 8 and was told it would still be a while. We walked around outside and came back around 8:30 and still had to wait 10 minutes. What's the point of a reservation exactly? Service was fair; server seemed busy and didn't check in as often. Food was Ok, nothing I am dying to have again (cheese board, lettuce wraps). Took several requests to get a water to go along with my wine and extra bread for the cheese board (didn't come until our entrees were then out). Our experience was sub par but I wasn't planning on leaving a review. However, upon checking our bank account we were overcharged ten dollars (left cash tip-still 20% for some reason) so the final amount should not have been confusing or altered. Management had some lame reason behind the reason for this \"server had two checks the exact same amount\" and apparently they will refund us the overcharged amount. All in all it was a disappointing date night for us! Maybe they just had a busy day and were under staffed-it happens...but the way it was handled or managed was a bummer. We will try somewhere else before heading back here again."}
{"text":"The food was beyond amazing - The chef, Brandon, personally came to our table to welcome us.  His recommendations were spot on - The best food I have had in the Cleveland area.  The hostess was pleasant and our server was gracious, friendly andattentive.  Definitely coming back.  I  highly recommend this place for drinks, apps and dinner!!!"}
{"text":"Being familiar with Demetrios' other fine places, Forage and Oak Barrel, coming here was a no-brainer. The menu showcases a lot of the other local suppliers found on its sister restaurants' menu, which is not a bad thing. Unlike the other two, it cranks the prices up a notch to match the fancier setting and adds a \"Bold\" section of the menu where your protein is charred at nuclear temperatures. Sounds gimmicky, but it works. Everything we had lived up to our high expectations, and the space is lovely. My sole nit to pick is that this would not be my first choice to take one of my vegetarian friends. Pescatarians can find plenty to love, though."}
{"text":"Excellent upscale food with a classy atmosphere. The restaurant staff was very welcoming and helpful. They offer to take your coat to the closet to keep the bulk away from the table. Our waitress was very friendly and knowledgable about the entire restaurant menu.

The food was fantastic. I ordered the shrimp tacos and the calamari. I am a little bit of a seafood fanatic so I tend to be a little judgmental. The calamari I thought was a touch overcooked (rubbery). I like my calamari to freshly snap on a lite bite. As far as the shrimp tacos, no critiques needed. My wife enjoyed her burger, which mind you, has 2 strips of bacon on top that are probably about 1/4-1/2 inch thick each! Amazing! Especially when your partner ordering the burger dislikes bacon. Score! We will be making frequent visits back!"}
{"text":"It's been a long time since I had an absolutely all around amazing dinning experience. Earlier tonight my boyfriend and I stopped into Bold. The food was was absolutely delicious! The steak was full of flavor and cooked beautifully. Everything on the plate was perfect. Thank you so much to the chef that was working tonight ! Another big thank you to our amazing server/bartender Fielden (sorry if I totally butchered that spelling.) He was very kind and knowledgeable. Definitely coming back thanks to him! I'm glad my boyfriend and I found our new favorite place."}
{"text":"After the Yelp dinner at Bold, I've been wanting to come back. My boyfriend and I took advantage of the nice day and biked to the flats during the World Series Indians game.  We sat at the bar and had some cocktails and appetizers. I ordered the Pirates Mai Tai and he got a Tom Collins. Both were tasty and strong! We snacked on the bacon wrapped dates- those little dudes are the perfect flavor combo! Sweet dates, crispy bacon, stuffed with spicy chorizo...Mmmmmmm! I could eat platefuls of those dates. We also ordered the fries to snack on. There were huge hunks of garlic in the fries, which should have been easy to avoid, but one was wedged into the few fries I grabbed. The little garlic surprise lingered long after we left Bold. But I would rather the garlic be there than have bland fries. 
The bartender was friendly, but took a bit to get his attention (I don't blame him, everyone had there eyes on the game!) He was honest about his favorites (and least favorite) menu items, which I always appreciate. Sitting at the bar was really a perfect place to watch the Indians. We had a great view of the TV and it wasn't stupid busy like a sports bar might be.  Bold is versatile: You can dine there for classy night out or watch the Indians in the World Series! Either way, you won't be disappointed !"}

{"text":"This place has ENORMOUS potential but the reason for the low rating is their terrible service. We arrived 10 minutes prior to our reservation time and immediately got seated. The server came out pretty quickly to get our drink order but after that everything seemed to move at a snails pace. All of our beverages from the bar took at least 10 minutes. They were simple too, like a beer or glass of wine. We ordered appetizers and they were tiny as depicted on the menu but they were delicious. It took 45 minutes to get our entr√©es. Honestly I think the waiter forgot to submit the order because it was not busy whatsoever. When our food did finally arrive it was tasty however almost all of our entr√©es were cold. One guy in our party even asked for new fries because his were ice cold. They forgot about those too... The manager did come out and apologize and said he would make amendments on the bill. Not sure how much since I did not pay for dinner. 

Service is such a huge part of the restaurant business. Even though our food was good, the terrible horrible service overshadowed it. Will not be back and our Cleveland family is already telling others to stay away."}
{"text":"Took my husband for his birthday. They are located in the former Ken Stewart's. The wait staff was very pleasant and accommodating. We ordered the cornmeal crusted oysters and the duck fat wings. Both were very tasty. I had the shrimp and grits, must admit it lands in the top of my list as the best! Large, succulent shrimp and the dish was very filling! Had the madagascar creme brulee for desert - and it was very good as well! The food was pricey but good!"}
{"text":"I heard different reviews about the food here, so I thought I give it a shot! I came here on a Thursday night with some friends and it was very empty inside. Sat down right away and our server was very attentive and she had a continued smile on her face! 

I actually didn't know between the yellow-fin tar-tar or the mahi-mahi lettuce wraps so the server surprised me! 

The mahi-mahi came out and it was a very small portion, which honestly I thought it would come with a little more. But, the whole dish itself was pretty flavorful! (Didn't realize the red peppers on there were spicy though!) 

My friends got the chicken dish with a side of brussels, the Chilean pepper, and the wedge salad! The presentations of all the food were beautiful. 
I thought they did a good job in a timely manner and the food was pretty tasty too! We also got key lime pie for dessert which was so silky and smooth - delicious! Great job chefs and new pastry chef! Looking forward to coming here again soon."}

no - not the new construction
a bold new sparkle

Without a doubt, Bold is my new fave in Cleveland. Recently it opened in the previous Ken Stewart location, and I gave it some time to get set and roll.  I'm glad I did not wait any longer. The other night I had a absolutely perfect dinner there, and am still in awe.  Thank god the menu is not yet another designer burger, another pork belly, and another short rib entree, and the ubiquitous salmon entree.  This seems to be the new normal.  (boring,,,,)   Bold has an adventurous and well thought out menu.  The price point is spot on to keep it from being a special occasion place.  
But the food!  Chef Demetrios is a very talented man at combining flavors without them becoming to busy.  Less is more. To much -just because you can- is a muddy mess.  Lets start with the grilled octopus salad.  The octopus was grilled to perfection, and it was just the right amount. Tossed with a light dressing, cherry tomatoes, feta, watercress it would have been outstanding. The addition of hearts of palm made it perfection. I'd eat a triple sized portion on a hot summer day. Grilled corn in January is a risk, but this was sweet as corn in August.  I assumed it would be served removed from the cob, but it was not.  Cutting the cobs in half and skewering them made it so much easier to eat as well.  Served on a bed of chili crema with cojita cheese took a simple corn cob to a new level.  We had a ribeye and a NY strip as well.   I prefer a ribeye at medium to render some of the fat, and the strip at medium rare as it is leaner.  Both were flawless.  The bartender was charming and professional. She gave us a solid recommendation on wine. 
This was one of those special nights when it all fell together. Food, service, atmosphere....  It's tough to hit that trifecta, but this place will do it.


Carry on."}
{"text":"Great place to grab some solid food and drinks at the Flats. The cornmeal crusted Walleye with shrimp whipped mashed potatoes was insanely good, and the service was excellent overall."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! A sister restaurant to Forage, one of my favorite restaurants in Lakewood, when I found that out, I had to try this place out. I'm so glad I did. First of all, fantastic atmosphere. Very nice, but not stuffy at all. Cozy and relaxing. The food is out of this world. Delicious and unique, but familiar and easy to eat. Spring for the charred plates. My husband and I got the steak and the salmon and both were worth every penny. We have plans to return for my birthday dinner very soon."}
{"text":"Been here twice for dinner and once for a drink, all three times were pretty good. However, I prefer their sister restaurant, Forage, but live much closer to this one. Their menu is a bit smaller and pricier, but has a more upscale vibe. I had their duck which was recommended by the chef to be prepared medium rare, and my only complaint was that it could have been seared longer, as there was too much fat on it, despite the duck being cooked to medium rare. In their defense, we did order later in the evening while they were busy, and they were probably trying to get food out as soon as possible. Otherwise, the dish was amazing and a perfect blend of ingredients. The cornbread stuffing with the berries and honey were a different combination that worked very well together. I also had the burger another time, it was very good. The fries had cumin in the seasoning which our guests didn't like, but they tasted good, as well. I look forward to returning in the summer time and enjoying the outdoor patio!"}
{"text":"Six of us descended upon Bold on Christmas Eve with moderate expectations. Six of us left Bold being extremely impressed with the selection, quality of food, and service. If I have time later I'll include what menu items were had but suffice it to say it was a WIDE variety from deviled eggs to various salads to chicken to burgers and it was ALL exceptionally well prepared and presented. 

It truly was a pleasant surprise and we all agreed we need to return--and soon."}
{"text":"Dined here with friends and my horribly picky husband and I can't say enough good things. We made a reservation with Open Table which was super easy. Our server, Pete, was incredible and knowledgeable. He answered every question we threw at him, and there were a lot. He also told us how he came to live in Cleveland, which was just super interesting to hear! 

We got the street corn and the berratta plate for appetizers. For entrees, shrimp & hominy grits, steak kebabs, filet mignon, and the Amish chicken. If you want the pomme frites, get them with truffle oil! 

Definitely recommend Bold and can't wait to take my parents!"}
{"text":"We went for restaurant week this past Friday night. It wasn't very busy, but our food took forever. Like an insanely long time. The waiter was nice and apologized, saying the owner had come in unexpectedly and requested a table for 15. I get things happen but it leads to some unhappy customers. My cocktail and wine were great, but my boyfriend said his Guinness tasted off. I had the 8 oz sirloin which was delicious but the garlic mashed potatoes were blah.  My boyfriend described his club sandwich as just ok. The good parts of the meal were overshadowed by the long wait time. I understand this may have been a one time thing but it will be awhile before we go back."}
{"text":"Staying at the aloft making this place very convenient. My last review wasn't so nice but, after my past 2 experiences I need to update. Excellent appetizers are grilled octopus, Chile's rellenos,street corn and shrimp tacos. I've had the steak kabobs twice and will have then again tonight"}
{"text":"So we originally decided to try this place because of Downtown Cleveland Restaurant Week. I made a reservation and knew what I wanted to order based on the preset menu. The night before our reservation I look at the menu to refresh my memory and it's different. That was pretty disappointing.

We headed there tonight anyways. The ambiance is nice - urban chic. Our waiter was great. One thing that bothered me was that they didn't offer the restaurant week menu. It always bother me when restaurants choose to participate and then don't hand you the menu.

Both my hubby and I decided to order off of the regular menu anyways. We started with the dates and street corn and both were fabulous. Great flavor - I just wish we had more of them! 

For our entrees, I selected the shrimp tacos which was technically an appetizer but they were tasty and filling. My husband ordered the burger and thought it was really good, especially the thick cut bacon. The fries were really good with fresh herbs and garlic."}
{"text":"I love to go here for the lunch specials-they are amazing. The burgers and gyros are delicious. They use locally grown and farm raised ingredients. The service is always prompt and courteous. I would give this place five stars if it was not for the disgusting mac and cheese. It is bitter and lacks flavor. The salad that comes with it is even worse- it is bitter and the texture is rough. If you want good mac n cheese I suggest you go to a soul food restaurant such as Angies."}
{"text":"Came here with 5 friends with a reservation on a Saturday early evening. Food was great, everything was cooked and seasoned very well, portion sizes were good too. I got a small plate, the stuffed quail. The quail was not as tender as I hoped, but that might be because of the bird. It was very flavorful and seasoned well though, as well as bed of creamed corn it was served on. The lobster nachos were very tasty, but they really could've given a couple more than four chips. My friends ordered the Amish chicken, lobster roll, steak, and fish and chips. The fish and chips was interesting, small battered fried fish rather than the typical. No complaints though. Great service, food came out very quickly."}
{"text":"I have been to Bold several times for lunch and the staff are always friendly and knowledgeable and the food is always superb. Tonight I went to bold for a work dinner with about 12 people. Charlie and Sean took excellent care of us - they were extremely knowledgeable and made for a really fun dining experience. Chef Brandon was kind enough to come out to the table and couldn't have been more personable and humble and everyone in the group had a truly enjoyable experience. The food? Fantastic! The calamari was so light and flavorful, he little devils had the perfect pairing of salty and savory, and the filet was fabulous. I would highly recommend Bold for a casual lunch or an evening out. Thanks Bold for a great night!!"}
{"text":"Everything about Bold was awesome! The service was excellent and the staff was very friendly. My sister and I ordered a few tiny plates and loved them all! The fried oysters are so delicious and the texture was perfect. The duck wontons were nice and crispy on the outside and very flavorful on the inside. The lobster nachos had a great combination of flavor. The complimentary chorizo stuffed bacon wrapped dates were a wonderful surprise! We love dates and these were the best stuffed dates we've ever had! Can't wait to go back again and share this place with family and friends!"}
{"text":"I'm so conflicted on writing a review for this place because the food actually tastes REALLY good. The layout of the restaurant is sexy and swank, but for some strange reason the whole entire concept and menu BORED me. I don't think I would ever come back. It reminded me of an upscale version of a tired chain restaurant such as Applebee's. The menu had absolutely nothing \"different\" or signature within it. Just a hodgepodge of dishes that someone would think to be served at an upscale restaurant. 

If you're looking for something \"different\" or unique in Cleveland then don't even bother. If you're just looking for your run of the mill, upscale dishes..within in a place that looks nice...at \"reasonable\" prices then you should DEFINITELY give this place a go. 

In essence. I would truly give this place 3 stars, but my dinner tasted entirely too good for me to do that. I personally prefer quirky...\"different\" restaurants and this establishment definitely did not fit that description."}
{"text":"The server we had was polished, very attentive and helpful, and extremely knowledgeable about the menu items. The person that sat us when we first arrived was the one to bring our food to the table. He was also very knowledgeable about the menu and not only named each dish as he set it down, but mentioned several ingredients in each. He also came by to see how everything was later in the meal in addition to our waiter. The service here gets a 5 star rating.

The place was also really cozy. The restaurant is not large. Bold certainly could have fit a lot more tables in the restaurant, but instead they opted for larger booths and tables, which made for a more personalized and private feeling dining experience. 

The menu has lots of options. You can get a full entree or something served a la carte and choose one of nearly a dozen larger sides to share. I chose a filet off the a la carte menu, which consists of various beef and fish options all charred at 1400 degrees. My filet was delicious and I liked the preparation, though the wine reduction on the steak was surprisingly very traditional and therefore a bit boring for Bold. At $33 I thought the price, of the filet and all menu items in general, were lower than at similar restaurants.  

For sides I chose the Garlicky Green Beans. For being in the name, garlic didn't stand as a prominent ingredient. Their preparation was also not my favorite - they were almost in a gravy. The Garlic Whipped Potatoes were good, light and fluffy. The White Truffled Cream Corn was delicious; I would have just liked it a bit thicker. 

For appetizers I tried the Cornmeal Crusted Oysters. The spicy mayo that went with it was good and the breading wasn't too thick. I'd order these again. The Deviled Eggs (Stuffed Pasture Raised Eggs) were good, the yoke was highly whipped, and the seasoning good. You only get 2 in an order. The stuffed dates (Little Devils) were delicious - again 2 in an order. These rise to the top of the list for best stuffed dates out of at least 4 other places I can think of having them recently. They were stuffed full with chorizo and accompanied with some sriracha which was a great flavor combo. 

All that taken into consideration the food was just average. It was far from bad, but nothing really wowed me or exceeded expectations, aside from the service. I probably won't crave Bold, but I wouldn't hesitate going back if a chance presented itself."}
{"text":"The absolute best walleye I've ever had!! Fielding, our care taker for the evening is
Now my husbands new BFF . He made my birthday dinner so very special. Awesome wine list! Love love love this place. Wish it was closer to Canton , but so worth the drive."}
{"text":"Great find on a recent business trip. It's in a cool area close to the river and it was the perfect night to sit on the patio. We had the Thai lettuce wraps, chile relleno and blue cornmeal crusted oysters. All were excellent. Heard the drinks were great too. Reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Being from Chicago I have had my share of great steaks. BOLD is not on that list. Nice service and the place itself is virtually unchanged from the previous Ken Stewart's Steak House. The steak wasn't cooked correctly and had no flavor. You would expect more from a NY strip. Look for something's else. You'll be happier for it."}
{"text":"I eat at Bold very often because I work close by and because they have amazing food.  I have never had a bad meal.  Creative dishes and high quality ingredients.  Try the walleye for dinner, it is out of this world.  Tacos are delicious, salads and sandwiches are fantastic.  I highly recommend Bold Food & Drink."}
{"text":"The restaurant was very stylish and neat! It was a group of 7 for Mother's Day and our waitress was awesome! It took our food very long but it was worth the wait! The waitress was nice and gave us dessert! Bold, is great place to relax thru the week or weekend. CLEVELAND ROCKS!"}
{"text":"Would definitely recommend. My husband and I went in New Year's Eve. It's a very cozy atmosphere and the food was amazing. We were splurging so we tried a few apps (quail and Devils) and got the special which was sea bass and the burger with the fried egg. Our waiter, Michele, was so wonderful! He was able to recommend items and was very engaging. We met the owner and chef who were both very personable and you can tell they really care about their restaurant !"}
{"text":"This place is great. The food is top notch. 
Last night was my second try for this place. Both times were awesome. 
Starting with the atmosphere. It's a bit less intimate and a bit more fun than some of the other high end food spots but I like that about it. 
Second, service was great.
Third, the menu was varied and had food at multiple price points which was nice.

Ok, now, the important part. The food! Overall I'd say this place is up there food quality-wise with places like Lola and Dante. We had a group of 6 so we started with a bunch of small plates. 
Lobster nachos - way bigger portion than I expected. Really good bites. Perfect seasoning - but not too much. 
Chile Rellenos - LOVED the spice on this. So stuffed with delicious cheese. Went great with the complimentary bread at the table. 
Corn - Treated great but eating corn on the cob isn't for me the fe of an appetizer food. But, that said, it tasted good. 
French fries - how can these be bad? Much bigger portion than I thought. 
Octopus salad - OMG. You have to get this. If you are thinking, \"octopus, that's gross\" then you haven't tasted this. It's perfectly cooked. The salad compliments it so well. You need this dish. 

For dinner I had the beef short rib. It was cooked so tender. No knife needed. And the grits that came with? Rich and cheesy. This dish was very heavy and I had enough (after all those apps) for lunch the next day. The hubs had the Mahi Mahi such was also very good. 

For dessert, don't skip the flourless chocolate torte. I don't even love chocolate but this was fantastic. 

Overall, I definitely think we'll be back very soon to try some other things on the menu."}
