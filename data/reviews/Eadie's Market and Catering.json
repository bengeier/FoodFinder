{"text":"We live in Virginia and 2 of our great friends live in Pittsburgh so when they come to the DC area, they bring us Eadie's delicious cake.  We had it the first time at our friend's birthday and since then, it's a must have for every occasion.  The Eadie's cakes are soft, not too sweet, same with the frosting which is creamy, not too sweet, smooth and just simply the best!  We like all the cakes and tthe 2 layer chocolate/vanilla is the best of both worlds.  We wish there was an Eadie's nearby in the DC area!!  Until then, we will have to rely on our Pitt dear friends to bring us a little piece of heaven that we find in Eadie's cakes."}
{"text":"I get food here once in a while - it isn't bad. The selection can be shotty if you get there late in the day but overall I think the food is pretty good. I'm not sure why Yelp lists the neighborhood as the Hill District, this is downtown."}
{"text":"Prices are skyrocketing and quality is dropping. I feel that the owners are getting greedy here at Eadies. Because of my work location and my busy schedule I often visit Eadies twice a day once for breakfast and once for lunch. Today my over $8 breakfast for a breakfast sandwich and a juice was horrible, sausage was burnt and the croissant was stale!!! Rather go get a made to order for less money! Usually lunch is sub-par at best! Come on Eadies I am under boycott until conditions improve~!"}
{"text":"A couple of years ago a co worker told me about this place called Eadie's Catering & Market and about how delicious their cakes were. She started to bring me a different slice every payday. I can't remember what slices of cake they were but, I can tell you that they were absolutely delicious!  Fast forward to 2014. My birthday was getting close and I couldn't decided where to get my cake from. I'm not really a big fan of Moio's in Monroeville and I had, had Oakmont Bakery cakes every year for a while now.   Then I remembered Eadie's Catering & Market in One BNY Mellon Center and how good their cakes were. They offer everything from basic cakes, cheese cakes, brownie or cookie cakes to specialty cakes and even specialty pies. I got my hands on a cake menu and made my order a few days before my big day. I went with the Raspberry Delight Specialty Cake (White cake with white butter cream icing and raspberry filing between the layers of cake.)   OMG!!! Let me just tell you that, that was one of the best cakes I have ever had in my life. Everything from the moist cake to the incredible icing made this cake spectacular and my birthday even better!"}
{"text":"Over priced if you get anything from the self-serve hot bar. Sadly I go there ever couple years and am quickly reminded why I don't get food from there.  Food is ok. Nothing great and definitely not worth the prices."}
{"text":"Eadie's is a great little place to stop in and pick up a tasty bite for lunch during a busy workweek.  A cup or bowl of hearty chili packed with juicy roasted tomatoes always warms me up and lifts my spirits on cold winter days. The chicken tortilla soup is also a good choice - perfect amount of spiciness!"}
{"text":"Hit or miss. Some days an awesome selection and other days they have nothing good.  They have steamed veggies every day which are really good. They are definitely overpriced."}
{"text":"I really like the food, specifically, chicken tender Thursday!!!! The baked goods are mostly a hit, the cakes are amazing, but sometimes things from the cooler are just so so.   The one negative I will say is that the prices for things from the hot foods bar are steep.. Lunch at Eadies is always super fresh and good, but pricey. Really the only reason this place doesn't get a five.   Also, the owner takes so much pride in her business and I think that is really important. You can tell she really cares about the experience that people have at Eadies."}
{"text":"It's a nice convenient place to grab breakfast or lunch on your way to the office. My main complaint was they require a $10 minimum purchase to use a credit card. So basically you need cash on you to go here. That was really the only thing I didn't like about the place, other than that the food was pretty decent."}
{"text":"First time I had Eadie's was at work and they ordered a cake. Delicious! Stopped in for lunch and had the peppered steak with rice and a Mancini's roll. Can u say hooked?  This is some of the best peppered steak I've ever had. Tender and seasoned to perfection. They only have it on Thursday and my waistline is happy about that."}
{"text":"Eadie's catering is absolutely fantastic. Their food is delivered fresh and hot. They also have incredibly good cakes. They are a bit on the pricey end, but they are delicious and beautifully decorated.  Eadie's also has a serve-yourself/pay by-the-pound lunch every day that varies. I'd rate that overall food as 3-stars. The crab bisque is a definite 5, but is only available on Mondays. And, their hot wings are a 5, but only come up in the rotation every few weeks.  *UPDATE* Eadie's has started having wings every Tuesday (both buffalo and Asian wings)."}
{"text":"I work right next door so Eadies is super convenient for me. Plus, in the AM if I'm hungry I can hop off the T and right in without even going outside. I don't think I've ever had a bad meal there. Everything is pretty fresh and tasty. Yummy breakfast sandwiches and pastries in the am, and lots of lunch options for the pm. Chicken tender day draws big crowds so you know those are good. Soup is what draws me in, and their selection is pretty awesome. My favorite is the Salsa Tortilla, it's just amazing and you must try it! I check their schedule our weekly to plan ahead so I don't miss it!   Worth noting, the employees are top notch. Super friendly, and efficient staff. The lines can build up but they have you out of there in no time.   The thing that I do not like about Eadies has less to do with food and more about money, and that is my reasoning for 4 stars. There is a $5 minimum on credit/debit card purchases and I really hate that.  (btw, for a while I swear it was $10 min, but the last time I was there it was $5, so I updated my review)  The prices are a little steep and I wish I could use my card for all purchases since I don't usually carry cash. Convenience and taste will have me coming back for sure, but I keep hoping the prices and minimums will change!"}
{"text":"Overpriced.  The only reason they get two stars is because they sell cheese cubes which was always nice to add to a packed lunch, but still, it was very expensive for what you get. On top of it they make you spend $10 to use a card.  I would rather grab a $5 sub across the street."}
{"text":"Love the food especially the buffalo chicken wraps and cake. Great service.....but seriously get some cup holders..............."}
{"text":"What a nice little surprise to find on the first day of spring. With this morning being on the wet side, I decided to cut through One Mellon Center on my way from my truck to the office and while doing so I discovered this little market. They've got a little self-serve buffet set up along the back of the market with breakfast items such as bacon, sausage, cheesy eggs, home fries, hash browns, quiche and breakfast sandwiches and burritos.    I helped myself to a modest helping of eggs, home fries, three strips of bacon and a cup of coffee which all came to $7.34... a bit steep I thought for a basic breakfast to go. But the eggs were delicious, the bacon was done just the way I like it (a little chewy and not too crispy) and the coffee was fresh.  My only complaint about the food was that I thought the home fries could have been cooked a little longer.  They were missing that brownish quality that I look for in home fries.  It would also be a nice touch if they offered sausage gravy. If sausage gravy was available and the home fries were a little more done, I would be there every morning and this would be a five star rating.  The cashier I dealt with was courteous yet efficient -- qualities you look for when you pick something up to eat before work.    Although it's a bit pricy for a breakfast, I can see myself stopping in here a couple of times a month for a morning treat."}
{"text":"Great food, great service! Awesome Mac and cheese on Thursdays!  Delicious cakes for any occasion! Reasonably priced for its location."}
{"text":"Awesome job making a flower bouquet cake for my co worker. Cake never disappoints, but this design and attention to detail was impeccable. The cake tasted just as delicious as it looked."}
{"text":"This place is a complete rip off at the highest level.  For breakfast, the eggs come frozen, they're not even freshly cracked and cooked eggs.  The muffin sandwiches are subpar at best, they don't even toast the english muffins at all.  Who eats untoasted english muffins?  Don't get me started on that.  Yet, they charge top dollar for the garbage they call \"food.\"    Lunchtime is a complete rip off as well, again, at the highest level.  $7.00 a pound for perogis that come frozen?  They're not even homemade!  For $7.00 I can buy a huge sack at the grocery store and prepare them better than what this place does.    The one worker there, Ray, acts like he's doing you this big favor if he has to refund your money because of the garbage they serve.  One time I complained to him about their high prices and he said, \"if you want high quality food, you pay more.\"  If this guy thinks they serve high quality food, he has no business being in the food industry.  At least McDonalds cooks freshly cracked/cooked eggs and toasts their english muffins during breakfast.    Never, ever, ever, again will I patronize this place.  Not in a million years will I ever return.  Don't even bother going here, you'll pay top dollar for garbage food."}
{"text":"The prices are the main reason I'm giving this establishment such a low rating. I work in the building they're in. A deli sandwich, poocorn, and fruit cost me $13. I could have gone to nearly any restaurant and had a full, sit-down meal for that price, tip included. The food was fine, but due to the prices, I'll never go again."}
