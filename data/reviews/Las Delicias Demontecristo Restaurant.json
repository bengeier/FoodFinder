{"text":"Comida tradicional salvadoreña, deliciosa! Las meseras son amables y profecionales, tardan en servir pero tiene sentido por que la comida es preparada en el momento, prefiero esperar a que me den comida conjelada. Precios exelentes!"}
{"text":"I love their pupusas especially when the owner makes them I have been there several times and one day I went on a Monday at lunch and a young girl was making them and they were not as good so I found out when the other lady works sat and Sundays. Her food is delicious. I highly recommend it"}
{"text":"Greasy & Salty Salvadorean Food After Marisela M. won Nuestra Belleza Latina,  her love of family granted her the good fortune of helping her family open up this Salvadorean restaurant, so we drove 4 hrs to try some Salvadorean favorites in support of this diner, but this place missed the mark at all levels.   The service was extremely slow.  They only had one server, and only one cook.  Several items that we asked for were out of stock, or not available due to refrigeration problems.  There was 5 of us, and the food was brought out in shifts,  not all together.  The prices they charge warrant better quality and quantity of their food offerings. The pupusas were extremely greasy and had very little spinach or loroco. The Central American sour cream looked like it had been watered down and had lots of salt added to cover it up. My fried eggs were rubbery, the fried sweet plantains were hard, and the casamiento (rice & beans) had no flavor.  And they don't have outdoor seating, unless you call sitting in a room that feels like a metal crate a patio.  We won't be going back !"}
{"text":"Came here once and now I'm an honest customer! I can only rate the pupusas as that is the only thing I come here for. Staff has been really nice to me on all occasions."}
{"text":"this restaurant is worth 2 stars due to their slow service! 20 min for breakfast?? really!!!! and there was only 3 customers total! never going back"}
{"text":"I love this place the pupusas are right on point very tasty, the service is a little slow but that's in every Salvadoran restaurant the most import thing this place has one of the best pupusas   in town, I was there when they got an unexpected health department visit they pass with an A\" I feel safe to eat here ..."}
{"text":"Es tan lindo llegar a un restaurante y que te hagan sentir en familia, aquí te atenderán como que si tu eres el dueño del restaurante. La comida es tan rica que vinimos más de tres veces ya!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I went here last week and the pupsas weren't only gross and greasy but made me so sick the next day. I don't think they are very clean and judging from what happened with me, they probably don't wash their hands.  My father had a shrimp cocktail and when it came out it was for pieces of shrimp and it was about $15! their empanadas are $8 for an order when i can get them at las pupusas restaurant for $3. Never ever again. I should've went to las pupusas my usual salvadorian food place, but i wanted to give this place a try. oh well."}
{"text":"This is an amazing place to dine great people salvadorean come over and eat here.   This is a delicious place to eat is clean neat has a salvadorean touch I am very happy to find this place in Vegas. Great place clean customer service is excellent food tastes delicious"}
{"text":"Hunting for non hotel non chain food in Las Vegas my daughter and I researched and went to this lovely restaurant. We couldn't decide what to order so we ordered a few things. So damn good!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic Bean Papusas. Meat ones don't have so much meat. Very tasty but too much oil for us. We patted oil off with napkins before eating. Fun laid back atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great food, just stopped by to try it. The pupusas are good.  Will definitely be back. Great staff."}
{"text":"This place was not good at all. As a Salvadorean, I have eaten many pupusas in my life and the ones I ordered were  horrible.  Honestly , they were the worst ones I have ever eaten.  The chicharron pupusas were not cooked properly and the chicharron was white! .We came to this restaurant because of the hype surrounding Marisela but the food was awful. I don't recommend this place at all"}
{"text":"Horrible dont waste your money its a joke better customer service at mcdonalds than this restaurant  AGAIN WASTE OF MONEY"}
{"text":"I'm salvadorian so I know authentic salvi food. This place is not very good the food doesn't have any flavor, they only had 1 cook and 1 waitress on a busy Saturday. Long story short I wouldn't come back EVER"}
{"text":"Solo 2 palabras \"PURA MIERDA\", es increible mirar tanto comentario bueno, y el lugar esta del Mega Nabo. Cuando llegue, me ofrecieron una bebida y pedí una ensalada q x cierto estaba \"TERRIBLE\" xq parecia agua con azucar y no tenia sabor a frutas. Pero en fin, me dispuse a mirar el menu el cual no tenia variedad d platillos, en ese instante decidi ir a comer a otro lugar, no sin antes pagar la ensalada q ya me habian dado; pero cuando le dije a la muchacha q si me la podia poner para llevar, me puso la bebida dond sirven el menudo y ni sikiera popote me dio. Tal vez lo hizo x el coraje d q no comi ahi, pero aun asi soy cliente del lugar xq consumi algo y merezco respeto. Por esa razón lugares como esos no crecen y se quedan en las sombras. Q lastima q traten asi a las personas!!!!!!.... :("}
{"text":"Delicious food. First time coming here and it won't be the last. Excellent service too!"}
{"text":"Las mejores pupusas, son Muy amables. Lo recomiendo todo lo q pobre DELICIOSO :)    Regresare la proxima vez q visite Las Vegas"}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place 0 zero stars! I can't comment on his food, the service, or the cleanliness of his place. I can comment on how rude the owner of this restaurant is. Our football team was working with an adjacent business by holding a car wash fundraiser. He single handedly ruined our fundraiser by calling the police on a group of kids and their parents who were just trying to raise money so our players can have cleats, uniforms and a successful football season. In no way was our fundraiser negatively affecting his business, in fact, people were going in to his restaurant and buying his food. We moved our cars, made sure our kids were not blocking his doors and tried to be courteous so he could have a successful business day as well. Like I said, I can't comment on his food but there are several Salvadorian restaurants in this town, so please choose to eat at another, for the simply fact that this man does no believe in charity, community, team work, or cooperation. Shame on this owner and how he runs his business!!!"}
{"text":"I came here becuse of marisela. But I was shocked to see that the restaurant was not what I thought it was. Very small place pupusas were not that good, service was bad.  there was one young waitress not friendly customer service could  have been better. Not going back."}
{"text":"It was very clean environment , they have really good food,I recomend this place whoever wants to to eat  Salvadorian food, the Pupusas are really yummy!"}
{"text":"Excelente restaurante , el servicio al cliente es de lo mejor . Las comida muy rica . Yo si recomiendo este lugar .   Great customer service and the food taste amazing . I do recommend this place ."}
{"text":"Best pupusas in town with a clean environment. I will not go anywhere else. Im glad my aunt found this gem."}
{"text":"What can I say, the pupusas were great, and so were the empanadas. I will be coming back next time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I really love this place !! The food taste just like the old country , homemade and fresh .  I come here all the time now."}
{"text":"I see a lot of people dogging on the papusas... I don't get it. The papusas could change someone's religion. Everyone I have talked to about the place agree that the bean & cheese papusas are to die for. Great place to feed a whole family."}
{"text":"Is funny the previous reviews, this people just because they go to las vegas they were expecting a Pupuseria caesars palace style and they don't even know the story about this Pupuseria, firstly is not maricela's Pupuseria or maricela's business, maricela opened this place for her mother, I'm from los Angeles CA and me and my wife we went to las vegas for our anniversary and we decided to go take a look and try this place because we have been following maricela's career, because we are very proud of her, and we can say that is an authentic salvadorean food, we tried the pupusas , mariscada and sopa de res, everything was exquisite, we meet maricela's mother and sister, and wow, they are very nice, we highly recommend this place, from now on every time we'll go to las Vegas, definitely will be in our list of things to do"}
{"text":"Wow, this place was way too expensive. The rice was stale and flavorless, the pupusas were greasy and really, this isn't what I'd call quality Salvadoran food, considering I am Salvadoran. For the prices they charge you'd expect humongous portions, but nope! Does Las Vegas have an actual good Salvadoran place? Who knows... the only thing that were slight OK were the pupusas. Everything else was meh."}
{"text":"Good food! Everything was really good. Pupusas, plantains and soup (chicken). Pineapple soda was good too."}
{"text":"Wow I hate to give a place with a really good pupusas such a low rating but the service was really bad and the funny thing is that there was only two tables being occupied. Only one cook and only one waitress who once we got our food forgot about us and even when I called her over took forever to come and forgot part 2 of my request. I think the authentic flavor of this location can really hit it big except they need to step it up a notch ! Awesome food but taking to go next time, place is really hot a/c needs to be turned on. Omg I'm almost temped to lower one more star but the quality keeps it at 3"}
{"text":"Small establishment and doesn't look that fancy on the outside but don't let that deter you. We went today for dinner and the staff was super nice and attentive. It was pretty empty but we noticed like 10 people come in for to go orders so that might be what most customers do. We ordered an array of items from the menu since everything looked so delicious. We were not disappointed. Not only did we devour everything in our initial order but ended up ordering a few additional items. Everything is also very reasonably priced.  I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Me encanta este lugar especialmente por el sabor único de la comida un toque salvadoreño que pocos restaurantes pueden ofrecer"}
{"text":"Good food but really shity  service. The service was so bad I won't be back. I gave a 3 star rating based on food alone. Really sad because they could be a really busy place otherwise."}
