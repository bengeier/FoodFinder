{"text":"I'll start off by saying, I did enjoy the French Onion Soup I ordered. It was labelled market price, which turned out to be $15 (for a small portion). Can't really fault them for this, because I could've asked. 

The reason I am rating this restaurant 1 star is because of the atrocious service I received. I would like to preface this by saying, I don't give a crap about service most of the time. I am all for neglectful waiters, as long as my food is good. But this place deserves a special mention.

We had a group of 5 people show up on a Tuesday night. It was almost 9:30pm at this point, and the restaurant was mostly empty. We were just looking for something warm up ourselves with. Tea, wine, soup. We did not order any entrees, so I'll admit our spend was low. That being said, they had an empty bar and there were more than enough seats left at the restaurant.  

Within 10-minutes after receiving our orders. The waiter comes by and tells us a \"group had called and will be coming soon\" and presented us with our bill. Basically, asking us to leave asap and he was \"apologetic\". Like I said earlier, we were a low spend group. I get why they needed to kick us out and not lose business. We agreed without an issue, and said we would try to finish up fast or leave as soon as the group gets here. 

We asked the waiter to split our bill. He said, they do not \"split for a party of our size\", really? 5 people? Then we asked if we could pay individually on card. Again, nope. I understand restaurants have policies, but not sure why he couldn't throw us a bone... cus you were basically kicking us out? 

Oh and the the cherry on top was... After we finished our food, and settled the bills ... The  \"group coming soon!!\" NEVER CAME. So basically, unless everyone at your table is planning to get an entree and some. Don't bother coming. They don't take plebs who aren't planning to drop $$$ on a three course meal."}
{"text":"Corktown Kitchen never disappoints. Friendly staff, a fully stocked bar, and an intimate venue always mean a good time. 

I have had a number of dishes at TCK and haven't been disappointed. The octopus was particularly good. The hamburger is AMAZING. I understand some people may balk at the price, but it is a huge, perfectly cooked burger that is juicy and flavourful. I wanted to finish it - because it was so delicious - but it was too much for me, and trust me when I say I have a very healthy appetite! Easily the best burger I've had in the city, and there are some damn good burgers out there. The steak frites is a safe bet - also cooked perfectly, and definitely worth the money. Very pleased to have a noteworthy resto in the neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"I made a reservation for a birthday dinner here for 10 people and a baby. while we had decent food and service during our time here, I got a call later that night expressing their disappointment that we made a reservation for 11 people and only 6 people ordered entrees and thus, costing them \"$500\". Now, I admit we only had 9 adults show up due to a last minute cancellation but I think it is ridiculous that at a place that has no minimum charge, all of my guests were required to order entrees. Certainly the baby didn't have to - and 7 out of my guests did order entrees and the other two guests ordered a side or a drink. I am not coming back here after the way I was treated!"}
{"text":"Late lunch with husband and a great experience.  From the bartender, Dakota, to the chef/owner, Matt, it was a special meal.  Spicy, crispy beef sandwich and salmon with amazing slaw had our mouths watering when dishes placed before us.  Only wish we lived in the area, as we would definitely make this one a regular \"go to\", fresh ingredients, dining spot."}
{"text":"Second visit, this time for Sunday brunch. The menu is not extensive but that contributes to fresh tasting, unique dishes. We both tried specials: Apple Pomegranate French Toast (great) and the daily omelet (really nice flavours). Love the atmosphere, service was friendly and good, even though it was the servers first day. 
Great addition to the hood!"}
{"text":"We came here on the weekend for a special dinner. I have a dietary restriction, which I had discussed with the chef, Matt, before coming. He accommodated my diet very well. All the food we ordered was perfectly cooked and delicious. Portions are very generous. Everyone who served us was very friendly and efficient. We love this place! Some reviews have called it a bit expensive, but I have paid this price in other fine dining establishments and gotten 1/2 the food we got here. And I have paid less for the same items in other places, but they weren't cooked to perfection, as they were here. Thanks to everyone at Corktown Kitchen for a wonderful evening."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in for dinner. Food was really great, as was the service. If you find yourself in Corktown, stop by. You'll be glad you did..."}
{"text":"I ordered the house burger and added pork belly. The restaurant only prepares its burgers medium, which I'm cool with as that's how I take my meat. However, medium in this case meant raw. The temperature of my burger was perfect until I reached the centre, which was cool. The meat was chewy slimmy and clearly uncooked. I sent it back and round 2 came out perfect. However the pork belly in both instances was over cooked and super dry. Service at the restaurant was exceptional though."}
{"text":"Two foods in this world I can't stand: lobster and lamb. Guess what I've absolutely devoured at the CK? LOBSTER AND LAMB. To clarify, I've had the lamb poutine and the lobster mac 'n cheese. Both truly as good as it gets. And the BURGER? Don't even get me started on the burger. So fresh. So juicy. So full of flavour. You will get bowled over by the explosion of flavour in this and every other dish on the menu. This place doesn't mess around with quality. Also, make sure to try a cocktail (or five). The bartender means business. 

Make sure you book a reso though - the CK is a smaller spot and gets heckin' busy (it's a real favourite amongst the locals)."}
{"text":"Went last night.  We had the tuna sashimi as an appetizer and the rack of lamb and vegetable stir fry with green curry. Absolutely spectacular.  To finish it off we split the crime brûlée.  Honestly the best I've ever had. Small place as the whole place seats maybe 25-30.  They have a small standard menu and then a chalkboard full of options. We went off the board.  They had two wait staff that tag team you.  Both were attentive, engaging and knowledgable.  The chef Matt came by just to see how we were enjoying it. Nice touch.  Highly recommended. And will be returning soon."}
{"text":"My fiance and I were exploring the neighbourhood one Sunday morning looking for a brunch spot. Through the window we saw a guitarist and a guy on a keyboard having a low-key Sunday morning jam. Live music?! We knew immediately we had to eat here! 
This cute, cosy corner restaurant continued to surprise us with their delicious menu making it near impossible to decide what to order. I wanted one of everything. We had bottomless coffees to start (being from New Zealand our brunch style is more caffeine-based than alcohol) and I chose the special caramel french toast, my fiance deciding on the pork belly eggs benny.  OMG the food was ah-mazing!!! The french toast was like nothing I had ever had before, with caramel sauce and berries I thought it may be too rich, but it was perfection. The eggs benny was \"bloody fantastic\" to quote my fiance. 
We lived in New York before moving to Toronto, and I have to say this was up there with the best brunches we have ever had. The atmosphere was welcoming and the live music was the perfect touch to create a chill, intimate vibe. Finally, the service and menu knowledge was top-notch. 
We will definitely be back to try the dinner menu!"}
{"text":"Nice and cozy atmosphere! Our server was attentive and well informed.  She suggested two great wines to pair with my salmon and wonton noodle dish. The dish itself was filling and really tasty! We ended our meal with the creme brule, which was good, but could have been better without the dollop of jam."}
{"text":"Everything was cooked perfectly. We ordered the octopus salad, rack of lamb and cured salmon with guacomole. The octopus was so tender and not the least bit chewy with the perfect amount of a grilled taste that it wasn't overpowering or bitter but I have to say the salad had too much onion but that's my only complaint. The rack of lamb was medium rare, and not dry in the least; when you bite into it, you can taste how moist and tender the meat is. The cured salmon isn't overly salty and went great with the hashbrown underneath and guacomole. This place is a bit pricy but the experience was great! The service was pretty good given the fact that there were only 2 waiters with a place packed full of people."}
{"text":"This may be my new favourite burger in Toronto. 
Visited mid-week on a whim because a buddy and I were tired of our usual options. 
Corktown Kitchen hit the spot.
It's only a small room, with about a dozen tables + bar seats.
Dark-ish (not too dark) with a tv above the bar on mute.
They had specials on a chalk board - I'm sad I didn't see them sooner, because they all sounded amazing. 
But let's face it - the burger was the right choice. 
It was huge, cooked-to-order, well-seasoned.
Great toppings.
Fries weren't included in the dish but oh em gee, those crispy morsels were worth the extra three dollars.
I forced myself to finish it all. That's how good it was.

Note: the server told us that they're updating, and shrinking, the menu soon.
But I've been assured the burger isn't disappearing.

If Sunday brunch is as good as dinner, I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Stopped on here for a quick bite after the Christmas Market. We did not make reservations in any of the restaurants in the Christmas market and regretted it and headed over to Corktown Kitchen where we also did not have a reservation and they were full (all the tables open had reservation signs on them), but they accommodated us.  

The cute little place on the corner is small seating about 10 tables and seating at the bar - dim lighting and three very efficient staff members plus kitchen staff. 

We were chilly so we started off with two glasses of Malbec which was very nice. 

The menu had about 10 entrees and they also had daily specials that were listed on the chalkboard -  everything sounded amazing and from what we could see another tables it looked delicious. We ordered a cheeseburger and chicken and friets. Both entrées were far too large to finish so we did take the leftovers home the wine we definitely finished !! 

Will certainly return as would love to try couple of other items on their menu nice job Corktown. !!"}
{"text":"Cool spot - nice gourmet menu and good service.  The dishes are a mix between big hits and just so so.  A bit pricey, but overall nice concept of pub + fine dining"}
{"text":"The only reason for this star is because there's no option for zero star. The food was terrible, $17 cured salmon appetizer was clearly a direct purchase from Costco for 1/5 of the price. Seafood pho had mussels and octopus that were not fresh; after we ordered the editor came to tell us that because they ran out of salmon (the original ingredient of the soup) they were replacing with \"fresh\" halibut so the price will need to be $30 instead of $26 as we were originally told, we said sure; the halibut turned out to be dry and again, clearly not fresh. The other main we ordered was lamp chop, it was okay meat but definitely not well cooked nor was it worth $32. My boyfriend and I couldn't wait to finish the food and leave, but again, $100 bill on such meal was a total rubbery in my mind and frankly, we could go to Spring Rolls and get better food for 1/4 the price. 

So that's why I left this review for any yelpers who is checking this restaurant - DO NOT be fooled by this fake rating (like I did), DO NOT try this place, waste of your money and time."}
{"text":"My crew decided to try out this restaurant before heading over the Distillery District to experience the Christmas festivities. The place is quite small so if you have a group of more than 4, call ahead to book a table.

We had our table prepared as my crew started to arrive. The wait staff were very patient and explained the menu.  The kitchen was very accommodating as a friend wanted a gluten free diet. Many of us ordered the rack of lamb special with a glass of red wine. The first bite was great but as we continued eating we noticed the sauce was a little too salty.  We continued on with the mean but we told the wait staff to notify the kitchen to tone down the salt in future.

Others had the salmon special, burger and steak which were good but nothing special. Call ahead to find out the specials as it changes weekly.  Overall, a good experience and I will return to try the crispy half chicken which is a favourite on the regular menu. They were also willing to replace the frites with some seasonal vegetables at no extra charge.

After our meal, we simply walked to the Christmas Market which was only a 5 minute walk. I'm glad that we had a nice quite meal before heading to the busy market"}
{"text":"My top and favourite restaurant in the city. Matt, the owner and chef is a total class act and the food is nothing less than phenomenal! Amazing service, perfectly cooked steak and others, and a quality of food that is seriously lacking in this city. The perfect hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Tried the Corktown Kitchen for the first time tonight. The food was delicious and there was a good variety of choices. We ordered the grilled shrimp and the rack of lamb. Both were really tasty! It's a little on the pricey side but I had a great experience here and will visit again."}
{"text":"3.5 stars..   the service was somewhat lacking as they were having some difficulties with the hardware for placing orders and for payments, taking their focus away from providing the top notch service I was expecting.  The food was fantastic though.   Hands down one og the best burgers I've had in Toronto.   Will definitely go back and give them another chance.."}
{"text":"Great service and a surprising selection and diversity in their dishes.  We ordered almost all the appetizers and shared them tapas-style.  My favourite dishes was the smoky chicken wings, closely followed by the octopus salad, then smoked salmon with guacamole. 

We also came in about 30 minutes early for our reservation, and they graciously accommodated us.  Wine by the bottle are also very reasonably priced.  

The ambiance is cozy and modern, though the space is on the smaller sign.  Definitely check it out, esp if you are at the Distillery Christmas market - it's just a stone throw away."}
{"text":"My name is Kevin.
I strongly recommend  that you visit this fine restaurant!
The quisine is awesome! 
I have worked as a cook for over 30 years and have recently worked with along side with chef Matthew.
He is very proud of the meals that he prepares, and 
prepares every dish as if his own. 
I have tasted most of his menus items and they are 
delicious  
But, please don't take my word for it. 
Drop by and enjoy  the experience for yourself"}
{"text":"probably the best staff there is in a Toronto pub. True family atmosphere a la \"It's always sunny in Philadelphia\" except these guys are actually good at their jobs haha. Going back soon for those flaming shots! Thanks Matt!"}
{"text":"Excellent meal. I had two courses and extra side dishes paired with wine and the bill was still less than what I had anticipated. Really creative dishes from the chef, using fresh local ingredients. The portions were a little too generous so I had to take some leftovers home! We're thinking of hosting an event here now. I think their bathroom is under renovations though, the door didn't close."}
{"text":"I am happy to have an alternative to the Distillery District restaurants and had a really nice meal here before a Soulpepper performance. Service was super-friendly, with server, bartender, and chef checking in throughout the meal. The gastropub menu is augmented by an extensive specials board, from which I chose a very tasty lamb shank. The only letdown about the dish was the veg side, a big pile of peas. Still, I strongly recommend CK for locals and for the pre-theatre crowd."}
{"text":"Went again for brunch recently. This place has stepped their game up and made strides with regards to their food and service. A great local spot."}
{"text":"I live in the west end of the city and I don't get over to the east end, but I have heard good things about The Corktown Kitchen from friends and I will have to admit, I agree with them.

The items on the menu looked good, but then tend t have a better selection of specials (at least the night i went there). They had a special for each category; meat, fish and vegetarian.

I ordered the rack of lamb special and was not disappointed... My dinner companion had the Crispy Half Chicken and Frites which I was able to sample. It was good too, but my dish was much better...

The service was attentive and super friendly as well, which is always nice to receive. 

All in all, I would recommend this place to others and I would definitely go back..."}
{"text":"Nice little restaurant with great ambiance. Had the octopus salad to start.  Octopus was cooked nicely but salad was really lacking. We ordered the thai shrimp and lamb chops for the main. Both dishes had great flavour profiles and meat was cooked pretty well. Service was also friendly. However I found portions were really lacking, after spending about $90 on dinner for 2 mains and a starter, I was still hungry."}
{"text":"I had the burger and I found it to be just 'OK'. It's a big portion, which I finished. The meat just lacks spice and flavour. I had a side of fries, they were good but not GREAT. It's an expensive burger for fries and burger $19. 

I think it would be a great place for brunch and they take reservations."}
{"text":"Neighborhood gem!!!!

I am so lucky that I'm a 5 min walk to this place. The food is solid, and the portions are crazy generous. 

It's perfect for a causal date night, or a night out with the girls. Small, intimate, great food, what more can you ask for?

The dishes on the menu won't surprise you, you've probably seen/eaten it before, but the food is delicious. And did I mention their portions were generous?!?  Love 

I just wished they were open for brunch both days on the weekend."}
{"text":"The Corktown Kitchen is one of our favourite Toronto restaurants. Chef Matt Griffiths creates consistently excellent food, served in a cozy and relaxing atmosphere. The international menu is supplemented with delicious daily specials. Culinary gems include: daily potstickers, octopus salad, rack of venison, a hamburger big enough to share, and creme brûlée. Dakota ensures that the service is friendly and helpful, and the small wine list has a good selection of essentials at fair prices. We often bring friends, and then they do the same."}
{"text":"Just wanted to start off by saying this was one of my favorite places for 2015.  I'm hoping my most recent experience was just a one off but I gotta go with reviewing my latest experience.

Ambiance was good, setting was nice as usual.  For food we ordered the burger, the Portobello burger and the lamb.  The burger was okay, had decent portion and tasted fine.  The Portobello burger was not as impressive as the last time I had it.  There was a lot more vegetables last time.  I ordered the lamb for myself.  It was once 4 pieces as you can see in some of the pictures on Yelp but I got 3 pieces.  The lamb dish just looked very clumsily put together with not much finesse.

Well before our dishes came (approx 15 min) but after the initial order, I asked to add a side of fries to our order which was $3.  When the bill came they charged us the regular price for the fries of $7.  They said we ordered it too late so it had to be a separate item.  How is it too late?  Its fries, put it on the plate by the burger when the food comes out...The answer I got didn't make any sense me.  I'm a big supporter of small businesses but when people pull these kind of things it's just kind of annoying."}
{"text":"They did a very good job. I would recommend in this neighborhood. I live down the street from it and it is so hard to find any good restaurants around. This place used to be Weezies which was not so good imo. Corktown kitchen is definitely an improvement.

The menu is interesting in that they try to be cultural and eclectic, incorporated some thai and viet elements. I dont see lots of chefs do italian and wings and Vietnamese roll at the same time. From that I guess the kitchen has had some training and experience.

Now the food. Octopus salad was very good. I always love kumato tomatos and the OO.

Chicken wings has some interesting spice in it, but the bbq sauce could be toned down a bit.

The Halibut according to my bf was very well done. But whatever he says doesnt count, obviously.

I got the linguinie and truffled mushrooms. Mushrooms are great mix, probably at least four types, I see Enokitake in it, loved the east asian element blended seamlessly in this pasta dish. The linguinie could be a bit more al dente but was good as it was.

Service was very warm. Dresscode is pretty casual. Our bill was around 100 without tip which is pretty good for the food we got. Definitely coming back and bringing friends."}
{"text":"Me and my girlfriend decided to stop here on the complete win, I had heard a couple good things about the restaurant and we are walking to go to the Christmas night market and decided to stop in for dinner. Upon arrival we were asked if we had reservations, we did not we ended up waiting for about five or 10 minutes and then we're seated promptly and given menus. We ordered water and pop because neither of us were drinking, my girlfriend actually ordered an iced tea and they made it from scratch. I'm talking through the tea poured it chilled it and added sugar. Absolutely beyond believe. We started off with spring rolls and grilled octopus. The spring rolls were very well-made they stayed together and they came with a spicy Thai style dipping sauce which was good. And the octopus was absolutely wonderful, succulent and tender, served over a tomato style coleslaw almost. For Manes my girlfriend got a roast chicken crispy skin, and fries and I got the meat of the week which was lamb chops. The chicken was wonderful, The skin was in fact very crispy, and the fries were arguably some of the best french fries I have ever had in my entire life. My lamb was also amazing, it came out wonderful. Serve with green beans and go cheese mashed Potatoes which basically melted in your mouth. After dinner we were offered drinks they had a special on for Terry's chocolate Orange style drink, but we ended up just leaving and going to the night market. Would 100% return to this restaurant, and recommend it to anybody who is in the corktown area."}
{"text":"Had a fabulous dinner here, perfect spot for a date - nice and intimate setting, music was at the perfect volume and a great playlist. The service from Dakota was amazing, always showed up at the perfect time when glasses were getting empty. 

The food was so phenomenal and a great price for the quality and volume (huge serving size). Would definitely recommend. 

This was my first time for dinner, but we've been for brunch in the past and we're equally impressed.  Great option in the neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"Went there for brunch with other 4 friends and we really loved this place. Food was amazing and the owner was very nice! We will definitely come back for dinner.
Only reason why I'm not giving 5 stars are: they charge toast separately from the brunch menu, which I never saw before (even when it's only $1). Also they couldn't separate our bills the way we wanted, which was a bit bad since we were in 5."}
