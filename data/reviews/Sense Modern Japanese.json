{"text":"this is my first review on yelp. i feel very disappoint for this restaurant. I ordered the uni rice, it cost me $50 and only one piece of uni on top, one mixed with rice. the taste is much lower than my expectation. The sashimi is bad too, normal fish, nothing special... This is my worst experience, won't come again!!"}
{"text":"This place is so so so special, calling for a definite no return. Set dinner for 2 with kids meal portion serving in a completely messy sequence.  First item was ONE 5\" plate of salad. As normal person, we considered it was for a person and waited for another portion to come, but sorry, the fact was it was for us to SHARE!  Next item was 1 piece of foie gras, thumb size big, again for us to SHARE! No matter how good the foie gras was cooked or how good the sauce was made, everything got ruined. Some more hot items came up, but honestly they were of fast food quality. And a big sigh to a good piece of black cod being cooked wrongly.  After hot food we had an average quality sashimi and reman. Then a server asked us if anything not yet from the kitchen, haha, that's probably the reason she asked us to keep the set dinner menu at the early beginning!  Then came the crab soup in ONE bowl with ONE spoon. Come on, why didn't you split it into 2 bowls! I spooned a bit soup on my sauce bowl for tasting, and forgot it, tasteless cream soup no a second spoon.  Scallop tataki, nice plating blank taste. Yellow tail tataki, blank plating blank taste.  Finally another soup came up, clam chowder in ONE bowl with ONE spoon. Factually it was an ONE clam with shell cream soup, zero correlation with chowder. If crab soup and clam chowder were with the same soup base, I couldn't understand why their kitchen couldn't serve them at the same time and made the soup the last item of the dinner!!  A definite NO for this place."}
{"text":"The attraction of this restaurant is the ambience ..it certainly stood out amongst the Other places at first markham.   My friend and I are small eaters so we figured that we would try it out. The menu read like a French restaurant . Duck , poutine, foi grais, tapas side dishes.    We decided to share everything : seafood on ramen (cast iron pot it was not), black cod with truffle and green tea crime brûlée.   The seafood with ramen was considered expensive at first markham because it was very small in die. The taste was okay but it tasted like Italian pasta sauce with a bit of rose wine.  It tasted closer to Italian than Japanese. It did not taste bad, but just different. For $20+, it could be more unique.   The black cod was grilled with truffle on top. But the truffle is not real truffle mushroom if it is what you are expecting. It is actually grilled sushi wrapper.  The Sauce was unique and the fish sat on top of some mild flavored cauliflower  purée,   The taste was good and the fish was cooked just right.   However, the fish entree arrived 15 minutes after the ramen.  The dessert menu was not too exciting. Blueberry cheesecake. Vanilla crime brûlée m green tea creme brûlée are the selections. We were hoping that the cheesecake is Japanese style . The server confirmed that it is regular cheesecake, with wild blueberry sauce. We chose the green tea creme brûlée which we hoped that it brought the Japanese fusion dinner to conclusion.   The creme brûlée was quite good.   Overall, this restaurant has a great theme, outstanding decor and somewhat interesting menu. But it is located in the wrong place!  You can probably move this restaurant over to thornhill, or even close to Bayview and eglinton, or downtown ... It will attract the right customers. If Ki and Swish by Han are considered \"great\" place, this restaurant will fit in.   However, they need to train their servers better. They really tried to be proactively attentive but they need better training.  They are nice enough but have to do more e.g. Inform us why our fish will be 15 minutes late.   Overall, not a bad experience but I am worried that they will be another restaurant closing down soon (may be it is the bad luck spot because no one seemed to last )   Good luck! I am glad I tried it...."}
{"text":"We saw this place on one of the instagram feeds and thought what the heck,  let's go for fancy Japanese food!  We ordered the duck poutine, the scallop appetizer and a miso ramen.  Out of the three the ramen was the best. The soup base was mild and not too salty and the garnish and pork was quite good.   The duck poutine was surprisingly small for $12. To describe the taste,  I would say that the poutine had a taste of leftover grocery store duck that you nuke the crap out of in the microwave. This was actually not bad,  as the dried out crunchyness actually helps with the soggy combination of gravy, fries, and cheese.   I would say the gravy consistency and flavour was similar to the gravy you get at KFC. Cheese was just cheese curds you can get anywhere. The fries were similar to Harvey's fries.  (Clearly from what I wrote above I'm not the most healthy eater, but when it comes to junk food, I guess I take it very seriously. So you can take my word for it )   If there's one thing to steer clear from, it is the scallop appetizer. I don't remember the name of it but it was the main reason why we tried this place, the look of the dish hooked us in like a fat kid who loves cake.  Check the pictures of it so that you can be fooled by it too. Admittedly the presentation is quite nice, but some of the ingredients were marscapone cheese,  truffles,  purple cauliflower, and some other fancy stuff.  Overall I went in expecting a bit more, especially with the price of some of the items.  Case in point $35 for 7 piece sashimi is a steep risk to take, especially when you're eating sushi at Chinese plaza.  I'll let the next person decide if it's worth it.   The service was nothing to write home about, the atmosphere and decor was nice.  I probably wouldn't come back here, unless I have a strange poutine craving. But then again, if I did I guess I would fire up the microwave and make my own.  Kidding aside, the ramen was actually very tasty, but there are so many other choices in the area from a price point that can satisfy your craving."}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant 3 hours ago for valentine's day dinner. As I sit on my toilet with a bad stomach ache, I would like to review this experience while it's still fresh in my head.  First of all, the one star is for the nice renovation they did on the place. I believe this restaurant is owned by chinese people and you can tell they've spent some $$ renovating and designing the place. so here's your one star (or else this restaurant deserves negative stars)  I went with my fiance and we got a set menu for $38 per person (about 6-7 dishes)  We first got a salad (just one for the table), which was weird because the set was priced per person. If i was eating with a friend or someone i just met i wouldn't want to pick at stuff with them.. but whatever... The first real dish was a fried something... dunno what it was but it tasted like kfc chicken (later we found out it was tempura)... with a weird sauce that tasted like nothing.. NONE of their pairing sauces tasted like anything! and the way they came out with the dishes were all messed up, isn't my sashimi and raw stuff suppose to come first? whatever... we just left it cus they were pretty busy with valentines day. When the sashimi came, the tuna tasted weird... and i think that's what gave me this stomach ache... The duck poutine was horrific... the fries were the microwavable ones.. and soggy from the gravy made from powder packs.... along with their overnight duck probably from chinese bbq places... overall.. everything tasted horrific.. i had better food at an $10 all you can eat sketchy japanese place..  Throughout the whole dinner 2 times the server put a dish down.. walked away.. and came back to say the dish wasn't ours and passed it onto the table next to us... -_- stupid cus i could've spat in that dish already... the server could at least have brought it to the back and bring it back out... Then, about 3 times a server would come out and ask if i had this dish yet (showing me the dish) or explaining it... clearly the kitchen or servers weren't keeping track  The table beside us had the same thoughts.. and throughout the dinner they kept saying they paid $140 for crap... they had an extra course of soup.. and the server came out with ONE bowl and ONE spoon.. the girl had to drink half and pass it to the guy.... did the restaurant run out of bowls?  this restaurant was a joke.. and disappointment. I don't know if I should thank them for helping me lose 10lbs from the bad diarrhea I'm having..... I don't mind spending $100 on dinner but please don't serve me crap. I'm just having a bad night because I've been sitting on this toilet for too long."}
{"text":"Kushiyaki not bad.  The ox tongue is the best! Both squid and baby conch skewer is very tasty.  Since the Kushiyaki are very strong with flavour, this makes their ramen a little bit bland.     The truffle crusted black cod smell and taste great! I just love the smell and the taste of truffle!"}
{"text":"Read some of the reviews before coming, so I was pleasantly surprised. Im going to give it 3.5 overall.  The decor was beautiful on the inside. A modern twist to a Japanese style. We unfortunately sat in a corner, so it ruined the view a bit.  Service was pretty good, but the tea cups were really tiny, and they forgot to give us a teapot to pour our own tea. This made asking them to refill rather annoying.  For food: -Kushiyaki was quite good: the pork belly and ox tongue were really great. Shitake mushroom were also good, but not quite worth the money.  -Ahi Tuna Tataki was AMAZING, each slice nicely cut (not too thin) and beautifully flavoured. -Seared Beef Tataki was also really nicely flavoured, but sliced too thick, which made it a bit chewier than I would have liked. -Our larger dishes were the Red Wine Curry, Miso Ramen, and Miso Salmon, which were all pretty mediocre. Nothing all that special.  Overall, a good meal for a fair a la carte price. Probably wouldn't come back for dinner as they currently offer a BOGO deal for lunch."}
{"text":"So this place isn't Japanese authentic at all. The dishes are quite pricy as well taste varies. Some of the dishes aren't really Japanese as they have duck poutine or uni risotto. Both aren't bad but aren't mouth watering. Gave it a 3 because the price is not worth the taste. You can try but for me this will be a quarterly visit our not even maybe half a year."}
{"text":"It is my first time here and I heard they are offering lunch time special BOGO. The environment is good, well designed.  Service: horrible It wasn't full of customer but the servers were mess up with orders and appetizers. Ruined my mood.  Food: it just ok food and I agreed with some of the comments that, this place is is overpriced and I can get better food from Jtown with a lower price.   They have good concept but there are problem in the kitchen and management stuff"}
{"text":"Came here looking for some quality service and food...but instead left with no food and anger!!  The decor and the atmosphere of the place was really nice and was very unique compared to the restaurants around it. So my friends and I decided to give it a try for our dinner. We ordered the curry beef, pork belly skewer, the lobster pasta and the seafood miso with poached egg.   First the food don't come out all the same time, which was fine, but the wait time between the first dish and the next dish was sooooi long. My friend's lobster pasta came and she wanted to wait for all of us to get our food before she eats, but our food didn't come for 15 min...so we asked the waiter about it. Then after waiting for another 5 min, she brought the pork belly appetizer out...but it was not the thing we ordered. On the menu there was pork belly skewer and pork belly wrapped in bacon, and even though we pointed to the skewer when we ordered, she took the wrong order...  Anyways, she apologized and went it to place another order. After maybe another 5 min, the miso seafood and the pork belly skewer came. At this point, the pasta was already dead cold. I was still waiting for my beef curry and asked the lady once more about it (it has already been 30 min since we ordered). She told me she missed the order and she will put it in right away!!!  Wtf?? umm you messed up my appetizer order and didn't put my entree order in?????   As I watched my friends devoured their food and waited for another 15 min, my curry beef still did not come!!!!! I kept asking the lady about it and all she said was it's coming....By then, I was so angry! I asked for the bill and wanting to leave but they had the guts to charge us the curry beef that never came !!!!!!!!! OMG... We paid for the food we ate, left the money on the table and left  At the end, my friends and I had to go to the food court to get me some food (thank god it didn't close yet), and since the portion from the restaurant was so small,(like seriously maybe only a 10 year old will get full on that) they also got something to eat even though they just spent $20+ on their dinner.   So yeah...I'm never going back to this restaurant again!!!"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch, my friend and I ordered the exact same item but the portion sizes were both different, one came 5 minutes later than the other and was not garnished where the first plate was.   The decor looked modern, relaxing and clean. The menu itself was a bit confusing. You have a modern Japanese restaurant include items such as a duck poutine and a truffle mushroom risotto.....what part of any of that is even Japanese?  We ordered the red wine curry beef with rice with fries and miso soup on the side. As much of a fan of salt I am, I found that there was an overbearing amount of miso that made the soup taste like a bowl of seasoned brine. The fries were not crisp or firm, and just looked sad. As well, it was oversalted. The beef plate tasted fine if you ate every piece individually. The sauce was really salty but at least there was a bowl of rice to cut the salt it down. The way it was cooked did not allow for the carrots and potatoes to soak in any flavour, so essentially it felt as if you had boiled vegetables dumped on top of the sauce. The beef itself was possibly the most enjoyable part of the meal.   Overall the food was fairly consistent (just not in a good way)."}
{"text":"Sense is a new Japanese fusion restaurant that opened in First Markham place. The decor is beautiful, a modern take on traditional Japanese design. The atmosphere is very nice.   They are currently offering a BOGO deal on a select lunch menu. The lunch combo also comes with a small salad and miso soup. Surprisingly, the miso soup had a lot of tofu and seaweed. They gave us complimentary gyoza, which were actually pan-fried korean dumplings. We ordered the red miso seafood casserole and the katsudon. The casserole had a good amount of seafood but the taste was a little off for me. The katsudon was a little dry in my opinion and I felt it was quite mediocre.   Looking at their full lunch menu, selection is limited and quite overpriced. I would not likely come back for lunch. However, I may come back to see their dinner offerings."}
{"text":"I'm not surprised with the mixed reviews, but I'm glad I didn't listen to ANY of the 1 star reviews written here.  Although, it could easily have been because I couldn't understand one of them because the grammar was worse than the way the menu was laid out.  That was perhaps what confused me a great deal.  Sense Modern Japanese is an attempt at bringing the more posh style of Japanese tapas into the uptown area.  Perhaps its the way uptown living works, but it's not easy to run an izakaya uptown.  They score high marks for decor.  I will admit, they've put in a lot of effort to stop that draft from doors opening from freezing the patrons, which is a nice touch.  They've also given it a full redesign so it feels nothing like its previous tenants.    Unfortunately, that's where things dip a little.  The menu isn't exactly laid out in a way that is easy to understand.  Someone had kindly put up a picture of the menu in the photos section, so you can see for yourself.  \"Meat things\", \"Fish things\", while I understand what it entails, I don't understand what they are trying to serve.  I say that because they have a section full of \"filling things\".  They include noodles, curry beef with rice, and even a poutine.  I want to think that it'll be like tapas, where it's many small dishes, but the pricing of some of the dishes don't feel \"tapas-esque\".  That part, confuses me.    Perhaps what would work better on their menus (which I'm really hoping is just a work in progress) is some photo representation, and a better laying out of the food.  This is why : it's a great location, they can attract people, but they have to keep people coming back.  They've lacked some very essential things that makes izakaya interesting to begin with.  Izakaya usually has some very basic seafood offerings like takoyaki with some twist by the chef.  These guys lacked takoyaki, or tako wasabi.    While not essential, they also lacked a beef carpaccio, Something that sparked more of a Japanese twist, like a chicken karaage.  However, I was quite surprised to see they had a fried quail, which was done in a sort of karaage style.  That didn't disappoint at all.  Points for that as well.  Unfortunate, the rest of the meal wasn't too mind blowing or spectacular, where the red wine curry beef with rice seemed a bit, interesting, as there wasn't much of a red wine flavour, nor curry flavour, the rice was fantastic, but, it was lacking.  The tonkatsu was a little tasteless, and the poutine with duck breast had soggy fries.    So you can see, it's not that they're not trying but it's like they haven't quite found their rhythm yet.  I want to give 2.5 stars, but I just can't help but think I got let down a bit by the lack of much to offer on the menu.  I'm just hoping they can really up the ante a bit to make this more enticing.  It's such a waste of all the effort if they can't translate it into something great."}
{"text":"3.5/5, +.5 for service  Sense overtook the former Tasty Noodle House location, which was the former Kenny's Noodle location at First Markham Place.  A complete redecoration of the restaurant added a more modern, upscale feel to the restaurant. I also liked how they placed a wall between the entrance and the seats (you'd have to walk to the left for reception), so we wouldn't get the draft inside while dining.  It's still a relatively new restaurant, so the servers were a little disorganized. However they do try! They will also assist you if you're not used to the menu selections, as the selections are quite different from most of the other Japanese restaurants one would go to.  I had the red miso seafood cast iron with poached egg, truffle scallop tempura with yuzu teriyaki sauce, and house clam chowder. I also got a free sample of salmon and ahi tuna on the house.  The red miso seafood cast iron was quite good, however you will likely end up with messy hands as the shrimp still had the shell on the outside. Peel, peel, peel...yeah. The truffle scallop tempura was probably one of the more unique dishes I've tasted (and even presented), as there was what looked like soap bubbles covering the dish...but it's not actually soap bubbles. As for the dish itself, it was decent but nothing too spectacular. Finally, the house clam chowder was more like house clam soup, as the clams were in whole pieces, and I didn't feel much of a \"chowder\" experience...the soup was more like a light cream soup...with one fresh scallop inside. It did taste very good, though the item is a little misleading.  I would think this restaurant is similar to Inspire, though I haven't been there yet. It's certainly not as loud as the izakaya places downtown. Not sure if this place would survive, considering Markham is a more family-oriented place than Toronto. Either way I would likely come here again to try some other items.  Free wifi! Ask for password."}
{"text":"Lunch deal is a great value, grand opening deal is buy one get one free off a select menu.   They gave us complementary gyoza and 4 pieces of sashimi as well which was nice.   The restaurant seems like a ball of confusion, main courses coming before the apps and tables No cleared because they were so chaotic.   Honestly I didn't feel like it was anything special. I got the red wine curry and my friend got the seafood casserole. I feel like I could have gotten better food at the food court in japantown. If it wasn't for the buy 1 get 1 deal I wouldn't come here for their fusion food.   The pieces of sashimi we did get we're pretty nice so I might think of coming back for just sushi to see how that goes. Overall not a great first impression but am definitely gonna give it one more try !"}
{"text":"Sense Modern Japanese is probably one of the newest restaurants in First Markham Place right now and is fairly attractive as a place to go when looking from the outside.   The interior is well furnished, decorated and a very modern look. However, in such a short period of time their menus have taken a beating and look quite terrible. Printed on paper which is not laminated, they definitely reflect wear and tear and a little unprofessionalism.   In terms of the food, it's nothing amazing but also not terrible. I suppose it's worth a try if you're feeling adventurous for a new restaurant. This restaurant doesn't feature sushi and maki rolls and has a very limited selection in that regard. Their menu features more cooked dishes like chicken teriyaki, udon, and skewers.  We tried their Tako Wasabi which was OK. The octopus was fresh and crunchy and the price wasn't bad. It was about $4.  For mains, we tried the Salmon Teriyaki and 48 Hour Beef. The Salmon was nicely grilled and it remained moist. The sear had a nice flavor to it. The beef was served on a long plate with some grilled asparagus, two potato dishes and one rib. The beef was pretty good as it had a ton of flavor and was nice and tender.  I don't think I'd go back with so many other options in the mall but it's worth checking out."}
{"text":"I came here with my girlfriend on a Friday night seeing how it just opened up and we're always looking try new restaurants.  The ambience is nice with good service.  As my girlfriend had mentioned, usually one of the rare times where you paid for the bill, and they still bring you tea.  We ordered the Red Miso Cast Iron Seafood, the Spaghetti with Uni sauce, and the Tempura Quail.  Red Miso:  I thought this was ok, it was brought out in a clay pot, and not a cast iron.  Food was luke warm, not sure if that was to keep the poached egg from hardening.  Flavour wasn't bad, and had about 5-6 tiger shrimps.  Spaghetti with Uni:  the noodles were el dente, but looked like It was out of instant noodle packaging.  The sauce was a bit light on flavor, not sure I'd order this again.  Tempura Quail:  This kind of tasted like quail with KFC seasoning.  It wasn't the fluffy tempura like you would see with shrimp tempura, but more just a fried quail with seasoning.  It kind of had that southern fried chicken taste to it,   I think for it's price you're paying for the ambience and the service, that's the only reason why I gave this place a 3/5 stars.  The food I ordered was average, and not worth the value.  Mind you those were the only 3 things I ordered and was not impressed.  the 3 items came to almost $40 then add tip."}
