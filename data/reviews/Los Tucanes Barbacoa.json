{"text":"Little Mexican restaurant with authentic Mexican food and great service!  I highly recommend the Barbacoa with the homemade tortillas and the salsas remind me of my abuelitas salsas.. simply delicious!"}
{"text":"When passing thru Phoenix on New Year's day we were just looking for something open. This place was and we stopped. The menu says it is Los Politos though but the outside signs say Los Tucanes. So maybe it's both :). Hole in the wall with good food. Hubby loved it. One guy was working by himself there and yet the food came out hot, fresh and still fast. Hubby took a card he liked it so much. The Tamales were a lil spicy for my daughter but still very good, you know they are authentic then."}
{"text":"Passed by this place the other day our way back to work from eating lunch at another taco shop on 7th street.  I saw the sign for Birria de Chivo on the window and vowed to return soon to try it and boy am I glad that I did!  Went with my boss today for lunch.  We ordered tacos de Birria de Chivo, tacos la lengua and tacos de pastor.  None of them dissappointed, but holy cow was the Pastor perfect with loads of flavor.  The tacos are $2 each and the salsa is so good.  They have loads of hot sauce to choose from and the owners? are very very nice.  We will be returning for sure to try most of the menu one plate at a time.  If you're looking for authentic, look no further!"}
{"text":"Authentic food, great prices, my type of place. I go for \"homemade\" nearly hole-in-the-wall over overly-presented. Although I've only had tamales and breakfast burritos they were delicious."}
