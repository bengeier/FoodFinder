{"text":"The best pizza in town. Great price and great quality!! Lots of cheesy goodness. Quick when ordering for pickup."}
{"text":"I love their pizza here. For the price, you can't beat it! I have never had any quality issues with the food whatsoever. The location is way too rough though. Would never go pick up."}
{"text":"The best pizza on 17th ave!!!! Do not wait to order from here!! This place is a household favourite!  We loooove the Milano and the Donair pizza!! Their cheese sticks are to die for and you can tell everything is homemade no crappy frozen crusts! Their wings are pretty good, chicken fingers and onion rings are also a must try! You will not be disappointed ordering from here!!!"}
{"text":"Very impressed by another hole-in-the-wall, though in a busy stretch of mini plazas galore on this stretch of 17th Ave.  Definitely a pickup/delivery place, with one small table tucked in the corner.  Ordered the personal size, for just $8, half hawaiian and meat lovers, and boy, they sure didn't cheap out on the toppings!  Pineapples galore, and plenty of sausages and pepperoni, nicely placed ;)  Of course plenty of cheese too.  Highly recommended, and free parking.  Not authentically Italian but one would be pleasantly surprised ..."}
