{"text":"This is our go-to place for donuts since we heard about it a couple of months ago.  I an generally take or leave donuts - I don't crave them.  That was until I discovered the crullers at this bakery.  You have to try the maple or chocolate frosted ones, they're the best!  I like the glazed ones too - but they end up being a little too sweet for my tastes.  I love that this is a mom and pop bakery - there aren't enough places like this these days."}
{"text":"I stop here every Friday for donuts for the office, and there are nothing but compliments from the people at work. The people that work here are always happy to great you. Just a great place!"}
{"text":"Really good homemade donuts! They are also reasonably priced and always have a good variety.   These are also stuffed, covered, etc. to the brim. Often times I ordered a cream filled donut and can't find the cream, that isn't the case here. Their other pastures are good too. If you are on the run, coffee and milk are also there for the quick grab."}
