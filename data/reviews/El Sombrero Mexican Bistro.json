{"text":"Awesome decor in this little restaurant. Food is delicious and a little different than traditional Mexican restaurants, more like from Mexico City. Waiter was super friendly and attentive. Get the sangria!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. A hidden little jem. The staff is attentive and really friendly. You'll love the decor and atmosphere. The food was awesome. Everyone there was very pleased with their orders. I can't wait to go back for more and the Sunday brunch."}
{"text":"Jose and Renee were very kind. The food was absolutely delicious. We tried the jalapeño wrapped in bacon, and they were amazing. We had a great time and great food!"}
{"text":"If you haven't been here in a while it might surprise you. The food has always been authentic Mexican and good and it had an authentic look and feel - say Juarez 1970.  I hadn't been there in several years and was surprised when I ate lunch Thursday.  Outside as the same but it was redone inside. Kind of a hipster vibe now.   The food is still great. Maybe better than before.  The presentation is less old style mex and more nuvo cuisine.  We ordered the table guacamole.  Delicious. Then I had the beef taco and chicken enchilada special.  Great taste. Great portions. Good price.    The parking is still as bad as ever (we did find a space). But it's free and it's walking distance from downtown."}
{"text":"One of the top Authentic Mexican Restaurants on my list. Great food. Fast service. Warm Atmosphere. Easy-to-get-to location with available parking in place.  Mahi-Mahi tacos were my favorite. I have to admit I had a few too many of their Signature Sangrias. On my first visit, I had learned from the owner James that Sangria recipe has been in their family for generations. Our waiter Jose was very attentive and took a great care of my friends and I. A must-visit family owned restaurant. I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"We love this Mexican restaurant. Our waiter Jose was amazing. He is very attentive and made our experience great!!! We will definitely keep coming to this restaurant and we hope to always have Jose as our waiter."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in Nevada, Uriel and Chris are awesome everyone should check out this place ."}
{"text":"Awesome spot downtown. Hole in the wall look from outside but very nice inside. I would describe it as slightly upscale authentic Mexican food. Nice menu everything we tried was good. Service was great as well. Have only been once but cannot wait to return."}
{"text":"Very delicious food. The pork belly tacos and quesadilla were on point. We also enjoyed the salad with watermelon. Highly recommend it if you want some delicious food for a reasonable price while in Vegas."}
{"text":"I took a chance on this place for a big group needing some decent food and it was a big win! They had tables ready for us and Jose was in fine form recanting mole origination stories and making clever suggestions for each party guest. The aforementioned mole was sublime, the guac refreshing, the enchiladas and burrito were spot-on with flavor, texture and portion size. Nice little bistro tucked away here in Vegas with warm service and a clean charm."}
{"text":"From the outside, you wouldn't expect the interior to be as modern as it was inside, but it was nice and unexpected. Their seats are not that comfortable, and yes, the restroom doors aren't \"cool\", but that's not too bad. My food was pretty darn tasty, which is what matters most. I ordered their chicken tamale and it was very good. Their salsa was good as well, but I wasn't that impressed with the guacamole. It was normal, nothing special. And I'm a big fan of Sangria, but I just didn't like the flavor in theirs. My husband liked it, but I wished I had ordered something else. Our waiter was good, and that's always a plus too. This was a good find, but I'm not sure if I would go out of my way again when there are so many other Mexican restaurants already on the strip. Deserves a try."}
{"text":"It feels odd giving a Restaurant that has 4 1/2 stars on yelp only 1 star, I will obviously be singled out as that one person who happened to have gone in during the only time this little place produced a bad product, but I don't care because MY experience with this little Mexican restaurant was worthy of 1 star. I read great things online about the place and wanted to give a try, I happened to drive by it by accident since I did't really know where it was (I was actually on my way to have lunch elsewhere.) I made a u turn, parked and proceeded to walk in. The interior is very modern but It feels like they tried to hard to make it look modern and hip, which is never and I mean never a good feeling, from the annoying restroom doors to the..... Wait, I don't care about any of that really, I will get to my point.   Here is where I will loose you, I am a vegetarian and I know that my options are limited, I will also mention that I am Mexican so I know Mexican food is always a safe bet. I walked in the door and it was awkward, it took a second or two or three or five for anyone to greet us, that is never a problem except for the fact that everyone was just staring at us as if we had crashed  a small private party including the staff and who the server later told us were the owners. Let's get to the Menu, there were several interesting options to pick from some of which now I am bored trying to remember what they were but regardless when I tried to ordered them the server shut us down with every single one of our choices by saying they no longer had those available, ever! That reminds me of the terrible service, and it was horrible and I feel horrible saying this about someone trying to make a living. Perhaps mentioning that half the menu was not available would have been a good way to start after he gave us the menus, I will mention that there were maybe 10 other customers eating at that point including the owners (I know because our server mentioned this for some reason) I am boring myself trying to write this so I will really get to the point.   Service was bad because we told him about my lame dietary restrictions, I know It's my fault that I am a vegetarian but he knew and still brought us the charro beans, yes I know that it's my fault for being a lame Vegetarian but you know what? Our server  was very nice, really really nice and I know he was trying but that is not an excuse, There was about five or six times when he made mistakes and just blamed it on other things, just say you're sorry and move on. Don't throw the rest of the establishment under the bus because you can't get your sh*t together. The beans he brought back were without a doubt the least flavorful beans I have ever had. EVER!!! no joke, My first attempt at making beans as a child were better than this excuse for beans, oh and the rice, the cold cold obviously two day old rice was even more depressing. Both meals were cold!!! Our meals came out in just a couple of minutes which is never good, Ever! Who is working in the kitchen? Where is the love and passion? Where is the chain of command and structure that prevents cold food that tasted like was taken out of a buffet line and plated for paying customers to consume. I will say the food presentation was great, they say you eat first with your eyes so maybe that was as far as they cared to try. I promise you, If you've bothered to read this far that my food was cold and my rice was old and hard the way rice looks and feels when it comes out of a fridge and my beans had zero flavor! Oh and the chile relleno was alright, like 6 out of 10. there was potatoes inside with the cheese which only made it seem like they had nothing else to fill it with. Who stuffs a chile relleno with potatoes? I really am asking, I've never had them like that before, I am not just asking to be a jerk, who does that? Is there grandmothers in Mexico who do that? I am going to google it because I really want to know now.  You eat first with your eyes then with your mouth is what this place basically is, It looks nice and modern, the food looks lovely and modern but inside is an empty soulless bland  attempt at modern Mexican food. It makes me sad to know that inside that kitchen there is a Mexican who was ok with serving someone cold old food. I will now finish my dirty Martini and move on with my life. You are the equivalent of a drunken one night stand, never again."}
{"text":"Food decent, service lacking. It's a tiny place so you wonder how over whelmed the staff can be. Orders came out all over the place and getting our margaritas took way too long. Don't the know alcohol racks up the bill? Food itself was pretty good. Not sure it was good enough to trump the bad service though."}
{"text":"Went here today despite the one review that alleged the restaurant did not smell pleasant. I am glad I ignored that review. Went here with a couple people, the food was delicious, the ambiance was nice and the service was great. We enjoyed a great dinner and we are happy we choose this restaurant. Would definitely come back here again if I am ever in Vegas again."}
{"text":"Had lunch there recently.  The food was amazing.  The sauces -- mole and the tomatillo sauce both brilliant.  Guacamole was the best I've ever had -- completely fresh.  Service was great, all the food great, atmosphere very nice.  I can't wait to go back.."}
{"text":"Real authentic Mexican food. Wife is very fussy and loved their shrimp. She said it was as good as what we got in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico. I had a burrito that was out of this world. Jose the waiter is a great young man. He treated us like family.  We will go here anytime we're in the mood for Mexican food."}
{"text":"Best hidden gem in Vegas! Food was out of this world! This will definitely be my go-to every time I am in town."}
{"text":"Wow! What a find! We were in the Area and yelp lead us here. The decor was very cool  and beautiful. The cool menu was short but full of quality. Our server was Carlos and he made our experience there extra cool. So we now call him Cool Carlos! We did not have to ask for refills on our cool drinks...very cool, the salsa was amazing...and the chips had a cool chili powder, so they were...cool too!  Cool Carlos explained the menu to us and even helped out with one of our picky eaters! We will be back again! Very cool!"}
{"text":"After living in Las Vegas for 35 years I was not the only one to mourn the closing of El Sombrero. So I was obviously pleased to see it reopen. Went with friends on a Saturday Eve. No reservation but not needed since there were only 2 parties of 4 and 2 parties of 2 (including us). Regardless of the small crowd the service was so bad we finally decided that the owner must have been serving since there he was the only one there and it was obvious he had never been trained for waiting tables. I ordered the stuffed chil with \"brisket\". It came without the brisket which everyone except the waiter heard me order. It was stuffed with what seemed like cream of squash soup and had a cup of dry, flavor-free rice on the side with no sauce or cheese. Friends had quesadilla. Hard to mess up, right? Wrong! It came out greasy and pan fried, burnt like an over done grill cheese sandwich. We collectively decided that this was the worst Mexican restaurant any of us had been to. Call it \"upscale\", \"chic\", \"bistro\", as some reviews state but as the saying goes...\"If it ain't broke, don't fix it, sell it\". Really miss the old place. Worst was not over since me and 1 other member of are party got sick a few hours later. That prompted me to contact Health Dept. Something I have not done to a restaurant in over 20 years. Only upside was the comic relief provided by the unattended hostess stand outside front door. Anyone from Vegas knows that the only foot traffic in that area is transients and tweakers. Very unsafe area especially after dark."}
{"text":"Place was ok  we had a quesadilla and a burrito the quesadilla was ok but the burrito was nasty honestly the only reason im giving it 2 stars its cause of somewhat friendly service and well they forgot to pu in my order and the wait time was bad. im not returning again."}
{"text":"We just had lunch at El Sombrero Cafe. It is in a very old, small building on Main St. that has been modernized inside. The service from Renee was impeccable. She always had a smile on her face & patience to answer all of our questions. They serve a more upscale Mexican cuisine. My vegetarian chili relleno & rice were delicious. It was stuffed with sweet potatoes & firm white cheese with a refried bean paste on top. My husband had the picadillo beef stuffed chili relleno with rice & charro beans & loved it all. Our grandson had the cheese quesadilla stuffed with pork belly & had it gone in no time at all. We ordered some of the best guacamole we have ever had - the real deal! Their chips are perfect & the salsa is good. We will be returning soon even though it is a long drive from Henderson. I saw where some people are boycotting this place due to the owner's endorsement of a presidential candidate. What should that have to do with it? Support small businesses - MAGA!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food. I would recommend this place to anyone that loves authentic Mexican food."}
{"text":"I'm far from a food critic, however, I eat out with some frequency. I must say, my visit to this Mexican restaurant was an unexpected gem. Being from out of town, I relied on customer ratings to guide me into this little establishment. Stroke of genius!! The food, pure ambrosia - only exceeded by the knowledge, attentiveness and sincerity of the staff - from busser to owner! Go here, you'll forever remember the occasion."}
{"text":"We are eating here right now & it's awesome!!  Great food, excellent service & cute little building.  I would give it a 5!!"}
{"text":"The staff at El Sombrero ( JOSE ) who works the lunch hour waiting tables during the week is rude and unwelcoming. Our office is located near the bistro and I often take clients there for lunch. Earlier this week a client and I stopped in for lunch. The gentleman asked if we were ready to order the second we sat down, we said no but we would like to start with water. 2 minutes later he asked again, still not ready, he said if we weren't going to eat we had to leave and literally kicked us out.  The bistro wasn't packed, there were no customers waiting. We thought he was kidding, but he wasn't. I've never experienced anything like it, our company will NEVER take clients there again. Its unfortunate, the owners to keep an eye on its staff and train on customer service. It was appalling and embarrassing."}
{"text":"Yummy food. Excellent service. Looks like a hole in the wall, but it's cute inside. They were great with our kids."}
{"text":"Great time excellent atmosphere. Prices are reasonable but extras ran up costs for the night."}
{"text":"Food was great, service was even better. Great to see a small independant restaurant in Las Vegas. Food was delicious and came out perfect. Special care was given to our drink options and they did not disappoint. I highly recommend this place for a great dinner."}
{"text":"It's also a must-try so for all you people that drive across town for unique and highly-artistic/elevated eats, it is worth driving - at least once - to this flavor palace lcated on Main Street in Downtown LV."}
{"text":"Ok I am totally a fan of this place. After moving here nearly 6 years ago, I have no been able to find a cheese enchilada, like what I am use to. And I liked theirs!   When you sit down you are served salsa and bean dip. The salsa is a little different but good.  We were able to see them making fresh tortillas and they were amazing, yes I had some.   Will be going back!"}
{"text":"From the friendly greeting to the sangria, all the way through the delicious cheesy appetizer to the fluffychocolate Flan, it was a delight!"}
{"text":"Ok, I'm a fan.  Not your traditional Mexican Restaurant and not at all what it 'used to be'.  That said, hi end quality, reasonably priced delicious entrees.  Had an early dinner, and the wait staff was trying hard and succeeding.  Try the Pollo Las Brisas.....superbly done (grilled while you wait)."}
{"text":"I have eaten at this restaurant twice now, and I really want to encourage people to go there.  It's not in a great area, but don't let that dissuade you.  If you like personalized service, EXCELLENT margaritas, AMAZING food, and a comfortable interior, then go to El Sombrero.  They treat their customers right and they really care.  I recommend this place to all my friends when they visit LV."}
{"text":"Delicioso! I took my mom here on her lunch break and we loved it. The sangria here is tasty and the pitchers are ginormous! Jose was our server, he was incredibly knowledgable and so nice. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place was the perfect spot for a Saturday date night. Thanks to yelp, I found this hole in the wall, so small you'll miss it if you blink driving by. I loved the ceiling to floor length mirrors and hand painted flowers on the walls. We came around 630, right before it started to get busy. The owner and staff were all very friendly and warming. I tried both the watermelon and roja sangria, both are delicious, the roja with a heavy red wine taste, but still really good! The vegetarian enchiladas, with wild mushrooms, spinach, and my favorite, tomatillo salsa on top, were too good to focus on anything else. My boyfriend ordered the burrito, enchilada style. Not exactly sure what was in it besides shredded chicken, but it was damn good! And huge.   When I called to book a reservation, I asked about their $50 for $25 deal, they said you can use it on the entire menu. What I forgot to do was buy it on the yelp app so I could actually redeem it at the restaurant (if you see a deal on yelp, buy it right when you open it, I had no idea it would disappear and I wouldn't be able to use it again). I'm assuming it was the owner that was asking around who she spoke on the phone with, and when she got to us, I explained to her what happened, and she said it would be no problem, they would allow us to use the deal anyway. (I don't recommend doing what I did though, just buy it so you can save the server some trouble)   Overall, awesome date night. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Careful you don't pass this one up! It's easy to drive right by it if the old school/retro sign is not lit up at night, so keep an eye out. It's worth it!   Let's start with Jose who greets you with a smile. I went there on a Saturday with a large party. Loved it so much, I went back on the following Wednesday. Jose not only remembered me, he remembered what I ordered.   On to the ambiance - charming with an eye for detail - very nice. The food: spectacular. From the chips and salsa to the appetizers and main courses - all were prepared with the kind of old world love that reminds you what dining should be all about.  If they have it on special, try the hanger steak with three sauces - fantastic!"}
{"text":"I will want to rate this place a 5. However, there were a few things that keeps me from it. The food was great, but there was definite communication errors between us and our server. He was good, but a little sarcastic for us which came off really rude. The restaurant is small with about 10 or so tables and off the beaten path of Vegas. I would definitely go back for the food. I feel like the price was appropriate for Vegas and portions were a good price but not huge. They do close the kitchen early at about 9pm."}
{"text":"What a delight to find authentic Mexican food in Vegas! The food is to die for. The ambiance is amazing. The staff was awesome. I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Food and service are both consistently outstanding  one of our favorite restaurants in Vegas. Try it...you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"OMG, I love this place!  Perfect place to take a date.  It's tucked away, not yet mainstream, and promises an outstanding experience.  Food is authentic, excellent, and presented with a pleasing eclectic flair.  To truly appreciate this place you have to realize that this is THE OLDEST, CONTINUOUSLY OPERATING MEXICAN RESTAURANT in Las Vegas.    I interviewed the previous owner a couple of years ago for a local magazine and simply admired his ability to stay in business.  He quipped the the billboard over the roof made more money than did the restaurant.  Not necessarily a glowing appraisal of his own place.  But the new owners, wow.  They deeply love the business and it shows.    They completely revamped the interior to give a \"millennial\" kind of new age feel.  I don't get the feeling I'm walking into a Mexican Restaurant, rather, I feel like I'm walking into a really cool place that serves REAL GOOD Mexican food.  I give it give five stars because it exceeded my expectations in food, service, and atmosphere.    Dane.  Maralason1@yahoo.com"}
{"text":"This place is really good. One of the best Mexican food I had in a while. Our server Jose was great!"}
{"text":"My go-to Mexican spot in Vegas!!   A very old-school location, with a fresh twist on classic Mexican cuisine in an intimate setting. Have enjoyed many meals here, and it never disappoints.  Grab something straight from the menu, or ask for a chefs recommendation. They aim to please."}
{"text":"Awesome quality food! Erma has done it again!!! Love the decor & ambiance of the place. I have a new secret place to take my dates on lol"}
{"text":"Chips, salsa, guac was delicious. Food was tasty. Portions were small. Pricey. Service was good, but a little bit slow. Not good for small children, they don't even have plastic water cups. Overall good spot to grab a drink, or for a nice date night, when you expect to pay a little extra and eat a little less."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas. It's a small, one room place tucked away in downtown, with tons of charm. The food is incredible and the service is always excellent. I've been back many times and it just keeps getting better. I would highly recommend this place to anyone. Oh, and the sangria is AMAZING. Hands down, the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"Not impressed. Over priced for what you get. Mar y tiera plate only came with two pieces of shrimp! The food took long, and the food was just, ok. Better off going up the street to Casa Don Juan!"}
{"text":"Eating here as I type! I'm a Vegas local and this place is number one in my book! My girlfriend and I had the best experience here. Drinks are good, service is quick, and the staff is amazing! Don't judge a book by its cover. Once you step inside you will be amazed. LOVE THE FOOD!"}
{"text":"Every time I am in town, I try and make it out here for their amazing guacamole.  I've tried the tacos and so far I am happy.  It's not located in the best of part of Vegas.  However, the decor is cute and the food is delicious."}
{"text":"To be fair we should have walked out the second we opened the door.    We were looking for an actual Mexican place to have Margaritas and tacos. When you first walk in it is apparent that this place is a hipster \"Mexican\" food joint.  I noticed a lot of the reviews talking about how cool this place was.  if you're a little pretentious and want to feel like you are hanging with the cool kids, this might be the place for you.  If you want good food go elsewhere  Horrible. Short version A rude waiter, no margaritas, and a TINY $15 burrito that was disgusting.  This is the only time in my life I have left my food uneaten at the table of a restaurant and gone directly to another restaurant."}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times, both for lunch and dinner. The food is great, homemade, and good sized portions! The service is wonderful. If you go there for dinner, you'll meet Jose! He's the sweetest guy and provides excellent service! The atmosphere is very nice, and cozy. This place is a gem. You must try it!"}
{"text":"Seriously fantastic food and service! If you are a foodie- you must try this place. Citrus salad, carne asada...too good!!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place! not a big plate but can get you really full. It's a small place but clean and romantic. The waiters are nice to people."}
{"text":"My wife and I recently relocated to Las Vegas, We Love to dine out and have been doing so pretty regularly since relocating to Las Vegas, new atmosphere, new restaurants, tons of new options for us seeing as though we now live in the hospitality capital of the world. We were every excited, as we are BIG food critics. Over the last 6 months we have tried roughly 30-40 restaurants on and off the Vegas Strip, from mexican food, Asian, Italian, French, American, food, You name it we've tried it, But I must say the experience and food we had at  El Sombrero Mexican Bistro was second to none, all Top Notch freshly made to order food. For a fraction of the cost you would spend on the strip! Most people visit Vegas to gamble, which what most overpriced strip restaurants are, A GAMBLE! I hope I'm gonna get my moneys worth and it's good, No gambling at El Sombrero, just amazing service and quality food at a very reasonable price, oh and the flan dessert they offer is to die, Along with with the Sangria's! Yummy! Thank you again El Sombrero Bistro! We'll be back very soon."}
{"text":"Great service, wonderful food. Customized the dinner for me. Loved the watermelon salad.Would definitely go back again ."}
{"text":"Average food, horrible service. There is a creepy vibe and kids laughing at customers whispering behind their backs. If you want to feel like a tool then go to this place."}
{"text":"Came here last night after seeing all the good reviews and wasn't disappointed. The space is very cute and ambiance was romantic. Only another couple there so service was very good and attentive. Started off with the watermelon Rose' sangria (pink) which was good although a little on the sweet side for me. The watermelon cubes in it were so juicy and good, sad there wasn't more in it. Ordered the guacamole right off the bat. Was supper fresh and delicious. Had homemade chips and salsa which were good as well. Some of the chips had seasoning on them that had a nice kick to them. Ordered the spicy grilled calamari in squid ink sauce. Wasn't kidding about the spice, the squid had a texture I'm not used to (on the soft chewy side). Probably wouldn't order again. Had the chicken mole that our server said was one of the best mole's he's ever had. it was pretty damn tasty. A little on the sweet side for me again, but it had very complex flavors. It was a flavor explosion on the first bite! The BF had the Mahi Mahi which was also recommended in a red sauce over rice. This was very nice as well. Good flavors going on here. This place seems to be a local favorite. I would definitely come back here the next time I'm in Vegas. THANK YOU FOR AN AWSOME MEAL! Sorry for no pics, it was really dark inside and taking shitty pictures of their delicious food wouldn't have done it justice."}
{"text":"The butternut chile relleno was absolutely Delish. Beautiful presentation.  Our friendly waiter Jose made the recommendations. Crisp Tortilla chips with a smoky salsa. We are definitely coming back"}
{"text":"I heard that this was the \" oldest restaurant in Vegas\" so I had to try it. When we arrived I wasn't sure I was in the right place due to the renovations. We tried it anyway and I was sure happy we did. The food was fresh, delicious and came out very fast. Although I forgot the waiter that helped us, he was knowledeable about the menu and knew  what exactly was in the dishes you had questions about. If I am ever in Vegas I definitely would go back again. I'm so curious about the history about his place. For a lifelong New Yorker it had its own parking lot which to me was a plus! Definitely get out and try El Sombrer and you will definitely become a repeat customer."}
{"text":"Yelp came through again.  Great restaurant with amazing food.  Customer service is way beyond just good service.  We have been to several good Mexican restaurants in town but not a great one.  Well we found a great one.   Everything we ate had amazing taste and was well prepared with fresh ingredients.  We will be back."}
{"text":"This was the best food I've had in a while, and Jose, our server was very friendly and helpful. 11/10 would recommend again"}
{"text":"This place changed from a decent \"hole in the wall\" Mexican place to a chic, must eat Mexican bistro. The decor is excellent, staff is some of the best/friendliest in the city, and the food is AMAZING. It's a bit pricier than you would expect from a Mexican restaurant, but once you get your food you realize why. Simple, traditional Mexican dishes have been subtly reinvented...they don't lose their authenticity but everything about them is taken up a notch.   Great place for lunch or dinner. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"First time here. Wanted to try some new restaurants and this was sooo good. Food is awesome the place is so cute. It's not a big restaurant just letting u kno but it's awesome. I would recommend making a reservation for big parties. The staff are awesome and funny. Prices are ok. I would recommend totally."}
{"text":"Came here on Halloween night and the place was completely empty which we didn't mind at all. There was Spanish music playing in the background and the lighting was dim. The server was very attentive and recommended some items that weren't on the menu. I ordered the mushroom enchiladas that came with a large portion of rice and beans.  The enchiladas did not disappoint. The rice and beans tasted like they were homemade and not the canned stuff which is always good to see in an authentic Mexican restaurant. I highly recommend this dish for the vegetarians out there. The place is very intimate it's a perfect spot for a romantic dinner. Can't wait to come back soon!"}
{"text":"We are Mexican food connoisseurs and this is the best we have encountered so far.  Been in Vegas since 1986 and have seen Mexican restaurants come and go.  Check this place out, food and service was awesome!"}
{"text":"Came here with my cousin for a last day of vacation dinner. Jose was great. The tacos with the homemade tortillas were amazing. Please note, ask for a side of mole with the tacos, mind bending flavor, or simply order the mole enchiladas. I plan to next time."}
{"text":"Doesn't look like much outside, but cozy and cute inside. Great guacamole.  Enchiladas are excellent.  Half off today for St. Patrick's Day!  Well worth the trip. Jose is a fantastic maître d', waiter and host!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is so good that we being goinh the for long time has a good mexican food"}
{"text":"We're on a family vacation and my daughter picked this place based on the great Yelp reviews.  If I could give this place more than 5 stars I would.  Our waiter Jose was excellent - he knew all the dishes, was very attentive and friendly.  In fact, if the food didn't make this place he would.  My suggestion would be to get here soon - this time next year you'll be waiting in line to get in."}
{"text":"Jose was great fun as he introduced my parents to the joys of authentic Mexican food! MAKE reservations! This place is small but so worth!!"}
{"text":"Seriously one of the best little hidden gems in Las Vegas. Amazing menu filled with Mexican dishes. And not to mention the best Carne Asada tacos I've ever tasted!! Great atmosphere, great service. Just perfect all around! I'd highly suggest anyone who loves ethnic Mexican food, to take a plunge!"}
{"text":"Nice place. Definitely be going back.  Ate here for lunch. The chips & salsa w/Guacamole are some of the best you will have!!!! Very friendly & helpful staff with above average Mexican food."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Las Vegas once or twice a year for the past ten years or so and I always come to this place at least once during my stay. This time it was on the last of three days in town for a conference and I felt so relaxed the moment I walked in the door, just like coming home. I should be coming here every day instead of eating unappealing, overpriced hotel food. For lunch I had the beef enchiladas with chips, guacamole and salsa with a diet coke. Simple but soooo satisfying. They had some interesting drink specials but I still had half a day of meetings so I couldn't partake. I agree with other reviewers who have said that this is the best Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas and as good as any I have been to anywhere. Service, food, relaxing atmosphere, couldn't ask for more. Thanks, Jose, see you in July!"}
{"text":"This place has authentic flavor! The spicy level for the hot sauce was REAL forehead dripping sweat spice. Lol I liked it.  Our server was awesome (man with tattoos, forgot his name) he described dishes we questioned and also gave us details about the family owned restaurant that's been around for ages!"}
{"text":"Just come in and try. Order the Sangria and bacon jalapeno to start. Everything is awesome."}
{"text":"Simply the best, freshest ingredients and plates for lunch or for dinner. At dinner time, it is beautifully lit and a great place for a date. I always bring out- of-towners here for a meal and when they return, they always want to come back. Great service and excellent, fresh dishes that don't disappoint! Run don't walk to El Sombrero! 5 stars!!"}
{"text":"Read about this place on Yelp and decided to give it a try. Carlos meet us with a warm greeting and was great throughout our experience. The beef tacos were phenomenal.  I like my food spicy and usually have to add to it.  Not the case here!  The flavor and texture were excellent. Some of the best tacos I have ever had!"}
{"text":"Excellent food excellent service and excellent atmosphere.   Worth the cab ride and highly recommended"}
{"text":"Four of us had dinner at El Sombrero before a show at Smith Center as we have several times.   The MahiMahi dish and fajitas were very good and our server, Jose, was always smiling and very attentive.   The owner, Erma, is a very nice lady and came over to greet us and check that all was good."}
{"text":"While we were in Vegas we wanted authentic Mexican. We specifically chose El Sombrero for the high ratings on Yelp.   We didn't want a meal, but to snack on a few tacos. Unfortunately we arrived after 3:00pm and got the dinner menu. We ordered the Guacamole ($8), Quesadilla with Barbacoa ($15) and a Margarita pitcher ($32).   The waiter sold us on the Barbacoa; being slow cooked for 8 hrs with Mexican spices, juicy, melt in your mouth-deliciousness. In all honestly, it tasted like \"roast beef,\"  like something a gringo made from a recipe found on allrecipie.com.   The Margaritas were on the sweet side, but still tasty. The pitcher was a 1L wine carafe filled with 1/3 ice. For $32 this seems pricey. I would expect this on the strip or at Fremont, but El Sombrero is downtown, way off the beaten path. Even the cab driver thought the place was crazy expensive for where/what it is.  The Guacamole was fine but looked like maybe an avocado sized portion.   I've seen the photos on Yelp and they look delicious. Maybe it's what we ordered but from our experience, El Sombreo is overrated. The food was fine, being standard Mexican fare. My issue is the lack of perceived value for the price. Lets be honest, no one goes for Mexican expecting to wear a jacket, debating wether to pay the $65 supplement to have truffles shaved over your foie gras parfait.   Mexican is a 'salt of the earth' type of food. A cuisine that is proud to use less desirable cuts and common ingredients, prepared so skillfully you actually want to eat cow tongue. But it is a 'value' food and you should leave seeing that value. Either it's in size or taste. We left feeling like we paid way too much with the highlight being the complimentary chips and salsa. And while it might seem ironic that I complain about value after mentioning the complimentary item. Complimentary chips & salsa doesn't doesn't justify a $55 bill, + tip + cab ride."}
{"text":"A friend and I went in for lunch, as we had heard that they had re-opened. Surprises from start to finish. Like the outside maître d, very creative for the smaller space. As we both had our work badges on, the first thing our waiter did was acknowledge we were on a time limit and assure us we would have sufficient time to eat and enjoy. First time in fifteen years downtown that has happened! Food was wonderful, service was excellent, and the visit from the Chef greatly appreciated. The only drawback might be that as the tables filled the noise level greatly increased. In that size space, probably not much can be done, but will really keep your conversation private :). We will be going back!"}
{"text":"Try the Chille Rellenos, simply out of this world.  Best I have ever had.  Renee gave excellent service and recommendations"}
{"text":"Amazing find in downtown Las Vegas. Totally did not expect such a great atmosphere and fantastic food. Order out of the ordinary. The menu is both traditional and modern. Go for the modern. The traditional was great. The modern was out of this world. Best service. I will go back."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! The food is amazing and the atmosphere is great! I love supporting small businesses and the community, so this place is a must-go if you love good, authentic Mexican food! And the owners are so nice and sweet too! :)"}
{"text":"What a great find! Located on the way to downtown Las Vegas in a bright teal blue building. The server was super nice the food was amazing and the decor was chic hip and cool. Great food great prices and an absolute gem!"}
{"text":"The enchilidas might be the best in the city.   Fantastic service and drinks as well.   Tacos on the appetizer menu were not so good. They were bland and not hot (temp) when arrived to the table."}
{"text":"We found the restaurant by searching online - we're from the Seattle area and were in LV to see Death Valley. We drove there in our rented car, parked, and were really not worried about the area. Frankly, happy to be off the Strip. The host/server/owner (?) was absolutely delightful - warm, welcoming, easy-going. The food was great, and the Mexican pop mix tape that was playing was fabulous, too! We thoroughly enjoyed our dinner and would go here regularly if it was about a thousand miles closer!"}
{"text":"Decent Mexican food is served at El Sombrero, but it is a little pricey for what you receive. The food came out extremely fast. Almost suspicious how fast it came out! The taste is pretty flavorful and you can tell that the food was made with care.  I was also a fan of the margaritas. Really yummy and they definitely do the job.   Service was great. My server was really attentive and refilled our drinks regularly.   Bathrooms in this establishment are also really clean, which is always a plus!"}
{"text":"This is the only guacamole that I have EVER liked.   There. I said it.   I was dared to try it and I did so expecting, that like all other guacamole, I would hate it. *I do not like avocados leave me alone.* But I absolutely loved it. It is flavorful and paired with their  freshly prepared slightly spicy chips I am in heaven each time I eat it. And Jose, the amazing manager, can tell you. I eat there often.  El Sombrero has been in Las Vegas for years in that same space. We tried the old version years ago and were not at all impressed. This new version of the business is entirely more upscale and creative. They serve many seafood based dishes. My favorite (when I am eating animal protein) is the shrimp fajitas.  They are fresh, and cooked/seasoned well.  I come in way too often to eat their delicious guac and chat with Jose. He is one of those old-school managers who know all of the patrons and is genuinely happy to help you. So often in this town we grow accustomed to mediocre/disinterested service. So when I find a place that has employees who care about service and the food is good, I keep going.   I am definitely a regular----and thanks to the invested and warm service (JOSE!) and that amazing guacamole--I will continue to be."}
{"text":"What a great experience. Service was attentive and food was very nicely presented and delicious. Well worth the short car ride north of the Vegas strip. A must if you are craving Mexican food."}
{"text":"First time vising El Sombrero last night.  Really enjoyed the atmosphere, the food, and the service.  The proximity to Smith Center is a big plus. Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Amazing food and sangria! Our waiter Jose gave great recommendations and outstanding service."}
{"text":"By far the best Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas, maybe the whole world. No joke!  I would eat their mole chicken enchiladas everyday of the week. Fresh ingredients and flavors. Not the usual greasy fair found at most Mexican restaurants where everything is covered in cheese and beans.  The atmosphere can be Intimate dining or business casual whatever your mood. The decor is classy and upscale but not stuffy. Go eat there today!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I had the chicken enchiladas and a watermelon mimosa. The restaurant was cute and the staff was very nice. Best enchiladas I have ever had!"}
{"text":"We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves! The dinner was delicious and the service was excellent. Jose was a great server! Their chips, salsa, and guacamole was also one of the best we've had!"}
{"text":"Delicious food!! Attentive staff!! Super clean! The best guacamole I've had in years! The Albondigas tasted homemade. Hubby had the Chicken Mole. DON'T FORGET TO HAVE A SANGRIA!"}
{"text":"Truly a gem in the neighborhood. Totally worth the drive!  Get the mango jicama salad!"}
{"text":"Nice environment.  Clean and the food was great!  Thank you for turning us on to a great meal Mr. Trump!"}
{"text":"This is a small place so be on the look out. The atmosphere was good, food was excellent and the wait staff were very accommodating.   Fresh guacamole and chips were great and the salsa had the perfect amount of spice and flavor.   Don't miss out"}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem. The service and food are both top notch. We have come here for a few special events and been beyond satisfied each time. Definitely try the sangria and I personally believe they have the best enchiladas in Las Vegas. The waiters are also friendly and funny."}
{"text":"This is the real deal. Awesome Authentic Mexican food. We just had our second great experience there. This place will please the palate and you'll want to come back. Dennis D."}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican.  Enough said. Don't come in here asking for a cheese or bean taco.  Yes you know who you are, oh and unlimited fountain drinks,  drive on and find a southwestern fast food joint,  OK.  But for the true foodies,  the connoisseurs  of enchiladas en mole,  and costillitas en salsa verde step this way.   El Sombreros chef sure knows something about moles, Chiles rellenos,  costillitas en salsa verde.    I ordered the enchiladas en mole,  they were stuffed with chicken and drenched  in a spicy sweet chocolaty dark mole sauce and topped with crema,  onions, cilantro and sesame,  delicious.   Try the the Watermelon margarita it has the right balance of sweet and salty."}
{"text":"I walked into this restaurant at 8:45pm, 15 minutes before they closed and was welcomed with a smile. Not only were they about to close but I wasn't dressed very well to say the least. I value a restaurants quality of service based on how they treat every customer because I've been treated differently based just on my appearance at times. So great job guys! Not only was the service great but the decor and the food was amazing. Definitely check this place out if you are looking to have an intimate dinner with fine dining attributes minus the nose up attitudes of some fine dining restaurants."}
{"text":"After leaving El Sombrero for a very disappointing we don't have this we don't have that I'm going to do my Yelp review from Viva Zapatas. First off I paid $12 for a what was supposed to be a Cadillac margarita which just tasted like mix they were out of their signature chile relleno so my go-to was going to be  the 16 oz ribeye which guess what they were out of that too, that place was a great little spot they have raised their prices to extortion rate prices which is absolutely ridiculous I will not be returning. There's about 300 Mexican restaurants in Las Vegas they need to open their eyes. The waiter was very pleasant very understanding and attempted to fix everything but when you're out of your best dishes I feel bad for the guy. Since he is the front line to represent the restaurant."}
{"text":"It appears I only give good reviews from my profile, but really, it's cause I only take time to yelp for businesses I think are amazing! This place is one such place. The sangria knocked my socks off. The watermelon salad took me to a happy, summery place I could not imagine, and the chile relleno was unique, tasty and just, OMG. The front of this place is deceiving. The inside if kinda chic and not expected. The owner, Irma, is ready available. Service was great and the food was imaginative, and actually tasted as good as it looked! This place is a must!"}
{"text":"Chef Oscar is amazing! We had a sangria sampler followed my 2 pitchers of sangria. The watermelon and the red sangria were our 2 choices for the evening and did not disappoint! The chef sent out his queso fundito to get us started. We had 5 entrees served family style. Halibut, camarones a la diabla, short ribs, and the Del patron for 2. Everything was perfect! The halibut and the shrimp were my personal favorites. The chef wouldn't let us leave without tasting his bread pudding... Nothing short of heavenly. The ambiance was quaint and and sophisticated. I highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I have posted multiple reviews on Facebook, but I felt it to be more useful to the general public to know about this amazing place in LAS VEGAS!  Go in a nice dress, jeans or a suit, you will receive the same stellar service.  Don't be bothered that its on main street at night, it's very quiet and close to Freemont, the strip, the freeway if you want a bite before you go to a SMITH Center show, or anything downtown.  The service is beyond impeccable, the environment is very pretty, quiet and relaxing.  The display of food and dishes are beautiful, they have thought of everything to make you feel like they went the EXTRA mile, for you, their customer.  All the food is so beyond fantastic.  I took my 14 year old son there for the first time a few weeks ago and he wanted to go back the next week for the SALMON.  He loves salmon and he says its the best he's ever had along with the quesadillas.  I wasn't feeling to great and had the soup that resembled a chicken noodle and vegetable soup minus the noodles, it was perfectly spiced. IN the past, I have had the brussel sprouts which I love, I have never tasted something that most people dislike to be so pleasing to the taste buds.  The steaks and the fish tacos were perfect as well.  Then, you have to enjoy the sangria.  Red, white or watermelon, all of them are amazing.  I am having a party soon and am going to have them cater it all; especially the Sangria.  You will not loose, or go wrong with them.  Also, one last KEY point.  I have a shellfish allergy and don't like to eat out too much because many restaurants don't get allergies or the food servers forget to tell the kitchen.  I cannot take a risk.  The owner Irma also has allergies and is beyond cautious and her staff is very well versed in any allergy and they take it extremely seriously.  Please don't think I am laying this on thick, its the damn truth.  They really are as good as anything a restaurant would need to have.  I didn't find anything missing.  Except they should grow and be bigger one day.  So lets support this small business in Nevada; local or tourist alike, you won't go wrong."}
{"text":"Just don't get the appeal of this place.  Staff are very nice and welcoming, would have been a 2 star review without them but honestly, the food tastes like it was microwaved by a cook who has long since given up on caring about his profession.  Everything just tastes bland, including even the salsas! My assessment might be a bit harsh, this place is very popular with local Mexican American people, though I really have to wonder if the appeal is more down to the over-the-top decor.  I guess what really bugs me about it is that it just seems over priced for what it is, $14 for a very meh burrito with no sides etc. is just kind of crazy to me.  They also don't really do any lunch specials so you'll be paying dinner time prices no matter what time of day you go.  As I say though, staff are nice and if you like flamboyant decor the room has a lot of \"flair\" to it."}
{"text":"My new favorite Mexican restaurant!    The boyfriend and I were heading down to First Friday but we weren't feelin' food-trucky, so we yelped places nearby.  El Sombrero popped up a few blocks away. We read the description about it being around since the 50's, but it only had 111 reviews...we were confused, yet intrigued.  We pulled up and it didn't look like much from the outside.  The empty hostess stand out front didn't feel promising, but we stepped inside anyway...WOW.  We didn't expect the dining room to look the way it did.  It felt modern, hip and clean. That wasn't at all what we expected.    We were seated by one of the waiters who quickly brought us out a bowl of chips and salsa, and took our drink order.  The chips were nicely seasoned and although thicker than I typically prefer, I couldn't stop once I got started.  I loved the salsa and the generous serving of it that we received.  We ordered the guacamole which was the perfect size for 2.    I was in the mood for fajitas, but we asked our server which dish he recommended.  He recommended the Del Patron, a platter recommended for 2 people to share, with 3 cuts of steak, Mexican cream corn, potatoes, rice & beans.  Sounded perfect, and it came recommended, so we took the server's advice!    The platter arrived with a generous serving of each type of steak. If I remember correctly it was a filet, hanger, and rib eye. Everything was delicious!!!  The salsa variation is my favorite on the platter - unlike any other place I've been to. There's a smokey salsa, a chimichurri and a super duper spicy one.  They were all good, but my favorite is the chimichurri. Mmmmmmm!   We ended dinner with their version of bread pudding.  No complaints! We practically licked the plate clean :)   We just went back the other night for another round of El Sombrero!  We couldn't help but order the same thing again.   They increased the price of the Del Patron from $45 to $55, but honestly at $45 I was wondering how they were going to stay in business with the portion sizes they give!  We brought my daughter this time as well and she ordered their chicken enchiladas.  Throughout the meal she raved about the food, decor and the atmosphere of the place!  That's a good sign coming from a VERY PICKY and CRITICAL 10 year old :)   The ONLY negative (which I would rate this place a 4 stars out of 5) is that both times our food has been extremely slow to come out...to the point that the server has had to come out and apologize to us for the extended delay. We ordered our meat medium rare so it's definitely not due to the cooking time of the steaks - but maybe they're failing to prep a lot of the sides and salsas and make EVERYTHING on that dish upon order.  I hope they get more kitchen staff or figure out how to cut the waiting time!  Or maybe if they make everything fresh they should just be communicating that upon order so that the extended delay is expected. If they fix their minor service issues, they'll be 5 stars across the board for me!   This place has been around for a while, but I think they've done a great job with modernizing their space to be more relevant to today's diners.  All of the servers are dressed nicely, which is rare in ANY Mexican joint in vegas.  I truly love this place and encourage everyone to try it out!!"}
{"text":"One of our best decisions all week. Gorgeous atmosphere and delicious drinks -- the sangria and traditional lime margarita were EXCELLENT. Do not skip this place. Wish we could take it back to Nashville with us!"}
{"text":"The best find ever! If you are in Vegas from out of town or a local you must come here. We normally stay on the strip while in Vegas (2 to 3 times a year) but I am so happy we ventured off. You would think because of the location it's not what it seems but let me tell you don't pass this one up. I will be sure to come back during every visit besides the staff being amazing and so attentive the food is delicious. I'm on a strict diet and gave in!! But so worth it. And the classics margarita is another must have."}
{"text":"They are closed on Sunday and Monday. Their web site says otherwise. They will correct the error. Ok....we had an 11:30 AM reservation today. We started off with the complementry chips and salsa. My wife had the Street Tacos - Two Carne Asada and one Chicken...excellent. The beef was tender, tasty and the chicken chunks were spicy and plentiful.  I had the Chicken Tamale, so very good wrapped in a banana leaf. The masa was almost like a corn bread light and flavorful. Each meal came with a side od homemade Mexican rice and beans. The best. In addition we each had the red Sangria, sweet and full bodied.   The place is small, well decorated and clean as a whistle. There is ample parking on Main St and a parking lot on the north side of the building.   Our server was spot on and knew the menu. We spoke to her about the recent 'boycott' of El Sombrero that was on the local evening news; she said it was terrible, threatening phone calls, pickets, patrons ordering food and refusing to pay even after they had ate the whole meal. She indicated that these folks were paid troublemakers. The owner had called Metro about the 'squatters' and the FBI when death threats were made. Two or three employees lost their jobs. The 'hate' was spread on some form of social media. It's too bad that this type of thing happens more and more in this city. It's downright disgusting.   Please please support this business, it's a local landmark that has really good food, fantastic service and does not deserve to be treated this way by common street thugs."}
{"text":"We went again, expecting the same great experience we got the first time time! But we were disappointed in that they hadn't updated the menu. I asked for some different items and the waiter had to explain that those items are not available anymore. I ended up having to just pick from a selection of limited items, as it seems like half the menu wasn't available. I felt bad for the waiter who had to basically appologize for the menu. Even the drink menu had non available items on it! Why have the same old menu with all the items still printed on it? They need to white-out the non available items to not misrepresent."}
{"text":"The flavor of the food is amazing I can't wait to come back.  Timing quite off servers lack attention to us.  Of all people don't ignore US :)  But the manager/owners were gracious and helpful at the end!  Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"My husband and I wanted to eat somewhere off the strip one night and chose this place based on the great reviews and yelp deal. I'll admit we were a little skeptical on the walk from Fremont. It really is in the middle of nowhere. But we were so happy we went, the staff was incredibly welcoming and pleasant. We split a meat dish for 2 that was outstanding. So flavorful. 3 different meats with sauces, potatoes and the most amazing creamed corn I've ever had. They don't have a full liquor license yet but the sangria was very yummy. Great desserts and coffee too. If you are downtown and want to eat somewhere with great food, reasonable prices, away from the craziness, this  is the place. It's a bit of a walk from Fremont but definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Would have been better if we didn't get asked to leave (we were not being obnoxious I guess they were going to be busy?). Was not really busy on cinco de mayo. In fairness, the server did say the next time we came in, the first round of drinks were free... nope. They had a \"special\" menu for today also. VERY LIMITED... Won't be back..."}
{"text":"Best Mexican cuisine in Vegas! The food is beyond delicious. Every bite is flavored to perfection. Trendy ambiance with a classic touch."}
{"text":"Went here for the boyfriend's birthday dinner. He asked me to look for a good Mexican restaurant somewhere in or near Downtown, and I found this place based on Yelp... Thanks guys!  The boyfriend called to make reservations for his small dinner party a few days beforehand, but they had gotten the wrong reservation time. We got lucky though 'cause they were still able to accommodate us. There were only 2 servers: Jose and Joaquin (sp). We had also gotten there about 15 minutes before the reservation time we thought had been made, and they were very hospitable and attentive until the entire group got there/trickled in.  Jose was very personable with us, and observed that he was just as courteous to his other patrons. Chatted it up with everyone, making our group laugh, and made us all feel at ease. I have to commend him and the chefs for being very accommodating to one of our friends 'cause he was allergic to garlic - made sure that the dish he ordered was all good for him. Onto more food details... The Sangrias are dangerously good! We had ordered the pitchers of the Blushing Señorita and Blanca. One pitcher of each was not enough for the group. There's this Chorizo special they had that night, and it's a kinda \"make-it-yourself\" taco platter that a few of the friends ordered. Man... Wish I could've had some of that, but I still loved my Enchiladas de Carne! Still wanting more of that as I write this. Got a taste of the boyfriend's Enchiladas de Pollo, and that was just as good. I actually gave him a friendly slap for not finishing his yummy plate, but he did chow down on some good appetizers like Quesillo Fondue Mexicano, chips and Guacamole. Think we spent about $200-$300 for a group of 7, but the food and service was totally worth it.  We definitely will be heading back down there whenever possible (AKA in the area)."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Being from Southern California is not easy to be impressed by good Mexican food. This place rocks! They made me shrimp Diablo, which wasn't even on the menu anymore. Jose is great. Street tacos were super good too. Service was quick and friendly. I would highly recommend. Don't the location scare you off, it's really nice inside. You'll love it!"}
{"text":"They have the best salsa I've ever had! We just left this charming Mexican bistro run by the nicest people! We took a chance a came here based on the reviews... it's off the beaten path. How refreshing to sit down at nice family place that's not a chain! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This is authentic Mexican, not the touristy Tex-Mex stuff found at most of the casinos. The mole was beautifully spiced. The rellenos were perfectly cooked. The sangria was great. The service was attentive. Don't let the neighborhood put you off. This is the best Mexican I've had in a long time."}
{"text":"Excellent food.  I thoroughly enjoyed everything I tasted.  Cheese \"fondue\" appetizer and fresh guacamole were outstanding.  Loved the three taco plate (tried pork belly, carne asada and fish)- the tortillas are insanely small but they packed a lot of protein on them.  (I ordered with no onions/cilantro and sadly they still came on them, but was able to brush off most of them.)  Beans/rice side are tasty and I like them being served in the same bowl- they mix well together.  Wife had the chicken enchiladas- absolutely bursting with chicken.  Margaritas were tasty as well.    Very nice servers, had some problems with ringing up our Travelzoo voucher (two apps/entrees for $35, a good deal) but they eventually got it right.    Highly recommended.  Get off the Strip and their rather piss-poor Mexican joints and eat here instead.  I'd come back in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"This place is amazing, food prepared as seen in the ads, most definately coming back. Thank you Erma and your staff for this great experince."}
{"text":"So good!!! A classy place right around the corner drone my dad's shop. Great food great service luved it!!!!!!   I will be back next time I'm in town!!"}
{"text":"This place is simply fantastic.   The decor and atmosphere is chic and comfortable. It's well decorated and very pleasant. It's a pretty small location, but definitely a bright option in the downtown area.   The food was amazing. There's some items left over from the previous menu, and some new modern Mexican choices. There's a nice selection of options. The food is prepared fresh, making customization easy.   The servers were very friendly, and service was quick. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Best restaurant ever!! Utmost highest quality Mexican food.  The employees are so joyful and happy you can tell they are treated well.  The food is delicious, my stomach is grumbling just thinking about it!!"}
{"text":"I can't jump on the bandwagon just yet -- at least not for lunch. I decided to host a business lunch for six people here and called ahead. The place was not packed so they did not have any issue accommodating us even though I called ahead. Despite calling ahead the seats were still not ready, but that's not that big of a deal. We had two servers and one was better than the other, but neither were impressive. I opted for the watermelon sangria  to start. We also had two sets of spicy octopus which were SWIMMING in the ink/tar. They looked nothing like the pictures posted. These things were smothered and tar black, and bland to boot. I had their carnitas enchiladas for $16 because they were out of short rib for my original option. For $16 their enchiladas looked slightly larger than two taquitos. One person in the party even verbally expressed this observation. I can understand the tiny portion if either the flavor was out of this world, or the price was right. That was not the case. One other person who did not want to appear ungrateful, later admitted they felt that the size of the enchiladas seemed like a cruel joke. The carnitas in my enchilada seemed dry and pretty ordinary. The presentation was lovely and I appreciate the fact that it wasn't smothered in cheese and sauce, but it was still severely lacking.   Six people, the tab was $177 pre tip for lunch...umm ok.  I do see a few dinner items I am curious about so I would give it a chance for dinner again, but I don't see myself suggesting this place for lunch any time soon."}
{"text":"This place was amazing!  The service is excellent and the food matches.  I was surprised to find out that everything was GMO free and mostly organic as well.  I will most definitely be returning to this place.  The restaurant is small and intimate.  It's not what you would expect from the outside.  Give it a try!"}
{"text":"What an unbelievable find. 12 of us escaped from a company sales meeting event across the street at the Fabrizio, and while looking for cabs saw El Sombrero. Fantastic meal ... from drinks, to apps (get the Quesillo Fondu Mexicano), dinner (we all has steaks, I shared the \"Del Patron\"), to the finishing touches of flans.   Forget everything on The Strip ... take the ride downtown and enjoy real Mexican (and Peruvian) dinning at El Sombrero !"}
{"text":"Stopped by for \"breakfast\" a little but before noon after running some errands  downtown, I was craving chilaquiles. I found a Small, cozy, welcoming diner  setting. After José my waiter  assigned me a table and handed  me the menu I found  out they didn't  served chilaquiles... but José as amazing as he is,  told me that the kitchen staff wouldn't  have any problem  cooking the traditional mexican breakfast   for me. One of the best customer service  experiences.I've had in the years I've lived in the valley. Great flavor and  a good  sense of what traditional mexican  food taste like  with a nice twist"}
{"text":"Great service, great guacamole and cool vibe/atmosphere. Moderate priced (not the cheapest place to eat) - But def. delicious food, awesome service (they can't do enough for you) - and a wonderful place  to lunch. We enjoyed it very much!  We asked for a few menu items to be done \"our\" way -- and they surpassed our expectations.  Made exactly to order - if not better than expected.  Def. a downtown destination."}
{"text":"The food is flavorful but extremely overpriced. The fajitas didn't come out sizzling and only come with one large tortilla. The food comes out pretty fast which makes me believe a lot of it is pre-prepared. The guacamole was delicious but it was $8 so uh... #EXPENSIVO.    My tamale was just average and the beans came with chorizo in then so no bueno. The watermelon margarita was yummy though!   Would I eat here again? Yes, but only if I knew someone else was paying."}
{"text":"Adorable interior, friendly, efficient staff & great menu & fresh ingredients! Loved our mole enchiladas & chicken verde burrito. Really great meal & experience!"}
{"text":"Great food, good prices, good portion sizes, great service.  It's worth making the quick trip over from Fremont st to check this place out.  We had a table of 6 and they had no problem accommodating us."}
{"text":"I don't usually Yelp but thought it would be irresponsible not to tell others about this gem of a place. We came for dinner tonight with a large group. My friend had heard about it from a list of places that Anthony Bourdain recommends. Well it was outstanding. The red sangria, best I've ever had. I had the shrimp el diablo, I could drink the spicy red sauce. And also tried the special hanger steak, perfectly cooked. The place itself is adorable. Newly renovated apparently. The decor was modern yet warm. Jose was our server, what an absolute doll! The service was super friendly and extremely professional and attentive. Half our table was kids and they were so nice to them. Met the owner at the end. Such a cool, wonderful woman. Can't wait to eat here again next time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Not from this area....found online and fell in love with Jose, the server.  Great food, good prices...GREAT SERVICE!!!"}
{"text":"I went to a private event here this evening. This restaurant is about to open again soon. It's been completely renovated and absolutely beautiful! The food is divine! The steak, chicken enchilada, and bread pudding were delicious! I can't wait to come back when it opens to the public."}
{"text":"Awesome food. Unfortunately,parking is a little difficult due to construction. I've tried almost everything on the menu and it's unbelievable. I suggest you start out with watching Vice Las Vegas on youtube and you will see. This is the oldest Mexican restaurant in Nevada."}
{"text":"As people have mentioned, you can drive by without seeing the place but it is not hard to find as it is on a major street.  Parking lot is small but it does not have that many tables so it is adequate. The ambiance is what you would expect from such a small place and somewhat minimal. The wait staff was very personable and greeted us right away. We were there during a 'brunch' time so all the dishes had eggs even though it was 2 pm. I am not sure if we could have asked for an alternate menu or not but decided to be adventurous.  The salsa was different but interesting and it grew on you the more you had! The food was good (not exceptional IMO) but was more expensive than I think it should have been but it seems Las Vegas has completely moved away from the 'cheap food to get them in here to gamble' idea and all the food places have done the same (the famous $5 foot long at Subway is $7.50!!). I certainly would recommend but be aware of the prices."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was good (a dull roar, w music), food was delicious (excellent chips & salsa). Service was good, but because we used the Yelp $30 for $15 deal and had a party of 7, that somehow justified an automatic gratuity charge of 20% (despite the menu statement of automatic gratuity for only parties of 8 or more). We were told to talk to the manager but didn't want to deal w the hassle. Not sure if using the Yelp deal automatically leads to included gratuity, so may be good to ask before buying it."}
{"text":"I Stayed on Fremont st a few weeks ago for my wedding anniversary. We were looking for a vegetarian friendly mexican restuarant in the area. There were quite a few options but none seemed too impressive.  Did a little research and  stumbled upon \"El Sombrero\" While it did not have a huge selection of veggie options , the choices they did have sounded amazing!  We took a chance. Sooooo glad we did. As we walked there from our hotel as we came upon it, From the outside I didnt expect much. Boy was I suprised. The decor is inviting and very cute. I loved the mirrors with the mexican quotes.. Some familar and some I hadn't heard. We were greeted by Jose. We were the only ones in the whole place. We immediately felt welcomed.  His service was genuine and welcoming.. Such a nice guy! My husband and I both ordered the butternut squash  chile renello.  We let him (jose) know that we were vegetarian. He immediately changed out the beans it comes with  to a veggie option. The sauce was amazing.you can tell these recipes are well thought out and made with love! I'm a bit of a mexican food snob..and I was immediately taken back to Mexico.  Not you run of the mill bean,cheese and more cheese,  poor excuse for mexican food  that saturates the area.  A real Gem! I wanted to drink the sauce up!! We also had the house made margaritas. Equally amazing!!  Made with fresh limes. You could immediately taste the HUGE difference from the gross syrupy drinks on the strip. We had the greatest time and didn't want to leave or go back to the overwhelming area of Freemont.. Hands down the best dining experience ever!! You can tell they care about the food and take the time to prepare everything! I hope this place stays around for a long time as we come to vegas every year for our anniversary! We will definitely be back!!  a new tradition for our getaway! I LOVE El sombrero!!!  Thanks you for everything!!! \"El que no toma vino, entonces por que vino\""}
{"text":"This place was recommended to me and I went for early dinner. While there are only 11 tables in the restaurant, there was another couple there eating besides myself.  The homemade salsa is great, but maybe a little too spicy as the jalapino bits stung my tongue. The waiter filled my water and beverage glass and brought me another round of salsa and chips. I thought the service was well paced, but he was a little pushy in getting me to get a pitcher of sangria to drink, I had to say no 3 times before he stopped. I'd rather make my mind up on what I wanted to drink instead of being told what I needed to order. After I said no to the sangria, it was the cucumber lemonade he wanted me to try. LOL I appreciate suggestions, but please don't be pushy. I had the chicken tacos with the beef enchilada and it was very good! I will be back!"}
{"text":"Good place for lunch. Fast service. Delicious and authentic food. Definitely not a chain, which is part of the charm and great atmosphere. Carne enchiladas and chicken burrito were fantastic!!"}
{"text":"An upscale-looking Mexican joint in the questionable part of Main Street? That's El Sombrero! They've received a lot of worthy Yelp love for their brunch and lunch specials- I came for the latter.   Lunch menu offers several choices. I got the chile relleno, which is a solid vegetarian (but not vegan) option. Add chicken or brisket for an additional charge to make it more hearty (and less vegetarian). Sides of rice and beans were well-done staples, the chile itself was nicely stuffed and blistered- brisket was a good amount but underseasoned. $17 for lunch is a bit steep for a \"special\" but I enjoyed the food and atmosphere.  Interior is a modern black and white scheme with clever Spanish quotes written on the mirrored walls and nice light fixtures. Staff was very welcoming and helpful, takeout order was packed nicely and even included the chips and salsa you usually miss out on by not dining in!  Would try again for brunch. Food is flavorful without being greasy, covered in cheese, or overly spicy like many people expect for Mexican cuisine."}
{"text":"Went early on a Saturday night. They were short-staffed, but the service was still great. I ordered the beef taco and chicken enchilada combination. The enchilada was great and the beef taco was fantastic. The beef was very flavorful and cooked perfectly. Slightly crispy and super tender and juicy without being greasy. The food was excellent and the service was fast and friendly. Decent prices, you're not going to find sit down Mexican food for much less. I can't recommend this place enough."}
{"text":"Thank you for amazing food and impeccable service!  Jose was so prompt and courteous and explained everything in detail. His recommendations were so helpful and guided me towards the delicious sangria!  The fish tacos were out of this world!  Cannot wait to go back and try everything else and try to save room for dessert!"}
{"text":"I love the ambiance and decor of El Sombrero. I am always on the look out for new restaurants. Especially downtown Las Vegas because thats my hood.  I was presently surprised when I had my date night there , I really have high expectations, especially on date night. My husband is very particular and unlike me will not eat many peoples food. Well El sombero did it for us. The food was spectatular, The Fish was fresh, the skirt steak was perfectly cooked and the service was great, The owner came by and chatted and the chef sent by a treat from kitchen, The sangria was flowing and we even ate the fruits from the pitcher for Dessert, I love a date night that you can drink be merry then walk home. My Sombrero off to you."}
{"text":"We chose this intimate and romantic Mexican bistro for our last night in Las Vegas. Everything that we had was the best of its kind that we've ever enjoyed: Best chili relleno (with butternut squash!). Best enchiladas, perfectly seasoned with spinach and mushrooms. The red sangria was perfect. The manager brought us a sample of their watermelon sangria--also wonderful. We finished with the best flan ever. Thank you, El Sombrero, for a night to remember!"}
{"text":"Soooooo DELICIOUS!! You ever go somewhere to eat...finish your meal...and love it so much that you wanna start all over and do it again? That was us. And the waitress was so friendly and we spoke about the food and a little bit of the history. She was amazing. The restaurant is so clean and had music playing. We really enjoyed our lunch very much. Thank you El Sombrero!"}
{"text":"We were warmly welcomed by our very friendly server Jose which set the tone for the whole visit.  The food was very nicely prepared and the decor was very warm and inviting.  I've been to El Sombrero BEFORE the current iteration and this is a really welcome improvement to the oldest Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Super cute place, delicious and the Watermelon sangria was amazing. Great customer service!"}
{"text":"Excellent surf -n- turf fajitas! Freshly made tortillas & great margarita's- ask for Jose' he's an awesome server as well."}
{"text":"Amazing Mexican food and delicious Sangria! Great service and beautiful interior.  Will be back;). Ask for Jose!"}
{"text":"My friend and I ate there last night, the best, couldn't wait for the place to reopen, worth the wait, I had the skirt steak, with cilantro rice and street corn, served on a board,really kool. Tried the blanco and rojo sangria, couldn't decide which I liked better, both were good. Chef and owner Irma came out to chat. Jose our waiter was excellent service and knew all about the ingredients in all the items, dined during the day into dusk, looked like a very little romantic setting in evening with candles and very dim lighting, looking forward to going again. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"After four days of staying on the strip for a technology conference, a friend and I were in desperate need of an alternative to the noisy, expensive, hyper-trendy celebrity chef restaurants that crowd Las Vegas Blvd., and this place looked like a good candidate. As out-of-towners, we had some doubts when our cab driver dropped us off on a dark stretch of main Street a few blocks South of Fremont Street, but that all changed when we walked through the  front door of El Sombrero. The atmosphere was warm and inviting, and our waiter took full responsibility for making sure we had a great experience. That included recommending a Mexican cheese fondue appetizer, a nightly special pork chop entree, and flan for dessert that were all delicious. It was very nearly a perfect meal--and the ideal antidote to the noise, lights, and crowds we'd been subjected to all week."}
{"text":"We are relatively new to Las Vegas. Based on the great reviews, we decided to try El Sombrero. The street, the are, the parking lot and outward appearance had us second guessing ourselves. Then we walked into a beautifully designed  cantina with unique and interesting decor details. We were warmly greeted and seated. We ordered the steak dinner for two which had 3 types of steak, creamed corn, rice and beans, tiny potatoes and 4 dipping sauces. I did not know that steak could be that tender. The flavors were divine, the potatoes were like tasty cloud puffs. My husband and I felt guilty for using a coupon. We felt like we underpaid! HIGHLY RECOMMEND."}
{"text":"Delicious food! Accommodating for kids, nice atmosphere. Tiny place, but welcoming and comfortable. Great for families, lunch or a date. The sauce on the chicken enchiladas was delicious, as was the guacamole."}
{"text":"I love coming in for the Sangria.  I love the cinnamon that is added. adds a great depth.  love the food as well.  great local restaurant."}
{"text":"Great food and service.  It is a quaint establishment and you are treated like family.  I would highly recommend eating here.  The sangria is amazing!!"}
{"text":"Oh man. Wow. This place the food and service was awesome. I had shrimp Cazuela sooo good. The watermelon margarita was great. I wish they had a restaurant where I live. Awesome."}
{"text":"Unfortunately this was not an enjoyable dinner experience. When we arrived at a little before 8pm the restaurant was empty and we had to look on the kitchen to find anyone working! The employees made it obvious that they were annoyed that my party of three had arrived when they thought they were going home early. Fortunately another party of three arrived and we weren't the only people there. As you might imagine the food was only mediocre and the service poor. We had to go into the kitchen again to find someone to bring us a check! I would suggest staying away from this restaurant and I will not go back!"}
{"text":"The food and drinks at El Sombrero is like nowhere else. The food is fresh, delicious and unique. The service is exquisite and the ambience is peaceful romantic, and cozy. I could eat there every night. I give the restaurant a five. Don't hesitate to try the desserts, they are scrumptious"}
{"text":"You can tell you are in for a treat as you walk to the front door.  The vintage sign brings with it the feeling of old Vegas.  As you open the front door and walk inside, you are transported into a modern ambience yet still connected to the historical significance that this place represents. I was quickly greeted  by friendly staff that reminded me of the type of world class customer service that makes Vegas Unique.  The food exceeded my expectations.  I tried an assortment of dishes, but my favorites were the bacon wrapped jalapeños, yes they are as delicious as they sound, my mouth is still watering.  The guacamole was a bit bland for my taste, but a bit of salt helped that out.   Try the tacos!!   And of  course the dessert....one bite of the flan will make you a fan for life.  It is addictive!     My advice, ask the waiter for help selecting what to order, sit back enjoy a glass of wine and prepare to experience world class dining at Las Vegas prices."}
{"text":"Had no idea this place was back open. The last time I was here was back in 2009. They closed up a couple years ago and the waitress told us one of the owners friends bought it. The food is still really good but it now has a brighter modern touch.  When we arrived I was thinking maybe nobody else knows they are still open. This was on a Saturday around 5:30 and there was just one couple eating inside.  So we looked over the menu and ordered up some guacamole. And I had the carne Asada enchiladas. And my wife had the chicken enchiladas. I love how they put the beans and rice in a separate bowl. I'm not a big fan of Mexican rice. But I love there's with the beans. There chips and salsa was pretty good. Not spicy but a wonderful flavor. The chips are homemade and pretty crispy. So as we ate our meal the restaurant filled up pretty quick. There were parties of 6 & 10 and just your regular couples. So we arrived at a great time.  We will be back  TIP: check in while at the restaurant thru YELP and get 10% off entire meal"}
{"text":"Amazing food and service. Will definitely visit every time I'm in Vegas. The best chile verde I've ever had and the pork belly eggs benedict for brunch is to die for!"}
{"text":"Intimate atmosphere and outstanding food. The filet and veggie enchiladas were very flavorful and had an upscale flare from other places. The service was also top notch. This place is a must try."}
{"text":"Gross. We tried to eat dinner here and both had the worst attempt at fancy mexican food ever. Next, know that they do not have margaritas. I ordered veggie enchiladas which ended up being tomato paste covered spinach inside of a corn tortilla. The rice tasted like cold tomato paste rice with a few old peas. My husband ordered chicken tacos. They ended up being fried tortillas with literally only chicken inside them. The menu does not actually tell you what they have, nor is the menu online the menu they have in the esrablishment. Do yourself a favor and skip it."}
{"text":"Spent the same amount of money here that i spent at Wolfgang puck in summerlin.  Food was ok I guess but what made it a bad experience was the service, inattentive, going through the motions and not happy to see is there.  Room is actually nice but very small for my taste.  If you want Mexican food that is good and real, avoid this place."}
{"text":"This is my spot! The food is delish. The service on point. The owner, Irma Aguirre, is what every downtown biz owner should be, real."}
{"text":"Place was small, yet so pretty & food was great!! And not to forget our host \"Jose\" was super friendly.  A must visit Mexican place n they have good (also tasty) options for vegetarians too."}
{"text":"I REALLY wanted this to be my new favorite go to restaurant in Downtown, but I'm not sure it's in the cards.  The first three to four times we went there, the food and customer service were great.  The last three times, the food has been served cold and the service very slow.  It's the little things; LONG wait times for our first order of sangria, refills on chips and stale tortillas with the hanger steak special, even when there is only one other couple in the restaurant.      The guacamole is good, but overpriced for the amount you receive.  It should either be half the price or they should serve twice the amount.  We took some friends from our neighborhood and called before to see if they had a corkage fee for bringing your own wine and were told they did not.  The next time we took friends and brought our own wine, the corkage fee jumped from $0 to $20 per bottle.  When I inquired, we were told \"that's what other properties on the strip charge\".  Well, we are not on the strip.  Don't get me wrong, I don't mind a corkage fee, but $20 is a little outrageous, especially considering they only offer a few wines.    Before writing this review, I tried to give them this feedback via a private email through their website, but never heard back.  I am hoping that by writing this review they will revisit their corkage fee and ramp up their customer service.  We live less than five miles away and would love for this to become our go to restaurant."}
{"text":"Amazing service, great food.  Can't wait to go back  Every single person from our group was impressed"}
{"text":"Another Yelp Winner! Stopped off mid road trip for a bite to eat.  Yelped local spots and found El Sombrero. We were wondering where we were driving through sketchy downtown streets... Including a road closure with guns drawn (no lie), but when we pulled up we saw some decent cars that still had rims on them so we felt a bit better.   The inside does NOT match the outside. Food was yummy!  We had: Vegetarian enchilada Chicken Enchilada Guacamole Super secret spicy chili.  It was all great. Hit the spot. Fresh and tasty. No grease!"}
{"text":"I stopped in Friday night for this just reopened gem. The restaurant has been completely remodeled and has great food. This is not your typical rice and beans Mexican cafe. It has a number of terrific dishes both as entrees and small plates. I tried the halibut and it was outstanding. Outstanding chef. Decent wines. Cute interior. This immediately had become my favorite downtown restaurant."}
{"text":"This was recommended by some friends, don't know why. The waiter Jose was very rude said he was going to close because no one was coming in,then we said we would leave and he said ok. Then 2 other tables walked in and he said he was staying. We should have left because the food is outrageously priced and it was not very good. The best thing we ate was the guacamole. The drinks were watered down ,the food was not very good especially for the price. What a mistake this was. I highly recommend you don't even go ,there are so many great Mexican restaurants in Vegas. Stay Away."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with some coworkers and it was a great experience. The complementary chips and salsa are always a bonus. I had the chile relleno and it was delicious. Definitely would come back."}
{"text":"What a gem! We came in very early for dinner after attending Big Band Saturday at the DeCar Events Center down the street (see review). Little white stucco building that can easily be missed.  Proves looks can be deceiving as you're surprised how cute and quaint the place is decorated. Sangria was great (white&red), chips homemade, salsa yum! Guac on point! The parradilla platter w/chorizo, chicken and carne was good but next time I'm stepping up the $10 for the rib eye and prime rib selection. Beans and rice tasty-and the cream corn was unique (in a good way). Coming next time after a Smith Center outing or just with the girls to suck down Sangria.  Recommend!!"}
{"text":"Eva heard of the saying dont judge a book by its cover? Samethang applies here. On the outside its not much to look at and u may ponder should u enter. But once u do enter its cute inside. You will wait on your food it will arrive hot. Eva heard of anythang worth having is worth waiting fa? Samethang applies here. The food is addictive. The drinks will wow you. The custumer service is to die for. I simply didnt know I could be treated with this much kindness in a city called sin. If your hungry you have got to try this."}
{"text":"I don't get all the Five Star Reviews... Yes the chips, salsa and guacamole was very good... However my entree was not to my liking... Is that enough for a two Star review... No... But when you have to chase down  waiter several times for the simplest of things, the loud Music, and the prices... Yes... This dining room can't be more then 1000 sq feet... Not to mention only 4 tables were full... So why the bad Service... The waiter never came to check on us... Had to chase him down for our check... Again this restaurant is a thousand square feet... He couldn't hear it excuse me.... The music was so loud...  They have live music that was so loud it was insane... If you want upscale Mexican restaurant... That's about the same price and much, much better food... Go to the El Dorado... Not to mention it has a wonderful atmosphere... Phenomenal service... The chef comes out and meets everybody... That's a pleasurable dining experience...   How can anybody give this restaurant five stars?"}
{"text":"Not really what I expected. I thought this was a mom and pop place. Turned out to be pretty snobby, fufu, little portions and overpriced. I left the place hungry.   The sangria tasted like potpourri. I asked for a watermelon and got a white one.  The service around me was ok. The service I received was AWFUL. The guy apparently is going to work at a Mexican restaurant at Red Rock Casino. The young lady working with him seemed very professional and she was very nice. It was her first night. I think the place is lucky to get rid of that guy. He seemed so overwhelmed. When my party first entered I was immediately asked if I had a reservation. No hello or welcome. There were 4 parties and he seemed like I was the party that threw him overboard. Took forever to get our order placed. We ate 2 bowls of chips waiting for our order to be taken. The main entree was so tiny it was like a small appetizer. Really disappointing. Not sure if my experience would have been better if I had shaved and not worn a t shirt.  For the sake of the business I hope they are better to others than they were to me.  I'd love it if the mom and pop came back and got this place right again."}
{"text":"Wonderful place tucked away from Vegas' hustle and bustle. Delicious quesadilla and enchiladas, handcrafted by doting chefs. I loved the salsa that arrived with the chips, as it had a smoky taste. Carlos provided my mom and I with sincerely warm service."}
{"text":"Have you ever experienced an orgasm eating? If I said delicious it would be an understatement!"}
{"text":"Off the charts great! Jose provided premium service and the killer margaritas and great food was as good as you can get.   Highly recommended! And Canadians don't lie or exaggerate!"}
{"text":"Found this place as a little surprise off of Main Street during construction. Jose was the best waiter! So sweet and funny and told us exactly what he loved on the menu. The food is authentic and delicious, I loved the fajitas and my boyfriend really enjoyed trying all the different tacos! Also there jalapeños wrapped in bacon are to die for!!!! Definitely recommend to anyone who loved authentic Mexico City cuisine!"}
{"text":"Worth the trip- cute place, good service, and the food was amazing.  Ordered the Parrillada for 2 and everything was incredible. The chips and salsa are dangerous.  The cream corn was off the meter as was the Sangria. Such a refreshing atmosphere with how small and intimate it is.  Nice date spot or a place to take people who want to see a more novel side of Vegas.  Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Cute setting, nice music, friendly staff. I ordered fish tacos I wish they had more fish in them but other then that I have no complaints my corn tortillas tasted freshly made and my partners burrito was a decent size and delicious as well."}
{"text":"This place has great authentic Mexican food and the staff are friendly and passionate about their food. We were just visiting but would go back to get more delicious food."}
{"text":"I had dinner at this place today for the second time the food and drinks were so amazing and the service is the best, the server was super friendly and funny I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"I have a lot of respect for details. I would argue that details leave a indelible impression: always.   From the feel of the silverware to the lightly dusted tortilla chips make this place a favorite. It is not ordinary.   I was very impressed by the child pepper type spices dusted on the chips.  The salsa was unique as well.  There was the traditional 'smoky\" flavor but then there was something with just a hint of lightness or sweetness.  Although, I don't know that sweetness is the correct adjective.   I enjoyed my brisket enchilada but felt that the brisket was a bit bland for an enchilada.  However, the meat was tender and was still tasty.  I had a bite of carne asada and would recommend that meat if you are looking for a more traditional flavor.  Also, there was not  enough enchilada sauce on my enchilada.  I know this is a pet peeve of mine but I feel it is important.  There is a right balance for the sauce and I just don't feel it was met.   The guacamole was very yummy. It tasted fresher than another very high profile Mexican restaurant I know, but there was a more dominant lime flavor that was very agreeable.    The flan was truly a surprise.  It was textured (see picture) and the carmelized sugar was slightly burnt as is traditional in a flan.  It tasted great.  If you like the traditional smooth texture it might not be for you.  However, the carmelized sugar was very delicious and the flan itself tasted like a flan should.   If you are looking for some Mexican comfort food with a twist this may be the place."}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday today and had a wonderful experience! The staff was excellent, very attentive and on top of everything. The food was great: I had the combination of a brisket beef taco and chicken enchilada with rice and beans. My husband had the el sombrero burrito and said it was also amazing. My daughters had the cheese quesadilla with guacamole and the chicken flautas and both aid they were delicious. We also love the chips and salsa as well as the guacamole. All the food was fresh and homemade! To top it off, they brought me a complimentary piece of their bread pudding that was perfection, sang happy birthday to me and it even had a little candle it. The ambience was intimate but still family friendly and the decor was modern. We highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I went with a few family members and we had the #1 combination plate, chicken enchiladas and pulled pork enchiladas. The food was good, worthy of the 4stars. However, it took us an hour to get our food(mind you only two other people were in the restaurant).  Don't let the areas its in fool you, it is a good place to eat."}
{"text":"Such a nice place!!! Glad we have something like that at downtown . Keep up with a nice work."}
{"text":"Saw this place on Yelp, thought we would try it out. It is decorated cute inside, but unfortunately the table we were at was very close to a wall and my husband and I had to shimmy our way into our seats like a booth. We were greeted by Jose (I believe) who was warm and welcoming. He suggested the margaritas and the sangria. We ordered both, I didn't taste the margarita, but my sangria was the best I've ever had! Soooo good! I ordered the chicken enchiladas and they were ok, there wasn't a whole lot of flavor to them. My husband ordered the prime rib and ordered a side of rice and beans. When his dish came out our waitress said the cook put their creamed corn as the side instead, but she never brought the side of rice and beans that he ordered. However, the creamed corn was so delicious! We were kind of happy for the mix up  everyone in our group said their food was good, not great, but good. We asked the waitress if she could split our check and she said she could only split it 50/50, that was a disappointment, but oh well, we worked it out."}
{"text":"The oldest Mexican restaurant in Nevada.  Has the best Mexican food outside of Mexico!"}
{"text":"I would have to say this Mexican food is very good, it would be like having my own family in the kitchen. Try the salad with jicama and mango, so good. What a change from what this restaurant used to taste like. Very classy and stylish inside."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food , service was great too. Everything from the chips and salsa and dessert were delicious. Also had a Cadillac Margarita it was amazing . Jose was amazing and very nice will be coming back !"}
{"text":"New owners, new decor, new menu and an excellent meal. Everything was very fresh and delicious. The sangria is handcrafted and not to be missed."}
{"text":"I hated this place .the person in charge was rude and didn't want to attend us .we got there at a little after 8:30 pm .He told us we had 5 minutes to decide on the menu.Complaint that he hated travelzoo because people who bought these occupied all their tables on the weekend and they didn't make any money.He furthered said he will talk to the owner and tell him .Not to accept travelzoo any more. He also forced us to buy drinks .Because according to him it was mandatory and that is the way they do things . Yet the vouchers small print didn't say we had to purchase a drink . He insisted that we had no choice.And to top it off the waiters completely ignore my husband and I the whole time .In fact when they brought our meal .They did so with such disdain and asked sarcastically every time\"where do you want me to put this\" referring to the plates.(btw tables are soo small) We had to approach waiters several times ourselves to request condiments .Otherwise we would never get attended . At the end of this nightmare and ok meal.Drum roll ....:The manager had the nerve to include a $ 12 gratuity in the bill .Ive heard of this getting done for large party's not for a party of 2. Last time I checked we live in the  United States .The gratuity is earned for good service .Not forced out of people. This man should be trained in the art of customer service.It would go without saying that I do not recommend this restaurant at all ! Thank you for the horrible memory you gave my husband for his birthday.So much for celebrating it!! I wish I could be just like Donald trump in the apprentice and say sir \"YOU ARE FIRED ! \""}
{"text":"Had a great lunch date. Got the tacos and you can mix and match the meats. Also the carna asada fajitas and chips and guacamole.  Everything was really good.  Will be back again. Would recommend checking it out"}
{"text":"I went to this spot last weekend. The service was good, it wasn't too busy but they mentioned they had to turn away people the night before because it's starting to get pretty popular. The design of the restaurant is amazing, my hat goes off to who ever was in charge of the decor and overall ambience. The food was really good, only thing is I requested avocados or guac with no onion with my meal (or even as a side) because I HATE onions, and neither option was available. Not clear on that one. They said they don't even have avocados which means the guac is likely made somewhere else or bought pre-made or made there and they had no left over ingredients. I would love if they would make side table guac an option on the menu. It's always great to watch your guac made fresh at your table and brings me back to mexican restaurants. I like knowing the food is fresh and made fresh. The other let down was their lack of margaritas. I mean you're a mexican restaurant, break out the tequila will you? Our waiter also checked on us way too much. It was starting to get annoying if I'm being honest. Now on to the important stuff, the food. I ordered the chicken tacos and they come on this cutting board thing with all of the toppings to dress them yourself. I love that, super cute and fun. They were also pretty yummy. The portions were good and the bill was only $60 for three people. Two of us got this fancy watermelon sangria which was good but I would prefer to have had a fresh made margarita. I'm giving this place three stars because they have a few kinks to work out. They only had one desert option, bread pudding, meh. They said they will be adding more to the menu soon. I'm also used to really fresh authentic mexican food so I have high standards when I dine for Mexican food or even modern mexican style cuisine. This place is great, I do recommend it and I will go back....I'll update my review next time if anything changes."}
{"text":"This is a must try for anyone in Las Vegas! Located in the Arts District this place makes sure you feel like you are in a hip and exciting place.  Now about the food, speechless does not begin to express how good the food is.   My amazing wife had the Red Sangria and could not stop raving about it,  and she knows her Sangria for sure.   We hope they get into the brunch business with a bottomless option for sure!"}
{"text":"So completely worth escaping The Strip for this excellent lil spot! Food was SO GOOD, very Mexico City. Service was warm and informative. Sangria was perfect, ambience was great. We can't wait to go back, will always stop in when visiting LV.   Viva!"}
{"text":"Easy to find and get to, but small enough that if you're not paying attention, you can drive right by El Sombrero.  It's hiding in plain sight.  The dining area is very small, only seating 50-60 people, making it a fine place for a party of four or less, but it's not a good place for a large group.  The dining room is very clean and it appears to be recently renovated.  While not a bad thing, the decor gives an almost sterile or minimal feel to the place.  I get the impression they want you to be there for the food, not the atmosphere, so on to the food!  The food was served very hot, just as it was prepared.  It was tasty, but not the kind of fare I'd rave about, especially given the great assortment of other Mexican restaurants available to Las Vegans and our visiting guests.  This leads to a criticism:  for what it is, the food is overpriced.  It's probably double what it ought to be, giving me the impression the restaurant is trying to establish itself based on pricing as something a bit more high-end or trendy than it actually is.  Because of the price, I almost rated El Sombrero two-stars.  Even so, time will tell if they've priced the menu appropriately.  To counter the cost of the food though, the waitstaff was excellent.  We were greeted with a genuine smile by the host, and our waiter waiter was just as nice.  As our food came out, other waiters helped, ensuring all our food arrived together.  Because of the small size, the waitstaff was ever present in a good way, and never overbearing.  Our drinks were never empty.  The service was definitely above average and caused my review to edge closer to four stars.  One additional criticism though:  the music was a little too loud and even distracting at times.  There's dedicated parking off the street in a private lot along side the restaurant, between the restaurant and the taxi service next door.  It's a small lot, but there's sufficient room to accommodate patrons even if the restaurant is full.  Keep in mind, the lot is pretty tight.  If you drive a large vehicle or you're not comfortable maneuvering in a narrow lot, you may find parking difficult.  For all the pros and cons I mentioned, I think El Sombrero is a solid choice for Mexican cuisine if you're nearby.  While I wouldn't strongly recommend it, I wouldn't warn people to stay away either.  This is one you'll need to try for yourself and decide what you think.  I'd love to know!"}
{"text":"Great meal! We loved this small place with huge flavor. Extremely authentic Mexican food with a modern twist.  My wife and I will definitely be back.  By the way it's about the food NOT THE POLITICAL VIEWS."}
{"text":"Beware of what may be in your salsa!! I work downtown and go out to lunch everyday. I was so happy to hear that El Sombrero had reopened.  So I invited a coworker to go with me to tryout the new menu. The restaurant has been completely  redone. It looks really nice. The waiter promptly arrived at our table with the complimentary chips and salsa. We started to eat the chips and salsa when my friend felt something at the bottom of the salsa bowl. To our surprise it was a stick of chalk  We called the waiter to tell him about it. He pick up the chalk piece and the bowl of salsa without saying a word. He came back with a new bowl of salsa. My coworker and I were stunned. He never said Sorry. It was as if nothing had ever happened. At the end of our meal we thought that the manager would stop by and say something but no one did.  I was very disappointed with the service. It really overshadow the food. My order number was #836 (10/6/14)."}
{"text":"Had dinner there last night and it was amazing Good job Irma we came by to support your restaurant"}
{"text":"Love this place! It was great when it was a hole in the wall traditional Mexican restaurant and was sad to see it close, but the new owners have livened up the decor and the flavors.  Mexican creamed corn is fantastic as are the rellenos"}
{"text":"Went here on Saturday 9/2/2016,,, we each ordered the 3 taco dinner.The food was just ok. The portions were small. The service was good.... even the cockroach near our table seemed to like it there. The restaurant is supposed to be so traditional yet they were playing rock, rap and other Top 40 songs. Leaving the restaurant at night is rather scary as there is no lighting in the parking lot and the area felt very unsafe. No need to go to this very sketchy and rundown neighborhood again."}
{"text":"My husband and I came in to try the new place-he's a Vegas native and knew it way back when. Anyway, it's small (30 seats) and newly decorated (hipsterish) and we were the only ones here at 3pm on friday afternoon. We were greeted and seated warmly and quickly. I ordered the roasted beet salad and flautas with potatoes. Both were excellent and fairly priced. Hub got the skirt steak carne asada which was also good. My only complaint would be 1.the waiter was reticent to let me order the flowers with potatoes even though it's on the menu and had to go ask the chef if he would make it and 2. Seven dollars for a side of guacamole seems exorbitant. Overall it was a good experience and we will come here again."}
{"text":"The original place opened 60 years ago in this same building. I thought it was same owners but it was sold 1 1/2 years ago. Menu has changed and inside is very cool/ hip and cozy. Completely remodeled.  Menu selection is simple and not too much like many places.  We ordered Maui Maui, steak tacos, cheese enchiladas and guacamole. We were most impressed with the flavor of the steak tacos. The steak was amazing. Melted in your mouth. The staff was excellent. The only thing we wished was more seafood choices such as ceviche, or octopus."}
{"text":"I don't know how to review this place fairly.  Let's face it, I'm a gringo.  A lifetime of enjoying Tex-Mex cuisine has left me totally unqualified to judge \"authentic\" Mexican cooking.  Maybe that's the problem.  Or maybe the food just wasn't as good as the Yelp reviews had led me to expect.  But either way, El Sombrero is not going to become our \"go to\" place for Mexican food.  The restaurant was a little bit difficult to find.  A small building in a rundown neighborhood on the outskirts of downtown.  There was ample parking - a fact which was explained once we entered the restaurant, which was completely empty on a Thursday night.  Throughout our meal, there was never more than one other table occupied, out of the 15 or so tables in the small square room.  That may have been a blessing, because the acoustics in there were such that if the room was full it would be very loud.  I assume that the restaurant relies more on lunch business fueled by workers from nearby government buildings.  The guacamole and chips came quickly and were quite good.  The salsa seemed homemade, but was a little bit bland.  I asked for a blended Margarita, but the waiter told me they didn't serve blended because it wasn't \"authentic.\"  Okay, so I had an \"authentic\" Margarita on the rocks.  It was fine, but not (as advertised by our waiter) \"the best in town.\"  We started with the Quesillo Fondue Mexicano, which was pretty much what you would expect.  Eat it quick, because once the cheese hardens it isn't easy to scoop it into your tortilla.  (It would make a good paperweight though.)  I wanted to experience the \"authentic\" as much as possible, so I ordered the chicken enchilada in mole sauce.  Meh.  If that's how authentic mole sauce is supposed to taste, then I'm not sure it is worth the days of work and dozens of ingredients that (I hear) go into it.  The rice and beans were also not what I am used to getting in the typical Tex-Mex restaurant, and were also not my cup of tea.  However, my wife loved her salad and Mexican creamed corn.  So far as I could tell, the salad was mostly just iceberg lettuce with chunks of watermelon and a vinaigrette dressing, but she raved over it so I will try to reproduce it at home.  Hey, I can add feta cheese and pepitas to a salad too.  So, for all I know El Sombrero is just the place to sooth the soul of a homesick resident of Mexico City.  For me, though, I'll stick to the Tex-Mex stuff that I enjoy more."}
{"text":"Small and quaint.   One of the best meals I have ever had in Las Vegas.   Super cool owners and service was top notch."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! The food is so fresh and flavorful. From the appetizers to the main course everything was well done. The guacamole was delicious (if a little small portioned). I had the special, a seafood tamal which was out of this world. The wife had the brisket enchilada with a mole that totally made the dish. The dining room is small and intimate. The servers were super friendly and helpful. This is a little hidden gem in downtown! Most definitely a romantic vibe. Guys, take you're girl here and you will get lucky !"}
{"text":"We were searching for a good Mexican place to eat while in Vegas. If not for Yelp we probably would not have came across this place. Food was excellent! Service was awesome! Drinks were great! Will definitely go back when return to Vegas again!!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing. Best Mexican I have had in Vegas. The Mexican cream corn was incredible. Will definitely come back the next time I am in town. Also service Jose and his staff give you is top notch."}
{"text":"We were a party of nine and they accommodated us immediately. The margarita was so flavorful and possibly the best I've ever had. The food was delicious. The fish was seasoned perfectly. The guacamole was fresh and tasty. The brisket, pork chop, chicken were perfect. Would recommend anything on this menu. Definitely a must go."}
{"text":"We had a very bad experience here last week. We arrived and only one couple were here. Only one average size room but the decoration is well made with mirrors and nice lights. We ordered 2 margaritas and salsa and chips then 2 more couples arrived. No bar in the restaurant the cocktails were made in the back but took forever to come, without the chips and salsa. The waiter didn't told us it was happy hour but the lady(owner) told them it was happy hour on margaritas. Then the waiter brought them chips and salsa (and also to the other couple) and completely forgot about us. We asked for the tab and he charged us full price for the margaritas 10$ each. Will never come back there..."}
{"text":"Celebrating a birthday wanted authentic Mexican food and found this gem!!! Service a lil slow but worth the wait without question! Try the Sangria we had both Watermelon and Red it was terrific and refreshing. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Got here at 2:28 it took about 5mins for someone approach us, Doesn't have the full menu, plus no fountain drinks so no unlimited drinks :/, I did liked the chips and salsa, it took about 20 mins to get our food,  The food was pretty good but I felt like my meat was old, overall it was good but definitely not worth the  Cost."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in town, great service, very friendly! Definitely a must if you're ever in Las Vegas!!"}
{"text":"Loved the new look! Made me feel like I was in the big city. I definitely recommend the mole chicken enchiladas. Great service!"}
{"text":"Saw this place on the news recently and realized I've driven right by it many times without seeing so we had to give it a try.  Small intimate dining area, maybe seats 40 - 50 people. If you're looking for huge, greasy portions drowning in sauce this is not your place (nothing wrong with that style, this just isn't it). But if you like delicious, homemade, quality food with a nice presentation then I definitely recommend.  Service was great, attentive but not intrusive, recommended mole which was delicious! Wife had short ribs and said they were delicious and very well prepared. Sangria and margaritas were great as well.  All in all a great find and we'll definitely keep in our rotation of locally owned restaurants."}
{"text":"Definitely a hole in the wall, if you blink you can miss the spot!! I remember coming here years ago, the remodel is nice. Food was decent not my definition of authentic Mexican food maybe a little too fancy. Chile relleno was tasty, portions are kind of small, service was okay waitress never came back to give us water refills. Would consider going back maybe try some of the other dishes."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a couple of times before for events but finally got to sit down to a full mean today for lunch. Wow!! Great service and delicious food! I started off with the guacamole and had the pork with chile verde! I almost licked the plate it was so good!! I highly recommend this place, total hole in the wall but gorgeous inside and so worth it!!"}
{"text":"This is the best kept secret in Las Vegas... You wouldn't know it driving by but this place is so cool and the food is amazing and the guys are so nice you got to come check it out for yourself PS watch out for these margaritas they are incredible"}
{"text":"This is a quaint, hip, fun restaurant located close to the Smith Center and outlet mall. Their food is standard Mexican food and I thought it was done well. The margarita was top notch - not watered down like I've had at other Mexican restaurants. The service was personable and quick. Five stars!"}
{"text":"The chips and salsa were excellent. Got the Chile relleno. It was ok. Nothing special. The neighborhood's not great."}
{"text":"Wow!  This is awesome home made food.  The chicken soup was definitely fresh. I had the steak special which was very good and the flan was exceptional.  Jose was great and really made us feel at home. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is a little hidden gem in downtown Las Vegas.  Ample parking on the side of the building.  Service is simply top notch.  The owner is very friendly and offers some great menu suggestions based on your tastes.  We had the Brazilian Mahi-Mahi as well as the beef and shrimp fajitas.  Both were excellent!  The house made Sangria is some of the best we have had.  A great place for a nice lunch or romantic dinner.  You should try the El Sombrero!  Ask for Jose."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant, the food authentic Mexican.  A bit on the small side but overall the atmosphere was perfect.  Will make it a favorite hot spot.  Thank you Yelp friends for the recommendation."}
{"text":"Yum, yum, yum.  Stopped by chance today and was pleased to find the NEW El Sombrero had undergone a change of ownership and a facelift.  Menu is new as the focus is on an upscale Mexican, but don't let that stop you.  Started with a freshly made guacamole.  It had the right amount of heat with a little bit of chunkiness that went perfectly with the complimentary chips.  I had the Costillas en Salsa Verde (pork ribs with green sauce).  I am sucker for a good green chile.  The sauce was not too spicy and the rib meat fell off the bones.  Served perfectly with charro beans and rice.  My partner had Chicken Mole.  Wow!  I had a taste and know that is what I am ordering next time.  The mole was smoky with a delicate peanut flavor.  Irma told me they make their own mole by grinding peanuts and adding a delicious combination of spices.  Jose was our server who made us feel at home and made sure we were taken care of.  They just opened 2 days ago and are still getting in the swing, but this place is very promising.  They may need to do something to soundproof the room which got a little loud.  Maybe some rugs will help."}
{"text":"OMG, just go here. It's fabulous, make sure to make reservations way ahead."}
{"text":"Best meal I have has in Vegas!  ...And they were out of the items we really wanted to try!  I can't imagine how good they are!   The fresca Mexicana salad was out of this world.  Salsa and chips...Delicious.  Chile releno amazing!"}
{"text":"I wish we had a good experience, we had a terrible time. Super cute place, great menu but our waiter seriously ruined our experience. He was yelling at the other 3 people who were working, apparently he was \"training\" them but it was really uncomfortable to hear him treat the staff so rudely. Then when we mentioned we had a coupon from our kids fundraising book (entertainment book) he went off about how the that book was terrible to work with etc. & he refused the coupon with disgust. Ok...so we get our food & the nice waitress comes to check on us & we politely tell her the sauce was bomb (so good) however the chicken was really dry-so dry I thought it had slivers of bones. She took my plate away & out storms Juoquin, the mean guy-he asks what's the problem so we spoke already to the waitress then he goes off on me for complaining they are dry in the filing when I made the ridiculous request that they leave off the crema on top. I explained that really shouldn't effect the filling & he kept going talking about how good a cook he personally is...it was so awkward & rude. We told him we purposely spoke to the waitress quietly as to not cause a scene. The bill came & no discount or anything I guess he just wanted to discuss my dry chicken through clenched teeth & a fake smile."}
{"text":"So delicious! Food was great and atmosphere was so nice. Glad we came out and we loved Jose!"}
{"text":"I love this boutique style Mexican Bistro! This is a hidden jewel with great atmosphere! Great service, prices are good and the food delish! Something different than your typical Mexican Restaurant! They make the BEST Sangria I have EVER had and I LOVE their home- made Chips!  My husband and I have been twice and will be definitely going back with friends and Family next time! So many dishes to try! Give it a try you wont be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch and it was completely empty. It filled up as the lunch hour went on but the server was still attentive and nice. I had the Enchiladas de carne and it was good. The salsa that came with the fee chips was really good. I didn't try to guacamole but I saw somebody eating it and it looked great. There was a yelp deal that I used... purchase $15 and get $30 store credit. Each meal is about $15 so I recommend using it. If your going to go on a weekend make a reservation as max capacity is 43. All around good experience."}
{"text":"Love the design of this restaurant! Food was good, they did have menudo and even cheladas! Im fan!"}
{"text":"The first thing that got me upset was the portions,  Looks like they really save on you, we came group of four people and got a small plate of chips, than food came and it was third of the portion that usually you get In Mexican restaurant. The biggest shock is that they charge 20% tip without even letting you know. The taste is normal nothing special."}
{"text":"This is THE BEST Mexican bistro I have ever been to. I usually hate going out for Mexican food because I feel like I can make it better BUT EL SOMBRERO IS KING!!   Horrible what the city has done to them by letting an unfinished construction area deter people from going there and drive their business down. 2 years and nothing!! Yet project neon will be done before that. Horrible mayor Goodman!! They've been open for 60+ years and are part of downtown history!!!"}
{"text":"Best mole in town if you are ready to get of the strip and try some real authentic Mexican food this is the place. Cinco estrellas."}
{"text":"Expect to upsold when you don't ask for it!!!  Granted, we were a large party, but when we ordered a regular margarita they kept bringing a Cadillac Margarita. It was the first time we came here so we didn't know what a Cadillac Marg looks like at this place.   ONE person asked for guac and they brought 4 guacamoles for the table at $8 each.   My grandma said no meat on her salad and it came with Carne asada.  Also, our 3 street taco plate with rice and beans was $15 - smallest tacos I have ever had in my entire life. NOT WORTH IT!!!  We were all SSOO disappointed that this place tried to pull one over on us. I feel utterly violated! I will never be back or give them a single dime!"}
{"text":"With a name like \"El Sombrero\" my expectations was high With the \"off the Main Street\" location I was a little hesitant As I walked in the front door We were greeted with a warm smile and was given the choice of any table we prefer.  I fell in love with the bright painted accent wall, little string of lights, and a festive vibe.  Classic little spot with exceptional food and drinks sums it up Best: atmosphere and margaritas Dinner hour brings a steady crowd of dine in and take out Stop by and make some memories of your own, tell Renee and Joaquin I sent you"}
{"text":"I miss the old El Sombrero. This place isn't bad unless you mind that it looks like an IKEA exploded inside. But the decor isn't my main concern. I'm sad that the Mom and Pop feel to the menu is gone. It's a bistro fine I get it. The food is good but it's not the Mexican food that I was looking for on this particular day. The waiter was nice.  At least I know what to expect the next time. If you want good stick to your ribs, bad for you food head over to Casa Don Juan or one of the Lindos in town."}
{"text":"Amazing food that's made with lot's of soul and passion. Exceptionally friendly staff! If you want really Mexican food come here!"}
{"text":"We ate at El Sombrero yesterday before our flight back to PA. It is a tiny place and I suggest making reservations. Located close to the freemont/art district of Vegas. Everywhere we go on vacation we try to hit 2-3 Mexican restaurants and I had bought a travelzoo voucher a few months prior to our trip for this place. Jose was our server and was excellent, very friendly and funny. We had 4 adults and 2 children. Margaritas excellent as was the salsa, guacamole and entrees. Reasonably priced and decent sized meals. Chili relleno was delicious as were the enchiladas with mole sauce. Wife had the tamales and enjoyed them also. If we ever journey back to the area we will visit again. Thanks Jose and El Sombrero."}
{"text":"Great experience. I loved the ambiance, food, service,and the margaritas. I'm giving it 5 stars because it's had everything! And I love that it's downtown. I would highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Great place, definitely recommend it. The outside/surrounding area looks a bit sketchy, but the inside is very nice. The food and service was excellent, much better than I normally find in Vegas, and for very reasonable prices. First Vegas restaurant that I would really enjoy coming back to."}
{"text":"The food and the service at El Sombrero Rock!  Mom and I had the watermelon sangria (yum) and we  shared the two crispy beef tacos with two chicken enchiladas and the Chile Relleno with chicken. The crispy beef tacos were super tasty and the Relleno with chicken, butternut squash and all the other accompaniments was and way better than expected. I'm Not a huge fan of tomatillo, so the chicken enchiladas were not as mind blowing as the other food but they were still good. The beans were as good as grandmas but the rice was standard. I come from a Latin family and we cook lots of Mexican food, some of which I think we do better than many restaurants. I'm used to a different style of Mexican food, for \"Mexico City\" style food this was one of the best I've had.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"You guys definitely have to come here. It's such a hole in the wall place. The decor is so cute. The staff was incredibly sweet makes you feel like your at your aunts house. The food was so delicious full of flavor i love the watermelon salad."}
{"text":"Coming here for 27 years, I hadn't been since Irma took over.  I arrived before they opened for dinner, but she recognized us and had us brought in anyway.  Great when people in the business know the locals.  The all new decor is updated to stunning but not overdone - chic.  Kudos to the owners for keeping the original building and that classic neon sign.  Well done!    The food is an unusual fusion of central and south American, ultra fresh and beautifully presented. The drinks menu is also unusual and refreshing.  There is enough variety without going overboard.  The prices are good and the portions are sensible.    Head Server Jose is known to foodies downtown, and other familiar faces are on his team.  Chefs Oscar and Elias both visited the table to make sure everything was to our liking, and to describe our selections and other options.  We will certainly be back!"}
{"text":"This place is a gem, hands down!  The watermelon Sangria is amazing!  We had Halibut, Short Ribs, Del Patron and Camarones a la Diabla family style.  We couldn't decide what was the best entree!  In our indecision, we ate the most fabulous dessert, the bread pudding.  Chef Oscar, from Columbia, visited with us.  So down to earth and nice!  This is a must in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I am visiting from California and found restaurant on yelp and picked it due to the reviews and yelp deal. However,we arrived and their sewage smell was overwhelming. Very disappointing waitstaff attempted to sit us closest to smell! We tried to sit opposite side of restaurant before t the he small was so strong we could not overcome it. Staff said smell had been there awhile due to construction in area etc. smell is way too strong to eat here. No apologies nothing. I hope yelp does right thing and refunds my yelp deal monies"}
{"text":"Gets better every time..... A must visit in Las Vegas... Best kept secret in the arts district"}
{"text":"El Sombrero is an excellent Mexican Bistro in downtown Las Vegas. Truly some great food!"}
{"text":"Previously known as the oldest restaurant in town, El Sombrero can now lay claim to some of the best Mexican food in the valley thanks to new ownership and new chef -- Oscar Sanchez, formerly of Envy the Steakhouse.   Dining here on a Saturday afternoon, we were treated to an excellent array of dishes, starting with the well balanced quesillo fondue Mexicano ($12), with its blend of creamy cheeses, peppers providing hints of heat in a sauce with a touch of acidity. Following that was an excellent rendition of calamari -- the spicy calamari a la brasa ($13). Different from your typical restaurant version in that it wasn't breaded and fried, this charbroiled version delivered a subtle heat that lingered on the tongue.   El Sombrero has plenty of familiar dishes, like tacos, burritos, and tamales. But their food shows a passion and refinement that separates it from other spots. The depth in the roasted garlic tomatillo sauce in the tamal  de pollo ($14) elevates the dish and makes it anything but common.   The deft touch of the chefs is evident in their platters of meats. A filet, rib eye, and braised pork rib make up the Del Patron ($35). Both the filet and rib eye showcased a nice char and ample seasoning, while the pork unfortunately fell flat with its tough meat. A trio of sauces accompanied the platter but the beef hardly needed it. Side dishes proved to be as good as the proteins. The potatoes were excellent and the cream corn was a showstopper -- the type of dish that will leave a lasting impression.  The highlight of the meal, however, was the mole semana santa ($16). Braised, bone-in chicken was smothered in a mole sauce comprised of more spices than you'll ever pick out. It's a blend of heat and smoke with hints of bitterness and ever so subtle sweetness  that will awaken you palate.  Ending the meal was a dulce de leche bread pudding dense and moist from a rich custard that packed enough sweetness to end the meal on a sweet note.  This isn't the Mexican food found at lesser restaurants or chains. Dishes aren't over-sauced, they're perfectly seasoned, executed with the precision and passion that is superior to anything else of its kind in town."}
{"text":"El Sombrero is my new favorite Mexican restaurant. The menu is full of delicious surprises and can't wait to go back and try them all. Took a couple business lunch meetings there and they loved it too. Def coming back!"}
{"text":"I very rarely will Yelp a bad comment. Most of the time I tell myself to cool down and then I just forget about an awful experience and move on.    Today is very different because of my FIRST and absolutely LAST experience at this restaurant. In my 39 years of life, I have NEVER experienced the type of awful service like I did today.   I came here today with a couple of friends for lunch. As we walked in, the restaurant is very cute and cozy inside. Unfortunately their waiter (I believe his name is Jose but I have not confirmed this info as he refused to give us his name.) Right off the bat he was extremely rude. He made a comment that he remembered one of the individuals in my party only leaving him a 10% tip the last time he came for lunch. That right off the bat struck me wrong.   We went ahead and ordered our food which came out at a decent time. \"Jose\" never once came to refill my drink or even check on us. He came to us maybe once at the end to ask if we wanted flan which we declined. We soon received our checks and paid. As we were ready to leave, \"Jose\" sprinted to us to tell one of the members of our party (we had 3 people total in our party) that her tip was a disgrace and to never return back to their restaurant again.   I stepped in and told him his comment was absolutely unprofessional. He then THREW my tip at me and told us to never return(I left him a decent tip btw). I have NEVER seen such unprofessional behavior in my life. When we tried to call the restaurant to speak to the manager or owner, of course, Jose answered and told us he was the manager AND the owner. After some quick research we found that he is not the owner and a woman by the name of Irma Aguirre owns the restaurant.   Do yourself a favor. Save yourself a headache. DON'T COME HERE. You will get better service in a Taco Bell drive thru at 2am compared to this place!!  I would give this place negative stars if I could!!"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to write this review for quite some time, but our Vegas time got away from us and now that we are back to normal life on the East Coast, I am going to get this done because if you visit Vegas, you must go off the strip and have a meal at this restaurant.    Truth in lending, I served with one of the owners in the Army and when I found out he started a restaurant in Vegas, I expected nothing but the best because of how detail oriented he is.    The location is near old Las Vegas / Fremont street, so it will be easy for you to make this a part of your Vegas event schedule.    The restaurant itself is nicely decorated and the service was exceptional.  My wife and I had chips, salsa, and very good sangria to start.  We then shared chicken enchiladas which were very very good.    Mexican is hard to screw up, but its also hard to make it exceptional.  They have a great staff and the food is much better than the run of the mill Mexican restaurant.    Also, we engaged in a conversation with an older couple at the table next to us.  Interesting enough, they were from Summerlin which I guess is like 45-50 min from Vegas and they said this is the only Mexican restaurant they will go to and they will make the drive just to eat there.    Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Jose was the most amazing host/server. He was super friendly and polite. Explained the menu and was telling jokes. The food was great. My date and I both got the tacos (chicken and carne) and they were amazing. They came with a spicy salsa that had a nice kick to it. The sangria was amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Go here! We just got back and the food was amazing! I had the tamale with pollo and it was so authentically yummy! My husband had the pork tenderloin. The place was a small bistro that has a charming appeal from the rest of the strips bravado. Loved how unique and cool this place was. Bravo!"}
{"text":"You have to really want to do Mexican food right to impress me these days. Maybe that's unfair, maybe not, but there's far too many places to get good Mexican food at good prices for me to sit down and pay good money for anything less than extraordinary.  El Sombrero is visually appealing, and the quaint decor in this rather tiny place is a good setting for an excellent date night.  The use of real crema instead of sour cream has me excited as hell. Like getting fresh tuna after a lifetime of nothing but canned, the real thing is so much better than a cheap alternative. From this point forward, I will judge every Mexican meal I eat by their choice to use real crema or not.  Of course the real test of any Mexican meal, for me, will always be the Flan and El Sombrero's has won my heart.  The music was a little loud for my taste, which probably speaks more to my age then to the classiness of the restaurant, so I won't let it affect my rating.  Way to go El Sombrero - you're doing everything right."}
{"text":"This is an intimate Mexican restaurant with room for around 40, and it the decor is very modern but very clean.  Sangria is incredible and the margaritas were good as well.  Tasty guacamole and u had the street tacos which were delicious   Help support this local business to be successful.  You won't be dissapointed."}
{"text":"1st time here with a friend,  ordered guac n salsa for starters.  I ordered Chicken Asada Tacos (comes with 3 tacos n rice and beans), side of Mexican Cream Corn and a coke. 1st let me start with fresh home made corn tortillas. ..yummy! The tacos / seasoning just right.  My friend ordered the Carne Asada Tacos (comes with 3 tacos and rice and beans) and a coke..thumbs up. She asked for no onions (they came with onions....)  Overall service was good,  food great taste!  Prices a little high...  I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Decent Mexican restaurant located downtown. I've gone to this restaurant two or three times, the location is small or you could say \"cozy\" to make it sound more pleasant. Parking wasn't fun. I'm giving this restaurant 3 stars based on customer service, food I'll give 4 stars because the flavor on most dishes were strong. I like their chicken tortilla soup for lunch, definitely recommend that!  Back to customer service, I had a very pleasant waiter who actually was going above and beyond and created a sangria sampler for me when I couldn't decide which to try! All were pretty good by the way. Then a manager came to my table and made sure to tell me he (waiter) wasn't supposed to do that, and basically made me feel like I was scamming them. Long story short, I'll never go back because there's Mexican food everywhere here with better service. And I like to spend my money where it's appreciated. Perhaps your experience is better than mine, I hope so!"}
{"text":"This beautifully decorated restaurant is tucked away in downtown and has such a welcoming feeling for a quaint establishment. The decor is very modern with grays, whites and very nice lighting.  We ordered the guacamole, Bistro Burrito de Carne and Bistro Tamal de Pollo. The portions were very generous and the food was really good.  They did a great job on the presentation and the waitress did a good job at balancing all of her tables at lunch time.  Yelp even had a coupon I purchased and used on the spot!"}
{"text":"Amazing service, fabulous food! Fresh, fresh!  Don't be put off by the outside! Inside, it's beautiful, and the food is so, so good. A little pricey, but totally worth it. If you can, order the pitcher of Cadillac margaritas! OMG!"}
{"text":"This is a little gem in downtown Las Vegas! I absolutely love this place. The restaurant itself is small but very cozy and chic. Very clean on the inside and the food is AMAZING! I fell in love with their mole enchiladas, the plate came with rice and beans and they were delicious! I'm definitely going back for lunch :)"}
{"text":"We came here while waiting for our hotel room to be cleaned, for a beer, chips and salsa but ended up getting the taco/enchilada plate. Wow, the best tasting Mexican food I've had in a long long time. Strught up authentic, full of favor and spices that taste incredible. Do not pass this place by without stopping in and eating. You will not be sorry and you will be back.....we're coming back tomorrow for brunch."}
{"text":"Best authentic Mexican food in Las Vegas. Guacamole to die for. All the ingredients are fresh and are delivered daily. The drinks are also made fresh. The menu is small but it is packed with wonderful flavors. I had the chicken tamale which was a great portion. We also had the chicken mole which was amazing! Tasted better than my moms! FYI I am from Mexico. This cute little cozy place is the perfect spot to come visit when in Vegas! We loved it so much we came back twice in a week! Our waiter Jose was awesome and very funny gentlemen. So if you're looking for a low key local spot most definitely recommend this place! You won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"This place is one of the oldest in Vegas and new owners have spruced up the restaurant. I like that it has a parking lot. Service was top notch and very experienced. Food was great, but with caveats. For one, we were offered guacamole, but weren't told it was an $8 up charge. I ordered the watermelon salad with Salmon, which I was charged for after substituting for shrimp. Total bill for two people was around $50, which is pretty steep for day to day dining. Definitely a special occasion place. Watch out for up charges."}
{"text":"Generic and very greasy food.  Worst American imitation of Mexican food.  Not worth the price or the stomach cramps afterwards."}
{"text":"Great little hidden spot downtown! Interior was very modern and the food was beyond any mexican food in town.  I ordered a Margarita classic and it was freshly made and was one of those nasty pre mixed ones we've all had too many times. Cool date spot to take your significant other."}
{"text":"I intentionally went back to this restaurant for my 4th visit this year, today the 7th, for the FOOD and GREAT Service. I ordered my usual Pork Belly and the Burbon Barboca.  Everything is always fresh and homemade. I tend to eat at local, non-strip restaurants. I am a local and not a tourist. Thanks Yelp for policing attacks on businesses that have nothing to do with an organic personal consumer experience.  Oh yea, the Veggie plate is amazing!!!"}
{"text":"During a short visit to Vegas my tastebuds began hunting for legit Southwest Mexican Comida even before I left the airport. It took a few days, some luck and the trusty assistance of my Yelp App to locate El Sombrero, the oldest Mexican Restaurant in the City of Lost Wages.  The first round of salsa was tasty, but not at all picante, but a quick inquiry in Spanish brought the real deal- a spicy salsa made from chile de árbol.  As for cervesa, no hay mi preferida, but there are frosty bottles of my second fave, Negra Modela, brought promptly by Jose, my gregarious and good humoured camarero.  I ordered the rare delicacy that one must always get whenever one is lucky enough to find it on the menu: chicken enchilada mole- with the spicy chocolate sauce. It was- spectacularly delicious, and well presented. The mole sauce was amongst the best I have ever tasted, anywhere. Period.  Although a bit more upscale than what I usually target in my relentless hunt for the world's best Mexican Food, it does not disappoint. Usually upscale ambience means downscale food, but not here."}
{"text":"Piña a la Diabla.  Una deliciosa fusión de piña, camarones e ingredientes cuidadosamente seleccionados componen esta deliciosa e inmejorable especialidad del Chef Elias. Una exquisita sugerencia de Carlos, quien nos atendió espectacularmente bien, al punto de hacernos sentir las personas más importantes del lugar.  Por más lleno que estés no te puedes ir sin probar los postres, son una pintoresca obra de arte que acaricia tus sentidos de inicio a fin, elaborados  con detalle exquisito.  Muchas gracias."}
{"text":"Service is top notch, the veggie tacos were excellent. Have been there several times in the past couple of months. The vibe in the place is very cool. I have been going to El Sombrero for over 20 years and the renovation is fabulous. My mother had the camarones a la diabla sarandeados and loved it. I will recommend El Sombrero to anyone who wants a cozy cool joint or a night out for an intimate date night."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this cute little restaurant. Great food, friendly staff. We had the steak special, which was tender and full of flavor, as well as the chicken mole, also outstanding and authentic. The salsa and guacamole were both made with fresh ingredients and the flavors really popped.   The only downfall is that the hours as reported on yelp are incorrect, which has burned us a few times now. Be sure to call in advance and don't rely on yelp for hours of operation."}
{"text":"Fish Tacos and Molé are a must try. The chips and salsa are so freak'n addicting. Love the boutique style with the intimate setting. A little pricy, but worth it."}
{"text":"I'm very happy that this little place has reincarnated itself from what it once was (I never visited the \"old\" El Sombrero, but hardly anyone did). With this place still settling in, I think it will be quite an amazing finished product. The food is already fantastic, and you can definitely taste the care behind the preparation which is always such a pleasure.   Came here close to closing around 3:20 in the afternoon, and we were the only one there and were told we had just missed the lunch rush. No one in the place doesn't worry me, walking in it had already seemed so charming and smelled great.   There isn't a bar yet, but we were informed that by the end of April 2015 they will have expanded and by adding a bar and patio.   The waiter was extremely friendly and very attentive! (As it should have been since we were the only two there)   Ordered:    Chicken Taquitos $9 flavor profile 3.5/5   This is an appetizer, but ordered as main meal. This was plenty for a lunch dish, and very tasty. The avocado cream was a great touch.   Tacos $12 flavor profile 4/5  This was nice because you could choose any 3 tacos you'd like from the options and it was one fixed price. I order 1 fish and 3 shrimp. Both served grilled and you prepared the taco yourself. Presentation was nicely done with all of the toppings on the side. I don't like runny fish or shrimp tacos, so this was perfect for me. You could also order the whole taco deep fried, but I did not choose this option.   Beers $5 corona light and modelo   I can't wait to come back. It's even better that it's 2 blocks away from my apartment."}
{"text":"My son and I work I'm the area and we have been waiting for this place to open so when we saw the now open sign we went!! We were not disappointed service is on point Christian was our server and he went above and beyond to make us feel welcome!   food is good not what I expected not authentic but defenetly good, the taquiza (mix seafood and meat) was great flavorful and enough for two, sangria was refreshing and bean dip was flavorful! We will try it again and again!"}
{"text":"This place has some really good food.  Service was a bit lacking. Over all excellent experience."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this little gem! So cute inside...Our server Jose made the visit so enjoyable. Food was gooooood! Loved the chips sprinkled with chili and the guac was fabulous. We had the El Patron for two. Filet and ribeye grilled and served with fresh tortillas and 3 amazing sauces..and the most amazing potatoes. We will definately be back. Soon."}
{"text":"This was featured on a show about the history of Las Vegas and the show presented it as the oldest Mexican restaurant in Nevada. We went there on a Tuesday night. Besides us there was only one table for quite some time. The other table had about 10 people and we were 3.  The food tasted okay; it wasn't amazing, but it wasn't horrible. The service on the other hand was not okay. She was not very helpful with the menu and no options for palates that cannot \"do\" spice. Chips have spice on them and there is not a mild salsa, just house salsa. We had to flag her down for water and chips and we felt like we were an inconvenience. The waitress was nice, never rude, but definitely not attentive.  Being off the strip I would have expected the prices to be a little cheaper but they weren't bad. Overall it was an okay place to eat but not somewhere I'd make sure and return to."}
{"text":"Wonderful food! the Nachos with Bourbon Baracoa was delicious, sweet with a hint of cinnamon. Great ambiance. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Delicious food!   My husband and I ended up here by accident. The area is going through construction (not the restaurant) but it's not too bad to get here. A true hidden gem.   Our server, Jose, was very attentive and nice.   I had the chicken asada tacos, very yummy with a little kick of spice. Hubby had the sandia citrus salad and loved it.   Will definitely visit again if we're in the area."}
{"text":"Fantastico! The food is fresh and flavorful. The service is excellent and the atmosphere is intimate. We truly enjoyed our experience here and will be back."}
{"text":"Great good and service! The chips and salsa were some of the best I've ever had! The margarita was great too! Super cute restaurant and our server was amazing! Definitely the beast place we ate in Vegas"}
{"text":"The food is delicious. I suggest anything with the Bourbon Barbacoa. The service is great in a cozy dinning room."}
{"text":"The BEST Mexican restaurant in all of Vegas. We take everyone that travels to Vegas here. The food is amazing, and authentic. The menu is outstanding, and you cannot beat the service. It is romantic, unique and eclectic. Jose is our waiter and he makes the best margaritas. A hidden gem."}
{"text":"El Sombrero has been a fixture of DTLV for over 40 years.  Closed briefly in 2014, it reopened with new owners and with a revamp of the interior.  It is no longer a tiny, old space but instead has been made into a very pleasant, roomier restaurant.  Still, it has about 15 tables so it's not a giant place.  Prior to a show not too far away, I came here for dinner having read the reviews on Yelp.  I was the only person in the restaurant which factors into the amount of stars I've given El Sombrero.    I ordered the soup of the day which was chicken tortilla soup.  For a main course, I ordered the tamal de carne, stuffed with braised marinated brisket in a homemade tamal steamed in a banana leaf.  In addition, I ordered a side of their Mexican cream corn.  Later, for dessert I got the Mexican bread pudding.  I was brought the soup and it was excellent!  However, this is where the loss of a star comes into play.  I had the soup for about 4 minutes when two servers appeared with the tamal, the cream corn, and the rice and beans.  Since I was the only person in the restaurant, there was no hurry to get dishes out and the servers should have known this.   I hurried to finish my soup so I could get to the tamal before it cooled.  The Mexican cream corn was a take on Mexican street corn but after grilling, the corn is cut off the cob, mixed with crema, and topped with cheese.  It was good but with the rice and beans, I wouldn't order it again.  The seasoning of the different parts of the meal was good.    While the food is good, service needs to be timed a whole lot better."}
{"text":"Never went before they renovated but loved the atmosphere and food. Their chips and guacamole are amazing."}
{"text":"Very nice! Enjoyed it very much. Ambiance was great, service was friendly and attentive. Food was very good as well. Had street tacos and enchiladas, and both were very good. The guacamole was fresh and chips were seasoned lightly enough to eat not just one!"}
{"text":"Cool little Mexican bistro....upscale, great food and service! Came for lunch and would come back for dinner."}
{"text":"Just had lunch here today with some work friends. Great service, great food, love the ambience - and they sent over a sangria sampler!! So clutch. I ordered dinner items that weren't on the lunch menu, and they happily accomodated. The 50% off Yelp deal tops it off. Definitely coming here again."}
{"text":"If you're looking to get away from the Strip for some great food in a relaxed atmosphere, you won't be disappointed. Small, intimate interior, attentive service, fresh food and great sangria. Yes, it is located in a sketchy area of town, so take a cab - and ask Jose to call one for you when you're ready to leave. We ordered the seafood paella, and it was awesome. Happy we took the time to check this place out!"}
{"text":"Didn't really get the chance to try anything because we had to leave.  We started out with margaritas , queso , and guacamole. Those were pretty good. But once we were served we noticed a hair in the tacos we ordered. We sent it back for a new one and once our salad came out it had two additional hairs in it .   Accidents happen and it would have been okay if it was only the one plate but having another plate come out with the same issue was a HUGE NO for us. We didn't feel like risking having another hair in the rest of our food so unfortunately we had to leave.   Overall: decor was warm , inviting and cute . Our server was very nice and apologetic. Dip and drinks were great. It's just unfortunate to walk in being starving and then having to leave feeling sick and with all of our appetites gone."}
{"text":"Had brunch here a few days ago. It was a very nice spot. The place is small but not cramped. Kind of intimate seating. The sunlight came in and really lit up the place without making it too bright. It's hard to explain but it was very nicely lit. They also had very interesting lighting fixtures. Really helped to pull the place together.   They had a DJ playing some latin music. It wasn't too loud, just enough to have nice ambiance. Really liked it, it reminded me of my parent's house or something. They also had some interesting drinks, like watermelon mimosas. I was recovering from a hangover so alcohol was the last thing I actually wanted. It was still nice to see a variation on the normal mimosa.   The brunch menu had some classic Mexican dishes like Huevos Rancheros and such. They also have pork belly eggs benedict, which of course sounded delicious. Ordered that and the Filet Mignon stir-fry.   The presentation was gorgeous, although maybe the plates were a little too big. The food. The food was good. My filet mignon stir fry's egg needed salt for sure. Nothing was really missing, just needed a little something. I can't put my finger on it. Now with the atmosphere and the prices, you would expect the food to be just a little something more. It wasn't bad at all, it was good. Just had that moment of, does the food justify the price?  But that's not what it's all about. The service was excellent. Our waiters were always there. Helping with waters and any orders. They refilled our waters often and made sure our chip basket never got empty. The food did take a minute to come out, but we didn't even notice. We were focused more on the attentive service. Even the owner came by and checked on us and asked us how we enjoyed the meal.   It was so refreshing to have excellent service. You may think that the prices are a little higher than normal for the food, but with the service you are getting, I think they did a fine job justifying it.   This place may not be for everyone. Myself, I don't mind the dimly lit Mexican hole in the wall restaurants whose version of presentation is how to fit all of a chimichanga into a foam container. This place, though, was very clean, nicely lit, and the food was well made. I'd definitely check this place out."}
{"text":"My wife ordered the Tinga Tacos and they were so good because of the handmade tortillas. Salsa and chips were amazing too! Margarita was incredible ! And our waiter Jose was awesome ! I ordered a wet burrito and the sauce was really good !"}
{"text":"What an awesome find! Authentic, delicious Mexican food! Great service! Retro, Downtown experience.   Update: 06/30/18 We ate here again last night and although the food was awesome as always, our server Jose kicked us out at 9:30 saying they closed at 9:00. Plus I saw him turn someone away at 9:00 when they actually close at 10:00. But clearly there are hours discrepancies online (see attached photos), but they all say 10:00. He complained about business being slow while Downtown was under construction and he didn't know how they were going to be able to keep this place open. Well turning people away and kicking them out because you want to go home isn't going to help! Plus he forgot our rice, beans and soup. Not cool."}
{"text":"Jose is the best. What an amazing waiter and great experience. The chips and salsa is all homemade. Killer quality and really intimate experience. Love this place. A little off the path, but worth it. Plus they have a parking lot!"}
{"text":"We stopped here before the art walk  This is such a wonderful unexpected find. Cute and fun decor. Amazing service. The best Mexican food  I highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"This is one of those great little finds off the beaten path. The inside is fun and quirky. The wait staff is knowledgeable and friendly. The menu has Spanish and South American dishes as well as Mexican. The food was well presented and delicious. We had the hanger steak, chicken enchilada, the special with steak, chicken and chorizo. For dessert, chocolate tres leches and bread pudding. We didn't have a bad dish. I can't wait to get back and try some of the other options."}
{"text":"I came here this past Saturday with a group of friends for dinner, the restaurant itself is very small so look out for the bright blue restaurant front or you might miss it.  The restaurant only has a few tables, but is decorated very tastefully with trendy string lights and cool looking chandeliers.  The service was fast and friendly; we even received a complimentary dessert when the server found out my birthday was the week prior.  However, beware because our server was the master of upselling.  He made convincing arguments to try to get us to buy the extra side of guacamole, to order the entire pitcher of sangria vs. a single cocktail, and to buy more appetizers.  We resisted the urge to spend more money so just beware.  Overall my feelings on this place were meh.  Food was fair, but like I always say Las Vegas has so many other spectacular restaurants in town to try and dine at.  I don't see myself coming here again.     As for the food/drinks we ordered: -Sangria ($8) - refreshing, but they put a lot of cinnamon in the drink to the point where it was overpowering -Traditional Margarita (about $9) - just your standard margarita, nothing amazing, nothing terrible -Watermelon Margarita (about $9) - best drink of the night, with decent sized watermelon chunks you can eat too -Stuffed Bacon Wrapped Jalapenos ($12) - probably my favorite part!  It is covered in a bourbon sauce though so if you don't like bourbon you might not like this -Enchiladas De Mole ($16) - mole was a little bland and the chicken was a little dry -Tamal De Pollo ($14) - my friend had this and he said he enjoyed it -Street Tacos ($15 for 3 tacos) - my other friends got the tacos and they said the stand out was the Carne Asada tacos, but said the tacos were on the smaller side"}
{"text":"So glad we decided to try somewhere new for date lunch with my hubby. Located in what looks like they are working on gentrifying this block, El Sombrero is brightly colored in happy purple and teal colors. Tall spiral bushes flank both sides of the front door, and upon entering you are greeted with a chic and posh interior, wood tile floors and both facing walls lined with mirrors with hand written phrases in Spanish. Black and white walls, black flora chandeliers hang from the ceiling throughout. Very cute.  Jose greeted us and after being seated at our table introduced himself and offered different sangria options. We opted to share a La Victoria Beer, but did take him up on his recommendation of guacamole. They brought out free chips and salsa, which the salsa was fantastic. Then the guac came, creamy with tinges of lime and onion was perfecto. We ordered the chicken tacos, succulently marinated with a mildly charred taste, fresh salsa de arbol, fresh house made pico and lime wedges. Beautifully presented on a wooden board and small white bowls, it's contemporary presentation was appreciated. We were both impressed.  Jose was super friendly and we spoke briefly about our experiences with living in Mexico City, noting we'd lived in neighboring areas, knew of common parks, streets and restaurants. Small world.  Side of guac, a beer and 2 taco plates minus tip was $42-ish.  We'll definitely be back to El Sombrero!"}
{"text":"Honestly, great food. Made reservations for our big party a few days in advance, and called ahead because we had three birthday cakes we needed to store while we dined. First they wanted to charge a 100 deposit in advance, because of the possibility of no show?! Then when we were going to cut the cake they wanted to charge us a \"cake fee\" per person of $3...but since he was just letting us know then he said he could cut that fee in half??!!  This being the first time hearing about the fee, we obviously were thrown aback. We spent over 400 and you want to nickel and dime people to slice some cake. If we were just loitering and not consuming understandable. But this wasn't the case. Our host was upset once I spoke to the owner about the miscommunication, and then refused to cut the cake once she agreed to no fee. Regardless cake was cut and served. Good food, but I wouldn't come back with a big party which is a loss for them."}
{"text":"Food is alright. Not worth the outrageous prices ($10.00 for a plain bean burrito - just beans and tortilla). Service was an absolute nightmare. Sat down promptly at 6 for our reservation, didn't take our order until 6:45. The waitress was beyond rude. She didn't fulfill any of the requests for drinks, chips or the food order without multiple requests (still issuing parts of the order). I will give them the fact that it's Cinco de Mayo... but they were only accepting reservations. We were the 2nd biggest party in there with another maybe 10 tables. Properly staff by the number of tables you know will be sat. We were a table of 6 and they tacked on a 20% gratuity. Took another 30 minutes to get out check after they cleared the table and confirmed that we were done for the night. Don't go here if you think they will be busy. Not worth the aggravation."}
{"text":"Please suport this establishment its being given unfair reviews because she supported Trump. Its her right to support who ever she likes and not be harrsssed for it. Lets help her out and show support for her business and her rights for her politiical choices. Thank you."}
{"text":"We didnt have reservations last night for our party of 3.  Jose asked as we arrived then said it's ok I'll seat you ,as he proceeded to tell us there was a party of 8 coming so we'd only have around and 1hour and 15 minutes for our dinner. For a party of 8??? Ok. I thought is was awkward to be told that, and a bit rude! My husband chose this for a surprise date night for myself and our teenager, so I made the best of it . The ambiance was way  pretty though. Small menu selection, but at least it's easy to choose, great flavors. I ordered a Cadillac Margarita, Jose advised me to order that because there was only enough for one so he would sell out. I thought that was a little odd to be told that ,So basically sit down, order and eat quickly and only one drink ! Pay and leave! I didn't feel  welcome here at all.  Jose seemed like a kind man maybe under pressure from over booking or something ,who knows?  First impression not a very good one though .  I'll stick with Lindo Michaocan they always make my family and myself feel overly welcome wether it's just the 2 of us or the 3. Plus better  Margaritas they are scrumcious at Lindo it's right down the street from here anyway."}
{"text":"The chicken enchiladas with the tomatillo sauce..best enchiladas I've ever had! The place is small, but really nice inside. Definitely a must try downtown."}
{"text":"Great foodie find! Manager stayed open to accommodate our party. Great guacamole, tasty enchiladas and flavorful fajitas. Go support this local business. The food and service are worth navigating through the road construction."}
{"text":"Tried out this place for a Sunday brunch. Instantly loved the atmosphere and the decor, especially with how sunny it is. It is a very small place and they had a DJ playing some salsa music. The small space did not seem to warrant an entire DJ set-up in the corner but it added some charm.  I ordered the pork belly eggs Benedict. I enjoyed them well enough but I was distracted by the presentation. My plate was huge, like it must have been at least 12 inches by 12 inches. Then smack dab in the center are the two muffin halves. There are no side dishes or other accouterments on the dish, so it only takes up maybe about 1/6 of the plate. I am a firm believer in quality over quantity, but it just seemed so bizarre to have a fairly small item to be on a plate the size of Texas. In a way, it almost made me feel like I was ripped off...like something else was being left off of the plate or that my dish is not worth the value. This was all due to the presentation because it was plenty of food for me. It also made it awkward trying to fit my coffee cup and water glass on the table top as I started running out of room.   I did not indulge in any alcoholic beverages because I was nursing a hangover but their coffee was delicious. I was also able to sample their bread pudding. That was seriously my favorite of the morning and I am not even a dessert person whatsoever."}
{"text":"This was our first time at this place.  We were looking for a restaurant within walking distance of our hotel, so we decided to give El Sombrero a try.  When we arrived, there was one other couple there, and my first thought was, \"no one is here, it must not be very good.\" The other couple told us not to leave, that the food was really good, and were they right! Our server, Renee, brought chips, salsa, and refried beans. The chips were seasoned with something I couldn't identify, but they were really good, and the refried beans were the best I've ever had. My date had a blue margarita, I'm not sure what was in it, but he enjoyed it.  I ordered cheese enchiladas with rice and beans, and it was delicious, I ate every bite! Normally, I take half of my food home, but it was just too good to stop eating. My date had 3 street tacos, 1 carne asada, 2 chicken, and he was very pleased with his food too.   There is ongoing construction in the area, and the restaurant is on the small side, but we really liked the ambience and the cute decorations, and will definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Tried to eat here last Saturday. No go. Completely booked. Here in Monday -  by the way, an excellent time to come - and everything is terrific.   One of the best things about non-corporate, owner- or chef-driven restaurants is that they can (and do, if they're good) adjust as necessary.  The chicken tanal (which I've had before and lived) was even better, with a better presentation. The pork ribs were flavorful, tender and accompanied by a delicious tomatillo sauce.   The table salsa, delicious every time, was even better, perfect blended and seasoned; the fondue ap warm and tasty. The flan for dessert, super.   An excellent dinner and excellent evening."}
{"text":"Came after Veterans Day Parade today after meeting the owners wife at International  Foods Market the day before....5 stars! Don't let facade and location deter you..."}
{"text":"Food was great, but the girl who took the order and rang it up was rude and acted if she didn't want to be bothered.  She kept yelling back and forth to another girl outside (still in her pajamas no less!) who turned out to be her sister."}
{"text":"Service was great. The server was tentative and knowledgeable.  Loved the atmosphere and interior deco.   We had the blackink squid as appetizer, its soooo good!! Warm, tender, and full of flavors.  We then had the plate that serves 2 ppl with Carni Asada, Polo, and Chorizo. Came with rice and beans, Mexican corn chowder, and 3 kinds of sauces.   For dessert, we had the chocolate cake! Warm with strawberries!   Everything was soooo goood! Great for date! Price is very reasonable for what you get!"}
{"text":"We arrived and it took a while to be seated.  Then took a while to get a menu.   We ordered a guacamole for our chips.   It came out almost half way after we had our entries and only because I mentioned it again to the waiter.   My friend wanted an \"agua fresca\" which they stated they were out of.    Note: big advertising outside restaurant saying \"aguas frescas\".  My other friend ordered the mango salad which 10 minutes later she was told no mango.   They were also out of asada for asada tacos.   The chicken mole was great but it was piled on the plate like dog food.  I think adding rice and a little touch would improve the look.  Overall the food was excellent.   However when considering the ambiance, the location, and the slight sewer smell, I will have to lower my rating to 3 stars.    Food deserves at least a 4.   But again, the overall restaurant experience is important."}
{"text":"Wow!  Not only is the food incredible, the service is amazing.  The entrees are unbelievably creative and this place is every foodie's dream.  Went here for Sunday brunch and let the owner advise us on what to order. What a treat!!  The atmosphere is cozy, modern, fun and a great way to spend a Sunday morning/afternoon.  I was also really impressed with the selection of Mimosas; they had unique flavors such as prickly pear and sangria and a sangria sampler!  The food was fresh, the presentation was beautiful and there was a DJ spinning Latin Beats.  After breakfast, we ended our meal with a tres leches French toast dish.  Yum!  Highly recommend the guac and pork belly English muffin dish.  Come one! Come all!  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Got the fajitas, creamed corn,and margaritias, amazing taste and good decor!!!"}
{"text":"This is by far some of the best Mexican food I have ever had! It is a really small place, but very nice. Atmosphere is great.  A bit tricky getting here, and parking. There is so much construction on Main Street and it was First Friday downtown......  Absolutely worth it!!!!  Started with the Guacamole and the Quesillo Fondue Mexicano. OMG that was the best queso, absolutely worth the $12!!! Then for the entree, the BEST TAMALE ever!!!!  I had the Tamal De Pollo and my husband had the Tamal De Carne. I really don't know which one was better. I suggest getting both! They also have some of the best beans around, the side of rice and beans was so flavorful. I don't know how many times I said the word \"best\" in this review, but it was seriously the \"best\"."}
{"text":"The food was excellent and I enjoyed the atmosphere. There was a drunk guy being loud and obnoxious but thankfully he left halfway through my meal. I really liked the mole and the chicken fajitas were excellent."}
{"text":"Last night my boyfriend and I celebrated his birthday at El Sombrero. He has dined there several times, however this was my first.  The service and staff were incredible from the moment we arrived until when we left. They made us feel important and wanted in their establishment and that is always a nice feeling when you are out to eat.  The food was AWESOME! I'm sort of a snob when it comes to table salsa in Vegas and I like a spice to it so I was pleasantly surprised when we got that. The guacamole was also impeccable with a ton of flavor.  I ordered the taquiza carne which comes with 3 kinds of meat and it was phenomenal. All ingredients were tasty and fresh. My boyfriend ordered the special which he claimed was awesome as well.  I drank the watermelon sangria (The Blushing Señorita) and that was all that I had hoped it would be!  Dinner at this quaint, lovely restaurant was an incredible experience and I can't wait to go back.  Special shoutout to Carlos our server who helped in making our night!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly had this place to ourselves for most of our dinner on a week night. The food and service was absolutely fantastic!!! We got one of the steak platters (don't remember the name) and I believe it came with filet mignon and ribeye in addition to fabulous tasting corn, beans and rice. The sangria was also fantastic. The waiters and chef could not have been more nice and accommodating. If you want top-notch Mexican cuisine, GO here. Very nice atmosphere as well. A little tricky to find. Look for a sky blue sign."}
{"text":"My husband and I haven't been here in over 20 years but wanted to come down for a \"wet burrito\" that used to be on the menu.  They've remodeled the place to be a cute boutique style Mexican restaurant.  We were told that the chef used to work at a major casino.  We were pleasantly surprised to see the remodel and change of menu.  The Hanger Steak was AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Reasonable prices. Huge portions. The sangria is delicious, and the chips and dip are solid. Had a chicken tamale, and it was massive. Seemed bigger than a typical tamale, and it appeared to be served enchilada style. Delicious. Great service, hip aesthetic, and it has a very intimate feel."}
{"text":"This service here is amazing along with food Menu choices everything was amazing not your Regular Mexican food . This was made with love Not heavy or fat.:) lol . You must try this place  Everything's was Tasty and with full of Spicy flavor. Will be back with friends and family.:)"}
{"text":"This little place is tucked into an unassuming location that blossoms when you walk in. The staff is super fun and friendly! The menu is more on the gourmet side and everything was served up freshly made! (Even the tortillas!) My shrimp tacos were incredibly delicious!"}
{"text":"If you're around downtown, you must try out this spot for fine Mexican cuisine!   On the outside- it looks like any other Mexican eatery and the signage is deceiving, looks a bit rundown but inside is what really matters.. Stepping inside you're greeted by kind servers who assist you right away with getting settled in. The posh ambience catches you a bit off guard as it juxtaposes sharply with its distressed exterior. The restaurant itself has a relatively small dining space but is exquisitely decorated.   My party & I reserved a table ahead of time (about 30-45 minutes ahead), as we had planned last minute to go there for dinner. Fortunately, there really wasn't any need to book a reservation- when we had arrived there was only one other party there.. Nonetheless, they were able to reserve our table. So that was nice.. It certainly got busier throughout the night so I would recommend making a reservation - especially if you've got a party of more than 2.   We were tended to right away so we ordered drinks and some appetizers! I ordered some sangria and I must say it was really good, I'm glad I got it- it was very fresh.   The main dishes did not take long to come out to our table. I ordered the burrito and it was huge! Definitely filling. Everything was to my liking and I had nothing to complain about- especially with the 15$ for 30$ deal (you pay 15$ and get 30$ to spend).  I would come back again and explore more of the other menu items- all of them looked very appealing.  Service was great and they were very attentive to our needs. Overall, a grand dining experience in downtown LV at a decent price !"}
{"text":"On entering this small restaurant we were directed to a small table and provided menus along with house made chips and fresh salsa.  We started off with glasses of a delicious red sangria with a pronounced flavor of cinnamon and fresh fruit that had must have been marinating for some time - excellent.  This was followed by a shared sandia citron salad (watermelon, caramelized pepitas, mixed greens and teardrop tomatoes with a citrus dressing) that proved to be refreshing.  My wife chose pollo enchiladas for an entree - braised seasoned pulled chicken with a roasted garlic, creamy tomatillo sauce accompanied by Mexican rice and frioles. I went vegetarian with the bistro chile relleno - a small roasted poblano pepper filled with butternut squash, onion, and potato that shared the plate with charro beans and Mexican rice. Both dishes proved to be very good"}
{"text":"Came here for a quick lunch/cinco de mayo/ anniversary lunch today. Today the menu was a little different , they had HAPPY HOUR, ALL DAY!  Regardless, the menu was awesome ! Had a few tacos , Mexican corn, guac, and a few drinks . Prices are reasonable .. I will be coming back when the menu is normal .   Their tacos were delicious !!! I love their pork belly taco the most ! Waitress was nice , helped on picking the type of beer for a good michelada  highly recommend this place !!!   It's a little hole in the wall.. But easy to find . Best Mexican food I've had in a while !"}
{"text":"So impressed with the fresh central Mexico flavor profiles. No over sauced heavy on the cheese to compensate for lack of authenticity here. I had the street tacos, they came on handmade hard to eat but utterly delicious tortillas. I don't think you could choose wrong at this place and will definitely be back to sample more of this great menu."}
{"text":"I really wish I could of gave this place 5 stars for there food, but I didn't get a chance to try it, the service was so horrible that we had to walk out, we where seated right away, but soon after that they completely forgot about us, took 10min for someone to acknowledge us, another family walked in after us and were given menus right away, meanwhile we are waiting for our menus, instead 5 min later they bright us chips, but still no menus we had to ask for them, 10min later they came and asked us what we wanted to drink, but we haven't received a drink menu either, the family next to us looked like they been sitting there for a while and still haven't ordered as well and looked frustrated as well, after 25min we decided to walk out."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Amazing Service. Jose and Renee are very personable and make your dining experience enjoyable. The chicken and rice soup is to die for."}
{"text":"Do not go here. Bad area of town and the food is way overpriced. They also serve their margaritas in water glasses? The barbacoa was delicious but not for $18.00. Better places in town and cheaper (like tacos el gordo). I've been in here twice once I had a female server she was nice. The male server is not. Besides him taking 13 minutes to bring out our drinks (with only 1 other table seated do not busy at all) that is completely unacceptable. When I asked why my margarita was served in a water glass his response was oh we changed the glasses... lol okay. The other table seated had an issue with one of their plates and ended up getting into with the server (very unprofessional btw) and his EXACT words were \"I don't care if you write a bad review I'm friends with the owner and she'll have it removed anyways\".  Hmm okay we'll that might be true but now you've lost 2 customers. Word of mouth is way bigger than yelp anyways.  GO TO CASA DON JUAN instead better food, prices and service! OH AND they serve their margaritas in the right glasses!"}
{"text":"Ate there a few weeks ago... A little slow in my review. First- it's really cute. 2- Carlos was our server and he was awesome, I appreciate great service and I was not disappointed. Importantly- best salsa ever!   The food is really good, I was really impressed. I had the taco and enchilada plate. I ate everything on my plate along with more chips and salsa than I probably should have... It's just that good.   My new favorite Mexican restaurant!!!"}
{"text":"Very nice and simple restaurant.  Taken by a surprised as the outside doesn't really capture your attention... As you walk inside, one is definitely amazed by the decor.  The food is excellent and their drinks are excellent as well."}
{"text":"Once again AMAZING. They are always attentive and the quality is unrivaled. Street tacos, fresh soup, enchiladas, it has all been made with love and care."}
{"text":"Absolutely the most amazing street tacos I have ever had!  On a scale of 1-10 this place is a solid 15!  BTW try the Estella beer."}
{"text":"Read all the glowing reviews of this place so we thought we'd give it a try. Not in the greatest of neighborhoods, but still felt safe here. It's a small little restaurant, but the food was really good! Truly authentic Mexican food with lots of flavor. Definitely worth trying this place!"}
{"text":"if people think this is a 4.5 establishment they were either drugged or they are from another planet. I like to think of myself as a Mexican food connoisseur. First thing is as im sitting here i feel sick to my stomach and slept in all afternoon because the food made me feel awful. OK so first up,the waitress there was nice but she was the only one there,when i first walked in the door there was not one employee in sight. I sat down and there was this obnoxious customer trying to engage me in multiple conversations i was polite but,dude when someone is looking down at their phone or looking at a menu and they are giving you short answers or ignoring you all together its probably time to piss off,he made me so uncomfortable i almost left. Next up the food..ok so naturally food that makes you sick is no bueno..but the other issue is the price..i didnt make the waitress suffer by not tipping her but this food is way over priced and over hyped ive had better food off a truck in Baja,with no tip and 10 times the food. My bill for a burrito and a coke was 19 +4 for the tip. there are places around town you could pay a third and have a superior experience all around. The sign outside the restaurant says \"MEXICAN BISTRO\" translation...get ready to eat some sup par food for an exorbitant amount of money. The last thing that was really annoying is they had no tooth picks this only added to the unpleasantness of the whole experience. Here's a tip for management if you think its fair to charge these prices then spend some money on some courtesy's like tooth picks. also,the bathroom is nicely done but seriously there should be a sign outside like the ones at the roller coasters stating \"people larger then THIS,should use the alley outside\"..the bathroom is fine if you're a midget."}
{"text":"I've been a fan of El Sombrero for many years. It has been a long-time staple lunch experience. You would walk into this very small house/building, sit at rustic tables, be waited on by friendly servers, and have a fantastic, authentic meal. The place was loud, because it was ALWAYS packed at lunch, the food service a bit slow, but it was one of the closest things you could have to a \"Las Vegas Experience\" (whatever that may be) given it's been in operation since 1950. It used to be you'd see the business community movers & shakers here; local and state politicians ate here frequently as well. The food was very good, but the experience was authentic...from the heart.  But, that changed. About 8-months ago the place had a remodel and is rebranding themselves as a Mexican Bistro. Now, let me start by saying the food wasn't bad, just bland. The service was actually quite good, but the authenticity of the place is gone. As we walked in, we walked over a fake grass pad and under patio umbrellas to the entrance. The place is totally redone...and done nicely. The floors have nice new trendy ceramic tile to look like wood planks, the décor is modern, the lighting is cool, the waiters are dressed smartly. Everything looked great and I was anticipating an equally great meal. Surprisingly, it had no people. For lunch, I'm used to standing around and waiting for somebody to leave. But that wasn't necessary on our visit as there were only three other tables taken when we walked in. This seemed odd given my previous experiences and that we were there during prime lunch time. And equally surprisingly, nobody else came in while we were there. By the time we left, we were the only group. We all ordered the chicken enchiladas, and three of us had combo #2 which includes beef tacos. The food came timely, the presentation was nice, but the food...meh...bland and unimpressive. Nobody at our table had a bad thing to say about the food, but we didn't have anything good thing to say either. And for this lunch-time blandness, with only soda to drink, the bill was $20 per person which isn't a lot of money, but it's more than I'd pay for an unimpressive lunch.  If folks are seeking the simple authenticity and goodness of Las Vegas' El Sombrero, they will be disappointed with El Sombrero Mexican Bistro. The place has changed and I have to say that although it's all dressed up, the goodness it once was is gone.  I sincerely hope the kitchen can catch up to the new look and that they can re-discover the reasons El Sombrero has thrived in Vegas for 65 years."}
{"text":"OMG! This place was the most amazing Mexican restaraunt I have ever been too. It was so by coincidence that I stumbled upon this place and I am so happy I did. There was not one thing bad about this place. Watermelon Sangria to die for. Chrispy chicken tacos were delicious and desert OMG! The atmosphere is wonderful and our waiter Jose was great. What an awesome find. I can't wait to go back. I wonder if tomorrow is too soon?"}
{"text":"Really delicious food. Just pricy for a \"locals\" lunch spot. Barbacoa tacos are amazing, rice, beans and salsa were also delicious! Great find. Great taco Tuesday deal here too."}
{"text":"There's gotta be that one, yanno? Unfortunately, tonight was one of those nights.   Its a very small spot in the art district. When we walked in, all eyes were at us. It was that small. Apartment small. So, when there is more than 40 people in a room, its loud. Loud to where I can't hear myself think.   I figured, hey, its Saturday. Let's make a reservation just in case it's super busy. I confirmed my reservation through yelp and received an email and a text. When we got there, they didn't have it. Luckily, there was a table. The thing was, since it was just myself and a lady friend, they had us sit at the available table and had us wait for the smaller table. Which the ppl that were sitting there was still finishing up their payment and conversation. Then when the table was cleaned, the waitress had us just stay at the table we were at. After we finally got some warm water, the other waiter tried having us switch tables again. Oi..Not a good start.   Food. We both got the 3 tacos plates. She had a beer and I had a margarita since the water was warm and gross. The food and drinks came out fast. Like, 3 mins fast. I didn't like that. It seemed everything was already cooked. My margarita was also brought out after 2 mins. So, I'm guessing they have a machine in the back and they just added ice and salted the rim. They're faster than a fast food chain! McDonalds isn't even that quick. Its impressive really. I was hungry!  I felt that the food was premade. My friend asked for double rice with no beans and no onions on her tacos and they got that wrong. None of our food was  warm either. Like it was just waiting to be ordered and was left under the heat lamp but wasn't directly under it. We shrugged it off and ate anyway.  The tortilla was dry to where it was breaking easily. The sauce on the mahi mahi taco was drowned in mayo based sauce or whatever its called. My carne asada was pretty dry. The salsa they gave us with the chips was watered down. No spice at all. The rice was hard. I barely bothered with the beans after eating hard rice that it was next to in a bowl.   Service. Like I said, not off to a good start. When asked how we were doing, the waitress turned around quickly completely ignoring my friends request. The check took a bit too. We were hoping for lightening speed payment but that's when they lagged. The most unfortunate thing to top the night off, the table next to us was obnoxious, arrogant and drunk. Which I don't mind typically, but they (the lady) were screaming and saying things about how they feel gay and making fun of the situation. I'm gay, so I didn't really appreciate it. The guys kept taking pics with us in it which made us super uncomfortable. It got to the point where I noticed one guy trying to take selfies with my friend in it. Half face of him and full body of her type of pics. Then the other guy tried taking pics with me. He legit put his arm on me and tried to take a pic with him. This happened while waiting for someone to grab our payment. It got to the point where I got up and told the guys to leave us alone. No worker was around which was unbelievable. I felt harassed at this point. I gave up, paid with cash and left.   So in short: Food wasnt hyped up as it was made to be and cold. Seems premade. Water was warm with no ice.  Service wasn't present much and order was messed up. For a Saturday, they should hire more help as I only saw two ppl working their butts off.    Our bill was $48 in total. Do yourselves a favor and go to Tacos El Gordo for cheaper and better warm tacos on a busy night. Ill give this place a shot again when its not so busy. I do feel bad for a review like this but yanno.   Side note: if you do give a 1-star review, someone will message you and tell you that you are a terrible person. They admittedly said they messaged another person as well who also gave a 1-star review tonight."}
{"text":"We were actually on our way to another restaurant, when we passed El Sombrero & my boyfriend said \"oh we still need to try that place.\" So I made a u-turn & we checked it out. I LOVE the decor inside...very cute. The ambiance is great. I really appreciate when music matches the food in a restaurant.  We started off with drinks. I got the margarita & he got the michelada. He enjoyed his michelada although he personally likes them spicier. I really liked my margarita. Too many Mexican restaurants try to get away with using syrup & generic margarita mix...not here! My margarita definitely did not have the thickness of the syrup I've had to endure at other Mexican restaurants nearby. I could taste the fresh lime juice. So on to the food... The salsa was a little on the watery side, but had a great flavor. The guacamole was simple & refreshing. I was looking forward to the mangoes on the Fresca Mexicana salad; so I was a little disappointed when it came out with watermelon instead of mangoes. When I asked the server, he told me that the salad is with watermelon right now because mangoes aren't in season. Makes complete sense, I just would have liked to be informed of that when I ordered. Nonetheless, the cilantro lime dressing was amazing! It ended up being a great light & refreshing salad. My boyfriend loved the carne asada taco. The veggie tacos lacked flavor so I would not recommend those. On the other hand, the vegetarian chile relleno had a great flavor! My boyfriend and I both agreed that the veggie chile relleno was our favorite dish today. For dessert, we had the chocolate dulce de leche cake...yummy yummy!!! Overall, everything was great except for the veggie tacos. I will definitely be back to try more!"}
{"text":"Not much from the outside, however on the inside, it is its own atmosphere!  Super great food!  Very nice and attentive staff, and my mom says that they have awesome sangrías  (I don't drink)  she says it is like a cadied apple!  Very nice dine in place"}
{"text":"I cannot say enough about this new remodeled look and feel! The environment is very unique and with plenty of character. The chef's menu cannot be duplicated. It is fantastic and everything I tried from the bean dip to the halibut was outstanding!  A must visit continuously from here on out!  I would also recommend this as a great date place. Intimate and sexy!"}
{"text":"This place has been in las Vegas for 50 years tucked away in a little corner on las Vegas Blvd. It's been revamped a few times . Great food and drink"}
{"text":"Amazing!!! I just left and I'm ready to head right back! Everything was delicious from start to finish! Great presentation, service, and atmosphere! Absolutely Yummmmmy!!"}
{"text":"Get to have some real Mexican food away from the strip. This place has an amazing vibe you will love it here."}
{"text":"This a great place!  Some of the best Mexican food I have ever had!  Ordered the chicken enchiladas and WOW! The service was also the best I have experienced in a long time in Vegas!  Highly recommend.  Great place to go eat on First Friday or before a show at The Smith Center.  Give it a try.  You won't regret it."}
{"text":"This little place is very beautiful on the inside! Surprisingly trendy look once you walk in! Food is top grade! Margaritas are off the hook  Fun place with great food Service is good"}
{"text":"Hands down, our new favorite Mexican restaurant in Vegas. The service was incredible - and what an unexpected place, from looking at it from the street.  I don't even like tamales, and these were incredible. The salsa is to die for. The michelada was cold and refreshing.  The only negative was the Sangria - it had an overwhelming cinnamon flavor, that I personally was not a fan of. The waiter notices I wasn't enjoying it, and offered to add more wine. That helped.   We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The walk here and back from our hotel was definitely worth it. I wanted to leave the hotel for a bit and walk like a local, little did I know how hot it would be. I was dragging to the finish line as we arrived to the El Sombrero.The heat is almost unbearable. When I say you don't need to be outside walking your newborn in the stroller, hun you don't need to be out here in this heat. But I guess people adapt to their surroundings, I just wouldn't be able to survive in Vegas as a walker. Jose was our hostess, server, bartender, and cashier. He was a God sent angel and the only one working. The restaurant's decor was cute and cozy with classic Spanish music playing. We ordered the guacamole and chicken nachos, chicken enchiladas, fish tacos, and the flan with strawberries. The food was delicious and to die for. All the spices, onions, cilantro, beans, and rice were authentic and reminded me of none other. I was never a fan of flan until I came here. The flan was perfect, a gift from heaven in this 100 degree weather. Never in my life had I ate anything more satisfying. As I was finishing up my meal, I couldn't even remember my first kiss at this point, the flan was so sweet and creamy with a whipped handmade topping. I arrived in my bathing suit and cover up and completely forgot I wasn't even dressed up, yet I felt right at home. This restaurant and Jose made me feel like I had taken an international trip to another island. I couldn't stop thinking about how good the food and host was. The bill was $69, but $39 with our Yelp deal. We finally asked Jose a few questions and he gladly answered. Stating the sauces and flavors were all homemade and all the staff work together on the flavors. I would give this place 10 stars if I could because I fell in love with Latin food all over again. Thank you guys for a memorable experience we will never forget. This restaurant should definitely consider selling their recipes in local grocery stores or farmers markets."}
{"text":"Best food and ambiance I've hat I have experienced in Vegas - but most cities I've been it.   Jose and Renee are so fun. Don't come here if you don't like personal contact and amazing recommendations!!  I don't recommend on Yelp often. Please come here so in a year they are still here when I come back!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Everything we had was so tasty. The beef tacos have shredded beef and are the best I've ever had. The jalapeño avocado cream on the flautas was garlicky and delicious. Will make this a must do when we return to Vegas!"}
{"text":"Really want this place to succeed, but they need to improve their service.  Last two times I've been there have been disappointed.  The last time, came early around 6pm for dinner, place has maybe three other tables.  Waiter seemed to have disappeared.    First off, no guacamole due to avocado shortage.  Ok, no worries, I'll have a salad and some street tacos.  Street tacos arrive but no salad.  I finish tacos and waiter comes by ask about dessert.  I mention the salad and he says let me check kitchen and \"See if it's ready\".  WTF?  See if a green salad is ready?  Really, are they growing the greens out back in a garden?  Ok, not that big of a deal, but would've preferred the waiter simply being honest and saying oh, I forgot or we must of missed it.  So waiter comes back and says it will be out in a minute.  I was like it's ok, we'll just take a check.  Service at La Comida, nearby is much better, just wish their parking was better too. :-("}
{"text":"Amazing!!!! It is the biggest hidden secret in Las Vegas!  Best Mexican food we have every had.  Owner/chef Irma has her family recipes and everything is delicious and all with a unique taste.  We had bacon wrapped stuffed jalapeños, street tacos, fajitas.... everything was beyond delicious!  Great music selection wonderful!!!!"}
{"text":"Love this new version of an old Vegas classic-it's a great addition to the downtown restaurant scene. The food is amazing (the Mexican corn is a must) and the service is friendly.  The sangria is so tasty--it's hard to have just one glass."}
{"text":"Absolutely a hidden gem! This is a romantic, intimate little hole in the wall Mexican restaurant with a maximum room capacity of 43. Margaritas by the glass pitcher. Great food options. Amazing chips & salsa. You have to make a reservation. Jose is the best. Thanks for making a memorable night."}
{"text":"Not as impressed as I'd hoped I was going to be here.....based on the reviews. We went on a Friday and had a slight mix up on the reservation(s) as two people from our party were both attempting to reserve tables since we had 13 guests mostly coming from out of town.  After one realized the reservation was made - they didn't call back to lock it in and the waiter made a stink about it even though they didn't block them off - multiple references, when no restaurant that doesn't get a confirmation back would have blocked them off either way - that's the party's fault.  But, instead of being happy we brought 13 Customers.....let's keep venting to one about it.  The food was ok - margarita's were good.  Waiter specifically said the Chile Verde \"is the best you've ever had\" - and unfortunately, it was far from it.  It was a pork chop - not tender at all - covered in sauce that was ok.....queso was also ok.  Beans/rice - not worth eating.  Enchiladas (pollo) were pretty good - girlfriend had them.    Oh - the attitude changed greatly when he realized my friend's wife was a lead concierge at the Wynn though btw....he then flipped to be pretty nice after that, asking if she was going to be able to join us repeatedly/etc.  Was hoping for better - service and food.  Also - can't split checks for large parties - just pay different amounts towards the overall - not a big deal."}
{"text":"Stumbled across this place by accident this morning. Could not have been a better meal. The tacos were outstanding, the chill relleno was amazing. Carlos and Angel provided top notch service from the second we walked in the door. If you're a local and haven't been here you're missing out. If you're visiting the area like we are, you'd be missing the best Vegas has to offer. Definitely a place we'll be coming back to time and time again."}
{"text":"Visited this place  for the first time last night with a friend. Parking is conviniently located on the side of the restaurant. First off the restaurant is small, I think the max capacity is 45 people.  We came at the right time and were seated fairly soon but next time I will definitely make reservations ahead of time to be on the safe side. We ordered the guacamole,  margaritas,  a chicken salad and the chicken  enchiladas. All were delicious and the portions were a good size. The service from the wait staff was also good. I've found another gem in downtown LV :)"}
{"text":"Don't eat here, it took for ever to get the food, staff not friendly at all, over priced food, tasted very flat no flavor, stay away from this place. There are other great Mexican restaurants around there area, I wished I would read Yelp reviews before I came to this so called Mexican bistro, isn't the word bistro mostly used by itala"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now, and I've tried something different each time. Each time, the food has been great, other than the last visit.   The reason I choose to update my review:  The service. For literally only having 3 tables of customers, it was horrible. The waiter was not very attentive, and he's not very friendly. It's the same waiter we had the last time we were there. When he messes up an order, he gives you an attitude. Or he just kind of rolls his eyes and giggles like it's supposed to be funny. And what was even more silly--a table of wealthy appearing people sat at the table next to us. And he was ALL about them.   They also changed the menu and took off some amazing dishes that I recommended before.  So, it really has gotten disappointing. From amazing to meh in a few visits. It sucks that I recommended this place to so many people.   Keep on keepin' on, dude. You're going to ruin that place with your lack of service."}
{"text":"TL, DR; Never coming back here. My mother and I just wanted to be listened to about our bad experience when we were at the restaurant. After being ignored for most of our bland meal, the manager decided to argue instead of listening to us.  My mom had a voucher through TravelZoo, so we decided to head in for dinner while I was in town. We found this place no problem, and it was nice that there was free parking on site. The black and white decor was sleek and minimalist, so my mom and I had decent expectations coming in. We were sat immediately, and presented with menus, so far, so good.  On the other side of the dining room, the owners sat with some friends, and there was a table of six people being served by both servers working. Three other couples, including friends of the owners, who were greeted by them instantly, were served well before my mother and I. It was a half an hour before our order was taken by the other server, who did not write down our order and got my entree incorrect.  The owners touched the tables of their friends while ignoring the other tables, and my beverage was empty by the time the appetizer was dropped. The server did not offer a refill until after we received our entrees. It was uncomfortably obvious that the friends of the owners, as well as the owner's own table received preferential treatment.  The server placed my entree, saying that yes, I ordered the chicken enchiladas but I actually ordered the chicken tamales. My mom's entree of chicken mole, her accompanying rice and beans, and my own rice and beans were all cold. The server barely peeked at our table five minutes after I received my correct entree and he disappeared before I had the chance to complain. There was also a large, yellowed branch of cilantro as a garnish.  The food was underseasoned in addition to being lukewarm. When the other server who originally sat us  finally graced us with his presence I asked to see the manager, he replied that he was the manager. I explained why we were dissatisfied, and he decided to argruhe e with me. exclaiming \"what do you want me to do?\" I said that if he had actually touched our table instead of being ignored, we would have spoke up at the time. He then launched in a tirade about how if we were in this industry, (I'm a cook in a fine dining restaurant, I get it.) then we would understand how hard his job was. I let him know that I am in the same industry, but at this time I was so livid, I told him \"Thanks for nothing\" and walked out."}
{"text":"I have been eating rellenos here for many years. What has happened, today they were made with chopped chili peppers and the cheese is like rubber."}
{"text":"The tacos were great and nice atmosphere.  One recommendation to make 5 Star is to have specials that mock your haters and celebrate your fans, i.e.  3 Dead Banditos with Soros limp dick and McCain salsa or Trump Grande with MAGA relenos, sauce is nuclear."}
{"text":"I was very underwhelmed by the food here. What is everyone talking about?? The decor inside is very well done in black and white, nice wood flooring, etc. and the staff were all friendly, but the food was so mediocre, I am perplexed. The charbroiled calamari was decent enough tasting but not as special as I'd been led to believe by Brock Radke's newspaper review, and the carne tamale was so bland I didn't eat it. I had loved the tamale at Mundo, the owner's other restaurant, and had hoped it would be the same but alas, the old grandma that I was told makes these tamales does not measure up. The chile relleno was just ok as well. I was so excited for non-breaded chile relleno and non-fried calamari, but the reality was a disappointment. The prices would be fine if the quality was there, but totally not worth it as it stands currently. Too bad..."}
{"text":"This place was great!  The food was delicious,  the service was amazing,  and the decor and atmosphere was perfect! We were at the smith center and wanted to eat somewhere close by. We happened to find this place.  A diamond in the rough! Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Very skeptical while driving to this place. Not the best location, but we gave it a chance and WOW. it was delicious. I had the chicken burrito. Green sauce is AMAZING"}
{"text":"Amazing! Would give it more stars if possible! Our best dinner so far! The watermelon margarita and house-made sangria are fantastic! A great place :)"}
{"text":"Items Selected: Housemade chips and salsa Sangria Trio - Blushing Senorita:  Watermelon, Lime, Mint, Rose / Roja: Red Apples, Orange Wedges, Strawberries, Red Wine / Blanco: Orange, Green Apples, Bay Leaf, Chardonnay Quesillo Fondue Mexicano - Mexican Cheeses, Hormiga Sauce, Roasted Cherry Tomatoes, Flour Tortillas Spicy Calamari a la brasa - Squid Ink, Citrus Jalapeno charbroiled calamari Parrilladas Del Patron- Grilled Filet Mignon, Rib Eye, Costillitas, Mexican Cream Corn, Portabellos, Papas Criollas with Ancho Chile Steak Sauce, Chimichurri Sauce, Hormiga Sauce Tamal de Pollo - braised and seasoned shredded chicken, roasted garlic creamy tomatillo sauce Mole Semana Santa - Roasted Chicken in traditional Mexican spicy Chocolate Sauce Bread Pudding - dulce de leche  Re-inventing Las Vegas' former 'oldest restaurant' into an upscale \"bistro\" helmed by Chef Oscar Sanchez it was with high hopes of Latin cuisine rivaling that found in New Mexico or Arizona that plans were made to dine at El Sombrero and although a rude welcome by the woman who turned out to be the restaurant's owner put an early damper on the experience the food, service, and setting that followed were nothing short of first-rate.  Joined by two others, one well known to the restaurant, for a lunch beginning just shy of noon it was amidst the cozy modernized confines of a room suited for less than fifty that the meal commenced and with free-flowing tortillas hot and crisp from the kitchen flanked by aromatic salsa not overburdened by heat a strong attention to detail was obvious from the start.  Generally underwhelmed by Sangria, but told that El Sombrero's was far better than the average grog, a 'one of each' sampling immediately proved the point as bright balance and bold aromatics nuanced each of the infusions and with a duo of strong starters soon to arrive the dominant fruit tones were a welcomed refresher between bites - the creamy Quesillo offering subtle hints of smoke when matched to the Roja while tender ringlets of squid bathed in a murky broth teaming with citrus and spice proved every bit the 'signature' starter that many have claimed - a similar paella presentation apparently offered for special events immediately piquing interest for a future visit with several other options offered for groups as large as sixteen.  Transitioning next to a platter of meats traditionally offered only at dinner suffice it to say that the Parrilladas Del Patron is more than enough to feed two assuming starters are ordered and although the pork short ribs proved a bit too fatty to be fully enjoyed both of the beef options were impressively tender and spiced only enough to let the quality of the meet shine - a similar compliment offered to tender mushrooms while sides of crispy potatoes, tender beans, and pan-scalded corn in light cream were no less than superb.  Certainly a bigger fan of tamales than either of my dining buddies, albeit a bit let down that the restaurant was currently out of brisket, there is no doubt in my mind that Oscar's Tamal de Pollo is the least heavy-handed I've tasted to date and with garlic tinged tomatillo sauce melding nicely to the sweet corn it was the roasted chicken that truly made the plate shine, a statement almost equally well suited to the tender-roast bird beneath the sort of mole uncommonly seen at all but the most authentic of spots, a 'dirty' dark sauce teaming with spice with only the slightest cocoa linger as opposed to the sugar-sweet chocolate syrup popularized by more Americanized spots.  Finishing the afternoon with the restaurant's only daily dessert, a pleasant bread pudding with silky-soft texture doused in dulce de leche, it was once again here that Chef Sanchez arrived tableside to make sure all was well and with compliments and thanks paid to the chef and servers any lamenting the closure of the original El Sombrero should find consolation in the fact that sometimes the right team really can teach an old dog some new tricks."}
{"text":"Great food and service owner was super nice if you are in the area and want great Mexican authentic food eat here"}
{"text":"Amazing food and the staff was very friendly and prompt ! Be back soon ! FYI the tacos are fucking amazing  fresh tortillas !"}
{"text":"The enchiladas were delicious!  They don't offer a children's menu. This is more upscale restaurant don't expect to pay less than 15 per plate. I saw the reviews on Yelp and was eager to try this place. We just left the Vegas Strip and wanted a good family restaurant to eat at. For a family of 5 (2 small children) our bill was $80. I should have stayed on the strip for this price. I enjoyed the enchiladas my older kids had nachos. More chips than toppings. My husband had the $2 Taco Tuesday special and he said he would have gotten better tacos at a taqueria. The beans were more like chili beans and were a little spicy. I also had a $5 margarita that was on special. I WAS CHARGED THE REGULAR PRICE!  I brought it up to the waiter and he said that the special was only for happy hour but would honor it since the waitress taking our order made the mistake in thinking the special was still on going. I also had a 10% discount from Yelp but was told we couldn't get the $2 tacos and $5 margarita special and 10% discount.  VERY CONFUSING SINCE WE WERE NOT INFORMED UNTIL PAYING THE BILL. I WANTED TO LOVE THIS RESTAURANT BUT IT HIGHLY OVER PRICED!!!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service and very reasonable prices! Excellent presentation you'd expect in an exclusive restaurant. Intimate atmosphere that's great for dates. I love this place!"}
{"text":"Saw all the great reviews and decided to eat there tonight. We walked in and no one greeted us, so went to sit down(thinking it was seat yourself).  The waiter came up to us and asked if we had reservations-no we did not; however, there were plenty of open tables.  He told us that table was reserved but we could have the table next to the front door. Ok fine, that would not lower my rating. Guacamole for appetizer was ok as were the chips and salsa. My chile relleno dinner arrived cold along with the rice and beans.   They did re heat for me but truly the dish was not good. The ground meat had a weird taste. My husband ordered the hanger steak. He said it was ok-not worth the money. Our dinner guest ordered the chicken tacos-nothing special. Dining room small, tables too close together. To top the night off, the table we wanted to sit at originally was never taken. Honestly for the money, NOT WORTH IT!  Plus, portions are small! Will not return-there are much better Mexican restaurants in this city for a less expensive price. Disappointing!"}
{"text":"We returned to  the new El Sombrello  concerned that we would  miss the warmth of the old family food and atmosphere. We needn't  have. Right from the start the service was superb. The layout of the room made it seem much larger then in the past. The food was  even better. We'll  be back."}
{"text":"The food was amazing and our server so attentive. He knew we we're going to a show so he kept that in mind so that we were in time. He also made recommendations based on the fact we were going somewhere nice and didn't want anything messy or that would sit to heavy. The meat was marinated so well it was to die for! Very tiny make a reservation!"}
{"text":"We felt the food was ok, service slow, but loved their homemade salsa. A bit disappointed wine selection only, but the watermelon sangria was tasty. We may give it another try."}
{"text":"Sorry but there is nothing authentic about the food here.  Not sure how they are highly rated.  Basically they put ingredients together and fancy it up to hide the fact that the favors are underwhelming.  If you want pretty food, please indulge, but if you want real Mexican food this is not the place.  At this point Chili's makes a better plate for the price.  My advice is, they need to stop trying to Americanize Mexican food and learn to speak proper Spanish when in a conversation.  Which ironically is the best way to describe this place."}
{"text":"Jose is the best! I had such a great experience here for my sister's 21st birthday. The food is INCREDIBLE, and the customer service is outstanding. 10/10 would recommend"}
{"text":"Super cute hidden gem downtown with amazing food. Looks like it was built in someone's home. Our food was amazing and our pitcher of Cadillac margs were some strong stuff but expertly made. Surf and turf fajitas, elote..... absolutely killer.   Reservations definitely recommended. This is a small hole in the wall place."}
{"text":"Awesome gem !  Jose greeted us and made us feel like family. Started with appetizer of cheese dip with tortillas. Sort of a quesadilla unpacked.   Both of us had chicken enchiladas plus beef taco. Everything is fresh and not ordinary at all :::   Salsa awesome ! Sangria ... Amazing !  When in downtown ... This is the place"}
{"text":"Straight up authentic Mexican food. Perhaps some of the most authentic I've tasted in town.  From the outside, it's this teeny tiny little building just on the fringes of the Arts District. It doesn't look like too much on the outside. When you walk in, however, it's a completely different story.  It's very small, very intimate, very artsy. They have a DJ spin music in the corner, and there may be a wait because of food quality and how tiny it is.  Two things that are must get: Their red sangria, and their guacamole. Their red sangria is delicious. Probably some of the best I've had. I'm also a notorious chip eater. Guac is pretty commonplace in any Mexican restaurant, but here? I could be buried with a small bowl of their guac, and it would be like I had already visited Heaven. Well, \"Guac Heaven\", I suppose if there are different subsets and levels a la Dante, but I suppose I can linger there a millenia or two....  We tried the sampler platter. Their cuts of meats are tender, melt in your mouth level, and seasoned to perfection.  I've been here twice, and I am well satisfied enough to recommend it to friends, and by proxy you, for that matter.  If you like authenic, flavorful Mexican food, and don't mind the small space and some wait time, this is like you've died and gone to Heaven.  But not \"Guac Heaven\", because I'm selfish, and claiming sole residency of that place. But you can still visit from time to time."}
{"text":"The best (chocolate) mole enchilada outside of mom's house. Though could have used more sauce-a bit dry. Rice was undercooked. This was lunch so I cannot be cooking critical. I agree with another reviewer's remark, \"I want this place to succeed.\" So I will be returning for dinner. Try it, you'll like it!"}
{"text":"We had a chance to dine at The El Sombrero today. We chose to have lunch here because of the mostly good reviews by fellow Yelpers. Nothing impressed us about the food, portions or price. The service was great as we was the only diners present for awhile.  I don't think we will be returning here anytime soon. Maybe the dinner dining is better, lunch is no thank you."}
{"text":"Party of ten on a Saturday night.  We were the only ones there but feel that the construction in the area impacted this.   It was amazing.   The service, the drinks, the food.   We all had a smattering of menu items and no one was disappointed.    I can attest to the fajitas and nachos being outstanding.   The decor is so charming and well thought out.   I wish them much success and strongly recommend you make the journey there."}
{"text":"This Place is AMAZING!! From the Ambiance, to the food and drinks. This place is to die for. Jose and his staff did an awesome job with making us feel at home and apart of the family. Myself, my boyfriend and best friend really enjoyed ourselves! The Sangrias are so amazing and so delicious!! We are not from Las Vegas and was here on vacation from Los Angeles and we will be back and the next time we are here we will be sure to stop in with our friends to say hello and enjoy some great food!! You will most definitely see me again!"}
{"text":"Was looking to get off the strip one night and find something \"local\". Found this little gem near the budding Art's district near downtown. Awesome food and cozy ambiance in simple, open space. Easy for vegetarians and gluten free. Very quiet when I visited, but began to fill up and I sensed it has a good following. Nice escape from the din of Las Vegas."}
{"text":"great service great food...  carlos our server  was amazing!!_  great customer service very friendly!! will definitely come back!!!!!"}
{"text":"Another local bookmark checked off, this time with my son in tow.  After reading Yelp friends' glowing reviews, this was a place I wanted to try pronto.  Located on Main St. between Bonneville and Charleston, I had made a reservation for 8:00pm last Saturday night.  I arrived first since Kiddo was just getting off of work and then he got there late.  Upon being seated by Jose, I was told that a private party of 30 would be coming in at 9:00pm.  I wasn't sure if I was being told to hurry up, order, and eat by 9:00pm or what, so I asked Jose to clarify the situation.  He reassured me that I wouldn't be rushed off, but that it was going to get noisy and people would be milling around just like at a party and if that was going to be alright with me.  I told him it was A-OK and we got moved to a corner table instead of being seated in the middle of the one-room establishment.  Despite the private party that did eventually arrive, we had great service and were checked on by three different staff members when we were there.    -small room with 43 person capacity according to Official Capacity wall sign -reservations are therefore a good idea for dinner, just in case; I used the Yelp app on my phone to do so -housemade chips and salsa are so good that you can get full on these alone.  To quench my thirst while waiting for my tardy son, I ordered the refreshing Blanca (white) Sangria ($8), fruity and light. -I had the tamal de pollo ($14) served with rice and charro beans--delicious!  The tamale was not dry at all, something that I've experienced too often at other Mexican restaurants.   -Kiddo had the 3 taco plate ($12), with 2 chicken and 1 brisket taco.  The order actually comes out with the meats on a platter, plus three tortillas, salsa, guacamole, and a red sauce so you can do-it-yourself.  Other meat options are carnitas (they were sold out), camarones, fish, and chorizo carne asada. Hijo loved the brisket and said he should have ordered more of it versus the chicken.  This spot deserves the praise that it's received and I will be back for more soon with the b/f; he'll definitely love the chips.  Business Hours:  Monday-Thursday:  11am-9pm Friday- Saturday:  11am- 10pm (NOT 9pm as the Yelp business listing states) Closed on Sundays"}
{"text":"I really want to like this place. I went to the old El Sombrero and enjoyed it but after reading great reviews here and on Facebook I was looking forward to trying out the new place.   I called to see what the hours were and was advised to make a reservation. We came, party of 2, and found half of the 14 tables empty. After waiting for about 60 seconds at the empty host booth, we were finally seated by the busser.   The service was exceedingly slow by the server. We waited about 5-10 minutes after an introduction to ask questions about the menu and order. It was another 10 minutes before we were notified that the soup we ordered wasn't available. When our food came it looked incomplete, but after a couple minutes we started eating. Turns out the bus person made an honest mistake but it wasn't caught by the server in time so 95% of another table's order ended up in the trash. No check-in after our proper order arrived. 5 minute wait from getting our check  to getting the card charged. There were 5 other tables. The server blamed the slowness of the food on a missing cook but there is no excuse for such slow attention at the table. The busser was the only person who I'd say was sufficiently doing their job.   The food was good, with the potential to be great. The price point is a little high, but the chips are spiced and the salsa is great. We had the tradicional combo and the meats were solid, sauces were decent. We had some fries that were crispy and nicely salted and the rice and beans were fine. We avoided the enchiladas because 14 bucks with no rice and beans is just ridiculous.   The decor is simple and modern with lots of mirrors to open up the small space. Smooth electronic music was playing that made it feel like Red Rock Station, but I personally like the eclectic homey feel the old place had or Casa Don Juan has.   I hope they tweak the menu, prices and especially the service, cause this spot could be great"}
{"text":"Had this little place bookmarked for a while due to the amazing Yelp reviews. Well, I am not sure what the big deal is here.... not in a great location but overlooked that fact!  First, we walk in before 12:00 noon and there was no one to greet us so we stood there for a minute waiting. There was only one other table of people and some guy on his cell phone sitting at a corner table. He kept looking at us but didn't make any attempt to help us. My friend assumed he was the owner but I am not sure as he disappeared shortly into the kitchen. We finally asked the people that we're sitting down and they told us to sit anywhere. Ok, lost a star. Next the server came out with the menus, she was nice enough but serving the entire little restaurant by herself. Really?? So the menu was interesting and I opted for a chicken burrito loaded with beans, rice, chicken, vegetables, topped with creamy tomatillo sauce and sour cream. It came out quickly but at a lukewarm temperature. Another star gone. I like my food served hot and was super bland tasting. For $12 I expected something a little more exciting. I know it is just a burrito but I can get the same one at another restaurant nearby for much less money. In fact, I didn't even finish it. I boxed it up to go. My friend told me, you aren't going to eat that. I told her she was right, but knew I would give it to a homeless person for nourishment when we left which is exactly what I did. For a restaurant that has been here for many years, I was not impressed. The only reason I gave it three stars is because I felt bad for our server being on her own. Will I go back? Nah, there are better places to dine downtown."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with bot the service and food.  Event the chips and salsa were sub-par.  Perhaps I caught them on a bad day, but my experience was far below my expectation."}
{"text":"Great food! Service was prompt and staff was knowledgeable about all items on the menu. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is the original Mexican restaurant in Vegas, recently remodeled.  The food is fabulous, must try the guac too."}
{"text":"Jose is amazing as is the food.  Thank you for making our friends batchelor party dinner!"}
{"text":"\"I hate tacos\"....said no Juan ever.   Visited on Saturday 4-30-16 around 5:45PM for an early dinner.  This restaurant is located on Main between Charleston and Bonneville.  $58.89 got us a guacamole appetizer, a margarita, an iced tea, a fish entree, a side of corn, and a taco entree.    I loved the bright blue paint on the outside of the building and the swanky decor on the inside.  The mustard and grey theme is so elegant yet comfortable.  Cloth napkins always make me feel so fancy!  They do have high chairs for the kiddos.  There was some good people-watching here when we went...this seems to be a hangout for the older trophy wife crowd...lots of Joan Rivers-wannabe's.    They brought us some chips and salsa to start and we ordered a watermelon margarita ($9), an iced tea ($3.50), and guacamole ($8).  Usually chips are my favorite part about eatin' at Mexican joints but these were gross...they were pale in color and somebody had dusted a brown seasoning on them but it was uneven...like there would be one chip that was completely covered and some had no seasoning at all.  I got quite a few chips that were *flexible* which was a real turn-off.  My husband ate them anyways and then the basket sat empty for quite a while which was a real bummer cuz' there was quite a bit of guac left and we were starving.  The margarita was pretty weak and had no watermelon flavor at all...it tasted to me like just simple syrup and tequila with some marinated watermelon pieces on top.    Husband got the pescado veracruzana for $18.00.  It was branzino with chiles, tomatoes, capers, olive oil, onions, and olives.  The fish was incredibly tender and tasty and husband was very pleased with his dish.    I got the three taco plate for $15.00 and chose mahi mahi, chicken, and carne asada.  All three were tasty although inundated with cilantro which I hate but tolerate.  I liked their tortillas because they were a bit thicker than I'm used to and very tasty.  Unfortunately this dish gave me indigestion and I was burping it up for the next 24 hours or so.  My white girl tummy is too delicate for this dish I guess.    The best part of the meal was the mexican cream corn...if you go this is a must!   The grilled corn was so sweet and creamy and cheesy!  It was absolutely wonderful.  I wanted dessert but they took so long to bring the bill I was over it and just wanted to leave.    The food took a while to come out, it was relatively expensive, nothing was unique, the food gave me tummy troubles, and I have no urge to go back."}
{"text":"If I was on death row and had to chose my last meal, it would be the Tamal De Pollo. The creamy garlic tomatillo salsa slathered on top of the tamale was absolutely divine. I cannot stop thinking about it.   I ordered the guacamole as well which was very good. It had a slight kick to it which I loved.   The ambience of the restaurant is very warm and homey. This may be due to the fact that the restaurant looks and feels like a home! It's a cute blue house with whimsical wallpaper and cute decorative accents. I felt like I was in my own living room!   My family and I arrived at about 5:30 p.m. for an earlier dinner with a reservation before seeing a show at the Smith Center. Reservations are a must since the dining area is the size of a living room!"}
{"text":"THEE spot for Mexican cuisine in Las Vegas. If you are in town, this isn't a place you want to miss! Incredible ambience, terrific service, and an overall great experience. Hats off to El Sombrero!! 5 stars!"}
{"text":"FINALLY!!!!!!! I have found the best Mexican in town people!!! So amazing! First of all it's the oldest restaurant in Las Vegas which is pretty cool but it's so pretty inside!! Love the decor .. the margaritas OMG so fresh and good ingredients you can taste the quality ! The chips and salsa is so good couldn't stop eating! We also got the cheese dip and the guacamole and the bacon wrapped jalapeños!! All tasty! For dinner we got the big meat platter and chicken enchiladas! So much food!!!!!! The corn and the beans and the taco sauces were to die for and they make fresh handmade tortillas ... heaven!! We also got the flan and the banana bread pudding !! EVERYTHING was delicious... will be returning again and again!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Chille Relleno and Enchilada combination, well presentation is over done, food was bland, beans were reduced to a smear sauce, Enchilada was basically a tortilla rolled up with chicken and condiments were added on top  It lacks the Mexican authentic taste.  And for what they charge its simply not worth it, i would recommend taco bell instead."}
{"text":"The food is around 4 stars in quality: I had the Mahi tacos, as the veggie enchiladas were unavailable. Solid, flavorful. But here's the thing--$15 for three small tacos is steep, and they're not as plentiful or flavorful as Bomb Tacos. So, the value isn't quite there. That drops them down a star. Service was fine. But at that price point I do expect a little more."}
{"text":"Sub par food, terribly slow service! Waited 18 minutes for our check and we had to ask for it!"}
{"text":"Friendly, very clean, reasonably priced, oh!   .........and the food was really good too!"}
{"text":"Had dinner with some friends or the other evening had a wet burrito it was excellent and piping-hot just  the way I like my food served! Had 2 beers and 2 shots of tequila ice cold all of them delicious! Bueno!"}
{"text":"This is absolutely my favorite Mexican place in Las Vegas. The menu is incredible! This is not your typical Mexican place either. Definitely a place to bring a date or out of town folks. We started with the guacamole, and delicious chips and salsa then went into our dinner of fresh Mole Enchiladas and a rare treat of Pescado ala Veracruzano. We ate every little piece. The owners visited with us and treated us to the best Sangria I've ever had, I wish I could take a gallon home. We also sampled the pork belly taco (we decided then to come back for sangria and tacos on Taco Tuesday). We finished dinner with their banana bread pudding, this is where I'm finicky...big win! Great atmosphere, wonderful story to the restaurant (oldest in Nevada) and the wait staff was very friendly. It is really one of Nevada's jewels!"}
{"text":"Amazing hidden gem. This place might look ordinary from the outside, but when you walk in, it's well decorated and very modern. When we went, the owner was there. She was really cool; came to our table and spoke to us. The food is amazing, starting from the chips with salsa. Their menus are very simple, not like other Mexican restaurants that have 1,000 things on the menu but they only do about 10 of the items on the menu. The food has an authentic taste and the beer is served very elegantly. We tasted the  Tres Leche dessert. It's the best cake I have ever tasted in my life! I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I just enjoyed an excellent meal. The Hanger Steak - a special - was moist and tender, perfectly cooked, and each of the 3 sauces stood on its own.    There were 9 in my group, and everyone was pleased. I love taking a group here; everyone always leaves happy.  Thank you again for the superlative service, Jose."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican place in town! The tamale, guac and bacon wrapped jalepenos are my go-to every visit."}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere and ambiance of this restaurant. Wish we had discovered this place sooner!  Before we could even enter the restaurant our waiter was outside greeting us.  It's a small place with only about 12 tables so it fills up quickly.  The homemade chips and salsa really hit the spot.  The seasoning on the chips had just enough kick.  A few of the chips were soggy.  The salsa was super fresh and not too hot, which I loved.  I could actually taste the garlic and cilantro.  The queso fundido came out with homemade flour tortillas, the super thin kind.  It was a thin layer of white cheese with a few dollops of a chorizo type sauce.  My fav thing ever was the watermelon sangria.  It was my ultimate favorite and I could have had 50 of them!  It was super light and fresh.  It had pieces of fresh watermelon in it as well.  The turf in the surf and turf was a little too dry and chewy for my taste.  The chile Relleno was fabulous and the red sauce so flavorful!  The tres Leches is different.  It was a chocolate cake not like a traditional Leches that I am used to.  Still good though.  The service was perfect.  We will definitely be back!  What a fun evening this made!"}
{"text":"The food here was great!! I had the carne asada tacos and chicken enchilada's.  The fresh guacamole is to DIE FOR and I spread it over everything!! The sangria's were refreshing, crisp and complimented the meal very well. Loved the decor, and the jazz playing in the background. If you are in Vegas and want to eat some delicious Mexican cuisine, El Sombrero is your place!!!"}
{"text":"10 reasons to visit this 5 star restaraunt.   1) The staff are very attentive and helpful. 2) The ambiance is chic,  rustic and modern. Very clean and cozy. 3) The food is outstanding. Gourmet Mexican food at its finest ! 4) 43 people capacity, so make a reservation for dinner! And Saturday brunch! 5) Sangria is amazing. That should be enough but I'll keep going... 6) Beautiful presentation of dishes. 7) Green chicken enchiladas is grandma kitchen quality...just amazing! 8) Music is relaxing, mixture of English and Spanish tunes. 9) Great place for a business meeting. 10)  Or a romantic date! What are you waiting for ? Go now.!"}
{"text":"Delicious and very clean restaurant. Came here for lunch and just fell in love with the atmosphere and ambiance.   The food was delicious and authentic."}
{"text":"Such amazing food! And the environment was great! Really attentive service and everyone was so nice! I will definitely be recommending this restaurant to others!"}
{"text":"The re-modeling of the inside was nicely done but it stops there. Not the same food from the old El Sombrero. It should be called The Hat because it is not traditional Mexican Food. The chicken tacos were flavorless, shredded beef enchiladas were very dry along with the meat being tough. The tamal dish was saturated with an overpowering red sauce. Service was adequate, I asked for a white sangria and they brought me red sangria twice and the waiter also suggested to split a dinner plate but when he brought it out it was not done. I think I will stick to the other hole in the wall Mexican places in Vegas."}
{"text":"Ango-style \"Tex Mex\" food that isn't very authentic nor that good. Honestly, the new owner got rid of what made this place special: authentic food."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, incredible service. 100% worth the stop if you're close. I got the mahi tacos. Next time I'm going to try the mole as recommended by Jose - what an awesome guy! Will definitely be back soon :)"}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise. So good, we came back twice during our weekend in Vegas. Don't drive by just because the exterior looks a little rundown and the neighborhood is not so great. Step inside for a great meal.  I can vouch for the enchiladas de mole and the barbacoa tacos, both of which were spectacular. Pollo asada and veggie tacos were good, but paled beside the barbacoa.  Our server Jose was friendly enough to even get me started in conversation, quite a feat since I'm an inveterate misanthrope and let my wife handle all the necessary social interaction. I promised him I'd leave a review.  Great place, 5 stars."}
{"text":"I am really surprised this place has so many stars. My friends and I ate here two weeks ago after seeing a show at the smith center.  There were a couple other tables but the place was not even half full. They only sell beer and wine, i.e., no margaritas or mescal:( My husband ordered the tacos mixto because he was undecided and according to the menu it came with three meats, this way he'd be able to try each meat.  When it arrived there was only one meat so we inquired about the others, it was \"explained\" that was what he ordered...uh, ok.  It's a poor name for the dish if you only get one.   I ordered the spicy calamari appetizer as my meal - everyone's meal came out ahead of mine, which is no big deal, but it took a long time to come out, I'd say at least another 10 minutes. Then when it arrived I was disappointed.  It was supposed to be grilled and it wasn't and it was just the rings, like what you get at a pizza joint to dip in marinara.  I took a couple bites and didn't like it.  I don't remember the server asking how the meal was, when someone leaves a whole dish practically untouched, that should raise a question.  Our friends ordered the mole Santa and chile relleno. The group's overall consensus was meh, overpriced and nothing special.  Too bad:/"}
{"text":"Had not come here since the remodel, so we decided to give it a go. We called beforehand to make a reservation and thank goodness we did. They had a few large groups coming in for dinner so space was limited.  Got there early for our reservation and was immediately seated. Water was brought and chips and salsa. The salsa was fairly mild so we decided to order some guacamole too. We ordered drinks, sangria and a margarita on the rocks. And everything came quickly. The sangria was really tasty and more on the sweet side. The margarita was very good as well.  We both ordered the chicken enchiladas and that came out very quickly. I loved the enchilada sauce and the chicken was very flavorful and juicy.  The dessert options sounded yummy but we were too full haha. Definitely want to try a dessert next time.  Really great place and delicious food. I look forward to coming back here."}
{"text":"Terrible place. Found hair in the food. Ask them to remake it, and the owner Irma Aguirre started to yell at me and told me to get out or she will call the cops. As I was leaving, she threaten to call the cops for not paying. I stated she can proceed to call them and that I will be waiting for them outside, but that she can be aware that I will file with the health board. Avoid this place!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome Mexican food and fabulous really informative service as well. Introduced us to many new dishes that were really tasty. Highly recommended!!!!"}
{"text":"Very fresh and unusual not the type Mexican food  we typically encounter. Small intimate size building and upper end pricing. We tried the bacon wrapped jalapeños w cheese as appetizers  and they were good. Cheese fondue was not stretchy enough for our teenagers with us. Chili rellano was not cheesy enough but good tasting."}
