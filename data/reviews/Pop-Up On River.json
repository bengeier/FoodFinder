{"text":"Love love love the homemade burger, favorfull and just awesome when you add a little cheese and bacon! 

My only tip/complaint is when they get a lunch rush the orders come out really slow. I never usually mind but sometimes when you're in a bit of a rush it can be a little frustrating. 

The 2 girls who are running the place are awesome, they know what they are doing and I can't wait to see their progress a year from now!"}

Fantastic spot for comfort food hidden on River Street. Started to gain more popularity as there are more condo constructions coming up! 

My hubby and I were hoping to grab breakfast this morning but Pop up on River do not serve breakfast... at least not yet :p The two ladies looking after the restaurant were friendly and personable. They run the kitchen too!

Ordered the beer battered fish and chips for breakfast lol. Batter was crispy, fries were a tad oily. You can get small packets of tartar sauce, malted vinegar, ketchup, salt and pepper to go.

We also ordered 10 wings with your choice of sauce. We thought the wings were made in a smoker. But the incredible smoky taste actually came from the sauces! You can also request to have the sauce on the side.

Banana milkshake was quite satisfying! I preferred this one over the strawberry one my hubby got. There were many flavours to choose from and you can mix and match - ie. Chocolate Banana, Strawberry Vanilla :D

Overall, great place for comfort food! I heard the souvlaki here is good too. Would come back again! Although it is a pop up restaurant, I'm sure this place is here to stay for a couple years :)"}
