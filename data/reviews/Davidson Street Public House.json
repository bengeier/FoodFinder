{"text":"Where to begin......  Came here tonight for the first time because my cousin was recommended by coworkers. There was no wait, which is great. Well, our waitress told us this was her first job waiting tables. And although she was not terrible it showed. It was a little awkward and I'm not a fan of someone who comes to the table constantly to ask if we are ok.   Onto the food:  Apps.....chicken wings. Hmmmm I don't even know how to describe these. The dry rub was quite unique, not horrible but def not anything to rave about. We also had the pork belly sliders. This one item was the favorite of the evening. We opted to not have the pimento cheese on there and that was probably for the best. I'm not sure why but a lot of the items seemed to have pimento cheese.....   So I had the steak sandwich. Not a fan at all. There was too much going on. I actually had one item taken off of the sandwich and it was still too much. It was really messy and not enjoyable to eat.  We also had the roast turkey. Seemed dry to me but that's not really anything new with turkey. It came with hummus but we opted for it to be on the side. Honestly I don't think it would have added anything to the sandwich. In addition we tried the burger. Meh. The FF though were quite delicious.   I will say that the menu is limited and seemed overly crowded somehow. Each dinner item had so many ingredients and none of it really drew me in. Maybe less is more?? For spending $75 it was one of the worse most expensive meals I've had in Charlotte. NoDa this is not what you needed nor do I think it will last. So disappointed......"}
{"text":"Amazing food. We loved our server logan. His recommendations were perfect and he was a lot of fun"}
{"text":"What a nice surprise. After Miyagi's closed their doors I was a bit skeptical of this place recommended by a friend but we met on a Wednesday night and I had a salad that might have been the best I've ever had. Maybe it was the bacon.   The salad was made of radicchio; something this educated herbivore had never heard of. Kudos. It was bangin'.   The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because I wasn't impressed by their beer and wine selection.  However, I was satisfied with my beer choice (Pumking) and my friend loved her cocktail (the pear and ginger one).   Thanks. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Great food and drink. Will be back for more! Local draft, burgers are on point, and tapas to share if you don't want a full meal."}
{"text":"Pretty good food I would like to try more on the menu but had two hamburgers and the flavor was good I would recommend folks give it a whirl"}
{"text":"Everything was delicious. The service was fantastic. Miss Stephanie made the best recommendations from beer to food. The Guiness bread pudding was worth every calorie. Perfect way to end our first stay in NC. Thanks!!!!!"}
{"text":"I got the Pig and Fig sandwich. It sounded good on paper, but there were so many strong flavors that I only made it through about a third of it. Actually had to go to the bathroom to spit the last bite out. Because we were there during the middle of the week, there were only about 10 people there, but at least 15 staff. We got asked about every 2 minutes if we were ok, which gets old. Staff was very nice though."}
{"text":"This place knows what they're doing when it comes to refreshing, new recipes and unique dishes. We had several items from the tapas menu and were not disappointed. The shrimp and grits had an amazing flavor, the pork belly and apple dish was flavorful and filling. A new favorite for me were the kalette's they served with the pork belly and apple. A hybrid of kale and brussel sprouts, this was a new flavor I haven't tried before, and I'll definitely go back for that again. We ended with the trout and sprouts, grilled to perfection. We've wanted to try the food here for a long time, and finally had the chance. Mike, our bartender/waiter, was friendly, courteous and knowledgeable of the menu being offered. The ambience is pleasant and comfortable. The drinks are top notch. They had my favorite brand of bourbon, which isn't carried in many places, so I was very happy. I look forward to going back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went last night and we definitely recommend checking this place out.  Great selection of small plates/tapas, as well as full entrees, and good beer/drink/wine list.  \"Gastropub\" type setting- similar to The Liberty but better in my opinion.   We started with the trout/Brussel sprout bacon and Moroccan pork skewer/grape/tzatziki tapas. The trout dish was excellent.  The elements of the pork dish were great, except that the pork must have been a loin cut and was kind of dry/tough.    We then ordered the dinner special which was beef short rib, corn puree, manchego/serrano grit cake and roasted tomatillos.  It was an excellent dish, very good flavor combinations and well-prepared/cooked.  Service was a bit slow.  The server popped by very quickly after we were seated, but we hadn't yet had a chance to look over the extensive beer/wine/drink offerings.  We asked for a couple minutes and it was probably over 10 minutes before she came back.  Once we ordered drinks, it took about 15 minutes to get them (can beers).   It is also a bit loud so if you are looking for a quiet place this is probably not going to suit your needs.  We sat on the bar at the front window, and seated right next to each other, we had difficulty hearing each other.  But on a busy Saturday night this is to be expected.    Nice restaurant and good food!  If you don't order many drinks you can easily get in and out of this place for around $50 for two people."}
{"text":"Great tapas and beer selection.  Cozy atmosphere.  The food is well balanced and full of flavor.  The sliders are the best in Charlotte hands down."}
{"text":"I must say, for being open only 10 days, they were jammin. We were greeted by a friendly hostess and immediately sat at a table.  Drinks were served with a smile in a timely manner. Nice selection or beer and wine.   As for the apps, We had the shrimp and beet special -amazing!  and the lamb stuffed mac n cheese - To die for!!    The sandwiches were plentiful and tasty. My fav though, roasted turkey sandwich with hand cut fries. Yum! A must have.   We can't wait to visit again. Look forward to Clayton's creativity."}
{"text":"First impressions were that it's a really cool space. Good seating area at the bar. Quick turnaround for tables. Great beer selection. Excited to have a new place in NODA to go to.   The good: the corn fritters are ridiculously delicious. Highly suggest them.   Great beer selection and good cocktails. So far so good right?  The bad: the Pig and Fig was good, but entirely too much bread. And the bread was overly hard. Lots of bread. If you like bread, this is the sandwich for you.   Server was really slow and semi aloof. Missed a whole round of beers we ordered. Kitchen times were relatively slow. So slow that we had to ask if our food had been put in.   They've been open for just a little so I think things will get better. Really like the spot and again...it's nice to have cool new options. Plus they play great music. Give it a shot."}
{"text":"We saw the reviews and yelpers did not steer us wrong.  We started with the corn and jalapeño fritters which were just spicy enough and crispy on outside and nice and soft in center.  For dinner we both went with the burgers.  Perfectly cooked.  At a true med rare.  Drinks were well made.  Atmosphere fun and great staff.  A great choice for dinner."}
{"text":"I think this place is a great addition to the neighborhood. I've been here a couple times now and both times had items off of the appetizer menu and a few drinks. Others in my party ordered the burgers and they look very filling and tasty! The lamb mac and cheese is pretty delicious, the pork skewers are good if you're looking for something light, and the corn and jalapeno fritters are exactly what you would expect. I've also ordered a side salad that had a nice house made buttermilk dressing. It was fine but I would like to see more that a few croutons thrown on some greens.   A nice beer menu with a lot of local choices. If you're doing wine, just do the bottle, much cheaper!"}
{"text":"I have lived in NODA for some time and was very excited about there being a new place to eat. The overall atmosphere was ok better than it was. But the food was not good and way over priced. Pork belly sandwich served open and stacked so high its falling off plate and impossible to eat. There was way too much bread and the flavor of the meats was just off.. Salad with house dressing was overwhelming and inedible. The pretty fried balls were undercooked and bland..tasting like fried cram cheese. I sent a full plate of food back and had no one ask what was wrong the owner or manager did not come over. Out of  respect for the fact I ate some and that I did not want to make a scene...I paid and left... but won't be returning.  It left my stomach unsettled and I had to grab some fast food on the way home because I ate so little"}
{"text":"There is a lot of potential and great ideas but the prize should be in the details. Lamb lollipops had no seasoning and I agree with no to little seasoning if the cut is great, which this was not. Pork belly sliders, first 2 bites great! Then I got nothing but weird tasting fat the rest of the slider. Consistency should be key. Dinner, steak sandwich, dear heavens lay off the horseradish, I'm not eating seafood. All my opinions, cool place, wait staff not the best, but good beer!"}
{"text":"Went for an early dinner on a Sunday. Parking lot is (unsurprisingly) tiny.  Service was awesome. Our server was nice, quick with refills, and easily answered questions about the menu.  We ordered the deviled eggs, lamb mac and cheese, pork belly sliders, and a cheese plate. Husband's fav thing was the lamb mac and cheese, which he raved over. I thought it was very tasty, but lighter than I'd prefer on the lamb. My fav were the sliders, which had nice and crispy pork belly and a thick slab of well-seasoned fried green tomato. I could probably eat a plate of them by myself! Yum! Other highlights were the candied bacon on the deviled eggs and the five spice pickles on the cheese plate. Portions were generous tapas size (so, for example, two large sliders on the slider dish).  I also ordered two cocktails from the bar, which were well made and boozy, but also overpriced at $12.50 per.  We aren't in Charlotte too often, but we'd definitely come back!"}
{"text":"A wonderful new addition to NODA! Service is great, food is amazing. The beer taps are changed frequently which we love! If you decide to go, start with the meats and cheese plate or jalapeño fritters :)"}
{"text":"We ordered the lamb lollipop, trout, scallops and mussels. Everything was great with the exception of the mussels which was disappointing. We did tell the server and we got a sorry versus a new one. It was super bitter and the sauce was not good. Other than that the atmosphere was great though!"}
{"text":"Cool place. Candied bacon deviled eggs, steak sandwich with cranberry sauce, and habanero mango cider. Some crazy flavors but pleasantly surprised. Their french fries are seasoned to perfection!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice just for drinks. Service was friendly, the drinks were good and priced appropriately. Sat outside on the patio one time and it was great!"}
{"text":"I was in last night with some friends and these guys are running the hidden jewel of NoDa, our server was on point with everything that we needed and the food was out of this world amazing. I almost felt like I wasn't in Charlotte anymore, this reminded me of a great gastropub that I used to frequent in my old neighborhood in London. Cheers fellows!"}
{"text":"Incredible food and beer selection. Great outdoor deck area as well. The steak sandwich and Davidson's Burger were both well cooked and delicious. Very adequate portion size.  If you're a beer drinker, this is a great spot. Make sure to check out IPA Saturday, where all of their draft IPAs are discounted to $3.50."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is cool, dim lighting.. Good place to get a drink and chat, or just vibe to the music. There was a DJ. Playing all types of music. Seems like each night there's a special. Tonight was IPA $4. Instead j had a cider :).   Salad on the menu sound good - I would want to go back and try the Farmhouse salad."}
{"text":"We have had Davidson Street Public House on our restuarant bucket list ever since they first opened up. My husband, father in law, and myself came here for dinner this past Friday night.   It is located right next to the Fire Station in Noda. As such, parking is difficult....however, we always find street parking somewhere. Also, no wait on a Friday night...score!  Friday's drink special was $4 for all craft cans. Since Noda's cans are 16 oz, this is a double score! My father in law and I got a Pumpkin Beer and my husband got Nodas Coco Loco. They had a very nice beer list!  We decided to just split a bunch of stuff and got the black bean hummus, the pork belly sliders (we requested 3 but the typically order comes with 2), the lamb mac and cheese, and the trout and sprouts. The black bean hummus was absolutely delicious. It came with garlic bread and pita chips. The sliders were perfect sized and really well cooked. A winner. The lamb mac and cheese was as amazing as it sounds. Pasta and melted cheese is always a winning combo in my books and the lamb chunks just added such a great flavor! The only miss was the trout and sprouts. The trout was fairly bland and the sprouts were not seasoned nor cooked long enough for my taste!  Overall it was a great expereince. Great service too! We will defintiely be back."}
{"text":"The food was great and the service excellent. Def will be back soon. Wife and daughter loved it."}
{"text":"Went for the first time on Friday night by a recommendation of a friend. We were seated at the bar immediatly. Staff was friendly and knowledgeable about the menu.  We ordered.the meatball Tapa and pork belly sliders. They had unusual flavors and both were very good. I wanted to try the crabmeat tapa, but we will save it for a our next visit."}
{"text":"Good prices, excellent drink choices and friendly atmosphere. It's not too loud, so my wife & I were able to enjoy some drinks and conversation while watching the game! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Met an out of town friend here who was passing through for the night. The service was very attentive, a really nice selection of beers, many of them local, and an interesting and creative menu. We made a few selections-the deviled eggs and pork belly sliders were my favorites. The only complaint was that at 9PM on a Friday the tunes were so loud that conversation was almost impossible. Since the main reason for being out was to visit as we only see each other 1-2 times a year we left quickly after our meal to find somewhere quieter for more drinks."}
{"text":"I have been here many times and forget to follow up with a review. Outstanding all around, upscale food, great drink, tap menu and attentive staff. There is not many other restaurants with this kind of creative and delicious cuisine. It is always a comforting experience. Outside of the great draft list,  the fresh ingredient and unique cocktails, are worth the wait. Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"No understanding of customer service. My friend made the mistake of making a reservation here for her birthday. When we arrived on time, they told us our table wasn't ready yet, even though numerous other tables had \"Reserved\" signs on them.  We waited 40 minutes and watched ever other party who made a reservation be seated before we were. I've worked in the restaurant industry, and I understand that you're at the mercy of the current patrons, but this was just absurd. They bought her 1 cocktail, where at the least our meal should have been comped due to their bait and switch (we were a party of 3, so this is a reasonable measure).  Instead of making my friend feel valued on her birthday, they left her powerless and showed her that she didn't matter as a customer. I will never come back here and warn friends against relying on a reservation at this establishment in the future."}
{"text":"Love this place!  The pork belly sliders melt in your mouth and the charcuterie plate has some wonderful choices.  Food is wonderful, never had a bad meal and they always have drink specials."}
{"text":"The service in this place is absolutely horrendous. Avoid Kelly the bartender at all costs!! She recommended a draft beer that my girlfriend hated.  She actually said that we needed to pay for it!!! I've never been to a bar that does this. She ruined our entire experience here. Her attitude is absolutely the worst and I'm surprised that this place would allow her to interact with the public."}
{"text":"Nothing memorable, other than the live music.  The kitchen closed at 10 sharp, so I wasnt able to try any food.  Maybe keeping the food available til 11 would bring more $$, as I'd have spent it to eat and so would othersat tje table.  I had to wait a while for drink service and the waitress seemed put out on having to get me a drink. I was there till 12 and never had anyone even ask me if i wanted another drink.    Not likely to return or recommend unless my friends are performing as it was otherwise very underwhelming."}
{"text":"Dear Lord...when I die please bury me in a vat of the Lamb mac n' cheese. Stopped in hungry and weary after Christmas shopping in NODA. Great, friendly service and fun atmosphere. Rest of the menu looks great. I'll be back..."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to grab a drink and watch. Game. Their bartenders are fantastic. They never make drinks too sweet. Order a Pisco sour you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"I literally just left this place a few minutes ago & could not wait to write this review. I am so irritated right now but I'm so thankful I had a Groupon.  First of all, how do you give someone 3 deviled eggs & charge them $5?? A WHOLE dozen  of eggs is about $2! Well for $5 they better be the best deviled eggs ever. Well, they were not. In fact, I hated them. They had no flavor & needed some salt. Blah!  We ordered the pub platter which comes with sausage, cheese, mustard, Apple sauce (?), red onions & 2 slices of bread. The thing Is, they Slice the sausage in such a way that you cut off small circular pieces. Why even do that & then give me bread?? Or at least cut the bread so you can make little sausage sandwiches or something  (scratches head). I just don't get that. So what ends up happening is you end up using up all the bread & having stuff left , when it's really not enough food that warrants needing to order more bread. We ended up ordering more bread anyway. I asked for a slice & she had the nerve to say it would be $1. For 1 SLICE of bread. She made sure to say more foccacia? Like, because it's foccacia one slice is worth a dollar. SMDH  So you may be thinking I'm just being cheap perhaps? Or that I don't understand the concept of tapas. Well, I am from NEW YORK. #nuffsaid #movingon  We also ordered the bruschetta. It was gross. Especially after the mustard flavor from the sausage was still in my mouth. There was way too much going on & the combination of flavors just didn't do It for me.   The Groupon was good for $20. My friend ordered a $4 beer also so after the Groupon discount it was $14+. I really feel like we were ripped off. The food was not that good & way over priced. Go to dish & get free deviled eggs or go anywhere else & get free bread."}
{"text":"Fantastic food. Fantastic service. Fantastic atmosphere. Fantastic live music. Servers were friendly too! We had braised short ribs that were great and a portobello sandwich that was fantastic!!"}
{"text":"I have waited to try this tapas place for over a year! Thankfully they lived up to the expectations and dazzled my tastebuds! We tried sharing the jalapeno bacon deviled eggs starter--they were delicious but I had a problem with the fact they gave us 3 egg halves. (Why not give the other half of the egg if there are two people?) Granted it's minor points but still odd. On to the tapas plates-- we loved the pork belly sliders, with fried green tomatoes and pimento cheese. Delicious umami combination of flavors!  We also shared the trout with panzanella salad. And we found out the panzanella is day old bread but they used cornbread which was a good texture with the trout. The salad dressing of lemon honey was a brilliant touch. We sat on the back patio which was pleasant in the sun. Good beer selection too and thanks to Monique for helping us find the best ones!"}
{"text":"The food is very good. Try a spread and the corn fritters. Also good beer specials. Great music played too.   The only thing i could criticize is the Brussel sprouts.  They were a little under done.   Definitely try it!"}
{"text":"Cool little spot with friendly service right in the heart of NoDa.  I was killing some time before heading to a concert and felt the need for some drinks.  Since I was solo and there was a cute smiling face behind the bar, I went belly up instead of getting a table.  This place has a solid beer selection, kind of surprised I hadn't stumbled in here sooner.  I started out with Troeg's mango and worked my way into an Anderson Valley IPA.  After my 2nd beer my lovely bartender convinced me to try a new cocktail she was working on.  Wow. Delicious.  Not quite sure what all was going on there besides some whiskey, but I could have easily put back a few of those if I had more time.  The foam on top was a nice touch.  At that point the people next to me received their food and everything looked amazing.  brussel sporuts, trout and sprouts, and all kinds of cheeses and charcuterie.  I regretted not getting a bite while there, but that just gives me a reason to head back soon!"}
{"text":"Very solid spot.  Only downside would be $/portions ratio (primarily a tapas menu).  You end up throwing down some change if you want to feel full (and that's coming from someone w/ a light appetite)."}
{"text":"It's a small spot so you may have to wait, but the food is better than average. I'd rate it between a 3.5 and a 4. The menu is very expansive and food is good across the board. We came with a group of 8 on a Saturday so had to wait a little bit to be seated (as expected), but there's plenty to drink and check out in the meantime.   I love their open floorplan, beamed ceilings and wooden architecture. They have beer specials and specials on tap also. I was so excited to finally eat here, having had it on my list for a while. A bunch of us split various plates, so we got to try a little bit of everything. I would have liked to try more starters, so that's on the list for next time. We did order the corn and jalapeno fritters, which are stuffed with cream cheese. However, to me, they left something to be desired. I didn't taste much corn or jalapeno flavoring. They seemed mostly like fried cream cheese balls. I think they are a great thought, but need a little touch up.  We really enjoyed the lamb mac n cheese, which comes served in a mini skillet. It is the ultimate comfort dish full of cheesy pasta shells and tender chunks of lamb. That was a hit around the table - wish the dish was larger! I also enjoyed the Davidson Burger - I have a weak spot for burgers with pimento cheese and I really enjoyed this one. We also tried the scallops, which tasted a little salty and flavorless.   Otherwise, we enjoyed ourselves! Service was good, and the variety of beers available is appealing."}
{"text":"Just had brunch, phenomenal!!! Can not praise the chef high enough. The crab stuffed trout, is a new favorite in the city."}
{"text":"Previously tried the pork belly sliders and they were everything I hoped they could be.  Tap selection is OK, could be improved with more seasonals.  I'd like to see more stouts and porters...hopefully.  This visit I tried two fall cocktails - 36th & Davidson is a bourbon based Old Fashioned and was quite nice.  The very large ice cube also had a cherry and lemon or orange slice frozen into it.  Turns out the ice was mostly flavored instead of plain water as well.  Pretty awesome.  I took the very attentive bartender up on her suggestion and also tried an apple blossom.  A very seasonal drink featuring a large piece of Rosemary that gets set on fire.  Wow, what a great drink, can't wait to go back for another.  Good ambiance, typically crowded so a little loud.   Local one man band musician was playing and doing a fine job.  I think they've done a terrific job on the menu and drink menus, but as a beer snob I'm hoping they will feature more local brews and a more varied selection of styles."}
{"text":"Good food and beer. Small plate menu is nice. It's basically tasting versions of \"entree\" type items which is awesome. Gives you the opportunity to try multiple \"entrees\""}
{"text":"Great spot for charcuterie. They do a small menu brunch on Sundays as well. Good drinks all around from old fashions, bloody Mary's, and craft beers. Small outside seating and a few large TVs to watch whatever game may be on."}
{"text":"Went there for drinks after dinner. Excellent selection of local craft beers. I had a delicious Manhattan with a Virginia bourbon. It was a slightly sweeter Manhattan.  Great atmosphere with a local duo performing."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this visit to Davidson Street Public House. Food is excellent. I really enjoy the elevated style of home cooked items. Pork Belly Sliders blended really well with each layer. Corn Fritters I expected more heat but appreciated that the flavor of jalapeños popped as opposed to too much heat. Great cocktail menu. PROFESSIONAL service leaning toward consistent customer acknowledgment anticipating my needs.  Great job to this fantastic crew."}
{"text":"Stop #1 on the Trolley Pub, Davidson Street Public House. This review is for drinks and service only since our time here was limited. I think that they had awesome beer, wine and cocktail selections. Once I saw that they had Red Clay Cherry Bobbin' Trolls on tap, I was sold since I freaking love this cider! Judging from the reviews it looks like this place has some really good food, can't wait to try it out!"}
{"text":"Starving and little tipsy. This place is perfect to handle my needs.   Customer service: 5/5 greeted my our waiter right away.. charming and great the whole time..   Space: 5/5.. not sure why they called it the Public House but it's very laid back cozy little place to just hang out if you want too..   Food: 5/5 love their mojitos.. very refreshing.. just the right amount of alcohol but I can still taste the mint and the simple syrup.  The catfish bites was great.. crunch with the cornmeal outing., the sauce is spicy for me but I don't do spicy so I can't knock them for it. It is a good sauce tho..   The steak sandwich with the salad over balsamic dressing.. All of this pairing was right for each other. The greasy/cheesy soak up my buzz. The steak was nicely done. I would request the bun to be lightly toasted. That would be heaven. Then the salad just make me feel like I add a little healthiness to my meal after all the bad things I have stuff into my body. The balsamic was light. Paired with the house salad nicely. Would love to come back and try their house fries. I heard it's the best!!"}
{"text":"Love this place so damn much. They fail short of a perfect 5/5 on some dishes not meeting the mark, but they certainly shine with their food and craft cocktails. I have been a patron here for 2 years now and it's one of my go-to spots if I have a friend in town.   One thing that can be really annoying is the live music. This place is fairly small and when you introduce an american idol wannabe trying WAY too hard with his acoustic guitar, it can be a quick way to loose your buzz. The management and staff are all great. Service is always on point.   They need to redo the pork belly sliders. It's way too much going on and super heavy. Definitely try the braised oxtail.   Solid 4/5 for consistently being consistent."}
{"text":"Bartender was fantastic. Gave us great recommendations in where to go in the Charlotte area. Beer was great served in a clean environment. Will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"There's potential here but it isn't quite up to par. It's cute, kind of hip with a focus on handmade cocktails and a tight menu of fresh food. But it was hit and miss.    My husband got one of their specialty cocktails that's basically an Old Fashioned and it was tasty. When we got the bill we saw it was $17. OUTRAGEOUS!  We shared a variety of small plates and a sandwich that ranged from amazing (the corn fritters) to not especially flavorful (steak sandwich) to not very good (lamb empanada).   I hope they keep trying on the food and get prices down to earth on the drinks."}
{"text":"The absolutely only negative thing is that they are closed on Mondays! They have fabulous food! I love the charcuterie, they brought us one of the wrong cheese and fixed it for us right away. Theu change up the cheese and meat options often. I had fried green tomatoes that were to die for!"}
{"text":"Service was not good at all... deviled eggs were the most dull flavorless things I've had.. I will say that the fritters I had were heaven though so thank goodness for them!! Those I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The last time I ate in this spot it was a Korean restaurant - so yeah, its been awhile. I was used to pretty high restaurant turnover and didn't have high expectations.  I was right away impressed with their sour beer selection - both on tap and in the bottle. They even had the just released sour from Wooden Robot.  We sampled a few small plates while we sipped our drinks at the bar. They have pretty good weekday specials so a good spot to hit mid-week.  The pastrami meatballs were dope- comforting but not too heavy. The sardine had millions of tiny bones- I know sardines are boney but I wish we had been given a heads up when we ordered and I may have chosen something else.  They're doing good stuff in Noda - I can't wait to visit again."}
{"text":"Second time here. Food has been fabulous both times!  Had some tapas plates, and large plates tonight. Atmosphere is very warming and service is friendly and prompt. Had Jordan H as a server. Only his third night, did a great job!  Manager checked on us too, all around great experience. Glad to have this place in our neighborhood of Noda!"}
{"text":"We tried this place pretty soon after it opened but went at an odd time to avoid the crowds and hopefully get in and out without it taking forever. When we arrived, it took entirely too long for someone to seat us. We had two different people approach us and still waited about 10 minutes to be seated even though only two tables had customers seated. The menu was small and there was only one veggie option, the portabella sandwich, so I ordered that. It was very good, but the portions were very small for the price we paid. We love to support local businesses but this unfortunately won't be in our normal rotation."}
{"text":"Pork Belly sliders were awesome. Bruchetta was also yummy and different, great flavors.   Rum Diary cocktail was fabulous.  You want a cocktail to taste like a cocktail!  Will go back again to try something else."}
{"text":"Well worth the visit. Food is exceptional. Sandwiches to tapas, everything is rich in flavor."}
{"text":"What are you waiting for?  Stop reading this and go there immediately!  Great food, great cocktails, and great beers are waiting for you.  Seriously this place is awesome.  My advice is next sunday get in your car, visit some Noda breweries and then stop here for lunch.  They have an amazing menu full of fun choices.  This is the best burger I have had in Charlotte, the reuben meatballs are tasty and fun, the korean short ribs are sensational, the cheeseballs are a must, the airline chicken is delicious!  The cocktails are top notch, the draft list always has something good on it, and the service is great.   There are lots of good choices in NODA, but this one is a must for me.  Even if i am just in the are for Smelly cat coffee (the best coffee in town) I hear this place calling my name!  I love to see places are that are doing everything right be so successful!"}
{"text":"Went here with a group on a Saturday before a concert at Neighborhood Theatre. DSPH replaces the much missed Miyagi's which closed without notice several months ago. The food is now gastropub-style while the atmosphere is not vastly different (furniture is exactly the same).  It was crazy in NoDa due to the concert but the staff at Davidson St. took our name and phone # which let us hit up a less crowded bar while we waited for our table. When we returned, we were quckly seated by our peppy server/hostess.   Drinks were promptly brought out and selection was excellent. The only thing missing though were the prices - for all beer and wine. Good menu was pretty limited and focused on sandwiches, salads and small plates. Our server took our order which included a meat/cheese plate appetizer.   After waiting about 30 minutes, we received our food. The meat/cheese plate came out with the entrees. Fail.   The food was generally very good with the only complaint being an extremely tough and fatty piece of pork belly. The server graciously comped the pork belly sandwich entree and the meat/cheese appetizer (which went untouched) after one person in our group brought it up to the server.   Prices overall were a littler higher than other pubs on N. Davidson, but not too out of line. Overall, would definitely give Davidson St. another try. Hopefully they can work out the kinks during this soft opening, though I'm still kind of itching for Miyagi's to return. :-)"}
{"text":"Food was amazing here.  Staff was friendly.  Unfortunately went to go in for dinner tonight and they closed up shop overnight.  Really sad to see."}
{"text":"We were out for dinner and ordered tapas/drinks. Over an hour and a half later, we still did not have our food. Our waiter, Ray, checked on the food, only to be cursed out by the manager (we witnessed the interaction). Extremely unprofessional. The manager has not approached our table. Very disappointed.   Update: We eventually received our food, two hours after arriving. The restaurant apologized and gave us our meal-  we appreciated the gesture. I was unimpressed with my food and the entire ordeal was unsettling, so I still stand with my original rating."}
{"text":"I love DPSH! This restaurant is an awesome addition to NoDa. Although a smaller spot, it has a great outdoor space. I love the live music in the warmer weather. We started with the meat and cheese platter. The Atticus Finch cocktail....unbelievable. So many flavors with every sip! After a cocktail we switched to wine since bottles will half off. What a deal! The restaurant has a great variety of beers, unique cocktails, and wine. Add specials on top of it and I'm sold! Everything from the simple meat/cheese platters to jalapeño bacon deviled eggs has unique flavors to make your tastebuds sing. The service has always been friendly. The only reason I gave four out of five stars is because although it has the perfect vibe for a larger group, space doesn't allow it to be so!"}
{"text":"AMAZING food and service. Relaxing but fun atmosphere and perfect for date night or fun catching up w friends"}
{"text":"We came here on a Wednesday evening. I had been looking at Yelp pictures and reviews of the food for quite a while and was very excited to finally try it out. We weren't able to stick around for the live jazz band later that night, but I was very impressed with what we ordered.    It took me a while to decide on what to order because there were so many things I wanted to try. I ended up picking something last minute as the bartender was in front of me. I got the short rib with au jus gravy on top of a sweet potato gratin as well as the fried corn and jalapeño fritters. The combination of flavors on the short rib plate was incredible. The gravy was perfect and the potatoes a great texture and flavor to include with every bite. The fritters were very tasty as well. They were crunchy on the outside with a creamy inside and a deliciously sweet tomato jam to spread on top.  I can't wait to return to try a few more new items. I'm really looking forward to the deviled eggs, pork belly sliders, and lamb lollipops. They have events each night of the week. We're going to go back for trivia next Tuesday."}
{"text":"We were super excited that a new spot was opening up in NoDa after the sushi place that used to occupy the property closed down.  It's a really great building in a prime location in the heart of the neighborhood, and it has an added bonus of having its own parking lot in an area where parking is a major hassle.    Since it opened, I've been here on multiple occasions for drinks or food or both.  I've gotten something different each time.  My favorite thing so far is the PB BLT which is an open-faced pork belly situation with fried green tomatoes, bacon, and pimiento cheese.  It is a major undertaking to indulge in this bad boy, but it's damn good!  They also have a really good burger, the Grindhouse.  The fries are money as well.  Most of the other things I've tried have been pretty good although I was not a big fan of the Pig and Fig (lots of bread, not a lot in-between) or the Moroccan Pork Skewers (fine but not great).    There is a nice beer selection with an emphasis on NC crafts and a pretty interesting cocktail list as well.  Every time I go in, there is something different on tap.    This is ultimately a really good spot and much needed addition to the food scene in NoDa.  I'd like to see the menu expand a bit as they settle into their groove.  We'll keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Wanted to take my sister who is L.A. to the bone, to a place that is hip and cool. Ended up in NODA and she chose Davidson Street Public House. I will absolutely return. Tip - order the scallops but ask for five instead of the three that come with the appetizer size. Also, the Brussels sprouts are the best I've ever had. Amazing. I would pass on the deviled eggs but I don't eat bacon so that mY be a part of the problem. Enjoy! It is"}
{"text":"Davidson's Burger. Whoa. This is a 5-star food review and a 2-star service review. I think it was a Saturday late afternoon when I came through the the lady. We were definitely getting beverages, but we weren't positive on the food consumption front. Boy am I glad we decided to go for it!  Definitely one of the better burgers I have had in Charlotte. Copying and pasting off the menu here to allow for maximum appreciation. The Davidson's Burger comes with Chef's Pimento Cheese, Bacon, Sweet Mountain Relish, Mixed Greens, Red Pepper Aioli, Brioche Bun. **Head exploding noise** The pimento cheese was great, the red pepper aioli was just spicy enough, the bacon was... bacon! The house cut fries were good (and frequently poached by my fiancee).   On to the service piece... We sat at the bar, The Masters was on, it was not terribly busy, but not slow either. Our bartender/server could not have had less personality. She legitimately looked like she did not want to be there at all! She took our orders and answered our questions with all the personality of a groggy sloth. Then she came back because she forgot our drink orders. Timeliness with everything was not bad. I'm not always the happiest person to be at work, but I feel like to shouldn't be conveying that to customers.   May not return for drinks, but would certainly return to try some more food options."}
{"text":"Went last night for dinner and drinks and loved every bit. It was quite crowded when we got in as two larger groups were there and the place is a little small but we were still able to grab a table for 4. The hostess was very nice and our waitress friendly and attentive. There's a good selection of different beers on tap and a cocktail menu with some fun choices. We started with the Pork Belly Sliders which were absolutely delicious!! I'd highly reccomend. I ordered the Pig & Fig sandwich which was very sweet but still very good. I'd order again. My husband got the Grindhouse Burger and said it was OK and pretty salty. Friends got the Portobello Caprese and Steak Sandwich and bith liked thiers. The fries are good too.  It was really loud inside with the music and being such a small area but once the crowd cleared out a little we could conversate without yelling. Overall a great experience and will definitely return."}
{"text":"We had tried every other Noda restaurant so decided to give this one a whirl.  I'll make this short and sweet, get the Fried Green Tomatoes with Crab Salad.  We also got the lamp popsicles, lamb confit, pork belly sliders, and wings. All good, but wishing they were the crab salad."}
{"text":"Super cool bar/restaurant ... Brand new with a cool old style neighborhood bar.  Great beers on tap!!! Very cold beers!!! Great weight staff!!! Get the meat cheese plate!!! Or corn and jalapeño fritters!!!"}
{"text":"We were in Charlotte for the evening and when the restaurant that was recommended to us was packed, we somehow ended up here (mostly because of the positive Yelp reviews).  The food was hot and the service was fairly attentive (at least at first).  We ordered the lamb mac and cheese, and split the burger with fries.  The mac and cheese was like watery Velveeta shells and cheese with meatballs here and there and maybe a spring of dries rosemary tossed in.  It was edible bar food that may be the best thing ever after a few drinks, but was subpar otherwise.  The burger was alright.  Tasty, like a step up from a Wendy's bacon burger.  The bun was the best part.  I almost forgot that there was a hair (a long one) in my burger.  That kind of thing doesn't really bother me, so I didn't say anything...but...if that's not your thing, watch out.  The fries were not as good as their fast food kin.  They were so drenched in oil that some were nearly orange translucent crisps.  As I mentioned, the service started out strong, but when we were ready to go, she seemed to vanish.  I was holding our credit cards at first, trying not to seem too obvious; then I resorted to placing them openly on the table where they sat for about 15 minutes before she noticed us.  I would only go back to this place if every other restaurant was closed.  Okay, so I'd never go back but the food was warm and I was hungry so it gets two stars."}
{"text":"Best restaurant I've been to since coming back from NYC. If you like seafood, get the scallops entree -- they were perfectly seared, buttery, and melted in your mouth. Strawberry cheesecake-filled bread pudding was a nice, not-too-sweet way to bring the meal to a close. Good beer/cocktail selection. Excellent service. Will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Such a surprise!! I never even heard of this place but after the wait for Cabo down the street was too long we decided to pop in this joint and hope for the best.  The place seemed like it wasn't poppin' at first at 8pm, and when we entered no one was there to greet us (no host area), so we were awkwardly waiting around and just sat ourselves.  Once we were noticed though, our server was super accommodating and helpful.  We ordered the Oxtail Tapa to start and it was superb.  V tender, juicy, flavorful.  10/10 would eat again.  Around this time the place started to come to life with more people coming in and some live jazz music!  All previous doubts subsiding.  For my entree I got the moroccan pork skewers which were SO tasty with the yogurt sauce and pita.   I didn't care much for the curried sweet potato hash however - the spices were confusing to the palate.    I'm feeling #blessed that fate brought me here and can't wait to come back to try more"}
{"text":"This new addition to NoDa is absolutely fantastic! The food is fresh and delicious, the staff is really nice and friendly and the atmosphere is very warm and welcoming.  The beer list includes really fantastic descriptions and the wine prices are very reasonable. I'll definitely be back, soon."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner and was amazed at how unique and delicious their food is! I'm pretty hard to impress but everything from the presentation to the last mouthful was utterly perfect. Friendly staff, cool atmosphere, great selection... it just doesn't get better!"}
{"text":"Planning on a date night at The Evening Muse, we were deciding where to have dinner beforehand! A friend recommended Davidson Street Public House!   It was a beautiful evening so we decided to sit on the open patio. We started off with beer and wine, while we perused the menu. I had read in previous reviews the corn and jalapeno fritters were a must so we had that on our list. We decided just to share a few tapas, so we ordered the trout and mustard glazed brussels sprouts and my husband got the pork belly sliders. Next time I want to order the crab Neapolitan! So many dishes sounded so good I can't wait to go back!   The fritters were amazing and I could've eaten an entire plate full! Those are a must! The trout and brussels sprouts were pretty good, although my husband and I decided we're not huge trout fans. My husband has just recently become a brussels sprouts fan (well I don't know if I would call him a \"fan\") but he will tolerate them, and he thought these were awesome! But the combination of flavors worked well together! (My preference would be another fish, maybe a tilapia.) My husband said the pork belly sliders were good but nothing amazing.  They had a menu of homemade funky drinks. I don't drink liquor often but they sounded so unique we each had to order one! I got Local #7 which was a new twist on a margarita! It had homemade jalapeno simple syrup and a salt and cayenne rim! It was delicious and would be great on a hot afternoon. Our waiter, Fen, was great and very attentive, he mentioned that they will be starting brunch this weekend so we can't wait to go try that! This is definitely a restaurant we will go to again!"}
{"text":"I was not very impressed with our visit here recently. To begin with, there were several open tables. One hostess tried to seat us, but another stopped her and said there was a wait. However, there were two names on the list and nobody being seated at the open tables. We were confused...  The meal I ordered was very good, but they brought my husband a burnt burger... Not overcooked, but black burnt. The manager took it off the tab and brought him a new one. However, I had to eat my meal so it wouldn't get cold. It didn't make for a very pleasant meal together.  With small, overpriced cocktails, the burnt burger, and disorganized staff, we probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Much to like here.  Great beer and cocktail selection.  Everything we tried on the menu was delicious, but most recommended is the mussels and the brussel sprouts.  The mussels are loaded with veggies (fennel, peppers, onions) and are truly the best you will find.  The Brussels are in a honey mustard glaze with great bacon."}
{"text":"Had a great dinner here last night before a show at The Evening Muse! So many bars have the same mediocre menus while this place was a cut above. Very interesting menu & food was fantastic! It was obvious there was a chef in the kitchen rather than someone manning the microwave."}
{"text":"Wow this place is yum!!!!! I stopped in last night for an early dinner. I had the PBT which was amazing. There was a peppery flavor to the sandwich that mixed perfectly with the pork and aioli. I could have ate 10 of those! I also had the bruschetta which was very good. I consider myself a bruschetta snob. I liked the cheese on top of the bruschetta and the little zing from the balsamic. I also tried the Misery & Gin drink. Wow that was good. I can't wait to go here again."}
{"text":"We decided to leave the burbs for a night in NODA and are so happy we ended up here!  Nice date night ambiance, but plenty of groups too!  We decided to eat at the bar, and had some friends meet us after dinner.  Meagan was an awesome bartender and helped us pick between meals as well as specialty cocktails.  There was music playing by a one man band you can say, but he kept it quiet enough so we could still chat.  The food.... Definitely something different!  Not your run of the mill bar food, but not so crazy that you need it all explained.  We started with the corn fritters (yum) and then bad the Davidson burger and the Mussels for our main courses.  My husband raved about the burger- it was tasty and a large size.  I had the mussels- definitely different- in a creamy sauce versus a broth with some veggies mixed in.  The bread to dip was delicious too!  We would love to come back another time!"}
{"text":"I like the food, but I think overall this restaurant is overpriced for the neighborhood. There are only 2 small plate options less than $10.  Noda cans are $6. Wine is $8.50, liquor is more.  However, the food is good (I've had a burger, Mac n cheese, and fried green tomatoes with crab). No complaints, I just can't afford to patron the restaurant frequently."}
{"text":"So amazing! I love the atmosphere, the beer selection, and the food! Everything we ordered was unique and tasty."}
{"text":"Dinner is pretty decent.  The hours of operation this business holds are beyond ridiculous though.  What a great location to day drink in NoDa!  Unfortunately, no one will ever know because the place is trying to be too trendy to be open during the day.  I have to assume this foolhardy practice will be the doom of this business (just like every other business in this location).  Invest some money and operate during the daytime, at least on weekends.  Otherwise poor managerial decisions will likely sink this place by winter......   UPDATED... How could you not be open on Saturday?  Oh wait, you're closed for good.  Looks like my reviews are on point!"}
{"text":"Their burgers are everything- boyfriend and I split the Davidson and the Grindhouse. I will be dreaming about the Grindhouse- he preferred the Davidson. Good selection of all brewery drafts, with traditional beers in bottles. Ingredients were amazingly fresh, staff was super friendly, setting was attractive - I will be back!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite place to get tapas/small plates in Charlotte. Their drink menu is also top notch.  4/5 stars because I was not a big fan of their larger fare entrees.  The steak sandwich seemed to be missing the steak. And the chicken entree seemed to be over cooked with undercooked Brussels sprouts on the side. I will definitely return for the drinks and tapas (have had about every one of the tapas on the menu now). But will likely not order a larger fare again."}
{"text":"Best food in NoDa. Great craft beer selection and cocktails. Stephanie gave us fantastic service. Was very impressed and we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I had the opportunity to visit Davidson Street Public House on two separate occasions.  My first foray was when my wife brought me to NODA for the first time to checkout the food, shops, and various beer-style joints.  This was an afternoon visit and they weren't all that crowded.    Since we were mainly there to try the craft beer we headed to the bar area and plopped down center-stage.  Their bar is a nice setup with TVs up above and a long bar area leading right into the kitchen on the right.  Makes it easy for the bartender to move quickly between the bar, kitchen, and restaurant. Nicely laid out. In fact, most of the entire restaurant is nicely done.   We tried a few of their beers.  The bartenders were knowledgeable about beer; Even suggested another place for similar beer preferences.  While the selection wasn't bad, it's their food that really makes the impression.  We had their Corn and Jalapeño Fritters: Roasted Corn, Cream Cheese, Jalapeno, Relish. Yum.  We also tried the Pork Belly BLT: Pork Belly, Benton's Bacon, Fried Green Tomato, Chef's Pimento Cheese, Mixed Greens, Brioche.  Another resounding Yum.  Other items caught our attention, including the Portabella Caprese and the Grindhouse Burger. Patrons on either side of us ordered these and they looked not only amazing, but filling enough for 2 people.  Davidson Street is a nice little place.   It isn't too small, but when the tables are full it is a bit cozy.  They have great music playing and the bathrooms are kept clean.  I look forward to trying it out again.  It's located in the right place and has the right selection of food to keep me coming back for more."}
{"text":"After you've lived awhile and been to a few hundred bars, some of the décor can kind of blend together. At that point, what sets a place apart from the others are the quality of servers, quality of food and any special cocktails that are a \"draw\".  Our waitress was really, really good. Right away she pointed out the drink specials which were highlighted in yellow. CAVU and Ballast Point Sculpin were $3 a can. She kept it classy and brought glasses, then helped us narrow down our food choices.  Corn and Jalapeno Fritters = melty, yummy goodness - heavy and creamy with a nice contrast from the peppadew relish which added an acidic, sweet bite.  Moroccan Pork Skewers = grilled pork tenderloin pieces and grapes with pita and tzatziki. The flavor combo of savory and sweet were a hit again. The pork was a little dry but it was likely par or precooked then finished with the grapes (as grilled grapes will only take 3 minutes). It was still good enough to where I'd order it again.   As stop #3 on a Yelp food tour, we declined main courses. There was no judgment and actually suggestions for what to eat at our next stops. Again, keeping it classy!  Really great place for Tapas and drinks. The dinner menu looks pretty amazing and so do the Autumn Seasonal cocktails they're creating. Will be back for round two!!!"}
{"text":"They have a great wine list. The meat and cheese board is fantastic. The service is great as well. I want to go back for a full on meal and will update my post. All in all, definitely going baack."}
{"text":"We were in Charlotte and stopped in looking for a clean restroom and ended up with a wonderful meal.  We asked the server to tell the Chef to surprise us and surprise us he did! He started us with local NC Heirloom tomatoes with local NC Goat Cheese and a balsamic reduction, it was wonderful. We then had pork belly on top of drunken collards which in my opinion was the best course of the night, the pork was tender yet still had a wonderful bite and texture to it.  Then came out the small plates of lamb empanada, chicken skewers, pork belly sliders with these fantastic and possibly homemade cucumbers on it. For desert the chef sent out Jalapeno Sorbet which had a fantastic sweetness but finished with a little heat. A member of our party saw the lamb chops after we closed our tabs and were finishing our drinks and ordered that on top of the meal and it was a tender, well presented & delicious frenched New Zealand lamb. I have to say I was not expecting this level of cuisine in Charlotte, this was something I expect in Chicago and San Francisco so hats off to Chef Sanders.  I would also like to say that the service was beyond excellent and the patio was a great place to enjoy the meal and the neighborhood."}
{"text":"First time here. Staff is very friendly. Beer selection not too shabby. Didn't have the food but will be back to try"}
{"text":"Always a good time here. Great food, nice craft beer selection and service. One of the better spots in Charlotte to come have a drink and chill"}
{"text":"Loved, loved everything we ordered!!!  My husband and I ordered 4 small plates to share as a mid afternoon snack.  When we tried them, neither one of us wanted to share at that point.  The food was phenomenal and service on point!  The only drawback is the limited parking situation in that area of town.  But, don't let that stop you from venturing through the madness, you'll love it!"}
{"text":"I can't wait till company comes to visit from out of town because this is where I'm taking them. So proud to show off my wonderful city and the wonderful places like this one. Enough said."}
{"text":"This was my first time going here as I am from out of town. I'd have to say this was a great first time experience.   My pet peeve is the frequent lack of service seen at most places nowadays. That is not the case here. Our server was so attentive, it seems he knew when we took our last sip of beer or bite of food and he was there. It seems like a small thing, but good service goes a LONG way...  The food was good as well. I got the cheesesteak sandwich, and it was great. Awesome selection of craft brews as well. When we were there on Thursday evening, they had all drafts for $3.50! Can't beat that!  Nice place that I would definitely return to."}
{"text":"I liked the food here, flavor and portion wise.  We ordered about half of the appetizers on the menu and we ended up with a full to-go box leftover after four of us dined.  The plates came out in odd order with weird gaps and honestly the presentation made it awkward because the servers couldn't get the various plates on or off the table.  We also went through four rounds of drinks.  The cocktails on special were cheap, but not very good.  The pricier options were definitively better.    The two things I'm going to hate on here are the volume and the attitude of the server.  The place was loud.  Not like \"the music was loud because I'm old\" but I couldn't here anything there was so much different kind of noise going nonstop.  There was music but I mostly couldn't make out what it was.  There were people trying to have shouting conversations which was alternatively hilarious and awkward.  And the server misheard everything everyone said several times, but somehow didn't get into the habit of moving closer to the person ordering.  But that's not what bothered me about our server.  It was that he didn't seem to want to help us.  They were busy, but not busy enough for the attitude around talking about the menu, about allowing us to order more appetizers, about actually clearing plates when the table was too full to hold any more food (but we had ordered more food anyway), about getting additional rounds of drinks, or allowing me to give him my CC.  If the hostess wasn't standing right next to us and being helpful to keep herself busy, I probably would have been pissed.  So props to her for going above and beyond, helping to reign in our server, clear plates, and allowing me to pay.  I might be inclined to try this place for lunch sometime, but I'm going to pass on doing a weekend dinner."}
{"text":"Breezed in for dinner last Sunday night, not knowing what to expect... Will it be hipster? Is the food high-class fancy or bar comfort? Can I get away with wearing jeans and a t-shirt?... And left one happy customer! I imagine the \"scene\" here is a lot different on a Friday or Saturday night, but we enjoyed the quiet, almost empty restaurant on our Sunday evening visit.   We sat at the bar and chit-chatted with the friendly bartender while watching the game. Their beer selection is one of the best in Charlotte. I had a Sycamore beer (their Strawberry Saison) I haven't seen anywhere else in town!   Started with appetizers, sharing a charcuterie board and the trout & sprouts. The meat and cheese selection is spot on and we enjoyed everything we got. The sprouts were out of this world! I wish they served them as a stand alone app, without the trout. After all that, we shared the Davidson Burger. Have I mentioned lately how much I love it when restaurants actually spilt meals, serving half portions on 2-plates when sharing? I love it!! So, imagine how excited I was when I saw my plate with half a burger and tons of fries coming my way!  Moral of this story is, we'll be back and often."}
{"text":"My fiance and I just had dinner here and I was hugely disappointed.  I thought it would be great based on Yelp ratings but it was really quite expensive for mediocre food and exceptionally poor and untrained service.  The good: Great music, decent craft beer selection, NoDa location, private parking lot.  The bad: I believe it was our server's very first day as a server...ever.  No shadowing another server for training; however, just really bad service.  She was \"nice\" but didn't have a clue about being a server.  No knowledge of beers or menu in general.  She did not stop back by the table after food was served until we were finished with our meal.  If she had, I would have told her that the hamburger was overcooked as well done (medium well stated when ordering) and the dressing was on the salad (asked for it on the side.)  The french fries were hot but overcooked and a bit hard.  The salad was fine but for $11 I would have expected more than 15 kernels of corn and a single small goat cheese fritter.  The jalapeno balls were tasty but not consistent.  Some balls contained little jalapeno and lacked heat while others had much more jalapeno and were more flavorful.  The restaurant was rather humid which led to warm drinks.  When I asked the server, Stephanie, for a chilled glass, she went over to the bartender and then came back and stated that they didn't keep chilled glasses...what?  How can a bar not have chilled glasses?  Like I stated earlier, there are some problems.  She did go back to the bartender and relayed my irritation at this and returned to the table with an \"iced glass\" which was colder and allowed me to finish my cider.  So, while there is potential in this place, live music on Wed, etc. work is definitely needed for me to return.  The price for 3 craft beers, a hamburger, a salad without protein and a cheaper appetizer was $52 which seems excessive.  For example, it would have been about the same price at Bad Daddy's for appreciably better food, service and value."}
{"text":"One of our favorites for a great meat & cheese tray, craft beers and wine. Extensive menu and knowledgable friendly service."}
{"text":"Very good choice for anytime or pre- or post-show dinner or drinks in NoDa.  Food menu is a nice mix of small plates and larger entrees.  Influence seems to be farm-to-fork.  Meat-heavy menu which is completely fine with me.  It's a tailored menu and I like the variety on it.  Delicious flavors but not overwhelmed with choices.  I love the look and appreciate that it does look like a refined public-house."}
{"text":"Just a casual,cozy bar with good food and good service.  They just opened so I think they are still figuring things out- (they said the menu was not final yet). But what we had was good.  Fabulous burger (smokey and delicious), the fried green tomatoes and crab appetizer was good, skewers were fabulous, bread pudding- yum... great beer selection and clean cozy atmosphere.  Our waitress was really friendly and helpful. Loved it and will be back!"}
{"text":"The food and cocktails at this place are solid. We went here for a late Sunday brunch. We started with the corn and jalapeño fritters...I could've probably eaten 30 of these things. They were absolutely delicious. As for the food, I had a buttermilk chicken sandwich on a biscuit. The biscuit was very soft and flavorful. Fries were well-seasoned, too.   The drinks are innovative. This was my first Pisco sour, and I was a big fan. They also have an extensive beer menu.   The one bad spot here was the service. Our waiter was really nice, but service was slow. I think the most annoying part of this was the fact that my wife got her food about 10-15 minutes before I did. I encouraged her to eat so it wouldn't get cold, but there was also no salt on the table, and she had a hard time getting our server's attention.   Overall, the food is too good to pass up. We will visit again...but not if we are in a hurry."}
{"text":"I came here at the end of my evening at the suggestion of Delphine from Cabo Fish Taco. Exactly what I wanted. In a city and neighborhood of craft beers, this was a perfect cocktail spot. Kelly took care of me and Mike was great as well. I'm not sure of the methodology but I felt from Kelly as though I was a regular. The \"Davidson & 36th\" and \"New York Sour\" with Cabernet floater (whaaaaaa????) were both perfect. Super talented jazz trio behind me blended perfectly with the scene. Subtle enough to not drown me out  but good enough to make me stop and applaud at the end of every song. I don't know when I'll be in NODA again but I will most definitely return here."}
{"text":"Ever feel like trying something new just because you see a deal on Living Social????  Weellll this should be the newbie you pick.  Davidson Street is in the heart of NoDa.  It's a fancy pub.  Everything is clean, modern, and there are TVs for you to watch a game.  Thursday night is $4 draft beers.... that should be all you need to read to walk into this place    I ordered off the tapas menu.  I normally expect small portions, so i was pleasantly surprised when the food arrived.  I got the pork belly sliders, lollipop lamb chops, and Brussels.  I would get the pork belly sliders again they were amazing!  The lamb chops were cooked perfectly.  The Brussels are a good option if you have more than two people because the portion is HUGE and they are rich.  Our server Lindsey was the best waitress I've had in a long time."}
{"text":"Catch-up dinner with a friend on a Friday night. Very nice atmosphere here, was a little difficult to find where to park in the dark..but NoDa.   They have a build your own charcuterie board, which is always a go-to app for me. I agree with the other reviewers, the pita chips are unpleasantly salty-- and I like salt. Especially with the salty meats and cheeses. It seems like they rotate out the meat and cheese choices, cool.  Shared pork belly sliders and brussell sprouts with my friend. Both were amazing. I could have eaten bowl after bowl of the brussell sprouts. The pork belly sliders had a lot of flavors going on and they worked so well together.   Their Friday night drink special was interesting- $2 off of their large bottles of beer, which had a good selection to choose from. I went for the Wicked Weed Brettaberry, one of my favorites.   Service started great, and really fell off at the end. I think our server got a large party on the patio. We ended up having to wait over 15 minutes for checks after we were done eating.   Definitely want to go back and try a few more things on the menu!"}
{"text":"Pretty great food and very low key...just how I like it. Love the small plates options and for Charlotte, not a bad option for dinner at all. No bells and whistles inside, but go for the food options as decent drinks."}
{"text":"Previously gave this bar two stars for the ambience alone. I hadn't gone back in more than a year (because why would you?). Again, the drinks are weak and overpriced for the neighborhood in which it's located. This is a disaster for the otherwise fantastic bar strip in NoDa."}
{"text":"This was a great accidental find in Noda.  Fun atmosphere and at the same time really awesome food. Their lamb small plate was some of the best lamb Ive had outside of Ruth's Chris(ordered 2 during my visit).  Highly recommend if you are in Noda and looking for something new."}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorite noda spots! The small plates are incredible! Definitely try the jalapeño fritters!"}
{"text":"A neighbor of the NoDa community told me about this restaurant, so we thought we'd give it a try. We were pleasantly surprised by how great our experience was. We tried the corn and jalapeño fritters, which were stelllllar. The sweet and sour red pepper relish was delicious with the fritters. I had the pork belly BLT and my husband had a burger, both of which were more than ample in portions and equally delicious. The beer selection was very good and we had a few rounds. Our service was above average and our waitress was very prompt and polite. We have returned since this first visit and expect to continue patronizing this business. Nice work, DSPH!"}
{"text":"Holy smokes this place is awesome!   I can't figure out if it's an awesome restaurant with great cocktails and craft beer or if it's a cocktail bar with awesome food!!!   Either way you can't go wrong. Ask about some of their special cocktails... Things that you would never imagine!  And if you get the chance, sit at the bar and watch Kelly make them, it's art!!   The Davidson Street meat and cheese plate is definitely the appetizer to start with.   They have some awesome cheeses like the drunken goat, red dragon, manchigo, and meats like salami, chorizo, capicola!!    Awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Definitely a fan of this place! Let me start off saying that it's a bit pricey so I would come here if you are trying to treat yo' self.   I come here mainly for the tapas. Some of my favorites that I would recommend include:  1. LAMB LOLLIPOPS YES. They change their menu often though so what I have had might not be what you will have. 2. Dry rub wings 3. Pork belly sliders  I have gotten the crispy pork belly confit before and I was pretty disappointed. Also, the pork belly BLT was also just OK. The sandwich was huge and they just put the pork belly on top...I didn't even know how to eat it or even where to begin. Everything just ended up falling apart and it was definitely deconstructed. Other than that, come here at night, get some drinks and tapas, and you'll love this place as much as I do."}
{"text":"I have been here twice and both times the food was amazing, and the service was great. Yesterday my boyfriend and I sat at the bar and had a meat and cheese board, lamb lollipops, and the lamb empanada all of which was super delicious. The bar tender was awesome, and the atmosphere was great. We will definitely make this a more regular spot."}
{"text":"OMG!!!  I love this place.  I came here on a Friday night and got a seat at the bar right away.  I would normally give 5 stars because I LOVED the food, but the bartender/waiter was not so great.  He didn't really pay much attention to my girlfriend and I and I had to get up several times to ask other people for stuff (napkins, silverware...).  Ok, that part was annoying...but on to the food :)  I ordered the bruschetta and was absolutely amazed, love at first bite with it.  So good!!!  I almost ordered a second one, and could have easily eaten the entire thing.  I also got the deviled eggs with candied bacon on top!!!!!!!!!  SOOOOOOOOO good.  I was really impressed, if you can't tell.  The brussels were just ok.  The steak & potato soup was good, a huge portion for not a lot of money-PLUS.  Then for desert I got the blackberry bread pudding.  It had a coffee flavored ice cream with it-delicious.  My friend got the brass monkey to drink, and I had wine.  The monkey was strong, but it was good.  I really have been dreaming about the eggs and bruschetta.  I can't wait to get back and have them again.  I'll order two of each :)))))))))."}
{"text":"Delicious food, great drinks, and like everyone in NoDa, I liked it before it was cool."}
{"text":"I've been back 3 times since.  Again. ..bourbon drink, 36th Davidson is ridiculously awesome.   Lamb empanada was delicious.   Entrée special was great.  Fritters are great.  Sliders were very good.   Beer selection very nice.  Met the owner and he's a great guy....serving and bussing tables!  I'll be back many many more times!"}
{"text":"After searching and searching for the best bar to watch the game, I finally settled on this one.  Was a big fan of the NODA area when I lived in Charlotte.  Some of the spots are still there (Cabo's and Bourdreaux's), but this was new.  It has great reviews, so I said what the heck.  The menu looks like pretty good American fare, but I was in game mode, so bar food it was!  The dry rub wings were really good.  Nice size wings and very tasty rub.  They pour pretty good drinks.  Had a gluten free IPA that was pretty good.  The four roses whiskey on the rocks and in an old fashioned was nice as well.  The bartenders were pretty attentive and helpful as well.  Crowd was decent.  Nice mix.  Would visit again next time I'm in town.  I want to try some of their entrees."}
{"text":"Be not fooled because of the location in NoDa. They are cooking with gas here at DSPH and on par with many of Charlotte's top restaurants. I was expecting bar food quality and got top chef level cuisine. There is a legit chef in this restaurant and the food was surprisingly very good with unexpected flavor combinations.  I ordered the feature feature for the day, a sirloin with potato hash, zucchini, and corn. What I expected was a piece of steak with three bowls of sides. What I got was a well presented entree, consisting of a large sirloin strip atop a bed of potato hash mixed with kernels of corn and steamed string zucchini infused with garlic. No need for A1. The steak was large, well marinated, and topped with flavored butter (?) and some sort of garnishment for looks of course.  Needless to say, I left with a full stomach. Then there was my surprise bill. Based on the other entrees, I was expecting the entree to be around $20. You know what they say, if you have to ask, you can't afford it. Fortunately, I could, but I would prefer to not have a $28 surprise. So either put the price on the menu OR price no higher than the other listed menu entrees. I also had a martini, which was great and has a piece of basil that gave it additional flavor.  Service was adequate at the bar and the manager/ chef (?) came personally to check on us, which I appreciated. Nice place. I'll be going back.  Appetizers $10, cocktails $11, entrees $14-$30."}
{"text":"We went for brunch here after church.  It was ok, but not great.  The menu sounds really good, but the execution was just ok.  Two of us ordered the skillet with pork belly, pimento cheese, and egg.  Sounds delicious right? Well, it was just ok.  There was an abundance of potato, which overran the other flavors.  I didn't even really taste the pimento cheese (gasp!).  I was really looking forward to the biscuit, but it was really lacking salt and fat.  It was dry and tasteless.  The texture was as it should be though.  BF got scrambled eggs, bacon and grits (we think, not memorable), and an order of the french toast. The french toast was good, but not really good.  Overall the meal was forgettable, and we would rather go to several places nearby instead of coming back here."}
{"text":"This place is really great! We went on a Thursday night and there were a decent amount of people but there was no wait and we sat down right away. We ordered the Pimento cheese dip as an appetizer and that was not the best... The cheese was pretty good but the crackers were way too salty. For a meal I got a mushroom Caprese burger (can't remember the actual name), but it is a vegetarian option and it was AWESOME. They also split it in half on two plates because I was sharing with my mom. My dad got the steak sandwich and said it was the best steak sandwich he's ever had. As a side order we got the pork belly sliders (really delicious) and corn and jalapeño sliders (I didn't like them very much but I've never tried these, so I can't compare to others). Our waitress was also super nice and friendly- I'm coming back here for sure!!"}
{"text":"I went on a Tuesday evening with a coworker.  The place was 1/4 full at start then it picked up.  We had tapas wine and beer.  The jalapeño deviled eggs were over priced and forgettable.  Same for the short rib on au gratin sweet potatoes.  Both were good, but the rest were fantastic.  Lamb lollipops in a parsnip purée, trout over roasted brussel sprouts with candied bacon, and a second of the trout it was so good.  The price was a bit on the high side, but the service was excellent.  Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Great beer selection, unique \"gastro pub\" food... Lamb Mac n cheese is to die for!! Great atmosphere for a night out with friends in a neighborhood pub. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We arrived right when it opened at noon on Sunday. The establishment was packed due to the Panther's game. We ordered the dry rub wings, PBLT sliders, a Davidson's burger and a Blue Orchid. I'm always hesitant about dry rub wings because it's so easy to over salt them, but these were delicious and had a different flavor to them. They had a sweet and salty herbal flavor. The PBLT sliders were good and of course melted pimento cheese always makes a dish more tasty. We ordered the Davidson's burger medium rare, but it came out well done. Regardless, it was still juicy. The fries that come with the burger are AWESOME. They were fried perfectly and have a sweet and salty cajun seasoning. The staff was good even though it was busy. Our food took a while to come out because there were only two cooks and there was a large party before us. The drinks come out quickly! My tab was only ~$40-45, which is a fair price."}
{"text":"This place is exactly what every neighborhood needs a decent bar and eatery that is unpretentious yet hip and inviting. Joined a friend on a random Thursday for a late night bite to eat and a few beers and I was seriously impressed. Their drafts were all on special including the fancy nice ones! The waitress was friendly and attentive. Ordered the burger which was a bit overcooked for medium, but let's be real it difficult to get meat cooked perfectly. I can let it slide.   I will definitely be back on a weekend to check out the scene and vibe!"}
{"text":"Great Noda spot!   Checked this place out tonight for the first time, and we were definitely happy with our visit.   I started with an Atticus Finch cocktail, and it was unlike any other cocktail I've had. So many great flavors! It was a great first impression!   We then had the \"cheese and crackers\", which is pimento cheese. They had homemade crackers that were great and the cheese was topped with a delicious bacon marmalade.   Next up, the fritters. We expected them to be a bit more spongy and have some substance. When you cut them open it was basically straight cream cheese. Still delicious, just different than we expected.   Brussel sprouts were delicious. Topped with large bacon chunks and cooked perfectly.   Lamb lollipops were next. Cooked beautifully. We liked the sauce and turnip purée. I wish mine had a bit more salt, but still good.   Lastly, we had the bread pudding. We were pretty disappointed with this after such a great meal. Definitely not the cherry on top of our night. It tasted burnt and was quite dry.   Our server was fantastic. It was loud and busy, and she was still on top of everything.   Overall, I would definitely come back. Great small plates to share and a great location. Also, great service. Lovely spot!!!"}
{"text":"Hi All. We were in town, from Calif, researching real estate opportunities. With out a clue as to where to find a good meal we put it to yelp to help us out. The Public House fit the bill for eclectic faire.     For starters my gal picked the \"Spreads\" trio. The Black Bean Humus was not to be missed but the Roasted Garlic & Leaks was to die for. To wash it down try one of the extensive beer selections. A list so extensive it is sure to satisfy the seasoned palate. Don't hesitate to question server Kelly's warehouse of knowledge on the matter of what ale will befit your meal.    I rounded out my dining  pleasure with the pork rib, bone in. On the west coast I tend to  stear towards the vegetarian faire but when in Rome. . . .  I was hardily rewarded for my indiscretion.    On the whole I would highly  recommend Davidson Street Public House. If not for a memorable meal definitely just to drop in for a superb beer & small eats. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great service! It's a quiet little spot with delicious small plates and a really nice staff. I think it's pretty underrated!"}
{"text":"Okay atmosphere. Service was excellent. The food was overpriced considering the portions and mundane in flavor. We had the steak sandwich and the open faced pork belly BLT. The steak sandwich had a strange texture and had flavors that did not compliment each other. The pork belly sandwich sounded delicious, but had no flavor.."}
{"text":"Don't get the hype.   So loud that you can't have a conversation.   The mains came out before the appetizers.   I forget the name of the cocktail, but the one with Japanese whisky is simply watered down Japanese whiskey.   Side salad was a wilted, flavorless mess of crap. Seriously ridiculous to even serve that.   The service sucked ass crack. Took forever to get the bill.   Lamb mac n cheese, oxtail, shaved steak sandwich:   All ok, but not good enough to make me come back.  Pass on this establishment."}
{"text":"I like the food here a lot.  Almost everything I have had is really well prepared and is a nice break from the standard bar food in NODA.  Presentation is important to them and so is the quality of the ingredients.  It's an interesting and innovative menu outside of the norms.  The charcuterie is solid and I keep going back to the dry rub wings.  The lamb lollipops are outstanding and so are the scallops too.  They have a nice outdoor seating area on the side with occasional live music. The drink specials during the week are a great deal but it can get pricey on the weekends.  Super solid cocktails including some ice cubes with lemons frozen inside.  I only have two issues with them.  Many of their dishes are small portions and highly priced for the neighborhood.  I know the quality of the ingredients are great so they have higher food costs but...the other issue is that they do not put the prices of the draught list on the menu.  Why won't the tell you how much the beer is without asking?           After all of that...I've been coming here since they opened and really want to give this place five stars but just can't.  ***  I live in the middle of NODA and have been everywhere in the neighborhood many times over the past years. These reviews are a culmination of lots of visits so it's more of a consistency rating than anything.  If you are going out in NODA I've got reviews up of all the places in the neighborhood if you're looking to compare.  ***"}
{"text":"My fiance and I really wanted to go to a new-to-us spot in Charlotte. We have been wanting to try the Davidson Street Public House, and I'm so glad we did! I ordered their basic house salad which included arugula, apples, onions, and a lemon vinaigrette dressing. I also ordered a gin and grapefruit beverage that was delicious.   The only reason I give DSPH 4 stars is that I felt like our service could have been better. Our bartender forgot our drink orders immediately after we placed them and had to come back to ask us. There were some minor things, and I think it could have been better.  The food was wonderful! I took a bite of my fiance's burger and it was juicy, fresh, and flavorful. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Down from NYC for a wedding, we picked this place because it was close to our hotel and the reviews on Yelp. The food was OK, not great so we weren't excited about our meal after eating here. Certainly wasn't the type of place we'd go back to. To be fair, it's a decent place. My cocktail was delicious which was the Japlapeno Smash (I substituted Hendrink's Gin in lieu of the vodka or tequila) and the salad was good (forgot what it was called). The lamb in the lamp lollipops were good, but the pomegranate glaze on top of the salad and meat was overly sweet and felt like we needed something saltier on the plate to balance out the flavors. The menu looked good but execution can be better."}
{"text":"This place has a great ambiance, and overall good food. We ordered the portabella caprese sandwich with fries and a Davidson burger. It was all very delicious. We also had three tapas to share for the table, these were the cucumber dill cups, one of the spreads (roasted garlic) and the corn jalapeño fritters. Highly recommend the spread, the other ones were OK... But I personally think it all was a little expensive for what it was. I must say, the presentation was beautiful!! The portions of the portabella sandwich and the burger were generous. But I must say, that for what it was it was an expensive meal... I would recommend coming, but for a special occasion or if you are not in a budget. Lastly, we went there in Tuesday night, and there was trivia night. Unless you want to partake, I wouldn't recommend it, it's very loud! Overall a good experience..."}
{"text":"We celebrated 2 birthdays in one night and had such a great time!  Everyone was very happy with their food and the atmosphere was fun.  Highlights were the twist on the moscow mule cocktail with vanilla, the BLT, jalapeno fritters, and lamb chops - basically everything we had.  we'll definitely be back!"}
