{"text":"The pizza was ok and the chips as an appetizer were good. Anna our waitress was very pleasant and did a great job!!!"}
{"text":"I don't spend much time around Phillips Place, so don't know the usual scene, but it was like Furr's Cafeteria in this piece. The pizza wasn't very interesting, parking was terrible, and the crowd was married with children and/or their grandparents. It's suburbia chain restaurant hell. I think the food will be predictable and edible, just nothing too exciting or daring."}
{"text":"My new favorite place for a date night  - I love the bar, great service and it's just a gorgeous set up. Pizza was amazing, I read the other review and had to go with the mushroom pizza, so yummy.   I'm giving it four stars instead of five because bar service could have been better, but I am an ex-bartender and can be pretty picky about my service. Overall it's a great restaurant, looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"Nettes Restaurant mit guten Pizzen, richtigem Bier und freundlichen Bedienungen. Neben Pizza gibt's auch Pasta, Sandwich, Steaks und Salate. Es ist nicht der typische amerikanische Fastfood Kram, sondern handgemachtes gutes Essen.  Sehr zu empfehlen."}
{"text":"Wolfgang Puck Pizza Bar is within walking distance for us, so it's a fabulous last minute date night option. The interior is awesome an I love the glasses and dishes they use for presentation. The ravioli is amazing (with pine nuts on top to jazz it up!) and my husband had the duck sausage pizza which I tasted and thought it was amazing too. I wish the service was a little better--we ordered an app and then they told us there was complimentary bread afterward, and our waters were not refilled until we asked, even though everyone else had a glass bottle of water at their table, but the food and atmosphere make this a great spot overall!"}
{"text":"Went here for restaurant week and they had the BEST menu! We all (4 of us) enjoyed our meals which were varied from seafood, to pork, to chicken, and the serving sizes were great, not too much but not too small either. I especially loved the warm caramel sea salt pudding for dessert!"}
{"text":"We have dined here numerous times including five times for the Sunday family dinner. This evenings meal was very disappointing. They changed the  menu back in the winter and management have clearly decided to cut back on the size of portions. This evenings meal would not feed four adults. Servings are half plate sizes. Food quality was good but not enough food. Dessert was a joke. One pudding cup and one cookie to be shared by four people. I suppose we each stick a spoonful in and pass the cup around. Similarly the small cookie had to be quartered to be shared. They brought out a apple tart (no knife or fork) with a tiny scoop of ice cream. Again to be quartered and shared. I told the waitress we have eaten here numerous times, including the Sunday dinner this past Easter, and never have the portion been this small. She informed me that it is corporate that has changed the portions and lots of customers have negatively commented.   Good location, good atmosphere, generally good food but really poor value. Obviously profits  are down so corporate cut back on the food servings. No sales...no profit...no longer in business!"}
{"text":"Been twice for lunch and enjoyed it both times. Love the large bar area and the ambience inside. Patio is great on a nice day, but can be loud. I love the Spinach and Smoked Mozzarella salad - everything from the warm pancetta dressing, the smoky strips of mozzarella, and the crispy bits of potato make every bite a treat. The pizzas are great too - the dough is thin but stands up to the toppings, perfectly chewy, and bubbly crust. On my most recent visit I split the Spinach salad, the chicken meatball pizza, and the prosciutto/arugula pizza. Everything was great, no complaints."}
{"text":"Potato egg pizza. Nothing else will suffice. Service and managers are fantastic. Highly recommend, especially Tuesday (1/2 price bottle of wine) and Fri/Sat (1/2 pizza from 10-midnight).  Truly a great experience."}
{"text":"First time visit.  Food was superb and staff very pleasant.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"Terrific place- high energy, great food- terrific pizza selections: unique flavor combos. Good wine list too- reasonable prices. We are going back!  Little wonder wolfgang has built a food empire!!!"}
{"text":"We ate at the bar on a Tuesday night - half price bottles of wine, yay!  and they have one of my favorite whites, Little James Basket Press.  not that easy to find!  Anyway.  The pizza was good, the mussels were yummy and the service at the bar was casual and friendly.  A nice way to spend a Tuesday night."}
{"text":"We travel from Hickory and choose to eat at Wolfgang Puck in a town full of great choices for Wolfgang's signature Smoked Salmon Pizza.  The reworked menu does NOT include the menu item THAT PUT THIS CHEF ON THE MAP!!  PUT IT BACK PLEEEEEASE!!!  Seriously no reason to eat here anymore. Sorry ."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great ambiance! Been a fan of Puck since first going to Spago in California ten years ago. And this pizza bar has a creative menu, welcoming environment, and terrific service, all at a mid-price range. They even have a daily wine special and the $4 cabernet was actually pretty good. If you haven't been, you should try it. Hope to try the patio next time."}
{"text":"I discovered Wolgang's through the OpenTable app and I've been in twice since. The first time I visited was by far the best... I ordered their special and although I can't remember the name of it, the pizza had an egg over medium on top... it was delicious!!   The second time I visited, I got an appetizer that was probably the best I've ever had. I don't say that lightly. It was the goat cheese & tomato al forno and I couldn't get enough of it! I wish I didn't have to share it. I could easily just order that as my main meal next time if I wasn't super hungry.   For my meal, I got the Goat Cheese Pizza. I won't lie, it was a little much. My boyfriend got the Spicy Chicken & also thought it was ingredient overload... it wasn't so much that it wasn't good, but there were ingredients on both of ours (i.e. olives, onions) that weren't listed on the menu so we didn't know to ask for the pizza sans those ingredients.   The atmosphere here is great & the food is excellent quality... the crust is delicious, although as other reviewers have mentioned, it's almost too much crust. BUT, if you order the appetizer I mentioned, save your leftover sauce & use it for dipping your crust... that's so good!"}
{"text":"I had lunch at the bar this week.  the service was horrible, she had a major atttitude, and only smiled when she delivred the check.  I ordered ice tea, had to ask for sweetner,  had to stir the sweetner with my fork.  I enjoyed the soup and sandwhich, as the procuitto was delicious,  the whole experience could have been better had the bartender been the slighest bit nice and friendly.  This was my 5th time to the resturant,  will definetly go back, but will avoid the blonde bar tender at all cost.  Table service is always friendly and helpful....  She needs to go away......"}
{"text":"Four of us came in to eat dinner and we were told there was a 40 minute wait to eat. After 40 minutes of standing, we asked when we were going to sit. The hostess looked very annoyed and told us she didn't really know but she might be able to seat us in 20-25 minutes. At this point, we are all starving and didn't want to hear in 20 more minutes there may still be 10 minutes to wait. This is ridiculous - if you are booked, tell us. Then we wouldn't have wasted almost an hour of our time."}
{"text":"The service and decor were excellent, especially for a casual restaurant.  Salads are offered in small and large sizes.  The Caesar salad is unusual, but delicious.  My husband enjoyed the beet salad.  Pizza was great, of course!  Nice crisp crust and fresh ingredients.  I would highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Eh not impressed and will not return. Seemed like a nice restaurant and the staff was friendly, but then our food came out. I ordered a pizza, my husband the spaghetti and meatballs. My pizza had no flavor, the crust was so chewy my jaw hurt half way into it and to top it off it was a $12 pizza. Maybe if it was cheaper it wouldn't have been so disappointing, but it left me wishing for a frozen pizza. My husbands dish was no better. As he twirled the pasta around his fork, watery sauce dripped everywhere. It looked like they didn't strain it enough and once they added the sauce it was just a runny mess. I saw the same thing happen to another man with a pasta dish a few tables away. Maybe it was just off night in the kitchen, but Charlotte has too many amazing restaurants for me to waste time going back here."}
{"text":"This is the best mid range restaurant in Charlotte. The manager (Cedric) remembered my gf and I after one visit, and always treated us with amazing service. The food is always amazing and the bartenders whip up amazing drinks. Give this place a try you will love it."}
{"text":"LOVE this place!!! Just moved from NYC and have absolutely hated every pizza place recommended to me. It's as if each one was worse than the last until we tried Wolfgang's. Pizza down here is very cheesy and under cooked compared to NY.  Wolfgang however has got it right!!! We are here once a week now and have tried just about every pizza on the menu, all of them have been outstanding! Their margarita is the first one I've had here that was done right, it has marinara with fresh mozz and basil (not sliced tasteless tomatoes like some other places around here have!), perfection! The salads are great too and be sure to have some zeppoles for dessert. Also the Barbera offered by the glass is my favorite!  As for service, it's exceptional and the atmosphere is fabulous!  I cannot rave enough about this place, we are so happy we've found it!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  We usually sit at the bar or bar table.  The pizzas are really good, have had to send them back before for burnt crusts, but that hasn't happened in a while.  Great cocktails and apps too.  It can be a little loud and the TVs are huge, but it is a pizza bar.  Great addition to the food scene in Charlotte.  Don't know why the description says Ballantyne and Southpark, it's in the Southpark part of town, not Ballantyne at all."}
{"text":"Don't judge this WP by the WPs you see at the airport. Don't judge this WP by his line of foods at the grocery store.  This just be my go-to for a more upscale pizza experience.  (I mean come on...our server told us the dough is fermented for a week before it goes on to step two.  It's gotta be special.)   Pizza joints are good for different reasons.  There are times I like a good NY style floppy piece.  There are times I like to make my own with different toppings. Heck.  Sometimes all you need is a hot n' fresh pie for $5 at Little Caesars! (Well, they may be 6 bucks now...)  Anyway.   You'll find WP at the end of Phillips Place closest to the hotel, across from the Palm.    On this visit, my husband and I were impressed by the multiple waitstaff who catered to us, even though it was relatively busy. We must've had four different runners in addition to our main server, who was not only sweet, but knowledgable about the food.  (She told me she's tried the menu, which is a HUGE deal to me...how can you have a server who hasn't experienced the food?)  Here's the food rundown:  1. Roasted Baby Beets Salad: Can't go wrong. Marcona almonds, grapefruit, arugula, nice yellow and red beets and goat cheese.  Sounds standard, but very nice if you're a beet salad fan.   2. BBQ Chicken Pizza: I KNOW.  Why order this when you can get it everywhere.  Well, that's the point! The dough truly is spectacular. I mean crispy crunchy no black burnt spots, light and moist at the same time. I really can't describe it.  What I also loved is NO SOGGINESS! The crust isn't dusted with annoying cornmeal either.  The onions truly were caramelized, and just enough BBQ sauce.  Again, this blows the airport WP outta the water!   3. Sweet Fennel Sausage and Ricotta: ditto the above...except with really lovely house made sausage and ricotta. Perfect sauce to cheese ratio...won't make you feel ill after consumption.   4. Strawberry Rhubarb Cobbler: Lovely with a quenelle of gelato.  The rhubarb chunks were kind of too big for my taste, but the cobbler portion with candied ginger, nice touch.    5. Teas come in a pot...one pot is enough for two people IMO.   Can't wait to try more WP menu items! The pizzas are reasonable too.  I think ours were like 11 and 12 bucks.  They do carry-out too, which will be dangerous since we don't like far.    My new fave gourmet pizza in CLT...and honestly, on my top 5 list in the country so far.   PS: There are TVs at the bar.  Small note, but important for sports fans!"}
{"text":"Poor service and ok food. We sat in the bad and had a long wait to order and for our food. We had to ask our server for refills, cheese, a check, and a box. We had to walk to the bar to get her attention. Fries were great - fun atmosphere - ok pizza."}
{"text":"I love this place!  My boyfriend recently moved to Charlotte, and this is right by his new place. For starters, their drink specials are fantastic. 1/2 off Processco and champagne on Fridays? Done.   What we've had:  PB Salad: huge and fantastic. Good to split. Calamari: Loved it Linguine: I was super bummed that the pesto one they had was taken off the menu because it was to die for, but I tried the new one with shrimp and mussels and it did not disappoint Pizza: My boyfriend has tried most of the pizzas here and has not had one he didn't like.    Definitely recommend for dinner and/or drinks!"}
{"text":"This place is great!  It's not at all how I envisioned it looking and I'm glad about that - the interior is really cool (great bar) and there is a nice patio as well.  The service was great and the food exceeded my expectations.    I got the roasted beet salad with goat cheese and these spanish almonds that I need to order online somehow, and the salmon with a panzanella salad (this was the special for the day) and both were delicious.  I tried the chicken and broccolini pizza which was really good, but will try the spicy rock shrimp one next time.    My favorite thing was the chicken meatballs - doesn't sound really appealing but they're in an al forno sauce (tomato sauce and herbs - tons of flavor) and I hoovered at least 4 of them.  It's great if you have kids, but also want a dinner that is a bit more refined than the average pizza joint.  I thought it was very reasonably priced for the quality of food we ate as well."}
{"text":"An excellent spot to enjoy a quick and casual meal. The lamb pizza is amazing (and I don't typically like to eat lamb), and the classic salad is a wonderfully simple yet tasty choice. We also love the rigatoni bolognese - excellent. They have good promotional specials every day and if you want an appetizer you cannot go wrong with the delicious hummus! Only reason I took 1 star away is because the wine list isn't my favorite; they could stand to add a mid-range oaked/buttery Chardonnay. Otherwise, we love this spot!"}
{"text":"I was a little worried after other people's reviews about the service. But hubby and I came here on a Monday night and everything was stellar. Our server, Christine, was awesome.  We had the kale salad and the beet salad. Both were great but the kale was best. Hubby had pasta which came with a white wine butter sauce but he was in the mood for a red sauce and, no problem!  I had the lamb sausage pizza and it was great, thin and crispy.  Will definitely be back next time."}
{"text":"Pizzas were awesome.  French fries were delicious.  Skip the desserts.  Martini glass came half full!  Service was very good."}
{"text":"We have visited Wolfgang's Pizza Bar several times and have never been disappointed with the food or service, it has been consistently good each visit.  We had the baked goat cheese appetizer, absolutely amazing and got some pizzas and and several cocktails. The service and food were great as always.    We usually love the atmosphere of this restaurant, classy, yet not stuffy, casual but not corner bar casual and find it to be romantic and comfortable.   Tonight was a little different and we were VERY disappointed, midway through our meal they turned the music off and put the soccer game on and from that point on were had to listen to a table of loud, obnoxious guys yelling and cheering every two minutes while we were trying to talk, it kind of felt like we were in a sports bar. I would not expect this at a place like Wolfgang Pucks and we might have to check if there is a sporting event on before our next visit.  We are still big fans and love the food and service. but this was a real mood killer for our date night."}
{"text":"The only \"con\" I may point out about this place is naming it a pizza bar because it is far more than just cheesy crusts! The name doesn't do it justice, as I have nothing but wonderful experiences every time I've wined and dined. As a wine lover, I have found myself loving a glass of their house Wolfgang Chardonnay. For $6 bucks a glass, you cant go wrong. The bartenders are always friendly and super-attentive. Great qualities to have behind the bar.   They offer an awesome selection of apps, gourmet salads and seasonally fresh entrees to choose from. The rosemary chicken dish was amazing as well as was the cup of roasted corn chowder.   Ok...though I personally wish they'd left off the \" pizza\" in pizza bar, their dough is certainly noteworthy. The pizzas are of great quality. Cooked to a perfect temperature, crunch and texture, they resemble dishes seen on the Food Network channel. Yes, they're that unique and good-looking. Such combinations as fried egg and potato as toppings to the traditional Margarita, there is a pie to meet anyone's taste! Always a good time at Wolfgang!"}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere..very cozy and comfortable!  The food is solid.  Of course, I always have the pizza.  Pizza is nice and thin, but usually has too much crust.  I have tried the mushroom pizza and the goat cheese...and the flavors were both great.  I usually get the kale salad for a starter...love it.  On my first visit the service was 5 stars.  Our guy waiter was amazing.  Last night, however, the woman waiting on us deflated the whole experience...I'd give her 1 star.  She had no interest in us.  She brought the wine and mixed up the orders.  Didn't even pretend to care when we were shifting the glasses around.  Never checked in the whole meal.  Then when the check came she charged both of us for the wrong wine (more expensive).  When we pointed it out she acknowledged it like she had known she made a mistake and was hoping we did not notice.  Instead of just taking care of it, she brought over the wine menus and had to make us point out which wine each of us had ordered.  Never said \"sorry\".  Made us feel like it was our fault.  Thus a 4-5 star review dropped down to 3."}
{"text":"I came here around 11:30 on a Saturday afternoon and was happy to find the place pretty empty. I was with a party of 7 and service was prompt and very friendly. Everyone enjoyed the food, and there were a few good drink specials. I ordered a salmon pizza and loved it. It really seemed like the food was above average."}
{"text":"My husband and I came over to Wolfgang Puck on Friday night after listing to music at Piedmont Center.   We decided to order a bottle of wine and got the Wolfgang Puck Cab. Excellent house wine!   For food, we got two small salads and split the mushroom truffle pizza. The salads were great and perfect portions. The pizza was sooooo yummy! The mixture of mushroom and truffle oil was perfect combo!  Service was excellent. We arrived fairly late and actually were still there after they closed. We apologized alot after we realized they were closed and we were still there (kinda in our own world chatting over wine!) but they didnt kick us out and werent rude at all about it! Absolutely love this place"}
{"text":"Always great service, and they started my love of arugula and prosciutto topped pizza!   Not a fan of arugula, buts it's amazing on pizza."}
{"text":"Social Media Charlotte had a happy hour at Wolfgang Puck and I was wary.  I haven't been a huge fan of the celebrity chef restaurants in Charlotte so far.    We had a nice little set up near the bar with hummus and pita bread and a drink special.  So far so good.  The hummus was great & they have a st germain martini, my absolute favorite liquor.  It could have been a bit bigger for the price (it was about a 4-5 oz drink) but other than that I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Then they brought pizzas out, even one with smoked salmon (all of them were delicious) then after we were stuffed from hummus and pizza they brought out cavatappi pasta.  It has goat cheese, peas & roasted chicken in it and it was possibly the best pasta dish I've ever had but I was so incredibly full from the other amazing food they brought out that I only ate a bit and they gave us the rest to go.  I told my boyfriend he could have the rest for dinner when I got home and within 60 seconds he inhaled the entire to go container of pasta and declared it the best pasta he's ever had.  Seriously, it's that good.  Probably a good thing that South Park is 30 minutes away or I'd be there all the time.    I was also extremely impressed with the wait staff, even during a busy dinner & bar rush they were still very attentive and helpful and made the experience event better.   I'm supposed to go gluten free tomorrow (doctors orders!) and I was so sad that  wouldn't be able to have the cavatappi pasta again.  Imagine my surprise when I discovered today they also have a gluten free menu & that the cavatappi is on it!  hooray!  I can't wait to come back and test out their glutten free menu."}
{"text":"Sorry not great. Hostess on the phone never acknowledged our party, even with a nod. Great menu selection and nice ambiance. Our food was pretty good but service very slow and not attentive at all. They forgot our soup (and we only ordered soup and salad). Seemed miffed when we said we didn't want it anymore. Ordered coffee after lunch and the mugs and coffee service were awesome except the entire pot was COLD.  Waiter mentioned he'd remove it from the bill. Duhhhh!"}
{"text":"First of all KUDOS to Wolfgang for playing Mississippi Queen by Mountain. Love that song! Wolfgang Puck Pizza Bar is everything a pizza place should be. Beautiful interior and a friendly staff. Great for lunch and dinner. The pizza crust is super thin. Almost makes you feel like you're eating healthy pizza...lol. My little guest had the kids pepperoni pizza, which she said was great! I must say, it did look delicious. I had the Spicy Shrimp and Arugula. It had lots of garlic (always good for pizza, maybe not your breath), but it didn't have much flavor. I was expecting more spice from the shrimp. I had to add chili flakes :(. Overall the pizza was very good, I had no problem eating the whole thing lol. Just wanted a little more KA-POW! Can't wait to get back, I love it! Great addition to the Charlotte Pizza scene."}
{"text":"Compared to pizza in general, this place is certainly above average. Compared to Neapolitan style pizza, I would classify it as average.  I ordered the prosciutto pizza and I'll give them props for using Prosciutto di Parma and not some American pseudo-prosciutto crap. I also give them props for putting the prosciutto on after baking the pizza, the proper method. Doing otherwise is infuriating and a waste of prosciutto. Where I was disappointed was with the use of grated and not shaved parmesan on the pizza, which really added an overpowering flavor to the pie. If I wanted grated parmesan, I would have added it myself (which will only happen if the pizza is awful). The pizza also came with roasted red peppers that were simply too powerful. Between the two, the taste of the prosciutto, the gem of the dish, was rather faint.   The pizza was still excellent and, as I said, better than most pizza places. But with a little simplicity the best of the flavor (Prosciutto di Parma) could have been highlighted more and the pizza could have been even better."}
{"text":"Wild mushroom pizza is great!  We've been to Pizza | Bar several times now and the food and service has always been right on. Last time we visited, we grabbed a nice bottle of white and ordered the fried calamari. It was a great appetizer but really filling. They added the hot peppers in similar to Capital Grill- however to not quite the same effect. All in all... A super solid choice in Southpark."}
{"text":"I do have to say I was impressed by the great staff.   The food was good. I had a pinot noir and flat iron steak , medium rare.   The brocolli was good , the crispy potatoes were awesome.    But my favorite part was the calamari appetizer... It was light and very tender.  It's hard to find a place that makes good calamari.     Also the coffee and churros were crazy yummy.     But the main part of the experience that would bring me back was the great staff.    I very much enjoyed the wolf gang experience."}
{"text":"Food was really good. We ordered pizza, French fries, truffle potato chips, and hummus dip... Service was great and they were able to accommodate 6 people. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Excellent service, great pizza, awesome salads and no problem getting a perfectly grilled chicken breast on the side. Convenient location being a block from my new residence. I'll be going back soon."}
{"text":"I Have been here a few times now and I would say this place is pretty good! I think our first time here was a lot better then my last few. First time we were super impressed with everything i couldn't wait to come back so we were back a week later!!   The Calamari the first time was great the two times after it has been soggy and not as good not sure what changed. The salad that had banana pepper's and prosciutto and artichokes was great but now taken off the menu and the chopped salad they replaced it with was ok but the when we received it they forgot to put the meat on it and included onions when we asked not to have them they sent out another one this time correct but it was just alright. We did have the Corn soup and that was very good!! We had a Potato and Egg pizza on the last trip and that was not good the potato on it was not cooked all the way so they were hard to eat and the egg was cold. I have had the Broccolini and Chicken pizza which was great, the Lamb one also pretty good and the meatball which was also great so I will not order the potato one again no biggy!!   I would say what has also changed in my experiences is the service- while the servers are nice they are not very attentive and don't pay attention to detail very well- we had the margaritas they have on the cocktail menu which are Great we had a few at the bar and then when we sat we ordered another round the server came out with a completely different glass and straight up not on the rox- umm what are these we asked and he was like um your margaritas I think- we were all just looking at each other confused why are these so different from what we got at the bar and why didn't the server catch it until we had to ask about it- Fine we said well just pour them over our ice in the old glasses. Then on my last visit we sat at the bar now they were pretty busy but had 3 of them behind the bar so we get helped and they make my margarita the right way and then they mess up my BF's cocktail we both watched her make it and she completely forgot a step that's fine but it made all the difference in the drink and we had to wait to get her attention again in order for her to fix it. It was kinda like that all night though our drinks would stay empty for long periods of time and the service was very spotty. I will go one more time and hopefully it will be better otherwise I cant see myself going again consistency is key from service to the food and beverages!"}
{"text":"The Cooked, Corked, & Poured dinner every month is what any foodie should be after.  A Top Chef event with special drink pairing from a local distributor every time (we have attend the wine, OMB, and vodka sessions so far).  It quickly becomes the highlight for us every month!"}
{"text":"So I've been ready to try this place since they opened. However, I wasn't as \"WOW-ed\" as I expected to be...  For a Saturday night, there was a bit of a wait, but it was Restaurant Week so that probably added a little more waiting time than normal. Our seat was right out of the kitchen and for a busy night that wasn't the best place for a first experience or for a nice date night out. Not to mention that service was a bit lacking. I think Derrick and I saw our waiter for a total of 3 times. He introduced himself, took our order and brought us the check. That was it. Really?   No refills, no \"how's the food?\", or check in's  to see if we needed something or wanted to add something else....ugh. I understand it was \"busy\" but ever table is important....not just the larger parties.   Okay, now on to the food....  We started with the Sweet & Spicy chicken wings. They were okay. They could have been cooked a little longer and they could have added a few more wings....I mean for the price I just expected more. Would I order them again....nope. However, the garlic bread starter was pretty delish.   For pizza's we ordered the Chicken Meatball pizza and the Prosciutto di Parma. They were both good but not great. I think my main issue was that could have been warmer. It was like they'd been sitting out for a little while before they made it to the table. The other thing is that I'm a sucker for a great crust and I just found it to be just okay, not bad by any means just not the best I've ever had.  On the bright side, I did really enjoyed the chicken meatballs, they were really packed with some great flavors.   Would I be willing to go back? Sure, but it would have to be when they aren't so busy, and I'd make sure to order a different pizza or dish for a good comparison."}
{"text":"The service is very poor. You might see your waiter once or twice. My food was cold and not very good. I won't be back."}
{"text":"We've been here many a time and have consistently enjoyed eating here. For the price, the food is quite good."}
{"text":"Smoked Salmon Pizza....  Simply the BEST thing on this earth!  I get this every other week only because I'm in town. If you are ever by a WGP Pizza Bar and like smoked salmon get this and melt away.  If I could figure out the sauce I'd quit period.  Go there now!"}
{"text":"Very very noisy on a Saturday night. Limited menu, but reasonable prices. The food is just average. There are many better locations nearby."}
{"text":"The wife and I dropped by Wolfgang Puck Pizza Bar with another couple after a movie at the Phillips place theatre.  Having been to a few other Puck restaurants in the past, I was expecting great food and the Pizza Bar did not disappoint.  I had the classic smoked salmon pizza and the wife got the mushroom pizza and both were delicious.  The mushroom blend was just the way I like it with all kinds of earthy flavors from the variety of mushrooms used.  The smoked salmon pie was a little rich in flavor, so needless to say that I left the restaurant very full.  Our friends split a salad and a pizza and enjoyed their food as well.  The beer selection was decent with mostly local brews on tap.  I had heard that they were open late and the place was pretty full at around 10pm when we showed up, but it was pretty empty when we left between 11:30 and 12.  The service was good overall, attentive mostly, but there was an odd moment when I ordered my smoked salmon pizza and our server had to insist several times that the smoked salmon was raw and not cooked.  I assured her that it was fine, but it still made for an awkward moment.  Nevertheless, we will return to venture into other parts of the menu soon."}
{"text":"What happened? This used to be one of my favorite places to dine is Philips Place. They've changed the entire menu and concept. Nothing is the same. I am going to miss the burger, hummus and pizza! This used to be a very family friendly restaurant, now it is very upscale and more expensive. Not terrible, but not worth the price. $$"}
{"text":"Good food at a reasonable price. I am always leary of chain restaurants but this place was good. Sat at the bar and enjoyed a margarita pizza and a glass of Pinot Grigio."}
{"text":"Very disappointing, as I usually love all things Wolfgang Puck! Food and service here were both a disappointment. The bartender had way too much on his plate, with all the bar seats and all the tables in the bar area. I had ordered two appetizers for my dinner - the fried goat cheese and the bruschetta. The bruschetta was very unusual... and not in a good way. The ingredients did not go well together. And the goat cheese appetizer was a little pan of warm goat cheese and marinara sauce, with these horrible doughy bread balls. I planned to ask the server/bartender to bring me some regular bread to make it more edible, but he never came back to my table to check on me. When I did finally flag him down to ask for some real bread to use for dipping, he said sure, but thought it was more appropriate to bus the table next to me first before getting it. Meanwhile my goat cheese had turned stone cold. Fail. Maybe things would have been different if I had just ordered a pizza... but I doubt I will be back to give them another try."}
{"text":"This was the best pizza I've ever had. Homemade lamb sausage, roasted eggplant and peppers.  I are at a random time so the restaurant was empty. My server was very nice and helpful with the menu."}
{"text":"Since my first visit back in the first two weeks of Pizza | Bar's soft open, my wife and I have been back on multiple occasions, tried several more of the menu items, and have been continually blown away by the cocktail menu.   We recently came back in to celebrate and the staff made it so memorable for us. The managers and staff congratulated us and even gave us two glasses of champagne for our celebration! Such a nice gesture. That's what really set Pizza | Bar apart from a 4-star experience. The service. The managers on the floor are very present, visitant, and extremely astute in all things detail-oriented. The servers are professional and always lively with conversation.   We also recently discovered how unreal the rotisserie chicken is. I'm not one typically for chicken, but the fare here....with those amazing potatoes, is unreal.   One of our favorite spots for dinner, lunch, a few cocktails (which are amazing, by the way) or a spot to celebrate an occasion. Always a great experience."}
{"text":"Food is decent.  Service is incredibly slow!   Whatever you do, do not order iced tea! My bill came and the charge for iced tea was $5.70! I asked the bartender if that was right and she said \"yes, we make the tea in-house.\"  That's so ridiculous!   I will never go back!"}
{"text":"I had a great time... They had half on well drinks with mixer... So I got vodka and cranberry for $3! And it was pinnacle... I had the steak frites... Which is a flat iron steak and raw cut fries... The steak was cooked perfectly... The fries were great... But they have so much fries and not enough ketchup... But whatever, the waitress was nice and told us the specials right away... The cups were small so I know she was tired of coming back to refill the water a lot... But overall great time and the food was great... Will visit again!"}
{"text":"I tried this place when it first opened and never went back until today. It is great; the octopus appetizer is better than the one at Custom Shop (and their's is excellent) and the pizzas we had for lunch were delicious.  I saw, at another  table, some one had ordered the mussels appetizer with a side of fries for their lunch and it looked so good I can not wait to go back and have the same.  If the last time you were there was over a year ago please give them another try they are terrific."}
{"text":"Went for lunch today, to try the potato egg pizza - after seeing it reviewed in a magazine about Best of Charlotte.  I would have given this 4 stars, because the service was a little off. However, that being said, there was this AWFUL woman (customer) sitting next to us who started screaming like a spoiled child over the slowness of the service. I'm talking, full-on temper tantrum. And the staff all responded with such graciousness, that I didn't even care anymore that it took awhile to get service when we first got there.   Now ...... on to the food!!!  We got the pesto garlic bread. It arrived in a little cast iron skillet, and looked actually like cinnamon rolls. Very well presented. The pesto was delicious, and we loved it.  I had the potato egg pizza, which I can't even begin to describe how GOOD this was. Not a combination I ever would have thought of, but wow. My husband had the sausage fennel pizza, and his also was amazing (I had a slice of his). Both pizza's had very distinctive flavoring, and were very memorable.  Can't wait to return and try some of the other pizza's.  And to the woman sitting next to us - get a grip. I'm sorry you had to wait a whole extra 10 minutes for your meal due to restaurant error. But there's no need to belittle the servers. And no need to ruin my meal by having to watch your bad behavior. Next time, please quietly go get speak to the manager. Thank you."}
{"text":"We arrived at 7:30 on a Friday night without reservations. We were told that there was a 45 minute to an hour wait but that the bar was first come first serve. So we waited by the bar for it to open up. There were easily 30% of the tables in the dining room unseated.  As we were waiting to get seats at the bar, a group was leaving and another couple came in. The hostess said again that there was a wait but that they could sit at the seats at the bar where the group was leaving. These were the seats we were obviously waiting on and had been there long before this new couple. So the other couple assumed that those seats at the bar were for them. We had to fend them off and grab the seats as soon as the group at the bar left. This resulted in the couple being angry and then standing directly behind us ordering over us from the bar. First come first serve means just that!   We initially figured we would just get drinks and we would be seated rather quickly because there were plenty of empty tables available. We ordered a Caesar salad that was quite good. At this point we had been waiting for about 30 minutes and just decided to order our dinner from the bar. I ordered the lamb sausage pizza and my wife ordered the BBQ chicken pizza. We waited for 25 minutes and saw others at the bar get their food. I asked the bartender how long it will be before we get our pizzas. He left with the receipt and went back to the kitchen. The kitchen never made our orders. A manager came up and apologized and offered to give us a free salad while we continued to wait. Not helpful.   Eventually the bar manager came over and apologized and said our entire meal would be comp'ed. After about 15 more minutes our food came out and was very good. My pizza was hot and fresh tasting. In spite of the kitchen not making our order,  the service was good so we gave them a sizable tip even though we were not charged for any food or drink. We will likely return but will be sure to make reservations next time if we want to sit at a table."}
{"text":"I love the Pizza Bar! My husband and I have frequented this Philips Place hot spot quite a few times, it's the perfect spot for dinner after a movie.  We try to order different appetizers and pizzas each time we visit, but it's not hard to have a favorite, they are all very good.  For appetizers, we've had the Garlic & White Bean Hummus with house made crostini, the Baked Goat Cheese with Parmesan zeppole (yay for fried dough!), and the Crispy Calamari.  I could certainly have a selection of appetizers as my meal but that's not the only reason we visit the Pizza Bar.   For pizzas, I know I just said that we try to order different items at each visit, but the famous \"Wolfgang's Smoked Salmon\" pizza always seems to end up at our table. My husband and I both love salmon in any style and this pizza is so darn good. We have had the Roasted Mushroom pizza, the Sweet Fennel Sausage pizza, the Carolina Goat Cheese pizza, and the House-made Duck Sausage pizza. Each pizza is perfectly prepared with it's featured topping on a perfectly crispy-chewy crust - simply perfect pizza.  The portions are good and the pizzas could easily be shared when you add in salads and appetizers, which is always our intention, but we continually ignore that notion when we sit down and order. We justify it by saying that we'll have leftovers for tomorrow.   On the dessert front, we've had the Soda Shop Sampler and the Seasonal Cobbler - my pick generally goes to the cobbler.  The service is generally attentive and friendly. The servers are willing to provide suggestions on everything from cocktails to dessert. The Pizza Bar will continue to be on our dinner option rotation."}
{"text":"Superb!  Went on a corporate dinner, and tried the lamb-sausage pizza, shrimp and clam pizza, and BBQ chicken pizza-- all very nice.  The appetizers (calamari) were just OK. Service was a little slow, although it seemed not that busy inside on a random Thur night.   All in all, my fave pizza place in CLT. Very fresh ingredients. Cool vibe. Nice beer specials."}
{"text":"My wife and were craving quality pizza in Charlotte North Carolina. I yelped and found WP's Pizza Bar. The reviews looked promising- reviews were littered with phrases like house made duck sausage, prosciutto and peaches, and baked goat cheese. I'm thinking we are on to something. Location was super easy- Phillips Place is right across the street from South Park Mall. No wait time- we were seated just before out reservation and had two glasses of Cab tout suite. We were lucky to have been seated outside. The inside is attractive- lots of reclaimed wood and Edison lights. I'm a sucker for Edison lights. Our server was Eric; he was friendly, attentive, and humorous. Server trifecta. We started with the baked goat cheese. It was, well, just meh. It's a hefty scoop of goat cheese baked in a pool of marinara in a small skillet. We shared the house salad, which is plenty for two and probably too much for one. Really good salad. I had the prosciutto and Parmesan pie. Super blistery, crisp out side, but still stretchy. It was topped with arugula and lousy with prosciutto. Can one have too much prosciutto? No. The answer is no. It was fantastic. My wife's pizza was the spinach and mushroom and she added caramelized onions. She was well served by her decision. We finished with the soda shop sampler for dessert which was comprised of sugary zeppoles, a small scoop of gelato, and a side car of espresso milkshake. At this point, I'm looking into an iv drip of espresso milkshake on a pole. Anyway, I highly recommend this for great pizza in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Went to Wolfgang's for a first date lunch date. The food was very good, but the reason our experience was so great was definitely our server. Tim was awesome! I would return just to have a dining experience with such geat service! Thank you, Tim!"}
{"text":"Great expectations were quickly diminished. We made 6:30 reservations for a Friday night. With the winter weather Charlotte has had and anticipation for a busy night after the long week we decided to arrive early.  In fact, we arrived 45 minutes early and greeted with friendly smiles. We chose a less desirable hightop next to the computer.  We frequent fine dining, casual dining and quick dining with our two elementary aged children.  They politely order their own food and often complimented on their behavior by waitstaff and patrons alike. Tonight we arrived 45 minutes early to our reservations with intention of relieving the dinner rush and not have to feel rushed.  All went as desired with our cocktails appetizer, and entrees. We ordered dessert and waited over 15 minutes for it. As stated we were in no rush and the waitress apologized and proceeded with the the table side dessert presentation that was clearly not her responsibility.  She was perfect, but it kept her from servicing other tables. While the kids indulged on the build your own ice cream sundae, we ordered our own dessert.  We asked for our check and paid and while I finished the last of my glass of wine, the manager approached and prefaced with asking how our meal was. Before we had a chance to reply, his intention was obvious and he was actually requesting that we vacate.  He said he was behind in reservations and had a table of 13 to seat.  I casually and politely mentioned, we too, had reservations.  What would have been a great night out was tarnished. Had dessert been served on time, we would have fit into their 1 1/2 hr slot for a table of 4... and they wouldn't have had to rush us out. I politely made my point as he wiped down the table, and he offered another table and glass of wine. We declined as it wasn't necessary; however clearly, he didn't get it. Just made us feel like it was our fault not theirs...excellent food, excellent service, poor management in the end"}
{"text":"My husband and I braved the torrential downpour last night and headed back to Puck's to share some food.  They have daily drink specials (good ones; see my picture for a snap of the board) m-f.  Thursday is half price martinis and manhattans so they come out to be a little over $6. I opted for Tito's.  I had made a reservation for 745 on Opentable (getting those dining points) and we were seated promptly at a booth we saw open in the bar. New just like the vibe there sometimes instead if the main dining room. They also have a outside seating area too.  Last night we started with the calamari which are not the best in town but do like the pepperoncini mixed in and the tangy ranch type dressing to accompany it.  We split the yummy, cold PB house salad and the sweet fennel sausage pizza which you gotta try. We grill pizzas at home so it's hard to give us a pizza we love more than ours, but Puck's crust is killer; chewy and puffy."}
{"text":"This was our 1st trip back after a year.  The steak had no seasoning & arrived well done vs. medium well.  Didn't have time to send it back as we were going to a movie.  The frites not sure how they had all the color of that golden crispiness only to yield a the limpest French fries ever & where was the salt.  Apparently, it was on the side salad which had oil & salt.  I wish I knew what kind of salt it was cause it was tasty.  My chicken burger bun had so much butter I could not taste the aioli, the cheese or if it was chicken.  It masked the dryness of the chicken. Where is the magic one comes to expect from Wolfgang?  This is a fry cry from Spago."}
{"text":"Every time I eat here I kick myself for waiting so long in between visits, and today was no exception. I live in NoDa and Southpark many times feels like a whole other world, but I need to remember that this pizza bar is worth the trip!  There were 4 of is dining for lunch and we shared 3 appetizers: the rosemary thyme fries, Heirloom tomato salad and bruschetta. They were all delicious and flavorful. The salad was out of this world with delicious baby heirloom tomatoes and mozzarella so fresh that we actually thought it was a poached egg in the beginning. The bruschetta was also delicious and all the portions were generous.  I decided to go with their Carolina goat cheese pizza and added lamb sausage to it. Between the combination of toppings and the perfect pizza dough, this ended up being one of the best pizzas I have ever had!  They also have drink specials daily and a happy hour menu, which can help make this a very affordable meal out. I hope this experience will help me make the \"trek\" out to Southpark more often!"}
{"text":"Having attended the Yelp Elite event the night before, I really wanted to come back here and try other things. Oh, and I rushed out of the Elite event with OUT tipping the bar staff....which is a huge NO NO in Paul's book, so I decided to accomplish 2 wonderful things with this visit. Say THANK YOU to the wonderful Staff here AND have a great meal. Voila, I accomplished both tonight!  This is a really cool place. Nice friendly vibe, soft lights so I don't feel like I'm being interrogated by the SS. When I walked in the Hostess, both Bar Tenders AND the GM Greg all recognized me from the night before. Greg (GM) asked if I had a good time at the Yelp Elite event....I said Greg, duh, I AM back aren't I (in a funny sarcastic way). He laughed at my paultry humor and we had a very nice conversation. He seemed to REALLY appreciate us Yelpers, and was thanking me profusely on us getting the word out. Apparently they want to increase their marketing message as I told him, as other fellow Yelpers did, that \"Pizza Bar\" invokes an image ONLY of PIZZA! As all of us who've been here have noticed, this restaurant's menu is only about ONE THIRD that of Pizza! So WHY do they call themselves a \"Pizza Bar\" when they have SO much more? Who knows, but Greg did share with me that some of the other WP Pizza restaurants have re-branded themselves the WP Bar and Grill. Now THAT is a MUCH better name! Sounds casual (which is what they're trying to achieve) yet has the Wolfgang Puck name which invokes a higher quality (at least it does to me, having dined at several of his upscale restaurants out West like Spago). I said I hope that they change their name to WP Bar and Grill. We'll see.  OK I'm WAY off tangent....Sorry. Bear with me. So I'm in my work clothes and I'm enjoying a nice convo with Scotty the great bartender who took care of us Yelp Elites the night before, and he was SO appreciative that I came back to give him a tip. I know I didn't have to but that's just the way that I am. He EARNED it and I stiffed him. Reason #1 for being here accomplished.  So in looking at the menu, I immediately jumped to Steak Frites. Anyone who knows me knows that I am simply a Steak Frites whore! What can I say. I spent lots of time in Wine country, Montreal and in the larger US cities where this is very popular. So I just had to try it.   OH my was it good! I have to say that Georges is STILL my very favorite SF in Charlotte, but this is a VERY close 2nd! First off, they give you an UnGODLY amount of fresh cut fries, well seasoned with kosher salt and thyme (I believe). I couldn't stop eating them even after totally full....and I left a LOT on my plate after EATING a lot. You may want to share these fries....there is THAT much on the plate and you all know that PAUL CAN EAT!  The steak itself was delicious! Perfectly cooked medium as I asked, drizzled with Bearnaise butter served with some sort of dark sauce, like a Bordelaise only thicker. It's their version of a Steak sauce but INFINITELY better than any bottled steak sauce you can buy. Trust me on this. My French Sauce Chef brain engaged and I was dissecting it....asking how much veal stock was used, any demi glace, etc. ad nauseum. Who cares Paul, it was A-MA-ZING. Suffice it to say I snarfed every molecule of that sauce.....like in Austin Powers...\"GET IN MY BELLY!\"  Citizens of Charlotte - the secret is NOW OUT about Wolfgang Puck Pizza Bar...it is FAR FAR more than just pizza. It is truly a casual yet semi-upscale Grill/Bistro at modest prices that will have your taste buds doing the happy dance!   5 STARS all the way around...Ambience, Location, Staff, and most importantly, FOOD. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"}
{"text":"Ordered margarita pizza which was nothing great,the spaghetti was flavorless ,I wouldn't go here again,could have gotten something much better for the amount I spent here"}
{"text":"I read all the reviews for this place, so I was super excited to go Monday night.  Sadly, I was little bummed when I left.    The restaurant is set up nicely and it's absolutely beautiful inside.  I love the distressed wood, the cozy lighting and all the windows.  I also think the bar in the shape of a half-moon in the front of the restaurant is a nice focal point when you walk in; however, if you are trying to congregate with a group of friends at the bar, this is hard to do.  You can't really stand in a crowd because you are by the door- so people are constantly having to squeeze through to get to their seats.  But in some ways that nice because it's gives the restaurant a friendly feel. If my review were for ambiance only, it would have 4 to 5 stars.  The service was okay.  It was Monday night and it was not crowded.  While I was with about 7 people, the restaurant was pretty bare. For that reason, I don't think the service was anything to brag about.  The waiter was nice, but not as attentive as I believe he could have been.    As for the food, eh. The prices and quantities aren't bad, but I've had better pizza. We ordered the Prosciutto pizza, but there just wasn't a lot of flavor there. The over-reigning flavor was really the crust, which was slightly burnt.  My friends got the calzones, which they seemed to really like.  I also ordered the chopped salad, for the size, I do not think it is worth $9.  It was more the size of a side salad, yet only $3 cheaper than a pizza.  That doesn't really make sense.   Overall, I think I would go back-- I'm just not going to expect greatness.  The food isn't horrible, but it's also not great.  I really wanted to like this place, but sadly it's forgettable."}
{"text":"Yeah, no, just no.  If I had written my review a year ago it probably would have been 4 or 5 stars but this place just seems to have gone downhill so fast for me.    Let's start with the ridiculous amount of time it always takes to have a drink made.  If its incredibly busy I will give you a pass, but it wasn't and it took a good 15 minutes for them to arrive.  And the follow-up is if you want to charge $12 for a margarita, go for it.  But if you have the audacity to serve it in a 4 oz glass, I have a few choice 4 letter words for the person who made that decision.  They used to be bigger, but I guess someone decided since they are in South Park they can get away with that kind of nonsense.   Wine pours also seem very small, your best bet is just getting a beer, at least that is served in a decent sized glass.  So food.  I will say the calamari is still excellent and other dishes seem to have nice flavors but not always the best execution.  The pizza is just way too soggy, I mean you'd think they would be able to work something out to make it crispy but its just weak and ingredients will fall right off if you don't hold onto your slice tight!  The spaghetti used to be my favorite, so of course they changed it.  Its now served with chunks of tomato and an obscene amount of fresh parsley, as was the soggy pizza.  It used to have a light tomato sauce with a light parmesan flavor, there was no parmesan in sight so I added it  myself to make it edible.  The pasta with sausage bolognese was actually good but not really enough to make up for all the other shortcomings.    Service is just a joke.  My sister's boyfriend had to get up and find someone to get us serving utensils, also his drink was made wrong and the server was kind of arguing with him.  Yea he was a bartender for years and know his shit, don't argue with him, even better he's the customer don't argue with him!  So I'm done with this place, there are much better places in town for pizza and pasta!"}
{"text":"Nicest Addition to Phillips Place since, since... At first you may think, a Pizza Bar at Phillips Place???  When I found out it was Wolfgang Puck I was more incredulous... When I think of Wolfgang Puck I think Austria - Gourmet - Spago or even Frozen, (sorry that is what comes to my mind)!  This Pizza was plenty Gourmet as I hoped and expected!  Food - More than Pizza... I had Pizza!  Pepperoni (not exactly what they called it though that is what it was)!    Drinks - In the mood for a great glass of Wine, only they did not have any that sounded enough like Dessert... I had a Limeade... I did NOT see Limeade on the menu, I saw Limes behind the Bar and asked... They made it very well!  Service - Michael and his assistant were Great!  The Guys working the Front were great too!  They handled me well which is the Job for Professionals!  Decor - The place Looks Great!  Very Comfortable Seating, Relaxed environment!    The Flat Wear is Heavy the Glass Wear is Heavy too!  Glasses fashioned from re-purposed Wine Bottles... Inspiring!!!  If I wear a Kleptomaniac (I'm NOT, though I have known one) I would be taking the \"Dish Towel\" styled Napkins, small spoons (used here for serving Pepper Flakes and Parmesan), Water Bottles and all the Glass Wear (Minus the Stem wear)  Paul (NOT Koehler - I wish) was sitting at the Bar having a Beer or Two with his Pizza, that other Paul!"}
{"text":"There are a lot of good pizza places around Charlotte, and then there is this place.  Wow!  From the attention to detail in the design and layout of the place to the fresh and interesting ingredients in the pies, this place qualifies as GREAT.   The atmosphere is cozy and inviting.  It's kind of rustic/modern/earthy.  The dining room is decent sized but it fills up fast so I would recommend a reservation, especially if you have a group.  There is a huge horseshoe shaped bar at the front as well.  You can just feel the quality and attention to detail in every aspect of the place, from the tables and chairs to the cool glasses that appear to be old wine bottles that were cut off at the top and smoothed down.    On the menu you will find some classic favorites and some more interesting things as well.  We had a really great waiter who recommended the roasted mushroom pizza.  Holy crap, what a great call!  Truly one of the best pizzas I have ever had.  If you decide to give this place a shot, just order it!  As we were eating, the manager came around to see how everything was going.  We noticed him walking around to all the tables and mingling with everyone.  It just makes you feel good to see folks who take pride in their restaurant like that.    Although we did not partake, we noticed a gelato cart (never knew such a thing existed) was making its way around the dining room and it appeared to be pretty popular.   Nothing but positive things to say about this spot.  I am not very often blown away by a pizza place, but this one did it!"}
{"text":"The hostess was very friendly and the atmosphere was nice. Granted, I did not have a pizza which looked and smelled great, but the food was average at best. I was disappointed."}
{"text":"We weren't sure what to expect when we walked in but we're thankful to get a table! We started with salads (baby kale fore me, beet for my husband) and moved onto our individual pizzas. They are the perfect size (I even brought a piece home). I got the Carolina Goat cheese pizza which had roasted tomatoes and basil and my husband got the mushroom & truffle oil 'za. Both were delicious but I preferred his - it literally melted in your mouth. The bar area looks cool and inviting as well. The service is top notch with management stopping by to ensure your enjoyment. we will definitely be returning - just wish it wasn't all the way out in Phillips place."}
{"text":"I can only review the \"bar\" part of the Wolfgang Puck Pizza Bar. All I can say is that the mixed drinks are CHEAP. $6? Get outta here! I look forward to trying the food here at some point, too."}
{"text":"I have been here several times before and my visit Friday night was just as great as my previous times. The service at the bar is always attentive. Two of the bartenders have been there for awhile and were able to help us make our wine selection. I think Wolfgang has some of the best pizza in Charlotte. The dough is made in house and it goes through a multi day process before they use it. (I attended one of their cooking classes a few years ago). It's light and airy yet also holds up to the toppings. It's cooked in a wood fired oven so you get some that charred taste. I had the spicy chicken pizza, but I have also had their margarita, bbq chicken, sweet fennel sausage pizzas. All very tasty. I think it's a must try--you will love their pizza."}
{"text":"My fav pizza place in Charlotte. Good Pizza everytime, nice drinks/wine. I love the feel of the restaurant. Nice for dinner as well as 'day drinking' at their bar for lunch.  My favorite pizzas include the wild mushroom pizza (they put truffle oil on it!) and the margharita pizza. I really was disppointed with the salmon pizza...(I'm a newly introducing fish to my diet)..but my friends who love seafood/meat didnt like it either. I am disappointed that they no longer serve the fun breadsticks/bread or have the late night menu anymore...;-(  But...the pizzas/ambience are wonderful. I will go back; I'm sure of that."}
{"text":"Had dinner Friday night at 730. Very crowded. Crowd thinned considerably around. 830. Had a Caesar and mussels. Both very good, although mussels had a touch of smokiness. The crispy pork entree was nicely done. I had the Gemelli with fennel sausage, but this time it was  overwhelmed with smokiness. Never tasted like that before. We had a very good server that was knowledgeable and efficient. Easily a 4 star night, but for the smokiness that was introduced."}
{"text":"Being that this is a pizza bar, I probably should have tried the pizza.  But I tried the Gemelli.  The pasta is really fresh and done right.  The pasta reminds me of my summer in Italy. No boxed pasta, fresh, hand-made pasta is the best. And this place definitely makes fresh pasta.    The beer selection and drinks are also good. This place is worth giving it a shot."}
{"text":"I really want to give 5 stars, but I think I should go back a couple more times just to be sure.  I'd been wanting to try WPPB forever, but we just never made it there... til tonight.    The fella and I visited on a Wednesday night, and the place was full and energetic, but not loud.  I got there first and was immediately greeted; when I told the host that the fella was running late, he smiled and said no problem.  He seated me, and til the fella got there about 10 minutes later, I had two other waiters who welcomed me, thanked me for coming, etc.  That excellent service continued throughout the night with even the manager getting me more water.  I loved the atmosphere with the half-circle bar in the front and the tables behind, and the dark wood and lighting made everything feel very cozy.  I also loved the tree(?) made of wine bottles in the front!  Onto the food!  The fella and I split the grilled Italian sausage appetizer ($10), and it was delicious - the sausage was spicy, but not too spicy, and the peppers were sweet... mmmm.  The polenta was good, too, but I was too focused on the peppers.  Then we split a BBQ Chicken pizza ($12).  I generally love pizza and hate the crust, but this was the first time in a long time that I ate the crust - somehow, it was light and sweet.  The pizza itself rivaled my favorite bbq chicken pizza, and I was glad they added cilantro to it since some other restaurants don't.  I'm so glad we finally made it here, and I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Girls night out - dinner at WP! Hadn't eaten here in a couple of years, so was happy to go back! Although it was Restaurant Week, I chose to order off the menu. Started with the arugula & roasted beet salad. It was tasty, although it could have used more Marconi almonds. For my entree I had the roasted mushroom pizza which was earthy and delicious!  Pizza was \"floppy\" from all the toppings I guess, so I had to eat it with a fork.  Yummy leftovers for lunch!"}
{"text":"Very friendly server. Nice comfortable atmosphere. Baby kale salad fresh, healthy, and tasty."}
{"text":"Food is just ok. Wait staff constantly complaining at the bar about how managers are incompetent and customers can hear it. Drinks are small but salads are good. Split them, big and overpriced for 1 person. Mussels better at Upstream. Pizza ok."}
{"text":"\"Yeah, I think garlic bread would have to be my favorite all-time food. I could eat it for every meal. Or just constantly, without stopping.\" --  Scott Pilgrim vs. the World (2010)  What to say about Wolfgang Puck's - I go here a lot on my trips to Charlotte.  I always have the same waiter (Jared) and he takes excellent care of me.  I love a place you can really rely on!  By far, a must order is the garlic rolls.  Think savory cinnamon rolls - but instead of cinnamon, they roll those puppies up with pesto and garlic.  They bake 4 of them in a cast iron skillet and O.M.G - Heaven!  Ask for a side of marinara to dip them in (not that it is needed, but it adds a whole new level of decadence).    I've ordered their pizzas - always a solid choice.  My favorite is the prosciutto di parma.  Anyone who knows me is not surprised at all.  I had them bring me some balsamic on the side and used that to dip the crust.  I will say the middle was a little soggy for my preference, but still was not disappointed.  But on my last trip, I went for the braised chicken entree - think of it like a hunters chicken, or caccitore wanna-be, without the thick tomatoey sauce.  With brasied mushrooms, caramelized onions and little gnocchi all around it - it was absolutely scrumptious.  Earthy, but not to heavy.  I loved every bite and did my best not the lick the plate clean.    Even though I was stuffed to the gills (and had a togo box of my left over garlic rolls), I still got the zeppolis to go - one of their dessert items are these fabulous cinnamon doughnut bites with a side of \"espresso milkshake,\" which is nothing more than a fabulous dipping sauce.  This also lasts me two meals, but who is counting?  I never mind my frequent Charlotte business trips if it means I have time to hit up Mr. Puck's and visit my pal, Jared.  He also lets me read my book and we chat up our love to cook and read.  What more can you ask for in a neighborhood spot, especially when you aren't from the hood?"}
{"text":"The atmosphere was great and very energetic. The waitress was new or at least it seemed like it. She had a difficult time with the menu items and was late with refills however she was very friendly and her attitude was great.   I had the sausage pizza and it was very disappointing. The crust ends were burnt and the bottom crust was very thin and very soggy. It was so soggy that you couldn't even fold it. It just fell apart like a wet paper towel.   My wife had the fennel sausage pasta. The pasta was tasty and we both loved the thin breadsticks.   Overall for the money and the Wolfgang name and being a Phillips Place restaurant, it was a bit disappointing especially for the money. Our dinner was $41 including tax and tip. For that price there are way too many choices around Southpark for me to make a return trip (unless someone else is buying LOL)"}
{"text":"The outdoor patio is lovely.  The servers seemed very good.  The food was unimpressive.  We should have ordered pizza, but we weren't that hungry and our neighbor's pizza had a giant crust that was charred.  My son's kids' spaghetti with butter was loaded with black pepper.  My husband's salad would have been fine, but the added grilled chicken was undercooked.  The beet salad wasn't bad.  The special cold pea soup had raw shrimp on top (described as poached) and little pea flavor--way too tart."}
{"text":"Perhaps the pizza is good, but our dinners were not.  I had lamb (one of the specials) that was bland and cold.  I have never had bland lamb before.  Bozena had rosemary chicken in goat cheese alfredo sauce with pasta.  The pasta was not fresh pasta (if you're from the north east you know what I mean by \"fresh\" pasta [ex:  not hard pasta \"freshly\" taken out of the box, haha]), the chicken was dry in the middle (meaning it was frozen or not marinated) and the alfredo was watery, not thick, and had no flavor of goat cheese.  The mushrooms in the dish were good.  The chicken didn't even have the slightest hint of rosemary.  I know that Charlotte isn't known for its diversity in food, especially from foods from nations that touch the Mediterranean Sea, but this wa pretty bad.  As a franchise with Wolfgang Puck's name on it, I expected good food.  Perhaps the pizza is good.  The restaurant was also pretty empty for a Saturday night."}
{"text":"I genuinely like Wolfgang Pucks.  Place - trendy, nice, warm and cozy atmosphere. Definitely a place for casual outings and dinner/lunch with your favorite people.  Food - I love champignons! Well, mushrooms in French. So my go to pizza is always wild mushroom pizza. When I look at it, it looks healthy, but with carbs.. Well it isn't. It contains goat cheese which I typically avoid, spinach, and wild mushrooms. Heaven! I am not as fond of the potato sides - which is slightly saltier  Service - great! They tend to your need in a good amount of time. The waiters/waitress are attentive. The bartenders are very accommodating to which drink you want to be concoct.  Price - surprisingly decent!  The pizza was around $12 for a whole pie. The drinks (a shooter/shot) however - a typical NC price is $10.   I definitely am a fan of Wolfgangs! I like and enjoy the management who remembers us. I like the food and atmosphere."}
{"text":"ok, i've been here probably 15 times since they opened and every time my experience has been fantastic! check it out .  sit at the bar- order a ctail and pizza"}
{"text":"I gotta say this German know's how to make a mean pizza....  I'm a big fan of Wolfgang Puck's pizza joint, though it looks more like upscale bar/pub than pizza place. Every pizza I've had there is delicious, and I'm not a big pizza fan. The classic smoked salmon pizza is my favorite (little bit of sour cream, dill, layered on smoked salmon and a little bit of salmon roe on top). Some people might not call that a pizza, which is probably why I like it so much. I've also had their dinner dishes (pasta, steak, etc.) and they are pretty good too. It's everything you would expect from a casual upscale place from a celebrity chef.  Cocktails here don't disappoint either, and they have a pretty good wine list, short and sweet. The service hasn't disappointed yet. Whenever someone is craving a pizza, I take them here."}
{"text":"This place is really a 4.5/5, but that's just because of slightly rushed service (I went on a Friday night, so I'm not surprised the waiter wanted table turnaround!).   Anyway, this place is my new favorite pizza spot in Charlotte! I went with 7 others and we ordered a few appetizers and pizzas to share. Let's see...  Appetizers:  Meatballs - Delicious, moist, great sauce. Definitely would order again. Mussels - ehh...okay, but a huge portion. Beet salad - Amazing and not a skimpy serving of red and yellow beets. Proscuitto platter - Also delicious; very fresh ingredients and the buratta was AMAAAAAZING.  Pizzas: We tried the Wild Mushroom, Proscuitto (my favorite), Pancetta, and Lamb Sausage pies. All were amazing. The crust is thin and light below the toppings, but substantial on the end. It's cooked in a wood fire oven (I think?), so it has that amazing, crunchy texture.  I can't wait to go back to Wolfgang's - it's a great spot for lunch or dinner, and definitely has something on the menu for everyone. Yummmmmm!!!"}
{"text":"Ok we love Wolfgangs and its because of our 2 regular bartenders those guys are awesome. The grilled chicken caesar salad is awesome. Now lets switch gears a little. My wife and I average 2 times per week at the restaurant.   Lets start off about the pizza. Waaaaay to much crust i actually stopped ordering your pizzas although i love them because of this. There is enough crust there to make almost another entire pizza. Your appetizer of goat cheese is amazing, unbelievable, life changing.   Tonight we got take put for the first time ever. Epic fail is the only words i have. I ordered large casear salad cause we love it so much, a baked ravioli and spaghetti and meatballs.   Everything came in 1 bag, take out 101 dont put cold items with hot items in the same bag. I asked for an additional bag and the got me one. Large caesar came into 2 separate containers with only 1 crouton with goat cheese. Barely any shaved parmigiano and 1 small dressing. Needless to say below average and i know when i eat that salad there thats not how it is. We had no bread for our pasta dishes and no utensils not even napkins.   So here is my suggestion, if its a training issue for take outs thats an easy fix. The quality control or whoever is expediting on the line needs to make sure of the same quality for to go orders as eating inhouse. If its a company policy to do it this way then someone needs to run this up to Wolfgang himself for some changes."}
{"text":"Cooked, Corked and Poured featuring NODA Brewing Company!!!! What an evening! My first 6 star review. A totally incredible epicurean adventure. Cedric, the manager at Wolfgang Puck, and Andy, a brewmaster from NODA, were amazing hosts. Along with the hard work of the event planner and our two \"spot on\" waitresses, they made us feel like royalty. And of course, duh, who could forget the amazing chef who prepared all of the great food. The scene was set with a long rustic table to seat a party of twenty out on the winterized patio. Pops of color from giant zinnias on the tables. Rustic dinnerware and glasses. First up, half price signature cocktails. The Grilled Pineapple Mojitos were out of this world and the Limonatas had a sweet sparkly kick. Each course was paired with the NODA beer that inspired it. Baby Beet Salad with CAVU Blonde Prosciutto Wrapped Monkfish with Jam Session Coco and Malt Rubbed Strip Loin with Coco-Loco Porter Fall Spice Cake and NODA Gordgeous Gelato with Gordgeous-Pumkin Ale Before each course Andy would talk about the beer, its ingredients and manufacture. Intensely amazing food and incredibly delicious, crisp clean beers. A perfect evening in my book from the moment we got there to the moment we left. Bravo Cedric, Andy and all who made this a night to remember!  Can't wait for the encore!"}
{"text":"Great place. The brick chicken was spicy and great. Cheese plate was good too.  Great spot for business or romantic date."}
{"text":"Popped in here for dinner last night with friends.   Having never been I didn't have a lot of expectation and was pleasantly surprised at the decor first and foremost.   The interior uses a lot of repurposed wood and I always find that cozy and warm.  The large bar is immediately in front of the entry doors and seemed to be a popular spot to hang out, watch the game and have dinner.  On this night I had the baked eggplant parmesaen.  It came out in a little cast iron skillet and honestly was delicious.  The drinks were reasonably priced as well.  They also have great daily specials from what I read on the menu.  All in all it's a good spot if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Another well-known chef comes to town with a concept restaurant that angles for a specific niche in order to strike a chord with local diners.  Pizza Bar aims for the informal crowd with a mix of pizzas, pastas, and a smattering of entree meals to satisfy a diverse mix of folks.  Food quality and execution is quite good, but a current handful of service missteps keep this Puck from scoring a hat trick.  Interior is a mix of slatted dark woods, crates, and lots of glass.  It feels something like an old barn, an impression reinforced by the blue gingham shirts worn by servers.  Is this a trend now, since e2 uses red gingham?  My dining companion thought  the place had the feel of a Carolina Country Barbecue, slightly gentrified, and I agree.  Combined with high ceilings and rather loud background music, the ambient noise volume inside is loud and makes for difficult cross table conversation or communication with a soft-spoken server.  Overall jarring.  Beverages at Pizza Bar cover the gamut from some well put together cocktails to an intelligent wine list that breaks things down according to taste profile.  Several microbrews are available on tap and there are a handful of choices by the bottle as well.  One misstep, wine glasses are nearly indistinguishable from water glasses, especially in the low light.  Both are going for a \"sawed off\" wine bottle look with a punt in the bottom and slender, untapered look on top.  This is fine for water, but greatly cheapens and degrades the $10-15 pouring of wine in your other glass.  Not only does this put your hands around the juice (so much for that cold chardonnay) but also prevents any type of swirling or development of the nose of the product.  No problem for table wine, but not good for the up market offerings on the wine list.    Food, though, is the focus here and surely shines.  The spotlight is on the pizzas, proudly given top billing in the middle of the menu.  This is no make-your-own with monster slices good for sharing with the whole family.  This is an artisan dough that has a very developed flavor for the crust and is topped with an epicurean mix of ingredients to delight your palette.  From truffle oil and mushrooms to pancetta with chilies and roasted tomatoes.  You can get still more adventurous here: smoked salmon with dill, rock shrimp in chimichurri sauce or lamb sausage with goat cheese and eggplant.  Our tables' pizzas were all very well crafted and the flavors brimmed over the edges of a delightful crust that included a nice bit of char from the wood-burning pizza oven.    I've not yet tried the pastas or the entrees.  Most looked pretty traditional, obviously playing second fiddle to the pies, though there were a number of salads that offer some lighter fare to compliment the hardier 'zas.  At near-entree prices, however, they are not necessarily aiming for side offerings so much as outright meals.  The hostess station is also in need of some more practice.  Despite a reservation made days in advance, my party of 4 still waited nearly 20 minutes to be seated.  That's inconsiderate, especially since patrons without reservations were being quoted wait times of over one hour.  Strangely, though, my table stared at a couple open booths during the majority of our meal.  Clearly there are pacing issues here.    Our server also needed a bit of help, even though order delivery and table clearing is done via a \"team swarm\" method that is expedient and speedy.  Speed kills, however, as our server lost one of my table companion's left-over pizza meant for a take-home to the fam.  It got lost in the shuffle and presumably thrown away.  He promptly (and properly) ordered to make a fresh one, but having to wait again was not in the cards for us this night.    I'll return for the pizza alone, but I'll also avoid the wine and hope for an outdoor table on a less-crowded night.  More craft pizza is definitely welcome in Charlotte, but these service hiccups are distractions that need some time to work out."}
{"text":"Date night only comes once a week and with high expectations. With all the hype from friends and online reviews we decided to give WGP a shot.  The greeter chatted with us as she walked us to our table, pulled out a chair for me and told us about the drink specials. Our server, Eric came over shortly after and followed up with beverage request and dinner specials. We ordered the goat cheese app per his recommendation, the salmon entree, and side salads. Absolutely delicious.. Needless to say if we weren't in public we would have licked our plates.  Also as a former server, I did notice the fresh pressed shirts. It's so nice to see a clean staff!!!  Thank you WGP team for such a great date night!"}
{"text":"Impeccable service, and the food was fantastic.  Loved the pizzas, and the calamari was fantastic. Kevin, our waiter did a wonderful job, and I'd highly recommend Wolfgang Puck Pizza Bar!"}
{"text":"My group arrived last night to find Wolfgang Puck very busy. At first we were told it would be 8:30 or so before they could seat us. But then the manager asked us to wait a minute, \"let me see what I can work out.\" At that point someone went across the courtyard to The Palm and borrowed 6 chairs! We were seated outside and proceeded to have a very nice dinner. Kudos to Wolfgang Puck for ingenuity and kudos to The Palm for being a really good neighbor. The menu - interesting and different, the food - great quality and the service attentive in spite of the large crowd. I will return."}
{"text":"All of their sausage is made in house and makes for a great pizza topping.  The personal pizzas are the perfect size, with delicious toppings and one of the best crusts around.  I really like a atmosphere of this place....very cool decor and an overall good vibe.  It's also in the cheaper end for South Park. Tuesdays are half off bottles of wine. Wednesdays are half off cocktails...which were delicious but a little on the small side in my opinion."}
{"text":"The pizza is good (which is why I came back) but the service, especially in such a ritzy part of town, was not so great. I even went back a second time just to give it another shot and bought a gift card for a friend too but the service was still not good. We stood at the door a long time while the hostess was on the phone taking orders. My pizza never came out and I had to eat it by myself when it eventually did come. The calamari was good and so were the salads. Just wish the service was better, much better."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time for my birthday. The décor is lovely, with a lot of wood and metal and a cool bar in the center. We had a large party but our waiter was very attentive. The manager also stopped by every fifteen minutes or so to check on us.  My food was delicious! I ordered the apple-endive salad to start; it was delicious but I only wish there was a slightly smaller size because it was really too big to eat along with an entrée. It was delicious with apple, endive, arugula, and smoked mozzarella, very different but extremely well-balanced flavors. I ordered the goat cheese pizza. It proved to be a great choice, with goat cheese, tomatoes, mozzarella, and pesto. The mozzarella was amazing! But, the crust was really the highlight of the pizza. Everyone at the table ordered a different pizza but most exclaimed it was the best pizza they had ever had, a real testament to how delicious it was. The individual pizzas were a good deal, perfect for someone with a big appetite or who didn't order a salad but I was able to take home a slice which was wonder for lunch the next day.   I think this would be a great place to go with friends, as it isn't too fancy but has a really nice atmosphere. I will definitely be visiting here again!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were seated at a table with major traffic going on around us.  We had reservations and requested quiet seating.  There were several available tables.  We asked for a new table with less traffic.  The waiter acted offended by our request but asked management if we could be seated else where.  We were moved but they acted inconvenienced.  Wow, we were seated on a bench next to 2 couples that were extremely loud.  The general manager, Cedric Castro, stopped and asked how our evening was going.  We shared with him the noise level around us.  By the way, there were 2 empty booths next to us that looked quiet compared to our table.    Cedric explained the acoustics are terrible with large open areas.  But, next time I could ask for a booth.  By the way, when I made our reservations I requested a quiet spot.  And, there were 2 empty booths next to us that were not offered to us.  I received my meal.  The waiter failed to tell me they were out of kale.  they substituted lettuce and tomato for kale and added a ton of cauliflower.  I had this meal before and it did not taste close to my previous experience.  The waiter failed to bring my husband his wine.  We got lucky the general manager stopped by again to check on us.  He checked on our wine and brought it to us immediately.  It was waiting at the bar to be delivered.    The waiter never checked on us after we received our food to make sure our order was correct and if we needed anything else.  He admitted he knew they did not have all the  vegetables for my entree.  The solution, they wanted to give us free food and requested we come back again.  Look, I want a good positive customer experience.  I am not looking for free food.  Communication failed here.  We didn't get the seating we requested and they really didn't do much to fix it.  We were told it's a loud venue.  I ordered something on the menu and they didn't have all the listed ingredients but brought what they have available and never explained the difference.  I WON'T Be back.  Roosters, PF Chang's, Good Foods, Ruth Chris far exceed this place for customer experience.  I fired Wolfgang Puck tonight!  They really can't fix their problems and frankly they don't cater to folks looking for positive, quality, customer experience.  And, that's okay.  I want a quality customer experience.  This place is a cattle call!"}
{"text":"I love Wolfgang Puck!  He is a food genius and chef idol.  I was thrilled when we moved to Charlotte and found out he had a restaurant here.  We'd tried his restaurant in the MGM Grand in Vegas and we loved it as we love his Pizza Bar. We go here for special occasions mainly.  Their mushroom pizza is so delicious, I could eat it every week!  They have the best location, and the coolest bar and you can see the chefs cooking in the kitchen.  I love their water glasses.  Everything is perfect here, I strongly recommend the pizza, duh.  Their salads are also quiet decadent."}
{"text":"Today's visit was my 2nd lunchtime visit to Wolfgang Puck Pizza Bar. What a nice place to have lunch in the busy SouthPark area. The atmosphere is wonderful - refined but not stuffy. You can smell the wood oven the minute you walk in the door. I love the sound of everything on their menu. Today, I had their roasted beet salad with micro greens and added salmon. It was elegantly prepared - simple, clean and yummy to the last bite. While I felt like I was indulging, I was actually enjoying a very healthy lunch. My company ordered the spaghetti with chicken meatballs, and I was lucky enough to try it, and thought the flavors were perfect. The pasta texture was great, too. Chewy, al dente and thicker than your typical spaghetti noodle. One day when I make it in for dinner, I'll imbibe in one of their yummy cocktails or a glass of California wine from their curated wine list. I'm honestly surprised they aren't busier, but then again, the fact that they aren't super crowded is nice. :)"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Restaurants in Phillips Place. The food is always perfection! The staff is friendly.   My first time visiting my father and I ordered The Lamb Sausage Pizza and Calamari...AAAAMAZING! I've visited during lunch hour...Never busy.I typically order the same thing each time....creature of habit I guess. My Fiance says the Turkey Club is really Good and Filling.    Football Sundays aren't bad either....I heard there's a pizza buffet on Sundays ( I think) not sure if they still have this special."}
{"text":"Usually any time a world renowned chef's name is attached to a place, it makes me feel like you have to pay oodles and oodles of $$ just to step in the front door.  This isn't the case for WP Pizza Bar.... fairly affordable with many specials.    It's in Phillips Place so I would normally dress nicely to walk around there, but it's pretty casual.  Once, I thought about dressing up to see a movie in the shopping center there, but I thought better about it....  Low, dim lighting, modern casual furniture and clean lines make for an interesting dining experience.  I tried the roasted eggplant pizza which was made to order and was pretty tasty.  Our server was pretty nice, seemed a little rushed for a Monday evening.  She did a good enough job though.  Would I come back?  Yes... would I choose this place over my normal, \"go to\" pizza places?  That question still remains to be answered."}
{"text":"My wife and I come here often. She's partial to the wild mushroom pizza. I like to mix it up a little bit more and try different pizzas or even the pastas. It's a fun, casual place for dinner. The waitstaff is really friendly and laid back. The prices are very reasonable for food and for adult beverages. They have a couple of big screens to watch games and have the right atmosphere for hanging out too. I'm a fan."}
{"text":"I give Wolfgang Puck 5 stars for Sally, Scott, Brittain, & Brittany/Pippa (she counts as two)!    This update is because my hubby & I have enjoyed this bar & restaurant so much we've been several times.  The food is always delicious, the drinks & wine are top-notch selections and yes!  The bar crew make us feel welcomed and we love seeing how welcoming they are in general!    They are on show being right at the entrance & they make the most of it in a wonderful way!  Thank you Sally, Scott, Brittain & Brittney (if I didn't spell it right the first time, maybe this way works!) for your smiles and smiles of service!"}
{"text":"Amazingly, I don't believe I've ever written a review of one of my favorite places in Charlotte for pizza. This occasion demanded that I do so.  Usually, we stop for an early dinner or a late lunch. This was our first brunch visit and we each ordered something new.  For me, the first no pizza visit - instead, I had probably the best Roasted Turkey Club sandwich I have ever tasted. A very large sandwich, filled with excellent roast turkey and slathered with a delicious garlic aioli.  My companion had a Potato and Egg Pizza - yes, a Potato and Egg Pizza. Certainly out of the ordinary; but, amazingly delicious! Even though this is not on the normal menu, we ordered one a week or two later and they made it for us and it was equally good.  On previous visits, we've focused on the pizzas; the Margherita, Pepperoni Comodoro and Sweet Fennel Sausage pizzas are my favorites.  Without exception, the waitstaff has always been great and the bar staff is friendly, professional and make wonderful cocktails.  I always try to get a bottle of the Wolfgang Puck Cabernet Sauvignon which is moderately priced. The wine is one of my favorites and, best of all, a portion of the proceeds are donated to Keep Memory Alive, a charity committed to curing Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's, ALS and MS.  If you are from Charlotte, stop by this wonderful place often.  Visited May 2015"}
{"text":"I hadn't realized that Wolfgang Puck was opening a location in Southpark until a friend mentioned trying it before going to a movie at Phillips Place. Parking can be a bit tough on a busy weekend night, but once inside, the restaurant is inviting and low key with servers wearing checked shirts and Converse shoes. This is not a fancy place, but not somewhere to show up in your gym clothes. Wait staff seems to share the tables, so be prepared for multiple faces throughout your meal.   The four of us decided to start with a couple of appetizers and split some pizza in order to try out a few options. The garlic and white bean hummus was very good, but be sure to just order up additional toast points from the start as you'll definitely need them. We also had the calamari, which I was not a huge fan of in comparison to Cowfish, Fleming's or Capital Grille. All in all, I wouldn't order it again; the pepperoncini aioli dipping sauce was not to my taste at all. In terms of pizza, we tried the pepperoni, margherita and chicken & broccolini options, all of which I'd give 3/5 stars.   In the end, Wolfgang Puck seems to be trying to walk the line of being a semi-fancy restaurant with a low key menu, and I'm not sure they succeeded. Maybe once they work out some of the kinks it'll be more on par with what I was expecting. I will have to try it out again in a few months to see."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a little bit 'nicer' place for great pizza, this is your spot.  Be prepared to pay for it though.  While I would still tip my hat to full on flavor and freshness for the value to places like Mellow Mushroom, this is a great break from the norm for a bit nicer meal with your special someone.  We had the San Daniele Prosciutto app ($15) (burrata cheese, arugula, basil, aged balsamic (this one also had some fresh cantelope)) and it was fantastic!  We also ordered the Isole e Olena Sangiovese ($55) which was definitely overpriced for the taste.  I would recommend the Ciacci Sangiovese which is almost half the price and has better flavor.    The pizza was full of flavor and was thinner than I had expected.  It held together nicely and they were generous with the toppings.  We shared the Roasted Wild Mushroom which has spinach, robiola cheese, mozz and truffle oil.  It was delicious but I would recommend 2 pizzas if you are hungry.  They are full portion for 1 or you can share as we did, if you are having apps and dessert.  My bride ordered the Chocolate Cake and coffee with Baileys and I ordered the Fresh Berry Cobbler.  This course was a waste and I would recommend sticking to apps and pizza and maybe walking down to Dean & Deluca for a good dessert.  I think the desserts+coffees with one shot of Baileys was around $30.  The total bill was $121 + tip.  I would be choosier with the order next time because while it was fantastic, you could still have a great meal and dodge some of the expense.  For that amount of money, there are nicer meals you could enjoy in Charlotte.  We will return though because if the other pizzas are as good as that one, it's worth trying it and being smarter with the bill."}
{"text":"There's nothing I didn't like about this place. The best food I've ever had outside New Orleans.  We had the Pasta Fagiola (White Bean soup), Spinach and Arugala Salad (oh man! Never had a warm salad before), Flat-Iron Steak with the best roasted red potato salad I've ever had and Goat-Cheese Pizza (10\") with chicken and fresh basil. Out. Of. This. World! And ask for Alan to be your waiter when you go."}
{"text":"A must have is the spaghetti. The ambiance is great and the food is better. Don't order  more than you can eat unless your taking it home because sometimes I'm full before I get to my main course."}
{"text":"Really love this place! Great service and the food is good. The shrimp, goat cheese, and arugula pizza is a must have!"}
{"text":"Hidden behind the street-view shops in the back corner of Phillips Place, WP has graced CLT with a new concept that seems to be hitting all the right notes.  The concept: a casual Napa Valley-inspired pizza bistro and bar with Wolfgang Puck's meticulous attention to detail. Cloaked in dark, raw wood and plenty of wrought iron, it feels like a piece of Cali right here in the QC. The expansive bar greets you at the door, and the patio is very low-key and intimate. The staff is very welcoming and professional, in a casual and non-pretentious way, making for a great experience. Even as walk-ins on a Saturday night, we were seated in under 5 minutes.  Being \"Pizza Bar\", that's clearly the star of the menu. Deliciously crispy brick-oven creations with a gourmet touch. We started with the garlic rolls (baked in the cast iron pan they are served in...I'm starting to get into pot-baked breads, so this made my day) with chunks of roasted garlic. All pizzas are personal sized, and incredibly priced for a Puck experience. We ordered the chicken and broccoli and pepperoni pomodoro, the true test of a pizza place. We were wow-ed by the flavor and quality.  For those not as interested in pizza, there are also salads, sandwiches, and a few heavier plates (ie - steak).   A welcome addition to the Charlotte restaurant scene that I'm sure I will be patronizing again (and again)."}
{"text":"Amazing chopped veggie salad! One of the best pepperoni pizzas I've ever had.  Yummy chicken meatballs and spaghetti...highly recommend.  Start with warm focaccia bread, just ask your server!"}
{"text":"Not only was he a musical prodigy, but he grew up to open amazing restaurants as well?  Should change the name to Hurricane Wolfgang, because I was blown away by the food and service.  A rare 5 stars from me!  I came here with my sister when she was in town and we ate quite well.  Ordered a bunch of stuff to try and left with a loosened belt and lots of food to take back home.    You have to try to salad for app that has garlic dressing in it.  I've never had this dressing, but it's pretty damn amazing.  I was trying to think like, man, why is this dressing so good?  Oh duh, because I love simple pasta noodles with a good olive oil and some garlic.  Restaurant is really clean and server was not overbearing and fielded questions well.  Stuff like that won't necessarily \"make\" the place, but it definitely can \"break\" the place... it can also definitely put the cherry on top of a good dining experience.  [personal side rant] C'mon dmo, you need to up your review game.  Reviews are starting to turn out like my meatloaf--boring, dry, and not worth digesting.  Up yo game, son! [/end]  dmo out."}
{"text":"Very fresh as always with Wolfgang Puck. The only thing wrong was Caesar salad was a lemon drop. The bartender was hesitant to tell the chef when we brought it to his attention because Wolfgangs brother was in the kitchen for his annual visit !  No matter the other dishes were very good. Next week out daughter and 16 of her friends will come her for dinner before homecoming."}
{"text":"They now serve wine in white and red wine glasses.  They've update the menu which more yummy things and they've updated the little breadsticks to flatbread sticks that are gluten free.  Yeah Wolfgang!"}
{"text":"Puck knows Pizza. I've heard a lot of good things about Wolfgang Puck Pizza Bar but the stars haven't lined up until today.  The wife and I stopped in for lunch before hitting Whole Foods for some serious grocery shopping. I expected a crowd, but less than half the tables were occupied at a little after noon.  I'll start with the obvious, this place has great pizza.  My wife is from Connecticut and spent a lot of time in NYC, the Tigris and Euphrates of great pizza, and I have only ever had Charlotte pizza.  I say this is the best pizza I have ever eaten.  The wife won't go that far but says it's really really good.    Crust is king with these pies.  The waiter said it takes 9 days to make the crust and all that waiting and fermenting sure pays off.  This crust is ethereal.  Light, crisp, flavorful, substantial and airy, all at the same time.  Topping choices are myriad and, from what I've heard, all good. I had the red sauce pizza with pepperoni and sausage. The pepperoni was salty and good with a touch of spice and that classic, dry cured, Italian picante flavor.  The sausage was sweet, salty and spicy with just the right amount of fennel.  My wife got the white sauce pizza with lamb sausage and mushrooms.  The sausage was fantastic and the mushrooms had more flavor than the law should allow.    Dessert choices sounded good, if limited but my blood sugar wouldn't allow me to indulge.  The wife had coffee, which was fresh and good, and I had an espresso which was stellar.  Service was impeccable.  Attentive but not overbearing, just right. A little pricey, but not a place we will go every day.  Come to think of it, I just may go back tomorrow."}
{"text":"Step inside Wolfgang Puck Pizza Bar and you'll instantly feel as though you've been transported somewhere tres chic. It has the feel of a trendy New York or LA restaurant. Designed and built with recycled wood, this place is beautiful and eco-friendly. The servers are all nice and knowledgeable about their food and wine list. So far I've tried many things and EVERYTHING is delicious. Once I tried their seasonal gazpacho and OMG I can't stop thinking about it and craving it. Their pizzas are yummy, as are their pastas, and grilled dishes. Try the fries, you'll thank me later. As someone that has food allergies, its always difficult to find a place that serves desserts that I can try. Their fruit cobbler is wonderful, and I order it every time. Stop in and prepared to be amazed!"}
{"text":"I must just not be meant to go to this place. We tried coming here several times after they opened and always seemed to catch them before they opened or on a day they were closed.   Eventually we did get to eat here and the food was pretty good but, the staff was just OK and my potato and egg pizza had something hard and inedible in it. I didn't bring it up because it wasn't a big deal but, it shouldn't happen at a restaurant of the caliber this place is supposed to be. We told ourselves we  would give it another shot and we did that today.  We walked in and the host had a bit of a \"too cool for the room\" vibe to him, once we were seated I noticed my wife's glass was dirty, it had a clearly visible piece of food stuck to it. The restaurant was mostly empty, a few people at the bar and a few tables scattered here and there. So we were expecting someone to be along shortly. We sat there for a pretty good while, more than enough time to decide on drinks, meals, read the wine selection, look around, talk about what we were going to do after, start to discuss where we were going to eat if someone didn't come by in the next few minutes and even though several of the wait staff walked by, some multiple times, no one even said hello or stopped to take a drink order.  At this point we decided to quit while we were ahead and leave. On the way out they thanked us for stopping by and my wife decided to let them know we weren't really impressed. One of the staff followed us out, was very apologetic and offered to take care of our dinner which was nice but, I'm not looking for a free meal from a place I just don't want to eat at now. I really wanted to like Wolfgang's but, I'm pretty much done with it after these experiences."}
{"text":"Went last night for dinner. It was pretty good.   I had the shrimp pizza. I was turned off when it first came out because it wasn't very appealing to the eye. It's a white pizza and was just very...white, including the shrimp. Anyhow, the flavor was amazing but it was very oily. The oil kind of pooled in the middle of the pizza which I can see how that might turn off some people. Didn't stop me from eating it all.   My friend got the beet salad which looked awesome. She ordered the small and it was a huge portion. Tons of fresh looking beets, greens, oranges, goat cheese. She also got a GF pizza which she says is among the best in Charlotte.  Only downside is it cost $4 extra for a grand total of $19 for a personal pizza. Eh.  I like how their glasses of wine come in different sizes-6oz or 9oz pour.  My grand total was $31 for a personal pizza and a 9oz glass of pinot noir. Not what I'd want to spend regularly for pizza and wine but it was all really good and of course I always love the ambience, dim lighting of this place. Relaxing dinner."}
{"text":"My favorite place to get pizza in Charlotte.  We heard they are reworking the menu.  Remember your name is pizza bar, we love the pizza.  Service was good, but I disliked the small water glasses.  I tend to drink a lot of water with a meal especially in the summer and my glass was always empty.  Towards the end the server realized this and finally left the carafe."}
{"text":"WP Pizza Bar is a cozy and warm environment. The service was good overall. My dinner companion ordered the Argentinean Malbec wine in a carafe. It was good, but felt the the carafe was a bit small. I ordered the Agento Margarita made with Patron Silver Tequila, Luxardo Tripel, and lime for $10. It was in a small glass and didn't seem worth it.  They brought out Crispy Bread sticks. Interesting.We started with the Crispy Potatoes. They were good but could have been seasoned a bit more.   For our pizzas, we ordered the Barbeque chicken and the Roasted Eggplant. Both were delicious! We especially liked the crust. It was tasty and the right thickness, which was reminiscent of Naan. The roasted eggplant was pureed and used as the sauce. I had them add spinach, which was a nice touch! They brought out dishes of Parmesan and red pepper flakes. The red pepper flakes added a nice kick! We both had half of our pizza left, so we took it with us. Then we ordered the Lemon Sorbet and shared. WOW! What an excellent palate cleanser and great way to end the dinner!"}
{"text":"I've had a great experience both times I've eaten here. It can get pretty busy so the second time, my husband and I got there a little earlier and sat at the bar. It has a huge wrap around bar and the service was pretty good. I will say that the prices of spirits are pretty expensive but standard considering the area. I highly recommend trying to chicken meatball appetizer. My husband and I couldn't stop raving about it!"}
{"text":"Wonderful outdoor patio and no wait on a Saturday night! In the past, it has always been crowded and a wait, but this evening was different. The patio dining was wonderful, calm and the ceiling fans provided just the right amount of breeze!  The food was raving good too!  I ordered an oven roasted vegetable pizza. Yum. The hubby ordered a pasta and he was very very pleased. He kept talking about it all night.  I think the goat cheese made the difference!    My son ordered a pizza also and pronounced it one of  the best ever!   The crusts on our pizzas were photo-worthy, so I photographed them and included them in the photos for this restaurant. Be sure to check them out and you will be making a beeline to this place for dinner soon!"}
{"text":"This is definitely one of my favorite restaurants in the South Park area. Probably in charlotte. We have never had a bad experience with service, food, or anything.  Their seasonal pizzas are the best, especially the peach pizza! French fries are so good and once we had the chocolate cake and I died a little it was so good. The manager is always walking around making sure you are having a good experience. Always a favorite!"}
{"text":"Good Pizza, good selection of wines and cocktails, wonderful ambiance - what more can you ask for? This is my go-to spot for when I want a nice weekend dinner with the hubby or with friends. It's worth mentioning that their late night menu & prices are terrific. I'm a fan of their roasted baby beet salad, wild mushroom pizza and potato & egg pizza. You probably won't walk out of there thinking you've eaten the best pizzas ever, but because of the combined effect of the food, drinks, service and ambiance, you will walk out satisfied and happy, and wanting to come back soon to try another pizza!"}
{"text":"Had an amazing meal with a friend. Sat on the patio which was nice but the service was slow - it was the middle of the day on a Monday.. typically not a 'busy' day/time. Had the pasta fagioli soup, chicken meatballs, garlic rolls, pasta and calzone. Everythign was to die for except the chicken meatballs, they were eh.. but they were also chicken... the calzone was huge, the soup was very flavorful and well balanced, garlic rolls good and garlicky and the pasta (the one with the ricotta and broccolirab) was HUGE and had great flavor. They also do a late night menu which is a nice option."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza. Had the carolina goat cheese and ate every bite. Also tasted the margherita, which was also good. Pizza is on the thin side but with thick crust.... very good! Prices are reasonable too. Servers were all attentive and friendly. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This WAS my favorite pizza place in the US!!! Until they started making changes recently. They used to have an amazing happy hour, with discounted select pizzas and really great drink specials. Not so much anymore. They only offer a couple happy hour appetizers and they aren't worth it. The drink specials have suffered too. They also changed the cheese on their margarita pizza from slices of mozzerella (like real italian pizza!!) and changed it to your run of the mill cheese, like every other pizza restaurant. I used to go here like every couple weeks, and now I won't go back. Management- that was a bad choice."}
{"text":"Good, standard food. Good, standard drink. Good, standard bathrooms. Everything is good. Everything is standard. The decor is subtle enough to not get in the way, but not particularly beautiful. The special deals on Sunday are great, but it's not particularly great value for money otherwise. Basically, it's a good place to go if you want something reliable. And standard. It's always standard."}
{"text":"First time here and I absolutely loved it. It was soooooooooo good. We got the garlic and white bean hummus as an appetizer and oh my gosh... My sister and I took a bite and we literally widened our eyes and just looked at each other... It was soo ridiculously good there was just so much flavor like an explosion in your mouth. My sister got olde Mecklenburg seasonal on tap and I got natty Greene's seasonal on tap, both very summery flavors. Then we got a barbecue chicken pizza and holy s**t that was good too. It was drenched in sauce and it wasn't dry either the dough was so moist and soft it was delicious. And we also dipped out crust inside the hummus and wow... If you want good pizza you should come here it is a little pricy however it is well worth it. It was soo good we ordered a pizza to go for our parents."}
{"text":"I finally made it to the Pizza Bar ans was very happy with my experience. We started with the arugula salad which had a great hit of pepper. From there we enjoyed the crispy calamari, which was amazing due to the peppercini aioli. As for the pizzas, we ordered the pepperoni and the chicken and broccolini. We enjoyed both, but were definitely split, I enjoying the chicken and broccolini over the pepperoni. Overall, an enjoyable evening, however, the entire restaurant is very loud, and the parking was treacherous. I look forward to returning!"}
{"text":"Mixed reviews for Wolfgang Pucks. I've been twice and the first time I went it was great and had no complaints. Ordered a pizza and and specialty beer and had decent service.   The second time was a completely different experience. It was a Sunday evening and the place was not that crowded. My friend got there a few minutes ahead of me and the hostess said to wait until our whole party had arrived - party of 2 mind you. Once we were sat the service from our waiter was not bad. I ordered a pasta dish this time to try something different. It was extremely heavy handed with the spices.  The decor was nice inside. There is a huge bar in the center that has some large tvs which work for sports games. Looks to be a nice outdoor area as well.  Overall a bit of a mixed bag. I may give it another go sometime but not in a hurry to get back there. Hopefully these things were just a one off."}
{"text":"A terrific addition to the plethora of dining choices at Phillips Place. The Mr. and I popped in to try it out the first week they were open. Pre-grand opening and we were pleasantly surprised. Having had limited experience with a Wolfgang Puck concept (i.e. going to the WP Express in the Promenade once before it closed), I wasn't sure what to expect. I imagined something more fine dining, which isn't exactly my  beat. Fortunately, I was set at ease immediately by the attire of the staff -- nothing says, \"Take a load off, Annie\" like Chuck Taylors, blue checkered shirts, and jeans.   I was also amazed at the attentiveness of the management staff. They were quick to find us (it was a slow evening), introduce themselves, and offer fabulous service.   The food was good....not great, but it was clear that they were still fine tuning the selections available. I had a delicious wild mushroom pizza that was pretty good, except it was overly salty. An easy fix for next time. The same pizza exists in a slightly different iteration on the current menu, and it has improved from a salinity standpoint. Definitely a one-person pizza, as are all the pie menu items. I'd recommend ordering a couple and sharing, so you can experience all the flavors available. I hear some of the meat-laden varieties are delectable.  A lighter, and happily vegetarian option is the beet salad, which I would never have ordered until a friend ordered it and I found myself hogging the plate. Served with plentiful goat cheese, arugula and blissful marcona almonds, you really can't go wrong on this one. It's now my go-to for a veggie-friendly entree. I also love the breadsticks, which have continued to improve over the past few months, growing both taller and fatter, much to my delight.  Another clear winner is the cocktail menu. I could unapologetically sip on Lemonatas all night long, but I end up limiting myself to 2...largely due to the hefty cocktail prices and the fact that I'm a total lightweight.  Dessert is a qualm of mine, which is one reason why I can't manage to give 5 stars. It's just not the perfect, sweet punctuation to the meal. There are some good choices, and some mopey mediocre ones. If you must tack on a dessert to your meal, try the soda shop sampler, which offers gelato, small sugar encrusted doughnuts and an espresso milkshake. I don't know why they're still pushing other options. It's by far the best.  I appreciate this place, and go often, for a dependable cocktail and tasty dinner. It's by no means a WP flagship, but it's an accessible concept for people wanting a gourmet inspired pizza dinner or lunch in the SouthPark area.   **I also hear great things about the chicken entree. It's apparently the favorite among the kitchen staff. At a $20+ price, it had better be amazing!"}
{"text":"Very nice experience. Food was excellent.  Pizzas were delicious. Favs mushroom, margarita. Chicken broccolini was bland.  Calamari was awesome. Cesar was good too. Cobbler was delicious."}
{"text":"One should never judge a book by its cover or a Restaurant my it's name. With Wolfgang attaching his name to this place, I had placed it into a odd category of so so chains by a  chef that stamps their approval on but doesn't follow through. Boy, was I wrong. Stopping by a few months ago for a Yelp event, I was pleasantly surprised and made a note to come back and check this place out. My Mom sister and I visited WPPB a on a busy saturday evening. We  were seated right about and greeted by the friendly hostess and restaurant manager.  Settled in lovely phillips place, this restaurant is rustic, calm and quiet but still hip and fun. I love all the wood accents, edison bulbs and dim lighting. This is a great place for a date or in my case and relaxed evening with my family. On to the food... 1. Potato chips with the blue cheese sauce, freshly cut, and warm cheese 2.Goat Cheese Pizza 3. short ribs 4. Spaghetti with Tomato Basil  I can't give a description of everything, because it was all amazing. Warm and fresh, indulgent but not heavy. Well the ribs were a tad heavy, but I mean what do you expect?  Even my sister's plain Jane pasta, but anything but- the sauce was light almost like fresh crushed tomatoes and the noodles were cooked perfectly.  I can't wait to go back!  for a date night, summer drink whatever the case by be, this place has it covered.  Our waiter was on top of it, everything came out at the same time!  On a side note, I got a Moscow Mule- during the Yelp even and I'm still dreaming about it."}
{"text":"How have I not reviewed this place yet? It's one of my favorite new(ish) restaurants in Charlotte. Great atmosphere, lots of seating in the bar area. My favorites are the white bean garlic hummus app, spinach & mozz salad, and the wild mushroom pizza. You really can't go wrong because everything is good. JFYI, there is usually a wait so I suggest making a reservation or getting there early to miss the dinner rush.  Shout out to Sally, the best bartender in CLT!!"}
{"text":"Fancy pizzeria inside Phillips Place. The desserts were awesome. The pizzas were baked in a classy wood oven. The pasta were delicious. Service was great! I was wearing jeans and felt underdressed, but fortunately, they didn't care."}
