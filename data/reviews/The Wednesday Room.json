{"text":"The 60's lounge vibe is what Wednesday Room has going for it, it's a place you could come and hang out for a drink or two. And I stress that last part because holy moly are the cocktails pricey here! (~$15 a drink, we had the Perfectly Old Fashioned and Le Magifique)

We checked this place out after they had their soft open so didn't get the opportunity to try the food, although I've heard great things about it.

I'll have to give it another go, although with the competing venues that surround the area with late night happy hour Wednesday Room might need to step up their game."}
{"text":"Went with a group on a Thursday for a late lunch and everyone loved it (difficult often to please a group of 20 women). 

I had the fried chicken sandwich, which was terrific.  Came with a side salad and it made for a great lunch.  Everyone had something different and someone else commented that their salad was one of the best they've had.  

Service was excellent, prices reasonable.  I'd go there in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Update: I also sent the below to the management team as an email on December 29. I do receive an apologetic phone call today. At least that is a step to acknowledge the poor handling of the situation on December 22.

.....


I went to the Wednesday Room Friday December 22 - expecting a fun night out filled with of cocktails, good food and a lively atmosphere with a friend who I had not seen in months. We arrived early and as can be expected for a Friday before the Holidays the place was quiet, but the decor was amazing - if full I think the room would be lovely but not over crowded. Our server was very sweet if not a little over attentive asking about our food order numerous times (note: we met at 5 for cocktails). We eventually ordered 4 items off the tapas menu - all were delicious and well played, but they all arrived at the same time within minutes of our order with no comment from the food runner about what was being served. We continued to order bubbles and wine and around 7:30 our server came to us (shortly after serving us a drink) advising that a reservation for the table arrived and we'd have to leave. The restaurant was EMPTY there were at least 5 open tables at that point and at no time did my reservation confirmation or our server advise when we arrived that we had a set time limit (I do understand some busy restaurants do this but they usually give advanced notice). The hostess and the server \"shuffled some things around\" to allow us to stay and told us we'd have to leave by 9:15. We were done by 9:15 but there were still empty tables. As we left we overheard the hostess telling a walk-in that they were \"trying to kick some ladies out\". I cannot express my disappointment overall with the service -we felt unwelcome and rushed. I live inner city and regularly head out for food and cocktails. With so many great welcoming restaurants in this city I will not be going back to the Wednesday Room."}
{"text":"The Wednesday room is great any day of the week not just Wednesday. Awesome atmosphere, great food, wicked service, delicious food. 5 starts without a doubt. Great place for a date, Gf or wife. Coming back here again fa sho."}
{"text":"It was my second time on this place but still I couldn't give the full star! First visit we sat at the main floor bar, Bar tenders needs more exposure to different mixes, YES!. My friend ordered cocktail which she emphasize \"no strong\" and she end up having old fashion.I laugh! Second time I came ahead of my group and was seated at the basement and gezzzzzz server wasn't attentive. Saw them chit chatting at the bar counter while I was trying to catch their eye to order something to drink and saw some table were waiting the same. They miss the \"Check and Chat\". I'm a lover of an old time music but theirs so dry."}
{"text":"This place is cool. Just came in for a cocktail, As this spot was recommended by a bartender at the Unicorn Superpub. I think our server's name was Russia and she was a sweetheart. The cocktails were really good. Nothing I've ever had before. I had the Red Rum and my date had The Traveller (suitable for us as we both love traveling and are visiting Canada for the first time!). On some random notes, I really love the ceiling tiles and the smell of the bathroom soap! A few others guests shared the \"fireplace\" setting with us and they had ordered some food and desserts that looked fantastic. I would have liked to order something sweet, but I was full from dinner that we had at Unicorn. I recommend this place if you're looking for an intimate cocktail with a date, or quiet setting with a small group of friends."}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere. The head chef Derek Wilkins is a wizard! So much creativity and passion with every dish. 

Definitely recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at, \"The Wednesday Room\". The set up is really nice and classy. I had oysters, the tuna rice cakes, bone marrow mashed potatoes, and the Atlantic char. The rice cakes were tasty but a really small portion (4 pieces about the size of a loonie). Mashed potatoes were out of the box. The Atlantic char was delicious, although I wish it had more flavour. The server didn't know anything about the food when we asked. No one asked us if the food came out okay or if we needed anything. The waitress was cold and rude, and stormed off without a word as we were paying our bill. Worth checking out but probably won't be going back."}
{"text":"Working outside of the core, I have to admit I'm pretty out of the loop when it comes to new, happening places. So, when it came time to find somewhere for drinks, I relied on social media to guide me in the right direction. Was I ever surprised at what I found! 

Stylishly decorated with a 60's influence, there are two levels in this lounge. On the first level, seating and tables are tucked behind walls and shelves, creating a sense of intimacy despite being small and fully visible from the front windows. Sprinkled throughout are cleverly placed, hype phrases designed for the tech-fluenced millennial set (myself included) to photograph and tag. Downstairs, the intimate and 60's lounge feel persists with the addition of an exposed brick wall. Bench style seating extends down the perimeter of the space with tables and standalone chairs. Space is designed so that small and large groups can congregate in the same area with a good amount of mobility. In my opinion, the best part is the noise level of the music. On all occasions that I've been, it is upbeat enough to generate good energy, but quiet enough so that you can have a decent conversation. Service has also been friendly and prompt and drinks are good. I can't speak to the food since we've never eaten but, atmosphere and drinks alone is five stars for me. One thing noticeably lacking from TWR is the typical douche-bag set (which is probably what has made the whole experience more enjoyable). Whether they're at surrounding bars, more ostentatious lounges or just simply haven't discovered TWR, I'm happy they're not there! 

To note, I've only been here on Friday evenings for drinks only. I can't speak to other days of the week and for food but, will most likely try it out again based on the good experience so far."}
{"text":"New place that opened recently on Stephen Avenue. Great food, drinks and staff. Reminiscent of the movie \"The Shining\"

We had the Polenta chips and charred Cauliflower as appetizers: the Polenta chips had a very nice crunch and a flavourful dip that was a nice accompaniment. The charred Cauliflower was literally a huge head of Cauliflower. Sounds simple but oh so delish. Definitely recommended for herbivores and carnivores alike.

For our mains, we got the Pasta Pljukanci (try saying that ten times fast), and the Risotto. Both dishes were very rich.

Would definitely come back again to try other items on the menu."}
