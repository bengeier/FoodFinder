{"text":"Good food.  Good sushi. Good price.  Very happy with service.  Will definitely return for weekend buffet"}
{"text":"The food is awesome, the bar is clean, and there is a lot of variety to choose from, 5 stars. The cleanliness of the dining areas? Less than subpar. I've been there twice now with friends, and the carpet was absolutely filthy. The decorations were super old, dusty, and they made me want to not eat under them for fear of all that dust falling into my food. Fix that and it would be my absolute favorite."}
{"text":"Was good when opened
Now carpet is nasty and fake vines have dust caked on them
restrooms are nasty. Food is typical Chinese buffet. No better than any other China buffet"}
{"text":"Great food. Nice decor. Very satisfied, but one in our group may have overeaten or overdosed on MSG. 
Lots of variety including Hibachi Grill. Ice cream is 'real' using a scoop and not the generic soft serve. 
Music loud enough to keep conversations private. And TVs in dining area for those who can't unplug. 
Price varies by time and day but generally reasonable. 
They have Mac & Cheese and some basic dishes for the less adventurous. Enough choices for everyone. Convenient strip mall location near Kroger and Wal-mart."}
