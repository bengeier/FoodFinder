{"text":"My wife and I arrived about 7:15pm.  We were sat immediately and our waiter appeared shortly after.  He took our drink order and dropped off chips, salsa, and I believe a spicy sour cream dip.  The drinks arrived quickly and he took our food order.  The chips are thick and they were good as was the salsa.  We weren't sure about the sour cream stuff.  My wife ordered the steak fajitas and I ordered the Carne Asada tacos. And then we waited....and waited....and waited....it took about a half hour or more for our food to arrive.  My wife ordered hers with no lettuce and no guacamole.  They serve those items with the beans and rice.  The plate arrived with both and she told the waiter who said he would take care of it.  He was back quickly with a \"new\" plate on which they had just removed the wrong stuff and replaced it with sour cream.  We were unimpressed.  Also not too many of the items come with cheese.  My wife had to ask for a side of shredded cheese.  The Carne Asada was seasoned ok and there was plenty of vegetables and meat on the fajitas.  The beans were very runny.  Overall it was just an average experience.  The I don't think we'll go back.  We will stick with Abuelo's.  Maybe your experience will be better?"}
{"text":"Great place! I ordered a vegetarian plate, and sat outside on a really nice evening. Food was delivered incredibly fast. Price was very reasonable, and food was authentic. Planning to go again sometime soon!"}
{"text":"Great food, my family and I loved the generous portions of good quality and authentic Mexican food. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner with my husband. We both had Fajitas, I had the Veggie, he had the El Patron. We were blown away by the amount of food we got. The veggies were fresh and the entire meal was good. We also have enough leftovers for at least one more meal. Service was good and the place was pretty busy."}
{"text":"Excellent, authentic Mexican food. House burrito was awesome! Chips were tasty. Service was also very good. My family of 5 was well fed and enjoyed every bite. Muy Bueno!"}
{"text":"My daughter and I were there last night.  The service was good, food just average.  The reason I gave them one star is because we both spent the night in the bathroom with stomach issues. We are both otherwise healthy.  Don't think we will be back again."}
{"text":"Very good seafood burrito. The cheese sauce on the burritos is very tasty. Excellent guacamole. Comfortable atmosphere. Has a bar and patio seating."}
{"text":"I've eaten here before.  It's the only Mexican in SP.  I really don't have any complaints.  Last night, we decided we wanted Mexican carry out but realizing it was Cinco de Mayo until right before we called to order.   I must have called 15 times and let it ring.  (Sorry El Patron).  I figured they were out of business.  We decided to drive past El Patron to see if they were really closed.  When we drive past, they were packed!!!  The outside dining area was full.  So I'm happy to hear they are still open but I wished they would have answers their phone!!"}
{"text":"It's a shame when the best thing I can say is it was clean and well lighted. The reviewer that said \"mediocre\" was, in my experience, more than kind. While I'd love to find good Mexican food in the area, I can't even call this good Americanized Mexican. It's just plain bad. Thinking I might have been mistaken the first time...every place has a bad day...I went back.  The food was just as bad, but time the service was I inattentive as well."}
{"text":"El Patrons fajitas for two enough food for 3 to share and still take some home.  Very attentive service, food has always been nothing but incredibly tasty."}
{"text":"Froze today cause we got there right after they opened & no heat yet!!!! Talked  to the waiter about it being freezing & he didn't understand what i was saying. Chips tasted slightly rancid which is not the norm...I hate when the waiter can't understand a word you say to him... Helllllloooo, this is America not Mexico, I want the wait staff to understand me & speak English to me!!!!!"}
{"text":"We went here earlier this month for my mother's birthday.  Service was great, very attentive servers.  My mother had the enchiladas and she really liked them.  My wife had chicken fajitas and the chicken to veggie ratio was way off.  The veggies (onions and peppers) were cut in large chunks instead of strips, which was kind of a turn off.  She said it had good flavor, just wanted more chicken.  I had the saddest chimichanga ever made.  I was looking forward to a crunchy delicious dinner and this soggy, greasy mess was placed before me.  I don't know if the fryers weren't hot enough, or if the oil needed changing, or it wasn't cooked long enough, but it was pretty gross.    We also ordered a chili relleno as I've never had one and my friends always recommend it from other places.  I figured we'd split it amongst ourselves.  It was a soggy, gloopy, greasy mess.  My understanding is chili rellenos are supposed to be crispy and crunchy on the outside but this was gross.  I had 1 bite and sent it back.    We had high hopes after hearing other people rave about the place, but I can't recommend it.  Save your money, make the trip to Madison and go to Taqueria Guadalajara."}
{"text":"I love this place !   I eat here quite often.  I have had probably fifteen different dishes and haven't had anything I didn't like.  The food is always fresh with very generous portions.  The staff is always friendly and attentive. The inside of the restaurant is clean and nicely decorated.  The patio is fun , especially on weekends that there is live entertainment. I do wish they with would clean up the grounds a bit.  Cut the weeds around the building and pick up some of the paper trash that has blown in.  A couple of junked vehicles in the parking lot don't look too good.   Keep an eye on your bill, they can  make some small mistakes on the calculations.  Even with some of the short comings I still give El Patron 5 stars just because I love the food so darned much !  Delicious....."}
{"text":"A Bucky Book coupon brought us to El Patron and we are thankful for the cut in our bill. While pricing is spot on, you're better off with a stop to Taco Bell. Our entrees were greasy, flavorless  ground beef piles. I had hoped that adding salsa would save it, but alas that was tasteless as well. Save yourself the trip and possibly a night of indigestion."}
{"text":"Wonderful Mole that is very authentic.  This is hard to achieve but it is done extememly well at El Patron.  Carne tacos were also top notch.  I really liked the rice.  The flavor was fresh with many layers of seasoning.   Margaritas were killer!  Prices and services the best we've encountered in years.  It was so nice to be greeted warmly and then served outstanding food.  Thank you Antonio and the staff at El Patron!"}
{"text":"I came here for the cheap margaritas and tasty Mexican food. I feel like I got one out of two. Cheap margaritas in an assortment of flavors, not so tasty Mexican food. I got enchiladas with mole sauce and the sauce was VERY sweet and did not mesh well with the enchiladas. The hot salsa was incredibly spicy, but lacked flavor. It was like chili oil. Service was decent. I would be willing to give it another try though. Maybe try the fajitas, one of the people I was with got them and they looked pretty awesome."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. I like going I. Friday nights, they have a Mexican band they play very good music great selection. Last time they had two players and they also played other music. It was a lot of fun went with a group and plenty of margaritas so tasty.  I like all the dishes especially their rice."}
{"text":"Do not let the rough exterior of the building fool you. We received excellent food and service when we went there.  The menu was quite extensive and even included a vegetarian section. I ordered one of the vegi combos which included a quesadilla , tostada, and enchilada. The quesadilla was good (although thats pretty hard to screw up), the tostada was especially yummy with super fresh and green lettuce, a delightful guacamole, cheese and beans. The sauce over the enchilada was tasty and not too over powering the beans inside which were perfect. I always judge a mexican restaurant by the beans and salsa and this place gets a 5 star on both those fronts. Yum Yum!!!  My husband ordered the veggie Fajitas and it was so huge that we really could have shared it and plan to do that next time. The seasoning was spot on and the veggies were cooked to perfection. Carrots, bell peppers, brocoli, onions, potatoes and more were included in the mix. There was a ton of onions and green peppers but their was also a ton of all the rest of the veggies so that made up for it.  My boys split a kids menu item of a quesadilla and fries and were very happy with it. The wait staff was all extremely attentive, friendly, and informative. We were going to order just two meals and share with the boys (they are only 1 and 3 years old) but the waiter informed us that kids meals were free on Sundays and urges us to take advantage of the deal. The refilled our drinks and checked several times to make sure we were doing good and had everything we needed.   I generally felt that they appreciated the business and worked hard to please us,    Im a happy customer and cant wait to go back and try out the Lunch Menu!!! I'm really puzzled as to why the other reviews are so poor for this place, maybe the meat options aren't as good but the veggie ones are great!!"}
{"text":"We've been here twice and there is consistent quality.  The service was great but the sangria was better!  I also enjoy their salsa.    I do have one suggestion, though.  PLEASE put some kind of sign on the road??  The exterior is pretty nondescript and easily passed by!  Especially since you have to turn into the road before it to enter.      Also, it's a little cheesy that you left the plastic wrapping on your newly upholstered leather chairs.  I'm allowed to do that in my dining room, you're not! :)"}
{"text":"The service here is fast (not very friendly, but fast at least) and the food is cheap. Not the best Mexican restaurant in town, but it'll do. They do use a lot of lettuce fillers though so actual food portion is small (at least those entrees i've ordered)."}
{"text":"Only giving it 3 start because the food is good but not consistent. It really depends on who is cooking that night.  Not the best Mexican I've ever had but not bad for northeast oh. Good family place."}
{"text":"What a nice treat! We had lunch today and really enjoyed ourselves. The food was overall a good meal BUT I did not like getting only 3 shrimp in my shrimp chimichanga. Nor did I like having broccoli in it. Had I known they put broccoli in their food I would have had it left out.  But again it was a good meal and I know what to order next time."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a business lunch today. Quick service. Chips were fresh and salsa was great. Coleslaw served with the chips? Never have o seen that before. It was ok. I had the fajitas. You can't beat it for 8 bucks, but the meat was a little tough. My colleagues all seemed to enjoy their meal."}
{"text":"I have no clue whatsoever what the bad reviews are for on this place. Taco Bell is better? Poor food? Did those reviewers and I eat at the same restaurant?  I'm a huge fan of anything with mole sauce. I ordered the Enchiladas Poblanas. They were on par with some of the best I've ever had... warm, a hint of spice, lots of chocolatey goodness. The rice was fantastic, the beans were smooth and delicious.  My wife really enjoyed the #6 lunch special, which was two chicken enchiladas, rice and a salad.  This was our first time here and based upon the food quality, we'll definitely be back. The price is typical, perhaps a smidge higher than what you'd find on the west side of Madison. We are in the process of moving to the area and are thrilled we've found a fantastic Mexican restaurant.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"This has been my husband's and my favorite date night spot in town for years. I am not sure what has happened, but I am not certain we will go back. The past two visits my husband's chimichanga  has been made incorrectly and the last time it was wrong twice. He ate the second one just to avoid holding our families meal up any longer. The chimichanga it's self is now smaller, almost half the size it use to be.   I typically get the tacos de carne asada which is fair, but the meat seasoning has changed and is bland, the sauce that goes with it though is spicy so it adds so flavor.   I hope they pay attention to their reviews, it is saved that this restaurant is not as good as it use to be. Just to add- We often go on week nights after the dinner rush when the restaurant is often near empty so there really is no reason for the errors with the food."}
{"text":"Sad that I had to give 1 star, because I've been here two times before and had decent experiences (slow service, waiting long periods of time for waitress, getting our order wrong, but the food was good.)  Anyway, I came here on a Sunday afternoon with my sister, not busy. When we entered there were 2 staff members at the register & neither of them greeted us until we had been standing there for about 3-4 minutes. The staff had been looking at something on their computer screen, so that's why they were distracted.  We were seated after those few minutes & at first everything was fine, until I noticed 2-3 giant flies buzzing around our booth and at our window. Our area seemed dirty in general- lots of dust and crud on our window sill, which is also connected to our table. I couldn't use my knife because it was dirty, and I didn't drink any of my drink because my cup was dirty & had a ring around it (on the inside, disgusting!)  The waitress took our order & our food came pretty quickly, which was nice. The waitress did not come to check on us- to see how our food was, if we needed anything else, etc. She disappeared. We ended up waiting 15 minutes for her to arrive back to our table- guys, she never came back. I had to go find her!!  One other thing I noticed is that the staff seemed like they didn't want to be here. Even one of the staff was sitting at the open table FaceTiming a personal call while working.   The food was pretty ok. I won't come back."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic!  The shrimp tacos are outstanding!! Nachos are very good. The service is great! Love their margaritas!"}
{"text":"I always try to go here for seafood plates, and my husband usually goes for chicken burrito suizo or something similar. I've enjoyed the Seafood \"El Patron\", Enchiladas Acapulco both of which are yummy but not much heat, or melding of flavors- but the Seafood Chimichanga is great. It's just a lot of food, so be careful on eating those chips. My husband has not found a bad tasting plate yet for chicken. We also order a side of guacamole and helps round out our plates. The price is right for us here, and it's close to home. It's worth a stop if you're looking for a good deal of food and great taste."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Saturday night for dinner with the family.  It was good, but I have had much better at other Mexican restaurants.  It appeared that they were busy, but we were seated right away at a table rear the back of the restaurant.  The restaurant could use a little repair.  Many of the booth seats had cracked seats that exposed the foam cushion.  The decor was your normal Mexican-American theme, nothing amazing but nothing dreadful.  When we got there chips, salsa and an odd white sauce were on the table already.  The chips were ok and the salsa was pretty good (although it could have used a little salt and more heat).    I ordered the \"Don\" burrito with steak and a chile relleno  It was a large burrito with steak, rice and beans.  It also has a cheese sauce and tomato sauce over the top.  Served with guacamole, lettuce and tomato.  The burrito had good flavor, but could have used more sauce on top.  The chile relleno was the saddest, greasiest mess I have ever seen.  It had no flavor and spewed grease when I cut into it.....definately not worth $3.95!  I also ordered the regular margarita on the rocks.  Good flavor, good amount of booze and it was cold.  My wife ordered the fish tacos.  She said they were \"alright\" but had that distinctive fishy smell and taste that comes with either low quality or not fresh fish.  I didn't hear her order otherwise I would have steered her away from them.  My 4 year old daughter got a quesadilla with rice.  She loved it and ate everything on her plate.  All in all, if you are careful on what you order and your expectations aren't super high, you should be ok at El Patron."}
{"text":"This would have been an awesome experience, great food, great Drink but then a smoker lit up outside and it blew in our face"}
{"text":"Our first time there.  Walked in, it looked nice.  First sign something was amiss is that there was no soap in the women's restroom.  I told two staff about it.  No one did anything about it.  Okay, fine.  Minor issue.  Joined husband at the table.  Chips, salsa, and a white sauce that looked like ranch dressing was on the table.  Chips were not fresh.  Salsa tasted like cilantro water with some onions in it.  Still not sure what the white creamy stuff was supposed to be.  Our food arrived.  I ordered combo 19: chicken burrito, chile relleno and beans.  I have never seen such a sad looking chile relleno.  Flat.  Cheese?  Unsure if it was even there.  Gobs of grease poured out of it when I cut into it.  The grease flooded my plate.  The chicken filling of the burrito was tasty but otherwise the burrito was unremarkable.  The beans were very bland.  Some hot sauce helped perk them up enough to make them edible.  Thankfully this plate of misery cost only $8.95, but even that was too much to pay for this kind of ick.  The second star in my rating is for the attentive waiter.  He sure did try."}
{"text":"Magnificent!!!! My new favorite Mexican Restaurant. The service was friendly & fast. The chicken soup was a meal & my cold seems to have left me. YUM is all I have left to say."}
{"text":"Quick, friendly and attentive service. Good was good portions and tasty as any Mexican restaurant I've been to. Good tortillas and salsa. I'd go back for sure."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of stopping by El Patron one wet Tuesday evening. The place was dead, which was ok with me. As we walked in were greeted by 3 people at the hostess station. They sat us down and brought out some very good chips and salsa. I ended up ordering the Quesadilla Rellena. It was good and it came with one beef Quesadilla and one chicken Quesadilla, The beef one was a bit greasy for my tastes but the chicken one was excellent. My fiance ordered some El Patron dish I don't even know what it was called. It looked almost like enchiladas maybe? It was very tasty. Service was good and they brought food out rather quickly. Prices seemed fair and they even have an offer in the Bucky Book. We would make the drive from Middleton to Sun Prairie for this place, again."}
{"text":"Best meal I could have had before getting my wisdom teeth out today. I had the El Patron which included shrimp, chicken, and steak fajitas and it came with a cheese quesadilla. Soooooo good the margarita was strong can't wait to come back at a later date.   Definitely need to have an adventure with other flavors of margaritas. Summer is coming!!"}
{"text":"I'm from Detroit, so have many excellent Mexican restaurants. Compared to them, this is a 2 or 3 star, few notches above Taco Bell type place.  But in Middlefield, it's decent.   Staff is fast, friendly and attentive. No fine dining training, more catering hall type service. Food comes out very fast and all at once. Decent decor and clean, but for the bathrooms.   Food: almost authentic Mexican, few notches above Taco Bell. Fajitas have broccoli. Really?  Everything seems pre-cooked and just re-heated. Edible, tasty, but kind of more akin to upscale cafeteria food.   Drinks are huge. Prices decent. I come back here every 2 years or so when in town. About the same each time."}
{"text":"El patron is not a very good choice when you are going for Mexican food,the variety of dishes is poor the staff is worse.Waiters    with no skills and very poor English to rations that are way too small and overpriced food is Mexican enough for the all white clientele that dares to go there pitiful and pathetic half star is more likely."}
{"text":"Very decent Mexican food. Staff is usually pretty friendly. And,... it's the only game in town.  If you see more than ten cars in the lot then pass it by. Service gets really bad when they get busy."}
{"text":"We're impressed!  Not just because it's in cusp-of-Amish-country Middlefield, Ohio but because the food and selection go beyond just the standard burrito/enchilada/taco 10-item menu you can find at many Anglo-Mexican joints that call themselves \"Mexican\".  Multi-panel menu offers quite the variety of choices.  I find it similar to Senorita Bonita's in Solon about 25 miles away.  Granted about 80% are variations of the same ingredients (beef, chicken, and beans) and presentations (burrito, enchilada, taco, fajita, chulupa, chimichanga, etc.).  But there are pork, fish, relleno, verde, ceviche, and adobo choices as well.  It was \"99-cent Taco Tuesday\" so the wife got 2 beef tacos ($0.99 each) as appetizers and she said they were filled nicely and tasted really good (they didn't skimp on quality or quantity).  I ordered the ceviche appetizer ($6.00) which was surprisingly delicious/fresh and quite a lot on the plate!  In fact I was very impressed with our server when he advised it was taking a while because they were making a fresh batch (other places might've just pushed something near expiration on us just to save a few bucks).  We appreciated this greatly.  We ordered the enchilada rojas ($10.00) and the lomo en adobo (pork adobo, $13.00), both of which were quite delicious.  There was also too much to finish in one sitting!  Menu includes an assortment of beers, lime and other flavor margaritas plus desserts.   Some bizzare things can be found on the menu probably based on the area clientele more so than chef specialty.   Sandwiches, fries, broccoli at a Mexican restaurant?  Anyway, Middlefield's El Patron is a restaurant that has me craving to return to try the other things on their menu - both the special and common entrées!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service, awesome margaritas , good prices! I got the grande burrito and it was excellent, the fajitas are good too. Specials on margaritas Thursday night got a Small for two bucks. Food comes out super fast. Prepare to be surprised when you see how low the bill is for a meal this good!"}
{"text":"Terrible is all I can say.  Service disaster area.  10 minutes before noticed at check in area.  10-15 before anyone at table.  Chips before drinks. Greasy stale tasting chips.  Menu filthy.  30 minutes and still no one to take food order. Finished beer and left.  Deck area nice but...no thanks."}
{"text":"So we are traveling through Amish country buying fresh produce and stop here on a whim. Great experience. Large menu reasonable prices generous portions. Prompt attentive service. Fresh chips and guacamole    Would come back"}
{"text":"I've driven by this place several times since it opened, and tonight I finally stopped in to give it a whirl.    This place is located in the old Pancake Cafe building, which was a dine-in Pizza Hut before that.  The ambiance is pretty ok, and someone is definitely a talented painter when it comes to the murals.    The staff is comprised of some young people who seem very friendly and are working hard.  The prices are average, nothing too outrageous.  However, none of these simple pleasantries make up for the incredibly mediocre food.  Our dinner was VERY underwhelming, and VERY small portioned.  They used melted Monterrey jack on all the dishes, which was oh so creamy and disgusting!  Yay!  Sun Prairie has yet to acquire a really good Mexican restaurant.  The sad thing is, I didn't even really care all that much for Taqueria Guadalajara down on Park St in Madison, however, in terms of flavor and presentation Taqueria blows El Patron away big time."}
{"text":"Very friendly and accommodating, with good beer options and an extremely extensive menu. They even have horchata, which is great. The food was quite tasty. I would have been more impressed if they had a real margarita, though, instead of the usual mix -- so I stuck with Negra Modelo (which is delicious). Also, I know there were seven of us and it can be like herding cats to get groups to order in a timely manner -- but there is a big difference between efficiency and rush rush. That won't hold me back from a repeat visit, though, because on the bright side -- service was very fast!!"}
{"text":"We ate here a week ago last Thursday night and it was great.  I ordered the Alambre.  It's sort of the meat lover's version of mexican food....maybe more tex-mex?  My girlfriend had enchiladas and my son had....uhhhh......hmmmm.....I can't remember.  I think it was chicken enchiladas....and he liked it!  I do remember that.  I had a dos equis.  They have it on tap, and Marcia enjoyed her margarita.  ;D"}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this place has more recent bad reviews than good reviews as our experience was a good one.   They remind me of Laredo's in Madison. The unending combinations, specialty Mexican entrees and \"Gringo\" dinners for the non-adventurous.  Food came out real quick, was good and generous. Chips & salsa were included and we got a white dipping sauce as well. Best we can tell it's a ranch concoction. I wasn't a fan simply because I don't care for ranch but I'm sure it will appeal to others.   Of particular note was the mole poblano enchiladas which will appeal to a sweet tooth. Great flavor. Spanish rice was fine but not spectacular.   A coupon from the 2016-17 Bucky Book brought here & we wouldn't hesitate to return."}
{"text":"Food was great! The menu is huge and the service was very friendly. They offer $2.99 margaritas on Monday and Tuesday also!!"}
{"text":"While tagging along with my boyfriend while he ran errands in Sun Prairie, he decided he was hungry and pulled in to El Patron for a late lunch. The outside of the building is kind of sad looking (my guess is it started as a family restaurant) but it improves when you enter. We were seated in the back parrot-themed room which was nice and bright (both in decor and natural light).   Our server was friendly and patient as we perused the giant menu - usually I order the same thing every time I try a new Mexican place (chicken chimichanga), but I'd gorged myself on spicy cheese bread at the farmers' market that morning and was not nearly hungry enough to attempt it.   I landed on a tostaguac from the a la carte menu with a side of rice. I had never ordered a tostaguac before, but a quick search told me it was beef, beans, lettuce, tomatoes, and guacamole on a tostada shell (pretty much what I expected from the name).   When my food arrived I had to laugh at my attempt to end up with a reasonable amount of food - my plate was full. The tostaguac was piled high with salad and rice took up half the platter. I've gotten so accustomed to Madison Mexican joints giving you about five bites of rice or beans that I didn't anticipate being able to make a meal of rice alone.   The rice was fresh and not too greasy - I would order it again. El Patron's tostaguac didn't have beans but did have cheese. The toppings were fresh, but overall it just didn't do it for me. The beef was very juicy - I don't think it was given any opportunity to drain and it left a puddle on my plate. It also tasted like it was just straight up browned ground beef - no seasoning whatsoever, including salt. There was no spice or kick to be found anywhere in the dish - everything was very bland. I realize there is a segment of the population this would appeal to; I am just not one of those people.   Long story short: good service, okay prices, fresh but bland food."}
{"text":"If I could give this place zero stars I would. It took 30 minutes to get our drinks and then we sat for 2 hours patiently for our food. Stepped outside for a smoke. Literally was gone for 5 minutes and come back in to our drinks gone and new people sitting in our booth and still didn't get our food. Thank you for ruining my cinco de mayo."}
{"text":"Solid Mexican food. Great price. Good portions."}
{"text":"I so want to give this location 4 Stars but they've got some hurdles to overcome.  Consistency.  El Patron is a local chain - the next closest location to me has been around a bit longer, and my experiences there have always been top-notch.  That's the location in Chardon.  The Middlefield store has been here a bit more than a year.  The decor is simple, but adequate and clean.  The menu is diverse, the dishes fairly traditional, and the portions adequate.  There is the occasional oddity - like the shrimp burrito that is tasty - except for the totally odd (and sadly unexpected) inclusion of BROCCOLI in it.  Yes - broccoli. In a burrito.  One of my gauges for Mexican establishments is the salsa - this is inconsistency #1.  It's generally good - but there are days that it's kind of off.  One day it had a very strong taste of chili powder - not so good.  The staff is incredibly authentic - too much sometimes. I've had a couple instances of mis-communication - as have other patrons in earshot. But the staff is quick to recover most times and fix things as required. Arguably, their English is better than my Spanish, but a couple times I've ended paying nearly double for my food because of lack of understanding (I ordered a $4 \"a la carte\" burrito and was served a $13 \"dinner\" burrito).  One of my favorite dishes at El Patron Chardon is the queso fundito - a delightful mix of fresh cheese (queso fresca or \"chihuahua cheese\") on a platter sprinkled with chorizo and placed under a broiler, then served with tortillas. 50% of the time I get it here in Middlefield it comes out barely warmed through or with only a tiny hint of chorizo. At least once they've \"run out\" (???)  The carnitas is excellent, but they don't tout it much on the menu.  I get an a la carte carnitas burrito and combine the contents with an order of quesso funditio - then wrap it & douse it in their excellent pico de gallo and my head nearly explodes from the flavor fiesta in my mouth.  As odd as it sounds, this location has awesome club soda (my beverage of choice).  I am not sure on the drinks menu - I know they at least serve beer, so I'm adding that to the profile - but they may actually have a full-blown liquor license.  The Middlefield store is in a \"cursed location\" - a piece of prime real estate right on Rt 87 that can't seem to get a decent restaurant to take hold.  I hope that El Patron overcomes its growing pains and is here for the long haul - this town SO needs another decent place to eat.  This past summer saw the installation of a \"patio\" - but the proximity to SR 87 and the Amish buggy parking (think: sweaty horses that have to go to the bathroom \"somewhere\") tell me that this was possibly a wasted effort - but I am sure the local factory lunch crowd will make good use of it in the mild months when taking a break from the grind.  Overall - you should go. There's almost nowhere else in this town worth eating anyway."}
{"text":"Overall, not horrible, just good at being mediocre. Maybe I was expecting more due to them being the only Mexican place in town for a while and hoped they would perhaps do something to stand out. But alas, my hopes were somewhat dashed as they're a typical Midwestern \"gringo\" Mexican restaurant where the menu is way too large, meaning they don't have anything extraordinarily great, just good enough. My burrito was that. Did I leave hungry? Nope. But with so many cookie cutter Mexican places in this region of the country, it would've been nice if they had tried harder to stand out."}
{"text":"Nice food, quick service, the chips and salsa they bring out is yum. Inexpensive for what you get. Nice atmosphere..."}
{"text":"I really do not like to give bad reviews and I actually waited a couple of weeks to do this review in order to not be so harsh, but I feel I have to write this...I will start with the good. The patio area is nice and their margarita pitchers come with glasses already full plus the full pitcher, so that was awesome! The food on the other hand, not so much. I had Camarones a la Diabla done spicy. I was told that they forgot to make it spicy and given hot sauce, and the dish was made from some kind of concoction of what seemed like warm ketchup or a mild BBQ sauce over shrimp. Steer clear of this dish.  My wife and sister-in-law were also less than pleased with their dishes as well. The staff was nice enough, however that does not make for my last 5 or 6 visits! There is potential at El Patron, but there is room for much, much improvement. As one other review pointed out, it does seem more like Tex-Mex."}
{"text":"I dreaded having to do this someday, but I feel it's my duty to warn others that the food here is pretty disappointing. Won't go into detail about my subjective opinion of the quality, just avoid it. If the owners read this, I'd be happy to give fair, honest feedback on how they missed the mark. I give 5 stars to the style/color and the addition of a deck. Speaking Spanish was helpful when ordering and helping convey that my brother is allergic to dairy. The waiter appreciated it and my brother initially felt at ease.  I'll probably go back for margs and modelo on tap cuz they do have pretty good prices on them."}
{"text":"I'm sad that they no longer have the giant beers, but the food is as good as it gets at an unbeatable price!"}
{"text":"My fav mexican place in Madison.  Great service and good food and the prices is right."}
{"text":"I just had my thrid meal here, the food is VERY good...  I just don't know if i will go back... which sucks cause i like the food... so they have signs all over.... 1/2 price maragritas thursday with several brands of tequilla listed underneath that sign saying all are 1/2 off... so i ask for a patron margarita and he says just house is half off.................sign clearly states otherwise, i point this out and the waiter all of a sudden has a hard time understanding english??? Not cool for me.. i did not get a margy... and am sad i had a bad experience here."}
{"text":"The outside is pretty plain, but the knife is very clean and nicely appointed. Service was wonderful - fast, friendly, and helpful. The food was very good and reasonably priced. For a family of 4 we got out with tax and tip for $40. That included a tall Did Equis - which they have on draft. Very typical Mexican food that you might be familiar with from any of the myriad \"authentic\" Mexican places. Very good."}
{"text":"Used to come in every Thursday. Very loyal customers. Food came back to the table all soggy and swimming in water on the plate. The waiter took it back and just switched the plate. Food was still ruined. The manager / owner we knew we were loyal customers refused to re-make and could care less. I will never return."}
{"text":"Well I've been here before and it was OK but to day I showed up with two other people and when I went to sit down the sits at the booth were filthy, the hostess said sorry but when we wipe the table off we sweep it on top the seats. REALLY so you want customers to sit on dirty seats ..The service didn't seem like they really cared about anything and in fact it seemed like we were bothering them by coming in to eat.. We ordered a wide variety of foods and they all has ONE thing in common the FOOD WAS LUKE WARM and NOT HOT at all the beans were YUCKY the rice was OLD, DRY and COLD the food was NOT very good at all. . The Riesling wine tasted like cheap old no sweet puke water,  and that's being nice!  I've eaten a lot of Mexican around the country  and this place will soon be out of business the way it serves its customers COLD food and POOR quality food, There steak for the fajita tasted like shredded liver.... Not very good at all!  I will NOT be going back and if you like Mexican food then you DO NOT want to go here cause this is nothing but GARBAGE !"}
{"text":"Best Mexican I've had in the area by a longshot."}
{"text":"This is an awesome place to eat at! It's very reasonably priced (especially during their lunch hours) and they always have tons of awesome deals everyday. I love getting tacos or an enchilada. It's like Taco Bell except you get free chips and salsa with your meal. The wait staff is always kind and the food comes out super fast! You can be in and out in 20 minutes during lunch hours. I will continue to come here and support this local business!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went there for the first time last night.  They seemed to be doing well.  We were sat immediately and were acknowledged by the waiter.  We were not that hungry so we split the Nachos El Patron.  The menu says it comes with the following: Chips, Cheese, Beans, Chicken, Beef, Lettuce, Tomato, Guacamole.  We ordered it without beef and with cheese only on half since my wife cannot eat dairy.  The food was brought in a timely manner.  Cheese was only on half.  Okay.  No lettuce, No tomatoes. No Beans.  No Guac.  And the chicken was cold!  I called the waiter and he took it back.  When he brought it back, they only added the lettuce to it.  No three strikes here!     We will never go back there again.  And this really is a shame since our favorite food is Mexican!!"}
{"text":"I wish I had taken a picture. I travel this country for work and I can tell you a couple things. Chili Colorado is made the same way no matter what. Steak, chili sauce with rice, beans and tortillas. I was served chop meat as we call it some might know it as roast meats in a ketchupey mild kinda chili flavored sauce, what looked like re re re refried beans and a pile of Ben's 5 minute microwaved rice. It was crap. That's not even mentioning the quesadillas we ordered coming fresh out of the microwave with what looked like government cheese on them."}
{"text":"I hate only giving three star reviews, but it really was mediocre at best.  We came here for lunch along with a few sporadic customers.  When I can park next to the disabled parking that should have been my first clue, but we are determined to keep trying new places in the area and plan A was closed for lunch.    The decor was cute, but the tables and booths have seen a lot of wear and tear.  On the plus side it was very clean.  The bathroom smelled like cleaner rather than a bathroom.  Service was immediate with a piping hot bowl of tortilla chips a bowl of white dip and some mild salsa.  I'm not a jalapeño lover, but even I like a little heat with my salsa.  The white stuff-it was questionable.  It was cold, not spicy nor did it taste like ranch or cheese sauce...a mystery we didn't bother to solve as the taste wasn't worth it.  Prices are affordable at least-under ten dollars per meal and the portions were large.  I ordered a burrito fajita with chicken.  The chicken and vegetables were hot and slightly seasoned, the shell tasted like a tortilla shell, but the rest was a meh.  Yeah it's refried beans and fried rice, but I was hoping for a little heat or seasoning?    While the table service was pleasant I went to pay for my bill and wasn't acknowledged by the hostess until she finished charging the bill before mine, printed out my receipt and said a quick \"thank you have a great day\" as she was walking away.   I'm sorry she didn't care enough to listen to me say a kind reply.  Perhaps she was too busy with her other customers?"}
