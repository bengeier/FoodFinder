{"text":"Coming in from my flight I was admittedly hungry as all 'get-out' and, being that it was my first time in Charlotte, I had no clue about the local fare. Taking a chance I went to Fujo and, I must say, I was pleasantly surprised by not just the food but by how personable the staff was. Warm, welcoming, friendly; it made the dining experience that much more memorable and helped to ease any anxieties I had about a new sushi spot.  And the food.  My goodness the food was good. Hardly a gourmand myself, for the price, the taste and the quantities were perfect - and I must admit the chef surprised me with the Tokyo roll with bits of caviar dusted on top.  If I had a choice, I'd recommend Fujo. It's withing walking distance and in a very scenic square which makes for comfortable dining."}
{"text":"Pretty big portions.  Reasonable pricing.   I ordered the tangerine crispy chicken.  My coworker ordered sesame crispy chicken. We shared and the only difference seemed to be the sesame seeds on his.  Same chicken and sauce.  Tip...  Order the fried rice instead of the included white rice with your crispy chicken ... No extra charge"}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed by the sushi here. I came on a Tuesday night and the place was pretty empty which makes sense with their location. They did have a takeout crowd but not for sushi. The wine glass I got was dirty but the prices were reasonable. I ordered an eel roll and a shrimp roll. The eel was too fishy and crunchy and the shrimp was very bland. Overall wasn't overly enthused and paid and left. Wouldn't go back for sushi."}
{"text":"Fujo is one of my go-to spots for lunch.  I normally go around 11:30am since it gets very crowded after noon.  Lots of office workers call in orders and then wait in the lobby for pickup.  This can cause the bar seating to feel a bit cramped, but normally its not bad.  The sushi chef is quiet and doesn't interact with customers much.  They always have plenty of staff on hand and they are friendly.  The lunch special rolls are small, but tasty.  The specialty maki rolls are much better (size and quality).  The pineapple fried rice is also very good."}
{"text":"Had lunch Monday 6/27.  I do not recommend, unless gummy rice, tasteless vegetables, thinly sliced beef with no flavor is your idea of  fusion. I couldn't pour enough hot sauce to awaken the taste.  The food came out quickly which scared me bc It usually means it was not cooked to order. The waiter never did refill my water glass. Felt rushed even though other tables were available. They did separate checks for the five of us without asking.  I have eaten there before to moderate liking... No one at our table spoke about the food which is usually a sign of mediocre.    It's uptown in a nice environment but I will not go back, as I reluctantly went this time."}
{"text":"Delicious, I have been here so many times. Good service, validated parking, and delicious food. Favorites are panther and Godzilla roll!"}
{"text":"Vacation from San Diego and wanted to try sushi, mistake!! Walk in and I hear a voice yell \"can I help you?\" It took me a while to figure out who was speaking and if they were speaking to me. Hostess never bothered to get up and greet the customers coming in as she was sitting at a table folding napkins yelling at each one that walked through the door.   After I located the person speaking to me I was a little confused as to her questioning, how about \"Hello, welcome to Fujo would this be dine-in or carry out?\" Not \"CAN I HELP YOU\" obviously I'm here to eat, show me a menu or help me find a seat.   There were about 10-15 people in the restaurant and service was extremely slow.   As you can see I have NEVER written a review but I felt the inadequate service I received today called for one."}
{"text":"We tried Fujo for the last time. We never know if they are delivering. It changes by the day. When they do deliver, it always takes longer than the estimated time. We have had to cancel our order before because drivers were extremely late. Today, we were disappointed with the food we relieved. It was BLAND! There was no flavor at all. I can't say enough how upset I am with the lack of consistency this restaurant has. We'll take our business somewhere else."}
{"text":"1 star for price and 1 star for atmosphere; however, terrible service and run-of-the-mill food  Took forever to have our order taken followed by them not bringing my food out after everyone had already gotten their order. Never came by to fill our glasses. The food came out in a messed up order. Appetizers got there only 2 minutes before main course, seriously? Once I got my sushi I had no tray for the soy sauce and no one was around to ask for one. The kicker, the place wasn't busy, not in the least bit.  I will never return here when I come back to Charlotte."}
{"text":"I'm sitting at the sushi bar, there is 1 other person in the space.  THAT should tell you something, especially since this establishment is connected to the Hilton.  Everyone (staff) is one their cell phones.  Everyone.....I should have walked out moment's after entering.  Very Very unappetizing.  The sushi chef appears annoyed.  The game is on......no wonder.  Though the sushi was actually very goid, the atmosphere will keep me from returning.  Dining out is an all encompassing experience.   I can get good sushi at the grocery store.  I expect better."}
{"text":"Best sushi I've had in a very long time! I will be visiting again!"}
{"text":"So delicious. Service was fantastic. Love the cozy space. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I found a groupon for this for $30 worth of food for $15 and decided to get it to take my boyfriend out for dinner. We went on a Friday night around 7 o'clock and it was almost dead. We ordered the calamari as an appetizer (it was amazing! But has onions in it which is not described on the menu). The crunchy  caterpillar was good but the volcano was amazing. Overall this restaurant was pretty average but a great price. The food was good and the area was clean and the staff was nice."}
{"text":"Yumm!! Had the volcano steak which came with a big portion of fresh and juicy steak and huge spicy and crunchy shrimp around it. The veggies were fresh and crispy and the sauce was unique; sweet and spicy. Also had the firecracker sushi which was tasty.  Service from Jeremy was great, he kept checking on us and refilling our drinks which was awesome!  Will be back to try more menu items!"}
{"text":"Best sushi I've had so far in Charlotte! Make sure you try their Coastal Roll; my husband and I were floored by the sushi quality and the price!  Wonderful restaurant and evening all around!"}
{"text":"Solid sake menu and the staff was helpful in deciding which one to go with. Sushi rolls had an interesting spin but nothing out of the ordinary."}
{"text":"Pan asian food attached to the Hilton Hotel in Uptown this restaurant has little to recommend it other than convenience. The service is very friendly and attentive but the sashimi was no better than can be found at at a fast food food court outfit. My friends thought their food supremely unremarkable which is no great praise."}
{"text":"Decent sushi place in Uptown. I believe they are more crowded for lunch cause we went here for dinner and it was completely dead.  Went to Fujo on Friday night for dinner cause we had a Groupon. The place was very empty and we decided to sit outside since it was nice out! The outside basically looks out onto a huge fountain, so it was nice.   Ordered a couple of bottled beers. They dont have any draft beers and their bottle selections werent really that great.  We got the steamed dumplings as an appetizer and split 3 rolls: Godzilla, Sunset, and the Charlotte Delight Roll. All three were very good. The Sunset roll was my favorite cause I loved that garlic sauce on top. The Godzilla roll was my husbands favorite.....though, I thought it was just too much going on! I thought everything was well priced (all three rolls under $10 each) and we will definitely return for a casual dinner date."}
{"text":"DO NOT GO HERE!!!  Went here alone with the groupon around 2pm. I asked the hostess if I could use the groupon for my meal, which to she replied \"yes\" and seated me with a menu. I ordered enough to honor the groupon (which was 3 sushi rolls and green tea). When the check arrived, the waiter told me I could not use my groupon. I then stated that the hostess assured me that I could when I first arrived. The owner came out and demanded I pay full price because it was not dinner time. I told the owner that the hostess said I could use the groupon, to which the hostess denied to the owner of ever saying that. She then left the restaurant or hid in the kitchen where I couldn't confront her. The owner told me that she was new and therefore didn't know anything about groupon, So \"I WAS AT FAULT\" and therefore demanded I pay full price. I also offered to pay a dinner price (if there was one, to which he said my sushi would be $20 dollars EACH, however, their menus online state they are only $10 at lunch/dinner time - so he was only trying to get money out of me). 15 minutes of arguing, me vs. the owner with all the employees watching, I started crying. The owner then stopped demanding and took the groupon, stating that I am never to come back and never to buy their groupon again.   WORST EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE. I told the hostess about the groupon the moment I walked in and this is how I'm treated!   Only positive was the waiter who served me was sympathetic when I was leaving and apologized for the matter.   Please take my advice and don't support this kind of behavior."}
{"text":"I have been a regular at Fujo's for lunch for several months now, dinner a couple of times.  I can say that they have consistently provided me with the best sushi experience in Uptown CLT.  First impressions; I've always been skeptical when a restaurant attempts to cross dress their cusine amongst several different cultures, and this place features Chinese, Japanese, Thai, etc.  Places that do this will typically fall short of expectations in all categories when they don't specialize in just one.  This is not the case with Fujos!    Their sushi is fantastic...their lunch specials are reasonably priced for what you get.  I sat at the bar the other day and ordered the lunch special \"C\" (Cali roll, 3 salmon sashimi, 4 nigiri, chefs choice).  I fully expected the chef to pull a pre-made california roll out of the fridge; this seems to be common practice for other sushi joints who feature specials during lunch...they will pre-make rolls in anticipation of the lunch rush.  Not here.  The chef, who was flying solo during a busy lunch hour I might add, made every roll as it was ordered....a plus in my book, and something I will be glad to wait an extra couple of minutes for.    From the kitchen, might I suggest the Crab Fu Rong?  Delicious...of course, it is hard to screw up a crab!  Service is militarily efficient as well...if I ever had to wait in this place (which is seldom), it was on the kitchen, not on the waitstaff.  This place does fill up quickly during peak times...good news about the quality of the food, bad news for those of us with precious little free time during the workday.  Go a little before 12, or a little after 1, and you should be fine."}
{"text":"Nice employees, nice location, Awful sushi.  Should have known something was amiss when it was empty at 6:30 on a Friday night.  Surely there are better places in town."}
{"text":"Very favorably impressed. Generous portions, great taste. Outstanding service. Overall good experience and will definitely be back. Good sushi, general tso's, and crab rangoons. Do it. Go now."}
{"text":"I ordered this from seamless to my hotel. Delivery was fast and very convenient! The food was decent. I wouldn't write home about it, but solid expected flavors. The biggest reason for the three stars was the volcano roll. The description of the roll and price reflected crab meat AND scallop baked on to the top. To my disappointment, the basic California roll base was delivered topped with only imitation \"krab.\" All else was as expected for the price point, but I didn't appreciate the embellished description."}
{"text":"Its a good deal for lunch. If you're downtown & need a quick bite, I'd stop in. The service is fast & pretty friendly. The sushi is nothing to write home about, but its worth the price."}
{"text":"I was stoked to try this place for lunch today. I just found out about it last week. Who knew this little gem was located Uptown? Ok, I guess people who work on that side of Uptown but I never knew it was there! Quick service but it took awhile to get our check. Luckily, one of the girls I was with knew the manager and she alleviated the issue. I love that they have sushi specials that come with soup or salad at a reasonable price. The sushi tasted fresh and the spicy tuna had my mouth burning which is a great thing. Their portions for lunch on the hot dishes looked ginormous so I will be checking that out next. In and out in less than an hour-good times. Two words for you Fujo---Sushi Buffet!!!"}
{"text":"Having limited options in Uptown I gave this place a few chances.  It's just not good.  I got some eel that wasn't fresh and I haven't been able to eat eel since.  I also think their miso soup is actually chicken broth with some miso tossed in."}
{"text":"Overall, I find Fujo to be fairly average, but it's convenient and if you know what to order you can get a good meal.    You can ask for all white meat in your chicken dish, so if you have a problem with weird, inedible black pieces of meat in your GENERAL's or SESAME CHICKEN, specify all white meat and that problem goes away.    I've ordered GENERAL's and SESAME TOFU many times in varying ways, but finally realized that this dish is not going to work for me here.  They cut the tofu into very large triangles and fry (without any breading).  So you get a tough, extremely hard edged piece of tofu to try to chew.  Inevitably you will not be able to chew it properly, sobeware of throat lacerations if you try to swallow it.  I've tried to order it in smaller pieces (didn't work), and less fried (also a fail).    I recently discovered their EGGPLANT with GARLIC SAUCE.  It's actually very good, as long as the eggplant pieces are cut small enough.  The sauce is very flavorful, and they'll even make it with less oil upon request.    I know several people who love the noodle dishes, and it does seem to be a lot of food for a decent price.  The service here is quick and efficient.  You can get in and out at lunch time in 30 minutes or less.  If you get your order to go, check the bag to see if you have enough soy or other sauces.  I find that 2 packets of soy aren't enough for me, so I always have to ask for extra."}
{"text":"Food was good but We told server that our son had a nut allergy and he said there were no nuts with what we ordered. After my son ate his egg roll he complained about his throat feeling weird. We asked server again and he asked the manager. Manager said there was peanut butter in egg rolls. My wife ran out with son and luckily found benedryl.  No discount for almost sending my son to the hospital. Don't trust going back there again."}
{"text":"While staying in Uptown Charlotte we decided on sushi for dinner. Based on a yelp search we looked for a reasonable priced, well reviewed, ready walking distance option from our hotel.  This one is rated with two $$.  Truthfully some of the best sushi I've ever had.  My boyfriend and I split 3 rolls; the coastal roll, panther roll, and the Godzilla roll.  They were not skimpy by any means, there was almost am entire roll left when I had to give up, so the man happily picked up the slack.    I'm only on town for the weekend, so I have no idea if they run specials throughout the week.  I will absolutely come back next time I'm here, and will recommend to my friend who live here and visit here (only 3 hours from home)"}
{"text":"The coastal roll and steak takati roll are both a must! Definitely a great go-to place if you're staying in Charlotte on business! Right next to Hilton so after a long day no need to walk around the entire city looking for food."}
{"text":"One of the worst meals I have ever had. I ordered delivery through Grubhub and wished I hadn't.   Ordered shrimp and vegetable tempura, crunchy caterpillar roll, and Singapore noodles.   The tempura smelled and tasted like it was made with onion ring batter. So heavy and greasy. Nothing like tempura.   The avocado on top of the crunchy caterpillar roll was completely brown, I couldn't even bring myself to eat it, I took it off and ate the roll without it. Well, the few pieces I could stomach, it wasn't good at all.   The Singapore noodles were just ok. They only have chicken (no pork or shrimp like usual) and after the tempura and roll, I was frankly too scared to even try the chicken. The noodles were either the wrong noodles or overcooked (thicker than they usually are). The flavor wasn't bad.   Definitely will not order from this place again."}
{"text":"Have you ever left a place and thought: What took me so long to get here?   That happened to me at Fujo's.   My girlfriends and I celebrated my birthday here and the sushi and drinks knocked my socks off. Yep, I'm officially a fan! I'd recommend this place to anyone looking for some good and reasonably priced sushi!   We started with the steamed pork dumplings. Classic. I also ordered the Rainbow Martini-- it's cranberry vodka, pineapple and midori. The presentation was excellent and they were VERY heavy handed with the liquor.  And there's really just no need to go on and on about just how happy that made the birthday girl! That thing is delicious.  But let's get to what everyone wants to know about...the sushi! I ordered the Godzilla Roll and decided after the first bite it's officially my \"go to\" roll when I'm here. I clearly see why it's mentioned in so many reviews and why it's listed as a \"must try\" on the menu. It's packed with spicy tuna, avocado and then deep fried tempura style. My goodness. How could you go wrong with that combination?    Do yourself a favor and get over to Fujo's! It's definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"I was in town for business and ordered the Panther Roll and a Cosmopolitan for dinner. Loved the sushi at Fujo! The atmosphere was great, service was good, and price was reasonable. I had dinner by myself that night, but didn't mind. There is lots of variety on the menu."}
{"text":"Fast, delicious, hot, affordable and solid service.  I've only had the Chinese and not the sushi; I can tell you the Singapore rice noodles are great as are the stir frys. Am easy and dependable go-to restaurant if you staying near by on business and don't want to pay the mediocre and expensive room service."}
{"text":"I don't recommend this place for sushi.  I had the Godzilla roll, ikura (salmon roe) nigiri and saba (mackerel) nigiri.  The sushi rice for the nigiri is not correctly prepared, and the taste and texture are wrong.  For the ikura, the roe itself is fine and perfectly tasty, but the odd rice, and the fact that there is too much rice in proportion to the roe, makes this a chewy, imbalanced sushi.  The saba is acceptable, although a bit fishy as commercially-pickled mackerel tends to be.  The Godzilla roll is a travesty.  Utterly flavorless.  The cream cheese part of the filling seems to be mixed with spicy mayo, which still manages to taste like nothing.  The only flavor comes from the drizzle of teriyaki sauce and spicy mayo sauce (ick).  It's crunchy on the outside, yes, but even that has no flavor.  Uninspired.  Service was slow at 12:30 on a Monday afternoon, even though the place was not jammed.  Somewhat disappointing.  This place serves Chinese food also, and what I saw and smelled of that on other tables seemed appetizing, so perhaps this place is better for Chinese food."}
{"text":"Bad service. I know I'm a minority (vegetarian), but the waiter should at least help me figure out what items are not vegetarian. I asked the waiter which items were vegetarian. He says \"I don't know.\" I ask him to ask the chef if one of the times is veggie. He goes and comes back and says it's not veggie. So I ask him about another item on the menu. He says \"I don't know\" and just stands there. If he had any common sense he would've asked the chef which items on the menu are veggie."}
{"text":"Just when I was about to give up on good sushi in Charlotte my neighbor introduced me to FUJO or what he calls his secret Chinese restaurant.   Fujo is tucked away in the Wachovia building downtown. The menu is huge you can try anything from one of their more exotic sushi rolls like the Cajun Roll - (Shrimp & Crawfish Inside: Topped w/ Spicy Crab and Cajun Spice) to authentic and tasty Chinese dishes like chicken with garlic sauce. The hardest part is choosing what to eat.   Did I mention that they serve my favorite wine here I haven't seen it in any other restaurant around yet...Sophia Coppola's sparkling white wine it's served in a little pink can. That just makes the experience that much better.   You never have to wait for a table and its a great place for a group dinner before heading out for some drinks uptown."}
{"text":"Loved it.  Highly recommend the firecracker shrimp and spicy tuna roll.  Great service and very pleasant atmosphere with a nice table next to the glass wall."}
{"text":"Good sushi/ asian food for relatively good prices. Very good waiting staff.  Sushi is much better than places like Sushi 101 and probably cheaper than places like Enso. I just a LivingSocial instant deal ($12 for $24), so if you can get that, I would def. recommend."}
{"text":"I took my boyfriend here for his birthday after finding a Groupon and seeing favorable reviews. The location is great as far as views but you will probably have to pay for parking as it is in downtown Charlotte. I found a parking deck for five dollars since it was later in the evening on a Friday. The menu was varied and they have a lot of dishes that I really liked. Portion sizes were generous especially on the sushi. Usually you don't get enough sushi to fill you up but this place really delivered! The service was a little slow and impersonal so that's why I gave it four stars instead of five. All in all, I would definitely go back! Make sure you check Groupon before you go,  they usually have a pretty good deal."}
{"text":"I bought a couple of Groupons for this place once I saw the reviews. Verdict: delicioso. In fact, it might be the best sushi place I've been to in Charlotte, competing with my evergreen love for Cowfish.  I took the recommendations of others and opted for the Godzilla Roll. Absolutely freaking delicious; 10/10. The tempura was divine, as was the sauce, as was the filling. All of it. Their fried pork dumplings were tasty too - I prefer mine to be crunchier than the ones they served, but they were delightfully flavorful. My boyfriend ordered the Classic Spicy Eel and Spicy Yellowtail rolls. I thought they seemed a bit skimpy on the rice and not spicy at all, but the fish and eel themselves were tender and plentiful. The food did come out quickly, so we were pleased with that. And the hot sake was pretty good, even though I don't like sake all that much.  Really my only [minor] complaint was the service. The manager (I assume) was quite nice, but our server was not very attentive. It was enough to knock off one star, but not enough to keep me from going back."}
{"text":"Came here on most days for lunch whenever we were extremely busy upstairs. It's in a convenient location and very quick when ordering over the phone for pickup (15 min). Pretty much everything on the menu is amazing."}
{"text":"You know what's crazy? I've been to this sushi joint like at least 20 times and this is the first time I've actually checked in. I gotta step my game up.   Anyhow... Godzilla Sushi Roll is the truth! You can't go wrong, ordering that. I'm seriously stuffed after eating. I mean, the crunchy tempura outside, the savory sauce, the fresh avocado... The ingredients make love in my mouth. Seriously. In my opinion, there's no need to try anything else.  Service is spot on. Every time I'm there, everyone is very attentive, and you can't beat the area. I always find a spot to park on 3rd street and when it's nice and warm out; eating outside just makes it all worthwhile. Even if I have to put quarters in the joint to park on a weekday. It's worth it!   I go hard for some sushi, especially the Godzilla roll. Get on it!"}
{"text":"Thought they might be spend due to its location to the hotel, but they are very reasonable in price and I had the Godzilla Roll...14 pieces and I ate it all. It was fantastic. Will definitely eat here again prior to leaving"}
{"text":"This a great place for a quick lunch in uptown Charlotte.  The service is always exceptional and the food is very good.  I normally order the tangerine or general tso chicken.  It's delicious with the right amount of heat.  I definitely recommend Fujos for lunch."}
{"text":"Great food, great drinks and fantastic view of the fountain right at the main entrance. Definitely will be eating here again when I come back to Charlotte."}
{"text":"Bloody Mary tastes like dish soap and no hint of alcohol.  STAY AWAY from it.  The Godzilla roll is huge, crunchy and avocado creamy with a hint of tuna.  Average  The Spicy lovers roll was more modest, it tries to get a reaction on the initial bite but it was just not enough.  It has a slight touch of spicyness.  It was, just ok.  Overall, it was worth the try but I will need to see what else my beautiful Charlotte has to offer."}
{"text":"So Fuji's website and doors list hours of Monday through Friday until 10pm. My date and I showed up at literally 9:31 and were told they were closed for dinner and only open for takeout. When I questioned their signs, they reiterated that 10 was for takeout only and that they stopped serving in the restaurant at 9:30. Again, this was at exactly 9:31. What a joke. Restaurants like this that don't understand the meaning of customer service and don't deserve to remain in business. I used to work in the service industry and I get wanting to leave on a Friday night, but cmon, do your job. Needless to say, I won't be dining here anytime soon, or ever."}
{"text":"I am really upset that this restaurant in my work building has recently increased the price of their specialty rolls by $1.00. So, for example, my favorite Godzilla roll is now $11.75. It's just over the top pricing for lunch. I really think they will lose business this way, I used to order from them every week now it's a once a month thing. If you have to increase prices, at the most 25 cents, it's already expensive. Bad move."}
{"text":"I have been trying to find a good Chinese place ever since I moved here from AZ and this is the first restaurant (along with SOHO) that has been like- able. Food seemed somewhat fresh, quality was okay, not too greasy. Lacking in flavor, I got the sweet and sour chicken, chicken fried rice and spring roll."}
{"text":"Nestled right beside the Hilton hotel and across from Panera bread is a quaint little Chinese & Japanese restaurant. I'd stray away from calling it fusion because the dishes look either strictly Chinese or Japanese. Chinese options include various sauteed dishes with fried meats. Japanese options include all your japanese food fare (so I'd venture to call this a Japanese restaurant that decided to serve Chinese food).  Dinner on a week night around 8pm was pretty empty so no wait for seating. I ordered the rainbow roll and spider roll. Everything was just A-OK."}
{"text":"I had high expectations for this place, given that it came highly recommended by 2 work associates. Service was quick and attentive....even though I was the first to order and had to wait about 5 extra minutes AFTER everyone else got their order.....Strike 1.  I got the Malay Sauce dish with chicken and shrimp. They give you LOTS of fried rice (or any rice you order) which makes the plate look deceivingly large, but in reality it is NOT that big of a portion....whic is OK for lunch. But the chicken and shrimp portions were unusually SMALL (i.e., not that much of it) and they were definitely skimpy on the Malay Sauce. Strike 2.  The flavors were.....somewhat BLAND. Not bad, but compared to something like Hasaki Grill, they just cannot compete. Strike 3.  Not horrible but given the Uptown choices (Room 112, Hasaki, Enzo, etc.) there are FAR better choices than Fujo."}
{"text":"Good sushi, VERY salty Miso Soup. Greeter/Hostess was very rude and aloof!"}
{"text":"Owner was extremely polite.  Waitress was not the best.  Brought me the wrong beer and the wrong sushi (even after a lengthy explanation that I wanted salmon roe...not salmon or a salmon roll).  The sushi itself was ok but not as good as I would expect from an Uptown establishment."}
{"text":"Good sushi in Uptown. Very friendly service. Great for pickup with Grubhub if you live or work in the area."}
{"text":"I applaud the look of this place and the artistry of the setup at the sushi bar. My primary goal was to relax for half an hour or so between professional obligations and grab an appetizer and a beer, and Fujo definitely accommodated those needs in a timely fashion.  Being in the Carolinas and craving something with a bit of heat, I opted for the Cajun Roll which featured crayfish with shrimp and crab. It was nothing mind-blowing, but neither was it repulsive. Since moving the South I've learned that one was must accept, I've learned to be thankful for what I can get in the sushi department. However, I was really not a particularly big fan of the hot-and-sour soup. The ingredients were not particularly fresh, and the un-nuanced broth was just on the verge of being genuinely unpleasant  to get down.  This place still has a certain charm to it, but it's probably not Charlotte's best work from a culinary standpoint."}
{"text":"My husband and I purchased a groupon here so we decided to try it out. We came here for dinner  on a Wednesday night and the restaurant was not busy at all so we got seated right away.   We started with the calamari, that was served with a spicy mayo with fried onions and peppers. It was good, but more fried than I prefer. However, the portion was huge and it was only $7.   For our meal we opted for sushi: spicy tuna ($4.95), California roll ($4.95), spider ($7.95) and the hot lava roll ($11.85). The hot lava roll was shrimp tempura, spicy tuna and avocado rolled in a soybean wrap, which cause the roll to have a pink appearance. All of the rolls were good, but the hot lava roll was not spicy. I think they forgot to add the \"hotness\" to it ;-) however everything was delicious.   The quality of the sushi was also a plus for the price. There are a lot of sushi places in Charlotte and I think Fujo was a great value for the money. I will definitely return again."}
{"text":"The food is so bland. I had the pad Thai and the egg rolls and both were so tasteless. And the noodles kept breaking into pieces. Wouldn't eat here again. I didn't order the sushi so I can't speak for that."}
{"text":"YUM. This place has amazing sushi and Asian dishes. I came with a group of 6, and we started out sharing a few appetizers. We got the chicken lettuce wraps, dumplings, and crab rangoons. All were absolutely delicious and perfect for sharing.   I ordered sushi, others fried rice, noodle dishes, or entrees. The food all came out so fast! Except the sushi. That took the longest by far, and I was the only one at the table waiting on my food. It looked like there was only one sushi chef, so that's probably why there was a bit of delay. However the restaurant wasn't terribly busy when we were there. Waiting for the sushi wasn't a huge deal for me, but figured I'd mention it anyway.   All of the food we ordered was so good. The portions were really big, you could probably share a dish between two people. We all left with takeout boxes full of leftovers. I'd come back here for sure!"}
{"text":"Bought a groupon for this place so my boyfriend and I came in at 9 on Saturday night (they close at 10) I work in the restaurant industry so I pretty much know how most things work....  We were obviously not wanted there. 2 minutes after we sat down and got drinks, we were told the kitchen would close soon so we need to order right away.   Of course I felt flustered so I ordered a sushi roll I wasn't even sure I would like and of course... I didn't like it.   While eating, the whole staff (host, waiter, sushi chef, cook, managers) stood by the bar and watched us. I've never felt more rushed and unwanted somewhere in my life.   Super unprofessional and rude. Not sure if I'll even go back."}
{"text":"I've been going to Fujo's for the last 5 months or so and I must say that after a long day of work, their seafood su and dragon roll always hit the spot.  They also have Chinese food if you actually want your fish cooked.  And the service is consistently fast and friendly.  Five stars!"}
{"text":"i am from Cali; and we love our sushi; was worried that i might never find good sushi while here. This place proved me wrong; great sushi; super quick for call ins and across fom my school; so excited! Might be a weekly place for me!!"}
{"text":"Firecracker roll was very good!  If you like spider roll you will love it.  Service was attentive & friendly.  Great view of the courtyard. Very happy i triedthis place."}
{"text":"The sushi was super fresh! The service was great! The dumplings and soup was mediocre but overall I enjoyed it! The ambiance was very private and nice! I definitely would come here again if in the area again. Definitely a hidden gem in Downtown Charlotte."}
{"text":"I cant believe people like the sushi here. I am not from the area, but I tried the chirashi and the soft shell crab the other day. Both were very disappointing, especially the chirashi. The fish was old and dull looking. The sushi just didn't taste flavorful as well"}
{"text":"Worst chicken pad Thai I've ever had. Was sick to my stomach all afternoon. Of course, I'm not sure it was really chicken. I hardly ate much of the mystery meat or chicken fat that had been pounded down flat and sold as chicken, but it was enough to cause some pain. The noodles were not good either."}
{"text":"What to say... Fujo is a \"historical\" uptown Charlotte restaurant now. Certainly that is a testament to their location and they must be doing something well. That said, I remember 10 years ago, their prices were better and their food was better. Over the years, I felt it has been a steady decline and it got to the point where I didn't eat there for almost two years, until today (2/29/2012). There are just so many \"pan-asian\", let me take some crap out of a bag, stir fry it, and charge you $10 for lunch places now in Charlotte, that Fujo doesn't distinguish itself.  I had the lo-mein, couldn't tell the difference from any other lo-mein. Someone in our party of 4 ordered the fried rice and it looked alot better than what I ordered. To be honest, if I wasn't so adverse to paying for fried \"leftover\" rice at \"Chinese\" restaurants, I would've gotten that, because it looked authentic.  FYI, fried rice is usually made from cooled / cold cooked rice. Some Chinese restaurants will use left over white rice to make fried rice, not sure what Fujo does, but I am always weary of ordering fried rice. Also, if the white rice that comes out doesn't look fresh and well cooked, what hope is there that your fried rice is remotely decent? Maybe I'm just snobby, but who goes to restaurants to pay for a meal of leftovers?  Anyways, ok food, nothing to write home about... forgettable pan-asian restaurant that you can find all over Charlotte now."}
{"text":"I'm at Fujo to eat in or take out several times a week, and am impressed with their fresh ingredients, consistent quality, and friendly service. Best Asian food uptown."}
{"text":"Was taken here for a welcome luncheon. Their sushi lunch special is fairly priced. I had a bowl of soup and two types of sushi. I selected avocado and veggie. I'm not into eating raw seafood.   My meal was pleasant enough. Interior space felt crowded. Refreshments were continuously refilled. Waiter checked in only once. Overall, nothing impressive.  Those that ate entrees complained of stomach issues later."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of visiting this place yesterday.  I ordered the Malaya sauce with chicken and scallop with a spicy sushi roll.  I purchased the LivingSocial deal and it was worth it."}
{"text":"I don't know how they do it but they hit the bullseye every time we go there.  Last night was great for sitting outside and again, the service and food was great.  Awesome value and room for the kids to run around outside and play.  Be sure to ask for a parking voucher if you park in the garage."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to head uptown and leave our comfort zone on the whim of a Groupon.  I was in the mood for sushi, so we ended up at Fujo.  Nothing crazy on the inside, pretty simple, but a wonderful view of the uptown city buildings.  We were seated by the window.  We started with two rolls and split them- spicy tuna and spicy salmon.  Both were very good- and tasted very fresh.  It's my favorite when you can the tell the rice was just made!  I had the Singapore noodles and my husband had the Pad Thai, both with chicken.  We both enjoyed our meals.  My only gripe is that we were rushed through our Saturday night out.  I admit we arrived around 9:10pm, and they close at 10, but all of our food arrived at once.  We would've liked to slow things down a bit.  Service was good, and food also was.  May be trying it again, but arriving earlier."}
{"text":"I recently switched offices and have discovered this place for lunch. Great sushi, fast service, and really reasonable lunch specials. I've been coming about once a week, love it!"}
{"text":"Fujo is hard to find, but totally worth it once you do. Probably my favorite Charlottean Asian restaurant and I had never even heard of them 2 months ago. Their sushi is very fresh, cut well,  and reasonably priced. Their hot food is delicious and even their chicken fried rice has giant pieces of real chicken in it, not just the tiny shreds I'm used to at other restaurants."}
{"text":"Loved the maki sushi rolls. The service was good. The food was fantastic. Parking is validated if you park in the WF Center garage, and they're close to the Lynx Blue Line."}
{"text":"Could be an unlucky day but I got some pretty bad food poisoning from ordering a very very basic dish. So F me, I guess.   Food tastes alright though. Also, convenient location is a plus. 2 star."}
{"text":"They have a tough time here with the lunch rush.  You HAVE to go at off hours, get there 11:45 or 12:45 but not in between because you will wait.  And when you finally get your table, if you all get sushi it will come out at the same time.  If you all get stir fry dishes they will come out at the same time.  But if half the table gets stir fry and the other gets sushi then GOOD LUCK.  Our stir fry eaters were completely done eating by the time our sushi came out.  There was only one sushi chef on duty. For the lunch rush you need to be prepared!!!    They do have daily sushi specials (the Tsunami roll recently....uh a little 'tongue in cheek' guys?) and the Volcano Roll.  They will run you about 8 or 9 bucks per roll.  The rolls were put together so fast that they were sploppy and loose so it was hard to pick them up and dip them but overall not bad tasting....    The stir fry dishes are your MSG delight, portion sizes are ok and they come with an egg roll."}
{"text":"Though I have never been inside of Fujo to eat, I have to write this review on their food because it's so amazing. I found Fujo on Door Dash because they were listed under free delivery and I am always amazed each time I order. Great quality ingredients, always have my order ready for the delivery person, and are consistent. Definitely worth the price and you will be a happy sushi lover."}
{"text":"We grabbed Fujo's last week to eat in our hotel room and I'm giving these guys props for some pretty decent Sushi at very reasonable prices!   Being from the Bay Area, I was very nervous ordering Sushi here in the South, but there's only so much fried food you can eat before you want a bit of a lighter fare.    Now before you jump on me about all the awesome places with great healthy food, let me say that we had my 1 year old along for the trip and most restaurants don't particularly appreciate shrieking kids.   Our options were mostly limited to delivery, room service, and to go in the general vicinity of the Hilton Tower since we didn't have a car either...  *Anyway*, back to Fujo...   I ordered some Unagi Nigiri, a Magician Roll, a Philly Roll and a Spicy Salmon Roll.   That was tons of food and I came nowhere close to finishing it all (though damn if I didn't try really hard!) and it all tasted quite good.  My wife went with the Pad Thai since she's not a sushi lover... She very much enjoyed the food too.  Fujo's is a nice place to eat or pick up food, especially if you're staying at the Hilton Hotel in Uptown Charlotte.   You don't get more convenient than that!"}
{"text":"Sat for five minutes at bar for lunch and served two people before seeing me. Had to flag down waiters.  Good price but sushi was dry. This place is not somewhere I would go unless it is not busy or not in a hurry for lunch."}
{"text":"Probably the only restaurant that the service was so terrible that I have left before getting my food. Me and my boyfriend went here with a groupon, that we had purchased specifically for Fujo. They refused to take it, and the manager told us, \"you have two choices, ask for a refund from groupon or just eat here without it.\" If we had been rude then I wouldn't be able to blame him, but we had politely and calmly spoke to them and asked about it. We walked out and went to Emzy for sushi instead and it had great service and excellent food."}
{"text":"The sushi is great! We ordered online and picked it up, and it was ready right away. This is definitely one of our favorite sushi spots in Charlotte! All the rolls we've gotten have been great. The spider roll is definitely one of our favorites here."}
{"text":"Fujo is one of my favorite place to get Chinese food in Charlotte. It's located inside Hilton Hotel. It's a good spot for lunch or dinner and I say that because I have been here for lunch as well as dinner. What I have noticed is that this place gets crowded pretty quickly in lunch time compare to dinner. The service is pretty standard to what you would expect from Chinese place however you get little more attention during dinner since it's not that crowded and I think the waitress is cute for dinner time LOL   The food is good for my taste where I tried to get anything cooked in garlic sauce and it just comes out to my taste :D I am big fan of veg lo mein and this place just hit the spot.   They also have small bar area. I think there is a patio area  if you prefer outdoor but make sure it's not windy because the one time we decided to seat out, it was pretty windy and we ended up moving inside.   Oh the other thing I noticed is that I think their price is pretty reasonable considering it's in uptown :D"}
{"text":"I truly enjoyed my visit here. Food was good and service my on point. Ended up leaving a couple extra dollars for the tip!"}
{"text":"Popped in here for lunch the other day while on vacation and loved it.  Great steamer selections which I love b/c they are ultra healthy.  They also have brown rice if you ask which is nice.  I haven't had the opportunity to try the sushi yet but I heard it's great.  Lucky for the Wells Fargo workers the location is perfect as you don't even have to leave the building to enjoy it!  I'm jealous!"}
{"text":"I got the pad thai. The noodles were good but nothing special, with a fairly standard pad thai recipe. Be sure to add some hot sauce for a little kick. That said, the $8 price point is pretty great, especially at a time when most uptown lunches are pushing $10+ for much smaller portions."}
{"text":"I had been traveling all day and was so hungry.  I had gone to a sushi restaurant up the street but they were packed on a Monday night but not so packed they didn't have tables... Just understaffed and it was clear after waiting 20 minutes that I needed to leave if I wanted food.    Here, I was seated immediately.  I ordered the crab Rangoon which was some of the best I've ever had.  It was hot and fresh.  The sushi was really good but not great.  I loved the Volcano Roll but the Shrimp Tempura roll is were my meal fell short.  The roll had so much breading that it was not enjoyable.  I chose to fill up on the other parts of my meal and leave that roll behind.  Overall, great and quick option.  I'd be interested to see if the Chinese dishes are better than the sushi."}
{"text":"Bought a Groupon here to try it out, and decided to buy another because we knew we'd come back!  Go for dinner, sit outside, and enjoy an amazing view of downtown, something you can't really get from many uptown restaurants. Views of many buildings, but set back from the street, just a really great location for evening.  Sushi: they have interesting rolls like ones with sweet potatoes that I've never seen any where else. Really yummy sushi of all types.  Drinks: really good mixed drinks and sake! Limited wine and beer.  Service: Truly excellent!"}
{"text":"I'm not even halfway through my dinner, and I'm impressed. Seaweed salad's refreshing, salmon skin roll crispy, caterpillar roll tasty, and firecracker roll is a perfect balance of flavor. The delivery guy was nice and patient with me. I'm just a tourist but would be very happy as a repeat customer."}
{"text":"White tuna sushi was great! But the Pad Thai just ok.  Next time i'll stick to the sushi"}
{"text":"You know with some many other options for the same type of food in uptown there is definitley better. However these people are quick and is usually not super crowded so if your looking for a quick decent lunch it's not bad."}
{"text":"I've been here for a few times now, and I'm an Asian. So I believe I can weigh in here. It is good enough to make a default quick dinner choice. The selection of food is good. From sushi to general Tao chicken... The service is also not bad. However this is considered on par given its prime location. The reason why I shed two stars is that first, the food quality isn't consistent. Appetizer in general is not bad. The crispy roll, seaweed salad, dumplings... you can't go wrong. The entree sometimes can't make me eat half of it; Sometimes it is good. it's like a lottery. Another star shed because they got my order wrong.... twice... considering I've dined here about less than 7 times, it is pretty bad."}
{"text":"Tend to get food to go from here during lunch but the few times I have dined in for dinner, the service has been great. The sushi and the food isn't the greatest though. My boyfriend thought it was disgusting but he kept eating so not sure about his take. The Godzilla roll is huge, enough to feed two people. Do yourself a favor and DO NOT get the Singapore noodles or the wonton soup."}
{"text":"This is the first time I've been here.  First of all the Singapore Noodles was the best I have ever tasted in my life and I've had several.  The waitress was great.  The bus boy literally came around every 5 minutes to make sure everyone had water and he took the dirty dishes away right away.  I don't mind saying I may eat here again tomorrow!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night, and it wasn't too busy so it seems to be a great place for the weekends if you don't like loud, crowded dining. Service was prompt and friendly, and the food came out in a timely manner. Can't really ask for more.   On top of that, I had a $30 Groupon voucher so the price was pretty solid. For a party of 2, we ordered a miso soup for each of us, two sushi rolls, and a chicken pad thai. It was enough food to get us over the $30 mark and we couldn't even finish half the pad thai, so YAY to leftovers."}
{"text":"Yum! Maybe not the easiest to find tucked inside a Wells Fargo building. Well worth it once you get in. Prices are pretty good.   What you get for the money: great sushi and great Japanese. They do not cook at the table. This is better quality. The veggies were cooked perfect.   On this visit, I had the garlic beef. Yum and be sure to grab a mint if you're on your way back to the office. Ask for your sauces like hot sauce or duck sauce. It is not on the table, but they have.  The service was great. I got drink refills without asking and they generally left us alone so we could talk. Perfect."}
{"text":"Best Sushi Anywhere - I have had sushi in countries all over the world and nothing compares to Fujo.You can't go wrong with any of the rolls.Try the SCALLOP.  My favorite"}
{"text":"This review does not apply to sushi. The Chinese food here are typical American Chinese, which is ok. I do enjoy the friendliness and clean dining area. Nothing special, but good place to go for lunch. I might try sushi next time."}
{"text":"OMG... Fujo, how would I have spent my days in Charlotte without you. Every day / every other day, lunch would comprise of a  - crab rangoons - tricolor sushi roll - futomaki roll  - at times a unagi / tamago / salmon sushi and a seaweed salad - at other times chinese food with the hot and sour soup  For dinner, it would be the szechuan tofu.   There you go! Fujo took care of my meals for those times I was in Charlotte :)"}
{"text":"This gem of a place is an awesome lunch spot in uptown charlotte located in the Wells Fargo building.  The service is on point at lunch.  I recommend getting there before 11:45 or you might have to wait.  Fujos packs up their to-go orders really well too, for those in a rush.  Their lunch specials are reasonably priced and everything is delicious.  I usually go with the sushi roll lunch special with a side salad.  The spicy tuna is my choice.  Today I switched it up and went with the hot lava roll.  I've also had the Godzilla roll.  Both rolls are really incredible!!!!!    Be on the look out for Groupons or living social coupons for Fujos!"}
{"text":"Got the steak tataki roll and Cajun roll. Both are very good and filling. Atmosphere is nice. Hubby got sesame chicken and they give you a large portion. Food is very good and the plating is nice. My only complaint is that we went twice and both servers were not good. First one was a little cocky and arrogant. Second server really didn't care about his job. He literally walked up to us and didn't greet us but said \"Want anything besides water?\" Not a lot of other tables were there but he was super slack. Drinks were low and the manager/owner actually walked out of his office to give us refills. Server then asked if we wanted dessert and we declined. You would of thought he would bring the check out to us after that. No, he didn't. We waited there for over 10 minutes and didn't see him. He finally walked by us and looked dumbfounded and asked \"Oh, did you want your check or something?\" Overall, manager is nice and food is good. Also nice they will stamp your parking pass if you park in the Wells Fargo garage."}
{"text":"The sushi was fresh and delicious! I grabbed some take out while staying in the hotel next door and it was ready in ~10 minutes!"}
{"text":"I have had a lot of good sushi in Charlotte, but the Godzilla roll at Fujo just completely blew me away.  It is the best sushi I have ever had.  Delicious just doesn't fully describe it.  When the menu says \"Must try\" they aren't kidding.  It is spicy tuna and avocado fried tempura style and topped with special sauce.  The sauce was superb.  The roll is large, so it is a good one to share, but you won't want to because you will want to eat it all yourself."}
{"text":"Great Chinese/sushi.  Decent prices.  Quick and friendly service.  What more can you ask for a sit-down lunch joint?  General chicken is always a favorite, and with HUGE portions, you'll probably end up taking some to put in the work fridge for lunch tomorrow!  Sushi is fresh and yummy.  I wouldn't order a salad there, though.  I tried that route one time and was completely underwhelmed.  But that's what you get for ordering a salad at a Chinese restaurant!  Great choice for a quick, delicious sit-down lunch!  Also, who doesn't love a fortune cookie?!"}
{"text":"Always great service and awesome food! Passing by the restaurant and smelling the aroma makes you want to stop in and ask for a fresh plate of food! They always serve a lot of food and it tastes amazing! Great Asian food in Uptown :)"}
{"text":"This is the worst sushi place in charlotte. Their communication is ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE. My boyfriend and I bought the groupon only to find out later it was dine in only. We finally set a time to go eat in the restaurant after a Bobcats game. The website clearly stated the restaurant closed at 10pm. We arrived at 930 to eat and were told the kitchen was closed and even though we had walked out of the way to eat there that they won't honor the groupon to go. Already I am completely discussed by the service and business all together."}
{"text":"I haven't ever been to Fujo for lunch, but my husband and I go all the time for dinner- and we are never disappointed!  We have had the traditional Chinese dishes and the sushi and have always enjoyed our meals.  The wait staff is usually a little less attentive then you find in chain restaurants around, but they are easily able to find if you need something. The manager (owner?) is always very nice and always comes by the table to see how everything is. Parking uptown can be annoying, so they validate your parking ticket (after 5pm) for the deck in the Hilton- which is always nice!"}
{"text":"I was traveling for work and stayed at the Hilton so figured I would check Fujo out. Great service and really delicious sushi! The prices were very reasonable and the portions were large. I got a spicy tuna roll (always good) and a volcano roll and they were so good. I also got a rainbow martini, which was yummy. I'll definitely go back when I travel to Charlotte."}
{"text":"This food is delicious. I love the indoor and outdoor seating. The servers are very nice. I will say that when they are busy and you call for take-out, the young lady can be very rude. She speaks all over you when you are trying to order. Other than that, this is a great restuarant for lunch. I am a fan!"}
{"text":"This is a great little lunch place. Service is fast and selection is good. Menu items are clearly listed and and there is plenty to choose from, vegetarian and non-vegetarian items alike. Prices are fair, and there is nothing to complain about here. Food was very tasty and portions more than fair.   A great place to hit in between work meetings. Good food, you can be out in no time! I think they may also do take-out."}
{"text":"I can't even give them one star... Earlier this week I decided to order a rather large order to be delivered. I was going to give most of the food to my boyfriend once he got home. I started sampling a few crab rangoons, a bite of the fried tofu, and some egg drop soup. Not even 30-40 minutes after consuming the food I began to vomit uncontrollably which lasted for hours into the night. Needless to say I tossed the food out so my boyfriend wouldn't get sick.   I called Fujo the following day after I got home from work and talked to what sounded like a hostess. I explained my story and asked if I could have a refund for the $30 of food I ordered. She said because I did not call that night when it happened that that would not be possible but that she would have the owner call me back. It has been a few days and I have yet to hear anything.  I am a college graduate of the local Culinary school hear in Charlotte and I am extremely displeased in how unprofessional this restaurant has handled their poor sanitation issue regarding a customer. I will not be returning, and I will be sure to warn my friends."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I come here all the time. They have a great groupon deal and the sushi is killer! Seriously, the hot lava and tsunami rolls are incredible. Like beyond incredible! I don't know why this place isn't always packed. If you like cream cheese, the tsunami is def for you. And all the fish taste so fresh! Srsly the best sushi joint in CLT. support these amazing chefs!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent service , food was absolutely delicious. We tried 4 different sushi rolls; Rainbow naruto , steak tataki , avocado roll, buddha roll. Oh my gosh I loved all but my fav was the Buddha roll(sweet potato, cucumber & cream cheese). I def recommend this place. If your ever in uptown Charlotte you must visit this sushi  joint"}
{"text":"Came to Fujo for a quick lunch in between meetings as I was in the mood for some sushi. They sat me at the bar area and were very attentive as I mentioned I was looking to be in and out as quickly as possible.   When it comes to sushi I'm a big shrimp tempura fan, so I asked if they could specifically make that roll for me with just shrimp and asparagus. They were very accommodating and had the roll made within 10 minutes during what was a pretty busy lunch period. The roll was good, but definitely nothing special compared to other sushi places. The service was great though and they have a great lunch menu that's everything under 10 dollars.   Solid place with good sushi but nothing mind blowing."}
{"text":"I was starving and this was the closest place to my hotel. Friendly staff. I ordered the Ginger salad (the dressing is true Ginger so I can't complain, but I think I'm used to the watered down/ fake kind- ha!) I had the shrimp tempura roll and then a shrimp/ crab/ cream cheese roll that was good. Pleasant atmosphere, nice wine list."}
{"text":"If you live uptown, this is the only place for serious Chinese and Japanese food that delivers. You have to beg sometimes, but they'll do it as long as you're not a crappy tipper. They have never forgotten anything in my order and come prepared with utensils, sauces, and napkins.  Closed Sunday's."}
{"text":"Decent Asian lunch fare in Uptown. All the reviews saying don't go during peak lunch hours are spot on. Looong wait if you do. The sushi is good not great and the typical Generaol Tso's type Chinese fare is darn good!"}
{"text":"I went on a Saturday at lunch not very busy ... Friday I went by for lunch and it was busy with the downtown office people. Service and food was great... got the dragon and volcano rolls very good! And tasty fried dumplings... if I ever find myself in Charlotte again I will return."}
{"text":"Good sushi for a good price. Excellent spring rolls and egg drop soup as well. Great service and really enjoyed the patio outside. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"I finally decided to take the long walk across uptown to check out Fujo.  Being that I had to be back for a 1:00 meeting I called my order in around 11:55 and was told 15 minutes.  From the menu online I was a little disappointed to not see Sushi Lunch Options, like a few others in Uptown offer.  I ordered the miso soup, ginger salad and the Charlotte Delight Roll (tuna, steamed shrimp and avocado inside; white tuna, tuna and avocado on top). By the time I arrived I paid at the counter and my order was just coming out of the kitchen, perfect timing.  The miso was good, but definitely needed to be reheated in the microwave, I like my soup hot, not just warm.  The salad, just okay. The ginger dressing was a little runny then others I have enjoyed. Good flavor, but not my favorite. As for the Charlotte Roll, awesome.  The amount of fish was great and it was very fresh. The rice was perfectly cooked and not too much either, just the right amount.  Overall I was very satisfied, but would love a few sushi lunch options. And, one thing to note, although I did not dine in, the restaurant was packed, with a wait list, at 10 and 12.  Something to remember if you are headed that way."}
{"text":"Decent food, acceptable prices, and speedy lunch service keep Fujo slammed each and every workday lunch break.  As the other reviewers have mentioned, it's a good idea to get there before (or after) peak lunch time, as the speedy service is wiped out when you have to wait 10 minutes for a table.  The food is good, not great, and is a bit benign on the creativity scale.  It's a fairly straightforward asian fusion place that offers americanized versions of Chinese and other Asian cuisine.  It's really not that special, and some dishes (Singapore noodles) you wonder why they're charging $9 for them.  It's a safe place to go for the less-than-adventurous lunch crowd that's looking to \"try something new\".  It won't knock your socks off, but it's not going to be bad either."}
{"text":"This is a good place for Sushi Lunch Special when you're are Uptown.  The order comes with 2 rolls of your choice and a soup or salad.  I usually get Miso or Hot & Sour Seafood soup.  Both are good but are very salty.  Be prepare to drink a lot of water after your soup.  The Sushi is made by a Japanese Sushi Chef which is always a good thing.   Another good healthy lunch item here is the Steamed Vegetables that I have ordered with Shrimp. The portion is large and the vegetables are steamed just right.  I agreed with Aymie C. that the Greeter/Hostess here can be aloof and not the most frendly."}
{"text":"Every city has a place like this.  It's a semi-upscale Chinese restaurant that also serves sushi.  While in Charlotte on a trip, I found Fujo on the ground floor of the hotel/office building complex I was staying at.  Luckily, I also found a Groupon for a slightly cheaper meal option. While Fujo isn't outrageously expensive, the discount definitely made it worth trying.   Suprisingly, Fujo wasn't busy at all early Friday evening.  As such, the service was attentive and the food came out quickly.  Of course, the food is the key here, so let's review and discuss.  Pan fried pork dumplings? Ok.  They were slightly oily coming out of the fryer and the sauce with it could've benefited from a touch of spice. The General Tso's Chicken was of high quality, but had way too much citrus taste and not enough spice.  Heck, to be honest, it had no spice.  In short.  Neat location.  Great service.  Food needs some improvement."}
{"text":"I want to preface this by letting you know  that I am not picky about my sushi. But, unfortunately, I had the worst sushi I've ever had at Fujo.   We split a salmon roll, a spicy tuna roll and a Godzilla roll. The salmon was too tough to be chewed. The spicy tuna roll had tempura flakes on the outside that tasted horribly stale and like they'd been cooked in extremely rancid oil. The Godzilla roll was yummy but not amazing - it was the most redeeming part of the meal for sure though. We also tried the sesame tofu and it was a huge disappointment - the tofu was so hard it was difficult to chew and it came with almost no veggies (4 tiny broccoli florets don't count). Our server was friendly and attentive and that's what's keeping this review from being a lower one. I didn't send anything back or complain to the server because it was a week night, we were tired, and we knew we wouldn't be back again.   All in all, it was def not my best groupon date night. Live and learn!"}
{"text":"Fancy name; great location; not so good food! Less than average Chinese restaurant... Visited for lunch because it was within close proximity of my job.. Won't ever do it again!!"}
{"text":"This is a great spot for lunch if you're in the uptown area. The food came out so quick, tasted fresh and flavorful and came at a great price. They offer a lunch menu where you can get a couple rolls and salad or soup for under $15. The location is cool. I really recommend checking it out!"}
{"text":"Not worth wasting your lunch hour here.  Mediocre sushi with VERY slow service. Much better Asian restaurants downtown and definitely much better service."}
{"text":"Sushi didn't taste very fresh.  Rolls were very boring and had a bland flavor.  Descriptions didn't really match the signature rolls.  nigiri had too much rice and over powered the sashimi."}
{"text":"Foja was recommended by a coworker and to be honest it was great. The atmosphere was welcoming and romantic. He location is prefect in the heart of downtown Charlotte. It was not too busy which made it even better.   Now let's get to the important stuff and that is the food. We started of with the steam dumplings which were cooked perfectly. The dumplings were tender, fluffy, and savory.   I ordered the Hawaiian fried rice which was prepared with soy sauce. (Server suggested the soy sauce). The dish was well balanced and the pineapples added a different touch (sweet & salty). However, my only suggestion is that the pineapples should be cut in smaller pieces.  My wife ordered sushi rolls (Godzilla & Magician) these were fresh and savory. The caviar on the magician roll had a sweet and beautiful touch to the dish.   This was a great spot and we will be coming back again."}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant while visiting Charlotte. Servers were friendly, attentive, and prompt. Sushi was of very good quality."}
{"text":"In an attempt to rid myself of the bad taste left by some dreadful airport sushi I had the other day, I was eager to get back to my favorite sushi place in Charlotte. I played it safe and went with my two favorite specialty rolls: the Philly Melt and the Hot Lava.  Fujo's Philly Melt is my favorite cream cheese roll I've ever had...it just melts in your mouth. Still, my very favorite overall is the Hot Lava roll. I swear, I would bath in the hot lava sauce if I could. Although not quite big enough to accommodate an adult male body, it is pretty huge and I've been known to dip other rolls in what's left over.   I always tell myself to try some of the other specialty rolls but I can't bring myself to pass on my two faves...It might require me to develop a new allergy to shrimp or cream cheese.  UPDATE: Dined in for the first time yesterday. I arrived around 6:00 and there were only two couples there. Needless to say, I was seated immediately and was waited on by like 3 different people. The service was very good and very fast...I think they refilled my water like 5 times in the half hour I was there.   I wanted to try some rolls I've never had, so I ordered the Tokyo, Godzilla, and Sunset rolls. The Tokyo roll was unique in that it was fried and then re-rolled in rice. The Godzilla roll was delicious but it was pretty similar to the Philly Melt, which I prefer because of the cream cheese. The Sunset roll was my favorite because of the yummy garlic sauce. By using a Groupon, I got all three rolls for less than $20 after tax and tip. Not bad at all!  UPDATE: Ordered the Magician's Roll, Cajun Roll, and the Panther Roll. Of the three, the Panther Roll was my favorite, which is hard for me to admit given that I'm a Giants fan and I hate Cam Newton. My least favorite was the Magician's Roll, although it did look pretty amazing with all the colorful caviar. I ordered the Cajun Roll because I've never had crawfish in sushi and the cajun spice sounded intriguing, but it wasn't as flavorful as I had hoped."}
{"text":"Went for a company dinner. Had the general tsao chicken entree. It's was very flavorful, but not overwhelmingly spicy. Wonton soup and dumplings were delicious as well. Priced very reasonably as well!"}
{"text":"Had the fried dumplings, Kung Pow Chicken. Dumplings were good tasting but small and the wonton not fried crisp. Kung Pow chicken came with red bell pepper and no peanuts.  Not the description in the menu.  I sat at the Sushi Bar, which was fine but the help tended to congregate there watching the Basketball game."}
{"text":"They delivered dinner right to my hotel room door.  With a $20 minimum dinner order they'll deliver for free.  When it comes to sushi it's easy to spend that much.  I ordered a serving of won ton soup, the tempura roll, the lobster roll, and a bottle of water for a total of $25 before tip.  The won ton soup hit the spot.  The broth with scallions was delicous with a hint of ginger without being spicy.  It was only two or three won tons, but it was enough of a serving.  The tempura roll was average and fine.  The lobster roll was a huge disappointment.  The menu description was boiled lobter with cucumber.  And it was just that, but the lobster was hard, like cardboard, and hard to chew.  It came with duck sauce and soy sauce, but that didn't help.  I couldn't eat it all, and I love lobster.  I would try them again, especially since they deliver, but I would order different rolls."}
