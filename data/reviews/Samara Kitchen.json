{"text":"Definitely must try Indonesian food. The service was great and friendly. Very good atmosphere little place. It's a hidden gem. On weekends, they serve special dish and dessert."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised with how nice the staff is and how good the food was.  Had the Samara Noodles and would definitely come back for it again.  The only thing is the language barrier makes it a little difficult to understand. They make up for it by being very accommodating and wanting to make sure each customer is satisfied. 5/5"}
{"text":"A must try.. Great tasting authentic Indonesian food.  Location: A corner unit of an office plaza. Make sure you note the address and unit number as the sign is not that visible from the road. It is a small joint that seat approx 10-15 people.  Service: We had 3 groups came at around the same time so the place wqs packed. However, the wait time was descent. The owner was very friendly and accommodating.  Finally.. food: Amazing taste. Really authentic. We tried mie goreng, batagor, gulai sapi, risoles and satay ayam, and all were satisfying. Sometimes they have items that are not in the menu so you may want to ask for them.  Overall, the restaurant is highly recommended and I will certainly return for more."}
{"text":"Very good small joint, the only downside is the indo menu needing owner 's personal interpretation."}
{"text":"My parents just tried this restaurant today. My dad was born and raised in Indonesia and they had just come back from a trip there and said this food was quite authentic and comparable! They had the satay, mie goreng and iga cemplung (beef soup) and said all were delicious. The restaurant is family owned and service was very warm, friendly and attentive. Worth the trip out to Mississauga (we're from Markham)!"}
{"text":"Authentic Indonesian food with great price and great staff. The place is a bit hidden but worth finding it. Definitely a MUST try"}
{"text":"Great food! I've never had Indonesian food before but the server helped explain what a lot of the menu items were. The beef rendang was especially delicious! Prices were also very reasonable.  Only downside is that the restaurant is really small, so you might have to be prepared to get takeout if you come."}
{"text":"Samara. A tiny place with a big surprise of deliciousness for us. Found this gem on Yelp (where else?) and we were not disappointed to have come here for our weekend treat. We ordered the Mei Goreng-a noodle dish that was just perfect to satisfy my noodle craving. We also had the Beef Rendang that came with prata (you can have it with rice too). The dish was really amazing, delicately flavoured and thoughtfully made. I noticed that it  taste almost  like the Filipino beef kaldereta without the coconut milk/cream. For sure we will come back to try everything in the menu. Great food  experience for us."}
{"text":"samara has all of the attributes that make for a perfect restaurant.  it's tiny, it's in the most inconspicuous location, the staff are friendly, the food seems pretty authentic (i can't speak to this though), and it seems family-owned.  it smells amazing inside, and by peering into the visible kitchen, you can easily tell that they're brewing up a bunch of rich, tasty indonesian dishes with all of the colourful ingredients and spices.  i ordered the beef rendang, mie goreng, and the gulai sapi.  i'm confident in saying that their rendang i've ever had.  tender beef cubes cooked slowly in the complex blend of rendang spices.  the mie goreng was insanely delicious - fried noodles, chinese broccoli, and chicken slices all marinating in a predominant sweet-but-not-too-sweet kind of sauce.  gulai sapi is a unique and interesting beef curry dish with a strong lemongrass flavour.  tasty, but i'm not sure i would order it again.  i should mention that the rendang and mie goreng were topped with fried shallots, which is objectively the greatest topping you can put on any dish, and thus samara has displayed towering achievements in culinary excellence.  these kinds of small restaurant businesses are the ones i love to support. recommended for fans of thai and indian cuisines.  indonesian joints are far and few around here, so go ahead and try what samara has to offer!"}
{"text":"The second Indonesian restaurant finally opens in GTA! My husband and I drove all the way from Markham to Mississauga to try this new place after my husband's colleague told him about Samara Kitchen. The owner said they just opened about 1.5 months ago.   The restaurant was pretty small, more for a take out place but there were couple tables and chairs for those who preferred to dine in. The place can accommodate about 10 people dine in. When we came on Saturday afternoon, we were the only customers dined in and other people mostly were ordering take out.   We ordered quite plenty of food just for the two of us because there were so many interesting Indonesian food we wanted to try. We ordered rendang fried rice, beef gulai, sate kambing/goat satay (not in the menu), mie goreng (fried noodle), and homemade sweet iced tea. Everything was delicious, even the iced tea tasted like iced tea in Indonesia. Our favorites were the mie goreng and beef gulai. We definitely recommend it to everyone who miss or who wants to try Indonesian food. The owner was very friendly too. We will come back again to try their other menu. It was worth a drive to Mississauga."}
{"text":"First, this place is pretty small!  I counted and there were about 5 tables X 2pp.  So not ideal for large groups.  Second, it's in a weird industrial area.  Expect A LOT of tractor trailers while driving up.  It's the first unit when you pull up into the complex, but there's only a small sign on the awning directly above the door.  Third, if you've never had Indonesian food, the owner calls it a mix of \"Thai/Malaysian/Singaporean\".  And yes, they do have pad thai as well!  I could be wrong, but I'm pretty sure they don't serve pork.  Not sure about whether or not it's Halal, but there's no pork on the menu or hidden in their lumpia (spring rolls).  I tried their Beef Rendang, Curry Chicken w/ prata (parantha), and calamari.  Beef Rendang stood out above everything else that was ordered.  It was \"different\" than just Beef Curry.  Beef was stewed and the gravy had coconut.  It's home cooking, so nothing is heavily salted or too oily.  If you like curries, this is a good alternative that doesn't sit heavy in your stomach.  Desserts are only served during the weekend.  And you may hafta ask what they specials are that are written on the black board because I wasn't familiar with any of them.  I'd definitely go back to try other items on the menu, but keep in mind that the surrounding streets are quite busy especially during rush hour!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty hidden and when you walk in don't hesitate and attempt walk away, which is what I almost did when I came into a restaurant the size of my bedroom. One large table was occupied and what was left was a tiny table for 2. The owner/server was very friendly and when he realized that we didn't understand the menu he kindly made some recommendations, whereby he suggested a vegan dish for my brother, which was this vegetable stew (forgot the name). He also got their tempeh, which I found quite unique for an asian restaurant to have. but apparently tempeh is very common in Indonesia. I ordered the chicken satay with rice. The food took like 20ish minutes to arrive but I wasn't expecting anything else considering that there was no staff or chefs, just the family managing the entire restaurant. The portion sizes were pretty small, but the flavours made up for it. The sauce on my chicken was so good to the point where I was licking my plate clean. My brother enjoyed the stew but he was more in awe for the tempeh. Prices were reasonable and I would love to go back to try some other of their unique dishes. Most of all I'd like to comment on the server (or owner...I'm not sure) who was extremely accommodating. I hope they expand this restaurant as that would definitely increase their popularity."}
{"text":"If you look authentic Indonesian food in city, you can find in here.  The owner and the cook is from Indonesia. They are so friendly and care with their customers. The have very good Rendang Beef, the meat just melt in your mouth. The sate ayam and sate kambing to die for....is awesome! They have more Indonesia food you should try on! Make sure you coming with empty tummy so you can try lots Indonesian food in here."}
