{"text":"Can someone please tell me why their service is so incredibly slow. It's an ice cream store surrounded by young children? Have more employees? I was in line for an hour before getting served. I feel sorry FOR MYSELF"}
{"text":"I was hesitant to give them 2 stars but what they have a nice patio with a private parking with lots of seating.   I came to inquire about ordering a custom cake for my daughter's birthday and ordered a caramel sundae while I was at it. The ice cream was pretty standard but the caramel consistency was too thin.   For the cakes, the worker or Manager passed me a large binder for cake picture options.  The pictures or clips were straight from the 80s, there was even a clip that said \"1983\"!! The clip arts were outdated and the binder was dirty. Normally DQ accepts a customer's file if they wanted to customize their cake with their own photo. ...however, this DQ DOES NOT accept the files or customization. They did not tell me that I could order a customized cake online as well from another store. I didn't know that online cake ordering existed. They were not helpful!   When I got home,  I called the Kennedy store and the Manager told me about the online website to order cakes, where you can add your own image if you pteferredl. They were surprised that the Main St. Markham doesn't allow for that level of customization.  Overall:  I will still revisit if I need a last minute cake but will not order the customized cake and caramel sundaes."}
{"text":"Food: 3 stars Its not as bad as other review says. Its dairy queen, the softserve along with blizzard is the same as the other ones I go to. The hot food though is slightly less amazing, but I wouldn't go as far to say its 1 star. Its hot, and taste at par. Wouldn't and didn't expect more tbh.   Service: 4 stars Fast food place with very little people, so there was practically no wait. Service was nice, she was informative, nothing to complain.   Location/ambiance: 3stars There're 2 tables inside the store and I believ they put a couple out door towards the main street as well. I highly doubt alot of people would want to stay there to dine in :P  Price: 3 stars Slightly pricey for the hot dog. As far as the icecream goes, its just the regular price   Parking: 4 stars There's a huge parking lot behind the east side stores along main street that's free of charge. There're mostly vacant spots, there. But during holidays, it would be jam packed and would have to wait for a spot."}
{"text":"First time contributor to Yelp and hopefully my review will convince you NOT to shop this store if you are looking for a pleasant experience.  To be clear the DQ/Orange Julius store is at  531 Atkinson Ave Unit 12, Thornhill inside the  Rosedale Heights Plaza  WARNING - THIS STORE DOESN'T SUPPORT THE BLIZZARD UPSIDE DOWN POLICY!  AWFUL Experience (s) and NO customer support and/or service. WORST FRANCHISE OWNER - ALBERT  We have visited this DQ/Orange Julius several times over recent years. We put up with their higher prices compared to other DQ's in the area's because its convenient and their poorly trained staff.  Recently we had 2 issues within less then 1 week and this time we decided to something about it as the DQ staff didn't know how to fix and lied to us because they are not in compliance with providing satisfactory customer service.  We left a message for the manager  as well we wrote to a complaint to head office. The  store manager/Owner - Albert is an absentee owner who visits for short periods of time and has high staff turnover. In fact, there usually is a paper sign on the door advertising for staff. BUT more important is that Albert doesn't care what customer's have to say because its not about a pleasant DQ experience but rather its about him being right and money - he loves to take your money.  Albert goes out of his way to advise you that all the goodwill that is built in the DQ/Orange Julius brand and name is good for business and charging MORE but he won't stand behind the DQ/Orange Julius policies. Albert claims its understood that as a DQ franchisee he can choose which DQ product policy to support.  Albert doesn't agree with enforcing the upside Blizzard policy.  Albert's DQ policy is that the well known and publicized Blizzard policy is determined by the independent franchise owner of each restaurant. HOWEVER THERE ARE NO INDICATORS AND/OR SIGNS THAT SUGGEST ALBERT'S STORE DOESN'T SUPPORT THE POLICY  Albert wants you to find out about his policy AFTER his employee's were negligent and then they will advise you their store doesn't participate in this Blizzard promotion.  Please read the web link to best understand - Blizzards derive their name from being so thoroughly cold that they can be held upside-down without any spillage. Employees will frequently demonstrate this to customers.   There is a company policy that one Blizzard per order is to be flipped upside-down by the employee. If this does not occur, the customer may request a coupon for a free Blizzard to use on their next visit.  1 - DQ Will Now Be Enforcing its Upside Down Blizzard Rule ( you will receive a coupon good for a free Blizzard on your next visit. Yes, even at the drive-thrus.)  https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2016/01/dq-will-now-be-enforcing-the-upside-down-blizzard.html   2 - Dairy Queen速 Canada launches new \"Upside Down or Free\" guarantee with a gravity defying circus performance (Dairy Queen速 Canada's new Upside Down or Free guarantee. DQ速 Canada promises to serve its iconic Blizzard速 treat upside down and if not, it's free. https://www.corporate.nestle.ca/en/media/pressreleases/dairy-queen-kit-kat-blizzard-treat   3 - Dairy Queen employees reveal the secrets they don't tell customers  http://www.thisisinsider.com/dairy-queen-employees-reveal-the-secrets-they-dont-tell-customers-2017-7    Albert, if you get to read this review there is a simple solution. A sign in your store that states   'We do not participate in the upside-down Blizzard promotion.' Handwritten underneath it: 'Please don't ask.'\"   So here, in the fine print, lies the underlying truth--you'll only be served an upside-down Blizzard at *participating* DQ locations."}
{"text":"Just another DQ - great location though.  This DQ has its own parking lot and a small patio great for summer weather.   We ordered their $6 combo - fries, coke, cheeseburger, and a caramel sundae, a cookie dough blizzard, a strawberry blizzard, two grilled ranch chicken wraps, and a chocolate dipped cone. The burger was pretty good - better than McDonald's, the fries were greasy but nice and slightly crispy, and the wraps were okay. The ice cream itself is good amd sweet but I feel like its quality has gone down over the years. The chocolate dipped cone was also drippy - not hard enough for that crunchy, solid chocolate layer.   I'd go here again for a quick ice cream fix but it's not top quality creamy ice cream if you're looking for that."}
{"text":"It is a nice clean place, dairy queen ice cream is always so good."}
{"text":"Got a chocolate DRIPPED cone here : (  The ice cream wasn't cold enough to freeze the chocolate and it was DRIPPING............. Told them that I wanted my money back and the lady gave me an Orange Julius instead.  It wasn't cold and tasted weird!   The worst DQ!"}
{"text":"This DQ has the worst service of all the DQs in the GTA. Moving forward I'll be taking my business to the one by Yonge and empress. They try to put in surcharges for every little thing and all staff seems to have this high and mighty attitude about them. For example for a blizzard I asked for just strawberry sauce and pecan. I've done this b4 at several other DQ. No issues. They go and say yeah we need to charge extra. It's just two things guys. I'm not asking for 50 toppings. Also asking for the takeout tray and tops we got looks. They didn't flip the 2nd blizzard upside down either but my wife just was tired dealing w them."}
{"text":"Haha like the other user said... the Customer service is non-existent... zombie workers that just don't care.. \"can I get a spoon(4my sundae)\" -uh I guess, hold on... really?? How else was I gonna eat it... I'll pass on the lid, that might have your head explode.  2nd the prices are $1 over everyone else Hwy 7 charge 2.99 small cone 399 here. Small sundae was 439, 329 at hwy7"}
{"text":"We spend a lot of time in Unionville in the summer. This is one of the better DQ's i've been to. When i say better i'm referring to how they make the blizzards and frozen drinks. I don't have to request that enough or more syrup is added to my Misty nor do i have to tell them to make sure the toppings in my blizzard are mixed throughout. Very friendly staff and no complaints about products from them. I see that a lot of people are referring to their food, i can't comment because i've never eaten there. We love the local restaurants and having DQ there for dessert and a nice walk along the street."}
{"text":"Love the new flavour but disappointed because there is no combo available like in the website.It said $6 with fries and cheeseburger plus add a dollar and you'll upgrade into a blizzard! Sounds a very good deal to try until it comes to a realization that's not actually offered in the actual store-kind of deceiving,nonetheless; love the new flavour"}
{"text":"Typical DQ location. Love the peanut butter parfait, my favourite thing to get here on a hot summer day."}
