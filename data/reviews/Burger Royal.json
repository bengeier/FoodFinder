{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would. The combination of horrendous service with sarcastic and unhelpful servers made this perhaps the worst place I've encountered in Montreal. While trying to order delivery, they refused to serve us because our phone numbers weren't local landlines...the fact that we don't have them, but do have a very real local address, didn't seem to matter. We were hung up on twice, and I would never recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I was surprised at how packed the restaurant was when I arrived! I actually visited Burger Royal with a Groupon deal so I had to make a reservation prior to visiting. I ended up having to wait for an empty table because the restaurant was so full!   The burgers were extremely juicy, delicious, and well made. I thought it was definitely worth the price for the quality I've been given, and I felt relatively healthy(?) after my meal because I didn't find the burger to be as greasy as it is at other places. The poutine was so, so delicious! I was surprised at how small the portion was - it's not enough for two, it's a 1 poutine per person kind of size.   I'd definitely come back and order some of their other burgers because they're amazing! I think it's one of the best burger joints in Montreal!! I can't give it 5 because I had to wait 30+ minutes even though I had a reservation."}
{"text":"This local burger restaurant is an excellent place to crack down your burger cravings. The first thing I notice when I walked in was that the restaurant was reasonably busy, which nudge that it must have a good reputation. The place seemed very clean while the staffs were welcoming, polite and bilingual (English and French). On the menu, you had a lot of choices on the different kinds of burgers with the options of three different size of patty that cost more as they get bigger. I had the \"I love bacon burger\", which had two thick strips of maple smoke bacon that actually made an impact on the taste of the burger, unlike Wendy's Baconnator, that just taste like grease. I choose the medium size patty as I ask for it medium rare, which it was. The burger was delicious as I also had a side of fries that cost extra though they were good as well. I rated this place a 4 out of 5 stars because my total bill came over 20$ for just a burger and fries, which I didn't even have a drink. The food was excellent but I cannot imagine going on dates at this place every week and fork out at least 40$ without a soda for the atmosphere it has comparing to other local burger joints with the same atmosphere that's a lot cheaper. As I mention, there is nothing wrong with the food, it is just slightly over price in my opinion."}
{"text":"Fantastic burger joint! Fresh products, cool staff and great vibes. At first I found it to be a bit pricey,  but that's the price to pay for great burgers I imagine. Either way, they have an original range of choices to choose from and will satisfy most burger enthusiasts."}
{"text":"Excellent burger avec des frites qui ont du goût. Les sauces sont maison! Grand choix pour les burger et tous aussi bon.  En fait ce n est pas l originalité du menu qui en fait un très bon burger mais les ingrédients 'frais' qu ils contiennent!  Service très aimable.  On ne peut pas appeler ça un fast fond car c est un resto ou on a envie de rester et de se poser ( on en ressort pas avec l odeur des frites en prime )"}
{"text":"Do you were to eat a very good burger?? Go to burger royal!! There I ate a mushroom melt mmmmm very good but it is a bit pricy. When you go there just eat and the bill after!! Just in joy this good and jucy burger!"}
{"text":"If you come here, prepare to go all out. On money and stomach space.  The classic burger, fries, and milkshake joint. And maybe a side of Mac n cheese.  Love the concept of farm to table, and definitely heightens the experience. They advertise it well too - open kitchen, reminder scripture on the walls... Coat hangers and hooks are also a brilliant idea. Eat at the bar or at the table - great ambience.  The food? Amazing. I demolished my huge $14 Hangover burger (appropriate as I had that hangover the night before), $6 malteser milkshake (lacking the malt taste and texture of the balls but that's hard to do), and shared the atomic fries and pulled pork Mac and cheese with company. Mac and cheese was the best I've ever had - fresh, creamy, just the right strength of cheese, crusted on top, soft pulled pork. Fries are thin and crispy and go so well with the sauce and toppings. I wanted more but boy was I full. Love also that the water comes in an old fashioned organic milk bottle - they're the new and improved hipster mason jar."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery using Foodora. Found it very overpriced for the amount and quality of food you get (not including the delivery fee). We paid $6.25 for 7 onion rings, and they were very bland. I had to put my own seasonings on them to make them worth eating. As well, the fried chicken strips (bites?) we ordered tasted burnt. The $12-$13 burgers were tiny, and the unexceptional taste did not make up for it. Only the big cookie was really good. Won't order from here again."}
{"text":"10/10 pour ce burger-bar hors du commun?! Lorsqu'on voyage avec une végétarienne et une vegan, les choix de restaurants pouvant satisfaire tout le monde sont très rares?! Et chez Burger Royal on a trouvé tout ce dont nous avions rêvé?! Un Burger vegan, avec fromage vegan pour une, un burger végétarien avec plein de fromage pour la seconde et un énorme burger avec bacon pour moi?!  L'endroit est sympa, dans un quartier animé et design.  Surtout goûtez les frites à la patate douce et si vous avez vraiment faim les onions rings?!  Le dernier bon plan de ce restaurant, chaque burger existe en 3 tailles: petit, moyen et grand?! (De quoi satisfaire, les petits estomacs comme les grands?!"}
{"text":"Came here with a coupon, so am factoring that in a bit.  My companion and I both ordered the Big Boss burger with some modifications. The burger itself was very good, although very saucy.  The fries were tasty.    When we were ordering they seemed to be out of quite a few things - one of their drinks, no special milkshake, yam fries.    There was, however, one major problem. We ordered a poutine as one of our sides and it came with some kind of shredded orangish cheese that may have been a cheddar - in any case the combination with the gravy that was on the fries was completely unappetizing.  Now, if we were in BC or Alberta this might be somewhat understandable, but this is Montreal. It was delivered with no explanation, and as we paid our bill, we enquired about this choice and we were informed that they were also out of cheese curds and had chosen to make this substitution rather than let us know.   I get that it's February and restaurant business is slow at this time of year, but this is a restaurant that specializes in burgers and their accompaniments. I'm shocked that they could run out of cheese curds. Combined with the other things that they were out of, I worry that they would make the same choice to replace their signature hormone-free, antibiotic-free, free-range meat with whatever they could get if they happened to 'run out'."}
{"text":"Excellent burger bien juteux et goûtant le buf pas les épices. J'y retournerai sans faute  Très vaste choix de garnitures, on peut vraiment avoir notre burger à notre goût."}
{"text":"The best burger joint in montreal hands down. I have gone here a few times and must say that every element from the farm to table ingredients to the great owner and staff make this a winner. Try everything on the menu you will not be disappointed, my personal favorite is the big boss burger but with all their great choices i am sure you'll find yours Ps. Try a hotdog there off the hook."}
{"text":"Great burgers. My favorite burger place in Montreal. Substituting the bun with the lettuce wrap still turns out great.  The hot dogs and fries -sweet or regular- were average.  Service is friendly and the decor and seating are nice."}
{"text":"Impressed by Burger Royal. Tons of options to choose from but most importantly the burger party itself is tasty (and there's a lettuce wrap option!!!). Lots of the city's build a burger spots forget that the burger itself should be delicious (I'm looking at you M:BRGR). Not the case here where meat is well seasoned. Minus one star for not being able to get the burger cooked to your style, would be nice to get a medium-rare burger."}
{"text":"Ridiculous! Placed an order for delivery and I get a call back almost an hour later saying they're too busy to make my food so they just won't. Another time, went to try the burgers, they're good, but the service is horrible. Just a tip: You won't get to keep your customers if you treat them like crap."}
{"text":"Great Burgers. Endless Possibilities.  As far as gourmet or artisanal burgers go, Burger Royal is a solid bet. The menu features so many creations that it's often hard to choose, but there is also the option to build your own burger, allowing you to skip the decision-making and get straight to what you want/crave.  There are also a slew of fun sides, including a variety of poutine, chilli cheese fries, and mac n' cheese choices.  Certainly worth a visit if you're on the Plateau and craving red meat or any hearty comfort food."}
{"text":"After going to this place 5 times now, this review is looooong over-due.  Simply put, this is finest and most consistent burger in Montreal. The beef and toppings are absolutely delicious, especially the mac 'n cheese. Same goes for their pickles and cole slaw.  Safe to say that we are addicted to the burger meat here. If the french fires matched the burger then Burger Royal would be perfect, but unfortunately they don't ... at least the onion rings are in the same league as the burger."}
{"text":"I waited for 20+ minutes when the place was empty.  The waitress did not deliver a single dish to the right person (we were 3 people!).  The fries came when we were halfway through the burgers and the sweet potato fries were dry and some were old...  Pitiful service."}
{"text":"Just ate at this place. Was greeted by the owner and staff who recommended I try the meatball burger. I did not hesitate as the sound of ricotta and parmesan meatballs on a burger sounded delicious. It was a surprise to see it wasn't a traditional burger; the bread was more towards a hotdog roll but of far superior quality - possibly home made with a lighter, crunchier texture - something that made me curious to try out the rest of the menu. No lettuce, tomato, or onion needed as this was delicious on its own (also recommended by the owner) I met the other owner, Sammy who gave me a little extra of meatballs on the side on the house, which was much appreciated.  He was a really nice guy and he is very excited about the new business and the food.  I'll definitely be back to try out more of the menu, such as chilli fries and their other burger varieties."}
{"text":"Great menu choices and helpful staff. Try their desert menu, the biscuit is fantastic! Will return next time I'm in Montreal."}
{"text":"Good burgers. Everything else on the menu was not good. The Salad portion was too small and didn't taste that good. The fries were dry. The poutine cheese was not even melted and the sauce was cold."}
{"text":"La meilleure place de burgers en ville! Des saveurs que vous n'aurez jamais vu ailleurs! Le burger teriyaki est délicieux et que dire de la banane dessert... omg!"}
{"text":"What makes a good burger is the patty, which they claimed is cooked to perfection. Either the waitress lied to us or what perfection means to them is \"shoe sole like\" texture. Don't call yourself \"royal\" if your burger can't even beat a B list diner's."}
{"text":"I ordered fried pickles and the big boss slider, fried pickles hurt my tongue a little bit, but the burger was really good, I finished it in 5mins, and the slider was big enough for me."}
{"text":"Interesting combination of burgers available. Loved that you can get the different combinations with either a beef, chicken or vegetarian party, so everyone has the full menu to choose from. However, extremely disappointed in the service. Me and my boyfriend went on a Friday night and it took two hours to get a couple of burgers and fries. My order arrived 15 minutes before his, and the fries were not fresh. I would go again for the burger, but maybe at a less busy time."}
{"text":"I dragged my boyfriend here because I wanted a burger. I looked on Yelp and it says 4*. Honestly. I would give this place 2,5 max.  The bun is too dry so the patty. And the 1/6lbs comes with a TINY bun. So everything gets out of there and you end up eating everything separately.  And I'm not talking about the mayo. They put SO MUCH mayo on a tiny bun that you don't even taste the meat anymore. Well the meat was not that good so not a big deal. But I don't like the taste of too much mayo either.   Anyways. Go if you are starving. But be aware that it's overrated.  Not worth it."}
{"text":"I'm a burger fanatic, and let me tell you, this is a great burger. I had the mushroom melt and my wife had the hangover burger which consisted of egg, bacon, caramelized onions and spicy mayo which were served on a brioche bun. We shared a platter of onion rings which were yummy as well. Looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"The burgers are quite good. Service is very friendly. Unfortunately, the menus handed out are in tatters, falling apart, and haven't been sanitized in months. Menus should always be covered in plastic to remove germs, but are rarely wiped clean in most restaurants. Wash your hands after handling menus. Will go back there, but I'll check first if the soiled menus have been replaced. They should also have larger buns for the big burgers. Real tug-of-war to keep everything together."}
{"text":"Even tho they don't serve alcohol.. Which is a huge bummer.. i still have to give 5 stars  Probably one of the best burgers I've ever had. I got the big boss. SO good  The carmalized onions and the mushrooms really add something special. And my husband got the 9oz mac attack.. MAC AND CHEESE! ON THE BURGER?! what else could you want in life??!   I would eat a burger from this place every day of my life if I could... =)   It's a win."}
{"text":"we were visiting from New York and saw this welcoming place, that took us in from a cold Montreal spring day.. charming young man runs the place, the nicest staff, and GREAT burgers.... each hand made or order, and the FRIES are to die for... not to mention the amazing Mac & Cheese. Wish we had one in Soho!!! Few places these days serve well priced food without pretense. This is informal, fun and with organic ingredients!!"}
{"text":"Definitely beat our expectations! One of us had the veggie burger patty and the other had the chicken.  The veggie: Honestly the best veggie burger we have ever had- made on site- very flavourful, but falls apart a bit (however, this really wasnt a big deal for me!)  The chicken: The Chicken was juicy and well seasoned! You could choose from fried or grilled- i took the grilled.  The toppings on  both were really well thought out , unique combos, and really nice quality. The buns were awesome and soft !   We also got a side of Onion rings which were ALSO the best we've ever had (thick battered and well cooked)  Other side was the Mac and Cheese (we got it with caramelized onions), really creamy , delicious and unique hints of fennel! Delicious.   Two \"Bests\" in one meal= 5 stars  the price was a bit on the high side, but for what you are getting, its very worth it.  We got a daily deal for the place , so it was a good deal, but we would go back for a regular priced meal for SURE."}
{"text":"USA resident (PA) and this was probably the best burger I've ever had. Fresh ingredients. Amazing bun. I must visit place for Tarantino fans."}
{"text":"Most amazing juicy and flavourful patties I've ever had. The buns needed to be slightly more toasted. Good vibes from the staff. All around great experience... Those patties,  I will dream of them."}
{"text":"J'ai testé : le burger végétalien chez Burger Royal!  Oui vous avez bien lu végétalien, dans une des antres de la décadence cochonne sur le boulevard St Laurent, il est possible de manger végétalien. Et du bon végétalien qui plus est! Leur boulette végétale faite maison est un délice. La composition est décrite sur la carte ce qui est appréciable, je ne me souviens plus de tous les ingrédients mais elle est en grande partie composée de légumes. Contrairement à de simples pâtés de tofu comme à certains endroits, c'est très appréciable. Les saveurs sont au rendez-vous! Il y a différents ingrédients vegan pour composer son propre burger : sauces et fromages notamment! J'ai testé avec du guacamole et du fromage de noix crémeux fait-maison (même texture que du fromage à la crème), et ce dernier avait un gout très sympa! Les pains sont faits maisons et très bons.  Par contre, plusieurs cafouillages dans le service ont pénalisé notre soirée... Cela a mis du temps à se régler qui plus est. Cela reste quand même une très bonne adresse mais c'est déjà la deuxième fois qu'on est face à des erreurs ici. J'espère seulement que ça sera la dernière fois."}
{"text":"Had a 3 oz burger and it was good. however pricing is a bit high for the offerings. Also the restaurant kind of lacked in clean ambiance. it is also good that they cater to diets and allergies."}
{"text":"We got our order to go and completely happy!  Huge menu, great food including any burger can be made vegan. Vegan burger is delicious and I'm a meat eater!  Will go back to try more items."}
{"text":"After tam-tam, had stopped by and had a Le Gros Boss, with onion rings and Stewart's root beer   FREAKING AMAZING....  That and the waitress was very informative about what to do on a Sunday night here. Will be back next visit."}
{"text":"Went to this place because of the great reviews I saw here and I'm glad I listened. A bit on the pricey side but one of the best burgers I've ever had. It's a must for burger fans. Had the royal burger, cooked to perfection and super juicy."}
{"text":"A cool burger joint in the midst of night life- St. Laurent street. This looks like a typical East coast joint with hand painted walls and tight seating space. The attitudes of the waitress matched up even more with  \"I don't care to make eye contact with you, the consumer, because I am too busy\" attitude. No eye contact= no dessert for us because it takes 15 mins to prepare a cookie pizza dish topped with ice cream (For REALZ!). I wish there could've been a choice of having a cold beer- but this place has no liquor license.    I am jumping the ship here. The menu was very cool- a variety of burgers with unique names even after movie titles. You can purchase them in a mini or large format (1 vs 2 patties you choose). I ordered 2 kinds of burgers the mini-versions of the Godfather and the Mac and Cheese (the least favorite of mine of the two- the pasta was way to undercooked). There was no combo option available- all sides were available with a separate charge including fried pickles, slaw, fries, poutine etc. The price is hefty for mediocre food and service.  Stick to 2$ chow mein if you are clubbing in the area and get hungry late. Your appetite and wallet will both be happy!"}
{"text":"Burguers ok. Rien de très exceptionnel. Pas trop cher mais le menu contenait plus qu'ils offrent in réalité. C'est bien pour les ados qui aiment les boissons gazeuses (il n'y a pas de jus de fruit). Le personnel est sympathique. 03 étoiles sont assez mais I'm not coming back."}
{"text":"So after looking at various burger places' reviews (and locations as I was on foot), I felt good about trying Burger Royal. I was sorrily disappointed.   First they lost my order, which wasn't discovered until I scowled at people arriving 10 minutes after me getting their food. I was not offered any compensation for this, they just said they would put it at the front when they took it again. If you feed me well, I can actually get past this kind of thing, but they failed there as well. The milkshake was tasty, and the fries ok although too much toppings (better ratio would be more fries or a smaller amount of toppings) on the Atomic fries. The burger was bland. The bun was at best ok, and the toppings meh (the caramelized onions were cold among other issues). Only reason not one star is that the shake was good and fries had potential."}
{"text":"Really juicy burgers. Probably the best i have ever had. The macaroni cheese is real delcious."}
{"text":"Our friends took us here during a recent weekend trip in Montreal. Probably one of the best burgers I've ever had. Amazing taste and cooked to perfection. The fries and salad were good too, but you really go here for the burgers. They have a huge menu of different types, although I had the classic burger with a few basic toppings and wasn't disappointed. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I visited Burger Royal tonight while on an engagement trip from Ontario. We came because I read that they had gluten-free options, and since I have Celiac, I was down to get a good burger. The staff was bilingual and very friendly. I was delighted to see the \"mushroom kingdom\" burger, we had a good laugh. Unfortunately, they didnt have any more gluten-free hamburger buns in stock. I opted for some sweet potato fries after being told there's no cross-contamination between fryers. My fiancé grabbed a bacon poutine. Again, in a bit of bad luck, they were out of sweet potato fries. They felt bad enough to comp an order of regular french fries for me, which was very sweet! My partner reported the bacon poutine being awesome, citing the delicious cheese curds. We had a great time, very cozy place. If you have Celiac or are interested in this gluten-free options, it might be a good idea to call ahead and ask if they have the buns. 5 stars! Thanks, guys!"}
{"text":"Points for effort. Little more.  I get what they're trying to do here, it's obvious. Stylish burgers in a contemporary retro setting.  Plenty of exotic toppings and a menu that looks fabulous - on paper. The reality is little more than a grease bomb that will melt your intestinal lining and a roll of paper towel.   These burgers are so greasy, America wants to invade.  With all the crap they jam onto these dishes, it's a mystery of science how the thing I had tasted like hot garbage. Absolutely bland. There were three of us, we all tried something different and each one looked, smelled and tasted the same.  Not impressed. At all.   5 Guys is a better choice, by far."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing. Hands down.   Came here post-marathon, and while I could've eaten a whole cow this place served all its food amazingly.   Glass bottle cokes while not refillable give a certain allure. Fries dripped in cheese and caramelized onions were crisp and the main meal of a medium 6oz burger topped with maple bacon and Mac and cheese is enough to make anyone drool  For dessert a biscuit à la mode (cookie and ice cream) made from scratch hit the spot."}
{"text":"Location: On the main - street parking is available [metered] and the closest subway is likely Sherbrooke. You'll have to walk from there.   The place: Decent size, but not huge. A little on the dimly lit side, and nothing fancy. It's a burger place - don't go in there expecting high-end decor!   The goods: So first, let me preface my comment by saying that I'm not a meat eater. The last time I ate a burger was like, 30 years ago - I'm not even kidding. Therefore, I may not be an expert on the red meat but I can tell you that I thoroughly enjoyed my Tarantino burger. It was so goddamn good that I'm planning on going back next weekend and ordering the full-sized version (I got the slider). This, from a mostly vegetarian gal. Just sayin'. My friend had the veggie burger and loved it, and the side of onion rings that we shared was great. The rings were nice and crispy. On my end, I would prefer a little more seasoning, and found  them to be a bit oily. In terms of the burgers, you can get the slider version or the full version, and you can pick your toppings from the wide variety of options on their menu. The Tarantino had cheese on it and they had no issue replacing that with caramelized onions.   Service: Good.  Price point: I don't remember how much my slider cost me so I guess I wasn't too traumatized by the price! Just go check them out!"}
{"text":"Visiting Montréal and this was the first place my friends and I stopped at to eat. You HAVE to come here! We got poutine and pickles to share. For our meals, we got a Royal burger, Mac Attack burger (picture included), and traditional Mac and cheese (which is baked on the top, and creamy inside). EVERYONE was satisfied! I'd recommend the Mac Attack to any and everyone and we will definitely be back here before we leave!"}
{"text":"I had the Gros Boss burger, small, to stave a Burger-pang... Definitely filling enough if you aren't starving.  Great spot for that casual-need meat - only a burger will do - lots of choice - but better be good - kinda burger!  The meat was really juicy and the bun was light. So many choices and really chill atmosphere, great friendly waitress too. Old style pop bottles were fun too!   Definitely hit up this joint when you're in the mood for a great meat patty.   Wish they served beer..."}
{"text":"I was so happy to have gone here. The staff was extremely friendly, the place was really clean, and the food was immaculate. I could not think of a better place for food if I tried. Also, GET THE REESE MILKSHAKE. It's the absolute best item on their menu and I would go back just for one of those! Although I'd probably end up getting some more of those delicious fries and another amazing burger! I wish I could give you more then 5 stars"}
{"text":"Excellent burger a prix doux ! Superieur a 5 guys qui est une référence burger pour moi."}
{"text":"Pretty outstanding burger joint that stands by the quality of its chuck and will serve it to you medium-rare. This is an impressive feat and does require a bit of trust in the venue, but we had no issues and were rewarded for the risk with an extremely juicy and flavourful patty. Service was english-friendly and prompt.   These guys have every possible topping under the sun with a few pre-configured options. I had The Big O with a 6oz patty and could barely move after, as I paired it with poutine and a glass bottle of Coke. This isn't just a novelty burger shop; these things are delicious. Check it out."}
{"text":"Excellent food, terrible service.  My boyfriend and I ordered the mac attack burger, the hangover burger, and an order of poutine. The burgers were AMAZING and we inhaled them in 10 minutes. The poutine was also very good, but we wish the cheese curds were more melted and less squeaky/chewy.  The service, on the other hand, was mediocre-turned-bad. There were only one or two other groups in the restaurant when we entered and we were sat very quickly, but it took about 15 minutes until a waitress came by to take our orders. It then took another 15-20 minutes until the food arrived, which wasn't too long of a wait. But it took about 20 minutes since we finished our food to get our checks, and another 20 minutes for the waitress to come back so we could pay. During this time, a group of about 8 girls entered, ordered, ate, paid, and left. This made my boyfriend and me feel like the larger group was prioritized because the waitress would get a bigger tip from them, and we were left to wait for a very long time.   Overall, the food and atmosphere was excellent, but our waitress was very inattentive, which detracted from the experience as a whole. If I were in the neighborhood again, I would love to give this restaurant another chance, because the food was just too good to pass up. Hopefully this poor service was just a fluke!"}
{"text":"I found this place on one of those \"best burgers of montreal\" articles online. I also checked Yelp for the menu and the general thoughts of the place. Me and my boyfriend walked there and it wasn't too far. It's located on a nice street, once you're done eating you can continue walking and there's other stuff to see.  The location was nice, a bit busy but we got a table right away. I didn't expect to get seated so quick, it was a 8pm on a saturday night. The walls are painted on and there's a cool bar area. I ordered their popular Mac attack. A burger with mac and cheese. Being a lover of Mac and cheese, I couldn't resist. We got the 6oz to share since we wanted to check out somewhere else after.   The burger was delicious, It was one of the best burgers I've ever tasted. The mac and cheese was so much fun to eat, it was unexpected. You'd think putting mac and cheese inside a burger would result in a culinary catastrophe, but it works. It tastes heavenly.  We ordered medium rare, but it would've been better to get well done. I'll know for next time.  If you're ever in the area, you need to check this place out."}
{"text":"Honestly, you can get burgers just as good for less... but here you can count on fresh local ingredients. The owners and staff are friendly! I absolutely love the plateau mural at the entrance. I don't really like their stringy fries, but I suppose that is a matter of preference.  The menu is diverse and features vegan friendly options - finally somewhere I can grab a burger without compromise, together with vegetarian friends, who also don't need to compromise.  On my last visit here the toilet were a mess, which is unfortunate. Also, no alcohol on the menu - if you want a beer, you'll have to venture elsewhere."}
{"text":"It didn't take long for me to guess that the owner of this establishment was a huge Tarantino fan. With burger choices like \"Django\" and \"Pulp Fiction\", it would seem difficult to make a decision. However, the choice was actually very clear.  The Royale with Cheese here differs in 2 ways from what is referenced in the iconic scene from Pulp Fiction. First, it is not a Quarter Pounder (4 ounces). They give you the option of either a 3, 6, or 9 oz. burger. I believe the 6 ounce is more than enough, especially when paired with an order of poutine. Second, it comes with a relish that frankly brings it together. The burger was great, juicy and cooked  as requested (medium) as all burgers should be.I actually recommend customizing your burger here, as they have great toppings you can get creative with."}
{"text":"Went there last week. The staff was friendly though somewhat impatient even though the place was empty. We tried the Hangover burger and the Cheeseburger with some fries. The fries were okay, but then we're from Belgium and we haven't been able to find good fries anywhere in this town since we got here! The burgers were fresh made and really good. You can definitely taste that all ingredients are of really good quality and all together make up a great burger. We found the price a bit high for what it is but then this is Montreal..."}
{"text":"We found this burger place on a blog for montreal eateries. They took reservations which was a good thing since we (a group of 4) went on a Saturday night and the place was very busy.  Unfortunately two of our group wanted a 3 oz burger but they were out. There were other tables beside us who also wanted 3 oz burgers so I guess it's a popular size.  We went with: a create your own burger since they had tons of choices of toppings, 2 Mac attack burgers, and a chicken burger.  The meat was delicious, as was the chicken - both were cooked perfectly. The Mac attack (Mac and cheese) was tasty. The buns were oily and liked by one, neutral by one and disliked by 2.  We also had a side of fries, everyone found them mediocre. The onion rings were heavily battered but good. The meals were delivered very quickly. Unfortunately service the rest of the time was very slow.  Our server never checked in on us once the food was delivered.  There were two waitresses and the place was so full that it was hard to get their attention. The decor was interesting and the atmosphere was ok."}
{"text":"La nourriture était Top. Le concept  est originalement bien fait, par contre toute les tables étais quasiment remplis (samedi apres-midi) et ils étais 2 peut-être trois cuisinier et Une serveuse qui me savais plus ou donner de la tête."}
{"text":"Great selection of burgers. We sat at the bar as it was busy. Nevertheless we were served promptly and the food was good. I would definitely return."}
{"text":"The buns: not toasted enough, too buttery making it sickening to eat a whole burger, burger was not able to support the filling/burger.  had the cali dreaming burger, first bite with the yolk was good, a quarter of the way in, I wasnt able to finish it and I didnt enjoy it. the batter on the onion rings was really bland and the onion came out when I bit it. Sweet potato fries were good. mac and cheese was too thick and could use a little more salt and pepper and maybe some heat or goat cheese to make it cream and not grainy. Vege burger was good.  Expensive for what you get. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Alors la, si vous voulez un bon burger, cherchez pas plus loin! Déjà y'a un choix énorme mais en plus ils sont juste à se rouler par terre! Je m'en suis même fait livrer à la maison un lendemain de fête... gourmande au bout!"}
{"text":"Tonight was my second visit here - and both times I was meant to go somewhere else!! (The first time, I was headed to Icehouse but there was a lineup, and the second time, I reserved at a restaurant that was somehow closed!)   Anyway I love this place. They have farm-to-table food including a long list of burgers, fries, poutines, mac n cheese and desserts.   Tonight, I ordered the classic 6oz burger and I shared a classic poutine and the fried chicken Mac n cheese. I would literally go back for that Mac n cheese mmm Of course, I took half of it home so yay for a deliciously decadent lunch tomorrow!! It's very rich (they use bechamel sauce) so my sis actually doesn't like their Mac n cheese (don't ask lol)   Their poutine was pretty good but my sis found the cheese curds to be too large. Also, my burger got cold pretty quick. With 2 sides, we should've ordered the 3oz burgers instead but our eyes were hungrier than our stomachs...  Way to go, Burger Royal, for being better than our original plans! This is how you do comfort foods in the plateau!"}
{"text":"One of the best burgers and Poutine I have had. The place is old and run down but has a special charm. Amazing variety of burgers. Definitely check it out when in Montreal."}
{"text":"The food is very tasty. Burger is soft and tasty! Take the 6oz cause the 3 is too small. The frites is very good sweet and regular  The Mac n cheese is good as well   I took Casino Royal and it's tasty and not very saucy"}
{"text":"BurgerGASM! I literally just drank down my burger, it was that juicy! In fact, I had a burger bath.  They grind their own hamburger from locally sourced beef, carefully selected to support small Quebec farms. They make their own gravy on-site and fries don't even know what hit them. They have got this burger thing seriously figured out and I will never, ever be satisfied with another burger again. And, dear God, preserve me from those chocolate chip cookies. Tabersnack!!   Quick service, friendly vibes all around and who even cares with juicy, juicy, juicy patties like that? Mmmm, these burgers will bring you to your knees. You think the Big Boss burger is named just for you, right, but then you realize after one bite that it is the boss of you!"}
{"text":"Incredible selection of delicious burgers, and great fries -- the California Dreamin' was amazing for both beef and chicken burgers. Maybe avoid plain sweet potato fries, which were just good, but the Atomic fries were delicious."}
{"text":"Wait time for everything is way too long. Place is physically way too small. Chairs are way too uncomfortable. Some tables have menus and ustensiles missing, other tables have too much of them. Quality of service is poor. Every square inch you look at has at least 3 people waiting in it, mainly including 2 of them being Foodora drivers. At the end of the day what's left ? What's left is the food is amazing ! What's left is 1 star."}
{"text":"Amazing burgers and Amazing Cookie Dessert!!  Without a doubt this place has one of the best burgers I have ever tasted!  Owner/Chief only uses the best products! Goes the extra mile to make take food good and healthy!"}
{"text":"Their milkshakes are perfectly made! I also really enjoyed their burgers and the fact that they had gluten free options.   I've had their fries only once as the next time I went there they told me that they fried other things in their fryers so it's not 100% gluten free.   I'm not sure if this is a truly gf safe venue but aside from that the food is comfort food and satisfying.   The atmosphere is very divey, needs a woman's touch but then again most of the clientele are men."}
{"text":"Average burgers. Definitely had better. The buns are way too buttered up. The fries are somewhat dry. We also had the chili cheese fries, they were okay. Onion rings were overly crispy. Finally ended with the cookies and cream milkshake, which was standard."}
{"text":"We stumbled into this clean looking burger joint to discover a few things that I would definitely give Bonus Points for: hormone and antibiotic free beef and chicken - so not only is it grain-fed and free range, but you can actually taste the difference in the meat!   We ordered Le Burger Week special with fried chicken, and deep-fried pickle and it was super juicy chicken as well as crispy! The pickle was delicious too! Also on the table was the Hangover Burger and the Royal Smoked Meat Burger and from the way those two ravaged the burgers, I would have to say that the whole meal was a hit.   We also ordered two side fries, the Atomic (sriracha, spicy mayo, jalapenos) and the Mexican (chili, cheese, jalapenos). Both were super tasty, good heat and best of all, the skinny french fries! My friend also ordered an cookies and cream captain crunch milkshake, that he gloriously took down in seconds! Next time I come I am definitely trying the mac and cheese selection too!"}
{"text":"Small restaurant on St Lawrence boulevard. At first you dont expect much, the decor is very basic, open kitchen concept. The menu is very simple, burgers (2sizes) hotdog,  poutine and fries. Were it get interesting is the the toppings,  they offer a good variety. They even have a burger with lettuce instead of the bun,  but i dont suggest,  if youre eating  a burger have the bun and Royal burger bun are exquisite. I was hapily surprised of the taste of the burgers, the meat is gresh as well as all the ingredients. Now i understant why there is often a lineup at dinner time. A must try for burger lovers."}
{"text":"you definitely don't want to bring a first date here if you're not ready for them to see you sloppy and licking fingers but these are some of the best burgers over ever had in my life. A lot of variety and a lot of vegan options."}
{"text":"Testé ce soir pour la Mac&Cheese Week.  Le M&C spécial de la semaine à la bolognaise n'avait que des qualités : assaisonnement relevé et aromatique avec le petit plus du basilic frais, les pâtes bien cuites et une sauce au fromage crémeuse, gratinée sur le dessus comme il faut.  Le plus 1 : Le lieu est très agréable avec notamment une belle décoration et peu bruyant (même si la salle était remplie). Le plus 2 : les réservations sont possibles même pour une table deux personnes (en semaine en tout cas).  Le choix de burger donne envie. On reviendra certainement pour les tester eux aussi!"}
{"text":"STOP WHATEVER YOU'RE DOING AND EAT THESE BURGERS!  My girlfriend and I are both burger lovers (I live in NY so I'm spoiled with the good stuff constantly) but we are also big fans on Montreal food. So, when we heard there was a homegrown montreal burger joint serving Poutine Burgers and other local specialities, we knew we had to stop by and check out Royal Burger.  Oh my. Oh my. The wonderful tastes.  Before I tell you about the dishes we had, I want to note that the meat here was top notch. Instead of buying ground beef, the owner (a very friendly young Canadian fellow) buys steaks and grinds them up himself. The result; steak texture with burger appeal. I had the Poutine Burger and it definitely blew my mind. I got some extra gravy on the side and I sat and eat in a near comatose state of delight. My girlfriend got the Mac and Cheese Burger which was equally delicious.  The atmosphere is casual and you can see the place is still \"coming together\" (it doesn't have a liquor license yet) but that sort of gives it the \"it's real\" charm. A real place, run by real people, serving REALLY good food.  Go now before it gets crowded."}
{"text":"Fantastic burgers! They are a little pricy, but then again what isn't in Montreal. They have quality burgers and quality ingredients and is definitely worth checking out if you are nearby"}
{"text":"This place is really great. The vegan patty is mushrooms, garlic, almonds, tofu - totally complex and delicious. The fries are crispy and light. Totally one of the best chill affordable places these days on the Main. Basically everything you eat here is homemade, and the owner and his wife care so much about the food they serve and the way they contribute to their community. The art on the walls is awesome, a local gifted street artist telling a visual story about the neighbourhood and where the products used to make this great local food is coming from."}
{"text":"Hip looking spot in the middle of St Laurent Street. Decor very much updated, menu ingredients that jump off the page. It's the kind of place that your burger doesn't come with fries. My biggest selling point was that the beef is local (mountain raised, grass fed beef from Nordest farm in Mont Laurier). You also have a choice of burger size including slider, burger and larger patty. Also had a vegan option.  I had the Big Boss, it was good. The burger buns aren't even toasted so expect your over-juicy patty to result in the whole thing falling apart after the 3rd bite. The poutine size was a joke for the price. A small boat of a poutine with mediocre sauce and unmelted cheese. Multiple mac&cheeses at the table were simultaneously undercooked and lacking in the cheese.  The waitress though. Not qualified. Lack of interest in her job, inability to manage the table volume and basic common sense was questionable.  Dessert menu looked good so I might try to come back for that.  TUESDAY TO FRIDAY LUNCH SPECIAL - get a free side of fries + soup/salad when you buy a 6/9 oz burger!"}
{"text":"It was amazing, priced accordingly and the 3 oz burgers were a perfect addition to our lunch ! The Mac and cheese is a must try and is perfect as leftovers too! I tried the casino royal burger with BBQ sauce instead of mustard and it was one of the best little burgers I've had in a long time !"}
{"text":"Voila un restaurant à burger qui mérite le détour... ne vous attendez pas à une décoration de vous ni un service de malade (malheureusement) mais pour ce qui est des burgers vous pouvez y aller les yeux fermés. En effet ici les produits sont de qualité, les mélanges sont parfaits et la quantité est pas mal.  Pour ma part j'ai pris un burger \" gueule de bois \" avec des frites de patate douce le tout pour un prix de 19$ avant tax. Bon si vous n'aimez pas une chose dans un burger il est possible de faire des remplacements comme prendre du pain sans gluten. Vous pouvez aussi choisir quel type de viande vous voulez dedans (steak, poulet, vegé...). Ca laisse pas mal de possibilités et tout le monde y trouve son compte. Franchement j'ai trouvé mon burger parfait... d'ailleurs je n'ai pas réussi a faire la photo avant d'avoir mangé 50% du burger... Pour ceux qui le souhaitent il y a aussi de la livraison et de ce que J'ai pu voir leur poutines semblent aussi très bonnes."}
{"text":"Best burger I've had in Montreal so far. They have some pretty funky burger option. What I especially like is that they took a page out of my favorite burger place of all time (IN N OUT) by giving you the option to replace your bun with two massive pieces of lettuce. A little pricey (10-15/burger, fries are extra) but your paying for quality, and quality it is. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. My personal fave is \"The Big Boss\""}
{"text":"I would give 3 1/2 if possible. This was an enjoyable experience but nothing special. The service was great (giving we went on a wednesday afternoon), the waitress was very knowledgeable about her menu and very nice, the meal arrived fairly quickly. Our glasses were kept full and she checked on us regurlarly. Overall, the service was excellent.  The rest, no so much. We had fried pickles (which I am particularly fond of) and they were good, only problem; the price. 1.50$ per slice... Same problem with burger. The prices on the menu are for the burgers only, no sides. It felt a bit excessive in my opinion. As for the taste, well, nothing special. Seriously, it was just, normal, which kind of sucks when you pay 14$ just for a Burger."}
{"text":"I went there last week and it was the greatest burger I ate in my whole life.  Yes it was more expensive than going to a cheaper place but you pay for the quality and the experience.  The only thing I didn't like was the price of the onion rings for 6 bucks.  I would go back with out a doubt"}
{"text":"We had the Pulp Fiction burger that puts guacamole, jalapeños, and Monterrey Jack on a normal burger, and it was pretty good. I had the Mac and Cheese, and while it was rich, it wasn't very flavorful. The fries were crispy but they were those really skinny, short ones.  Service was friendly and the food came out fast. It's got a very casual atmosphere, and even has seats at the Bar next to the open kitchen. For this, I'd give 3.5 if I could.   I might come back to try maybe a chicken burger or some other sides and dessert, but for the price I was a little disappointed because it's nothing special."}
{"text":"Burger Royal, I had to come back! First time it was an Yelp event and I was ultimately attracted by the use of local ingredients, free range QC cattle, and the Pulp Fiction references in the menu. Second time on our 30,000 steps day, after we climbed and walked everywhere on Mont Royal, and even descended through some rocks right into the Tam Tam party, well going to Burger Royal for solid late lunch was the most logical thing to do. I got my Pulp Fiction burger fix and it was great, but the Fleur de Lis poutine, oh, waw, was overwhelmimg. Imagine poutine with bacon, mushrooms, caramelized onions overflowing from the bowl and covered generously with very thick gravy. Nice, eh!? I have to mention that I also tried the mac and cheese during that famous Yelp event and yes, it was good. So on my next 30,000 steps day, when I can justify the Burger Royal treat, I'll be back for more and more!"}
{"text":"So satisfied after getting the mushroom royal burger with the sweet potato fries and the mac&cheese! The bacon jam was AWESOME, if I had that in a jar at home I'd put it on everything :D"}
{"text":"Great burgers and chicken sandwiches. I had the spicy Chiquita while my friend had the Django. Both sandwiches were really good. Hefty amount of burger for the 6oz. Gluten free bun was amazing! Getting 4 stars because smoked meat poutine was just meh. Overall go for a burger!"}
{"text":"Almost everything about the burger makes sense except the flavor: there was none. Almost no sauce, the patty itself unseasoned, and the onion ring inside the burger was also bland. The burger was dry. Very strange because when looking at it- because it looked delicious!  The choice of bread is nice, all the other accompaniments were nice. The fries were cooked nice. But unfortunately the main attraction was really bland."}
{"text":"Great place for a quick, creative burger. They are cooked exactly to order and the options are quite fun to pick through! The poutine options are fun as well! If you are in the mood for a no frills restaurant and not fast food--this is it!"}
{"text":"Mac attack $10 - deeeelicious!!!! First time having mac n cheese on my burger and I'm glad I did. Pair that up with the coleslaw and it was divine.   Pulp fiction $12 - messy but really good. My friend almost couldn't finish it. But she did.   Traditional poutine $6 a bit too salty and it was lukewarm... Could've been better.  Creamy coleslaw $3 refreshing!   Had a Groupon $15 for $30 worth of food. Well worth it! Without it you'll be paying a hefty price. Glad we got the chance to try it out! I'd still come back without a voucher, it was pretty good.  Make sure you have reservations at night, it gets really busy and there's a wait list. Not a big place either."}
{"text":"Ever since they hosted a Yelp event last year, I've been craving to come back to Burger Royal. We had an event downtown and decided to stop by for a quick visit for a yummy burger and that decadent dessert. It was around 6 PM on a Saturday and the place was about a quarter full. We were seated right away and then we ended up waiting a little more than 10 minutes to place our order.   There's this thing that tends to happen at restos that I hate. They're ready to take our order within 2 minutes after we sit down but if you're NOT READY IN THAT EXACT TIME they then proceed to disappear to Callisto, one of Jupiter's 67 moons, never to return.   While we waited, another 3 tables were seated (for a total of 10 patrons). Our waitress looked busy at first, so we proceeded to flag her down to place our order. She took our order and instead of going back to the kitchen to place the order to the cooks who didn't exactly seem busy (no orders at the time)... she then proceeded to take the orders from ALL 4 tables.   To me, this is a huge \"faux pas\". Please take the first order and send it to the kitchen, at worst, take another order but that's it. So guess what happened? The kitchen were suddenly SUPER busy and they processed a dozen orders and we won the GET SERVED LAST prize.   THANKS.  From the time I sat down to the time our burgers came, a little over 35 minutes passed by. Our burgers came first then another 10 minutes passed for the side fries. Our burgers were done. Gone. The Magic trick was completed. No one will find them anymore. Current status : Digesting. I'd appreciate having my entire meal at the same time.  I'm sorry, if a burger/fries takes 45 minutes to be served at 6 PM Saturday... something somewhere went wrong and we really didn't appreciate how this went. Because of this, our time constraint impeded us from ordering and enjoying our dessert. We were told prep time was about 15 minutes and we weren't going to risk that with what we saw so far. So we left without enjoying the dessert we craved.  If we wouldn't have experience these shenanigans I would have given Burger Royal a 4 solid stars but I'm knocking that sucker down to 2 stars.  Look folks, the food is pretty good. I enjoyed my \"Inglorious\" burger. I'm a big fan of the Tarantino themed menu and the interior vibe. Onion rings were good and I'm hoping for a bigger portion (better value) the next time I'll go. Fries are OK, I do recommend maybe a seasoning option for those of us who want that extra kick. I'm sure in some Tarantino movie there's a moment where a food menu seasoning may have appeared on screen. Do iiiiiiiit.  Vegan friendly, local ingredients, price-tag is decent and free range cattle. This is winner. Menu is great and options on it are good. All the things needed to make this place be on my hit list to re-visit for years.... but I'm sorry, I'm not going to wait 45 minutes for a combo meal and I don't like how the orders were taken on my visit."}
{"text":"In a quick and dirty, or should I say \"royal synopsis\" (in descending order);  5 stars for service, quality of the poutine cheese (see below)  4 stars for burger topping choices, presentation, quality of most ingredients  3 stars or less for value, taste of coleslaw (see below)  This all averages to about 3.5, but I'll put 4 for the whole/concept, and I recall the chicken burger last time was excellent, plus memorable poutine!  Special mention: to the server who had the whole dining room and counter to herself, and was still timely, thoughtful and polite. The quality and size of the cheese curds - also tasty mushrooms on the poutine were a highlight.  Other notes: slippery almost tasteless coleslaw, and so so vegan patty, not a good combo with guacamole, lettuce and the bland yellow cheese served with. As per value, it's a little steep on the burger side of the menu especially and with the three sizes, in my opinion just offer one, or at most two sizes and average it out...as really $10+ for a 3oz vegan burger just because of a few toppings, ya know...  Just realized this is their 100th review. Do I win a prize? Perhaps, the burger of my choice. ;-)"}
{"text":"Ordered take-out from Burger Royal on the weekend so we could have dinner and movie night at home. Between the two of us, we shared:   1. Tarantino burger on a real bun with fried chicken -- The only downside with ordering take-out was that the bun was a little soggy and fried chicken was a bit soft by the time we brought it home. I wouldn't consider that a criticism about the restaurant's quality, just something to keep in mind if you are thinking of ordering this combination to go. 2. Big-O burger on a lettuce bun with beef patty -- Pleasantly surprised that the iceberg lettuce was layered on both sides of the burger to actually form a bun-like shape. I was definitely expecting a single leaf of lettuce on both sides that would have been semi-cooked by the time we got home. Between the two onion rings, bacon and cheese on the burger, I think the lettuce bun was actually a sensible option to keep it a little lighter.  3. Caramelized onions mac and cheese -- UNREAL. The macaroni is perfectly al dente (not sure how they managed to keep it that way). The caramelized onions brought a wonderful sweetness to the cream sauce as well as real cheese on top.  4. Deep fried pickles -- The breadcrumb, chicken tender-esque batter on the deep fried pickles kept surprisingly well in the take-out process. The batter definitely has a bit of a smoky, spicy kick to it so it was perfectly paired with the garlic-chive mayo.  5. Sweet potato fries with garlic-chive mayo and chipotle mayo -- Pretty standard as far as sweet potato fries go but again, the garlic-chive mayo took them to a whole new level.   Overall, would definitely recommend Burger Royal as a your slightly gluttonous take-out option. Just be weary of the types of combinations you are choosing and how the take-out process may affect your food. Otherwise, we didn't feel that the atmosphere was anything special when we went to pick up our food so eating at home was much more comfortable!"}
{"text":"Great food, awesome options including great veggie/vegan choices! Everything tastes (and is) very fresh, local, homemade, etc. Great place!!! Sweet potato fries and vegan burger rocked!!!"}
{"text":"Not the best burgers in Montreal, but certainly not the worst, and you've got to give them credit for their topping combos, which are pretty choice.   That said, it's $12-$15 for a burger, and that doesn't include fries. And then you shell out for fries and they taste like day olds (you know you've eaten day olds and you know that they're palatable at best). However, their onion rings are worth their weight in gold - big as your face and breaded to perfection, they stole the show.   So yeah.., you'll probably enjoy the food, but it's nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"This used to be my favourite place to grab really good takeout burgers from for the last two years. I'm not sure whether management changed or what but there's been a severe decline in service and quality accompanied by an increase in price. Mac and cheese is smaller but more expensive and dry, portions of fries have been halved and increased in price, wrong burgers have been received (wrong sizes more importantly), can't reach them by phone half the time, and the selection has taken a hard downsize. After my most recent experiences, I will certainly be finding a new regular spot."}
{"text":"Sometimes there is nothing better than a good burger and fries.  When the craving for that hits look no further than Burger Royale.  The restaurant is located on the Main and uses local ingredients, which always scores big points with me.  They have done a great job with the interior which is covered with funky murals which give it a fun vibe.  The restaurant is a little small and it does get crowded so try and call ahead and see if they take reservations.   We were a group of 6 and it took about 15 minutes to be seated but it was also Sunday which is quieter than say Saturday.  I imagine on a day like Saturday the  line-up would be long.  Now while they do have other items on the menu like hot dogs and grilled cheese you should definitely have a hamburger if it is your first time.  You can either build your own or choose from one of their creations.  I got the Mr. Pink, which is named after the Reservoir Dogs character.  In fact many of the burgers are inspired by Quentin Tarantino films.  Anyways to get back on topic the Mr. Pink, which had jalapenos, cheese, special sauce and caramelized onions was delicious.  The patty was thick and juicy.  The jalapenos added a little zing without overpowering everything and I really enjoyed the special sauce.    Burgers don't come with sides included so we ordered a couple to share so we could try more of  the menu.  The mac and cheese was rich and creamy.  I could have just had that and I would have been happy. The fries on the other hand were disappointing when compared to the rest of the meal.  I found them to be kind of dry and a little uninspiring.  We also got some milkshakes (strawberry and cookies and cream) to share among the group.  The consistency of both was pretty good.  It was adequately thick for a milkshake but not so much that you would be better off using a spoon to eat it.    The prices aren't that bad when you consider the location and quality of the food.  The burger price varies because you can get different size patties.  The 6 oz patty is a pretty reasonable size and if memory serves me the prices for this size varied from about $9 to $11 depending on the burger type.  Sides were also pretty reasonable starting at about $3.  Considering the quality of the food I found this to be fair.  You can be sure that Burger Royale is on my list of spots to hit up when I have a serious hamburger craving.  I think I can safely say that they make one of my favourite hamburgers in Montreal."}
{"text":"Burger Royal est un restaurant qui propose un large choix de burgers et surtout qui permet de les composer comme bon nous semble. En effet, on a le choix entre poulet, boeuf mais aussi burger végétalien.  Les végétalien sont d'ailleurs les bienvenus puisqu'ils ont aussi la possibilité d'avoir un fromage végétalien aux noix (succulent par ailleurs) ainsi que du bacon végétalien.  Différentes tailles de burger sont également proposées, pouvant aller de la petite fringale à la grosse faim. En accompagnement, nous avons aussi le choix entre des frites traditionnelles, des frites de patates douces, des oignons frits, des crudités,...Ainsi que diverses sauces (dont une mayonnaise végétalienne).  Bref, il y en a pour tous les goûts, sans compter un personnel très sympathique et serviable, le tout dans un cadre agréable."}
{"text":"This was the absolute worst service I've received in the time we've been in Montreal. We tried to order delivery to our apartment, a local address and our phone number was refused several times my a very rude clerk. This is ridiculous. I didn't even have to sample the subpar hamburger to have a bad taste in my mouth. Shame on you. If you are visiting Montreal go literally anywhere else."}
{"text":"If the prices weren't as steep, I would probably come here more often. You can pick the size of your burgers (I think there are 3 sizes, the smallest being 3oz) and the smallest one comes at least $10 a pop for just the burger, unless you just want tomato and lettuce as your toppings (then you'd be paying around $8 for the burger).  I've been there twice and tried a couple of their burgers: Le Grand O (which had onion rings in the burger!) and Pulp Fiction (which had guacamole, chipotle mayo and jalapenos, so on the spicy side). Both were fantastic. Their regular fries and sweet potato fries were very good, as well. If you go there with another person and aren't super hungry or aren't huge eaters, just get one portion.    They ask you how you want your burger patty cooked and my husband asked for rare, but it came a little overcooked (though he still liked it). That said, the fact that they even ask shows that their meat is on the fresh side.   A few more observations and then I'm done: Decor: there's a huge and gorgeous mural of a bird's eye view of the neighbourhood. I couldn't help staring at it and had a lot of fun trying to guess the street names. Drinks: they don't serve beer, which to me wasn't an issue, but my husband was a little disappointed.We got a milkshake at the end instead, which was good (not too sweet, not too too rich). Service: friendly and efficient"}
{"text":"First stop today in Montreal.  Nice place that allows gluten free substitutions. Fast and friendly. The standard poutine was delicious as were the burgers."}
{"text":"You're know you're a really bad yogi when the first thing you do after your hot yoga class has ended is cross the street to come over and get a big, manly burger.  That happened to me one day and while most yogis would probably feel guilty for eating meat, I have no such qualms. If you're famished, come here to get your burger fix. I saw other orders flying by, like poutines, hotdogs, fries and onion rings, all of it looked super-fattening and delicious. I had my order of a classic burger with onion rings and was just what I needed. The menu is a couple of pages long so you're bound to figure out the burger you want. They need a location in Verdun."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with family. Burger Royal never disappoints! The lunch special is a great deal--you get fries and a salad/soup with a burger of your choice for the normal price of just a burger. I ordered the Pulp Fiction and was delighted. The salad comes with a delicious house dressing and the fries are perfection. Would definitely recommend, especially for the lunch deal."}
{"text":"Les burgers sont très bon et tu peux choisir 3 tailles de steak différentes, customiser ton burger avec pas mal d'ingrédients, les classiques sont bien là mais des compositions plus originales sont également à la carte.   On prend un cheesecake pour deux afin de conclure mais ce n'était pas trop ça.   Point négatif qui amène aux 3 étoiles, le personnel un peu borderline qui donne l'impression d'être blasé de servir les clients (alors que le restaurant était loin d'être complet)..."}
{"text":"I'm so glad this place exists! They don't just have a vegan burger, no, you choose what kind of protein you want and then you can pick all the fillings you love from a long list of cheeses, veggies, and sauces at different prices. Each burger comes with fries that are also exceedingly good. I didn't even wanna add mustard or ketchup, that's how tasty they were! Afterwards I ordered a black coffee (very nice) and my partner ordered the biscuit a la mode, although the waiter warned us we'd have to wait 15 minutes for it to be baked. But come on, what's better than a cookie fresh from the oven? I know what's better - when it's huge, and topped with vanilla ice cream!! Man was I happy my boyfriend loves deserts and doesn't openly mind sharing. This cookie a la mode was the best thing ever. Go try it NOW. Feedback to the Chefs: It would be even better if the vegan patty was crispy on the outside. Can you make that possible?"}
{"text":"I was here on a Yelp elite event and knew this is a place I need to revisit so I did. After another yelp event near by I brought my Vegan wife and some friends for fun snacks. I already knew the burgers are great and the fact you can make everything veggie or vegan is just outstanding. The servise is good and fast the only three things I didnt like about this place were the state of the toilat, that you cant have a beer with your burger and the fact that the prices are too high. But since I am impressed with the quality of the food and the vegan friendly attitude it is still a solid 4 in my book"}
{"text":"Sitting at the counter waiting for my Tarantino-to-go... We're verging on the twenty-minute mark, so this better be good.  Ambiance is chill and fresh, the murals are great and I like that they highlight that their meat is hormone-free, free range, and ground in-house.  I wish I knew how it tastes.  Lalalalala - oh here it is!  That is f'ing delicious. I'm not sure how they would handle a rush (it's 3pm, so not exactly busy) but if you have the time to wait, it's worth it."}
{"text":"The beef is supposedly grain fed, free-range, w.e.   While some people have trouble digesting non-organically raised beef, I have no problem with industrially farmed beef, so I can't feel a difference after consuming those.   Let's start with the beef patties (medium well). They were juicy, but had no crust and no smokiness, which suggests that the patties have been cooked on a metal plate. In terms of seasoning, it was very light, almost bland, dare I say.   If you're feeling creative and want to build a 9oz burger, the price starts at 12$ and it quickly adds up to 17$ believe me, so save yourself the trouble and get one from the menu, unless you know what you're doing.  Thankfully, the meal was saved by the chili. It was hot, spicy, and flavourful. It costs 6$ and it was the highlight of our meal. Heck even my friend, who absolutely adores to disagree with me, agreed that the burger faded in comparison with the traditional chili.  I guess the main reason why I'm giving this joint a 3/5 is because of the pricing. The average 9oz burger (roughly a half pounder, 9/16 lb to be exact) on the menu cost 17$ with no sides. And worst of all, the burgers weren't even exceptional. I would be back for more chili."}
{"text":"Dope food, the burgers and fries are spot on. Not so dope service, though. Felt rushed. Be chill, it's free."}
{"text":"Burger Royal is nothing to mess with. This place is seriously regal. A true dignity to burger royalty. Simply by looking at these pictures you'll probably have wet dreams, but actually eating one will change your life like LSD. The also have interesting \"entrée\" such as deep-fried pickles. And don't be shy to try their cookie dough baked cookie (15 minutes wait to bake). Burgers have now found there creative resurgence here in Montreal!! Love it!"}
{"text":"All local produce. I'm gluten intolerant so my American cheese burger with pickles and caramelised onion was served in a bed of lettuce. Perfection. Royal sauce was delicious."}
{"text":"Wow, one of the best burgers i have ever had. These guys are so worried about the details that they even have a special coaster for the burger. Bite into the brioche bun, taste that meaty burger and i promise you the meat juices will be dripping onto your table. Delicious! Only reason they don't get a 5 is they don't have a liquor license."}
{"text":"I came with 2 friends on Sunday evening to have some burgers. From the moment we arrived the tone had been set. We waited and looked around aimlessly for one of the waitstaff to seat us but after an awkward 5 minutes of lingering we decided to seat ourselves. After another 15 minutes a waitress came over with a notepad (presumably ready to take our order) before realizing we hadn't received menus yet. By the time we had gotten our menus we were parched and had to remind our waitress to bring us water, as tables who had come in after us received both menus and water nearly instantly upon arrival. After placing our orders (and some of the menu items we'd ordered weren't available or in stock) we waited an hour to receive our food all the while seeing other tables who'd arrived after us receive their meals. Our waitress sheepishly reassured us that our food would be arriving shortly and that there had been an \"issue\" in the kitchen which gave cause for delay. When the food finally did arrive my friends dish came out 10 minutes before my other friend and I were served (they forgot the condiments we ordered) and my friend was served regular fries instead of the sweet potato fries she had ordered. When she brought this to the waitresses attention she then informed us that they had in fact ran out of sweet potato fries and with a take it or leave it shrug motioned towards the fries on the table. The burgers were delicious as advertised  ( BUT : 1 of my friends found a hair in her burger , and given the hour wait to receive that burger never expressed her grievance) however the poor service and lack of initiative on behalf of the waitstaff detracted from the overall experience and cut my appetite and ability to enjoy the food before me. Near the end of our meal a family that had been seated next to us had asked if we'd been waiting a long time as well as they seemed to be having a similar experience to us. Later both our table and the one next to us were offered free side dishes or desserts to compensate for the poor service. We overheard the young man at the table beside us order the warm cookie which is presumed to be homemade as the menu calls for a 15 minute wait time, before ordering the cookie the young man had specified a peanut allergy which the waitress reassured him would not be a problem as the dessert contained no peanuts. Lo and behold when the cookie arrived it was in fact topped with peanuts which the young man quickly recognized and alerted the waitress, in response she claimed that the cookies were actually from a bakery and that she didn't know there were nuts on them... When it came time to pay the waitress hastily gave us our receipts and accepted our payment, no apology, no asking if the service or food was to our liking, barely uttering anything other than \" do you need change?\" I do not think I or my friends will ever be coming back. Shame on you Burger Royal we expected so much better. I was begging my friends to go with me for the last month and after this first impression I highly doubt that we will ever be returning."}
{"text":"I took a short walk over to St-Laurent and Roy to check out Burger Royale. This burger joint promotes itself as a source for natural organic burgers. All of its beef and poultry is from a single Quebec source, grain-fed free range as well as hormone &amp; antibiotic free. Each patty is handmade following an in-house grind. Nice ideas in concept but execution is the key here.  For a drink, I went with one of their milkshake. Something unique that they offer here is the choice of regular milk or milk that has been steeped in cereal overnight. When I was there, the choices were Captain Crunch or Fruit Loops. The notion is that the milk will absorb some of the flavours from the cereal and add something to the milkshake. I decided to try the Captain Crunch milk in a cookie &amp; cream milkshake. Honestly, there wasn't much of impact from the milk. The rich cookie and cream ice cream used pretty much masks any of the Captain Crunch sweetness that I was hoping for. The milkshake itself was quite good but I think I will stick to the regular milk. Props on the creativity though.  The burger promoted for the week was the Faux Boss Burger. A beef patty topped with deep fried Jalapeños, house sauce, spicy mayo, bacon, lettuce, tomato, sautéed mushrooms, caramelized onions and cheddar cheese served with a side of house sauce. This burger is a slight variant of their Boss Burger - they added the Jalapeños and changed the cheese for this one. Overall this was a very good burger. The beef was definitely fresh - nice and juicy without creating a mini-lake in your plate when you bit into it. All of the topping were good and created a nice mix of spiciness and sweetness. The bread was grilled but still had a nice softness to it. I very much enjoyed this burger.  The fries, on the other hand, were a big disappointment. The portion size was nice but the fries themselves were dry and lacked any real flavour. They certainly didn't have the same feeling of freshness that ones gets from the burger. Even the picture I took of them makes them seem....blah. Which is too bad because a good burger place needs great fries to pair with a great burger for things to feel whole. I loved the burger so if you decide to check them out, try a burger but don't bother with the fries.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"I don't tend to love boutique burger joints, mostly because they are over priced and not something I can'd do at home. But this, Burger Royal was really, really great.   I had the Royal with Cheese burger as a lettuce wrap and all the fixings and I have to say, it was one of the best burgers I've had in a very long time. Not sure if it was how hungry I was or what but it was so really, really good. The burger was juicy without being raw, but not over cooked so it was the perfect texture.   My friend and I split the poutine side, which was more than enough poutine for two people to share after having a burger. It was really good, great, fresh tasting and delicious. The way poutine should be.   The service was really great, our server was attentive and friendly, despite how busy it was the service didn't suffer.   There's a great mural on the wall when you come in which provided something to look at while we waited.   All in all if you're craving a burger, in the hood and wanting some good food, this place was delicious."}
{"text":"The burgers and poutine were excellent. I had the big boss which was made to order and perfect. The waitress was very polite. I would love to come Back sometime."}
{"text":"Originally I thought it's a vegan restaurant but I haven't had burgers in a while. The photos look so delicious!! We came in clueless and found the menu to contain beef, chicken, and vegan options for your burger/hot dog. Basically they'll make whatever you want. And they'll make it to perfection.  I haven't had such a juuuuicy fat burger in SO long, and this is one place I DO NOT regret eating!!! Sometimes my body feels gross after a burger, but not here!!! I have happily returned.  My top 3 in this order: Royal Smoked Meat is $16 for 6oz but lots of smoked meat and surprisingly soooo good!! Every bite is nice and hearty.  Spicy Chiquita is as good as it sounds with swiss cheese, jalapeños, maple smoked bacon, and honey mustard.  Pesto burger is very very saucy, very delicious.   You have the option to select how well your meat is cooked. Yay!!! That's a huge bonus.  The poutine was satisfying, not my favourite gravy. It's freshly cut thin fries (I love thin fries), very crispy, lots of cheese curds. Gravy a little plain but all together the poutine was good. My favourite is the Ground Beef poutine.  Cutest decor ever! Open kitchen but with no nasty smell. Uber clean restaurant. There are never enough waiters for such a busy restaurant, but luckily you never need a waiter anyways. They give you a pitcher of water to serve yourselves, forks and knives and 50 napkins are already on your table. You pay at the desk.  Pulp Fiction burger was just meh, a little boring. Jun-San is weird, it doesn't taste so good."}
{"text":"Amazing burgers, different choices which makes it really hard to choose. Once the mind is set, you will not be disappointed. Try the mushroom melt and mac and cheese sides. Simply amazing. Highly recommend if you're in the mood for one of the best burgers and fries in town."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple times with friends.   Food: good. I enjoy that it's good quality meat and you can tell them how done you want it. The medium sized burger is more than enough.  Service: also good. Each time we were here the service was nice and food came quickly. One time we had a reservation mix up and were later given free desert as an act of kindness.   Ambiance: small and kind of cute. Good date spot, also good for groups but you should reserve in that case.  Price: reasonable. Best deals are if you custom order your own burger in my opinion."}
{"text":"Come with an empty stomach -- good sized portions, and hearty food. Burgers come in three sizes. 3oz, 6 and 9. The 6 will satisfy most. The 9 is massive. You can also choose how cooked your burger is (rare to well done). And there are a bunch of burger choices, or you can customize.   By far my favourite was the Mac and cheese. It was otherworldly. I had the hot dog one. It was the perfect choice. Super cheesy, and the pasta was excellently cooked!"}
{"text":"Quel super endroit pour manger des hamburgers à Montréal. Attention on n'est pas dans un fast-food ici mais plutôt très proche de la tentative (souvent réussie) de quelques resto français de \"chic-ifier\" ce mets américain. Ici la viande est bonne, de qualité et bien cuite, le pain bombé et chouchouté, les garnitures viennent par dizaines, soit déjà inclus dans des recettes toutes prêtes, soit au choix, à modifier, à ajouter.  Quant aux frites, c'est le top pour moi, fines et bien croustillantes, elles sont délicieuses. Je recommande de les tremper dans de la mayo ail ciboulette moyennant un petit supplément.  Pour finir l'intérieur et le quartier sont beaux, ce qui ne gâche rien, je reviendrais si je le pouvais !"}
