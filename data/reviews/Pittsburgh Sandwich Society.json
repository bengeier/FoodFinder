{"text":"Amazing! Had their In n Naht burger at the Three Rivers Arts Festival. Took a while but worth the wait."}
{"text":"In-N-Aht burger is the bomb! So so delicious and fries are awesome. I'm so happy with my order! Looking forward to eat more burgers from them next time l."}
{"text":"It seems the only thing to come out of the recent burger craze is everybody charging $14 for a crappy burger. Well NOT here.  The In N Aht burger is by far, hands down, the best flipping burger I have had since this whole thing started. Perfectly juicy, perfectly balanced, 2 thin patties perfectly cooked to perfect perfection. I would be happy to pay 9 bucks for this \"puppy\" again."}
{"text":"This fun thing has been happening where food trucks are visiting my office building lately. I don't have much experience when it comes to food truck cuisine, and so far I'm loving it!  The Pittsburgh Sandwich Society truck stopped today and after much back and forth between picking the veggie burger or the grilled chicken club sandwich, I chose the latter.   There was an excellent, spicy guac topping a juicy piece of grilled chicken and bacon. The real kicker was the potato chips hidden in the bottom of the sandwich for some added crunch.   It was a little pricey for just the sandwich, but such is life."}
{"text":"Tried them out at the Millvale Food Truck Park... we got the chopped cheese!  Tasted good until I found my first blonde hair in the sandwich... I thought whatever we are all human no big deal!  Last bite of the sandwich and hair #2 this time it's brunette, they managed to give me a piece of at last two cooks tonight!  That was the last straw, I took the sandwich back and asked for a refund.  I got my refund but that was it, no apologize or anything.  All the customers waiting for their sandwiches looked concerned, maybe a good place to grab food at the start of the shift but not at closing.  Maybe try some hair nets guys, while they aren't too cool they could help you stay in business!!"}
{"text":"The Pittsburgh Sandwich Society stopped at my office, which is always a great treat! The week they came, there was a veggie burger, chicken club, and an in and aht burger. I had the chicken club, which was decent but I would probably get something different next time. The chicken was pickle brined, but it wasn't overly flavorful. It had bacon and guacamole on it, which is always a good choice. The guac was a little spicy, but it was still good. I'm giving this 3 stars for now, but  I would definitely try this place again - I have heard rave reviews about the in and aht burger, so that would def be my next choice if it's still on the menu."}
{"text":"Loveeeddd the truck and it wasn't just because I was starving! There were 3 choices: burger, chicken club or veggie burger. I got the chicken club no bacon. Amazing is an understatement. It had a nice kick to it and the chicken was so tender. I also ordered the fries which were tasty and very thin. Next time I will try the veggie burger bc the carmelized onions caught my eye."}
{"text":"So... Can we talk about how awesome this truck is? I have a few favorites, Mac n Gold  Brassero Grill, Berlin Street Food. The Pgh Sandwich Society is mind blowing. I have eaten from this truck multiple times and have never been disappointed! From the hot chicken, to the in and aht burger, to tonight's Bahn Mi' woah... delicious! Every bite is more delicious than the next. If you haven't tried them yet, what are you waiting for?"}
{"text":"Wow! We caught this truck outside of the Highland Park Dog Park - not only did they have delicious food for us, but for our pups as well! The veggie burger was one of the best I have ever had, the fries were wonderful, and my pups seemed to thoroughly enjoy their PB and Milkbone treats. We will DEFINITELY be tracking them down again!"}
{"text":"Never have I have had a double burger until PGH Sandwich Society! The in n' aht burger is my first...and will be my only. The burger is perfect. Juicy and flavorful and I am definitely one of those people that accepts the spaces in life where American cheese needs to fill the void. The creaminess of the cheese is perfect for the burger.  I also think I should comment on a cheese-steak that I had a while ago. I do not remember the menu name but it also has a creamy cheese and poblano peppers,which I thought was a much better decision than the usual green peppers. It was one of my favorite cheese-steaks I have ever had.  All around, the sandwiches are amazing!"}
{"text":"Today the truck stopped at our office, which is always a treat!  I had the in-aht-burger combo for $13.  I am one who like plain food, so I skipped everything but the cheese!  I found the burger to be tasty and juicy!  The fries were on the greasy side, though still had great flavor.  I Am looking forward to seeing them again!"}
{"text":"This was worth being a tad late from my lunch. I was worried this grilled chicken sandwich would lack texture because I opted out on the bacon as I don't eat pork. They one upped it with chips! It made me feel like a bit of a kid every time I bit into it. I rejoiced at not having to use the ketchup I put on the side because this sandwich is packed with flavor that makes it well worth the nine dollars they asked for. Did I inhale it pretty quickly at my desk? Yes! The other surprise was for someone who doesn't like avocados they made me a believer today. They have a spicy avocado Mayo and my oh my. I guess if you're gonna put sandwich in the name you gotta be golden at it. The service was pretty great as they moved quickly to have such a line."}
{"text":"Come join the Society!   Really delicious sandwiches.   If you have the opportunity to give it a try, take it!   Reasonably price, too.    The Grilled Chicken Club has a marinated chicken that is tasty full of flavor that is topped with bacon, spicy avocado with some mixed greens, tomato and some potato chips."}
{"text":"Big fan of their Chicken sandwich. But my go to is their cheeseburger. I check their schedule weekly. Definitely one of my favorite food trucks in town."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this food truck for awhile now and finally had the opportunity at Dancing Gnome. You guys...the sandwiches are out of this world delicious. No joke! The anticipation is built up was not a letdown at all. My boyfriend had the Buffalo Chicken sandwich and I had the Patty Melt. The Melt comes on rye which I hate. Thy generously offered to use a brioche roll instead. Wow, wow, wow!!! That thing melted in my mouth from first bite to last. I was so stuffed but I was also close to ordering another one. The food is that good!! Good to the point I was willing to make myself sick to have another one. Don't worry, I refrained.  If you love food trucks, this one is the cream of the crop. Go now and find out where they are and eat a sandwich or heck eat two! Five stars all the way!!!"}
{"text":"The veggie burger blew my taste buds into euphoric particles of bliss. Thanks guys. Great Sandwich."}
