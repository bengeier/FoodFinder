{"text":"Nothing but good service and food. The two guys that run the place are always friendly. My only gripe; provolone should be the default cheese type (or cheese Wiz), you don't put American cheese on a cheesesteak."}
{"text":"You're not gonna find another cheesesteak this good anywhere near Charlotte. I'm from Philly and I haven't had a cheesesteak this good in a while."}
{"text":"A real cheesesteak cooked perfectly on the grill. Very authentic, fresh and hot! Friendly and fast service. Best I've had in a long time. You have to try the funnel fries... wow! This is the place to go when in the area. Thanks"}
{"text":"First, the original cheese steak was okay, not great!  HOWEVER, this is nothing remotely close to a Philly cheese steak (ie: pat's , genos,  or even steves). The hogie roll isn't bad but the meat is not premium. And, they don't even have cheese wiz in a place that claims they're Philly hogies! 

The sizes of the sub are miniscule. The large is what normally is a small and the small is a bambino size..

All in all, this is what you get expecting to have a Philly hogie in North Carolina. Granted the hogie is okay just please don't claim to have Philly hogies, have it in your name and not even remotely deliver on it."}
{"text":"I am addicted to this place. Their sandwiches are the best in Charlotte. And the staff are the most friendly around, it's always a pleasure to talk with them while I enjoy a delicious sandwich."}
{"text":"Great little cheesesteak place. Nice service, cute interior and great food!"}
{"text":"You can smell the authentic philly scent as soon as you walk in!  Great bread toasted perfectly with yummy philly fillings.  The staff really cares about your experience as well.  Great hidden gem off Harris Blvd if you are in the area for errands etc."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a try since I was craving a Philly cheesesteak. I was disappointed from start to finish. The cashier was pushy and kept rushing customers to place orders. He acted annoyed with any questions about the menu items.  The customer in front of me was pissed and she made sure the cashier knew it.  I should of walked back out the door then but I was hungry so I went ahead and ordered. My cheesesteak had hardly any flavor and was just a total let down. I threw half of it in the trash. I'm giving 2 stars cause those funnel cake fries were soooo good! The only reason I would ever go back is for those fries."}
{"text":"The food here is much to do about nothing in my opinion but based on the length of time they've been in this location someone is enjoying the food.  They serve sub par cheesesteaks, however the funnel cake fries are superb......the only reason I ever visit."}
{"text":"It ain't that REAL Philly cheesesteak tho. I went to Philly for the real ness and it was love in my mouth. But this joint... I mean it's okay. First off the dude is from Nicaragua sooooo... What does he know about Philly cheesesteak? 

Well he didn't do a bang up job, but it wasn't bad neither. 

Will I go back? Hmmmm... Maybe. I mean unless I find a more suitable option for steak and cheese."}
{"text":"The cheesesteaks  and customer service is excellent! The owner, Masoud, is an amiable guy. 

The fries are great as well. The lady that cooked my cheesesteaks discussed horror movies me while seasoning my beef to perfection, and blending the cheese into the steak perfectly. One word to describe the cheesesteak would be awesome!!"}
{"text":"Had \"The Works\" Cheesesteak (no pizza sauce) tonight and it was fantastic! Best in the area so far. I will be back."}
{"text":"One of the best cheesesteaks I've had. This is one of your run down mom and pop shops that consistently makes good good. The employees are very friendly and I've never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"Fantastic sandwich! Great flavored beef and sandwich was prepared just like I asked. Fries were hot and crispy. Enjoyable meal. We will definitely return. 

To management - You should reach out to Sports Connection and make arrangements to provide them freshly prepared sandwiches. Their food options over there are limited and pizza delivery gets really old. I'd order sandwiches from you folks in a heartbeat and I'd think plenty of other customers would too."}
{"text":"Best cheesesteak hands down!!!! OMG!! The way that they mix the cheese into every bite is perfect. The staff is GREAT, and the owner remembers us everytime. A must try in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I thought jersey mikes has a pretty good philly cheese steak before I went here, but now ive seen just how wrong I've been. The meat was tender and flavorful, the cheese was gooey with a nice cheese stretch when you bit into the sandwich, the bread was toasted and not soggy, and the fries were absolute perfection. It's hard to get fries that are crispy on the outside and so fluffy on the inside. Plus everything is fairly priced. No more jersey mikes for me!"}
{"text":"This place has the taste down- although the size VS price does leave a bit to be desired. 
     This is the last of the franchise left in the area and my family is so glad we at least have this one. We travel 20 minutes just to get a cheesesteak here- the bakery next door is just a bonus ;)
     The fries are always good- the bread is soft yet crisp enough and the steak to cheese ratio is good - never dry. The owners/ staff are always friendly and accomidating."}
{"text":"Real,authentic,fresh Philly hogies run by a couple of italians,and subs along with bluebell icecream and they will fill you up nicely for a decent price!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Closest version of a Cheesesteak I've found in Charlotte. The bread is good, the chop on the steak was right, and they offer provolone cheese. It's not Delassandro's but it's delicious when this Philly girl gets a craving. 

The fries are good too! Everything's made to order."}
{"text":"So, I just started a new job in the area, and did not have a clue as to what was available for lunch. Found this on Yelp, and saw it was just down the road from my new office. 

HOLY TOLEDO! Was place is great. The sandwich are good, meat flavorful, bread is soft not soggy. The fries are the bomb. 

Service was great. The lady behind the counter was super nice and helpful.  The gentleman that gives you your order was very nice as well. 

And to top it off, the place was immaculately clean. 

Will definitely be going back and telling everyone about it."}
{"text":"Took a walk and found it. Very good. Served quick and quality wonderful. Not quite a philadelphia sandwich but close to it. Fries fresh and crisp.  Killed some time"}
{"text":"I've been a resident of Charlotte for 5 years but I was born and raised in Philadelphia so I am always skeptical of places that claim to have Philly sandwiches. I can't believe I am just recently getting around to trying this place out. My husband and I really like it, we've gone several times and tried the cheesesteak and hoagie. Doesn't taste quite like an authentic Philly steak or hoagie but they come pretty close. When we ordered the hoagie, we were asked if we wanted it hot or cold. Hoagies are not served hot, ever lol. They also used pre-packaged deli meat for the hoagies, not bad but if they used fresh sliced it would really make a difference. The cheesesteaks are missing that greasy goodness you get in Philly but still very good. To some people, me mentioning them asking hot or cold and talking about them using pre-packaged meat might sound petty but I'm a Philly girl. When an establishment says they have Philly steaks and hoagies, I'm going to compare it to the real deal. Again, definitely close to what I'm used to back home so Philly Corner will be a go to."}
{"text":"Had a cheesesteak from here over the weekend and although it could have had a little more meat it was pretty tasty. I am particular about my cheesesteaks and the fact that I loved it made me want to leave my first review ever. Disappointed by the bad reviews."}
{"text":"I thought the diner was cute and clean. The staff was very friendly and asked us more than once if the food was good. I like service like that. The food was good. I can't say the cheese steak tasted like it does in Philadelphia because you're not in Philadelphia. My point is, it's a great place with good food. I will be back!!"}
{"text":"Great Philly cheesesteaks with a lot of topping options. The bread is soft and holds the sandwich well. The way they cook everything on the grill melds all the ingredients together in a yummy way. Seasoned Cajun fries made to order are good too. Fast, friendly and professional service. Best cheesesteak in the University City/Northlake area in my opinion."}
{"text":"Feeling a little adventurous? Get a taste of exotic Philly without leaving town! Contrary to what my brother told me there is no Philadelphia cream cheese in a cheese steak but there is plenty of whizzy-cheese deliciousness. I've never actually had one of these in Pennsylvania but this sandwich embodies all the goodness I've had in locally-sourced \"Philadelphia-style\" Cheesey Steaky sandwiches...
The beefs are well seasoned, moist and flavorful and could be enjoyed without the whole rest of the sandwich plus enough pale cheese to hold a healthy smattering of onions together with the meats in a fresh roll without making a goey mess of it all. Pair this with a substantial pile o' fries and a relaxed yellow soda and life is good. That it's ready when I walk in the door makes life even gooder!! yea service!"}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times.

Very good! Always hot. 

Provolone, mushrooms, jalape√±os... delicious.

Staff has always been friendly. 

Quick service.

Definitely a do again."}
{"text":"After years of falling off I've had a decent steak sandwich from this location. Finally a good one after years of sub par sandwiches this used to be my go to philly place and its on its way back"}
{"text":"Omg I have been looking for a good Philly place for years. I came here and was blown away by how good these cheesesteaks were. The waiters were so nice.  The cheesesteak had just the right amount of flavor, the meat actually had taste to it, not too greasy, and everything was chopped up nice and fine how I like it.  Burned my mouth several times trying to eat and didn't care! The funnel fries are super yummy."}
{"text":"Not bad for a Philly Cheesesteak outside of Philly.  You get a lot of food for what your paying and the food tastes like it's high quality too.  I got a Philly cheesesteak with provolone, green pepper, lettuce, and tomato which is my typical Philly order.  I was a little bit skeptical about it being good because I haven't really had many good ones outside of Philadelphia. I was wrong.  It wasn't the best I've ever had but it was pretty high up there in my ratings.  I would definitely go back!  My husband wasn't a huge fan of it though, but I guess everyone has their opinion.  Of what I have tried so far,  this is my favorite Philly cheesesteak in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Not bad, but ingredients are not the best quality. Lenny's down the road is a much better cheesesteak."}
{"text":"Best cheesesteak I've had in Charlotte area so far. I got peppers, mushrooms, onions and jalape√±os on mine. Was delish!"}
{"text":"I almost ordered the chicken strips but the woman taking my order said \"why come to a philly cheesesteak restaurant and not get a cheesesteak?\" I took her up on her offer and i must say, i was very pleased. From delicious food to great service, i will be back."}
{"text":"Not a very good cheesesteak. Basically Ground beef. Fries are not bad.  Can't see myself going back"}
{"text":"Not a bad choice but if you miss going here while you're in Charlotte...no worries.  The food is served hot but is not too tasty.  They are very nice people. I just wished the food was better..."}
{"text":"Ive been here a couple of times now.  Today I had a Philly cheesesteak with provalone, lettuce, and tomatoesn as well as fries and a soda.  
What I liked was the bread was nice and soft, and the regular size is plenty of sandwich.  The fries were cooked to order and were decently crisp.
At times it seems the place is slow, but it was decently busy when I visited.  There was a little wait, but since the sandwiches are made to order."}
{"text":"This was a pretty good Philly Cheesesteak.

I ordered \"The Works\" with no pizza sauce. 

The fries were OK. From frozen but well seasoned.

The cheesesteak was good. I saw them use good quality fresh beef, onions, peppers, mushrooms and real cheese.

Overall good experience and if I'm ever in the area again, I'll come back."}
{"text":"I am in here just about once a week for the funnel cake fries.  I never tried them previously.  However, on 3/28, I tried one and wanted to eat the whole bag.  The restaurant was out of powered sugar, however, and added regular sugar to the bag and shook it up.  It was pretty good.  I am going to leave them alone going forward though while the kids can have them from time to time.  The restaurant is never crowded and the same guy is in there preparing the food every week, generating some stability and consistency if you want something quick to eat."}
{"text":"This place is just BAD.  Very low quality ingredients all around. Over $9 for a basic sandwich combo too. BAD.  Stay away.  Someone said in a previous review that it is never crowded.  That's because the food is so BAD."}
{"text":"OMG seriously one of the best Philly cheesesteaks I've had period let alone in NC I just wish it was in a better location. It smelt like and tasted just like a cheesesteak in Philly my family is from Philly so I have a high level of my sandwiches"}
{"text":"Love this place ! Just went today and everything was amazing ! The service was amazing the food was made fast and was hit and fresh. They listened to everything I asked for and delivered! I will definitely be back !"}
{"text":"This is not a great cheesesteak but, it's serviceable for a reasonable price and is served quickly at this location of the PC.  The restaurant itself looks to have seen better days but the service is friendly and, as mentioned, the food gets to you fast.  They don't have the fries warming under a light, instead they are dropped about the time your steak and onions hit the grill so you get them hot and crispy with a dusting of seasoned salt.

On the Original cheesesteak you get steak, onions and choice of white american and provolone cheese.  I like the hoagie version which has lettuce, tomato and olive oil.  My only asks would be more seasoning on the meat as it's cooked and some vinegar to go with the olive oil and cut some of the fattiness."}
