{"text":"Ate dinner there tonight.   Food was wonderful!   Service was great.   It is very nicely decorated inside!   The fish and the steak specials were fantastic."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Warren's last Saturday for lunch.  We had the hamburger, $15, the grilled cheese sandwich, $9.  Their version of french fries came with our lunch.  The french fries had chopped garlic, okay, but they left the garlic paper on it which we did not enjoy at all.  They also put rosemary on the fries, good idea, but they did not chop it up.  So we had large sprigs of rosemary to try and eat, not good.  We felt the food was okay, except the fries, but very over priced.  Also, the grilled cheese should have had more cheese on it for the price and less greasy.  We would like to give it another chance, but at their prices we may have to go else where for very good food, not just okay food for big prices.  Who ever is doing their prep work in the kitchen needs another lesson, or two, for a better product presented to their diners."}
{"text":"Party of four for a Saturday night dinner. We all shared/samples all our dishes. Here is the consensus:  Pros: friendly staff, amazing Brussels sprouts, very good salmon scallops,very good bread/butter, good chicken & funnel cake. Decent peppers and oil. We liked the local sourcing.  Cons: below average beef tartar, below average marrow crusted ribeye filets. Horrible (as in worst ever)old-fashioned cocktail (other mixed drinks were average at best). Portion sizes to price ratio is way off... You'll be disappointed if you expect to leave full based off of one app and a main course. We subbed another round of the amazing Brussels sprouts as a side to a dish and received sautéed Brussels sprouts (not the same as the amazing maple glazed ones we received earlier) and were up charged $5.   Summary: won't likely return. If we did, we would order the Brussels, the salmon and the chicken/funnel cake dishes. Our expectations may have been too high based on the other reviews. All things considered, a 2 - 2.5 stars..."}
{"text":"Quality food !!!  Great service. Nice option for Burton. Ambiance is cool.  Try it, price is not zeppes, quality it extremely better"}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch on a very snowy Dec 30th 2017, attracted by the idea of well prepared local food, and we were not disappointed.  We had an excellent meal of squash soup for starters, followed by the organic salmon & veggie paella entrees. Sat by the windows facing the road, warmed by the heater vent running along the floor, with a local beer, beautiful company, and the perfect view of the snow falling outside.  What more could you ask for? How about just-attentive-enough staff who knew exactly when to appear and when to fade away, leaving us to enjoy the moment to ourselves. We topped it off with the Amaretto Cake A La Mode, and walked out with a feeling of content bliss.  Thanks to Craig, Lana, the chefs and all the staff Warrens Spirited Kitchen for providing this jewel of an eatery in Burton Ohio, Namaste!"}
{"text":"Wow.  Completely awesome dinner experience, from the apps and drinks on through to the desert and digestifs.  We haven't had a dining experience like this, anywhere, since the Monterey peninsula. If you enjoy great cuisine in a relaxed setting, and in Burton of all places, get here now.  Update, 30 July:  Nice new additions to the menu, all in keeping with the \"just a little bit different\" theme of their overall menu.  My kids love the gourmet corn dog special and were excited to try the authentic French truffles.  Keep up the good work, and we'll keep coming back!"}
{"text":"My parents and I ate there once but both mom and I got undercooked (gag-worthy, in my opinion) orders. The only things we liked were the funnel cake and the coffee. Pomme frites (French fries) for $10??  Too much money for too little and lousy food. We will not go back. Once was enough."}
{"text":"Visited on a cold January Saturday, so had no trouble getting seated without reservations for lunch. great selection of local and microbrews on the menu, as well as truly unique breakfast and lunch selections. After reading other yelp reviews, we had to try the brussels sprouts appetizer, and weren't disappointed although I liked them better than my husband it. Would definitely return"}
{"text":"Good food - great Sazeracs....pleasant service. A broader menu would be an improvement - but what we have eaten has been very good. The brussel sprouts were excellent, the scallops - nicely done. Overall - very nice experience!"}
{"text":"This is an outstanding restaurant. The food was amazing. We were a group of four and over two meals had several of the appetizers including roasted beets, poutine, and fried brussel sprouts; carrot soup;  main dishes including scallops, strip steak, and risotto; potato dauphinoise; and desserts (chocolate and vanilla pudding, and strawberry/rhubarb 'adult milk shake'.) Everything was excellent - good, fresh ingredients, very skillful preparation, and nice presentation. Our group included a vegetarian who found plenty to order, and who makes a lot of strawberry/rhubarb desserts and was blown away by the perfect balance of the two in the milkshake. The staff, from the person who took our reservation to the servers, were great and the service extremely professional (nobody came with a dish and asked \"who gets the ____\"). We were celebrating anniversaries and will be back for our next one and, we hope, before then."}
{"text":"Used to be amazing. Pretty steep decline in quality. My main fish was inedible due to saltiness. Wings over cooked. Pasta flavorless. When we left, my mom apologized to the group for how terrible the food was, like it was somehow her fault Warren's is no longer serving edible food.  What happened?! This place used to be delicious. Maybe the food quality left with the \"Burton Chicken.\"   None of us will return until that dish is back in the menu, that's for sure. Especially after the collectively terrible food we all had tonight. Someone in charge needs to reevaluate things.   Great service, though."}
{"text":"Great food & superb service. My only complaint is that they are not kid friendly, so my husband & I don't get to visit as much as we would like. I can understand & respect that during dinner service, but it would be nice to be able to bring the whole family for a weekend brunch."}
{"text":"Fantastic new place in Burton.  Everything has a neat little twist to it.  They do a great job of locally sourcing many of their ingredients.  I had the grilled cheese and fries and they were outstanding.  The renovations they have made to the space are also top notch, especially the new outdoor patio.  Highly recommended if you're in the area."}
{"text":"One of our favorite spots!!! Wonderful atmosphere. Great food. You gotta try the Brussel sprouts!!!  They are amazing!!!  Such a lovely, quaint place"}
{"text":"Delightfully creative and unexpected! The chef greets each patron with a fascinating culinary mind trip - a pallet cleanser. They are different each night. Ours was pear bits with lemon purée on honey accompanied by a peanut. The flavors hit every note. What a fun experience! The wait staff are very friendly and incredibly knowledgable about each unique dish and how it is prepared.  Our meal was the marrow crusted ribeye with root vegetables. Incredibly delicious! It melted in mouth like butter. Dessert was a bread pudding with apples, walnuts and a maple glaze. Warren's is THE place to dine in Geauga County. Word is spreading, so make a reservation. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food. The chef does a great job at giving a creative twist on some classics as well as developing signature dishes. Would definitely recommend the Maple Bacon Brussels sprouts as a side. Yummm!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is always delicious and the staff is amazing. They have a lot of  creative food choices on their menu...it's hard to decide. Also, the addition of their patio makes a great summer spot and I like the adult atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Have been here several times because of the cozy atmosphere & wine. In the past month I have been here twice & both times had really disappointing food. Our fish was tough & tasted odd. My sister got sick after eating it. The wings were completely different both times, the cheese fondue lacked any flavor (the bartender tasted & took it off our bill) & even the fries were dry & flavorless. Prior to these 2 visits we have had really good food & I feel bad for not leaving a positive review before but after our visit last night we will not be returning."}
{"text":"What can I say?  Everything was fantastic!  Pork shanks--tender and delicious, pickle backed chicken sandwich, the BOMB!  18 hour roast beef awesome!  Everything was good, even the drinks.  Definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"We were greeted by very friendly, warm and prompt service. The atmosphere was very nice.  I had the French fries with gravy as a starter.  I thought it might be different, but was faced with soggy fries smothered in a bland gravy.  The food was very expensive for what you received.  I had the Delmonico steak, it was very average.  My wife had the Salmon and it was a little raw in the middle. Not sure we will return."}
{"text":"The menu looked very good and we ordered several appetizers requesting that their service be staggered.  All of the appetizers arrived at the same time and we requested that three of them be returned to the kitchen.  When we asked for the remaining items to be served we found that they had not even been reheated.  They looked and tasted awful.  Server said that there was nothing that she could do about it.  It was early evening and there were not busy.  They didn't seem to care."}
{"text":"another awesome meal while celebrating the last day of summer break with our daughter.  Brussel sprouts are a must.  we ate outdoors as the interior was packed.  reservations are probably a good idea.  excellent service and food."}
{"text":"This place is epic. It is a lovely, unexpected surprise on the square in Burton. We had reservations on a Friday night and were immediately seated. Our server was terrific. Our water glasses were never empty, and our food was served in a timely manner. The food was some of the best I've eaten in a restaurant. They source locally, everything from the meats and cheeses to beers! Everything was absolutely delicious and we felt the prices were very good for food of this caliber. We loved it so much that we have reservations for an upcoming Friday night!"}
{"text":"We made reservations for Fathers Day. Loved the atmosphere of the restaurant which also had a very nice patio for dining. The food was FANTASTIC! Highly recommend the Nashville Hot Chicken & Funnel Cake. The chicken melted in my mouth it was so tender. We also had the veggie paella and the cheese fondue - both also outstanding. I would also highly recommend the Maple Brie Polenta - it started a huge celebration for my taste buds. Will be going back here for sure."}
{"text":"On 06/03/2017 I traveled to Burton Village, Ohio for a date night with the wife for a 7p reservation on the patio.  What a great night!  The weather was perfect as was our entree selections from the menu (Burton Chicken/Risotto).  Since they've opened, I've driven past this restaurant and always wanted to stop for dinner.  My wife and I got a night out so we traveled down to Geauga county to try the restaurant out.  Prior to my meal, the Caesar salad was outstanding.  If you love capers they load them up which made it even more enjoyable.  Our waitress, Laura advised me to order the Burton Chicken due to being my first time at the restaurant.  I was blown away by the amazing flavors of the dish.  My wife's Risotto was just as good as my entree.  The service and food were top notch.  I walked away from the restaurant having a great meal and a great night out with my wife.  We are planning our next trip down to make a meal of all the delectable sides for our dinner.  Also, they have a great selection of Scotches and Bourbons."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a delicious meal and warm, efficient service in a lovely setting. The food, which features small, medium, and large plates, is imaginative and includes many locally sourced items. Of particular note is the walnut soup, which has a velvety texture and a hint of miso. The chicken liver pate is a flavorful starter. The clams garnished with sweet potato are succulent, and the toast allowed me to scoop up every bite of the smooth, buttery sauce. My husband's steak was cooked to a perfect medium rare, and his request to substitute the amazing Brussels sprouts was graciously honored. Don't miss the sprouts, which are also offered as a small plate! We did not make room for dessert, but we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Charming, cozy and top-notch. Drinks were good (and they seem to have nightly drink specials), and the four meals we ordered couldn't be faulted... except for that they were maybe $2-4 higher than they should be. Service was attentive and friendly. They have a nice patio, too. Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"I am a local resident of Burton. Who knew we'd have such a wonderful eatery. Scallops and homeland fettuccini and Cuban Pork. Oh my stars. Fantastic. Only downside - no children's menu but since we left our bumpkin at home it was ok. Give it a try."}
{"text":"I've been to my fair share of restaurants. Last night, my husband surprised me with a date night. We decided to head out to Burton which is one of my favorite little towns.   The town was hopping, so we decided to get some dinner.   The first thing that comes to mind when I think about the service and food. Is DAMN!  We walked in and were immediately sat on the patio. Which was clean and cool. Our incredible waitress was there in under 2 minutes to take our orders. We ordered a few drinks and asked for her recommendations for our appetizer.  She said the Mexican corn and fried brussel sprouts. So, we ordered both. Our drinks came out and they were crisp and refreshing. I ordered an old fashion amd my husband ordered a beer. Lets talk about the appetizers. The brussel sprouts were amazing and crispy, the lemon sauce they were in was tangy, yet Smokey. We devoured them. The Mexican corn. OMG! Small bite sizes pieces of corn on the cob. Covered in spices, Mexican cheese and hot sauce. We also divoured them.  The different tastes of the lemon sauce and the Mexican cheese. Were like a firecracker.  Our meals? We asked our server for her opinion. She highly recommended the octopus and a burger. So, we went with those.  The octopus came out and you could legitimately cut it with a fork. The greens, olives, poached egg, maderin oranges and radishes was exactly as what the dish needed.  The flavors just exploded when you mixed them all together. There was a different flavor in every bite.   Now, the burger!! Holy burger Batman! It was incredible. The meat was all of the delicious cuts made into a burger. It was cooked perfectly and my husband and I shared it.  Kind of! There was nothing that needed to be added. It was the perfect melt in your mouth burger.  We decided to order a 3rd entree.  It was a cocoa pasta, with chorizo and an incredible sauce. It was sweet, spicy and full of flavor. We couldn't finish it Because we wanted dessert.  So, we ordered a price of the Coffee cake. It was served warm, with vanilla bean ice cream. Needless to say, we devoured the entire piece.  The staff was incredibly nice and the restaurant was so clean. It was well lit and there was ample parking.  If you're ever in the area of Burton, this is a must go. I would highly recommend it for any occasion."}
{"text":"This restaurant was recommended by a friend, it was really nice restaurant! The waitress was very friendly, knew the menu well and was quite helpful. They have a great wine selection with great prices, unexpected!! I had the salmon, it was cooked medium, chefs temperature; absolutely delicious! I would say is the best restaurant in that area!  Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Stumbled into this place taking the long way home! And we are so pleased we stopped in. Had brunch which consisted of Chorizo Sausage gravy and eggs. My wife had a Cobbler with peanut butter, grape and apple with bacon added. Artfully prepared with polite and attentive service. Great addition to Burton's scene! Unique food but familiar foods tastes in a great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"It started poorly and went downhill.  NOT FAMILY FRIENDLY.  No high chairs and no plans to get any.  Tiny menu with 5-6 items and they were out of two.  Server was chilly. Manager didn't care how disappointed we were.  Never ever again."}
{"text":"Hard to believe that a sweet spot has opened up in Burton!  Fresh food from local vendors expertly prepared.  Full bar with well to high end drinks.  Cannot say enough about this restaurant.  Want a great meal with a ton of atmosphere?  You don't have to go to Beachwood or downtown!  Try Warren's - you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I have now been to Warren's twice and cannot get enough. The first time was my husband and I wanted to try it out since we have been driving past it since we go to Burton Public Library which is right across the street. The first time we went, we were so excited to learn all their beer is from breweries across Ohio. Nothing like Ohio pride (luckily we have a wonderful selection). We had the cheese and meat board that had such a great variety, even though we did not know exactly what we were eating sometimes, it was so delicious. The food we had for dinner was so great as well! My husband had the friend chicken and I have never seen him eat it so fast!  The second time we went I took my parents. Now my dad cannot have dairy just like me and even though they have a ton of dairy on their menu, they are very helpful with making sure nothing dairy-ish lands on our plates. I ordered the salmon this time and I can honestly say this is in the top five salmon I've ever had! It was perfectly cooked with a slight crust on top. They then had it with kale, carrots, and sweet potato that was perfectly prepared that it tasted almost like candy! My dad had the burger and loved it and my mother had the salad with steak on it and couldn't get enough of it! We seriously cannot get enough of this place and when we have a reason to celebrate in the summer, we know exactly where to go for a great patio and a delicious plate with a wonderful selection of Ohio beers!"}
{"text":"I went in August of 2016 and he weather couldn't have been better. The patio outside along the street made for some perfect people watching and ambience. If in season I highly recommend the heirloom tomato salad. Oh my word the cheese and the fresh tomatoes that come with us the best best best I've ever had. Their Brussel sprouts are great as well. And surprisingly their Cuban was divine too. This restaurant is right on the corner and just a quaint unique place to go. Best ambience in burton."}
{"text":"We were passing through the area and wanted to stop by for a bite to eat. We were thrilled that we didn't have to wait to be seated, however we did experience a bit of sticker shock looking at the menu prices and options. My husband is a total foodie, so he immediately knew he wanted to order the Cheese Board assortment. The rest of us ate the fresh bread that the waitress brought out. It was good and I liked that I got to add my own salt and pepper for flavor. As for entrees, I ordered the Angus Bolognese. It was pretty tasty, but there was no way I could eat all of it. The portion mimicked that of a dinner entree. We were traveling so I couldn't take a box for my left overs (so it felt like a hefty price to pay). I wish they had offered a more affordable and smaller lunch portion. My friend ordered the Vegetable Frittata and though she too said it tasted good, she didn't feel it was worth $14. Contrary to my issue, her portion was pretty small ( I assume since it was listed under \"Breakfast\" items). My hubby loved the Cheese Board (happy he didn't have to share it too!) and he ordered the Angus Beef Burger for lunch. He said it was alright, a bit charred and again... not worth $15. As for the staff, we had no complaints. They were very friendly and prompt. I guess the bottom line is that the food is good, atmosphere is cozy...but you'll pay for it. If you're on vacation, have money to spend and nearby, why not give it a try?!"}
{"text":"Have stopped by Warren's many times with family and friends.   Great food, great drinks and great service!"}
{"text":"I have visited on more then one occasion and each time it was fantastic!!  The entire staff is friendly and very helpful they describe each one of their dishes as if they were the one who personally prepared it!  The atmosphere is very warm and inviting and clean.   The food is excellent !! And best of all they get all their product locally!   This is my new favorite place to go!!  A most try!!"}
{"text":"Seriously NOT ! Let's see, where do I start? Should I start with the slow service? Or should I start with the odd and very costly entrees? OK, let me start there, we ordered the scallops that I think were over $23.00. We decided since it was such an expensive lunch menu, that we should split it. I asked the waitress how many scallops you got, and she said 3, I said could we order one more scallop since we were splitting the lunch and she said - there will be an up charge for that (which was $6 for ONE Scallop - REALLY??!!). Our friends decided to SPLIT a hamburger (because it was sooo expensive) and she said there were be an up charge for splitting the hamburger (REALLY ??!!). THEN, on top of it all, the scallops with pasta and mushrooms was TOTALLY TASTELESS AND THE PASTA WAS UNDERCOOKED !!!! (REALLY ???!!). I have made mushrooms with a pasta and the sauce is wonderful and has tons of flavor. I don't know what recipe they use but it was TERRIBLE. I didn't eat any of the pasta. So, I ate two scallops - which turned out to be an expensive lunch !!! (WHAT ??!!) And the bread they served was also tasteless - it was so plain that I couldn't even take the second bite and the waitress made a big deal out of the fact that the bread comes from the downtown market (who cares?....it's tasteless).  I don't give this restaurant much hope. They need to make some major changes...1) how quickly they serve the food 2) change the prices of the food  3) what choices [on the menu] they give (the choices on the website do not match the actual menu) 4) that they charge so much for everything 5) the bread choices 6) the tasteless mushroom and pasta 7) the \"up charges\" , etc etc. etc. etc. etc. All in all - we will NEVER return."}
{"text":"Everything was great.  We took a random ride to Amish Country, but we aren't particularly fond of most of the restaurants out that way.   The menu had a nice variety of dishes including healthy vegan and vegetarian dishes.   Much of the food app read to be locally sourced which is always good and subtle equestrian theme was fun and different."}
{"text":"The staff was nice and the environment is very comfortable, however I did not enjoy the food.  Virtually everything was fried or deep fried and I prefer more healthy cooking options like steaming."}
{"text":"Linda and I were joined by her two fellow college grads for an evening get together. Since we are spread all over NE Ohio, a half-way point was chosen. Congrats, Warren's Spirited Kitchen you were the lucky place. BUT WE WERE the lucky ones! What a find for us!  Briefly reading the past reviews, this sounded like the perfect spot for us. When the gals gather, we seem to be the last ones in the spot since there is tons of catch up to be had. So we dined!    One of the key highlights for us, is Craig Bednarek's (the owner and I think our server during the evening) use of home grown items. Brews from Ohio; food from Geauga County and Ohio; simply Ohio grown. Two words---WELL DONE!  They have a very good beer selection and versed in all tastes from well known local breweries. The cocktail selection is unique and since they use home grown mint, Mojito's were one the drinks picked. They also were able to make THEIR \"Skinny Mule\" fat for me (used regular Ginger Beer not diet) bring it on!  Steve chose one of the local Lake County wineries for his first glass (Steve is our wine aficionado), this being from St. Joseph's in Madison. Good selection he said.  Appetizers: Three picked the  Great Lakes Grower's Arugula Salad and gave it \"THUMBS UP\"! One had the  Seasonal Soup, which I believe was carrot based and that also got a \"THUMBS UP\"! But the appetizer that stole the show was my order of the Mexican Street Corn! An ear of corn cut in quarters length way was then roasted and drizzled with  otija cheese, lime, fresno & cilantro! I could have ordered two more and forget the entree. A truly special dish that I recommend not to miss.  Entrees included 4 orders of the Pat LaFrieda Burger, house made white American & triple cooked fries! Cannot say enough about the tripled cooked fries. The four of us are suckers for fries and these were out of the world! Oh and the burgers-served on warm brioche buns and cooked to eachs desire, were, as one said, \"to die for\"! The  Pork Milanese, with mustard hollandaise, potato puree & sauerkraut was picked, as was the Turkey Au Poivre, with country ham, peppercorn gravy, sage & potato puree. Again the diners raved about their dishes.  Truly a great meal was had by all. Sadly no room for desserts, but that will be a trip in and of itself.  If you are not familiar with the Village of Burton and this special place, I highly recommend you get your Google Map going, and take a trip out east. You will not be disappointed. They have a great patio and on our visit, they had heaters going to give a nice touch to outdoor dining in the fall. The gals wanted to dine inside, and when we left for the night, they all said the weather was made to eat outside and we disappointed not to have done so. But the indoor seating was delightful as well.  Truthfully, 5-Stars is not enough but that is all Yelp allows!!"}
{"text":"This place is really cute. I had never been to Burton before, but this place fits right into the quaint little town. The inside is cozy with tables and a big bar in the main seating area. There is also an enclosed patio full of windows which is where we sat.   To start, they had a good drink menu. They had a variety of beers, many of them made in Ohio. My mom (a non-beer drinker) even found her favorite beer here-Wild Ohio Mango and Hops. For food, we had the Heirloom tomato salad to start and split a cheese burger. The heirloom salad was simple and delicious with fresh ingredients and feta sprinkled on top. The burger was great too, but the fries were my favorite. They were fried 3 times so they had a great crunch, and there was a hint of rosemary which was a nice touch.   If you are in the Burton area, I'd definitely check Warren's out!"}
