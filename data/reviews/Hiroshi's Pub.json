{"text":"Now I'm going to eat my own words.  While my initial visit to Hiroshi's Pub was spot on and impressive, I returned this past Saturday with friends and felt terrible afterward for suggesting it.  I have been raving to everyone I know about Hiroshi's and proved to myself that one visit is not enough when it comes to restaurants.  I know better but thought given the success of Shuhei, I could base my opinion on one visit.  Um, nope!  First disappointment... I had ordered a Dogfish Head Pumpkin Ale on my first visit and loved that they rimmed the glass with cinnamon and raw sugar.  Our friend ordered it based on that.  The glasses came un-rimmed.  Bummer!  Second disappointment... After eating a bite of my boyfriends prime rib on my first visit and instantly wishing it was my dinner I ordered the prime rib on our return.  The boyfriend did as well.  We were told a few minutes later they only had one piece left. It does say in the menu that it's available until it runs out so that's understandable.  What isn't is that I ordered my prime rib medium rare and it was anything but.  It was tough and overdone.  If they couldn't accommodate my medium rare order they should have asked me to choose another item as well.  I was severely disappointed in my meal including the fact that the garlic mashed potatoes came with gravy over them.  Um, that's just wrong and not how they came on our first visit.  Third disappointment... The boyfriend ordered the ribs & brisket and said the ribs were tough.  Ribs should fall off the bone not require you to gnaw on them.  Fourth disappointment... Our friend ordered the mac & cheese with smoked sausage and said the mac & cheese was average and the sausage lacked spice.  I'm honestly torn on whether I will return to Hiroshi's after our experience on Saturday.  I was so happy with my first visit and looked forward to returning but our second visit was a giant bust."}
{"text":"My family and I ate dinner here-and had an awful experience. After forgetting the one drink we ordered, bringing half our order out cold, stale, or just plain tasteless, she forgot a few other plates. When politely reminding her about the items or if she wouldn't mind warming thhe cold food, she would roll her eyes or just not respond and take it away begrudgingly. We went to speak to the manager and explained it was our first time dining- he immediately got defense and started clearing our plates while some of us were still eating. We were shocked at this rude behavior and while they discounted a few items off the receipt, this was a terrible experience. Not to mention we left with and we either had heartburn or stomach aches- not my idea of an enjoyable family dinner."}
{"text":"I would rather give them a 3.5 but looks like it will have to be 4. Because they are better than 3. There is no such thing as a dive bar in Beachwood. That being said, it sucks to have to drive out of the zone if you are so inclined to take your favorite client out for a couple drinks and want to catch the game.  So thank you Hiroshi, for bringing a pub to the Wood. You have lots of beer, lots of wine and are very reasonably priced. A very extensive menu for a Pub concept, with sandwhiches for the \"i wanna watch the game\" and nifty appetizers, plus sushi for the \"i wanna be seen\" people.   My fave client & I went to check it out and were quite happy. I had many screens to watch Boston/NY  fight over the ball. Garnett, thank YOU for sticking it to NY. So even though we were both in work clothes, its still a nice place to drink and have a few whatevers without feeling uncomfortable (as in overdressed). The all male happy hour crowd? well, is that really a problem? does it affect my quality of pub experience?  Because it is bbq/sushi concept, there is a nice ambient aroma of smoke from a wood fire that permeates the room. We tried some stuff from the pub menu. The hummos was great, and the risotto fritters were fabulous. The charred tomato sauce was something i could eat and eat! I told the bartender I wanted more, but she thought i was kidding.   A great bottle of Burgess 2006 Cab for $30. Are you kidding me? Can I live here?? Hiroshi - if you are reading this - ORDER MORE., because we drank your last bottle!!  I will be back soon - and telling all my clients that there IS a place to \"go caz\" in Beachwood. No haters here!"}
{"text":"So long Sumo, hello Hiroshi's Pub.  What a strange concept in this place- BBQ, wings, sushi, burgers- etc... I'm just not sure that it all works or that one restaurant can do all these things well.  Where's the focus?  Without some type of focus, it's spread too thin.  The old saying is a mile wide and an inch deep... that's what the menu felt like.  Lots of choices, not much depth.  I stopped here with a friend for a quick lunch.  We sat at the bar and the bartender didn't show for 5 minutes.  Gave us a chance to peruse the menu for a while.  I chose a burger simply because the thought of two patties on a bun simply was too good to pass up.  I picked up the one with egg and bacon on it with some grilled onions to boot.    When it was delivered, it looked incredible.  I put on the bun top and the egg burst all over the scene.  Awesome.  Then I took a bite and realized that their patties are frozen, not fresh made.  You can taste the binder and the mouth-feel is akin to wet cardboard.  What a letdown.  I put this burger in my bottom 5 burgers in Cleveland, not counting fast-food joints.  Really terrible.  During my perusal of the menu, I checked out the sushi.  The rolls are about $13 which puts them in direct competition with Pacific East.  I watched  a few being made and they looked ok.  Might come back to try the sushi and then update my review.    For the time being, meh, it's just ok."}
{"text":"Blah. The sushi/pub food concept is not working for you Hiroshi.   Why, you ask? Because you pretty much suck at both. I've had better and fresher sushi out of a plastic container from Trader Joes and a better burger and fries from Wendy's. And do I even have to mention the douchey all-male happy hour crowd you seem to attract?  There is only so much Express for Men button downs a girl can take. You won't find me wasting my time, money or calories here again."}
{"text":"Lets start by, turn away !!! Turn away fast ....          For a new restaurant, really? This restaurant will never make it.. My friends told me about it and said they had the worst service in the world  and they did nothing for them.  (should of heard the warning then) . The only good thing they said the variety of food on the menu was great.    So we waited a good month to go so they could get all their corks out.  (I guess they will need much longer).   Sure enough our service was horrible, the waitress disappeared, never brought condiments, and served sushi with no soy sauce.  I went up to management THREE times !! The first was to question were the food was after 45 minutes.  My daughters food came 10 minutes after ordering but the rest us waited for over 45 minutes.  There was two adults and 4 kids.  Five of us ordered the sushi, and one ordered a hot dog.  The sushi came well before the hot dog which by the way was for one of the kids, go figure!!  Ketchup never brought !!  The sushi, well my grocery store serves better sushi.  They did nothing for us !! I even complained to the manager again, still nothing.... 10 minutes later I walked up to the manager, and said \"really, do I have to beg for the check too!! \"  Needless to say we will never be back !!     Good luck Hiroshi Pub...."}
{"text":"Went here Saturday night. Lets see, burgers, sushi, sashimi, barbecue, wings and meatloaf. Did not get the sushi, but the burger was almost as good as sex! Well not that good, but one of the best I ever tasted. It was actually cooked how it was ordered, medium rare. The fries were cooked perfectly also. They said they only fry in canola oil. The fries were hot, crispy and kind of melted in your mouth. The wings were perfectly cooked as well. Get the chipotle sauce! The prices were pretty reasonable. Good beer selection. I saw some sushi come out and it looked very good. This place does a lot of things well!"}
{"text":"My company's holiday party was held here. That's right, I didn't pay for a goddurn thing -- my three beers plus food were entirely paid for in advance. That said, I was here when it was Sumo. And brother, Sumo didn't hold a candle to what I had here: a random-ass mix of great sushi (apparently the same people who own Shuhei own this place) and American bar food, like tasty brisket sliders and golden fries, along with crazy-delicious pot stickers. The service was extremely friendly, seeing that they weren't expecting tips from me and my 20 co-workers. I had a great time here, and I'm planning to be back, even if I'm paying the next time."}
{"text":"We went to Hiroshi's on Saturday night and I really thought it was great - the service was friendly and quick - from the host bringing us beer samples while we waited, to the bartender and our waiter.   We ordered the pulled pork platter and brisket platter - generous portions of food - both tender and topped with sauce that was tangy and sweet. Plenty of sides to pick from. the salad could have been a little bigger but still not complaining as it was way too much food.  I agree this is an odd concept of bar, sushi, bbq - but with limited bbq options on the east side, I really enjoyed this place. Will have to make another trip for sushi."}
{"text":"As much as I wanted to like this place, it just failed to meet any expectation on all accounts.  The burger was OK. I opted for bacon, guacamole, and pepper jack cheese. It came out with wilted lettuce on the bun which was really nasty looking. The waitress was obliging and brought me couple fresh, crisp pieces upon request. The fries are gross, what you'd find at McDonald's - some really tough and others crispy with too much salt and zero flavor. We tried four different rolls of sushi, and then eel, scallop, and yellowtail sushi....everything was too warm and a little fishy tasting   We won't be going back, the quality is just not apparent in anything we ordered."}
{"text":"First off I went to Hiroshi's based on a personal recommendation from a couple at Harry Buffalo in Highland Heights.  I also decided to read all the reviews while sitting at the bar inside Hiroshi's.  I needed a break while checking out all the options on this very diverse menu.  So I went with the wife last Saturday after Thanksgiving for an early dinner.  I decided to dine here instead of PF Changs specifically because 1) It was somewhere new and 2) recommendations.  Upon sitting down I commented how big the place was.  Huge bar, couple group seating areas, and the kitchen kind of separates the bar area from the dining area.  I sort of liked the layout.  We decided to get a variety of options so we can compare to other places nearby.   My wife decided to go with the hummus starter.  The app came with soft pita wedges and a decent size dish of hummus topped with red peppers.  Although we did eat it all, our final verdict was that it was extremely over garlicized (if Palin can make up words, so can I).  Smooth texture was nice but the pita chips were a little too soft for me.  I like to have them crisp on the outside and soft on the inside so you can dip.   Alison then decided to get the California roll and I went with the Cuban.    The roll was good.  The nori was very tame, didn't really taste it at all, which in my sushi lifestyle, that is very good cause to me that is the worst tasting part and can take away the flavors of the actual ingredients if you get an old / gamey piece of nori.  So we both enjoyed the sushi.  Comes with the standard wasabi, ginger, and soy.    My sandwich was really good.  It came with lightly grilled, thick french type bread with pulled pork, flat top grilled ham, pickles, and what looked like swiss or provolone.  The sandwich itself was huge.  It came with a variety of sides not even listed on the menu as options (listed is only potato salad or coleslaw) so I went with the mashed potatoes and white gravy.    I would recommend the sandwich with two changes 1) grill the bread just a little more so there is a light crisp to the touch and 2) double the pickles.  They are really good on the sandwich and kind of get lost.  The mashers and gravy were par, probably try fries next time or their coleslaw.  Might be good to have some slaw on the sandwich.  So with such a long review I would have wanted to go 3.5 stars if the hummus didn't ruin it.  I will go back and try something else.  I didn't get a drink but they did have a decent selection of drafts and bottled beer along with wine and a full bar.  Enjoy."}
{"text":"When I first heard of the concept, I was thinking \"genius!\". Then I went there and was a little disappointed. I guess my expectations of sushi was too high.  The couple times I've went there, it was with co-workers after work. They do have a good $3 draft special on Tuesday which was part of the draw. The main draw is that I wanted sushi and others I work with don't eat it so I thought it was a perfect match for all of us.  The sushi in comparison to other restaurants in the area is a little bit pricey. If you order a sushi combo, you don't get soup or salad like other sushi restaurants. The quality is good but not the best. Some of the sashimi slices you can taste and feel in the texture that the fish had been frozen. For the prices you are paying, you should get better quality of sushi. Though, I didn't try any of the other bar food, I did witness through my co-workers that the quality fell a little short too. A co-worker's burger was so undercooked, I think I heard it say, \"moo\". The staff was great at fixing the problem but first impressions still count.     Overall, if you just want sushi you should go to a sushi restaurant. If you want bar food, you should go to a sports bar & grille. If you want both, you can venture here but don't have high expectations."}
{"text":"Lots of haters on this place because of such a unique menu. The sushi is phenomenal and much like the owners other restaurant Shuhei. The food all around is terrific. Something for everyone on this menu. Give it a try."}
