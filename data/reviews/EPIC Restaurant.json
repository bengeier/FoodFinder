{"text":"This restaurant has a great ambiance no matter what meal you are enjoying or even if you're just having a drink.  I've eaten breakfast here as well and everything was very good and the service was great too."}
{"text":"I came to Epic to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday. It was a wonderful experience! I have heard many wonderful things about this restaurant but because it was out of my price range, I never got the chance to try. When the Groupon came out so close to my boyfriend's birthday, I bought it right away. I have been to a few hotel restaurants and the experience wasn't that great - expensive and decent service, but mediocre food quality. Epic breaks apart from this and delivers on all levels. 

We started with the two soups - Muskoka Mushroom Bisque & Royal York Signature Seafood Chowder. The mushroom soup was very flavorful and a lighter option between the two. The seafood chowder was very creamy with chunks of seafood mixed in. It wasn't overly salty (like a lot of other seafood chowders - it starts out great, but by the end of it, it's just way too salty to finish the whole bowl). 

Then came our appetizers - Pink Pepper corn and Lemon Balm Diver Scallops & Ontario Apple Wood Hot Smoked Salmon. The scallop was cooked to perfection - lightly crusted on the outside and raw on the inside. It was so fresh and went really well with the spinach sauce. The scallops are served on a bed of citrus risotto - again, delicious! The smoked salmon wasn't your traditional smoked salmon. It is cooked and has a different texture - very different than what I expected but wonderful nonetheless. 

Then came our entrees - Morel Crusted Black Cod & Grilled Prime Beef Striploin. The black cod was perfectly flavored and melted in my mouth. I can't say enough good things about this dish - I love black cod and have tried around. Not many restaurants serve black cod - mostly Japanese restaurants with miso, which is great also. This black cod was cooked differently and brought it to a whole new level. Very fresh and delicate! I have never looked forward to eating leftovers but all I could think about the next day was to gobble down the fish that I brought home from Epic (which still tastes very good despite being microwaved a day after). 
The steak surpassed many steakhouses that we've been to, including the ones that charge you $60-70+ for a slab of meat. Cooked medium rare as we asked. Very tender and flavorful.  

I told our server that it was my boyfriend's birthday and I had expected them to write a little message on our desserts. However, they brought out a slice of complimentary cheesecake with a candle prior to us ordering our desserts. The server even sang Happy Birthday with me! It was a wonderful surprise and my boyfriend loved it. 

This is a prime example of how a Groupon should be run. Even though we paid less than a regular customer, there was no compromise on the food quality or the service. Everything was impeccable and I would definitely come back again, with or without a Groupon!"}
{"text":"We just dined here this weekend and it was delicious! My husband could not stop raving about his pork tenderloin in apple cider dressing and I had the delicious lobster risotto. Service was good and the food was wonderful. If I found myself in this area again, I'd seek out this restaurant."}
{"text":"Came with some frends for winterlicious. 
Not impressed with food and portions. Service was very good, but the food was normal for hotel restaurant. (aka worse than standard)

Service 5/5
Value for money 1/5
Overall Satisfaction after meal 2/5"}
{"text":"Scallops were so good, mashed was the best I've ever had. I wanted more mash it was a very small portion. Didn't like the creme brûlée. I was there for over 2 hours, chatting and taking my time, The servers came by way too much."}
{"text":"Went with a Group on. Received fantastic service...the wait staff were very helpful with my girlfriend's nut allergy. Food came out quickly, serving sizes were very generous and it was some of the best food I've had in Toronto."}
{"text":"High Tea experience leaves a lot to be desired!

Those who truly appreciate will be disappointed with the Devon cream. It was more like butter, not sweet or light. I even asked the servers to double check and they verified that their Devon cream was not sweet.

The service was adequate.  One of the servers spilled HOT water onto the lap of someone at our table.  They did not deal with our large group very well and were visibly and inappropriately annoyed with our table when dealing with the bill.

The highlights would have to be the rooftop garden tour. The selection of teas were nice as well. Otherwise, EPIC is a bit too dark and so the ambiance wasn't as good as it could have been.

For what you pay, I'd recommend going elsewhere for a proper high tea experience - Four Seasons or Windsor Arms are far better on all counts!"}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in this city!
The food was excelent. 

I had a clam chowder, which made me think I was eating the sea!! So tasty, delicious!!!
The pasta with seafood was incredibly fresh. 

Chef sent us a complimentary appetizer for taste testing and since it was my birthday, the chef also sent me a nice dessert plate.

Staff is very friendly and polite. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The food here is great. So you might ask what made me give it a single star. 
Well I have now been her on five different occasions and have never once received anything that is even close to decent service. 
While the servers make you feel as though you are not welcome and that serving you is a chore beneath them, it is the hostesses that really let you know that you're a P.O.S. that should probably find a different place to eat. 
If you're staying at the beautiful Royal York Hotel do yourself a favour and eat anywhere else in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"I came here for winterlicious two years ago and still remember this place. Was really good! the service was awesome and even my mom enjoyed the food. She doesn't really enjoy non spicy food. 

We had an  indian waiter who gave us a ton of macaroons before we left. He was super nice. 

I can't remember exactly what we ate, but we enjoyed everything!"}
{"text":"3/5! Amazing service & private room available for parties of 10! However, the food is average and overpriced. There are better seafood options in Toronto!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were staying at the Fairmont and decided to go for breakfast. We expected the food to be pricy but wow.. $5 for a coffee? $5 for a small glass of orange juice. 

We both ordered the crab benedict, WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT!!! My crab cake tasted like someone out an entire lime in it! Eggs were extremely overcooked... The worst part was the \"roasted tomato\" was hard as a rock and still green. How hard is it to find a ripe tomato in August in ontario?? 

When we checked out of the hotel and they asked about our stay, we told them about breakfast. They were very apologetic and refunded our entire meal ($71)! Which I greatly appreciated. 

Bottom line, I will NEVER eat here again, or recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"Upon reading the  reviews on Yelp, I was expecting to check my foodie tastebuds at the door - and tolerate yet another work lunch. If it was up to me, I would not have picked this restaurant.

However, I was pleasantly surprised. The ambiance was cosy and the service was attentive (though my drink arrived the same time as my dessert). The appetizer  was your typical smoked salmon. The main dish was cod with tasteless lentils - but the sauce was good and the cod cooked just right (as opposed to the cod I had at Lucien which was oozing water). The creme de la creme was the Creme Brulee. It was perfect and the best I ever had. It would have been better without the biscotti (what purpose did that serve?). I would totally return just to have tea and dessert."}
{"text":"nice environment, but I wouldn't come here if not staying at the Fairmont.  Overpriced food and drinks, routine service, nothing special."}
{"text":"Nestled into the lobby level at the Royal York Fairmount Hotel, Epic kicks out some heavy flavors in downtown Toronto.
What a breakfast!  Golden brown waffles with just the right amount of crispiness.  Yum.  Fresh blueberries picked just in time.  Tasty bacon so lean and juicy that even vegans are tempted to eat it.  Ok so my table was a bit small for two, the wait was a bit too long, and the prices are a bit too high but did I mention the off-the-hook bacon??"}
{"text":"It is a lovely decor - and the dining room is clean and inviting. 
The cocktails are interesting, but not innovative or artesian . 
Ordered the halibut and chips- which they assured me came from BC and flown in daily - perhaps I should have known to not to order fish on a Monday, somewhere that was in my head.
The halibut came out- and you could smell it- not a good start.  I thought to taste just a bit to see-- and it was rancid.  
I returned it without difficulty.
Instead ordered the Epic Club - which was made with old turkey. The fries were soggy.
Something happened in the kitchen, or perhaps they just have bad standards.
A restaurant should not ever send out fish that smells - that says something about the kitchen staff. 
Turkey that is old meat should not be sent out on something called \"epic\"

The waiter was pleasant, but very slow (we were there at an off hour, at 2:15 pm on a Sunday) 
Disappointing - and if you are at the trains waiting, this might be an ok place for a cocktail, but if you are going to eat - go to a fast food place where the quality is consistent, albeit poor."}
{"text":"So, I will qualify this by saying that the snack I ate at the bar was delicious... but now for the real issue.. I went with my boyfriend late afternoon Dec.5 - we tried first for the library bar, but it was closed.  We sat at the bar and immediately noticed that the counter in front of all the bottles was a disaster! Dirty cups/glasses, old crumpled napkins, bottle toppers strewn all over.  The service end of the bar was a disaster as well, full of dirty glasses piled on the counter.  We were 2 of only about 4 or 5 people so it was NOT busy.  It took several minutes to be acknowledged - we ordered two beers and asked for a menu.  The bartender (Bernardo) said, okay and started on other tasks...(providing service bar as well). After 10 minutes, my boyfriend said, Umm, do you think we could get those beers now?.  The man looked at him blankly and said, yes, okay.  He was quite hard to understand, and didn't seem to really pay attention to what we said to him - it took 3 or 4 tries to get him to comprehend the ONE thing we wanted from the menu.  Being a professional bartender in a busy NY restaurant for the past 20+ years gives my boyfriend some expertise and he was aghast at the poor service and messy bar. We could both tell that the other employees were not enamored of this guy either, shooting him dirty looks behind his back while they maneuvered around him - Now, a truly nasty bit of business.. I watched Bernardo prepare a martini for the service end of the bar (it was for two), and pour the first glass, then the second - they were not even close to even so he dumped some of the fuller one into the other to even it up - okay, not so professional but whatever.  BUT!  I was HORRIFIED when I see the waitress who was waiting for those drinks take a look, decide that they weren't quite even and actually picked up one of the glasses sitting there and dump a splash of melted ice water into the lower glass!!!  To top it off, with no prompting from us, Bernardo hands us the bill - my boyfriend asked me - did you ask for that? I said no, so he said to Bernardo - are you leaving, so you need us to close out?  He just looked and said, No...  Apparently he just thought we should leave.  So, terrible service, messy bar and questionable sanitation practices.

The only saving grace for the place was that after we dined (at another location) we wanted  some after dinner drinks - Library was too full so we looked in, saw there had been a shift change and decided to have a glass of wine and try the Library again after.  It was like a different planet.  New bartender (Agil?) - the bar was spotless, nothing lying around and he was very attentive.  We had a glass of wine and departed for the Library."}
{"text":"My husband and I have eaten at Epic half a dozen times over the last year and every single time we eat there, the food is always delicious and the service is excellent.  Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I think restaurant has potential, but it really needs to be redecorated to looks like it is from this era.  Modernize!!  I orginally had ordered a merlot ($12) from a waiter that was helping our table.  Our head waiver arrived and not even letting me taste my wine insisted I have another glass of wine. The wone he recommended I found out later on the bill, was $21 per glass. I felt that the waiter should have told be the price difference, this was upsetting and I was on the spot when the bill came as I was with friends.

 I had the scallops which were amazing! The spicey sausage on top kicked it up a notch and they were perfectly cooked.  The remainder of the dishes were \"okay\". I had the duck which was over cooked and very bland, worst duck I have had.  The dessert was an apple tart which was burnt on the bottom.

  I found the pricing to be outrageous for what the food was and would not recommed this restaurant. There are far better places to eat withour paying the hefty price tag.  I also don't like the upsell tactic, where as recommendations are always appreciated."}
{"text":"Outstanding Service and food.

They have a secondary menu that has options for people with dietary restrictions, which is good as one person in our party as many things they cannot eat. When she asked the waitor to verify ingredients, he said he'd bring the chef out to talk to her. Sure enough, the chef came out soon after, and she explained her medical restirctions, and he told her most of the things she ordered would be ok for her, and those that weren't, he'd adjust how they were prepared to be sure she could eat them. Fantastic attention. The waiter did say \"we take dietary restrictions very seriously here\" and he was not lying.

We had ordered a bottle of sparkling wine which came to our table slightly flat upon popping the cork and tasting. After indicating so to the waiter, he said no problem, and got us a different one, no questions asked. I know it's standard for a restaurant to pop the cork and have you to sample their wine/sparkling to be sure it's good, and you're supposed to be able to send it back, but for them to replace it without question was great.

The meal was excellent. Appetizers and meals were delicious and prepared just as we ordered. Most of our table ordered fish as a main course, and I had the 10oz steak. Cooked perfectly as I requested. The desert fell slightly, although I ordered the Cherry Tart and was not dissapointed, another member of our party ordered the flourless chocolate cake and found it only ok. Not bad, but just ok.

Overall meal was expensive, $450 for 4 people (plus the above mentioned sparkling wine for appetizer, another bottle for main course, and a couple bottles of sparkling water as well) but you go in expecting that was the kind of restaurant (price wise) you're going to.

I was worried upon initially reading the 3-star average this restaurant had, but they delivered a great evening for us, and I don't hesitate to give them 5 start for what they provided for us. A great tasting meal and great service, and the chef taking time to make sure our member who had special requirements would be taken care of.

Win."}
{"text":"A great up scale restaurant where the service, food and ambience are a perfect marriage and proud representation of what the Fairmount Hotel embodies.

We ordered from a 3 course fixed menu. Nearly immediately after we've ordered, the waiter presented us with fresh bread and oil along with a sample of the chef's latest addition to the menu. It was a lovely start!

The crab cake appetizer were unbelievably good! Real, never frozen crab meat packed into a well seasoned, lightly battered disc the size of half your palm. The dish came with 2.

We had to wait a while for our entree but the waiter kept us well informed. The Cornish hen was tender and moist and the buffalo steak paired perfectly with the purée.

As for dessert, the chocolate cake was very rich so take your time with it. The assortment of creme brûlée was delightful: maple, cappuccino (not the best), and lavender (INSANELY GOOD)! We couldn't eat another bite yet when we asked for the bill, a mini platter of biscottis and biscuits appeared with it! It was a lovely gesture nonetheless. 

Although we came to Epic with a Groupon, the service and cuisine held true to how any regular customer would have been treated. It was a marvelous."}
{"text":"I'm just going to cut and paste what I wrote in an email to the manager. Enough said!

\"I am writing to commend your team at the EPIC Restaurant and Lounge, following a truly wonderful occasion there this evening. Every detail, from start to finish, was impeccably handled. I would like specifically to comment on Mohammed, our primary server and Kavita, the young lady who greeted us and took our coats. They were both exceptionally gracious and Mohammed's powers of observation and attention to detail made our visit very memorable. I know the staff are extensively trained in hospitality, but that is not always reflected on the floor to any impressive degree. We live in Toronto and have dined all over. We've also stayed at four and five-star hotels all over the world, and the quality of service at EPIC was noteworthy, even compared to places like The Landmark in London, England, or the Grand, in Stockholm.

Even good food can leave a bad taste in your mouth in the hands of indifferent, poorly trained or poorly treated staff. The food at the EPIC was excellent and all staff members were attentive, courteous and friendly. We will recommend  EPIC Restaurant to our friends in Toronto and visitors, alike. 
You are definitely doing something right!\""}
{"text":"The restaurant is located within the Fairmont York Hotel. Since we were staying there, we decided to try at least one of the restaurants located there. The restaurant does not have a modern look. However, it is an old school classy environment. Our waiter was very attentive and professional. 

We noticed that restaurant had a breakfast buffet. However, we were getting ready to leave for a tour and didn't want to over eat. Therefore, we decided to order entrees. I ordered the chorizo breakfast wrap. The wrap consisted of scrambled eggs, Ontario gouda, cherry tomato in a whole wheat wrap. The wrap was really good and came with a side order of potatoes. I also ordered a side of bacon. 

The breakfast menu did not offer anything unique. The buffet did offer cereals, fruits, fresh juices, pastries and various hot breakfast items made to order. The breakfast buffet was $34 and in my opinion nothing jumped out at me that made me want to pay that much for breakfast."}
{"text":"Epic fail. I'm not usually this harsh but I'm not sure why these high end Toronto hotels insist on serving the same breakfast they did 20 years ago. Probably a much worse version than they did 20 years ago. We had breakfast aster 10am so we go the \"a la carte\" menu which I think means whatever is left sitting around from the buffet. The menu itself is very limited and not modernized (unlike any fairmont we have visited across Canada ). I got the eggs Benedict with peameal bacon, my husband got a typical eggs with sausage and toast (which never came) and our 4 year old son got a kids version of the same.  It all tasted very poor and like it has been sitting around for a while. It was no better than a meal at Denny's (though I think Denny's would've been better ) for a lot more $$.  My husband also ordered a very poor $6 coffee. We didn't finish our food. We definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"While I was staying at the Fairmont I had a wonderful breakfast of oatmeal and fresh fruit. While the breakfast was yummy and our entire party enjoyed the buffet, the most awesome part was the service. Our server Deolito treated us as an old friend when we sat down and his enthusiasm never wavered! So kind and considerate, we'd go back simply for him!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with a groupon that pretty much gave us 4 course meals for the price of the entrees alone. It was great! I had the beef tenderloin and it was outstanding, the salad and appetizer were nothing special. My husband had a full vegetarian meal- only one choice for each course,  but he was very satisfied, and I regretted not getting the vegetarian soup and app. The service was amazing. It was a sun night and not crowded or loud at all. It might not be worth the price if you don't have a discount, but we did, and so it was."}
{"text":"*Review of Bar Only*

Epic, for a downtown/hotel restaurant, seems dated. Most new hotels like the Shang (Momofuku), Four Seasons (Boulud) have restaurants that can stand on their own. Epic, on the other hand, is hardly noticed as you pass by. 

But, I had a meeting at 6 which wasn't enough time for me to have a full blown dinner, and I was by myself. So, being the prepared one, I thought I would go to a bar near my meeting to have drinks and apps. Epic popped into my mind.

I was there at 5 and no one is there to greet you. So, I walked myself in and went to the bar and a lovely old gentleman welcomed me. From that moment on, I was very happy. Bernardo, the elderly man who was in charge of the bar counter was excellent. I would go to that bar just for him. I splurged and had to glasses of Moet and Bernardo suggested corn fritters which were just right for me.

I can't speak for Epic the restaurant, and I don't think I would try. But the Epic Bar was lovely."}
{"text":"This place was by far the worst for a 5 stars restaurant. We went for our anniversary and it was horrible. The waiter was very polite but the service was S-L-O-W! We kept waving to ask to order or the bill. We ordered two stakes dinner hoping that this would be great, and my steak was undercooked and the second one was over cooked and dry. We asked for medium well for both. It was served full plate of fries(half were burned) and 4 small asparaguses. We payed $100 just for this crappy dinner not including drinks or soup! Never again! Go to Keg, go to Mcdonalds - the quality is better then this place. Waste of time and money. Thanks Fairmount for the awful experience would not recommend!"}
{"text":"Don't get why it's reviewed so low, my boyfriend and I really enjoyed our dinner. We were craving oysters but they didn't have it on their menu. Our waiter was really kind and said we could have them anyways ($3 a piece). They were really good! I guess they're able to get them from the Benihana since it's in the Fairmont as well. The duck breast was really good but the touch of BBQ sauce was a little over the top. Both should never go together, in my opinion. But other than this, the food was amazing. The highlight was the complimentary dessert they gave us- coconut macaroons. Oh my! These macarons were sooooo good (they definitely make it to the top of my favourite desserts in the city!). So moist and the addition of the white chocolate coating.... 

Will definitely want to come back."}
{"text":"Good location as it is close to the spa but food quality and service was below par. Food was cold and not that well seasoned.   Waffles came without syrup.  Had to go to buffet and get it ourselves.  Decor needs a refresh.  Stuck in the eighties. Not recommended."}
{"text":"I dinned here in a group of nine. Epic includes a dinning room, lounge area and a private room. We were in the private room where you are closed in with large glass doors. You get the privacy but still see what's happening in the restaurant. The food and service was good but not sure it's worth the price. Here's what I liked:

- Top notch service. The staff was great. They refilled our drinks and water immediately, were knowledgeable about the menu and ensured everyone had what they needed. 

- The food was good - above average in my opinion. Highlights include the Pear salad, squash soup, halibut, scallops and I tried someones steak which was cooked perfectly rare.  Food presentation was also creative and above average. 

- Good wine list and the waiters very more than willing to help with recommendations.  They have a few beers on tap (same as the Library bar down the hall).

- I liked the lounge area, you can relax with a few drinks before you start your meal.

- The decor is nice and open. The restaurant was busy but you don't feel it since the tables are not jammed together.

- We received a few items on the house from the chef. They gave us a \"Clam Chowder\" shot and a dessert sample plate.

On the downside:

- Prices. I don't mind paying higher prices for good food and service but just didn't feel like I received my money's worth. This is likely due to the incredibly small portions sizes  (even for a higher end restaurant). 

- Desserts were average in my opinion, not as good as the starters or the entree's. 

I'm going with just three stars as good food and service is somewhat offset by pricing / portion sizes."}
{"text":"ABSOLUTELY THE BOMB! 

One of the best restaurants I've been to in the city, as I was there a couple months back for a friend's birthday. Local, organic food, freshness in all the ingredients, and topnotch service.

Had made a reservation, so had valet parking with it, which is definitely a plus. We ended up getting there later than our reserved time, but they were super friendly and accommodating, and seated us without a problem. 

Some of the freshest food I've ever had, and the rack of lamb was amazing! Beautiful and delicious desserts too!

Definitely on the pricey side, but if you're willing to pay for good food, definitely worth the visit!!"}
{"text":"I purchased a wagjag to go to Epic, otherwise it totally would have been out of my price range.  But I have to say for a special occasion I would FOR SURE go back.  This was one of the best restaurant experiences I have ever had.  From the food, to the service, to even the plates, everything was perfect!  

Every item of food was created with such care.  Each taste on the plate fused together to create perfect combinations.  It was amazing, down to them bringing plates of the best macaroons I've ever had in my life, and lavender shortbread like cookies that were to die for!!  

The service was amazing like a well oiled machine.  All the staff worked cohesively to make this an incredible experience.  From getting rid of plates, to checking in and seeing how everything was, to being offered drinks, we never felt burdened and just thoroughly enjoyed our polite yet fun hearted staff.  

The restaurant is a bit frou frou, but in a absolutely stunning way.  The plates were beautiful, the seats were comfortable, the plants on the tables were such a nice added touch.  

I really might be in love with this place, and I highly recommend it to anyone who can afford to spend a bit for a wonderful evening out!"}
{"text":"Definitely not epic.  It's OK.  Not a bad spot if you're meeting some people downtown for a simple breakfast or a coffee, though you're paying way more than you're receiving.  There was a time when staff would greet me on entry by name, but now they've forgotten or don't care - it's almost a chore for them to seat me."}
{"text":"*GROUPON EXPERIENCE*

The Fairmont Royal York isn't usually my type of hotel.  It's historic (a clever work marketers use for dated) and you'll most likely find OLD money (no pun intended as the demographic is usually people 40+) as the usuals.  

I bought a Groupon (4-course dinner for 2 @ $99).  

The food was nothing special and albeit being fine dining, did not excite my palate.  We started with the seafood chowder, more roux than anything else, though definitely more seafood than you'd get usually and less fillers (e.g. potatoes).  It was actually quite tasty despite the disclaimers above.

I had a Farm Fresh Ontario salad of black currants, walnuts, goat's cheese, apples and a honey vinaigrette (the honey is taken from their rooftop apiary which I think is pretty cool).

For appetizers we opt for the maple-braised pork belly served atop a buckwheat blini with apricot coulis and Swiss chard.  The pork belly was quite flavorful (though the balance of salt and sugar was definitely more skewed towards the salty side - too much soy sauce!)  The blini tasted like cardboard.

The best dish of the night is no doubt the Miso Black Cod as the fish is fatty and flakes off the fork.  The dashi broth is poured onto the fish at the table.  The Du Puy lentils were just meh.

I opt for the Surf + Turf of bison striploin and lobster tail.  The bison is cooked to perfection, nice and pink on the inside, but being a leaner cut doesn't have the same wow factor.  The lobster tail was a tad overcooked.

Desserts are certainly eye-catching, but fail when it comes to taste.  My sister opts for the EPIC chocolate cake with chocolate ganache, salted peanut prailine and vanilla ice cream;  chocolate cake is usually rich enough on its own, but douse it with a bit too much sugar and my fork is down in 2 bites.

The apple tarte tatin is a huge disappointment.  This is a dish, that, when done properly, usually takes 15 minutes (minimum) time and is usually something that servers tell you to order ahead of time.  This version consisted only of a bottom puff pastry that was so hard to cut into pieces (seeing as I was only afforded a spoon) and was mostly a dessert of cooked apples.  It may have been salvageable if the apples were hot, hot, hot - but the dessert was below room temperature leaning more towards the colder side.

Service was slow and unenthusiastic.  I don't think I saw our server smile once.  Maybe he's of the type that thinks that Groupon customers don't tip or have bad etiquette but I always tip on the full amount (of retail, not the Groupon).  We also waited extremely long between our soup + salad to our appetizers.  The server finally comes over and tells us he forgot to clock in our order in the kitchen - no smile and totally unapologetic.  

I expected more from a restaurant called EPIC; and on top of that a restaurant housed inside the Fairmont Royal York which isn't exactly a cheap place to stay.

I definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"WOW!

I'm not sure how else to describe my experience at EPIC. I took my wife there for our one year anniversary and it was incredible. We were staying at the Fairmont Royal York (the restaurant is in the hotel) and I had requested reservations for Benihana, however it is closed on Sunday and the staff suggested EPIC. I said it sounded good, not quite sure what I had signed up for. 

We had 7pm reservations and were seated as soon as we showed up. We took our time reviewing the menu, it isn't large but the selection makes you want everything. We also had wine and water menus to review... yes, a water menu. 

We finally decided on salads and mains and placed our orders. This is when the bread basket arrived. It was not your ordinary bread basket, it contained 3 or 4 types of rolls as well as breadsticks, flat bread and other wonders. We had our choice of spreads, the standard butter option or a mascarpone, truffle oil spread. Needless to say we didn't touch the butter. 

Following this we had our salads... my salad was comprised primarily of prosciutto with mandarin slices and blue cheese and my wife had prawns and asparagus with hollandaise ( more of a meal than a salad). They were both amazing.

Next was a surprise amuse-bouche, a perfectly cooked scallop with a spicy tomato chutney. It was perfect in every way. 

Along with the meal we had a nice glass of Pinot Grigio. 

The mains arrived and again we were sent to heaven. I had medium pork tenderloin with chevre mashed potatoes and my wife had a beef tenderloin steak with caramelized onion mashed potatoes. Both came with vegetables and unique sauces and were incredible. 

At this point we were both stuffed, but we knew we weren't walking away without dessert. I had the chai creme brule (reminded me of pumpkin pie in a way) and my wife had a chocolate hazelnut torte with strawberries. Again both were amazing and we accompanied these with an amazing glass of ice wine (our first time having ice wine). 

Finally it was time for the bill, but not without a final surprise. Accompanying the bill were 4 chocolate truffles, which were the perfect touch to an amazing meal. 

This meal has become one of the best meals I've experienced from the atmosphere to the wait staff (we must have had 6 or 7 people come by at different points) to the incredible meal... it was all perfect. The chef at EPIC is an absolute genius and really exists in a league of his own."}
{"text":"Been here a few times. 

I used to come here only for brunch, which was the most worth it in my opinion. At a hefty $40 per person, at least you get the samplings of sushi, breakfast, and so many different types of food. Unfortunately they discontinued it. 

I went again for dinner because I had Fairmont gift certificates. The menu didn't have much selection and things looked potentially small portioned. 

It took us a long time to order. 
After ordering, we got a big butter bread (+1) 
The squash soup looked like it could have fit into a small mug
The steak came with a suggestable shape next to it (see pics)
My scallop pasta was creamy, and filling. 
However, i digress. 

total for 2 people including wine and dessert is $110, which wasn't bad, but would have rather have bigger portions to justify that."}
{"text":"Epic is located inside the historic Fairmont Royal York. Epic serves up innovative meals with fresh regional ingredients. The food is consistently good at this restaurant. The service is attentive and what you would generally expect of a high-end restaurant. 

I had the clam chowder to start. The clam chowder was flavourful. The ingredients were fresh. There were fresh clams in the chowder.

I had the duck for the main entree. It was well prepared - medium rare. It was paired perfectly with fresh vegetables.

For dessert, I had the creme brulee. The creaminess of the custard on the bottom and the crispiness of the burnt top was delightful. 

The price is a bit on the high-end, but the food is consistently good."}
{"text":"So.. I decided to come try this restaurant after my co-worker telling me how great the service was. Stepping into this restaurant, it's good in a sense that you still have this comfy feeling.  I came for lunch and ordered from the Winterlicious menu, the soup of the day was a butternut squash soup. The flavour was not bad, but not hot enough. For the main, I've order the rainbow trout. I did enjoy the crispy skin as usually I don't eat any skin from the fish. My Brussel sprout that came with it were pretty good. My co-worker recommended the white chocolate cheese cake. I thought that was on the heavy side. The two things worth mentioning for the white chocolate cheese cake was the edible chocolate cup that they put the caramel sauce and the nice small chocolate sign. The waiter was very attentive and helpful."}
{"text":"THE WORST THANKSGIVING EXPERIENCE EVER??

Me and my bestie had thanksgiving dinner @ epic restaurant. We were so excited about this place coz it's inside the 5 star Royal York Hotel. For a set dinner priced at $89 - more expensive than any other Thanksgiving set dinner offered in most restaurants in toronto - you would no doubt expect to receive a dining experience more superior than at any other places. However I can bluntly tell you the experience we had tonight was way worse than even eating at a fast food restaurant
After we get seated and provided water, I told the waiter we are ready to order and all of us are starving. he has disappeared for more than 20 mins, during the time we tried to wave to him. But got totally ignored. 
One of my friends ordered a glass of rose wine, she asked twice and finally got it when we having the main course. When the waiter was taking away the dessert plate and cleaning the table, I asked him to bring the bill, by that time we were the only table in our area, 15 mins past, no one brings any bill, so we have to wave to him again and got ignored again. Another 10 mins past, my friend shout to the waiter \"excuse me, bill please\". 
And we finally got our bill. 
The food was ok. 
The service is really horrible, the Worst on the planet !
Will Never Ever go back again and surely will NOT recommend it to any of my friend."}
{"text":"The Bad: For a place called Epic, this meal was very NOT epic.

The Good: The place is called Epic, so cue all the clever puns???

Yeah, this was a disappointment.

Came here for Winterlicious. The appetizer was some funky mix of octopus, olives, and chorizo. Next, I got the steak. It was undercooked, underseasoned, and overly chewy. I can cook up a better steak, and I'm the kind of person who will cook meat like... once every two months? So either I'm a steak genius, or Epic doesn't know how to make decent steak. Either way, I left disappointed.

Anyway, I finished off the meal with the sorbets, which were alright. 

Overall: a very meh experience. I guess EPIC restaurant has a better ring to it than MEH restaurant."}
{"text":"$400+ per night for this hotel. I received awful service. Asked for a gin martini straight up with a twist. Got a drink with tonnes of a ice and gravel. They don't give a shit. Avoid. Makes me want to avoid the fort York in general."}
{"text":"We are here for winterlicious for 17 people. The service is not that professional but friendly. The restaurant is very nice and comfortable. The food is so so good. I recommend this place if you never been here before. But I won't be here anymore unless there food is better."}
{"text":"We tried the Sunday brunch for Mother's Day. The menu included made to order omelettes, eggs Benedict, and any other style of eggs, waffles, French toast, selection of cheeses, breads, smoked salmon, charcuterie, cold seafood oysters on the shell, crab claws, poached shrimp cocktail, sirloin roast, grilled salmon, whitefish and mussels, selection of salads and hot items. Dessert table included chocolate fountain, macaroons, cakes, tarts, best was the coconut macaroons. Everything tasted fresh and delicious. I would say Seafood selection not great crab claws too salty and meat was tough, minimal selection of nigiri sushi, best items in the seafood display was the shrimp cocktail and oysters. Dessert table was disappointing, I expected more selection and quality. Other things were amiss the little jams jars on the table and honey was all sticky obviously opened previously and the table staff did not notice or check. One server holding a stack of plates and cups dropped the whole platter and shreds of China went all over our table floor area and cleanup for that issue took too long.  There is a washroom inside the restaurant which is nice but after awhile waste bins were overflowing and needed attention that was lacking. Table staff otherwise great with replenishing cutlery and coffee and tea. Overall food was as expected for Fairmont hotel but restaurant staff needs a review of their practices to remain competitive. Not sure if I would return again for Sunday Brunch given other hotel options, Ritz Carlton does brunch buffet best."}
{"text":"I went for around 9pm recently and was struck by the stink of frying oil heavy in the air.  But, not wanting to go on a walkabout outside, I ordered the crème brûlée trio.  It looked nice and I tasted all three.  Absolutely the worst textured custards I've ever paid for.  I didn't taste more than once from each flavor because it was so revolting.  I'll not go back."}
{"text":"Went out in a group to have dinner at epic. The place was comfortable but the food wasn't fine dining and pricing was very high for what I received. 
The dessert was terrible, I make creme brulee at home all the time and its so simple (heated heavy cream slowly drizzled into mixture of whisked egg yolks & sugar which then sets in ramikin within a water bath in the oven) 
The dessert I received was so heavy, like a pudding thickened with flour and nothing like a silky rich mouth feel of creme brulee.

The halibut was so average, a little dry..  the dish was rich and one note. No acidity to cut the richness of all the other elements (black lentils, spinach & turnips)

Enjoyed the crab cakes and beet salad was good just very tiny and decorative, however the elements of honey, beet and what tasted like fresh cheese curds worked well."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now, once for my birthday and another for Mother's Day. Both, an amazing experience for weekend brunch.  I've heard of the ritz-Carlton mimosa brunch but since I don't drink, it didn't have the appeal for me.  The Fairmont buffet is just perfect for a special occasion. Highly recommended.

Food: 4/5, great quality food, delicious pastries and many dishes you can order and they will bring it for you: the waffles and eggs Benedict with hollandaise sauce was perfection.  They also have a lot of local jams that accompany the bread well.

Service: 5/5, the second time I was there. They just knew it was me; perhaps because I'm a gold member but before I could say hi, I'm here for..., they responded with my name and told me my table was ready.  The servers and chefs were also amazing.

Ambience: 5/5, awesome high chairs, beth comfortable and a lot of space between tables for a quiet conversation.  And great hotel-calm music in the background.

Price: 3/5, it's definitely pricey at $35-$40 per person but totally worth it."}
{"text":"I've had no expectations, and I got exactly what I've expected - an ok place, with ok food.

The real highlight was the service, as the server seemed to be always there, without us looking for her.

This isn't a place I'd go looking for, but if I'm at the hotel, I will probably repeat."}
{"text":"Seems redundant to say epic service at this place, but it is also the truth. A testament to Fairmont attention to detail. 

Nightly live music, great wine selection and a decent beer selection, although being from Vancouver I'm used to more local craft style beers and more than 6 choices on draft. 

The signature drink list is excellent too. 

If you get to Toronto stop by for a drink and a nibble before heading to a game (which the Leafs/Raptors/Jays/TFC) will probably lose. But at least you will have started the night out on a good note!"}
{"text":"Attended for intimate family wedding in private room. The food was amazing, highly recommend both the corn soup and seafood chowder! Plating is beautiful as well!!
Steak was perfectly cooked, and all accompaniments worked very well with the dishes!"}
{"text":"Elegant dining in one of Toronto's most yet agining, but classy Fairmont Royal York Hotel. Came here for summerlicious 2013 lunch with some old work folks.  Classy, modern, and robust service we were seated and ready to order.  The lay out of this place pretty, and the open concept kitchen is a PLUS!!

Straight to business.


Smoked Fenwood Farms Hen Rillettes; Grilled Garlic Toasts, Cider Gelee: 4/5  yummy crisp bacon, and cider jelly really geled well! great for starters

Yogurt Cardamom Grilled Atlantic Salmon
Roasted Red Pepper, Citrus And Farro, Baby Zucchini, Dill Cucumber, Salsa: 4/5
Perfectly cooked Atlantic salmon, beautiful outer bark, and soft tenderly cooked inside. The yogurt cardomom was an important component which added flavor to the blander salmon steak, as well the dill cucumbers created some freshness to the overall presentation of the dish!

Compressed Berries And Melon (vegetarian) Honey Mascarpone, Lemon Verbena: 4/5
Kind of wished there was more mascarpone lol!!! however you have to really dig deep to the bottom of the fruit cup. Great presentation and full of fruits!

Overall dining experience was pleasant! and the waiters were very helpful!"}
{"text":"* This review is for Epic's Breakfast Buffet *

Accessible through the Underground Path, a friend took me here since he said they have the best breakfast in town.

Upon entering, the hostess will ask for your Last Name and Hotel Room #. 
(Note that you can dine here even though you're not staying at the Royal York Hotel).

We opted for their renowned breakfast buffet which costs $34+tax per person and includes coffee, tea, and juice of your choice.

AMBIANCE:
Interior of the restaurant is dark and dated.  Tables are covered with white tablecloth, too formal for my liking.

SERVICE:
The waiter who served us seems surprised that we were locals and dining in an upscale restaurant like Epic. Can't blame the guy - who spends $34 on breakfast anyways especially for simple workers like us lol. What bothers me most about this staff is his nosiness as he keeps on questioning us where we work and what we do. 

FOOD:
Food selection ranges from fresh fruits (including exotic ones like Longans), cereals, homemade breads and pastries, cheese and cold cuts, and various hot food items including made-to-order Eggs Benedict and Omelettes.  One of the best Eggs Benedict I've ever had - perfect poached eggs with creamy hollandaise sauce.

Although pricey, will come back again especially when there are special occasions."}
{"text":"We had a reservation for Winterlicious lunch on a weekend day. The restaurant called about 2 hours before the reservation to tell me that they don't serve their Winterlicious menu on weekends. To be clear, I didn't get an apology for what was ostensibly their mistake, I was merely informed. I asked if I could call back at the same number to confirm, because I needed to look at the lunch and brunch menus and to discuss with the other member of my party. I was told that I could call back to to the same number, and dial an extension which I was then given, or to ask to be connected to the restaurant. We decided to cancel the reservation. I tried to call back a few times, but the line made a strange tone and disconnected almost immediately every time. The tone was familiar so I checked my call log - I'd had a missed call from the same number earlier in the week, and had the same issue when trying to return the call at that time. I tried calling the restaurant at the number that they have listed on their website - again, no luck. So, apparently they don't have any working phone lines and aren't aware that they don't have any working phone lines. I ended up calling the front desk at the Fairmont. They were able to cancel the reservation for us. Did not eat here so I can't comment on the food, but everything else about them is a shambles."}
{"text":"I'm sure this hotel restaurant was very swanky back in the day but it's a little rough around the edges right now. Maybe  time to redecorate or something? I'm not saying change the vibe. Keep the big padded chairs and the whole lobby lounge feel but just give it a little update. That's all. Nuf said.
The food is ok. Main stream which you need in a busy hotel. We tried ordering the charcuterie board one time but they wouldn't let us because it's only available after three and we were there at 2:30. Aw come on, guys! Really? Is it so hard to take the salami out of the fridge and put a couple of slices on a piece of wood? Why 3:00? I don't get it. We got the privilege of being allowed to order it the next time we were there and it literally was just some cold cuts and pickles on a wooden board with a dollop of mustard smeared artfully across the wood plus a basket of breads of the world. It wasn't bad. I just think you should be able to get it before 3:00. Am I asking too much?
The time we couldn't get the charcuterie board, I got a very nice salad. It was satisfying. I think I actually prefer it to the charcuterie. Maybe that's why they play hard to get with charcuterie. To create a higher demand for a \"meh\" dish. Hmm. Pretty smart. 
Well, that's my Epic review. I hope you liked it."}
{"text":"Bar side's not bad, not great. Overpriced, but it's in the hotel so expected. The fish and chips are not crispy enough (halibut was ok, but fried salmon is just sick). Chicken sandwich is good. Caesar salad is ok. If you're staying at the hotel, order room service instead for better food, same cost."}
{"text":"Ok, I typically wouldn't trust a review that doesn't include a picture but PLEASE trust me when I say that the new lunch menu from Epic is fabulous. I had the short rib and it was so decadent...melt in your mouth delish!

This is a great steak alternative for lunch.

Check it out and let me know what YOU think.

I was there today for a business lunch so I didn't want to wip out my phone and start taking food-selfies but seriously, the plate looked great!

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Upon our arrival in the city of Toronto, my colleague recommended that we partake in the decadent breakfast buffet at Epic Restaurant, located within the classic Fairmont Royal York Hotel.  The large dining room was able to satisfy a substantial number of guests, but managed to remain spacious at the same time.  Each table was comfortable and fit right in amongst the upscale decor.  

The service was fabulous and efficient.  The buffet included custom omelets, baked goods, fresh fruit, hot items like waffles, cold cereals, smoked salmon and more.  Our favorites included a sweet, warm muselix and the ripe fruit platter.  Purchasing the buffet option also included an endless procession of coffee, tea, and juices.

The $27 price tag was certainly reasonable considering the size and breadth of the offerings.  The courteous staff and lovely atmosphere enhanced the experience.  I will say, though, that I was shocked that we were able to stick to my strict limitation of only visiting the buffet table twice with all of that fabulous food!"}
{"text":"This review is not a review for the food.. which is strange since this is a restaurant.   

The only option was to eat in the restaurant, but since I only had 2 hours of sleep I wanted to take my food to go.  They wouldn't let me because they were afraid I'd get sick.  I didn't understand how a restaurant would not let me take out food.   They offered to bring the food up to my room at a charge of $4.00 fee plus tips.  

Is there actually a difference if the food was brought to me rather than if I came in physically to pick it up?  

In the end, I didn't want to pay $8-$10 just so I can have my food shipped up to my room.  I didn't try their food and still think this is bizarre."}
{"text":"I have been to this bar twice: once two years ago and again last night. Boyfriend and I went for dessert and late night drinks on a Saturday. I was surprised and displeased to see that there was no dress code! There were people dressed in anything from hockey jerseys, to casual wear, to business attire. They had a live pianist playing which was nice but it was interrupted by babies crying and small children crawling under our table and chairs. For a place that is meant to be more upscale (and for the inflated prices) I was very upset and turned off back the lack of atmosphere. I felt like I was at a local family restaurant but paying triple the price."}
{"text":"This was my third visit to Epic. One out of the two previous times I came for Summerlicious. So this was my first Winterlicious lunch experience here. Obviously my return was based on a positive experience. The service was good for the most part. 

For starters I had the Royal York Seafood Chowder with Maritime Salmon, Scallops and Shrimp, and Fine Herbs. As soon as it arrived at the table, the aromatics convinced me I was going to like it. I absolutely loved it!!!

Then I had the Asparagus & Sesame Lobster Salad with
Citrus Yellow Beet Emulsion, Baby Blonde Frisee, Toasted Hazelnuts, and Sweet Onion Chili Vinaigrette.  This was such a delight. The salad was perfectly dressed and the vinaigrette itself was really bright and full of flavor. The asparagus was bitter so I avoided it. 

I finished off with a White Chocolate and Caramel Cheese Cake With Rhubarb Chutney.  I loved the cheesecake and couldn't get enough of it. The rhubarb chutney came off a tad bit savory on its own but worked well with the cheesecake. 

This was another great experience at epic. I actually liked what I had during Summerlicious better. Maybe that's because I'm partial towards scallops and braised short ribs. This lunch was obviously on the lighter side and much needed during Winterlicious. Keep up the good work epic."}
{"text":"I think I'd give this place 1/2 star if I could. This was part of a work function so there was a large group. 25-30 people. 

Where to start. There was a pre-set menu to work with so it was very limited. For an appetizer I had what amounted to a Caesar Salad with a fancy name. It was good but WAY too salty. The main was Beef Tenderloin that I asked to be medium well but arrived as rare. I also asked for \"Chicago Style\" but they missed the mark on that as well. I ordered a side of mushrooms with the steak. I don't know what type of mushrooms these were but they were not good & like the rest of the meal WAY to salty & coolish. The big ending was the chocolate mousse which was extremely tasty. 

Couple of places where the missed the mark...service was extremely slow. In fact some of my party that were elderly left without being served. That is TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE. The service was so slow that parts of the party were leaving as I was finishing dessert!! 

There are so many good/great restaurants in that area...do yourself a favour...go somewhere else. If you position yourself as a 4-5 Star restaurant your food & service HAVE to be top notch!!"}
{"text":"Went to Epic Restaurant for lunch today.  Although I work very close to the Royal York, this was my first visit to Epic Restaurant with a friend who also worked in the financial district.  The restaurant's other diners were mainly other suits who also worked in the area.   Contemporary design and nice layout with very comfortable seating.  We were given fresh bread to start and we both ordered entree salads.  I rarely order salads for an entree, but at my friend's endorsement, we both ordered the seared tuna & salmon entree salads.  To finish, we both ordered coffee and were served biscotti and cookies to end our meal.  Overall, my meal in it's entirety, was perfect for a work lunch.  Service was amazing; from my greeting at the door to the attentive, friendly service throughout our lunch.   Stellar service - thank you, Epic.  Looking forward to returning for lunch and dinner to try more items on the menu."}
{"text":"I came in for breakfast at 7 a.m. before my flight. I was very pleasantly greeted at the front counter (this is a high bar, because at this ungodly hour, I usually hate everyone and everything) and offered the day's newspaper. 

I was seated in a lovely spot, with gorgeous flowers on the table. The server was attentive and brought me hot tea in a pot and a glass of water. I ordered the breakfast buffet, which was AMAZING. The Ontario mushrooms were like something out of this world. In addition, the cooks will make you whatever kind of eggs you want, or omelettes, or a few other things. There were great options including bacon and sausages, grilled tomatoes, potatoes, scrambled eggs, fresh fruit, meats and cheeses, fresh breads and bagels, etc. 

I will also say this about the tea: Often, restaurants are terrible about tea. They bring you a mug of hottish water with a teabag on the side, and you have to do it yourself. (Imagine if they treated coffee drinkers like this!)

Epic doesn't do this. They brought me a pot of tea, which seemed to be loose-leaf and actually brewed, and it was appropriately hot, and delicious. I'd add an extra star just for knowing how to brew a proper cup of tea, but Yelp doesn't let me do that."}
{"text":"Stumbled into the Epic brunch while looking for something last minute. Food was delicious. service was impeccable. Buffett had great variety! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"It has a lot of potential but I had an \"eh\" experience. It started off with a hair in my proseco and then the waiter wouldn't let me order my lamb medium rare. He literally was fighting me about it. Now I'm sitting here with medium temp lamb and I'm pissed. 
Like I said the food has potential and the layout is beautiful. Service is eh as well. Our server barely came to our table and the place isn't even that busy. We served our own wine. Also the waiter never came to ask me about the lamb or anyone else about their food."}
{"text":"From salad, appetizer to entrée then dessert, we admired every course. Piece of art. Look nice, smell great and taste wonderful! A quiet place for business talk or date night. Not recommended for family style though. It's quite pricy. Our 4 course meal is close to $100 each."}
{"text":"This review is for the bar at Epic. I'm being generous with 2 stars as they were busy. I was originally going to the Library Bar but it was closed for filming. So off to Epic I went as I needed a space to work and send emails. Well what a disaster. Luckily I am a very patient person, but for people who are not, the service was disgraceful.
I arrived at the entrance and asked to be seated in the bar section. There were many empty tables that needed to be cleared and the hostess said there was nothing available and asked if I wanted a stool at the bar. I said no and that I wouldn't mind waiting. She again asked if I wanted a stool at the bar and said there would be a 5 minute wait. I asked if I could wait at the bar for my table and if she would personally grab me once a table was clear. As I sat I was greeted by one of the bartenders quite hastily and asked for my drink order, I asked for a menu and went for a top quality bourbon Manhattan. I asked if he had large rock cubes and he said no. I am very specific when it comes to my drink and I asked if he could only put 2 cubes in. As I was saying this to my horror he grabbed a scoop of ice and put it in a glass to shake my drink. Mid horror I asked him to stop - think of James Bond and the bartender messing up his classic staple martini - this was actually happening. It's like ordering an expensive liquor only to be watered down with ice - what was the point at all. Instead of fixing the drink to what I so patiently requested he continued to pour my drink and saying he must serve it cold. At this point, my hands are in my face cruising the bourbon Gods why they have forsaken me! He then carefully places 2 small cubes in my already watered down drink and pushes a small tray of bar nibbles in front of me. There's an older gentlemen siting beside me in awe of a women knowing her drink and asks if he should order the same. I insist he should stick to his glass of wine and next time go to the Library Bar if he likes cocktails. 
15 minutes have possibly gone by as I stir and stare at my glass. Where was this hostess. As I look around the room, many new faces and empty seats. Well, how's that for service. I interrupt a waitress and ask if I can be seated (again) and she agrees. A little but of shuffling and finally a table where I can get to work. 
For a hotel bar I was not happy that I physically had to move myself and my drink (sans coaster). I quickly start messaging away on my phone and getting some work done. 10 minutes in, sans nibbles, sans coater and sans waiter I start to wonder if I am in a bad service time zone. Am I not in the fairmont? 
A waiter questionably passes me and asks if I would like anything else. I politely inform him that actually no one has talked to me since I was seated. I could tell in his eyes he was frazzled and so busy he didn't know up from down. He quickly rectified everything and I continued to order some food. The rest of the service was great from then on."}
{"text":"The 2 of us came to the epic lounge around 5:15pm on a Monday to grab a glass of wine. It was a great spot to have a quiet conversation and a glass of wine. We stay for 1.5 hours and didn't feel rushed. I had a Raven's Wood Zinfandel and my friend had a Chardonnay. Our server Robert was very gracious and helpful. The bill came to about $35 with tax and tip."}
{"text":"It is quite decent, but it's only decent. The food is hotel oriented, meaning meat, potatoes, and classic French style desserts. Cocktails are the basics, and I wouldn't order beyond that. It's hard for me to imagine the prices being justified even at twice the quality."}
{"text":"The service was excellent - the staff were attentive, courteous and friendly. The food was tasty, but the hot holding stations don't keep things warm enough when you have multiple guests lifting lids (who I guess can't read menu cards) that need to SEE each item before they don't end up taking it. 

You get juice, coffee and tea with the weekend brunch buffet so I had an endless pot of English Breakfast and my husband had coffee. He LOVED the sugar bowl so much that he used the sugar. He never adds anything to his coffee. 

The only disappointment was some of the pastries were pretty dried out. I guess the \"price isn't high enough to keep riff raff out\" (staff member's words lol) - someone put a pastry in the toaster and it caught on fire. Also, there was an old guy going around eating out of cold buffet items, licking his fingers and touching service utensils. GROSS!"}
{"text":"A good 3.9

Relatively cozy old fashion pricey place, with good food, good combinations and ingredients. Cocktails are pretty good also!!

However, portion sizes are limited and food is not served warm enough (perhaps more the fault of the waiters than that of the cooks).

May come back during a Summer or Winterlicious and with granpas/granmas. Perhaps also the hotel ambiance has to do with the fact that I am not that eager to go again, although I had a great dinner there."}
{"text":"The food here was OK. I was a bit disappointed when I ordered the giant prawns and they were actually small shrimp. Although tasty, was not properly represented. The fritters are very yummy and I would recommend them."}
{"text":"The atmosphere and service was really good- 4.5 stars. But the food was extremely disappointing- both flavour and presentation was poorly executed. If it wasn't for our wonderful and kind server, (Jesus- sp?) I would've knocked this review down to 1 star. It seemed like a lack of effort was put into the summerlicious menu. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Food was spectacular... Went a year or so ago, but I wasn't yelping until 2016! 

I had a groupon,  awesome deal.   Hope that they do it again! 

Food was unbelievable.   Service too. 

ONLY complaint is that the wait for a table was outrageous, especially because we had made a reservation. 

Otherwise this was awesome.   Foies gras, lamb, desserts, salads, OMG. 

Definitely worth trying!"}
{"text":"So we decided to go to Epic restaurant inside Royal York Hotel. 

It's supposed to be an upscale restaurant inside a 5 star hotel where customers get special attention. 
Wrong! 

It didn't start right when we got seated. Our waiter disappeared on us after giving us the menu and served the red wine while I get an empty glass and no water. Past 25minutes, we saw our waiter just busy walking around serving other people. It was a total disappointment. We were simply ignored when there are so many vacant seats around us. Sometimes I wondered, am I not dressed properly and not wearing my diamonds? 

Another waiter came by and I asked what happened to our waiter?  He apologized and said he can serve us. He took our order and the food came in fast. Then the waiter said, sorry you don't have bread, let me get them. Oh boy. 

We ordered the pan seared chicken breast, flat iron steak and Royal York seafood chowder. The food was perfectly prepared just the right seasoning not too salty and just as we expected for this category of restaurant. Prices for lunch ranges from $26 to $32. Their lunch special is $39. Chowder was $16. But prices do not matter at all if you're there to have a nice lunch. 

Overall can't complain about the food. Just the poor service."}
{"text":"\"Dahling, could you ask the server to fetch moi a glass of grapefruit, with pulp of course?\"

The difference between the Breakfast Buffet at this place ($29/pp) and one that's say $15, is that the quality of food would be better, and there are some foodie-friendly food options (Like broiled tomatoes with pesto).

Given that this resto is housed in the ever-fancy Fairmont Royal York, one of the shwankiest of our hotels in Toronto, my expectations were high.  Perhaps too high - I first expected the spread to be rather neverending.

In the end, today's breakfast was very nice and I didn't leave bloated.  
Often, after going to buffets, I feel like an animal since that's similar to how farm animals are fed - the food is left out to be eaten/grazed on.  There's an expression that relates to that, used in my family btw.

pros:
-offers gluten-free and veg-friendly options;
-prunes and lychees were part of the fruit bar this morning;
-offers fruit juices, not fruit drinks (there _is_ a difference);
-service was good overall;
-foodie and locavore friendly

cons:
-$29/person;
-bacon looked oily;
-better value/nutrition if you ate at home (then again, one reason ppl eat out is b/c they don't want to bother prepping the food in the first place).

They offer cheaper A la Carte options, though these typically range from $18-$25 anyway.

I'm willing to go again... someday."}
{"text":"How about this is my new favourite place? 

My boyfriend scored a groupon and took me here for my birthday. Everything was spectacular. From the service to the food. Beginning to end, we were beyond satisfied. I appreciated the fact that we received amazing food and brilliant service despite the fact we had a groupon.

Probably the best steak I've had in Toronto. Every course was beautifully prepared with the best ingredients. The wine list was huge and the wine we settled with was superb. On top of our four-course meal, my boyfriend told the server it was my birthday. We got an additional dessert. 

Needless to say, we stumbled up to our hotel room and fell into a drunk and food coma state. It was seriously one of the best meals of my life. ALSO the daily brunch buffet is the best. Fairmont Hotels are worth the price, groupon or not. 

Bestest."}
{"text":"Took a client out to lunch there.
We were greeted warmly 
Ordered the lunch- I think it could've come out a little faster. 

The seafood chowder was excellent!
The bass was good too 

While we were enjoying the meal, my guest found a tiny little bug walking in his salad. It was so embarrassing. Especially when you are trying to take a client out to a nice restaurant and the last thing you would want is a bug showing up in his plate. 
That entree was immediately replaced and packed to go because by that time it got prepared, it was time to leave for my guest had other meetings. So my guest left hungry. 
The staff was apologetic although I wasn't expecting such a thing happening at the Epic. That meal was also taken off the bill.... good 

Basically It was out right embarrassing for me.

Even my third guest left his plate half eaten as he lost his appetite after looking at the bug.

Not a very pleasant experience"}
