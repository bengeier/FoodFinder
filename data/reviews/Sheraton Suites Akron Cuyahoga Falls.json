{"text":"Outstanding from arrival to leaving! Attentive and helpful staff who go above and beyond to help you out! Glad my business will have me backhoe the as I will be staying here again. Room is a well sized suite and very modern/up to date. Away from tracks, which I requested based on reviews on this site and was delivered.  Nice lounge."}
{"text":"5 stars  minus one. There is a train that comes every couple of hours though. Beware for sleep....nice hotel nice room"}
{"text":"When we first arrived in our room, the penthouse suite, the walls had wallpaper that was pulling off of it and looked generally in disrepair. Also multiple lamps did not have bulbs.  We were facing the parking lot which we knew in advance so that was fine.  Unfortunately, that first night, two different car alarms went off - once at 12a and again around 6a. 

That morning, tired since we did not get good sleep, we waited for our breakfast to come. We had ordered via the card on the door the previous night and had placed our card outside the door no later than 12a - the instructions were to place the card by 2a.  Our breakfast never came. I finally checked the door and saw that no one ever came by to pick up our breakfast order... We requested another room on the other side of the hotel in the am - the reception was very nice and we were moved without a problem. Great! 

That night, my husband went to the lounge to get us a drink (the sign says that it is open until 1a).  He went there around 11:30 and they were already closed.  The hotel staff stated that even though the sign says they are open til 1a, they are allowed to close at 11p... The next day (Saturday) was great!  

Sunday - Easter Sunday- was a real problem. We had plans to celebrate Easter with family at 2pm that day.  We called to order room service around 10:30a. When we called, we were told that room service was not available that day from 10a - 6p!  There had been no notice of this - not when we booked our stay, not when we checked in, not when we changed rooms and not even a sign under our door letting us know.  How does a hotel decide to close room service for 8hrs without any advance notice?  Their reason for closing was to prepare for their Easter brunch which was from 10a - 4p.  This was a well known brunch so they had plenty of notice to let hotel guests know that there was not going to be room service!  After speaking to his manager, the room service staff did finally take our order and delivered it.  I should not have had to go through this process, though.  Regardless, it was handled well by the staff.  

Next problem was later that night.  I had been told by room service on the phone that morning that room service was closed from 10a - 6p, so I knew not to call again during that time.  While my husband and 4 yr old were swimming, I thought I would get us a table and order us a light dinner around 8:45p (we, as most people, had a heavy Easter meal that afternoon and wanted something light). I was surprised to hear that the restaurant closed early - it closed at 8p! Again - no notice.  I asked the staff if I could just order it as room service, then.  Shockingly I was told the entire kitchen was closed! The kitchen closed at 8p!!!  This was incredibly frustrating as I was told directly by staff that morning that their would be no room service from 10a - 6p - which would lead most people to believe that after 6p the room service would be back to normally scheduled hours!  It was not. Again - no notice and now incorrect information!  I asked if I could speak to the manager. I was told that they would be at the front desk in the morning.  I said OK and started walking back to my room.  I was barely 20 feet away and the two female bartenders started talking about me!  I heard them saying not nicely (what does she expect - it's Easter - why does she think the restaurant/room service would be open, etc).  I could not believe it!  The hotel staff was now talking behind my back!  

I did an extensive hotel search in the surrounding area.  Apparently this is the only 3 star or better hotel close to our family in Hudson.  Does the hotel make these rules and have such terrible service because they have to competition in the area??? There are a few in Akron/Fairlawn - about 35 minutes from family and of course in Cleveland - 45 minutes from family. We did find a few bed and breakfasts, though that were within 20 minutes of family.  We will be visiting this area at least yearly and very much hope that another hotel chain will open up so that we can stay there instead."}
{"text":"I am also a frequent visitor of the Sheraton Suites in Cuyahoga Falls, and I definitely concur with Michael L. and Mike D. on many of the points in their reviews.

Positives:
The staff is truly exemplary
Free access to the local natotorium is a fantastic perk
Very spacious rooms
On-site gym

Negatives:
The internet service is AWFUL
Food at Beau's is overpriced for the quality you get
The internet service is TERRIBLE
No accessible rooms with kitchens
The internet service STINKS
The lounge food doesn't compare to other similarly sized Sheraton properties
Did I mention the internet ISN'T VERY GOOD?

Overall, I'm giving this place 3 stars (mostly on account of the incredible staff). As a business traveler, internet reliability is an absolute must, and if they would just make a simple investment in improving their internet, I'd happily jump to at least 4 stars."}
{"text":"[Update to previous post wherein I almost died of smoke inhalation] 

So...although the hotel was completely sold out, the staff manager kindly moved me to a *completely smoke free* suite a couple of doors down. Additionally, I received a call from a Starwood social media coordinator asking me about my new accommodations and what else Sheraton could do to make my stay a more pleasant one. 

All in all, a very appropriate resolution, handled with the aplomb and graciousness I've come to expect from the Cuyahoga Falls staff. Thanks y'all!! +2 stars for effort. 

**Now, when are we going to do something about being regaled by non-stop Fox News in the lounge each morning?**

Baby steps, eh? ;)"}
{"text":"Updating my previous review, the room I checked into underwent a complete overhaul - brand new carpeting, new couch, new drapes, lamps etc. Clearly a lot of money and work went into refreshing the room.

So why did I remove 2 stars from my review?

Because they spent all this time renovating the room, which was perfectly fine as it was, while completely ignoring the unusable wifi that has been the case for months (ironically, I had to tether just to get to Yelp).

I have no clue who thought up the idea to renovate the rooms while ignoring problems that actually impact their clientele, but they need a better focus group if they determined that business travelers (I'm guessing they make up a significant portion of the Sheraton's occupancy rates?) think that the color of the couch is of greater importance than the usability of the wifi.

Tip to the management: Don't keep running with the \"we're working hard to improve it with a reputable company\" line. We're all in the corporate world, we know canned corporate-babble when we hear it, it's not fooling anybody. If anything, admitting that in the 21st century, it's taking you over a year to bring your wifi up to levels easily found in motel 6s, probably looks worse for the hotel than just admitting you don't care about the issue.

I started slowly gravitating away from the Sheraton toward the end of 2014 despite my love of SPG, I suspect I will be permanently dissociated soon if all that \"hard work\" on the wifi situation doesn't bear fruit in the next few weeks. The Country Inn & Suites a block away might be a 2 star hotel with ugly carpeting, but I had no issues checking my email there"}
{"text":"Okay, so I've stayed here twice and each time I needed to do some work in the afternoon and each time they acted like it was a big deal to give me a late checkout.  Okay, look, I live a couple months a year in your hotel chain, don't hassle me when I request a late checkout.  It's not as if every guest for the next night is checking in at 2 p.m.

The rooms are pretty nice, but you should know that this hotel has really bipolar views. The riverside has a view of a beautiful little waterfall which also creates really relaxing background noise. You can see the river better the lower your floor. The cityside has a view of, like, a couple gas stations.

The hotel has a respectable swimming pool.  For some reason the designers were really asleep at the wheel when they built this place because they could have put the hot tub overlooking the waterfall but instead put it on the other side of the pool. Why even go to architecture school if you're going to miss opportunities to build hot tubs that have views of waterfalls?

The restaurant is really surprisingly pretty good and the architects were paying attention when they built it because it hangs over the waterfall.

I'll  give it four stars, because it's much nicer than you'd expect from Akron, which by reputation is a city that smells like tires."}
{"text":"Excellent hotel. Free parking near interstate, safe area, bars within walking distance. Friendly and helpful staff. Bat and restaraunt in lower level of hotel. Clean and spacious creek suites. Easy choice for the Cuyahoga Falls area!"}
{"text":"Nice rooms and lounge but the wifi network is horrible. So bad in fact, you can't get any work done. Won't stay again."}
{"text":"Fantastic stay in my opinion. Such a fun hotel with a fantastic view of the river right next door. I appreciated that the hotel is right off the highway and was very easy to find. Staff was always warm and friendly. The bar in the hotel was nice too -- good drinks and friendly bar service. There are also some bars right across the street if you're looking for something to do. The weather in Akron during my stay was AWFUL, but the hotel staff even lent us an umbrella to use which was really kind of them. Room was clean and well-sized. Overall, a fantastic hotel. No complaints from me!"}
{"text":"I would not rate this an up scale hotel.
Bed pillows are weak. 
Restaurant  told us chrismas was full. Come to find out they were  not. They stated they did not get the walk-ins they expected. We are quest at the hotel.
It seems the hole hotel misses a step.
I Would not stay here again .
Noise from the train at 4 in the morning. 
Disappointing  for a sharton."}
{"text":"There's a lot to like about this all suite hotel, and it all starts at the front desk upon arrival. Once you walk through the front entrance and turn right you'll meet the first of many members of the exceptional staff, I found the check-in process simple and efficient. This well maintained hotel overlooking the scenic Cuyahoga River Gorge offers plenty of room to work or relax, I've spent multiple days here on several occasions and I've never been disappointed. 

The complimentary parking, restaurant and a Business Center are just a few of the many amenities everyone can enjoy, if you're a Club guest you also have special access to the Club Lounge. A place for relaxing that offers complimentary breakfast, afternoon hors d'oeuvres and a variety of beverage. There's no doubt this is one of the better options in the area."}
{"text":"I took a tour of the Sheraton and found this place to be beautiful. I stayed in one of their rooms a few weekends later and was very comfortable. It was quiet and the staff was super friendly. I walked in late at night and granted how late it was the guy working the front desk still had a smile on his face and greeted me kindly. I am very big on customer service and to say the least I will be going back."}
{"text":"Wow. As a Platinum Starwood member, I get around to plenty of Sheratons, Westins, W's, etc., as well as a few Sheraton Suites. This place is off the charts. I blanched at the $189.00 price tag, but being that it was on the company dime, I decided to take a flier on this hotel. It's worth every penny. Dynamite suite rooms, amazing waterfall from the Cuyahoga River right outside my window, and an Amazing fine dining restaurant that was 4 stars all day long, inside the hotel! 

I'm telling you, this place is serious about providing an experience, and they deliver. BTW, there is a craft beer bar across the street (aptly named Craft Beer Bar), and a bistro next to the CBB, if a killer in-house restaurant at the hotel doesn't grab your attention (but it should!!!). I'll be back."}
{"text":"The one star is for the room itself, clean, updated, comfty beds, nice shower and vanity area.  

However, the noise factor at this hotel makes it one of the worst I've ever stayed in.  On the river side, the highway is extremely noisy and then let's talk about the train. Oh my. Every 30 minutes a ridiculously loud honking train came by and im talking about at night... for hours. It woke up us and our two year old all night. At 1am I called the front desk to ask when it would stop and I was quickly told it ran ALL night! Wth! He did offer to move us to the city side so the very next morning we packed up all our stuff and moved, what a pain.

The next night there was an outdoor rock concert on the city side! Until 2am, super loud van halen cover band! Don't get me wrong, if I wasn't traveling with kids, I would have been at that concert rockin out but that was not the case and here we were once again, sleepless. There was another concert the next night as well, not as loud as the first but still loud.  

Last thing I'll mention is the windows... they are so cheap and do not close properly, I think this was part of the noise issue.  Time to upgrade those windows I say, especially with all the noisy issues happening all around this hotel! I would never stay there again."}
{"text":"Very nice digs for $45 on Priceline. 

We stayed in a very large, comfortable two-room suite.  Spacious dressing area with separate bathroom, wet bar, two flat panel TVs.. it made us want to stay here instead of returning home eventually. 

The pool and exercise facilities were a nice addition, and we also utilized the free wifi. 

We smuggled our cats in (and they loved the place too!), only to find out that they allow pets.  No sneaking around necessary!

For breakfast, we checked out the restaurant on the ground floor.  Nice views and comfortable setting, but we were never presented with menus.  Maybe the breakfast buffet (about $12 a person) is all they offer?  The spread was saved by the omelet station; everything else was pretty mediocre.  And they put meat in their scrambled eggs.  No love for the vegetarians. 

If ever in the area again, we would stay here again, especially if we could score another great deal on Priceline."}
{"text":"Overall a very clean and modern hotel. Staff was helpful upon check in and then housekeeping team did a good job. However, the paint was peeling from the ceiling in our room and the internet speed was slooooooooow almost to the point of being unusable, even for basic tasks."}
{"text":"We made reservations for 12 people 2 weeks ago asking to sit by the windows.  They did not want to sit us by them.   There was one other table than us. All other tables were empty.   Service was very very slow  food was served either cold or luke warm. They microwaved to fix. We could not order off a regular menu. We had a special menu that was very limited we were not told this  Sadly We willl not be return."}
{"text":"Not what I expected for a Starwood Property.

Positives:
*Pet friendly and NO PET FEE! (Main reason I chose to stay here)
*Good location right off the interstate
*Nice rooms, beds and linens
*Friendly, chatty housekeeping staff who brought us extra coffee and creamer at night

Negatives:
*Totally apathetic front desk staff - Saturday night I asked if there was any place to eat in the area and the guy looked at me like \"Duh!\" and pointed down the street.  There was NOTHING down the street open at 8:00 on a Saturday night except 1 bar.  We later found the lower riverwalk area, but it wans't obvious from the hotel
*Our bathtub had hair in it and the drain plug was removed as though they had been working on the tub.
*Parking lot can be crowded on the weekend

I would only stay here again if the price were no more than staying at one of the other chain hotels.  At the regular price, this hotel is overpriced."}
{"text":"Very very impressed to say the least. First class accommodations. Amazing price. Great restaurant and bar plus conveniently located. I am pleasantly surprised by Sheraton. So much so that I joined Starwood Preferred and will add this to my list of \"okay\" places to sleep and work!!! Wow! Loving this place!"}
{"text":"As a frequent visitor - on the weeks I face the city (non-train side) - I would bump this to 4 stars; on the weeks I face the river (aka the train/ loud side) - this is 3 stars. The staff is super friendly and rooms spacious. Both would bump up a star if the internet speed was workable. There are times I can barely hold a signal to get text through."}
{"text":"I am partial to Starwood hotels - probably because I stay in one whenever possible.  So when I needed to book a hotel in the greater Cleveland area, I was more than slightly surprised that my only options were this hotel and a Sheraton at the airport.  It's a 40 minute drive from Cleveland.   I opted for the Sheraton Suites, which had predominantly good reviews, save for Kelsey C.'s

I arrived on a Friday evening around 6pm and checked in without issue - we were offered a room upgrade without even asking due to our spg status.  When I booked the room online, I requested a falls view, which was accommodated.

The room was clean, which is the most important thing to me.  As for the decor, it could certainly use a little bit of a facelift.  There were 2 nice flat screen televisions in my room though - one in the bedroom and one in the living room.  Other than a walk down to the \"rocks\" the following morning, I did not utilize any of the facilities - the exercise room looked nice though.

One major downside is that on Friday nights in the summer time, there is some kind of festival across the street, which made parking at a premium.

This hotel is more than adequate for business travel or a for a vacation.  The sweet sleeper bed was extremely comfortable.  This Sheraton is not luxe by any standard, but was perfectly suitable for my overnight stay in the area.  For the class of hotel, I'd recommend it."}
{"text":"Very nice updated rooms. I stayed here years ago for my cousins wedding and almost didn't recognize the place because it was redone in recent years. The rooms were very comfortable and up to Sheraton standards. The amenities in the hotel were also fantastic. The bar downstairs on the river has a beautiful view in the summer and because this is a Sheraton Suites hotel the king bed rooms are amazing, equipped with a little sitting room and overly large bathroom. I was very impressed with the amount of space we got. When we requested a crib for our son it was sent up right away and ready for us when we came back from lunch for an afternoon nap. I used to work for Starwood and when they were purchased by Marriott I was concerned they wouldn't uphold the level of professionalism and hospitality that Starwood has always had but I can see the brand is still true to itself."}
{"text":"Recently stayed at this hotel for a wedding. The hotel itself was nice, but I have never received such poor customer service. When we checked out, we were told the room was comped, taken care of and we did not owe any payment and we were good to go. We thought this sounded odd, so we double checked with the front desk clerk and she assured us we did not owe anything and that the room was taken care of. We get home and find we were in fact charged for our stay. Tried to call the hotel, they admitted to their mistake but would not compensate us in any way. I work in the hospitality business and refer my clients over to the Sheraton all of the time. I will not be referring any of my clients over to any Sheraton hotels in the future, nor will I ever stay at a Sheraton owned hotel again. Do not stay here."}
{"text":"Staff is great! Fast response time for problems and very friendly. Located in a quiet area.

The rooms are nice because they are all suites, so you don't really get much outside noise from the hallways. They are also really large!

If you get a room on the \"Falls\" side, lower is better (higher up you hear the train). But the city view is nice high up. 

Probably a great place for weddings, but we've always been here for the Akron marathon."}
{"text":"We had a lovely two night stay in this Sheraton last month. The suite was huge with modern furniture and a huge marble bathroom with a jacuzzi. The front desk staff  need a bit of training but it didn't detract from our expieriance. They also have a lovely restaurant on site called Beau's. It's right on the river and the food is too notch. I say this a great hotel for a romantic evening or a weekend with family."}
{"text":"For several months the management has been telling us that they're working on getting the wifi working. And for several months nothing has changed. You can't send email. You can't log into corporate websites to do work. You can't do anything you should be able to do since 2002. They say it's because the building is poured concrete, but that's ridiculous. You can get a signal anywhere, but data won't load.  Really they don't want to spend the money to bring their infrastructure up to modern standards. And they don't care if you go to other hotels in the area, the management company owns those, too, so you don't really have a choice, and they know it. Expect less than the bare minimum at this place."}
{"text":"You would seriously think that after everything they put us through, they would at some point get their shit together. Darrell Hudson may just go down in history as one of the worst managers and individuals in customer service I've ever encountered. 

After the fiasco of not having the points posted to our account and being two days away from our trip was finally settled. And by settled I mean I had to call him, email him and keep bothering him to get it done in a timely manner as we were leaving in 48 hours. He was going out of town and luckily left the problem with the more than adept Heather. I wish I had been able to deal with her all along. Not only was she efficient but she was professional. Before he left town he told me that he would immediately post 6000 points to our account so we wouldn't have to worry about the first nights lodging and hope the 28000 points would go through as soon as possible.

We ended up not being able to use the points at all that holiday since we were incorrectly informed by starwood reservations that the San Francisco Sheraton would be able to accommodate us and our two dogs. 

We decided we have had enough of this company. With our baby due in two months and it being our one year wedding anniversary, we decided to spend all the points on a nice resort in Palm Springs and just be done with it@ I called to reserve our room early this week and was told the 6000 points were never posted to our account.

I was able to get a call back from Darrell a day later trying to argue that he was only going to post the points to the account until the others went through but he messed up and they never posted. In his logic, since the other points went through it didn't matter that he had already commited to giving us the 6000 points regardless of the status of the other ones. He finally relented but said he wasn't sure when they would post.

Management here is highly questionable, absolutely irresponsible, and sadly beyond untrained in normal customer service practices. If you make a mistake FIX IT, without question and without hassle. 

I understand mistakes, it happens to the best of us but I have a huge problem with the resolution of this issue taking nearly a year and with me having to hound management. 

Now that this is finally settled, I'll be writing to all of the wedding websites, local newspapers and NE ohio wedding magazines...I hope no one else is treated with the blatant disregard we were shown"}
{"text":"Everything is very nice here.  The rooms are spacious and (among other things) include two large remote controlled flat screen TVs, a sofa, coffee table, a decent work desk with lots of plugs, nice amenities, comfortable bed, etc.  The free wi-fi is a nice feature too.  Best of all, the staff I encountered were all professional and nice.

One thing...if you're a light sleeper, ask for a side of the hotel that doesn't have the waterfall sound.  If the nearby waterfall isn't frozen, it makes a \"white noise\" that is like an air conditioner on full blast.  I personally don't have a problem with it, but thought I'd mention it for those that would have a problem with such a noise.

The restaurant (Piatto) serves great food.  Everything I've had there was very good quality.  When I mentioned I didn't eat meat, they went out of their way to accomodate my vegearian needs.  It was not expected here, but I was impressed.  Save up for the end, they have a wide selection of deserts that I didn't expect here.

Bottom line, I highly recommend this hotel and the restaurant they have.  In my opinion, a room here is quite a good buy at any rate under $140."}
{"text":"One of my very best friends got married here in the winter it was so beautiful, gorgeous rooms and everyone was nice and the space worked out perfectly.

It was an awesome weekend with her family and friends that we made memories that will last a lifetime!"}
{"text":"In a word, phenomenal! Service is bar none. Specials are great and food is delicious. 

Rooms are super comfortable and spacious. Being an SPG member truly yields benefits.

Take advantage of all the space has to offer as it's area is amazing!"}
{"text":"Stayed here for 3 nights over the Burning River 100 race weekend. Room was big, clean, and comfortable. We faced the river, which was pretty, but as others have said, the trains are loud (though I never heard one after 7pm or overnight), and motorcycles or whatever on the highway on the other side of the river are loud. I tried to set the thermostat to \"fan on\" to drown out some of the outside noise, which I do in every hotel, but it wasn't an option :( So I would wake up almost every time the A/C kicked on or off. We didn't notice any issues with the wifi. Location was great for the race, easy to check in and out, breakfast in the restaurant was decent (though overpriced), nice to have the mini fridge, bed was comfy, staff was friendly, would stay again if in the area, just not facing the river."}
{"text":"Very nice spacious rooms. The rushing river almost drowns out the nearby freeway. We had breakfast at their restaurant overlooking the river - the atmosphere was nice but the breakfast was not very good. Still, we're here for the rooms and they were very comfortable and clean. Also appreciate the free wi-fi."}
{"text":"I was REALLY hoping to stay at this hotel for my sisters wedding in September because the two rooms would be helpful for us- we are traveling with 18 month old twins. Unfortunately, she changed her mind on the room block location. I had already reserved the room with my rewards card and it was non refundable. The hotel agreed to refund my room with no hassle and I am so very appreciative! Their customer service policy will bring me back to their hotel for my next visit and I will choose Sheraton Suites locations whenever I have the choice."}
{"text":"Breakfast buffet was pretty bad.  Overlooked omlettes, cold potatoes and hard pastries. The fruit and oatmeal set up was nice. But the cost was not comparable to the quality."}
{"text":"Very nice hotel. The rooms were clean and comfortable and we enjoyed dinner and views from the restaurant. Bonus points for the dog bed, good service and Tuesday night drinks and apps in the lobby. Thanks for the military rate and being dog friendly! We enjoyed our 1st floor room on the falls side. We didn't hear the highway noise, but the train ran often during the night. That, plus scratchy towels is why I gave it 4 stars. Wish there was a 4.5 rating!"}
{"text":"First the good.  We stayed on the 5th floor, in a suite.  

Everything was clean, and there are two showers, and two bathrooms.  Very nice. Front desk personnel were very nice as well.  and the lobby looks great, as others have stated.  

The TV has great DirecTV.  By that, I mean it's not limited cable like many hotels.  It includes the NFL Network, etc., so that's a plus.  I have DirecTV at home, which is good, however, none of the channels match.  It would be great if that could be standardized.  

We called maintenance because the refrigerator was making weird noises and he was at the room within minutes!  Great response time (unfortunately, he couldn't do anything about it). 

The view at breakfast of the Cuyahoga River, along with the restaurant ambience/decor, are great. Breakfast was included with our room (except for gratuities).  A plus.  

Now the bad. 
1.  The internet was SO BAD i could not even run www.speedtest.net to see how slow it was - it would fail.  I ended up having to create a personal hotspot with my iPhone and get online that way.  For us as business owners, that isn't acceptable. 

More importantly, I read other reviews and many people have commented on this, yet the hotel fails to fix it.  They do respond to reviews, so I know they are seeing the problem.  that this problem still exists in May of 2016, THAT IS A COMPLETE FAILURE ON MANAGEMENT.  UNACCEPTABLE.  

2.  The room is split, with the bedroom upstairs, which means you have to carry all of your luggage up and down stairs.  Not good when you're tired from traveling, just poor design layout.  

3.  Paying for a suite enabled us to get a kitchen, with fridge, etc. like a Residence Inn that i normally stay at.  However, unlike the Residence Inn, they include NOTHING - no paper towels, etc.  So I had to grab a towel from the bathroom because I didn't have any paper towels (and they have a sign about water conservation and minimizing having to wash towels - ironic).

4.  There is a train track right  behind the hotel, and the train is very noisy all night long.  

5. My wife asked for a feather free room, and the pillows on the couch had feathers coming out of them (see photo). 

I'll look elsewhere if there is a next time I'm staying in the area - the internet problem is a deal breaker for business travelers like us, and it's obvious management isn't going to fix it."}
{"text":"Excellent hotel! Well decorated lobby and main areas. Rooms were spectacular for the price and location. Turn down service was above-par, the maid placed my toiletries very thoughtfully and took special care. 
Starbucks coffee in room daily and 2 Dasani water bottles refreshed daily! The hotel bar staff was pleasant and provided great service as well. 

My only suggestion- since there are few stores around this area in walking distance, the hotel lobby's pantry could be better stocked with a wider variety of items for traveling professionals (headphones, travel mice, etc). Otherwise, fantastic place!"}
{"text":"Very nice hotel. Front desk staff friendly. Quick checkin. Very cool location right on the river. Rooms are large and clean."}
{"text":"Great music in the lounge on Friday nights. Food and service very good! Very reasonable and good wine list."}
{"text":"Love it! From check-in to check-out, a great experience. Check-in staff was very friendly and helpful - a special tip of the hat to the guys working the front desk around 6:30 p.m. Friday, January 29. The interior of the building was clean, modern, and very attractive. The room was very clean, spacious and well-appointed with Starbucks coffee, and the trademark Sheraton soap and shampoo - with a scrunchy to work up a good lather! I'd tell you more about the bed, but it was so comfy that I fell asleep within seconds of my head hitting the pillow. When I woke up the next morning, I had a spectacular view of the Cuyahoga River Rapids - awesome"}
{"text":"On a project in Canton but drive to Akron to stay here (20 min drive). The rate is usually $122 (plus tax) per night. The rooms are great, one bed room suites with a sitting area, desk and little dinette. Super plus, this location has a Club Lounge - but I never make it with enough time to eat anything but you can always grab drinks. I haven't dined in but have ordered their room service which is decent, I wish they had healthier options but room service usually doesn't.
Overall its a great spot in a cute town. I will stay here as long as as the weather isn't crazy and my commute is around 20 min."}
{"text":"I live in town, & I've alllways wanted to stay here - you know, ever since the Backstreet Boys did in the '90s! My out-of-town boyfriend booked a room here for his last night visiting me, & I was thrilled!

I was told that a room with a single queen bed would be almost $200. When I inquired about military rates, we were told a suite was just $85! Best military rate I've ever heard of, because it turns out that room was AMAZING - huge, spacious, pristine, with a nice view of the falls. We did dinner at Piatto Novo, which I've also reviewed, then settled in for a nice evening cozied up in a giant, fluffy bed.

Seriously. That bed. Can I just LIVE at the Sheraton...?"}
{"text":"Nice hotel BUT I did not get the room I reserved, the entire hotel is like a steam room and the TV in the main room of our \"suite\" is broken. Not very happy."}
{"text":"Absolutely beautiful. Helpful staff, clean accommodations, nicely scented soaps and Starbucks coffee in the room. Room service available on a Sunday. Wonderful food. 

I ordered the Asian mushroom soup (5/5) Caesar salad, truffle mushrooms and a peanut butter pie. Easily the best food that I've had in years. It came quickly, cleanly, and with a tall glass of iced water, even though I forgot to ask for something to drink besides beer. Oh, and they deliver a selection of craft and import beers to your room for a reasonable price. Can't ask for more. 

Stayed in a King Suite overlooking the river. Wonderful accommodations."}
{"text":"A good place for us to stay for a night with our dogs on our way to Chicago. Comfy, clean and quiet, a place to get a good nights rest. 
We had a good dinner in the attached restaurant but I'd skip the breakfast the next time. I had the worst pancakes - little greasy circles of rubber.  Inedible."}
{"text":"Nice hotel with poor service. We made reservations and the service put us in a Cleveland hotel so when we arrived at the cuyahoga falls hotel they didn't have our reservation 
I had prepaid for 4 nights and they wouldn't honor them and wanted us to pay 229 per night instead of the 109 I had prepaid. Told us reservation dept would open an investigation and we might get the other money I had prepaid. I asked for phone number and the gave me wrong number for reservations. I looked it up on my iPod 
At the front desk. Called them they cancelled the wrong res in Cleveland and found me a rate at the hotel I was supposed to be at for 123
The hotel then honored the rate. The were going to charge me 229 and I would have never have gotten the prepaid refund back. It took me 1.5 hours to check in while the waited for me to straighten it out myself. 
Also they don't have a bellman to bring up luggage. They have a one cup coffee maker in the room but have coffee pods for a 10 cup mr. coffee 
Pot. We asked for smaller pod or bigger pot , they didn't have either. My wife went to the gym but got locked in because her room key wouldn't open door to exit 
Bar was supposed to be open till 11 but closed at 10 because business was slow.

This hotel likes to pretend they are a luxury property but don't provide the service to match. 

Beautiful rooms if you can put up with poor service"}
{"text":"I just love this hotel and lounge. It is a bit pricey, that's the only downfall, $4 for a miller lite, or might be $4.50. But the lounge is beautiful, the lobster bisque is amazing. The bartender in the lounge, i forget his name, dark hair, mustache, always makes you feel like a VIP as soon as you set foot in there.  It's worth the extra money on the drinks. And if you get a seat by the windows, what a view. They sometimes have bands as well, and it is just a nice classy place to relax. Oh and to top it off they have keno if you feel like wagering on the side as well. i'm totally a fan."}
{"text":"I love this hotel!  I stay at Starwoods all over the country and was not expecting much for this hotel since it is in a smaller town. Let's just say I was pleasantly surprised! 

The club lounge is open on the weekends which is great when you have to leave early and go to the office on these days too. Also, the rooms are very spacious and clean. The gym is very modern and even provides exercise routines for business travelers.  The rooms have a great view of the falls and so does the restaurant.

Everyone was great at this hotel but I will point out at check-in I had a younger girl who had just started. She was kind of unprofessional when I asked her about a platinum award issue that she didn't address and was very rude with her answer. Usually if you don't know the answer, you will find out for someone and not just say you don't know. Everyone else there was FANTASTIC and made me feel like it was truly my home away from home. 

Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"My father-in-law invited the family to come together & enjoy the hotels Thanksgiving buffet & I gotta say the food was just as I expected- kind of blah. The buffet layout was beautiful, clean & everything was clearly labeled. With the exception of the rude man carving the desert dry turkey with the so greasy crisp skin I almost threw up, the service was attentive & polite. 
However, the only enjoyable part of the meal was the cheese danish & croissant I had. Otherwise the pasta salad tasted funky, I didn't get past four bites. My husband ordered waffles that looked as if someone had dumped eggs into a waffle iron- jiggly, odd color, & not appealing at all. And the music, ugh! It was so loud!!!! 
But the worst part of the meal was the bill. With a party of 13 ( 5 of them being children ) the cost was over $400.00!!! The menu was very similar to Bob Evans with a few exceptions like caviar with no crackers or bread to put it on or the salmon... I just didn't feel this was worth all the hype. 

But if you are planning on staying in the actual hotel, the view is just as stunning as everyone says it is!"}
{"text":"This hotel was beautiful.  We had an amazing suite.  Two big rooms and a huge bathroom.  The breakfast was excellent.  I have paid twice as much for hotels that weren't as nice as this one."}
{"text":"We met friends for the Sheraton's much touted Sunday brunch. It was $30 badly spent on uninspired bad food, store bought pastries and pies, cold well done prime rib station, tasteless caviar with nothing to eat it on, truly stale croissants( packaged bad ones) and stale chocolate cake. 
To ad insult to injury, there was an extra $3.00 charged to our bill for orange juice. Really?
Upside? Server was nice. There's an ok omelette and pancake station. It is a gorgeous view of a gorge, water fall and river and a pretty tiered venue. Worth $33.00 plus tip? Absolutely NOT. The petty $3.00 OJ still burns me."}
{"text":"Poor form Manager of Sheraton Cuyahoga for returning our weekly loyal patronage by tossing us all out next week in favor of a higher paying group."}
