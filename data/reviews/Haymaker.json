{"text":"Great atmosphere and location, food was delicious. The dishes were unique and had so much flavor. New favorite restaurant"}
{"text":"Not impressed with the quality of food versus the price to be honest. Super limited menu with only 5 entrees priced pretty high (26+ dollars). Ordered the shrimp & grits which came with a pickled pepper oil on top which threw the whole flavor off. Drinks were tasty but the shady something drink came in a SUPER tiny glass which made it not worth the 12 dollars. The Mac & cheese stole the show! Creamy, bacony, and a slight crunch from the bread crumbs on top . Waiter was also nice & helped with question. Probley won't return until drink size and menu are expanded."}
{"text":"Overall really loved the atmosphere here although it seemed almost impossible to get a reservation, but we were able to snag one of the three first come, first serve bar tables which turned out great.   I think the small plates and sides are the stars at this place.  The small plate pork belly, asparagus, and hush puppies were amazing.  The hush puppy jalapeño butter is sooooo so good.  Very unimpressed with my entree though.  I had the flounder and it was very very bland with no seasoning.  My husband didn't even want to finish my leftovers of it when he met us here later in the night.  I was a little surprised since they have a small entree list, you would think they would all be pretty good.  My friend got the fried quail and said it was just okay.  We all loved the Mac and cheese though and the fingerling potatoes.  Even though I wasn't impressed with the entrees I would come back here because it's a really good trendy atmosphere with nice interior design touches and right in the city with good drinks."}
{"text":"Exceptional NC farm to table cuisine with a welcoming atmosphere! We celebrated a special occasion for our first visit to Haymaker. The food was fabulous, the awesome servers were pleasant and helpful! The decorations made the ambience relaxing & casual in an upscale atmosphere.   We shared small plates, and the prices were very reasonable. My favorites were the pork belly and the cornmeal hush puppies with jalapeño butter. They were the best hush puppies I have eaten!! The butter had a little heat, not too much, just gave you more flavor with the hush puppies' dough!  The pork belly was cripsy, had a peanut sauce, over black-eyed peas.  Another small plate we enjoyed was the shrimp & grits, they prepared with a butter & vinaigrette sauce. That was an unusual combination to me but it worked with the buttery grits with manchego cheese. Finally, we had roasted beets, yellow and purple, with granola and nuts and again sounds unique but tasty and amazing flavors. The nutty granola with the tang of the vegetables was delicious.    My husband enjoyed the beer selection and I had a mock-tail from our new buddy, Evelyn, the bartender. The drink was heaven in a glass, Evelyn invented it for me and it was a citrus, berry delight!!  Dessert was a delicious strawberry shortcake with strawberry wine sorbet and the fluffiest cake you could desire. The combination of flavors was truly phenomenal!!   Valet parking is complimentary, so parking was easy!! Give yourself or your SO a true present and eat at Haymaker.   The decorations are all clean lines, rustic photos, and huge windows facing Romare Bearden park, absolutely lovely."}
{"text":"We were pleasantly surprised last night.  My fiance and I split several small plates at the suggestion of our server.  We liked everything but our favorites were the pork belly which got its flavor from the fresh earthy beans with it, the shrimp & grits were the most uniquely flavored I've ever had in a good way, and the carrots with za'atar were delicious (we didn't think they'd be that good but they were great).  Our least favorite was the hush puppies and butter but they were still good.  Don't sit upstairs unless in the big table in the nook until they upgrade the ambiance."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Haymaker after a day of wandering around the city. I have to say, the owner did a great job of bringing the feel of Asheville to uptown. The staff were very friendly and laid back while still being attentive.   We arrived a little early for our reservation so we sat at the bar. While I can't remember what drinks we ordered, they were delicious and the bartender was a friendly guy. I've also got to give props to the bar back because she was on top of her stuff keeping everything in order and making sure everyone sitting at the bar received great service.   Once we sat down we were in a little corner nook by the slightly open kitchen. The restaurant is a little loud but we were in no mood to be bothered by noise. Our server was friendly and checked in frequently but not too often. We started with the beets and pork belly for appetizers and to our advantage they accidentally brought us asparagus as well which was comped after deciding to let us eat it. The beets were amazing and this is coming from a guy who remembers cringing at beets as a kid. All the apps were plated nicely and had great flavor without overwhelming seasoning.   My wife ordered trout and I had the strip. Both were cooked perfectly and complimented by their accompanying sides. We finished with the strawberry shortcake which I must say the strawberry sorbet was DANK. Could probably eat a gallon of it.   All in all I would definitely recommend Haymaker. The pricing is great for the level of taste, and I felt as though the portion size was perfect."}
{"text":"I can't quite spring for the 5-stars, but I am thrilled that an establishment such as the Haymaker has finally graced Charlotte and brought people outside of their bubble.  The location is great in uptown, and parking isn't really that bad.  We dined here on a Tuesday in the upstairs area. Few notes: it was a bit loud and busy (!! great, excited for them), and service was really good, but the upstairs felt, just off...the lack of decor, the carpet. It felt like a forgotten part of the space that didn't flow from the downstairs aesthetic. Half-star dock.  We ordered cheese, charcuterie, and the pickle plate. All three exceeded our expectations, and the portions were great.  Here is another half-star dock...the lack of dietary restriction options. Farm to table is traditionally cleaner food, but there was not ONE dietary thing listed on the menu, and there was gluten everywhere I looked.  Super disappointing in that respect. I mean even the cheese plate had a bunch of granola that was touching the cheese.   I ended up eating two appetizers and taking a bite of my boyfriend's steak (which the server did not know off the top of his head if it was GF or not...I didn't really dock too much of that, I mean they were just a week old). The other guests loved the mac and cheese.  I would like to try for cocktails another time and maybe an app and see how they expand and change their dinner menu."}
{"text":"Didn't change my life but early days so the full dinner menu wasn't yet available. Lunch menu looks better. Skip the heirloom salad. Shrimp and grits were good, but the bread might have been the best thing we had."}
{"text":"Got to come try Haymaker which has only been open a couple months so far and it was pretty amazing! The decor and ambience was like casual elegance -- perfect for a nice dinner experience in uptown with an awesome view of Romare Bearden but didn't feel overly pretentious or stuffy. Now to the food...we got 2 of the small plates (Hushpuppies, Foraged Mushroom Toast, all of the sides (Mac & Cheese, Roasted Carrots, Fingerling Potatoes), the side of bread and 2 large plates (Grouper, Dumplings). The must haves are the bread, the Mac and cheese which comes with bacon, the potatoes which have this amazing Fresno aioli which is too die for and the hushpuppies.  All of the food was delicious and came out promptly. The service was spot on all night which is fantastic for any new place in Charlotte. Also tried the Old Fashioned and Haymaker Punch which weren't the best drinks I've had but very good for the price and well crafted.   Considering how most new places in Charlotte tend to be overpopulated when they first open, this place felt like an undiscovered gem so far so I want you to go try it but then again, not really so I can go whenever I'd like. That's how good it was..."}
{"text":"Appearance: Haymaker is in an amazing location in Uptown Charlotte right under a new apartment complex across from Romare Bearden Park. Upon entry, it's pretty open with high ceilings and nice hanging light fixtures. You are greeted by the host/hostess. Overall, an \"uppity\" and upscale vibe.   Food: it's a bit overpriced and has a lot more to be desired in relation to the portion size. We got the charcuterie boards, meat and cheese (they were priced separately which was a bit odd), and were severely expensive and not that much of a selection; the roasted asparagus (a bit over cooked); the farro dish; dirty martini. The food was good but had more to be desired.   Service: The service, plus the food, is why it gets three stars. First off, we sat at our table for about 10-15 mins before we were greeted but get this, we had to literally \"YELP (yell)\" @ the waiter to get his attention. He then said that he was busy helping the table of ladies. I told him that we are in his section and need to be served as well. We are just as important. He then gave us a bit of attention throughout the service but it was less than mediocre in general. It really put a damper on my experience.   All in all, I will probably not to go back unless they lower the prices, up the quantity of food and choices, and get better servers or training."}
{"text":"Since I live about a stone's throw away, the residents in my building (including myself) were chomping at the bit for this place to open. So on opening night (keep in mind that things may have changed since then), a large group of us decided to head downstairs to check it out.    Because we had a large party, four of us decided to share a bunch of small plates.  We ordered the following dishes:   - Cornmeal hushpuppies ($6): These golden brown hushpuppies were delicious! They were paired with tomato jam (good flavor), but the ratio of hushpuppies to jam needed to be better balanced.  I would love to see honey butter or a more savory jam (e.g. tomato bacon jam) offered in addition to the current offering.     - Mac & cheese ($8): This is not your Paula Dean's type of recipe. It was much creamier/milkier (almost soup like) than expected, and lacked strong flavor. This was my least favorite dish. Maybe something was off though on the first night?? - Roasted carrots ($8): Simple, yet flavorful.  - Charred broccolini ($10): Hands down, everyone's favorite dish!  - NC shrimp and grits ($15) - Whipped Ricotta Cheesecake ($8): Fluffy and light, and the tangy and zesty lemon curd was a perfect topping.  - Chocolate Brownie Torte ($8): Interesting combination of flavors which made each bite very tasty!  I loved the bourbon pecan ice cream!!!!   The staff was so friendly and accommodating, especially considering the size of our party.  I love that Haymaker utilizes ingredients that are indigenous to the area and focuses on sustainably sourced seafood and meats. I applaud Chef Dissen for bringing a true farm-to-table restaurant to Uptown Charlotte.  They will be offering outdoor dining (aka DOG FRIENDLY) soon!   Side note: I have seen many people walk up to the restaurant and attempt to open the door, only to find out that Haymaker isn't open.  So here are the hours of operation (as of right now): M-F (Breakfast 7a-1030a; Lunch 11a-230p; Dinner 5p-11p) Sat-Sun (Brunch ***Closed until 4/21***; Dinner 5p-11p)"}
{"text":"So, this restaurant just opened in Charlotte. 3 weeks to be exact. It is a really nice upscale restaurant. But the dress code is pretty casual. We were greeted by friendly staff who sat us at a high top. The waiter came over and explained the menu to us. Everything is Farm to Table. I ordered the southern shade drink. It was very strong but really good. They did not hold back on the alcohol.   I really appreciate the fact that they brought all of our food out at the same time. I was really impressed that our waiter explained each plate to us.   We ordered the pork belly, the macaroni and cheese, and the shrimp and grits. Let me just tell you, the food was amazing! I can't remember the last time I give someone all fives on Yelp but everything from the presentation to our waiter to the drinks to the food was nothing short of amazing. We will definitely be back very soon. The food is a little pricey but it is worth it! If you are looking for a small plate and a great drink, this is the place to be."}
{"text":"Food is mediocre with minimal or weird flavor. Good wine/drinks selection with cool decor. All in, would return for a cocktail but never again for dinner."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with work friends. Location is nice as well as decor. Menu very limited. I had burger which was ok. Other's meals were small and ok as well. Looks like they have a nice bar and drink selections but probably won't go again for a meal"}
{"text":"I have been anxiously awaiting the open of Haymaker and it did not disappoint. Hints of Asheville's The Market Place restaurant are evident in the incredibly fresh & flavorful farm to table food and 2 story layout but Haymaker is definitely the chic & contemporary sister restaurant.   I dined here in the first week of opening and was pleasantly surprised by how well trained the staff were in the first few days. Timing of the meal was perfect and our waitress had tried every dish on the menu and provided recommendations. We started with the cheese plate and enjoyed trying many NC local cheeses as well as an in-house made pimento cheese. Definitely try a cocktail! These aren't your typical overly sweet concoctions but instead flavored to showcase/enhance the liquor in the drinks.  Ordered the shrimp and grits as my entree (also one of my favorites at The Market Place) and it was flavorful without being too rich. Tried the fresh fish and would recommend as well.   Dined here again with a larger group a few weeks later and still found the staff and hospitality to be top notch. The perfect place to grab a drink & bite with a date or group. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"TL;DR - Trendy spot where you can fill up on small plates and grab a cocktail without breaking the bank  Food - 3.75/4 - The food is Southern/American cuisine, which has a lot of easy to like foods that are usually \"good\" even when not done well.  I thought 3 of the 4 dishes my wife and I ranged from 'solid' to 'exceptional'.  We started with an order of the hushpuppies. They were seasoned well, super crunchy on the outside, and soft on the inside.  The flavored butter it came with was a highlight.  Next thing we got was there take on mac & cheese.  I almost never get mac & cheese at a place, mostly out of spite from people telling me, \"You have to go to ____ restaurant, the ____ mac and cheese is SOOO good.\"  Well, of course, when you take a delicious, easy-to-like food and add another delicious easy-to-like food (pulled pork, lobster, crab, etc.), of course you're going to enjoy it.  What I liked about Haymaker's mac & cheese was how strong it was. The cheese they use is super sharp and pungent.  Definitely enjoyed best in small bites.  I'm not sure what the green stuff on top was, but I enjoyed it.  Drinks - 4/5 - Had a couple of cocktails and they will tasty and well made.  Service - 4/5 - This place is new, but the staff worked like a well-oiled machine.  Value - 4/5 - I'd say pricing was fair.  It's not a deal, but certainly did not feel ripped off."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! Lunch today with dear friends and we couldn't ask for a better experience. The restaurant is gorgeous - so full of light, great colors and light fixtures, beautiful seating. Our server was smart, funny, efficient and helpful! The food came out quickly. We started with the hush puppies and jalapeño butter which were so good we got two servings! Those will be a perfect pre-Panther game/Knights game snack with a beer! Our table ordered the Fried Green Tomato BLT, the burger, two sirloin salads and pork bellies. Everyone loved their meals. Great portion sizes. There was a great lunch crowd but it was never loud. Just an all around great first experience! Cannot wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Fried Green Tomato BLT to go at lunch.  The restaurant was beautiful and the staff very nice.  I opened my box at my office to a good looking sandwich and overcooked small portion of chips.  Luckily there wasn't many because I was barely able to eat them with the amount of salt!  The sandwich was okay.  It little greasy with not alot of bacon and not hot cheese.  With all of the good reveiws I might try again, but not during lunch hours."}
{"text":"New and sexy spot overlooking Romare Bearden Park. Had lunch and really enjoyed it. Beautiful atmosphere, friendly staff, although our waiter was a bit timid.   The hush puppies are light, sweet and savory. Really great treat.   Try the Fried green tomato BLT with pimento cheese. Delicious. So was the catfish and the flank steak salad. We all really enjoyed the food preparations.   Can't wait to try this spot for dinner!"}
{"text":"Came here tonight for a cocktail after spending some time at the baseball game. We wanted to warm up because it was so cold and windy out.  We walked through the double doors and immediately saw the large bar. It's a beautiful space. Lots of grey, wood, copper, and brown leather. We sat in the bar area there were two-three round wood tables with beautiful (and comfortable) leather chairs. We perused the cocktail list and all decided on the Harvest Spritz: aperol, amaro montenegro, cava, orange peel. It was a beautiful brightly colored cocktail.  I could see the bartender making the drink from the bar and he was very exacting and took his time with each drink.   The service was good. The bartender who made the drinks, delivered them himself and was really nice and attentive.   We had to wait some time to get our check after we asked the waiter - once they finally arrived he was apologetic that they took so long.   I will re-review once I've had a chance to try the food... but so far, impressed!"}
{"text":"Great name, great location, nice space. Good first impression walking in, hostess immediately sat us at our reservation time. We waited a few min before a waiter came by and told us to wait for our actual waitress? There were 4 tables in the total section so I'm not sure how they were so busy? Our waitress made it a point to review the menu with us and tell us that \"chef checks the produce every morning and then the menu is made.\" The menu was the exact same it's been online and on their website since they've opened, and she didn't mention any daily specials that would imply a daily menu change?   My wife and I weren't super hungry, before our waitress came we had decided on charcuterie and a few small plates. When we told her of our menu choices, she almost pressured us into ordering more as if what we were getting wasn't going to be enough money wise to make it worth her while to be our server. She was extremely condescending, she judged us because we didn't order multiple courses etc, however was shocked and almost flustered when we ordered the most expensive champagne bottle on the menu, 2-3 rounds of cocktails, and multiple desserts. I HATE when a server thinks they can treat you like crap because they think you won't spend enough money for them to get a good tip.  Food: we had the charcuterie board, it was ok, a runner dropped it off, nobody explained what each item was until it was sitting on our table for a good 5-10 minutes. We had the hush puppies which were good, the jalapeño sorghum butter was amazing. The roasted carrots were a little too mushy for my taste, I expected a little bit of a bite, but the consistency was more like a boiled carrot. The carrots weren't peeled or trimmed, I'm assuming to go with a rustic farm to table vibe, but a few of them didn't even look completely clean. The asparagus with the egg on top was interesting, nothing special? The fingerling potatoes were deep fat fried, with an aioli that didn't really taste of anything. For dessert, we had the lemon ricotta cheesecake, which tasted super eggy and not really of lemon or ricotta. The strawberry shortcake dessert, the strawberry topping had so much sugar in it it literally tasted like a strawberry daiquiri.   Cocktails: my wife liked the gin and green chartreuse drink, it was refreshing. I had a Benton's old fashioned that didn't really have any sort of bacon or bacon taste, just like a liquid smoke aftertaste. We also had some standard cocktails (Moscow mule, etc), they were fine, but nothing special for the cost. The champagne bottle we had was good, their sparkling wine choice was nothing special, and the bottle itself wasn't even really cold.   All in all, I'd probably come back for a drink and some hush puppies. I think whatever staffing issues other reviews have mentioned definitely applied to us as well. I really didn't appreciate being made to feel cheap or less than, especially since we ended up leaving having spent about $300 for 2 people. In uptown Charlotte. On a weeknight."}
{"text":"Came here for a Saturday brunch. We had reserved a table for 10 ahead of time, as we expected the place to be bustling, but it was almost empty. We didn't let this deter us, we all ordered drinks (I got a Bloody Mary - asked for it to be spicy and all they had was Frank's red hot to spice it up, it was really good though, so I'm not complaining)  On to the service, our server was really friendly. Food and drinks took a while to arrive, which was a disappointment considering the place was virtually empty.  Food: everyone enjoyed their food, portions are small for the price. Everyone needed to order side dishes once the entrees arrived. The grits were amazing! Highly recommend.   All things considered, I may return some time, but a $70+ brunch bill (with one drink a piece) for two people is a little more than I'd like to spend frequently."}
{"text":"Hush puppies were great. Service wAs great. The old fashioned I had didn't taste particularly amazing( supposedly bacon infused??)"}
{"text":"I'm so excited and thankful we have this Diamond in Charlotte- finally, finally more choices with teams that understand food creations. Loved every single thing we had. Craft cocktails, pickled veggies, ahi chips, beets, mushroom toast, pork belly and shrimp and grits. All new flavors and additions to these dishes. Their additions of flavors and spices - on point. Loved the staff Nathan, Selwyn and Adam never missed a beat. Too full to have dessert but..... don't miss out on this pastry chef."}
{"text":"We finally tried Haymaker for dinner and it was great!  We asked our waiter for his favorites- and he steered us right. We got mushroom toast and hushpuppies to start. We loved both! We also wanted to try the homemade bread, which a lot of people got, but will try it next time. The charcuterie boards coming out of the kitchen also looked amazing. We also got carrots and the NC Grouper which were good, but we loved the starters more. You could definitely make a meal of the small plates alone (which is what we would recommend!) We got the pineapple tart for dessert, which was also great. It wasn't too sweet, but was a great ending to the meal."}
{"text":"Everything was good but nothing was great. Had the beet salad, pork belly, Mac and cheese and grouper. I probably wouldn't order any of them again. The ambiance and decor is really cool and the drinks were pretty good but wasn't left with the feeling of I have to go back again soon. The bar is the best spot and would go back for a drink again."}
{"text":"5 stars! 5 stars! 5 stars! The farm to table restaurant experience always comes with a high expectation Haymaker does not disappoint. I had the Mac and cheese, pork belly and shrimp and grits and EVERYTHING was delicious and extremely flavorful.   The ambiance is relaxed yet upscale and in the perfect location. They've only been open for 3 weeks but it will be soon because great weather and the foot traffic that will come with the baseball games and other events that will occur in uptown. I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"The best food in Charlotte period. Our group had  the lamb shoulder which was fantastic. The portion was large enough to feed 3-4. The meat was tender and flavored just right . For sides I recommend the Mac and cheese and charred broccoli. The shrimp and grits were also excellent - the best I have had in Charlotte . Will definitely make this a regular dining spot."}
{"text":"Hands down the best meal we've had in Charlotte in years. On par with Kindred in Davidson. The service was outstanding, the food was creative, and the cocktails were amazing. Charlotte atmosphere with an Asheville menu. Tuna Tartare, Mushroom Toast, Roasted Beets, Shrimp a la plancha, Crisp Pork Belly.....and every dessert we tried (3 of them....the Pineapple Coconut Tarte!!!!) were out of this world.  Nathan and Selwyn took great care of us and we even had a great visit from the Front House Manager, Adam, who is passionate about this place. Must try!"}
{"text":"New place with good service and atmosphere. Really good burger and catfish dishes were had by our group. Limited menu but I would come back"}
{"text":"I love the ambiance of the establishment. We arrived an hour earlier than out reservation. The hostess promptly sat us upstairs. I will say our meal took a while to get to us. I couldn't imagine dining with a group larger than two what the wait would be. Over all I'd suggest the quail!"}
{"text":"I was a walk in for lunch the second day the restaurant was open. My mother and I ordered a few things to try and really enjoyed ourselves. I had the best burger I think I have ever had in my life. We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere and awesome food! I had the burger for lunch and it was very good. Also try the Haymaker punch. It's delicious."}
{"text":"Great place! I was worried since it is opening week but the staff and food were flawless. We got the hush puppies (amazing) and meat/cheese plate to start. For dinner, we ordered the fish and lamb, both of which were perfect.  My only negatives: portions on the meat/cheese plate were a bit small. And I wish the menu was a bit bigger; they only have 5 entrees to choose from. But great service and delicious food so I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner before theater. I received a phone call to confirm the reservation. They made sure we had plenty of time to get to the theater. The staff worked as a great team. Excellent bar and awesome food. Plenty of options. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Finally got around to trying Haymaker since their opening a week or so ago.   While having a quick lunch with a friend to get out of the office, we decided on Haymaker locates Uptown with great views of the park. Haymaker has a cute upper level and you can't beat the views of the baseball field so perfect location right on the corner.  The lunch menu is pretty small and basic but a few options for all types of eats. To be a lunch menu the price is a little higher but hey it's Uptown. Ended up starting with the Haymaker Punch which is bourbon based with this refreshing Spring/Summer taste. Ordered the burger which comes with a Potato bun which they were out of so that would have been a bummer if I were eating bread lol. Ordered a few extra pieces of lettuce (healthier option, thank me later) and the meal was great. Ordered my burger medium which was more medium/rare but with time restraints I didn't send back. The burger came with potatoes which was over kill so a healthier option like a side salad substitute would have been great since they have a menu filled with great options.  The service was great and waiters were very attentive. Food came out fast, drinks were made well and again killer views on a wonderful sunny spring day in Charlotte.  Looking for a cute, medium priced venue with great food & views, try Haymaker."}
{"text":"I went here with a large group and while the service and atmosphere was great, the food just wasn't anything special - especially for the price v. Portions. I had the hush puppies (probably the best), the shrimp a la planacha and the mac n cheese and for the price I paid, the portions were really bad and the food wasn't noteworthy. Compared to other similar restaurants in Charlotte this was not a great value or dining experience."}
{"text":"Wowza!  Hot spot, hot food, and hot waiter #Nathan!!!  Hahah.  All jokes aside, this new place has a lot of issue with parking if you arrive before 6pm when valet services begin, so DRIVER BEWARE.  The downstairs area is very open and modern and full of people drinking after a long day of city life.  When we arrived, we were taken upstairs for dining.  I will say, it feels a little like eating in dark loft. I would have probably chosen a lighter color to paint the tons of pipes and wires snaking overhead.  Oh, and there is an odd flushing sound in the pipes about every 15 minutes or so....  not sure what that's about.  Here is why 5 Stars: the menu was phenomenal. We both had vegetarian option and it was full of flavor and creative in presentation.  The cocktails and bubbly we enjoyed were also very delicious and my bestie got a free glass because it was his birthday.  How sweet, right?!  Nathan was our waiter... he was super attentive, very knowlgade about the menu, and smoking hot.  We couldn't have had a more pleasant staff experience.  The guy who carries around the water to refill glasses doesn't let your water glass get any where near empty before he promptly refreshes the glass.  Oh, we had the beets as a small plate... it was AMAZING!  I feel like beets can go terribly wrong, but these were fresh gold and red beets to die for.  The desserts were artistic takes on popular options, and they were worthy of repeating for sure!!  The views out of the tall windows from the bottom floor are amazing, but when the sun is going down and they raise the shades, it almost blinds the diners on the second floor for a few minutes until the sun hides behind the neighboring building.  Small price to pay for an amazing view.  I will most certainly be back, and can't wait to try more cocktails!!"}
{"text":"I go out to eat alone a lot. When I walked into the restaurant the host suggested the bar and I said no because there really wasn't any seats available when on a busy Saturday night. She suggests the a small table in the corner. In which I took, it gave me a very good view of the front of the house bar area was beautiful windows that I could look out at the park. My server was amazing I asked her what was good on the menu she suggested the hush puppies which was an amazing choice. Then I also chose the shrimp and grits with so much flavor nothing dull about it good size shrimp. And I couldn't help but order dessert which she also suggested as well which was brownie.   From this service to the food I had an amazing time I never felt like an outcast by eating by myself. My server there was very attentive and very helpful."}
{"text":"I hate at Haymaker last night for the first time and it was phenomenal. The atmosphere is awesome, the decor is great, and the food didn't disappoint. Our waitress was very attentive and friendly throughout our meal. I had the NC shrimp a la plancha as an appetizer, the Grouper as an entree, and we split then pineapple tart. All were excellent choices and I'd been saving my appetite all day for this meal. I'd highly recommend Haymaker to anyone looking for a delicious farm to table option."}
{"text":"Bar service varies greatly night to night bc if staff. Don't go on Wednesday or Saturday--terrible snarky service. A few good dishes-- dumpling and field greens. Decent red wine selection by the glass."}
{"text":"Good food, limited menu at Haymaker.  Will take some effort to match quality and reputation of sister restaurant in Asheville (which was fabulous Easter weekend dinner).   Only one (of 4) entrees of appeal to me;  I don't eat beef or catfish but I loved the trout.  The beef was good per my husband.  A side of beets wasvery tasty.  Wine list good overall.   Sitting upstairs has quite an annoying characteristic ;  a loud shwishing coming from back corner.  Became comical watching customers seeking out the source.  Our waiter told us it is the employees bathroom.  To which we thought, \"the staff sure does use the bathroom often\".  It sounds like a gas or exhaust venting.   And another quirk ... there is no bathroom upstairs for patrons.  It is a walk down the steep stairs and around the bar to restrooms.   For a space which was a blank slate I think the designers 'tried too hard' and overlooked the simple necessities.   We do like the red outdoor tables and hope to use them soon.  But please NO dogs."}
