{"text":"Went to see my neighbors band to support them and wasn't excepting sleezy 1/2 naked women servers.  Very unclassy. Will.not go again because of the atmosphere and sleezy servers."}
{"text":"The management at this place is terrible.  We reserved a table for the Superbowl but our Hispanic friends from Seattle could not reserve one and were not provided with any reason that made any sense. Obviously racism is alive and well at the Wasted Grain."}
{"text":"Super cool environment, good priced drinks and good food too! Loved that it is a big seahawks bar"}
{"text":"Have to check out Sunday night's at wasted grain! Metal head is awesome!!! It is a guns and roses cover and they are spot on!! Me and the wife had a ball! Bar staff was great!"}
{"text":"This is 100% my Sunday spot to go! They don't have a long line outside. Employees are very nice. There is plenty of space and different areas inside depending on what you're feeling at the moment."}
{"text":"Cool place for happy hour. Nice outside area with a bar, bags and darts. The bartenders are dressed scandalous but not in a good way. Prices are okay"}
{"text":"Wow.  What a disappointment.  Took an hour to get some sandwiches.  Grilled cheese wasn't melted.  Wrong sides delivered with meals.  Bread on one sandwich was moldy.  One sandwich had hair in it.  Server was nice, one waitress for the entire bar is insufficient.  We will never be back."}
{"text":"I had to select one star because it wouldn't let me post my review but this place is a zero star place. Never go here! We paid over $300 for a vip table for my friends birthday. We made arrangements a head of time and let them know how many people we had in our group. The table was way too small for our group. We barely had any room. Later that night we were disrespected and treated horribly. The security guards were extremely rude. They didn't care about our concerns and pushed my friend when we were trying to talk to them. When we asked to speak to a manager we got the run around and got told that he has more important things to do than to talk to us. All they did was hand us his card. We finally got them to get the manager. This was only after mentioning the cops were coming because the security guard pushed my friend. When he finally came out it was around 2:40. He didn't care about what we said and just said sorry. There is no excuse for the way we were treated. They don't care about their customers. The staff is completely unprofessional. If you want a great place to go, this is not it. Save yourself the time and the money."}
{"text":"Came to watch Slightly Right and they were amazing! The next band was also very good. Bartender service was good and the happy hour appetizers decent. However, the bouncers seemed a bit overzealous and definitely on an ego trip."}
{"text":"I had the worst experience here recently due to the management.
Read on to hear why I feel you should not give your business to Wasted Grain.

I went here with a couple of my buddies. I ordered a draft beer and proceeded to the outdoor area. As I was heading out there a guy was walking past me quickly and knocked my beer out of my hand and it broke and spilled all over. I helped by picking the glass up and disposing of it. I tried to be polite and apologized to the guy who bumped me even though I believed it was his fault. As I went back to head back to be with my buddies I was about to wish the guy who bumped me a good night when he said with a snarky attitude \"watch where you are going next time\". I was perturbed by his comment and gave him the bird for a second and started heading back to where my friends were.

Here is where things get ridiculous. Apparently the guy who bumped my drink out of my hand unapologetically and was rude to me was a manager at the club. He followed me and summoned some bouncers. He said I needed to leave and the bouncers grabbed me by the arms and started shoving me towards the exit. I shook them off and told them I could leave without any assistance. They threw me on the ground face first and then proceeded to haul me out of the club. This was very embarrassing as it was my first time ever being thrown out of a club. I will not be returning here unless the owners apologize and at least reprimand the manager. This manager obviously was abusing his power and that is not acceptable."}
{"text":"The worst experience ever. The manager is literally convincing us as we speak to not yelp this. First off, we sat here waiting for 20 minutes and had to grab the server Madison who then looked rush with it not even being busy. Only one table on the outside patio. She took our drink order and then asked who was paying and if we were closing out. My aunt said I'll close my tab but we would like to order food as well. She came back with our drinks and said we have no chicken. We said ok that's fine at the end of our order, she asked for our cards and said do u guys want to close out. I've never been to a restaurant  where I felt like we needed to leave..is this fast food? She then came back with our tabs before our food expecting us to sign the cards..um how are we going to tip on service when we're being pushed out. She took everyone's card and I didn't even have a chance to sign my card . We got our food  which was actually pretty good. To make things worse, the manager came and asked what's wrong why is there no tip. So we explained everything that happened and we told him we would yelp this experience and he said, \"before you do anything crazy are you guys from here?\" We said we were visiting from the bay area but my cousin and his new wife lived here and we would never recommend this place. one of the worst experiences of my life, and we now know why they gave us coupons at the game because  they needed the business. I would give 0 stars. Today's date 3-15-15. Spring training wasn't ruined because  the Giants won!"}
{"text":"Robert is an awesome manager, he goes above and beyond to make guests happy.  I watched the MSU game there Saturday and had one of the best times ever.  The environment was like I was back in Michigan watching a football game, so much green, and everyone having a great time.  If you want an awesome Seahawks or MSU bar go here, they will make you feel like you are back home."}
{"text":"I'm gonna be honest I solely came to this place because of the bacon popcorn. I couldn't help myself I had to try it. Although it's not really set up for dinner per say with the minimal dining areas not intended for groups and the terribly loud mediocre band. But I didn't expect too much. We tried the pigs in a blanket (hard to mess up) but delicious and the poutine fries (delicious but hard to mess up). The flatbread was a different story...pre-packaged frozen pre cooked chicken, gross. The whole thing, stay away. Although it was very slow (about 20-30) people in the whole place including the staff. We were greeted promptly, taken care of well and never ignored perfect steps of service (Thanks Serena you were awesome!) and delicious drinks (I tried the Clyde). Also the popcorn was exactly what I expected bacony, sweet and delicious."}
{"text":"Zero stars...A  group of friends and I reserved a table for $1000 and 40 minutes later it was sold to a bunch of hooligans willing to pay $5000.  Loud obnoxious and horrible customer service.  Go here if you are a masochist and really hate yourself."}
{"text":"I had a wise friend tell me that Wasted Grain was Scottsdale's \"buffet of bars\", offering everything from live music to a rowdy dance club. Boy, was he right! This place wasn't just any buffet, but a Golden Corral of bars. From middle aged ladies jamming out to poorly sung renditions of classic 80's hits, to a DJ spinning a YouTube inspired (or curated) set on the dance floor, you are guaranteed to find the same quality of entertainment as food at your local GC-- a recently sneezed in grade D beef stew."}
{"text":"Best place to stop by on a Wednesday night. Especially for Bass Wednesday. Dope headliners, cheap and affordable drinks. Amazing people and good vibes. Definitely a place to visit during the week. Shout out to Relentless Beats & Bankhead Productions for an spectacular night for the Mad Decent Pre Party."}
{"text":"We we're looking for a place to watch the Buckeyes opening game.   Great service,  they waited on its made sure we were happy turned up the sound so we wouldn't miss a play. They have a good menu, I recommend breakfast burrito. The manager Rob was fantastic great waitresses.   I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"We were trying to have a good time and this was our first stop for drinks and the staff and band were very rude. The band kicked my nephew out for snapchatting them (yes promoting but videoing them) and I was kicked out and told I was not welcomed back because I tried to ask a bouncer why he was kicked out. I have never seen anything like it, from a band or a staff. If the owner would like to discuss further, I can be reached through here."}
{"text":"Excellent venue in downtown Scottsdale, AZ. My friend had his 60th birthday there and he hired the 70s Rock Band Firefall. The guy who did the mixing did a great job. I didn't eat, but the bar was great."}
{"text":"We had a great time. Good food, fair prices drinks and good service. Excited to come back to watch some live music  and Seattle Seahawks games.

Thanks for the hospitality."}
{"text":"Honestly one of my favorite clubs/bars in Old Town. You get a little bit of everything here. Plenty of seating or private tables (I have never had table service here so cannot review about the experience with that). You want live music? Great! They got it! You want an outside area to chill and hang out? Great! They got it! Want some outside games to play? They got it! Club with dancing? They got it! Plenty of TV's with all kinds of different things to watch. The club upstairs is my favorite, DJ is USUALLY great but have been on some off nights with hardly anyone in there and the music was pretty awful. I usually always come here when I want to dance, but if the music isn't good I will leave. 
The bands that play here are ALL amazing, have yet to hear a bad one. Service is always good, bartenders are always really sweet and nice. Have only ran into a couple times where DJ and bouncers were a bit rude to me, but hey, dealing with drunk people all night I'm sure everyone gets on your nerves at some point. Never has a cover or dress code. Have only ate here once so cant vouch for the food too much.
Love it here!"}
{"text":"My friends and I came here on our \"guys' night out\".  This was my favorite place of the whole night.  It is very classy inside with all of the attractive Scottsdale people ready to mingle.  What's great about this place is that they cater to all sorts of people.  The bar when you first walk in is very nice, and is a great area to just hang out.  There are also some oversized games downstairs which we did not use but seemed fun for the singles out to meet others.  Upstairs was an awesome outside deck overlooking old town.  Also upstairs is the nightclub area which we did not go into, but seemed very crowded.

The atmosphere is very nice, and while the drinks are pricey they are large and strong."}
{"text":"The Food was really really good I recommend trying it. Brittany was great waiting on us and she is very out going. I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Worst ever. I ordered chicken fingers waited over an house out side then the bar tender said oops we gave it to someone else inside. My friends then left and still waited another hour for my food. Worst service in all of Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Not a bad place to catch a cover band and get out on the dance floor. Expect a mixed crowd, but plenty of room to roam to a quiet place or hear the music, drinks were reasonable and music was good. Staff was friendly and drinks were good"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite clubs in Scottsdale. I went on a Saturday night with some friends and paid no cover. The wait in line for a drink at the bar was short, even with the crowds. They had a live band on the main stage downstairs. 

Upstairs is an outside deck area that's amazing to get some fresh air. And there's a room with hip hop music on the second floor that's great for dancing. Highly recommend stopping here if you like a good night life."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful for happy hour. Reasonable prices drinks for Old Town and great beers on tap. I'm particularly in favor of this place because they carry Goose Island. 

The service is always great whether I'm there during the day or a Friday and Saturday night. They typically have a live band that night on the main floor then a DJ upstairs. I like that you can get two different vibes from this place.

They have corn hole outside too so it is the place to be!

Ordered the hummus and my friend got the buffalo chicken flat bread. Both were wonderful, great presentation!"}
{"text":"Great young professional atmosphere with good drink specials!"}
{"text":"I was expecting regurgitated Martini Ranch & expected to not be impressed. But I was & I didn't even try the food yet so stay tuned for that. We landed LATE on a Saturday night & the band downstairs & DJ upstairs were in full swing. Unless you came to the now defunct Martini Ranch many times you're not going to see anything of it at all the same. Which is exactly what you hope for in a new place so WTG people! My only negative was not loving the DJ upstairs & not being approached upstairs at an open bar for a refill. But we also didn't stay upstairs longer than 4 songs thanks to the DJ."}
{"text":"So disappointed in Wasted Grain.  Took my teammates from out-of-state to Wasted Grain for dinner on Sat night.  we'd just finished a 36 hour race and were STARVING.  I had eaten here before; food was good and the atmosphere is fun so thought it would be a good place to take them.  We arrived at 6:30.  Food for 5 was served at 7:50; the 6th plate arrived 15 minutes later.  No joke.  Very little acknowledgement from staff that they completely dropped the ball; waitress was nice, and sorry, but then disappeared and we saw her sporadically once she know were weren't too happy, and no one in our party was a jerk on any level.  The manager actually told us , \"the kabobs take longer to cook and throws everything else off.\"  This makes no sense, but he I guess apparently had to say something?  He did offer a few free drinks and to comp the kabobs.  It was completely embarrassing from start to finish, being that I made the dinner spot decision.  Too many solid restaurants in town to have service like this; but i bet they mostly cater to the drinking crowd.  Did i mention it was 6:30 when we got there?  Place was 1/4 full, and no one else was eating.  I didn't know until we left that one of my teammates spoke with the manager, so i'm not sure how the bill ended up; teammate said he took care of it, so i'm not sure if that meant the manager stepped up and comp'd the entire bill (which is what should have happened in the 1st place).  Anyways - disappointed & embarrassed, and don't feel the need to patronize this establishment again.  Should have gone to Social Tap.  No wonder Cold Beers & Cheesburgers, Bottled Blonde, Two Brothers all had a line out the door at 6:30, and this place does not.
also a band coming on at 9 was banging away on the drums.  i get to an extent the need to set up, but banging on the drums at 6:30 was a bit annoying.  Def did not help with the rest of the situation."}
{"text":"Started off our weekend getaway here. We went thinking we'll have one drink and explore out. But this place kept us entertained for hours. We almost missed our dinner reservations. 

The atmosphere is super relaxing and chill. Nice outdoor area as well. The most entertaining part is the prices of drinks. There is an electronic board which adjust the prices according to demand."}
{"text":"I can't really give a in depth review. I only had a few drinks here. I can say the beer is ice cold and it was clean. They have a stock market drink menu. I think it was wicked cool. The prices go up and down based off of what people are buying. And from what I understand it is tied to other bars across the city who use it."}
{"text":"Wasted Grain is one of my favorite modern bars in Scottsdale. They're happy hours are based on this stock system which I thought was pretty cool. They base the prices of drinks on how many get bought in a certain time period. For example if a lot of people buy blue moons they will increase in price and vice versa. Overall the atmosphere in the bar is great. They have live bands on weeknights and weekdays. On weekends they open upstairs and play more party-type music, while downstairs is more chill and relaxed, so there is a place for everyone in the bar whether you want to just enjoy a drink or \"turn-up.\" Overall the few times I've been there have been really fun and I've meet a bunch of very cool people there. Would recommend 100%!"}
{"text":"\"Wasted Grain\" replaced \"Martini Ranch,\" and I'm sure glad it did!

This place is FUN.  We didn't have to wait long to get in, and when we did, they had a band playing that was absolutely amazing.  So much fun.  

If you're not into live music, just head upstairs to unwind on their patio, or check out their upstairs inside area to dance in a more traditional DJ setting.

The only thing that frustrated me is the 30 minutes it took for the staff to find my credit card at the end of the night.  Besides that, everyone was very nice, and I can't wait to return for more fun live music!"}
{"text":"If you're familiar with the area, this took the place of the old Martini Ranch. And boy is it an upgrade! They've done an awesome job renovating the inside and using the space in a smarter way. It's got a full bar inside, with lots of seating, and what looks to be a really big outdoor space as well! I didn't get to go out there since it was 108 degrees and humid and I'm not crazy, but it looked like there was enough space to have a set of bags or some other fun outdoor game. Not sure if they have games out there, but they should. If you're listening, new owner, you should have games on the patio!

I went for happy hour the week after they opened, and only stayed for one glass of wine. I wish I would have tried some food so I could tell you how it was, but I guess I'll just have to go back and order the menu. I must do my due-diligence.

On a side-note, one of my favorite bartenders from The Lodge is working here now! I don't know her name, but she's awesome."}
{"text":"Was here for Super Bowl 2015. Very crowded and lots of Seahawks fans. Was so busy the waitresses had a very hard time staying organized. I'm sure this is a great venue under normal circumstances as this was my first visit. Paid $10 for a cheeseburger from a vendor on the patio which was so so and shared it with a friend."}
{"text":"We started our night here as happy hour place, but he had so much fun we stayed for hours! They have a unique stock exchange happy hour that kept our group entertained. The space is very open  and inviting with lots of TVs to watch the game, and the bartenders were friendly and efficient. They have lots of things to keep you and your friend entertained: corn hole on the patio, a photo booth in the back, great music, and live music at night."}
{"text":"We just moved to Scottsdale from NYC and we were just driving around looking for a cool dinner spot near old Town Scottsdale. Looked cool from outside so we stopped. Drinks were good. Very cool vibe and theme. Beer cheese and hummus apps were great. My chicken kabob dinner was so so. Some of the chicken pieces were still a little uncooked inside so I couldn't eat all of it, and the rice had delicious flavor BUT I could tell it had sat around, I worked in restaurants for years and it was definitely cooked like early in the day and sat around in a pan because it was chewy/gummy how rice gets when reheated and kind of crunchy on the edges from sitting. Tasted good but the quality just wasn't there. Then my husband had asked for his burger medium rare. He cut it in half and it was literally a hockey puck. Charred at the edges and dark gray through the center...literally extra well done. We sent it back and the next one came out in like 5 minutes...he cut that one in half and it was medium on the verge of medium well. Still not how he likes it but he works in a restaurant and he said he would never send food back twice. So he ate half ...and as soon as he was done he went to the bathroom and got sick. They must use cheap shitty quality meat. I'm really pissed we took our out of town friends here who were visiting this week and spent over 100$ for a meal that was ehhh and made my husband sick..I'd go back to hang at the bar and maybe snack on some apps but that would be it."}
{"text":"The only reason I am giving 2 stars is because they have 5 star entertainment there. You get 10% off your tab for checking in on Yelp but they wont give it to you. The staff is rude. I had to convince secruity that I was going to the bar the to close my tab. The DJ came on at 1:20 and they kick everyone out of the bar at 1:30. I closed my tab finally and my discount was declined. I won't be back. I'll go see that band at a different, more customer friendly venue."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, live music, delicious food and Jack Daniels. Doesn't get any better!"}
{"text":"Very cool atmosphere. Lounge seating high top seating, huge patio with full bar, bean bag toss, and darts.  Great place for a quick drink after work, and for the younger generation, late nights tearing it up."}
{"text":"We went with a group for Turkey Tuesday.  Although there were only a handful of patrons at the bar, we seemed to throw the one server and one bartender into disarray.
Most of the people in our group wished we had gone somewhere else.  The food was limited and disappointing.  For example, the $10 pizza seemed to consist of a square shaped tortilla with some cheese and tomatoes.  
I felt sorry for the staff there.  Their tips must be on the low side with so few customers.
Fortunately, on Mill Ave there are so many great places that we were able to migrate to a better venue.
I hope that the Wasted Grain is Scottsdale is better!!"}
{"text":"The female bartender with black hair who was covered in tattoos was so unbelievably rude and unprofessional and would be better suited to work somewhere that does not require a personality or any skill."}
{"text":"A visit to see the kickoff of Cardinals vs Greenbay and the beer was great but the wings--not so much and we were really counting on great wings for the game. Interesting seating and layout, but bathrooms were not clean. Not just a place for the youngsters. Music choices were great, sort of too loud for ball game conversation though."}
{"text":"No cover charge for UFC 202 and there were actually a few places to stand and watch the fight, but otherwise the place was pretty crowded with the usual 20 something Scottsdale crowd. The beers are only $4, but a shot of jack was $8. It worked out well for all involved, except Diaz, but probably should have been a draw."}
{"text":"Martini Ranch has become Wasted Grain after some remodeling. I came on a Saturday night and the line was not long and ladies got in for free. The front men were nice and friendly. Once in, the 1st level has the stage which housed a bar and live rock band for the night which covered 80's to contemporary rock and pop music. If you continue straight through to the corridor there is a patio which has darts, corn hole, the bathrooms and stairs to the right to get to the 2nd level. Take the stairs up, then walk across the rooftop patio which has some seating and you will finally reach the club. 

The 2nd level houses a small indoor dance club very similar to Smashboxx. The DJ played a mix of hip hop and EDM and the bar is pretty large so you don't have to fight much to get a hold of a bartender. The VIP booths surround the dance floor and the light effects are mediocre. 

There's another set of stairs right in front of the dance club so you don't have to go all the way around to the initial ones you took to get there. These lead straight to the bathroom from the 2nd floor down to the 1st. 

The age group and ethnic mix was extraordinarily diverse. Probably the most mixed group at a bar or club I've ever seen, even more so than Las Vegas. Ages ranged  equally from the 20's to the 60's and a fairly equal number of men and women as well. 

Overall, the layout is interesting and there's some free seating as well as games to play. Ideally, this isn't where I'd like to spend my Saturday night, I'd rather be at The Mint or INTL. I would take relatives visiting Arizona, or friends that just want to \"chill\" and not party, here, or even a date - that would be fun. But if I really want to have a good time, I want to hit a proper dance club with my friends. But that's just me. This place isn't for everyone but it does have a lot to offer."}
{"text":"Yes the wife and I love coming here.  Generally on a Saturday night so we can get our drink on which results in my crazy ability to suddenly become a dancing machine.  But I noticed there are stages to my body alcohol content level and my dance moves.
Stage 1.  (The Kevin Bacon). 2+ beers.  A couple beers in my feet start twitching and I get the sudden urge to hit the dance floor.  Footloose just got unleashed!  People are eyeballing but I tell myself they are just jealous.
Stage 2.  (The John Travolta). 4+ beers.  Yeah I'm feeling the Saturday Night Fever kicking in hard.  I can't be stopped.  The people previously staring are now trying to compete!  It's on!
Stage 3.  (The Patrick Swayze).  7-8 beers.  Sweat, bodies bumping, my wife getting me all hot and bothered and now I'm Dirty Dancing to Hip Hop, 90's Pop!????  Wtf!  I'm losing my groove but can't figure it out!  
Stage 4.  (Back to Old John Travolta). ???  Beers.  At this point I'm trying to Stay Alive.  My body is not in coordination with my mind and I'm doing some crazy moves I may or may not realize are happening.  I didn't fall!  I'm inspecting the dance floor people!

Ok back to Wasted Grain.  Love the live bands as they hit our genre and it's one of our favorite places in Scottsdale.  Lively crowd, service is uh, well we love to dance and they have a younger, hipper club upstairs which guess what?  I will get groovy up there as well but that is whole other story.  Plenty of tables for seating.  Multiple bars, outdoor relaxation area and not far from public parking or a parking garage.  When the bands break, we head down the street and check the other locales.  Either way, for our kid free Saturday fun, we love coming here.  Plus the bouncers are actually friendly and understand humor."}
{"text":"Fun bar, great for happy hours, food is surprisingly yummy and the staff is always a blast. I am a huge fan of rated grain because it's a one size fits all type of place; you want to rage you go upstairs to the 100 proof lounge and get your groove on, you want live music you hang in the downstairs bar and if you want to enjoy the fabulous Arizona weather they have a huge outdoor space that is even dog friendly. You cannot go wrong with a day or night at wasted!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place! It's not as \"fancy\" as other night clubs in Old Town, but it's definitely a hidden gem. I celebrated my 21st birthday here and had a table with bottle service and the sweetest bottle girl thanks to Ken Mooso. He DJs there on Friday nights and is great! Super awesome and down to Earth guy with a stacked playlist. Love this place for a quick drink after work during the week, or a wild weekend on the town. Nothing but good vibes."}
{"text":"Vodka REDBULL for $10 dollars, but beer is 4.50 really? This place is overrated for a Sunday night! Let's go to Applebee's instead!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere , dj tossing down tunes between plays of game are the only reason I have this place 2 stars . the wife and I sat at a table for 15 minute and the waitress passed us up Multiple times. 2 dudes came in sat down. Within 1 minute she was serving them. We ended up going to the main bar for next 2 rounds. Definitely won't be back and won't recommend. I despise places that provide selective service"}
{"text":"Just awesome dancing to live music. Huge bar. Great menu. Lots of choices. Food and beer. Staff was very nice helpfull."}
{"text":"When the bouncer puts your friend in a chokehold upon departure 50 yards from the bar, it truly does put a damper on the end of the night. Same man made rude comments one female in our group upon entry to our company holiday party and harassed a friend smoking outside as well. Please consider changing security services; they're likely a liability (and reputation) risk for your business. Every time I've come here we've had a BLAST inside with the timely service and awesome live music and, heck, I met my bf here two years ago, which is why I'm giving two stars."}
{"text":"I love this place! They have a fantastic array of beers and lots of great games to play. Great for friends or a holiday party. Often times they also have live entertainment and you can get a table but it is not necessary."}
{"text":"This place actually sucks. The people that work here are jerks and it's never fun. Do not come here..like seriously so many better bars in Scottsdale!!"}
{"text":"Still the closest bar to where I live where everyone knows who you are and my beer is at my fingertips before I even get to the bar.  I am sure to find people I know here in some form or another.  If not, this is a great place to chill for sporting events or rock out on Sunday to whatever garbage/industrial punk rock group they have playing. 

Food is also very good here as well.  Congrats to the remake of the menu.  Perfect!

Gotta check it out at least once.  If it's not for you,  you might be in the wrong part of Scottsdale altogether!

Also the bartender in the back, goes by Mckenzie, is one of the best bartenders I have ever had the privilege of being served by."}
{"text":"Went here this past Saturday night 3/25/17. We had a blast. There was a live cover band \"Smashed\", they were awesome and got everyone involved and dancing. They did covers of wide variety of music. There was a good mix of people. There was no cover and the line outside moved pretty fast. We only drink beer which is reasonably priced. We did not order any food. The bartender seem nice enough."}
{"text":"So my wife and went to your establishment tonight and had a great time till we got our bill.... when we asked for our tab our bartender snapped at us and gave us so much attitude that I will never come here again... she got mad because she heard us talking about our tab, the only reason we talked about it was because we had 2 creepy guys follow us from 3 different bars, trying to order drinks on our tab so we wanted to make sure their drinks were not on our tab... needless to say this girl blew up on us for no reason, getting mad because we only ordered 3 drinks,it was 1:30 in the morning by the way.....so  we wanted to make sure our tab was right, I work in a high pace bar in North scottsdale called the village tavern and if I acted like that and treated a guest in this manner I would have been fired... I felt so disrespected in this place I will never go back, nor in courage others to go there.. don't come to this place the bartenders aweful"}
{"text":"I have been to wasted grain a few times but my most favorite and memorable was when I came here on fight night 3 months ago. My girl friend, her boyfriend & I came to watch the fight and grab a few drinks and we ended up getting bottle service for ourselves at a table. We ordered 2 bottles of rosé & some food to snack on. At first I was skeptical but ended up feeling very pleased with our experience! I do not remember our girl's name (wish I did, she was a brunette, and we sat at the very left table when facing the TVs- doubt that helps but fingers crossed because she deserves praise!) basically she was awesome! Not only was she attentive but she was extremely friendly & vibed very well with us females! It's not very often I have an experience like this especially in old town so we were surprised & so grateful! Vibes over everything. Good job Wasted Grain for employing genuine workers & not just any attractive human."}
{"text":"By Vickie Sobberi
Love this place, good staff, eats and spirits. Wonderful crowd. Will come back again!"}
{"text":"I wanted to share my experience I had recently at Wasted Grain. I would first like to voice how nice it is to find a great place to hang out on Saturdays that is not \"super Scottsdale\". There are many different areas to accommodate what you would like to do. Including a dance club up stairs. 

While there for a Bachelorette Party I left a stack of IDs and credit cards on the table with the girls when I went to used the restroom. When I got back it was apparent the table was bused and the cards were missing. I went to the bar and the bartender directed me to the security up front. I told them and they immediately started talking to each other in the ear phones. Security checked with all the food runners and bussers with no avail. They asked me to write down the cards and names becuase they were going to check the tapes to find them. Wow...so nice. I went back to the table and asked the girls if they saw the cards and one newly arrived sober girls had picked them up for safe keeping. Sweet! I found a member of the security team to tell them we found them and shortly after head of security came to check with me to make sure I found them all. Great service. Very pleased!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places! I love the music, layout, drinks, everything! The management is very nice too. I lost my phone there, and the manager, Robert made sure to follow up with me when he found it! I only wish there was a Wasted Grain on the West side! Come guys, expand! We need you over there!!:):)"}
{"text":"Big space, used to be Martini Ranch.  I love the outdoor big beer pong set up, so much fun when you are with a big group and just trying to get a little day drinking on.  Martini Ranch was terrible, this is such an upgrade.  Much more laid back vibe, great to watch sports in, and great food.  Most places in old town can be very pretentious with huge lines but I have never experienced that the handful of times that I have been here.  My only fear is that this place won't last because so many bars in old town come and go :("}
{"text":"just stopped by for a beer, liked the place will return in the future to see a band sometime"}
{"text":"We stopped in this weekend to enjoy the very pet friendly patio on a beautiful day with some beer/cider.  We also enjoyed an order of pretzel sticks - so tasty!  The bar is huge, the staff is amazing (they couldn't have been more welcoming to our dog) and the food/drink selection was extensive.  I would definitely come back to watch football and drink beer - seems like a really great place all the time!"}
{"text":"We stopped in last night for a drink and had a great experience - relaxed vibe, great bartender, amazing happy hour that goes from 4-9pm ($4 pints, $5 flatbreads and various other food) and a lot of TV's to watch sports.  Definitely worth a stop while visiting Tempe!"}
{"text":"If I'm going to go into Old Town, and I'm not in a divey mood (or I have a diverse crowd with me), Wasted Grain is my first choice! The place is distinctly divided into three separate sections.

Section 1 - Live music, front of the house. This area is where the bands perform, my favorite of which is called \"Smashed\". They do a lot of 80's-00's stuff, and everyone enjoys it! Drinks are pretty reasonable for Old Town, and if you're not an asshole to the staff, they'll get to you pretty quickly. There's some dancing, but plenty of tables to pop down at, should you prefer to sit and watch.

Section 2 - Outdoor patio. Downstairs, the outdoor patio is much like the front of the house. Live music permeates the area, but with less volume. You can step out here for a more casual experience, if you'd like to get out of the mix for a few. If you're looking for a conversation spot, the upstairs patio is ideal. When it's cool, there are heaters and it makes for a mellow middle ground between the live music and the 100 proof lounge. (Note: Loads of smokers up here.)

Section 3 - The 100 proof lounge. This area is upstairs, across the sitting area/patio from the live music venue, and it's a PARTY. The lounge is a lot like the other clubs in Scottsdale, complete with it's own bar, DJ and go go dancers. I've had mixed experiences up here, ranging from a fun time dancing to getting groped on my way to the bathroom. (NOT cool.) Generally, if I'm in this kind of mood, I've left WG and ventured further into Old Town, but it is cool to have everything in one place.

Overall, it's one of the better Old Town spots, purely because of the diversity it offers. When three girls want to do shots party their faces off, two want to get beers and see the band, and one wants to cry into her Cosmo to you on a quiet patio about how shitty her (insert ANYTHING here) is, you don't have to split up the party! There's a venue for everyone within the one place, and once you're all on the same level, you can venture further into Old Town.

Also, their gin and tonic with mint is great. Plus, Market Crash Mondays - it's a stock market for your drinks! My advice? Hedge your risk. Buy 3 of whatever you want! ;)"}
{"text":"Had the chicken Caesar salad.....big enough for an entire meal. The chicken is flavored great! Almost a black pepper after taste. Tasty! Also had the flatbread. Great sauce. I am particular about red sauces. They nailed it. Yum!"}
{"text":"So, I ordered from this place through GrubHub.  GrubHub didn't bother to call and tell me that they had canceled the order. It would seem they had called to try to confirm the order, and nobody at the restaurant answered the phone. So, Yeah, they just canceled the order. Already frustrated with GrubHub as it is, I just called the Wasted Grain, and spoke with the manager Robert, and he told me if I could come in to pick the food up, he would pay for it.  When I went to pick it up, he wouldn't let me give him any money for it, not even a tip. Needless to say, the food was amazing. I will definitely go back, and I'll bring friends. This is the way to treat customers. This is the way to get repeat business. Excellent example of customer service, Richard!"}
{"text":"Wasted Grain is such a cool atmosphere! I go there a lot in the fall due to the Arkansas watch parties being held there. They are always very accomodating to our Hog-calling crowd. They have plenty of big screen tvs, which makes it perfect for watching games. The manager Robert is helpful and the first time there he gave me his business card so that I could text ahead of time to get a table for the game. Another time a bouncer held an umbrella and escorted me to the bathroom because it was pouring. Their service is on point in my experience.

In addition to the watch parties, I have also gone on weekend nights. The thing I really enjoy about Wasted Grain is that there are a couple of different vibes all in one. If you want a band, stay downstairs for a good time. If you want to chill out and play lawn games, go outside and play a round of lawn jenga. If you want a more upbeat vibe, go dance your ass off upstairs. There's a little bit of everything so you can find something for everyone in your group. If you're hungry, pull up a seat and take a peek at the delicious menu. I've had several items on it throughout my visits and have never been disappointed. All in all, it's a great time and I'd definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Very cool spot. I used to live in Scottsdale about 5 years ago when this was some crappy club, and now it's a very cool sports bar and the perfect place to watch a Michigan State game. I am not a MSU fan, but happened to be walking by during a big game and the whole place was filled with Sparty fans. They even had a guy come over the speaker system with a \"Go Green, Go White\" chant for a lot of the big plays. 

We just had drinks, but food looked good too. Indoor and outdoor space, all of which has good viewing areas for the game. Nice addition to old town."}
{"text":"Place is great for watching a game! Great service, food is good, especially for a \"bar\", and they probably have the Bestfriend Bloody Mary I have ever seen!"}
{"text":"Great place. Nice interior and good staff.  The food was pretty good and they have good drinks. Not much more you can ask of a bar."}
{"text":"Really like this place, Nico one of the guys who works here is the nicest guy ever! Also bartenders here are fast, and the place is always really nice and clean even during a packed night! No entry fee to get in even with a full dance floor upstairs though its a bit too loud sometimes, as well as a stage where sometimes you can see great performers perform for free! I love the wasted grain and its one of the coolest places to hang out during the weekends!"}
{"text":"I should preface this by saying my review is based entirely on Seahawks game day experiences here at Wasted Grain the official bar of the Scottsdale Seahawkers. The reason I say this is I am looking at this through the lense of being at a jammed packed bar that is trying to handle people who roam around and order food and drinks at a rapid pace.

That said they handle the events as well as any bar I have ever seen if not better. Service is usually prompt and polite with drinks getting refreshed when needed. The food is not spectacular but it is pretty solid. Somewhat disappointed to see that this year they have cut down the menu to a game day specific short list. It still has some good stuff but I liked having all the options. I am guessing it was tough to get things out quickly that way although I usually thought times matched what I expected based on how busy they were.

I was here for numerous games last season and the super bowl and thought they did a great job every time and look forward to more games this season."}
{"text":"Adding to my review below... Their music is 100% of the time.... Absolutely horrible . My ears are bleeding"}
{"text":"I hadn't been to this venue since it was Margarita Rocks I believe?  It appears as though they did a fair amount of remodeling before changing over to Wasted Grain, but for the most part the layout and overall vibe seemed to be about the same.

I stopped in here for my boys Bday party the other night since he had a table by the DJ booth upstairs in the back area of the venu and it was cool - decent music - so/so crowd, but we had fun at the table area although it was really hard to be able to talk to each other since the music was so loud at the table near the DJ.  

I would probably never want this precise table again since it's no fun to have to yell into your friends ears whenever you want to say anything.  

The staff here seemed pretty decent, but overall the whole experience was just okay/average for me.  I can't really think of anything major to complain about, but at the same time I don't have anything exceptional to say about this venue.  I only noticed a few major upgrades since it was another place - more TV's added and they cleaned things up slightly, so it's a bit more upscale currently.  I definitely like the upgrades over the very grungy feeling I used to get in here.  

When we did grab a few drinks @ the bar at one point it did seem like drinks were rather expensive here, but oh well - it is what is is ;)  it is one of the larger venues in old town, so it's a cool spot to check out and bounce around in between all the rooms and the outdoor patio areas.  If you are around it would be worth checking out, but don't have set your expectations too high if you know what I mean ;)"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite stops after work for happy hour. They have a great atmosphere, nice selection of very cold beers (usually come out with icicles), and the food is at a great price during happy hour. I recommend the buffalo chicken flatbread."}
{"text":"Great happy hour spot right after work. Turns into more of a typical bar at night but the live music is a cool change. They had a band playing when we were there. Drinks are average price and food is pretty good."}
{"text":"This place is okay. Granted- I only went on a Sunday for a Seahawks game. First of all: we are not the \"Seahawkers.\" That must be a bandwagon term created by a bandwagon club. The food was okay. The service was GREAT. However, I think we'll be sticking to Junkie/Bottled Blonde."}
{"text":"The patio area is nice and generally the music is good.  Good atmosphere.  There is no men's room - just a locking unisex bathroom with one stall.  The women's bathroom has plenty of stalls but you can't use them because the place is like an oven and super uncomfortable.  I know this from personal experience  even though I should not be in the women's room.  Anyway, more about the women's bathroom: it's awful.  Truly.  It feels like I'm being baked in an oven but the difference is that I can leave if I want, but not really because you are in there for a reason  (see, auschwitz.  Worse though)"}
{"text":"Welcome to the scene Wasted Grain! Our newest bar/club has easily joined into the nightlife of Old Town with multiple bars inside and outside on the patio, lots of TVs, a large selection of drink and food items and a large dance floor on the second story.

  This place is huge with tons of space! The first floor, including the patio, seem to be more of the bar with the second floor being more of the nightlife club spot. Probably one of the largest bars in old town now, close to the size of whiskey row. There's a really great atmosphere and decor throughout and the food looks great! If only they didn't open till 3pm, it would be a good place for lunch too"}
{"text":"The best things about Scottsdale are here. Great people,plentiful booze choices, and beautiful waitstaff. One of the only venues to have live music that isn't uhh tiss uhh tiss uhh tiss. However, they do have that upstairs if you want. Something for everyone!"}
{"text":"I had never heard of this place but Alex wanted to stop in for a moment... The bartender was not friendly at all, really odd and gave no service which is surprising since the place is dead which earned her absolutely no tip at all from us. 

We bailed since getting anything else to drink was nearly impossible so we paid the bill and blew that joint... 

Nice looking place inside, but dead and bad service....

PS: the bouncers were cool though...."}
{"text":"This place is in the old Martini Ranch location. It is still huge and during this weekday before Thanksgiving, it was rather quiet, which was nice for our group. 

the happy hour is kinda like a stock market....the drinks are priced based on demand. So being thrifty, i opted for the lower priced beers. I didn't eat but some of the others in our group did and they seemed to enjoy their food. 

service was always on top of things, filling water glasses and beers consistently. our server was friendly and prompt, and even separated the checks...always a plus, even for a large group."}
{"text":"5 stars for EDDIE at the bar!!! If you're looking for a local spot with great service, this is your place!! Many of the employees from the galleria building across the street come here every Friday for happy hour."}
{"text":"The venue was excellent. The band was over the top. Clientele very accommodating. The wait staff was attentive, and talented. We will be back. Even as some of the oldest people in there."}
{"text":"Wow.  Where to start.  First, on a very cold night out, they all the windows open.  It was freezing inside. Second, the seating.  They have several tables and chairs surrounding the dance floor, which they remove just prior to the music beginning.  While there is nothing wrong with that practice, they should ensure that patrons are aware this is occurring.  If folks get there early to get a good seat, only to have it taken away from them, that could be an issue. Thankfully, it wasn't for us, but still disarming to have to move. Third, the first time we got up to dance, leaving our coats on the chairs, the drinks we had just started drinking disappeared while on the dance floor. The couple sitting across from us, mentioned this to our server prior to us getting back and she replaced the drinks, which brings us to #4: she charged us for the new drinks as well as the almost full drinks which were removed. Fifth, when I pointed this out to her, she gave a bogus excuse that the drinks were almost empty and it was standard practice to remove them. Not to mention the drinks weren't almost empty, we had barely begun drinking them. Now, they did remove the drinks from the bill, but not without discussion. 

Now, on the other hand, the waitress was very attentive, while not being intrusive.  And the band, Rock Lobster was simply amazing."}
{"text":"The general manager can send me a message on here if they plan on reaching out. My review is self explanatory and I do not plan to get into further arguments with this establishment."}
{"text":"Went here looking forward to Metalhead because lately the music and the DJ has been ghetto so tonight excited for real music.  
The band asked for hot girls on stage.  
I picked up my lady( smoking hot mind you) to go in stage, little Johnny security, said \" no\".  

Okay, but why wouldn't you want a fu$$#!? Hot girl on stage??????
 I mean seriously, the draw isn't middle aged guys reliving their youth in spandex and wigs...
So, Scottsdale can keep their high school memories. 
We are done!"}
{"text":"You can play Cornhole, or GIANT Connect-4 on the outdoor patio!  I'm always a fan of places that have games to play with friends.

Upstairs is a dance club that plays EDM.  There's a huge dance floor surrounded by booth tables.  Downstairs is casual with a fun, relaxed atmosphere with several bars to visit.

The layout is very similar to the old Martini Ranch, but the decor has been updated.  This is a great place to have a casual drink with friends, or go dancing upstairs.  I would recommend this new hot spot!"}
{"text":"We just happened to find this place while in downtown Scottsdale Sunday night on foot. So funny because one of the bands we loved were playing that night too. :) One of the local bands we enjoyed too. And no cover! We had caramel bacon popcorn for an after- dinner snack which was addictive-ly amazing!! Only problem was that Metalhead took an hour to change sets, but for a free concert was worth it. Also bartenders not very attentive and changed often, so a lack of communication.
But loved the bar too, partially inside and outside which is ideal in AZ in the winter. We will be back and recommend!"}
{"text":"I always have a great time here. I've been going here for years to see Rock Lobster play, they are the greatest live band around. I like the layout with the outside bar, upstairs dance room and downstairs live music area. The crowd here seems to be a mix of older and younger people so you shouldn't feel out of place because of your age. The bartenders are top notch and quite good looking too."}

{"text":"This place says they have both DirecTV and Cox to draw people in who are interested in watching football games on the Pac-12 network but they're lying because they have to \"re-wire\" their TVs so you can't watch anything on Cox. It's amateur hour over here."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time Friday just to stop in as we walked by and my buddy said this place is everything I've been looking for. Right as we walk in a live band is rocking out and I'm already excited. We go straight upstairs to the back and the place keeps getting bigger and bigger. We are now in a whole different area with a live dj. I started dancing immediately and hung out longer than intended. I had to show my girlfriend and her friends this place and we decided we were gonna go Saturday night...even though I lost my car keys the night before....I stopped by wasted grain Saturday afternoon to see if I lost my keys there. Talked to  the security guard Adam and he was very helpful and even though they had nothing yet, took down my number and ensured me he'd let me know if anything was found. We came back that night as promised and Adam recognized me right away and was sad to tell me there was still no good news. We danced our faces off anyways and half way through Adam came up to me with a big smile and revealed my keys! Such a perfect way to top the night and definitely our new place! See you soon Adam and gang! Make sure the dance floor is ready"}
{"text":"Fun time great tv. Literally started a dance party tonight and never doing it again because there music is sub par and they don't know how to entertain an audience. Congrats on ur cover up songs there was one girl singer who was good but everyone else looked like they were from Wayne's world. Catch up with the times u might last longer"}
{"text":"I love this place.the food is sooooooooooooo good."}
{"text":"Great Sunday funday! I believe our servers name was Shannon and she was very good at keeping up with out group of 10+! We will return because of the customer service!"}
{"text":"This place has the best bartenders. They make it a point to know their regulars and they are friendly to every new person that walks in the bar. Their wings are delicious and it's my favorite steelers bar in scottsdale for Sunday football!"}
{"text":"It's been a while since I have experienced blatant racism like at the Wasted Grain. We flew down from Seattle for the Super Bowl and are staying in Scottsdale. We were told about this place by fellow Seahawk fans. We watched other people reserve tables for the game no problem. When we asked to reserve there was suddenly a problem, manager could not recall the seating arrangement for the bar and could not decide on a price for reserving a table for our party size just said it would be expensive. I never have had someone assume that because I am Hispanic I can't afford a table. We couldn't get any reason but suddenly he couldn't help us. We have lots of people joining us so it's their loss. Thank god I live in Seattle. The only reason I gave a 1 star is for the bartender."}
{"text":"We had a great experience here.  The waitress was on it! We had a group of 7 and sat in the couch area to watch the basketball game. They put the game we wanted to watch on all tvs for us.  Happy hour prices were cheap, food was good but not great and we ordered every item on it. The Margarita pizza was the best.  They had a great 80's band too, super fun place."}
{"text":"Had a bad experience here. Bartender tried to say I tipped him 25$ on an 18$ bill but when he brought out the receipt it was obvious I didn't."}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday. I emailed ahead of time to make sure we had room. We had a private space for me and my friends and they even got me balloons. That was so sweet!! The food was great too! The owner personally came up to me to say happy birthday too. Service was amazing! I will be back!"}
{"text":"This review is mainly for your fantastic bartender:  Katie.  We attended a party here on Friday evening and she really kept the attention and service at a level few bartenders are capable of achieving.

She was fast, engaging and professional.  We will return the next time we are in town."}
{"text":"If you are going just for a drink I would recommend great beer selection and atmosphere.  The reason I could only give it two stars was because of their food and service.  I was there with a group of 6 people and it took two hours to get our food.  When we did finally get it (we had salad wraps), they were soggy."}
{"text":"This place is pretty awesome :) I'm from NYC recently moved to the Old Town area in Scottsdale where I opened my own business.  I remember when this was Martini and it was kinda old and done.  The reno is gorgeous something for everyone.  Downstairs is chill, and upstairs is for dancing the night away.  Great vibe any night you go!"}
{"text":"Very poorly run establishment. The bouncer denied our friend entry because of his vertical (out of town) Id, and he's 24yo...but the worst part is that he offered to accept a bribe to let him into the bar. Terrible conduct by the bouncers, very disappointed."}
{"text":"Didn't eat anything, just had a couple drinks and danced. What a blast! The band playing was called NEON and they were excellent! Everything they sang sounded great and was always right on! They had an awesome variety that kept the whole place moving! We loved every minute."}
{"text":"Came here last Saturday with about 10 friends. Place was busy with a mixture of all ages. 

I think everyone came out to see the Adam Lambert look-a-like band play Maroon 5 and Bon Jovi covers. Despite that we had a blast. The outdoor area is really fun and sits far enough away from the stage to carry on a conversation without yelling while still being able to clearly hear the music. 

We ventured upstairs to the \"clubby\" area which turned out to be a Boy Scout convention. Big scary bouncers were really killing the potential for any fun. 

I must say I wasn't expecting much out of this place before I came in. I'm glad my perception changed. I'll definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"I went to wasted grain with a group of guys to watch the ncaa tournament games.  I went in with low expectations due to it being the old martini ranch.  I figured it would be dirty and have that funky smell that martini ranch use to have.  The place was very clean and you can tell they put a lot of money into it.  Our service was excellent, anytime anyone's drink was even close to empty, our waitress was there to refill them.  I had the chicken tacos and they were very good for bar food.  I wouldn't go there specifically for the food but it served it's purpose. The TV situation was also surprisingly good. I would definitely go back to watch a game if in old town.  I imagine the place gets pretty Scottsdale clubby at night.  The clientele was more of a trendy younger crowd which unfortunately we don't fit into.  Overall, the level of service we received is what made wasted grain stand out.  I thought the prices were a little high but I normally don't go to old town so they could be standard.  Beers were around $8, 3 tacos were $12."}
{"text":"A week later and no response from the general manager.  This clearly indicates that management could care less about their patrons within their establishment.  Will not be returning!!"}
{"text":"Meh. Place is ok, nothing to write home about. Drink prices fluctuate like the stock market which is also Meh. Service was average. Much better than Martini Ranch though."}
{"text":"Total ROCK OUT kinda place! Great service, great food great atmosphere! Brings life to the area! Please keep the bartenders sexy AF!"}
{"text":"Not a welcoming environment. Over priced. Bad service. Save your money and walk a few a block farther to the next bars."}
{"text":"This place was packed Friday Happy Hour, we got into the back bar and did get service. Lots of millenials and hipsters getting tanked. Lots to see and look at. We enjoyed our food and will come again, maybe at a less busy time because there were people packed and you could not get in or out. And forget the bathroom."}
{"text":"We went to waisted grain super excited to have a fun filled Saturday night. We went up to the top bar, and got drinks & started dancing. After 30 minutes or so a security guard asked us to leave because apparently it was a private party. He pushed my girl friend the whole way out the door, made false accusations about her slapping someone, AND flipped us off. I get its a night club, but where is your professionalism?! Buddy, if you were doing your job correctly we shouldn't of been able to get into the private party! NOT our fault we didn't know it was a private event due to the fact it wasn't closed off and there was no security! Because of that there was  no reason for his power trip or for him to push around a woman so aggressively."}
{"text":"After a festival in Scottsdale, my partner and I wandered over to Wasted Grain and we had a great time.  This place is so open that we vowed to return the next time it rains.  We loved the choices of seating and the fun little outdoor space with games.

We were full from the festival, so we only tried the drinks.  I asked for a mojito, even though I didn't see it on the menu.  It was decent.  Hubby liked his beers."}
{"text":"I've gone to The Wasted Grain a few times. The first time was an attempt to eat dinner with a few friends and catch up... We sat down on a Thursday night and the music was so loud at 5 pm that we had to scream to hear each other. We looked at the menu and didn't see anything amazing. It was also freezing cold inside. We decided to leave after 10 mins of waiting for a server to greet our table. We ate at the Lodge instead and was very happy with our choice to leave. 

Since then, we have come to the Grain to watch football and play games. We enjoy the outdoor games but the service is so terrible, it's hard for us to waste our money on food/ drinks. 

In the picture attached, you can see our bartender SITTING On the dishwasher playing with her hair. She was also continuously texting INSTEAD of making us drinks. At one point she was sitting on the bar in front of the tv we were watching a football game on while she text away.... 

So unprofessional and inconsiderate. I don't think this place will be able to stay open much longer. In old town Scottsdale you need exceptional service, good food, and good drinks. I think wasted grain lacks all of these things. 

Wish them luck but I give it another 6 months or so before the staff runs this place into the ground."}
{"text":"Good place to go for fun. They have games, good music and food. We went during the Scottsdale taco crawl and it was pretty busy but still fun."}
{"text":"Came here for Super Bowl weekend with some friends who were from out of town.  Had a great time!  The service was great and the bartenders were awesome.  Great job, especially considering it was Super Bowl weekend and it was packed! I'm coming back!"}
{"text":"For anyone who goes to Old Town Scottsdale, please avoid Wasted Grain at all costs. I had a terrible experience tonight and I hope that this never happens to anyone at this place ever again. My sister and I arrived here on Sunday, September 6, 2015, at 10:15 pm to meet up with some friends. We stayed for about 30 minutes, drinking only water because we weren't planning on staying out late. When we decided to leave at 10:45 pm, I began to walk out of the bar with my plastic clear water cup when one of bouncers at the front door, whom I will call Bouncer #1, a bald Caucasian male in his early forties, abruptly snatched the cup out of my hand without any explanation and yelled repeatedly at me, \"You can't do that!!\" I tried to take my cup back and began to explain that my drink had no alcohol in it, that it was simply water. He continued to yell loudly at me that I needed to drink it inside. 

So I followed his instructions and began to walk back inside the bar with my water cup but all he did was yell and try to take my cup back again as he yelled over and over, \"INSIDE!!\" Then he charged towards me so hard and fast that he knocked over the black line dividers, and was inches away from my face, still yelling at me. I was scared that he was going to physically attack me and I began tearing up because I never understood what was being asked of me. At this point, another bouncer, Bouncer #2, came up to us and tried to explain in a professional manner, as it should be, that I was not allowed to take my water cup outside. I found it shocking that such a small matter was escalated to the point where I was fearful that this employee was going to attack me. All that Bouncer #1 had to do was to calmly let me know I wasn't allowed to take my water cup outside of the bar and instead, he lost his cool and behaved in an unprofessional manner as he verbally attacked me in front of other customers. 

As I walked away crying, the bouncer that had lunged towards me began talking to the other customers waiting in line. He proceeded to make fun of me and even said aloud, \"It's not rocket science\". I am only bringing attention to this awful experience so that hopefully, this will never happen to another customer at this place ever again. As for my friends and I, we will be staying far away from this establishment. I will be reaching out to management to make sure that they are aware of the type of employees that are representing their company."}
{"text":"Horrible service! Would not recommend. Do not come!! Trust me come to another bar, this one is lame!"}
{"text":"Saturday has kids from school of rock jamming. Happy hour from 3p-8p. Good spot for a beer and live entertainment."}
{"text":"We come here to see our favorite bands and dance our a** off. Tonight we were munchie and needed a snack...Wow we got the Margarita flat bread and it was amazing light and delicious not the greasy food you might expect. Yummmmmy!!"}
{"text":"This place is filled with gorgeous women! The whole atmosphere is poppin and the music venues are great! The only thing that sucked was the very low alcohol content in the drinks, they use 1.5 in a Jack and Coke, which by no means is that the standard and the back bartender Bria was really bitchy and charging us a different amount than the roaming cocktail waitress. But I do recommend this place for a great time!!!"}
{"text":"$10 bloody Mary's? No specials for game days? Lots of wasted space on patio - could have more seating and TVs. Slow service. Bad TV sound. Very pricey. Decent beer selection."}
{"text":"Where to begin,  Thursday night at this joint. Not overly busy sat down and waited 11 minutes for a server to ask us if we have been helped.  We had asked for menus another few minutes goes by.  Eventually we ordered some food and a few drinks.  The menu I was handed had an ant crawling in it.  Didn't give it much thought as we were seated on the outside patio.  Anyways we ordered food flatbread for us and a buffalo chicken wrap for a friend.  Sorry to say but the flatbread pizza tasted like....well it reminded me of a lunchable that you find in the grocery store.  Absolutely gross the buffalo chicken sandwich was also not well balanced out and had so much sauce in it.....fries were so salty they made you so thirsty.   Lastly it apparently was karaoke night could have done without the staff allowing the girls to scream I fu** do what I want songs blaring out all over.   Will not be returning"}
{"text":"Do not go here. I went to watch NFL football, made the mistake of wearing the 'wrong' team t-shirt, and two Seahawk fans threatened to kill me as I walked to the restroom (what is this Dodger stadium?). Grow up guys, not sure what the real issue is, sorry your team lost (not sorry), but I'm just spending money and hanging out in the same place you are. No need to threaten me. If you have people you care about, you don't want to go here, not sure if you will get shanked outside.  The main reason I give the terrible review is Security was clueless, power hungry meat heads that can't spell, needless to say both of the guys who wanted to kill me were not asked to leave, security never even asked me what happened, might be protecting that Seahawk crew that pays to rent the place. Plenty of other places to spend your money and watch football. Do yourself and loved ones a favor and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"This place is great, finally a new place that has a great atmosphere, an extensive craft cocktail menu, and delicious food.   I stopped by the other day while looking for a place to eat and I am glad I did.  Happy hour wasn't super busy but had a decent crowd.  They have a cool way of doing their drinks on happy hour, its called the drink exchange. Drink prices are based on demand and customer ordering, basically like the stock exchange.  The food was good, tried a few appetizers which were good sized and fair priced.  Def. will be back and I recommend everyone check out this new spot"}
{"text":"I don't believe there's a such thing as a bad time to visit Wasted Grain. I had a blast there under its past life as Martini Ranch, and I still think it's awesome now.

Here's the deal. It has: 

-A cool little local music venue on the first floor
-An awesome patio, now equipped with *two* bars
-A real groovy lounge upstairs

It really does cater to the tastes of everyone. You can get your club on at night, but it's a good spot during the day as well. No one who works here is a douche. I'll return. I'll even recommend it to anyone!"}
{"text":"This place is fun as a night club environment but we came here for food earlier in the day and it SUCKED. Everything about our experience from start to finish was horrible. Lip stick on our wine glass, took 10minutes for a side of ranch and 25 minutes for one the worst chicken caesar wraps I've ever had. Had the service not been so slow I may have gotten a chance to order something else. We did have a friendly ombré server but let's not mention the blonde that delivered our food was clearly over joyed to be working... Will not come here again. Maybe Bottled Blonde or El Hefe next time."}
{"text":"This use to be Martini Ranch and then they remodeled. Great job. The atmosphere is excellent and the service is perfect. I just ordered the Poutine and it was delicious!"}
{"text":"Rolled into WG's with da girls last evening. Smashed was performing when we walked in and they are freaking AWESOME! I normally don't like \"cover bands\". They brought the house down. Being from Chi town I had low expectations going in however we walked in when the band was already playing their first set and we walked in already impressed. I really like the space overall, crowd was good. 2nd floor you can dance and they have a dj spinning it was just ok imho.. Just sayin. We stayed upstairs for a bit then headed back downstairs for the bands second set and had a blast.

Bouncers were super cool and really nice, along with the bartenders. Great experience, made me feel like I was back home in Chi town.  Definitely found a fun place to hang out in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"The happiest of hours as this bar! The drinks can get expensive but that is to be expected for old town Scottsdale. As far as the overall experience I give it an A+. The outdoor area is so nice and for the most part the bartender's are nice... Not a huge fan of the outdoor bar's usual female bartender though. However the upstairs area is a hidden gem, they usually have electronic music you can dance to and it's a cool scene. They have live music sometimes which us fun. 

The best thing about this bar is that it doesn't feel like the rest of the bars are clubs around it, you can hear people when you want to talk and there is always a place to sit and chill with your friends but you can also get up and dance if you want to as well. The best of both worlds. Unfortunately I moved back to Denver so it won't be my regular hang out spot anymore but I felt I needed to write them a review because I've had so many great memories made there."}
{"text":"Love the check in. Great place for groups after work. The food is good to! The staff is friendly and nice. Great prices on mixed drinks for happy hour. So of the best in old town."}
{"text":"Wanted a place to watch the Steelers games and found a group that was going here.  Had been wanting to check the place out since it had changed from Martini Ranch so it was a double benefit.  The staff did a great job of making us feel welcomed and even put up a Steelers banner!  We had a great section to ourselves that was super comfortable (loved the couches!!)  Our waitress came by frequently to see if we needed anything and was very nice and friendly.  I asked the manager some questions about hosting large events there and not only got the info I wanted but got a tour of the new place.  I was very impressed with how we were treated and as long as they keep showing the Steelers games will go there on a weekly basis to watch them, and if the service continues to be as great will be hosting some large events there too!"}
{"text":"Another place in oldtown I tend to lose my dignity at. The excessive binge drinking causes regretful decisions that my friends soon collaborate together the next day as we bond with puke and dry heaving alcohol withdrawal. This can occasionally be accompanied by a smokeshow that we meet there that will judge us the next morning in our group AA meeting we hold in our living room. We go every weekend and love it"}
{"text":"Cool place good design, great food, and drinks are cheap. Pretty people, prettier staff. No complaints here"}
{"text":"This is one of the few bars in Old Town Scottsdale that has a live band. Good people ...good music... older crowd."}
{"text":"Two different areas. The back upstairs is the dance area, there are times I liked it others I really wondered what the DJ was doing. He seemed to mix it up when there were people finally dancing. 

The soda dispenser (yes some us drive) is flat, has been flat for months. 

Downstairs bartenders seem more friendly, and they are busier. I was there a number of times, once when a band was on. Was fun to be part of crowd. Not sure its made for single single people who show up by themselves. 

Over all its a club, haven't been to many since my photo days at Revolver (before that) Myst and all those others that have been torn down and rebuilt."}
{"text":"This is a cool place. I really enjoyed the fact that this was a mixed age group crowd so I didn't feel out of place being an older woman. The band was really good.  Don't recall the name but the music as well was oldies and new hits being played so that there was something do for everyone. We hung out in the back patio area. There were heating lamps just in case it got chilly out but it was a comfortable nice and nice to be outside and listening to some good music. The bar staff were great. My bartender gave us shots for our party because it was my friends birthday. This kind of great service will keep me coming back. Overall awesome experience. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Cheeseburger Sliders were Amazing!!! Busy but bartenders still on top of it and service is quick!"}
{"text":"I am 25 years old and I have been working and living in Scottsdale for 19 months now. This past Saturday evening August 6th the bouncer that was working the door tried to tell me that he didn't need to accept my out of state ID (I'm from Denver, CO) and that he could technically could deny me. I've NEVER in my life experienced this kind of service. My ID is valid and he was so incredibly rude. I've never been treated this way in my entire life. I feel discriminated against and don't understand why the bouncer would make such comment to me and then let me in the bar"}
{"text":"This was either the best or the worst night to throw a birthday party. The bar wasn't anticipating the arrival of 700 Santa Clauses when I booked my reservation. That being said, they were as accommodating as they could be in that situation. Plus, I got to have an epic dance battle with a guy dressed up in pink tights, a sweatband, and a tank top that said \"Olivia- Let's get physical\"."}
{"text":"I love this place!
It's dual dynamic is great for anyone looking to have a great time. Downstairs, they have 2 bars and a big patio. They often have live bands playing down there. Upstairs, they have the 100 Proof Lounge. It's like leaving the bar and stepping into a club! It's pretty unique- I can't think of any other place like it. The service has always been great. I've never had anything less than a stellar experience there.
Definitely check it out when you're in Old Town!"}
{"text":"Place is great for watching football. Outdoor patio is nice with a few drinking games you can play. The food however was pretty bad. We got the humus, deviled eggs and the bacon wrapped prawns. Everything was either not seasoned or over seasoned. Prawns we're chewy and bacon was burnt. Drinks were good, reasonably priced. This place needs to think about getting a new chef though."}
{"text":"My co-workers wanted a place to chill and get some drinks after dinner so we pulled into this shopping center area. There's a bunch of bars located in this section. 

They have tons of TVs at this bar, super spacious. They also have life size jenga and connect 4 here for people to play. There's a patio area for smokers and some seats to sit in. 

There was a decent amount of people here on a Tuesday night so I guess this might be the area people come to but it does get dead after like 9pm or so."}
{"text":"One of my favorite bars in Old Town.  I love that it is not so \"scottsdale-y.\"  You get a good variety of patrons since there is the live music section and the club section still.  I never feel cramped, overcrowded and it's always quick to get a drink.  I'm a sucker for live cover bands so I love this place just for that reason."}
{"text":"I was in Scottsdale attending the Super Bowl Fan Fest when I randomly found this bar after parking near it. It was packed with mostly Seahawks fans, probably because admission was free if you were wearing something Seahawks related. The Patriots fans had their own designated bar down the street that was near empty. 

The rapper, Too $hort was hanging out in VIP with his crew and was scheduled to perform that night. We really wanted to stick around but had dinner plans with friends. We also didn't want to start drinking and get too crazy since we had a long night ahead of us. Cool place though. Definitely the type of bar for big groups. For the most part, the bar was filled with intoxicated people, socializing and/or dancing, all before 6 pm. It was a crazy, high energy environment, but that could just be because of all the fans in town for the Super Bowl."}
{"text":"The staff here has a very poor attitude.  They are not very friendly or welcoming. There is totally rude staff here.  The unprofessional staff needs a lesson about customer service.  This is not a good place to hang out unless you don't mind staff who argues, is judgemental and creates an embarrassing time for people.   This place sucks!  I would not recommend for others to visit this place...  I'm having a conversation with some friends and relaxing.  These bouncer jerks are threatening to throw people out if you shut your eyes.  What is the lounge area for if you can't even relax and enjoy the music?"}
{"text":"I love this place on the weekends for live music and great bar staff, however I heard through friends they have good food. So Friday the 6th of March I stopped over there for a late lunch and ordered the marinated mixed vege dish. It came with a skewer of chicken and a skewer of filet both had grilled veges of onions, red peppers, and mushrooms which were amazing. The dish also came with  lime cilantro rice, but I am not a rice fan and our server let me choose whatever else i wanted to substitute it with. I choose grilled asparagus, some of the best i ever had. For 14$, this plate was filling and mouth watering. Our server Ashley was sweet and catering too which added to our great experience."}
{"text":"awesome bar with a more mature crowd good band playing and very stiff drinks this will be my home bar next time i am in AZ"}
{"text":"I've been to this place too many; in surprised that I haven't received the dukedom yet. Anyway, Tiff and Eddie are the best. They know what I want to drink and I never have to ask, they know and it's great. 

They have cornhole on the patio which has won me numerous free drinks. Overall, this is a great place to gen drinks, mingle, and have a damn good time."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place.  Great music cold beer and a friendly staff.  They were even nice to Hank who kept trying to take his shirt off while hitting on every woman and man in the place.  I recommend Wasted Grain but I do not recommend Hank.  #teammrbo"}
{"text":"This is pretty much the same old Martini Ranch, except they moved the stage... and maybe the bar is a bit different too.  Love Rock Lobster, the 80s cover band that plays on Saturday nights.  They also still have the \"Shaker Room\" upstairs that plays techno music."}
{"text":"Very busy on a Saturday night due to the football game. There's plenty of seating and standing inside and outside. We didn't stay long as we were bouncing around but the place was very cool looking. If your looking to party this might be the place for you."}
{"text":"I've walked by this place a million times and finally decided to stop in last night. This place has a really cool inside with two different atmospheres depending on whether you're downstairs or upstairs. Fantastic drink menu and the Jack Daniels honey drink was my favorite! I had Roy as a bartender and he was very knowledgable and friendly! I would definitely recommend this place to others!"}
{"text":"I was at Wasted Grain for a few rounds of drinks with coworkers that just flew in for the evening. I'm from the Bay Area, California myself. Our waitress Arianna was very accommodating especially since it was my first time in the Scottsdale area. Thank you Arianna for the excellent service. I didn't get to personally thank Arianna's boss, Michael, but please know I enjoyed my time at WG for a random Wednesday evening. Thank you Arianna!"}
{"text":"Great live music and no cover!!

Also Loved coming in on Saturdays for happy hour but it's no longer offered on Saturdays and happy hour deals not what they were previously.  Bummer but lots of other great places nearby!"}
{"text":"So I rate bars/restaurants/ on a few different things. Obviously, food is a pretty important element of a restaurant. However; the place itself seemed very cool to hang out..if you don't want to eat. :) They have oversized Jenga like you've seen at Dos Gringos, they have corn-hole, lots of seating, lots of TVs and indoor and outdoor areas. The wait staff was somewhat efficient but not friendly. I asked for a water and never got it. (I assume because that was not a paid drink) The guys in the kitchen looked dirty and unkept with long hair all over the place, piercings, and no form of uniform to tell them from the patrons. The women behind the bar were so scantilly clad that I felt more like I was in a gentleman's club than at a restaurant. If I had gone there with my son to eat, we probably would have had to leave because of all the ass cleavage and toe being flaunted. Gross. The food, steak and chicken kabobs, white rice, and mashed potatoes was so bland and void of seasoning if I wasn't starving, I would have left it. The \"appetizers\" of chips and guac were stale, the pigs in a blanket were a little beneath my expectations and something I think I could have made at home. Oh well, not many places in that area stand the test of time and I predict this one will probably be gone soon too. There was one guy, I think the GM, that was very helpful with the TVs and spent time trying to find the game we wanted to watch. He was awesome. Everyone else kind of seemed like they didn't want to be working."}
{"text":"This is cool spot to watch football. It's huge and I like both areas. Plenty of tvs! The service is fair. I'm ready to football season so I can go back."}
