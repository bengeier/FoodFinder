{"text":"It's probably one of my favorite spots in town. The salmon is always cooked to perfection no matter if it's in a salad or with an entree."}
{"text":"Beef was dry, chicken was good. Hummas was plain. Price was ok.  Nothing special."}
{"text":"Extraordinary food, consistently delicious and authentic tasting.  We know we come here for a great quality meal every time we visit.  Prices are fair and customer service is good."}
{"text":"I will not be going back to this restaurant for a long time if ever again. I always order the chicken kabob Greek salad with the chicken chopped to avoid undercooked chicken yet the chicken has been pink on many occasions. In my last salad the \"hand chopped\" tomatoes were too large.  Literally, a whole tomatoe was cut into 4 pieces. The cucumbers were old transparent and soggy and there was not much lettuce. I also ordered the large hummus which was of a pudding consistency with too much lemon added.  And i usually get 2 pita breads with my order and today i got 4, all with yellow spots..perhaps they add butter now? I called to inform them of my unsatisfied order and was interrupted while I was going over what was wrong. Only redeeming factor was their offer to remake my food but after having it made so many times with unsafe chicken I could not accept that as a solution. I don't know if they changed cooks but everything was prepared different today. I liked coming here knowing I could eat a healthy meal when I was crunched on time but now it seems that is not the case anymore.

Next time I want Greek food I will go to 59th ave and olive."}
{"text":"I ate here about a month ago. My fiancée wanted Chipotle but I decided to venture out and try a Gyro from here. I ordered it to go but when I got home it was still steaming hot. The meat had so much flavor and wasn't dry at all. The gyro was so large my fiancée ended up eating half and he loved it. It was his first time ever eating one and he is looking forward to going back. Friendly staff and great food make this a wonderful place to eat! My only gripe is that the Baklava was possibly the worst I've ever had. It was extremely salty and just terrible. Skip the desserts!"}
{"text":"Good food but we've noticed the portion sizes have really gone down.  A little disappointed."}
{"text":"Great experience from start to finish.  Pleasant staff. Wonderful gyro and greek fries. Large portions. Reasonable prices. I'll definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"I have been on a Greek salad kick lately and decided to not eat at Smashburger and give Pita Kitchen a whirl.  I was a little apprehensive spending $9 (8.69) on a Greek salad with chicken but told myself it would be huge and I would have to eat it over 2 sittings.  I was NOT disappointed.  There is a huge heap of chicken in this salad and it's not just a grilled chicken breast chopped over a Greek salad;  it's chicken SHAWARMA - beautifully seasoned, tender and moist.  There were chunks of feta as opposed to just tiny crumbles and their dressing was amazing!  My brother and I butt heads over Greek salad dressing;  he prefers to have it with vinegar strong enough to clean your pipes, and his go to is George's Gyros.  I prefer a more mellow dressing that allows me to keep my eyes open whilst eating and have come to frequent Z's Greek, down the road from my house.  This dressing was by far the BEST I've had.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Simple menu, decent prices, good food. Had the gyro and greek fries and the only negative is that the pita started to fall apart. Otherwise, great flavors and filling. I look forward to trying the few other items on the menu and definitely would recommend this place if you're looking for a gyro."}
{"text":"We stopped in today and we very favorably impressed. Both of us had the number 1 but were talking about what we would try next visit. Great pitas! With the trip."}
{"text":"I've been to Pita Kitchen a few times now. I first found this place about a year and a half ago when I was in town visiting family. Tony Stark from Avengers left me wondering what the heck shawarma was. So I searched Yelp and found this great place. I have ordered the chicken shawarma, with pita chips and hummus each time I have been there. It has been delicious every time. Thank you Pita Kitchen, I will be back next time I am in town."}
{"text":"The best Mediterranean restaurant in AZ!  It is the go-to place for my husband and me. Excellent customer service.  The staff and owners appreciate their customers.   The food is so delicious.  Quality, every time.  My favorite is the Greek fries."}
{"text":"Visiting town from L.A.  Chose this spot based upon the reviews and my love for kabobs. Although I usually have Persian kabobs these are just as good. The chicken kabob, rice, and hummus were all on point. The chicken was perfectly marinated and cooked."}
{"text":"Good quality service and food,place is clean,lighting is just right with some nice background music and the employes are good people trying to make a good name for the restaurant. I wish them the best every time i visit..!"}
{"text":"So the service was great. Very fast, friendly and efficient. The prices are wonderful for the amount you get. And them there's the food. It was hands down the best Mediterranean food I've ever had. I will DEFINITELY be going back, and soon too!"}
{"text":"Delicious, generous portions, service with a smile. 
Extra nominal charge for extra sauce. Gyros better than tri-tip."}
{"text":"I had a very pleasant and great experience at Pita Kitchen and am excited to return and try a different plate.  Not only was the customer service exceptional but their food was very good as well. 

My friend and I had the Steak Shawarma with fries, Hummus with Steak Shawarma and Tabouli Salad.  Everything was very tasty with a homemade flavor.  The Pita bread that came with the Hummus was warm and soft which I love.  Everything looked just like the pictures on the menu so there were no surprises other than the delicious flavor. :)  We upgraded our dish to the combo so we ordered fries (option we chose, which were really good too) and had unlimited refills with any drink at the fountain!    

Being that it was a grand opening week they handled the amount of people and orders in a timely manner.  The restaurant was very clean, as well as the women restrooms, which is important to me.  

I highly recommend anyone to go and try it and enjoy the experience we did.  Again, delicious food and really great and friendly customer service!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Love the Greek salad with gyros meat.  Staff is very kind and attentive."}
{"text":"They are horrible at takeouts!!!!
The first I ordered out was the salmon entree it was completely burned it was horrible and made the rest of the dish taste burnt. This time when I ordered out I told them to put the feta cheese in a plastic container instead of on the salad. What happened? they added no feta period! My friend picked up my orders both times and each time they messed it up. I won't be ordering food from that place anymore."}
{"text":"For starters, the customer service here is outstanding! You'll usually catch the manger in the front working and you can just tell that he takes so much pride in this establishment. As for the food? It is absolutely delicious! It will definitely keep you coming back for more. I only wish there were more locations!"}
{"text":"Excellently prepared.  Great customer service.  The schwarma and gyro are great, hummus and greek salad fantastic.  I wish I lived closer to eat here every day!"}
{"text":"Great food. We ate there last month while visiting family. We will make this stop every time we come through town. We just wish we lived closer. Delicious food for a good value in a pleasant environment."}
{"text":"Honest, family owned restaurant. My friend and I met here before a concert at Ak-Chin. We walked in right before the dinner rush. This place is in a plaza with Chipotle and Raising cane's so I'm sure they get a lot of business from people who don't want to wait in line, but I'm sure these customers are pleasantly surprised to have stumbled upon such a gem. The food was amazing. I just had the gyro and greek fries. The gyro was large and delicious. Pita was fluffy and so perfectly made. The fries were out of this planet. I've never had greek fries with feta, parsley and olive oil on them. It was divine. My friend texts me weekly to go back. 

When I ordered here, we noticed you can text a number to get a discount off your meal. They honored the discount and when the cashier realized he overcharged me ( 2 minutes after I already paid), he tracked me down to give me the difference that he owed me. I didn't even notice the error, but it's this kind of honesty that will keep me coming back. The delicious food helps too!"}
{"text":"Whenever I know I'll be in the vicinity of Pita Kitchen,  I want to make sure that I'll also be hungry!  Last couple of times I had a falafel snack. Yesterday with a friend we also enjoyed the Greek Fries. :-) I had wanted to get them but it's a lot for little'ole me to eat.  So splitting the order with a girlfriend was perfect.  Fries plus greek dressing plus feta cheese sprinkled with fresh parsley. ..o my gosh! So good!"}
{"text":"If you're driving along the 10 Fwy. in Avondale this is the place to go for good food.  The chicken kabob's are good.  Prices and portion sizes are good."}
{"text":"This place is tha sh*t ! Best pita place I ever had everyone come try this place ! It's pretty busy but well worth tha wait"}
{"text":"Chicken kababs are amazing..with some of the famous pink garlic sauce.....I usually get the chicken kababs..or the chicken kababs salad...great"}
{"text":"Gosh this place is so great. Service was excellent food was delicious and everything was very pleasing will definitely be coming back again. YUMMM."}
{"text":"We went on a Saturday afternoon and they were pretty busy being it was lunch hour. We ordered the gyros. Even our 14 yr old picky eater had a gyro.

The gyros themselves were packed full of meat. Had a good amount of the cucumber sauce. They tasted awesome! Gyros are decently priced and a combo with fries and a drink will run you about 9 bucks. 

We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I can never get myself to try anything new because the #1 with Greek fries forever has its hold on me! I know I'm missing out on a lot of other great options also and maybe one day I'll give in but today is not the day.

First off, always, I repeat always go for the upgrade and get the Greek fries! There is a vinaigrette of some sort they put on their fries that give those frenchies an extra pop of delicious flavor. Secondly, I'm never disappointed with my gyro here. The flavors are always on point and the amount of meat they put in the pita is more than substantial. You definitely get more then what you pay for here and I couldn't be happier that it's just down the road from me!"}
{"text":"Amazing - the Baba Ganouche is scruptious.  Pita chips were melt in your mouth good.  Chicken and rice absolutely delicious.  Super affordable - not a ton of ambiance, but the food is the star of the show here."}
{"text":"5 Star all the way! Awesome food and service. You can tell they appreciate their customers ....
We ordered the #1- Gyro plate, gyro was very good and the fries were definitely something to write home about... 
Our favorite Gyro place shut down about 6 months ago....We have absolutely found our new favorite Gyro place. Thank you Pits Kitchen!"}
{"text":"Have been here multiple times and one time it's excellent and the next.....not so much. Gyros has been great every time though so that's why I gave it 4 stars."}
{"text":"Delicious! Love the food & the staff are very friendly too. Reasonable price for the portion of food you get & they don't skimp on anything. Worth trying out if you haven't been here yet."}
{"text":"First time eating here and I must say the food and the service was amazing! We weren't familiar with the food and the cashier/ server was so helpful. Chicken greek salad, Chicken Kabob and the pita bread were excellent! Thank you!"}
{"text":"This is my go to greek restaurant. I have tried many other places in the valley and nothing compares to this place. Their staff is very friendly and helpful. Especially if it is your first time. I've tried several different things but I would always end up with the gyro pita and a side of hummus. But then I tried the hummun with the gyro meat on top dish and now that is my new favorit and with a side of tzatziki. Can't forget that."}
{"text":"Again thank you so much Pita Kitchen, you are my soul food. The food is great, hot and the price is right! Your store is clean and your staff is alway friendly! Thanks you so much for being so awesome!"}
{"text":"Super quick and friendly service. Had the gyro pita combo; everything was fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"Short and simple review: this place is yummy! Great value!"}
{"text":"Best Greek takeout on the west side. Prices are reasonable. Dining room is typically full, so may want to take out. Their steak shwarma pitas are awesome."}
{"text":"Pita chips are delicious. Gyros are delicious. Salads are delicious. Just come here for some delicious Greek  food!!!"}
{"text":"The food was so delicious, and the employees were extremely friendly. I am so happy to have stumbled upon this place while visiting the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Had a gyro and Frys...awesome...this place rocks on their Gyros....watched other orders being delivered to other customers and I will be coming back ..,
This place is very busy they do a lot of carry out orders as well...."}
{"text":"Great food, will be back!  I had a gyro, wife had a shawarma, the 9 year-old had a gyro too and we all loved it.  We also had hummas for an appetizer.  Nice and clean tastes across the board."}
{"text":"Had the chicken shawarma combo. The meat was too dry and lacked flavor the lettuce was very bitter. Kinda disappointed. The hummus and pita chips were ok, but nothing worth coming back for. Customer service was good."}
{"text":"Fantastic! I have eaten MANY Gyros and this was the best. The fried pita chips with hummus is a brilliant idea! (also good with ketchup) Quality stuff here, clean place, friendly staff. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"I love place! The best Greek food in Phoenix I've tried so far! Always fresh, always yummy! Great service. The owner is always checking up on your meal and he is always soo nice!"}
{"text":"The pitas are awesome and the salads are huge. Very nice and clean and the staff are very friendly. I'm glad we stopped here"}
{"text":"Love their food... Wait time is long... I suggest calling order in if your carrying out."}
{"text":"Heavenly delicious! Mediterranean cuisine is my favorite. Pita Kitchen has some of the best Mediterranean food I have eaten (and I've eaten a lot in many cities). Live in Chandler but took our friend to dinner here who lives in Avondale after reading the really good Yelp reviews. He's a picky eater, had never eaten Mediterranean before but loved it. He had the Gyro plate with rice and Greek salad. We ordered the Mediterranean sampler platter for an appetizer and it was fabulous. Comes with hummus, baba ghanouj, taziki dip, dolmas, falafel, tabbouli and pita bread. All very fresh and mouth-watering. The pita bread was very soft and warm. The baba ghanouj is out of this world -- smokey, nutty, spicy. I have never been a huge dolma fan, but I was finally won over here. Husband and I had the falafel pita. The falafel was well seasoned and moist, perfect. Hubby also had the Greek fries which put all other fries to shame. I had a few bites and wanted to snag them when he wasn't looking but decided to mind my manners so I didn't end up sleeping on the couch. :-0 The portions are good size with reasonable prices. Very courteous staff who greet you with a pleasant smile and check on you even though it's a counter order style restaurant. Very clean with nice ambiance for a small, fast food restaurant even though I don't put it in the same category as fast food. We will definitely make the near-hour trip again just to eat here...oh and to visit our friend. Tried to convince the owner to put their next location near Chandler. Maybe we will have to start a petition for that. Haha! At any rate, highly recommend giving it a try. Works well as a family restaurant (kid-friendly menu), dinner dates, for vegitarians/vegans, take-out or catering. Just writing this review is making my mouth water. Just might have to make the drive to Avondale today. Nom Nom!"}
{"text":"The food is very good, the Greek fries are delicious,  and hummus and pita was unlike any others, my gyro was perfect, we will be back"}
{"text":"Their Greek salad is amazing, their chicken kebab is also amazing but the place is a little small and they're usually packed so it's hard to find seating some times. The longest I've waited for my food was about 35 minutes. Other than that I'll be coming back again."}
{"text":"greek fries are amazing as well as chicken kabob entree"}
{"text":"The best place to eat the gyro was good!! its a double thumbs up the atmosphere is awesome..."}
{"text":"Good food. The lady at the counter was nice. We ordered a couple gyros, a Greek Salad and pita with hummus. Similar to Crazy Jim's on 15th avenue."}
{"text":"My favorite Gyro place in the valley. Their pita bread is very soft and warm, their gyro meat is cooked and seasoned to perfection. The manager is always very nice and shoots the breeze with me while I'm waiting for my food. I also recommend their Greek fries. It is a little pricey for a quick dinner but very well worth it. You wont be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I'm not greek so i cant say that this place is authentic. But the first time my wife and i came here we were absolutely blown away by the food here. Fresh and vibrant flavors. 

If you want to expand your horizons and try a diffrent cusine, this place will be a good starting point. The restaurant maybe small buy it is clean and have friendly staff. Also, you get a 10% discount on your entire meal when you check in.on yelp."}
{"text":"This place is GOOD, all caps.
The restaurant is clean, service is great and the food is the bees knees.
My husband and I ordered the hummus and tabbouleh, beef gyro with fries, chicken schwarma, a side of rice for our son (he's a toddler) and baklava. Let me point out that my husband and I were both stationed in Turkey (It's where we met, Awww) so were a bit picky when it comes to Mediterranean food and this place passed. The gyro was perfectly seasoned, salty, crunchy, saucy all warmly wrapped in pita bread. The chicken schwarma was the same, the chicken was juicy with just the right about of vegetables and sauce (I added siracha because I love spicy and they offer it). I'd been reading about the delicious fries and the ones my husband got were plain, when I asked about the feta that was supposed to smother them I was told I had to order Greek fries. Even though it was my fault for ordering wrong the owner gave us a free order of Greek fries and they, are, addicting. The tabbouleh was just as citrusy as I remember from turkey. The only reason I didn't go with 5 stars is that the hummus is kind of bland and the baklava, although delicious, wasn't the crispy, pistachioy goodness I was craving.
Overall this place is great. 
If you have any issues remember that this place has only been open 2 weeks and they are doing an amazing job.
Chok guzel!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Best Greek food I've ever had. Food is excellent and the service is amazing. Food is always fresh. My favorite restaurant in town by far."}
{"text":"This is my third visit in about a month, and I finally decided to write a review. This place is really amazing, I always saw it because my sister loves the Chipotle next door but I can't stand that place, so I decided to try it out and I have not regretted the decision.

I always get the food to go, so I can't comment much on the service, but the worker at ordering is always super friendly, even with my weird order of separating everything.(Sometimes there is too much sauce and the pita gets soggy on To Go orders)

The only thing I've ordered so far is the Chicken Shawarma combo with Pita chips and hummus. But that's because it's just so good I can't get myself to order something else because I always crave it."}
{"text":"We got combo kabob and steak shawarma plate. Both were amazing. One of the best Mediterranean places I have eaten at. The food was very flavorful."}
{"text":"I love this place! Always great service, great food, great atmosphere. I will definitely be recommending you guys to everyone I know. My favorite item to eat here is the Greek fries!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here. I walked in and really enjoyed the atmosphere of the small restaurant. The staff was very friendly. We order a gyro and chicken pita. They were over all good. Good seasoning on the chicken and gyro meat. I wished they would have used better quality or fresher veggies. The baba ghanoush was great! I would go back just for that anytime! Over all good place when you are in a hurry and need a good bite to eat I will try it again."}
{"text":"Good customer service along with great gyros and shawarma. I will bring my friends in here next time I come :)"}
{"text":"I'm not going to lie. I am a huge fan of pita jungle and use them as my frame of reference.  I also REALLY like AZ kabob house. 

I don't work for either.

THIS PLACE IS AWESOME. I have it 4 stars because my kabob was cooked about 30 seconds  too long. But as you can tell my son loves the garlic sauce. 

This place is on point and the only good kabob spot in the west valley."}
{"text":"Best food ever worth to try it waiting time is 10 to 20 same as other places like iHop ... etc don't know why ppl complain about the waiting time it's fresh food not fast food restaurant"}
{"text":"Wow! The tabbouli salad here was impressive, fresh and delicious. 
The gyro meat was thickly sliced, ot thinly sliced like most greek places serve.
The hummus was flavorful and had a kick to it.  Maybe paprika?  
The pita chips are fried in house. They where served hot and greasy.

My entire dining experience here was amazing and alot $$$$ cheaper than the other greek place that we frequent! 

FREE WIFI at this place! Not bad.  

***You will need some serious mouthwash when you're done eating here.  So I don't recommend it if you're out on a date*** smooch smooch, no, no!"}
{"text":"I had the \"Mediterranean Sampler,\" I swapped the Dolmas for more Falafels and it wasnt too bad.  Hummus had great flavor, and the Falafels were cooked perfectly!  Will definetly be back, helps me avoid the drive to Pita Jungle!"}
{"text":"the food is super good, the gyros are huge and tasty... love the chicken ka-bob meal, glad its on the west side ;)"}
{"text":"Great place for simple Greek pitas. I love their salad, it's always fresh and crisp. The only down fall this place has is how small the dinning area is. It's normally pretty packed and not a lot of tables. It's great for small groups but not for large ones, not if u want to sit together."}
{"text":"I literally thought I had died and gone to heaven after trasting the Greek fries. Hands down the best seasoned fries I've ever eaten. The staff was helpful and the atmosphere is very pleasant."}
{"text":"I admit to being confused by the review posted before mine:  to compare this place to the Golden Greek is like comparing McDonald's to the Russian Tea Room!  Granted, they both serve Greek food; but no matter what your opinion about the Golden Greek  (and mine isn't good:  see my review of them!), this place is, like most \"Greek\" places in the Valley, a pseudo-fast food restaurant, while the Golden Greek serves actual meals.

I also don't get the line about the pita bread:  the pita bread here is of the cheapest sort:  fluffy and thick.  You may like that; but \"real\" pita bread is like the ones served at the Golden Greek and Haji Baba's (for example):  thin and doughy.  Prices are fair?  Yeah, that's about right ... \"fair\" as in on a scale from \"bad\" to \"excellent\":  the appetizers (hummus, babaganouj, dolmas, etc.) are priced fairly in comparison to other places, but that doesn't mean they're good:  $6+ for a \"large\" appetizer, which, while \"wide\" on the plate is not deep, is not \"fair\".  I won't even bother talking about the dolmas, because NOWHERE is that a good deal; it's a top money maker for all Mediterranean restaurants:  5 or 6 dolmas for $ 5.00, when you can get a large can of about 60 or more for the same price  (try the market at Baiz or Haji Baba).  

Now the taste:  the hummus was interesting.  Tasty and with a touch of cayenne pepper.  Very unusual for hummus, but, you know what?  It worked:  definitely wiped out any expected blandness, but was not strong enough to overpower.  Good job there.

The babaganouj was strange.  Again:  tasted good.  But it wasn't very \"smoky\" and the consistency was almost buttery.  Both traits very uncommon for this dish.

The dolmas were excellent, but obviously straight out of the can.  Thankfully, very firm (just the way I like them).

The Greek salad was good, but nothing spectacular.  For a fast food place like this  --- and yes, I'm sorry:  I would classify this as a \"fast food\" joint --- it was especially good.

My partner said the chicken shwarma was good, but he was glad he had sides, because it wouldn't have come close to being enough for him by itself  (then again, if any of you have read my reviews, you know already that his athletically muscular build hides an enormous appetite ... one day, we went to a buffet and Godzilla was impressed with how much he ate! ... Pretty bad, when you can outeat a Japanese dinosaur).

Decor in the restaurant is nice, though, when it's crowded, it's quite noisy:  my loss, but obviously their gain ... they're not there to run an empty joint.  Seating, however, is VERY limited:  we saw two families open the door and leave shortly afterwards:  there's only 6 booths and 2 tables, so it doesn't take a lot of people to fill it.

Overall, if you have a craving for Mediterranean food and are willing to not expect a whole lot, then this place is more than acceptable.  But it in no way compares to the Golden Greek or any other \"real\" restaurant, regardless of whether the food is better or not."}
{"text":"Ordered 4 gyro to go. Would have been nice to have the sauce, or dressing included. Very disappointed after paying almost $40.00. The staff in nice, they should be more thorough when they bag to go items. The sauce or dressing makes the gyro!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered online which was a very easy process. I was able to add side items and pay online. we picked a time for pick and it was ready. The food was fresh, the chicken had lots of flavor and the pita bread was soft."}
{"text":"Came in the first time at pita kitchen  customers serve Arron was very nice he greeted me with a smile made me feel very welcomed in the establishment this place is very clean.The young man showed me what I had order before I walked out with my order to make sure everthing was there and that I was pleased on what I had order.The pita gyros that I order looked very freshed it tasted really good I also order the chicken lemon soup it was tanging and good .I will differently come back to try the other items on the menu.I did not dine in it was a take out order.But next time I will come dine in."}
{"text":"I'm sitting at home eating the leftovers of today's lunch. I got the gyro entree and my bf got the chicken schwarma entree...I have both leftovers. Delightful earlier today and just as good now. My only complaint is that I live 30 mins away. I'll be back in tho!"}
{"text":"Love there food the Greek fries and the lamb the rice is good. The beef is also very good i eat here once a month thats how good  it is"}
{"text":"We tried a Beef Kabob and Gyro combination as well as the Mediterranean sampler.  Both were very good.  Would definitely go back!!"}
{"text":"I'm often disappointed when I visit well-reviewed places, but not this time. The food really is amazing. I get the gyro and the meat is perfectly seasoned. The sauce is perfect."}
{"text":"Really good pitas. Meat is well cooked and seasoned. I usually get the Greek chicken salad. The dressing is very good and the portion is more than enough.  Small place, but I always find a seat. The people working are nice and courteous."}
{"text":"Call it Mediterranean or Greek food or whatever you like. The owner/ manager is Lebanese and this place has hands down the best Kabobs in Phoenix. To the Yelper complaining about the pita bread being fluffy- Sorry, but that's what you use for authentic Kabobs. Meat cut off of vertical skewers- again, these guys know what they are doing. I had the opportunity to have what are claimed to be the best Kabobs in Berlin, Germany ( yes, there are a lot of immigrants there) and these rank right up there. Add a manager who is hands on and  actually concerned that his customers are happy and you have a great place for fantastic food at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Chicken Kebab, Cilantro Hummus, and Greek Salad are my go to's. Great spot for lunch."}
{"text":"The falafel pita was ok, nothing special. The pita chips were soft and soaked with oil (I could squeeze out the oil). Overall it was disappointing. Pita Jungle tastes better and is healthier, and costs about the same."}
{"text":"Great people and great food. The man at the counter was very friendly and helpful. Not your everyday fast food joint. The food was delicious and fresh. And we are at the end of the night. I would go back, no question!"}
{"text":"I have now been to Pita Kitchen twice this week, I suppose that in itself says something.

Checked out this place for the first time when I went with a friend of mine on Tuesday, we went less than an hour before closing and still received very prompt and exceptionally courteous service....very awesome.  

Said friend and I both got the Gyro pita, generous portion and very fresh pita, it was definitely tasty.  The meat was tender.  Also inside the pita is tomatoes, onions, and taziki.  The onions could be a bit thinner in cut as it was mostly thick slices.  And the taziki which they are VERY generous with, is a little thinner than I am used to. 

Went again today with my mom, she loves Spanakopita, so was excited to find it on the menu.  It is listed as an appetizer, so I figured it to be small, and it was, but for the price of less than $3 it was still a good deal.  Again, I had the gyro and it was right on with Tuesdays visit.  *Note to self: order gyro with taziki on side next time, they are SUPER generous with it!

I don't know how the rest of the sides are, but they are generous with the fry portion, making the combo a very filling meal.  The regular fries are fine, pretty typical shoestring.  The greek fries are not as addictive as they are at My Big Fat with their lemon sauce.  However, they are still tasty.  They come with extra seasoning, some oregano and feta crumbles.  Sprinkle a little lemon on it and they are lovely.

What truly stands out at this place is the service.  These people are genuinely gracious and appreciative to the customers coming in their restaurant.  I don't know if it is just the first week excitement, or if this is how it will always be, but the welcoming demeanor of this place I have seen so far, on top of good food at good prices will definitely keep me coming back.

Welcome to the area Pita Kitchen, and thank you for bringing something new to this neighborhood in desperate need of variety and choices!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious! You have to get the pita bread chips; perfect balance between soft and crunchy. The gyro meat is seasoned well and tasty and everything was brought out fairly quick. I will definitely come back for more :-)"}
{"text":"I usually love this place but last time was really disappointing. I ordered to-go and they left out all my pita with the Mediterranean sampler, so I didn't have anything to eat with the hummus and baba ganoush. They also added WAY too much oil to the tabouleh! It was a thick paste. It's supposed to be a salad not a tapenade :/"}
{"text":"Best Greek food in town! They are always so friendly and their food is always on point. I would recommend this place to any of my friends. I'm sad I won't be in Phoenix anymore to enjoy this delicious food!"}
{"text":"Usually a pita jungle fan but this place puts them to same. This is some of the best chicken kabob and hummas I think I have ever had! Not truly a quick serve restaurant but worth the wait!"}
{"text":"I decided to try this place out because of all the fantastic reviews I read. The reviews don't lie, this place is wonderful. The place is small and very cute. When I walked up to order I was greeted very politely and the man at the register gave me suggestions since it was my boyfriend and my first time there. We both got the gyro one with pita and hummus and the other with the Greek fries(?). The hummus is good, I have only ever had hummus at pita jungle. Their hummus was much different but very tasty. The fries though! They were absolutely delicious. The gyro came in a warm pita, and the meat was hot and topped with tomatoes, onions and their fantastic tzatiki(?). I think the thing that upset me most about eating here was not having enough room in my stomach to eat every last bite. 

The staff is very polite, and the food is amazing. This place is now one of my  go-to places."}
{"text":"The gentleman greeted us right away, kindly explained the different sauces they had. Food was great ordered the 
Chicken Shawarma Pita:

$6.79

Chicken Breast Marinated in A Special Seasonings, Flame Broiled on a Vertical Skewer, Topped with Lettuce Tomato, Onions, and your choice of Tahini Sauce, or Garlic Sauce."}
{"text":"I came back and tried the Chicken Shawarma Entree.  The chicken was a little dry, but the flavor was outstanding.  All of the food here HAS flavor (unlike another Mediterranean restaurant in the area).

The humus was still a little grainy for my preference, but it has a great kick of garlic.  What to try next?

One request: Can you fix the wobbly table on the back left corner (as you walk in)?"}
{"text":"So, I rarely write reviews, because I am either always running late for something or I am just not that easily impressed I suppose. However, what gets my attention is consistency! When the food is consistently fresh, tastes good, and always better than you expect it or remember it, that is noteworthy. So, if you haven't checked this place out yet, then you're missing out. Take it from a natural skeptic. Keep it up PITA KITCHEN! A+++"}
{"text":"I love Greek food. I'm always up for trying a new place. I thought this location would be awesome because the decor was pretty but not so much.

The people are decent, and the scenery is ok, I'll give them that much. But it seems every time I go to this restaurant they ALWAYS get my order wrong. I've been here a few times and every time it's messed up. The food is ok, not the best. I feel 1 star is a bit harsh for messed up food so I suppose 2 will do. I'm not one to complain to the people who make your food so I just bite my tongue, and accept it as a loss. It's really annoying when you specifically ask not just a couple times, because of a food allergy, for it a certain way and it's wrong. I won't be spending any more time and money here."}
{"text":"Seriously this place is so delicious. This was my first time trying it and I ordered the chicken kabob plate with hummus (you can either get a side salad or hummus). It was soooooo delicious. From the way they marinate their chicken, cooked perfectly with their rice and hummus and pita bread it was soooooo good. I can't believe I've drove by this place so many time and I've ate at places surrounding it but I've never been until now.  I'll definitely be back and I recommend!"}
{"text":"I love Gyros pitas, I found out this place was for a while and didn't see it, so anyways... Took my wifey for some Gyro's and Greek Fries. She loved it , try the Blakava very tasty. I know some places have their Cons and Pros ... I go for the taste and service. That makes customers come back. This is my third time , and going for more... not to expensive the price is just right and fills you up. Check out the Pita Kitchen....."}
{"text":"My husband and I were in the area and we chose the Pita Kitchen based on its high Yelp review. Overall the food was very good; we ordered gyro and falafel pitas. The only reason I'm giving a four star rating is because the pitas came with very little sauce and when I asked for more, they charged us an additional fee. Overall it is a small, cute place and we will most likely visit next time we are in the area."}
{"text":"I had a lunch date with hubby and probly won't be back. Our meals were over priced for what they were. Not very tasty and for Mediterranean food flat on flavor"}
{"text":"First visit took place on a Saturday afternoon. The place was packed, and we were lucky enough to grab a booth. Walked up to the counter and ordered a gyro entree with Greek fries. The food came out 20 minutes later. It looked good, if a little lacking in terms of portions. Sadly, the fries and rice were cold. 

Sent it back and got the new plate in about ten minutes. The fries were hot and fresh, but somehow there was even less gyro meet this go around. Nevertheless, everything had a great flavor and was fresh. The house made tzatziki and vinaigrette sauces were a highlight. If you're craving Greek food and value quality over quantity, you might want to check this place out."}
{"text":"The food here is so good! They could use a bigger building, every time I go in the place is busy and packed."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite place to eat! The chicken shwarma is delicious and I always get extra pita bread to take home. They keep the place super clean and everyone there is very nice. They are very accommodating when it comes to food allergies as well."}
{"text":"Never a bad visit and i visit often.  Great service and delicious food!  Must try the Greek Fries."}
{"text":"This place is well-deserving of its rating. My wife and I were impressed.

For starters the staff is welcoming and exceptionally friendly. They seem like they genuinely care about customers and that is refreshing to see. 

The food is very good, but maybe just shy of outstanding. I did like everything I tried though from the Spanakopita to the gyros. As far as costs I wouldn't say it's a great deal, but the prices are fair and about average.

One thing I really loved about this place was that they actually played unique ethnic music. It beats the annoying pop music that the majority of places play and really added something to the experience. It was very relaxing and enjoyable. I am looking forward to returning for a second visit."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME!!! I ordered food and took some Sriracha Sauce with me so I could put some on my food. I ordered the Chicken Shawarma. Halfway through my place I noticed I never added Sriracha Sauce!!! Sign that my food was ON POINT filled with delicious flavor and didn't need added flavor. Very happy it's near my home!"}
{"text":"Great lil place we discovered on the way from So Cal to Sedona. My wife and I ordered falafel and we were not disappointed. Crispy falafel and yummy tahini sauce. Place was packed at 5pm. Didn't try all the items but I would recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"We had this for lunch at work one day and it was amazing! Thankfully they are located right around the corner from my job so I can enjoy whenever I want. The garlic sauce they put on the Gyros is amazing (there are different types). The staff is very friendly and food is served with decent timing. The dining room seems to get full fast but don't let that stop you! There's a few tables on the patio and if you have to take it to go it's still sooooo worth it!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here on our way to the Wildlife Zoo in Litchfield Park. I got the #7 (gyro combo) my daughter got the corn dog and Chris got the Gyro. Everything was incredible, THE best fries I've ever had in my life!"}
{"text":"Perfect! I loved the Greek salad with gyro and the hummus. Fresh ingredients and great flavor."}
{"text":"The food we had was good. I had the falafel & unfortunately I've had my share of dry flavorless falafel. So I was happy to take a bite of a well done falafel on the West Side of town (which is devoid of ethnic cuisine past Mexican food). My hubs had the gyro & really enjoyed the freshness of all the ingredients & tasty meats. He ordered the hummus & pita chips as well & the hummus was really good. So for all of these reasons I'm going with an A-OK review.
The cons were the .59 cent charge for a small side of tzatziki sauce. I was like OK this had better knock my socks off tzatziki for .59. The service was really nice up at the front but slow to serve & had to ask for the tzatziki. When brought to me it was the sesame sauce which was bitter city that comes with the falafel vs what I ordered. Also not so hot the pita chips. I'd recommend not ordering the pita chips unless you're trying to maximize your grease intake. Not pleasant in the least so avoid, avoid, avoid the pita chips. Having said all of that it's a local chain & the gyros, falafel & hummus are yummy so give them a try."}
{"text":"Great place. We were from out of town looking for a quick, clean, and tasty choice for lunch as we passed through Phoenix. The food was great and the place was packed (always a good sign that the food is on point)."}
{"text":"The food is really good the usual place I go to is all the way in Chandler too far. I Love Love Love their Chicken Shawarma Pita and their Greek Fries. I gave it 5 stars because their was nothing bad with it."}
{"text":"Best Greek food in town!!! Everything is made fresh, and it tastes delicious.  The staff is very kind and friendly. Place is very clean. I crave this food all the time, especially their chicken, rice and salad. Pita chips are out of this world! They are must try."}
{"text":"I'd say 4.5/5 overall because as they say on annual employee evals, \"there's always room for improvement.\" Additionally, 2 of the 3 times I've called in my order, I've been placed on hold for over 5 minutes. The second time resulted in me arriving in the parking lot prior to them taking my order.

Food is easily 5/5 though. Everything I've tried has been delicious. The gyros and Greek fries are the best I've had, not that I am a gyro or Greek fry aficionado or anything though. So, YMMV, but I don't think most people would be disappointed."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS!  We had quite a few different dishes. Gyro- meat was perfect!  Falafel - flavorful and crisp. Greek salad- big and fresh. Garlic fries- so good, flavorful with big chunks of feta. Beef schwarma with rice and veggies- BIG plate and so yummy. Jalapeño hummus- was full of flavor and extra creamy.  Seriously everything was amazing!  The staff was extra attentive and very friendly!  We only wished we lived closer.  Thank you Pita Kitchen!"}
{"text":"my first time to the Pita Kitchen . I had the beef gyro it was really good hot and fresh , large portions the fries were hot and crispy . brought my wife a gyro with chicken she loved hers also. if you are a fan of good food I definitely recommend pita kitchen . I could write down 10,000 word review but you will know it all with just one bite. met one of the owners Ramium he was really nice and very attentive made our lunch spectacular."}
{"text":"I love this place! Pita Jungle tastes like crap after eating here. They don't skimp on the meat, the food is consistently good. The people working there are very nice. The ice tea is better than the ice tea at Pita Jungle. I never go to Pita Jungle anymore. You guys get 5 stars for being so much better than a popular chain. I also love supporting small businesses, being a business owner myself.

They need to get better at being busy, because with food this good... they will be constantly busy. We ordered food to go tonight. It was good but not great like it usually is. They were PACKED, so our meal probably got rushed a bit. I think they are out growing that little spot. Time to buy the hawaiian place next door that is always empty and move in next to Chipotle.

1 good meal, many many great meals. Still a 5 star place in my opinion!"}
{"text":"I love this place though tonight was not a good night for them.   We waited a really long time for our food and then the foods was over cooked.   

3 of us ordered. . My son got his food...5 min I got my side of fries...10 min later I asked for my spouses soup...it was delivered 5 mins later.  Then 10 mins after he delivered the entrees. At this point my son ate all of his food as we just started.  

Salmon & chicken shawarma was over cooked.  It was dry and hard to eat.  The owner or manger was too busy having sushi with his girl to manage the kitchen 4 groups after us were served their food before it's was and the server didn't know what table got what food. That is my only complaint for them but will try again.  If I have another poor service night I may need to find another place."}
{"text":"Great family restaurant we've frequented since opening a few years ago. Always fresh.  Really busy on the weekend now which is great for them."}
{"text":"The Greek fries are amazing! Friendly staff along of we need anything. I had grilled eggplant, so good! Hubby got the gyros entrée, the cilantro hummus is excellent. 
I live in the central valley, so it's my first time here, but if I ever have the chance I am totally coming back!"}
{"text":"Today the young lady working the counter was extremely rude when I attempted to experience explain to her a situation I had my prior visit. I am a frequent flyer here at pita kitchen but with this hostility I probably will not be returning.  Please treat your customers with respect or you will lose them like me."}
{"text":"The food is really good here, but be prepared to wait. The last two times I went here I went with some people and I didn't get my food until almost 30 minutes after ordering. I ordered the chicken kabob. Great food, but awful wait."}
{"text":"LOVE this place.  Chicken Shawarma is the best I've had ANYWHERE.  Seriously...  I've eaten here maybe 30 times now and I've never been disappointed.  Only gripe really being sometimes you sit a while before getting your food but once delivered all is forgiven. Awesome owner too!    I think when out driving around the wife and I want to come ere more than any other place.  It just always sounds good."}
{"text":"The chicken kabob plate is always my go to for lunch or dinner!  Chicken is perfectly seasoned and very juicy!  I usually get the cilantro humus and half salad it's more than enough for one person at a great price.  I lo e that they have kid friendly items as well. The place is very clean and well kept and the service is excellent!  Very humble and accommodating!  I am always recommending this place."}
{"text":"Very good! I ordered the gyro entrée that came with gyro meat on a bed of yellow rice, with pita bread and a Greek salad. It was around ten bucks which I found to be a very fair price. The feta cheese on the salad was by far the best I've had. Usually, I just sort of deal with feta on my salad, but this was really tasty. Nice and salty without the odd bitter blue cheese notes of most feta. The food came out quickly, and the staff are all very nice. I found myself in tolleson by accident and yelp led me here. I would be back if I'm ever in the area again, but I'm sad to say that the drivers in the area of tolleson are nincompoops. The restaurant itself is small but clean and I had no problem finding a seat. Try them out if you're in the area and don't mind dealing with insane traffic."}
{"text":"The people who run this place are always super sweet and helpful!

I have had so many dishes there but my favorite is their tabbouleh salad.

A definite must try!"}
{"text":"Have eaten here a couple times now and it is really good. The service is great and they are always cheerful and helpful. Had the Gyro and Greek Fries and it was very tasty. Wife had a Greek Salad and she said it was good but not as good as the Greek Salad we have at the place in Goodyear we go to.

Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Not bad.  This place doesn't replace my \"fave\" Mediterranean food restaurant in Glendale but it does the trick if I don't want to drive all the way out there.  The place is a little small and if anybody has ever been in that area, the parking SUCKS so try to avoid going during rush hour if possible.  There are booths though, which is a plus if you have a toddler."}
{"text":"Let me start off saying they have a great staff. Everyone is friendly,  and very helpful. The restaurant was clean, and fairly quiet for being busy. Now to the reason I gave 3 stars. ...the chicken swarma was dry...very dry. It was also pretty bland for being seasoned with 12 different spices. I was only able to stomach a few bites, and that was all I could choke down. The rice was good,  the Greek salad was amazing. I won't be ordering the chicken again..and Im not sure if I would eat there again in general. 11.00 for a plate of dried out chicken, some rice, and a handful full of salad (although tasty a.f) was not really worth it to me. Oh well"}
{"text":"Came to the Pita Kitchen as a suggestion from Yelp.  The food was very tasty and came out of the kitchen fairly quickly.  

The atmosphere I felt while there was that of a cantina type of place.  The location itself is small,  and there were a number of customers there but not too much talking going on. Probably because they were too busy eating delicious pitas. 

I had the Grilled Eggplant Pita and for a vegetarian dish,  it was not lacking in flavor."}
{"text":"I had the gyros... so so tasty! And the tzatziki  is very flavourful.  Great choice. The service was fast and the lady was sweet ."}
{"text":"Hands down me and my wife's favorite go-to Greek restaurant in Phoenix! The customer service is great and the food is so good!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Everything is so delicious and the staff is always so friendly! I will definitely continue to come back!"}
{"text":"Food was good. Ordered take out. Got the gyro. Very simple and minimal ingredients as it should be. Very happy with the quality and customer service. The side salad was also very good. Garlic dip was excellent. Good value overall. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Their Greek salads are great! So is anything with their chicken shawrwa... shwawar... shawama... the chicken is awesome!"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good but we waited for 30 minutes only to find out our food wasn't even started. They definitely need new management and a new kitchen crew that gives a shit about their customers. I personally will not be coming back here again. Such a disappointment."}
{"text":"Tonight we dined here for the first time and we were not disappointed. 
FINALLY some place that serves really fresh and wonderful tasting food :)
I had the falafel wrap combo with pita chips and hummus. I loved the flavors from the fresh greens and the hot falafels. For me, I need more of the sauce because I like my wraps a bit on the wet side. I wound up eating it all , no leftovers :(
 My other half had the Shish Kabob platter with chicken and beef. Although he is not a fan of poultry  he found the chicken well seasoned, juicy and the marinade to be awesome.
And the rice... he's not a carb fan but loved it! 
We found everyone behind the counter very pleasant, helpful and cheerful.
Lots of interesting food items that I need to try for sure!
As one reviewer said \"Skip the burger and Go Greek\"! .....  Well, at least once and you won't regret it.
We're just sorry we haven't been in before now but we definitely  will be back.. again .. and again!
Thank You Pita Kitchen!!"}
{"text":"Food is exceptional, this is one of my favorite lunch spots! The staff goes above and beyond too"}
{"text":"Consistently good since 2013, amazing customer service, family owned business. I crave their food. Keep up the amazing work guys!! A+++"}
{"text":"Very busy place, in a shopping center area.  There's usually a bit of a wait, but the food is fresh and quite good.

Food:  Very good.  Well made, and good flavor.  My only complaint is that the hummus is a bit too spicy with the paprika they put on it.  Next time I'll ask them to leave that off.  I might be just a lightweight on the heat though!  :)

Service:  Awesome.  Very friendly, and attentive.  

The location is busy. There are booths and tables, but it can get hectic in there.  That is the mark of a good place to eat though!

It was a really good experience, and I will be back.  I'd certainly recommend it to others!"}
{"text":"The food here is incredible. My wife and love eating here. We always order the gyro and Greek fries. The Greek fries have so much feta cheese sprinkled on there that we use a fork to eat what is on the bottom after the fries are gone. Decent portions. I have tried many other Greek restaurants and this one is in my top two. I will be back."}
{"text":"I met a client for dinner at Pita Kitchen.  i ordered the chicken shawarma which is about $12 after taxes.  The chicken was old, dry and the lettuce was wilted. I advised the staff of the conditions of my food.  They agreed it looked dry and said they would replace the chicken.  However, the second serving of chicken was just as worse and wasn't edible. But I didn't want to continue to complain so I decided to just not eat it.  Later on that evening my stomach started hurting and I kept going to the restroom.  I called the establishment back and told them what I was experiencing and at this point I wasn't happy with my service or experience and would like to request a full refund.  The manager said they will have to check with the owner and let me know tomorrow.  The manager called back the next day and said the owner declined my request.  I advised the manager that it wasn't really about the money but about delivering great customer service.  I also told the manager that nevermind for the refund but I will be sharing my experience on Yelp.  I recommend Pita Jungle for great  Greek food as well as great customer service."}
{"text":"We had another great meal here. This is a fun place to eat and try something different. The trio is amazing.
The staff is great."}
{"text":"I love this place. The only problem is it can get overcrowded. I always order the chicken kabob meal w/ the cilantro hummus. Do yourself a favor order an extra pita bread & extra garlic sauce. If you're a mayo hater give the garlic sauce to someone else, they'll love you. One meal can maybe get you some leftovers. I personally prefer all the chicken dishes. The staff is always friendly & attentive. They keep up very well with the cleaning. If you have a craving for the yellow rice, the mahatma rice at Walmart is a good substitute. I will always pick this place over any other place in the area"}
{"text":"This place rocks. Definitely a regular at this joint. Usually get the chix kabobs with jalapeno hummus and rice or the salmon Greek salad. The chicken and salmon are cooked to perfection every single time I been there regardless if it's dine in or takeout. These people got skills and their garlic sauce is insanely good!"}
{"text":"The chicken pita was OK wasn't the best but the food was alright. I went there during their work a lunch hour with a couple of friends who suggested it been a good place... But some of our order was wrong and it wasn't even that busy at that time. I did not really like the taste of the chicken pita but I ate it anyway for sake of having something to eat."}
{"text":"I grew up with relatives from Syria, so this type of food is comfort food to me.  My hubby and I went to Pita Kitchen for the first time last week and I was delighted. We just had Shawarma Beef and Lamb pitas, although their menu included appetizers, salads and kebabs as well as pitas.  The pitas were fat and full of onions, lettuce, tomatoes and tsatziki sauce as well as tons of meat.  Their Baklava is also cut in big satisfying pieces and was really delicious.  We are going again as soon as we get a chance!  Loved it!"}
{"text":"So I've been frequenting this fine establishment for the last few years and I gotta say this place never disappoints. There service is amazing they're always smiling and making you feel welcomed and there food OMG there food beats the service which is impossible to comprehend but it does!!! I lve tried a few different items and have always left satisfied today however I went in with a different mindset as in I needed some comfort food. This is where Pita Kitchen excels, I ordered the gyros entree and Greek bruschetta, first time for the latter which came out 1st and I'm so glad it did because it was one of the most pleasant surprises I've encountered in any food establishment in a very long time. Soon after the entree showed up and like I said I've had it many times before but that didn't matter because it tasted like the very first time again which needless to say is pretty epic. I could write a novel and not do this gem of a place  justice so I'll leave with the tip that if you love amazing food and great service it doesn't matter what part of the valley you are in, it is definitely worth the drive and some."}
{"text":"loved the food came out hot and very very tasty. i will be back! just wish they had more hot sauce not everyone likes sriracha."}
{"text":"Awesome food! The spanakopita is amazing and the gyro egg rolls are so good and unique. You won't find them anywhere else! The chicken kabob plate is really good..love their tziziki too. Gyros are delicious and FULL of meat. Not many toppings on the gyros though. They are mostly meat. This place gets super busy so if you are wanting take out, I recommend calling your order in or placing an order online ahead of time."}
{"text":"The best Greek restaurant in a 50 mile radius! Better than Pita Jungle! 

I come for the tabouli salad and chicken skewers! Of course their pitas are amazing as well as the Greek fries. 

Every time I show up this place seems consistently busy which is a good sign they know what they're doing. The owner is very friendly and pleasant when I have came across him. Good to see his business is thriving! 

I will continue to be a regular costumer, you will leave here satisfied!"}
{"text":"Simple food, this place is great. Reminded me a little of Kasakhstan. Great taste to the hummus and the main dinner meal ... combo kabob was amazing. I live close to here and never stopped in because I love Rumbies too much. 

The service here is great and the staff are very friendly and mild mannered.  Great atmosphere, not noisy.....thank you.....and not crowded at all, came in at about 7:30pm. The music is very relaxing as well, can't forget that.

We will definitely be back. I want to try their gyros next time. This place will come highly recommended at work."}
{"text":"Good greek food. Not the absolute best hummus Ive had but it hits the spot when I have a craving. The rice was really good. But if I really want good greek, Ill go to King Gyro."}
{"text":"I've tried multiple Greek restaurants around Phoenix and Goodyear, and this is by far my favorite place! Greeted with a smiling face when I walked in and a friendly attitude. Got the Gyro Entree with pita bread and hummus, and all of it was spot on! Tons of perfectly cooked lamb and beef, pita was great and the hummus. I don't normally eat hummus, but I cleaned out theirs. Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Wow..what a miserable experience at this hole in the wall. Waited 15 minutes for a pita and nothing. Its coming they said, but actually it never did. Half of the kitchen staff walked out during the lunch rush due to stress and it was already 1pm. Got a cash refund and spent most of my lunch break waiting for nothing. Avoid at all costs...unprecedented."}
{"text":"I've been going here for years and I've never been disappointed. Stopped by tonight and they Staff is always friendly and accommodating and the food is always fresh and hot. Thanks for another delicious dinner!"}
{"text":"Good food.  Well prepared.  Had the cilantro Jalepeno Hummus with Steak and the Chicken Schwarma."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mediterranean food place but today was not the exception I usually order a chicken kabob and it's always delicious but  today it was burnt and not only that but we waited 40 minutes to get our food. I'm not sure I will be coming back!  I'm pretty sure the owners are no longer at this location!!! 
Truly disappointed!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Before I begin with my gripe....the food is delicious and this is why we USED to frequent them.  This is a warning to all who want to use entertainment.com coupons to buy one meal and get one free.  We have several entertainment books which gives us one online coupon per each purchased book.  We printed one coupon and immediately went to location for lunch.  Lady at counter called redemption phone # and told me it was not a valid coupon/#, meaning it had been redeemed. I showed her that it had just been printed and she insisted it was no good.  I got coupon back and I called the phone # on coupon and I was told it was a valid coupon/#.  I got back in line and told her such.  She then said she would call again and put it on speaker.  I told her \"of course it won't be valid now, because I just called and redeemed it.\"  And just like I said the recording said, \"this is not a valid #\".  So bottom line is, either she really didn't call the redemption phone # originally and lied to me or she doesn't know how to redeem coupons and doesn't follow the prompts correctly to redeem the coupons or punches in the wrong coupon redemption #.  We left and I used another coupon in Entertainment book and we went a couple of miles to Dysart Road and ate 2 for 1 at Greek Gyro Express where the food is just as great and you get free soups....chicken rice and lentil.  We won't be back to Pita Kitchen, as I can't trust them anymore.  I will miss the good food, but there are many other Greek/Mediterranean restaurants in our area that are just as good or better and they always honor our coupons.  I now feel they are running a scam, now using the coupons as BAIT and hoping you will stay there even when you are told the coupon is not valid.  We don't play that game with establishments that do business in a questionable manner."}
{"text":"I've had a lot of Greek food in my day, but this is currently in the running for \"best Greek\" in my book. The service is friendly and attentive and the menu is quite appetizing to look at. Once you make your selection, you're given a table marker and told that your food will be brought right to you. I appreciate this, especially since getting my daughter in a high chair is now my top priority at this moment. When the food comes out, the portion size will surprise you (in a good way) and the taste will exceed any expectations you've had. I've been there twice this week and I'll be sure to become a regular at this delicious Greek joint."}
{"text":"Good prices and AMAZING food. I love that there is a GOOD middle eastern place on the west side. I love the staff too as they do seem to really care about customers. Its a small place and does eat in and take out orders."}
{"text":"With Pita kitchen you can never go wrong Pita kitchen is on the Money Pretty much the best pizzas in town very reasonable good location fast friendly service"}
{"text":"This place is consistently great! And consistently busy! :) I wish they had a bigger location so more people could enjoy it!"}
{"text":"Always great food when I go. Definitely recommend this restraunt over other greek pita shops"}
{"text":"Great food, awesome service, reasonable prices. Been eating here since they opened. Always greeted with a smile and the food is fresh and flavorful. Probably one of the best Gyros I've ever eaten, and the Greek fries are awesome. Great for lunch or dinner, I eat here a couple of times a month."}
{"text":"I like this place too much.  Everything is delicious! Their fries are the best!!! I always have the chicken chipotle and it never fails!"}
{"text":"surprisingly good.  I wasn't expecting much.  I ordered the #1 which was the gyro combo.  It was delicious and very full.  My order taker was very friendly and helpful.  I will return"}
{"text":"I have been here three times and it is a very nice place and is the most reasonably priced out of all of the other Greek restaurants in the West Valley.... for vegetarians, I recommend the sampler with tabouli, falafel, stuffed grape leave, hummus and pita, it is really good, however if you are just looking for Baklava I recommend going to a middle eastern market as it is cheaper....  it has a nice atmosphere, even when busy and is the perfect place to go on a quick date or to stop in on a lunch break :)"}
{"text":"The staff here was really polite, nice, and attentive. Compared to other Greek places I've visited in the valley, I've received more food for the price that I paid for the meal here. So I wouldn't recommend splitting a meal with someone if you're both hungry.

I had the gyro plate and the gyro meat was good. I like that I got choice hummus as a side."}
{"text":"The Mediterranean Sampler makes a great vegan meal as does the falafel pita; both dishes were very flavorful and a great value.  While it isn't a full service establishment, after we ordered we were waited on by a caring staff.  It was obvious that this eatery was a family owned business because they were very careful to make every guest feel like they were cherished customers.
      We will definitely eat here again!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent prices!  We got the falafel and beef and both were delicious!  I'll be coming back here for sure!"}
{"text":"So let me start by saying I am a huge huge huge fan of the PK Original Gyros Eggrolls. Those bad boys are to die for. I ate all my Greek Fries, which is a huge thing, because I am the girl who picks at fries, eating a total of 3-5 usually. I ate almost the whole box. I didnt love the chicken shawarma pita. It had  like a tad too much nutmeg or cinnamon or allspice flavor in it.  Maybe its more of a Greek Style, but I was expecting something covered in Turmeric, garlic, cumin. Overall I can't wait to come back again. It was pretty packed so we just took it to go, but it was  cute place. Staff was all  very nice as well, offered us water while we waited."}
{"text":"Wow, we actually drive all the way from Goodyear for this fabulous food every Friday. However, it's not just the great food we love the owner Ryan and his sister Hannah who always make us feel like we're family. The chicken kabobs are outrageous and the baklava just makes every Friday night dinner perfect. Such a warm and friendly restaurant to visit. We are so lucky that we found pita kitchen."}
{"text":"It's rare to find a place that deserves 5 stars these days.  Food is great, owners and service is amazing.  Best thing is the hummus and pita chips!  We love this place!"}
{"text":"This is an \"OK\" Greek place, but no where near the best. Our last few trips have been a big let down and I forgot to call an tell them so I'll tell all: the salads are $10 for a small portion of ragged old lettuce and a few pieces of chicken here an there. The gyro my husband had was also skimping on portion and the pita was hard! Their meals are also pricey in my opinion and you'll get crap fries, compared to the alternative My Big Fat Greek."}
{"text":"Definitely a winner. We ordered a chicken schwarma and bruschetta because I was not too hungry and wanted to share. The food was more than enough and DELICIOUS! I'm not a fan of tomatoes but thoroughly enjoyed the tomatoes. 

The service is also exceptional, and I could tell they are appreciative of the business. We were happy to see the small restaurant was packed the entire time we were eating. Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Wasn't sure when my wife and daughter brought me here but after eating the food I was impressed!  Will definitely go back ."}
{"text":"Very good food. Never been before and the cashier was very helpful with recommending items, nice staff in general. I had the Chicken Pita with greek fries. Everything was the right temperature, great flavors, and looked good. I also enjoyed the Gold peek teas to the side of the drinks. The potion seems big to me but that's not a problem. Defiantly go if you want greek!"}
{"text":"Despite the other reviews, I thought the food was good. I gave it three stars because the wait is somewhat lengthy. I think it would help if they had more cooks in the kitchen. Probably not the place to go if you're in a pinch for lunch. Prices are decent. A little pricey for some dishes.

Update: they forgot about my order. Total wait time was 45 mins. Avoid this place during lunch hour. Changed to 2 star rating."}
{"text":"If it were possible I would give this location a hundred stars!!!! So worth the drive ! Not only is their food amazing but their costumer service is EXCELLENT! I'm amazed by this place so worth it !"}
{"text":"wonderful food. Great greek fries. Get them eat them ! All the meats are wonderful flavor. Pita or just meat plates are amazing."}
{"text":"Always awesome! Can be a little pricey but sign up for the text discounts and get 20% off. Food is great and the staff is also."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat!!! The chicken Shawarma is awesome! So is the salmon. Consistently delicious! I clean my plate every time!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The Chicken Shawarma is unbelievable and Gyro's are delicious! The staff is on point and good natured, they were super friendly to my daughter. I eat there several times a week. Check out their website at http://www.pitakitchen.net/ and then pay them a visit you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"I'll keep this sort and sweet.  There are a lot of Greek/Mediterranean places out here in the west valley but Pita Kitchen is the one worth driving down from Surprise to go to.  It's worth the trip every time!"}
{"text":"Love this place, they own a price of my heart, love the chicken shawarma and garlic sauce."}
{"text":"Best Greek food in the Valley!
I love their vegetarian items!
And the Greek fries are to die for!
Best falafels too! Great service, great food! Great hummus! Yummy!!!"}
{"text":"I can't think of a place in Phoenix with better chicken shawarma sandwiches and the Greek salad that comes with the combo is a great value with excellent dressing. We also like the tabouli and the spanakopita. We wish they offered iced tea but this is an otherwise great choice for lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"This sucks having to write this one! We have been customers here for years but recently every time we order from here whether it's carry out or dine in - they get the order wrong. Unfortunately if it's carry out the orders have been so messed up that a few of our guests can't even eat or flat out have most of their meal missing. If you are there you can request them to fix it - but even then they seem frustrated that you bothered them. If it's carry out they promise they will leave you a credit- they don't. Three times in a row with bad food and lousy customer service- that's enough for me. Sorry to see this happen was a great place."}
{"text":"YELP has never let me down... We are new to the area and was looking for a Greek place and so we consulted with Yelp and it brought us to this amazing place!!! Food is on point and prices are very reasonable.... If you like Greek food, you should definitely try this place and see for yourself why it is highly rated on Yelp.... Would definitely come back"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  The food quality reminds my husband and I of a sit down restaurant and is a great deal for the price! Wish we lived in AZ. We're making this a new stop from now on when we drive through town!"}
{"text":"Stopped today for lunch and this was our first time here. The large Greek salad and Gyros egg rolls were great .looking forward to next visit to try some other items"}
{"text":"Truly good Mediterranean food with consistent friendly customer service. Been here many times and nothing but a good experience."}
{"text":"I was excited to find a casual Greek restaurant close to home! But while the food satisfied my souvlaki craving, the experience overall was lacking. After ordering, it took over 25 minutes for us to receive our order. The chicken I ordered was dry, but seasoned really well. The sides were good, but I wish they offered Greek lemon-roasted potatoes. But that's neither here nor there. I'll probably be back when I'm really itching for Greek food and can't make it to my favorite spot."}
{"text":"Owners and staff are hella nice. Pita chips and hummus are fire. The gyro with taziki sauce is fire AF. No complaints. 100 percent"}
{"text":"We couldn't decide where to eat and finally decided on pita kitchen since it was the closest. We'd never been here and were a bit nervous since the last few Mediterranean/Greek places we'd been to were very disappointing. We ordered our food and the people here were super nice and the wait was very short. We ordered the #9 and 10 and they were amazing!! We will definitely be returning here for the delicious food!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best pita restaurants in the west valley. They have the best cilantro jalapeño hummus which is one of the reasons why I'm a regular customer. Their chicken shawarma pita is also delicious. The chicken has a great flavor and is perfectly juicy. I prefer it with the taziki sauce and feta cheese. I also add chicken to the hummus to make it even more flavorful. Definitely a must try!"}
{"text":"Big mistake trying something new on second visit! I had the chicken shawarma pita, chicken was so dry  and did not like the garlic sauce, also tried the Greek fries, not good, husband and I both did not like at all! The flavour was bitter, the fries and feta cheese was good just did not like whatever else was on them! Of course just our opinion, if in doubt please try and post your opinion, we all like different flavours, think I will just stick to regular lamb pita and regular fries, if we decide to visit again!"}
{"text":"The food in this place just DOES NOT disappoint. Although it's not as big as Opa in Westgate, the food is just as good if not better. Their service is just as excellent."}
{"text":"I had been waiting to eat here and I finally did yesterday! The food was soooo goood, full of flavor! The staff is wonderful as well, everyone is super friendly! I will for sure be coming back!"}
{"text":"Our first time here.  The place was packed and I had to have my wife grab the only table as it literally was cleaned off and I ordered.  There were people hanging out waiting for to go orders.   We ordered a gyro combo each and pita and hummus.  So the hummus was very good and the pitas are very good.  The gyro meat was a little dry and crispy on some of the ends.  The fries were fries.  Nothing gross but nothing special.  The price although not very high I felt could be a little less expensive.  However, we did leave very full.  I was kind of digging the mediterranean music that was playing in the place.  I think we would try it again.  The service was very friendly."}
{"text":"Went back a 2nd time this past weekend. Again really impressed. Really wish they would open in Goodyear!"}
{"text":"They have totally redeemed themselves from my last visit. I am so glad! Their food is seriously awesome, still and once again. Thank you to Rian, Raymond,  and  Mario the owners! The food today was like it always has been, awesome. The rice, chicken,  and beef were cooked and hot. The salad was great. We learned that they are getting, or have, a system to be able to order online at pitakitchen.net so we won't have to wait on the phone. I'm once again so glad that they have redeemed their 5 star status as they truly are one of my favorite restaurants to go for lunch."}
{"text":"We have been here several times. The food is always good, generous portions, and great customer service. I always get the Gyro Platter. My only complaint is the baklava isn't a very generous portion and although the flavor is good, it isn't the best I have had. We will definitely be back for the appetizers and entrees!"}
{"text":"Fresh. Delicious. So much flavor happening, glad they are not closer cause I would be here everyday."}
{"text":"Food is excellent.  Staff friendly, food prepared in s timely fashion.  Great cilantro jalapeño hummus and gyros are delicious.   Usually do take during lunch.  No tables available, however that's a good sign.  Since regulars revisit often for the good food!"}
{"text":"Probably one of my favorite Greek places I've tried. I've had the falafel and salads (the homemade dressing is great!) and have always been happy with the food and service! Gets a little busy around lunchtime, so occasionally there's a bit of a wait or hard to find a seat, but that's because it's so good! Another con is they are closed on Sundays. Overall, I love this place, and always try to stop in when I'm on that side of town."}
{"text":"BEST FOOD EVER!!! This place was the very first place my wife and I ate at when we moved to Phoenix and we've been hooked ever since! The staff is friendly and the owner runs an great restaurant! You can tell the food is cooked fresh when you order it and it's not sitting waiting for you to come. Recommendation: order online if you're getting takeout. Two thumbs waaaaay up!!!"}
{"text":"This place is not worth what they charge, its nothing compared to what the food is really suppose to taste like."}
{"text":"Being Middle Eastern, Lebanese to be exact, I'm always looking for a good place to have some good middle eastern dishes such as Hummus, tabouli, falafel, kabobs etc... and I finally found it here. Since my husband passed away and my kids are in their own I do not feel like cooking that stuff  just for me so I just get it from the pita kitchen. Its just as we make it at home.
The owners are usually here all the time during the week so the true test came today, super ball Sunday. I had some people coming over so I picked up some tabouli and hummus. Owners were not there so the staff ran the restaurant. I'm not going to lie I was worried but the food was just wonderful and exactly the same freshness and great quality as it is when they are there. Thumbs up to the PITA KITCHEN."}
{"text":"Pita kitchen is legit one of my top 3 favorite restaurants. Service is always fast & friendly. Not to mention the food is AMAZING"}
{"text":"This place had some of the best Greek food I've eaten. The fattoush salad was amazing and I loved their dolmas. Really inexpensive for really amazing food. Plus, the service is extremely friendly. They make you feel at home.
We got our food relatively quickly. The place was almost completely filled so I was surprised I didn't have to wait. I would definitely return here."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 10 stars If i could the customer service is beyond excellent and the food was amazing. The spicy sauce that comes with the kebab is definitely worth trying. Of course the hummus is excellent definitely a restaurant to try"}
{"text":"So worth the drive from El Mirage! The store is clean, the staff is friendly, and the food was DELISH! Best chicken schwarma since Doobie went out of business out in Mesa. We enjoyed a wide variety of dishes and a week later--my party of 9 is STILL talking about how good the food was. Going back this weekend!"}
{"text":"I have been waiting for a good gyro place in my neighborhood. Very good gyro!!! I had the pita chips and hummus for the side. It was so good I am tempted to come back and have just an order of hummus and pita chips.

I am looking forward to coming back and trying some of the other offerings.

Next time you're in the area, skip the burger and go Greek!"}
{"text":"Love the food here and the service is super friendly. I like to get my orders to go because seating is limited. Now I have to admit I have only had 2 things off the menu and I have been there about 10 times, however, in my defense when you find something you like - stick with it!"}
{"text":"On my road trip to San Diego, I knew I was going to get hungry and the excellent reviews drew me to Pita Kitchen. I ordered the Chicken Shawarma to go and was super excited to dive in, but there was one major thing missing. I had asked for the sauce to be on the side and instead there was no sauce whatsoever. I could tell the chicken was well-marinated, but without any sauce, it just was not the same. I was already too far from the restaurant to go back and ask for a side so it was a little bit of a let down to eat a somewhat dry pita. The chicken comes in a hefty portion which I can appreciate, but the lettuce/tomato portion was pretty minute compared to the overall portion of the chicken. I am sure the pita would have been delicious with the sauce, I just wish it hadn't been forgotten in my order."}
{"text":"Let me first start by saying I am a great lover of food.  I absolutely will only go someplace more than once if I deem it worthy and only Yelp places that are worth spending your money on.  That being said this place is phenomenal!  The owners treat every guest as family and I have yet to eat anything short of perfection.  My wife and I eat here or take out from here on a monthly basis of not sometimes twice in a month.  I highly recommend the steak shawarma and my wife is a big fan of the gyros!  There pita chips are AMAZINGLY and their Greek fries have left me dying for more on many occasions.  The restaurant is always immaculate even in their busiest of times and their staff is always friendly.  For an added treat don't forget to order a baklava.  It's doubtful you'll have room for it at dinner, but it's a great pick me up with an evening coffee after you blissful food coma wears off!"}
{"text":"Ordered 2 gyro pitas, being from Chicago I'm used to gyros SOO big that you have to take meat out of the pita in order to eat. This place gives small portions for what they charge. Wouldn't give this place another chance. Flavor was good, just don't get a lot for your money."}
{"text":"I love this place. My sister and I come here as often as we can. We order the Greek fries with a side of pita and hummus. Then for the main dish we have the combo chicken and beef with the rice and salad.   It's the best Greek on this side of Avondale."}
{"text":"I can never get enough of this place!  I've been known to come here for dinner and get myself the typical gyro and then order a second one for lunch at work the next day.  Be careful and possibly choose to forego onions on your gyro because the tzatziki is insanely flavorful and already sports onions...so you'll have a bit of onion breath the next day if you aren't careful.  LOL

Also, do yourself a favor and get the jalapeno cilantro hummus with homemade pita chips as your side instead of fries or regular hummus!  You won't be sorry and you will certainly thank me later.  

Every time I have been in, the owner is running the front register and is insanely friendly.  I love little local spots like this...especially when the food is on point every time and the people who run it are worth it."}
{"text":"LOVE, LOVE,LOVE this place. My sister and I ordered the gyro, a Greek salad and Mediterranean fries. All the food was delicious and everything was definitely fresh. Besides the great food the staff were the best!!! they definitely deserve to stay around so please support them! P.s. The place was spotless"}
{"text":"Excellent choice, we both had the Gyro Pitas and they are great, flavorful with a nice tatziki sauce. Definitely coming back to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"Really good Mediterranean food here. I have to say, I'm absolutely addicted to their garlic sauce. It's just amazing. I usually get two containers of it and then just drench every single mouthful in it. I actually went and asked the lady at the counter if she could share the recipe and she said it was a secret.. bah! Whatever dish you get here, trust me, get some of this magic pink garlic sauce - you won't regret it. Apart from that I usually get the beef or chicken. I'd vote this place second best Greek in Phoenix, with Greek Wraps coming out well in in front like they always do. I'd usually give a place I really like 3 stars, but Pita Kitchen gets a fourth for the garlic sauce. It is THAT good."}
{"text":"Great gyros, pita bread and falafel. Very friendly service and clean restaurant. Highly recommend to anyone looking for good Mediterranean food."}
{"text":"Amazing food - wonderful family!!

We crave the garlic sauce and the chicken shawarma will rock your world!!!"}
{"text":"This is amazing and great food! So so fresh and excellent flavors! We had the sampler platter - superb! I have never had such fresh delicious pita bread and the chicken schwarma pita was so full of meat and flavor! Cannot say enough and the service was also top notch!"}
{"text":"Meh.... I thought I was getting authentic Mediterranean and it's not, was a let down. Their hot sauce i looked forward to was non-existence what they had was  siracha and Tabasco ugh... 

Chicken shawarma had no flavor bland  basmati rice ok...nothing to mention about it. Got 1/2 hummus and 1/2 salad that was good but not worth 15 bucks for flat flavored food and the pita wasn't made it was package bought I bet... Cuz u couldn't separate it to fill."}
{"text":"Good food and good prices. Limited seating or it would have been 5 stars. Great for takeout."}
{"text":"I called ahead hoping to get my food right away.  It was ready, but I still had to wait in line for 10 minutes.  Then , after I paid they still didn't have my fries or drinks.  Took so long to make the fries my gyros were cold.

25 minutes waiting around total.  Wow."}
{"text":"After moving from New York City I didn't think I would find a good gyro like I could get off any gyro cart. This place is awesome and it's my go to whenever I get the craving."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and have always been satisfied with my experience and tonight is no different. The staff is always friendly, no matter how busy it is (and it's always busy) and are quick to offer suggestions. The food is fresh and full of flavor, although the shawarma could have used more paprika but I'm not complaining. The staff cleared the tables as soon as they were vacated so there was always seating available despite business being quite brisk. 

The only downside is the parking but it's not something that should keep anyone away. 

I can't recommend this place more emphatically.

Buy local!"}
{"text":"My wife and I moved out here to Phoenix,AZ  from California about 6 weeks ago. We are used to eating burgers and fries and tacos and decided to try something new. We came across the pita kitchen and from the moment u walk in the staff were great and made us feel welcome. The food was delicious for trying something new. My wife got the chicken shawarma and I got the steak shawarma in pita. We will definitely come here again!!! Mercy!"}
{"text":"We have been coming here since they opened. We were so excited to have a good Mediterranean restaurant open on the west side of town.  The service is always quick and friendly."}
{"text":"What an amazing place to eat!!!!!  Great prices and great food!!!  Staff is very friendly!!!  Best hummas and pita chips ever!!!!  I've tired other similar Greek places, but this is by far the best.  

The rice is my favorite!!!!  

Highly recommended!!!!

Opa!!!!"}
{"text":"The food is excellent. The problem is they have out grown the place their in. Every time I come it's packed  outside chairs full. I came close to leaving this last time having to stand in a corner. Oh yea their is no place to go to wait for seats. Let's expand already"}
{"text":"I moved to the west side and was sad to leave my \"famous\" gyro place behind in Tempe/south Scottsdale... Until I found this place.  Holy cow the food is good!  It's fast, fresh, and delicious!  The cashiers have always been super nice.  

I am normally not a French fry person but OMG, they are so freaking good!  I'm not kidding!  I recommend eating them right there, but I have even taken them to go and they have still been good 20 minutes later.  I don't know what they do!  

The tsiki sauce is really yummy too.  We have had the chicken pita, the classic gyro, the appetizer combo, the side salad, and those fries.  All were delicious!"}
{"text":"The tri-tip steak pita, Greek fries, and falafel are awesome. The pita chips are fresh, soft, and warm, and go great with the hummus. I'd eat here again"}
{"text":"Very good pitas! Portion size and food quality were good for the price. Great service, too."}
{"text":"Been coming here for many years. Service is always excellent. Staff is very friendly and attentive. Food delicious"}
{"text":"I love this place, the one thing we have been missing here in west Phoenix was a good tasty Med food place and with Pita Kitchen we have it now.. been there at least 12 times, and never been unhappy...."}
{"text":"Been back several times and love the food here. The only problem is getting a table, such a terrible plight for a small business:) keep up the great work"}
{"text":"The tables were very dirty and the staff seemed way to overwhelmed. The food was okay. I ordered the hummus and asked for a mixed platter of it. They acted like they couldn't split it at first. I would not come here again; I would rather buy hummus at the grocery store."}
{"text":"I had read good reviews on this restaurant.  I ordered the falafel pita.  The falafel balls were very overcooked, underseasoned, and very dry, hard balls.  There was no sauce.  I went and asked for tzaziki (sp?).  The sauce did not have the garlicky flavor to it.  There was certainly not enough to help moisten the balls.  I also had a side of jalapeno cilantro hummus.  It really needed more jalapeno and cilantro.  It did have good flavor otherwise.  The fried pita chips that came with the hummus were crispy warm, but very greasy like the oil was not hot enough to cook them.  I was very disappointed.  I was expecting more robust flavors  associated with Middle Eastern foods."}
{"text":"Pita Kitchen has perfected fries! It's the best fries I've ever had in my life, bar none. They're crispy and packs a lot of flavor punch. I got the Greek fries, but unfortunately can't have feta cheese and defeats the purpose. But, the staff accommodated my allergy. Imagine, if you do get the Greek fries like how it's intended to be, I think you'll be in heaven. Make sure you get the dressing in and on the fries, yum!

Haven't had anything else but what is mentioned above and falafel sandwich, which I had years ago and unfortunately think is not memorable. But give this place a chance."}
{"text":"Best gyros in town. Weekly visit is a must. The fries are great and the rice is awesome. If you are in town, this is the kind of place you better have. I know, I moved away from az and I miss this place and haven't found anything close to it."}
{"text":"Pita kitchen deserves another review. I've been coming here for 5 years and this places keeps getting better. I'll admit that in the past if you ordered a meal with special instructions, it might not come out the way, or missing items on pick-up orders. This doesn't happen anymore. Perfect orders every time. We love this place."}
{"text":"Came here on a Tuesday evening and the place was busy.(in a good way)..the staff was still able to bring out fresh delicious food in a flash.

Mario, the head chef, made sure that my experience was never to be forgotten. This place is simply off of the charts and several days have passed and I still can't stop thinking about the tangy tzaziki sauce and how fresh our food was. If I could give 6 stars I would. 

Easily my favorite Greek style restaurant. Thank you Mario, owners and staff!"}
{"text":"Pita heaven. Why when I have traveled all over the world did I not save the airfare and go to Pita Kitchen. What an unassuming place located in a strip mall but I guarantee you will be pleasantly surprised. There food is always fresh, hot and tastes great. Serving size is always very generous. I of course love the Gyro and Steak Shawarma. They have a complete Mediterranean feast available. We almost always get the mixed plate to taste it all. Take one guess where I will be eating tonight! Love this place."}
{"text":"I was in an area of town that I don't know well so, of course, I used Yelp to assist me with lunch plans. First, Pita Kitchen is super convenient - right off I-10 and 99th Avenue. When I walked in, the place was buzzing. In fact, every table was filled but fortunately, one group was waiting for a to-go order so my colleague grabbed their table.  It's a walk-up order situation. A super friendly smiling woman helped advise our order. She was hyper knowledgeable about the menu. My colleague ordered a Gyro with hummus and I got the mediterranean salad with chicken. We also got a side of jalapeño cilantro hummus. Wow! This hummus is flat out delicious and all servings were generous. We were served in a very timely manner, loved the food and will definitely go back when in the area."}
{"text":"Amazing food, great service. This is not fast food they cook everything fresh to order. Family owned, I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent service.

We were new to try this and was unsure of some of the menu items.  The staff was extremely helpful and nice.

We had chicken pittas with the garlic sauce.  Good sized portion.

We will return to try other menu items."}
{"text":"This place is really good.  Best Greek food in town hands down. I always keep coming back for more."}
{"text":"So i wish i could give this place two ratings.  The first rating would be 5 stars for the food. Had a greek salad and it was awesome and big could not finish it all. 
The 2nd rating would be the service. Took 30 minutes to get my food. This place gets packed at lunch time. I would call in my order prior as most people that came in after me got there food right away."}
{"text":"Been looking for a good gyros close to home for awhile. Hit the spot!! Better than Gyro Express in my opinion and the manager is amazing!"}
{"text":"This is one of those places I'm always showing off to people who aren't from Avondale. I am consistently impressed by their food and service. The only thing to dislike is that it gets BUSY at lunchtime -- try going at an \"off\" time and save yourself the wait. 

My boyfriend and I have ordered just about everything on the menu, and nothing disappoints. The Mediterranean sampler is a steal at $4.25 during happy hour. (They don't seem to advertise their happy hour, but I've been given 50% discounts for appetizers on a few occasions.) Their sauces and marinades are incredible. Be sure to try the cilantro jalapeno hummus and the chipotle sauce."}
{"text":"The food is okay, the service is okay, and the price is a touch high. All and all I have not been back and probably won't be. Nothing horrible...or even bad, but if I am going out to eat I want more than just okay."}
{"text":"This is an excellent family owned spot. Great, fresh food and it's really good! Everything I had here has been very good. I love the steak Shawarma with garlic sauce. The Greek salad is very good and fresh and is a very good substitute for the fries."}
{"text":"If you going there please order combo kabob the best dish  on the menu I would order it with salad. The pita is pretty good. Do give me about 15-20 minutes or so before  food is cooked."}
{"text":"I really like this place and can't get enough of it. As one of the few places that is close enough to my work for me to get there and back during my lunch break this is a true go to for me.

I tried the chicken shawarma my first time there and have a hard time convincing myself to try anything else since it was so goo. The flavors are fantastic and the chicken is moist and perfectly cooked. The portion on the plate is great too as it comes with plenty of rice and salad along with a warm pita and some tahini sauce.

I did try the steak as well and while it was still really good I wouldn't pick it over the chicken unless I needed a change of pace meal. 

The prices are right inline with what you would expect and I am always greeted warmly and with great customer service, I do take out a lot and the phone service is just as nice and orders ready when they say they are.

If you are in the area I highly recommend checking them out."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS! I have not had such good mediterranean/greek food on the west side since I moved to Arizona 10 years ago. The garlic sauce is simply TO DIE FOR! Greek fries are highly recommended, and the dressing that comes with them divine. Restaurant hummus doesn't usually impress me, but theirs is top notch! Creamy, smooth, with a hint of garlic. The meats were well marinaded and each had its own unique, distinctive flavor.

How to improve on perfection? Our entrees each came with a single pita bread. I might suggest offering two pitas with each meal. One was not enough and two would be just about right. Baklava was excellent. My husband - who is half Lebanese - remarked that it tastes just like his dad used to make.

And here's the kicker... Here you can get two large, homemade-quality meals for just about the same price as fast food. This is going to be my go-to place for picking up dinner on my way home from work. Bravo!"}
{"text":"Place was hot and nasty! My chicken gyro was tasteless, chicken was dry. I won't be returning. Not worth the wait nor the price."}
{"text":"Cheap and delicious. What more could you want?

Pita Kitchen might possibly be my favorite greek place in the valley. I dont know why Ive only tried it now. Upon walking in, you go straight to the counter to order then find yourself a table. Food came out in good time - around 10-15 mins. Everything I've tried was so delicious. All the hummus came with warm, soft, and pillowy pita bread (the cilantro jalapeno hummus was especially yummy. Not too spicy). The meats were soft and flavorful. I love their entrees cause you can try out several types of food in one meal. I got the steak shawarma plate and you can customize it to your liking. Mines came with the meat, rice, cilantro jalapeno hummus, pita bread, and garlic sauce. 

Oh...THE GARLIC SAUCE. I can't explain how good it is. Get it as a side for anything you order and dip all things in it. Its amazingly good and might be my favorite thing on the menu. Its a good dip for pitas, meats, greek fries...everything! And it's only $0.50!"}
{"text":"This has become my favorite Greek food destination. The food taste so fresh. The staff is super friendly and attentive. The place is so immaculately clean you can eat off the floor and if you go at lunch you may have to because people have started to find this gem and it gets busy. We had to share a table with strangers one day because there wasn't a spot left so I hope the expand. Everything I've had has been wonderful and I literally dream about their hummus. My husband loves that he can have a beer but we can still get in and out in 30 min. They don't skimp on portions at all and I often wish I had shared with my husband. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I brought my son here a month ago and we have seen huge Improvements Thank you Risas Dental"}
{"text":"Always Fresh and Always good


I have always enjoyed eating at Pita Kitchen, the service is exceptional and you always leave wanting more. 

The serving sizes are generous. Today, my friends and I ordered the hummus for an appetizer, and we split a few Chicken Chipotle Pita Wraps. If you like hummus at all, you need to try it, you won't be disappointed.  If hummus isn't for you Pita Kitchen offers a wide variety of entrée selections. There are  salads and great desserts.

The service is always friendly, courteous, and the food is always fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"Had a gyros sandwich to go. The gyro meat was 1/2 burnt and half of the sandwich was filled with onions while the 2nd half had none. Restaurant wasn't even busy.."}
{"text":"I'd seen this tucked into the corner of the shopping center for awhile, and finally tried it. Not sure what took me so long, the food is fabulous! Tried the chicken shawarma. Home run! Tried the falafels, home run! Staff friendly, establishment is very clean. I'll be back! Often!"}
{"text":"Wonderful Mediterranean 'fast food'.  The gyros are wonderfully flavorful and packed full of well seasoned meat.  Garlic sauce is an option on the pitas and highly recommended by this reviewer.  Portions are plentiful and should satisfy the heartiest of appetites - split a combo meal if you are a smaller eater.  Service is wonderful and they really seem to like their customers and their business.  

Would be a regular at this place if we lived in Phoenix."}
{"text":"This place is in a very busy shopping center small restaurant with about 15 tables.the food tastes and looked really fresh and really made to order a bit expensive but I guess you pay for good quality that's why I would definitely be returning soon."}
{"text":"Quick, friendly service. Clean tables. Ordered the greek salad with chicken. I loved everything other than the spice, which I think was allspice on the chicken. Just not my something I care for. Got a side of tzaiki for my pita bread and it was wonderfully light,  fresh and delicious. Friend had the gyro, that was good as well. Will be back to try more menu items. Wish they had a chicken gyro though."}
{"text":"Excellent food.. Great people working behind the counter.. The pita are always fresh and there is never a long wait for your food. And the owner is almost always the one taking your order."}
{"text":"Definitely will come back again, I had the chicken Chipotle pita with Greek fries on the side and it was delicious! ! (:"}
{"text":"We waited for over 20 minutes for a simple gyro and steak shwarma combo with fries. There was also 5 other groups waiting for their food also just as long. The staff seemed more concerned about filling some to-go orders from a couple of customers who came in afterwards and left before us before we even received our food. The meat on my gyro was warm but was not seared crispy. The tzatziki was bland, little onions/tomato, and the pita bread was falling apart. The chicken shwarma was dry but had some flavor. Greek fries were good but was thrown off by the serving bowl it came in. I swear they stole the bowls  from Ghenghis Grill."}
{"text":"Great vegetarian options, everything I've tried was amazing. Staff is always kind and accommodating. Everything always taste very fresh, the vegetables always have a nice fresh crunch."}
{"text":"Nasty nasty nasty. Tastes like pre-made lunch room food. No offense to the staff they are great. The food is just not good it tastes like a chain. Not very fresh and overpriced"}
{"text":"I would have given 5 stars but the wait time is a bit long."}
{"text":"Yay! I'm a fan is an accurate description.  Great food at affordable prices.  I love the lime cilantro hummus and the gyros are terrific.  Definitely stop and eat.  You will know that you had Greek."}
{"text":"I'm at Pita Kitchen at least once a week, it is seriously that good. Their chicken entrees are really good if you've never had Mediterranean food before. The hummus is really good not sure if the pita is made there or if they buy it pre-made but it's good I always feel like you can't have enough. 

If want to play it safe and try a little bit of the best just order the Combo Kabob entree, and get the hummus instead of the Greek salad. You'll thank me later. I don't know if I should be reviewing the gyros since I'm not a very big fan. The first time I was there I had Chicken Shawarma pita, it was really good, but I'm not a big fan. So I've never had them again not saying it's bad or anything. 

The owners are also friendly the man which I think is the owner is always very polite and is whiling to explain anything. It seems to be family owned which is nice to still see."}
{"text":"This place is great!!  The food is very good and the prices are reasonable.  I could eat Greek food everyday.  And for fast, healthy and tasty Greek food, this is a great spot.  It's located in a strip mall at 99th and McDowell, and the atmosphere isn't anything fancy. But it has great food at a good price and that's all I'm looking for for a quick and healthy meal on the run.  I love their beef kefta and their tzatziki sauce!"}
{"text":"This place is so delicious. I have gotten the chicken kabob and the chicken shawarma so far and man this place is fire. 
Always clean and homie in the front has great customer service. 
I love this place!"}
{"text":"Maybe I came on an off day all four of us just thought well its food . nobody finished there plate and the servings aren't huge ,not that need to be . to be honest maybe it just wasn't our style food, everyone was really friendly tho .   and even better the owner reached out to us by message to see exactly what they could do or better understand the problem. no problem just think it wasn't for us . how ever major points with me for reaching out some people just don't care !!"}
{"text":"This place was delicious, the food portions are perfect and is extremely flavorful! It seems family-locally owned and I love that! Keep it up!!"}
{"text":"Amazing Greek food! Shwarma Chicken plate is delicious! Staff is super friendly also! Great place for a quick lunch stop."}
{"text":"This cozy little place serves monster pitas! I love going here on my lunch break! I always get the chicken chipotle burrito and dip it in a side of hummus. Also, add the avocado for 1.50! Totally worth it! Have left every time full and satisfied. The owner is awesome and the entire staff is friendly. Definitely worth the visit and makes living in the west valley so much better! Top of my lift for sure!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for some Mediterranean comfort food and boy were me and my wife impressed! Our first couple of experiences eating here where so so which left me apprehensive about eating here again. Today's customer service and food where absolutely fantastic and I commend them for the excellent presentation of their dishes and the overall taste. I love Cane's (especially the Cane's sauce) so I will have some tough decisions to make in the future."}
{"text":"Great place quick and easy! The chicken kabobs dinner is absolutely a must try. Flavor of the chicken and the sauce and salad blend perfectly."}
{"text":"Great place.  The restaurant is on the smaller side, but has great atmosphere.  I've had the gyro, gyro egg rolls and a side of hummus and pita.  Everything I've had here has tasted amazing.  Probably one of the best places for Greek food in the valley and for sure one of the best restaurants in the west valley.  I've been multiple times and left satisfied each time."}
{"text":"Understand that for me to give something five stars the experience has to be flawless and though I'm not giving Pita Kitchen five stars it's as close to five I can give without pulling the trigger! 

To start there is a fair amount of seating and the place was extremely clean including the restrooms. They take great pride in the cleanliness of the eating space but a glance into the kitchen proved the care was for every space. 

Drinks were coke products and teas. I love Coke Zero but went with the fresh brewed tea and what really impressed me were the fresh cut lemons. This might seem trivial but I respect attention to detail. In any Mediterranean eatery you can't mess up the hummus and Pita Kitchen does not. Smooth and full of taste the hummus was obviously made by someone who knows what they are doing. 

Now the food: we ordered appetizer hummus, lamb gyro, and chicken shawarma (the #4 on the menu). The portion size was huge and included A LOT of meat. Transitioning into the source of the four star justification comes from, admittedly nit picky, the meat being a bit dry for my liking which also took away from it being tender. 

Again admittedly, gyros and shawarma should be meat heavy. Having said that, some more vegetables and sauce could have masked the meat just a bit more. The pita however was great and not to thick or thin. 

Overall my impression was for a great change of pace from burgers and pizza this is a solid option with no disappointments. We will be back to try some of the plated meals next! Nice find in the West Valley!"}
{"text":"Awesome Food!!! Tried their Steak Shawarma n Greek fries they were famtastic great flavor...my son orded fried pita goodness they were good!!!"}
{"text":"This is basically a lower scale version of Pita Jungle with better prices and IMO just as good of food. The service is quick and the people are friendly."}
{"text":"I did not enjoy the food. Had the gyro entree - meat had annoying aftertaste, rice was bland.  Fries were pathetic.  Greek salad was excellent.  Don't understand the high reviews they have rec'd."}
{"text":"I've always been a cheerleader for the Pita Kitchen. Their gyros and chicken and/or steak shawarmas have always been amongst the best in Phoenix, complete with service with a smile.

My only complaint previously was the tap water. It was awful, BUT it's been fixed, and now the water is filtered and tastes just fine. 

I ventured out and tried something new on the menu: the chicken shawarma plate, and I'm glad I did. It was fantastic, and filling, and worth it's price. The cilantro hummus it comes with is excellent as well. I think I found a new favorite item. I'll continue to drop in the Pita Kitchen from time to time."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! Great food, friendly staff and generous portions. Grab a friend and experience some fabulous Mediterranean food. They gave us samples of some new Grey Mist teas they were considering today,  not planned just impromptu.  How awesome is that??!!"}
{"text":"All I have to say is, \"Steak Shawarma Pita and $7.\" Enough said. Okay I will elaborate a little more.

Pops and I were hungry for some lunch and the Yelp World led us here. It was a bit of a hard sell as my father claimed to not like Greek food. After I told him he could get steak and fries he reluctantly agreed. Upon arrival, we were both greeted by the nicest staff member. She was outgoing, helpful, funny, and above all, a great start to our lunch experience. 

So as mentioned, my father and I both got the Steak Shawarma Pita with fries. The pita was full of steak that was tender and juicy. The sauce inside the pita was on point. For the fries, they were crunchy and flavorful. Overall, a killer meal, especially for the price.

Lastly, my father was so happy with his meal that he agreed to try some baklava for dessert and again, the food was on point.  And I don't even like baklava.  I will be back to Pita Kitchen again for sure and bring more family with me. 

Five star lunch spot!!!!!"}
{"text":"One of the best Mediterranean/Greek restaurants I've eaten at! They're gyros are stuffed with meat & their cilantro jalapeño hummus is fresh! Try the fries- light & crispy! I was very full & pleased with my meal. I would definitely recommend and come back again!"}
{"text":"Brand spankin' new place on the west side.  I was excited when I saw the word Pita because that automatically brings goodies like Gyros and hummus to mind! 

I was greeted with a smile by the guy behind the counter.  The menu isn't big, but there is a good selection of Greek deliciousness.  I went with \"old faithful\" and had a gyro.  I decided on the hummus and pita chips as my side (you can choose from the hummus and pita chips or fries)  The hummus was good and the pita chips were very tasty.  Not too crunchy and not just warmed bread.  

Now to the gyro.  Uh...\"I believe I ordered the LARGE cappuccino! HELLO!\" (If you get that movie reference give yourself a flying knuckle bump with a massive explosion at the end because YOU ROCK!  This thing was HUGE! Fully loaded (I chose no onions because...no me gusta raw onions) with tomatoes and a very flavorful tzatziki.  The pita bread was perfect and didn't fall apart as it has at other establishments.  

Very worth the money and very close by!  I'll be frequenting this and now I have more to choose from on 99th and McDowell on my way home!"}
{"text":"The food was good, service was excelent, this place just opened last week and so far so good.  I had the Chicken Shawarma with fries, lean chicken, needed more sauce but that's an easy fix.  The fry's tasted just like McDonald's which is a good thing! Prices were pretty good too!  Glad to finally have a Greek Place in the West Valley."}
{"text":"This is a small place but great pitas and hummus. Cutely decorated with reasonable prices and friendly service. I like it much more than Pita jungle. Seems family run which I like as I like to support small business owners. A must try location in my book."}
{"text":"So friends brought us to Pita Kitchen.  I can't tell you how many times I have passed it but I won't make that mistake again.  Everything was so delicious.  I had the Gyros Pita.  It had beef n lamb.  So very good.   We tried the egg rolls and they were very flavorful.   It was an awesome meal.  For $30 for two of us it was awesome!!!
I'm a believer !"}
{"text":"Seriously phenomenal Middle Eastern food. Like ridiculously good. Eat here. Order the Greek fries. Thank me later. 

This is a little hole in the wall on the corner of 99th and McDowell (same plaza as Hobby Lobby) but located in the smaller strip of stores at the other end of the parking lot. Looks to be run by 2, maybe 3 guys. I've eaten my fair share of Middle Eastern food and this is some of the best I've had in Phoenix. The garlic sauce is awesome. I can't even guess what's in it but I'm sure unicorn blood is involved. 

I had the steak schwarma and hummus and hubby had the chicken souvlaki. His chicken was so perfectly cooked that we couldn't decide if it was white or dark meat. It had the flavor of white meat but was moist like dark meat. The hummus was delicious and it had a bit of a kick but it wasn't overly spicy or anything. It was all delicious and came with generous amounts of pita bread for dipping. Prices were reasonable for the portion sizes and the Yelp check in bonus was a 10% discount off of the bill.

Service was super friendly and helpful and we will definitely be back. Well done gentlemen. Glad to have found you in the West Valley."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants. The owner is very courteous, truly cares about his customers, and goes out of his way to make sure everything is right. The food is excellent, healthy, and flavorful. There are many vegan options. The tabouli salad has great flavor. The fattoush salad is also very good. I love the eggplant gyro--I was skeptical at first about how the eggplant would taste, but the way it is made, it has so much flavor and a great texture. The falafel gyro is great, as well. Another favorite of mine is the mediterranean sampler, which consists of hummus, pita bread, dolmas, and falafel. Their pita chips are wonderful. I also recommend the Greek fries, of which I have them leave off the cheese for me."}
{"text":"This was a random stop for last minute dinner. Was the best decision ever! I had the gyro pita with the greek fries OMG was it good!!! Not only was there food excellent there service was also the staff was very sweet and welcoming. Ive recommend this place to all my friends and family already"}
{"text":"update: i made my husband go back because we were so disappointed.  he received the sauce, pita bread and a new gyro without onions.  while it was inconvenient to go back, the staff was apologetic and seemed sincere.  we all make mistakes and they truly did everything to rectify the situation.  i thank them for doing their best to make it better.  we will go back for the great food, just hoping they make sure it's right the first time from now on."}
{"text":"This place has the charm, character and flavor of a small shop you're much more likely to see in a place like New York City than Phoenix and I always enjoy eating here. Such a great place. It always makes me feel good to eat there. 

A small shop with reasonably priced, healthy, fresh, delicious food served by a friendly small business owner. 

I wish there were 100 more places like this in Phoenix."}
{"text":"The food is excellent! Not the largest menu, but I am certain everything on it is delicous. A must try if you are in the area, perfect for lunch. I had the chicken pita and the spices and sauce were quite good!!!"}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting and only my second time having Greek food.  I was a bit apprehensive, but happy to say I was pleasantly surprised.  The service here was prompt, polite, honest and friendly.  I was amazed how quickly everything arrived, but there was definitely no sacrificing quality for speed here, everything tasted amazing.  It was hard to believe everything tasted as good as it did for the price.  I'll definitely be coming back... And soon."}
{"text":"Delicious chicken shawarma pita!!Great customer service. Staff is very friendly and quick."}
{"text":"Guess what I try the Gyros and I got hook.  Fresh and tasty.  Home like environment. They also provide you with free refills and WiFi.  What a deal,  Give Pita Kitchen a try you Got nothing to lose."}
{"text":"Everything was awesome. Tried the cilantro hummus and it is worth getting it Togo. The owner walked around and asked how it was and was ready to clean off the tables. Very clean environment as well."}
{"text":"yummy gyro and the greek fries are the best anywhere!! its like a garlic oil they put on the side of the fires and i love it. that what separates them from the other round for sure."}
{"text":"I love going here to have a Gyro. I wanna try the chicken skewers one day but the gyros have a hold on me. Most plates are under 15$. Staff is friendly. Good luck trying to find a good parking space."}
{"text":"Our new local greek joint!
the gyros are well made, the lamb is cut just right.  The chicken schwarma is on point and the jalapeño cilantro hummus is outrageously delicious
The owner of this place is really a nice guy and the prices are great!
Thanks for the 10% off when we checked it too!"}
{"text":"First impression very busy during lunch. The lady at the cash register was able to provide a recommendation which is a plus in my book. Casual atmosphere and clean. The lady told me they've been at this location for two years. I guess I've passed it up several times. I am always over here shopping at Old Navy and Justice for my youngest. 

Now for the food. It smells delicious! It is enough for two people. It was a little salty for me but everything is salty since I've been pregnant. The rice was perfect with the exception of a few hard pieces but that happens everywhere. 

The lady came out to check on me. I'm now starting to think that she is the owner. I couldn't eat it all. I felt bad because I was wasting food. Nevertheless I will return. I'm interested in tasting the other items on the menu. I'm anxious to try the humus. I love a good humus."}
{"text":"This place is A-OK. A solid 3 stars. I travel a lot and admittedly I'm a tough critic when it comes to Greek/Mediterranean restaurants. I usually order the same thing (the Mediterranean Sampler, i.e. vegetarian mezze platter) at every place, so I have a pretty good gauge on these things...

That being said... This place is good, especially for where it's located. But nothing really stood out as over-the-top AMAZING. However, I'd be happy to go back. 

Portion sizes seemed on-par with the pricing. 
Service was slow but friendly.
Food quality (i.e. taste, freshness, etc.) was A-OK.

You won't go wrong going here - but it's not a standout experience. Just good ole' Greek food in a fast-food setting.

My partner ordered a Greek salad with salmon on top. It was all prepared well - but again, very basic and nothing that stood out to us."}
{"text":"I was driving through Phoenix and was looking for a place to eat.  I actually saw a sign waving person, and was totally excited because I was CRAVING Greek food for  a while.  Firstly, this place is awesome because they have AC which is a bonus in Phoenix.  Secondly, they have free wifi, and thirdly they have a yelp check in deal...im sold!  Most importantly, their food was  really good.  I ordered a combo kebab and a \"spanakopita\" and both were really delish!  The pita here is nice a warm, and the meat was flavorful and juicy.  The spanakopita had a great flaky crusty.  I really loved the sauces here too, the garlic sauce was an excellent addirion ro the kebab.  I also have to give major props for the service.  The person who took my order was really friendly and totally made the experiecne wonderful.  If i ever go back to Phoenix, totally stopping by.  Thank you Pita Kitchen!"}
{"text":"I'm not a hummus fan but there hummus might have changed that i had the cilantro hummus. The sitting area is small and was packed while we where there. The food was great in the top Greek places I have ever eaten."}
{"text":"Delicious food and truly delightful workers. One of the workers noticed I was almost out of their delicious sauce and offered to bring me another! Didn't even know I could get more. Love this place"}
{"text":"Pleasant surprise. Didn't expect much since it has a bit of a fast food vibe (e.g., order at the counter, soda machine, etc.) but the food is really good. Excellent Tadziki, flavorful Gyro meat and nice warm Pita. We will definitely be back, much better option than the other places in the area."}
{"text":"The staff was friendly without being overbearing, the restaurant was very clean (even the high chairs were wiped down!), and the food was great!  Casual dining at its best!"}
{"text":"Realllllly good med food ! The chicken shawarma is good, and the veg medley is too !  I like the hummus also."}
{"text":"So, when my husband & I started going to pita kitchen.... we were so impressed. Delicious. Presentation was clean and lovely. We were dining in and carrying out 3 to 4 times a week. Hands down our most favorite place to dine.
But, then....... something changed. A change for the worst. Shwarmas are dry, hummus is all botched and mixed together. Appetizer tabouli is no longer fresh and flavorful. We're both so disappointed. My husband was recovering from stage 4 esophagus cancer and this was one place he'd still crave. Not anymore. Cold & Stale meals now. Slimy soggy cucumbers, even pitas took a turn for the worse. Did you change owners or what???? What a bummer.
Thinking maybe it was a fluke. We tried a few more times but nope huge change. Not even the same seasoning or style since around January 2017.........."}
{"text":"Came here today. The staff was excellent. They came and checked on us 3 times. The food was great. Best gyros on the west side. I hear the Greek fries are amazing. We will have to try them next time."}
{"text":"Chicken shwarma entree was awesome! Garlic sauce really unique. Our server Jackie was very friendly. We need a Pita Kitchen im California!"}
{"text":"New resident of AZ from Houston TX and was curious about Mediterranean food out here. I saw that there were crazy reviews so me and my hubby and kids went. Staff was really nice and helpful, prices are reasonable. I ordered the beef skewer no.10 which was good. The seasoning was good, the Greek salad was great. Just that the steak was a little tough, was cooked a little too long. Other than that it was ok"}
{"text":"My husband loved this place so much, he went twice in 1 day.  He went there for lunch.  When I got home from work and said I was too tired to cook, he offered to pick up food for dinner.  

I got the combo dinner (gyro and chicken).  I am a fan of the chicken, hummus, and pita.  The gyro meat....NOT so much.  I am never a fan of the gyro always."}
{"text":"Not a huge pita guy buy the chicken shawarma was superb. Definitely would come again."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! In all fairness, I can't quit eating the Greek salad w/chicken & avocado long enough to try anything else on the menu -- but it all looks sooooo good!!! The portions are generous, the food is always fresh and tasty, the service is quick & friendly. Hubby & I are hooked!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite Pita place! I tried all the other gyro restaurants and this is the best! Ramon, and his family have 2 restaurants... give them a try!"}
{"text":"Omg! This place is BEYOND good! It's AMAZING! Prices are great, employees are Friendly, nice and clean. Food was fantastic! Will come back for sure! You have to try it at least once and you'll be hooked!"}
{"text":"We needed a quick, casual meal before dropping the car off for service. Thanks to yelp Pita Kitchen was just what we needed. Local business, great Greek food, all at a reasonable price.

I had the Greek Salad with chicken, my partner had a Chicken Shish Ka Bob. Both were excellent and ample portions."}
{"text":"Excellent food, especially the chicken shawarma.  The atmosphere is friendly and casual. The staff are super attentive, friendly, and professional. Almost always busy here, especially at lunch.  The hummous is also really good and the Greek fries.  My favorite Mediterranean place in AZ."}
{"text":"Yum-O!!!  Or Yum-E!!  Both would sum up Pita Kitchen.  I love anything with the word Greek or Pita in it.  We started off with the crisp Greek salad that had yummy feta, tomatoes, onions and olives (next time I will ask for extra olives as it made the salad). Then our steak Shawarma and fries came out.. and was I ever happy to see it.  It was a large portion and packed with a flavorful steak that was not chewy in the least.  I can't say enough about this steak, you will just have to try it  The sauce was perfect and we did get a side of tzatziki sauce for sipping upon request.  The pita was soft and together with the steak, perfect!!  The fries were cooked with an amazing crisp and also had great flavor. FIVE STAR FOOD BABY. 

It is nice inside and the service could not be better! It was all over a great meal and we will be returning many times in our future.  Make sure to check in you will get 10% off."}
{"text":"You must try the jalapeño-cilantro hummus.  It's so good!  I've had it with and without meat and I like it best with chicken. Yum!  I am a bariatric patient and requested cucumber in lieu of pita bread; only $1 to substitute. The customer service is A+."}
{"text":"Long wait times. 30 min last 2 visits ..people coming in after my group received their food (some orders are same dish as mine). Turns out they forgot to plate mine. And not sure why. I was very polite, respectful. Waited in line and paid like everyone else. Then I saw the girls at the cashier point at me and laugh after I asked for my money back. Not professional. And definitely not impressed."}
{"text":"This was my husband's favorite meal here so far (he's more of the Greek-food fan).  We ordered the Steak Shawarma Entrée:  \"Thinly sliced Tri-Tip Steak, Marinated in Our Special Mediterranean Seasonings and Broiled on a Vertical Skewer.  Served with Rice, Pita Bread, Garlic Sauce, and your choice of Greek Salad or Hummus.\"  We chose the Greek Salad option and it was great!  He'd want to come back here again next time we're in town.  The servers are very nice, the place is clean, popular but there are just enough tables where you don't actually have to wait for one, and the food is prepared very quickly."}
{"text":"Met friends here for dinner a week ago. Staff was friendly, place was clean, and the food was good."}
{"text":"This place is great. The food is done right and the owner knows what he's doing. Hope this place grows and stays around for a long time."}
{"text":"First time here. Ordered the Grüben. Like a Ruben with chicken. Delicious. Couldn't be happier with my lunch choice."}
{"text":"I dig this place! Everything I have tried here was very good! The exception might be the hummus which I found to be slightly bland but it was totally edible and I am pretty picky about hummus! The Greek fries are awesome too!"}
{"text":"Great schwarma and rice. Tasted as good as haji babas or princess deli in Tempe. Glad to have a place like this on the west side."}
{"text":"My Sister and I were looking for a semi - healthy option in the area and found this place. So happy we did!! The food is consistently good and if I dare say it, the cilantro-jalapeno hummus is better than Pita Jungle!! I will keep coming back :)"}
{"text":"Great gyros and dolmas. We've done both carry out and dined in and had good experiences."}
{"text":"Glad I found this place ... Salad was outstanding, very fresh NOT like the bag lettuce you get elsewhere...you can tell quality is important to them and it shows...nice job !"}
{"text":"I was at a seminar on this side of town, saw this place had good reviews and decided to give it a try (plus love supporting small business). I got the Mediterranean Sampler, and it was delicious. I am picky about baba ganoush and theirs was awesome. Their falafel was actually probably the best I've had. The place was packed, I got a table almost immediately but every table was occupied (good sign). My food came out within a few minutes - I think the owner was helping food run, and was quick at the end to notice I needed a to-go box. The customer service was excellent and notable - really upped the experience. This casual restaurant is definitely worth a try. I actually think I will be returning today to try the kabobs or fatoush salad. Yes, it's breakfast right now, and I am already thinking about lunch. :)"}
{"text":"Pita Kitchen is HANDS DOWN the best new Mediterranean  in town.  Secondly, it knocks the socks off of every other place on the west side  The restaurant was spotless, beautifully/tastefully decorated, comfortable and classy.  Moreover, the food was savory, fresh, juicy, zesty and perfectly put together.  With all of that, I was shocked to see how inexpensive it was.  The service was also extremely efficient, friendly and quick!!!  Most of all the owners clearly run their business with integrity and pride, and it made me VERY happy to support them given that they've created the perfect \"everyday style food\" restaurant!  MY MOM DOESN'T EVEN LIKE LAMB, AND SHE SAID IT WAS THE BEST GYRO SHE'D EVER HAD!!! That's saying something!!!  :-)"}
{"text":"Love this place, GREAT food and by far the best customer service i have  ever experienced. They make you feel like you have been their friend for years even if you'd only just walked in for the first time. The Greek Fries are AMAZING!  . This place is a real gem."}
{"text":"The food is great and it's a very clean environment.  The food takes forever to be made, not sure why.  Fresh veggies, pre-cooked meat, on heated bread.  Sandwich shops have that done in less than 3 minutes.  Other dishes sure, I'll understand on the time."}
{"text":"Was actually craving a gyro, came to try this place. Used the yelp check-in discount of course, but still bummed. I ordered the gyro combo(lamb gyro, reg fries, and a drink) and still ended up paying $9. It was good, but could've gotten that same plate for around $6 bucks somewhere else; plus they gave me a lil amount of fries, I giggled. Maybe should've tried something else, played it too safe. There were a lot of patrons in store and it was almost closing time. Will try the hummus and other entrees next visit."}
{"text":"One of my FAVORITE places to eat.. Staff always friendly, food is always amazing! I love the Gyros Pita with some garlic sauce on the side."}
{"text":"Surprise!  Great salad plate her. Vegetarian and if you skip the yogurt - vegan. We were surprised. Fast middle Eastern food."}
{"text":"Great spot for med food. The lemon chicken soup was a nice treat. The gyro was very good. Meat seasoned well and taziki is a nice add. Service and environment was good. 

This is my spot when in the west side of PHX."}
{"text":"I had falafel plate with Greek salad.

1 falafel with no flavor, small salad too much onion.

For $10 after 10% yelp coupon it wasn't worth it."}
{"text":"I come here way too much! But I can't help it! Best Greek Fries...EVER! Since fries isn't exactly always health, the Greek salad definitely holds me over. I work at a hotel down the street and always recommending guests to stop there for food!"}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere, and great service for casual dining! Best quick Greek fix!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!!!!! Best and most authentic Mediterranean food I have had in Phoenix. I have had everything on their menu and it is all delicious! Downside is they only give you one lil thing of sauce and you have to ask for more, easy to rectify."}
{"text":"Excellent food, value, and service. The Greek salad with chicken is all I have had, because I keep ordering the same thing. Multiple hot sauce options, very fast, and such good quality and quantity. Not sure how anyone would be dissatisfied! Also the guys working are very pleasant."}
{"text":"We had the chicken shawarma, jalapeño and cilantro hummus with pita bread and the Greek garlic fries (with Feta cheese). The chicken shawarma comes with a variety of dipping sauces, I chose the garlic sauce. The garlic sauce is delicious. We love the food here and plan on returning. They offer a 10% discount for Yelp check-ins."}
{"text":"Best beef gyro I've had in a while. Very clean with super friendly and attentive staff. On a moderately busy night my food arrived quickly and with a smile.  The Greek fries are outstanding. Great spot in the west valley."}
{"text":"This is by far the best Greek restaurant in the valley. And I would venture to say the best restaurant in the west valley. Fresh delicious great customer service. Welcoming atmosphere."}
{"text":"Omg, this is sooooooo goood!!!!! Today was my first time eating here. I had the chicken chipotle gyro and my side was pita chips and hummus. The food came fast, and it was hot and delicious!!! Everything tasted fresh and authentic! I love this place!!!! I will definitely be coming back for many more times!! First time I tried a new cuisine and I actually liked it!!!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious. The garlic sauce on the side tastes amazing with just about everything you order. The service was amazing. I was waiting in line to ask for a side of garlic when one of the servers passing by asked me if there was anything he could help me with and I said I was waiting to order the side of garlic and he said he would get it for me so I didn't have to wait in line. Very helpful staff. The hummus was delicious so was the falafel wrap. The veggies were very fresh. The servers were very efficient. The order was on time. Good place to try. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Clean and friendly environment. Saw the Greek fries on the scrolling menu which caused me to be interested. My husband ordered them an they are AMAZING!! I heard about falafels so I had to try them plus I really wanted a gyro! 2 meat plate was the solution! So excited to have tried this restaurant!!"}
{"text":"So it is 7:30 PM when I order my food revived it at 7.45 not bad. There were 2 other tables dining in. They seem to be more of a grab and go. I have seen 3 people pick up food to go and there are 3 more waiting. 

Cleanliness it is not very clean. As I look around there are 2 tables that have crumbs on the tables and chairs. I had to wipe down my own table and the sign they gave me as an order number was gross. I used a napkin to touch it. I actually thought of leaving but I allready paid so I am going to try it. Notice my plate had finger marks from oily gloves I assume. 

Food. 
4 out of 5. It was good and I would come back if it was cleaner. I know they want to keep cost down but I would pay more to eat at a clean restaurant. As is I will not be back."}
{"text":"For the price I could not believe the quality I was receiving! The Greek fries were excellent and the gyro pita could easily feed 2"}
{"text":"This restaurant wasn't bad. Our server was very efficient and greeted us upon arrival. The restaurant atmosphere was alright. I will say the servers work quite hard. The food is very fresh. I have been here before. I do feel it has improved. I would recommend this restaurant for anyone. They offer a variety of dishes. The restaurant is very clean. I look forward to trying this again in the future."}
{"text":"This place was great!  Service, food, atmosphere were all wonderful.  The staff was really helpful and courteous."}
{"text":"Where do I even start? The people? The food? The service? ALL amazing. Thus my go-to spot for all of my friends and family. This is truly the Greek gem of the West Valley!"}
{"text":"Pretty good.  The meat is fresh and flavorful.  I'd given it 5 stars if the pitas were a little more flavorful but all together a good Greek place.  Inside is clean and the service is fast."}
{"text":"This is our second time coming here and each time we were blown away from the excellent customer service and delicious food! The chicken Schwarma was exquisite according to my husband and my falafel gyro was amazing! I also liked that there were Greek beers available.  we are definitely going to be regulars here."}
{"text":"we are never disappointed at pita kitchen everything is always on.. From the kabob to the gyros and the appetizers.  I always rotate what I order because I can never choose a favorite.  Even my super picky husband loves it here and it's always his first choice. The cook in the back is always friendly and the lady in front always asks us how our meal as. all of their staff has been friendly and we have never had bad service or bad food. I just wish they could get a nother location or a larger location because lunch time is grinding time!! Always busy and yummy I wonder how they don't run out of food!!! Perfection!"}
{"text":"We have eaten here a good 4-5 times in the last few months and I believe they have been listening to their review to fix smaller issues. I absolutely love their food and the wife does too. We have tried a few different plates and have no real complaints as of yet. We can usually get out of there with 2 dinners and a app. for under 35 dollars so the price point is less than some of the competing Greek joints in the Goodyear / Avondale area. This seems like a family run joint and the service has always been fantastic and I always feel super welcome when I'm here. I have had no issues with absurd waiting or problems with my order. This is a great joint on our side of town and I would suggest it to my Yelp buddies."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in over a year and this place still rocks.  5 star, still the best Gyro's in town."}
{"text":"Great food and friendly service.  I ordered the chicken pita w tzatziki and Greek fries and it was SOOO good!!  The Greek fries came in a large bowl and could have fed the family. The herbs on the fries were delicious!  We were there on Mother's Day and the owner, I believe, have the mom's a complimentary piece of baklava which my daughter devoured."}
{"text":"My family stopped in for the first time today and were really surprised in how dead the place was. The portions were huge and the food was yummy. The fries were just okay but the gyro and the schwarma were great!"}
{"text":"My wife and I came here based on the reviews for dinner close to the hotel we were staying at.
 You will not be disappointed!! The deep fried gyro egg rolls are a must try!! I would go back just to get those!"}
{"text":"We love this place. This is our #1 to go for Greek Food. The gyro salad, pita chips and hummus, Tabouli Salad... YUMMILICIOUS!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. I have never had pita chips like these and quite honestly...I am spoiled now!  Everything we had was wonderful and we made sure to let the guy who runs the place know it!  Will definitely revisit!"}
{"text":"This is the best Greek restaurant I've been to in Arizona. Besides the food, the service is second to none, and the place is always very clean. It's well worth the drive, no matter what part of the Valley you live in."}
{"text":"I eat out a lot and this is my all time favorite food joint. Because A.) The food is AMAZING and B.) Everyone who works here is equally AMAZING
When I wait for food they offered me water? And I just had a mobile order? 
Everyone that works here is very polite and so kind? I have never had a negative experience here..
Sometimes there is a bit of a wait time.. But you can't rush perfection."}
{"text":"Soooo good!  We stopped by after reading other reviews.  Had Greek fries, falafel, chicken kabob, gyro meat, chicken schwarma, steak schwarma, regular hummus, jalapeño hummus and salad.  All were really good.  The jalapeño hummus is AMAZING and chicken kabobs were our favorite meat (although all were very tasty).  Service was fast and friendly.  Restaurant was clean and welcoming.  I especially appreciated the two small bible verses printed on the wall inconspicuously."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch after a day working out in the West Valley for a change. I had seen all the positive reviews from my fellow Yelp Elite friends, so I thought I'd give it a try. 

I can say that from the moment you walk in, you are greeted with excellent customer service. This place could easily be just any typical Mediterranean place, but what makes it better than average is the friendliness and genuine care the staff shows you right off the bat. I ordered the Greek Salad w/Gyro meat. While it wasn't the absolute best I've ever had, it definitely wasn't the worst. Their tea options are also pretty awesome so skip the soda and go for the more delicious and healthier option!

Still not convinced on the customer service? This is a place where you walk to the front and order and they bring the food to your table. The employee that took my order came over when I was done just to ask how everything was and for feedback if there was anything better they could have done to enhance my experience. For that alone, I will be coming back if I find myself in WV again!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat on the westside. It does take some time to get your food but in my opinion it's well worth it! It's a bit pricey but you do get a lot of food. Always very friendly staff."}
{"text":"I don't know what sort of seasoning they use for the chicken and steak shawarma, but I thought it was disgusting.  The gyro was decent and the baklava was ok."}
{"text":"Reimun from Pita Kitchen did everything to make the situation better,  Today I tried the #8 chicken and hummus!  Delicious....and Reimun made sure that everything was perfect!!  Will come back!!  Thank you Reimun!"}
{"text":"This place has the most amazing food and service. Their gyros are by far the best we have found in Phoenix . And their Greek fries are so addicting they are a must have when you visit this place."}
{"text":"Very good some the best pita I've had. Try the veggies if you get any of the dinners, they are well worth the price."}
{"text":"Love love love this place, has the best Greek food in town. Try the Greek salad with gyro meet or the traditional gyro !!!!"}
{"text":"This was my favorite place to eat their  chicken Greek salad was the best!! And my girls loved the pita chips! However the last time I was there the food just wasn't the same! It will not be my first pick like it used to be."}
{"text":"We love coming here to get our favorite gyro combo.  Add the Greek salad the dressing is excellent.  Also try the pita chips with hummus.  Don't forget to finish off with the baklava."}
{"text":"Came here last summer on a whim while visiting a friend, and I was hooked. I live in Phoenix and bypass other Greek eateries cause this is the BEST. Very tasty food and I keep coming back for more"}
{"text":"The decor inside isn't anything fancy, but once you get past that you are greeted by a friendly smile. They have Greek music playing thru their speakers which adds a nice touch. It was nice and cold in the restaurant which is exactly what you want on a summer day in Phoenix. I got a gyro and it was packed with meat and had nice flavor. Overall a nice place for lunch."}
{"text":"Hummus was excellent. Falafel pita was subpar it said garbanzo mixed with cilantro. Cilantro overpowered it. The pita is very messy and tends to break apart."}
{"text":"This place is small and gets busy real fast. Parking kind of sucks due to the location. I had the falafel wrap and it was pretty awesome, not too dry or over-cooked."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb; always fast, and always delicious. Not to mention it has a great atmosphere with friendly staff. I feel like family when I walk in this place. A must visit!"}
{"text":"best staff, clean place, open kitchen, amazing food, great prices... five stars!! can you make it six stars? I'm getting hungry as I'm writing this review!! the gyros are sooo good, the meat is tender and the hummus is so amazing!! the rice is great! I rarely stray from the gyro cause it's perfect!"}
{"text":"Took the family for dinner on 9/18. We had the pita salad with gyro meat. The salad was delicious and the pita bread was amazing. The seating was fairly full and they had a steady stream of take out orders. Will go back soon!"}
{"text":"I was definitely a fan.
The location is kind of a biscuit to get into because the parking lot is always crazy packed.
Inside it was fine when i went.

I got the gyro as I always do at Mediterranean places. 
Also rice and salad....

I liked it and will go back."}
{"text":"This place is great.  The grilled vegetable medley never disappoints, and their greek fries are the best I've had.  They don't just give you dry fries with small feta sprinkles, you get small square feta chunks in with your fries.  They also use some kind of vinaigrette that's really awesome."}
{"text":"Amazing gyros. Great service. You won't be disappointed! There service is great and they offer takeout."}
{"text":"We have been to this location several times since they opened. Everything has been delicious. All of the ingredients are fresh and taste homemade. It's a bit crowded during the weekday lunch rush but their online ordering system is great. I highly recommend trying them out. Their gyros are just as good as the ones we get back home in Chicago."}
{"text":"Pita Kitchen is one of those hidden jewels in the west valley. The Chicken Kabob entree is one of my favorites. If you are looking for great food and service, dine at Pita Kitchen."}
{"text":"So disappointed to see the Gyro salad did not Taste the same We love your salad but for some reason today the gyro meat was very unappetizing and the salad didn't taste the same please fix your food we love your Restaurant. We live in north Peoria and we don't mind driving all the way but if your food taste like it did today then next time we won't. The tabouli and fries still good though. And when we order the tabouli to go they put very small amount i had to say we ordered large tabouli, this looks like a small, then supposedly they went and put some more. There is one person that always puts good amount and one person seems to give less."}
{"text":"My favorite Mediterranean restaurant in Phoenix. They are not always fast but the food is consistently good."}
{"text":"Hubby and I love gyros, and we read the great reviews, plus this place is close to home.  We went in one evening, and I will admit, the place was immaculate and the service was great.  Everyone was nice and kept checking up on us.  The gyros were okay.  I enjoy tomatoes in my gyro, and at first, thought there weren't any.  After a bit, I realized they were flat on the bottom.  The tzatziki sauce tasted a bit generic.  The pita was very nice.  We both got salads with them, and they were alright.  Not sure if we'll go again."}
{"text":"The cilantro hummus was absolutely delicious, glad we stopped in to try it out.  It won't disappoint."}
{"text":"Finally! Our search for great, fast, authentic Greek is over! We had the hummus with gyros & chicken with more than enough soft, warm pita bread; not over salted, and just enough bite to clear your sinus'. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"The owner takes great pride in his restaurant and it shows. He is always pleasant and has a smile on his face even though he works seven days a week. Everything on the menu is delicious especially the chicken Schwarma and  the homemade pita chips and cilantro jalapeno hummus. Skip the chains and go to this establishment. Best of the best."}
{"text":"Always good! Service is fast and always friendly. Food is really delicious and always filling."}
{"text":"So, back to Pita Kitchen I went this past Saturday.  This time with my mom, step-dad, and Baby C!  We ordered and sat down at a table.  

I got the same thing as my visit on the 20th - Gyro pita and greek salad.  
This time the Gyro was NOT greasy.  Very tasty at that.  The Greek salad again was awesome.  

My mom ordered the same thing as I and thought the food was good.  And my step-dad ordered the chicken souvlaki.  It came with rice and salad.  He liked it so much he almost cleaned his plate!

Seriously good food here!  So good that Baby C enjoyed some Gyro and chicken!  :)"}
{"text":"I have gone here numerous times, and have never had a bad meal. 
The staff is friendly, and they are always busy, so you know the food is fresh."}
{"text":"Okay, so I've been a little hesitant to come here as there is a pita place a little closer to my house. Needless to say, it's awesome. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is it needs more seating and the music is a little loud. Now the food, that's a 4.5 star...lol over all you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Called to order a whole bunch of food for a dozen people. Gave a variety of things I wanted, paid over the phone and was told it would be ready in thirty minutes.  Arrived right at the thirty minute mark and they were just finishing up packing two large bags with all the food.

Took the food home and unpacked, very large servings, tasted great everyone was happy and full..  Lots of compliments and people asking for the name and location.

Overall, on time, pleasant and helpful people making excellent food.. Doesn't get any better.."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE. Owner is super nice and always attentive. Service is quick and I've never been displeased with my food. My go-to is the chicken Greek salad which comes with a warm pita. So simple and so good. Portion is huge and always fills me up. Often times I'll just get the pita chips and hummus. Definitely a must have there because it's so yummy! I've had the gyro's a few times and the are always good! Nothing to complain about here. Definitely my favorite place to go when I used to work in Avondale."}
{"text":"Ok, these guys NEVER have a bad day in the kitchen. I suspect some sorcery, come on give me something to complain about guys!"}
{"text":"The service is amazing and the food is always delicious! The cilantro jalapeno hummus is mouth watering paired with lightly fried pita chips-delicious. I will say that I have had alot of Gyro meet in my life, but this is the best bar none. My kid has been eating here since they opened 3+ years ago and she crys when we don't take her at times LOL 4 year old with a sophisticated pallet!"}
{"text":"This place IS the bomb!  I tried it with my bestie strictly on a whim based on successful Yelp reviews and I must say that this has far exceeded my expectations!!!!!!  I ordered the chicken shawarma pita and Greek fries ( it was my first time having them) everything was so good."}
{"text":"Started visiting due to convenience. Continued patronage due to amazing food and excellent service. Yeah, it's a small dining room. Yes there are usually few places to sit for how busy it is. But a restaurant that made me appreciate hummus and be a bit more adventurous with my dining selection is well worth the wait."}
{"text":"Really great lunch. I was waiting for some car work to finish and decided to grab a bite. Naturally I checked my yelp and found this place with great reviews.

For a small place this was HUGE flavor. Their tzatziki sauce was delicious on the gyros pita I had. Good hummus and pita chips were a welcome substitute for fries.

The lady at the front taking my order was great, made me feel like I was getting food from her home kitchen. Tasted that good too!

One of the better Greek places I've been to. Great spot for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"Always fast and friendly service, even when the place is packed! I frequent this place with my mom for lunch all the time! Gyros are best I've found! I recommend everyone who like gyros to give this place a try you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Very good gyros with lots of meat and fresh pitas. Don't forget the garlic sauce...it's the bomb! Very nice people and pretty fast service...sometimes we call ahead."}
{"text":"FINALLY! A Greek/Mediterranean place that has great food, friendly owners and above all is on the WEST SIDE OF TOWN!  This place was a bit hard to find since we are not familiar with the area. It is located in a strip mall on the southwest corner of 99th and McDowell.  My wife is more of a Hummus fan than I am.  It's how she gauges a restaurant, well this was a different Hummus altogether.  It isn't exactly a spicy heat but there is a spice/seasoned kick to it so if you're not use to that then take it slow. Their Hummus is dotted with Mediterranean spices with a drizzling of olive oil and sprinkling of paprika and their pita is soft and warm. This is awesomeness on a plate! 
Just as she gauges a restaurant by their Hummus, I gauge it by their Gyro meat.  I ordered the Gyro platter ($8.99) and it came with a perfectly seasoned beef and lamb that was also served with pita, Taziki and your choice of a salad or Hummus...go for the Hummus.  If you do, then you can save a little by not ordering the Hummus appetizer.  Oh and the Gyro rests on a bed of wonderful basmati rice.  This meal is substantial!  Their portions are generous to say the least. We also ordered the Greek Fries which are French fries that are sprinkled with feta cheese, parsley, and usually olive oil, but I think there was not only olive oil but also an acidic component which added another layer of flavor.  
Next time I go I am going to try the Calamari and Grilled Eggplant wrap.  The Grilled Eggplant wrap is ($6.49) and has grilled slices of eggplant, grilled Italian squash and grilled green peppers & onions with romaine lettuce, tomatoes and your choice of marinara sauce or taziki sauce.  Any choices can be made into a combo too. 
So will my wife and I go again? Absolutely!"}
{"text":"Ate dinner this week at Pita Kitchen based on many Yelp reviews.   Everything about this restaurant confirms the Pita Kitchen's five star review status.  We had a large Greek salad, a steak schwarma pita sandwich,, and Greek Fries.  The food was excellent, the service friendly and helpful, and the prices very reasonable.   Each of our entrees was quickly and well  prepared, was well seasoned, and attractively presented.   The Greek fries with feta cheese were the best french fries we have ever eaten.   We will return to the Pita Kitchen every time we visit the Phoenix area.   The Pita Kitchen is family-owned and operated.   They earned our five star recommendation."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! It's authentic and delicious. I actually crave their hummus and pita chips. So good!"}
{"text":"I must say im BEYOND amazed of the FLAVOR!!! We got The Chicken Chipotle Pita & Jalapeño Cilantro Hummus & Baklava (which we had to get another order beyond ridiculous filled with flavor) and had to save the last for THE BEST GREEK FRIES EVER!!!! If you haven't tried this place you MUST! Also the Staff is beyond nice and welcoming!! If I could give Pita Kitchen 10 stars I would!!!"}
{"text":"Pita chips and hummus yum yum! My three year old even loves it.

They are all very friendly, I'm never disappointed. 

It's a small space and can fill up quickly.

Suggestion? Order it to go."}
{"text":"This place has really good food! I love the Gyro egg rolls. They  are really good.

The chicken kabob taste excellent! I will go back again to try something else. But I recommend people to try it."}
{"text":"Are here because of the good reviews. My gf and I were not impressed. The meat (steak and chicken) were overcooked. The Fries are amazing though. I would come here if you wanted some really good fries but definitely not for the gyros."}
{"text":"nothing spectacular, but you can't take away from the fact that they have good food. Location kind of sucks, but you can't win them all"}
{"text":"Loved it. My families favorite was the Spanakopita , The Mediterranean Sampler was superb.  Their home made hummus is famtastic. My family and I will definitely return to explore other dishes off their menu."}
{"text":"Amazing! The food was great and the service was friendly I had the chicken chipotle and an angry orchard for 8 bucks. Perfect lunch."}
{"text":"The food was amazing. So tasty, so quick. The restaurant was clean.  The customer service was sub par, that's the only reason I give it 4 stars. But definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Best greek food on the westside! Greek fries and the shwarma plate are the best! Recommend everyone to try it!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Gyro and chicken shwarma pita are absolutely mouth watering. And lately, I've been trying to cut out some meat and dairy from my diet so I had their falafel pita for the first time which was just as satisfying! After reading the enthusiasm and love for the pita chips and hummus on here, I decided to try them, and yes... It's true... Those are out of this world!! Yum! I wish the food was less greasy and that the pita chips were not soaked in oil but... If you've been good and you deserve to indulge, this is a great joint!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for over a year now. My favorite restaurant is the west valley so far and I've been here for over 7 years. The food is undeniably delicious. Everything I've friend gets 5 stars. I have been coming about once a week for the last several months and will continue to. 

I have noticed the last couple of times I've been in that the customer service is not as great anymore. I will, however, continue to come even if it's just for take out."}
{"text":"I have to say ~~ I LOVE THIS PLACE... My husband took me here just once and I was hooked. My fav is their chicken schwarma and greek fries. OMG... Sooo amazing. The staff are always friendly, nice and they remember me. I love the deco of the place, it makes me feel so comfy. The food at this place is awesome. So fresh and yummy. I love coming here every chance I get. Thanks for always hooking us up. I cant wait to see them again real soon."}
{"text":"The pitas are awesome and loaded with tons of meat! The trip tip and lamb gyro. Love the Greek fries. The salmon plate with steamed veggies and rice is also really good! They do take a while so I would recommend ordering online or calling in your order."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots. Everything is delicious and fresh tasting. Love this place and the Greek fries and shawarma are my favorite"}
{"text":"Despite being casual, Pita Kitchen is a great little restaurant that can go toe-to-toe with much more expensive Mediterranean restaurants. 

I can get an edible gyro anywhere, but this represents a clear delineation between Greek, however well-meaning, that tastes like fast food stuffed with lunch meat, and true food that leaves you satisfied in the sense you've consumed something real. For the first time in a while, it actually tasted like I was ravenously stuffing my face with fresh lamb and robust tzatziki. I upgraded to Greek Fries, which were well-seasoned and crunchy on the outside, while soft and fluffy on the inside, as the ideal fry should be. They were topped with freshly diced Feta--not the cheap crumbles, and drizzled with a nice citrus-based sauce that enhanced and complemented the other flavors. 

It was only 10 dollars and some change, and was undoubtedly worth much more.

Vegetarians can also feel confident in an opportunity to indulge in a fine meal as well. I've tried the eggplant pita--and it was nothing short of a refreshing change of pace that wouldn't leave my more carnivorous readers wanting more. While the pita chips I had these with were fried, which I found odd, the generous helping of them proved a match made in heaven with above-average cilantro hummus. It boasted a medley of spices rather than the regrettable loads of salt to keep diners hooked. 

I dare declare Pita Kitchen as the best Greek one can find in the West Valley, but if it's out of your way, just know it's totally worth!"}
{"text":"Very good food. One thing that I'm a stickler on is cleanliness from looking in the back kitchen not the most spot on place. -but the food speaks good and they always have \"A\" grade inspection sticker so can't complain much aside from the long waits it's well worth the experience."}
{"text":"We love this place! My family and I eat a Pita kitchen at least once a week. It's a great healthy alternative to pizza. The staff is always so friendly and they go the extra mile to make sure that you're happy. I recommend the chicken kebab plate with roasted tomatoes and cilantro jalapeno hummus. Pita Kitchen never disappoints!!!"}
{"text":"This place gets it. Although busy at lunch, greeted with a smile. Order was at my table pretty quickly. My order was right, but I saw many folks send theirs back because it was wrong. I am picky when it comes to gyros, these were awesome! My second time there, and I will be back."}
{"text":"I love this place! Get the chicken kabob, it will change your life. Their pita chips are awesome. I use to eat this stuff at least 2 times a week when I worked down the street from it. Call in your order as they can get really busy. Great service as well!"}
{"text":"Hello, new favorite restaurant! Pita Kitchen lives up to the Yelp hype. No wonder this place is always crowded. 

I had the chicken shawarma entree with Greek salad. Oh, that chicken. Tender, loaded with seasoning, not dry at all. The rice made for a delicious bed for the chicken. I'm a total salad snob, and I loved the Greek salad. Great mix of flavors and I liked that it took up half the plate. Good, healthy eats!

Then there was the pita bread. I have never eaten fresh pita bread before! I think of pita bread as the thick, stiff stuff from grocery stores. No more. THIS is good bread. Warm, pliable, and delicious.

My husband had the steak shawarma entree. He loved it. The piece of his tri-tip that I grabbed was quite tasty. He had the fries instead of the salad and said they were average fries, which was just fine by him.

The woman at the counter was very helpful as we took our orders--we were obviously newbies. Our food came out within about ten minutes, which said something considering almost every table was full that Friday evening. We also watched a steady stream of customers getting take-out orders. Once we had the food, we understood why."}
{"text":"The food is amazing and the staff is extremely friendly! They really do care about their customers and you can definitely feel it from the moment you walk in until the moment you leave! Love this place!"}
{"text":"This was one of the first restaurants i visited when I moved to Phoenix and since then I have 100% fallen head over heals for them. Having tried almost everything on the menu I have not been disappointed by anything and in fact can easily say this is the best Greek/ Lebanese food I have ever had."}
{"text":"Best Greek food I have ever had!!!!  After multiple recommendations,  a couple girlfriends and I decided to finally check it out.  Oh my goodness.....  This place us excellent!  The pita chips, crunchy on the outsides, chewy on the inside.  The gyro was so flavor able.  Fresh, high quality ingredients.  Pita Jungle is over rated in comparison.   The service was very friendly."}
{"text":"Pita Kitchen has become a craving for me.
Steak Shawarma is my jam!  
The hummus is like no other, I wish all hummus was this good.

The seating is limited, but not impossible to make work. Prices are fair.  This appears to be a family owned location (with another in Arrowhead) that is managed as such.  Someone comes around to collect plates and ask how the food is, and they seem genuinely curious if you enjoyed your meal. 

Run to this place as fast as you can before even MORE people find out about it and you can't get a seat!!"}
{"text":"Loved it! Got the chicken and pita chips with jalapeño hummus."}
{"text":"Really solid Gyros, bonus points for the tri-tip gyro. Hard to choose. Great Greek fries. Not a date place, but a reliable go-to for a really satisfying meal when I'm hungry, and in a hurry."}
{"text":"Bomb.com! Very good. Got the Falafel and they were nice big falafel, probably the best I have had, French fries were good, hot and crisp. The pita was fresh and soft and the veggies crunchy and rich. Line was big and could not find a place to sit it was so pact and that's how you know it's good. Place should start taking reservations! Can't wait to bring my girlfriend."}
{"text":"Went at lunch on a weekday. Busy but still tables available. Expect to wait a little longer than a typical order-at-the-counter type of place, but not as long as a sit-down restaurant. I got A Gyro Pita combo.

Literally the best pita chips I've ever come across. And not by a little bit, hands down the best. Hummus was outstanding as well.

My pita was really good too. Meat cooked well and really good yogurt sauce. But the pita chips and Hummus stole the show for me."}
{"text":"The first time I went the food was great n we got a nice portion as wee. The second time I feel like we were jilted but it was still good. Nice hole in the wall n great place to go to eat right. Love those Greek fries like mad!"}
{"text":"Let me start of by saying that I am a Greek food aficionado. Greek salad would be my last meal if I had to choose. This place is BY FAR the best Greek in the valley. I got the gyro salad with a pita and tatziki...and I've been thinking about it ever since. Yelp will NOT steer you wrong about this place. It's not fancy, but it's the best food and you definitely get more than you pay for. Pay at the counter and take a seat with your number. The staff is extremely friendly ad came to make sure my food was to my liking. 

Overall, if you're craving Greek this is the #1 place in the valley."}
{"text":"Your Gyro yumminess

Hit this place up and was impressed by the fast service, tasty food, portion size, and nice owner.  

The gyro meat is very tender and is missing the nasty oiliness I've come to expect from other Greek restaurants.  The pita fries were new to me I polished them off.

Tip: There's an occasional coupon in the West Valley View that makes a visit a great deal."}
{"text":"I ate at PK earlier this week.. I was not only happy the staff was so pleasant and accommodating to my no carb diet and willing to substitute more greens for the rice, but the food was DELICIOUS!!! I feel like I am cheating on my diet, but I am not.... Going again tonight with my kiddos!!"}
{"text":"I did go to this restaurant food is great price for food is very good, service was friendly, we ordered Greek French fries and kabob and salad it was very good and on top of everything was clean, I will recommend this to everybody."}
{"text":"Eat here all the time, it's never been bad! 

The servings are HUGE! You can get hummus, wraps, and some delicous baklava too! 

It's small on the inside, and can get crowded, but they give excellent customer service. Everyone gets their full attention, and daily specials make for a great, inexpensive lunch! 

The chicken kabob meal is my favorite, and the saffron rice is worth the trip alone! 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I live about 2 minutes away from this place so we are frequent patrons. We love it!!! Have always had awesome food. It comes out fresh and the portions are generous! I love the eggplant and the greek salad. The boy loves...everything. Their hummus... I crave it all the days! Absolutely recommended!!"}
{"text":"Food here was super awesome! Thank you to Reimun and the staff for their great service! He made great recommendations for an unsure, indecisive person like me! Will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Hands down best greek restaurant in the west valley. The owners and employees are so attentive and quick. The food is amazing!! The sampler dish is awesome!! You have to try it for yourself...you will love it!"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff and great food.  I'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"I ordered the gyro plate and they let me substitute the rice for greek fries. My meal was fast and absolutely fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"This is prob one of my favorite Mediterranean place to eat. My wife and I love this place. We always order the hummus topped with steak which is served with a side of pita chips but we recommend you ask for fried chips - oh so good.  This place gets pretty busy so If you go on a weekend I suggest you go early or call ahead to see how busy they are. And since we always crave it around the weekend- we always order our food to go ."}
{"text":"oh my!  love this place.  went there once a week while traveling for work and i wish i was there now.  ordered the chicken shawarma sandwich with garlic sauce and hummus.  the sandwich is big so i didn't finish it but the garlic sauce is something.  the pita chips with the hummus are amazing.  crunchy but soft in the middle.  to die for."}
{"text":"Great food! (Chicken Greek Salad, cilantro jalapeño  hummus, fresh/hot pita are a must.)
Very friendly staff. All smiles, very helpful. A definite \"would come back\" when in the Avondale area."}
{"text":"Gave Pita Kitchen another shot and per the owner's recommendation, ordered the Chicken Kabobs. Great choice! Not dry like the Chicken Shawarma I tried before. The chicken was well seasoned and tasty with the pita bread and rice. I got fries instead of the salad or hummus. The fries were battered & good, although they did not taste fresh from the fryer. But I enjoyed my meal & will be glad to return for more Chicken Kabobs."}
{"text":"Popped in here for dinner on Saturday evening and couldn't be more happier that I did!

Located off McDowell in Avondale with lots of available parking.  Parking is shared with other businesses so you might have to drive around the lot to look for a spot during peak times.

Business is clean, and staff extremely friendly and welcoming.  The place is a bit small, and when we arrived, all the tables were occupied.  There were only a couple of outside tables and those too were occupied (-1).
We decided to turn our in-dining experience to a take away experience, but luckily, a table opened up prior to ordering.

The food was great and adequately portioned - very filling and tasty.  I had the steak pita with the side of vegetable medley.  
The pita was warm and tasty.  The steak was moist and cooked just right enough to not be too soft or too chewy.
The vegetable medley was seasoned just right with the vegetables being cooked perfectly -- not too soggy, but crunchy enough.

Will be back either to dine or to take advantage of their online ordering and pickup!"}
{"text":"Another lucky find thanks to Yelp. We spent the weekend at Phoenix Comicon and were preparing to drive back to Las Vegas when we discovered that the 115 degree heat had killed our car battery! After getting a jump from the helpful Radisson hotel staff, we drove to the nearest Sam's Club with an automotive department. Thanks to Yelp, we found that this place was close by so we decided to eat before hitting the road. Initially we were disappointed because the restaurant is crammed into a strip mall and it was very crowded. It didn't appear to be anything special but I'm glad we stayed. This was some of the best Greek food I've had in a while! One really nice touch is that you can get pita chips and hummus instead of fries with your meal and the hummus is very good. The prices are a little higher than normal but the quality and quantity of food more than makes up for it. This place is worth checking out if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Yummy! All of it - found this place searching yelp so glad we stopped in. If you love Greek food this is a great little treasure!"}
{"text":"Shawarm now or shawarm later?

I am a huge fan of this place. The chicken kabob is so good, especially coupled with hummus. The staff is always friendly and if you are either taking out or dining in the service is superb. 

There are many places to eat at in the Gateway Pavillions area. Do yourself a favor and go to one that is unique (non burger, non chicken fingers) and let the great tasting Mediterranean food wake up your taste buds. I am not sure if they still have this, but if you check in on Yelp, they offer 10% off your bill."}
{"text":"Food quality was great! The portion size sucked. The french fries were awesome. Crispy and fresh! The meat in the sandwich was fantastic. Juicy and tender. The problem is that they didn't put much ingredients inside of it besides that. Skimpy on the tomatoes, skimpy on the sauce and skimpy on the onions.

The only thing that this place has going for itIs the taste of the food. Customer service skills could be enhanced through training. But not too many places train their people in customer service skills anymore. That's sad! Because with the quality of this food if the service would've been there I would've easily given them five stars. Service makes or breaks you in the restaurant business."}
{"text":"Food was awesome! Best falafels!! Cilantro humus and pitas were tasty as well! Great food and friendly service at a reasonable price!"}
{"text":"I was weary of coming to another greek restaurant as i had tried one before in Chandler and it burned my desire to ever try one again, until recently. I always passed by Pita kitchen on my way to run errands or eat elsewhere. Today that changed and i was finally tempted enough to try it. The magical aroma that filled the cozy restaurant. And the staff and service were excellent! Ana and Diana made sure i and my mom were taken care of. From observing the other tables they looked like the other people came here often and even held conversations with the customers ourselves included that were very happy with the service. I ordered the Cilantro hummus and the number 12 plate that came with 2 meat portions of your choice  and a delicious rice and greek salad. The hummus was without a doubt the best hummus i ever had in my life and I'm a Hummus snob. The portions were generous the food including the salad was fresh. The meat perfectly seasoned and piping hot. It looks like the heart,passion and flare stayed in this place. I will definitely be coming back. Thank you for your service!"}
{"text":"Ordered a gyro combo and a combination appetizer, also tasted the beef shawarma. Everything was very good and came out to the table quickly. The gentleman working the counter was also helpful in recommending items and was very friendly. I will definitely be going back there in the near future."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing! It's one thing to have great food, but when you have great service too it's awesome. Ryan is the owner and you can tell that he cares about great quality food. They make their hummus from scratch and it's delicious! If you're looking for great tasting Greek food this place is hands  down the best on the west!"}
{"text":"Good food. This restaurant has a bit of a 'fast food' lobby set up, but the food is very good. Prices are reasonable and the staff is nice. We visited during a trip through Arizona. . . I had the vegetarian plate (of course) - The falafel was very tasty - not the best I've ever had, but certainly in the top three! If we're in Arizona again, we know where we're eating."}
{"text":"I've been here twice. Once called in an order. Another time dine-in. Both times the food was amazing. The dining area is clean. The staff is helpful and friendly. Couldn't ask for a better experience."}
{"text":"We've never had a bad meal here. The chicken.pita is one of the best in the valley! My hubby loves the gyro pita and Greek fries; my favorite side is the Greek salad. Although the pitas are great I crave the chicken shwarma meal with pita chips and rice....not sure what goes into making that rice but I could eat it every day! If you haven't been here yet, you're missing out!"}
{"text":"Highly recommend this place! delicious middle eastern food and fairly priced! we needed a place like this in the west valley, so people living in the west valley try them out, you wont be sorry!"}
{"text":"THE PITA SPOT OF PHX 

Came into this family owned restaurant for during my lunch break. Pretty busy, but not hard to find seating. I ordered the gyro pita with greek fries combo. It was about $11. The pita was overflowing! 99% meat. The fries were DELICIOUS. Hot, crispy, seasoned perfectly, and with chunks of greek cheese. No wonder the girl told me they were called \"Crack Fries\". I will have to agree with this name. I dream about these fries. I wish this was closer to me; I would be a regular here. 

The service was very quick. The restaurant was very clean. The amount of food and the taste given matches the price. 

Oh, and i LOVED that they didn't charge me more for extra sauce!!

Environment: 5/5
Food: 5/5
Price: 5/5
Service: 5/5"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. My girl and I love this place. We try to eat vegan and vegetarian when possible, and Pita Kitchen hits the spot. The falafel pita and the grilled eggplant pita... WOW. Awesome. The eggplant is not big gross, pieces of overly firm eggplant, rather, it is mixed with a nice selection of veggies. Their pita bread is super soft and fresh, and their hummus is very nice! 

They have several options for those trying to avoid animal products, but also great meats. I have tried some of their meat-based selections, and the meat is exceptional.  The beef and chicken both are flavored throughout and very tender. Meat lovers and even those who eat meat only occasionally should be very pleased with the meat.

Serving sizes are good, and we with either leftovers, or so stuffed we can hardly walk. The staff and the owners are super duper nice; never have encountered a single rude person here. They are humble and they appreciate their patrons.

Give them a whirl. I doubt you'd be disappointed."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this restaurant since it opened. I came tonight and was very disappointed with my experience. The meat on the gyro was half the amount it normally is. I asked the girl at the register and she was clue less. Then she came out to my table and said their gyro sandwich has been modified and if I want more meat it is now double meat. I let her know I will modify where I go to eat and no longer come here. My friend ordered her sandwich with avocado $1.50 extra, when it came out they told her they ran out of avocado no refund offered. She had to go up to the front for her refund. This place was good when it first opened but now with all the brand new staff and their \"modifications\" I will no longer be coming here."}
{"text":"A friendly staff and good food is always a great combo. I have always ordered the chicken kabob entree and have never been disappointed. 

Make sure you have 15 minutes to wait for the goodness that is about to be devoured."}
{"text":"amazing food very fresh and great flavor will defiantly be going back"}
{"text":"This is by far the best Greek restaurant that I have been to in the west valley and I even think in Phoenix. The Gyro's are not too salty like other places, bread is soft and the Tzatziki sauce is on point. The Greek fries are a must have and a great addition to any meal. Girlfriend always gets the hummus trio and adds chicken which I always steal as much as I can get my hands on because it is so good. Another reason that I love going here is they have the option to get any bread in whole wheat, which is a nice healthy change from other Greek places."}
{"text":"The size , amount and flavor of the falafels were large and delicious.  The salad greens should gave more chopped and less vinaigrette added. However, i have hadGreek food for more than 25 years and this is this best fresh  Tzaziki sauce I have ever had!"}
{"text":"I love this place when I lived in Arizona. It was a great alternative to my California Mediterranean food! I loved my chicken pita with pita chips! Yummy! Juicy chicken. They also have a cilantro hummus which is THE BEST! Also I might add, I think it's the owner that's usually up front but they are always so nice and friendly!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing, every time we have ordered the food has been perfect and delicious. We order take out, and often have special orders and they have never messed up. Best food around!"}
{"text":"This is a small but friendly place that has great food. A Greek menu that has everything."}
{"text":"Excellent food and the pita bread is nice and fresh.  My husband got the chicken gyro and it was excellent.  Could use a little bit of seasoning on the fries or some feta cheese would be great. Otherwise will be going back and it is nice to have a Gyro location closer to us.  Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"This place is seriously, AMAZING! I'm not that picky when it comes to gyros and already thought they taste great everywhere I get it, but when I tried Pita Kitchen, it showed me a whole new kind of DELICIOUSNESS!!! Try this place out! You won't regret it! They just set the \"gyro standards\" for me. It's going to be hard to eat it anywhere else now."}
{"text":"Love love love this place.

Excellent food every time. And the service is always great.

I highly recommend the schwarma, either chicken or steak, and the Greek fries.

I crave Pita Kitchen often and it never disappoints."}
{"text":"Love this place, don't go often but when I do it's just delicious trying new dishes. I live going for the cilantro hummus with pita bread which is just utterly mouthwatering. If you haven't tried it, you should. It's a small place but you'll always see many people there. Love it!"}
{"text":"So good. Fresh, healthy veggies in the pita. Nice service. Low prices. This place was just great and deserves all 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Great food great service stayed open later just to let my bf and I eat in! Very clean! Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"My husband and I went in here for the first time a few days ago after reading the stellar reviews.  We were not disappointed - though I am a huge fan of Pita Jungle's hummus, the hummus at Pita Kitchen is great.  Different (it's warm instead of cold, and they don't have red bell pepper, which is my favorite), but very tasty.  Oh, and their pita bread?  Fresh, warm, amazing.  All of the food we tried was wonderful, especially the Greek fries.  Oh man, am I sucker for Greek fries!

The employees are very friendly and helpful as well.  Love this place, we will definitely be going back very soon!"}
{"text":"I love middle Eastern food. Dated a guy who was so we ate it a lot. It's not all the same, depends on where they're from. I like this place but the meats and rice only. Sometimes the jalapeño hummus is a little spicy for my taste. I don't like the pink sauce would prefer traditional tzatziki. The falafel was dry and over seasoned.  Also plan on waiting. Takes 30 mins for 2 plate take out.  Girls in front are usually just standing around."}
{"text":"Never had a bad meal here, until today.  Maybe it was just an off day for the pita boys.

I always get the #1 combo. Today, the pita bread was dry/hard and the meat was actually hard on the edge. 

The pita chips and hummus was good.

Will return again, normally the food is delicious."}
{"text":"These are the best Pitas in Avondale, the gyro meat is perfectly seasoned. I just left and I want to go back for more."}
{"text":"First time trying the place while on a hummus mission with my cousin. Found Pita Kitchen on Yelp and decided to try. Excellent decision! Fresh food, moist meats (chicken and gyros) and really good dressings. The garlic dip is amazing as well as the Greek dressing. I really like the fresh, homemade taste of the food and the staff was really friendly."}
{"text":"There isn't a pita jungle in this area but now that I found pita kitchen I don't mind at all.  I had the chicken swarmaza (not sure how to spell it) with a Greek salad.  The chicken was moist and had so much flavor.  They even offered gold peak tea *my favorite.  Javier had the beef gyro with fries. He said it tasted good but next time will get the salad instead of the fries. We also shared some baklava. I have had better but I'm willing to try 
It again especially since baklava is one of my favorite desserts."}
{"text":"The food is very good. I had the gyro and Greek fries. Very tasty. It is more expensive than the typical Greek restaurant."}
{"text":"Yum! Delicious and clean family owned restaurant. It hits the spot for tasty Mediterranean food. Nice owners and employees!"}
{"text":"What can I say I have been going here for years the chicken kebab is amazing the falafel is amazing the pink garlic sauce is amazing salads are amazing and the steak shwarma is amazing.  And most of all the service and the staff is amazing."}
{"text":"Everything was well seasoned and delicious. Garlic sauce that came with my beef shwarma was amazing! I could eat here every day!"}
{"text":"Great Greek! Really good flavors and excellent service."}
{"text":"Delicious food reasonably priced. Great customer service and clean venue. I haven't had one bad experience. We really like the gyro pita, hummus with choice of meat, and Mediterranean sampler."}
{"text":"In proximity to the Ak Chin Pavilion, this proved to be a great place for dinner! The hummus was excellent - but I would have ordered just the cilantro/jalepeno hummus instead of both, because it was SO good! The beef shawarma was very good, the chicken was tasty but slightly overcooked. We loved the fries, and the side option vegetable medley was fresh and sauteed when we ordered it (not sitting around waiting for a customer). It was a generous serving of veggies, perfectly cooked, plenty for two to share. 

Although this has the look of a fast-food restaurant, the service was impressive!"}
{"text":"Bar far the best Mediterranean food in the valley in my opinion! The price is perfect for the large portion of food that is given. Service is always wonderful and food has never disappointed. My personal favorite is the chicken kabob entree with their jalapeño and cilantro hummus!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing!  We had a chicken shawarma and a steak shawarma with pita chips, hummus, and a Greek salad.  We finished our lunch with baklava.  Everything tasted great and the people are friendly and attentive!  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Would have 5 stars but we were not warned about the level of spice in items that don't normally have heat!
Otherwise it's a oasis of healthy food in a junk food jungle!"}
{"text":"This place is so good. The food here is so good. If you're ever in the area, you should come here when you can. I used to live around here and would always come here. The service is always exceptional. I would recommend the chicken kabob platter. You get so much food for the price and it all tastes great. Also, their freshly fried pita chips are to die for. Do not go about your life thinking it's complete unless you've tried their pita chips! 

I haven't seen the owners in a long time. They are both great guys. I really love that they brought this place here and hope they decide to open another location somewhere in Central Phoenix."}
{"text":"Food is delicious. Always fresh, great taste. I love their Greek chicken salad, and my husband loves the chicken chipotle gyro with garlic fries. The only thing I'd say is the place needs more seating ..but besides it love dinning or picking up food to go"}
{"text":"Went to Pita Kitchen to meetup with a former colleague of mine.  He lives in Avondale AZ.  I do not normally venture to the West Valley in Phoenix (I spend most of time in Phoenix or East Valley).  

I ordered a falafel pita.  It was good.  It is the standard Mediterranean fare.  Many kinds of sandwiches."}
{"text":"Delicious steak shwarma!! Great eats before the cardinals games. Make sure to get the garlic sauce. So good and cost friendly"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying this. Pita Kitchen is my Fav Place to go to eat . My husband took me there just shortly after they opened their doors but after he tried it first without me ( way to go Honey lol ) . The food is outstanding and the staff are Awesome. The owners are the nicest people who make you feel so welcome. We are always at this location. I went in to get a take out order on about Jan 6, 2017.  I got my usual yummy order Chicken Shawarma with Greek Salad and you have to try their Greek Fries. My husband loves their Gyro Pita . Their food is always fresh you can really taste the goodness and love in everything they make. I will not go to any other Pita place in town except to Pita Kitchen. Maybe I am loyal or maybe it's cuz their food is just that good. I also love their vegetarian choices also, that is always a hit with me of course since I LOVE Vegetarian food. Thanks guys for always make us feel like family who feed us with awesome and yummy food. See you soon, Mac"}
{"text":"So good! Everything was fresh and delicious. I don't eat Greek food often but I'd definitely eat at Pita Kitchen again. They know what they're doing when it comes to high quality, authentic food!"}
{"text":"The best Pita spot in town by far. Ordered the steak shawarma and must admit it was gone in 60 seconds (maybe a lil longer than that) and I wanted another one to take home. Very fresh and soft pita bread, juicy tender steak melted in my mouth, and what a perfect blend of ingredients for a well rounded taste combination. Will definitely be coming back and bringing others here as much as possible. Last, but most important by far would be the bible scriptures on the wall proclaiming the Truth and making it known that their success comes from God.   Great job Pita Kitchen!!!

{"text":"Stopped here because of the 4.5 star rating. Was not disappointed. We ordered an eggplant pita and a chicken shawarma pita. Both were amazing. The owner was kind and welcoming.  I highly recommend them. And if you check in you get 10% off your bill. I had already paid and sat down before I checked in, so I didn't use mine. But nonetheless the prices are quite reasonable and the food is fresh and tasty!"}
{"text":"Love the food and great customer service!!!!! The employees are middle eastern so you can count on the food tasting authentic. I just didn't enjoy the chicken soup.. smelled greasy"}
{"text":"Food was excellent. Gyro pita and kabob sandwich. Fries hot and crispy, pita bread hot, meat was tasty. Service was a little slow."}
{"text":"I was looking for a place to eat and came across this place and decided to come here because of its rating! Their food is so good! The salmon and vegetable medley was delicious. The salmon itself had lots of flavor. Their fries were very crispy and if you're looking to try something new, try their Greek fries! It is drizzled with some sort of vinaigrette and topped with feta cheese. The food is very affordable ranging from $5-$13. The staff was very helpful and friendly. They even came to ask us if we liked the Greek fries and would exchange it for normal fries if we didn't like them. The place was very packed around 5:00 pm, but nevertheless the staff was still very attentive to us. P.s. you get 10% off your order if you check in."}
{"text":"This is a great casual restaurant. The food tastes amazing. The prices are fair (and don't forget that check in bonus). The staff are always friendly. I've been a loyal fan of Golden Greek for years. And I may have found a new favorite gyro in the valley. If only they could have GG's puffy pitas!

The Greek fries are amazing. The reddish/pink dipping sauce is addictive. And the rice tastes great. I do kind of wish that the shwarma wraps had a sour pickle in them but that is probably just a personal preference.

I'd recommend this to anyone that wants casual Mediterranean food in the west valley."}
{"text":"I went here as much as I could when working nearby. The food is plentiful, their Mediterranean salads are great!.

They have more of a Greek vibe if you look at their decor, but they are really a mix of different Mediterranean/Middle-Eastern cuisine (cannot be disappointed)"}
{"text":"This place has great food and great service. Always get the combo platter when passing by the area."}
{"text":"Cute restaurant. The hummus is really flavorful and delicious, and the bread is super soft and nice. The pita chips are so good but I know they must be awful for you. The grilled eggplant is really good - nice and light and fairly healthy. Prices are reasonable. I'd go back."}
{"text":"Awesome food and very friendly staff and always nice and clean ! Got the nr 1,8,3  and the brushetta yum !"}
{"text":"Well done and great flavors without having a shawarma dripping in your sleeve.... which is what allot of Lebanese restaurants do to compensate for food lacking real flavor. Although I did not order them I would highly recommend the pita chips, they received rave reviews from my coworker's."}
{"text":"I went to Pita Kitchen a few weeks ago, and was very excited to get some decent hummus nearby. The staff was friendly, and seemed to know their menu pretty well.

I ordered a the Chicken Shawarma with hummus. They accidentally messed up my order and gave me a greek salad. I'm not really one to complain, but I was really craving some hummus. I let the staff know, and they apologized and let me keep the salad as they prepped my hummus.

The chef came out and apologized again, then late came out a few minute later to make sure we were enjoying our meal. I was very impressed with their customer service and how professional they were. It was as we were getting fine dining customer service in a fast food style restaurant. 

Overall, the food was great, and the customer service made it that much better. I will definitely be coming by more often!"}
{"text":"My first and still favorite place to go when I desire Greek food. Everything was so perfect from the person taking my order to when I went and picked it up.
I had the Greek fries, and a salad with gyro meat. And I special order everything so I wanted it all on the side. The dressing for the salad is my favorite, the tazziki is and will be the best, the Pita is soooo warm and fluffy and the meat is always the best with a char on it.
Close parking can be a bit of a hassle and waiting in a line to pick up an order is hard if you are in a hurry. But I had time.
Thanks for keeping my belly full and my mouth watering for more."}
{"text":"Weekly regular here. Food is awesome! Aaron is usually the employee to help us. Exceptional customer service. He consistently checks in on guests in dining, making sure everyone has what they need. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Had the chicken shawarma plate - DELICIOUS, the rice was fantastic. I didn't really care for the dips/sauces, but the dressing for the greek salad was good. The feta cheese was nice and fresh. My boyfriend had the gyros platter and he loved it. Our daughter had the pitadilla that came with fries - it was pretty freaking fantastic. The pita bread was very good too. Wasn't a huge fan of the hummus, but I've never really been a hummus fan in general. My boyfriend likes hummus and he wasn't wowed by it either. Everything else though, pretty good! It's a small place, but they're quick, great prices, and good food. We did takeout."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a lunch break. We got in just before the lunch rush. The employee was very nice and patient. She answered our questions about the menu and made recommendations. The gyro was okay, but the fries were super tasty.  I'm glad she recommended them. I would definitely go back for the fries."}
{"text":"This place is legit. 

The pita bread is warm and soft, not everyone might dig it but DAMN SON the cilantro jalapeno hummus is the bomb.

Like my other homre had said earlier, get the Greek Fries unless you don't like fantastical flavor explosion in your mouth. 

The staff is CHILLL dawg, they answered all the stupid questions I had and were friendly the whole way through. Drinks were served quickly and food up prompt.

I don't know why you are still reading this, if you are hungry and ain't a hater for food go get it.

oh and it's pretty light on the wallet.

peace."}
{"text":"We are from California and when we are in AZ this will be one of our spots.  Chicken shawarma was really good!  Husband liked the Greek feta fries and the cilantro hummus."}
{"text":"Pita Kitchen is surprising delicious. I tried this place on a friends recommendation and boy was he right. I started with the pita chips and if nothing else, you must have these. I then had a chicken kabob dish with greek salad. It was marvelous. The staff is very friendly and they have a bevy of different Mediterranean dishes to select from. The only drawback really was that the location is very small. It does feel like a cramped visit. Thats minor since the food is absolutely delicious."}

I hate businesses that don't honor their operating hours. If I knew you were closing before posted close time, I wouldn't have made the drive. I checked to see if I could make it."}
{"text":"Great gyro. Fries were awesome. Super friendly service. Place was packed, but not too crowded for comfort."}
{"text":"The gyro meat has good flavor and the pita is pretty fresh.  The best thing here was the chicken gyro pita sandwich, which was very flavorful."}
{"text":"When I'm in the mood for a pita sandwich, this is my first choice. I've been here enough to have tried most of the menu items, and they are all very good. The best thing about this place is the consistency. It's always the same, and always as good."}

Short Answer: It's a great place to have lunch if you are craving for Greek food whether you are dining in or taking out. But at night, it can be somewhat lackluster.

Long Answer: Me and my cousins went here to try out their Greek food because it was the closes one to our house and it has high rating. The first couple of times we went here was during lunch hours and close to evening time. Lunch hour is always crowded, but it wasn't long as you would expected to be. It's about 5 - 20 minutes wait depending on what you order and how long your line is. Not bad right?! Near the evening, it's a little less people, but waiting time remain the same as lunch. However, this time, when we went there it was at night around 7:30 PM. Very terrible customer service. I'm not saying that they were remarking snide comments or was yelling at us or anything like that. They gave us a silent treatment after our orders. We waited over 30 minutes and there were some people, but wasn't crowded or anything. Some people came in order their food and got their food right away before us. At first, I thought this was racism because we were Asian and everybody else that was dining and taking out weren't Asian. But I think it was just simply poor management. Their excuse was, the Chicken Kabob took a lot of time. Which is fine if that was the case, but they did not tell us beforehand or gave us any warning when we ordered it. Me and my cousins, we sat at the table right in front of their registered, and yet, they treated us like ghost as in we weren't even their. They didn't bother trying to provide an excuse why we had to wait so long until we had to say \"hey, why is it taking so long?\" Their faces look surprised as if we didn't ordered anything. But anyway, even though, their excuse was the Chicken Kabob took a lot of time to cook, when we came home, the Kabob was pretty dried and overcooked. This was truly a sad and unfortunate situation for us because we were really hungry. But what's done is done. Basically, my issue with this place was the night time management. It really is terrible. But other than that, I recommend going lunch hour or before 6 PM. Night people are terrible as it seems. Very unmotivated to work and to greet people sincerely."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I have only  been to the Pita Kitchen once. I ordered the chicken shawarma with the hummus. It was delicious I loved the olive on the hummus, the chicken was pretty good(but it was dry), and the saffron rice was a good but a bit bland. 
They were really busy when I went on Friday night. I am going to go back and try the chicken kabob and the greek fries. This place definitely hit the spot though. 

*reasoning for stars; it is not a 5 star restaurant but it is really good for a shopping mall restaurant."}
