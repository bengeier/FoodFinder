{"text":"Chinese buffet with Chinese people eating there? This is definitely not the mandarin!   Huge lines ups during Friday Saturday and Sundays. Less busy on weekdays, also cheaper. Try to go then so you can be seated at a decent time.   The food is good - some authentic dishes with the traditional \"Canadian\" fare you would find at the food courts.   I can't remember what day it was, but they had half lobsters for every guest.  It was a bit dry, not my favourite thing from the massive buffet selection.   Fare included: dim sum (ha gow and siu Mai, different dumplings etc), noodle bar!, sushi (it was okay - not mind blowing), salad bar and they had tons of dessert - both the typical cake, jello and ice cream you see at the mandarin, but they had some pretty good Chinese desserts too (tofu dessert - served warm), almond jello, mango jello etc.    Price is more than the mandarin, but it's definitely better quality and service."}
{"text":"Last Friday came for dinner for my boyfriend 's birthday at Dragon Pearl at York Mills. It was my first time eating at Dragon Pearl. We had 25 people gathering in the VIP private room, which is fancy. There are two big tall chairs at each table. The staff there were very responsible and not only they gave him a free meal, but also offered him one heart-shape birthday cake and sang songs together as well which was a nice surprise! It wasn't very crowded and the ambiance was nice. I noticed there was always staff around leading people to their tables, cleaning up tables quickly, always attentive, my glass of water was never empty and our dishes were cleared almost instantly. All in all our experience here was great! Thank you for the kind service and hospitality!"}
{"text":"All in all the food was great! The price was a but high but we throughly enjoyed ourselves. The lobster was overcooked but the rest of the buffet made up for it. We will be back."}
{"text":"Definitely a WOW factor happening when you walk into this place.  Certainly not some low end poorly decorated Chinese Buffet and certainly not Mandarin.  The decor alone is stunning!  Very unique and not what you'd usually find in a buffet atmosphere.  Food selection is also something to go wow over.  Typical buffet prices, more for dinner, but that includes lobster and other delights they don't serve during the lunch hours.  Plenty of parking, not far from the 401/Leslie exit.  Much needed new restaurant like this in an area catering to an upper class community and a busy business lunch time crowd.  If you have family and friends visiting from out of town, definitely take them here.  Coureous service, great selection of food, unique environment."}
{"text":"Not my choice to come here and my disclaimer is that I'm not a fan of buffet style dining. Overall, the food is low quality. Most of the stations are filler full of the usual stir fry. Sushi was mass produced and you could do better at even the cheapest sushi joint. I find the idea of handing over a 'ticket' for lobster a bit ridiculous. Either offer all you can eat, or not at all.   The prongs for picking up food were greasy. That was kind of off-putting. Dessert bar was disappointing. Not much fruit. Rest of it low quality.   Don't think I'll ever come back. Would not recommend to others."}
{"text":"I was really impressed by this buffet.   The decor is beautiful. There are different styles of seating, from sitting on top of a boat (if you have 6 people or less), to sitting under a gazebo-like canopy with round tables to just the regular ol' long tables. The low lighting and colour scheme of the restaurant creates the perfect ambiance.   The food was also quite good, in terms of both quantity and quality. They had the largest selection of dessert I've ever seen at a buffet. From sugar free cheesecake and sugar free black forrest cake to german chocolate cake to tiramisu and creme brulee to ice cream and  to make your own waffle... the list goes on! This was the first time I was not able to try everything I wanted to try at a buffet because I was so full!  When they seat you, each person at the table gets a ticket for the lobster. I think this is a brilliant idea to ensure that everyone has a chance of getting some and so that no one takes advantage. I guess this also allows them to serve better quality lobster too, because the lobster was very meaty!  Favourites included: salmon sashimi, grilled salmon with teriyaki sauce, lemon chicken, nainamo bars, and the hand cut noodles.  The staff here do a good job of making sure that plates are being taken away promptly and that your water glass is always full. Food is always being replenished. It is definately a step up from your typical buffet (they even bring you hot towels at the end of your meal!).    The pricing here is higher compared to other buffet/all you can eat. It was $28 for weekend dinner. Would love to visit again!"}
{"text":"I read a previous review that said the decor here was kitschy. If that reviewer had spent just a little more time looking, he/she would have realized that the smooth, dark wood used throughout the restaurant is actually repurposed wood from retired ships. They also have an impressive collection of Petrified wood, that's vegetation like trees and plants that have transformed into minerals. Dragon Pearl has won an architectural design award for such ingenuity and creativity.  Decor is 5 stars. But we're here to talk food. And for that, I have to give a low grade. The food is your typical Chinese-Canadian fare. Deep fried spring rolls and wings. Sweet and sour pork and beef and broccoli. There is nothing special or really authentic about this kind of food. The weekday lunch rate is cheap at $12.99. I guess for that cheap, you can't expect any of the good stuff they showcase on the brochure and on the website. IE Peking Duck or lobster.  Overall, it was an experience to dine in such a beautifully decorated restaurant, but I would not return to Dragon Pearl for the food."}
{"text":"We went for lunch... And we are not too happy with the amount we paid.   It's great customer service and the place was unique and clean, but we found the taste of the food were the same and we're not impressed with the food."}
{"text":"Dragon Pearl (DP) used to be one of my favourite AYCE restaurants with great quality food in a beautiful environment. Over the years, I've organized many dinner get-togethers at this place. However, the last 2 visits in the past 2 months have been rather disappointing.  The general food quality has certainly gone down the drain and the selection of food is not as good as its sister restaurant, Dragon Legend (DL). For example, DL serves this delicious fish broth based soup noodles & offers roast duck soup noodles.  There are less sashimi selections at DP vs DL.  Found out today that they no longer even serve their signature dessert 'Dragon Pearl' - a huge deep fried dough ball.   The server was friendly, however, I found her very annoying. An hour into dining, she reminded us that we can only dine till 7:30pm. Thereafter, she repeatedly kept coming back to rush us like every 10/15 mins by using various tactics, e.g. clearing up the cutleries without asking to see whether we were done; giving the bill without asking; dishing out fortune cookies and wet serviettes before we even had dessert; didn't bother asking whether we wanted tea/coffee with our desserts; etc.  A staff called Sophie topped off the evening by being the worst ever personnel I've ever seen in the food & beverage industry. She had the nerve to come to our table, & say that since we were all chatting, we should be done with eating & should leave. I said to her, are you kidding!  A.) We haven't even hit the 2 hours dining time limit & there were like PLENTY of empty tables around; B.) She need her eyes checked badly. There were people in our party still having their desserts.  After I pointed that out to her, she didn't even bother to apologize and just put her tail between her legs and buggered off.  Save your CAD$33++/adult on the weekend & dine at Spoon & Fork instead. It serves much better made to order AYCE cuisine, and is around the corner in the same plaza!  Should DP continue to run its current course, its fate will probably end up like their signature dish, the Dragon Pearl.....doomed & out of the picture!  So done with DP!"}
{"text":"Three stars because some servers are extremely rude. Food is good and better than Mandarin. Very nice ambiance. Food quality is good but one batch of Jello smelled like puke.   Problem with this place is service. Our waitress would not stop touching my baby. You just don't do that. She complained that we were sharing green tea and was going to charge us even though it came in pot large enough for 5. However, I actually saw people bring empty tupperware and filler up to take home (they pretend they don't see it if you belong to a certain ethnic background).If they are busy they will try and kick you out quick."}
{"text":"Went with a group of 9.  In comparison to Mandarin, we thought the selection of food was pretty good.  The peking duck wraps were surprisingly good.  You also get a ticket for 1 half lobster, which was overcooked but none of us were expecting it to be cooked perfectly.  The decor is nice and our group would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Chinese buffets I`ve been to. It is also more expensive than the others but the quality of the food is definitely better.  Food selection was great. They serve peking duck with wrap here which I love. On weekends you will get a ticket to redeem half a lobster. Once you get to that station, if they don`t give it to you, make sure you ask for the claw.   I usually don`t care for the sushi at these buffets, but the sushi and sashimi at Dragon Pearl is actually fresh! Yum!"}
{"text":"This place is one of the best buffets that I have tried.  They have a good variety of food and the service is amazing.  On our second visit they were constantly clearing away places and replenishing napkins without asking.    The roast beef was great and so was the fresh noodles, I highly recommend the beef szhewan"}
{"text":"IM COMING BACK!!  best asian buffet in toronto. I've been to many. this is pretty up there. nice service GOOD food."}
{"text":"This is honestly the best Chinese buffet I ever had...and this include my recent Chinese food eating in CHINA!  We found this place by chance...we were staying in Westin Prince and really want some Chinese...Initially when I poke my head in this place seems dark, but we decided to go with it...wow what a good decision.  The place is beautifully decorated with tons of cool Chinese decor..right from the waiting area with the 12 Chinese zodiac head sculpts, the unique seating areas, tons of special buffet areas (sushi, fresh noodle, fruits, salad....etc)...unlimited peking duck?  I am in heaven.  The tea also came in this candle lighten base which made it very heavenly.  More detail you ask, how about the ice cream scoop in a running warm water?  All the details are covered.  My only regret is that we do not have such place in my home town.  I will miss this buffet dearly.   :-("}
{"text":"The place is huge. It has a large selection even pecking duck and lobster (half a tail per person, on a weekend). The food is great. The staff need to be friendlier. We came a few times, a couple of times service was great, the other times it wasn't as good, and the last time we came a few months ago, the service was horrible! Overall, its a good place to eat, but the service is hit or miss."}
{"text":"Dragon Pearl lunch buffet has a great selection of food and great décor.  The place is much better than other buffet places like the Mandarin as there is much more authenticity in their food.  They have a grilled meat section that includes freshly grilled chicken, red sausage, some traditional Chinese new year desserts, yam, corn.   Sushi selection is decent as they have sushi with actual raw fish for lunch.  They have sashimi for dinner.  They have many different types of desserts from a variety of cakes to ice cream to sweet tofu dessert. I find the cakes not really well made and the ice cream too sweet.   They have a lot of decorations where you can eat on a boat.  A lot of cool statues and I believe they have live performances on some nights."}
{"text":"Love love love this place! Boyfriend has dragged me to the Mandarin one too many times...I always leave there feeling like money has been wasted. Not at the Dragon Pearl. I was perfectly content to pay for what we got.  Sushi - good. Usually Chinese buffet sushi is sad and dry and half-assed....not to mention rarely contains actual fish. The Dragon Pearl has a greAt (smallish) selection of sushi, including the essentials like salmon and white tuna. Sashimi was in surpisingly thick cuts.  Lobster - made me so happy. I got my (rather large) claw with the coupon, and later my boyfriend gave me his ticket too. This time, we got two pieces, I'm assuming because it was close to the buffet closing. It was slightly chewy, but the flavour was great, and it was actually warm (unlike the crab you get at the Mandarin). They also offer a few dim dum choices (yay!) and a nice selection of chinese food, which isn't chewy and doesn't taste like MSG, like most buffet offerings. Meat dishes had large, identifiable pieces of meat. Nothing was overcooked, or cold. Everything was good. Even items that are usually just space filler, like different salads and side dishes, were amazing (mmmm thai mango salad!) Their dessert table was also different from most, in that it wasn't full of frozen, dried out selections. Perhaps the most important feature in their dessert table...CREME BRULE!  I loved that there were so many different options here, with little tastes of Chinese, Japanese, and Thai foods. Something else I really liked was how the tea was served. It was brought over on a candle warmer, so it never got cold. They charge for tea, unlike most places, but I feel like the warmer coupled with how often they refilled it was well worth the couple extra bucks. And the decor is really eye catching. I loved that there were tons of little details to find. It definitely gives a nice atmosphere. Everything is red, and dark wood, and large, detailed pieces, with dim lighting. Not everyone is a buffet person, but if you're going to go to one, this should be it. This place puts the Mandarin to shame."}
{"text":"3 star for food  1 star for service 2 star for buffet layout  Equals 2 stars in total.  We had a birthday party here on a weekend night.  The food was quite good for a buffet with a decent selection.    However, what really ruined it for us was the sub par service, EVEN for a buffet.  The server at the lobster counter was rude.  We brought a birthday cake to celebrate and our waitress REFUSED (YES, REFUSED!!!!) to cut it.  In my entire life, this is probably the only time I have come up with a waitress who refused to cut a birthday cake.  So my husband ended up divying our cake up among 40 guests.  Not to mention that the waitress also \"forgot\" to give us the tickets for the 1/2 lobster that comes with the weekend dinner buffet until we asked.    The buffet layout was also tight.  Unlike other buffets where the food could be accessed from both sides of the counter, Dragon Pearl's buffet is situated almost against a wall so that guests can only access the food from one side.  This meant huge long line ups which we felt was designed to slow down a person's ability to fill their plate.  I think I lined up for 10 minutes just to get 1/2 a lobster.  Overall, coupled with the awful service, we felt it was just a cheap trick.    Probably would not return despite the better quality food."}
{"text":"This is one of the most interesting Buffet places I've been too. The decor is really interesting and unique with many stories lurking about. The food is tasteful, and it's nice to have a lobster come with the meal. The staff are nice, and the restaurant is huge. This is a bit on the pricey side for a buffet on the weekend, but once in a while, there's no harm in splurging"}
{"text":"Awful. Just awful. I've never had food this bad before.......  Everything was watered down and flavourless.  The pad thai was red tamirind noodles with no tomato stock, no peanuts, no green onions/shallots mixed in, and no bean sprouts. Just red noodles....... huh?!  The sushi was awful. Were talking rice, seaweed paper, some avocado and maybe some fake crab here and there.  The dessert they got right, but only the ice cream. Kinda hard to mess that up.  THis was the only restaurant that I had HALF a plate the entire time at a buffet. Im a fiend for Mandarin, but this place just turned me off completely. Even the roast beef was overcooked, and the mashed potatoes were completely flavourless. Everything tasted bad, it was like being stuck in a dennys all day.........The won ton soup was cold and the won tons were almost all unravelled in the soup stock, meaning it was sitting there for hours on end, and when I did taste it, it was almost completely flavourless too.  Avoid like the plague. No effort or service goes into this place, its there to lure white people in for \"authentic\" south asian cuisine.  The galleria supermarket next door serves better food in its hot plate section.  The service was almost non-existant. We'd wait 20 - 30 minutes for refills, and staff had almost no understanding or command of the english language, and were almost entirely brand new to Canada from Korea or China. Language barriers when patrons are hungry just fuel the fire of frustration and anger, and it shows here. Poor planning, crappy food choices, and awful service. We waited another 20 minutes for the bill, and have to pay up front for some reason, no table service. Completely stupid service strategy here..........you treat your patrons like dine and dash criminals and make them pay before they leave like welfare cases.  I'll never eat here again. Garbage. Anyone giving this place more than 1 star is almost completely insane or got the staff on a good day. Either way, dont waste your money here."}
{"text":"The place has very big space and nice decorations. However if they spent a bit more money on food quality and selection, the restaruant could have been much better!"}
{"text":"What happened to this place in the last year? Food variety has reduced.  Their signature pearl has been removed from their menu.  The two stations at maintain their quality are the roast beef and dessert station.  If I wanted roast beef and dessert, a Chinese Buffet would not be my first choice.    As for service .  We where there for a birthday party (a party of 17).  We understood that the every seating is for 2 hours.  At 1.5 hours they started to request that we finish our food and leave so they can get ready for their next seating.  The restaurant at this time was 1/2 full.  10mins later while we are still eating dessert, they started to clean everything off the table.  10mins after that the manager, Sophie, came by and told us we have to leave now because the people from the next seating are there and they have to seat them.  When we left, I approached Sophie and asked why they rushed us out for a full 1/2 hour.  We understand that there is another seating and made sure we left on time but they did not have to rush us a full 1/2 hour before our seating time was over.  All Sophie had to say was that she was sorry and have a nice day.  When I tried to get a better explanation from her, she tried to pull me aside and then gave me the same reply.    What I have learned from this experience... 1. This Reataurant is not looking for return customers. 2. Do not pay the check and tip 20% till you are ready to leave... Not even if they bring the check to your table 1/2 hour before your seating time ends and insist that you settle up then. 3. Never to return to this restaurant.   4. Deter others from going to this Resturant (unless you don't like them, then don't say anything).   The reason for the one star... for maintaining the quality of the roast and dessert stations and their decorations."}
{"text":"Really clean place with awesome interior decoration, and most importantly, very good food. It is a more upscale Mandarin.  All the food tasted good. Like the name suggests, it does not have much Western selection except for some of the grilled foods and dessert. Sushi tasted fine, sashimi was fresh. If you are looking for a place with a variety of good Asian food, this is the place. For the ambiance and food, the price is fair. It is very clean, and the servers are extremely professional and polite.  Less variety than other buffets, but every single item is very good. Quality over quantity (by quantity, I mean variety)."}
{"text":"Ever since this buffet has opened, I have been curious to give it a try since I have pretty much tried all the buffets in Toronto, Scarborough etc., The interior is quite nice and the seating of the chairs and tables are nicely made as well. There were some seating that had really high chair back look and some seats you can sit in a bird cage table. The presentation is where this buffet really focused on, instead, of great food quality and selection.  Not sure if there's a big difference between weekday dinner compared to weekend, but I came on a weekday and I would say the choices are pretty lackluster. Their desserts were probably bigger selection than the main meals. A plus is that they have pretty decent salmon sashimi and peking duck with wrap. The cocktail shrimp was also peeled and the size is pretty good as well. Besides that, I didn't see anything really tempting for me to try. Of course, I did try other food, but nothing too great about this place. BTW they do have a special noodle bar where you put  a bunch of stuff with their hand made noodles.  The server was decent, but a little pushy on drinks even though we mentioned we would think about it. Overall, I'd say $25 per person is not so good, and unless food specialty increases, then unlikely I will come dine again."}
{"text":"Food was good. Atmosphere was amazing. Service may have been better if I were a different nationality. I read a few reviews before I came regarding the rude treatment of non Asians. I didn't think this could be possible, now I see it to be true. I won't come back. Everybody deserves a lobster claw not just whom they choose. It's an unfortunate truth about an otherwise great place."}
{"text":"We were in this place several times before but quality of food has been gradually deteriorating. As my wife and I are seniors but with all of our teeth we cannot splurge on restaurants on regular basis. Tonight however we did and what a disappointment. Each of us got a ticket for so called lobster. It was half of the tail no claw and tough like shoe. I got lured by good looking rare beef. I am beef eater but this was cut wrong way and was tough to be even cut by restaurants table knife. Some of sweet and sour spare ribs were OK but some were so dried up as if left from previous day. Sushi bar was good and fresh and vegetables and mushrooms were excellent. Conclusion: NEVER will we go there again. If we would like Chinese food we will go to regular restaurant and order what we want. If any cuisine is not up to par you can send it back to kitchen.  Definitely not worth $70- for two seniors diners with 1 Coke and 1 tea"}
{"text":"I went there around 9.00 PM on Friday night...Girflriend and I were starving and only had one hour to devour all the foods.  It turned out to be a delight surprise! I would rate this restaurant a 5 star for sure! The selection of foods were great and the quality were good as well. I would definitely go here then to Buffet King.  Sure, $24.99 is quite a lot, but for the quality and the nice decor, I would definitely recommend this place to my friends. Sashimi was fresh, peking duck was good, lobster was good as well (they gave us a coupon for the lobster since they only serve it 1 per customer), etc.  Dessert selections and quality were great also. There's probably one off on both the foods and desserts, but I couldn't really remember anything that made our experience bad...so it was all good..  =)  Would I go back here? Definitely!  Hope that helps."}
{"text":"Whenever I go to a Chinese buffet,  I usually don't have high expectations. However, after reading the many positive reviews of Dragon Pearl before going for the first time last weekend, I did nurture hope for something a bit above average... and I was not disappointed!   Other reviewers have already detailed the various offerings, so I don't need to repeat them. What impressed me most about Dragon Pearl was that they clearly wanted to elevate the buffet experience. For example, there is a convenient hand washing station in the buffet area. The lobster ticket system ensures everyone gets a tail plus claw... no mad rush by a hungry crowd when they bring out the lobster like in other buffets.   The single lineup for the hot table is a bit annoying at peak times, but it eventually dissipates (just go get something else first); more importantly, the layout allows kitchen staff to refresh dishes more easily. As I was about to scoop up some filling for a \"crystal fold\" (a rarity at buffets), I was pleased when a server sprinkled crunchy fried vermicelli on top rather than letting it sit and get soggy.   Desserts are usually the weakest element in most Chinese buffets. Not so here! I was very happy to find a delicious assortment of real pastries and sweets.   So what are you waiting for? Go!"}
{"text":"Went to eat here a few times with my family and yes it does have pretty much everything and we actually liked it more than the other buffets that we went to."}
{"text":"This restaurant has a very nice traditional theme to it. There is even a part of this restaurant where you are able to sit on a huge boat. This is actually one of my favourite places to go celebrate with my family. The food is great, love the environment, love the service! Its a must try Chinese buffet!"}
{"text":"This buffet has a fairly good selection of food items. The restaurant itself is beautiful and has nice seating areas. The food was 4/5. Some of the items did not taste too well as expected. The servers come often to refill drinks and empty plates. Overall, it is a decent buffet to visit."}
{"text":"This is always a great place, I had people from out of town and they loved the place. The manager Ricky was phenomenal and made this experience so much more memorable, he went out of his way to prepare a creme brûlée for lunch and serve it to the table although this is a dinner dessert  Thank you so much Will"}
{"text":"Friend brought take out for a girls night in (included the hubby) the pork dumplings and crispy wontons were so great.  We also had sesame chicken, which started out great but as you kept eating, the more saltier it got.  The red curry was  not the best but edible.  I would definitely get take out again from here!"}
{"text":"This is one of the better buffets out there and one of the only ones I will go to.  They have tons of selection (including Japanese) and the food has always been fresh (and considered high quality for a buffet).  I wouldn't go here if I wanted something specific (as no buffet is the best at making any particular item), but if I wanted a lot of pretty good food I'd come here."}
{"text":"The interior is large and beautiful. They use high-quality wood taken from petrified old boats and this gives the furniture a really imposing presence. There are a variety of table and chair sizes, with some chairbacks towering high into the ceiling - it's really something. A lot of time and money went into making the interior unique.   The buffet itself is quite good. It's not as tasty as my other 4-star buffet (Tandoori Flame) but this is definitely the second best chinese buffet in the GTA (second only to Spring Roll's new AYCE menu). They serve shrimp for lunch and lobster, duck and salad wraps for dinner, and they have a deliciously sticky chicken dish that is unlike anything I've seen at a buffet (I forget the name - how embarassing). The salads and deserts are standard but always fresh and, most importantly, they keep refreshing the buffet even towards the end of service. They also have dragon noodle and dragon pearl samples available (by request).  Their service is much smarter than Mandarin as well. Mandarin has huge wait times even when the dining room is empty. That is because they have one person seat one party at a time, as the rest of the staff stands around and does nothing. This is infuriating when you have an hour for lunch. Here they seat multiple parties at a time, ensuring a quick service. It's common sense and wouldn't be worth mentioning if their competition - a major chain, no less - didn't mess it up.  On the other hand, it's a bit pricey (but worth it) and they never seem to vary the contents of the buffet, which makes it a bit boring for repeat customers. A few of the dishes are quite good but others are pretty standard fare - it would be nice if they could do away with some of the plain options and innovate a bit. Still, it's significantly better than the competition, and once you try Dragon Pearl you'll never waste a meal at Mandarin again."}
{"text":"Not a huge fan of eating at buffets but when you get invited by friends and family members and they promise you good food you can't say no. =)  Got to say...first impressions. WOW. The place is huge! The décor is pretty amazing. The food is a lot better than the typical buffets out there. Love how they make your noodles for you right there so it's fresh. It has a great selection of food and desserts there!   We didn't have to wait long for our reservation. They were able to accommodate additional people that showed up a bit later in the evening. The service there is great! There is always someone walking around waiting to take your empty or partially empty plates away and refill your drinks.  Overall, great place to go with friends and family. Just know that when you are done...you will feel your happy \"food baby\" bumping around. =)"}
{"text":"I usually do not like buffets, and i cannot remember the last time I have been to one.  That said, dragon legend was better than I expected.  Sushi was fresh, selection of rolls were relatively plentiful.  Their Peking duck was actually very decent, the wrap was not too thick, and the servers actually gave a large serving of duck for each wrap.      I got to sample an assortment of other cooked items such as their braised ox tail (ok), soup (tasted like the standard soup they serve at restaurants), sweet and sour pork, etc, and all were pretty much as expected, with the exception of their hand cut noodles, which were pretty solid!     Only complaint was the crab legs were very difficult to eat as they were not cut or pre-cracked for you.  Although they provided us with the shell crackers, the legs were too soft to effectively use them, so after spending what seemed like 10 min extracting the little bits of meat from two legs, I had enough.      Dessert is always my favorite, and I was very glad to see the presence of Chinese desserts along with the regular overly sweet cakes of sweet offerings.  Overall, if my friends or family wishes to have a buffet, I would not hesitate to suggest dragon legend."}
{"text":"So went to dragon pearl with a party of 30 people with the hope to have a nice family dinner...  Our experience here was anything but nice.  Firstly, we were constantly rush by the \"head waitor\" who informed us on multiple occasions that we had to finish eating by 7 o'clock and that some people in our party were still eating their meal at 630. There is nothing worse than being rushed to eat.  Secondly, they charged a 9 month old baby the cost of a child because he was nibbling on some noodles.  The cost was only $4 but still common how cheap can u get...   Ok so the food was okkk...  Better than ur average Chinese buffet..  Decent variety but definitely not worth all the nagging from the staff.  The service was sub standard and most importantly the attitude of the service staff management was completely unacceptable.     Overall dragon pearl u are not TooTuff approved!!!"}
{"text":"One of the best buffets that I have ever been to!  Sushi and seafood was very fresh and everything else was delicious! Service was also great. They have half lobster per person included"}
{"text":"I think it's same price as Mandarin, and their food options are quite the same as well. But in my opinion they definitely have more dessert options than Mandarin, and they are AMAZING!   Had a birthday dinner with my boyfriend there, they gave him a mini birthday cake and sang the song, it was quite a good experience for us. :)"}
{"text":"I went to dinner here this evening and have to agree with one of the people who had been there. We were only two people and we too felt rushed and at the end our bill came to our table and we weren't ready to go. I refuse to pay my bill and told them I wasn't ready and they too said, sorry but other people are waiting.\" At this point things didn't go very well, the manager came over and try to tell us how busy they were and that we had to get ready to leave!!! WTF?? I refuse to leave and told them when I was ready I would leave. They said,\"it's their policy\". I told them if I am going to pay $33.00 for dinner then no one is going to get my money and rush me out the door. As you can imagine things got worse and I was told they were going to call the police?? Really?? I told her I would sue her for the way she was acting  to a paying customer and how she  was rushing  us out.  At this point I refused to pay and I continue to eat my dessert and at this point they all speaking Chinese and the manager said, she very sorry. I don't understand this policy and from this day Forward I will not be returning to this place.  So if you want to go out to dinner don't come to this place, because after tonight I will NEVER COME BACK..."}
{"text":"Love this place! The food is fantastic, the service is good, and this establishment is clean overall.  I've been here 3 times on the weekend, when they served lobster as part of the buffet (you get one ticket to exchange for 1/2 of a small lobster - approximately 7\" long).  My only concern about this place is that it's very pricy for the type of food they offer! Expect to dish out about $35 on a weekend, after tip, tax and a having tea on the side... Which reminds me of my other disappointment -- they charge for tea?!?  I'm Asian myself, and have been to at least 200 different Asian restaurants in my lifetime (all over the world).  In all my experience, there has only been 3 Asian restaurants that charged for tea.  It is customary in asian culture to offer tea complimentary!"}
{"text":"Just ok.   The decor is interesting but the food doesn't live up to it. I was actually surprised that such a huge place would have such a relatively small buffet as far as dish options. Most dishes weren't bad, just nothing to write home about. The sushi was a bit dry and lacking in variety as well.   Service was just ok too.   In short, I didn't have a bad experience but i don't think I'll be going back."}
{"text":"Been here on several occasions  decor- 5/5, its pretty nice for a buffet!  food- they give u a lobster ticket upon entry (for dinner) so that's pretty sweet, the food is always hot and fresh, wide variety 4.5/5  service- good   i would definitely come back again"}
{"text":"Went a few days after the holidays.  Booked a private booth.  Simply the best Asian buffet around. Great sushi and sashimi. Peking duck is always delicious and this time they had a special spicy seafood mix which was superb. Also how could you say no to raw oysters! Shame they got rid of the lobster however.  Overall would recommend especially if your go to buffet is Mandarin!"}
{"text":"Just one sentence : I love this restaurant over any restaurant not only in Toronto but over the country .  Highly recommended because of many reasons,  the food is such fresh that you can't find in even expensive restaurants . The atmosphere is very sexy and warm that you like to stay there for a long time chatting with you family and friends. on Tuesdays, there is a special promotion that is 11.99 $ for lunch and 1.5 $ for green tea per each person.  I recommend the lobster in weekends which is given to you by a voucher . In sum, this restaurant put the Mandarin in real shame.  Highly highly recommended."}
{"text":"My group of five arrived Friday night at 8pm for dinner and even then there was a 15 minute wait.  When we were seated, I noticed that many people were finishing up their meal and tables start freeing up relatively quickly.    Dragon Pearl is definitely not cheap but I do believe that the quality of food does compensate.  In a typical Chinese buffet, dishes are typically drowning on oil (eg. sweet and sour pork, the vegetables, fried rice, fried noodles, etc).  At Dragon Pearl, the food feels very clean.  Not only, the sushi is actually decent quality (not just smoked salmon).  The night we went, each customer was eligible for a coupon to get lobster  Unfortunately, we didn't get a chance to try it but it seems like a nice option for those who like seafood.  Dessert selection is mediocre but their dessert tofu is pretty decent!  Either way, the time and day of the visit will most definitely affect the quality of the experience.  I would not come during expected high volume times (weekend nights, lunch times, etc) because the layout of the restaurant just makes crowding and waiting inevitable.    If I wanted to go to Dragon Pearl, I would most definitely pick a week day night or a later time to avoid the crowds."}
{"text":"First off, I generally dislike Chinese buffets and try and stay away as much as possible.  But I think Dragon Pearl is definitely better than Mandarin, China Buffet King (Richmond hill), Starwalk buffet (Scarborough).  They have higher quality food (with a smaller selection).  This is fine with me as I would rather eat better food anyway.  For dinner on a Sunday night, each person get a lobster ticket, which allows you half a lobster.  I think this is a better system as it allows then to serve better quality since you no longer having certain people abusing it.  (ie. just eating plates of lobster).  The Peking Duck was not that great.  The dessert selection is decent.  The decor is nicer than other Chinese buffet places.  And the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"When walking in the door of the Dragon Pearl Restaurant, you are greeted with these magnificent sculptures and masks that decorate the entrance way and the main dinning area makes you feel like you're in China.  The service was excellent, they came by our table every few minutes to ask if everything was ok, and to remove our dirty dishes.  The food was really good, I tried salads that I had never had before, such as, seaweed salad and kimchi salad, we got a half of a lobster for free, and way too much food to consume in one night.  I think you would need to eat there every night for a week straight in order to try everything from the buffet, I only wish that was possible.  I'm really looking forward to the next time we go there for dinner."}
{"text":"Very good restaurant and nice atmosphere!  The staff are very courteous and customer service oriented!  The food is very good and has good variety.  The only downside is the price for evenings and weekend is a little high.  I speak against this logic as the food remains pretty much the same.    Recommended as a place to go with family, friends, large or small groups and as a interesting place to go if you have never been."}
{"text":"Not sure if it's an everyday thing, but they only accepted cash or debit during their Tues special. They have change tables (both men and women washroom), high chairs and booster seats. Customers are rude though. Opened the door for an entire Asian frat boy club...not one said thank you. And I'm a girl."}
{"text":"So good for so little. Food is ok for most part and service was amazing. First time I ever willingly gave a big tip. it's been a year since i last went and i've been to other buffets but this one is still my favourite"}
{"text":"I always think that it is just another Chinese buffet.  Oh no! The décor is so much nicer.  The entrance is with the imitation of  12 lost bronze zodiac statues from the Old Summer Palace.  There are jewelry display along the corridor for sale.  The banquet hall is large mainly red in color.  With the dim light, it gives you a cozy feeling.  There are lot of choices with more than you can eat.  The food quality is much better than the normal Chinese buffet.  For the lobster, each person is given a coupon to exchange a live steam lobster, size is about 12 oz to 1 lb.  You have to pick your wrap and place your Peking duck on top with condiments.  It looks good on the plate.  There is station to order your freshly boiled noodles.  Food supply is no question.  The tea is refillable and is good quality.  I like the big Pearl sesame ball but some thought it is too oily.     I am going soon again for another night !"}
{"text":"One of the better buffets imo. Always ask for a lobster claw when u present ur ticket they will give it to u happily but uou have to ask lol. Peking duck is my fav. Pretty similar in quality and selection to star wok when it was open. Service is good."}
{"text":"The interior decor and the Dragon Pearl dessert specialty are what sets this restaurant apart from other Chinese buffet restaurants.   Stepping into the place, it's different.  Decor is in grand proportion. The dim lighting and layout are unique for a buffet restaurant.  After the initial oohs and awe were settled I evaluated the food without bias. There are some notable items here at lunch that give the buffet good value.   The Prime Rib, BBQ chicken, Roasted chicken, Terriyaki Salmon, BBQ pineapple all were excellent.  Everything else though was pretty mediocre tasting.  An okay choice of a restaurant if you're selective and don't go crazy putting everything on your plate."}
{"text":"Amazing decor,  great service and delicious food. My friend and I both agreed better mandarin. The golden shrimp was proper and the peking duck was succulent."}
{"text":"Love this place! The buffet is amazing with a tonne of variety and the food is always hot and fresh. I love coming where on the weekends when they have fresh lobster!"}
{"text":"I went there for my 30th birthday and my bill was over 800 dollars. They asked me how much tip. I always give 20 percent tip but because I was paying for over 800 and it's a buffet style, the server complained and told me it should be 10 percent tip so he pressured me to give close to 100 dollar tip. Gratituity is extra. I was alright with the service until he pressured me to pay more. He also rushed us at the very end to leave. Because of that I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Beautiful ancient Chinese feel and luxury settings and atmosphere.  Food is average compared to other similar style Chinese buffet.  We had one free lobster, probably they were doing special.  It is more expensive than other Chinese buffet places.  I wouldn't go there again unless I am in the area."}
{"text":"First timers are always optimistic when they enter a restaurant for the first time. Dragon Pearl has all the ingredients to be a first class Asian buffet. The place is big and tables are roomy. Ambiance is good. Parking is adequate. Staff are friendly.  I was there for a Sunday dinner. Buffet is smaller than Mandarin and therefore does not have the same variety. They have all of the standard favorites....salad bar, sushi bar, prime rib, lobster tail (1 per customer), Peking duck and of course a dessert bar. On the night I attended some of the items left a lot to be desired. The Bad.....sushi was stale (very dry rice), as if rolled earlier in the day and left out. Hot items were barely warm. Bread rolls were like rocks. Lobster tail was tiny and dry (over cooked). Table chairs weigh a ton. The Good.....no huge crowds, sesame chicken and Peking duck were full of flavor. Soups were tasty and hot. Staff are very attentive. Overall not overwhelming but not awful. Worth another shot."}
{"text":"Just went there today for a birthday party. And as always, I get too excited when it comes to free food ... sigh. So anyway, all I can say about the decorations is... COOL :D I do like the earrings and jewelry on display.  (P.S. they're not $100 jewelry just so everybody knows.)  Food:  As of right now, I wouldn't say that I can absolute rate the place 100% of my ability because I've just been there once, and from my first visit id say that the food seems just like every other Buffet places. They do serve Lobster, Squid (I like), and Steak.  Also, I'd like to take point that they do have those nice, crispy, giant pearl things for dessert. It tastes so goood XD  Service:  I like the service! The waiters are attentive and does a great job at keeping their customers satisfied.  Prices/Menu:  Same as every other Buffet places.   Overall:  I don't dislike it, but since I've only been there once, I wouldn't mind coming back again :D  And hopefully I get those nummy Pearl dessert things XD"}
{"text":"I've been a few times. It used to be quite good (relative to other buffets) in terms of the food quality and variety, but lately both have deteriorated. The major redeeming quality of this place is the decor, which is very unique (some tables even have their own motif). The biggest downside is the price is a little high. I would recommend trying this place at least once, if for nothing else than to check out the decor."}
{"text":"Interesting atmosphere, obviously a very kind of post-modern Chinese look on the inside, with dark lighting and these interesting almost bird cage-y looking decorations around (I think there were lanterns, too).  Food was decent though the sushi selection could've been bigger. Pretty decent mashed potatoes too for a Chinese buffet, though my picky caucasian friend disagreed. Pretty and spacious. I went here for my birthday randomly and it was fun.  Not a huge fan of buffets but this one was pretty good. :)"}
{"text":"If you're cluster phobic stick to mandarin. Lobby 200 sq ft Buffet area 400 sq ft Busy and tight Got the bill and told my time is up gtfo.  Food is maybe even a bit better.. But the items above made it a disappointing experience ."}
{"text":"Brought my guy here for his birthday and I must say that the decor of this place is pretty interesting.  With giant wooden chairs, petrified wood, and even a boat, it makes for some nice eye candy.  The food itself was pretty good with a nice sushi/sashimi selection, dim sum, peking duck, etc.  Since it was the weekend we all got half a steamed lobster.  We sampled the giant dragon pearl and watched them make one giant continuous noodle strand. Being a seafood lover I was happy to see the salad section had large sized peeled shrimp for me to enjoy endlessly.  One nice touch was the small hand-wash station near the buffet to quickly wash your hands without having to got all the way to the bathroom.  I would come back here again and try to con a few non-seafood loving friends to come along, just to take advantage of their one per person lobster ticket.  (Yeah I know I am a seafood addict and must be stopped)"}
{"text":"I had Dragon Pearl for lunch today, and it was good, but I do prefer the dinner because of the Peking duck wraps and lobster. Lunch was still decent because of the noodle station. I chose the Shanghai beef soup noodles.  The prime rib was tasty but the generic buffet food was adequate."}
{"text":"Fun place. Food was like Mandarin with a live hand made noodle station. Dragon pearls were cool and decor was really neat. People behind the food stations actually smile and greet you, nice!"}
{"text":"We came here for Mother's Day last year. The service was just bad. They weren't rude, but they were very unpleasant, pushy, like they didn't want to be there. Grouchy even. This wasn't a good first impression, but I still wouldn't have cared about the bad service if it wasn't for the terrible food.   A lot of the food trays at the buffet were empty, and some of them took 10-15 minutes to be restocked. Any food that was there was cold, like it had been sitting out there for a long time. I'm not sure how it could have been sitting out there a long time, because the place was packed on Mother's Day; in any case, the point is, the food was cold.   We only came here to try something different from Mandarin for a change, but we'll just be going to Mandarin next time. I wouldn't recommend Dragon Pearl Buffet."}
{"text":"I just went there an hour ago for a friday dinner, costed me $24.99 which was okay considering the food quality and decor. It is not very bright in there, it has a dark sort of feeling so it gives your more privacy the seat setting also have a great advantage of setting up privacy for each table. I dont really like when we have to eat like in a canteen. The service was outstanding, greeted when we came in, staffs were really polite and friendly. For the food, it was above average generally, much better than mandarin/panda/super buffet although I heard the owner also owns panda and super. The dessert and fruit section is probably the best among all other buffets, although not excellent like you would eat in a hotel but generally it was above average. There were also roast beef, japanese bbq section, cute little pizzas for kids, sushi also sashmi, a bit of thai although not so great they taste just like chinese. I tried the one end noodle it was great havent tried the dragon pearl cuz it cost $9 and i think it is just for fun like when you have a group of people celebrating something. Overall a 7/10, probably wont be back again though cuz there's nothing really special or stands out that i want to go back and try. Bear in mind tho the food was above average, if you want a nice dinner with your friends or family this is definitely a place to go. There are certainly some food that other buffet rest dont.   Service 10/10 Decor 10/10 Food Variety 8/10 Food Taste 7/10  I would say only improvement is to try making every dish special with unique taste because most of the dishes taste quite similar, that would encourage me to visit again"}
{"text":"The Chinese dishes were pretty average, although acceptable for buffet. There were two dishes that I thought were really good: the prime rib, and the hand-cut noodles. The big crunchy deep fried pearl they display at the front (next to the noodle station) is pretty yummy too. The fruits were really sweet and fresh, and there was a great selection of delicious desserts.  The decor of the restaurant is nicer than the average Chinese buffet, so it's a kind of grand place to go when you're celebrating something."}
{"text":"Horrible experience! My mom and I were eating sushi here, she felt really sick at the resturant and now as i am typing this we are at north york general hospital! The doctor said this is becase of the toxin that is made in these fishes if it is not safely prepared!! I am planning to report these guys to health official!"}
{"text":"The food is okay. The service is okay. Nothing over the top except for their interior decorations. Crazy wooden furnitures everywhere. I prefer this one compared to mandarin and other chinese buffet."}
{"text":"Short and simple.  Pros: - Just like everyone said, the interior is phenomenal, right when you step into the door.  - Food is pretty good, though many are saying better than Mandarin, I beg to differ. - Not sure if it's a huge plus, but the plates are red, pretty unique from the boring white. - I stayed in a private room with a nice long table and private bathroom. Accommodated seven other people with me. - Service was impeccable! Best service around! Gave a pretty huge tip too.  Cons: - The damn table gave me a splinter on my leg, wasn't fun. - The lines are a bit long, not TOO long, but you do have to wait. - The Dragon Pearl it's self is an eye catcher, but tastes like your taking a bite into oil ... Pretty bad for $8.99 - You are given lobster 'Coupons' (one per person) to take to the BBQ section, which I think is pretty stupid because I expected the lobster to be all you can eat. As compared to Mandarin where it's all you can eat, that's a bit of a let down for Dragon Pearl. - The Pekking Duck isn't 'Genuine', not complaining all that much ... But I am a huge fan of duck.  All in all, I think it's a nice place, WAY better than Imperial Buffet, though not as good as Mandarin and Star Walk. I would go back here again if I had a HUGE group of people which I did at the time, only because the decor is amazing and is a more better place for social gatherings compared to other buffets."}
{"text":"I've been to Dragon Pearl Buffet on countless occasions and/or events. I am such an advocate for this buffet. It's not your local cheap buffet like some out there that I won't mention. Their selections are great, I've noticed that they've changed or added more to the buffet and it's always exciting to see and eat that (haha)!  The service is great, we had three servers helping us (12 guests) from our last visit and they were polite and professional as they served us and collected our plates.   Obviously the food tasted great as well, I love how they offer salmon sashimi for lunch on the weekends! I was super stoked about that. Last year we made a special order for my dad's birthday for the restaurant to make us the 'Dragon Pearl', but I like to call it the Dragon Ball. It was so cool and it tasted nice. Definitely my favourite Chinese buffet in Toronto. In fact, I'm craving it again as I type out this review. I recommend this place and it's great for groups."}
{"text":"Disappointing trip to dragon pearl. Long wait. Met with empty trays and slow to replenish. 30 minutes later they announce they are closing everything down. 2 trips up.. Nothing worthwhile. Never repeat"}
{"text":"Great food and service. They got huge dining area which is good for parties! Everyone was able to find their own loving dishes, this place is probably one of the best Chinese buffet in the area!"}
{"text":"When they first opened, I visited twice and due to it's novelty, thought it was a good place for the variety of food and for large groups.  I visited last weekend, here are my comments: the oysters weren't fresh, the fried oysters were overcooked, and the peking duck average at best. The wrap was too thick and cool, the duck skin wasn't consistently crispy. For what you get, the $35.99 price tag is not worth it. They also charge $2.99 for kids under 5 and $17.99 for kids 5 and up - my 5.5 yr old niece had a small bowl of noodles and a few cucumber rolls - not worth it!!"}
{"text":"Ayce fresh oysters for Sunday dinner!!! Buffet selections and food quality are pretty good. I really enjoy Peking duck (not the pancake wrap) every time I come here.  Better service than most buffet restaurant. Washroom was very dirty on my last visit."}
{"text":"This place reminds me of the beautiful models we see on TV. When they are young it's wonderful but then and then they get lazy and let themselves go.  When this place first opened few years ago it was very good... But not sure what happened now. The food during lunch seems bit stale... The variety is less than mandarin but their prices are higher.  Even the deserts like cakes seem not fresh.  Probably the last time I go here and pay regular price."}
{"text":"I have found the rest of the stolen relics of ancient China! It's at the lobby of this Buffet on York Mills...  Dragon's Pearl has to be the most ridiculous restaurant I have ever been in all the GTA. At first I was deterred from coming here, because the flyer I received in the mail had spelling mistakes. But to quote my friend Chris: \"Usually restaurants with spelling mistakes have good food, because they won't waste time trying to spell things, and just focus on the food.\" What a load of bollocks... So I've come here twice so far, and it's a miracle I've made it out alive both times.   There is always somehow a crowd of people hanging out by the door, even when there is no wait..there they are. Did someone pay them to loiter here so it appears that reservations are hard to come by? By the lobby, I was met by the heads of the twelve animals of the Chinese Zodiac. The replicas of the relics that Britain stole from China and refuse to return which was featured in the news? Well, the Chinese news anyway. There were swarms of people waiting for a table, and immediately I regretted not making reservations. However, we were sat upon arrival because there were only two of us. Walking in the venue for the first time is a \"trip\" itself. The spine of the chairs at the long tables were taller than I was, there are elevated tables on boats, and four round booth that were bird cages. The other tables had chairs so heavy, I struggled like I suffered from obesity simply trying to stand up to get more food as the arm rests kept getting in the way. Some buffets discourage you from eating more by adding MSG or other things to the food, I guess this one discouraged you using shame... There are European chandeliers hanging from the ceiling, but the furniture were oriental. Wood everywhere like it was cabin fever, and busts of the strange blue statue outside with swirly tits hanging from the walls. I asked a waitress what the blue thing was, and she just smiled at me. If I were apart of the blue man crew, I'd be talking to my Lawyer. The entire place felt like a theme park, they even give you an individual \"lobster ticket\" before seating. A voucher for lobster....food ticket, literally. I felt like I was back in 1992 Communist China, lunchtime.  Nothing matched, it was horribly eclectic. It were as if the designer had Mad Décor Disorder. Picture: Columbus arriving in Asia, and the first person he met was Tim Burton.  Normally, buffet stations are set separately. At this place, it's all one sided, stretching across the entire length of the restaurant, which is a traffic catastrophe. It was the Great Wall of Dragon's Pearl. You vouch for your lobster at the beginning of the line, this is a huge tack, but most other buffets never offer lobster..so it's forgiven. I've forgotten about the unusual design of this place once at the Great Wall..I mean food station. There is so much food! A handsome selection of seafood, a sushi station where the chefs behind the counter doesn't have to feel ashamed about, and even a Peking Duck point!  The desserts and salad bar weren't too shabby either. At the end, there is a noodle pulling station. Which means everything was fresh. But I didn't bother with that, because I just don't have the stomach for it after slobbering my plate. The quality of the food is a bit above other buffets as well, and there is a completely boring projection on the wall while you're getting your food...for no apparent reason.  At this rate, you'd expect the service to fall short, but it just doesn't. Napkins and refills came regularly, most of the time without having to ask for it. Even the ambient music here was tolerable. This is what would happen if Chef Ramsay opened an 'All you can eat' joint. There is simply very little to complain about.  Yes, I felt fatter each time I struggle to stand up from my seat. Yes, the concept of a lobster ticket is as kitsch as it gets. Yes, getting the food made me feel like I was in a concentration camp. But it's all good! I strike fear in the hearts of places like Mandarin and Buffet King, but Dragon's Pearl laughs at me, as I've never been able to get beyond three plates, and still have enough endurance for dessert.  Yes, this was like a endurance test. Like a Marathon, only the opposite.   The second time we came here, after paying the bill we saw our friend at another table getting up for food with his girlfriend. So we quickly went to their table and sat down, confusing the hell out of the waitresses. When they came back, we pretended to look through the drinks menu, which sent them looking for their tables until they realized what we've done. That's the kind of euphoric state I am rendered to after dining here. Don't park your car too far from the entrance, you won't make it back if you do. Oh, you can also buy jewelry here..?   Dragon's Pearl. I would hate to see the size of the oyster that dragon had to swallow just to get to that pear"}
{"text":"For Asian buffet this is one of the best in Toronto. The half lobster I had was really good. Everything was pretty awesome, sushi was decent."}
{"text":"I am not a big buffet person, but I really liked Dragon Pearl! It is so nice and spacious; table-spacing ensures that you don't have to worry about bumping into anyone's chairs while you put your 3 plates of food down!  Upon entering the restaurant, we were greeted with smiles and \"Welcome!\" and \"Is this your first time...\" - what! At an Asian buffet? Service was en pointe right from the start. A hostess led us to our table and, soon after, our waitress came over and asked us what we would like to drink. FYI - wine by the glass choices are extremely limited, but I still ordered a glass of the Jackson-Triggs, red.  After that, my family dispersed to the buffet stations. Choices, in my opinion, are all right, but quality is definitely above average. I filled myself silly with Sushi and Corn. Best food combo ever.  Another buffet place I usually frequent is Wasabi, and frankly, I will take Dragon Pearl any time. Our plates were continually taken away and fresh napkins placed frequently. Drinks replenished and always with a smile!   What I really loved about this place was the Dessert section. Sure, they had the signature ice creams, but what really wowed me over was their \"Flower Tofu\". I had 4 bowls of the stuff! I could have just eaten that for my whole meal.  Overall, great experience. Service, I have to repeat, was just great which made the whole experience that much better.   Great for groups and celebrations. Will be back!"}
{"text":"For the first time here, the overall impression/decor is very nice and atleast something to behold this place went all out! You'll see! Seating is very spacious, especially if you come a touch later into the evening or lunch hour, say about an hour and a half to two hours after they open, the herd will pretty much have eaten and left. The staff are very swift and courteous in getting you to your table and the server is there shortly thereafter to ask for your drink order and explanation of things being served that evening, nice! Oh! And for us being first timers, we were brought in to the food area and given a tour and full directions as to where EVERYTHING was located, cool! They even have a hand washing station located in and just off to the side of the serving area, definitely saves time instead of having to go to the bathrooms. Servers are constantly coming around your table to either clean and replace your plates/drinks or just to ask if everything's going ok and that we're enjoying ourselves. After three plates I and my stomach had to conceed. But we will be back and so should you, come hungry only because everything else will be taken care of for you! Bon appetite"}
{"text":"A buffet that is far superior to the Mandarin. Selection is excellent and plentiful. Prices are comparable to other buffet restaurants. A lot of the usual stuff for those who have unimaginative palates but also dim sum, sushi, Peking duck, lobster and roast meats and soups made to order. The decor is spectacular and watching the Pearl being made pretty cool. Kind of weird that the restaurant sells jewelry though."}
{"text":"This restaurant was ok, not great but just ok. For $1 more at lunch than Mandarin ($12.99 vs $11.99) with less food options and bad set up (lineups at each station b/c you can only go to one side of the table I would rather not return. If they corrected their buffet tables it would be a great improvement. Decorations are unique and large tables are fun but again, not as many food options so I don't think I will return unless coerced by co-workers again."}
{"text":"I recommend reserving a table if you come here because it's very packed! This place is hands down better than Mandarin! Our server was very polite and nice with greeting us and refilling our drinks and taking our empty plates fairly quickly. Fast workers working hard. The food tasted fresh . don't forget to try their PEKING DUCK ROLLS I love their PEKING DUCK ROLLS OMG. Their salad section with all the fruits and other small food condiments was a good variety. Their sushi section had a good amount of different sushi to choose from, there was also sashimi which is what I also fell in love with !! I was disappointed by the sweets section though so I only went for ice cream. It's a pretty typical Asian buffet, red decor, we actually sat in a birds cage designed table, although there was some weird Asian documentary going on in the background but I didn't pay any mind to it loll food is none the less decent, I really like this buffet , I'll be back soooooon"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Fresh affordable and great service. A little far to drive but worth the time . No More Mandarin..."}
{"text":"Nicely decorated especially the cool boat seating and the bird cage looking booths.  Nice variety of food to pick from. Sushi, Peking duck, Ribs, roast beef, etc.  Went on weekday so did not get the Lobster. boo. will go back next time for it.  Overall pretty good buffet as it is clean and had good variety."}
{"text":"I loved the seating and the environment. Each person gets a coupon for half of lobster and it was very tasty. I think lobsters only appear for dinner.  Other than that, everything's too salty and greasy. Just think of it as chinese food at a food court.  At the end, the price is a bit higher than the quality of the food. We paid over $200 as 5 ppl."}
{"text":"Quite a nice buffet with a huge variety of dishes. They have a variety of dishes that aren't served in a typical Chinese buffet including Peking duck, lobster, longevity noodles, dragon pearl, etc. Not a cheap buffet but well worth the price."}
{"text":"This post is for my \"good\" friend Minnie.  A while back she mentioned Dragon Pearl.  I ignored her.  It's technically not my fault.  Dragon Pearl has a whole lot going against it.  It's Chinese food.  It's a buffet.  It's gimicky - see here (that pearl has zero appeal to me).    Nothing works in its favour.    But last weekend it caught a break.  See, once in a blue moon, I get a chinese buffet craving.  Had I not been with Minnie the day of said craving, I would have gotten over it.  Since she was with me when I said it, she put Dragon Pearl on the table.  I was about to take it off, when she insisted that I would like it.  She said it wasn't your usual chinese buffet, and that even if it was, at least we'd get a free lobster tail - and not the scrappy kind but a full large meaty lobster.  She persisted and ended her pro-Dragon Pearl speech by saying that it might be the best Chinese buffet in Toronto.  Big words for little girl.    Persistence pays off.  She was right.  Dragon Pearl is not your mother's buffet.  It will by no means make your heart sing from culinary delight, but it might make you dance, albeit offbeat and poorly.  A dance nonetheless.    The entire place is full of petrified wood. It makes for very dramatic dining but odd.  That aside, the food is not bad - there are some terrible things but doesn't every buffet?  Overall it's not as greasy, and there is more substance than filler, including handmade noodles and peking duck.  I LOVE PEKING DUCK.    Not the greatest.  But for all-you-can-eat, it's good enough.   I won't be going back anytime soon.  Like I said, I rarely do buffets, of any kind.  But if I had to, I'd do Dragon Pearl again.  It's $25 for dinner per person on weekends ($21 Monday to Thursday).  Other bloggers have said it's expensive.  Really?  Mandarin is $18 for dinner per person on weekends.  $7 for better food.  Sounds reasonable to me.  It is the best Chinese buffet I've had.  Yes.  I went there.  Sidebar:  Cheap fortune cookie at end.  Expected. Cheapest fortune cookies ever.  Not acceptable. Dragon Pearl - Sell a petrified chair and buy better cookies."}
{"text":"Many choices of food, but the staffs are kind of slow removing the used plate in my table, everytime I come back to eat my new plate of food, the old one is still sitting in my table."}
{"text":"Best way to describe this place is that it is a better version of mandarin. In all aspects."}
{"text":"Dragon Pearl is great for accommodating large groups. Save yourself some time and call ahead for a reservations. I was able to get last minute reservations for a party of 8 on a Saturday for dinner no problem. You get better located tables when you call ahead as well.  The food selection here is one of the best I've seen at a chinese buffet. There are carving stations, a noodle bar and loads of Chinese food options, with a sprinkling of North American fare. Roast Beef and gravy isn't what I would call typically Chinese.  On weekend evenings you get a lobster ticket that gets you have a tail and 1 claw. It's on the rubbery side, but I still enjoyed it.  The peking duck is a popular option. I loved it. It was crispy, tender and a nice treat.  This is not an ideal place to bring your loved one on a romantic date, it's a family friendly restaurant, it's loud and it's gaudy. The waiting area is not large enough to accommodate the large crowds they get.  Wait staff are friendly, albeit a bit standoffish. They're quick here and what I believe can sometimes come across as pushiness is actually just the fact that they are efficient.   As a Chinese buffet it gets 4 stars. Don't expect a fine dining experience, it is a buffet afterall, and you shouldn't be disappointed."}
{"text":"There is a lot to like about this place but mostly it is the decor. I find this place fun, the food is not bad (just OK) and the decor is interesting. A great place for private parties and this is definitely a good alternative to Mandarin, not better, just a good alternative."}
{"text":"The ambiance is great here, food is replenished more frequently than other buffet places, so you don't find food sitting out for two long and end up being dry and disgusting.  Though I believe the sister restaurant offers a bit more variety."}
{"text":"How does this not exist closer to me??? Unique decor, great service, amazing price and GREAT TASTING FOOD!!!!  Roast beef, bbq chicken, veggies galore. Sushi/sashimi, bbq pork ribs, curry fish balls, stir fry, and the BEST THING EVER??? PEIKING DUCK AND WRAPS. PEIKING DUCK WRAPS. PEIKING DUCK WRAPS. Boston NEEDS a place like this NOW.   the chairs are too clunky for a buffet esp since people come back to their tables with plates, yes I came back with more than one plate lol, and its hard to get back into your chair without almost losing the plate of food.   Basically, I hope this place is around when we come back to visit family and I want to come back here. I'm drooling as I type."}
{"text":"Great experience gathering with friends. However, the only problem I had was that plates wasn't wash properly. I found some with food stains at the bottom if the plate."}
{"text":"Dragon Pearl is a great alternative to Mandarin. It feels a bit more authentic and offers more choices, however everything feels very slow there. It seems like no energy and desire exists in management."}
{"text":"(4.5*) Chinese food done right no white washing involved. Also their sush selection is better than mandarin and wok of fame and their seafood is so flipping fresh.   I loved their spicy cray fish, peking duck rolls (limited to two plates/person), freshly cut noodle soup and dumplings, and vegetable stir fry with lotus root and wood ear mushroom so much i think  coud live here everyday off of those four items.   They've downgraded their lobster since they opened but lets face it, they already have top tier chinese food and lobster is f*cking expensive, can't blame em for it. This place has still got my respect. But they could still work on the roast beef lol still too bland and the paired sauce sucks :P"}
{"text":"I really wanted to try this place because everyone has gone and that gigantic ball is all I can think about. In reality it is a sesame ball and it's not free lols. From what I read online, you pay an additional $10 to taste it - is someone digging for more money? Most Asian AYCE restaurants are filled with Chinese people but this place boasts some superb decor that attracts all the races. I was surprised to see so few Chinese people, except for maybe the staff haha. Anyhow, the place really brings you back to Ancient Chinese times but damn these chairs were not comfy. I mean the seating is soft but I felt like falling off whenever I moved too much.  Food is average but a few things really stood out. I recommend: peking duck, roast beef, sushi, sashimi, chicken wing, and veggies. I have been to many buffets and I think Dragon Pearl does a good job of making all their dishes consistent. I don't agree on the pricing but every restaurant has inflated their prices nowadays. You are paying $25.99 per adult on a weekday and that means no lobster too. The soup is actually not too bad but I felt that it had lots of MSG. One thing that stood out was the service. I love it when people refill my water without asking, that is actually a requirement when I look for boyfriends (I know, I'm crazy). I think the only warning you need is that their kitchen closes at 9:30pm. These asians work so fast, they are mopping the floors at 9:31pm. We came shortly after 8pm so we had a solid 1.5h to enjoy our food, thought my parents complained it was rush. A tiny observation is that the soup bowls are big and since I can't carry shit, this is a big bonus. For once, I don't need to worry about dropping my bowl while walking."}
{"text":"Good food and service. Enough space to host Birthday parties and family get together lunches."}
{"text":"Went there for a lunch meal. The environment was nice however food was soso at best."}
{"text":"Went here to celebrate a birthday and thought it was pretty good. The decor of the place is nice and their selection is great. Food consisted of lobster, Peking duck, sushi, roast beef, and regular Chinese food. I thought the sushi was pretty good, sashimi tasted good. The Peking duck here was not great. The wrap was soggy and wet. Nonetheless, I was a huge fan of their deep fried oysters. As for the dessert, I loved their creme brûlée! It was delicious! I would definitely come back here. The only downer was that they only give you a free birthday meal for a party of 5 and it's only valid on week days."}
{"text":"I'm no stranger to buffets in this end of the city: Mandarin, Wasabi, other-sketchy-Japanese-place, Imperial; you name it. Dragon Pearl is particularly close to my place, so there's an added bonus. After reading all of these reviews and then actually eating here, I can safely reaffirm what Candace, Tony, and everyone else has said.  Yes, the decor was splendid. Yes, there was a good array of food. Yes, the servers are on the pushy side (asking \"Are you done with that?\" while your fork and knife are still on your 2/3-finished plate). Oh, and speaking of your utensils, we had to ask for chopsticks. And they were those bleached, stuck-together chopsticks that came in those little paper packets.   We had Peking duck, a nice treat. The duck was sliced thickly, the sauce a bit too sweet (or maybe I put too much?), the crepes on the thick side as well. There were chefs beside the Peking duck counter grilling meats in little batches, some of it on skewers. Plenty fresh and no complaints there.   Then there was the sushi. The salmon and \"Oil fish\" sashimi were both fresh and lovely. The sushi itself was a little bland, but I've had worse at AYCE sushi places. (The spicy sushi wasn't spicy.) Also, several of their rolls were deep-fried. *wince* They have little sushi plates with partitions so you can put your sushi condiments in them! Sorry, I'm a sucker for that sort of thing.  The salad bar seemed relatively untouched - I barely saw anyone go there. But then again, who goes to a buffet for cold macaroni salad drenched in mayo anyway? I was only there because of a strawberry-walnut-banana salad that was just. freaking. awesome.   The hot foods were honestly typical Chinese buffet fare. There was less \"take-out\" style food like chicken balls than Mandarin. And yes, the food containers aren't deep. It does seem fresher.   And dessert was a ton of fresh fruits (watermelon, grapefruit, pineapple, and more), puddings, waffles (waffles!) plus condiments, tarts, little pastries, almond cookies, honey twists, cheesecake, etc. (Can you tell that I focused mainly on the desserts?!)   We stayed well over two hours with a large group of rowdy younger people. They never complained, even when we were clearly done eating and just sitting around. Although a friend swears he saw a dirty look from a waitress, I never did myself.   Last thing: I don't know if it was just that week or month or whatever, but they asked if we had any February birthdays as soon as we walked in. We didn't, but we had a January one. Seeing as it was the first of February, they gave us a free dinner for that person anyways. And offered her a piece of cake at the end. (Lol.) I'm not sure if you need a minimum number of people dining with you for that, but just so you know."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant, the food is always fresh and tasty. The decoration is very nice. I am trying to find out the green tea brand they serve here. Does anyone know?"}
{"text":"I must agree with the other yelpers, for an Asian buffet...this one has to be one of the best and probably one of my top choices.  I went for the first time on a Sunday night and they did not disappoint at all.  It's a big buffet place, probably not the biggest I've been to, but a good size.    I definitely got my monies worth that night!  From the Cajun boil seafood mix, to the Peking duck, to the raw oysters and sushi and more?!?!?? How can you really go wrong?  Even their simple shanghai noodle dish was was good.  The food was always topped off whenever it was low and everything just had great flavour.  Most buffets are just salty, greasy foods but Dragon Pearl is doing it right.  Customer service was friendly and enough waiters walking around to ask for anything if you needed to.  Also a good spot for large groups if you can make a reservation.  I would definitely suggest getting there as soon as dinner starts as I'm sure the wait time might be long if you don't have a reservation.  I'm not sure how the lunch menu is or their weekday menu, but the weekend menu dinner is definitely worth it."}
{"text":"We had a party of 60 people and there were constant reminders and nagging from the minute we were seated that we had exactly 90 minutes to eat.  There was constant pressure to get the cake out for cutting and the fact that someone else needs to use our table.  Definitely never coming again!  Would never recommend!"}
{"text":"We were here a few days with a group of 4. I enjoyed the atmosphere, food, and show! We came here for dinner time and I was pleasantly surprised with the food variety and taste! They had sushi and sashimi, hot food station, soup, salad bar with seafood and even crayfish!, dim sum (har gaw and siu mai), Western cuisine, kids station (pizza), and a dessert station with cakes, pastries and ice cream! Around 8pm they had a nice show to entertain the crowd. Staff were superb! Very friendly and attentive, they made sure to refill our water, bring napkins and clear dishes without us reminding them!   The only thing I didn't like was the noise level, animal pouching videos after the show (Natural Geographic channel I'm guessing?) and the fruit tarts were stale with strawberries wilting and spoiled inside.   Overall, for the price and experience I'd recommend this establishment!"}
{"text":"This place is good. I love their food and everything. They even have a robot to help them make theyre noodles for ramen. Lots of options for desserts as well. 4stars because out server was slacking."}
{"text":"Beautiful decor, above average buffet.  Attentive service.    My first time here, I was impressed at the decor - I'm an old Mandarin's buffet fan, so wasn't sure what to expect but the Dragon Pearl's exotic decor - with a couple of Chinese boats in the middle of the room - gave the restaurant an upscale vibe.  Giant dessert section, sushi, carving stations, hot Cantonese food, soups - the restaurant covers a lot of food.  Minor misses include not having chopsticks or soy sauce readily available - yoou have to find them hidden at the sushi section.  I wouldn't say the food was 100% authentic as the wontons were of the thick wrapper variety, but fortunately, the seafood was very fresh and devoid of Krab!  The waiters were very attentive, clearing plates as soon as you moved in your chair!  I'd definitely go back.  Very enjoyable and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I have been to this buffet four times in the last few years, and my recent experience was the best. Good selection. Good food. Quick replenishing. Quick service. I went on a Sunday for lunch so it was busy, but everything was consistent. Most of the items I had were delicious. Try their specialties! The noodles!! The dessert section was probably the most disappointing in taste, but that's why I usually stick to ice cream at buffets."}
{"text":"Dragged here for a birthday party.  Definitely not my kind of place.  But if I have to go to a massive chinese buffet, I prefer Mandarin.  The food is not very much different, but the food stations are laid out better at Mandarins, so you spend less time in crowded lines, waiting for someone's Buba to finish picking mini corns out of the Cantonese chow mein.  Dragon Pearl is definitely more upscale than Mandarins, but it's a bit kitschy for me.  As a rule, I like to avoid restaurants with gift shops.    This place reminds me of something you'd find in Myrtle Beach - and you really don't want to get me started on that lost week."}
{"text":"Not a fan, but they are one of the only restaurants who still served hot crab legs. Similar to dragon legend, they have a wide variety of Chinese and Taiwanese dishes, including Peking duck. Something that stands out is that you can get a \"dragons pearl\" in which they fry dough into a thin ball."}
{"text":"This is a pretty big restaurant at Don Mills/York Mills.  I enjoyed the experience - even though I am not a huge fan of buffets.  To me it had a lot of the same foods as a Mandarin restaurant, but a step-up in quality.  Chinese noodles, vegetables, etc.  The food is quite tasty, and the Chinese food was quite authentic.  However, they have some additional items like Peking duck.  Also, each person gets a lobster ticket.  I don't really eat lobster, and neither did a lot of the people I was with, so we ended up with a lot of extra lobster tickets.  The only negative that I have is the price - it seems to keep going up and up.  I think it's either 26.99 or 28.99 on weekends.  Which qualifies this as being the most expensive buffet ever!  Especially in large groups, you tend to have some people who eat max. $10 worth of food.  It isn't really worth it, you could probably get table service at a nice restaurant and pay less.  Also, tea is extra - it is a glass teapot with a candle underneath to keep it warm.  Beautiful, but another cost.  I feel like at every restaurant in Toronto, I have to multiply the total by 1.3 for tax and tip!  In Belgium and France, it's all included so the amount you see on the menu is what you pay!  I prefer that so much more.  Some restaurants now expect 20%, so then it's like 1.33!  Well there was one guy I had lunch with who didn't know how to use the portable credit card reader.  So for our 25$ lunch, he typed in $30 for the tip, thinking it was the entire total.  That is over 100% tip.  I don't really know him that well, should I have told him?  Maybe some people tip more than 100%, I dunno."}
{"text":"It's a reasonably nice large chinese buffet restaurant with interesting furniture in a strip mall.  If that sounds appealing, you'll probably like it.  If it sounds terrible, you probably won't.  To me, this restaurant is very comparable to the Mandarin restaurants around the GTA, although I've been here with a couple of people who don't like the Mandarin and do like the Dragon Pearl.  The food is above average for a buffet without being spectacular. There are some relatively authentic chinese dishes and then some westernized chinese dishes and some western food (onion rings, etc), some soups, salads, desserts, fruits.   There's also some sushi, which is not the worst buffet sushi I've ever had, but it's still pretty substandard for sushi.  The station at the front of the restaurant that serves house-made noodles and bits of 'dragon pearl' is a nice touch, but it doesn't really change the overall feel of the place.  The price is reasonable for a buffet, if you're a healthy eater. If you're not a big eater, I would question the value of going to a buffet restaurant anyway, since you can probably get a better meal for less in smaller quantity elsewhere."}
{"text":"Last time I was here it was for Mother's day and the food is smazing! I think the layout and décor was beautiful and they give you tickets for lobsters. I think the food offering was great however, the missing item was crab legs which are offered at other buffet places such as the Mandarin. Overall, the service was great and everyone had a great time and enjoyed the food. The layout was nice but I find there is a bottleneck for the lobster line. Highly recommend, best buffet in the city!"}
{"text":"So I went here with my parents recently for lunch on a weekday ($12.99 per person).  We got there at 11:30am, so it was initially pretty empty which was great, but as time went on it got really busy and the way the buffet is set up (you can only access food from one side and it's one continuous line instead of several \"serving islands\") meant you had to wait a while to fill up your plate.  I've been to busier buffets, but because the layout there was better, there wasn't a long wait.  So definite minus points for layout.  However, the food was pretty good.  Better than Imperial, Starwalk and Mandarin.  Not as good as Wasabi Grand Buffet.  They had some dishes that I had not seen before at other Asian Buffets, like stir-fried ramen noodles - which were quite good actually, and stir-fried vermicelli noodles (but not Singapore Style) - which were also good.  They have a grilling section with really good grilled chicken, so tender and flavourful but not salty.  Stir-fired beef was also good and tender.  They also had large cold pre-peeled shrimp at the salad bar, and some shrimp stir-fries with sizable shrimp.  Unfortunately, their shrimp dumplings were not that good.  Too much filler, not enough shrimp.         Their dessert section is the largest I've seen at a buffet.  They had lots of different types of cake, jello, chocolate covered marshmallows, English Trifle, this unusual but good dessert made with bananas, strawberries, walnuts and raisins in a creamy sauce, ice cream and lots of others.  They had this fried twisty thing covered in honey that is common at Chinese Bakeries.  I don't know what it's called but it is delicious.  Then of course they have the \"Dragon Pearl\" which is a giant deep fried hollow ball.  The ball is huge and you only get a piece of it (one piece per person and they dole it out to you).  In my opinion the Dragon Pearl tasted awful.  It tasted like rancid oil and didn't smell much better.  I wanted to try it for the novelty but I instantly regretted the calories!  The giant ball does look impressive though.  You can buy the whole ball for $8.99 if you wanted.  They also make hand-pulled noodles right in front of you.  They taste like udon noodles.  Nice and chewy.      The service was excellent.  We had an older Asian man as our server and he was always smiling and so polite.  He filled our waters many times and was sure to ask us if we were enjoying everything.  He was quite possibly the nicest and most pleasant waiter I have ever seen at a buffet.    The decor is something else.  It is so gorgeous in there.  Lots of wood everywhere and most things that are not made of wood are red (like even the dinner plates are red).  They have a \"booth\" that looks like a birdcage.  I would love to eat in there sometime.  They also have some chairs where the back is so high (like easily over 7 feet high) - probably for emperors or something like that. Definitely prettier than any other Asian buffet I've been to.          Service was wonderful, decor very pretty, and food was overall good.  My only real complaint is the layout of the buffet.  I would not want to venture here on a weekend or during peak dining hours, as you could easily have to wait 15 minutes or more to line up and get your food."}
{"text":"This is a place with lots of variety - we went on a Thursday on the week of mother's day.  Free face changing show and food is fine.  We enjoyed the show and dinner altogether.  I like the decor and choices they offer. Worth to try!!"}
{"text":"Exec Summary: Asian-inspired buffet with excellent decor and average food, comparable to Mandarin.  First Impressions: \"wow, that's a big a-- jeen diuh!\" (jeen diuh = the crispy dumpling thing they call a Dragon Pearl)  Would I go back? If I'm in the area and looking for a buffet, ya.   Comparison:  Selection of entrees comparable to Mandarin and Buffet King. Buffet King has some better dishes though (more seafood). I think they have more desserts at Dragon Pearl than either competitor.  The long review:  Man, I must be getting old.  Once up a time, in a town not so far away, a skinny Asian boy was able to pound down plate after plate of food and desserts.    That was then, this is now. My metabolism no longer allows me to do this, and my stomach physically hurts after chowing down more than 3 plates of food.  As a result, even at buffets, I look for quality and quantity in more cases than naught, and even in buffets I can't turn a blind eye to the quality.  The food here was average, though they had a large selection.  I can't say anything was particularly \"good\", but everything was ok, I think the lower turn over on a Tuesday night might have contributed. Maybe it's better for lunch, I hear it's rammed so the dishes are likely fresher.  With a carving station (roast beef), grill station (kalbi ribs, chicken, fish, grilled bananas and sweet potatoes), sushi section (including salmon and white fish sashimi and rolls), and plenty of hot plates of Asian food (peking duck, your pseudo american-chinese chicken balls) including chinese and japanese inspired dishes, pizza, BBQ ribs, there's definitely a lot of selection here. I'd say more selection than Mandarin and Buffet King.    As for quality, the roast beef was a bit cold and slightly dry, but how many buffets outside of Nevada have good roast beef? The peking duck was mediocre and the bread that comes with it was too large, a bit thick and dry, but how many buffets have peking duck? The sushi selection was better than Mandarin and I think better than buffet king.  The BBQ ribs were actually quite good and along with their noodle station,  I'd say my favorite thing available.  The salmon was overcooked and dry.  I won't go on, but the quality was on par with Mandarin, but Buffet King has better entrees and better quality food.  The dessert station was large as well, with a good assortment of cakes, cookies, pies, waffles, ice cream, etc.  Quality of the desserts was on par with Mandarin.   All in all, it's not bad, and if you're closer to Dragon Pearl than Mandarin, it's not worth the extra drive to Mandarin."}
{"text":"Whoa, I've never reviewed this place? Crazy!  I've been here twice and both times, I quite enjoyed the food. It's definitely good for a buffet. Lots of selection. Highlights for me are peking duck, noodles in soup, Chinese tofu dessert soup thing (my FAVOURITE), prime rib and their sushi was better than most buffets.  Service is very good. Your plates are whisked away nearly the second you put your fork down. Water is filled constantly.   The place also looks great. It's dark and kind of feels like you're in a theme park of some sort. They clearly put a lot of thought into the decor.   This is my first choice for buffets now, and at $22 Mon-Thurs, it's not crazy expensive, either."}
{"text":"This place is... 2.5 stars on a good day. The deocrations are nice and there is tons of seating. However, it is a buffet but for some reason most of their food is not hot or fresh. I came here on a busy Saturday night twice and Im not sure if they are unable to keep up with demand or they just rush everything.  They have fresh noodles which was my favorite and you get a ticket for Lobster which was decent.  The rest of the food was alright but nothing special.  The service is fast, efficient, and pretty good actually.  Personally I would rather go to Mandarin because they have more selection but Im not a huge fan of buffets regardless."}
{"text":"I really like the store theme. The place is so stylish and pretty. The food is good and it's not so pricy. I had my birthday party here. They offered me a free meal!  Like it!"}
{"text":"Review on the Run:  Holy mother of dragon pearl!!  This place is ginormus (see the pictures)!  Opened up recently in November, I think Ariel G. summed it up real well with his review, so I don't have much more to add to it.  The decor is nice.  The food is okay.  Fairly typical for a AYCE Chinese buffet.  I was hoping for a bit more, maybe something a bit more unique.  I was there for lunch, so I'm not sure if it's different for dinner or not.  I was looking forward to a bit of taco duck (peking duck) but it wasn't available.  Dragon Peal is a welcomed addition to the neighbourhood along with the new ginormus Galleria Korean Supermarket next door.  I'll really have to come back for dinner to provide a full review (UYE anyone?).  Interesting tidbit: Dragon Pearl is actually a name for a dish (Deep fried Sesame ball) which is an additional cost to the Jimmy buffet.  Conclusion: Eat Here?  Sure."}
{"text":"I wasn't initially excited to come here, but the decor and atmosphere changed my perception. It's fairly expensive at $28 per person for adults, but the food is the best I've ever had at a buffet. I love sushi and this place has several rolls and sashimi. There is half a steamed lobster per person which was good. The Dragon Ball which is deep fried and crispy is $10.99 to purchase, it's more interesting to see than to actually eat it. They also have peking duck, roast beef, and a wonderful cake and ice cream selection. Would definitely come back again. They have one table where the back of the chair is about 10 feet tall. Let a parent or grand-parent to make them feel special. :)"}
{"text":"Dragon Pearl Beats all the AYCE buffet in almost every aspect.   Pros: Atmosphere, here is where it shines, as soon as you step in you'll realize that this isn't your typical AYCE in fact its hard to even imagine that this is a restaurant, the hospitality this place provides and that warmth is unparalleled.  Food: A+ Everything was top notch from appetizers, soups, entrée, sushi, desserts, peking duck, dim sum this place has it all!  Cons:  Price, as expected with fine quality dining there is a price premium.  This place is ALWAYS packed (I'm dead serious), I would recommend you book reservations in advance if you even want to have a chance :P    This place is a must go, worth the extra mile for those not in the area. The only way enjoy Dragon Pearl is not by reading this review but to experience it yourself. This one of the best if not the Best AYCE Buffets"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! Lots of variety. Loved the Peking duck and shashimi. My boyfriend and I were very impressed with the service as well. We will definitely go back. Highly recommend:)"}
{"text":"3 stars but still one of the better buffets out there!   Went again for the Lunar New Year weekend, haha. Had booked a table for 830pm and but was seated 15 minutes past our booking time...  Was expecting the Lobster coupon, but instead they had Fresh Oysters which is their \"Sunday Special\" (look at pics). I'm not sure if this replaces Lobster for Friday/Saturday as they used to have Lobsters for the weekend. I only managed to grab 3 before it was completely gone/they stopped serving it at like 920pm or something.  Something new: They had a Boiled Seafood as one of the buffet option! It came spicy and it had mussels, shrimps and couple of crab legs. I only grabbed the mussels and since it was a mixed seafood, I bit into a shell into my mussel meat... Was kind of turned off by that.  They also had a lady serving the Peking Duck this time, limiting 2 per person. She was generous with the duck per wrap though, so I don't mind :) ! But it did make the line really long :( !   They also ran out of the green \"Dragon Noodle\" at the noodle section. They just gave us the \"regular\" noodle instead, without even explaining they ran out of the Dragon Noodle...   Basically near the end of our meal there, half of the stuff wasn't available (like the Dragon Noodle + Fresh Oyster), which I felt kind of annoyed since I feel like they should be consistent with their servings.......... :( !"}
{"text":"I returned to the Dragon Pearl Buffet to celebrate Elaine K.'s birthday with a group of 30.  This place is definitely constructed for parties.  I think I saw at least 3 birthday parties simultaneously happening at the same time.  If you want to sit on the \"boat\" make sure your party has less than 22 people as that is the maximum capacity.  Unfortunately, Elaine K.'s popularity prevented us from fulfilling our pirate fantasies, lol.  The service levels have definitely gone downhill.  I returned many times to my table to find my dishes were still on the table.  One of our dining companions ended up doing a circus balancing act when his dishes started to pile up.  We were all placing bets on when his Jenga tower would topple over.    Now - on to the food.  I did get to try the Shou Lai Mian (hand pulled noodles) this time around.  There are 3 soup bases to choose from.  I opted for the Szechuan Beef - the only one with actual chunks of protein in it.  It was quite tasty - think udon noodles.  Things that showed up on my plate:  From the Salad Bar: Chickpea Salad Gherkin Pickles Seaweed Salad (not the Wakame variety) Corn \"Salad\" Cabbage Salad  Everything from the salad bar tasted the same.  Drenched in a sweet/sour vinaigrette of some sort.  The corn salad was horrible - stay away!  It was definitely canned corn, and there was zero flavour, and an even more awful texture!  Eek!  Proteins: Braised Tilapia - Quite tender and flavourful King Oyster Mushrooms - If you want an oyster-sauce high, this is the dish.  Just drenching! Salmon Teriyaki - Not tender and very dry.  Even the sauce couldn't save it Shrimp Dumplings - Quite good, though the dumpling wrapper could stand to be a bit thinner Peking Duck - They ran out of wraps when I was there, so I just escaped with the bird part.  Flavourless and the skin was not crispy Yam Potato Cakes - A gelatinous, round, orange disc that was quite delicious Grilled Pineapple - Can't really screw this one up! Egg Tofu w/ Black Bean Sauce & Minced Pork - Egg tofu is extremely smooth, in one word - tasty!  Sushi Bar - I would avoid this station altogether as their sushi tasted rather \"stale\" to me.  The lack in skill shows as the sushi falls apart.  The sashimi items (tuna and salmon) are not the freshest.  Save your stomach for the dessert bar instead.  The dessert bar is huge.  Bread pudding, cheesecake, nanaimo bars, creme brulee, tofu fa (silken tofu w/ maple syrup), jello, various fruits, ice cream cake, green tea mousse cake, rice pudding, sugar puffs, chocolate dipped strawberries, fruit tarts... the list goes on and on and on.  This would be a dieters ultimate nightmare!  But for a sweets lover like me I was in heaven.  They have this weird rule for big groups that once 30 minutes have elapsed you must settle your bill.  Tacky!  One of the 2 tables that our group occupied was also not provided hot hand towels at the end of the evening.  Weekday dinner price of $20.99 + tax.  Weekends are more, as is the norm with buffets (although on the weekends you get a lobster ticket for half a loster).  I think I have just outgrown the AYCE days."}
{"text":"Lovely interior and decor. Great for family and friends gatherings. Higher quality than most Chinese buffet but I'm not entirely sold on the price though. On point were their roast beef, grilled oysters and Peking ducks. Not as much options as most other Chinese buffets like star walk but what they did, they did well. Notable that the quality was present. But i would not return strictly because of prices. Otherwise, a definite worthwhile place to check out"}
{"text":"Nice and beautiful place, decoration is amazing and well designed, food is superb! Even though there are a lot of Asian buffet in Toronto, this one has the most authentic Chinese food and the best design."}
{"text":"One of the better Chinese buffets in Scarborough. I went on a Tuesday and the price was $22 per person; Peking duck was served in addition to other food in the pictures i've posted. It was my first time here and i enjoyed it. No complains about anything. Would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"If someone in my family says the word \"buffet\" there is only one place in my mind and it's Dragon Pearl. I honestly have only one food on my mind when someone says buffet too ever since I've been to Dragon pearl and that is Peking duck.   I eat my money's worth of Peking duck every time. EVERY TIME.  The other food here is quite good too. I enjoy the sesame chicken and the fish too. I also live for the tofu pudding dessert. However, since I can get that at zen q, I don't worry about that too much.  The greeters are nice and the wait staff are a delight even when it gets busy. My mom disagrees with me but I think they got rid of the person who served us 2 yrs ago. I also think they got rid of the person who answered the phone 2 yrs ago too. (\"No, if you don't take 715pm you can go somewhere else\")   They cleared our plates in a timely manner and the foods that depleted were refilled as soon as possible. My parents drink tea so they got super pissed that the tea cups are tiny tiny hahaha I found it cute. I mean I don't remember but if it's unlimited hot water refill, I don't think tiny cups are so bad, right?  If you want a large reservation for an event, I'd suggest calling at least a week in advance for the time slot you'd like."}
{"text":"The food here looks delicious but in actuality tastes pretty bland.  The restaurant is beautifully decorated and set up. I had higher expectations for a restaurant that would spend so much on the décor, but they honestly failed to fully deliver. At most you can choose 2 items and that's about it! The food was on the sweet side...and I'm not talking about the desert! Better save your calories for something that is worth it!"}
{"text":"Tried it three times this week. All dinners. They always bring the bill before you are done. They interrupt your dinner to pay asap!!! They bring the hot towels as soon as you sit with a dessert. I tell them I'm not done and you need to bring it later. They ignore you. It's those cheap microwave towelettes that get cold in a minute. The third trip three different waiters brought fortune cookies and towelettes to push us out. We take under an hour to eat as a couple. Reasonable at a buffet, no? For $65 a couple without drinks they could be less pushy, less out the revolving door. Never going back. Three strikes. They are out!!!!!"}
{"text":"I've wanted to come here for a long time, but maybe I waited too long. Seems like its gone down hill after the rave reviews after it first opened.   The food is mediocre. It was a mish mash of Chinese staples, and more Western food like Yorkshire Pudding and Caesar Salad. The various Chinese dishes like fried noodles, grilled beef, veggies etc, is actually (and perhaps cheaper) at congee wong or something. They did have sashimi and sushi, as well as a noodle station with long pulled noodles with custom made soup.   Not a lot of veggie options, only a handful of dishes. Be sure to also check out the soup area, found a nice traiditonal Chinese soup amongst the clam chowder and cream of [whatever].   What I did love, was the decor. It is very extravagant, and interesting facts about the petrified wood used. I belive you're meant to feel like you were on a boat, and with high ceilings, it was a very comfortable dining experience. I thought it was weird their choice of music. At one point I heard rap/pop, then suddenly Beethoven. Then nothing for the rest of the night.  There is a giant screen at the back showcasing some visuals of ancient chinese actors, would have been nice to hear the audio for it too.   The service was hit or miss. My water was never empty, and plate was always clear. I appreciated that, but when I asked them questions, I would get rude dismissive answers. It was a little better when asked in chinese, but shouldn't make a difference.   We ordered a custom made giant dragon pearl (website says $10.99, but they charged us $12.95). This was no where on their menu, and Ionly knew about it thru their website. I don't know why the price difference, and when we asked the server, he was rude and assured us it was $12.95. I didn't want to argure over $3.   It says that it's made in front of you. It's not, it's at the buffet area, and you are free to go over there and look. I wish he had told us when it was started to be made, so we can watch how this giant hallow ball was formed. It wasn't until we ordered it (they say said 15 mins before we want it), he said they were already making it.   Watching this thing being made was pretty cool, but the ball was already in it's adult stage when we got there. She fries it in oil until it is golden and it continuously grows. Kind of cool.   It was brought to our table, and we got it because I thought it would be special. We are celebrating. It's really just deep fried dough and it's really really greasy. I really didn't think it was wroth it, and we couldn't even finish it. That wasn't the worst part.   As we were eating it, there was a giant clump of custard looking thing attached to the bottom of the ball. At first I thought it was a surprise cream puff or something, but as I poked at it, and tried to remove it, it was stuck there, and I pulled out a piece of meat!! So confused, a little disgusted, we asked the server what this was. He  just said, don't eat it, you cannot eat that, which didn't give me a lot of confidence in the matter. It was kind of gross just staring at us.   Eventually, I went to the lady that was making it in the first place and spoke to her in Chinese.  She says that it's just a chicken ball and its used to make the ball. The hallow ball can't be made out of nothing, and needs something to give it shape. Traditionally, it was a glutinuous rice ball or some sort, but instead of that they just use a deep friend chicken ball to kick start the process. She says it's edible, but don't eat it, it won't taste good. I don't know what to make of this, but it's an explanation.   Overall, it's like any other chinese buffet. Free for birthday persons for the entire birthday month, if you bring at least 5 friends. Seniors get 50% off. But really it's most worth it to come for weekend lunch they serve lobster and things. And don't get this Dragon Pearl ball, waste of money."}
{"text":"One of the better buffet in town. Large space with very Chinese-themed decor. The first thing you see as you walk in is the 12 zodiac and you can pick up a little card with the description of your zodiac   They were very busy but because of the enormous space we got seated right away. I find the food were as authentic and fresh as a buffet can get. One comes here to get taste of everything. The service was okay. It's a buffet so one doesn't usually pay attention to this sort of things lol.   I like that they have the hand made noodle in house, tried it with the chicken broth so I can taste the pure noodles. Their pecking duck was also pretty good except the sauce was a bit on the thin side."}
{"text":"Dragon Pearl  My quick tips: -Great for groups, and for more of a \"dining\" type Chinese buffet experience.  -Food-wise not the best in its class but still decent; and you can't beat the décor or service (again, versus its competitors that I know of) -If going with a group, you can ask for separate bills, they are happy to accommodate and are quick. -At lunchtime, go early, it gets very crowded by noon.  ***note: sorry, this is my first review, I should have maybe read the others' before writing this so I apologize in advance for repetition on some items.  Ok, here are my thoughts: Some background - hadn't visited the website or heard any feedback when I first entered this restaurant. Needless to say I was both surprised and impressed by the magnificent décor. I am not aware of any other Chinese buffet (let alone an authentic one) with any noteworthy décor. I feel this is the restaurant's selling point, over its food so please note I've written more about this than the food itself.  All dark wood, dark (ambient?) lighting. Interesting heavy heavy carved furniture. Seating options for larger groups include long medieval-feeling tables with end chairs looking like throne chairs - super tall backs (fun to hang your jacket on the back and have it high above you); or large oval communal-style dining, all chairs with tall chairback. Medium-sized groups can sit in bench booths, or much more fun - you can sit in a wooden boat, surrounded by blue tiles emulating water. 2-4 parties can sit at round tables (with folding leaves to accommodate more plates and table clutter) or smaller two-seater tables. All seats provide great views of the magnificent dining room. I should note there is a smaller, more modern and bright room as well but the two times I came to this restaurant they were not in use.  Other noteworthy décor notes:  -there are giant red ornate chandeliers everywhere, bringing together kitsch, recent chandelier trends, but also the Asian love of red.  -bronze heads of all the Chinese astrological signs great you upon entry. -strangely, there are glass cabinets displaying jewellery for sale in multiple locations. -upon entry, you will see large (volleyball-sized) round flour-based and deep-fried balls. These presumably are symbolic for the dragon \"pearl\". It's pretty fascinating to watch staff creating these marvellous wonder in a wok covered in glass for protection from sputtering oil. There are also pieces of broken up balls you can sample on that same counter. They taste like oily sweet cracker chips.  On to the food!  The only contenders I am aware of in similar category are China Buffet King and Starwalk. I won't even count Mandarin (yuck) or anything similar. For me, Both CBK and Starwalk have far superior variety generally speaking. Like its peers, Dragon Pearl has sections for cold salad appetizers, soups, bbq, hot foods, fried foods, dessert, waffle, ice cream. I feel these are similar to peers, but not as good.   A noteworthy station however is the small easy-to-miss noodle station located by the edible \"pearls\". These are hand-pulled noodles. They are similar to Udon but less chewy. You can choose a broth of either chicken broth, szechuan beef, or chicken something else (a thicker and more flavourful version of the basic chicken broth. These can be topped with green onions and coriander. I've tried the latter two, both excellent. Both times I asked for ridiculous amounts of coriander (I'm an addict) which may have been why I loved these so much but the flavours and textures really were fantastic.  Tea also set this place apart. I ordered Iron Goddess Tea and it was served in a clear glass teapot atop a tea warmer (tealight candle inside). Very much enjoyed having warm tea for the entire meal, and as a plus was fairly good quality tea as well! Far superior over the low-quality versions of Jasmine or Oolong served by its peers.  I wasn't tired after my meal which I usually am after Chinese buffet. Perhaps less/no MSG?   The meal was polished off with our server bringing us hot towels to wash our hands, and a pile fortune cookies, nice way to end a meal."}
{"text":"Decisions, decisions, decisions...   Dragon pearl is the type of restaurant that makes me wish I had three stomachs because I truly wanted to taste everything on the buffet. However they do have a large selection so tasting everything was not going to be an option. Some friends and I settled on this place to celebrate my birthday, I chose this place because I had heard about the great selection as well as the fact that they offer Peking duck and lobster (each person gets 1 ticket for a lobster). The Peking duck is available for dinner every night however the half lobster is only available for weekend dinners. Here is how my experience went:   The Good - Sashimi was very fresh and cut in nice slices, a pleasant surprise - Peking duck had a nice flavour, was fairly moist but the skin was not crispy enough - Spicy and salty shrimp had a nice kick to it, was lightly breaded and not oily at all  - Hand stretched noodles were quite nice and tender, beef broth had rich beef flavour with just a little kick - Stir fried mushroom with chicken dish had a few varieties of mushrooms, chicken was nice and tender and the sauce not too sweet. I am a sucker for mushrooms and absolutely loved this dish - BBQ pork was quite good, very tender.   The OK - All the Americanized Chinese food dishes were pretty standard, nothing to write home about - The Half lobster was a generous portion, it even included the claw!  It was simply steamed and tasted quite fresh.  - The dessert table was pretty standard also, very similar to one you might find at the mandarin (a little better than the mandarin because they did have crème brule, which was better than I expected it to be)  The Bad - Clams in black bean sauce had an off flavour, probably my least favourite dish of the night - Maki rolls were very small and didn't taste great, they only had a few selections of pretty standard rolls - Pork ribs were too sweet and also had a weird flavour  This place is definitely a step up from the mandarin as I found the food quality to be better and the selection to be more authentic. The décor was absolutely gorgeous, especially the boat shaped tables. The service was standard for a buffet, and they did have a cool looking cocktail menu, but I did not indulge. For a weekend dinner was about $26 per person plus tax, for the amount of food they have it was well worth it. This was a great place for a big group as everybody was able to get something that they liked. This is definitely my go-to Chinese buffet from now on!"}
{"text":"I rarely frequent buffets because I find I get full too quickly...but this one is definitely one of the better ones. I had two plates of food and a few desserts. The prime rib, sausages (same as they have at Korean Grill House) and Peking duck were my faves. I broke my diet just to eat the duck with the wrap. I only had 3 of those and regret wasting precious stomach space on anything else. The skin of the duck was so crispy & delicious. The prime rib was medium-rare, just the way I like it. I threw in a couple of other random items on my plates, but nothing worth mentioning. There was no more creme brulee when it came time for dessert. I ate the sugar free cheesecake, flan, tiramisu, mango and vanilla ice cream. Nothing spectacular, but it satisfied my sweet tooth. The servers were attentive when it came to collecting plates and refilling our waters. They were also really friendly, which I always appreciate. I gave this place 3 stars because the food was good but only with a few standout items - also, because the bathrooms were disgusting. There was only one decent stall to use out of 5 or 6. Not sure how often they are cleaned, but they should make a better habit of checking on them. Dinner on the weeknights is 26.99 for adults. It seems like a fair price, but in my case, I probably won't eat at this type of buffet again, simply because I never eat my money's worth."}
{"text":"Each person gets a ticket for a lobster, and you can ask for the claw that comes with the tail, or else you are missing out on more lobster.  They also have oysters, beef, sashimi, expensive high end Chinese buffet items.  No point in buying the \"Dragon Pearl\" ball because they have samples constantly laid out by the spot they make the pearl, so why pay another $10 when you are already paying close to $40 after tip/tax.  Lots of dessert options.  Design here is a star. Very cool boat and red/black theme. I would come back for occasions where a higher end 'buffet' is needed."}
{"text":"I've been to this place plenty of times, and although it has been many years, i have to say that their quality has not decreased over the years. This is one of those buffets that not only offers many choices, but the food is actually a la carte restaurant quality.   The first time you will notice about this restaurant is that the decor is very unique, but it is for sure a very interesting design that pleases many people and will make the dinner more enjoyable. it is spacious, and the servers are generally relatively attentive to your needs.   The food is where this place really makes the difference, it is an Asian Buffet, which means that it will contain many famous dishes from many asian cusines, all the way from sushi and sashimi, to sesame chicken, peking duck. pad thai and dim sum are all different varieties. as well they also have western cooking such as roast beef and prime ribs. This Buffet restaurant really does most of their dishes very well. and as well having plenty of choices, the quality is Maintained throughout. Although this buffet is along the same price range as a Mandarin, it is by far better, and more authentic. Many of the dishes in my photograph were very well done, and great.   This Buffet also has plenty of choices when it comes to desert, such as waffle ice cream and plenty of cakes and fruits to choose from.   After a while, even tough over the years it has increased its prices a lot. This Buffet is definitely one of the better ones in toronto. and i would recommend people bringing family and any occasion to this Buffet."}
{"text":"my parents really like this buffet.  its actually pretty decent.  the decor and unique and equisite and adds to the atmosphere.    theres a strangeness to it it makes you feel like your on vacation or something.  hard to explain.  the food and variety is good.  and lobster, well how can you complain.  all.in all hapoy experience everytime ive been there.  my only complaint would be theres this stupid rule about ordering tea and not being able to get more than one glass to share with the table.  like what the fcuk is that? to me thats just cheap and how much tea can one family drink anyway, isnt the idea to fill up on food, why would they worry about people taking advantage of tea.  lol."}
{"text":"Best Chinese buffet in toronto.  Food is good. Atmosphere is great. Prices are great. AND they have Peking duck! What more would u expect!"}
{"text":"Beware the food coma that will ensue afterwards... I had a really enjoyable experience here!  I'm usually hating on buffets due to the \"lower quality\" foods that you would expect at the every person Chinese buffet, but I was quite surprised at the quality of sushi, meats, and everything else at this fine buffet establishment.  The decor... was interesting.. I didn't realize it at first, but this place is HUGE.. great for private functions and such.  It had somewhat of a Las Vegas vibe in there.  The highlight was the lobster (where they hand out vouchers - otherwise some d*bag would snap all the lobsters up), which was quite delicious given that they were made en masse.  While around $30 a head,  you'll definitely get your money's worth - food coma and all."}

{"text":"I absolutely loved this place. It was so refreshing and unique it it's own way from its restaurant theme to display art.

I recommend this location to anyone looking for a good buffet especially with big families for big family gatherings."}

{"text":"We just ordered delivery from Dragon Pearl, our first time eating from there. The results were mixed. See below.  (One note: The menu we had was dated June 2011, and yet when we ordered two years later, the prices were the same. Still expensive in my eyes, but yeah, it's good when prices stay steady.)  Vegetable Spring Rolls ($1.25 each) -- very tasty, well seasoned, very well filled. They didn't fall apart like some places, and weren't too greasy.  Shrimp Spring Rolls ($1.75 each) -- quite tasty, very flavourful. Good chunks of shrimp -- they weren't stingy on that.  Lobster Spring Rolls ($5.55 for 2 pieces) -- we were not that impressed. Would not get again.  Steamed rice ($1.35 each) -- it was steamed rice. What more is there to say? Uhhh... the portion was good?  General Tao Chicken ($8.75) -- very tasty. Some of the best GTC we've had. Large, well divided chunks of white meat chicken in a nice sauce.  Black Pepper Beef ($9.25) -- unlike the chicken dish above, this was some beef and a lot of mixed vegetables. Not as much meat, but pretty good taste. Nothing mind blowing, and not spicy despite having a \"spicy\" symbol. For the price and the fact you don't get THAT much beef, would not get again.  Chicken and Shrimp Pad Thai ($11.75) -- wow that was disappointing. Not just was it the most expensive thing we ordered, but it was so bland. The chicken AND the shrimp lacked in taste, and the pad thai noodles were quite ordinary. It was a large quantity, but none of us wanted much of it.  What else to note?  - There were no errors with our order - No delivery charge - It took like 55 minutes, which seems long considering they are under 3km away, but it still fell within the time quoted of 45-60 minutes.  The price is competitive with similar places, but is still too expensive (in my opinion), unless you order their pre-selected combo plates. With tax/tip, it came to $56, and it was only for 3 people -- there's enough leftovers for 1 more full plate, so it works out to $14 per person.  Overall, I found it a mixed bag -- some really good dishes, some that didn't set themselves apart from other places, and some that were disappointing. Not sure if we'll be back, because some other places have dishes we have been WOWED by, and nothing did that here."}
{"text":"We went here for Saturday dinner. It was extremely packed. We all received one voucher for lobster which was nice. Overall, the food was good. We did however notice that the staff could not keep up with the demand. Crab legs, chicken wings and pizza were among the ones that were always empty and once they did bring them out, people attacked them. The Peking duck was delicious and one of my fave dishes. Service was lacking, most likely due to the high volume of people. In comparison with Mandarin, dragon pearl did not offer better desert options, they are also not as clean as Mandarin (buffet tables and utensils were quite dirty). Prices, however were similar. I would return to give this place another chance."}
{"text":"It's too bad since I had super high hopes of finding another Asian buffet apart from Mandarin.  One word \"SALTY\".  If you are looking for a buffet, I would not recommend this place.  Food: 2/5, The variety is there.  A lot of Chinese style food with a large sushi section.  The dragon noodle bar was also a great touch with a good soup section.  The dessert option was not too bad but here are the negatives or where they fail.  The lobster gimmick over the crab-legs, the watery ice cream and overall, the food was waaaaaaaay too salty where I was thirty even the next day.    Service: 1/5, for a buffet, the waiters are not trained well.  Firstly, they have stink face and rarely take the empty plates away.  The seating is maximized for capacity rather than comfort so it's hard for the service to be provided. The hot towels are in this plastic wrap so it's too hot to rip it and after you do, it becomes instantly lukewarm to cold.   Ambience: 2/5, I will give it that the decor is fancied-up but they made a mistake by having heavy tables and even heavier chairs that are 1cm away from each other.  It's near impossible to get out of your seat without interrupting someone next to you or the table behind you.  The decor however is really cool and interesting.  Price: 1/5, It comes to about $40 per person.  I really don't think that is worth it and it was a birthday dinner and they couldn't figure out to split the bill.    Nothing was extraordinary and I would recommend Mandarin that has much better service (food taken often, smiling waiters/waitresses, and just a better ambience with lighting and fresher looking food.)"}
{"text":"Madness, I tell you!!  This place is HUGE, and the decor is well...FUNKY. It's just odd; nothing really makes sense, and you can actually buy jewelry and home decor pieces there too. I was intrigued. :)  We came here with two of our friends on NYE 2013, and had a 45 minute wait. Considering their reservation system was completely booked up, the wait time wasn't horrendous. Contrary to what we thought, our two friends thought the wait was painful. :) We later found out that they typically don't wait more than 15 minutes for any restaurant. So, if you are a person who despises waiting, make a reservation, or come during off hours.  Once we got our table, I took a quick stroll around to see what they offered. Adult dinner buffet was $23/head, and you get half a lobster tail. I thought it was a pretty good deal. The layout is kind of wonky, and though the floorplan allows for plenty of goods, there wasn't as much as I thought there would be. Most choices were your typical Asian Chinese buffet (fried rice, noodles, vegetables, beef, chicken, pork, some dim sum). The execution was pretty good, but a little heavy handed on the oil. Flavors were solid though.  The one thing that probably irks me the most, and this is pretty common across a lot of buffets, but the hygiene around the stations was disturbing to me. Handles were greasy, sticky, and no towels wrapped around each handle to prevent spreading of germs. Now before you go thinking that I'm a germaphobe, these things are basic in any restaurant, but especially when you're at a buffet. No covers, nothing. *shutters*  In any case, at least we didn't get sick, and the food was okay. Nothing outstanding though. I suppose that if you're just looking for sheer volume and variety, Dragon Pearl is the place for you, but I'd probably not come back due to the cleanliness. Thankfully, we had great company, and that's all that really matters. :)"}
{"text":"We came to this location on a weekday for dinner service.  I've been to many ayce and was frankly disappointed with Dragon Pearl after reading many positive reviews. In general stir fry dishes were average, nothing special. Ditto for the sushi and sashimi. Perking duck was ok. On the desert table several items had a 'skin' on them from being out too long   On the plus side the noodle soups were all delicious. Freshly made tender noodle, savoury broths and nice toppings.   Service good, establishment average for cleanliness.  For the high weekday diner price i expected much better.   1 1/2 stars."}
{"text":"Well after a number of additional visits, I am sadly taking off a star. This place is quickly becoming a very plain Chinese AYCE joint. Sure it is very beautiful and offers 1/2 a small lobster on weekends .  This last weekend the sashimi available was very skimpy, the sushimi a lot more limited in variety than in their few weeks, and the general feeling and offering just so-so.  Its a shame....this can almost be a destination restaurant based on just its aesthetics. But it is crowded............."}
{"text":"Service was good, staff was friendly - disappointed in the actual food, not a lot of flavour"}
{"text":"I have had dinner buffet many times here and the food quality and selection is decent based on the price. They do Birthday specials here (free for the birthday person if there are 4 more guests?). I recently held a baby shower lunch here and was disappointed about the service. We made a reservation for 1:45pm so we would not be rushed since there are 2 seating (11:30am and 1:45pm). First of all the room was supposed to accommodate up to 25 people. Instead, they used one of the tables outside the room. The manager also said we could stay until 4pm but all of the servers rushed us to get out. I understand the buffet stops at 3:30pm but they could let us just chat at the tables. In the end I found out why because everyone was taking their afternoon naps in between the lunch and dinner service. Anyways, it was horrible and I felt bad for my guests. Never would I book a party here again. However, it is ok if you are coming with a few family and friends."}
{"text":"My 4th time coming to this restaurant but my first time coming here for Sunday lunch. The food tasted stale, and reheated. The mashed potatoes were runny almost like a creamy soup. Even the fresh baked mini croissants were hard and oily. I'm a bit disappointed that my rave reviews of this place during dinner is quite the opposite during lunch."}
{"text":"One of the best Asian restaurants I have been too. The place is gorgeous and the food quality is phenomenal.  A definite \"MUST TRY\""}
{"text":"I love this place. The decor, food, and service were very good. My family and I went to Dragon Pearl for dinner. I loved the selection of food, drinks and desserts. They had sushi and all kind of nice stuff. Would definitely go back here. Many buffet places look a bit basic and boring. The inside of this place is artistic and edgy. Can't wait to go again. It's VERY popular so make sure to get there a bit early  :)"}
{"text":"I went here for Mother's Day dinner with my boyfriend's family and I was very much so impressed. Especially, because in March I had went to Mandarin so it was easy to compare. As much as Mandarin was great that night, I'd have to say I enjoy Dragon's Pearl's buffet a bit more. I really enjoyed the sushi station.  I also am a huge fan of the atmosphere. They had little bookmarks you could take in the lobby area for each year representing Chinese Astrology. Seeing as I'm into Astrology, I was fascinated. I also very much love the red walls and lighting. It was huge! The food was fresh and so tasty! It's the same price as Mandarin from what I recall so if you are in the area, I strongly recommend giving this place a go! :)"}
{"text":"All you can eat Peking duck and oysters on Sundays. Plus sushi and fresh noodles and dim sum. It's one of the better places to go for all you can eat Asian food.  I can't stand places that serve shit food masquerading as Chinese  like sweet and sour chicken balls. That is gross. This place is decent"}
{"text":"Great decor, large space and amazing seating for large parties. Half lobster tail comes with every meal... but the rest of the buffet has great items including: prime rib, Peking duck, sushi and traditional Chinese buffet fare. Desserts need to be improved. But you will leave feeling like you gorged on food."}
{"text":"We tried coming here on a Thursday night before a long weekend and was told it would be an hour before we would get a table for 3. Decided to return the next night with a reservation. So worth the wait!! Hands down the best buffet we've been to! Food was fresh and flavourful. It was restocked frequently.  Sushi and sashimi was top notch. Shrimp and crab were cooked perfectly.The made-to-order soup with fresh made in house noodles was amazing! Service was ok for drinks but empty plates were picked up promptly. Overall, left feeling totally stuffed and satisfied.  Worth the extra cost."}
{"text":"Upon entry, decor is impressive & elaborate, not a cent was spared for creating an interesting interior.  The hostess asked us if we have been here before, we havent & I was surprised that she actually gave us a tour of the place.  Buffet selection is not as extensive as a Mandarin, but the items were of high quality.    Things I recommend: Shrimp Dumpling:  Restaurant grade for dim sum.  Beef Brisket - cooked to perfection.  Salmon Teriyaki - Inconsistencies present,  cooked to perfection while others were overcooked.  Select your piece carefully but otherwise it  was quite flavorful with a small amount of sweetness.  Grilled Calamari - Carmalized & not too chewy!  Pan-Fried Dumplings -A touch oily, but the dumpling wrapper was good with savory filling.  Mussels in Black Bean Sauce - Mussels in super savory & rich sauce.  Fish Fillet in Thai Sauce - Juicy on the inside & loaded with flavor.   The service is optimal.  Plates taken away whenever we left the table, water glasses were never empty, & napkins replenished. Random note, the cups they provide for tea is double insulated , thus cool to the touch.    When done eating, hot towel is present for you to wipe yourself & you get a great tasting fortune cookie that is made in Chicago.  I would advise, when craving Chinese buffet, to go to Dragon Pearl as prices are similar to Mandarin while the food is superior."}
{"text":"so may greasy food there. couldn't have much than i expect!    sesame chicken, black pepper beef, shrimp cheese cake, pineapple, chocolate ice cream were nice."}
{"text":"Definitely a nice place for a celebration with big groups and small. Many interesting choices for seating; high back royal chairs, a round table that looks like it's enclosed in a birdcage and even an elaborate dragon boat.  I'm glad I had a friend, whom I trusted, who could point me to decent food choices. The good thing about ayce buffets is the variety and amount of food you can consume. The bad thing is quality and taste are often compromised, don't expect gourmet food here.  Service was efficient and friendly; they even did us a favor and took multiple pictures of our large party."}
{"text":"2.8/5  I been here many times. Sorely it's because of their gorgeous decor and location. They have better food than mandarin for sure but their lack in variety of the menu and overdose of MSG is making me hesitate to going back there. I'll probably go back here for dinner when my mother want to eat out (it's her go to place..) but probably won't go back soon.."}
{"text":"We came here on a weekday lunch during a school break and were fairly surprised to see it rather empty.  Food seemed rather bland and just constantly missed the mark.  The highlight were the noodles, but those too were pretty plain.  There seemed to be quite a variety of food, but the actual quality of all the food is disappointing to say.    Their rolls were falling apart and poorly made and the food just didn't seem that fresh.  Service was rather lacking and their staff didn't seem too quick to refill food.  Decor was nice although we all found it fairly weird/amusing that there was jewelry being sold in display cases outside the eating area..."}
{"text":"I usually do not like buffets.  I think once a year is enough for me.  Stuffing your self with food that is mass produced, not my usual cup of tea.. I am sure most of you can relate.    Gotta say though, Dragon Pearl buffet is decent for that yearly one time allotment for buffets for someone like myself.    Your usual myriad of food items are all there, including some that are not available elsewhere.  There's all you can eat Peking Duck, while cooked adequately - it's best enjoyed right away as they bring it out from the kitchen. Letting it sit under the heat lamps will result in the duck meat being dry and chewy!   They also do lobsters in the evenings on weekends.  But, to control people from hoarding it all, every one gets a ticket that is unofficially transferable for one whole lobster for you to enjoy.  If someone in your party doesn't want theirs, you can definitely ask them to give it to you, much to the chagrin of the buffet staff.   My favourite items from my solo visit for a birthday definitely has to be the Peking Duck, the lobster, the spicy fried shrimps and roast beef.   The dessert selections were not bad either.  The pricing ($29.99 on weekends) does reflect the higher quality than at most other buffets. Dragon Pearl is on par with Mandarin I would say.    Service was impeccable too, making sure our plates were cleared promptly without us having to flag someone down. Likewise, our waters were always filled up.  Staff serves you with a smile and cheery attitude, rarely seen at most Asian restaurants.  I'm not in a hurry to return, but I wouldn't hesitate if I had to for a special occassion."}
{"text":"The interior is nice and different from other Chinese restaurants.  This was our first visit and I had higher expectations for the price and considering the restaurant location I was disappointed.   The food is plain. Nothing really stands out.  The service was poor. Our server was a bit rude and we only saw him when we were ready to pay. The guy came to take our order for drinks and we only saw him when we paid the bill. He stood over us until we paid. I didn't like that considering the bill was only $26.00.   I would not recommend this place if you are looking for good Chinese food. There are a lot of better places."}
{"text":"there is nothing too special about the food - typical, but i find it to be better than the mandarin.  some of the selections are the same, but it does have lots of food that you might not find at the mandarin.  Nothing i ate was out of this world good.  the decor is interesting..but bordering on cheesy.  but the price is decent - i think its $$11.99 or 12.99 for lunch (not on weekends/holidays).  since its not too far from me i will come back if i get the urge for a \"chinese\" buffet"}
{"text":"The interior of Dragon Pearl cannot be compared to any other buffet place in Toronto.  Absolutely stunning.  Reminded me of a couple fancy places in Las Vegas.  That's really the only significant difference between DP and any other buffet.  It's pretty much \"white food\" which may be good for its location.  Personally, it fell short.  It was tasty but not very Asian.  Lots of grilled, fried, and cold foods were available.  It's hard to say if I will ever go back.  Maybe for a quick lunch with co-workers (to show them the interior)."}
{"text":"Best buffet in town.  In addition to the usual buffet food they have, Peking duck Seafood boil on weekends Lobster tail   Great place to do a work or family get together.   Try their dragon noodle if you can handle spicy :)"}
{"text":"Hi  I have been over 25 AYCE restaurants in GTA and this is a great place to dine you with proper service if you do not care too much about food.  Lunch menu  Sushi is fresh , too much rice  Dim Sum has variety but not very traditional  Hot food is average Hand roll are good but still too much rice Rainbow Roll has good balance between ingredient and rice.   The server are quick and polite by comparing to a lot of AYCE restaurant.   Sushi Hour would be a better choice if you prefer eating sashimi   Washroom are average. (Good privacy )"}
{"text":"I went here with my friend a couple of months ago. Don't worry - the memory is still fresh in my mind. It is quite large with a really strange decor. There is a HUGE boat in the middle of the dinning room area and it made me somewhat upset that I was not allowed to climb and/or sit in it.  The \"pearl\" is this huge, fluffy shell of pastry if anyone is wonder. They advertise it like it's the greatest thing known to man, but really it's just a crispy shell. that looks like a pearl. Nothing special about that one!  As far as buffets go, this one was just that - A-OK. I didn't find any special foods. I really liked the Peking duck lettuce wraps, they had all kinds of things you could add to the wrap and it was mega delicious! I also really liked the fish balls, they're on a long skewer king of buried in a broth right beside the sushi table. I would like to point out that this is one of the only AYCE places I have encountered smoked salmon! Good stuff.   Overall, it's just like Mandarin. If you have a Mandarin nearby AND crab legs are happenin' - go there! There was nothing special about Dragon Pearl Buffet but the food was tasty nonetheless!"}
{"text":"Heard so many great reviews about this place but unfortunately did not live up to its hype. Food was bland and the lobster was over cooked. Enjoyed the atmosphere but that was pretty much it . The dessert selection was sub par to Mandarin. Overall would not go back."}
{"text":"We live in the area and have been to this location for both dinner and lunch.   The location is nice and the decor is beautiful. It gets quite busy at dinner time and much much slower during lunch service.   The dinner has always been good. Hot food and great service. The prices are similar to those at Mandarin. The lunch service on the other hand was terrible. As we were at the buffet selecting items we saw them microwaving food behind the grill and then bringing it out and putting it at the buffet! I mean I'm sure other buffets may use a microwave but I'm sure it's done in the back and not in plane sight for the customers to see!   I prefer the sister location dragon legend over this place. However neither buffets are that impressive  IMO."}
{"text":"My first time at a Dragon Pearl buffet. They had a huge selection of food from over the world and all tasted very good! My favourite was the deep fried oysters (make sure you choose ones with just a little batter). Unfortunately I didn't get to try their signature dragon pearl dessert...  Friends told me that the Markham location had cold crab and frog legs, so I was looking forward to it at this location... they didn't have it!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese buffet around. Forget Mandarin and imperial. This place has it all. Lobster and peking duck on weekends. Huge variety of food that all tastes amazing. Very nice ambiance and design. Forget about the rest. I came here for one party and the next day had a family thing at Mandarin. I felt like spitting out half of the food i ate at Mandarin."}
{"text":"We used to really like this place but their prices went up while their quality went down. It's a stretch to give them 3 stars now."}
{"text":"Bit above standard buffet choices. Had some stuff normal Chinese buffets don't have. It was worth a try, but don't except it to be great."}
{"text":"A decent Chinese buffet - what??  I've been here a handful of times (oh glutinous me), and have not been disappointed.  The flavour is actually there and the variety is a fair amount to satisfy even the pickiest of eaters.  Once you walk into the restaurant, there is one side where there are seats on two dragon boats - super cool for the novelty to take pictures in. On the other is a large screen of someone cooking (do they want their customers to be even more hungrier??). The decor is super cool and surprisingly not as tacky as one would think.  My favourite item would be the Peking duck wraps. But what I love is the salad bar, not full of wimpy lettuce and bacon bits, but they actually have good salads! From squid and shrimp salad mixes to several combinations of couscous and seaweed. You can pretend to be healthy at a buffet!  It is a bit pricier than other Chinese buffets (~$35pp on a Sunday/holiday), but if you're going anyways, might as well be as satisfied as you can."}
{"text":"**3.5**   I've been to their sister buffet, Dragon Legend numerous times and I've had friends telling me that this location was better so I finally gave it a try on a Wednesday night at around 6:45pm.  I found that the food was cold from being left out for so long and the heating wasn't hot enough. The food they served is better/more expensive than Dragon Legend such that they had more seafood and the sashimi is unlimited. I do prefer some of the food that was provided here over Dragon Legend however I think the taste is a little mediocre / bland (eg. seafood boil needed more space).   The service was good, much better than the other location! They were attentive to our needs and cleared the tables right away.   Would I be back? Probably not, except on rare occasions maybe. I did prefer their food but cold food? No thank you! It's also a bit far and there's lots of traffic going their especially during rush hour so I would much prefer going to their Markham location."}
{"text":"You probably can't get more Chinese in terms of a restaurant name than Dragon Pearl. Unless you maybe throw \"Lucky\" in there some place. Actually, I think I want to open an Italian restaurant in Markham, near the Pacific Mall, and call it the Lucky Dragon Pearl. I'd serve dishes called shanghai spaghetti, szechuan scalipini, peking pizza, and lo mein lasagna. It would all be purely Italian food. Not a drop of soy sauce, nary a fortune cookie. I'd have table-side accordion players. Once in a while they'd slip into a pentatonic musical scale, until people took notice, and then they'd slip back.   It would be brilliant.   But Dragon Pearl Buffet. It really goes beyond the feed bag approach of many buffets. Variety was a bit less than Mandarin but the quality was a notch above. Service was exceptional. Fascinating was how easy it was to get a table Sunday noon. I got there about 20 min in advance of our 12:30 meeting time because I thought there'd easily be a 30 minute wait. No, sir.  A lot has been said about the food and decor. But I'll just say: Cage rooms? No cage dancers. No Jimmy Super Fly Snooka, either.   The only disappointment was the yorkshire pudding. Actually not the pudding itself but the gravy to go with it was watery and ghastly. Just ghastly. Oh I was so excited to see the combo on the buffet. Sigh.   Sunday lunch ran about $25 with tip. I'm coming back."}
{"text":"Love the interior not necessarily the food.  Buffet style Asian restaurant, reminded me of Mandarin with the choices they had, you know the asian chicken wings, chicken nuggets (chicken balls) sweet and sour stuff, grilled items and dim sum for lunch. Nice varitey all together however I do have one huge complaint and it's that the food was not consistent. For example, I would get shanghai noodles I try it and I really like it to a point I wanted to get more. So my next plate I grab those noodles again and this time it tasted totally different! Did they change chefs or recipes half-way through their lunch buffet? I also noticed it with other dishes as well, which sucks b/c if I hated it the first time why whould I get it again, but then again maybe this time it might taste better and vice versa.   Besides the food not being consistent the place is pretty sweet, well the interior not necessarily the food. The interior is very nice well decorated with a bunch of asian sculptures, dragon sculptures, disco balls hanging from the ceiling, some of the tables had massive chairs that looked like it was meant for basketball players. Those chairs had to be at least 7'0 tall, they had a table that was on a boat for all those FOBS that came to the restaurant. The interior is a huge eye-catcher, you're always constantly looking around to see what else they have.  Would I go back? If I was running out of time on what to eat then yes, If I had time to figure it out then no.  Items to definitely get:  - I don't know? The food is so inconsistent it's hard to say!"}
{"text":"Great chinese buffet. Way better than Mandarin. It's a little out of the way for me but it's worth the drive.  Also love the decor too."}
{"text":"If decor is what you are looking for, this is the place to go.  It's amazing how much they spend on the decor of this place.  This is an AYCE Chinese place.  Their food is gross.  You can't eat decor!  I don't know how anyone can say how good their food is.  They are just not good.  It's no different than any of the other AYCE joints.  I gave them one star for the decor and another star for their service.  Waiters were really nice but their food is like how Chinese food was 30 years ago.  This is Toronto.  Home of the best chinese food in North America.  Do yourself a favour and eat authentic Chinese food and not Chinese food that was made for non-Chinese.  We are already in 2011 not 1970."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by the decor in the restaurant.. I think it might be a fun date night restaurant.   Stopped in with a friend for a quick lunch and it was a nice surprise.   We mostly ate from the sushi table, I only wish there was a bit more of a selection to include sashimi. Perhaps there is more during dinner. There is a lot of hot food selection but I didn't sample it for lunch.    I look forward to going back and sampling some more of the dishes.   Lunch was reasonably priced and the service was great."}
{"text":"Generally, I am not a fan of buffets, so take my review with a grain of salt if you are into buffets. Generally, all the food is warm, not hot, all the flavors get mixed together, and everything tastes the same. Service was good though. Drinks always there, and plates always removed.   Buffet? Game plan, try a little bit of everything until you find something you like, then eat a lot of that. Did it. I tried Dim Sum, Sushi, Grilled foods, standard Chinese faire, cold foods, salads, deserts. Nothing that I could write home about enjoying here. I ended up wondering if I should go back for more, and decided that it just wasn't worth it.  The decor was ok, seemed a bit lackluster IMO, but it was ok. They tried to block out all the natural light from the windows, which I am not a fan of. I think the windows should be big and open, so people can see inside. There was a lineup at the front door, Who knows why, there was plenty of available seating in the restaurant. There is also a lot of weird objects around the restaurant. For example, when you walk in, you see the heads of the 12 zodiac symbols heads on display. It was unusual.  I really tried to find some hot foods, but everything was just barely warm. I need my food hot! I ended up eating from the noodle soup station, which was disappointing as well.  In this area, there are plenty of great restaurants. I don't think I would go for the all you can eat option again though."}
{"text":"Don't eat too fast, and choose food carefully.good good good choice.        (Why the review shall be so long!!!!"}
{"text":"Simply the best chinese buffet I have ever had! Trust me.... Perfect food, but on top of that, great environment (award-winning) interior design and super friendly staff. What else can you ask for ?"}
{"text":"Good service and food was good/average of ran AYCE chinese food. Its good to try at least once to see how it is like here. The service is pretty good with friendly staff, but they will tell you upfront that the seating is max 2 hrs but they didn't kick us out for staying longer. The only problem is that you only get a lobster tail once, that's it. It is not unlimited lobster. I don't plan to come back here again as there are other AYCE places that have more variety then this for similar price. The decor is really nice and worth checking out."}
{"text":"Slightly more expensive than the (in)famous Mandarin restaurant but I find more selection and the food has more flavour to it as well. Bonus half a lobster if visit on Saturday! The grill squid tasted funky though."}
{"text":"Dragon Pearl Buffet is more style and service over substance. The ambience is that of an antique palace complete with dramatic chairs, random sculptures and a looping video of Asia's version of the cooking channel. The space is clean and well kept, with dishes being whisked away the moment you put down your fork.   The food is passable, but don't expect anything out of the ordinary. They stick to the usual buffet choices of cold salad bar, mass produced sushi and various fried meats in sauces. The only thing I went back for seconds was the roast beef which was tender and tasty when smothered in gravy.   I have mentally deemed Dragon Pearl to be the moody more-expensive-looking cousin of Mandarin that likes to dress in period ware. A good place to come if you want to entertain but must eat buffet quality food."}
{"text":"We had a reservation here for a corporate lunch. I'd never been here before, some people had been however so I did the usual - look at the website, scope out what's good what's not. The website is very impressive & informative. Tells you bout the dragon noodle, the dragon 'pearl' ....in grave details. I was excited. We get to the restaurant and its something to see! At first, it seems very cool! The decor is all black/red/gold ish. The furniture is massive & impressive and so is the mood lighting. I sat down, ordered a jasmine tea & again was continually impressed. The tea pot itself was gorgeous! And the tea of course was yummy too...I was excited! So we all made our way to the buffet... And this is where my high wore off ...slowly but surely it became apparent why this place isn't as highly rated when it comes to Asian food as it should be. The food leaves a lot to be desired.  If I had to sum it up, Loblaws nearby has better sushi than they do...and Manchu Wok sells better noodles....its full of salt, fat & no flavor. The desserts are all packaged, thawed & displayed in the buffet. I'm giving them one star for the 'dragon noodle' tom yum soup I got freshly made. Other than that, this place is a total disaster. Avoid at all costs.."}
{"text":"Read it as 4.5 stars:  One of the best chinese AYCE joints in the GTA. Amazing food for a buffet. Great selection and everything was really tasty! I was surprised at how good it tasted. I wish it had more selection but I rather the quality be better, which is this case. The theme and atmosphere is old dynasty China and look beautiful. I want to sit in the BOAT next time. I know you can complain about a lot of things but this is buffet...not a resto. Beats the Mandarin hands down. Would come again! 4.5 stars"}
{"text":"This AYCE buffet really seats a good crowd. Some interesting architectural features too.  Unusual peacock/rattan chairs and tables made out of single pieces of wood. The decor definitely gives you a lot to look at.  The food is no slouch either. Soups, great salads (very fresh looking), fresh fruits and desserts. Lots of chilled and hot seafood.   You can get noodle soups made fresh too. The usual suspects on a hot buffet including some dim sum specialties and a good sized sushi section.  Servers are friendly and attentive. Parking right in front can be a challenge and during peak times can be crazy busy.  Well laid out for large groups and supports large scale AV too."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the better buffets in the GTA. I don't normally visit buffets unless there's a birthday, graduation, or special occasion and my massive group of a family insists on going out to eat and gorge on food together as a way to celebrate. For this purpose, Dragon Pearl does the job quite well.  Service is quite pleasant. Food quality is average, but there's a decent amount of variety and the atmosphere makes up for it. Lots of tables, decor is grandiose and ostentatiously decorated. Great ambiance for a celebration or special gathering.   You should try to get: the rice cakes, the black sesame ice cream, the deep fried chicken wings, the chicken dumplings, the dim sum items, the peking duck (keeping in mind that you shouldn't expect amazing quality, it's decent for where you are and what you get), roast beef, honey BBQ ribs. Don't expect over-the-top quality but these are decent.   Your should pass on: the sushi and the noodles. Save the room in your stomach. They're both quite plain and lack the flavour you would expect.   Overall, this wouldn't be my first choice for a meal on a regular day, but it's certainly a good choice for a big family meal, celebratory gathering, or even a special after-church lunch. Make reservations, especially on weekends, as they tend to get very busy."}
{"text":"I was here for lunch on a weekday (sunday). I was disappointed by the selection as well as the food that was mediocre. However the service was decent considering it was a acye. Fast and efficient.  Also the interior is pleasant compared to Mandarin buffet.  So overall.. I would say value is the same for this buffet and Mandarin... just the ambience is different."}
{"text":"One of my favourite AYCE restaurants. On weekends they serve Peking duck which is delicious because it's so fresh and juicy. There is a lot of variety and the quality is on point. Free meal on your birthday if you come eat with three additional friends/family members!"}
{"text":"I've got mixed feelings about this place. The decor is unique and we were there during the face-changing/mask-changing performance. I'm not sure if that's a weekly or nightly thing though. So overall it made for a very unique buffet experience.  In terms of the food itself, it is generally higher quality than most Chinese buffet places. They serve up Peking Duck, which isn't exactly a novelty for buffets in this day and age in the GTA. While the quality is generally higher, they also seem to have a smaller spread than what you might expect, so there's a bit less variety. Compared to the space of the restaurant, the buffet section is relatively small. Desserts were also better than most buffet places. If you're a fan of seafood, there is some, but it's a weaker selection than what I've seen in the buffets out in Brampton.  Overall, it's a decent place. I'd recommend giving it a shot if you're in the area looking for a buffet, but it's definitely not a place I'd frequent, nor make a special trip for."}
{"text":"Generally not a AYCE fan (not because I am better than them but because I can't control my freakin appetite) but this one is one of the best in terms of quality and variety of food. The service is...well it is a ayce.  The sushi here is decent but don't expect a la carte quality.  The cooked food is where this place excels.  The prime rib was so flavourful.  The Peking duck is legit and the hand-made soup noodle is totally on point.   Overall, the cooked food is worth the price of admission.  I don't eat desserts but the fresh fruit was really sweet and juicy!  So if you are going to lose control and gorge, you might as well do it here."}
{"text":"Once you get past the wow factor of the decor you will realize that this is the only good thing about this place. Went for lunch buffet on a Friday afternoon. $14.99 a person. From all the food sections they had available: appetizers, entree, grilled, sushi, fruits, soups, icecream and desserts - I thought the appetizer, fruit and icecream sections were the best. Everything else was below average. There was no sashimi available for the sushi section and for the entree's they were just all loaded with salt.  And just to point out Gragon Pearl is the exact same place as Dragon Legend just named differently. Also noticed a sign at the entrance that prices will be going up to $15.99 later this month for lunch.  My advice.... walk by this place and don't look back and go straight into Spoon and Fork which is in the same plaza. Its a bit more at $18 a person for lunch but you get way better food."}
{"text":"I found it an above average experience for Chinese style buffet, food selection a bit wider than the usual, including a separate counter serving lobster (limited to one serving per person) and a counter serving roast beef and Yorkshire puddings (!!?) Obviously this type of food doesn't stack up again a decent restaurant but everything I tried was pretty good.  The place itself is vast  with very high ceilings and lots of room both around the buffet and between tables.  Leave some room for icecream... try a scoop each of vanilla, mango and black sesame."}
{"text":"I am not allowed to frequent Chinese buffets in that my significant other is from  Hong Kong and is quite aware of great Chinese food. He made the exception this time as I wanted to have family who live in area. The atmosphere is lovely while the food was the worst i have had in my 45 plus years. We eat out 4-5 times per week from the cheap and cheerful to full service 5 star. This place was deceptive as the decor is good and expectations rise. The food was all cold, the chicken either under or over cooked. The fish was nasty and the squid had uncooked lard like pulp within. Many discrete moments with food spit into napkin. The custard was the only item I could stomach after trying about 40% of the dishes. I was aware of the waste this created but was unable to swallow. My partner has  made me promise to never again request Chinese buffet and I will not after this."}
{"text":"3 for food 4 for quickness of delivery  3 for price  5 for friendliness of delivery    Same order twice Rainbow roll only comes with salmon & avocado."}
{"text":"Decent selection of food.  They have a noodle bar, Peking duck and roast beef.  They also have a great selection of desserts."}
{"text":"I love this place! Staff was super friendly. My drink refills magically appeared after I returned to my table. Tons of seafood, sushi was great. Almost everything I had was delicious.  Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Visiting from Michigan and really surprised at how deep the Asian culture runs in Toronto. There is a sea of Asian food restaurants to choose from so it was extremely hard to find one restaurant. After searching Yelp repeatedly, I came across this place. I wanted a all you can eat, so I could try a variety of food. Can during lunch with 4 children and 2 adults. I was pleasantly surprised at the variety. They even had pizza and French fries. The ice cream selection was great. There was a sushi bar, salad/fruit bar and variety of Chinese dishes. I usually take a lot of pictures but managing 4 kids in a all you can eat took most of my time. I would definitely go back, really sad we don't have anything close to this in Michigan."}
{"text":"Been here many times for company lunches since my office is close by so I guess I could say I am a regular here.   Coming to dragon pearl to me the first couple times has always been exciting but since I usually come during company lunches around colleagues I tend to avoid binge eating. Nonetheless, after coming so many times I have gravitated towards a handful of dishes.   Things I would recommend trying:  - Mango Salad - Lobster soup (5/5 buffet standards for me even though I am not a fan of seafood!) - Fried chicken ( I know ... but I like how the chicken is quite crispy rather than soggy without being overly dried) - Fried rice cakes - Sushi/sashimi (rate it around 3/5 buffet quality- not many buffets serve sashimi)  - Peking Duck (definitely what stands out in dragon pearl)  - Tofu Fa (pleasant seeing this here)   Service is good but the thing I find needs improvement at Dragon pearl is probably the lack of appealing dishes aside from the ones listed above. The sushi does require abit more attention when rolling and the noodle-making robot does not seem to be working the last time I went which was quite a disappointment.   Below are some quick tips and personal myths I have for people who are looking to maximize their buffet eating experience.   - There is a big possibility that the average person will not be able to get their \"money's worth\" at a buffet. That is why I recommend trying EVERYTHING but only at little quantities at first   - Start with the warmer foods (despite going for salads at the beginning) then transitioning over to cooler room temperature foods (cool salads and sashimi) then proceed to cake and Ice cream  - Combine ice cream with the waffles and the toppings from across the room to make yourself a great waffle treat!  - Pace yourself and enjoy the food !"}
{"text":"We were in the area and our local colleague took us there for a bite to eat. It was a huge buffet remembering me American buffets in some Southeast Asian countries hotels. I'd say it's an international buffet with food from different part of the world, such as Asiatic (Chinese, Japanese...), European, American and so on. It's nice to have such a food choice and it's funny to get food tips from colleagues while gazing different buffets in wonder^^ Our meals were tasteful and fresh. The price was cheap and the service was friendly."}
{"text":"Seems to be the same as Dragon Legend in Markham, so my review will be similar.  Lunch buffet was about $16 which I found to be very reasonable. The quality was great for a buffet. Best things include the sushi, grilled vegetables and meat and the homemade noodles in soup. They also had one of my favorites: hollow balls that look like cream puffs but they are rolled in sugar.  Clean restaurant, constant filling of water glasses and clearing of used plates. They were great with our very large group."}
{"text":"What an incredible experience at an AYCE!!!  Food:  what a huge variety of appetizers, salads, entrees, and desserts!  We had gone for a weenend dinner, and for about $28/person (less 20% for seniors), it was well worth it!  The buffet included a salad bar (didn't even try it), grilled pineapple, shrimp dumplings, grilled plaintain, sushi, pad thai, salmon, fish filet, mussels with black bean sauce, pepper salt shrimp, shrimp tempura, sashimi, Peking duck with lettuce and pancake wraps, BBQ spareribs, kalbi short ribs, char siu, prime rib, and lobster (each person is give one ticket for a 1/2 steamed lobster).  The dessert table included assorted cakes, cheesecakes, ice cream, creme brulee, fresh fruits, bread putting, nanaino bars, silken tofu, chocolate-dipped strawberries, puddings, waffles, almond cookies, tarts, and honey twists.  They also had their \"dragon\" noodles (served with three different soup broths) and \"dragon\" pearls, which are their specialities, as they are hand-made.  There were other things, too, which I can't remember.  Now, how in the world can you eat all this???  If I had known that they had all this, I would have starved myself all day prior to eating here.  I was just too full to try everything; next time I will know better.  Almost all the food was delicious.....until I was too stuffed to eat.  A special word about their \"dragon\" noodles and \"dragon\" pearls:  this was entertaiment by itself!  It was interesting to watch the noodle maker stretch the dough and throw it up in the air and eating the freshly-made noodles.   It was also cool watching these huge round deep fried sesame balls called \"dragon\" pearls being made, which symbolize good luck; I've known them as \"jin dui\" in a smaller version.  I've never seen them sooooo huge before!  They'll break it up after it's done so that everyone can try it.  They were good, however, they were a little more crunchy than what I've been used to, but I guess it's a regional thing, i.e., adapted to the people living geographically in a specific area.  Decor:  this restaurant is HUGE!!!  Interior lights are dim, which enhance all the deep red colors (Chinese love the color red for good luck) and all the petrified wood furniture throughout the restaurant.  With the high ceilings, it makes the restaurant interior look even bigger.  The heavy wooden-carved furniture was impressive!   We sat in these heavy wooden chairs with tall backs, as if we were sitting like royalty.  There are also huge red chandeliers everywhere with eye-boggling decor.  There's even wooden boat-shaped tables.  When you first enter the restaurant, there are bronze statute heads of all the Chinese astrological signs with illustrated cards describing the traits of each astrological sign that you can freely take as you please.  I overhead someone say that the restaurant won an architectural design award, which I can certainly believe.  Service:  despite the variety of foods on the buffet, all food items were replenished promptly.  I was impressed that there were no empty serving trays, considering the number of people that were dining there. The wait service was excellent - water glasses were constantly refilled, and empty plates were promptly taken away.  Anyone celebrating a birthday is given a cupcake with a candle on it.  At the end of the meal, each person was given a hot towel accompanied with fortune cookies.  This restaurant has its act together - service is excellent (there were 20 in our group), with many more people dining there at the same time.  This restaurant is fairly new, as it has been open only since November 2010,  For a special occasion, it's an excellent place to go to.  I can't wait to go back again, and this time, I'll be starving before I get there."}
{"text":"+.5 for service  I've been to the sister Dragon Legend location a few times, but was recently invited to dine here as it was closer to some of my extended family who live downtown. Either way, I was able to compare the two to see which one is better.  The most unique thing that stands out between the two branches is that this restaurant offers a huge sesame ball called the Dragon Pearl (hence the name), which you have to purchase separately for $10.99. Honestly, you're paying for the show, the hype, and how big the sesame ball is, but at the end it's just a simple sesame ball.  As for the place itself, it's quite large and about the same size as Dragon Legend, but Dragon Legend is a lot more of a maze compared to here. The parking situation here is a little better, as there's more parking spots due to the abundance of other restaurants and grocery stores.  There is a good variety of food, but I will say that Dragon Legend has a larger variety of food options. For example, during my time eating here, the buffet area offered only one variety of noodles, while Dragon Legend had at least three. Dragon Legend also wins with respect to the peking duck section, as this place does not make them fresh (you have to grab the duck pieces and wrap yourself, unlike Dragon Legend where they cut it fresh as you arrive). Everything else is quite similar though.  Service was better here, as the servers were quick to refill our water and take our old dishes away as we were grabbing new food to eat.  Personally I prefer Dragon Legend more, but wouldn't oppose to coming here again."}
{"text":"For the average first-timer to this buffet, it does a lot of the things Mandarin Buffer already offer. If Dragon Pearl wants to stand out, it would need to acquire the courage to cut the CURRENT menu in half, and bring in NEW dishes of food, flavour, and spectacle.       I went in at around 11am on a Sunday, the price is $21.99 which is fairly expensive depending on your opinion for buffets. My advice is to eat minimum 3 full plates of whatever you like PLUS a bonus plate for desert. Optional 5th serving is bowl of yummy soup or fruits to finish off your day. In this way, you would \"get your money's worth\" for the price you paid per person.       Seating, table space, cutlery, room decor, and (of course) food are ALL acceptable and above. YOU COME for the food but YOU STAY for the chance to talk with your friends, family, or co-workers!  Bottom line: you can't go wrong with Dragon's Pearl. Just remember the dragon will burn your wallet when you come in large numbers."}
{"text":"Came here at noon for lunch. On Tuesdays, there is special pricing as it's $14.50 for lunch (regular price is $17.99). This place isn't your typical Chinese buffet - it's nicely decorated, clean, and the service is good.   Food: The buffet has many options and is organized into sections: grilled foods, sushi, dessert bar, bread & soup, etc. The dragon oden station, which is by the salad and dessert bar, caught my eye. At this station, you get to customize your own noodle soup with vegetables, fried tofu, fish balls, and udon noodles. Then, they cook it in a pot for you and you choose the broth that you want. I chose the Szechuan beef broth, which was quite spicy but flavourful! The taste reminded me of the spicy broth that is usually used for hot pot. Other memorable foods that I liked were the red sausage, curry fish balls, and grilled squid. I also tried the fried scallop & tofu. To my surprise, it was actually fried tofu shaped like a scallop.  For dessert, I had the green tea mousse cake, nanaimo bar, and the almond cookies. These were a bit too sweet but it was decent overall. I also tried the cappuccino ice cream that was labelled sugar-free. Unfortunately, it was too sweet for me.   Value: At regular pricing, I would probably go for dim sum if I want some variety. However, for the discounted price on Tuesdays, I wouldn't mind returning to Dragon Pearl as it's a pretty decent buffet - spacious, clean, and no lineup (at least on a weekday)!"}
{"text":"We ordered delivery from here on Saturday, and it was quite good. Fairly priced, and lots of food. The breaded shrimp in lemon sauce was great! I wouldn't suggest the duck salad.. not that it wasn't fresh or tasty, but it was weird and the dressing just didn't fit. All in all a very nice meal for the price."}
{"text":"A bit more pricey than other Chinese buffets but the sushi is good..they have Peking Duck and Lobster......excellent fot large groups!   Lots of food so go hungry!"}
{"text":"Wow is the first word that comes to mind about this place. Talk about everthing you can get in a Chinese restaurant but with a twist, there is also a Sushi bar which loved sushi is one of my fav go to fast food. By far one of the BEST  buffets i have been to in a while . I am going to sit here and enjoy this moment. While i dig my fork in a bowl of sticky rice and savor this moment."}
{"text":"This beats my favorite buffet restaurant (Franky Tomatoes). The shipwreck-themed decor is beautiful. The highlights here is they've got some premium dishes commonly found in asian restaurants like peking duck; red bean, black sesame seed, green tea ice cream flavours etc. The dessert section is almost similar to the Mandarin's having fruits, cakes and waffles. They have a mini noodle soup section which is quite unique. I'd say the grill and barbeque section is the best; best section in the restaurant and the best bbq grill feature compared to other buffets that have bbq."}
{"text":"It is a bit expensive but I think for what you get it is worth the price. Especially their noodle soup is really good."}
{"text":"Honestly the best way i could describe it is a slight upgrade over mandarin. The environment is really nice and big i didn't expect the sitting area to be that large. The selection of the food is good too. The lunch prices are pretty decent as well. The food was not quality but not horrible either. Overall it was decent"}
{"text":"Clean and better offerings than mandarin buffet. I like their grill station and dessert selection. Also like their lobster, sushi, and doe hua. Plus there's a hand wash station outside.   Great decor. A fantastic buffet  Experience."}
{"text":"went there with friends for lunch.  Food is average ,not  impressive.  renovation is really stylish though."}
{"text":"Really nice.. Love the place, Nice to be with a girlfriend, or a family, the sitting area is unreal.. Food is good, Dessert was the best.. a little too much $$ for a buffet especially on weekend...but it is worth to try it"}
{"text":"Good atmosphere and service. We came here on a Sunday afternoon with a large group of 20 people. The food overall was good except for the Oysters, a Sunday Special. One member of our group became very ill afterwards and was sick the whole night vomiting because of it.  It was also pretty tough for the vegetarians in our group who struggled to find veggie options.   Overall, It's definitely a good alternative to Mandarin if you're looking for an Asian inspired buffet but I would be very careful and stay away from the Oysters."}
{"text":"Decor here is really nice. Reusing old wood, clean and spacious. It's one of those places you'd go for a group gathering and have a great time. Food is secondary.  The food here ranges from mediocre to good. The sesame chicken is pretty good. I saw them pouring a new batch so I grabbed a few pieces. Crunchy and coated with a slightly sweet sauce and sesame seeds. The noodles, rice, veggies and dim sum were all pretty much mediocre. The same thing can be said about the sushi, but I saw them filleting a salmon and it was really fresh. The salad bar is alright, good choices, ceasar salad was freshly tossed. Soup selection was alright. I loved the grilled pineapple. Dessert had a good selection of fresh fruits and cakes. I save just enough room for a small bowl of silken tofu and the syrup has ginger in it! Its harder to find that in Toronto now because I heard it takes a lot of time and effort for a little bit of ginger taste to it. They also have waffles.   Service was attentive, dishes were cleaned with minutes of us finishing our plates. Tea was always refilled. I chose the oolong tea and it was pretty good.   For an AYCE place, this place is good for its value since they have a good variety of choices."}
{"text":"Won't be going back!!! Drove through a snow storm to have dinner and regretted it the moment I tried the food. The food I had from the \"hot\" tables was cold almost to the point I wondered if it was safe to eat. I noticed they came out from the back with what appeared to be fresh hot ribs and when I got back to the table to eat it they were COLD!!!! The mandarin seems like a Michelin star restaurant if your were to compare the two. If you want good Chinese food ASIAN LEGEND is the place"}
{"text":"Best buffet I have ever been to. Worth the drive if you don't live in this area but make a reservation, it gets packed. Food from various regions (Japanese, Thai, Chinese, etc) and all very fresh. No heat lamps or pools of grease under the food. Service is excellent and the decor is gorgeous. A must try!!"}
{"text":"Dragon Pearl is the older sibling of its sister restaurant Dragon Legend in Markham.  Much like the Legend, the Pearl offers a higher end Asian buffet with crazy ass emperor styled wooden chairs, carvings and even a couple of tables shaped like a freaking boat!  The food is bit more expensive here but the quality is pretty good with the stand outs for me being the dragon noodles and the Peking duck.  Surprisingly they even have salmon sashimi for the lunch menu when we went which is usually only for dinner.  Service is okay and the workers are pretty attentive to clearing plates and filling drinks.  Personally I still prefer the Legend but Dragon Pearl is still a great all you can eat buffet in the area.   3.5/5."}
{"text":"Price: Weekday Dinner 22.99, Weekend Dinner 27.99  Dragon Pearl buffet has one of the nicest decors I have ever seen for a Chinese restaurant. They provide a wide selection of food including PEKING DUCK (my fave), dim sum, prime rib, and sushi. The place was surprisingly packed but service was very efficient. Our plates were whisked away the moment we finished.  In terms of food, I found the sushi quality to be quite good and they even have albacore tuna sashimi. The rest of the food was mediocre, typical chinese buffet style dishes. They have a station where they offer handmade noodles and you can pick your own soup base (tom yum, minced pork, etc).   The dessert selection was AMAZING. Tiramisu, green tea mousse cake, mango pudding, ice cream, and the list can go on!   Overall I think dragon pearl is worth visiting, however I am giving them 3 stars because 22.99 is quite pricey for a chinese buffet especially since there is no seafood. I will probably be coming back in sept for the free birthday special they offer!"}
{"text":"Went on a Friday night looking forward to AYCE crab legs. Suggested Dragon Pearl to my friend and her dad, from Chicago. We were a table of four, so requested for crackers to open the crab legs. We were told by a waiter, or perhaps he was a manager, that we would have to share two crackers amongst us! I was embarrassed and disgusted. As sloppy and messy as crab legs are, he had the audacity to tell us we must share."}
{"text":"Standard Chinese buffet with really cool interior!  My fiance's family and I came here for another holiday feast. Each of us received a voucher for half of a lobster. Unfortunately no one in the family except for me is crazy about seafood. I stuffed myself silly with 1.5 lobsters. Just steamed lobsters but I didn't want them to go to waste!   The sushi was good but I couldn't let myself overstuff myself with sushi rice. My other fav was the stir fry mushroom and the grilled mushroom! The steamed cod was also really good and I helped myself 2 servings!   Although the dessert section looked extensive, there was nothing that tasted AWESOME. I ended up filling up on the steamed gingered milk with a scoop of green tea on the side. I also had their baked \"creme brulee\"  but it tasted sooooo eggy. A great \"let's try\" ayce but nothing amazing to worth returning to."}
{"text":"I went on a Tuesday and it was only $11.99 because we paid with debit/cash.  I love the decor here. It's so unique inside with dim lighting, tables on \"dragon boats,\" jewellery on display, etc. The dining area was very impressive: huge, lots of seating, and cool chairs. However, I would say the dining area takes up 90% of the place and the food area takes up only 10% of the place so when you want to get food, it's pretty crowded.   The food is mediocre: there's nothing really bad or really good. They have sushi, meats, noodles, desserts, and so on. There were some food items here that I tried for the first time and I really liked them--one of them was bread pudding (definitely try it!).  Service is alright. We tried asking if they had a birthday special but our waitress was very misleading. She said that they didn't have one but we had already gone on their website, which shows that you're supposed to eat free during your birthday month. When we asked her why the website says there's a special, she went into a lengthy explanation trying to justify why she had told us there wasn't a birthday special.   Overall, for the price (on Tuesday), it was definitely worth it. You wouldn't even be able to get a decent meal at a fast food place for this price so I recommend coming here... only on a Tuesday though!"}
{"text":"I've come here twice now with pretty similar, positive, experiences.  Dragon Pearl Buffet is basically a Mandarin clone with more to offer on the seafood front.  We came with a reservation both times but neither time did I see a huge line if you decide to go here on a whim.  The food is generally solid.  They market a different special for each day of the week and it seems like a neat idea from a marketing standpoint (sometimes it's a special food, others it's price cuts).  They have small sections for soups, dessert, cold foods, meat, seafood, dim sum and a few others so there's plenty of variety.  The dinning room is basically one gigantic open room and one smaller one when it's busier.  For those that like to be in smaller areas to keep the noise down, this may not appeal to you.  There's still ample space to get to your table if you do get stuck in the middle.  Service isn't anything mindblowing, but there's also nothing to really complain about either.  What prevents me from giving this a 5 star is the price is a little higher than I'd like, especially because I'm not a seafood eater.  The bill was over $100 for two adults plus a drink each on a Friday night, after tax and tip, which is a bit much for my liking.  If you want something a little different than some of the other buffet places out there, Dragon Pearl Buffet isn't a bad alternative.  It's just a little pricier than most others."}
{"text":"A friend and his family were celebrating at the Dragon Pearl and invited us to join them.  There is stuff for sale throughout the restaurant  It is a big restaurant and it was a busy spot.  It's a buffet restaurant and there was lots to choose from.  If you are a seafood lover, there is shrimp, oysters, calamari and even lobster (on the weekends).  Here's a sample of what I had ... chicken, ribs, pepper steak and veggie rice.  I can't resist chocolate-covered strawberries!  Since it's Roger's birthday, a couple of the servers sang Happy Birthday and gave him a heart-shaped cake with a candle.  The food was good (I'm soooooo full!) and the servers were friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"Surprised by the quality and selection of the food i.e. sushi, lobster, kalbi, noodles, peking duck, etc.  Dining experience was great -- lots of tables for big groups of 8 or more."}
{"text":"About as good as a Chinese AYCE can get, which is a notch above mediocre. Good selection of different types of food, but quality is inconsistent. We went there for a birthday (Friday night) and we were treated well.  Some random thoughts on the food:  Roast beef -- decent quality, not steakhouse quality prime rib but decent, tender and still pink (I sliced off the first piece from a new roast that just came out)  Dim sum -- formerly frozen, nothing to write home (or to Yelpers) about  Sushi/sashimi -- decent size pieces, including tuna and butterfish, but middling amount of selection. They had rolls with soft shell crab! Nice.  Special stuff -- didn't bother with that long noodle thing -- just filler, folks. Don't waste your time. Grilled Korean short ribs were pretty good as was the Peking Duck.  Not much seafood -- no half lobster like they used to have but they had a spicy seafood boil, that had mussels, crab, and a few lobster claws. Some guy stood at the buffet and took out every single lobster claw while others stood by and watched. Buffets bring out the best in humanity, like traffic jams and Trump rallies.  Desserts -- ugh. Creme brulee without the brulee (I guess the torch went missing), strange looking cakes and alot of other bad-tasting stuff. Even the fruit was sadly lacking.  I'm always strangely drawn to the food-related video that loops on the big screens around the dining room. It's like an extreme version of that show on Food Network where the dude goes around China tasting all kinds of weird dishes. Except there's no sound and the words on the screen are in Chinese, so you have to guess what they're catching/cooking.  Oh and bring your own teacup. They serve tea in these cute little cups that hold about 1 oz. So you're constantly pouring. Or better yet, just order a beer."}
{"text":"Would give \"0\" star if i could to the delivery and food quality is mediocre. I have been a regular customer here and decided to order again. This is the only time i have forgotten to add tip online when i was ordering online and i didn't have any change when the delivery guy brought my food. He was rude and disrespecrtful and i was shocked with what he told me when he was leaving. He first asks for tip with the words \" Give me something\". I told him i didn't have any change now and he just turned his back giving bullshit and i heard him say \"fuck\" and \"shit\" when he was walking away. It is common courtesy to tip the people but it is NOT mandatory. I always tip about 15% everywhere if the service meets the standards and more if everything is better than standards. One rule that applies to everybody is that YOU DON'T ASK FOR TIP WITH A DEMANDING ATTITUDE !     More importantly , YOU DON'T CURSE AT YOUR CUSTOMER , if he can't tip you for only one time !!  I was shocked first and i only slammed the door but i feel like everybody needs to knows this attitude. Shame on you for treating a loyal customer this way and this was my last order with them.  After i close the door, i got so pissed at myself for not saying anything back because i was shocked...and I couldn't even enjoy my  $50 dollars worth of food.. Also Dragon pearl should be ashamed of having an employee like this ! In the customer service business, your employee always represents your company. Big company, small company doesn't matter.  Also when i called in the restaurant to complain, the guy on the phone didn't understand my complaint and i had to repeat it about 5 times and finally he told me his manager, Vicky will call me tomorrow. Lets see what happens..."}
{"text":"So tonight was the first time going to this buffet. Seems nice enough with decent decor and friendly service. The issue seems to be selection of food. They have this dessert type dish is THE dragon pearl. However always seem to give a a piece the size of lettuce that falls of as u eat a hamburger. So it's tiny. They also make it a point to say u only get one piece each time. It seems if u r a buffet and that's like your signature dish u should maybe make a lot of it. Maybe? Then there is this tofu dessert. Very classic Chinese dessert in this giant bowl w some syrup u can add. However they ran out at around 7:15 tonight. Surprise! That's it. That's interesting that a buffet would run out of a particular item. Better yet it gets replaced w this soup. I'm being harsh but I tend to eat my dessert at the end of the meal. So that's likely why I was a little peeved when I tried to get some and noticed it was gone. I tell the chef and they r very apologetic. They were surprised it was out. Wtf. Of course it will run out. U didn't have a giant bowl there. It was a mid size bowl tops. Anyways, I'm not going here again. Eat the tofu dessert first!!!!!"}
{"text":"I have very low expectations for any kinds of Chinese buffets, because a lot of the time it is Americanized Chinese food. It was somewhat better than I expected.   When you come in they give each person a lobster ticket to redeem half a lobster. Except they ran out of lobsters. With the amount of tickets they were giving out that night, they should've guessed and provided enough."}
{"text":"They got pretty big buffet and the decor is quite unique too. I will give it a thumbs up. And yes if you are a mandarin fan, this is gonna be a surprise for you."}
{"text":"Holy RED!!!!! The decor boasts a higher end sophistication compared to most Chinese buffets I`ve seen. From plates to walls, RREEEDDDD!!!  Very spacious though.   Lobster portions were small and one coupon per person allowed.  Quality of the food was good but nothing amazing.  Any place that serves AYCE salmon sashimi is enough to lure me back in. I steered clear from the crusty looking sushi rolls though. Our waitress was very polite and quick to take our drink orders.  After complanining about the table choice we were placed in ( Which was ALLLL the way at the back of the room, about a 1 min walk from the food and mind you the place was not yet busy!!!), the Manager came to promplty sit us closer, nothing special but at least he didn`t show any attitude or I would`ve used every swear word I learned from my Chinese pals.  I prefer this place over Manadarin. I get a bit more entertainment from the ladies making some fresh noodles right in front of you while you nibble on some of their `dragon pearl`fried dough thingy."}
{"text":"In terms of chinese buffet, this one seems to be the best in Toronto.  We went there for lunch buffet and they had a lot more selection than mandarin.  They had 5 or 6 types of sushi rolls and offered salmon sashimi.  That was the best part of the buffet.  In terms of quality, it was ok, you get what you get at a chinese buffet, lots of black pepper and starchy stuff so you drink more water.  Some of the food was a little dry, but that was ok.  I just like the selection, they seem to have a lot more than other buffets.  Service was top notch, plates were taken away and water was refilled constantly.  Best service I ever received anywhere.  Service and selection for the win, would go again.  4 adults with tax was 90 dollars, with tips, 103, something like that for the lunch weekend buffet."}
{"text":"Had a christmas get together with some co workers.  Service: I liked how they accommodated a sizable group and understood when some people couldn't make it.  Cleanliness:. Not much to say, everything was clean including the washrooms.  Food: There isn't much of a difference between here and other places like mandarin. You have the usual sections (desserts, soups, etc). The new things that I have tried here was there seafood mix (spicy but defintely a variety of seafood from shrimp to crawfish), and their \"Soft taco Peking Duck\" . That is the name I gave it because the way it was displayed: slices of peking duck mixed with some scallions and another greens, their special sauce, wrapped in a small flat pita like shell. Very delicious!  The place is expensive and drinks do not come with the AYCE but I wouldn't mind coming back there for another co worker outing."}
{"text":"Me and my friends just ate here awhile ago and we are definitely coming back again! Asking for a reservation in this buffet is so easy and the staff is so nice!  The place is so huge and very different from the common buffet house I think a thousand people can fit in and it will still not be crowded.. It is a self serve buffet and you can see the managers roaming around the place most of the time.   Theres a variety of foods there (I saw a tiny pan of pizza but havent tried it) The salt and spicy shrimp is good and also the Philadelphia rolls. The sashimies are also good specially the salmon and the white fish tuna.  You should try their dragon pearl sesame ball (you get to see it right away because it is so big) It doesnt look good at all but it really does taste PERFECT. It costs 9 dollars to buy it but you get to taste it for free.  The ambiance is so relaxing and peaceful. (Ship inspired) One of the managers came to our table and asked if we liked their place and how did we know the newly opened buffet. He was so funny and entertaining and he didnt look intimidating at all.  If youre thinking about going to Mandarin or Woo, you should definitely go to Dragon Pearl Buffet because it doesnt look cheap and your money would be worth it.  Here's a link of their lunch and dinner: http://img101.imageshack.us/i/img0716xd.jpg/"}
{"text":"Its alwaysssss the allure of all you can eat, but when you're done...You hate yourself lol.   This place is nice. It's a nice step up over a place like the mandarin.  At the end of the day though, it is your neighborhood AYCE place."}
{"text":"Dragon Pearl is a Chinese buffet restaurant famous for their \"Dragon's Pearl\", a large fried sesame dessert delicacy. The pearls are only one of the many delicious items you'll find at this very interestingly themed Chinese buffet. Upon entering you will immediately notice a heavy, dark wood motif. Apparently the wood was salvaged from ships which were sunk some time ago. The atmosphere is very nice and a welcome change from other higher end buffets. On the buffet you have a great selection of sushi (including sashimi at dinner), cold and hot appetizers, a custom soup/noodle bar, various Chinese dishes (including BBQ pork and Peking duck), a large seafood station, assorted desserts (cakes, iced cream, fruit), and of course the Dragon Pearl.   Pros: Dragon Pearl offers a lot more authentic Chinese style dishes compared to other buffets outside of the predominantly Chinese areas of the city. The food is well presented and clearly labeled in English and Chinese. There are many choices to choose so there is no reason anyone would not be able to find something to satisfy them. The hot food selection was very impressive and that was especially nice for someone like myself who enjoys more authentic style dishes like Peking duck, mixed Chinese mushrooms, and grilled octopus. One big plus is that the buffet offers many kid-friendly options (chicken balls, pizza, and fries) which would make it a very popular place for families of all ages. I personally found the sushi selection to be superb for a Chinese buffet mainly because they included fancier rolls and raw fish items (plus sashimi for dinner on the weekends). All of the other buffets I've visited only had basic California rolls and no sashimi.   Cons: Although the restaurant claims to serve lobster on the weekend dinner buffet, you are only given one half portion of lobster (half a tail and 1 claw) per person. When you are seated the hostess gives each person one voucher which must be surrendered when you receive your lobster. I can understand why they limit each person to a set amount after seeing people only eating lobster at another popular buffet. I personally feel that at $24 a person for dinner only being allowed half a lobster is not fair. My second complaint is that none of the hot food choices offered anything hot and spicy. Perhaps they should work on including one or two dishes which use chili to satisfy those who like a bit of heat on their plate.   What is the Dragon Pearl? The Dragon Pearl dessert is made by shallow frying a small ball of sesame dough in a large wok. The ball continues to get larger and thinner the longer it is fried. After about 5 minutes it is about a foot in width. Once cooked, it is cut open and into small pieces to be served with maple syrup or jam. Having never seen or had this unique dessert it was very interesting to see how it is made. Be sure to try some."}
{"text":"Basically food court food in a trendy chinese decor setting! Think Manchu Wok, or Mandarin but in a trendy decor!  Food is mediocre at best! Maki roll is all clumpy! Too much rice! Very crowded on their $10.99 Tuesday specials! Don't forget it's cash & debit only on their Tuesdays special! Can't believe I was only able to fill up in their special fresh made noodles! All other things I cud barely have the urge to even try... Sushi roll was a hot mess!  Don't think I'll go back not would I recommend it to anyone! One last thing, their \"Pearl\" is just some marketing gimmick for some sort of deep  fried crispy ball broken into pieces that tasted like oily crispy donut skin...without the doughy bits..."}
{"text":"DON'T GO TO THIS RESTAURANT!! We went there yesterday to celebrate a birthday. You are spending hundreds of dollars, because it is not cheap, and at the moment you stop eating the waiter comes to tell you that you are allowed only 15 min to stay, even if you are still drinking, because there are ppl waiting. There is no place for conversation and  one cannot enjoy 5 min break between helpings. It is eat super fast and get out. They offer very little in the cooked vegetable area, the lobster is so tough that you must have grizzly bear jaws to eat it.  We for sure will never go back. Cannot even come close to The Mandarin."}
{"text":"Never been here before and I fell in love with the decor, ambiance and...the company!  I am not a fan of buffets, but the desserts, fresh fruit and fried rice were outstanding.  This is a better experience than some lower end buffet place."}
{"text":"The food is adequate not the best chinese buffet I've been to but definitely NOT the worst. It's wise of them to hand out lobster ticket so everyone gets a piece. But it's too rubbery but this is buffet so this should be expected. I have never been to a buffet with decent freshness.   Will I recommend this to other people? Maybe."}
{"text":"First time eating here & I love it! Very nice  ambience & the waiting staff were very friendly! Loved the different varieties available & was given a free lobster ticket! I would come here again!"}
{"text":"I'm not a big buffet go-er but Dragon Pearl was suggested as I was planning a group dinner for my family.  I had requested reservations online but never got a confirmation so I panicked and called instead.  It was no issue getting a table for 12 on a Thursday night.  Traffic was awful trying to get across the city for 5pm so we ended up being about 40 minutes late.  Other members of our group had arrived on time so that held our table.  Once inside, I was surprised by how large the restaurant was.  The decor, although gawdy, was loved by all the kids, especially the dragon boat tables!  I found the food area small, especially for the restaurant size.  I'd hate to be there on weekends when it's packed.    Overall food variety was just okay...I thought the smaller serving trays might mean better, fresher food but I thought the food was still just lukewarm.  The Peking duck was good but there was not many other stand out dishes.  Dessert was probably the worst...old tasting jellos and mango pudding.  The most boring selection of melty ice cream (vanilla, strawberry, green tea).  No black sesame or mango ice cream.  It's kinda sad when the honeydew melon was the highlight of the meal as it was actually ripe and super sweet.  Our server was very nice and good to us, especially the kids.  We were lucky to see the mask dance show on our way out around 8pm.  I think maybe we'll stick to a Mandarin, if there is a next time for a buffet meal."}
{"text":"This is probably my favourite AYCE buffet in the GTA.   They offer a huge selection of food and strives to introduce a variety of dishes not found at other Chinese buffets.   This review is for the Sunday lunch buffet.  Some of the dishes I really loved included: - Rib Roast - Peking Duck - Cheese Baked Mussels - Salmon Chips - Chinese Sausages  - Almond Cookies  - Salmon Sashimi  Their sushi section wasn't the best so I only tried a few of those items. Overall, I was pleased with the service I received here (always came around to clear dishes and refill water) and the outstanding food I ate."}
{"text":"I usually don't care much for decor but Dragon Pearl put a nice one out there. In fact there are so many differently decorated corners that I got lost a few times and have been walking in circles like in labyrinth until I was rescued by my partner who apparently has better navigational skills than I. The food is good and very comparable to King Buffet and definitely way better than Star Walk or Mandarin. The variety is standard for all Chinese Buffets: salads, soups, Peking duck, sushi and sashimi, grilling station and myriad of dessert items. On top of that there is hand pulled noodle station where noddles are fed in one continuous strand right into the cooking pot, its fun to watch. Also you can order (for a separate fee) a giant dragon pearl, but they did not seem to be very popular. Everything was fresh and we ended up trying and liking most of the salads which is normally not the case so I was impressed, shrimps and mussels were top notch, meaty and fresh. My partner loved the honey baby back ribs which just slide of the bone and have been soaking in honey liquid for hours. For me that is a little too sweet. The Peking duck was ok, not as crispy as I like it to be, but decent. I really don't get the complain about it being sliced to thick, after all the meat is tender and juicy. What I did not like is their pancakes for the duck, too thick, and floury. They also offer a second course which you wrap in lettuce, that's a first time I see it in the buffet. Sashimi were fresh, and sushi were just ok. We did not get to the grilling station because I cannot stretch my stomach that much. The desserts were nice, we especially loved chocolate covered strawberries and noted that all fruits were ripe and sweet. Somebody really overate the honey twisters. All throughout dinner we were drinking green tea which is $2/pot, so we got one pot and kept refilling it with hot water all night. Overall we enjoyed everything and I would definitely recommend this place to some buffet-loving friends.   Making reservations is probably a good idea since the place is packed, plus you can ask to be seated in the boat table, which is a lot of fun."}
{"text":"Better than Mandarin IMO.   Everyone gets 1 lobster tail but ask for a claw and they'll give you one. Variety of food and dessert is well worth admission price. trying everything will make you loosen the belt a little bit. i had a taro milk bubble tea and it was on par with the usual bubble tea shops. oh, also, ask your waiter/waitress for a dragon pearl.   the decor is very nice and the ambiance is classy, romantic and casual. if you have a party of 6, try getting seats on the boat. It adds to the experience.   best to make a reservation for friday/saturday nights.   it's rare for me to eat buffet dinner but when I go come back (2015), I'll be back at Dragon Pearl."}
{"text":"All you can eat, except for the lobster. But then, I've been here twice and from what I've seen you're welcome to my portion. Somewhere on my table the forlorn lobster ticket rests, allowing the lucky bearer to claim half of a small spiny crustacean and dig like hell for it's rubbery innards. Surrounding diners may lube it up with tonnes of garlic butter, but I'll just pass.   The rest of the buffet is several notches below proper a la minute Chinese food, but markedly better than the pink and green competition. The decor alone is worth a star; an evolution from red and black lacquer with copious golden dragons, to the hotel lobby aesthetic of the last 20 years, to what might be an outpost in a rural village. The bones of the restaurant are reclaimed ships wood, and the floors patterned concrete. Awkward chairs are more comfortable than they look. Service is prompt if over-eager. Wait staff tries to whisk my plate away before I'm finished, more than once.   The buffet layout is mildly confusing for first timers. A hand-cut noodle station and deep-fried dough-ball dessert are the first things you encounter. Salads, soups, dim sum, fried stuff and steam tables seem randomly mixed, perhaps to help control the flow of guests. The lobster spot is tucked away in the back corner closest to the washrooms, next to a flat grill and roast beef section.   The roast beef is surprisingly good quality. Yorkshire pudding and industrial beef gravy rounds out the plate. Grilled items include chicken, sausage, cuttlefish and pepperoni pizza. I'll let you figure out which of these items should stay on the table.   Chinese soups often suffer from a surfeit of sweetness or blandness. A seafood thick soup with lobster and egg white has neither problem. Add a few wontons from the neighbouring drum and you've got a pretty tasty first course.   Like most buffets, timing is key to the success of fried items. Chicken wings are greasy in a good way. Shrimp are just good, with a juicy crunch. Spring rolls are filled with vermicelli, peas and corn. They're less succesful over all.   Peking duck relies on hoisin sauce for flavour, but kudos for getting it out there. Dim sum favourites shrimp har gow and pork siu mai are bland despite the application oh hot sauce.   Hot table items vary likewise. A vat of vegetable fried rice looks dry, but vegetable chow mein is full of produce strips and has a pleasant ramen-like chew. Sauteed chinese greens are simple, but fresh and crunchy. Mixed tofu and vegetables would be similarly swell, but for too much sugar in the sauce. This is a theme. Carb-watchers would do well to avoid the rotation of chicken, beef and pork dishes, all of which look great but share the same battered sugary background. Satays are juicy and nicely charred, and if you're going to cheat on your low-carb diet you could do worse than fragrant meaty spare ribs.   I always skip dessert at buffets. My arteries would harden against me otherwise. Tea arrives in a pretty glass service, but cups are not even shotglass-sized. The brew stays warm over a candle, perhaps because of the time it would take to make it through a pot.   Overall, Dragon Pearl is good for what it is. And that's as much as I'll say about that."}
{"text":"Great food, better then mandarin. Service is okay, but not the best. Went Sunday durning lunch and had to wait in line for food at every station! Don't know if this is a regular thing but that kinda sucked. Overall good experience and will go back if it's not busy!"}
{"text":"We go here more for atmosphere but the food is good enough. The decor is nice and the space is great for large groups. As far as buffet goes, if you don't get an item where the food taste stale or old then it is good enough. Most of their items are better than average and Peking duck during dinner is a nice touch. They make a big deal about their lobster during dinner time but it's taste is nothing to impress. Sushi bar is good enough but selection is limited. Roasted/BBQ chicken is good and so is the glazed salmon, sesame chicken, and hot tofu dessert and mini croissants. Surprisingly their instant noodle fried is very good.  I wish they have more impressive vegetable dishes or more tasty fresh items at the salad bar.  Don't know why buffet desserts are just average, not decadent enough, no wow factor. Wish they have king crab. For now, this place is great for twice a year visit."}
{"text":"So this is a sister restaurant of Dragon Legend and I definitely like Dragon Legend over Dragon Pearl. I just think the layout of Dragon Pearl is smaller and also the crowd at this location is quite busy/in a rush or like too eager to get the food. I also found that the quality of oysters here not as good as Dragon Legend. In addition, the dragon noodle station at Dragon Legend had meat toppings for the soup while this one didn't. The woman doing the oyster section was very friendly though! Overall, this buffet is better than others with its specialty items like oysters and seafood boils that include Lobster, mussels, shrimp and crawfish but it doesn't beat Dragon Legend."}
{"text":"Fantastic AYCE. The best Chinese buffet I have ever been to, the food is delicious and fresh, there is so much variety. The restaurant is huge and very clean. Staff are friendly. I went there for dinner with my parents and they loved and enjoyed the atmosphere. I would go there again for sure"}
{"text":"The theme of this place is ... SIMILAR BUT DIFFERENT ...  We visited Dragon Pearl (DPB) location today for lunch.  Reviews of this location and other buffets tend to be fair better for the Friday/WE night dinners but we personally don't see the value.  We have two kids and the younger one still is quite finicky with their food.  Sure you may get crab legs but then that is what you are paying for and unless that is what you eat, you aren't getting your money's worth --- which I feel defeats the whole purpose of the \"buffet\" - I tend to want to go for the variety and when you are paying up in the $25/person range, I tend to be forced to eat the premium items only.  Further, if the bill starts creeping up to $100 - for about 30% less I can go to a real Chinese restaurant - order very good - fresh/hot entrees (assured of exactly what WE want) and even have left overs for lunch.  As many reviews have stated there is an inherent desire to compare this location to Mandarin.  What we noticed was that on average - DPB appears to have higher quality items but Mandarin has a greater range of (albeit) slightly lower quality.    At the grill - Mandarin has chicken/beef/sausage but at this location there was grilled chicken/sausage/pineapple/eggs/plantain/squid potatoes. (wife liked the plantain) ... yet no grilled beef.  Mandarin has simple \"crappy\" pepperoni/cheese pizzas where this place has a more robust sausage pepperoni pizza.  My son always gets a cheese slice but passed today - he refused to pick the sausage and pepperoni off.   (sometimes less is more).  I tried the pizza and it tasted fine.  Entrees - similar but different to Mandarin - Mandarin would have vegetable fried rice as here, but this place also had (quite nice too) Yang Chow fried rice with shrimp.  For the younger ones - they had chicken nuggets (warm not hot) yet no onion rings.  For Sushi offerings (we don't eat/cannot comment on taste) - far more here than Mandarin.    Deserts - big differences - DBP no pies (bread pudding -- really?); far more \"sugarless\" cakes/pastries yet some higher end cakes/pastries you don't see at Mandarin including real blueberry cheese cake (squares).  Mandarin - some of the offerings are poor but again - more variety, more ice cream choices and their mini choco-chip cookies are far better than the crappy ones here.  Interestingly at the DBP ice cream station they have \"choco\" \"rainbow\" sprinkles and marshmallows.  The choco syrup is way over at the waffle station which is a fair distance - just poor design overall.  Mandarin - has both choco/caramel syrup right in between the two ice cream freezers.  For our family, I guess we are used to certain things and the desert offerings at DBP albeit better, were no match to Mandarin's selection.  I did happen to try to noodles everyone seems to rave about - it was fine but in my version of a buffet \"soups\" \"salads\" and \"noodle bowls\" are mere filler and I tend to stay away.   The Dragon Pearl shell bites - zero taste zero point.  Big Picture Overall the experience was okay at the Dragon Pearl Buffet - similar but different and maybe one day we would return.  For a pure value play with more selection (albeit - you lose some of the quality items) Mandarin to us is a better value play.  (DPB is also a bit more money and doesn't follow the same \"50% off for child\" formula.)  Service - with a smile? We called about 10AM to make a reservation for 1pm; greeter was friendly; we waited a minute or two after arriving about 10m late and a table was opened.  Tables was configured for 6 people so they had it \"round\" v. \"square\" - which added room -- (Mandarin tables tend to be small -- pack'em in!!!!)  Everyone has raved about the decor - definitely more attractive place than most.  Plates were taken away and water refilled efficiently.  Though they tended to do a bit of swooping (one after the other) as soon as the restaurant thinned out.  Overall friendly staff.  Parking - directly out front but plenty when we went to the south (though they share with a grocery store so sometimes it may be an issue).  Otherwise we had no complaints.  Note: We have no opinion of the restrooms as we didn't visit them."}
{"text":"Good Chinese buffet with many choices. Also lots of non-Chinese dishes. They even offer Peking Duck. Apparently they usually have a special seniors price, although the night  I ate there, they had a special  on for adults which made the two prices the same. Food was good,although some of the chicken dishes seemed a bit drier than they should have been."}
{"text":"Honestly, the best damn Chinese buffet I have ever been to. Bar none. Also, live show!  The food selection was large, the service was crazy good. Plates disappeared quickly, new napkins dropped off, and water always refilled quickly.  The five stars are relative and in comparison to Chinese buffets. It is obviously not a high end culinary restaurant, its a Chinese buffet with all the usual buffet caveats. The important thing is, it is the best Chinese buffet I have ever eat at.   I don't understand people that review buffets as if they are a la carte restaurants. Haters will be haters I guess."}
{"text":"First time here. Was way better than mandarin. Food was fresh and well prepared. Not as much selection as Mandarin but the quality puts dragon pearl well beyond. Good service, great food. I would return and highly recommend."}
{"text":"Finally made my way to Dragon Pearl Buffet.....  Lunch for $12.99 is A-OK, as I just could not come here to dinner to pay double the price!  It was quite neat watching the lady making the hand made noodle fresh, though I found the broth itself a little boring.  Skip the Sushi section, as mostly maki and sushi of 2 kinds: surf clams and tofu....  Most of the cooked food I found them a little too salty. I did enjoy the fish: Teriyaki Salmon and Steam Fish Fillet.   Most of the salad are mayonnaise based, I did enjoy the mango salad and seaweed salad which were more refreshing.  The best part of the meal at Dragon Pearl I think is the dessert. Great selections of cakes, Chinese sweets, fresh fruits and ice cream (no sesame ice cream though!)  The services were attentive. Our water glasses got filled constantly and dirty plates got removed promptly. But strangely, the waiter brought me the bill and the hot towels when I was still eating my watermelon and ice cream?! He also kept asking if I need the credit card terminal.... Can't he tell I was still eating and I was planning to go back for another round?!  Decor here is fun and funky... Worth coming once at least for the experience!"}
{"text":"Our party of 4 adults went for a birthday dinner on Dec. 26, 2012 at 6:30pm. The place was pretty full but we were seated right away. The atmosphere is great and the wooden ship decor is super, although the 4 person square tables are pretty tight. Luckily the service was quick (and very pleasant) and our dishes were cleared promptly. It is a busy restaurant so sometimes the service is a bit \"drive-by\" but the servers were all responsive. My favourite part of the restaurant is the sink that is conveniently placed in the middle of the buffet so you can wash your hands after enjoying your 1/2 lobster, without having to go to the washroom. They also serve Peking duck, which is one of my favourite dishes and something I've never seen at any other buffet restaurant. They had a nice selection hot dishes, fresh fruit and tasty desserts, but stay away from the fish balls..... I didn't get to try their noodles that are apparently made fresh in-house but I've heard they are very good. Overall it was an enjoyable evening. Seniors get a 20% discount.  The restaurant is a little tricky to find since it is on York Mills Road but fronts onto a side street and can only be seen when you're driving eastbound on York Mills, but it is worth the drive! I would definitely recommend the Dragon Pearl Buffet."}
{"text":"Restaurant's decor is very nicely done.  If I remember correctly it was done by TED design (not me, sadly).  Food's okay, nothing special or memorable."}
{"text":"Great deco, many good selections of food choices! There are birthday month special if you bring 4 friends. Price is decent for AYCE and can't complain with pekin duck and lobster crawls!"}
{"text":"We visited the Dragon Pearl on Sunday, Feb 3, 2013 @ approx 1:15pm......  As mentioned in some other reviews, this place is massive....wherein lies it's greatest weakness: the volume of people combined with the poor execution of their buffet, results in a long wait time for food.  When I think of Chinese buffet I think of the Mandarin...several stations laid out in a central area where you can access food from either side of buffet tables. A simple concept that works. Here...it is one LONG buffet...accessible from only 1 side...so if you forget something, it's not easy to go back and get it. We saw several instances where people were filling 2 plates at a time....they were commenting on how they were not willing to wait in the buffet line a 2nd time...and they are correct. The line for food extended back into the dining area...it is just not a good idea to have only 1 line for people to look at food, decide if they want that food, put their plate down, add what they want, pick their plate up, move on to the next item. The design of their buffet really works against them. From the time we got in line to the time we actually got to where the food was took over 10 minutes..then to go through the line took just as long...10 minutes (not including the sushi station or dessert station) ....a 20 minute endeavour for a buffet. This time frame is just NOT acceptable for a buffet.   As there were 2 women in our group, we volunteered to watch their purses while they went and got their food, then we went up when they returned. This makes dining together as a group impossible. When they got back with their food (15 minutes later) and we went up, returning 20 minutes later, had they had waited for us, their food would have been cold. So the way it worked is they went up..came back and ate while we were up, then we came back and ate while they went up again, etc, etc. This is the same way it works at the Mandarin, but there, at least, the buffet is accessible and better laid out, so you can actually eat together as a group. Here it was NOT possible. The only portion of the meal we ate together was dessert...and this was because we sent one person up to get a plate for the table.  The food itself is not worth the wait time. I would suggest going elsewhere for better food and better quality.  The service was very good.  One additional complaint.....we ordered Jasmine tea and they brought out a pot of it....but their policy is to charge $2.29 per person to those who drink it. You would think that a pot of tea would be a flat price for the table. To be fair, the waitress did advise us this was their policy...I just think it's odd that it's not a flat price.   I will NOT go back to this restaurant and will NOT recommend this restaurant to friends."}
{"text":"Last time I was at this place was for my mom's birthday a few years ago.  This place is still as great as the first visit.  Its is Saturday and the best of the best was out.  Lobster, roast beef, great sushi bar, plenty of seafood options, large salad bar, ice cream, Peking duck, dim sum and more.  The service was very good, there was always someone collecting our plates and refilling our drinks.  The replenishing of the buffet items quickly and the freshness applied to all items.  This place is the perfect restaurant to have a gathering as the decor was nice and spacious.  I love the chairs!  Weird but the design looked like an emperors chair.  Ready to book the next family dinner here!"}
{"text":"Parents beware! Check pricing before you go. I didn't check the price for my 11 months old and got charged toddler pricing 2.99$ for her eating a piece of orange and some tofu."}
{"text":"If you like the Mandarin Buffets then you must check out this place. It puts the Mandarin to shame with a great quality food buffet, inspired Asian decor and fast friendly service. Try it and see of you agree..."}
{"text":"This restaurant looks very nice.  The ambiance is great for a buffet.  The food is good especially the yum tom soup.  I recommend this place to come for a friends birthday."}
{"text":"Over priced for what you actually get. Because of the price, decor, and lobster I thought it might be a good Chinese buffet but..... what you get in terms of food and selection it is almost like going to Pacific Mall food court. Many cheap quality dishes you can find anywhere. The only better food was actually their sushi bar. The lobster....you need a ticket and you only get one.... that is half of one with no claws so it is really half a tail of meat. Being mass produced the lobsters were way over cooked and taste tough.   The layout of the stations seems a little confusing, food just seems to be everywhere without a good order of where you should start.   The decor: they spent a lot of money there maybe they should have spent some of it back to the food. There is a lot of details to the decor everywhere maybe a little too much. The chairs for example was too much. They were trying to capture the theme with big wooden chairs but the center of gravity was too high and back that once you try to push back on it and overcome the friction of the tiles that it is catching on, the chair wants to tip over.   I have also been doing a lot of contruction lately (bare hand handling a lot of lumber) so my hands are pretty immune to wood splinters but surprisingly I got a pretty big splinter from their furniture...."}
{"text":"I am not a big fan of buffets. But this place was amazing. It was a Thursday night in August and we had reservations. Thursday night dinner comes with a live show called Chinese Face Change. More on that later. ..  The food: the buffet is HUGE. lots to choose from. The highlights: stations included: prime rib, Peking duck w/the pancakes, sushi, hand pulled noodle soup, hibachi grill and of course the usual buffet faire. Big dessert selection as well. The ice cream in the tubs scared me a bit so I stayed away.  The guy slicing the duck was tossing away the legs. What?? I wanted it. I asked for one and he sliced off a couple for me with lots of meat attached. YUM.  That alone,for me, was worth going for sure. Dinner was $26 Canadian (roughly $20 US decent exchange rate)  Service: was quite attentive. Our waiter was super friendly and cracked jokes with everyone. Clearly he enjoyed working there.  So I mentioned the show. Thursday nights only. The performer dons traditional Chinese dress on stage and his face changes (masks) as he does his moves. We didn't know about the show ahead of time so that was quite a bonus for us.  They have weekly specials the other days of the week. Oysters /crab legs/ lobster on certain nights.  If it's your birthday that month = free dinner for birthday person.  They can accommodate large parties and sell trinkets & things for those needing a last minute gift.   If you are in the greater Toronto area - give this place a try  - there might be more than one location."}
{"text":"It's just ok! The roast fatty on special occasions instead of making it special they cheapen quality! Food temperature cold! That concerns me knowing food handling requires temp hot or cold and sustain without dropping for more than 40 mins! Not sure if I'd go back! Sitting area is nice but noisy! Service ok"}
{"text":"We came here for my husband's birthday. It used to be a great place to eat, but I found that this time around, it wasn't as good. There is a lot of seating thankfully, and the decor is not bad, however, we found the food quite stale and not fresh. Most of the chinese food and fried items seemed to be sitting there for a while. There were a few good items, like the Peking duck station, and hand cut noodle station as well were good. They made the noodles from scratch and cut it with a machine, and then you can choose the broth. The fruits were quite sweet as well, and I was surprised that they had Dragon fruit. However, the majority of the food was ok, reminded me of a fast food restaurant quality food such as Manchu Wok. The waiter was attentive, but I found that people were not as friendly as well. The highlight (The dragon Pearl ball) was not longer there this time around! I remember that many years ago, they made a large Pearl ball behind a glass window and we found it really cool. The sashimi and sushi selection wasn't bad either, but the rice was a bit tasteless as well, and the fish not super fresh. The beef rib was very very tasty though, and the shrimps at the noodle bar very fresh. They provided a booster seat for my son as well."}
{"text":"Good pricing Good service Good variety on the buffet  Good experience overall.  No complaints"}
