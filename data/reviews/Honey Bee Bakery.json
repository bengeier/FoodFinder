{"text":"$10 for a dozen French macaroons is an impossible find, unless you get them at the grocery store frozen. The quality, freshness and selection of this bakery has me in awe. The location is perfect in Medina Square historical district, what can't be more perfect?"}
{"text":"A great new place to satisfy your sweet tooth and get your caffeine fix!  The cookies are every bit as good as my dear sweet Grandma used to make.  Very friendly and courteous staff makes it even better!"}
{"text":"By far the best bakery in the area. The cookies are creative, decorated to perfection, and delicious. French macarons are my favorite (and difficult to master), and I've honestly never had a more perfect macaron in my life. Go here. Buy everything she has, and then go back for seconds. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I was so excited when Honey Bee opened. I've enjoyed every item I have tried here....especially the vegan frosted sugar cookies!  The prices are reasonable, and they do the cutest decorating on cookies and cakes that I have ever seen. It's very impressive!"}
{"text":"Everything is great here! Everyone is super friendly and helpful. My new favorite spot in Medina!"}
{"text":"I heard about this place and how they have a great selection of vegan pastry items on Wednesdays. I came at about 1pm, they were a little low on vegan items however I had a vegan chocolate cupcake and it was PERFECT!!! I also had a soy macchiato, the woman behind the counter was so friendly and patient with me, since this was my first time. 
They have a cozy seating area where you can watch the cars and clouds go by for hours. I cannot believe that I haven't been here sooner! I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Bought 2 dozen cookies from here for a work event and they were a huge hit! The cookies were so delicious and so well decorated! We will be sure to be back for a birthday cake in November!"}
{"text":"The first cake was our \"ideal\" cake, the second was our theme cake and the third was what we received. Not exactly what we felt was fitting for an 8 year old. When I called HBB they immediately offered a refund for our troubles and were very sincere in their apologies. Kindness goes a long way and we will most definitely come back."}
{"text":"There is nothing about this place I don't like. Super friendly people and a wide variety of delicious bakery and tasty drinks to choose from. Thank you for doing what you do Honey Bee Bakery!"}
{"text":"We ordered a cake for my wedding and although it was delicious I was really disappointed in the appearance. I sent the exact picture of the decorations I wanted, they even had a copy work them at the venue, but it was SERIOUSLY lacking. I wanted it garnished with fruit and flowers. It was a naked cake so they didn't even have to Frost like a traditional cake. For the amount I paid I expected a more accurate delivery of product."}
{"text":"I love this place so much! I love having a vegan bakery so close to my home. Located in the heart of the medina square, this cute little bakery has some of the best desserts and coffee options. They have a wide variety of desserts to select from that change daily. Make sure you try their lemon bars, macaroons, m&m cookies, and brownies. They also do custom baking which I can't wait to order for all my wedding festivities this summer!"}
{"text":"Honey Bee Bakery is by far my absolute favorite place in Medina to grab a cup of tea or coffee and sit to enjoy delicious baked goods made from scratch! The owner, Keni, is super friendly and strives to make each and every one of her customers have the best coffee experience possible.

The set up of the shop is very laid back, inside a multi-local business building with an excellent view of the Medina Square. The staff are friendly and everything tastes delicious!"}
{"text":"Always helpful staff and delicious treats. I highly recommend their lemon squares when available!"}
{"text":"The vegan brownies are the best I've ever had - and I've had a lot. This place is a gem."}
{"text":"Keni the owner is amazing! She went above and beyond on a special order. I know the family was touched by her baked goods and the love she brings to her business! 

Thank you! She also ships, and will definitely order again!"}
{"text":"I didn't know about this place- but glad I stumbled on it when walking the square!  All the bakery looked \"bee\"utiful, but my family and tried the macaroons- my favorite!!!  They were just how a macaroon should be with the combination of crunchy and chewy!  

It was nice to see they had things labeled gluten free.  My sister had hot chocolate and she said it was really good.  Will definitely be back here next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Saw they have vegan pastries and had to try it! I got a brownie, cupcake, and cookie sandwich and WOW best vegan desserts I've found! The brownie and the cupcake are so creamy and moist they melt in your mouth. Prices are very reasonable. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"There are two things that stand out to me at Honey Bee Bakery: The vegan variety and the bread. 

The vegan pastries range from scones to cupcakes to cookies. Both the scones and cupcakes were flavorful and not the least bit dry while the cookies were chewy which is my personal preference.

For bread they make bread in house fresh each day. I love the baguette and the rustic loaves. Both had great air pockets and a nice crunch on the outside.

I've brought family here for the desserts and we never left disappointed. Even if you're not vegan, the pastries are some of my favorite that you can find in Medina. 

If you're looking for bread or pastries and are in Medina, definitely make the trip here to check it out."}
{"text":"This place is the bee's knees! I'm a bee and honey fan, so I think the decor is adorable. I stopped in this afternoon and ordered the Milk & Honey (espresso, milk, and honey) and sipped it while sitting in a rocking chair near the window. The honey was just enough to sweeten the espresso without being too sweet or overpowering the taste of the espresso. I would order it again. 

The bakery was staffed by three women and they were all friendly. The bakery case has an assortment of treats from sugar cookies to kolachy to macarons to biscotti and much more. This would be a great place to meet a friend and sit for a chat or grab a drink and a snack before walking around the square. 

I did wish that the drinks and treats had listed prices (maybe I just missed a sign?), but that would be my only suggestion at this point!"}
{"text":"In the act of full disclosure, I'll admit that the owner of Honey Bee Bakery is a longtime friend of mine. I say this to note that I am being as honest and unbiased as possible in sharing this review. To be fair, it might be difficult to find folks in Medina who don't know Keni, the owner. She is a veritable treasure to the city of Medina, and her bakery venture adds so much charm and value to the historic town square. 

All that aside, this bakery is absolute genius at making customized orders. I can't think of anything they wouldn't be able to do. You want a Star Wars cake in the shape of a light saber? Sure. You think a vegan red velvet would rock your birthday party? Done. You just want a cute honey bee hive cookie to make your day? Of course! If want Pinterest level baked goods, this is the place to find it. 

I decided to order some sugar cookies for a friend's bachelorette party. I simply mentioned the words Jane Austen, and Honey Bee whipped up the most beautiful and personally crafted cookies I've ever seen. Not only did the cookies impress everyone at the party with the hand written icing script and gorgeous color scheme, but everyone loved how soft the cookies were. They were the perfect balance of icing and cookie. 

Of course the bakery itself is full of it's own charm as well; there's some lovely seating options right by the window, and the bakery is accented with thrifted and antique materials, giving it a custom feel among the Victorian same-ness on Medina square. I would highly recommend trying out ordering something from this bakery for your next event... you're sure to impress others and you'll love how tasty the results are!"}
