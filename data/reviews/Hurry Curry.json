{"text":"Tasty samosa. What you get in your dish seems to depend on who is serving you. The samosa chaat made by the woman behind the Indian side was great. Samosa chaat made by the woman behind the Mexican side was messy and unfocused. I didn't want to be asked about every ingredient in it, I just wanted a meal made by someone who knew what it was.
The Mexican poutine is a wonderful thing however. If you ever wanted a fries supreme from Taco Bell but do not want to punish yourself, get the Mexican poutine. Generous amount of fries, cheese and toppings. I haven't had a burrito there but I saw someone walk out of there with one and it was the size of her head. Promising."}
{"text":"Ordered from the Tacorrito...I ordered a burrito bowl, and though it was a full bowl, it was way too salty. In addition, the \"chicken\" tasted and felt very inauthentic...kind of too sketchy for my preferences. Service was good. Either get rid of the Tacorrito, or fix the salt and use real meat in your food."}
{"text":"If you are interested in a bowl of sauce with three pieces of meat and the salad thrown on top of the sauce then you might like it. It is also hit or miss how warm the curries and dishes are. 
The seating at the back however is nice for a fast food location. 
They share the space with Tacorito which is the better value and consistency."}
