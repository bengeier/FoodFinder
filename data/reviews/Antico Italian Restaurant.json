{"text":"Though they have been opened less than a week, we have a new go-to for NY style pizza in the area.  I had high expectations for this place and they did not disappoint.  Fresh dough was fantastic and the toppings were great.  Ranch was sensational as well.  We will certainly be back often."}
{"text":"Outstanding! This is the best Italian restaurant in the area. Great food! Great service! And, they offer very tasty gluten free options. We can stop dining at Il Bosco in Davidson. Il Bosco has great food but surprisingly poor service."}
{"text":"Food was great especially for the price. It's a great Italian place to have in Huntersville."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch and dinner! I hate to give a review, this place needs to remain a secret. Great food and you don't leave there hungry with their large portions..."}
{"text":"The most delicious Italian food in Huntersville.  Small quaint restaurant with wonderful service.  Gets very busy on the weekends and they don't take reservations but will take call aheads."}
{"text":"Fantastic date night dinner!  Husband ordered the seafood pasta special, loaded with mussels (the large oval plate was lined all the way around), calamari, shrimp and salmon.  Everything was perfectly cooked and seasoned.  I had the Veal Saltimboca - it was also cooked and seasoned to perfection.  We had a lovely conversation with Joy, the hostess and felt very welcomed.  For dinner, it might be nice to have cloth napkins and have the music turned down a bit to allow for easy conversation.  Would also be super to have a local beer option. The food here is top notch (and I don't say that lightly) and well worth being patient.  I've lived in the area for 13 years and have never had Italian as delicious and well-presented. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"I went back and I do believe it was even better. Service was great and the food was wonderful."}
{"text":"The food and service were both excellent. I'm so excited to have a great Italian restaurant in Lake Norman!"}
{"text":"Antico  was very tasty and fresh. The atmosphere is very hip and comfortable. Server knew how to guide us and answer our questions. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I had the pesto capellini with chicken. The chicken was great and so was the pesto but they put a loootttt of pesto sauce on the pasta, just a little too much for me. They bring you some bread while you wait for your food and that was pretty good."}
{"text":"Looked up this place on yelp and my fiancé and I decided to give it a try. BEST Italian food around! Cannot beat the marinara sauce. My fiancé had the special that night, lasagna. I had the spaghetti. Went home stuffed and with food to spare! We will be back for sure! It is very small, I see them having to move to a larger location soon, due to the quality! Also, we did go in hopes to try the pizza, which they don't serve anymore. But no need for pizza!! Once again, best authentic Italian around!!!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic pizza. New go-to restaurant for quality Italian food. Service was remarkable as well."}
{"text":"Service was insulting enough such that I couldn't be a repeat customer, despite how delicious and value-priced the food was. I sat for 20 minutes trying to get the attention of their waitstaff. They all ignored me as if I was invisible, or a leper. When the party of 25 finished dinner and left, I thought it was my chance to finally get the check and leave. Another ten minutes passed by continuing to be ignored, despite raising my hand, yelling out excuse me. Some servers and a casually dressed lady (manager? owner?) made eye contact with me during this process but wouldn't acknowledge my request for service. When I finally received my check, the checkbook sat standing on the table ready with the credit card for ten minutes before it was run. The host lady provided me a to-go box without a bag and disappeared. I yelled out to a server for a bag, but he ignored me. It was bizarre. I was dressed in pressed office clothes and ate neatly. I couldn't understand why.

That weeknight I called in to place an order ahead of time as I was short on time. The host lady doubled as a server because they had a 25 person table (Fordham's women's soccer team arrived for dinner). The kitchen and service team busted to handle the workload. My gnocchi and baseball-sized meatball side came out within about fifteen minutes after seating (great). I was provided a bread basket but didn't realize that their refrigerated pats of butter were hidden at the bottom of the basket."}
{"text":"I love that Huntersville has this non-chain Italian restaurant. The dining area is very small, and we've been quoted with a two-hour wait some times. The bread they serve is delicious. I have ordered both eggplant dishes. They were both good, but I liked the gnocchi better. The serving sizes are big enough to take home left overs. It would be nice if they would throw in a side salad. The prices are on the high side for just an Italian entree.  My children really like the kids' spaghetti.  The kids meal is not expensive, but the portion is very small for eight years old and up."}
{"text":"Had the salmon with artichoke and pesto! It was most delicious. Asked for extra bread to dip up the pesto sauce. The plate was clean when I was done.
Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Do you love calamari? Antico has the best!!! Get the calamari with shrimp. This is our favorite dish at our favorite restaurant."}
{"text":"With the great atmosphere of an old time Italian restaurant and the modern look of a upscale Italian restaurant this restaurant's sauce and fabulous Italian delights are just what the Food critic doctor would order in the Lake Norman area to cure any homesick Italian food with drawl's you may be having.  Your greeted with a family familiar smile and seated with a menu of wide varieties in pastas, sauces and seafood to complement the wonderful Italian bread basket you will receive while waiting for lunch or dinner to arrive. Their meatballs and Chicken Parmesan are as good as it gets in the area.  They have done little advertising so their business has been brisk and by word of mouth-this will change soon.  They have recently expanded their lunch menu with mouth watering Italian sandwiches.  The wait staff is very excited to make all of your eating dreams come true-sit back and enjoy the food journey."}
{"text":"Long wait but we'll worth it. Very attentive staff, food was fabulous and owners were very apologetic about wait. We are NY transplants so we can be very picky about food. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"By far the best little Italian place around! It's like a hidden gem, really. I've only lived in the area for a year and a half and was thrilled to find this place. The crazy thing is that it's right next to Mickey & Mooch (which everyone knows about) BUT when I ask people if they've ever been to Antico's, it's almost always a NO! I've turned quite a few people on to this restaurant because I'm so impressed with every single thing I've gotten. The thing I love the most (that I get every time I go, and will continue to do so) is the fried mozzarella appetizer ... soooooo good! I've literally never been disappointed. Always better than I expect, EVERY.SINGLE.TIME!"}
{"text":"Loved it! Very pleasant atmosphere, great service, our meals were absolutely delicious, and the portions were generous for the price. Had lunch here today after seeing an article about Antico in a local magazine. Definitely glad to discover authentic Italian in a charming, non-chain restaurant in Huntersville!  Looking forward to returning."}
{"text":"Omg,  the baked salmon is life-changing!! So good, and an awesome portion of fish,  veggies, and pasta. 
The mussels were a hit,  even with my 3 and 5-year-old!"}
{"text":"We loved this place. Alfredo and Calamari were spectacular. Wonderful portions, good staff and owners son was very sweet. Hope to return often."}
{"text":"My husband and I come here about a couple of times a month.  The service is great.  The food is delicious.  The restaurant is very nice and clean.  Very nice outdoor seating in front of a pond as well.  We have tried a bunch of their meals and they are all delicious.  The chicken cacciatore & chicken parm are probably my favorite!"}
{"text":"Had a fantastic eggplant parmesan for lunch. It was super indulgent, with ricotta tossed into the mix. Some tasty warm sliced bread came out first then the main meal. I really shouldn't have eaten it all but I couldn't help myself. The staff was super attentive (though I may have been the only customer at the time - I sat outside so I'm not sure) and very friendly. 

This place is pretty new and could use more patronage to support it - go check it out if you're around! (sadly I'm from out of town so I can't...)"}
{"text":"We had 4 adults and 2 children for dinner on opening night.  We had the Rigatoni Antico, Fettuccine with Chicken, Rigatoni Melanzane, Spaghetti alla Contadina and pizza.  Excellent service, large portions, authentic italian food and great atmosphere.  Delicious italian food in Huntersville finally!"}
{"text":"We have been to this restaurant several times. It is absolutely fabulous! The manicotti is great, the pizzas are great, the salmon is exquisite! I love the atmosphere and all the windows it's bright and cheery but cozy and romantic all at the same time. The waitstaff is above average as everyone here makes sure your wine glasses are full and your water glasses are as well. The owner walks around and checks on the tables as you eat. He is from Italy and speaks Italian. I Traeleigh love the effort that all the staff text and to each meal here. This is our family's favorite place!"}
{"text":"We visited for the second time.  It was very busy but fortunately was seated rather  quickly.  Our table was terribly small but considering we were hungry we weren't complaining haha.  Again my husband had Veal Saltimbocca which waa delicious.  I had the Eggplant entree that was ok.  It was swimming in sauce which was too much but still very good.  Service was impeccable.  My only complaint would be having to ask for more bread because we were only served one roll per person each time.  Otherwise I waa pleased once again."}
{"text":"Im not a big fan of Italian food but I really like this place. 
The food it's actually pretty good, it's just really over priced."}
{"text":"Bread- very good! 

Cesar salad- omg good!!! Loved the Cesar dressing. Ranch was good, but not amazing. 

Fettuccini Alfredo- light sauce- loved it!!! 

Penne ala vodka with no pancetta- the red onions were over powering and there were tons of them. We both didn't really like it. They were so nice they took it off the bill and asked if we wanted anything else. Update: my friend had a tummy ache after."}
{"text":"Just had a fantastic meal here...our first visit...highly recommended! Best Italian food in Huntersville and the owner/chef cooks better than my nana...lol!  Bon appetite!"}
{"text":"What a fantastic place to eat. Service was great food was amazingly good. We plan to revisit this place many more times to come. ."}
{"text":"5 stars are saved for special dinners and really hard to compete with.  Service is a tad slow, so don't go to sit down if your in a rush.  We had time and the meal was worth the wait. This was a very good meal, easy atmosphere, very clean and fresh.  My husband and I shared a chopped Antipasto salad and dined with a chicken piccata and salmon with artichoke hearts.  Both meals were in light sauce, not greasy like some of the previous posts had stated.  We will definitely be back with our kids.  So happy that we now have local good Italian food."}
{"text":"Very small but very cute \"hole in the wall\" place. This may have been the best Italian I've ever gotten at a restaurant! We had a long wait since it was Valentine's Day weekend but it was worth the wait! Will definitely be returning! Awesome addition to Huntersville!"}
{"text":"An absolute gem! There is no Italian restaurant that can come close to Antico in the Lake Norman area. Every dish is layered in flavor, comfort and quality ingredients. A truly authentic experience. Highly recommend the Rigatoni Antico."}
{"text":"This is probably the top 3 Italian place in Charlotte. Great ambiance and absolutely amazing food, we will be back."}
{"text":"I have only been to Antico for lunch, but they are always fairly quick and service is great. The food is very good, but the prices might be a little too high for the casual ambience. 

Definitely can't go wrong with the chicken parm sandwich, and the shrimp Alfredo is always ordered by someone at the table."}
{"text":"When one thinks of Huntersville, NC it does not exactly feel as the abode of an authentic family owned Italian restaurant serving up one of the best tasting marinara ever! This place is super busy on weekends and since they don't take reservations it is always hard to go here in large groups. However, the staff is super friendly and will happily serve up beers and wine with a fun filled conversation in the lobby while you wait. The wait is worth it. The Mozzarella in Carrozza comes drenched in their all so yummy marinara. This is a dreamy concoction that can be best described as just loads of flavor in each bite where the fresh mozzarella blends with the crunchy texture of the bread and the tangy marinara that has the natural sweetness of vine ripened tomatoes. You will want to get that plate clean with the fresh bread they have at the table which is a nice good hearty crusted loaf with a tender white inside. My personal favorite is the Pollo Parmigiana with substituting the angel hair pasta for fettuccine Alfredo. They put on a big smile to accommodate changes. If you are in for a sweet tooth, then their cannoli's are authentic and fresh, and they are Italian sized. None of that wannabe dessert size here. The penne ala vodka is equally delectable, the sauce is simply unique and if you are a vodka sauce fan then theirs is definitely very zesty and flavorful. Love this place and the folks who run it. Always smiling and always cheerful. I think a ton of love goes into the food they serve, I always see people leaving with big grins and just amazed that this little place exists in our neighborhood."}
{"text":"After searching on their website and Facebook, I wasn't able to find a way to send a message to the owner/manager without having to call.

Last night was the strangest dining experience my boyfriend and I had ever had - we sat down outside at 7:00pm and had some drinks and an appetizer and ordered our entree all at the same time. Two tables were sat outside after us and received drinks, appetizers, entrees, had paid and left. We had been there at this point for about an hour. Several people walked outside to refill our waters but didn't say much about how we had kind of been forgotten about. After an hour our waitress assured us our entrees would be out shortly - saying the kitchen was backed up from seafood orders - then assured us again 20 minutes later. At this point it was about 8:45 and our entrees had came out - she then explained that our ticket had been blown around the kitchen and had been lost - the food was delicious and we would have loved to sit and enjoy it but we had filled up on bread at that point and just wanted to go home. 

We asked for boxes and the check - our waitress knocked over a glass of water on us and was just acting really strange and flustered - which I understand she was probably having a rough night so we tried to be patient. After 10 minutes of waiting for the check she came back out asking if someone had picked up the check for us (like another waiter) and we reminded her that she never brought the check out initially. So we waited a little longer and received a check in which she had charged us for another tables wine. 

I went inside to speak to the manager/owner to explain we had been over charged and that we just wanted to leave. After finally getting everything together it was 9:30pm. We had been here for 2 and a half hours and were never approached by the manager/owner - and I know they were aware of the situation. 

The atmosphere is beautiful and the food seems great - I just wish we were treated better during our first experience and one of the rare times we get out for a date night."}
{"text":"Loved everything about this place. As we entered our greeting was warm and welcoming. We actually didn't mind that we had to wait as the conversation was quite lovely. 
Once we were led into the dining area, we were pleasantly surprised to see such lovely ambiance.
Our server was very nice and helpful. 
All of our dishes delectable. 
This side of Lake Norman has needed good Italian for quite some time and we're happy to have finally found it."}
{"text":"The food was fresh and very enjoyable. Great customer service from the time I walked into the door to leaving after lunch. I definitely will be coming back to try more items off the menu."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Italian I've had here in the Charlotte region. The Gamberi Ripieni {Stuffed Shrimp}, was outstanding as was the Penne alla Vodka my better half had. This will be a regular stop on our dining out list. Very much worth the try and the wait, if there is one; it's a popular place. I see why!"}
{"text":"I rarely give 5 star reviews. These guys deserve it. Friendly service, Mama's recipes and hardy portions. Recommended for the red sauce craving. BTW, if lasagna is on the menu, ORDER IT."}
{"text":"Great food. Completely unexpected from a restaurant on a strip mall, but it's been great every time I go.  The calamari is fantastic and any shrimp and pasta dish is superb.  The service is great as well. I love this place."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem. The food was excellent. We had veal saltimbocca and veal marsala. Also, the cheesecake is amazing as well as the service. We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Stopped on a Saturday evening and the wait was short. The atmosphere was nice. I had the spaghetti with large meatball (Spagetti Rocchese) and it was very good. The wife had a seafood special with large prawns and scallops in a garlic and white wine sauce that she says was delicious! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I love this place so much! The food is always superb..my favorite being the Veal Saltimbocca! We stop in about once a week and enjoy seeing the waiters and hosts that have gotten to know us. I'm the beginning the service was slow but I have noticed there wait staff has improved over time. No where better to eat in Huntersville."}
{"text":"Geeeeze I wanted to like the food but 2/3 of us thought it was simply awful. Super cute place & great location. Inattentive staff (being kind) and their marinara sauce just ruins everything it touches. I would hope it's not but it really tastes like super cheap canned sauce. You know the kind they might serve in school cafeterias. Total bummer!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Antico & absolutely loved it. Growing up in an Italian household in NY, I am very particular/critical about eating Italian food out in restaurants. Antico was the next best to my mom's sauce :) The prices and portions were great. The staff was very friendly, we even had conversations with them as if we were having \"Sunday Dinner\"! I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The staff was nice, we got there for an early dinner around 6 so it wasn't too crowded. We waited almost half an hour for our food which wouldn't have been a huge deal if the meal itself was exemplary. I ordered the special of the night, pesto pasta with shrimp and scallops. After digging in I noticed the pasta was swimming in pesto sauce and the shrimp still had the shell on the tail meaning I had to use my fingers to get it off. After complaining to the manager she said, \"most restaurants do the same thing\". What happened to the customer is always right? We then waiting another 20 minutes for our check at the end of the night. Our waitress then followed us out saying \"I forgot to put the tax on your bill,\" we kept walking. Safe to say I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Best service and Italian food around. Daniella and Joy always make us feel welcomed and taken care of. The seafood is always fresh which is nice and hard to find up in NC(since we moved from the beaches of FL). You can tell that all of the sauces and dishes are homemade and nothing from a can!!

I would highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Great food! Wish they had a bar area...very crowed because the food is great! I think they will be around for a long time and the growing pains will be gone!"}
{"text":"The penne vodka is the best I have had in a long time. I ordered with shrimp and the shrimp were huge! Definitely a great value for what you get. The restaurant Is clean and the service was great. Will definitely be coming back for more."}
{"text":"Husband and I went to dinner on a Saturday night, Antico exhibited great attention to detail. As others stated, they brought out one-bite appetizers as we waited and offered for us to order a drink as we waited for our table. Our wait was about 25 minutes but it flew by as all the staff were so friendly and did an excellent job keeping things moving. Our dinner was excellent and you can tell they take pride in serving their family's homemade recipes. The restaurant is on the smaller side and it's a bit loud due to the number of people in the small space. That being said, We would definitely recommend, just be ready for a bit of a wait if going on a weekend."}
{"text":"This place is excellent great food great service we have been waiting for a good Italian restaurant in the area."}
{"text":"Awesome! We had great service and wonderful food! The bread, delicious. The calamari, wow! The caprese salad, yum. I had the salmon gorgonzola with spinach ravioli. O! M! G! My 6 year old devoured her cheese ravioli. My husband loved the shrimp and scallops. It was a win on all counts! Great little place. We will definitely go back! (Very healthy portions to boot!)"}
{"text":"Steve for the win. Awesome waiter. The food was amazing and the portion was huge. I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Coming from an Italian New Yorker, this place is great. Walking to our table the decor was beautiful, looked like Joanna Gaines was their interior designer. Our server was Johnny, he was fantastic. If we needed something he would get it right away, make sure we were satisfied with the food and was nice to chat with. The bread is delicious, brought to the table warm. My mom ordered the fettuccine Alfredo with shrimp and she said it was thee best Alfredo's she's had. Of course I had to taste it then and she was right, so good! I ordered the Pollo Piccata, very good but strong lemon/capers flavor. My dad ordered pasta with vegetables in a white wine sauce and that was just as good. This place has a warm intimate environment and thoroughly enjoyed eating here. My mom even went to the cook to thank him for a delicious meal. We will be back for sure! Thank you for great service!"}
{"text":"Food great.
Tried something basic spaghetti bolognese. I know it's not a big deal dish but I figured I'd start small. The pasta was al dente  perfect. My wife asked for (not on the menu) linguini with white clam sauce. She's picky and loved it. Came with 12 clams.

Service wonderful!
Our server was a very pleasant young woman named Melissa. She knew the menu and checked out drinks throughout the meal. 

A chef owned restaurant with family roots in Sicily.

Small but nicely decorated, not gaudy. I suggest reservations or go early. This place will see me all the time."}
{"text":"Great Addition to the Huntersville dining Scene,

Tucked away on the opposite side of the parking lot in a small section that also includes Mickey and Mooch and Waterbean Coffee is Huntersville latest addition.

Cusine is a modern twist on Italian Cusine and they do an excellent job with it. Went last night with friends from Ohio and had five great meals. I had Caprese as an appetizer and it was pretty good although would have been better with wine ripened larger Heirloom tomatoes. I was the only one who had an appetizer so I went with just the Spaghetti and Meatball because I assumed in would be a smaller dish. It only had one meatball but that meatball was the size of a baseball. With the Bufo Mozzarella and a tangy marinara, an excellent choice. Their name for it is Spaghetti Rocchese.

My wife had something called a Veal Martino which considering I can not find a description of this style of preparation anywhere else, I assume is a house creation. In any case, very good and she enjoyed it

One of the young ladies from Ohio had the Quattro Formaggi ( 4 Cheese) and loved it while here sister had the Rigatoni Antico which also proved to be a excellent choice. Their mother had one of the specials for the night which is not on the menu which is Chicken and Pasta dish with a Gorgonzola White sauce on top on it. Very flavorful was tasty she indicated.

Service was excellent thorough out the evening. Atmosphere is nice although not as intimate as say Mama Mia at the Holbrook House although dining out side on the patio by the fountain looked very inviting.

It was a very pleasant dinner and we will definitely be back. My wife has already recommended it to two other couples here at the Condo and made arrangements to go back next week with one of our neighbors so she must have really liked it."}
{"text":"My husband and I found this restaurant a few months back. We have been here four times since then. It has been 5 stars every time. Food, service, atmosphere is fabulous!"}
{"text":"Best restaurant in Lake Norman area!!! Mussels are Amazing! Service is excellent, noise level is perfect. Go as soon as you can."}
{"text":"We shared Caprese and Capellini Al Pesto. They were both good and we enjoyed fully. Service was nice too :)"}
{"text":"Food was delicious, it's a very small space which I wasn't fond of exactly . Will go back again, plan ahead there is typically a wait."}
{"text":"Never liked Italian food that much until I ate at Antico. This place is absolutely delicious. They have amazing seafood entrees, my favorite is the Tilapia Piccata; my significant other loves their chicken parm. They have really nice staff that treat you like your family. The antipasto appetizer is to die for. The only reason I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 is due to no reservations. Antico gets very busy on Fridays and Saturdays like most restaurants but it's not the biggest restaurant so the wait it longer than usual. They don't take reservations, one time we waited over an hour and a half for a table. But minus the wait time, its an amazing restaurant that we tell all our friends about. Must try!"}
{"text":"Tiny place, so plan for a wait, but the food was good and prices are reasonable for the quality and quantity."}
{"text":"Very disappointed after reading the reviews. The food was underwhelming, and the service was terrible. I will note that tables with different servers appeared to be getting good service. Maybe our server was just in the weeds with her three tables. Anyway, not impressed and definitely not worth what they charge."}
{"text":"Good, but not great. Went to Antico to try a restaurant different from our go-to spots and had an enjoyable meal but we didn't think it was notable enough to know we would be returning. 

Service was good, flavor was nice, and portions were substantial but there just wasn't anything that made us say \"Let's come back soon!\""}
{"text":"I would not recommend if you only have a short period of time like 1hr lunch however I do agree the food is amazing especially the specials!"}
{"text":"What a great addition to the restaurant scene in north meck. Small and quaint with excellent food. Chicken Marsala is wonderful. Only beer and wine - would be nice to have mixed drinks. Bob & Susan"}
{"text":"Yelpers are in love with this place, great reviews!!!!   But, I an not sure how this spot has consistent 4 and 5 star ratings.   I found it totally mediocre.   Is it better than Olive Garden, absolutely.  Is it better than Carrabba's - not so sure.  I used those chain restaurants as a point of reference.    At prime time, expect a wait.   The place is small.  No bar, so you will have to sit in the reception area, which is also tiny, but there is only one bench, so just stand there.   Speaking of small area, this lends itself to a very loud dinner.  Just saying, if you are expecting an intimate \"date night\" dinner, forget it.

My dinner was the Chicken Marsala.  Not the greatest, not the worst.  Meh, just okay.   Very large portion is a bonus.   My wife went with Chicken Parm.  She liked it, but commented the sauce was average.  My son went with the Shrimp Alfredo, he loved it, but had to add salt and extra grated parm cheese.   What I am getting at, although this is a family owed chain, the sauces are just average.   Nothing earth shattering.  Also, the meals do not come with a salad, that is an upcharge.   The service was okay, they were slammed, she was keeping up."}
{"text":"The food is descent, but for the price it's a little pricey. I don't mind paying for great quality Italian, but this wouldn't be on my top 5 places for sure. The service is ok, I had better service. I hate when my drink gets down to the ice! Especially when the place wasn't even busy to make matters worst."}
{"text":"The first time we went several months ago the food was good. Not great. It's not Italy, or Sicily, but for Lake Norman, which lacks Italian food, it was ok. The last time (Sept 2017) we went the food was disappointing. The noodles were way overcooked. The sauce was very heavy. The entire dish was goopy. If goopy is your thing go for it. My kids meatballs were cold inside. Like cold cold. As cold as my feet. Another item on the kids menu was your typical buy-in bulk frozen chicken and fries. Deep fry. Serve with ketchup. I could do this at home. My wife didn't dig her seafood pasta either. She likes goop more than I like goop, and it was even too goopy for her. The wine was good.  The place was packed. We won't be going again."}
{"text":"The bomb! By far the best Italian not only in the area but perhaps all of Charlotte. I have not found better. I am originally from St. Louis which has the Italian Hill, with everything Italian you can imagine. This place rivals some of my favs there. The only problem, they have about 20 tables and it fills fast. Everything is great, and at a good value for the money. My personal fav is the Veal Saltimbocca.  Truly a go to for some of the best Italian in all Charlotte."}
{"text":"It's our weekly family dinner outing and I have to say Josh and I were surprisingly in agreement that this place is awesome. Our daughter ate all of her dinner which is another rarity.. we will definitely be adding this to our ever growing list of restaurants to visit.  We will be back.."}
{"text":"This restaurant had already been recommended to us by friends. We finally had the opportunity to go. We are glad we did. From the outside the restaurant doesn't look like much. However on the inside the restaurant is very nicely and classy decorated, feeling warm and welcoming. The service was good and fast. We had lunch and both dishes were very good, tasty and well made, aside of having a nice presentation. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, service, food , price. We took a chance and went tonight. I had veal, wife had pasta. Enough food for 4 people, came out hot and very tasty. We will be going back in the future. Give it a try, sure you will be happy also."}
{"text":"We tried Antico for the first time last night and all I can say is WOW!   We have been looking for a good local Italian restaurant in Huntersville and have found it.  When you walk up to the entrance it's very unassuming.   When you enter, you have to do a double take because it is so nice inside.   The food is really good and it was a busy Friday night.   Service was ok but I think it was because it was packed.   

We started with the Caprese salad and was blown away by the size and quality of the selection (see pic).   I had the mozzarella stuffed eggplant with rigatoni (see pic) and my wife had the Antico Special pizza.  Everything was great quality and easily filled us up.   We even had substantial left overs.   

Overall the experience was really good and we are already talking about going back."}
{"text":"I have to start with the staff. Seriously the sweetest staff at any restaurant & very attentive. I hit the shrimp fettuccine alfredo & my husband got the special of the night Zuppa di Pesce that they added lobster tail. Some of the best alfredo I have ever ate. My husband kept bragging about everything & love the white wine sauce that he chose. Pretty safe to say that we'll be going back to this place in the future!!!!"}
{"text":"We tried this place out for a weekday lunch. We had high hopes being from NY and not having many local Italian restaurants in the area. We were not disappointed. 

To start we loved the decor and ambiance of the restaurant. We got our drinks promptly and warm bread brought to the table. You can usually tell if an Italian restaurant is good just by the bread and this place did not let us down. We ordered a chicken parmesan with spaghetti, rigatoni a la vodka with chicken and small pizza. The chicken parmesan was lightly breaded with a nice layer of mozzarella perfectly browned on top - delicious. The rigatoni a la vodka has a perfectly creamy sauce and the pasta was cooked to perfection.  The pizza was a perfect NY style thin crust with just the right amount of sauce and cheese. 

We will definitely be back, this will be our new go to Italian restaurant."}
{"text":"Beautiful clean place with a great atmosphere and great attentive service. We got the mozzarella bread appetizer, the vodka penne with chicken and there was a special - crab cake gnocchi with vodka sauce ... All of it was AMAZING!!!! I'd give it more than 5 stars if I could. You'd never know from the exterior how amazing this place is!!!"}
{"text":"Lots of sauce on my pasta but delicious. Service was great. Space is limited. Pricey Italian food but delicious. They do offer a kids menu. Great sanitation rating."}
{"text":"First time trying this restaurant. Heard great things from friends and it did it not disappoint.  Had the stuffed shrimp and the vegetables were as good as the shrimp. They were not an afterthought or filler. Will be going again!!"}
{"text":"Very pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food. The fettuccine con Panna with chicken and pollo parmigiana were excellent choices for lunch. The bread was surprisingly presliced and a bit toasted which was a bit disappointing though and wasn't presented with olive oil. This is a one room restaurant with some seating outdoors. The service was average. The food is the star at this restaurant. 

Went back a couple of weeks later and the food was not quite as good. I had seafood this time and the entree was a bit undercooked and wasn't hot. The service was also a bit slow and unresponsive."}
{"text":"After being seated about 15 minutes, a waiter finally came over to us. We placed our drink and food order at the same time.  The waiter totally forgot my salad. When the entrees arrived I told the waiter who brought the entrees out. They asked if I still wanted it which I did and they \"comped\" that item. I got a salmon entree which was very good.  Overall we liked our food a lot but our waiter was so slow.  The place is small and each of the wait staff does not have that many tables."}
{"text":"We've been to Antico's a few times. Service is good and our order typically comes out really fast, hot, and tasting fresh. Warning: The portions are ginormous! My husband and I could have easily shared one plate of pasta...when we don't want to share we have leftovers for lunch the next day. Psst...I love the warm bread w/ butter but be careful because it will fill you up fast!"}
{"text":"I must say that this is one of the best Italian Restaurants that I have ever dined at and I'm coming from the Boston mass. area and have dined in the Italian north end section of the city many times.Our waitress was excellent and I wish I caught her name but I know that she originally came from Pennsylvania through conversations.we ordered a bottle of chianti and we ordered the appetizer special which was a stuffed and delicious crab cake and scallops with a sauce that was amazing next came our main course of gnocchi and eggplant with the most delicious red sauce, and I cannot remember the last time I experienced such an amazing delicious sauce.The Italian bread and butter was also very tasty.I will be moving to the area in a few months and I am quite sure that I will be back many more times in the near future."}
{"text":"So this is actually the only Italian Restaurant I have gone to in Charlotte, so I'm a tad hesitant to say it's the best since I haven't really tried any other place. That being said, this place is sooo good it makes me not want to go anywhere else. Mussel appetizer is amazing. Their Alfredo sauce is creamy and delicious. Staff is super friendly and attentive. I love coming here!"}
{"text":"Tried for dinner tonight, food was very good and priced correctly.  Atmosphere was pleasant.  Could well be the best Italian food I've had since moving to Charlotte a few years back.  Will definitely return for another dinner and will try for lunch too!!"}
{"text":"Hands down, one of the best Italian meals I've had! Unique tastes, not like any other restaurant you've tried before. Rich, savory and full of fresh ingredients and bold flavors. Super attentive, friendly, and welcoming staff, from the hostess to the waiter. I need more than five stars. (Ask for Gianni.)"}
{"text":"Great food but oh my gosh be ready for a wait! Came at lunch and the service was terrible! I had to wait 15 min just for my drink. The server kept forgetting the bread. Second time coming and the same service. Not sure we will be back."}
{"text":"So I'm really kind of torn writing this recipe. I visited today and ordered the Shrimp Penne alla vodka. While the pasta is (good) it wasn't a vodka sauce. It tasted and smelled like they used a whoooole lot of chicken stock. It was very overwhelming and even the smell of chicken was overpowering. Strange because I ordered the shrimp. I got it home and added some marinara sauce and parmesan cheese and that didn't help it either. I mean the pasta had good flavor, it just wasn't the flavor I was anticipating. It was rather chicken pot pie ish for lack of a better description. The huge shrimp couldn't even be enjoyed because the shrimp flavor was overpowered. There was also a great deal of chunky ingredients, onions and im assuming bacon. Such a disappointment."}
{"text":"We had some of the best Italian food and desserts followed by cappuccinos highly recommended will eat there again"}
{"text":"This restaurant was close to the hotel we were staying at and decided to try it because of the good reviews. The reviews were right it's a cute little Italian restaurant but decorated modern with the new Gray's which I love. The bread was good the service was good and every Waiter took care of everyone else's table if they were busy. I had stuff shrimp and a side of pasta and vegetables which was very tasty. My husband had chicken fettuccine which he said had a lot of chicken and was extremely good. I wasn't going to have dessert ha ha but they had a lemoncello cake that I had to try. Did not disappoint it wasn't too sweet it was just right. Too bad they're not in our neighborhood I would go there all the time."}
{"text":"The picture is from two times ago when I visited here.
I added sautéed veggies to my garlic cream fettuccine w chicken, it was amazing.  

Saturday when I went I showed the picture to the sweet lady serving us.  And she commented she might have that for lunch! 

I was slightly disappointed this time that the veggies were all way mushy and over cooked.  Not like the picture from last time.

And this was my fault, but last time we ordered the seafood mista app and it was sooo good. Calamari & shrimp  done perfectly, as pictured.  This time I ordered the calamari only forgetting I needed to say mista, to get the shrimp.  It was still amazing, but not what I got last time, so I won't make that mistake again.

Bread  is good, served with butter not olive oil.  Ask for it to come out a little at a time so it stays hot."}
{"text":"Best Penne Allan Vodka I've ever had.... and I've had a lot of different ones! They also have a really cute outdoor patio around back that overlooks a fountain during dinner- something you wouldn't notice just driving by! 

I highly recommend this place- great bread for starters too!"}
{"text":"This is the second time I have been to this restaurant. The first time was almost a year ago and everything was delicious. 
I have to say, tonight, not so much. I had the linguini and clam sauce which was way too salty. My daughter had the chicken piccata... she wasn't thrilled and my son had the penne a la vodka... not great. Honestly, overall, everything seemed way too salty and lacked flavor. The chicken was fairly dry. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"My husband is very particular with Italian food coming from an Italian family with Nonna's cooking. He has been thoroughly impressed with Antico! He believes you cannot order a bad meal here! 

We enjoy the house wines, the bread is great and every meal has been perfect. My husband typically gets the specials or one of the seafood dishes. My favorites include the fettuccine alfredo and pesto pasta. Only downside to this place is the dining room is small so their can be a wait. This doesn't bother my husband as he hopes the place stays small enough so that the quality of the food is consistent."}
{"text":"First time - excellent service & great food. Large portions and a very cute interior. We will be going back!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best Italian restaurant I have been to in a long time.  The chef is imported from Naples and it clearly makes the difference.  I've been to many restaurants in the US as well as in Italy and this has be one of the best and most Italian meals I have had in quite some time. 

The service was great. No reservations, so you may have a wait.. They only have about 50 seats but well worth any wait."}
{"text":"Wonderful and authentic.  The servings are very bountiful.  The food tastes out of this world!!  Love this restaurant!!"}
{"text":"I would say the food is 3.5 stars and the service is 5 stars. Very generous on the seafood, but the flavor and the freshness is not outstanding. In this area my favorite still are Caruso's (Mooresville), Il Bosco (Davidson) and Mama Mia (huntersville)."}
{"text":"We came here for an early dinner(5pm)
It was a warm October day so we opted for the patio. Lovely scenery next to a pretty pond. 
The menu has lots of great selections 
No bar  so we had wine. Not many choices but what we had was good
We ordered the calamari appetizer. It was wonderful. Hot and very!! Lightly breaded. Lemon and marinara sauce 
Plenty to share. 
Bread was dry and server forgot butter
We had to move inside because we were attacked by an army of ants. They handled fairly well. But the manager should have addressed it
As were selecting dinner I asked our server questions about ingredients and how some items were prepared. She didn't have a clue. She was new and not at all prepared. She also reached over me almost hitting my face blocking me   I found that extremely irritating. She could have easily gone around me to the others since the table was round. Bad training!!
  The meals were good
Salads were well dressed and just the right amount  
My chicken piccata was well cooked with plenty of lemon and capers 
The tilapia with seafood stuffing was pretty bland   Ok but not great
The clams with linguine was fresh. 12 little neck clams.  A big hit
Kids had chicken strips with fries. 3 good size pieces
Every dish had pasta and not much else to substitute ( frozen vegetable medley)
Our server was pretty terrible and I would have liked better attention from the management 
Maybe we'll go again but the service is a big part of the experience and that was a fail"}
{"text":"We have eaten here twice since it opened. Both times the food has been wonderful. I love seafood so I've had the shrimp no clams on linguine, and the shrimp diavolo. Both were tasty and very generous portions. 

The only problem with a successful small restaurant is once everyone finds out about it, the wait gets a little long. What was supposed to be 30 minutes ended up being 45.... But the hostess/owner was friendly and apologetic, offering to buy a glass of wine or a beer for the people who had been waiting. 

We don't mind waiting for good food, especially when the staff is so accommodating."}
{"text":"I ordered the veal in lemon sauce with mozzarella, the veal was super soggy and the sauce was overwhelming in the amount and lemon flavor. I didn't say anything given that it was a special occasion I didn't want to complain and I also don't order veal to often. I called later though because a few hours after my stomach was turning and I ended up getting sick all night into the next day. My friend did not. I felt like the management handled it poorly. I was told it's a popular dish and everyone else was fine, I wanted to be reimbursed just for that meal which was 20 dollars I was just offered a desert. I don't feel the food poisoning was taken seriously or how sick I had become."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Everyone is so friendly also. The prices are incredible and they are not shy with their portions. Our office is a few miles away so any celebration or out of town guest we have warrants a visit. It looks and feels like a high class place with great food and music without spending a fortune.

I had the spaghetti and meatballs last week for my birthday. It was delicious. The rest of my guest ordered the special, lasagna with a few ravioli. They talked about how delicious it was for the rest of the week.

I also want to add that I went in for a to-go order today and mentioned we were organizing a raffle for the autism walk coming up. He was so generous in giving us a gift certificate to help."}
{"text":"Antico has found their groove after many months in business.  We've visited a handful of times, and have seen an improvement in both their service and wait times.  What hasn't changed is their delicious food. 

They have changed their bread, and it's much preferred over the prior version.  It's served warm, and is crusty on the outside, and soft on the inside.  This bread is a wonderful way to start the meal.

We've tried their pizza (no longer offered), fettuccini alfredo with shrimp, fettuccini bolognese, penne a la vodka with shrimp, gnocchi sorrentino, and capelllini al pesto with shrimp.  We've enjoyed everything we've tried, but our favorites are the fettuccini bolognese, penne a la vodka, and capellini al pesto.  Their portions are large, and every shrimp dish has the largest and most perfectly cooked seafood.  (Their vodka sauce is also one of the best I've ever had, with little bits of pancetta adding great flavor.)  Prices are very reasonable as well.  

This is a small family owned restaurant, and you'll see the same friendly faces up front and in the dining area.  Service is more efficient than previously, and they offer call ahead seating to help shorten your wait in the lobby, as well as takeout.

We really love this place, and will visit more often now that we know we can call ahead."}
{"text":"My husband and I tried Antico for date night on Wednesday of last week.  We were greeted right away and got a booth without any wait what so ever.  The place was tiny, like 10-15 tables, so the wait time on weekends must be very long.   The decor was very modern yet rustic?  I'm not sure exactly what to call the style, but I liked it a lot.  We both ordered pasta dishes.  I had the antico pasta while hubs had penne vodka with chicken.  The pasta portions were large and presentation was very pretty.  I only ate half of it (yay for lunch leftovers!).  They did not come with a complimentary salad or soup.  My pasta was excellent and so was hubs.  The chicken that he added to his tasted over cooked though.  It was almost as if it was not completely thawed before being cooked or even worse, it was pre-fab chicken strips (GAG). He only took one bite of it and pushed the rest of it to the side so I knew something was wrong because my husband is a carnivore with a capital C.  My husband never speaks up in restaurants because he thinks they are going to do something to the food if you send it back (he watched Waiting one too many times...).  I have no problem saying anything so when the manager/owner came by to help refill drinks and offer a to go box, I mentioned it to her.  She immediately apologized and said they would have remade something for him.  She then promptly offered a complimentary dessert.  I chose the Lemoncello cake because um Lemoncello cake.  It was fabulous!  We chatted with her a little bit and found out that they do not make their own desserts or breads due to their super small kitchen.  They are imported from Italy to a New Jersey based bakery and then sent to NC.  Our waitress was friendly and started off well, but she ended up having six tables at once so we were kind of forgotten about and it took awhile to get our check.  All in all, it was a very nice meal and we will be absolutely go back especially since the manager/owner righted a wrong without batting an eyelash.  On a side note, I think she may be related to the owner of Ciro's in University as their were framed articles about Ciro's on the wall.  Coincidentally, Ciro's pasta dishes do not come with salads or soups as well."}
{"text":"I'm torn on this one! Had some amazing food but the service was just ok! Each time I asked the server for her advice between a few items she suggested random things that I didn't ask about. I didn't ask about the mushroom ravioli or seafood pasta because I don't eat seafood or mushrooms! It was kind of bizarre. Regardless the bolognese was Devine as was the calamari!!! Wine choice is slim but was able to fine something I enjoyed!!"}
{"text":"Great Italian but TOO small! Have to wait for a long time with no bar and no where to wait."}
{"text":"It's not as good as it appears. I'll start with the positives:

-- Extremely clean
-- Superb decor
-- Music and lighting add to the atmosphere perfectly
-- Comfortable seating
-- Good bread 
-- Not too much ice in the soda
-- Good (not great) sauce
-- Friendly service
-- Good Caesar salad

Negatives:

-- SLOW service
-- Mushy/greasy salmon (needed to be sent back)
-- House balsamic vinaigrette was not good
-- No pop at all for Chicken Parmesan (boring)

It would seem as though the positives outweigh the negatives, but if you look closer, the salmon and Chicken Parmesan were our main courses. Add SLOW service and it was not an enjoyable experience. Unfortunately, we will not be returning. 

If you do choose to visit, you might want to stick with pasta dishes. It seems as thought that's their strength."}
{"text":"This is an amazing restaurant. The food is outstanding. A hidden gem. I love to go there for lunch. I've been there multiple times and have never been disappointed. The place to go with family and friends!"}
{"text":"Always try the specials!  the chefs there do amazing work and some of these entrees have blown my mind!   The food is as authentic as it can be the chefs are from Italy.   Seafood dishes are so fresh.  The pasta and sauces are always perfection.  I'll always recommend the lemoncello marscapone cake for dessert.   If you haven't been there yet you have no idea what you're missing."}
{"text":"I'm from Philadelphia so I'm used to eating really good food, so finding an authentic Italian restaurant in the heart of Huntersville was a plus. I now live in Miami but never miss a opportunity to eat here when I come back to NC. The food is super delicious and the staff even better! 
Love this place! 
P.S.- We went Mickey and Mooch after dinner and headed to the bar for some live music and dancing. It's right around the corner!"}
{"text":"Love love love this restaurant!  Food was authentic and wonderful.  Everyone was soooo nice!  Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Wow. The restaurant is beautiful. Very clean, cozy and a touch of modern elegance. The staff is great! They are always friendly and nice. The food is great and like my husband says \"it never disappoints.\" We always leave satisfied! I absolutely recommend this place if you want a great and satisfying meal!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time this weekend and loved every minute of it. The experience was amazing. Everyone was so friendly and down to earth. And THE FOOD! We had fried calamari, chicken parm, and shrimp and clams in wine sauce. All so, so delicious. I cannot wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and service!! Glad to have such a fine well priced Italian restaurant at the lake."}
{"text":"so far the best Italian place we have tried. The portions just right and it tastes like a homemade sauce.  I had the chicken cutlet and it was super good. I would love to see eggplant Parm on the menu. They have a very decent house wine that will not break the bank . Will be back for sure"}
{"text":"Love it when the owner is there to greet you! 
Food is delish! Small and comfortable spot."}
{"text":"This is a family owned restaurant call me and you can definitely feel like family once you step in the door. The portions are huge, the servers are friendly, and overall the food is delicious. 

We have been here quite a few times, and never had a bad experience. Depending on when you come, you could have a long wait to be seated, but that shows how delicious this place is.

We don't really venture into anything too crazy at Italian restaurants (why ruin a good thing), so I can't speak to their specialty dishes. Their calamari is wonderful, the bread is flaky and the crust is just right. 

On one particular visit, we have had some seafood dish where the muscles were not very fresh, and it also took nearly 30 minutes to come out. We actually had thought they forgot about the dish it took so long! No one said anything about it so we didn't mention it.

Really that's the only time I can remember feeling disappointed in Antico. We definitely will come back at some point when we're craving Italian food!"}
{"text":"My wife and I had two plates of pasta, and I had a softdrink.  The bill was over thirty dollars.  Not worth it for pasta from a box.  Top that off with service that was mediocre at best and a very limited menu, and that equals \"I won't go back.\"  I usually give a restaurant a second chance if food is bad, but in this case I'll refrain simple because it wasn't worth the money.  There are better Italian restaurants around with much lower prices."}
{"text":"Yep, we found another treasure today!!  Plan on returning over and over again until I taste EVERYTHING on this menu!! The service was incredible the food was to die for! What could I ask for, give me more Italian food!  This place is everything you want in a neighborhood restaurant but were afraid to ask for."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place. Took daughter for her birthday. Food was ok. Nothing amazing. Staff was super friendly and welcoming. Atmosphere is mediocre...it is in a strip mall. Portion size was very large. I would have to enjoyed smaller portions at a more reasonable price. The food was not good enough to pay that much for."}
{"text":"We had lunch here for the first time today and it was wonderful. We both had a small caesar salad that was delicious. Creamy with a moderate but not overwhelming anchovy flavor. I had the Pollo Marsala and it was the best I've ever had. Often Marsala sauce is thick and heavy, like gravy, whereas this was light and full of flavor. I loved it! My husband had the Pollo Capricciosa, which is a heavy and delicious cream sauce. We switched plates about 2/3 through and we both loved both dishes. 

The decor is very nice. It has a light, modern feel. Good details. 

We couldn't have asked to have been taken care of better. Friendly, fast and never waiting for anything. 

We'll be back very soon!"}
{"text":"My wife and I came here just to try something new and very happy we found this place.  As far as location, well between Harris Teeter, Lowe's the bank we are in the area almost everyday.   The resutrant is very clean and the decor is very simple with classic black and white photographs adorning the walls.  The service Is very professional and the waiter listens and offers appropriate recommendations.  The food is perfectly prepared, they do not have a massive menu - which insures freshness.  Definitely someplace I will return to."}
{"text":"Came for lunch and it was delicious! I would recommend this place to anyone. Will def be returning. We had a group of 5, great service, great prices. Chicken parm for $10, great desserts. This will def be one of my go to places for Italian."}
