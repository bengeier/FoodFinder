{"text":"Not from the Madison area but was recently in town for the Marquette/Madison basketball game (Go Marquette!!!). After a disappointing loss and one too many standard drinks at the bar the night before, I wanted to get back to Milwaukee as quickly as possible the next morning. Much to my chagrin, one of the friends that I stayed with demanded that we get brunch at this fine establishment. I wasn't particularly hungry but ordered the two poached eggs with prosciutto, toast and a Bloody Mary (still trying to drown out the pain of defeat). Absolutely perfect. Food was delicious, portion was just what I was looking for and the plating was adorable!! The Bloody Mary tasted incredibly fresh as well! Needless to say, the meal had awoken my spirits and seemed to say, \"hey there, that marquette loss isn't the end of the world, THINGS ARE GOING TO BE OK.\" Wonderful establishment, pay them a visit as soon as you possibly can."}
{"text":"So I'm obviously very much a latecomer to the Marigold scene, but I do have to comment on a couple of this cute restaurant's offerings.  The red cabbage slaw is maybe the best substitute for a side of chips to go with your sandwich like, really, forever.  It's a tangy vinegar slaw, rather than mayonaissey sweet.  A perfect sprinkling of caraway, and hmm... is that cumin?  Crisp, crunchy, savory & sour.  The open-faced tuna melt was also brilliant.  Bread-&-butter pickles instead of relish -- so simple, yet so good.  But God, I love that slaw!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast option! It's not the cheapest place, but the food more than makes up for it. I had the chorizo and corn salsa omelette, which was one of the best I've had. My friends tried other types of omelettes and the breakfast scramble. Everyone loved the food! The atmosphere is nice too, and they had a few spaces to sit outside. The one thing we had to get used to was the ordering and seating. Where we are from you get seated and then you order. We discovered a few restaurants in Madison that have you order first and then sit down. It's a bit confusing when the place is busy because you don't know if there will be a place to sit after you order. However, that is just an observation, and the only thing that really matters to me is the quality of the food. In this case, it is amazing! I could eat that chorizo omelette everyday."}
{"text":"Outstanding little gourmet cafe, just off the Capitol Square, that serves both breakfast and lunch. They make the most amazing French toast out of challah bread; topped with pastry cream, fresh berries, and real maple syrup, it's to die for! For lunch, you can't go wrong with any of their sandwiches, unless you're looking for a salad, in which case the grilled chicken and mixed greens will knock your socks off."}
{"text":"Couldn't think of a better breakfast place. 3 excellent options on the specials chalkboard, great coffee...you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Watery coffee. Tea water lukewarm. Food unexceptional. Noisy. Why all the stars again?"}
{"text":"Not a good day in the Marigold Kitchen - ordered the Aged Cheddar & Gruyere Grilled Cheese \" tomato & Dijon mustard on grilled sourdough that came with a nasty little purple, greasy, tasteless, limp slaw to compliment it, all for $9.00 - - How do you mess up a grilled cheese sandwich???? So disappointed, especially since my firm is a regular customer."}
{"text":"What great food but poor service.  We waited over 22 minutes for our lunch and the waitress told us \"hey were busy\"....a serious disappointment from a restaurant that used to be rated top notch in my books."}
{"text":"I can't recommend this place enough!! Every person I've brought here has also loved it. It can be a little chaotic but it's worth the wait for a table. Once we're sitting, I barely notice the bustle around us. I get the chili poached eggs almost every time -- absolutely amazing. Their rosemary toast is also to die for!"}
{"text":"I am more a fan of this place for their lunch than their breakfast.  The soups are the best I've had in Madison and are always in rotation so you're sure to try a wide variety.  I also love the sandwiches, and the sandwich of the day is also as delicious as any of the regulars.  The side red cabbage salad is decent, but I'd like more tang-usually I skip eating most of it in lieu of a cup of their soup ;)  Breakfast is ok but not out of this world."}
{"text":"The best brunch in Madison? Definitely in the running. This place was incredible - lots of options to accommodate everyone in your party and they make great scrambles. In fact, the only thing keeping them from getting 5 stars from me was their limited selection of vegetarian options - but they easily accommodated me and my scramble without the ham was still phenomenal. Also pleasantly surprising was their French rosemary toast - delicious!! The staff are warm and welcoming, and repeatedly apologized for the 15-minute wait (they shouldn't blame themselves for being so popular!!) -- I left feeling very full and very happy. I'll be a regular here!"}
{"text":"Was excited to try this place. it was not great, though. We ordered eggs over medium and they came not even over easy. The white of the egg was not even done. Disgusting. The dish we got prominently featured a large amount of very soggy soggy chips. We also got a short stack of blueberry pancakes. Those were tasty, but they were only about 4 inches across and they only served two. Way too expensive for what we got."}
{"text":"Hard to beat for a quick brunch spot on the weekend, but expect to wait. The line moves fast, but the space is small and its popular.   They have daily (seasonal) specials (pancakes, quiche and scramblers and another random item) and a standing menu of solid options. It's hard to go wrong with anything on the standard menu. My go-to item is the duck hash and my wife is in to the tofu scramble.   We also appreciate that the staff is super friendly and they accommodate food allergies very well."}
{"text":"Fabulous breakfast here on our way up the state! I was rushed in choosing between too many good options thanks to children running amuck, but the meals were delicious, the coffee tasty, and the service very friendly! I'd definitely stop back here if we were to come back through Madison."}
{"text":"So I came in with somewhat high expectations, seeing the good reviews on here and it looked like a really cute place, which it is. I ended up having a pretty bad experience, though, and feel like the ratings do not justify the overall quality.   We got our orders in a timely manner, even though they're packed in the morning because brunch ends at 11:30 or something. Our drinks actually came after our order, which I'm a little put off by, but I loved the hazelnut almond mocha, which was everything I needed for a luxurious pick me up. I ordered the quiche, which was a big mistake. Although restaurant quiche is usually nothing spectacular, this one was not good at all due to a crust that reminded me of a soggy pita bread and a base that did not have enough cream to give it the proper consistency. The microgreen salad it came with was good.   All of that was more or less acceptable, but the most off-putting and distracting part of our experience was the cockroach climbing around the wall.   Anyway, I won't be going back."}
{"text":"As far as brunch goes, I think this is the best restaurant I've been to for it. Nearly everything we have had has been not just good, but excellent. The pancakes are fluffy and have a slightly sweet flavor to them without syrup, the sausage links are great, the frittatas and omelets are very light yet packed with different flavors within. The best aspect, in my opinion, is the blending of flavors in the dishes. Often there is a combination of sweet and savory, or salty and sweet, or spicy and rich. The place is unpretentious (order at the counter, get your own coffee) and friendly. They have a dish for everyone: For the traditional \"eggs, bacon, and toast\" folks, they have excellent selections, and for the more adventurous eaters they provide unique twists on brunch classics.  Overall, if you moderately enjoy breakfast food and are pondering where to eat in Madison, I'd highly recommend Marigold!"}
{"text":"This place is one of the best little secrets tucked away along the capital square. It's definitely geared for those working near the capital that want to get a good lunch...scratch that great lunch.   Their burger, various sandwiches, salads, Moroccan soup are all amazing. For a lunch cafe this place has definitely stepped it's game up, it's fairly traditional lunch food but prepared and presented so much better. From the same guys that operate Sardine just a few blocks away this place elevates work day lunch to the highlight of the day.   I love how fresh the food tastes. All the dishes taste so refreshing. The inside too is great with a huge window, a few outdoor tables, the place just makes you want to smile. It's just so naturally bright inside, a total reprieve from the state buildings and parking lots just outside. All the staff always seems to be in such a good mood too.   I honestly can't say enough about how much I like this place. A lunch can cost you a bit more than standard fare so I always liked to make it a special occasion, but the truest of true treats it is every time."}
{"text":"I have visited twice this month.  Poor food both times:  first visit a hair in food (dish was sent back to kitchen), today cold over easy eggs (yuck) and a quiche that never arrived.  I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Love this for spot for breakfast, but get there early, as so do most other Madisonians.  Lovely GF food options too."}
{"text":"I can understand the draw to this place. I went on a Friday morning and it was steadily busy but not crowded. Order at the counter then they bring your food to you.  The French toast was phenomenal. The berries were sweet, the syrup was on the side - a plus because it was sweet enough on its own.  I really enjoyed the chai latte as well. It had the perfect mix of sweet and spice. I would certainly come back when in Madison."}
{"text":"I love Marigold. It is our go to spot for breakfast when we are in Madison.  Everything we have ordered has been wonderful. Great coffee and cappuccino as well. The only drawback is that it is very small and almost always crowded, but the staff does a great job keeping the food coming and tables moving.  The staff is always friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots for breakfast and/or brunch in Madison.  It is worth the trip even if some say it's difficult to find.  I have never been disappointed with my food here and this place doesn't put a hole in your wallet.    I always go on the weekends so there's usually quite a bit of people there but it's worth the wait.  Besides, it's the weekend, and a great atmosphere to spend a lazy morning on a Saturday/Sunday."}
{"text":"Big fan. I go for brunch almost every weekend. The specials are super delicious. If you go before 10:30 it is a little less crowded."}
{"text":"My sister and the locals both recommended this for breakfast. We somehow missed the mid morning surge from the farmers market so only had to wait for 6-8 people to place our order at the front.   Once you order there look to be plenty of seats.  You grab a coffee and water on your own.  Brat and sweet potato hash with coddled (not really poached) eggs was quite good.  The almond butter dominates the nice pancakes-  there is maple syrup.   The chili eggs were fine,  not quite what we expected.  Would return."}
{"text":"1 word...delicious! I came to Madison for the weekend to visit some friends and ate here for brunch on said friends' recommendation. It was a Sunday and the place was PACKED, which I didn't mind because it really added to the atmosphere. I found the staff to be very friendly and with great taste (I ordered based off their suggestions). I highly recommend this place if you ever find yourself in Madison and are looking for a place to have breakfast."}
{"text":"We loved Marigold Kitchen -- our new favorite breakfast place in Madison. Cute, homey little cafe. Order at the counter, sit down, and they bring it to you. The food tastes fresh and homemade. We had driven over from near the University of Wisconsin campus and wondered about street parking. Not to worry; there was a garage nearby."}
{"text":"My favorite place to have breakfast on a Saturday or Sunday Morning. Don't be alarmed if you go in and the seating is all taken. Its a popular Madison breakfast location, but the tables turnover fairly quickly. While you're waiting have a cup of their great coffee and relax. In the summer they also have outdoor seating which is always a advantage in my book.  The restaurant has a diverse population and spirited atmosphere. It is great for morning conversation, or just people watching. The wait staff is incredible and will take great care of you while you are there.  That being said their omelette options are unbeatable. With an array of ingredient options as well as salad a toast included it is a hearty breakfast, but not overwhelming. They also have great granola with fruit if you are looking for something a little lighter."}
{"text":"Fantastic cherry-peach turnover.  Freshly made and Oh. My. God. so good.  Great little place, some tables outside which was lovely in August, when I was last there.  Busy, so we got there early and were lucky enough to get a nice spot outside.  Fantastic breakfast and will definitely be back next time I'm in Madison."}
{"text":"It was crowded when we were there and I believe they could benefit by moving to a bigger space. Otherwise, i got the chicken and bacon sandwich. The pesto was amazing and for that reason alone, 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Busy place but definitely worth the wait. We were there on homecoming Saturday but were seated promptly. Blueberry pancakes with orange/almond butter are top 5 for sure. Wife said the hash browns were the best. Would surely go back."}
{"text":"This is one of the best breakfast/lunch spots around the Capitol, and it's off one of the side streets so it's kind of hidden! I had eaten brunch here once before years ago, and went back with some friends for lunch today. The French toast was one of the highly recommended items so we ordered it and it definitely lived up to the expectation! We also got the breakfast sandwich which came on a soft ciabatta roll and was unique with the addition of a cream cheese spread. Our side of breakfast potatoes was really good, the house flavoring gives the potatoes a special flavor. The coffee is very good as well, they are nice about refills. Overall, any sandwich or egg dish seems to be the move- I am more of a savory person, so that may just be personal opinion, but the breads are all fresh and the meats paired excellently with their cheeses and sauce spreads. We went on a rainy day and the environment was comfy and warm, perfect to hangout with friends or study."}
{"text":"A few friends and I went to Marigold over the weekend. We have been there a few times and enjoy the bright atmosphere and delicious brunch. I had the grilled chicken salad for the first time and I am still amazed at how good it was. The omelets are also always great there.  Though the food is a little more pricey than the average breakfast/brunch places in Madison, all of their food is locally produced so you pay a little extra for the quality. Overall I definitely recommend Marigold Kitchen for a great Saturday brunch! My only complaint is that they close at 2:30 which is a little early if you want to grab a late lunch."}
{"text":"Awesome Breakfast it's like you have your own personal chef. Give them a try you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"I loved the friendly, busy atmosphere. The food was amazing both times I went. I liked the fact that they could do a tofu scramble instead of the eggs:) the potatoes are to die for (extra crispy)! A must stop place for coffee & brunch while in Madison!:)"}
{"text":"Food - I will give 4 stars. Wait time is horrible for both online ordering and at the restaurant, thus they get 1 star from me. This has happened to me twice. The last time I just left and went to Muramoto."}
{"text":"These guys are great, awesome specials (lunch and breakfast) and the menu is rock solid.  If you go, be sure to pay attention to the seating process, especially on the weekends.  It works, just don't be the guy that screws it up for everyone.    Today my wife and I had the scrambler special and the duck confit.  We also, in a move of gluten, split the banana bread french toast special.  The french toast special was get down good.  Really good banana bread to start and it just got better with every bite.  I also think todays scrambler was one of my favorites.  Sausage, feta, roasted red peppers, spinach.....it was hitting in my wheel house for sure.    They also do great coffee/tea drinks (try the chai, they make it themselves and it is worth it) and lots of good pastry.  My favorite time to visit Marigold is an off our during the week, it doesn't happen often but when I can, that is a great time to go.    Enjoy this place folks, I know I do."}
{"text":"Marigold disappointed us today- we got there before the lunch rush on a Monday and there wasn't even a line.... But we had to wait 45 minutes for our food- which would have been fine if the food was excellent. But the potatoes were cold and horribly burnt, some parts were so charred they were not edible. Previous visits have been worth more like 4 stars, but not today. I don't think we will be back for awhile as it isn't worth paying for parking."}
{"text":"Met some colleagues for a business breakfast here. I had a breakfast skillet and coffee. It was OK, not earth shattering my any means. Maybe I'll try some different for the next time."}
{"text":"I think they can do better than this, based upon their history of positive reviews.  When a popular restaurant is busy, it can be a true test of its excellence, however.  Ordered the poppy seed pancakes at the register per the posted etiquitte, paid, was given a number, grabbed coffee, and took a seat at a recently-vacated table.  Table needed a wiping-down; a torn-off top of a sweetener packet lay next to the condiments.  No sweat - well, not yet, that is.  Young lady busperson, with two neatly-folded towels draped over her forearm, walked adroitly past no fewer than three times, each time observing my table.  Another busperson walked by, noticed I had been waiting for what must have been an unusually extended period, said my assigned number was incorrect and, thus, the reason for the wait.  (Phew, thanks man!)  Breakfast arrives, and I ask the server for a table cleaning.  She eagerly addresses my request and apologizes.  Cool!  Thanks!  Pancakes are well-presented.  They taste great, until I taste someone's sausage - or something.  Cakes are doughy.  But they tasted great, and took care of my sweet tooth for the day.  Upon leaving, I'm bid a \"great day\" by the lady with towels poised on the forearm.  Perhaps I'm somewhat old-school, but I base my tipping upon the quality of the food served and the service rendered during consumption thereof.  I really think they can do better."}
{"text":"Marigold Kitchen is definitely our favorite breakfast/brunch place in Madison...but unfortunately a lot of other people also choose it as their favorite, because on weekends it is usually a really long wait if you get there for brunch!  This is NOT the place to go with a large party. We never try to go with more than 4 people total, because getting a table will basically be impossible!  The food is great- the seasonal berry french toast is surprisingly light and balanced- and the potato hash is starchy salty heaven!"}
{"text":"A lovely breakfast place!  Kind of pricey but I can tell the food is fresh and high quality unlike Mickie s dairy bar,and it's definitely a healthier choice."}
{"text":"I eat here about once a month because it's close to my office and the food is usually good. Friday morning the place was off. The scrambled eggs were dry/overcooked, and the bacon tasted old. The bacon was fatty, limp, and just plain gross. For $13 I got overdone potatoes, overdone eggs, underdone bacon that tasted like it was well over its expiration date, one piece of underdone toast, and some good orange juice. I left over half the meal on the table. The juice was good."}
{"text":"Generally the food here is really good. I typically get an omelet, which comes with home fries. That is more than enough food! The ingredients are fresh and your meal is made quickly. When I'm trying to tap into my inner chubby child, I order a pancake on the side. The blueberry pancakes were very tasty. I recommend going during the week. Weekends are crowded, making seating difficult and your home fries more likely to come out \"extra crisp\". The wait staff is friendly and the room is open and inviting."}
{"text":"Good for breakfast or brunch, Very conveniently located near the Farmers Market. Great service"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and thoroughly enjoyed both experiences. I love restaurants that have you order at the counter because it gives you ample amount of time to study the menu while you wait in line to order/grab a table. I came with a friend at 1pm on a Sunday and there was no wait and ample seating choices. The other time I came was during a more generic brunch time (probably 10:30/11ish?) and even though the line went to the door it moved really quickly and I had barely made up my mind about what I wanted when it was my time to order. I got the cold brew coffee and one of the weekend specials which were mahi mahi fish tacos with cabbage, guacamole, salsa roja, chipotle crema, and 2 eggs and black beans. I was slightly skeptical about getting fish tacos from a brunch place but they were SO good. I think that goes to show the quality of their ingredients and their cooking.  My friend got the mimosa which was made with fresh squeezed oj and the salmon frittata which looked delicious. We also tried their red velvet cupcake and the blueberry compote scone. I'm not a huge fan of scones in general but this one was decent as far as scones go and had a nice thin lemon glaze on top that wasn't overpowering. All in all Marigold is a very solid brunch option and even with a diverse menu they execute it all extremely well."}
{"text":"One of the best breakfast joints I've ever eaten at. Had blueberry pancakes with almond orange butter. Breakfast ciabatta sandwich nicely rounded out the salty portion of the meal.  Must go when you're in Madison."}
{"text":"Yum! Marigold never lets me down. Their sandwiches are fantastic, but I was just as delighted by their brunch when I ordered a chorizo-and-smoked-cheddar omelette last weekend. It can be quite crowded, but turnover is fast enough that I've never had to wait very long for a table. The perfect place to cozy up on a weekend morning, now that we're heading into winter."}
{"text":"Had great meal and good service.  Seating a bit hard to find.  A lot of readers- people spending long time reading God knows what on phone or paper!!.   Hints seats being occupied by people just reading instead of eating.  Overall good food and nice employees."}
{"text":"I went here for breakfast one day, and it was probably the best breakfast of my life. No joke.   I ordered the golden flax cakes (I think). Perfectly cooked with a great peach and butter cream top if I remember correctly. I also got some mini donut holes that were good.  The flavored tea was gross (way to bitter/spicy), but I'm not really a tea guy and have no clue why I ordered it.  Expensive and crowded but worth it if you want some great food."}
{"text":"This was my second visit to Marigold's and was very impressed each time. Get there early for lunch, because it packs up fast as there aren't too many options on the square. I'd recommend 11 or 11:30 at the latest.  I had the chili braised chicken which was amazing. Just the perfect amount of spice. Don't forget to grab a few extra napkins as it was a little messy. Wouldn't recommend for a business meeting :-) However, my co-diners each had different salads and were raving.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Outstanding food!  A little hectic for my taste with people everywhere but I really enjoyed the food.  Wow!"}
{"text":"Fantastic breakfast but can get so busy it is almost a challenge. Thank god for Super Marigold Woman...she has special powers and busts people for taking up seating before ordering. It is definitely necessary as it gets very busy. French toast on the weekend is deluxe. Espresso is good. The kitchen is a well oiled machine and interesting to watch from the bar. Not a place to pull out the Sunday paper or laptop and chill, Marigold is all about eating and the eating is good."}
{"text":"Marigold just started Sunday brunch a few months ago which is great since they used to only be open for Saturday brunch.   My favorite brunch dish there is the salmon, chive, and cream cheese omelet.  The breakfast egg sandwich is really good too (it has boursin cheese on it).  I've been there for lunch a few times, and have enjoyed their salads as well.  The only thing I've had there that I didn't like was their bloody Mary, it tasted too much like celery for my taste.  It tends to get really busy and crowded on Farmer's Market Saturdays, but I've usually been able to get a table while a friend waited in line to order.  Even when I've had to wait in line to order, the atmosphere and service has always been cheerful."}
{"text":"Food was delicious!!! Loved the omelets and the pancakes! Only negative was the wait due to the small space."}
{"text":"Soooo good! They've got something for everyone and the service is excellent. I asked for a tea latte, which is not on the menu, and the barista literally spent 10 minutes making the most perfect latte ever! The wait can be long on the weekend but it's totally worth it."}
{"text":"We waited to get a table prior to ordering to ensure we would be able to sit to eat, as we had never been here before. After waiting 15 minutes for a table to open up, one did and we sat. We were approached by a waitress that told us we needed to get up from our table and continue to wait because we had not yet ordered. She was unpleasant and would not let us put in our order and keep our table. Our experience was not a good one and we will not be returning."}
{"text":"One of the better cafes I've been to! As soon as you step in the door, you notice the bright, sunny, modern interior, which gives the place a great vibe. I noticed that they also had fresh flowers throughout the cafe, making for a homely and inviting feel. I had the breakfast sandwich, it was so yummy! I think I'll have it again next time I'm back in Madison. Coffee was pretty good: a bit too frothy and not quite as hot as I'd like but this was not a biggie as the food was excellent :)"}
{"text":"Didn't see all the hype for this place. First off, finding parking was a pain in the butt. Got to the restaurant and chose the quiche which was listed on the chalkboard to find it wasn't available so there was the next disappointment. Pancakes, scrambler of the day were fine, but portions are small for the price and my teenage kids left hungry.   Staff were very friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"We had duck confit and grilled chicken salad, both average. French toast was awesome. Chai and almond mocha were great. No wifi"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious breakfast. Had the sweet potato hash which was nourishing, healthy and filling. Loved the relaxed coffee shop atmosphere. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Great food, coffee & a pretty spot to enjoy it in. Not a huge fan of breakfast potatoes but theirs are excellent. The rosemary toast is an out of the ordinary treat. Solid pancakes & egg dishes too!  Coffee is self serve & 5 star yummy."}
{"text":"Very very good! The potatoes are so amazing! They are perfectly cooked with some crunchy and some not! I have most definetly been here more than once. I made sure to bring my mom here while she was visiting for the weekend! And she loved it as well! Great atmosphere for a breakfast place!"}
{"text":"Incredibly fresh ingredients, super friendly staff. Had the Marigold Breakfast sandwich and the Barley Sauté, would definitely get again."}
{"text":"First of all, I just want to say I had a crappy morning \"a nothing seems to be going right\" kind of morning... until I stepped through the doors of Marigold Kitchen. Everyone is so friendly it's hard not to let that rub off on you a little bit. I ordered the French Toast, which is usually my go-to when I go out for breakfast.... but this French Toast blew all the other's out of the water! The almond butter on top is just amazing!!! I am now, a huge fan!"}
{"text":"The set up is poor and it's too crowded. Difficult to relax and eat in their loud environment. Staff was incredibly rude to us as they had mistakenly taken our order and brought us one plate of food instead if two  - then they offered to bring us a plate to split it! Ummm how about the other order we paid for? RUDE! Food was good but I WILL NOT go back."}
{"text":"I have been a few times now and always leave happy. The duck confit hash was great. The steel cut oats were great. The tuna melt is the best I've ever had. And one time I had a burger that was delicious.   However, they get a few things wrong. I haven't had everything on the menu so I can't speak to everything but I have had a few things I didn't like. Their soups, for instance, don't always come out tasting as great as they sound. I have had one that was incredibly salty, and another that was just bland. Also, all of their sandwiches come with a red cabbage salad which should be delicious. But, instead it comes out tasting like a sour mess filled with what I think are fennel seeds, maybe anise. And to upgrade to a classy green salad smothered with balsamic costs another 1.50...who the hell upcharges for greens?  All in all their food is great and I feel safe ordering anything on the menu, except for soups. Also, next time I will just ask for nothing on the side as the mound of red cabbage always tempts...but also always disappoints."}
{"text":"Oh god.  Ok, first of all I LIVE for a good brunch.  I don't mind lines, not one bit (and I've seen some fucking brunch lines in my day), but when I have to order at the counter and THEN table-wait with my silverware, coffee and order number in hand, we have a problem.  I need the whole experience to occur while seated.  Call me crazy.  I like to sit with my menu and my coffee while I decide, not be shanghied into ordering the second I walk in the door.    It's not like you're getting your food any sooner after being seated either.  It still takes a while.    My brioche french toast was cold and not even slightly flavorful.  There was a weird taste to it, like they tried to infuse it with orange but ended up stirring rancid oj into the egg batter.  Just gross.  Had I not been starving it would've been sent back.  The duck confit hash was delicious, but, seriously, how can you screw up anything fried in duck fat?    Oh, AND they ran out of coffee.  For like at least a half hour there was no coffee in the joint.  Come ON, dudes, you're lucky to get even the second star here."}
{"text":"Not busy on a Thursday.  Coffee okay, not great.  Friendly staff.  Had the \"Scrambler\", which had bacon,cheese, tomatoes, spinach in it.  Very nice.  Served with a side of roasted potatoes that were almost burnt.  A little too crispy and salty for me."}
{"text":"You will walk into this place then want to walk back out. The line's usually out the door, and even once you get around to ordering, there might not be any seating. This is a good sign, people love the place. The only problem I have with the food is when crowded customers bump me and I loose some of it. The rosemary potatoes go great with everything."}
{"text":"Love coming here for brunch! The omelettes and pancakes here are of such high quality.. we lived in SF and Boston prior to moving to Madison and this is on par with brunches we've had there. Our toddler gets up early which suits us well so we can get to Marigold Kitchen before the crowds arrive!"}
{"text":"I have been to Marigold's several times. This is partly because it was close to my old place. I only go there for brunch. The place is really cute and cozy. Sometimes it's CRAZY busy so be prepared to wait.   They have super good pancakes. This is mostly because the syrup is so good! Also their roasted potatoes are so yum! The breakfast sandwich is VERY good too.  Also I love that they always have great pastries. Say yes to the muffins!  If you're in Madison, WI this is a nice place to have brunch."}
{"text":"Great brunch place, but very popular, so be prepared to wait for a table.  My spinach and goat cheese scramble was delicious."}
{"text":"Great food. It's a little crazy with how crowded it is, but their food is on spot."}
{"text":"Very good breakfasts. The bacon is high quality. Potatoes are delish. Good ambience and very friendly service."}
{"text":"Très bons petits déjeuners. Le service est très agréable, le choix pas forcement très large mais avec des choses plutôt travaillées, rafinées et originales. Plus orienté chic que diner. Un contraste sympa et complémentaire avec Mickies Dairy bar, carrément orienté diner. La clientèle est plus branché, cadre, enseignants, fonctionnaires qu'étudiants et travailleurs. Très bonne adresse"}
{"text":"This place always reminded me of New York for some reason. Now that I'm in NYC, I can't quite find anywhere quite like it!  I come here on the weekends strictly for the duck confit hash. It is so fresh and delicious and fills you up in a very healthy way. There's even enough to take home for a late lunch later in the day.  Come early in order to score a seat!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Local, organic ingredients with a creative menu and quick and friendly service."}
{"text":"Sunday brunch at Marigold has become a tradition for us. While I hate crowds and it is usually very crowded, somehow the unique flow of waiting in line to order and then hoping there's a table available had always worked out for us. Just be patient! I always get either the breakfast sandwich with some kind of delicious cheese spread or the weekly pancake special that always includes a delicious flavored butter. Another favorite is the maple latte. The potatoes are obviously a must have."}
{"text":"I had the duck confit hash with poached eggs which was delicious $12. Mom had the pancakes, she said they had an orange taste to them, she loved them. The guys running the grill are super efficient, we waited for 15min for food tops...super fast for being there on a Sunday afternoon. The ambiance is hipster. I saw a few kids in there, not too many older people"}
{"text":"At first I was upset at their seating system even though I was doing a carrying out. They allowed one person to take a table for ten(which had to be made from 4 smaller tables) when none of the remainder of the party was present or even in line. This caused a huge back up for people waiting for a table in a tiny place and waiting for food. Then I received our order and it was a the most salted food I have ever have been served. The eggs and the potatoes tasted more like a salt shaker than food. Very disappointing place."}
{"text":"While the food at Marigolds is delicious, the service completely ruins the experience. They have a poor system of ordering at the counter and having food brought out, and when they do make a mistake, they don't admit it. They let you sit there for an hour waiting for food that won't ever come, and make you ask three times for your money back. Don't go here, the manager is an absolute idiot. What matters more, an accounting error that THEY made or maintaining halfway decent customer service?"}
{"text":"The service was incredibly friendly. I wanted the ham and gruyere omelette but I can't have nitrates so I asked the lady at the counter and she wasn't sure so she went out of her way to find out.  The food was equally impressive. The eggs were perfectly cooked - not too dry/wet and the pancakes were fluffy and light. Best breakfast in town."}
{"text":"I once drove from Detroit just to have brunch here.  Okay, it was also to visit my family, but their breakfast & brunch menus are wonderful."}
{"text":"Marigold was my favorite spot for lunch in Madison for more than a year, and I miss it, especially the salads.   This is definitely not a secret spot - it's packed because it's so good!  Sometimes there's not even a chair to sit in while you wait for your take-out order.  On a cold day, order soup. On a nice day, eat outside!"}
{"text":"Everything is great!   Maple latte, yumm!  Steel cut oats with strawberries, breakfast scramble, ceasar salad!   And so close to the hilton!"}
{"text":"Went here this morning , on a whim !! Well it did not disappoint; I had the 3 grain breakfast, I sometimes get ' healthy ' things for brekkie and am usually unsatisfied and still hungry , it's now 10 hours later and I'm still thinking of the delicious flavors And colors ! My daughter is a picky eater and they couldn't have been more accommodating.  We also had the cinnamon muffins for dessert, another win !   This definitely is a fantastic place , Madison is a super cute town And this is a perfect compliment to the city !!"}
{"text":"Met a friend for brunch there this morning; we were a little on the early side for a Saturday morning, arriving about 9:30.  By the time we left, the place was full and there was a wait at the counter.    I had coffee and the biscuits/gravy with eggs and field greens for $10.95, my friend ordered the breakfast sandwich for $5.95.  Frankly, my meal was overpriced, and wasn't of sufficiently higher quality to justify the additional charge over, say, Denny's.  I'm not opposed to paying for atmosphere or creative and fresh cooking; this just wasn't special enough, IMO.  My friend's sandwich, on the other hand, was tremendous- on ciabatta with eggs, tomato, applewood bacon, etc.  I'd definitely order that again.  It's great that they serve Ancora coffee- a definite plus in my book.  It's family-friendly, but the kids there were generally well-behaved- also another plus.  Didn't feel rushed and the decor is comfortable."}
{"text":"Went there this morning for breakfast, at first everything was good, got our order in quickly despite it being busy and got our coffee quick too, the maple latte is really good. But then we waited 50 minutes for our food, which was descent but not worth the wait. Two other tables around us also got part of their orders wrong and things sent back to the kitchen. Kitchen was disorganized and even at a nice restaurant you don't wait that long, no one even apologized for the wait. Overall not worth the wait."}
{"text":"Fun environment with excellent food. We stopped in for breakfast after staying overnight at the Edgewater Hotel. The staff was very friendly and helpful as we browsed the menu and prepared to order. I thoroughly enjoyed my french toast with berries and latte. As others have said, I'd recommend getting in early as they do fill up very quickly. I look forward to visiting again when we're in Madison!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is really seasonal and always high quality. Wish they were open for dinner!"}
{"text":"My favorite place.  Fresh, real and scrumptious. You've gotta try the duck confit hash salad (WOAH!!), freshly squeezed juices, and pastries.  You really can't go wrong here.  It's the BEST!"}
{"text":"Have visited Madison 5 times and never been to Marigold.  What a SHAME!   This is my favorite of maybe 15 places over the last 4 years of visting.  Delicious food!  Fast, friendly service!  Nice ambience!  Excellent all around!"}
{"text":"On this warm sunny day in Madison we stopped by and enjoyed outdoor seating with a large delicious piece of quiche and a wonderful pot of tea. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"i looooooove this place, especially for breakfast/brunch. the breakfast sandwich is delicious, the lunch menu always has a good mix of filling sandwiches & salads... order + pay at the counter, pick a seat, eat, leave a tip for servers delivering food and checking on ya, walk out happy."}
{"text":"Possibly the best chilaquiles I have ever had in my entire life.  I am a big fan of chilaquiles and these are definitely the best in town I've had.  If you know a better spot for chilaquiles please let me know so I can enjoy them there too!  Also, they pump this food out at incredibly fast speeds.  We ordered directly behind a few other parties and got our food within 5 minutes."}
{"text":"The most delicious blueberry pancakes I've ever had followed by several awesome mimosas.  I'm not positive that they serve mimosas and the other alcoholic drinks for every breakfast, I went on a saturday which happens to be the only day then mention such drinks on their website.  Also the staff was very friendly and the restaurant was super clean."}
{"text":"One of my close friends took a trip out to Madison, and raved about Marigold Kitchen upon her return. I made a mental note to check it out if I was ever in the area, and the day happened a lot sooner than I expected. Unfortunately, my experience wasn't nearly as exciting as I had hoped it would.  This may have something to do with my vegetarianism. There is a limited number of savory vegetarian breakfast items on the menu, but it's never too hard for me to find something I want to eat. I opted to get an omlette, which tasted fine. But, that was the problem for me-- it was fine, but it was also surprisingly boring. The omlette was good, but I've had countless omlettes that tasted better.  The potatoes were delicious, until my oversalted second bite. The most exciting part of my meal was the rosemary toast not necessarily because it was the most delicious part, but because it was the most unique.  For all the hype, I had expected some pretty spectacular food; instead, I found pretty good food.  Marigold Kitchen does have a great environment though-- fast and service, cozy decor, friendly atmosphere, all lending to a good, if not memorable, experience."}
{"text":"Went here for Sunday brunch and all I can say is, YUM! My little nephew likes it so well that he went back two days in a row and got the same thing- French toast. You order at the counter and they have a lot to choose from! I got a zucchini omelette that came with greens and potatoes and toast. I will say that I would have wished for more toast and fewer potatoes, but I also supplemented that with a fruit plate so it was all good. The carrot cake looked amazing but I didn't want to get back in line. There is a little pressure to finish quickly to turn over the table, but the ingredients are natural and delicious and it's such a cute place that that kind of negates any small drawbacks."}
{"text":"Like almost everyone else, I came here for breakfast and absolutely loved it. Everything is reasonably priced, which is great considering cafés downtown tend to jack up their food prices. Everyone working there was really friendly and the food came up quickly.  The coffee was also pretty darn good, and I loved that it was self serve (when I was there at least). As for the food, I only got a basic one egg meal but the potatoes and rosemary toast are worth going there by themselves.  I'd say the only downside is the high ceilings, which look really cool but cause the place to get fairly noisy when a lot of people are around."}
{"text":"This has become our staple brunch spot. I highly recommend the breakfast sandwich. The macaroons are ok, just a little dry. My boyfriend always orders the french toast and the almond hazelnut mocha, it is his favorite brunch combo now...and that is coming from a self-proclaimed french toast connoisseur! Tip, if there is a line have a friend run up to the front register to grab menus for you. That way you're ready to order when you reach the counter."}
{"text":"Fabulous place for breakfast.   My husband had the Mahi Mahi tacos and I had the french toast.  Both were delicious.   We split a blackberry cherry scone.  It was good but the entrees were the best.  Great coffee too."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place. Go for the pancakes! Be prepared to wait if you show up after 10 am."}
{"text":"Casual and delicious! Seriously, everything is fresh and yummy.  Staff was friendly and menu items were creative.  You can't go wrong if your looking for something a little different at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Been a customer for 6yrs now. My family's go to spot for breakfast. My wife fell in love with the duck confit hash the first time she was there and orders it time and again. I wander about the menu a bit and jump at the occasional special and always satisfied with my decision. Taken lots of family visiting from out of state and the consensus is that its really good. Best of all, one time I took my 4yr old there for his birthday and when the waiter found out we were celebrating he asked everyone in the building to help him sing happy bday to my son. To have the entire place join in song, patrons included, was amazing. This place is about a lot more than just food."}
{"text":"The hardest part is deciding what to eat and, so far, I've discovered that you can't go wrong.  I've been several times for lunch and brunch. Ordering off the printed menu is always solid and so are the daily specials. Chili braised chicken sandwich is my lunch pick and the chorizo corn omelet is my breakfast go-to. The salads are also great and super satisfying.   One word of warning: there's bound to be a loooong wait at peak times, so try to beat the crowd."}
{"text":"This place is very different from other places I've been to! It's pretty neat! The food was great! Can't really say much about service"}
{"text":"I've always ordered the breakfast sandwich, which is delicious. Today someone I was with ordered the chilaquiles and oh my god. They were amazing. I stole many bites when she wasn't looking. Get them with chorizo and avocado. So good.   I still don't like their breakfast potatoes though. Wayyyyyy toooooo greasy for me. Soaked."}
{"text":"Marigold is by far the best place for breakfast/brunch in Madison.  Every dish I've tried, from the house-made granola to the steel-cut oats, from the varying egg scrambler (changes daily) or duck hash (duck! HASH!) to the pancakes and waffles, this restaurant will give you that food coma you so deserve.    More pluses: -Fresh squeezed orange juice -A large selection of baked tarts, scones, and muffins -Easy ordering (line up and order at the counter; then grab a number and find a table.  This can be a bit daunting during crowded times, but I have never had a problem getting a seat by the time my food was ready, and the servers help you out with this if needed). -COFFEE.  VERY GOOD COFFEE.  They hand you the mugs right away so you can fill 'er up yourself while you wait for your table. -Counter seating. -\"Too much\" (meaning just enough) food on the plate...enough for a doggie bag. -They have some brunchy cocktails, including one called a greyhound (grapefruit juice & vodka) along with the usual standards (mimosa, screwdriver, bloody mary). -The sourdough toast: NOM NOM.  Minuses: -Can be a bit cramped; it's a small space and everyone and their mother (and their many kids) loves to eat here. -Closed on Sundays!  Boooo!"}
{"text":"I've gotta say, when I walked in I was a little leery.  The line went to the door and the place was packed.  I anticipated either having to wait a long time for a table or have our food, which is ordered at the counter, arrive before we had a table.  I must say I was quite impressed with how fast they turned tables.  It took very little time at all to work our way through the line and have a table ready for us.    Because of the efficiency and speed at which they turn tables, brunch felt very rushed and that is the only thing that detracted from the food, which by the way was fantastic.    This is the best brunch I've had by far in Madison thus far and a place I really need to go back to now that I know what to expect."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places for brunch in Madison!   I had the guajillo chicken tostada today and it was probably one of my least favorite dishes I've had at Marigold because of the fact it's so lackluster next to the other dishes I've had here, not to say that it was bad, but it was particularly average.  Time after time, the duck confit hash and the pancakes keep me coming back, so I might stick to those next time. There are fun omelette combinations and those are always yummy too!  If you come on the weekend, be prepared to wait a little bit for a seat. It's a somewhat pricey for what you're getting, but you're paying for location too I guess. After a lovely brunch, you'll leave smelling very strongly of breakfast food (in the best way)."}
{"text":"I loved this place.  Our son, Andrew, and girlfriend, Sara, took us here to enjoy a wonderful breakfast on our recent trip to Wisconsin.... Everything they had here was delicious and I hope to get a chance to go back some day.  It was definitely worth the wait to get in.  I had the strawberry pancakes with marscapone cheese and I will dream about it now."}
{"text":"This place was my last pit stop in WI... and it was GREAT!  It's not listed on the menu and they don't really announce it, but the restaurant is buy local! I LOVE IT! I only know that because of the board by the Restrooms.  Very similar to Kansas City's \"You say Tomato\" restaurant. You check out the menu, and head to the counter to order get a number and they will bring you the food.   Madison, WELL DONE! This is differently a breakfast stop that I will be coming to a lot. Especially now that I might be heading that way very often =D.   It's kinda of in an odd area. Well I think it is just because the streets in Madison are freaking WEIRD! lol, but none the least. If youre a UW student, it's super close to campus... So find a random place to park around the capital, and just walk there!   Pricing isn't bad at all! Actually I thought it was pretty cheap! And a great size for what you pay for. I got the Salmon Frittata, for only 11 bucks. what!!!! Couple of my friends got theirs for $15 but there were huge!  Would I go back? YASS! it's a bit small inside... but they have seating outside"}
{"text":"This place is a gem. If you like a laid back ambiance, great food and don't mind a wait, you'll be happy here. As you enter, you go straight to the registers (or to the back of the long line!!) and order there. They have menus by the registers, as well as specials written on the chalk boards, so you can be prepared to order by the time you reach the front. Once you've placed your order they'll give you a number and you can find your seat. Breakfast and lunch are both delicious, I think you're safe with any food choice here! It's all very fresh and well prepared/plated. The thing that impressed me most with Marigold on my most recent visit was the service. My mom and I arrived for a late lunch a few minutes before 2 pm. We were not rushed, took our time ordering, and enjoyed a leisurely lunch outside. As we were finishing up, I wondered aloud what time they closed, as it dawned on me that it was pretty quiet. They close at 2!!! OOPS! I feel terrible that we came and ordered soo close to closing and then took our sweet time. We would have never done that had we known. But this is why I left feeling so impressed with their service. The young man working the register was perfectly polite and did not say or do anything to make me believe he didn't want us there. He took my order \"for here\" as though nothing were strange about it at all. The woman who brought our food was also very polite and we were never made to feel rushed or as though we were unwanted in their space during our meal. I would like to offer my apologies to the staff for staying so far passed close... but also praise them up and down for wonderful service!"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast.  Pastries are delicious. Everything they make here is good. For the people who don't know the rule about grabbing a table before ordering, shame on you. Staff are super friendly, but the credit should go to the people behind the scenes, they do an excellent job day in and day out. And rarely are recognized for their efforts.  Kudos to you guys especially."}
{"text":"Whenever I have conference in Wisconsin, I always make sure I reserve time to have breakfast at Marigold Kitchen. I particularly love their French toasts with almond sauce and berries on them. They are tasty enough without adding maple syrup. Chocolate almond latte and lavender latte are a must-try, though I find them a bit too sweet but the flavor is amazing. Their breakfast is always something I look forward to when I have conference in Madison."}
{"text":"We were just in Madison for a few days, and looked up restaurants on yelp to make sure we're eat nothing but great food. The breakfast here sounded fantastic, and we were disappointed when we realized, as we arrived, that they had just stopped serving breakfast and our choices now were mostly all-American sandwiches.  Lacking other breakfast options, we took our sad faces to the counter to order some sandwiches and coffee and were soon pleasantly surprised: That burger I ordered with no particular expectations might have just been the best burger of my entire life. So, so good. My partner said the same about the tilapia sandwich. I can't wait to come back here and try everything else (maybe even make it in time for breakfast)."}
{"text":"Great spot downtown for breakfast or lunch. We were visiting from California, in search of the best Bloody Mary in Madison, and Marigold was the winner (despite not being served with the standard Wisconsin sidecar). Duck confit hash was incredible, as was the brioche French toast. Friendly service in an understated coffee shop atmosphere. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I absolutely loved their buttermilk pancakes, especially topped with almond orange butter. The combination of almond orange butter, powdered sugar, and maple syrup is just fantastic. I'd definitely order them again.  The staff serves your breakfast directly to the table and even sets out your silverware for you--no unwrapping a napkin to get at your knife and fork. Friendly service, delicious food. It recommends itself."}
{"text":"First time in Madison and this place was recommended to stop for breakfast from a close friend....and we are so happy we did!  Fun atmosphere and good people all around. We got here around 9a on a Saturday, not much of a line (but there was by 9:45am when we left!). The service was fast and friendly and you never felt rushed....and the food was delicious. We ordered the nitro brews which tasted like a coffee milkshake, ham and gruyere omelet and the scrambled weekend special. The rosemary toast paired REALLY well with the omelet!!  We would come back for sure."}
{"text":"Whatever you get, it's going to be delicious!  Initially entering, the set up of the restaurant is a little confusing. You wait in line at the door, order your food and beverage at the counter, are given a number, proceed to the wall, and wait to be seated. This entire process took about 20 minutes(only 5 or so from actually placing our order.) We went on a Sunday morning, so it was fairly busy. Staff was friendly and quick moving to help get people in and out. The decor is cozy; a little Tuscan, bohemian kitchen type feel. A server brought our drinks to the table, followed shortly after by the food. THE FOOD! You guys, if you're not won over by the amazing smell or visual presentation, you certainly will be by the tastes! Light, fluffy, flavorful French toast, hearty and semi healthy pancakes, both served with warm syrup, and a soothing mocha or energizing cup of coffee. Just what you need to fuel you for a downtown stroll by the capital afterward. Can't go wrong! Hope you enjoy your visit!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here and it was excellent. I got a grilled vegetable sandwich which was huge and tasty on grilled wheat bread, and my wife had a tuna sandwich on grilled sourdough. I also started with the gazpacho which was quite tasty. The interior \"ambiance\" is nonexistent. It's loud and you order at the counter and someone brings you your food after spotting your number. But no matter, the food more than made the experience and I'll definitely go back there next time I'm in Madison."}
{"text":"Amazing eggs and potatoes. Perfect pastries. The apple french toast woke us up in such a sweet and refined way. Great service. Not posh, and very busy - but nevertheless perfect."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best breakfast/lunch places in Madison if you're looking for fresh food with lots of flavor. They have specials daily - usually a type of breakfast entree, a soup and a sandwich type. Breakfast can always be ordered. Their duck confit hash is probably my favorite breakfast item and I love their Guajillo Braised Chicken sandwich for lunch."}
{"text":"Really great meal and ambiance.  The \"Marigold Potatoes\" were my favorite. I almost didnt eat them because of their appearance but am so glad I did....i could have licked my plate! The rosemary toast was also great.  Cappucino and omelette were average and i did feel it was a tiny bit expensive and that there were a couple other flaws (no spoon with my coffee and decorative flowers fairly wilted) but overall great experience."}
{"text":"Greeted by nice people this order and sit place has a warm and inviting atmosphere.   The duck confit hash is both subtle and tasty, something that is hard to do with duck and harder with hash.   The pancakes are light and perfect. This is way better than its 4 stars suggests."}
{"text":"Went for lunch. Had the turkey and pear sandwich. Flavor combination was very good. Also had a macaroon...yummy!!   Small but comfortable place."}
{"text":"I've brunched/lunched at Marigold Kitchen while traveling to Madison for business many times and it never disappoints!   It's a very causal, order-at-the-counter, fill-up-your-own-water, kind of place. They have many unique breakfast and lunch options as well as daily specials that always leave me torn on what to order.  My all time favorite meal at MK is the roasted sweet potato, kale and basil walnut pesto hash. But you really can't go wrong with anything else!  Be sure to check this place out if you find yourself in Madison. They have outdoor seating too!"}
{"text":"I came here to have my last lunch in Madison.   Needless to say, everything I had was fresh and a great combination of flavors.   I'm so sad that I discovered it so late. Makes my tummy sad, but probably good for my waistline."}
{"text":"Fantastic place for brunch. I went to Marigold with a few of friends for Sunday brunch and it was a good experience! The line was out the door when we got there, but didn't take too long to get to the front and order... it is set up where you order at the counter, the waiter ushers you to a table to sit down and the brings the orders to the table from the kitchen.   I ordered a cup of coffee (Colectivo coffee, bottomless) and the scrambler with sourdough bread. It was SO MUCH FOOD but so good. There was a bit more cheese on the scrambler than I would have liked, but nothing I couldn't scrape off. All of my friends said they enjoyed their dishes, however one who had ordered the chilaquiles had asked for the beans on the side and they ended up being served within her main plate rather than on a separate dish.   The place is pretty small, so if it is busy, it feels like you cannot stay too long so that others can sit. But, the food is amazing and the atmosphere is really fun for a small brunch get together -- definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Never disappointed when we come here for brunch.  Typically a line when you come in.  Don't let that scare you.  Just jump in line and be patient.  By the time you order your food there will be a table open and ready for you.  Food comes quickly and is always fantastic.  Super friendly staff too.  Perfect place to head to after the farmers market."}
{"text":"I don't see what the big deal is about this place. I've had brunch there a few times and it was good but not 5 Stars good. The location is great for people that live downtown because there are not a lot of brunch options. The staff is friendly, but it's Madison so the staff is friendly at most places. The prices are good and reasonable. The food is good too, but it's not amazingly good. My girlfriend is crazy about the hash browns. I find them way too greasy. They leave this orangish colored grease streak on your plate that I was never a fan of. Overall, it's a good spot for brunch, but if you are expecting to be blown away, don't.  I would take Mickey's Dairy Bar over Marigold any day of the week...accept Monday because that day Mickey's is closed!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely healthy and awesome. I've never had greens with a omlete, and it was so good!"}
{"text":"The ham and spinach quiche was amazing. The coffee was good. The employees were very helpful and friendly.  I would return to try the other items."}
{"text":"The best grilled cheese I have ever had! (Goat cheese & WI cheddar w/tomato & grilled to perfection!)"}
{"text":"I've never been here for breakfast, so I can't speak to the many negative comments about that. However, their lunch is fantastic! I've eaten there several times, and I've never been disappointed. My last meal there was basically a salade nicoise but with salmon rather than tuna. The haricots verts were snappy, the dressing was excellent, and the fish was perfectly cooked. Yes, the space is a little cramped, but this doesn't matter since the service is fast. If it's too crowded for you you can get in and get out quickly."}
{"text":"Cheerful colors are splashed across the walls and sunshine spills in through the floor-length front windows.  Brightly colored fresh flowers are in delicate vases on every table, offering even more charm to the Marigold Kitchen.    There was no wait at 1pm on this chilly Sunday.  Orders were placed and paid for at the counter and servers promptly delivered the food, tracking you down via a number set on your table.  The brunch menu offered lots of good breakfast options, plenty of which were veg-friendly.  I opted for the inexpensive (at $4.75) and generously portioned eggs/potatoes/toast combo.  The potatoes were a little oily, but nicely seasoned and seemed to have a slight sprinkling of cheese which was a nice touch.   There were only a few lunch options on the brunch menu (none of which were vegetarian), I wished that more of the weekday lunch menu selections were available at weekend brunch-time.  BOTTOM LINE:  Loved the bright and cheerful atmosphere; brunch was great.  A few more lunch choices on the brunch menu (especially a vegetarian choice or two) would make it fantastico!"}
{"text":"Living just two blocks away from this weekend brunch mecca, and having bought a $125 gift card for $100 on my first visit, I really wanted to like this place.   I really, really wanted to.  Food:  Pancakes (Buckwheat, Peach, Buttermilk, etc.): $7-$10 -While they tout using only the freshest and finest ingredients, they don't seem to use enough of them.  The pancakes overall are somewhat bland, and everything tastes similar.  In the end, you're really just eating a maple syrup conveyor.  Duck Confit Hash: $9.95 Judge an ice-cream shop by its vanilla, sure.  But if you put the poultry Inception that is duck confit on the menu, I'm going to try it. -The duck confit was remarkably dry for something that had supposedly been rendered in its own fat, and definitely was not worth even the ten bucks they were asking. -While I was hoping it was made into a hash in order to stretch a small quantity of great duck into a larger serving, it seems that the hash was more a method to hide the fact that you were just being served bits of salty duck.   Ambiance:  The real reason I rated this place so low is because of the overall dining environment.  It would be two stars, were it not for the fact that I know I'm going during their busiest times.  If you come here during the weekend, it will be packed. Chances are, nobody will greet you or explain anything to you, but that's fine as you will have stood in a line by the time you entered the first door.  This line leads directly to the cash register, but does wrap around a pillar that holds the menus, so you can figure out what you want while you watch other people eat. If you decide to grab a seat before ordering (seems reasonable, right?), you will be informed (loudly enough for everyone else in line to get the memo) that guests should please refrain from trying to get seats prior to ordering.  Alright, message received, the cluster' will begin after you pay. You'll order, sit down at the waiting area that is pleasantly placed right next to the restrooms, holding your number tag like a branded cow, and desperately look for the next group to leave (It's best to have any females in the party have a scarf or purse handy to drop on the seat to claim territory, as -from experience- other parties will be doing the exact same thing).  The aforementioned just-okay food will arrive, and you can finally eat.  They bring you your coffee as well, and you can finish your meal in relative peace.  --That is--, unless you arrived at a time that they were so busy, that there was still a line as you were finishing your meal.  In that case, their staff is apparently trained to actually ask you to either finish up your conversation and leave, or migrate to a smaller table so that they can seat another party. Keep in mind, this is about two minutes after you pay your check, and are just trying to drink down the last bit of coffee.  By no means do you need to make any effort to delay your own exit for this wonderful display of hospitality to occur.  What in the absolute hell kind of place, one block away from the Capitol, doesn't have any consistent or fair seating logistic when the line goes out the door, and asks their own patrons to either leave or change tables when they are literally 95% of the way through their meal?   In summary, this location has honestly been a terrible way to start my weekends 3 times out of 4, may be better during weekdays but I do not have the schedule for that, and is really only worth going to if you want to see or be seen by rich housewives taking their preppy children out to brunch."}
{"text":"I've been going to Marigold Kitchen for many years and it is one of my favorite places for breakfast in Madison. The lines can be long on the weekends, but the food is worth the wait. I would highly recommend a short stack of pancakes to share with the table."}
{"text":"Cute spot for breakfast.  Order at counter and they bring food to your table.  I ordered a maple latte and Marigold Breakfast Sandwich.  Fried egg, cheddar-spiked boursin, bacon, tomato and green onion on toasted ciabatta.  It was good but not to die for.  Would return to try some of their other breakfast items."}
{"text":"Probably one of the top two breakfasts to be had in Madison. Fresh, delicious and with lots of choices, as well as healthy options. It's nice to get locally grown food when you eat out so this is a plus for Marigold. Not too expensive either. We paid the same price for breakfast for three that we do at Denny's (a guilty pleasure!)."}
{"text":"My best friend and I have started a Wednesday brunch tradition, and Marigold was our destination today.   I ordered their pancake special, which happened to be toasted coconut pancakes, a strawberry scone, and a cup of coffee. Hands down the best pancakes I have ever had! I usually don't care for overly sweet meals, but I couldn't help myself today. The short stack, which comes with two pancakes instead of four, was plenty! (I definitely would not have been able to eat any more than that).  Tons of berries, toasted coconut flakes, and a big glob of frosting in the middle. To die for!   Everything cost me just over $10, so I would say it's reasonably priced. Super cute little place, not overly busy (even though it was 1pm on a rainy Wednesday so I can't attest to the weekend crowd), and friendly staff. Would love to come back. :)"}
{"text":"What a gem. We had breakfast here Sunday afternoon - the daily scramble came with leeks and veggies and whipped herbed ricotta. Potatoes were fantastic and definitely try the jams. Relaxed place to have brunch."}
{"text":"I can't believe I still haven't written a review on this delicious cute brunch place in Madison. Perhaps it is the long wait that has delayed my writing as well. Marigold is a gem in Madison, almost every item on the menu I've tried I enjoyed. I also really like the pastries they have - the scones are my favorite.  I wouldn't suggest this as a place for groups, 4 would be the maximum I would go with. Do be prepared to wait, they are small, and they are very VERY popular. However, the new system makes the waiting much more civilized.  1) Order at the counter 2) The waiter/waitress host will let you know when your seat is available.   I love the potatoes. very very very good. Breakfast sandwich - get it with the sunny side up and your world is complete. Duck confit salad - very good price and very nice and soft meat. oh so flavorful  I tried the chilquiles but I was disappointed that my chips were soggy.... The flavor was good but soggy chips are NOT MY THING :( I would definitely ask for chips on the side in the future....  So, come by with a small group, get the potatoes. wonderful breakfast! yes, it is available weekdays too!!"}
{"text":"We love having brunch here. My advice is to get here early as you can to avoid a long wait in line and missing out on a seat. The french toast and omelettes are a couple favorites."}
{"text":"Tried Marigolds at the recommendation of our waitress at Graze (up the street) and was pretty impressed by the food. The sidewalk seating is nice in the morning and they did a great job of getting our food out quickly. I had the breakfast sandwich (fried egg, cheddar-spiked boursin, applewood smoked bacon, tomato and green onion on toasted ciabatta for $6.50) which was delicious and definitely big enough for a good breakfast.   Pros: fresh food, fast service Cons: busy on weekends, OJ a bit overpriced"}
{"text":"The skillets are wonderful, unless of course your looking for something baked, then the specialty pancakes are simply fantastic.  Scones and baked goods are pretty much like everyone else's.  Bottomless coffee, crowded dining room, tons of atmosphere-- make this a 'must do' breakfast place in Madison.    Only downside...no Wi-Fi --  but it's more fun talking to you neighbor anyway!"}
{"text":"\"Don't believe the hype\" -- Public Enemy  My friend Blair texted me like 15 minutes after I woke up with: \"I am starving. Feel like early lunch, round 11, near the Capitol.\" If you haven't guessed from my 130 Yelp reviews, I love to eat, so even though I had a lot to do today, I said \"yes\" and really looked forward to it because of all the \"buzz\" and hype around MK.  Unfortunately, I found the place just didn't meet expectations, even though nothing was unobjectionable. I got the short stack and eggs, and there was nothing particularly amazing about this batter. Moreover, they suffer from The Harvest Problem - ridiculously small portions (in this case, circumference of pancake), though the prices are fair. Nothing exceptional to the eggs -- no seasoning, no creative mix of oils. My friend's egg salad was also so-so according to her.  Last, and this isn't a problem with just MK, but the acoustics make it really hard to have a regular-volume conversation. This is common with many capitol restaurants and has something to do with the architecture, lack of sound-absorbent material around.   Again: there's nothing 'bad' about MK, but there's nothing exceptional about it. Is it worth waiting in the lines that frequently form at \"peak\" lunch/brunch hours? I don't think so. And I think those lines also contribute to unwarranted buzz that the place must be great because the demand is so high. Long-term real estate prices in 2007, anyone?"}
{"text":"Breakfast sandwich was fantastic.  Cappuccino, too.   I passed on the free hotel breakfast to find a real one and am so glad I did!  I happened to find the Marigold Kitchen using Yelp.  It was a perfect breakfast at 7:00 AM to begin my drive to Minneapolis.    I'm leaving with an Americano for the road."}
{"text":"Good food and great ambiance.  Quaint little place.  Great spot to stop at when you are done walking around the capitol for the Farmers Market.  Madison excels at breakfast so I can't say this is the best place but its worth a try."}
{"text":"I visited twice in a two day span for breakfast while in town for business. Food was consistently good if not spectacular. Breakfast options include mostly standard fare,.with fresh and local ingredients emphasized. Second morning they were out of the special, a duck confit hash, by midmorning. I went for the scrambler with chorizo and roasted peppers and it was ok, with eggs on the watery side. The orange marmalade was good...nice difference from standard jams."}
{"text":"I was in town for a business meeting for a week and discovered Marigold's on the last two days July 16-17, 2011.  The breakfast was phenomenal.  I had a duck hash with dropped eggs and the second meal was their scrambler.  Both meals were cooked very well, and the service was surprisingly quick, considering how packed the restaurant was.  The staff were also very nice, and they have a nice side street location....."}
{"text":"It was good, but didn't impress me as much as the other breakfast place I've tried in Madison (Cafe Continental) considering the prices.  I got the smoked salmon eggs benedict, and it wasn't half bad, but at the price I would have expected better.  The eggs were too hard to be called poached.  The OJ was fresh-squeezed and great, but for $3.50 I would have expected more than the tiny cup it came in (I'm a spoiled Californian where oranges fall out of the sky).  I'd come back, but I'd get what my friends got; the omelets and scrambles were much more reasonably priced and looked delicious."}
{"text":"The service here is impeccable. My son changed his mind on his order after seeing someone else's plate. His original order was almost done. The waitress made the change without any hesitation. That kind of service on a super busy day shows her true character.   The food was good as well. The Almond Hazelnut Mocha is heaven in a cup. I'm not a big breakfast person, but I would go back just for that drink.   I will say the negative remarks on here almost scared me into not trying the place. But I think it's worth a try to find out for yourself."}
{"text":"This capital-area brunch and breakfast spot is perfect for catching up with girlfriends over a warm cup of coffee and stack of pancakes. The hipster-chic, cute dining area is perfectly complemented with exceptional food and great service.  It shouldn't be any surprise to the customer that Marigold is always so busy! Its location, food quality and service all help explain why you might need to wait a few minutes for a table. However, in my experience it has always been well worth the wait."}
{"text":"So on my first visit to Marigold I had very high expectations. I have to say that most all of them were met. This place is pretty cool! I was here at 10 AM on a Saturday and we got a table right away. My mom and I both ordered a Cafe Miel and Chipotle Chorizo Scone to start our meal. The lattes were amazing, definitely one of the best I've had. The scone was also delicious - not dry at all and the melted cheese on top was divine.   For my meal I ordered the special Asiago and Herb Crusted French Toast. Here's where my only issue came. When my plate came there were no fig preserves on it. However I was so hungry that I didn't even notice until after I was done eating! My plate was clean, when I saw another order come out that had fig preserves. Bummer because it probably would have made it that much more delicious! It was clearly yummy enough either way as I finished my plate pretty quick. The Arugula salad was a great complement to the rich french toast.  My mom ordered the Tofu Scrambler and enjoyed her meal as well. The ambiance of this place is really cute and homey. I guess I'll just have to return and try the dish as its' supposed to be eaten, hopefully they don't forget the jam this time."}
{"text":"Slightly upscale breakfast place with a little more casual atmosphere. It's a bit over-hyped.   Very busy on a Saturday morning and inside of restaurant was very warm (not enough A/C?)  Green tea was nice. I like that it was served with a tea pot and the hot water was self serve   The sweet potato&kale hash was great. Would have been amazing if there was other options on the table besides Tabasco. The greens were a great addition.   The Whole Grain Soy Sauté was okay...It was a small dish. Could barely taste the whole grain in there (would be great if there was more barley and quinoa in it). The mushrooms in the dish were great, but overall the taste wasn't anything spectacular. Would have loved a side of potatoes to go with it--or even toast--to make it more of a breakfast feel."}
{"text":"Messed up my order, over charged me, and the counter staff was rude. Thanks for making my birthday memorable!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite brunch places. First time I went, the line was out the door. Most times though, it's just a little crowded. I guess that's what happens when they're not open on Sundays. Usually by the time you order, you can get a seat. And if not, they're pretty organized about getting everyone seated before their food is ready. I only get the scrambler because the Marigold potatoes are my absolute favorite, but my friends love the pancakes and the breakfast sandwich."}
{"text":"Breakfast is BOSS.  Marigold is fantastic for business coffee or breakfast. If there's a \"deal on the table\"...you'll be setting yourself up for success over Marigold breakfast.  This restaurant was opened by the same team that owns Sardine Restaurant (Willy St) and Gates and Brovi (Monroe St) and it is a sparkling, but small, gem.   MK doesn't receive 5 stars because major congestion can accumulate at the registers and mobility will be of major concern. This also occurs at various times in the dining space due to close proximity of the tables.   The toast can be burned around the edges at times, but I have no qualms with it...slab a little egg yolk or jam on them, and you won't notice (plus, it's toast, deal with it).   If you're a brunch aficionado, you understand some types of breakfast potatoes can flavor-cover your tongue and make your coffee taste a bit funky. This is the case with MK, but again, I haven't been phased by it.  Their seasonal pancake selection is EVERYTHING, and their coffee is often on point. Usually, during quieter crowd times, I am able to grab a coffee, sit and sip while I wait for my late-arriving group, or mull over food decisions, then head back to the register, order, and pay.   Other food recommendations include the MK breakfast sandwich is always a tasty fall-back. As with the toast, you want to make sure the bread is properly toasted, or I would recommend the poached egg prosciutto with rosemary toast..  Now stop readying, and go eat some MK breakfast!!!"}
{"text":"Wow, what a madhouse! We came here at around 10am on a Saturday morning, and literally every available space in the restaurant was filled with people standing, waiting for a table. Apparently that is the standard state of affairs, so if extreme crowds are not your thing I would suggest staying away from the Marigold Kitchen. Once we did eventually place our order and sit down, all was good. My pumpkin spice pancakes were undercooked, so I want to try to give this place another shot when it is less busy."}
{"text":"I am in town with a big group and we were starving, so I yelped and we headed to Marigold for brunch/lunch/whatever. I didn't know it would be the order at the counter type of joint but that was fine with me, I love places like that. The atmosphere was cozy and cute albeit LOUD. It was hard to hear people at the other end of our table. I loved the menu - full of fresh dairy and produce from the land of cheese! I had an omelet with veggies and cheese, with salad, wheat toast and fruit. It was delicious. And a nice sized portion - enough for me (I am a big eater), but not so much that I was stuffed when I finished. The salad was awesome, the dressing was so light and it was the perfect amount. And the fruit was light on gross melon. Bueno.   I would say the only thing I didn't like was that in our group the food took a widely varying time to come out - I would estimate that the first person got her food maybe 15 minutes before the last person. That is somewhat rude. Otherwise I would definitely come back all the time if I lived here, and next time I'm in town I will come back!"}
{"text":"I am a fan of breakfast. Especially unique, high quality options in an eclectic environment. Marigold's delivers. In fact, I am hesitant to try other breakfast options. We went to a local crepe place in Madison this weekend. They did a decent job but it was not a breakfast I would return for. If you want a menu that varies but holds on to local favorites, and has excellent coffee/latte/etc options, even mimosa's on Sundays (maybe everyday, we always go on Sunday morning) give this place a try. They have a to go option but I love getting a spot at the counter and feeling the breakfast vibe! Your plate arrives with the kind of breakfast you want to make at home-and it only gets better when someone makes it for you!!"}
{"text":"This place is a headache.  I went on a Saturday morning for brunch and there was so much noise and hustle.  Definitely did not like that aspect.  The food is good.  I ordered French toast and a scrambler to share.  The French toast came with fresh fruit and tasted super yummy.  The scrambler portion was small, but very tasty!  Perhaps the potatoes were too drenched in oil because they were orange in color.    The service is decent.  The girls at the register are nicer.  I would like to return, but on a quieter day."}
{"text":"The food is good. Place is cozy.  Everything's a bit expensive.  The smell inside is heavenly. Lots of hipsters and groups of Sophmore/Junior UW girls.  Try the weekend brunch. Try the pumpkin pancakes. Try anything from the omelette lineup."}
{"text":"Really good food and coffee (I got lemon ricotta pancakes) but they have a bad seating system. They were super busy so you order at the counter and then stand on the side until there's an open table. My friend's food was cold but still really good. Weird service but I'd still recommend going here."}
{"text":"Love it! Such Amazing Food!!!  Breakfast sandwich is wonderful and service is delightful. Came here while in town for just a few days and sort of fell in love with the atmosphere.   Lovely food and people. Coffee and tea is top notch and everything on the menu is fresh/creative/organic/local. The prices are also very reasonable considering the portions."}
{"text":"Just stopping in yesterday morning.  I haven't been in a couple of years, so it was exciting to return.   We ordered the chile poached eggs on toast with coffee.  Presentation was beautiful, 2 perfect white eggs with chile flakes.  It looked amazing but size wise I was a little disappointed.  Food tasted perfect.  Coffee was perfect.   Overall glad for the visit but a little bummed that it was not a WOW experience."}
{"text":"Nice brunch atmosphere, friendly service. Welcoming to kids. Very good quiche. Potatoes a little spicier than expected."}
{"text":"I like this place most for its high-quality food, variety of options, and cozy atmosphere. They serve great vegetarian options, but I hear their angus burger is really good.   It's a warm, unpretentious, and civilized place to meet with friends, and eat good food. If you're a student the price range may not fall within your list of daily go-to places, but it would definitely be top on my list if I am looking for a nice place to go with friends or family.   P.S. The coffee is delicious and unlimited!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch while visiting the university.  There is only one vegetarian sandwich on the menu, but its delicious. I was skeptical of something with beets, curried chickpeas, and apples, but it turned out that those flavors go together perfectly."}
{"text":"All around positive Saturday morning Brunch experience here. Yes, there was a line-but the wait was not bad-friendly gal distributed menus and managed crowd well. Once inside, the folks taking the order were super-efficient and Madison friendly. My son ordered the breakfast sandwich, my wife had an omelette and I did the standard 2 eggs over easy. The potatoes were amazing, eggs great, fresh-squeezed OJ delicious, sandwich and omelette got rave reviews. The experience eating here was perfect. Everything a breakfast should be. Can't wait to go back again next UW visit."}
{"text":"I love this place, but today, I got a to-go order and my soup was only 2/3 filled. Not happy."}
{"text":"Terrific food and great atmosphere. Excellent egg nog latte, fabulous scrambled eggs and tasty breakfast potatoes. I love breakfast and this was outstanding."}
{"text":"I love the food at this restaurant so much I would've given it five stars if I could rate the food apart from other aspects of the restaurant. I knocked it down one because one gripe is that the line to even order can extend out the door. And once you've ordered, it may take a short wait to get a table if it is significantly busy, which is usually the case. I guess that is an artifact of having food that people want. I also prefer a restaurant that is a bit more spacious, quiet and has more private feeling seating. (E.g, booth seating). For many people I understand that these things will not be an issue. It also doesn't necessarily deter me from coming to this restaurant but once I'm done eating I usually leave immediately. You can't go wrong with the French toast. Nor can you go wrong with the egg sandwich spiked with Boursin."}
{"text":"I wasn't too satisfied when I first came to Marigold Kitchen for a Sunday brunch. Even though we were told over the phone that the crowds \"weren't that bad,\" it was a complete shitshow in there. Busboys fighting through the crowds to get to tables, a line going from the counter to the door, background noise so loud that you have to scream what you want to order, and a restaurant that was way too small to contain it all. They haven't done a very good job at all managing these crowds and maximizing their available space.  Not helping Marigold is the fact that you have to order your food from the counter and take a number, and that they can't even be bothered to bring your drinks out to you. I had to get water from a jug on a table placed in the worst spot imaginable (right next to the counter), where I couldn't even move my elbows. And despite the massive line, the girl taking orders at the counter didn't seem to have any issue with having a long conversation with anyone who was placing an order.   While ordering from a counter would ultimately save you money on tip, the savings are balanced out by the price of the food itself. You'll pay just as much as you would for sit-down service at another breakfast joint.  So, given the abhorrent service, you're probably wondering how my rating is so high. The fact is, when you serve food this good, you can abuse your customers like this and they'll enjoy it. Seriously, this is some of the best breakfast food I have ever had.  I ordered a special called \"The Scrambler,\" which was scrambled eggs mixed up with cheese and vegetables. The eggs were cooked perfectly, with a fluffy consistency that is practically nonexistent at any other restaurant. I also got French rosemary toast and their signature \"Marigold Potatoes\" on the side.   While the toast was unique, it wasn't anything special. The potatoes were incredible. I don't know what they do to them to make them so soft and so crispy at the same time, or what spices made them taste so perfect. You have to try it, and fortunately, it comes with almost every dish they serve.  I also ordered some thick and fluffy buttermilk pancakes which were topped with a sweet mango butter. However, they served it with a pathetic amount of syrup. I had to substitute the lack of sweetness with the jam on the table, which was incredibly fresh. It was definitely made in the restaurant, without the addition of massive amounts of sugar.  The jam is like every other ingredient Marigold uses. Everything tastes fresh and organic, like they were growing the food right there in their kitchen. The prices and crowds here are easily justified by the fact that when you order food from Marigold Kitchen, you know that they're going to serve you nothing but food made from the very highest quality of ingredients."}
{"text":"Amazing place for breakfast. Lovely environment, nice music on the background and delicious food. I had the bacon spinach omelet and it was amazing. I loved the homemade potatoes as a side."}
{"text":"Superb breakfast. French toast was excellent.  Rest of the table had the daily specials.  They were also impressive."}
{"text":"I would call marigold kitchen a typical hipster farm to table restaurant. But the food is excellent. It's alway very busy, so give yourself plenty of time."}
{"text":"I've had several friends highly recommend the Marigold Kitchen, so we decided to try it for lunch this week. We got there a little before noon and there was a line to the door. Ordering takes place a the counter and they have menus to peruse while you are waiting in line. The menu consists of breakfast items as well as sandwiches, salads, and soups for lunch. I decided on the Marigold Italian: Salami, Spicy Capicola ham, aioli, provolone, and frisée with a pickled vegetable relish on a toasted baguette. We arrived at the counter, placed our order, got a number, and found a table to wait for our drinks and meals to arrive.  My companion had the Mushroom and Provolone Grilled Cheese: roasted mushroom relish, basil walnut pesto, and roasted tomato on grilled rustic bread and said it was very good. My sandwich arrived and was accompanied by a purple slaw with a light vinaigrette. The slaw was pretty and fresh but definitely needed some lemon juice and salt to jazz it up a bit. My sandwich looked great, lot of fresh, quality ingredients, but when I bit into it, I tasted something salty, bitter, and off-tasting. I opened my sandwich and realized there were dozens of chopped olives. Perhaps I should have realized pickled vegetable relish meant olives but unfortunately I did not. (I was picturing pickled peppers, carrots, cauliflower, etc) I don't think of olives as being a vegetable. I have a strong dislike of olives and if I would have realized olives were on the sandwich I never would have ordered it. I tried my best to pick them off but I kept biting into them buried in the frisée or the aioli. This pretty much ruined the sandwich and the meal for me.  If you are not a picky eater, you'll probably enjoy the Marigold Kitchen. The food was fresh, the servers polite. I was just disappointed by the olive surprise."}
{"text":"Duck confit hash, meet my stomach. Stomach, meet duck confit hash.  Every weekend, a new place pops up to contend for the prestigious \"best brunch Peter has ever had in Madison\" award, and Marigold has put everyone on notice.  From their freshly roasted endless coffee, to their rich, fatty duck confit, to the crispy, thin potato skins, to the warm, buttery milk pancakes, each and every dish was executed to perfection.   While I loved my dish, the French Toast some of my friends got definitely caught my eyes (brunch next weekend, anyone?).   This place doesn't have too much seating, so try getting here early and grabbing a spot.   All in all, another fantastic location to add to my ever growing list of must try brunch places in Madison."}
{"text":"This place delicious, went for breakfast while in Madison. House made chai was tasty (sweet but not too sweet). Had the specials..scramble with sausage, mushrooms and tomato. So good! Potatoes are really good. Husband had the granola pancakes and those were really good as well."}
{"text":"This restaurant is very cute and is very popular for brunch on Sundays.  Someone recommended this restaurant to me, and I am very glad that she did!   I went around 1130 on a Sunday and it was pretty crowded.  The hostess doesn't seat you at this restaurant,  you actually look over the menu and the specials boards, order at the register and then they bring your food out to you, wherever you find seating .  This is actually a pretty great setup, but my group only consisted of three people, with more people you may have a harder time getting enough seats, as the restaurant is not very big. They do also have outside seating, but it was mostly 4 person tables outside.  They have great brunch choices, complete with any brunch worthy alcoholic beverage. I had a mimosa (yum!) and we also got a glass of the fresh strawberry lemonade (super yum! And you can actually add alcohol to it if you'd like). I ordered one of their epic sounding omelettes and it was actually one of the best omelettes that I have ever had. Service was great, everyone was totally friendly. Overall a really great place to grab brunch.  I would recommend it to anyone hanging around in Madison. This is also very close to the Capitol, so the view and location are terrific!"}
{"text":"Every time we visit, food has been consistently good!!! We had the chorizo omelet and the cocoa pancake. Both were wonderful. The cocoa pancake was a chocolate lovers dream!! It came streaming hot and it taste perfect. The service is fast and friendly."}
{"text":"I've been going to Marigold since it opened and am a fan.  I love their french toast and when they have it, pancakes with the marscapone cheese.  YUM.    Their eggs and potatoes and toast are also good and cheap.  Totally worth it.  Get the sourdough.  I think the french toast, the scramblers and most other dishes are overpriced.  Hence the reason why I usually just get the eggs sans meat.  I guess it isn't really a Marigold thing, most restaurants in Madison seem to be overpriced.    I do appreciate their cheap, tasty kids meals for the kiddos.  $1.95!    They could seriously improve their customer service.  I've had issues with gift cards, them forgetting my order completely and they are ALWAYS messing up an order.  These aren't special orders--just whatever is on the menu, no subs.  They do not go out of their way to make things right because as everyone else says, they are always packed.  I wish that they would re-think their ordering system.  It's fine IF everyone knows to not grab a table until you have ordered!  Otherwise, you are standing there with your food with no seat."}
{"text":"Unimpressed with the grilled chicken salad. Chicken was dry with no seasonings and burnt on the edges. Vinegrette was bland and they didn't put enough on the salad. Not a reasonable portion size for the $12 it cost. Many better places to choose from around the Capitol."}
{"text":"The last time I checked out the menu for Marigold, it didn't look like there were a lot of options for a Madison vegan... well, I went with friends for brunch, and I had grapefruit juice, the tofu scramble, and the almond mocha latte and was satisfied and happy (I did steal some fried potatoes from my husband.) The scramble was delicious with avocado added. My omni friends and family were very happy (kids can split a short stack!) I will most definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I was more impressed the second time around. I still wouldn't say the BEST brunch place but it is pretty good. I ordered a classic American breakfast, two eggs, toast and potatoes. The eggs were cooked well and the potatoes were pretty tasty. I visited a few days before Christmas and they were handing out free egg nog which packed quite an alcoholic punch."}
{"text":"Wonderful restaurant - great food and fun lively atmosphere.  It is alwasy busy unless you can wait til after 1pm for lunch.  The space was designed by the same architect who designed the rest of the block.    I especially love the salads and burgers.  The flavor can't be beat."}
{"text":"i felt very blah about my food.  i feel bad because i wasn't in the best of mood for brunch food, but am trying to rate without that in mind.  now, mind my snobiness, but we have some damn good brunch in chicago, and unfortunately this place just couldn't live up to my windy city standards.  the pancakes were good but a bit flat for my taste - as in, not poofy.  i know this is the new pancake fashion, flat cakes with compote of some sort, but it wasn't wow-ing.  the potatoes were okay, extremely greasy and IMO not seasoned well, instead depending on its spicy greasy sauce instead.  whatever.  anyway, the boyfriend seemed to enjoy my pancakes much more than i did, but wasn't thrilled with his special scrambler.  unfortunately it was made with lots of green onion and the potatoes have them, as well, so it was a little too much green onion overall.  the jam sitting out on the table was delicious and coffee was good, too.  overall good, but not wowing."}
{"text":"So, we came to Madison for a day and we had heard great news about this place. The line was relatively long but it went by quick. The entire staff were super friendly and that was a plus. We had to wait to be seated since it was a full house, we were in no rush, ultimately, but when we sat down and waited nearly 40 minutes, that's we stayed getting impatient. I'm not a big meal person for breakfast, so I was highly upset that I waited that long for some pancakes  the service was excellent tho!!"}
{"text":"I had a tasty, healthy lunch here! I had a tuna melt sandwich with the red cabbage slaw, and my friend had the beetnik with potato salad. I was looking for something hearty and found that the tuna melt definitely satisfied my craving. The tuna tasted pretty fresh, and the sandwich had just the right amount of cheese. The red cabbage slaw was fresh and crunchy.  The environment is cozy, warm, and well-decorated. It was pretty busy during lunchtime.  Her beetnik looked delicious, and I was trying to go back on a Saturdday to try it out... but then I forgot that it was brunch on weekends during lunchtime! Foiled."}
{"text":"Marigold Kitchen is a solid lunch location.  The staff are nice, the restaurant ambiance is pleasant, and the food is really quite good for the price.  The only thing I wish for the lunch menu is that there were a few more vegetarian options.  Though the vegetarian options they do have are delicious and keep me coming back."}
{"text":"I go to bed looking forward to breakfast. If someone informs me that they do not eat breakfast-- I take that as an open invitation to force my belief of the importance of breakfast upon them.   That being said, I'm a creature of habit. I have the same things each morning and RARELY will give them up for eggs, omelettes, scramblers, etc., which often leave me feeling full, lethargic, and disappointed.  Enter Marigold Kitchen: Your breakfast sandwich is amazing (fried egg, cheddar-spiked boursin, applewood smoked bacon, tomato and green onion on toasted ciabatta). It's the perfect combination of all the right flavors. Greasy? Heavy? Absolutely not. Incredibly rich? Yes.  It will be crowded on Saturday and Sunday mornings, but the staff does a surprisingly good job at moving people through and clearing tables."}
{"text":"Chaotic and poor service.... Better yet no service. Cashier was rude and unhelpful. Great food or not won't be returning."}
{"text":"AMAZING!!!  The scrambler is unmatched and those marigold potatoes... Wow. You must go here."}
{"text":"Great vibes! It's fun to watch the line cooks busy behind the counter.   My man and I split the duck confit, which was delicious but pretty pricey for the portion size. The ingredients were all cooked perfectly and the flavors were well-balanced. The dressing for the greens had a nice acidity to offset the richness of the eggs. A good choice for those who like a savory breakfast. I would recommend getting toast on the side.  I would also highly recommend trying a signature coffee drink. The Cafe Miel was warm, comforting, and just sweet enough. The mint espresso drink (the name is escaping me) is also delicious.   And if you're a sucker for pastries like I am, they have really good scones!"}
{"text":"Counter service only, coffee shop with GREAT breakfast!  Best potatoes I've ever had at a restaurant. Huge omelette well stuffed. Generous portions. Salmon frittata with lots of greens on top. Great bread."}
{"text":"Love the food - not a fan of the atmosphere though.  The blueberry pancakes with the orange butter are fabulous and have completely changed the way I make pancakes at home.  I also love the breakfast sandwich - so good!  The one thing I don't like about the place is how loud it is - the acoustics of the place just seem to amplify everything and it gets too loud for me to really enjoy if it's super busy."}
{"text":"Solid brunch spot. It's always crowded on the weekends so expect a line.  They're famous for the potatoes which are good but very very oily. They're flavoring comes mostly from being slathered in chili oil or something like that but they're a little crispy as well which is why I like them.   I got the chili poached eggs once which is a really small serving but tasted better than okay.   The three grain saute is good, a little oily.   I rarely get sandwiches from anywhere, but I loved Marigold's hearty sandwiches before I was a vegetarian."}
{"text":"Run,  don't walk!  Found this place, on Yelp, to put something yummy in our tummies after visiting the Dells. Happy to say,  we scored.   You can choose to order off the menu- you can grab one as you walk in- or off the special board above the register,  either way,  you can't miss.   Started with a YUMMY and naturally alkalizing Switchel. Refreshing!  Ordered the quiche, which was delicious, though I like my eggs with a bit more salt and a side of greens, really tasty and fresh.  The chilaquiles were also delish, added a little hot sauce for an extra kick and a side of perfectly spiced potatoes (just a touch on the spicy side), yes, I'm a wimp.   Left with one of the best latte's I've ever had. All in all, great choice if you enjoy real food and a cool staff.  Prices are comparable and fair. We will be back!"}
{"text":"First time here, even though I walk by it almost every day.  So glad I finally stopped for breakfast before Farmer's Market.   The place had excellent chilaquiles.  We also shared toasted almond pancakes which were wonderful."}
{"text":"Yummmmmm! I am a fan of this place! I think it definitely beats out basset street brunch and is equally as good as lazy janes.  Come early! Or just find the right time in between the rush because this place will have a line out the door before you know it and you'll be standing against the walls waiting for your food instead of at a table. Speaking of food--  I got the scrambler which changes/has additions depending on the day. Originally i really wanted to try the monte cristo after reading some reviews but alas that was the special sandwich for the day and they had moved along. Sooo note! Don't get attached to the special....   The scrambler was good! Potatoes were super tasty as well as the salad on the side. Portion was decent, I think it was probably the perfect size, but man was I hungry. So I def wanted more. I liked all the veggies in it and honestly I think it just needed a little more cheese. The OJ was super fresh and delish so def get it   My friend got the duck confit hash and that was super tasty! A little fatty but come on, that's what gives it the flavor. I'll be back to try more menu items but so far I'm a fan!   Happy brunching!"}
{"text":"I often have breakfast at Marigold Kitchen on my trips to Madison. The place still does not disappoint. The food is fresh and the breakfast dishes innovative. For a cholesterol break, I have their tofu scramble. And yes, they make tofu tasty. It's a great place to sit and sip a latte and read the morning paper before the hectic day begins."}
{"text":"Omelette with pesto sauce was delicious but fairly small for the $13 price. Highly recommend the fruit cup sub.. very fresh and nice size for small upcharge. Poppyseed Scone was super hard and dry. Mimosas are tasty as well."}
{"text":"Cheery decor. Partly self serve. High prices. Not too extensive a menu. Good coffee. Pleasant service. Chilaquiles were not very good; overcooked and too much cheese. Don't understand why this place is so well rated."}
{"text":"Voted best breakfast in Madison in 2015, and I can say that it definitely lived up to the hype!   Don't let the long line deter you. You order at the counter, grab your number, and then wait for the hostess to seat you. I found this very appealing because you don't have everyone scrambling to grab a table or people breathing down your neck while you're eating; instead the hostess handles it! Problem solved.   I ordered the half order of the Buckwheat pancakes, which was only $4! The pancakes themselves were good, and they were topped with candied pecans and bananas, but the cinnamon butter was the STAR of the show. My goodness, that butter plus a little syrup made the whole dish something out of my wildest dreams. I also ordered the cold brew coffee (made from Colectivo!) for $3 and was such a happy camper!   Delicious Food + Cheap Prices = Repeat Visit.  I would easily come back here for brunch over and over again."}
{"text":"This place is easy to miss, but once you're in, you're hooked.  Cafe style ordering, with ordering at the counter, taking a number.  Nice part - wait staff checks on you once seated.  Now onto the gold part of marigold...Beet sandwich was so fresh and delicious tasting.  The portobello mushroom sandwich was the perfectly cheesy, yet light.  All the salads are pretty damn good.  Bloody Mary's are spicy and not too salty.  Coffee tastes fresh and is local.  All in all, a great place to grab a bite to eat, have brunch, or just chow down/sip while enjoying your paper.  There was a huge lunch rush around 1pm and it got packed fast, so either come before or after."}
{"text":"Duck hash, oatmeal and coffee were all good. Not a bad place for some nice brunch."}
{"text":"Best breakfast!  Marigold makes the most lovely egg dishes, complete with lightly dressed fresh greens, toast, and potatoes.  Their sourdough bread is an absolute winner.  They cook eggs to perfection:  done but soft, delightfully flavored by creative combinations of ingredients.  My favourite breakfast and brunch spot in Madison, and one of my top places in the world.  (I'm kind of a major breakfast groupie.)"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite brunch place in Madison.   Marigold Kitchen has different specials from season to season and changes pretty often. Most of these specials are pretty good. As for their regular brunch menu, I think my favorite items from here are their omelettes, and I do believe I've tried them all. They offer healthy and appetizing ingredients, and somehow they just make them better than other places. My favorite is the one with zucchini and goat cheese. Other than the omelettes, the french toast and the quiches here are also scrumptious.   I've never been here on a weekday, but I can assure you that brunch on Saturdays and Sundays requires you to wait quite a bit. Try to go before 10 AM or after 2 PM."}
{"text":"Delicious!!! Very friendly staff... thank you for offering vegan options! The beet and Fuji Thai Peanut sandwich was amazing!  We were passing by Madison on a road trip and I called in my order and we were able swing by to pick it up and keep on our way. Parking was a bit tricky though, just be aware it is downtown and that always makes parking interesting!"}
{"text":"As for brunch in Madison, I go to Mickie's when I am on a budget and near UW campus; travel to Original Pancake House on the west side if I am hungry and look for a family friendly relaxed setting. But when craving for good brunch food, Marigold Kitchen is my only choice.   I always have mixed feeling about the humongous brunch in other places. On the one hand, it is good bang of my buck; on the other hand, it makes me over-eat and sleep in food coma afterwards. I found Marigold serve just enough food that really energizes me after my weekend brunch.   I have had French toast, scrambler, and omelette in Marigold, and they are just much more delicate than other brunch places in town. The French toast is definitely among the top 3 I had in my life. So much is said about this place in previous reviews, and I do not have too much to add.   If you have not been to this place, get in line and give it a try!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot! Awesome vibe and space. We had the stuffed peppers which were amazing and so filling, and the sweet potato kale pesto hash which had lots of awesome flavors put together. Highly recommended place. We wish we could have had more room for some of the bakery options that looked delicious too."}
{"text":"This place is excellent. The food is delicious and very reasonably priced, considering the ingredients. I had the breakfast sandwich, which was very tasty and enough to satisfy a healthy appetite! I also had the orange juice, which was fresh squeezed and super good. The raves about the blueberry pancakes are spot-on! My boyfriend ordered these, and they're so good. The citrus butter is a great touch. It does have alcohol because you can get drinks like greyhounds and mimosas. I'd highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"The food is the best brunch in town, the coffee is wonderful, and the mimosas/greyhounds are delicious.  I love to come here for the ambiance. The music is fun and cheerful, and the interior is sunny. The servers are positive and helpful.  I think the model of ordering before you're seated is genius. Don't be scared off if it looks busy-- the line moves very quickly. You won't have to wait more than 10 minutes.  Protip: You MUST have the Marigold potatoes. They are God's gift to breakfast."}
{"text":"For whatever reason we expected a tired old diner with good food, boy were we wrong. Marigold is a hip, happening place with great food. We both had chilaquiles, excellent! The plates on the tables next to us looked great too. Looking forward to another visit!"}
{"text":"My son lived in Madison for the last 2 years and took me here, saying it was his favorite breakfast spot. I dunno. Food is creative. I found it crowded and too hip. Duck confit hash was not as good as I expected. Fresh squeezed orange juice was nice, as was the green tea. Maybe 4 stars on a good day."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in Madison...HANDS DOWN! The eggs are unreal. Wish I knew the secret ingredient in the scrambled! My favorite, however, are the chile poached eggs. They are so incredible! A small portion that I like to pair with a short-stack of their specialty pancaked with mascarpone.   Prices are rather steep but once - or twice - in a while it's definitely okay to treat yourself to a Marigold breakfast."}
{"text":"Almost every time I eat at Marigold, I walk away unsatisfied. It's one of those places that some of my friends love, but is simply just not for me.  For instance, I tried their Tuna Melt today for lunch. It was edible, but not one of the better I've had. I didn't like the sweetness of the house-made pickles, nor the sliced tomato under the melted cheese. I didn't even get a hint of rosemary from the bread. I make a much better Tuna Melt at home with very minimal effort. The arugula salad on the side was fine, as was the cabbage salad. But, did I mention that this meal was $11? For it's averageness, it would be better priced at perhaps $8-9. I opted for the free water to keep my meal at a decent price.  My friend ordered one of their lunch specials (some sort of salad with beans and prosciutto) and also felt the $11 price was a bit much.  I've been more happy with brunch at Marigold, but never really felt like lunch was worth my time or money.   For brunch, I do like the their omelets, and their Chili Braised Chicken Sandwich is quite tasty. I've ordered their pancakes and their house-made granola, and those were both okay.  Overall, this is a decent place to eat once in awhile when someone suggests it. Otherwise...meh."}
{"text":"A very unique menu with a lot of out of the box breakfast options. I had the chorizo omelette and it was delicious, but the potatoes stole the show. Crispy and very flavorful. A friend had the duck hash and that was great, but the scrambler and the bacon omelette were a bit disappointing to the others dining with us. They serve bloody Marys during brunch and those also weren't great...especially at $7 each  This is a restaurant where customers order at the counter and serve themselves for drinks/coffee then are given a # and a member of the staff brings your food out. So, not full service and it can get busy making finding a table tricky.    Overall, it was decent but pretty expensive. For two of us, our meal was $45 (including one cocktail). Pretty pricey for \"just OK\" food."}
{"text":"Came here for Saturday brunch and narrowly missed the rush (got there 11ish)! Pretty much as soon as we got our food (which was quick), a line had started to form. I imagine the cold morning had discouraged people from getting there too early.  My friend and I both got the French toast and loved it. We got two different espresso drinks off the overhead coffee menu, and they were both delicious as well.   The ambience was nice and cozy, and the staff were very friendly."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast on a Saturday morning around 10AM- basically your peak business time. The line from the counter went all the way to the from door, and we almost walked away, but a leaving patron told us the line went quickly, so we decided to wait it out. To her point, the line did move quickly. Within 10 minutes we had ordered, and only had to wait a few minutes to grab a table for four. The interior is downright adorable, very rustic-chic. It was a little loud in the space but hey, it was packed.   Both my fella & I got the breakfast sandwich, which did not disappoint. Fried egg, bacon, tomato, and an amazing gooey cheese on a really fresh roll. I love breakfast sandwiches, and if they aren't great, it's often because the sandwich feels bogged down by grease. This was NOT the case at Marigold! This was so light and fresh, the bread was delicious, bacon was crisp, and everything tasted great. Fairly big sandwich, definitely worth the $8 price tag. We also got mimosas which were a tad weak, but otherwise tasted great. I would absolutely come here again!"}
{"text":"Marigold kitchen is a consistently good brunch place. I've  been many times and have always left pleased. It's a pretty casual spot since you order at a counter. I've had good luck with their specials. It can get packed on farmer's market weekends. On those days I'm not always sure it is worth the wait, but considering how busy they are they get the food out fast."}
{"text":"If you like sandwiches with crispy toasted bread, savory meats balanced well with slaw and a yummy dessert to finish it off, you'll love Marigold."}
{"text":"Easily one of the best places in Madison to get breakfast, Marigold's never disappoints with its gourmet omelettes and daily scrambles, blueberry pancakes topped with orange-almond butter, and fresh sandwiches and salads. Your first big decision will be to determine if your taste buds lean salty or sweet. The baked goods in the glass display next the the register will make you drool as you pay your bill, and go great with the coffee and fresh-squeezed juices on offer. In the summertime, its outdoor seating is an additional perk, but be prepared to wait regardless because this place has a good reputation in the city and is almost always packed on weekend mornings."}
{"text":"So my review is mixed. Before kids we did enjoy going here for breakfast but now...  It the past 4 years we have gone twice, both times more stressed out then we were before going in.   If your young or no toddlers with, have money to blow, don't care about small potions and the wait on Saturday this place wants you. For us we will have to stick with more family friendly restaurants.  This past Saturday we waited 40 minutes for under cooked French toast, short stack that our toddler was scared of. $28 (plus tip) for 3 meals that left us hungry and unsatisfied."}
{"text":"When I get a text that says \"meet for brunch at noon\" from my best friend, I don't even have to ask where. You only have to specify a location if you aren't going to Marigold.   Of course, there is one serious problem with Marigold. I end up having a heart-wrenching, philosophical dilemma every time I go there: savory or sweet? It would be an easy decision to make if one menu item from either camp stood out above the rest, but everything is so good! I don't even notice the wait because I spend the whole time I'm in line making a pros and cons list between two of the items in my head. It's all very emotional for me.  By the time I get to the front of the line, the turmoil I am experiencing is plain to see. The girl at the register asks me what I'll have and I just stammer, \"ummm ummm ummm....\" and begin to panic. But just when I start to hyperventilate, my friend jumps in. \"We'll split the duck confit hash and the french toast.\"  That's why he's my best friend."}
{"text":"I love Marigold Kitchen. I just. love. it..  The service is pleasant. The food is inventive and tasty. The atmosphere is a-buzz with downtown energy. It's often hard to find a table and one out of 5 times I've been there, the food was only great (rather than fantastic) so that's the reason for the 1 star deduction. Still, one of my favorite lunch spots near the square. Their daily specials and soups are not to be missed. Also, amazing macaroons."}
{"text":"Maybe I had too high expectations after all the 5-stars this place has gotten, but I just wasn't blown away. We went for breakfast on a Thursday. Easy to find and parking wasn't a problem. We were a little confused when we first entered - didn't realize you order at the counter and take a number and find a table and the food is brought out. I tried the blueberry pancakes. I wanted to get a side of sausage - but was told something like they were cooking and it would be a long wait. First big negative - who runs out of sausage? Looking at others eating, it looks like I missed out too (they had sausage and it looked yummy). My wife got the Breakfast sandwich. Next two problems - my pancakes came with a \"orange-almond butter\" which sounds very cool. . . only problem is that is all I tasted. The orange taste was so overpowering that nothing else came through. My wife thought her sandwich had cream cheese on it - I think it was the boursin cheese. Both of us probably won't be ordering those items if we choose to return.  Now I will say that everything seemed very fresh and all natural. . . it was great atmosphere and service was fine. Pretty expensive though - for a breakfast - and portions were not large. Overall I wasn't impressed, but my friends say to try it again. I might - but I'm not in a hurry to return."}
{"text":"Based on the food alone, this place would be 4 stars based on what we had today. We were in town over the weekend, and breakfast is my favorite meal of the day.  My boyfriend googled and this place popped up on the Madison Better Breakfast Bureau (what a fantastic idea, by the way) -  so based on the ratings on that site and yelp, I was SUPER excited to eat there. So why such a low rating?  I really hated the set up.  It was this morning (Sunday) so I knew it was going to be crowded.  I thought it would be like a normal restaurant where you go, wait an excruciating amount of time for a table, and then sit down and have some time to look over the menu, decide what to get, and order.  No. That is not how it works... I felt very rushed the entire time I was there.  I felt as though I had 25 seconds to look at the menu.  Order, get a number and sit at a table and wait for the food. The coffee is self serve (which is not the part that is the problem) but is  in such an inconveniently located place directly next the to the cash register that it is super crowded, you can't get refills because the crazy line is ALWAYS in front of it.  And I'm sorry, but if I'm paying $2.25 for a \"bottomless\" cup of coffee, that means I want a refill.  And I was under the impression the term \"bottomless\" stems from a waitress coming over and refilling your cup before you see the bottom... Anyway - no way to get refills of your coffee... Moving on -  I was also sitting at a table directly near the coffee station, and where the food comes up from the kitchen (and also located directly next to the seats where people who have already ordered and are waiting for tables are sitting).  My chair was bumped no less than 30 times by people walking back and forth (staff and customers alike).   Now - about the people waiting for tables - I am eating my breakfast.  I do NOT want you staring down at me because you have already ordered and are waiting for your food.  It makes me feel uncomfortable, and made me eat faster, and not really enjoy my meal.   That is not their fault, but rather the fault of the set up of the restaurant.  Perhaps you should not have people order food before they definitely have a table.   Overall, it was just very odd.  I would definitely not return based on the set up..  The food was great (Ham and Gruyere Omelet for me, Chorizo scrambler for boyfriend)."}
{"text":"The menu here makes everything sound delicious. I ordered the quiche which was described as having andouille sausage, broccoli, red peppers and Gouda. I ordered a side of Marigold potatoes because the quiche only came with greens. The handsome man I was with ordered the duck confit hash.   Only the potatoes were tasty. My quiche was bland, even the sausage had minimal flavor. The crust was overly dense and chewy, not at all flaky. There was no Gouda to be found. I never season my food at restaurants but it needed salt and quite a bit of pepper.   The duck confit hash looked greasy and disgusting. The potatoes were not even cooked through, I could barely get a fork in the piece he gave me. I did not try it but he also had to douse it in salt and pepper for it to be edible. There were strange pieces of something in the hash that looked like melted plastic and had the same texture. He left those on the plate. The hash only came with greens, no toast. Toast was an extra $2.50. We did not order any.   The potatoes were a nice mix of crispy and soft with just enough greasiness to enhance the flavor.   My companion also ordered a Bloody Mary and they suggested the heirloom mix. It tasted like puréed fresh tomatoes with tons of seeds and no depth of flavor. It was horrible and he didn't even finish half.   They never came back to check on us after bringing the food, so we didn't have the opportunity to share our disappointment. We also had to borrow salt and pepper from the table next to us  The decor is cute and everything LOOKS tasty, it just really lacked flavor. We were very disappointed especially after spending over $35 on breakfast."}
{"text":"I came here for breakfast on Sunday morning with a small group. I got one of their special plates - Pork Tacos and a chai tea latte. I was very satisfied with my choices. The plate came with two tacos, black beans and two eggs cooked to your liking. This kept me full until for a good half of day. The restaurant and staff are nice. You order up front, get a number and they bring the food out to you. There is outdoor seating as well as tables inside and chairs at the counter. You help yourself to water and can only get a table once you order and have a number. Overall, a good experience that I would recommend."}
{"text":"Loved this little place. We went for breakfast on a Saturday morning. They were very busy but still friendly and efficient. Didn't have to wait long for a table. On weekends and busy days it appears you order at counter then hostess finds a table for you. I had the scrambler with eggs, roasted red peppers, sweet potatoes and kale. It was served with potatoes, toast and a little salad. Salad unusual with breakfast but hey I liked it! My husband had an omelette with rosemary bread toast. He raves about it. Our friends also enjoyed their meals. If I lived in Madison I would be a regular."}
{"text":"One the better places to get breakfast in town. They're potatoes are very flavorful. Their pancakes are also very good but I like their savory items. Their breakfast sandwich is also very good! Great sauce with tomatoes and all kinds of fixings. I will note that the last couple times I've gone, the flavor of the food is not as bold....hope they're not getting complacent..."}
{"text":"Marigold earns 5 stars from me for their breakfast sandwich! The cheddar-spiked Boursin is soooo good. This sandwich is flavorful and filling without being greasy. Awesome!   Today I tried an omelette (zucchini, goat cheese, and red pepper) along with mixed greens, breakfast potatoes, and rosemary toast. The omelette was pretty good, the greens were lightly dressed and very fresh, the potatoes were tasty (large portion). The rosemary toast was good but nothing game changing.   From this day forward, I plan to order a breakfast sandwich and will try to convince my dining partners to order potatoes and mixed greens to share. Yum!"}
{"text":"Being from Chicago it was refreshing to be in a breakfast place that cared about the flavor of the food instead of the quantity. The French toast was complete with strawberries, blueberries, raspberries and blackberries, along with creaming glaze and topped with toasted almost slices. My boyfriend had the Duck Confit Hash, the upper portion of duck to potato was in the ducks favor, which was highly enjoyable for him. The small spring salad that comes with it was a nice palate cleanser and the eggs were buttery and fluffy. Was a wonderful experience and will be back but it received a 4 only because it was cramped."}
{"text":"For a quick meal it can't be beat. We shared a caesar salad, which was done just right. I tried the veggie sandwhich, but think it would have been better if it wasn't served cold. I really like their sister restaurant, Sardines. Both have nice outdoor patios."}
{"text":"Loved everything here! I got there black iced coffee which was so refreshingly good. I also got the chilaquiles and my friends got the salmon frittata and the duck hash which were all very delicious! The chilaquiles were a bit spicy though but I love spicy so it was perfect for me! I came here on a Mon morning and it was not packed at all. There were only about 4 people ahead of us in line."}
{"text":"The food here is quite delicious and I probably come here for breakfast (usually to go) once or twice every two weeks. That said, the potatoes are covered in oil and while yummy, I feel guilty after I eat them every time (keep in mind, this continued to not stop me from ordering). Scrambled eggs come more like an omelette than true scrambled eggs - seems to be what a lot of breakfast places do but it still drives me crazy. They're still yummy to eat, though. I will never come here close to lunch because there is nowhere to sit down. I visit on early weekday mornings and that's about it. Regardless of when I come, the line to order seems to take longer than it takes to get the food. As such, if I eat in and want to get a second mimosa or anything at all, it requires getting back up in line and going through all over again - no thanks. I would still recommend it to people looking for a good, non-diner weekday breakfast joint, but I've been limiting my visits recently for all the reasons above."}
{"text":"If you don't mind waiting in line for what is one of the best brunch places in town, then you won't be disappointed. The pumpkin buckwheat pancakes made my taste buds soar, and the mulled cider had me begging for another cup. I can't wait to return, because I have my eye on the duck confit hash."}
{"text":"We wanted to go to marigolds but the wait was an hour & we were hungry.  We went close to when they opened too.  I could tell their menu was better.   The old fashioned gets a low score because they don't have even one omelet  to offer.  How is that possible for a breakfast place?"}
{"text":"Yummy food and good service.   We enjoyed iced coffees, braised pork, quiche, and the divine buttermilk pancakes. The pancakes were incredible. Husband loved the braised pork.   My only complaint was my quiche. While it was a very tasty quiche -- and very reasonably priced for such a huge slice -- the crust was soggy. I have no formal training with cooking/baking, and I'm just a home cook -- but my quiche crust at home has never turned out that badly. Also, strangely, one single bite from my quiche at Marigold Kitchen was very cold.  I would return and make sure to eat the buttermilk pancakes again and try something other than the quiche."}
{"text":"Good selection overall.  We had a great breakfast sandwich, excellent if not messy fish tacos and good brunch drinks.  Friendly and professional staff.  Sit outside if you want peace and quiet with your eggs but the vibe and buzz inside is excellent."}
{"text":"Such an adorable place- the workers are kind and food is amazing. Went on a Sunday and stood in a huge line, but it went fast. A place like this surely cares for its customers!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant! Went here for breakfast and was truly impressed with the service and the food! Fresh ingredients and great coffee."}
{"text":"The wait was long and it was crowded- however: the servers were calm and organized. The drink options were many and delicious. I got the artichoke and sun dried tomato omelette- so yum. You must get the coconut macaroon as well!"}
{"text":"I stopped here on a road trip while passing through Madison. Nice spot, good food. I was a little confused when I walked in and didn't know I was the place my order at the counter then seat myself. The blueberry pancakes were very sweet. I loved the Wisconsin maple syrup with them. I also really enjoyed the egg plate. The potatoes were very flavorful and so was The rosemary toast! Between the sweet and savory, I may have had too many flavors going on, so be careful of that...otherwise, great meal!"}
{"text":"Delish! One of the best brunches I've ever had. I had the artichoke omelet and it was wonderful. Staff is very delightful as well!"}
{"text":"During my first experience here, I walked in craving brunch 4 MINUTES after they stopped serving brunch, and they refused to serve me. Really?? 4 EFFING minutes means that much to you, Marigold? And the pretentious hipster douche half my age behind the counter just sneered at me like I was outrageous for politely asking them to lighten the F up and make an exception.  I guess they're not hurting for business so they can turn it away if you want brunch 4 minutes after they stop serving it. Or maybe the punk-a$$ behind the counter majored in accordion and will be living with mom and dad for the next 50 years and this is the most authority they will ever wield in life? By laying down the law for those who have the ovaries to walk in 4 minutes late and ask for some damn eggs and pancakes. SHEESH! I thought about asking for a manager but honestly, with that major attitude from the cashier, I was pretty sure someone would spit in our food. We walked out and spent our money somewhere around the corner...somewhere that serves brunch an entire HOUR later than Marigold did/does.  I'm giving them 2 stars instead of 1 because I returned 3-4 years later (I know how to hold a grudge). I made sure to show up well before they stopped serving brunch. Cashier was new and polite. Server was wonderful. We sat outside and I had some pretty great blueberry pancakes, and an egg scramble thing that was pretty darn good, along with a fantastic mimosa. I don't think I'd ever want to eat inside though...the acoustics are TERRIBLE and you can't hear what the person across from you is saying. FWIW I've had my hearing tested and it is WAY above average. It's just bad interior sound design on their part.  I will probably go here again if the stars align just perfectly, but after that first experience with the pretentious jerk I doubt it'll be anytime soon. Some of my friends have had negative experiences here too. Which is a shame because we all agreed the food is very good. But the noisy interior and the crappy attitude of uppity service staff isn't something I want to reward with money. There are so many other restaurants and food carts to try in Madison. Like I said earlier, I don't think they're worried about getting and keeping your business. Marigold is NEVER my first choice. But when it worked out it was very good."}
{"text":"I like to eat here for lunch. Their brunch is hugely popular but I don't have the patience for that. The staff is friendly, the food is excellent and there are good choices for vegetarians. I had them cater a lunch for a small group and that was excellent as well."}
{"text":"This place had the perfect size short stack. It was also came with an orange infused syrup. Yummy!  Not only that, but their dark mocha was awesome. It wasn't too rich...perfectly blended over ice! Great way to start off a nice humid summer madison morning!"}
{"text":"This place was packed! Line out the door makes it a longer and more crowded experience, so expect to wait a bit for weekend brunch. Food quality was good and matched the price. They have coffee and drinks (I had a bloody) and good breakfast like pancakes, omelets and scrambles. Not much competition nearby as it's location is right near the Capitol."}
{"text":"Love this place. Bright fun loving relaxed interior decor, great prices and awesome food.  It's usually crowded...because it's so good.  Order at counter, take a number, grab any open table, get food right off the grill. Aim for the breakfast sandwich or scrambler.  Self serve water and coffee. Relaxed, not formal."}
{"text":"Alright, so I have mixed reviews.  I find it easier to list them:  1. Great eggs/scrambler/omelette. Fresh, hot, delicious. 2. TERRIBLE potatoes. Borderline inedible. My potatoes were burnt the first time I went. The second time? Too cold and flavorless to eat. 3. Great options for having such a small menu. I tried the French Rosemary bread and fell in love. I was really impressed that they offered something so out of the box. It was a great change of pace. However, the bread is served cold. It is like they toast it earlier in the day and them slightly warm it when they serve you. 4. The lavender infused espresso drinks. Fabulous. I had the White Chocolate Lavender Mocha and it was simply heaven. Divine. Amazing. Should I continue?  I can not decide what I love more, the aroma or the flavor. I have also had the Honey Lavender Latte. That one trumps its mocha friend. Here is my issue. These are all specials that only last a week. This depresses me because I love them all and never get them again. Now, I know they are small and need to change things up, but love is love. And I miss the drinks. 5. Timing. I get it, you are busy. However, I really get annoyed that my food beats my coffee out by several minutes."}
{"text":"Marigold Kitchen is one of my favorite places for brunch in Madison. They have great food and a fun atmosphere. You order the counter and then sit down. Usually there is a line to the door on the weekends but it is a pretty quick turnaround. They have amazing chai lattes and bloody Mary's. I've never had a bad meal here and they have a good selections of pastries and cookies for desert."}
{"text":"I was impressed with the food at Marigold Kitchen because the flavors and tastes contrasted and complimented well with one another. My brunch meal consisted of a salmon omelet, filled with salty salmon filet and cream cheese, that was perfectly paired with a small salad dressed in a balsamic vinaigrette and a side of sliced Russet potatoes. The only critique about my meal is that the creamy, melt-in-your-mouth cream cheese inside the omelet could've been distributed more evenly--it was a bit gross to bite suddenly into a thick dollop of sweetness when the egg and salmon was salty. It also seems to be constantly busy and crowded with people streaming through the doors."}
{"text":"The food was very good. However, for the price I do not like the fact that I need to wait in line to order and then bus the table. If prices were lower I'd be fine with it but don't prefer it here."}
{"text":"Stopped for breakfast at Marigold's. Their self-serve coffee was pretty good and it was nice that it was bottomless. I had a short stack of the blueberry pancakes. They were also pretty good, but the pancakes were pretty small (two pancakes the size of my palm) for the nearly $7 price.   Their breakfast potatoes are unusual though not unpleasant; they are thin, crisp potatoes heavily seasoned with herbs. The place can get pretty busy on weekend mornings, so be sure to bring your patience."}
{"text":"I think the thing that stands out for me from Marigold is the service. Yes, the have absolutely delicious food and the coffee is great. The atmosphere is cozy-casual, but man, the service made the experience for me.  I have an aversion to onions. I don't have an allergy, but I do not like them in any form, not raw, not caramelized, not pickled, no way, no how do I eat onions. And at Marigold I want to order the breakfast sandwich which comes with a fried egg, cheddar-spiked boursin, applewood smoked bacon, tomato and green onion on toasted ciabatta. I asked for no green onions. While they aren't on my strict no-onions list I still choose not to have them when possible. However, they were mixed in with the cheddar-spiked boursin and therefore not removable. I hemmed and hawed but the man at the counter said it would be good and if it wasn't he would give me something else so I took it.  I ended up eating about half of it, not because I didn't like it, but just because I was full. However, the man from the counter came over toward the end of our breakfast and expressed concern about the amount of the sandwich I hadn't eaten. He tried to get me to order something else and apologized if I didn't enjoy my breakfast. I did, in fact, enjoy my breakfast. But, man. The fact that he remembered me and checked in based on how much I ate was really nice. And so, I'd go back for the service if nothing else. But, in reality I'd also go back to try the pancakes because those looked fantastic."}
{"text":"I love getting the chicken salad but this time they made it with half of the ingredients. I felt completely ripped off for paying $12 for greens and 4 chunks of chicken with 1 chunk of cheese. The quality was definitely not there this time. Not sure if I will return."}
{"text":"I got a French toast here and it is by far the best french toast I have gotten. It is delicious and with fresh fruit such as strawberries, blueberries and blackberries. The syrup was also hot and went well with the toast."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I m not in love with cafeteria style service so I have a bias walking in the door.  I ordered the marigold sandwich which was good. My wife had blueberry pancakes I didn't love there pancake batter.  Tasted a little sour for my liking.  There coffee is strong. Good location to the Hilton."}
{"text":"Brunch was delicious. The baked goods are especially noteworthy. And my pancake craving was definitely satisfied.  But be warned if you are planning on grabbing a meal here on a weekend, plan on waiting in line in a bizarre Soup Nazi style seating system. You see, since you order at the counter, you'd think finding a table would be first come first serve like most any other restaurant on the planet where you order at the counter. Instead, finding a table or even a seat at the bar and then ordering is verboten. Instead you will be instructed to order your food first and then look around sheepishly for somewhere to sit and eat it. I imagine on normal days this isn't a problem, but for weekend brunch, it means you might find yourself with a plate of delicious brunch items and nowhere to consume it.   The effect of course is to give the dining experience a conveyer belt quality in which you feel rushed to eat and go. At the very least, you find yourself averting your eyes from the poor souls standing around eying your plates and checking their watches. Basically the opposite of what brunch is supposed to be like: leisurely.   But again, the food itself was delicious."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast while wives were doing the farmers market. The line stretched out the door but moved quickly.  We placed our order within 10 minutes- were seated and eating within 20 minutes. Had OJ , EGGS, BACON, BUTTERMILK PANCAKES.  Everything was perfect- definitely found a new breakfast location."}
{"text":"I loved everything i got here! Its really nice to have the option of a short stack for pancakes, because if you are really hungry you can order something else too! I got the poached eggs with prosciutto and manchego cheese. Ot was great!!! Nice atmosphere and service too. It is pricey but worth it"}
{"text":"This place is great for breakfast, brunch, or lunch. The menu is creative and all the ingredients are very fresh.  It can be very crowded for brunch, but it is definitely worth it.  Not to mention the bloody mary's and unlimited coffee are great bonuses.    I always get the omelette with goat cheese and zucchini, but there are about 7 other omelette options alone. The potatoes that are served with the entree are crazy good.    Very friendly, quick service."}
{"text":"Great food but so busy and loud I couldn't really enjoy my company. Will definitely be back but it's not the place to go for a heart to heart chat."}
{"text":"Delicious stop for breakfast while visiting Madison! I got the broccoli and mushroom omelette and the maple latte. OMG so good!!!! The latte and omelette were amazing and the hash browns that came with the omelette were probably the best I've ever had! I will probably have a dream or two about that breakfast and definitely would return if I'm in Madison again"}
{"text":"It was okay. Buttermilk pancakes were crepe-like and pretty sour. Too much buttermilk for me. Side of beans was HUGE but they were very bland. Nitro coffee was decent. I had much better breakfasts at Short Stack and the Brunch Club."}
{"text":"Great frittata and buckwheat pancakes.  Highly recommended.  Nice decor. Prompt service."}
{"text":"Madison no doubt has some of the best egg sandwiches out there. I'd only ever had McDonald's egg mcmuffin (a zillion years ago, mind you), so perhaps my expectations weren't all that high. But my oh my, Marigold Kitchen's egg sandwich is one of the best I've had since moving to Madison a year ago. Would of gotten five stars had the bacon been cooked a little longer.  For a side I purchased potatoes, which I generally would douse in ketchup - but there was enough flavor where, dare I say it, my favorite condiment was not necessary.   Tried the Peppermint Mocha with Soy. Not a fan. Boyfriend enjoyed the coffee, but wished there was more of a selection rather than just one Regular or Decaf carafe. The unlimited refills made up for his griping, though."}
{"text":"We had a nice brunch here. Food and service was good. I ate the barley saute with a fried egg on top. The marigold potatoes were the best part of the meal, but very greasy. The heirloom bloody mary was one of the best I've had."}
{"text":"Marigold is a great place to meet for lunch.  Cafeteria style with a very creative menu.  Lovely salads and interesting sandwiches.  When it is crowded it can be noisy so head for a table at the windows or along the back wall.  And sit back and enjoy the excellent food.  Also great for breakfast and brunch."}
{"text":"Unique, cool place to enjoy a meal.  I'm so happy they are now open for bunch on Sunday Mornings (before it was only Saturday).  Why I go here: *Fresh orange juice -mmm *Good coffee *Duck hash (any many other interesting menu items) *Potato side is killer *Yummy pastries *Fun casual atmosphere, usually busy  Note: I would not bring a group of more than 4 or 6 people here- it gets busy."}
{"text":"Best brunch in Madison, and they have a ton of competition. Duck Confit hash is too good"}
{"text":"A favorite of the capitol square crowd.  It's been packed every time I've been there for lunch.  Order at the counter and fight for a seat.  The salads are huge, but everything is just a little pricey...something common around the square.  Nice cushions and pillows on the benches around the restaurant.  Nothing too stand out, but a great lunch staple for a salad or sandwich with a few baked goods as well. 4 stars."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast/brunch spot in Madison. Very tasty options and good brunch (read: alcoholic) drinks, too. I like the French toast, or breakfast sandwich if I'm in the mood for savory. Always a bustling place but it doesn't take long to get seated after you order. It can feel a little chaotic when you first walk in but the staff manages it well. It's a little pricey but worth it in my opinion.   Sitting outside on a farmers market day is awesome! If it's a nice day, definitely try to get a spot outside."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in town with something for everyone, made with fresh, healthy, delicious ingredients that you can't get anywhere else- from salmon and cream cheese omelets to french toast covered with berries to a great breakfast sandwich.    Lunch is the same variety and quality and it's definitely worth it to substitute the homemade potato salad for the coleslaw...the portions are filling and worth the price and every recipe from the salads to the burger to the pesto grilled cheese has been created with the most attention to detail."}
{"text":"Better Cinnamon Sugar Donut Muffins!?  AMAZING!!!  I want some right now, that would be good. Believe It!"}
{"text":"Marigold's breakfast is a treat for anyone who lives or works downtown.  The food is just so fresh!  Their pancakes, French toast, and eggs are great, but my favorite is their breakfast sandwich, which I order without meat.  The breakfast sandwich also works well for carryout; it gets so darn crowded that I'd rather take my food with me when possible.  If you want to eat in with some friends or family, go early!  The later it gets, the more crowded it will be.  The one thing that bugs me about Marigold is that they stop serving breakfast at 10:30 on the dot, which isn't very clear on their website, and they can be pretty merciless to anyone standing in line at that time.  I've had my dreams of brioche French toast dashed more than once.  I do wish they had more vegetarian sandwiches, and that they served some of their veggie sandwiches and salads  on Saturday.  They have the best greens of any restaurant in the area."}
{"text":"great place for brunch. nice atmostphere"}
{"text":"Food is good, love the decor and atmosphere, but I feel the prices are a little much for soups and sandwiches.  Definitely filling and satisfying, but pretty hard on the wallet for a quick little lunch."}
{"text":"Somehow in all my time in Madison (6 years), I had never managed to check this place out. What was I missing out on!? Deliciousness. That's what.  Marigold Kitchen is an unassuming business on the Capitol Square that knows how to do breakfast. It has great coffee options, a variety of breakfast options, and an efficient system to get everyone eating.  My friend and I came basically at opening on a Saturday, which was wise. It filled up fast! I had a quiche, which was fantastic. The crust was just killer. I'll come back again and again!"}
{"text":"Perfect casual breakfast spot for families.  You order at the counter, it is super casual, fast and great vibe.  I cannot eat gluten (celiac) and found several items that I could have that are naturally GF.  I talked with the employee at the counter for a bit and they seemed to know what they were doing."}
{"text":"The Duck Confit Hash was excellent, even though I've found that duck is not my prime choice of meat for breakfast!   It is a little pricier than other breakfast spots and very tough for a group to find seating but they know how to do breakfast right!"}
{"text":"I had the grilled turkey and cheese with figs for lunch and a side of red cabbage.  Good stuff!  During lunchtime, it gets crowded."}
{"text":"This breakfast place was recommended to me by a local Madison resident. It did not disappoint! My only complaint is that it felt a bit rushed, as you order at the counter and then find a table. I like a more leisurely brunch!  My boyfriend and I split the egg sandwich with a side of potatoes and fruit. The sandwich consisted of a fried egg, bacon, cheese, fresh tomato and chive cream cheese all on a ciabatta roll. It had such great flavor! The potatoes were so delicious, too. The fruit was very fresh!  I was also a big fan of the coffee. This place is really cute and I would return!"}
{"text":"Great central location-helpful staff.  Breakfast sandwich and zucchini, red pepper goat cheese omelette were delicious. Coffee is excellent.  I would return in a heartbeat although very loud music under speakers in several spots would lead me to sit outside. Very very busy at 10am on a Friday: how noisy would it be on a weekend? Ditch the music- the sound of happy customers is the best music of all."}
{"text":"Great affordable brunch food. Love is definitely cooked into every bite here.   Their coffee drinks are also great, nothing like an iced almond milk latte.   I had a burger and it was one of the best decisions I've made in a while.   I'm not giving them five stars because my group of seven had to sit with six chairs at a four person table. I know it's busy, and we are all pretty relaxed people, but come on!"}
{"text":"The staff are very friendly and attentive. The French toast is really subpar and soggy. The tropical pineapple pancake was delicious. Their poached eggs are dry....which is weird for poached eggs.  Their kids menu \"little chick\" is $7 - that's overpriced when neither or my kids were able to even eat half their food because they said it \"tastes weird\"- they have had many French toast and pancakes in their lives.  Their coffee tastes stale no depth.  Their \"fresh squeezed orange juice\" tasted like concentrated orange juice- there is a stark difference between fresh squeezed and not fresh squeezed in taste/ that really is so wrong.  Sorry this sounds so negative but we went here because of all the great reviews- so we were pretty disappointed.  I hope my review helps others."}
{"text":"Better than average food. Cute little place for Bunch, and the quality is outstanding. Very wholesome, and fresh. Coffee is decent, not fantastic. Staff is very friendly. Try the french toast, the berries are really fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"Went there for my bi-annual brunch with a couple friends. Wow. Totally delicious!  I got the omelet with chorizo, roasted red peppers, sweet corn relish, cheddar cheese and cilantro.  The veggies were ultra-fresh, the cheese nice and sharp, and that oh-so-delicious cilantro tied the whole omelet together. Their potatoes are pretty awesome, too.  Oh yeah, and the servers are INSANELY friendly, unpretentious...it's a wonderful place to grab brunch, sit back and relax. I loved it!  NOW, to be fair--I can't give it five stars because, well, Sophia's...but keep this in mind--it's pretty damn excellent food."}
{"text":"In my three days visiting Madison, I came here twice.  As a person that likes to try as many different places as possible, this doesn't happen too much.  However, this place really is awesome.  Ok, yes, it's crowded for weekend brunch.  They are kinda slow in making the food.  But it makes sense.  The food is REALLY good.  I tried the scrambler, which came with the marigold potatoes and toast (I got the rosemary bread).  This morning, I got the french toast (came with maple syrup, sweet cream and fresh berries).  Both were awesome, and next time I'm in Madison, I'll be sure to go back!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast, close to Capitol, but there are cheaper options  Ate at Marigold with my family during a Labor Day visit to Madison. You need to wait in line to order and pay for your food. The line was pretty intimidating, but surprisingly, it goes pretty quickly. The food was more expensive than what I expected for Madison. It was fresh and good, but we found some cheaper options during the rest of our stay."}
{"text":"There were four in our party for brunch.  And it was another 10 on a Sunday morning, so a very busy time.    The breakfast sandwiches had green onion and cream cheese which didn't agree too well with part of or group   The breakfast potatoes weren't anything special.  In fact they were a bit soggy  Overall, it was \"ok.\"  Not a place I'm in a hurry to get back to.  There are quite a few other brunch spots waiting to be tried.  Oh yeah.  There was no sugar-free syrup.  Really?"}
{"text":"Probably my favorite brunch place in Madison. Converted a couple people to liking brunch simply from their great experiences here. What else is a better compliment to their food and atmosphere?  My standard staples: the breakfast sandwich (literally the perfect combo. Don't even like tomatoes and I like how they taste in this sandwich!), side of breakfast potatoes (just a little kick that even my spice-wary friends appreciate), and their iced tea. Classic, delicious, and keeps me full and happy... until the next meal. Their service is wonderful, and I have yet to wait more than 20-25 minutes for a table (and that's on a bad day. Though admittedly I rarely go with more than 3-4 people). During the summer, the outside tables are coveted spaces and well worth it, especially when the farmers market is happening on Saturdays!  Pro-tip if you love their iced tea. 1) You can get free refills, and 2) they are AMAZING and will fill you a separate cup to take to go. What could be better?!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to Marigold for years and this was going to be a five-star review, but they made a recent, disturbing change--they switched from Anchora coffee to Alterra. Before you get up in arms, yelling, \"I love Alterra,\" let me explain that Alterra is not a bad coffee, it's just that I loved the Anchora Marigold Special Blend. We would buy this blend and give it away to friends and family as presents.  I can understand making the change, and I will still LOVE Marigold, but now that I don't get my Marigold rocket fuel anymore, I will be a little less excited about going there.  As usual the food was excellent. I had the chorizo omlette with greens potatoes and toast.  This Saturday morning it was the usual buzzing/active/perfect-for-people-watching/too-loud-for-some atmosphere that I have grown to love.  I will miss you Anchora Marigold Special Blend. May you rest in peace."}
{"text":"Had no idea what we were going to do for breakfast and as the hotel guide stated in its first line \"start with an energizing breakfast at the marigold\", why not.   Wonderful breakfast sandwich, bacon, egg and lots of slurpy goodness washed down with a dark chocolate mocha mmmm. The rest of the family had quiche, French toast and bacon omelette and all cleared their plates, except Jim who didn't like the riot of fruit loaded on top of his toast (most would). Overall a damn yummy breakfast and will very likely be back on the travels to try some more."}
{"text":"I have had the duck confit, toasted coconut pancakes, vanilla lattes, chai lattes, and French toast.  The french toast is one of the best things I have ever had.  Seriously, I think it may go down for me as last meal on earth.  Everything here is superb, just excellent.  You know, it's strange - or maybe I'm just lucky - but every time I go to Marigold it is packed, line out the door packed and bustling like you would not believe. And yet.... Every time I get done ordering I am able to find a seat immediately.  They have fresh squeezed OJ, the lattes are excellent, and I love the atmosphere.  My all time favorite brunch spot in Madison.  I crave them every weekend, and want to try everything on the menu.  If only that french toast didn't keep calling me out, I may be able to get to those other items."}
{"text":"I do not give out five stars easily, but to validate my stars I can honestly say I eat here weekly, if not multiple times a week. I recommend whatever the special scrambler is of the moment, with an add on of a short stack of the speciality pancakes. Today it was ginger pancakes (yes. ginger pancakes- see?) and a three egg scrambler with yada yada awesome. If you want to order from the traditional menu the furthest I can get you is the Tostada. Just order it, they'll know what you mean! It's delicious and it's as far as I got on the menu before I fell in love, now i will only feed myself upon their specialty scramblers or a Tostada. Fun fact, they have the second best coconut macaroons in town (my absolute favorite). Any of the baked goods are great, you'll see them in the front case. They often showcase scones/breads/muffins with traditional sweet elements paired with more traditionally savory spices/herbs (for example: rosemary strawberry scones : ))."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite brunch in Madison. I love coming here for brunch with the ladies after a night out to catch up and ease our hangovers with coffee and mimosas. I always order the ham and gruyere omelet with rosemary toast. It's fricken fantastic!"}
{"text":"This place around the corner from the State House was a Mari-Gold mine of a find! The Chef de Cuisine Kristy Schwinn has created a well thought-out, flavorful menu!  Under the recommendation of the host I chose the Stuffed Poblano Pepper, its was an amazing gastronomic experience in my mouth! The flavor combinations of that dish where so well thought out I couldn't get enough of it!   Thank you ladies for making my first visit there a memorial to high quality ingredients and cooks!  I the famous words of Arnold Schwarzenegger \"I'll Be Back\" you can count on it!!"}
{"text":"The breakfast sandwich here is my favorite in Madison. It's absolutely delicious.  I also always enjoy the pleasant wait staff. They are super friendly and seem to enjoy their jobs, which makes the atmosphere great!"}
{"text":"Everything about this place made us feel welcome and delighted. Great atmosphere, clean, good service and excellent food. Salmon Fritata is a must order as it is fresh, fluffy and flavorful.  The espresso drink i orders contained local honey and spices and was presented in such a lovely way that i almost didn't want to drink it. So pretty.  We could tell the barista takes pride in his creations. Pancakes where dense, in a good way.  Thanks Marigold! We'll be back."}
{"text":"Treat yourself to breakfast here. Fluffiest and most flavorful pancakes ever! Top that with fresh strawberries, real maple syrup and a sprinkle of powdered sugar and you have a winner. You won't leave Marigold Kitchen disappointed or hungry."}
{"text":"This place is totally Madison rich people food. It's expensive but delicious. There are only a few meat options, but that means it's vegetarian friendly. It's not full service, so not full tipping makes it cheaper (though most people will tip the same here anyways. Way to work the market). The place is always full for brunch so that means you're at a place that other people want to eat. If you get tired of the long lines to wait through you can always people watch. It's all eccentric people and pretty girls.  TLDR; If you like five star reviews you'll like this place."}
{"text":"Fantastic, quick brunch spot. You walk up to the counter to order and then they bring your food to you, with self serve coffee, water and silverware. Small menu but interesting with really fresh ingredients, and plenty of vegetarian options. It was busy but they move people through pretty quickly. The potatoes have spices and a kick, which I love, and both egg dishes I sampled were delicious. Great option."}
{"text":"Great downtown breakfast spot. Delicious and cheap eats!"}
{"text":"HIDDEN GEM OF BRUNCH IN DOWNTOWN MADISON.  Super delicious house made breakfasts and lunches (with coffee bar) featuring seasonal Wisconsin products. I'm partial to the pancakes and french toast served or else their specials for the day are A+ Get here early on weekends (8am) to snag a seat, it is limited during the winter. They usually will offer outdoor seating in the summers, great to stop by before the Farmers Market"}
{"text":"Love this place! The heirloom Bloody Marys are amazing. Just a little spice and a lot of flavor. You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu and the staff is super friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"My experience at Marigold Kitchen was one of the highlights of my weekend away from Chicago.  I visited Madison a week ago, and I am still salivating over the deliciousness of my meal at Marigold!  I had the grilled Angus hamburger with gruyere - incredible!  I usually add ketchup to burgers, but with one bite in, I knew I wouldn't need any.  My burger was juicy and perfectly medium-rare, with the right ratio of meat to veggies to bun.  It wasn't too greasy (like many burgers can get) and it was well put together. And the sauce!  My mouth had a most pleasant after taste (strange, but true), and I have to say that this was truly one of the best burgers I have ever eaten.  My friend ordered a grilled cheese and gazpacho soup.  I had a bite of each, and both were delicious.  The decor is super cute and hip, with bold yellow to brighten the mood.  The wait wasn't too bad and the service was solid.  Moreover, all the dishes looked incredibly fresh and delicious - I'd love to try more!  I will definitely come back here on my next trip to Madison."}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast spot in all of Madison! The staff is always friendly and accommodating and the food is out of this world. The scrambler specials are delicious and the pastries are really tasty. The potatoes are a must try, they are easily the best in town. Whenever you're in madison looking for a brunch spot, Marigold's is a must!"}
{"text":"Too loud for my tastes, I don't like loud bars at night, let alone at breakfast.  My scramble was tasty, and everything else I tried also very good.  And I like the light airy feeling of it, even though there were so many people crammed in there with lots of tables, pillows, chairs, and toast everywhere.  But even with our large group, we got a big table pretty quick, and our food not too long after that."}
{"text":"I am not a breakfast person. I eat breakfast foods, but I generally do not care for much more than a cup of coffee in the morning. After coming here, I would happily have an omelette bright and early every day.  The whole experience here was enjoyable. I appreciate the sign out front instructing patrons to order before being seated. The menu is not over packed with items but had a ton of choices. The environment is a little noisy but nothing is making me feel rushed to eat.  I really enjoyed my chorizo omelette and found the potatoes to be done perfectly. The coffee is excellent and the cinnamon donut muffin is a must try."}
{"text":"I entered Marigold Kitchen 10 minutes before they were closing and to my surprise they still welcomed me to stay and eat to my content. All the staff was really friendly. The chicken tostada I ordered was very flavorful and had more than enough to make me full. I would definitely recommend my friends to come eat here"}
{"text":"So delicious. I had the chile poached eggs with procuitto and manchago and toast with a side of yogurt. The yogurt tasted so fresh and flavorful even though it was plain. My husband had blueberry pancakes. They were good but nothing mind blowing. Coffee was good as well."}
{"text":"I had the best chile braised chicken sandwich that I have ever had here at Marigold Kitchen! You walk up to the counter, order, pay, and get your number. Then find a seat and wait for someone to bring the food. Very relaxed and very comfy. The grilled cheese was good too!Great food!!"}
{"text":"We ate here a few years ago on a trip to Madison. This time we just wanted breakfast on our way back to Chicago from The Dells. The food is as delicious and freshly prepare as I remember. We were a group of 6 with a few picky eaters, including an 11 year old. Everyone loved their food. A big hit were the pancake, french toast, and the side of potatoes/their version of hash browns that come with the omletes."}
{"text":"OMG- do NOT visit Madison without stopping here for breakfast!!!  There are many places to have brunch in Madison...  I have not been to all of them, only a few.  But of ALL the brunch locations I have been to throughout the country this was great!  Warning... it is busy... lines out the door... but a line in this case means you are in for a treat!!  Honestly the line for us moved pretty quickly and was worth it!  Walk in and the color palate (exposed old farm boards) and decor is very welcoming- farm to table co-op like feel.  Place your order at the register, pay, and they give you an order number sign to place on a table you choose.  A server will hunt down your number and present your tasty meal! I had a cup of coffee, the jumbo mimosa and berry french toast.  Coffee tasted great, mimosa was good, but the French toast.... AMAZING!!!  Our server and the other servers we encountered were smiling, engaged and genuinely seemed to enjoy the pulse and business!  I am a stingy 5 star rater... so I hope you go, enjoy and agree that this is a Madison gem!"}
{"text":"There is a lot to like about Marigold Kitchen.   Delicious food, eye opening coffee, and pretty good prices.  Would go here for coffee over the coffeeshops in the area that serve WAY too much milk with far too little coffee and call it a cappuccino.  You definitely need to be in the mood for the flavors of their signature dishes but there is something for everyone here.  Do wish there was more to pick from in between their gut buster and their 2 egg meals."}
{"text":"A little pricey but always delicious! Love the lavender white mocha. I usually get the seasonal pancakes or seasonal scramble. I like the ambiance of the place too."}
{"text":"Best, freshest soups and salads in Madison.  A great place to dine for lunch if you have the patience to wait for a table.  The food is ALWAYS outstanding, however the restaurant can be busy and noisy (cement everywhere).    You will leave feeling you have eaten one of the healthiest meals ever, but don't go if you're in a rush.  Take time to enjoy the food here with some good friends!"}
{"text":"Breakfast ends 10:30, lunch begins 11.  Between those times?  SOL."}
{"text":"They used to not be open on Sundays and only brunch for Saturdays which made it difficult to dine there if I don't happen to be downtown.  Their breakfast items are good, and my favorite breakfast dish may be the prosciutto with poached eggs.  I've also really enjoyed their chicken salad sandwiches with their red cabbage slaw.  The cumin seeds in the cabbage slaw was genius."}
{"text":"Get a two eggs sunny side up with greens side of sausage and avocado and rosemary toast. Delicious!!! Their sausage is just wow.   Great decor makes you feel like at home with the chalk written wall menu. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"OMG.. we stumbled upon Marigold Kitchen by accident, and after eating GLUTEN FREE pancakes I understand the Yelp reviews. This place is fantastic and friendly for vegetarians, vegans, GF, etc.   The gluten free pancakes were delicious and topped with some delicious apple butter deliciousness. I would come back here in a heartbeat. Yes, it's not the cheapest breakfast, but I'll pay for real gluten free pancakes.  Everyone else was very pleased with their meals, and the steady flow of customers flowed through the entire time we ate. I'd come back here anytime in Madison!"}
{"text":"I was surprised to find out that this was a super casual place to eat. One of those places where you order at the front, grab a number, find a spare table, and wait as the servers find you and bring your food. Bottomless coffee is self serve.   The blueberry pancakes are really fluffy and eggy. The batter itself isn't sweet and the stack of three is topped with powdered sugar and rolled oats. Yum. The oats really do it for me. Is this is Midwest thing or have all the gazillion breakfast places I've been to on the West Coast just happen to not to that?   We also got an egg white omelet with artichokes, topped with a smidge of asiago. The marigold potatoes on the side were good but like most other patrons, we barely finished. I also appreciated how lightly they added vinaigrette dressing to the side salad.   I wish this place was cleaner. And the bussers faster. We had to flag down a busy busser/server to wipe our table. Atmosphere was your standard organic-feeling breakfast place but nothing stood out. I liked Cafe Soleil's setup better."}
{"text":"Could live on their pancake specials and their grilled chicken salad. Everything is fresh, from scratch, and super tasty."}
{"text":"Love this place! We eat here for brunch every time we are in town. Quick, friendly service and delicious food! Our family ranges from very traditional eaters to foodies and this place has something for everyone. Today, two had the breakfast sandwich and both really enjoyed it. I had the sweet potato hash and it was amazing. I like that many of the dishes come with a light mixed greens salad. Only downside is the place is rather small and can get crowded at peak hours so probably not the place if you want to linger over coffee or bloodies with friends or family."}
{"text":"Wow wow wow wow wow.  First time to Madison and had just one day for breakfast and everyone's first response when asked about breakfast options was \"go to Marigold Kitchen.\"  So glad we did!  This place was outstanding!!!!!  It is a self serve place in the sense that you order at the counter, you get a number, and then they bring you your food.  Coffee is also bottomless self serve, that is, unless you get a latte or other fancy coffee.  And may I recommend their Almond milk Latte.  Holy cow balls... that one is good!  So, being it was Christmas season... they were handing out spiked Egg nog samples.  That was awesome!   I ordered the Three Grain Saute.  It was a vegan dish with Quinoa, Barley, and other good stuff, topped with an egg (okay, that is not vegan so get it without the egg if you want it vegan).  Seriously, one of the best breakfast dishes I've ever had!  It was so tasty.  And generally, vegan stuff has no taste.  But this was so flavorful!  I could've ate another bowl.  And I had a cinnamon donut to go too.  Um yes, that was good too.  I wish I had another day... I would've gone there again."}
{"text":"This was a yummy place suitable for breakfast or brunch. You can tell they use fresh ingredients and their menu selection is pretty healthy. The format is an order at the counter and pick a table deal. It was pretty crowded on a Sunday and my family and I had to watch to snag a table. I'm not going to lie, I wasn't completely full after this meal. Who know, maybe I was just starving? But if I was still hungry, I can only imagine how my dad was feeling and he ate the same dish as me."}
{"text":"So delicious!!! Try the lemon chicken tortilla soup!!"}
{"text":"TLDR; it's overrated.  I came here on a Sunday morning, and it wasn't too crowded. We were able to get seats fairly easily.  The food came out pretty quickly as well. I got the scrambler, and my friend got the pumpkin pancakes. The scrambler came with marigold potatoes, toast, and of course the eggs. The pancakes just came on their own. The eggs were scrambled and came with peppers and cheese. They were not terrible, but not great. It just tasted like cheese and was devoid of flavor. The potatoes were bland as well. The pumpkin pancakes were dry and falling apart, but buttered really well. I would not come here again."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good. The atmosphere leaves something to be desired.    I liked the potatoes quite a bit, and the sausage.  I didn't like the overcrowded nature of the place."}
{"text":"Generally really good food, although not everyone likes their particular style of breakfast potato (pan-fried with rosemary).  love their coffee.  Only complaints are that it's rather cramped and gets INSANELY crowded on Saturdays, and it's closed on Sundays!  I don't get that.  On weekdays, though, it's generally a nice spot for brunch/lunch, not too crowded."}
{"text":"We have been eating here for years! Every.single.time we are in Madison, this is the spot, if it is open. We love the reclaimed, farm, country, fresh vibe. Their food is great and creative. We clearly think this is one of the best brunch places in Madison. For example, our most recent visit to Madison for IMWI weekend we ate here three times, twice in one day. My favorite main stay menu item is the breakfast sandwich. I do enjoy the surprise of seeing what specials they have up on the chalkboard to try. I tried their BBQ chicken sandwich. It was amazing. My fiance always gets one of their omelets with egg whites. The ordering goes fast, even when there is a long line. They are usually well prepared for crowds. We have never had an issue with finding seating no matter how busy it has been. The turn over is pretty good. Cannot wait for our next trip up to Madison!"}
{"text":"Marigold is a cute little place. I got the Spiced Pumpkin Pancakes. They were good, but very sweet. Overall, it was enjoyable and I would return. Their omelettes sound fantastic!"}
{"text":"Marigold Kitchen is easily my favorite brunch/lunch place in Madison. Just thinking about the food has my mouth watering!! They always have yummy vegetarian and vegan options which I appreciate. If I had to choose one brunch place that represents Madison culture and food it would be Marigold."}
{"text":"Marigold's Potatoes and Pancakes are out of this world. But Sadly I refuse to take part and enjoy the food of a company that discriminates against those with disability. Owners John and Phillip are wonderful people and owners of other amazing restaurants such as Sardine and Gates and Brovi. I don't think they realize the unethical and illegal principles that are being practices at the Marigold Kitchen. I am sadly disappointed and outright appalled what has taken place and the first hand discrimination with the Marigold team that I have received. I will not speak for all Marigold staff as some are a joy but I will just say that those staff that I speak of know who they are. Lastly I use to enjoy the atmosphere and feel very content there, because of the local comfort food and the comfort ability that Marigold brought to my life but after being slandered and discriminated against my disability I will be finding another place to call my breakfast/brunch home."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this breakfast spot.  It has a small town feel in the heart of Madison.  We grabbed a menu, ordered at the counter, and patiently waited for breakfast nirvana to be delivered.  I had the scrambler with chorizo, green chilies, and cheddar cheese.  It tasted very fresh with great flavors.  They really did a nice job.    The interior is very inviting, but it is pretty small so I could see it filling up quickly.  When we came there was no wait.  The staff was courteous and attentive.  I believe the majority of their food is sourced locally as much as possible.  This was definitely the right choice for breakfast."}
{"text":"Great concept and busy on a Friday mid morning with post Yoga students. Food is over-thought and small portions make the value a bit questionable. I like it but it needs a reboot."}
{"text":"I travel to Madison for business and wish I had discovered this place sooner.  Saturday breakfast with a friend was excellent. Coffee was great and I had the scramble with sausage, peppers, cheese and other tasty ingredients. This place is a find and I'll be back on my next trip to Madison."}
{"text":"Delicious!  You order at the counter and then find seating.  Even though the place was very busy, the waiters were very helpful in finding us seating and getting us through the ordering/seating process quickly.  The food was fantastic and every person in our 6 party group loved their meals.    They also gave the 1 child in our group a free cupcake for eating all of his breakfast.  All around, a great experience."}
{"text":"On any given day, the breakfast dishes at Marigold range from phenomenal to un-freaking-believably-good.   On any given day, the service system at Marigold ranges from mildly inconvenient to mind-blowingly frustrating.   There are enough reviews here that sing the praises of Marigold's food. I wholeheartedly agree with them all - so instead I'm going to try and offer some suggestions that can help you navigate the conundrum that is Marigold's seating situation. As noted per other reviews, you stand in line to order at the counter - then wait in the little waiting area - then an employee leads you to a table. At least, that's how it's supposed to work.   On my most recent visit, however, people were grabbing tables while they were still in line. These folks probably didn't see the teeny tiny sign outside the restaurant that lays out the table etiquette - most likely due to the fact that the sign is indeed, teeny tiny. When this happens, Marigold employees have to decide whether to 1) ask these people to get up, which is awkward or 2) let them sit there, which screws over people waiting patiently after ordering at the counter.   I think Marigold could do a better job of communicating the seating policy  -either by having a full-time host at the front of the restaurant or posting more signage. Probably both.   Until they change the policy though - I would not suggest dining at Marigold with a large group unless you arrive very early or late in the dining cycle. I would not suggest eating at Marigold if you want to sit and chat for an hour or two over food (you will feel awkward with people staring at you while waiting for your table).   What I will suggest is going to Marigold with a small group, 2-4 people, and following the seating etiquette. The employees will find you a spot - and if others are snagging tables before they're supposed to - give them the stink eye or say \"screw it\" and grab a table yourself.   The experience is less frustrating if you know what to expect - and the food at Marigold really is worth it."}
{"text":"Despite the wait on weekends, the food is totally worth it.  I love their omelets and their rosemary sourdough toast."}
{"text":"One of the best brunches in Madison can be had at Marigold Kitchen.  For you Chicagoans, this place is remarkably similar to Birchwood Kitchen--from the setup (placing your order at the register and then having staff deliver your food), to the menu, which features classics as well as eclectic items. And everything is homemade, right down to the mayonnaise used in their sandwiches.  Marigold is a busy place, serving breakfast, brunch, and lunch, but they manage to keep everything moving smoothly. It seems to be a very well-oiled machine.  We went for brunch, and the menu had so many great choices that I kept changing my mind; should it be the artichoke, oven-roasted tomato and asiago cheese omelette, the duck confit hash, the French toast with berry puree, or the \"scrambler\"? Man, I tell you, everything sounded mouthwatering. And what's this? $5 breakfast cocktails made with fresh-squeezed juices? Now I had to decide between a mimosa, greyhound, screwdriver, or bloody mary. Life is hard.  I went with the \"scrambler,\" an egg dish mixed with sautéed cremini mushrooms, oven-roasted tomatoes, and pesto cream cheese. It was fanfreakingtastic on its own, but then it comes with Marigold potatoes and French rosemary toast. I did think the potatoes were a tad greasy, but overall they were delicious. But what's up with places that are too scared to toast bread so that it has some actual color? I want toast, not hard bread that makes me feel like I'm eating something stale instead of toasted. Don't be afraid to get some brown on that bitch!  My trusty dining companion enjoyed an omelette with zucchini, roasted red peppers, goat cheese, and parmesan. I was able to sneak a bite and can report that it too, was a solid choice.  We sat on the patio as we drank our perfectly spicy bloody marys and iced lattes and watched the people and pups stroll by. What a great place. I'm jealous of people that live in Madison.  I am so coming back here. After all, I haven't even tackled the lunch menu. I spied a turkey and artichoke grilled cheese, warm spiced squash salad and a chutney chicken salad sandwich. And that was just the first page of the menu.   Let the indecision begin...."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Fun atmosphere. We have a new favorite in Madison.  Highly recommend coming before 9 on weekends as it gets very busy."}
{"text":"Came here on a Wednesday at around 10am and it wasn't too busy. I came to this place because I've heard so much hype about this being one of the best breakfast places in Madison. Overall, I enjoyed my visit to Marigold's. I ordered the Scrambler which consisted of eggs, sausage, spinach, cheddar, and sweet corn. Now I would have never paired eggs and sweet corn but it was absolutely delicious! The staff is very attentive and kind and the overall feel of the restaurant felt very homey."}
{"text":"A while back the two Marigold owners started a seemingly Madison revolution in cuisine and I've loved going ever since.  I love the care they take with the food and the fun and friendly atmosphere.  If only it weren't so chaotic and crowded, but why should I think such a great place wouldn't get noticed?"}
{"text":"had the sweet potato, kale hash and pancakes- both were really tasty!  Fast, friendly service  Tea water could be hotter though!"}
{"text":"Very good breakfast. You can tell a lot of care is taken with the food. Very friendly staff and nice casual atmosphere."}
{"text":"Marigold has a cool ambiance for brunch. It's order first then seat yourself with self serve coffee and water. I enjoy the setting although I think the food is over priced and tastes comparable to other brunch places around Madison."}
{"text":"A friend told me about this place. I recommended it to another Yelper before I even tried it. Today was my chance.  Grabbed a menu and went up to order. I asked the cashier for recommendations. She pointed out the egg scramble special. Sold!   Three eggs scrambled with chorizo, smoked gouda, & sweet corn, served with side of amazing Marigold potatoes and choice of toast. I loved every bite.   The classic Bloody Mary was solid, too!  Delicious house made jam on every table is a nice touch. Today was Orange jam.  Staff walked around offering coffee refills. Staff was very friendly and helpful, and the atmosphere was like a neighborhood coffee shop.  Marigold is open for breakfast and lunch.  Excellent food and service! I would definitely come back!  The only downside I could see is that people come to just hang out so tables can get tied up, but sidewalk seating is also available."}
{"text":"Marigold has become our reliable brunch spot when no one is willing to make a decision. The scrambler special is almost always exactly what I want and in my opinion they have, hands down, the best breakfast potatoes. Their drinks, alcoholic and non-alcoholic, are also a major strength.   That being said, there are some thing that I wish were different about Marigold. It is delicious and everyone knows it-- so it is extremely busy all morning on weekends. This is not the place to come with friends expecting to linger. Get in, wait for a seat, eat your meal, get out. It's definitely enjoyable throughout the process, but you do feel the pressure to get-to-stepping. I would also say that their savory dishes are definitely superior to their baked goods.   As a whole, though, Marigold is still one of my favorite places for brunch in Madison."}
{"text":"I had their Veggie Sandwich (spinach, asparagus, mushrooms, tomatoes - I think that was it) and upgraded to the pasta side. It was really good! The sauce on the sandwich was very tasty too! I really liked the cheese that was sprinkled on the pasta/veggie side as well.   The service was quick (we did take out so that we could watch a live band at the Capitol).   The place is a normal sized restaurant for downtown Madison - so good for smaller groups. I had my stroller which was hard to maneuver around the space, but people were nice & friendly and ok with my bulkiness."}
{"text":"Solid breakfast food in a very comfortable ambiance. I ordered their breakfast scramble with sourdough bread as well as an orange juice. Everything was fresh and made well, unpretentious and satisfying, and not too expensive.  Marigold, like many contemporary brunch places, does modern American breakfast food like scrambled eggs or hash browns and gives it a lift - a touch of spice, extra flavoring, quality cheese and farm-fresh vegetables. It's these little details, difficult to accomplish at home, that make going to a restaurant worth the time and cost. And being cozy in their pleasant, unassuming atmosphere is a great way to start the day."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for breakfast!  The salmon frittata is to die for.  The staff is very friendly as well."}
{"text":"OK, so you are in town for a conference (Epic UGM?), you did all the activities, and you got a morning to kill before you leave town. THIS IS YOUR SPOT. Really tasty breakfast food made with fresh ingredients. Don't think Denny's or some other diner spot. This is not your mom and dad's fried eggs and pancakes. I think they stop serving breakfast by 11 or so, so get there early. Great food, great people, nice, lively location."}
{"text":"A good, solid place for breakfast. People were raving about it and I stopped in. The food is good. I wouldn't say it will change your life, but I don't think they are TRYING to change your life. I think that they are trying to provide a nice, warm, cozy atmosphere and good quality food. They do just that."}
{"text":"The Marigold kitchen was so cool! The decor was very cute, perfectly bright and cheery for a brunch spot. I got the marigold breakfast sandwich and my friend got the duck hash, we were both extremely happy with our meals! The food came out pretty quickly, and the coffee drinks came out Ina reasonable about of time given the crowd. I got the lavender white chocolate mocha and LOVED it....it was so pretty too with the design in the foam! My friend got the regular iced coffee and said it was ok. They also have bloodys and mimosas, but we didn't try them on this visit, maybe next time!"}
{"text":"Gotta love this place. Excellent sandwiches and soups and nice staff. I would recommend the daily specials- every time I tried I was very glad I did."}
{"text":"I've come here a handful of times, and never had anything bad. I did get one uninspiring scramble once, so I will avoid that item...but all together a solid menu.  Recently, after getting a haul at the DCFM on Saturday morning, we popped in(and yes, it was BUSY). I decided to finally try the breakfast sandwich that my boyfriend has always raved about(and usually ordered).   Oh. My. Gloriousness.   Pretty much the perfect sandwich, if a bit messy.   Sadly, after sitting at the counter in view of the cooking action(*deliciousness spoiler alert*), I don't think my conscience will ever let me get the breakfast potatoes again. No person needs to ingest that much butter in one sitting--or one week. We're talking big whopping dollops going into the skillet."}
{"text":"My family and I tried this place out this morning and it was really good. I think my wife loved the cinnamon doughnut muffins the most. The breakfast was pretty standard and my son ate all of his food. Any place where my son can clean the plate is a good place to me. I like the atmosphere of the place and that you order your food, tip and pay before your food is served. That is cool. With kids, I hate waiting for checks. I wish more places did this. The Capitol is right outside the restaurant. Just a good food place and I picked this place based on reviews from Yelp, so I will add on to the fan crowd."}
{"text":"The only reason Marigold's doesn't have a higher rating is because you will most likely need to wait in a really long line before you order and are seated.  Other than that, the food here is exceptional.  This is another organic local restaurant in Madison, but they specialize in Breakfast/Lunch.  The food really is exceptional.   Most places I go to, I usually think what here can I make on my own for significantly less.  There are very few places that can have as simple menus as Marigold's but have a result of me saying, 'I really can't replicate this'.  The breakfast sandwich is astoundingly simple, delicious, and impossible to reproduce.  The cream sauce they put on it is just ridiculous.  They're really well known for their french toast, which is really good, but isn't as unique.  They're specialty duck confit hash is something you will never be able to have elsewhere and is absolutely delicious.  One big thing is don't be tricked into the orange juice.  It's expensive and the amount is so miniscule as to be laughable."}
{"text":"Fabulous spot that we try to visit every time we are Madison for a football game. They have a great variety of fresh made treats.  We like the big breakfast sandwiches and their brioche French toast is an amazing indulgence that you've got to try at least once in your life.  The place can be pretty hectic on a football Saturday so there may be a bit of a wait. Grab a menu when you are in line so you are ready to order to keep things moving.  Pay, take your number THEN be seated. This keeps things moving for everyone.  There is not a ton of seating in this small spot."}
{"text":"Good food and most of the staff was friendly. we were super hungry and didn't mind the way to order food. Some of the flavors were on the strong side for me like the potatoes being too peppery...but that was the way it was made and tasted pretty good. You could definitely tell the eggs were fresh and had good flavor. The barista, jory (i would come back just cuz of her friendly and helpful attitude), was awesome! we chatted it up and she told me how they make their own syrups like the lavender white chocolate...but I opted for the ice salted caramel latte and the flavor was delicious and wonderfully made. Then we had the pancake special which was AmAZing! a wheat rhubarb short stack of pancakes with cinnamon marscapone and cinnamon strudel and drizzle....it really was the perfect combo! Thought the pricing was decent for the amount of food given and quality. Would definitely go back to try more specials. Get the specials! Lol"}
{"text":"We went here based off of Yelp reviews and were excited when we got there and saw a line out the door. The experience was average and we probably would not go back next time we come to Madison. After ordering at the register, the food came to the table before the drinks. I had to send my food back because, even though the place was super busy, my beans and omelette were cold. The omelette was average, the breakfast sandwich that my husband got was very fresh and tasted good and the chocolate zucchini pancakes were tasty as well."}
{"text":"This place is great for lunch...good food, there can be a wait for tables, and it's crowded. They are not open on Sundays for brunch! WHY?  I recommend the burgers.  They are incredibly awesome."}
{"text":"Great brunch/ breakfast place. Tried their roasted sweet potato and kale hash with walnut pesto, blueberry pancakes and the almond latte. All were great. They even gave us free orange cranberry  scones and doughnuts."}
{"text":"I walked in and went to sit at an open table, but was quickly told by my friend that that's not the way it works here. You order straight away at the counter and then find a table; I think this makes more sense during a busy time, but I just awkwardly stood reading the menu at the front when there were plenty of open seats to leisurely choose my breakfast. Anyways, not a big deal but also I didn't love that aspect of my experience.   Super friendly, attentive staff. Food was good, my friend got the scrambler which he loved. I admit my order was a little less exciting- cocoa ricotta pancakes and a side scrambled eggs, but I was underwhelmed. I would go back to try more of their specials as I really did like the atmosphere there. Cute decor and a loud buzz of conversations across the room."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch and it was the perfect thing on a cold Madison day.  The tomato Parmesan soup was delicious.  The sandwich special was a turkey panini which was excellent as well.  All in all I was very impressed with this place.  Only negative comment is that the ginger iced tea was an acquired taste of which I was not a fan."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots in Madison. Great breakfast!  I've been here a couple times for breakfast and a couple times for lunch. I prefer their breakfast to their lunch, mainly because there was too much corn in the salad and I'm not that into corn. Both times I've had eggs any style with their potatoes, toast and bacon. Their potatoes are DELICIOUS!!! Love their potatoes! My dad had their biscuits and gravy which he said were very good. They also have great mimosas.   I love the atmosphere of the restaurant with the bright colors. It's very cozy and fun. I will continue to eat at Marigold's as long as I live in Madison."}
{"text":"The only problem with this place is too many people know how good the food is so finding a table can be difficult.  You have to order and pay before you sit down so there is always the chance you won't get a seat after you have paid.  Other then that, it's a five star meal."}
{"text":"We stayed in Madison for a week on a business/wedding planning trip, and ate here three separate weekday mornings.  The FH had visited and insisted this was the only/best place to go for breakfast on the square, if not in Madison.  Having lived in Madison as a student and eating many delish Madison breakfasts (Lazy Jane's, Sunroom, etc.), I was a bit skeptical.  However, Marigold truly lived up to his claims and trumped nearly all of my prior breakfast experiences in the city (except maybe the waffles at Indie Coffee).  Yes, you are not supposed grab a seat until you order.  This is a good policy; I like it.  We never had a problem finding a table, nor did we see anyone struggle with it.  Granted, these were weekdays and the weather made using the outdoor seating both possible and appealing.  Still, there was plenty of signage and little confusion, and I appreciate the fair spirit of the policy.  The food was outstanding all three days.  Standouts were the chilli poached eggs, with their excellent execution and beautiful presentation, the massive slices of fluffy quiche, and the iced chai lattes, which were beautifully spicy and never tasted exactly the same twice, which I hopehopehope means they make their own blend.  And, coming in from Seattle, we really appreciate that breakfast cost only about $20 each day for two satisfying plates and two nicely sized coffee/tea drinks.  I knocked them down one star because one day their service was pretty off.  They were busier than any of the other days there and did appear to be training to new people, but we ended up getting our drinks (in messy cups) quite a bit after we received our plates.  This meant that the FH's Americano was still undrinkably hot even though we had nearly finished out meals.  Our drink and meal delivery had been perfectly paced the first two days, so this was kind of a downer.  Still, this is only a minor blemish in three days of excellent, reasonably priced food and prompt service in a cute little restaurant that is a short walk from the accommodations on the square."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and me ran into this place and what a surprise! I ordered duck hashbrown with eggs any style and my boyfriend ordered fritta (?) The duck confit is really good and I enjoyed it a lot. There is too much salad coming with the order and I cannot finish all.   A great nice place to go."}
{"text":"First time here. Tip: Order first THEN you will be seated!! LOL. We both ordered the Bacon Spinach omelette with cream cheese- it was heavenly! I could skip the potatos next time-soggy. Sour dough toast was great. If you get here and have a long line- give it a couple of minutes. The turn over is like a well oiled machine and fast.  Staff is awesome and don't seemed stressed as people are stand out the door waiting to get in."}
{"text":"What a fun place. Found this on Yelp and had walked by it several times. Unique and interesting menu...had trouble selecting a choice for breakfast today. Changed my mind twice and then ended up with one of the daily specials...a scramble. It was good but not exceptional. Loved the rye toast. Great (and endless cups of...) coffee. Would try pancakes the next time I think. Servers were very friendly."}
{"text":"Marigold is a cute and cosy place for brunch.  The coffee was good but expensive; however, there was \"free\" refills, so that was okay. I got the french toast and while I enjoyed, I thought it was slightly gooey on the inside and the edges was slightly dry.  The maple syrups was perfect for me -it tasted light and not too sweet!  I thought it was slightly expensive for a french toast that was just slightly above average."}
{"text":"I love this place.  It's only open for breakfast and lunch and they don't have a ton of options, but what they do have is delicious.  Really fresh, clearly good ingredients, and prepared right.  Good atmosphere too.  I'm getting hungry just thinking about it."}
{"text":"I am definitely a fan of Merigold.   I've been here several times and have enjoyed everything a ton!  Mad props on the quiche. It manages to be creamy and fluffy and rich but not heavy. It's basically magic. If Wingardium Leviosa was a food, this is what it would taste like.   Protip: If you are meeting up with a group, they don't take reservations and you order before taking a seat. So make sure everyone in your party has arrived or texted you their order."}
{"text":"Marigold is crazy busy over the lunch rush because the food is quite good. Yeah, it's not super comfortable and the seats are like bricks, which they try to tart up with fancy pillows but this doesn't really work, but it's still very good food that comes up quickly and with little fuss. Excellent little place for lunch."}
{"text":"My husband and I were on a leisure visit to the city. We were especially interested in finding a cafe with really great healthy food. This restaurant was ranked high and the menu looked interesting. We loved this place! We had the daily scrambler with potatoes, which was so delicious paired with rosemary toast. I loved the decor and colors that I could relax and enjoy my surroundings. However, my husband and I would agree that the best part of our meal was the espresso! They knew how to pull the perfect shot and we enjoyed a couple of awesome Americanos. Unforgettable! Highly, highly recommend this place for breakfast...and espresso!"}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place because it has a sunny sounding name and the interior is filled with light.  On the weekday morning that I visited it was bustling but there were empty seats at the bar and front window to sit with a cup of coffee and breakfast.  Except at 10:30 they had stopped serving breakfast so I had a scone instead - not a painful sacrifice but not the hot breakfast I'd anticipated.  The coffee choices had cutesie names.  I got the Americano, which turned out to be black coffee served in a huge wide mug that was impossible to carry without sloshing.  I sloshed my way to the sugar and cream stand and back to my spot at the counter, leaving a trail of Americano behind. The scone was good."}
{"text":"I pretty much love this place.  I've been here probably 4-5 times within the last 6 months, and everything I've had has been tasty.  I like the atmosphere, on the cozy side, but it seems bright and energetic (probably because it's always crowded when I'm there during weekend brunch hours.)  The coffee is solid and I really like all the pasties I've tried.  The ones that stand out are the chocolate tart and the apricot tart.  The entrees are really good too - the ones I tried most recently was the duck confit hash (so yummy) - the highlight of this dish for me is the root vegetables, and the lemon ricotta pancakes (so flavorful!).  I'm also a huge fan of jams and jellies made in house."}
{"text":"Amazing food! I love how all the food ingredients are from WI! I had the duck confit and it was amazing! The service and atmosphere were great!"}
{"text":"The food was great and the servers are really pleasant and always smiling! I'd definitely recommend it! Even though it was pretty packed we received great service. I would recommend the Duck  Confit Hash. We thought the Heirloom Bloody Mary was too sour. The food is great though! Perfect location just a stone's throw away from the Farmer's  Market and the Capitol building."}
{"text":"In the words of Usher: these are my confessions. I've lived in Madison on and off since 2002 and have lived just a couple of blocks from Marigold for the last 2.5 years, yet I just went for the first time in December. I KNOW.   While a couple friends were passing through on their way from Minneapolis to Milwaukee we decided to grab lunch. It was hard to make a choice between so many tasty-sounding dishes, but in the end the Guajillo Braised Chicken sandwich with a red cabbage side salad called my name the loudest.   The sandwich was delicious, its tender chicken and slightly spicy chipotle sauce melding into the ciabatta roll on which it was served. I opted to skip the raw red onion and cilantro, but the romaine gave enough of a fresh contrast that I didn't feel like the sandwich was missing anything.   The cabbage salad was less successful for me. The flavor was okay, and I generally really enjoy cabbage, but the thing I enjoy about cabbage is the crunch. This salad was (intentionally) wilted and the softer texture just didn't appeal to me. Different strokes for different folks; next time I'll upgrade to an alternate side.   I had to make a quick exit to let my locked-out boyfriend into our apartment, but I had been considering getting back in line to get one of the amazing-looking chocolate walnut cookies that were in the pastry case.   We went the Friday before Christmas and the holly-jolly was in full effect. A couple of ladies were going around with complimentary egg nog (boozy and not, depending on how merrily along you were in your holiday) and it was intensely creamy. From my seat I saw our neighbors had Marigold's signature potatoes and I most definitely need to get back to shove those in my face ASAP.   Regretting it took me so long to visit, but looking forward to starting a beautiful relationship with my neighborhood cafe."}
{"text":"I came up for the farmer's market but saw the many recommendations for here.  Definitely worth it to come here!  There is a parking garage nearby if you can't find parking at a meter.  Although there may seem to be a considerable line, there are 2 order takers who do a pretty good job.  Then you have to find a table if you're not taking it to go.  When it gets full, there is a side waiting area where servers then help find you a table.  They always have a few specials mentioned on the big board, but I stick with some of the regulars.  The duck confit hash is great.  They use chunks of duck and their potatoes to create a solid breakfast meal along with your choice of eggs and a side salad.  The breakfast sandwich is pretty good as well since they toast their ciabatta bread.  It's a hearty start to the day.  The only drawback is that it can be pretty busy so it does take some time for orders to be filled and it's a little crowded inside.  Otherwise, a great option for brunch!"}
{"text":"I can't believe how long it took me to find Marigold!  Such a great place for a quick but relaxing brunch in Madison.  I enjoyed the heirloom blood mary while waiting for my food, and omg is it good!  Very unique, with fresh bits of stuff floating around in it, and a nice level of spice.  For my entree I had the special of the day, which was a chili meatloaf on brioche with fried eggs.  Holy crap, amazing.  Everything my friends got looked amazing as well.  Honestly, I don't think you can go wrong at Marigold!"}
{"text":"The duck confit hash is just pure indulgence.  I wouldn't come in expecting a duck breast that rivals that from le bec fin or sardine but the meat is decent and it was the first time that I had duck with potatoes and eggs for breakfast.  A novel combination but a very delicious one!  It was very crowded and busy but the food is good and cheap ($10 for the ash and a side salad)."}
{"text":"Mmmmm rosemary bread and strong coffee! The quiche was also amazing.  Cute little find."}
{"text":"Stands out as one of the best parts of my year in Madison. They have a great set up where you wait through a line to order, and by the time you've placed your order there is always a table open (and don't be one of those people who takes a table before ordering. You mess it up for everyone else and I promise, they work their marigold magic and something will open up before you get your food, even at noon on a Sunday). So great atmosphere, friendly staff, fun restaurant.   Where they really stand out, is the food. I am going to try to recreate the chile poached eggs at home, but I know it won't be as good. I don't know what they do to the potatoes, but YUM. The ever-changing pancakes? Always creative and amazing. And make sure you try the rosemary sourdough.   If I ever make it back to Madison, this will be my first stop. Thanks for a delicious year, Marigold!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing! As the atmosphere/decor, service and food is simply wonderful ! As you enter the restaurant the aroma of fresh cooked meals caress your appetite. We went there for brunch so we had plenty of options to chose from. We had gotten the blueberry pancakes with the side of pancakes and the chilaquiles with the green sauce, avacados, eggs over easy, and the maple latte.  As for the pancakes they are not cooked with flour so they do taste a little different from a traditional pancake. So if you're up for something untraditional go ahead, if you want \"real\" pancakes this might not be the place. As for the chilaquiles they were absolutely delicious, I was scared they would be soggy but they had the right amount crunch. All the food looked to be freshly made. As for the maple latte, get it! Just do it. It's worth it, magic in your mouth!"}
{"text":"If you are seeking quantity and not quality Marigold should be consideration. Potatoes were burned to a crisp and eggs were not cooked fully. Better choices in Madison"}
{"text":"Two words: Breakfast Sandwich.  Super cute place with yummy food.  We also got a single pancake to try which was delish.  The orange almond butter on top was to die for."}
{"text":"Been there many times since it opened 13+ years ago.  Don't recall any disappointments.  Their fried breakfast potatoes are so so good.  Today I have a fried egg and ham sandwich with frisee and the combination of flavors and textures was superb.  My wife had chile poached eggs (which I have had in the past and loved) and she loved them (and the potatoes of mine that she poached from my plate).  I don't think you can go wrong here.  It can get crowded but I've never had to wait for a table.  Parking on the square is free on Sundays, so that's a reason to go on Sunday vs. Saturday when the Farmer's Market makes it extra crowded."}
{"text":"PLEASE ORDER BLUBERRY PANCAKES. Fluffy and light, chock-full of fresh blueberries, and then, sprinkled with some granola and even more fresh blueberries. Topped with delightful orange-zest butter, and served with real maple syrup. All this for 6.95. BEST THING ON MENU."}
{"text":"Stopped in for brunch on our one day Madison tour.    Placed our counter order and found a cozy corner to enjoy our brunch items.  Self serve coffee and water station worked for me.  I actually prefer it.  The tables were fashioned with hot sauce, ketchup, preserves, and salt/pepper.  Yes please.    Overall, a bit pricey for the taste level.  I ordered a brie and cremini mushroom omelet.  Too briney and earthy for my taste, but that was my fault for ordering a brie and mushroom combo.  The side salad was a refreshing addition but the house vinaigrette was a tad lackluster.  The house potatoes were a-ok after some salt sprinklin'.  My partner had the special of the day--an egg scramble with crab, spinach, red bell pepper, and brie.  Too much crab and nothing he would order again.  Our rosemary toast was also just ok.  I prefer my toast to be a bit more substantial and rustic.    I heard rave things about Marigold but didn't experience anything extra special.  I can create more magic in the kitchen than this place my friends.  I would give it another go though.  I want to believe."}
{"text":"Attentive servers. Fast service. Delicious food. Generous portions. Flavorful dishes.  I had the Portobello Mushroom Pesto Breakfast Sandwich with Marigold Potatoes. Savory, spicy, nutty, goodness. My companions has the French Toast & the Scrambler, both great meals, inhaled in record time. As you order at the counter then are seated, with self serve water & coffee, staff guide the newbies through the system respectfully. We'll be back."}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast place in town. Great atmosphere, outdoor seating when the weather's right. Their food and specials are all fantastic, and the bloody marys are great. Try the scrambler special."}
{"text":"This place is great. The food is damn good, the service is friendly, and it's a nice atmosphere to enjoy a meal. It doesn't get extremely loud which is very important as well. It can get a little crowded at times, but that means they're doing everything right so I can't hate on them for that!"}
{"text":"I came here based on my friend Sarah Z's review as well as another friend.  This place was crazy busy packed with a line out the door when we arrived, but somehow there was a table cleared and ready for us by the time we placed out order.  You place your order at the counter and then find a seat.  I couldn't believe how quick the turnover was.  It's like people know it's busy and don't sit around and linger.  The menu isn't crazy extensive, but there's a lot of deliciousness.  They also have daily (or maybe it's weekly) specials.   We split an orange poppy seed muffin which was a little bit dry out the outside, but the middle was still nice and moist - downside of being beautifully displayed in the bakery case.  The flavor was great.  The orange juice my boyfriend ordered was super fresh and delicious.  I ordered the chili poached eggs with came with rosemary toast, proscuitto, and manchego cheese.  It wasn't as spicy as I was expecting which was okay with me because I was mildly worried about it being too spicy for my tastes.  The boyfriend got the chorizo omlette.  The marigold potatoes that came with his breakfast were awesome, and I totally wished I had ordered a side of them for myself."}
{"text":"Everything about Marigold is charming and fulfilling, a variety of seating, super friendly staff, out of this world menu, great drink variety, excellent coffee. It stole my heart!"}
{"text":"This place is very good, but at the end of the day it's still your basic breakfast.  We ordered the chili packed eggs, the confit hash, and the pumpkin buckwheat pancakes.  The pumpkin pancakes were good, but nothing spectacular-- your typical lightly-pumpkin-flavored batter wth a little whipped topping.  The chili poached eggs were something original that I've never seen before though.  A nice touch to add the prosciutto on there. Good food, but nothing outstanding."}
{"text":"Madison Magazine got me again!  After a spread on the 13 best pancakes in Madison I had no choice but to accept the mission before me.  Our first stop?  Marigold Kitchen!  I have had this place bookmarked for a while and was happy to finally get the chance to visit it.  There was tons of parking and the location was easy to find, well after the GPS got involved.   Upon entering the restaurant I noticed that there was what they called 'seating etiquette' which basically said, order with the cashier  then you'll be guided to your seat.  Though this place was jam packed we were able to order right away and did not have to wait to find a seat.  I ordered the blueberry and apricot pancake with bacon as that was the item featured.  Well let me tell you, this place sure did not disappoint.  The pancakes do not look like much just 3 smallish/medium pancakes with a few blueberries on top and a slice of almond butter. Man!  Those pancakes were pretty incredible!  They were really light and just freaking good.  I also ordered the bacon which was good as well, not as standout as the pancake but still good.  I am really looking forward to coming back to this place.  The layout is a bit crammed but in a really cute way.  They also have an awesome menu, I already know what I'm going to try when I go back.  If you haven't been to this place, do yourself a favor and go!  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The seasonal specials that highlight local farmers are incredible. The seating can be tight, but worth the wait."}
{"text":"A rock solid 4 star, could be a 5 star, but they were packed and if it is your first time It is not a sit and eat scenario. You order first then sit, it was confusing. Food was great, but a packed place an confusing format takes a star away."}
{"text":"On my mom's recommendation, we set out for Marigold in the middle of various downtown errands. After a brisk walk across the Square, we ducked down Pinckney Street (right behind the Walgreen's -- you can't miss it!) to find a cozy nook teeming with lunch-ers and savory smells. This HAD to be the place.   We split a grilled cheese (OMFG, guys), chicken soup and took a seven-layer bar for later.  -The sandwich was perfect perfect perfect: cheddar, a little goat cheese, tomato on rosemary bread. The sandwich wasn't too greasy or heavy. It was grilled cheese nirvana.  -My soup was filled with chicken, green stuff (kale, maybe?) and quinoa. It gave me a savory remedy to some early-fall sniffles and encourages me to try to make it myself.  -Seven layer bar requires no explanation.  Sometimes I don't take my mom's advice, but that day I was so happy I did. Marigold is a fantastic little gem hidden among state government buildings and tourist-y cheese shops, and I'm so glad I found it!"}
{"text":"Love this brunch place.  Every time I'm in Madison for work - I make it here for breakfast or to work for a few hours before my next meeting.  So far, every experience at Marigold has been phenomenal. I love the ambiance - it can get busy and noisy but I'm mostly checking emails so it does not bother me much.   To drink - I've had their regular latte (which is delicious) and their Cafe Miel which is also good but a tad too sweet for me.  For breakfast - I've had the Roasted Sweet Potato, Kale, and Basil Walnut Pesto Hash since it's on the healthier option. It was, oh, so delicious and filling.  I've had it several times and every time it keeps being even more delicious.  However, last time I was in town I decided to  try something different. I had the Marigold Breakfast Sandwich and I was pleasantly surprised at how tasty and delicious it was.  It was not greasy and it was the perfect size for me. So good!  Either way - try to make it to Marigold and I'm sure you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"GET OUT OF THE HOTEL  There is one thing I can't stand and it is eating in a hotel run restaurant. Many business travelers eat at a hotel out of convenience. It's close to your room and toothbrush. I like to go outside the box. I can't stand the powdered eggs, lumpy oatmeal, tasteless pancakes, greasy bacon and burnt toast. I need something fresh to start my day.   A few years ago I came across this place and they open at 7am. I love getting out of my hotel room and grabbing a table outside here. Luckily the weather has been pleasant on the times I have visited here.  I imagine dinning outside in February would be brutal plus the coffee would freeze.   This place is also located down the street from the Wisconsin Capital. There website claims you can hit it with one of there muffins because its so close. Is that a challenge? Plus will you bail me out of jail? I'll wait for a message from you before ever trying that. Ha! (On a side note...Dear Gov Walker I would never do that...I was just adding humor to my Yelp Review)  I've tried a few things on the menu, over the years. I do love grabbing a fresh brewed coffee and/or a fresh squeezed OJ. I've also tried the breakfast egg sandwich and the omelette with ham & gruyere cheese on several different occasions. Both breakfast items were delicious. Also the eggs they use are farm fresh and organic. You can really taste the freshness plus its good for you.  I have never tried the lunch menu because I'm usually stuck working but the breakfast is good here.   It is places like this that make my travels fun. It is always exciting to find a delicious new fresh place to eat on the road. The sad part is leaving Madison, after my work is done and then heading home. I never know if I will ever come back and visit, until work sends me this way...the good thing is that Madison is not too far from Chicago, so I can always take a road trip.   If you're in your Madison hotel room reading this at breakfast or lunch (they close at 3pm on weekdays and 2pm on weekends), then it's time to sneak by the crappy breakfast lobby bar and get some real fresh food. The walk over will be pleasant and the capital building is a beautiful building to look at too. Once you arrive, then grab a nice table and start your morning out right."}
{"text":"This is my first time in Madison and my first restaurant we visited.  Well if my experience at marigold kitchen is what Madison is about....this will be my last visit here.  When we approached the counter we were immediately treated as though we were NOT welcome.  I felt more like an inconvenience then a customer.  When we sat my food arrived 15 minutes before the rest of my table did so I ate cold food.  Marigold kitchen...you should be ashamed.  I would recommend McDonald's before marigold kitchen. Don't know the name of the pregnant woman who initially helped us but sounds like she makes a habit of treating customers poorly."}
{"text":"I've eaten breakfast and lunch here for years.  Consistently good food.  Fresh ingredients and a nice atmosphere.  Say hi to Mayor Dave or any other local politician while eating."}
{"text":"With a recommendation from a co worker, I knew we had to add Marigold to our brunch list. Needless to say had a wonderful date with my lady today. The rustic atmosphere is a cozy and inviting place that was reflected by the quality breakfast sandwich and nutty mocha I enjoyed. A perfect combination on a gloomy day. My wife thoroughly enjoyed her iced chai, \"spicy and delicious\""}
{"text":"\"Whatever Lola wants, Lola gets...\"  This song was playing softly over the speakers on a gray, Monday afternoon as I waited for my lunch at the Marigold Kitchen. On a previous visit to Madison, I remember a tasty al fresco brunch that I enjoyed at a sidewalk table. But my fiance reminded me that it's a great lunch spot as well. Understatement!  I'm a huge fan of goat cheese--okay, who am I kidding? I love all cheeses, which is why I'm oh so happy to be moving to Madison next month! I also have somewhat of an addiction to roasted beets. It goes to reason that I had to order the Baked Goat Cheese Salad with Roasted Beets.   Oh my. It was divine! The herb-crusted goat cheese had a delightful light crunch on the outside, and silky gooey-ness on the inside. Other stars were of course the ruby red roasted beets, accented by candied orange peel, shallots, and toasted walnuts. Hands-down, the best salad in the \"goat-cheese-beets-nuts\" category I have ever had.  \"Whatever Stina wants, Stina gets...\" was now running through my head. I also enjoyed a small soup of the day--ham with wheat berries and bok choy. It sounded so strange that I just couldn't pass it up. And it was incredible: perfectly seasoned and balanced with tender wheaty pearls and graceful bites of bok choy greens. Eating at Marigold, I felt like I hadn't enjoyed real food in weeks...months maybe! I could have eaten there all day. I had plate envy of every other diner sitting around me, because I wanted to try it all. Gluttonous? Perhaps. Delicious? Decidedly so.  One note, dear Marigold: please add a coat hook to the bathroom, as it's nice to not have to put our coats/bags on the floor or try to balance them precariously on the baby-changing station. Merci!"}
{"text":"The potatoes. THE POTATOES. I am guilty of going to Marigold and ordering just a double side of potatoes because the perfectly seasoned fried awesomeness is craveworthy and it's NOTHING to be ashamed of.  That being said, if I'm craving the sides just think about the main dishes. Fresh seasonal fruits and veggies, classic breakfast dishes turned on their heads. Every time I visit I'm inspired to go home and attempt to create peach blackberry or chocolate zucchini muffins that will look half as delicious as just ONE of the things in their baked goods case.  I tried the granola pancakes this morning (a special which came with fresh berries). Somehow they made crunchy and fluffy work together in harmony to create a masterpiece of texture. Add real maple syrup and you've lost me."}
{"text":"Great flank steak tacos and eggs for lunch. The pickled radish on top had great acid and balanced the salty carne."}
{"text":"Cute brunch place with a good vibe! Loved the different selection of coffees and baked goods in the front. They have ordering set up in a pretty efficient way, so even though it's always crowded, you'll usually be seated pretty quickly.  I ordered the scrambler, which was three eggs scrambled with a variety of vegetables, and that came with breakfast potatoes, toast, and a side salad.  I also added avocado for $1.50. I thought the prices were pretty fair for the quality and amount of food given-the salad was fresh and dressed with a delicious vinaigrette, and the potatoes had really good flavor.  I liked the eggs, I only wish I had gotten something more unique like the breakfast sandwich-I tried a bite and it was out of this world. My only complaints were that the avocado was a little underripe and the potatoes were slightly soggy-but in a packed brunch spot on a Saturday morning, I think it's understandable. My favorite brunch place to date!"}
{"text":"Came here twice during a stay in Madison. First time around the service was quick and the food was good. Second time around my breakfast took over an hour to be served because the cashier failed to send the order to the kitchen. Nobody thought to check on the empty table with the number? Really?  If you stop by and it's busy, just keep going. Not worth the wait."}
{"text":"Another great brunch spot in Madison! I had the scrambler and my boyfriend got the breakfast sandwich that both came with their potatoes. The potatoes had great flavor with a little spice to it. My scrambler didnt have as much flavor to it, but the breakfast sandwich was delicious. For a simple breakfast sandwich, they perfected it to the T! I also got their almond mocha iced coffee which was really good. The only issue we had was that my food came out 20 mins before his did and I honestly think they just forgot his food or misplaced the ticket, but nonetheless it was a mistake and I would still come back again."}
{"text":"My favorite brunch place in Madison. Great atmosphere, friendly staff, cute decor and amazing food. It's a super cute spot for brunch/breakfast-- you order at the counter, grab a seat and they bring the food to your table. My favorite item is the breakfast sandwich and I love the fresh-squeezed orange juice! It can get really busy really fast, outdoor seating in the summer is really nice."}
{"text":"Came here because of the great reviews and as totally disappointed! Firstly waited in line to order at the counter for about 20 minutes. Friendly service was a plus. Ordered coffee and the chorizo and cheddar cheese omlette with corn relish and wheat toast. Atmosphere was definitely hustle & bustle. It's self serve coffee (unlimited refills). The omlettes came cold with soggy potatos and cold bread dressed up as toast. One of my pet hates is ordering toast and receiving semi warmed up bread that is chewy without the slightest hint of crispiness. Warmed up omlette returned with a smile but for us did not make the grade!"}
{"text":"Hands down, favorite breakfast place in Madison! I've enjoyed everything I've had here, but my favorite dish are the chili poached eggs. Even though they are such a simple dish, Marigold does it perfectly! Their breakfast potatoes are also amazing!"}
{"text":"I brunched al fresco on a gorgeous Saturday morning. I drove from Lombard, IL to get here. I had the quiche special, a blackberry and orange muffin, and fresh squeezed OJ. All of it was DIVINE! The quiche was the largest I've ever seen. Everyone that walked by commented in some form at the size of the quiche. It was as delicious as it was large.   The place was packed when I got there and waited in line to place my order. The line moved quite quickly, so that was nice.  I'd definitely come back here to experience more of their menu. The wait staff were all very friendly too! :)"}
{"text":"Visiting from Texas and stopped here to eat.  My boo had the salmon and pesto sandwich and i had the coconut pancakes with a side of bacon.  Both wet crazy delicious.  His salmon wss moist and the peso and toppings complimented it well.  My pancake were fresh and tasted like coconut macaroons. Yummy!  They do breakfast and lunch right!"}
{"text":"I attended a really lovely rehearsal dinner catered by marigold kitchen.  Staff were great and food was delish."}
{"text":"Searching for a breakfast spot that served vegan food near our hotel we came upon this great place. While a bit pricey for what you get, the food tasted great. I did not order a $4 Chai tea because I thought that was a high price, so I ordered grapefruit juice instead. There was no price marked on it, but I figured it had to be less than $4. WRONG! It was $4! Still, it was delicious (but not worth $4 at all - had I known that was the price, I would have gotten the tea!) The place was packed with people, they told me they are generally this busy every weekend, not so bad on weekdays. They had a line out the door at one point and I wondered where they were going to seat everyone. They really pack the people in and by that I mean they tables are squeezed together closely so that every time someone wanted to walk past your table, they always bumped into you and had to smush themselves against you. I heard lots of \"I'm sorry, I'm just trying to get past you,\" as people came and went back and forth behind us. It was really tight. One larger man had a very tough time getting out from one side of the restaurant to the door, he complained loudly as he tried his best to not bump into every table on the way out, but there was no way he could manage it easily. As for the food, I thought my portion was not going to fill me up, it was on the small side, but it turned out to be just right. Normally, for a meal of that price I am able to have leftovers to take home, but not here. Then I thought I was going to be hungry again in just a couple hours, but I was wrong again! I was full until the next mealtime, like 4 hours later. All in all, we were happy with the place and the food - we'd just make better choices next time, like coming when it's not so busy, and figuring out the prices of things before we order them."}
{"text":"Loved it! We stopped here for a quick omelet breakfast after realizing there was no breakfast offered at our hotel. Good for us though, 'cause we really enjoyed our meal at Marigold Kitchen. The staff were super friendly, our food came out fast for a busy morning and was delicious, and the atmosphere was beautiful. We don't make it to Madison very often, but I do hope to return."}
{"text":"We had breakfast here before going to the farmer's market. Great location for that. You order at the counter then wait for a table to open if crowded. It all seems to run smoothly as,we were there on a very busy morning. My husband got the egg plate and the potatoes were especially good. I had the blueberry pancakes. The syrup was amazing but the pancakes a little bland. I liked the self serve coffee area, especially at breakfast. NO need to wait on the waitress for more coffee. Other items I saw on other tables looked interesting. I would come here again and just try something different."}
{"text":"You either \"get it\" or you don't at marigolds. My mother, a visitor to our fair city, deemed marigolds to be too crowded at 1130 on a Sunday morning. She has never seen it at 930 on a Saturday morning. Once my parents initial shell shock of the hustle and bustle around us wore off, we were able to score some seats and wait for our breakfast.  If you know me, I am a Bloody Mary snob. That bing said, the bloody I had at marigolds was delicious. The mix and seasonings used in the mix were balanced well, and I could sense just the right amount of vodka without it being overpowering.   Between all of us that went out for my bday brunch, I must have tried just about everything. From the scones, to the daily scrambler, to the pancakes, to the French toast, to the quiche, to the breakfast Sammie that was on special that day, everything was great.  My qualm? The coffee. It was exceptionally bitter. And I am a lover of bitter and sour tasting things. Something was just...off. These things happen.  We got in, we got seated, we got served. Great bday brunch in an adorable, brightly lit restaurant."}
{"text":"Perfect outdoor patio on a summer day! At the steps of the Capitol it's fun to watch people and enjoy the day at this great spot.   Great menu with brunch and sandwiches made it hard to decide. Eventually went with the Mediterranean sandwich with purple slaw. It was made with great ciabatta bread, hummus, and fresh vegetables.  The slaw was delicious too.   I love a place that makes it difficult to decide what to order, but you are pleased with your choice. All the plates coming out looked just as good. Order at the counter and the food is delivered. Fun place to go for brunch and lunch."}
{"text":"Nice place and vibe. I really enjoyed my time in this place and had a good food. The portions are not large, so if you're looking at having a good portions for brunch you might need to order more plates pers person. Although the food was good, I felt the price point was higher than the quality and portion of food."}
{"text":"#457 to review. This incredible restaurant is a 5 minute walk from the Hilton Monona Terrace hotel, where we are staying. Loading up before the 70.3 triathlon on Sunday.   Place was packed at 10:30 am. Devoured the large broccoli & feta & walnut pesto omelette.  With the crispy potatoes I was in heaven.   So fresh, so reasonably priced. The cookies are tempting me right now...maybe after the race!!"}
{"text":"Must Visit! Awesome Service!  Fantastic Fresh Food!  My three kids and I each had a unique selection to choose from!  So tough to make a choice! I chose the sausage quiche with field greens.  Kids had blueberry pancakes and gluten free buckwheat pumpkin pancakes, from the kids menu.  Pancakes were served with Wisconsin maple syrup, definite plus! One of the things that really impressed was the service.  Service was friendly, accommodating, and attentive.  Clark the Manager on staff this morning was especially attentive.  He kept busy checking on guests, and tidying up.  My son was especially impressed and mentioned how awesome it was to see Clark working rather than \"bossing his workers around.\"  Great overall experience! Tons of options to choose from, including the fresh baked scones, and signature muffin donuts!  Thanks Clark and Team for a great start to our morning!"}
{"text":"Good food. Nice atmosphere. Food came our really quick even though it was rather busy. The breakfast potatoes were great.  I would have given it five stars, but the \"chorizo\" in my scramble tasted like Italian Sausage."}
{"text":"Marigold is the bomb diggity.  It's so good, in fact, that it might cause you to say stupid things like \"the bomb diggity.\"  Now for all you haters out there (including my dad, who reviewed below) complaining of the crowds and having to wait to sit down......there is a reason that this restaurant is crowded.  If you want a diner and immediate seating, go to denny's.  They have lots of seating, and 3.49 big slams.  They also have bad food, cigarette odors, and powdered coffee.  This place, however, has amazing food every time.  I've honestly never gone wrong in my 3 years of going here.  Standouts include the breakfast sandwich and the blueberry pancakes.  A number of lunch items score high as well, including the frequently rotated soup specials.  I also really like the chile chicken sandwich served with a radiccio side salad.  Prices are on the higher end, but the quality and taste of the ingredients makes me not care.  Food is always fresh.  If you eat in, coffee is bottomless.  Tea is provided by a local tea house (all loose leaf) and is quite tasty.  I challenge anyone to eat a breakfast sandwich here (with cheddar-spiked boursin, that's right, this place spikes their cheese with more cheese- how can a wisconite not be down with that?!).  You will dream about it, salivate over it, and come back again to eat it."}
{"text":"I was searching Madison for a delicious bacon egg and cheese, and I found it. Their breakfast sandwich was probably the best I've ever never made. Each ingredient was a little unique in its own way (though I dont quite remember its exact makeup at this moment). The staff is extremely friendly, and nice. A glass jar containing tea leaves broke behind the counter, and they still had smiles, no signs of negativity towards one another in the public eye  -which make the customer smile.  If I had one complaint, they serve cold brewed iced coffee without any sweetener. Adding sugar to the cold coffee just doesn't sweeten it up as it should, leaving lots of sugar at the bottom. I still enjoyed the coffee though, very rich flavor.  I'm glad they gave me a paper menu to take back home so I can oogle at what I may get next time I'm in Madison."}
{"text":"I LOVE Marigold! I had a perfect plate of flaxseed pancakes here. Hey, I know that sounds a little weird but you don't even really notice the flaxseed and it makes you feel a little better about your breakfast choice. They were golden with the slightest crisp on the outside, which I love, and came with peach/apricot compote that was so delicious and balanced - not too sweet. Also came with mascarpone and some great 100% maple syrup. In fact, I'd really love to know where they get their syrup because it was some of the best I've had. Husband got the pork belly sweet potato hash which was also delicious."}
{"text":"Stopped here on the way up to Devils Lake for a quick bite to eat.  Had a really difficult time trying to find the place.  Had to circle the capital a few times to find the one-block-cut-off Pinckney St.  Beware out-of-towners.  Have to say that my veggie sandwich was flavorful and yummy.  Zucchini, mushrooms and asparagus hit the spot.  The cabbage slaw was quite tasty as well.  Will I be back?  Maybe not.  But stopping at random places with good yelp reviews is how I like to eat!  Even if it does make my husbamd cranky."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and a great Bloody Mary. Spicy like you know you want it."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing!  I have been here 3 times now and I have never been disappointed.  You must must must order a caramel latte and the duck confit hash.  The latte was the creamiest perfectly sweet cup I've ever drank.  The duck confit hash comes with a huge helping of hash and and beautifully dressed spring salad.  If you get there during the summer order their beet salad, superb!  Bravo marigolds!"}
{"text":"Quick service, great prices, and amazing food. We had the granola, a side of bacon, and the bacon omelette with sourdough toast. It was all well-portioned, hearty, and flavorful."}
{"text":"Not kid friendly food.  Potatoes are not good.  Pastries looked tasty."}
{"text":"Ordering at the counter is quick, friendly, and efficient. Was recommended the maple latte and had the short stack of buttermilk pancakes as well as the marigold breakfast sandwich.   All three items arrived at my table together. The pancakes were like any buttermilk pancakes, though were not served hot off the griddle, barely melted the orange butter pat provided. Sandwich has a spread which is strong on the parsley if that is your liking. Ok breakfast sandwich though I'd prefer next time without the spread.   Table service is fast and pre-bussers are swift!  Most Memorable item was the maple latte. Hint of maple and not overly done on the sweetness factor.   Would definitely come back for the latte."}
{"text":"I was looking for something healthy and tasty. I heard Marigold was pretty good at providing such food. So I decided to give it a go. Luckily I work within about a 2 minute walk so it would also make for a decently quick lunch.  I went at about 10:45, between their breakfast and lunch. I ordered the Chile-Braised Chicken Sandwich off of their lunch menu. They couldn't actually start making the sandwich until 11, as that's when their lunch starts (breakfast ends at 10:30). Not a problem though. I sat down and read a few articles in the Isthmus and my food was there at about 11:15.   As far as the food goes, it was pretty good. Definitely not outrageously spectacular as I feel some reviews make it out to be, but pretty tasty and definitely filling. Also, very fresh. The rustic roll that made up the bread component of my Chile-Braised Chicken sandwich had a nice and chewy crust and a soft inside. The chicken had a flavorful marinade that was complimented by the chipotle lime dressing and chihuahua cheese. I wouldn't describe the sandwich as spicy, but it had a nice flavor with a kick.   As for the staff, I've definitely met friendlier people, but it wasn't a bad experience. I can only imagine what goes down in a restaurant on some days and I'm sure these people put up with a lot. If a staff person/waiter isn't always smiling, I'm not going to say the service was bad. Obviously the service is pretty decent as the reviews are generally great and the place is pretty busy.   If your in the downtown area and are looking for a quick sit-down lunch, I'd definitely recommend giving the Marigold Kitchen a try."}
{"text":"The staff was lovely from the moment we walked in.  Their system is you wait in line and order your food and then you are seated.  You don't think it will work, but it does.  We were greeted almost immediately checking how many people were in our party.  The food was fantastic.  All three of us were very happy.  Very flavorful and FRESH.  I highly recommend."}
{"text":"You know a place is good when you see a long line. We came here for breakfast and the place  was bussing with people and movement.  We sat ourselves on some stools by the counter. I felt like a waitress as I took my family's orders on a old receipt and then waited my turn in line My family moved from the stools to a table and then the staff moved us to a four person table. So yeah, the seating arrangement isn't the best but it's fine.  Our order was out pretty quick. I brought some delicious donuts to  the table for us to munchon. The menu itself is a bit pricey but you do get a lot of food. .I didn't realize they had a kids menu until too late. The broccoli and shroom omelet ($13) for my daughter was too much to eat. My veggie daughter got a short stack of really sweet buckwheat pancakes. Too sweet for her to finish. They had this almond butter that was really sugary.   The hubs had the eggs and sausage. it was the cheapest on the menu at $8.00. The sausages were homemade and delicious. I had the duck confeit hash. They had me at duck!  The potatoes were farmhouse potatoes with some crisp and the duck confeit added a hint of sweetness. It came with eggs. All of our entrees came with a salad on the side of the plate. Not what I am used to for breakfast but good. So pricewise for a family fairly pricey. But a good place to come every once in a while or while on vacation"}
{"text":"Ahh, yes, brunch on a Sunday after a long evening out ...  This establishment has been on my list of places to go for a while, but the logistics of it just never worked out (I lived on the far west side and this is downtown), so when I had the chance to make it down here I lept on it! The food was quite good. I got the breakfast sandwich and my companions got the scramber. I would have to say that the sandwich was pretty amazing and I enjoyed every delicious bite! The scrambler, however, left something to be desired in my opinion ... I don't know what it was, but I just didn't really like it that much. We rounded out brunch with their French Toast which was covered in berries and cream! YUMMY! I would have to say that it was the highlight of the stop. :)  The service was acceptable. You get in line and order at the counter and then just take a seat with your number, so all the server did was bring your food and keep you watered.  I would definitely come again to brunch and recommend it as a stop if you are ever in Madison!"}
{"text":"Really great, fresh and creative food choices. Friendly staff and hip and comfortable atmosphere."}
{"text":"Excellent food good quality loved the switchel, the set up is unique but works. Very unique meals, love the farm to table freshness that is hard to find. Great friendly service"}
{"text":"I consider myself to be a connoisseur of grilled cheese and the smoked turkey grilled cheese at Marigold Kitchen knocked my proverbial socks off (even though I was wearing flip flops)!  A delicious, yet unexpected combo of smoked turkey, Havarti cheese, and fig jam (WOW) combined to make a super tasty sandwich (I removed the Dijon mustard).  I think that the fig jam made it!  Despite my best efforts, I grabbed a chocolate chip cookie to-go...also delicious!  As far as atmosphere, they have a nice seating area outside (when weather permits) and the inside was nice and boisterous.  Really liked the employees - nice...and quick!  If I lived in Madison, Marigold Kitchen would be on my regular lunch rotation."}
{"text":"Great place! Fab food! Their brunch drinks are great! A must visit for anyone visiting Madison!!! Go early"}
{"text":"Possibly the best breakfast/brunch spot in town. It gets my vote anyhow. I think my only criticism is that it's not the coziest place in the world.  A little loud, busy and sterile.  But some people are into that aesthetic."}
{"text":"I love this hidden jem. Their salad is so far the best in the town. It's got the visual appealing, right volume, right amount of dressing, and healthy good. I have yet to try their breakfast menu, but I'll definitely have it soon. The cafe interior decor is minimal, yet clean and stylish - type of a place hard to find in Madison. One negative was their Bloody Marry that accompanied my salad. I get the \"home-made\" recipe, but it just didn't taste as good as I hoped. The fresh-squeezed lemonade, on the other hand, is always excellent and refreshing.  Update - I just had another fab lunch here with my friend today. While I stuck with my regular order of Marigold salad, my friend opted for the beefy 1/2 lbs burger. I had a little portion of the gigantic burger. It was super delicious. I once again fell in love with this place. You can tell that they care about the ingredients, and it shows on everything they create in the kitchen."}
{"text":"In love with this place. For openers, coffee is great and you serve yourself so you never have to wait on that much needed pick me up refill after a night on the town. I always get the duck confit hash. Heaven on a plate. The French toast and pancakes also pack a sweet little punch. The staff is nice and efficient enough to keep that ever growing line moving. No downsides but expect to have your space unintentionally invaded as the place is smaller than the hungry crowds. If you don't like eating here, you should get your attitude and tastebuds a talking to."}
{"text":"Love this place! Next time we're back in Madison, Marigold Kitchen will be on our must-stop list for brunch. We had two of the specials. The eggs were fluffy and creamy and cooked perfectly with pancetta, ricotta, herbs and Parmesan.  The granola pancakes were amazing with honey butter and berries. The menu is full of unique, delicious options - hard to decide!"}
{"text":"Marigold Kitchen has had a line out the door every day that we've been here visiting Madison, Wi. However, early Tuesday morning we found it comfortably busy with plenty of seating. You order at the counter and then have a seat with your table number. The service was excellent and the menu very diverse...it was hard to choose my breakfast. A great vibe. Worth the wait for slower crowd during the week but if you're here on the weekend only then take the time to get in line."}
{"text":"I've been to this place at least four times during the eight weeks I've been in Madison. The food is FANTASTIC, and the portion sizes are really generous, I really do feel like the value is worth it. You do order at the counter, which can be annoying and cumbersome if you want to order another thing, you have to get on the line again. Sometimes there won't be a line but sometimes there will be a really long line, so that's the only con. The food and the vibe are so, so so great. Top 5 brunch places in the world."}
{"text":"We wandered in early on a Saturday with no idea how this place worked, so I waited in line to ask and understood that  you order, tell someone (no idea who) how many are in your party , and then you wait.     Meanwhile my husband sat himself at the counter.  This was the wrong way to be seated,  but he wasn't moving.  I went to get his order, told a random person there were two of us, then went back to place the order, completely misunderstood my total bill, apologized, paid, and got a number.  Then I got coffee, which I REALLY needed that morning.     The food was delivered to us more quickly than I expected, and my omelette was excellent.   We ate and got out in record time because you just don't want to linger here.  It feels cramped.     Also note that it is not a cheap breakfast.  A side of bacon was $9.  It was very good bacon....but it was $9."}
{"text":"One of my favorite stops for a sandwich and soup. It is usually very busy but I've always been able to get a seat and enjoy a variety of sandwiches and soups. It is a delight."}
{"text":"Love their salads and sandwiches for lunch!"}
{"text":"Went for brunch.  I should have trusted my instincts and walked out upon seeing the price for biscuits and gravy = $12.  Instead,  we stayed and had a good--though seriously overpriced and undersized--meal.  My french toast was $10.  Tasty, to be sure, great fluffy texture, cooked perfectly, with several nice sauces poured over the little pile.  And I might've been ok with the price if only there were more on the plate.  But only three triangles of french toast?  Where was the fourth?  (On someone else's plate, I had to assume.)    What sense does it make to deprive me of that half-slice of French toast?  Surely not pricing sense, as it couldn't cost much of anything.  The berries on the plate were ripe and plump.  But there were a total of two black berries and two raspberries.  For color, I guess.  Can't praise the quality of the link sausages.  A side of three sausages were an extra $3.  They weren't bad.  They were just small, with the most pedestrian flavor, no smoke, no spice, no herbs.  Cooked.  That's all one could really say about them.  So at $13 my plate left me pretty hungry and very sad.  I perfectly expect to pay prices like that for farm to table restaurant food.  But don't let me walk away sad."}
{"text":"Mozart in the kitchen, Salieri in the front of house  A visit to Marigold Kitchen is both a transcendent and vexing proposition.    REGARDING THE KITCHEN:  For me, Marigold slings the best breakfast food in Madison, bar none.  After 200+ reviews of this establishment, I know I'm not going to break any new ground, but every time I visit, they nail both the composition and the execution of the dish.  The ingredients are right from the farm fresh, the flavors balanced and the plating divine.  With every bite I take, I hear the voice of God.  Displace one item from the plate and there would be diminishment - add one item to the plate and the structure would fail.   It's rainbows, unicorns and a heaping dose of fairy dust.  I love the elegant duck confit hash, the rustic scramblers, the hearty French toast, the exquisite potatoes...I LOVE ALL THEIR FOOD!!!   REGARDING THE FRONT OF HOUSE:  ARRRRRRRRRGGGGH [shaking fist at the heavens, Mozart's Requiem roaring the background...]  Marigold Kitchen, WHY must you vex me so???  You ply me with food prepared by angels, then mock me by serving it in your miniscule dining room where I unable to partake in a casual conversation over the dull roar of the other patrons.  Why do you force my to squeeze through a maze of densely packed tables every time I need to refill my coffee or grab a napkin when another diner has bumped into my table in their haste to grab an open table, knocking over said beverage.  Why is it that other prospective diners, perching like vultures in the waiting area, eye me like a wounded wildebeest, wondering when I am going give up my table.    I'm seriously considering starting a Kickstarter campaign so these guys can get a bigger dining room - who's with me?"}
{"text":"Amazing service, fantastic bread, and perfect omelette.  We had 18 people show up on a Sunday morning and somehow despite the huge popularity of his tiny place they seated us together and promptly and cheerfully served us fresh and wArm delicious food! Don't skip the carbs you have to try the bread! Really good coffee, too."}
{"text":"Marigold is as good as it gets in Madison.  They have been Madison's best lunch spot since they opened about 15 years ago.  Management is superior here and they know how to pick staff.  Food is spectacular and they are continually tweaking the menu and clearly put a lot of thought into daily specials.  I can rely on Marigold Kitchen for a business meeting, or lunch with friends, and I know it will be consistently excellent.  The only cons to Marigold are how popular it is, which can lead to a bit of a wait in line.  Staff does a great job of making sure people don't walk in and stake a claim to a table before they actually order food, but occasionally you may have to wait for a table.  Worth it!"}
{"text":"Ordered a tofu scramble to go - received 1/2 cup of tomato based slop with some corn, beans and tofu. Overpriced and not impressed. However, I have heard the breakfast sandwich to go is good."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast on a recent visit to Madison.  Split the french toast and artichoke omelet with a friend.  Both were amazing.  They even let me bring my new puppy (we had to sit outside).  Only issue was that the sun was blazing and they didn't have any umbrellas for outdoor seating.  We waited until there was a bit of shade behind a tiny, skinny tree and sat down.  Would have been much better with an umbrella, but the food was great."}
{"text":"I headed to Marigold on a nice weekend morning and was pleasantly surprised. This restaurant is small, but comfy, and they have delicious food. I also like how you order and find a seat versus having a server, much more convenient. My friends and I sat at a window table and absolutely loved sun-soaking while enjoying breakfast. Would recommend!"}
{"text":"duck confit hash = so amazing that i choked on it from greedy inhaling"}
{"text":"As an out-of-towner who is a self proclaimed breakfast snob, Marigold Kitchen is legit.  You can tell a place is popular when every table is taken within 15 minutes of opening. Somehow even while being very busy, we were able to move through the order-at-the-counter line, find seats, and get our food within about 20 minutes. Pretty amazing.   All waitstaff were courteous and friendly. We talked with the staffer working the coffee station for recommendations and were very pleased with her recommendations. Thanks for your patience while we peppered you with questions.   The duck confit hash is not to be missed. The sweet and smokey flavors were balanced nicely with the pairing of the mixed green salad. I only wish I could eat it every week. The blueberry pancakes were a little sweet for me, but that didn't stop my partner from eating the entire shortstack.   Would certainly return next time we are in town. Thanks for doing breakfast right!"}
{"text":"There are many, many places to get breakfast at all times in Madison. Marigold is at the top of the list. Our group of 3 had brioche french toast, oyster/asparagus frittata and sweet potato/kale/spinach two egg hash.  We would get them all again, beautifully prepared on a very busy day,  the veggies are fresh, the eggs right off the farm. And, they make a nice Mimosa."}
{"text":"Lived here for 5 years, ate out 700 times (ok I don't really know how many times), but only went here 3 times or so due to desire of variety for lunch.  This place is kind of ehhh for me due to it's high prices and smarmy quality.  Dammit! Why do you have to be so warm and cozy and yummy and perfect, yadda yadda.  Maybe I just want that certain level of imperfection when I dine out, but something about this place is kind of like nails on a chalkboard to my soul.  They DO have tasty food.  They DO have a decent atmosphere.    Cons: wait time during weekday lunch can be unbearable, high prices, can be very warm inside and hard to find a seat"}
{"text":"Great breakfast...friendly service, and the coffee was smooth and delish.  Very nice place."}
{"text":"Really good food but a bit pricey. But what do you expect for downtown."}
{"text":"I was out here for a week and visited this place on four different occasions during my stay. Both the food and coffee was amazing. The maple latte in particular was my favorite. (My cup collection in the hotel room as proof)"}
{"text":"WORTH THE WAIT!!!!  At Marigold, you order at the counter, receive a number and go find a seat. Despite the long line, food was timely and really fresh & delicious. My boyfriend was very happy with the food, talking about how much better it was than brunch places in our neighborhood in NYC. I'll post pictures of our breakfasts.  P.S. THE POTATOES ARE BANGIN!"}
{"text":"Great food! Loved the ordering style because it made for a super fast table turnaround. The bacon is out of this world!"}
{"text":"Had the spinach quiche and field greens.  Good tasting, but the quiche was a bit overdone.  I would definitely return, however, as the other menu items looked intriguing as well."}
{"text":"THIS JUST IN: You can get a short stack! WHAAAAAAAA? I'm constantly overwhelmed by the sweet their pancakes punch, but get this, you can get a wee stack of two for a few buck when typically the larger portion runs $10. SOLD! Does it say this on the menu somewhere? It's possible. But you're reading Yelp, and now you know, so you don't need to eye over the menu closely. Simply peep the chalkboard, decide that the special pancakes are the best being offered, then grab a short stack!"}
{"text":"Marigold takes brunch to a different level.   It's the same old breakfast items you enjoy, but with a fresh twist.  They can make salads for breakfast en Vogue.   Try it out."}
{"text":"A solid 4 1/2 stars!  Consistently a winner in delivering great food in an inviting and clean atmosphere.  I usually go early as to avoid the lines and to  be seated immediately.....really busy during farmers market Saturdays.  Outside dining (I believe) is still available depending on weather.  On most occasions, my dining partner and I order the scrambler and pancake specials of the day along with our coffee.  We share and get the ideal sweet and savory portions for our meal.  The coffee is always hot and fresh.  If you're looking for a varied menu, tasty bakery items and a great atmosphere, you can't go wrong, Marigold Kitchen is awesome!"}
{"text":"Let me begin this by saying the food here is great. Really, really great. If you want a delicious breakfast, go to Marigold Kitchen.  However, I can't give them five stars - or even four - because the staff are just so incredibly rude. I have never been treated like anything other than a nuisance when placing my order. I used to bring out-of-town guests here but no more. It's simply too embarrassing to have them treated like crap for ordering a Diet Coke.   They also really need to do something about their seating policies. They are very, VERY uptight about the proper way to go about seating yourself, yet they don't just have a hostess to seat people. I don't understand it."}
{"text":"Every detail is considered - making breakfast special isn't easy in my book but they delivered."}
{"text":"Excellent French toast and quiche.  A down to earth, friendly, brunch and breakfast.  Recommended to us at the Hilton.  Good choice with a well deserved excellent reputation."}
{"text":"Kind of like a deli, but it's not super cheap.  Good if you're a on the square and in a hurry I suppose. For a leisurely breakfast, I'd suggest you look elsewhere.   The business model is that of a diner, minus the service and normal amount of space  (sounds like a winner, huh?). You come in, grab a piece of heavyweight, printed paper that claims to be a menu, and then you order. (Don't blink, the line moves fast.) Unlike a diner, the Marigold Kitchen isn't content to serve you french toast. No, they have to add nuts, 3 types of berries, some organic cheese and whatever. All the food  is like this. You may not get any service, but your plate looks good before you eat it. Food snob?--you'll love this.  Ambiance:  well it has the typical too trendy look to it. Every wall is painted some color that clashes with another. The seats and stools are uncomfortable, but look nice. And oh, don't miss the men's bathroom, it's the girliest thing I've ever seen.  ...Well, except for the double caged light fixture that looks like it belongs on a ship.   The staff:  clearly a look to them.  Seems like stereotypical co-op college lesbians.  Short hair, attitude, matching t-shirts, probably pit hair. If you have a problem with sexuality, that's your issue, not mine. I make note of it  because I don't care for stores where everyone looks the same. Y'know like TGIF's with its flair buttons? Hate that. Well, this is the same deal, but just another costume  Will you like the food?  Let's get serious. You don't go to this place for the food. Nonetheless, it gets a passing grade. I didn't throw up or anything."}
{"text":"I Love breakfast and Marigold is a great breakfast joint. Went here on a friend's suggestion and was not even disappointed in the slightest. One must recognize Marigold's setup before you come just so you don't get stressed for standing in line and ordering yourself.    We came on a Saturday mid-morning and the place was actually not a madhouse. Winning already. You walk in grab a menu and stand in line and order at the front. They give you a number and a few minutes later, boom food! The selection of goods Marigold hooks up is amazing.   We ordered a few items at Marigold. First up, the Marigold breakfast sandwich with potatoes as well as the house made bloody Mary and pancakes with orange whip butter.   The sandwich was so damn good. So satisfying on so many levels. It had a great cream cheese spread and an egg cooked perfectly with bacon. Simple yet scrumptious. The pancakes were also great and that orange marmalade butter! Woot Woot! The bloody Mary was really good. Not a ton of garnishes but a house made mix that was intense and packed with flavor! This is a must to get if you like bloodies!   Now for me, I probably had the best breakfast potatoes I ever had in my life! These things were the sleeper hit! I had no idea potatoes could be so decadent. They came out steaming hot and were crisp and had a perfect seasoning to them. Hands down I could get a plate of these alone and crush em!   Marigold I will be back again when I come to Madison. You are one solid breakfast joint in my book!"}
{"text":"Just stopped in to grab breakfast to go - had a hard time deciding, but ended up ordering the Marigold Breakfast Sandwich. It was delicious. Fresh ciabatta, fried egg, thick bacon, topped with tomato and some magical creamy cheesy sauce. Green onions really set the whole thing off.    Fast friendly service, tasty breakfast... Thanks Marigold!"}
{"text":"A great little place for brunch, but make sure to get here early or be prepared to wait for a table!  The food is really tasty, especially their omelets/scrambles. The potatoes are delicious and very flavorful. I haven't tried much else because I can't keep myself from ordering the scrambles! I recommend sharing if you get a scramble with brie in it, as they are VERY heavy and filling.  The ambiance makes me a bit anxious, which is the only reason I don't come here more often. If you're waiting for a table, you feel like you have to constantly watch people to see if they're leaving. You can order food even if there aren't tables available, in which case you might get your food and still be waiting for a table. That to me is not a pleasant experience. If you happen to get a table, others are watching you eat, hoping to snag your table the minute you finish eating. This does not make for the nicest atmosphere. I ordered take-out to avoid this once, but the food was not near as good as it is for dine-in so I wouldn't do that again. The bottom line is to get here as early as you can.  I wish they wouldn't take orders until a table was opening up, because then I'd happily give Marigold 4 or even 5 stars. The food is certainly some of the best in Madison, but it's hard to ignore the ambiance."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Marigold and I will definitely be going back!  It is situated right off of the Capitol and easy to find, not being from Madison myself I found it with some simple directions from a friend. I walked in and was very excited to try what was on the menu since where I live most of these options would not be available.  Browsing the menu I saw a disclaimer stating the use of fresh and locally grown items.  I love this!   You order and pay at the counter, fill your own coffee cup, and seat yourself.  The place was about half full so I picked one of the stools facing out the window to people watch while I ate.  Shortly after my food arrived, three perfectly cooked pancakes with butter and sliced strawberries (which I was not expecting), and two huge sausage links.  Everything tasted great and the coffee was hot.   This is definitely a popular place!  People were in and out for take out orders, and the line was 7 or 8 people long a couple of times while I was there, which made getting another coffee a slight challenge but not impossible.   Overall, the experience was a great one!  Staff is very nice and helpful, the atmosphere is relaxed with other patrons enjoying their breakfast and conversation, and the food is tasty.  I will for sure being going here again when I am back in town."}
{"text":"It's 2:00 on a Friday afternoon. We are the only customers. We've been waiting for our food for 25 minutes. It better be good when it finally gets here."}
{"text":"The food here is so so good. I had a maple latte and the chili poached eggs. My mouth is watering just thinking about them. On a previous visit my husband ordered the weekend special which was some kind of ribs and grits and was also to die for. The only thing I don't like about this place is the awkward ordering/seating system. You order at the counter and then awkwardly wait around for someone to leave and then seat yourself. It ends up being really irritating when people who arrived after you are quick on their feet and steal a table right out from under you. Not my favorite, but I'll suffer through it just to eat their chili poached eggs again."}
{"text":"A 5 star breakfast place in a city riddled with average morning dining. Ive never had a problem getting a table on the weekdays. Service is fast and courteous. The breakfast sandwich was very good but with a tad too much mayo. The potatoes are the real star of the show though and I wouldnt never pass them up while there. The jam on the table is also stellar and a nice touch.  I would bring locals and family alike here!"}
{"text":"My bf and I went here for Sunday brunch after a hockey and concert-filled weekend in Madison. Apparently the entire city decided to go here for brunch as well, as it appears to have that \"trendy place for brunch\" feel to it .  I appreciate that you wait in line, order your food, and then are seated by the wait staff.    My boyfriend was a little taken aback by his view from our table, as he unfortunately was seated facing the bathrooms, which was an incessant flow of Marigold patrons.  To add fuel to the fire, seating is tight and we may have just been seated right on top of the couple of savant schmucks seated right next to us who were either trying to 1.) vehemently impress us (or each other) with their vast knowledge or 2.) were never educated in respecting and acknowledging one's surroundings.  Nonetheless, moving on to the food, we each ordered our individual adult brunch platters, mine a delicious egg white marigold omelet, although the omelet was well-prepared, the potatoes leave something to be desired.  Since I also had my sinister sweet tooth nagging at me all morning I ordered a child's order of French toast as a side.  I was really disappointed when one of the wait staff stopped by our table to let us know that they don't allow adults to order from the children's menu.  We however thought it would be okay since we had each ordered our own dish--needless to say, this was the icing on the cake, the bow on present, and the kick to the stomach when you're already down.  So aside from the potty-view, idiot-savants, and child's French toast tidbit, I'd say that this place is okay for my ONE and ONLY time there.  Better luck for the next guy!"}
{"text":"This is another restaurant where I honestly don't understand the hype that's built up around it.   I've eaten here twice now, and both times have been extremely underwhelming. As always, I'm dealing with a nut allergy, and it really shouldn't be hard to find food that I can eat. The staff, and cooks (!), have no real knowledge of the ingredients that they use and what goes into what dish.   The first time I ordered French toast. That should be a nice safe dish. Nope. Has some kind of almond something. They then had to make the toast step by step to make sure they weren't missing some somewhere else. The food was ok, but I mean, it's French toast. I could have gotten the same thing from Dennys and not notice the difference.   Today I ordered an open face tuna melt. I don't know about anyone else, but when you add the word \"melt\" to a sandwich I kind of start assuming it's going to be hot. You know, to melt the cheese. You'd be mistaken in this scenario because it was cold tuna on cold bread with a cold greasy not fully melted cheese square. It's a personal preference, but the pickle slices on it was a sweet pickle and that's always kind of horrifying for me. The tuna, like the French toast, could have been from anywhere and honestly tasted like the kind you'd get from Subway. It's served with an arugula salad with a champagne vinaigrette, which could be described as \"a bitter oily mass of sadness\".   My husband ordered the Chili Roasted Chicken sandwich, which he enjoyed. He also got their puree of mushroom soup, which neither of us enjoyed. For some unexplainable reason, it had a tomato base. It was brownish red, and didn't have even a hint of mushroom flavor. It was also served lukewarm, which didn't help endear it to us.   I can't recommend eating here. Our bill for 2 sandwiches and a cup of soup was $27. Considering the taste and experience, it's very much not worth it."}
{"text":"CHOAS!!!! Complete and total CHOAS.  People crashing into each other, food falling on the floor, drinks spilled constantly. The food was good but the place was HORRIBLY managed or better yet completely UNMANAGED. No thanks not again. Tried the zucchini pancakes and they were good experience was awful."}
{"text":"Best french toast I've ever had.  Expect a little bit of a wait but well worth it."}
{"text":"Every single time I come to Madison, WI I cannot wait to get here on Saturday morning! The have literally some of the yummiest breakfast I've ever had, EVER!!   TRY a Scone!!  You cannot go wrong with their scones. wonderful combos such as blackberry peach...mmmmm....  Their breakfast sandwich is the BEST breakfast sandwich I've ever had. I have the hardest time NOT ordering it when I'm there, thank you to my brother-in-law for getting me addicted to it. ;)  My in-laws are regulars here as they always find the staff super friendly, inviting, helpful & really what you'd expect for a small restaurant near the square...can we say quality?!  As long as this place stands I will be there every trip I take to Madison."}
{"text":"Amazing food, great coffee, and inviting atmosphere. A must for anyone visiting Madison."}
{"text":"The food was excellent. We walked in here randomly but was not disappointed.  Ordered the scrambler and a ham and parsley omelette.  Both were very good but were too close in taste.  Wish I would have tried something different."}
{"text":"My husband would give this restaurant 6 stars if he could :)  We enjoyed the breakfast and lunch we had here very much and highly recommend it!  Cool vibe too."}
{"text":"Easily in my top 5 restaurants in Madison. Ideal little pocket cafe has fresh breakfast and lunch options that keep me coming back almost weekly. I cannot get enough of their signature Marigold Salad (throw in Salmon, trust me) and I often struggle ordering between that and their daily specials. Their soups are really the star. Wholesome and delicious and can be split into half and half options so you can try everything."}
{"text":"Marigold Kitchen is definitely a great brunch option in downtown Madison! I went here with a friend on a Saturday morning after the Dane County Farmers Market. If I had any doubt of whether Marigold would be good, the full tables and line almost to the door answered that question for me. Despite being so busy, by the time we had placed our order, a table opened up and we could sit down right away.  We treated ourselves to mimosas, which were great (!) and the perfect thing to sip on while we waited for our food. The scrambler of the day was delicious (although I can't remember exactly what was in it). I will gladly return to Marigold Kitchen!"}
{"text":"The food was average but way overpriced, this is probably because this restaurant is very close to the Capitol and in the high rent area of town.  Bacon was soggy and portions were small.  Prices were HIGH, $30 for two people for a basic two egg breakfast with coffee!  I promise we won't be heading back there anytime soon!  Unfortunately, our favorite spot was closed because it was Monday.  Would not recommend!"}
{"text":"Came in with a friend for some breakfast. You order at the counter, find a table and they bring you the food. I ordered the honey buckwheat pancakes, an egg and bacon. The pancakes were very dry. Maple syrup was good and the pancakes had bananas cooked in them. The taste was good, just sooo dry!  My friend had the duck confit hash. Big chunks of potato and duck. He said it was ok. Nice portions, but somewhat disappointed."}
{"text":"Great place, great location, friendly staff, fantastic food. One big complaint: too noisy. WAY too noisy.   Favorite dish: the quiche, but if you want it for lunch,  get there early as it sells out quick if there is any left from breakfast."}
{"text":"OMG I love this place, best breakfast place I've been to in Madison so far. The duck confit was amazing. They are super busy but the wait was totally worth it.  Service was fast and friendly. I went when it was still a little warm outside when they had outdoor seating and the waitress still checked on us regularly. I will definitely go back.  =)"}
{"text":"Marigold's takes the cake for the most delicious poached eggs I've ever had.  Talk about a food memory, I was here for a conference weeks ago and I can still remember the chili poached eggs with prosciutto and manchego cheese.  And with coffee and a tip, it was still less than $12.  Fan-tas-tic.  The place is sunny and clean, the staff is friendly, and everyone at my table was blown away by the quality of their food.  I was particularly jealous of my friend's French toast, which was piled high with berries and looked truly excellent.  Definitely worth a stop-in for brunch!"}
{"text":"I've been to Marigold Kitchen a couple of times. The place could get busy sometimes, but fortunately we always managed to get seats. You have to order food from the counter and wait to be seated after. That being said, seating could get messy sometimes when people just come in and didn't want to stay in line to get seated. Also, if you order drinks, make sure to tell them NOT to make it before u get seated or you will end up standing around holding your drink.  I tried the scrambler and two eggs (with 4 fat strips of bacon with only $2 more). The egg dishes was ok - but they were served with Marigold's potatoes - which was the real gold!! It's seasoned beautifully (I still can't figure out what's on it) and really I don't mind ordering anything from this place that comes with the potatoes. The portion was BIG; I always have to box a portion of my food.    The last time I was here, I wanted to try the Duck Hash confit. Unfortunately, it doesn't come with Marigold's potatoes. I did ask the employee about the potatoes, but she didn't seem too friendly about it :("}
{"text":"Lavender latte is beautiful. Duck confit hash is sweeter than expected, pancake is very nice!"}
{"text":"Really good place by the capital. Espresso coffees, fresh made egg dishes and pancakes, great service (but note it's an order and sit place). Really liked the duck con fit potatoes with poached eggs and mixed green salad - but have to admit that I was hoping for more \"duck\". My wife had the egg scramble with red potatoes - the eggs were very good and reminded me of chilaquiles with Mexican queso on top. That was the best I think. My son then ordered the little pancakes which he liked.   I ordered a nice iced coffee which was nice and refreshing. We also sat outside since it was a nice day by the capital. Will come again for sure and try more."}
{"text":"My new favorite and on my list of restaurants to frequent!  The food is great and at a good price and the customer service can't be beat!"}
{"text":"The food is always fresh and flavorful here! The menu is concise, which makes your wait time in line for the counter shorter. And all of their items are super colorful and have interlocking flavors that get nailed on the head. The atmosphere is classic and cozy warm which makes you want to stay a while. but they try to flip tables quick because they have lots of customers around peak times.My only complaint is how long it takes to make the food since you do order at the counter. Definitely a favorite lunch stop during summer months!"}
{"text":"We were starving when we had arrived at Marigold Kitchen, which came at a recommendation from our friend who lives in Madison for breakfast. Our timing was good as after we ordered the line was out the door even with the 100+ degree weather.  I dig the concept of ordering your food then grabbing a table.   When I got to the cash register I ordered a staple - eggs, potatoes and bacon with a side pancake. Eggs and bacon were good though the potatoes were amazing. They were scalloped, salted and crispy on the edges. The pancake was fluffy and big with some strawberries and butter and syrup -not bad for an extra $2.  I would go back if I were to visit Madison again though my only gripe was that my food was warm and the others were cold, which was surprising given that the food is made and served to order."}
{"text":"Great options for breakfast and feasibly priced. Parking is tricky in downtown Madison. So many strange rules and signs make no sense. They kind of contradict each other. When in doubt just park in one of the garages.  This place open early and probably the best to go because there are not many tables.  You order at the counter and your food arrives to your table based upon a number assigned.  The fresh squeeze OJ is pretty good except it would be nice if the squeeze it in front of you. It will make harder but a nice touch."}
{"text":"This place is always a go to for breakfast or brunch. I try to go during the week to avoid the impossible crowds that come with the weekends but sometimes you have those needs that only Marigolds can fix.   I am going to be 100% honest I have never even looked at the menu. I always see their daily scrambler special and I don't have to look any further. Their scramblers have fresh ingredients so they vary with the seasons. You get their delicious breakfast potatoes (add a bit of siracha and you will die and go to heaven) and a side of toast.   A couple notes about this place is that it's an order at the front get your own coffee and water kind of place. Personally I love this aspect and makes it easy to eat with friends and in larger groups. But if you are trying to get served you might want to try The Great Dane across the street. Also don't fret if there doesn't seem to be a seat open when you walk in. People come in eat and leave so odds are by the time you get through ordering something will open up and most certainly something will by the time your food is ready.   Also disclaimer the only reason it's not a 5 star is because my most recent experience there the plating was just sloppy and a bit smaller portions than usual. I might be holding them up to too high of standards but when I come here I know that I can expect the best."}
{"text":"Oh Marigold how I love your pancakes and your breakfast sandwich and your coffee... And well, everything you create.  I've been to Marigold Kitchen a couple of times and I have never been disappointed. It really is one of my favorite places to eat breakfast/ brunch at.   If you go on the weekend it may be busy with lots of people and don't worry if there is a line it is so worth it and it usually goes pretty fast.   You will have to order at the register before sitting down which is different at first but some how the timing is always perfect on the open table to ordering ratio.   The food is amazing! They have the best pancakes and usually have some sort of pancake concoction on special. (It's always delicious get it!!)  I also recommend the best breakfast sandwich in town ( egg, tomato, bacon, cream cheese, and so much more)  I personally go with someone and split the sandwich and the pancakes so my tastebuds get the best of both worlds. Also you can't forget the homemade American fries. They are also delicious!  If you order any coffee or drink they are made with great detail and the presentation are always fun to see.   I highly recommend Marigold Kitchen. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu!"}
{"text":"Nice little place just off of the capital square.  High quality ingredients.  Had the '\"Cured salami, ham, and provolone  with spicy olive relish, romaine and aioli on ciabatta  8.99  \"  Good value for the money.  Service was quick and the staff friendly."}
{"text":"The Marigold has the best breakfast anywhere--period.  The food here puts Milwaukee's \"Blue's Egg\" to shame so badly that I would drive to Madison and back just because Marigold is that much better.    The pancakes with the lemon ricotta?  Um, yes, please!  They are goodness in flapjack form!    The scrambles are always fresh, inventive, and perfectly cooked.  Marigold does not overcook their eggs.  This is cause for great joy!  The omelets are fantastic, too.  My favorite is the Chorizo sausage, roasted sweet corn relish, and sharp cheddar (I skip the cilantro)...which simply sings.  I generally avoid places where you have to walk up, order, then fight for a table--but the food here is *SO* good that I make an exception.  Have breakfast or brunch at the Marigold.  If you go on a weekend, be prepared to wait.  If you can't deal with the wait, go on a weekday or during a tsunami or something.  There are people standing around waiting because the food is incredibly delectable."}
{"text":"Excellent quality food, large portions. Very tasty, I had the duck confit and it was amazing. They have Outside seating during the summer to enjoy beautiful weather."}
{"text":"I had the French toast and it was delicious, possibly the best I've ever had. My boyfriend thoroughly enjoyed his scrambled eggs special. Took off a star simply because the coffee wasnt very good but this is a lovely place with great food. Would def recommend!"}
{"text":"casual atmosphere, good prices, and fresh ingredients in the hands of able cooks. Its enjoyable every time i've been there."}
{"text":"A very relaxing place on weekdays. Loved the iced mint latte, which had a lot of peppermint leaves within the drink, and the coffee also smelled really good!"}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast/brunch place in the Midwest. The ambience is perfect with plenty of light and a comfortable variety of seating options. The french toast is perfect and the breakfast sandwich is incredible."}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast while visiting Madison. Very good food and a great atmosphere. I had a scrambler and hot chocolate. The food was very nice arriving with a side of potatoes and toast. The scrambler was a little bit runny but very good with ham, tomatoes, spinach, poblano peppers and cheddar cheese. The hot chocolate was unexpectedly excellent. I'd definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"This place is becoming one of my favorite breakfast/brunch spots in Madison! Rather than a 'sit down first and order from your waiter'-type of place, you immediately look at the menu when you walk in, decide what you want, and place your order with the cashier at the counter. They give you a number, and another worker either brings you to a table or you wait off to the side (where they have chairs along the wall) until someone directs you to an empty table. From there, you can serve yourself some water, and you wait until your food is delivered to you!  The first time I visited, my mom and I split a sweet entree and a savory entree. We had the egg scrambler on special which came with breakfast potatoes and toast, as well as the french toast. The scrambler was good, the potatoes were great, and that french toast was the absolute BEST! It's got this almond-flavored cream on top of it with fresh berries, and it is oh so heavenly. Would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a sweet meal!  This morning, we were in luck that the line was only a couple people long considering it was about 1130 on a Sunday morning. We placed our order within a few minutes and were placed immediately at a table, and it didn't take too long for our food to arrive. My friend had the Marigold Breakfast Sandwich and loved it!! She said the best part was the creamy spread on it -- which we later realized was the boursin cheese (which is very similar to cream cheese). I tried the Roasted Sweet Potato, Kale, and Basil Walnut Pesto Hash and my oh my that was deeeeeelicious!! I might be biased since sweet potatoes are my absolute favorite, but it was so good. There were plenty of roasted sweet potatoes in the mix, along with some baby reds, carrots, onions, and pesto. I chose to have the hash with poached eggs, which were perfectly runny on the inside. I love how the egg yolk kind of blends into everything in the hash -- it makes it that much better! On the side came a field mix with champagne vinaigrette -- the greens were a bit soaked in the dressing which became overpowering at times, but they were still decent. I was hoping that my plate would have had a bit more of the hash on it -- the portion size wasn't small by any means, but a little more would have been perfect.   Lastly, we decided to order a short stack of the Citrus Ricotta pancakes that were on special this weekend. We didn't know if we'd have to get back in like and forfeit our table in order to get another item, but luckily we asked one of the workers and she was able to ring up our order right away while we were still at our table! That worked out perfectly. The pancakes were insanely good -- super fluffy, with crystallized orange zest and what seemed like citrus-y butter on the top and maple syrup on the side. I would definitely get them again as a little side item to split with whoever else at the table!!  Overall, you can't go wrong with Marigold. This place might be turning into my go-to brunch spot!!"}
{"text":"Thanks to Yelp, we found this place for brunch on a beautiful Sunday in Madison. We arrived half an hour after they opened, and they were already packed.  Something to get used to was ordering from the counter before you can grab a seat---I can see this being chaotic in spite of an \"brunch etiquette\" sign posted inside.    The artichoke omelette I ordered was served generously with toast, house potatoes and mixed greens.  Next time, I will order the breakfast sandwich that looked scrumptious from across the table. It took all of me not to order from their pastry selection but my husband did grab a few of their cinnamon doughnuts.    Friendly service and decent coffee drinks made this an excellent choice."}
{"text":"ate here twice in one weekend... once for a catered dinner and once for sunday brunch.  unlike the masses, i preferred the former.  i could've eaten a whole plateful of the passed fig/cheese crostini apps.  the salad was perfectly dressed - slightly tart, completely delicious dressing.  i had one of the best catered vegi meals - mushrooms on top of polenta.  every bite was the perfect herbey blend without being over the top in salt or butter (as a lot of polenta dishes tend to be).   take 2...brunch.  absolutely loved the atmosphere and mini pots of tea (green tea was excellent), however i think the overall selection was mediocre.  i guess i was hoping for some more savory dishes outside of the egg family since i normally avoid them.  i settled for the scrambler which again was mediocre.  the rosemary bread that came with it was quite delicious though.  all in all, i would totally recommend this adorable spot - great location by the capitol and quick service."}
{"text":"This place is darling and seriously delicious. My boyfriend and I came on a weekend around 12ish. It was busy but there were a few tables open. I personally like the whole pay-at-the-counter thing. It's just easy. Coffee is self serve and AWESOME. Really strong, just the way I like it.   I'm giving this place 5 stars because the food was really top-notch. Such fresh, quality ingredients...you can truly taste the difference. I got the french toast and it blew my mind. My boyfriend got one of the omelettes and was in love as well. I stole one of his potatoes and it alone was pretty amazing. Plus it's really cute inside. :)  Will be coming back when I'm back in Madison!"}
{"text":"I'm from Houston, so by my standards, this place is TINY. Like, my bedroom is probably bigger than their dining area.   I went in on Pi Day 2015 for breakfast around 10am. The place was already super packed, with a line extending to the door. Unlike in Houston, you order your food and pay first, and then you have to wait for a table. Interesting concept, and one I've never seen before in Texas. We had to wait 15-20 minutes for the table, but the upside was that the food came out pretty soon after that.   I got the spinach and gouda quiche with the side of greens tossed in champagne vinaigrette. They only give you a slice of quiche, not a mini-quiche like most breakfast places, but it was a BIG slice and very tall. It was pretty good, I would order it again. While I did not sample the side of greens, my friends did, and they said the greens tasted weird. My friends liked their food too (ham sandwich and beef, eggs, and potatoes).  Overall a pretty good experience, albeit different from Texas restaurants."}
{"text":"Great breakfast... best I've had on the road in a long time.  I had the veggie quiche with field greens and it was awesome.  The crust was cooked to perfection... golden brown but not a hint of burnt.    Love the ambiance - it's like a coffee shop for breakfast."}
{"text":"I really have to get something off my chest. I love breakfast. But I also love sleeping in. So you can see I have a problem. But that's why there is brunch. Brunch solves the problems of hungry pillow huggers everywhere. So thank you, Brunch creator. Wherever you are. Whew, ok. Now, here's the review...  Marigold Kitchen was recommended by my sister who is a Madison-ite. We were perusing the Dane County Farmers Market during the summer and she suggested we meet up with some of her coworkers and have a quick bite. Marigold's was paaaaacked. The line was out the door. There's no wait-to-be-seated area, it's a order at the front (well, the side) and find a table if you can. The waiters are definitely helpful in scouting out a spot, but it can be chaotic if you're unprepared. Luckily, we found a nice spot outside on their tiny little sidewalk patio.   I'm a slave to good French Toast, so it wasn't even a question of what I would order. We also ordered a giant carafe of orange juice which was tasty, but nothing I've have better. For the French Toast bread they use awesome brioche. They had lightly drizzled sweet cream on top with a mixture of fresh summer berries that included strawberries, blueberries, and blackberries. Slivered almonds and a side of maple syrup completed the French Toast. It was...delectable. Perfectly crisp on the outside, but thoroughly cooked yet moist on the inside. The sweet cream and berries were perfect without the syrup. But I prefer not-so-sweet breakfast, errr...brunch items. My sister had the Duck Confit Hash which she raved about. I'm not a duck fan, so I opted out of trying. But I'll take her word for it. The French Toast was more than enough for me to 5* review this place."}
{"text":"Delicious food, with lots of vegetarian options for the not-do-meat-inclined of Wisconsin. All the food choices are thoughtfully constructed and interesting, which is unusual for a breakfast joint. It's a little on the pricier side for breakfast, but worth it for the quality. It's cute enough inside, but certainly doesn't have the in-your-face personality that some of the Madison breakfast spots go for in the interior design."}
{"text":"Best breakfast I've eaten in Madison by FAR. If you hear someone saying the food is not good they're lying or just don't know what good food is. I've eaten food from New York to California and I can say unequivocally Marigolds is one of the vey best breakfast spots I've ever eaten at. To give a frame of reference, if you have ever been to Chicago and eaten at Batter N Berries or Over Easy Cafe, Marigolds is on par."}
{"text":"I truly love this place.  The food is excellent and fresh.  A few things to keep in mind: 1) there is typically a line to order food, but moves pretty fast 2) it's a little noisy, but to be expected. 3). The dinning area is not that large and on sundays the staff keeps things flowing through the dinning area; otherwise it's seat yourself 4) if you have a child in a stroller, the stroller does not fit at all in Marigolds.  Typically, people leave strollers in the entrance way or outside.  5) Do not be frustrated when you see people finished eating and mingling at their table like no one else is waiting to sit nor do these people have the curiosity to move it along.  Car seats are okay, but seating is oriented to maximize space for tables not for a car seat necessarily. With all this in mind, try this place it's really great food.  Pricing is a little high and I wouldn't take my 6 kids, it's not oriented that way.  This place is a trendy spot with a friendly staff."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant.  You order at the register and they deliver to your table.  I loved the fresh flowers throughout the restaurant!  The potatoes were excellent.  Everything perfectly prepared. Portions were just right, although surprised that a side of toast was just one slice. Great coffee!"}
{"text":"Their wait in line, order and pay at the register, but then sit at a table system can be a little hectic during peak breakfast/brunch times.  That said, I still really enjoyed the food at this cute spot in downtown Madison."}
{"text":"Honestly, I just LOVE this place. I never get sick of the fresh flavors, strong coffee, and comfortable atmosphere. Whenever I go to eat with friends or family I try to stick by my rule of always going to new places, however I can't keep to that rule when it comes to Marigold!   When I came last weekend I got the roasted sweet potato, kale, and basil walnut pesto hash. I wish I could put that basil walnut pesto on top of everything I eat it was so delicious. My friends both got the chorizo breakfast burrito and though they couldn't finish it in one sitting, they were both very content with their decisions."}
{"text":"What a nice breakfast spot just off Capitol Sq to the SE. With bar and table seating, this spot gave off a high energy vibe.   I ordered the Chorizo omelet. It was $11 and contained chorizo sausage, roasted sweet corn relish, cilantro, and sharp cheddar cheese and like all the omelets came with potatoes and toast.   You order and pay first at the counter (menus by the register), take a number and have a seat, and a runner brings out your food to you. You get your drinks at the counter too whether you want OJ from the cooler or self-serve bottomless coffee. They also have your typical alcoholic brunch drinks.   The restaurant was about 1/3rd full and kitchen service was fast on a Thursday morning at about 8am. The staff at the register was really friendly and cheerful."}
{"text":"Oh wow!! Duck confit hash, need I explain more? Heirloom tomato bloody, yes please! Colectivo coffee!! Amazing service, free chai, and unlimited coffee refills! Can't wait to return and try more of the menu. All local and all delicious! Happy belly=happy guest!"}
{"text":"My favourite brunch place in Madison, by far. I've been here twice so far and the food has not failed to impress me regardless of how busy it is. The staff are extremely nice and seem happy doing their job.   The first time we were here, it was a busy Saturday morning and the line was out the door but the turnover was fast. The food came really fast and we were in and out in no time with happy bellies. I had their salmon frittata and their scrambler with rosemary toast this time. Also a must-try is their hazelnut almond mocha and their lavender white chocolate mocha (a bit too sweet for my taste).   I love this place!"}
{"text":"Marigold is fantastic. The food absolutely sets the standard, and the atmosphere is nice and comfortable. If I were rating on food alone, I would rate 5 stars no question. But there are some downsides: Marigold is perhaps too small, which makes for long wait times anytime you go and a /very/ cramped dining area. Additionally, its prices are high, which makes Marigold more of a special-occasion dining location than a weekly treat. The food certainly makes up for the negatives, but something to keep in mind."}
{"text":"I have been here twice in my life and now that I live super close, I may be here a lot more than that!  I ordered the weekend special of Chorizo Tacos with Huevos. The tacos came with chorizo (duh), shredded radish, cilantro, and cheese. It was amazing. It came with a side of black beans and of course, two eggs. I got my eggs over easy.  I also tried the Marigold Breakfast Sandwich. Anything with Boursin is the best. The ciabatta roll though was what got me. It's so fluffy, which is not a word I normally use to describe bread.  The coffee is $3 and unlimited refills, so that is honestly the best you could ask for on any morning if you need coffee.  It definitely gets busy on the weekend and especially on Farmer's Market Saturdays. We were able to find a place to sit easily. We sat outside, which was super nice."}
{"text":"Love everything. Egg white scrambler, amazing potatoes, rosemary toast, blueberry pancakes all delicious!! They have loose leaf tea, the pu-erh tea with ginger was amazing... Service is good, but it gets a little cramped and you're sitting back to back with someone at the peak times.  Interesting, though. You have to get in line and pay first, and then you get seated and you get your food. The line can be out the door, but it goes by quick and it's totally worth it!!"}
{"text":"Excellence dwells within Marigold Kitchen.  Yes, this place sets itself apart from other breakfast places for sure. The food shines. Marigolds keeps up with Madison's lovely tendency towards fresh, quality ingredients; this, coupled with the way that they put these ingredients together makes for an always wondrous breakfast experience. The flavor profiles of all of their dishes are a notch or two above your traditional breakfast fare.   Oh my goodness, the potatoes. That is, the side of breakfast potatoes that come with most meals are to-die-for. Such flavorful goodness.  I so appreciated the perfectly-cooked, delicious, not greasy egg whites and the healthy size portion of bacon.  Not to mention, they had such a broad array of equally delicious breads: rye, wheat, sourdough, french rosemary. Making that decision wasn't easy, let me tell ya.  BUT you haven't heard anything yet until you hear about their pancakes. Don't even get me started on the pancakes. The orange butter/syrup that they serve alongside these cakes makes these the pancakes to beat. Absolute heaven on a plate. If this orange syrup doesn't sound like your cup of tea you should really still try it. It is so good. And that's coming from someone who's not too fond of adding fruity things to other aspects of a meal. Normally, I like my fruit and I like my pancakes, separate that is. But no, you simply must try this pairing.  Overall, the food is great and the location is ideal.  Quaint spot that I highly recommend to all."}
{"text":"Our first time to The Marigold. Wow! Although the line was huge (Sunday brunch) it was well worth the wait both for service and food.   My partner and I shared the Roasted butternut frittata and the sour cream pancakes.  Both scrumptious. The frittata came with a small field greens salad that perfectly accompanied the savory squash with yummy button mushrooms; and just the perfect amount of havarti.   The pancakes were delicately stuffed with cinnamon apples. On an October morning, nothing better.   Inspite of the crowd, the staff was warm and very patient. They found seating for us in an extremely crowed Sunday morning. Cant wait to be back!"}
{"text":"I love brunches and marigold does them better than anyone in the isthmus area. They get a heavy volume of people over the weekends, and yet they maintain their quality in pretty much everything they do.  They have a lot of good seasonal omelettes, waffles, amazing espresso drinks and pastries. Their stuff isn't too greasy that's blatantly catering to your taste buds, instead the allure is more subtle and comes from varied flavors.  The decor is modern trendy hipster if you're into that sort of thing. The staff are friendly and polite despite dealing with heavy volumes constantly.  I'd highly recommend marigold for your brunch needs if you're in the isthmus area."}
{"text":"I have always been a huge fan of Marigold's. I used to eat there every Saturday and always recommended it to all my friends as the best brunch in Madison. Having been a long time fan of Marigolds, I'm very disappointed with my recent experiences there.  I've been unimpressed with them lately to the point where I feel compelled to update my review.  The egg dishes have been very greasy. I couldn't even finish eating my scrambler because It was so unappetizing.  On my visit last Saturday, the water cups by the self-serve water jug and coffee were stacked soaking wet...I'm certified in food safety and sanitation and know that dishes must air dry completely before being stacked to prevent bacterial growth. After seeing this, I was hesitant, but filled up 2 water glasses for my husband and I. My husbands glass had a huge lipstick stain---GROSS.   I really hope Marigolds turns it around."}
{"text":"Great location, just off Capitol Square. Food is fresh and interesting and it's a lively scene. I go there whenever I'm in Madison. Breakfast, lunch and brunch are all great."}
{"text":"Great food. Can get very crowded. One of the best breakfast places in Madison, but skip if you do not want to wait in line."}
{"text":"Went there last weekend on a busy Sunday morning. They have a different setup, where you wait in line, order, pay and then are assigned a seat. But they run it so well you really are only waiting for a short time after ordering.   The food is really delicious. I had a great omelette as top-notch cafe au lait.  If in Madison, this is a great breakfast spot."}
{"text":"I have come here twice while visiting Madison and I must say my girlfriend and I love it. The line can seem intimidating at times but tables flip fast and the line out the door can turn out to be only 15 minutes worth of a wait. The scrambler is excellent, any pancake or French toast dish is to die for and the omelets are always delicious. Do yourself a favor and get your butt down to marigold kitchen for breakfast brunch or even lunch. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Located just off of the square, this tiny nook of a restaurant is almost always busy.  The crowds are justified; I've never had an \"off\" meal here. They serve excellent brunch with all of the standbys but somewhat more thoughtfully prepared. They also have great sandwiches and salads for lunch. I love their cole slaw with fennel seeds. The only downside is the wait you will most likely encounter."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite brunch spot in Madison. You can always expect to wait at least 15 minutes at Marigold, because they serve food in style similar to Panera (wait in line to order & pay, wait at table for food), and the line always reaches to the door. It's worth the wait.  I usually opt for the breakfast sandwich option, which is different depending on when you go, since Marigold has a rotating menu. The sandwiches are always amazing, though the accompanying potatoes are just okay. It's usually enough food for me to take something home. I've also tried the scramblers a few times and have never been disappointed.  They have delicious iced teas and other gourmet drinks to sip on while you wait for a table. Tables are available on a first come, first serve basis, so it's probably not a great spot if you're with a large group, since you could end up waiting quite a while."}
{"text":"Love this spot in Madison! I visited on business and checked Yelp reviews for breakfast and I chose right... This is an adorable spot on the street (maybe you'd pass right by?) - many breakfast options... order at the counter and keep a number and they deliver to your table.  It was delicious. I'm not from the area so I can't speak on prices to quantity ratio, but the food was good and the staff was friendly!"}
{"text":"Tired and over-rated.  My duck confit hash took a lot of effort to find any duck in it.  The sausage soup had clearly been put together too quickly as the flavors hadn't simmered together and just tasted like all separate ingredients.  The worst part was the service.  My dining companion's salad and soup were forgotten when my order was brought.  Then, when they did bring it out, it was the wrong salad and no soup because I had an heirloom bloody and they made a heirloom salad instead.  Finally, they got it all right but it was 15 minutes after my duck confit has had been brought out and was well cold.  They basically shrugged their shoulders and said well all we can do is apologize.  No, first you can ask me if you'd like my entree made hotter  Secondly, you can get it right the first time.  Lastly, you can offer us some dessert or another drink for wasting so much of our time and being so blaise about it.  There was plenty you could do; you just chose not to because you are on the capital and have a good rep (for now) and you have the arrogance of hipsters who have no idea that at some point it all isn't going to go well and your service failures are going to count for something."}
