{"text":"Place was good weird location thou but no complains I got pupusas and the sweet plantain with beans and cream"}
{"text":"The food was delicious! I ordered 6 pupusas and they were amazing. The wait was too long though. Almost an hour for some pupusas and chicharrón? That's way too long. Also, the menus say $1.50 per pupusa, but we got charged $2 per pupusa."}
{"text":"Place was awesome!! Awesome service, and great affordable food. I ordered some pupusas which were not over the top greasy like most places and the churasco con camarones was just amazing!! Definitely recommend!!!"}
{"text":"For the first time I went today to get some popusas they where delicious I order frijoles con queso with is beans with mozzarella cheese n their only .99¢ when u by more than 12. I would recommend you to go."}
{"text":"This was my first time at a Salvadoran restaurant, and the food was great!  I had steak and chorizo, and some type of stuffed flatbread. Everything was delicious.

I am not in Vegas often, but I have bookmarked this as one to return to in the future."}
{"text":"I don't normally write reviews, but I believe this restaurant deserves one. it is one of vegas' hidden gems. The food was amazing and the ambiance was wonderful. The traditional Salvadorian horchata that they make here is by far the best I've ever tasted. The food was impeccable.  Quite fulfilling and totally worth the trip."}
{"text":"This was the FIRST of 4 roaches we saw. (Bad picture but you can see it above the napkins)Unfortunately for us we saw them halfway through our meal. We decided to pay and leave immediately. We Informed our waitress multiple times and she didn't even acknowledge our complaint, she just insisted we pay our bill. We paid and showed her that more were coming out, pointed at them and she looked and simply walked away. We got out of there fast and DISSAPOINTED!!! never coming back! Horrible service and customer retention(although I wouldn't come back even if she would've gave us a discount)

Would give 0 stars but Yelp won't allow it.
Also, picture is posted in the picture section!"}
{"text":"WORST PLACE TO GO TO! 
NO one attends you when you enter. Had to ask if we could seat ourselves and had to pickup menus on the way. 10 minute wait for the server to attend you. Placed our order and after waiting for 45 minutes, I asked the waiter how long of a wait for my order. She said that it was by order and that she didn't know. After asking again being that I was on lunch, was told it would be at least another 30 minutes until my order was up and that it wasn't her problem. I definitely don't recommend this place unless you can wait hour and a half to 2 hours for food."}
{"text":"Excellent Salvadoran breakfast, hand-made tortillas were delicious.  Have to come back for the pupusas soon!"}
{"text":"Great food! If you are looking for moms cooking, this is that authentic Salvador meal! Must try!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I live in Henderson and don't get to make it as often as I would like but anytime I'm in that area I make sure to go here to eat! I've never been anything less than extremely satisfied!"}
{"text":"I teach just up the block.  San Salvador's pupusas have rapidly become favorites of staff and students alike.  Try them and you'll be hooked.  You can't eat ten bucks worth in a sitting - only $1.50 a pop!"}
{"text":"No one speaks English.  Place is disgustingly dirty.  Service it terrible along with the food.  We had papusas which were good and quesdilla which was good. But I am afraid now for food poisoning.   We will never go back there again.
And yes I was sick later that day From the food"}
{"text":"Love this place. Food is delicious and service is great. Sometimes you wait long for your food but it's worth the wait. Pupusas best in town in my opinion."}
{"text":"Ok, so I read all the great reviews and I called and I was happy they could take phone orders.  I asked about the special for the 12 pupusas for a dollar.  They told me I could only get frijoles con queso (cheese and beans), or revuelta (pork and cheese) only.  BTW I don't like that the mixed (revuelta) is only pork and cheese, its usually pork,cheese, and beans. But anyway no biggie so I got 4 bean and cheese and 8 mixed, so I can get the special. They told me it would be ready in about 20 to 25 minutes. btw I called right when they opened at 10 so they weren't very busy.  When I came in 20 mins later, there was just one table, they were nice, and I waited about two minutes to get the food.  I left and when i got home i dug in.  the frijol with queso pupusas where delicious, but when i got the revoltas (mixed), half of the pupusa was only masa (dough). barely any meat or cheese in the center of the pupusa. I was hoping it was only that one but nope, all of the revueltas had barely anything in there which made it taste just like a thick tortilla. oh well, the cheese and beans was good at least.  also their salsa is good but on the spicier side.  If I am by the area, ill most likely give them another try. and yes i would recommend."}
{"text":"I came to eat at this place during vacation and omg their empanadas are delicious and their pupusas have a lot to eat inside yummy. I would give 5 stars but the churasco was not good. Also while your there try the esalada de fruta drink its yummy!"}
{"text":"Fabulous food and so inexpensive. Since this was our first time there, we ordered a lillte bit of everything: three pupusas, yuca con chicharron, tamales de pollo and empanadas de platano. Everything was made to order, so it took awhile, but so worth the wait!!! Everything was fresh, hot and so tasty. They serve breakfast, lunch a dinner. The waitress was so sweet and attentive. We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Horrible servicio que dan aquí... la mesera male educada ni sabe saludar, con la cara parada de miserable."}
{"text":"Food was good. Service was bad. I have never sat in a restaurant so long before. It was horrible to be there with kids."}
{"text":"Just when I thought I couldn't find a salvadorean restaurant I found one not far from downtown Las Vegas !! This place is big and comfortable . Only thing was I was on a tight time schedule and the food took twice as long as they had told me when I walked in but regardless it was good and will come back soon ! Oh the pupusas are 1.50 each butnif you buy 12 they are 12$ good price :)"}
{"text":"Best pupusas in LV by far. Loroco and chicharrone and queso all tops. If you like pupusas you need to hit this place today. That cook lady in the back KILLS it!! Awesome"}
{"text":"OK, being Salvadorian and coming from Los Angeles,  i went to this place in search of some delicious, authentic Salvi (Salvadorian) food. This place has delicious food, that actually tastes like Salvadorian food. I didn't, however, like the service much. They took for ever to help me, take my order and bring the food. The server, .a female that's always there, wasn't very attentive either. If you're looking for some good authentic food, and are patient then you will like the place. Their food was delicious. I ate \"machaca con huevo\" breaklefast style. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"BEST TACOS! I enjoy the food, the chicken is cooked perfectly and they made the most tasty tacos. The pupusas are good, the burritos the curtado....pretty much over all good food and the ladies that work there are super nice"}
{"text":"The pupusas revueltas here are so freaking good. Like, so good that I don't order anything else. Grab two for under $5 and that's a meal. Try to have the patience to let them cool so you can consume them without burning your fingertips and tongue, but if you can't, I understand.

Tiny restaurant is situated in a busy lot, but the cozy interior and friendly staff more than make up for any minor parking inconveniences. Prices are low, food is fresh. Fellow diners recommend the soups and grilled meats (specifically the steak/shrimp plates?), similar to other centro-Americo style spots.

But the pupusas are the best thing here, and the revueltas are the best of them. A tiny bit greasy, but thick with filling and such great flavor. I'm tempted to go get some right now..."}
{"text":"As upon walking through the doors you have feeling of walking into tee tees house and it's warm with Spanish music blazing and kids hollering lol. A very humble waiter walks up and greets us with a direct smile as if he knows this is our first time but will not be our last. We are seating in the booth in this small family owned business. We order a modeling and Budweiser which feels stronger than usual. I order caldo de pata ( cow foot soup) empanadas de carne and empanadas de platano. 

Whilst we sit and wait you can smell the spices boiling and the cooks singing. Any place there's singing and stirring there's love on each bowl. The waiter comes with the food... excuse me while I wipe my tears. Firstly the food is placed well with perfect serving amounts. Piping hot soup when it's 112 outside! Why not!! 


Well the carrots are beautiful corn yellow/good and cabbage steamed lovely. The broth on this soup opening every organ in my entire body.  As I take some of the gelatinous fat if the cow foot with the broth and put in my mouth..........I believe my husband has never made me fell this good! No I mean it!!  They are cooking their ass off in this place!! There should be a law against the feeling I'm getting from this bowl of cow foot soup!! 


You know what I can't take it.. I need to eat this is seclusion! Waiter bag me up and let me out of here!! We need to be alone!!!

Well worth it guys"}
{"text":"I would give this restaurant 0 stars if I could. I used to love going to this place since their pupusas are the closeted to my grandmothers that I could find, but yesterday when I put in an order for pick and went into go get it, as I was waiting for my food to be ready I killed a cockroaches with my shoe, after that I became paranoid and looked around only to see two more close to the kitchen entrance. I left without my order."}
{"text":"Coming back to the USA after being in Japan for two years, my wife (whose parents are from El Salvador) was dying for some El Salvadorian food.  She read the reviews here and really, really, really wanted to go.  The only problem was that the first night we went, we got here at 1950 and the doors were already locked since it closes at 2000.  My wife was in absolute tears, but we made do at a Tex Mex joint that worked out with giant Margaritas.

The next day, I went with my wife, mom, and dad.  My mom is Japanese and my dad is a big southern white guy - they rarely eat Latino food, and never tried El Salvadorian.  We had the paposa's and they were in love.  My mom ordered the giant fish in garlic and it was by far the best fish she had had cooked ever.  My dad who normally sticks with beef went with the shrimp soup and fell in love.  My wife was amazing happy as my parents enjoyed the food she grew up with.

This place is legit as my wife would like to say.  It made her really happy and although the hours are pretty sparse, the food is definitely home cooked, the coffee tastes good, and the service is nice.  I wish it was a little closer to the strip since we had a $25 cab ride to get there, but it worked out and we are back in Japan awaiting our next time we can go get amazing legit El Salvadorian food."}
{"text":"Nope!! Huge Nope!! They came out in Dirty Dinner and they showed the inside of their kitchen. It was disgusting and full of roaches! They had roaches on the cheese and flour for the pupusas. After they were closed they supposedly \"cleaned it\" but they still dirty. I used to come here but after that, No more... GROSS!"}
{"text":"Perfect Pupusas. We ate for less than $10 and being Salvadorian , I wish I had a pupusa place like this back home!"}
{"text":"Well this place is decent. The food was ok. I got the tamales but turn out they only have de \"elote\" I didn't liked them much. I messed up in what I got. But everyone else's plate was good."}
{"text":"I still love this dive of a restaurant. It was one of me and my husband's first dates when we were still just friends. Cheap eats, lots of carbs and cheese, what's not to like? We always get the pupusas. At about $2 each, i usually get 2 or 3 depending on how hungry i am. I'm a piggy, and they are big, plan accordingly. I always ask for extra curtido too and they don't charge extra for it.

The staff is friendly, but their English is hit or miss. Sometimes you'll get one that speaks perfect English, other times they speak less English than i speak Spanish. I know enough to get by; they've not messed up my order yet. If all else fails, point and smile.

Pupusas do take a while to cook tho, so be patient. And sometimes they run out of certain fillings. They are all yummy. I still can't decide which is my favorite between the chicharone/cheese, pork/cheese, loroco, flor de calabaza, or pork/beans.

The hot sauce they serve in the red bottle isn't hot at all, so if you want hot, there's Tapatio or Cholula (my fave) on the table.

Hours posted say they are open till 8pm but i was there once and they locked the doors at 7:30 so don't be late."}
{"text":"Ok place. Like most Vegas Salvadorian places it's huge and empty.. Pupusas are way too thick and doughy, especially the corn ones. Rice are a bit better. Other selection is OK, nothing exciting or overwhelming. Prices are OK, vibe is nonexistent and service is perfunctory."}
{"text":"Disappointing. While authentic Salvadorian food, this place does not provide any unique flavors, taste or even good quality food. Tamales are fried instead of boiled and have a weird aftertaste of old food (definitely not what you'd expect from fresh Elote). Pupusas while filled generously are way too thick and the dough is not fully cooked. Way too oily. Perhaps because the pan wasn't hot enough. Service was lazy despite the fact there were only 2 customers in the restaurant. Not recommended."}
{"text":"Fantastic pupusas!  As with any pupseria, though, greatness takes time.  I recommend the queso y loroco pupusas, as well as my new favorite, calabasa.  I dare you to try and eat 3; at $1.50, it will be the cheapest and most delicious dare you've ever failed at!"}
{"text":"This place feels really authentic. Not big at all but that's not a problem. I came in and got 5 pupusas to go. They were actually pretty good, maybe a little over stuffed on some but for the most part good. The only thing is that I didn't know which was which when I got my order. (As in it wasn't labeled) not a huge deal but I just wanted to be able to tell which one was the rice mesa pupusa. Overall, just eating 2 got me stuffed. They're not bad reheated but like anything else, they're better when fresh"}
{"text":"Hands down the best Salvadoran place in Vegas.  Food was so good i wanted to go in the kitchen and kids the chef."}
{"text":"The bean and cheese pupusa was off the charts. These are individually prepared though, my order took a little while to reach me. But the wait was worth it! Warm pupusa with a zesty slaw and hot sauce, perfect!"}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with 12 pupusas for $12.  Pupusas were delicious and fresh.  They have a wide variety of choices for pupusas but the special deal was for either pork and cheese or bean and cheese.  

Yup, I'd come back.  Definitely."}
{"text":"My husband, my friend and I were craving for pupusas. We found these and checked them out. 
The servers were really friendly, though they spoke chopped English. 
The pupusas themselves were good-sized and almost tastes like my friends moms. 
The only reason why it's a four star, is because our table was kind of sticky."}
{"text":"great pupusas! isn't that why you go to a Salvadoran restaurant. good curtido! fast service. bien ambiente."}
{"text":"Service kind of slow, food wasn't that good. But sales snacks from El Salvador, which was the only thing I liked, but probably won't be going back"}
{"text":"The pork pupusas are heaven and practically melt in your mouth.  The prices are GREAT! You have to try this place at least once."}
{"text":"I have read several negative reviews  regarding the slow service. All I can say is, it might take a little longer than a typical fast food joint because the food is fresh and it is prepared well. If you are looking for fast and mediocre, go somewhere else. If you want delicious quality food; this is it. The staff was polite, the food was good, and I will be adding this to my regular takeout rotation."}
{"text":"This place is horrible. Waited 30min for my eggs and beans to come out. Then another 10min for them to redo my eggs because they put onions- allergic to that!!

Never coming here again.. specially when I'm starving.."}
{"text":"The location is great. The food is average. The wait was horrible. Nearly 40 minutes from order to service. And the waitress explained it away by pointing to another night customer who waited 35 minutes.

Never again"}
{"text":"I really want to give this place ZERO stars! Ew! They have roaches...visible roaches! Steer clear!"}
{"text":"Authentication Salvadorean food.! My son had the zucchini cheese pupusas and I had the yucca with chicharon and it was delicious.!!! 
I plan to go back tomorrow morning for breakfast"}
{"text":"Worse place I've stopped at in Las Vegas, save your self your day, and don't waste your time at this spot, look elsewhere, you'll do yourself a favor."}
{"text":"3.5***
Walked in and it looked like they were preparing a catering order in kitchen.  Uuuuh hello?  anybody there?  I'm hungerz....

Restaurant feel reminds me of my grandparents' old kitchen in Oakland with the kitchen sounds, some kind of fan blowing, sounds of people talking, TV on 
(except in my grandparents house they didn't speak Spanish).  It's a comfy food environment.

Cool stuff: TVs, super mini grocery and snacks on corner shelves.  Pupusas are only $0.99 !!! But ask which ones.  Also their Tamarind agua fresca is really good; not sour.

Didn't see sopas de pollo on the menu.  I was hoping to have some.  There is seafood, beef and pata sopas.  

I went with the Pollo de Crema plate.  It came with 2 cheese pupusas.  But my food plate wasn't exactly hot, especially the chicken.  The flavor was still good, and I liked the cream sauce.  It had green bell peppers, onions, and tomatoes.  Comes with salad, rice, and beans.  My only wish was the food - chicken and all - was hot."}
{"text":"Great place for papusa, very small restaurant, nice attendant,  but food is authentic...mom and pop"}
{"text":"Tiny place but the pupusas are as authentic as they come! Pupusas took a while to come out but they are made to order so it's totally understandable. They were definitely worth the wait, absolutely delicious!! Great service too!!"}
{"text":"I thought this was one of the Salvadorian restaurant I like and 've been before but it was not. Nonetheless, it was not disappointing.
 
I love hole in the wall authentic places and this was one of them. Lots of choices to choose from on a easy to read menu (translations for each item). The interior of the small restaurant has a shelf filled with snacks for sale.
 
We ordered Mix Seafood soup $12.95, Pupusas with pork and cheese and 
Churrasco with eggs and shrimps $13.95. They were very flavorful and broth of the seafood soup is amazing. A plate of pupusa came with the meal.

The pupusa, a cornmeal patty that is a Salvadorian standard was quite tasty. There is also a cup of slaw and red sauce which is traditionally used as a topping for the pupusa. Pupusas had also a slightly charred exterior that created a delicious caramelized effect. 

We ordered at the counter, we were not sure if we should grab a table. The food came out in 15 mins and the lady was very nice and attentive. We will surely be back."}
{"text":"Yelp you fail me horribly!! Do not eat here, service was bad, the waitress were arguing in front of us because they were stealing each other's food and their customers were not getting the food on time. Our food was cold and dull, how do serve pupusas with no cabbage un acceptable! No start here! Get this place out of you number one spot it is horrible!!"}
{"text":"Este lugar no lo recomiendo.  Ordenas pupusas para llevar y se los venden a otra gente. No agarran nombres para que su orden sea para uno nomas. Las ordenes son para todos yo creo pffff.. no nomas por que llegue 10 minutos tarde, por que primeramente nunca tiene tu orden al la hora que te dicen y llegue pa recojer mi orden  y me dicen \"ya tus ordenes las vendimos\". No pues ya que verdad. No los recomiendo para nada.. ni pa decir disculpa o sabe que orita le ago sus ordenes o un descunto por la espera o algo.."}
{"text":"This place is good and affordable but the service is really bad the waitress would only bring one person a drink or refill instead of bringing for everyone. She never asked if all was good and we had to keep looking for her. Also they need to fix the A/C it was really warm in there."}
{"text":"My parents are from El Salvador, so I'm very judgmental when it comes to Salvadorian food. After reading the reviews about this place, I was excited to try this place since I've been living overseas for almost 2 years and nowhere near my hometown for the New Years celebrations. 

My first try to visit this place was a bust since I misread the closing hours; I thought it said it closed at 22:00 (10pm) but in fact, closes at 20:00 (8pm), so when my hubby and I showed up at around 7:50pm, and the doors were already locked...I was bummed. 

We tried again the next day around lunchtime, this time we brought my in-laws as well since they came out to Vegas to see us. As soon as we walked in, and saw the decor celebrating El Salvador, I was pumped; that's the first sign that the place will be great. We were seated and as soon as I looked through the menu, I wanted everything on the menu (going through two years w/o Salvadorian food is rough)! I ordered a couple of pupusas (my favorite is called Revueltas - mixed with pork and cheese) as well as a typical Salvadorian breakfast consisting of fried plantains, sour cream, refried beans, a piece of queso fresco (a fresh, white cheese), and two fried eggs. My only gripe about the meal was that the eggs were cooked over hard (I like them over medium) but other than that, AMAZING FOOD! Reminded me of my own mother's cooking and came close to shedding tears of joy.

My in-laws are not Latinos (MIL is Japanese, FIL is your average White guy from the Midwest) so this was their first time trying Salvadorian food, so I was a bit nervous if they'd like it or not. Their consensus: they LOVED it! MIL ordered the mojarra frita (fried Tilapia fish) done al mojo de ajo (garlic sauce) - she usually skips eating the skin of a fish but she enjoyed the crispy and flavorful skin of this one. My FIL ordered a seafood soup with fish and shrimp and enjoyed it greatly. He specifically said that he loved the fact the soup was tasty without being too fishy. They also tried the pupusas and liked it a lot. Hubby and I loved the pupusas so much, we ordered a dozen to go and had as breakfast the next day...YUM!

I only wish it was closer to the Strip - cab ride was about $25 to get there but was well worth it! If I ever visit Las Vegas again, this will be on the top of my list to visit again."}
{"text":"I was in Las Vegas for the weekend and noticed this place on Yelp due to its high star rating. The pupusas were amazing and the banana empanadas were also delicious. The food was hot and freshly prepared to order. The service was prompt and the staff was very friendly and attentive. Don't be fooled by the simplistic exterior of the restaurant. This place is definitely a must try for Salvadorian food and they also have a section on the menu for Mexican food as well. I didn't have room for desert but I would imagine anything they prepare with bananas would be worth trying so consider a fried banana desert if you eat here."}
{"text":"Pretty good food. The corn tamales and fried bananas were my favorite! The staff is friendly, good music and clean restaurant. Lots to choose from on the menu. The chicharron with cheese popusas was my favorite."}
{"text":"Really good authentic Salvadorian food. The pork pupusas are my favorite and the tacos are amazing. I wasn't a fan of the service.  The waitress is a little rude and it took a while before she took our order.  Besides that this hole in the restaurant has the best pupusas."}
{"text":"This place has delish pupusas! Can't speak for the other dishes, but I can't wait to come back and try more. There is a bit of a language barrier but the wait staff are friendly. They close at 8 which I think is due to the neighborhood. Decor is weird since the ceiling looks like it should belong in an Italian joint (fake vineyard look complete with grapes). 

Minus 1 star for 20 minute wait for two pupusas to go."}
{"text":"Very affordable.   I love the corn tamales and the fried bananas.  The ham and eggs is also well done.  However, try the pupusas.   It's a thick tortilla with beans and cheese or mixed with pork.  I think this place has some of the better ones in Vegas.   The service is slow because it's not too full and obviously trying to save on help but I think the food is fantastic and as this place grows, so will it's service."}
{"text":"Amazing pupusas and best cortido in town. They take awhile to make so orser before you go, but truly delicious food"}
{"text":"The wait time is a little lax, but it's expected when delicious food is made to order. The food is great and really what we were expecting. The place is a nice spot, kid friendly an all around friendly, clean and safe. Food is reasonably priced for the amount of food you got (which they were generous, might I add)."}
{"text":"The papusas are fabulous. the zucchini & cheese are my favorite, and they are filled with cheesy goodness, flavorful and filling. Great for feeding a lot of people on a budget!"}
{"text":"Food was ok. Not that great. Service is definitely not good here. I ordered a tamarindo drink and it was hirrible. Worst i ever had. I told the waitress that I think the drink is spoiled, and she looked at me like if I did something wrong. Wont be back. Place looks like it use to be an Italian restaurant."}
{"text":"The menu is surprisingly overpriced, save for the main attraction here which is the pupusas. Pupusas are very good and tasty but the restaurant itself has poor, slow service. They would do well to have a window where you could just drop by and order or pick up the pupusas which is all I can recommend here."}
{"text":"Ive been in Vegas for 1 yr and half now and ive been looking for some good Salvadorian food.

Ive come across a few places and they been good and i came across San Salvador. I have to say they are great....the pupusas are tasty and the prices are great.

I definitely will be going back to for some of the other Salvadorian food"}
{"text":"My husband and I are having a debate about who has better burritos at the corner of Smoke Ranch and Rainbow, he prefers the truck. My vote is San Salvador. I love their chicken burrito without frijoles. I hate beans but their chicken is impeccable. It's slowly stewed and very flavorful with a nice amount of spice. When I get take out here it is always piping hot to the point of almost burning my hands. 

I love their cheese and pork pupusas. San Salvador believes in cheese. I say this because some places give a small sprinkling of cheese, not so here. Everything has plenty of cheese and creme. I don't prefer their carne asada. It lacks a bit of lime and some other qualities but their chicken is spot on. Even their super cheesy chicken quesadilla is a hit with the younger set. 

I wanted to try a torta but I think the server misunderstood me because I received 2 tacos instead. That fine, I was so full from the pupusas and other items that a torta would have been too heavy. I will try one some day. 

Although this place is a hole in the wall they do have good food at a good value. I prefer to walk in and take my food home. Their air conditioning could use a service because it was kind of warm in there and it was only 80 degrees outside. 

San Salvador offers a good selection of beers from domestics like Budweiser to Dos X's."}
{"text":"Being from Los Angeles and having access to pupussa everywhere I have to say I love the food here great price,service and pupusa's"}
{"text":"DON'T EAT HERE!!! They have 43 Demerits with live roaches and spoiled food. I've never ate here. But after seeing them on Dirty Dining. I'm good. I don't want to get food poising."}
{"text":"Delicioso!! El servicio es genial, definitivamente buen lugar para disfrutar de la buena comida"}
{"text":"Eu sou Brasileira meu namorado é de El Salvador viemos conhecer esse restaurante e nós gostamos muito , muito bommm."}
{"text":"Mi familia y yo viajamos a Laa Vegae y decidimos comer comida salvadoreña y lamentablemente el servicio y la calidad de comida es muy mala. Esperamos como 2 horas para que nos entregaran la comida y solo era una persona atendiendo. Cuando recibimos la comida, una estava helada, el queso no servia y toda la comida estava muy mala. No creo que este negocio sobreviva ya q es muy mala calidad. No lo recomiendo para nadie."}
{"text":"Food is good, but it would take, at least, 45 minutes to get, even your drink. On Eastern they announced they would close at 6:00 pm. We came in at 5:05 pm and were denied service because the cook said our food would not be out before 6:00 pm. I don't understand their idea of \"making business\"."}
{"text":"Love this place! I love pupusas, and the food here is really delicious. I have been a frequent customer here and it's never a let down. If you wanna bounce and take out they have a really good deals just for that. I know why people come here, don't really need advertising the food speaks for itself. Staff is really nice as well."}
{"text":"Very bad experience .. one server one cook and 15 ppl sitting around waiting on food , ordered 5 papusas and 35 min later still waiting ... never coming back and water !! How can you mess up water !!! You can taste the water is out of faucet.."}
{"text":"Phenomenally fresh Salvadorian eats that scream flavor are the bread-and-butter of this place. Generous portions and pleasant service every time I visit. Casual atmosphere and reasonable prices further make them a local favorite. I would definitely recommend to locals and tourist alike."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch at 11:45 am.  Got my food at 12:31
Chicken  enchilada was very dry and the rice was dry.   NOT WORTH YOUR TIME OR MONEY!   Horrible never again"}
{"text":"The food is delicious. Everything is made to order.  Best popusas I've had in a long time.  Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"I'm a fan! This place has changed over the years, but the pupusas are quite tasty!  I have returned a couple times and will continue to do so!  It's a good place for sit down or you can order ahead and pick up, either way they are absolutely delish!"}
{"text":"The food was really good! Unfortunately I forgot to take a picture of the food but I had ordered revuelta pupusas and they tasted amazing! It was my first time trying Salvadoran horchata and it was pretty good too! My mom and I liked how the horchata had a roasty taste. My mom ordered grilled fish with shrimp and she loved it as well. Overall, amazing food!"}
{"text":"So we're new to the area and looking for a good authentic Mexican food spot. This Lil hole in the wall place is legit! It is small and there was only one waitress but the food is delicious. My bf had the pupusas and they were delicious. I had the shrimp cocktail. Amazing!! Oh and their michelads are perfect. We are definitely coming back here."}
{"text":"Great hole in the wall. I read all the reviews (positive and negative) before I got here. My food came out in about 6 minutes. I could hear the chefs patting the pupusas together as I sat at my table enjoying my glass bottle of coke. It's true that the staff doesn't really speak English but they are polite, and they make an effort. (I usually find that the food is great at places you have to point at a menu to order.)

In addition to delicious food made to order, you can get random frozen fruits like cashew fruit or nonce from the freezer cabinet next to the cash register. On the other side of the register there is a separate shelving area for interesting snacks and dried goods. But there are 11 booths and 4 tables you can sit at to enjoy your food. My pupusas were delicious! My only criticism is that the slaw wasn't as spicy as I like because there was only 3 rings of jalapeños in it, and I prefer the long cut Serranos... I will definitely bring my friend and family here. Don't get discouraged by the people who need microwave food speed service."}
