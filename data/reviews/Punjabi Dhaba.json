{"text":"Awesome service , Awesome food. We had gone has a group, their customer service was off the chain. Everything we ordered was so tasty. If you go, I recommend thaali, mango lassi , and their Dhaba Chai. I wish they had similar restaurant in Atl"}
{"text":"Great food - fast service and super cheap! My boyfriend and I had dinner, dessert and a drink with a total cost of only $25. Would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Dined here on 5/28/15. True to the ratings expressed by other patrons, the vegetarian food served was excellent. Ordered Dhal Makani (5/5), Aloo-Gobi fry (5), and Malai Kofta (4.5).  The several types of Nan's and rotis we shared were are very tasty. To top it the gazara halva was the best we ever tasted. The final item masala chai flavor fully wrapped our excellent experience.

 The host and owner Anil is a smiling, vv courteous young gentleman. The place is clean, void of smells, clean restrooms, pleasing ambiance, serves moderately priced menus. In summary, an excellent place."}
{"text":"The best quality Punjabi food. Pure home style cooking. We have been there twice to have breakfast and the quality and quantity is good and the best."}
{"text":"The butter chicken wrap is amazing.  Wish it was more consistent though as some days it's not very spicy, others it's a killer it's so spicy.  

Another issue is that it sometimes takes 5 min, others it can take up to 15. I wish I could say it because they were busy but I was the only one there that day. 

Great staff though and I will come back for sure."}
{"text":"I was on a business trip and just happened to book a hotel near the Airport - not knowing that the neighborhood was a Punjabi belt. To that extent, Punjabi Dhaba - happens to be right next to the Airport. I was in Mississauga for around 4 days and I must say that for the first time in my 20 years of being outside of India, I actually had Indian food - in all my meals. 
I ended up dividing my visits between Punjabi Dhaba and the Sweet Shop next door - Standard Sweets.
About Punjabi Dhaba - The place is neat and tidy. The utensils are all steel and are very clean. The 2 young guys that I saw front ending the customers - were both sharp and welcoming.
The food is extremely delicious and very very authentic Punjabi style. I tried their buffet selection, Tea, Makki ki roti with Saag etc.....and surely can't complain.  The rates are very nominal and very genuine given the quality and quantity of food they serve.They also have a Wi-Fi - so that works out well.
Being from Dallas, where there aren't many true Punjabi restaurants, I savored each and every dish that I tried there.I wish we had a few such joints in Dallas as well.

Do give it a try  - if and when you can."}
{"text":"Skeptical at first as the place did not look well kept, I decided to give it a chance. Upon entering, it rather felt quite cozy. It seems as if the intended vibe was a traditional fast food Indian restaurant, which I feel they achieved really well. There is abundant comfortable seating, and everything is kept fairly clean. They also seem to have a food truck that may have been operational in the past and they've now not so long ago become a fixed location. Service here is just fine, there isn't always someone at the counter but as soon as you step up to it they are there promptly. As for the food, it truly does taste good, and compared to traditional Indian food is on par with taste, spice, and quality. While i was there I tried the buffet with paneer, naan, rice, dahi, and daal, all which were very good. I would pass on the dessert here, as it is not that great, a small setback. Overall, considering the affordability and quality, it is definitely a go to place."}
{"text":"~ solid 3.5 stars ~

I went with some peeps from work during lunch and got their veg thali and a plate of Tandoori fish. Wow it was a lot of food!

The place has some decent seating area but its not a huge restaurant. 

On the veg Thali, I got palak paneer, masala choola and aloo pea gravy. The meal also came with rice, roti, salad and raita (yogurt). For the price I think the quantity was great but the dishes were average in taste. 

On the other hand, we also had the plate of Tandoori fish. It was fried well and had a very thin breaded coating, which was very good. 

To finish it up we also got their masala chai, which was splendid. 

The service was quick as the food was ready to choose from. Tables were clean as well 

All in all decent meal for a decent price! good portions...Its worth the price!"}
{"text":"Non Veg Thali. Best deal - $7.99! Get it. You won't regret it. 

AND you get dessert with the thali - I got carrot halwa. :)"}
{"text":"After a five hour flight, I was in the mood for some good Indian food. After searching for a nearby restaurant, I came across this place on a map and It is certainly a diamond in the rough! It's hidden along a busy road near a shopping center, but the sign is pretty big so you can't miss it. Although the service was a little slower, the restaurant had a really nice homey vibe. I ordered butter chicken and garlic naan. Both were absolutely delicious! The sauce was flavorful and the chicken was cooked perfectly. The naan was garnished with fresh garlic and came out very crispy! Surprisingly a side of rice doesn't come with the meal, but that's really the only downside. The prices are very reasonable for the quality of the food. Well worth it!"}
{"text":"Hands down the BEST Channa Bhatura I've had in the GTA. Everything about that meal screams homemade. I discovered this joint thanks to a friend and I owe him big lol. I don't always get to eat desi coz I'm lazy to put in the effort at home. I have random spots for different dishes across the GTA, this is the ONLY place i'll go if i want channa bhatura. 

My parents were visiting from Pakistan and i took them here right after i picked em up from the airport, it exceeded expectations their for authenticity, and why wouldn't it?!! I know my food and i love what Punjabi Dhaba puts out. Go try it ... right NOW!"}
{"text":"This place was good. We just moved to the GTA and have been looking for a Punjabi restaurant, as my husband is Punjabi. The food is fresh and reasonably priced. The butter chicken is tasty, might be a little to spicy for those who can't take a lot of heat. The curry chicken and Shahi paneer were ok, not bad though. It's a sit down fast food place, quick and the naans are fresh. 
It was under $25 for the both of us. We would come back for a quick cheap meal."}
{"text":"Delicious, no-frilles cheap North Indian food. The thalis are awesome value and pretty much everything they have ranges from great to excellent. For the price, you can't really go wrong here. A nice hidden gem in Mississauga"}
{"text":"The restaurant looks presentable. When we got our thali(s) that's when everything went downwards. The rice was old and powdery. Don't know if they pull it out the freezer. Nowhere near fresh. The portions for the combos(thali) was so tiny that even my 9year old son can eat. That's 10$ for thali. And we order more curry chicken and that was small too and watered down. The dessert was ras malai and it was straight out the freezer and into the microwave therefore gave it that discussing rubbery chew. All the food is basically frozen and then Thawed before it reaches your table. We order the lassi and that was a waste of time. It was just watered down with water and then blended vigorously so it gave it that soapy foam sud look. Eew. I would find another place to dine. Stay clear."}
{"text":"I visited them after a year and things are a lot better now... The food was fresh and Naan were oven hot. Taste is very good and staff is friendly and helpful. With the pricing, the place is definitely worth going more than once"}
{"text":"Amazing Punjabi Food! Excellent prices as well. Reminded us of back home kind of a Dhaba! Folks are very friendly as well."}
{"text":"This place is offers one of the best vegi Thali in North America. Staff is extremely curtious and friendly. What amazed me was the amount of attention given cleaness for utensils and restaurant."}
{"text":"As an Interior Decorator I'm frequently at the International Center & have been meaning to try this place for lunch which is down the road from the International Center. I'm very glad I did try it today. I ordered veg-thali (plate) take out. The thali includes 3 vegetables curries with rice, roti or naan bread, raita, &, a salad. Their saraon-ka-saag (mustard green curry) is outstanding. So is their daal-makhani(lentils in cream) & chole (spicy garbanzo). Their dishes are on the spicier side & delicious. I also ordered samosas for a snack which they serve with a spicy green chilly-garlic chutney which hit the spot with a cup of tea as a late afternoon snack especially on a rainy day. The thali is very filling & is easily shared with an extra roti & 1 extra curry between two people. On the other hand, if you have skipped breakfast, you can do justice to the full thali. 
The decor is average but adequate for a sit-in. I'll definitely go back & try the other dishes."}
{"text":"Quick, cheap and tasty!  With not much time to grab a lunch during a busy day, I spotted Punjabi Dhabi from the road as I was about to pass it. With lightning reflexes, I careened wildly into the small parking lot and shoehorned in between to poorly parked vehicles. 

Inside is small, simple, with a hot table style counter. I ordered the Non-veg Thali. Even though it looks like a cafeteria, they brought my meal to my table. 

Very tasty, good amount of heat, served with a freshly baked Naan. I hoovered it all down. 

Bookmark this one for a fast but good meal when you are in the area."}
{"text":"Butter chicken and chicken biryani were really good, the chicken kebab plate however was terrible."}
{"text":"Hubby and i came for their non veg Thali dinner on our way to the airport. Amazing food! For $10 you get 2 meat dishes and 1 veg dish, plus naan/roti, rice, raita and choice of dessert. The rotis and naans were cooked to perfection and we can actually see the lady in the kitchen rolling the dough. My hubby said the butter chicken and moong dhal he had is the most authentic dhaba food he had tasted so far in Canada. The lady at the counter was very sweet, courteous and friendly. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch while i was Toronto they specialize in Indian thali so that's what I ordered with the non-veg version you get to pick two meets plus two veg or one veg with yogurt it also comes with rice, naan, pickled carrots, and a little salad I also ordered two bhatura(deep fried Indian bread) and one coke

For my curry options I picked the butter chicken, chicken curry, eggplant curry, and cheese curry I tried the naan first and it was on point freshly buttered chard and a little crisp on the edges then I tried the naan with the eggplant curry which was also excellent it had a good amount of spice and the eggplant was cooked perfect this was easily the best curry out of the four the butter chicken and the chicken curry were both good variations however neither were typically memorable the cheese curry was enjoyable very similar sauce to the butter chicken and went well with the naan as for the bhatura it was a little bit too thick and doughy than I prefer and it did not puff up as much as I like however I still enjoyed it with the curries 

All in all it was a good lunch and everyone was super friendly this being a fast food place it really did punch above its weight and price point the only reason I did not give it four stars was for the bhatura I also ordered one gulab jammun to go and it was very good"}
{"text":"India!
Almost nobody speaks English there but, it's a immersive experience. The food is mostly vegetarian. Love it."}
{"text":"This place is moving on up. They started with a food truck and now they have their own restaurant and they haven't missed a beat. Hands down one of the best places for Indian food. I had the curry chicken with rice and butter naan. The curried chicken was rich and had just the right amount of spice to it, the rice was a little plain, but when you covered it with the curried chicken is was great. The butter naan was good, but I would recommend trying the garlic naan and it was much better.  The service can be slow here, so make sure you give yourself some time to enjoy the mean. Also I recommend staying away from the platters as they aren't what they seem."}
{"text":"Great traditional punjabi /  indian food at a great price.  The customer service was great and they accommodated all my requests. I had butter chicken with garlic naan, it was very tasty, and my thali also had a delicious veggie mix of potatoes. Great food, great service, awesome business and would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Pretty good for \"fast food\" and really affordable prices. I ordered a non-veg thaali and you get one veggie dish, two non-veg options, rice, naan, salad, achaar, and dhai. Service is really quick too!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a no-nonsense taste of Punjab, this is it! I ordered their non-veg thali, and instead of 2 meat + 1 veg + rice + naan, I opted for 1 meat (goat curry), aloo gobi and kidney beans. I am always unsure I want to order thali dishes for dinner because some of the curry can be sitting there since lunch, but because the traffic is high, it was cooked fresh. Best aloo gobi (cauliflower + potato), must try!"}
{"text":"YAAASSS, finally knocked this off my 'Bookmarks' as I was in the area!  And this may be somewhat odd, but this place was a peaceful oasis in contrast to the sale I was coming from at the International Centre.

Atmosphere:  Dining room was on the small-ish side with tables of 2-4 and a few booths around the perimeter of half of the restaurant.  A coupla tvs played contemporary Indian flicks which were funny to watch!  Food was at the counter, behind glass, separated by Meat/Veg.  Overall, restaurant is new, clean, and somewhat quiet during my off-hours visit ~3pm-ish.

I ordered at the counter, took a seat, and a nice Sikh chap brought the food.  I ordered a Meat Thali ($7.99) and my friend got to Veg Thali ($6.99), and we got to choose the 3 selections that came with the combo.  Thalis also came with freshly baked naan which was heavenly - although you hafta eat within a minute or else it sorta gets soggy and not-so-nice.

I enjoyed thoroughly 2 out of the 3 selections, as did my friend.  For me, the sauce for the Muttar Paneer was sorta weak.  It was definitely on the spicy side, but my friend pointed it out and said it tasted like \"Chef Boyardee\".  Friend's Palak Paneer was waaay, waaay too salty to the point of being inedible.

Standouts:  Butter Chicken, Mixed Veg, apparently the Daal was nice, & definitely get the Naan if it doesn't already come with your order.  Chilli Chicken was pretty good in a Hakka/Chinesey sort of way.  I found the chicken in both the Butter/Chilli dish slightly on the dry side, maybe they need to stir the chafing plate more often.  However, flavour in both were SOLID.  Food wasn't too rich or ghee laden.

***ALSO ORDER:  $1.50 Chai!  Best chai that I've had in a long time.  Lovely flavours, not too punchy, more delicate.  Be sure to stir well as all the sugar was at the bottom.***

Who says you can't get lunch for under $10?  And as an added BONUS, post-meal, I didn't \"make my own soft serve\" that looked similar to the dishes that I ate...if you get the drift!!!"}
{"text":"My favorites:
Fish pakora
Chola Bhatura 
Parathas
Meat Thali ($$$ worth)

This place for me is my go to for my Desi food cravings. I highly recommend this place. Please do give it a try."}
{"text":"We stopped by about 40 min before the restaurant was about to close. It was somewhat unpleasant sitting next to tables with chairs stacked on top of them. That was a minor complaint though. My biggest gripe with this place is the quality of food and ingredients. I'd rate the food at about 5/10. In other words, I was quite disappointed in the quality of food. My stomach was a little upset after I'd left the restaurant and all I could think of was a cup of Oolong green tea to help with digestion.

I've tried much better and tastier Thalis for the same price. In the GTA. Rajdhani Sweets & Restaurant located at 2658 Islington Ave in Etobicoke is one such alternative.

All in all, I won't be back at this restaurant, even despite friendly and courteous staff. Sorry, guys, but you disappointed me."}
{"text":"Quick, Cheap and Tasty!!! Forget about fine dining, but if you are about delicious food.. you need to visit Punjabi Dhaba when anywhere near Toronto Pearson. You can order from menu (classic Indian items) or just order a Thali lunch/dinner and choose from daily dishes. A Veg thali would run you about $6 and comes with 3 curry items, salad, rice and naan/roti.

Been here a few times now and every time the food taste hits a home run. Feels like eating back home, all they need is a charpai (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charpai) to give a true dhaba feel :)

MUST TRY! Sarson ka Saag - made with mustard greens."}
