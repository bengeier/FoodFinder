{"text":"this place is all looks but other than that, it's a real let down. food is merely mediocre, service is pretty terrible and they don't take debit which is a real pain in the ass (they do this by the way because they're too cheap to pay for the payment processing fees associated with debit cards, and would rather place a huge inconvenience on customers by just pointing them to the ATMS they have on site so they can reap the $3 fee you have to pay to use the ATM machine) Total BS. 

Also, poor management. I ordered a milkshake to go after my meal today, watched it being made, but just sat on the bar for ages while servers and the manager on duty kept walking by and looking at it until I went to the bar and grabbed it myself. Completely sub par for a 17th restaurant, but i guess it isn't a change from all the other group 933 restaurants (80th and ivy, 1600, 1410) which I haven't been a fan of, either. 

Won't be coming back again. And really, Roosevelt, get with the times, stop ripping off your customers, and get a freaking debit machine."}
{"text":"My buddy and I went to Roosevelt to watch the hockey game, grab dinner and drinks. The food was great, the drinks were cold and the service was fast a friendly. Our server, Savannah (I think that was her name anyways)  was awesome. She made sure we were always beer in hand. I would recommend Roosevelt to anyone looking to head oit on 17th."}
{"text":"This place did the job. I was hungry for brunch, and wanted to be outside, so this is where I suggested a group,of us meet last Sunday morning. I ordered the roast chicken skillet. It came with some tasty hash browns. The skillet itself was good, thought a bit salty. My friend was on her wedding diet and the staff gladly accepted her dietary substitutions. The service was adequate, the girls had to be asked a few times for waters we wanted and coffee but were apologetic and prompt at getting us our stuff once asked. It's nice being on a patio and watching the people go by, especially if they have adorable animals with them. I'd come back here every once in a while. How this place is owned by the people who brought Calgary 80th and Ivy I'm not sure. However they made this place a lot more open and inviting than the old Classic Jacks."}
{"text":"We randomly chose this restaurant while walking. What a find. Kassandra our waitress made it 5 stars! She suggested items that were amazing. We had the beef dip, sushi tacos, club house and some really fun beer. Definitely make a trip here."}
{"text":"Very strong service. Steak salad excellent.  Buffalo wings super hot without being particularly meaty or tasty. Good flatbread. Atmosphere is definitely bar/sports bar."}
{"text":"Walked into Roosevelt on a snowy Sunday morning. The service was excellent from the hostess seating us until the end of our meal. I had the frittata and my boyfriend had the ham Bennie. Both were the perfect size for a mid morning meal. Excellent crispy potatos and fresh fruit accompanied our meals..  It's a lot more open and bright than its predecessor, Classic Jack, which frankly was a bit cavernous and dank. I love the bathrooms. Walking into the women's, the wall between it an the men's is see through, so the bathrooms have the sink and dryer in them. . . Don't ask me why, but I love having a sink, hand dryer and mirror to myself. The one and only downside was the music. It was ridiculously loud. . .I could definitely see people not wanting to eat there because of it. It was distracting on an otherwise slow morning. Please Roosevelt, turn it down maybe one or two decibels for your patrons sake and sanity?"}
{"text":"I love love am obsessed with their Nutella milkshake :) U must try it. And they have an amazing Cobb salad with a Huge piece of chicken underneath it :) mmmm"}
{"text":"Overrated. Nice decore but that's not going to get me to go back. Mediocre food (my boyfriends food was cold after sitting at the pass forever - when you have an open kitchen you might want to get the food out once it's at the pass since your customers can see it sitting there). Mediocre service. We were also charged over $20 for pop refills - don't ask me if I want a refill and not tell me it's going to be charged! The waitresses response - its our policy to charge for refills. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"The food is mostly very good and the drink menu features craft brews as well as generic beers and  fine bourbons. The atmosphere, however, is too much like a sports bar for me, with dozens of tv's all showing football and no music.

We ordered the crab & spinach dip and the margherita flatbread to start, blackened chicken and chicken & waffles for our mains. Spinach dip was excellent-you can definitely taste the crab in there. The flatbread was basically a pizza and unimpressive. The chicken & waffles are definitely worth trying, with big bacon pieces in the waffles and super crispy chicken, and the maple butter is to die for. My friend found his chicken a bit dry and we both agree that it'd  be better with the skin."}
{"text":"Terrible service! After ~10 minutes and 3 staff checking on other patio tables we left."}
{"text":"Service was below average, food took awhile although we were well taken care of
Because of that fact. I got some sort of chicken wrap that was good, and we finished with a milk shake and mini donuts which were actually really delicious! Would go back but mostly just because my friend got a gift card for free because the food took so long and came out wrong!"}
{"text":"Food is really good here! I ordered a vegetarian sandwich (can't really remember the exact name of it?) but it was probably the best sandwich I've eaten in my whole life, so surprised at how good it was! Like damn good! Staff was nice too, and I drank a blueberry lemonade cocktail which was also surprisingly incredible. No doubt I would return here in a heart beat!"}
{"text":"Greek chicken wings so tasty I want to invent a new word. Or bust out 'salubrious' even though it makes me sound like a pompous ass and it's not even the right word. Anyways, my buddy brought me there for the wings and I wasn't disappointed. Server was hot and fun. Washroom spotless and aesthetically pleasing, which I'm aware might sound weird but if you go there you'll know what I mean.  All in all a successful visit"}
{"text":"Such a good experience for my superbowl Sunday! Had excellent service for drinks and food from Brittany first and then dragana as well! Will come back :)"}
{"text":"I have to say what a great refreshing addition to 17th Ave 
It's nice to know when you come visit the city there is somewhere people can go for great service, great food, and that Calgarian Hospitality. 
Twice now I have been there and they have made me feel welcome

Great food great price!"}
{"text":"I hadn't been to this location since it was Classic Jack's, so yes, it's been a while!

A few friends suggested a group brunch here because 1) it'd been a while since we'd all gotten together and 2) free mini milkshakes and mini donuts! Upon resos, we were informed there'd be no split bills and a mandatory gratuity applied due to our large group size. Not a surprise, but it was nice to know up front.

Ten of us piled in and our server was taking our drink orders as soon as we settled in. We received this attentive service throughout our brunch, and although it wasn't very busy we didn't feel rushed out at all. 

Food ranged from classic breakfast dishes to burgers and sandwiches, I got the breakfast grilled cheese: bacon sandwiched between provolone and cheddar cheese with a side of hashbrowns and an arugula salad. A well rounded meal, all 4 food groups were covered once I paired it with their #basicsangria lol

It was a pretty decent meal and those milk milkshakes were the perfect size! 

I'd be up for trying Roosevelt again, they've got pretty awesome daily specials and happy hours!"}
{"text":"Nice casual spot on 17th Ave to grab a drink with friends. The best night to go would be on Friday when they have a DJ who plays a great mix of music. I have also been for brunch and lunch. The food is decent, nothing to phone home about but the food service is slow. On the bright side, the free mini donuts at brunch will have you leaving happy."}
{"text":"The restaurant that took over the 10 Street and 17th Ave location gives away little milkshakes with their brunch.

I have been here twice now, once for drinks and pub food and once for brunch. Both times I was pleased with the service, the food and the location.

Roosevelt is nice, the space is very large and they have a decent patio. I would recommend you make a reservation for the patio on hot days in summer, as it does fill up fast. Remember, Roosevelt is located on the 'shady' side of 17th Avenue, so you will get less sun than patio's across the road. But... if you are like my husband, this may be a good thing!

I would go to Roosevelt if people were like, \"let's go to Roosevelt.\" It's a nice place with lots of room, decent food and a nice atmosphere.

T."}
{"text":"We walked by and happened it's wings special day. Wings are dry and small. Worth 25cents no more or less."}
{"text":"We only had the finger food it was good, nothing too special doe what typical finger food. The mini beef bites are good but that's the only other thing that came around to us. We get some wings and nachos. Typical."}
{"text":"I have been here twice now and decided it's my breakfast spot.  Plenty of seating, it's modern, good service and menu.  $10 for bacon & eggs, with potatoes, toast and fresh fruit.  The bacon is double smoked!  To top it off, they give a free milkshake and mini doughnuts!  The serve introduced herself than asked for my name and shook my hand.  She also remembered my name.  The manager came by to see how things were going.  They got my order right and in a reasonable amount of time.  Meal was great.  I'll be back for my Sunday habit."}
{"text":"Have only been here twice but will make it our new place.. The service is very friendly  and the food delicious. I like that they play good music that is current, yet you can still see sports on the many t.v s. We had the happyhour vegetable flat bread... very nice ..and $5! that alone is worth coming back for. Our steak bites and Cobb salad was also very delicious. My husband loved the Belgium beer. The other time we came was when we held my husband's birthday party. They treated us very well and our group had it's own section. No surprises at the end of the night with the bill. I am just very impressed over all and will make more of an effort to come to 17 th so we can eat here more often."}
{"text":"American Diner with a twist.

We had the chance to visit this place at one of the opening events. They served a selection of teasers from their menu. I must admit that we were impressed about the food and the value for the money and can only hope they keep up the quality.

We now need to try this place on a regular day where there is no special attention like at an opening event ;)"}
{"text":"Showed up on a Wednesday night, (there were many open tables / seats), stood at the front with no greeting or any indication as to if the restaurant was self seating or not. Finally decided to seat ourselves and proceeded to sit in our spot for 10 minutes before anyone came to menu or greet us.. only after we had to chase an employee down. And then 3 cocktails took another 15 minutes, just about to leave when they came to the table. Pretty disappointing for a first impression and the people around us seemed to be having the same issues looking for service."}
{"text":"I had brunch at Roosevelt last weekend and was pretty pleased!

First off.. They give you a small complimentary milkshake and bag of mini-donuts on Sunday mornings. What?! DELISH! Anyone who have ever gone to the Stampede grounds with me knows I am a LOCO about those mini-donuts. And now I can get them for FREE when I show up for breakfast on Sunday?!

Sold.

Also, the milkshake was amazing. Chocolatey, and peanut buttery. How do these guys know my favourite things in the world and make it a point to have them ready for me as soon as I sit down? But heck, they got me now.

I had a mushroom eggs benny and my friend had the nutella french toast. Both were great. I did ask for some hot milk for my tea though, and the lady pouring the tea said \"We don't have hot milk, but I can get you cold milk if you want?\" Lol.. does this sound bizarre to anyone else? (Just heat it up, no?....) Anyway, other than that, service was great.

The interior looks a LOT like 80th and Ivy. Except Roosevelt has some very pretty couches along the walls.

I'm totally going back. Their PB milkshake and mini-donut trick worked on me!"}
{"text":"While I've only had drinks here, I was impressed at the level of service at Roosevelt. Maybe they've taken the criticism here to heart, because our waitress was stellar. The clientele on a Sunday on the patio was... well... brotastic, but the ambiance was warm and their Godfathers were on point. 

Also, I loved that the sous-chef came out and elbow-bumped our group of gaping Burger Week maws. 

Minus one star because you don't take debit. Sorry, I'm not sorry, it's all I carry! I'll come back some day though, and try out the sandwich Corey was raving about."}
{"text":"This review is solely based on drinks, I fully intend to come back and try the food. 

I was out with my girls on the weekend and we wanted someone to have some wine and chat. Being the new place in town we popped in area, after a few other unsuccessful adventures. It was about a 10 minute wait which wasn't bad and we were able to go to the bar and get a drink while we waited. 

It looks totally different in there from Classic Jacks, but looks the exact same as 80th, Cibo, Clive, National...you get my point. Can we actually get something new in Calgary

It was so loud there was 4 of us at a table and we couldn't even have a convo. Except for the person right next to you and then you still had to lean in and yell. Which was super annoying. 

Drinks we're reasonable, it was $7.50 for presecco which is decent for sure. We left as we were sick of trying to talk and went elsewhere. I get people want to listen to music, but they also want a convo that is WHAT? HUH? I CAN'T HEAR YOU!"}
{"text":"Good service. Fast on delivery of food. Appetizing ribs and dumplings. Good blacken chicken. Only negative is the music is high."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good here. My biggest complaint was the noise. There was a lot of echoing and it was hard to have a normal conversation. The staff were friendly though. Just not somewhere I would go again unless talking wasn't really on the menu ..."}
{"text":"Everyone: \"Do YOU HAVE TO REVIEW EVERY PLACE YOU GO TO?\"

Me: \"Why yes, well I did. Nowadays I would if it serves my ego.\"

Everyone: \"That makes no sense\"

Exactly, and so does life. It didn't make sense that a popular hotspot like classic jacks would, out of nowhere, shut down and revive itself into this now fancy eatery/nightspot.

Their rice wraps are done well. It a rather large order and needs to be shared, like plate of nachos. The lettuce were crispy and fresh, and the thai stir-fry filling was balanced blend of sweet and sour.

My favourite item here is their godfather. Simple but here it's made smoothly and worth nursing over lengthy conversations. If you feel like skipping dinner and dropping in mid-meal, the godfather will take your attention away from everyone's plates and make you more likeable by default. Because no one likes swatting away someone's fruit-fly hand.

I would recommend this place to friends looking for a place to get their dinner and drink on before heading out to a club. This isn't a high-energy meet market like West or the COmmonwealth and maybe that's a good thing."}
{"text":"I went to The Roosevelt for the first time for a birthday party over the long weekend.  Nice to see Classic Jacks remodeled!  But overall I was slightly underwhelmed - I'm kind of feeling like the open-concept pub has been overdone as of late in Calgary.  I miss having booth seating where you can actually have a normal and somewhat private conversation over drinks.  Atmosphere was so/so - they really need better music though - drop Carly Rae Jepsen and One Direction from your playlist please!

I was in a large group - but regardless found the food service to be very slow, and even slower to actually clear up our tab.  I enjoyed my meal as did everyone else I was with, so I'm sure I will be back.  Just a few improvements new places always need!"}
{"text":"Visited Roosevelt to watch the NFL championship games.  It is a great venue for catching a game - there's TV's everywhere and they even put the sound on!  The brunch was very good - I had the country ham benedict.  The local drafts were on special.  Bonus - we were treated to complimentary \"minis\" and a teeny shake.  All-in-all a great value with very good food and service."}
{"text":"I went last week to kill time before an afternoon meeting. Such a change from Classic Jacks! It felt really open and bright which was fabulous as it was a beautiful March afternoon and I could enjoy the sunshine. I opted for the Vanilla Bean milkshake with a shot of Vanilla Vodka. Delish! 
I also ordered a cheeseburger (which was okay, but in fairness as much as I crave Cheeseburgers, I actually really only kind of enjoy them) and fries. The surprise cup of soup on my platter was magical. A mixture of sweet carrot flavor spiced with ginger was a party in my mouth. I could live off of that soup. 

The staff was fabulous - the hostess especially as she came by and chatted with me quite a bit as I was sitting alone. I will definitely be back -- even if it's just to fix a milkshake craving."}
{"text":"I have spent a bit of time here as an old friend used to manage it - this would be my first time back since she is no longer here - the bartender clearly doesn't want to engage with the customers, he's not rude, just not interested. 

I ordered the Cobb salad and the entire salad was doused in pepper and I wasn't able to eat it.  The chicken tasted like charcoal.  The bartender noticed I wasn't eating it and I nicely told him the issue.  No problem he wanted to fix it, I ordered the pad Thai instead - wow I can't eat it because the garlic purée is so heavy, I just can't  complain twice.  So I've paid my bill...and Linley won't be back unless it's just for drinks. This group needs to get there menu together - have consistency 1410- 80th and Ivy and Roosevelt are just ok - nothing special."}
{"text":"This place got a nice face lift from classic jacks but it's not amazing. The food is average. I'm not a huge fan of an open kitchen at restaurants. This kitchen is completely in the open and you can see cooks talking, filling their cups at the bar, wiping foreheads etc. not that I find this place dirty but I don't want to see that all the time. We came here for brunch one day and I could see the chef put up our food and it sat there and sat there...I knew it was ours, wanted to go get it myself! We get it and it's cold. Bah!"}
{"text":"Was out first stop on a beautiful YYC patio tour! 
Small patio but service was friendly + fast an beer was cold! 
Shared the nachos. Portion was big. Pretty much run of the mill bar nachos. 
I enjoy this spot overall. Will be back!!"}
{"text":"Thought we try the spot out for Mother's Day brunch and it was lovely!  Donuts and Nutella chocolate mini milkshakes every Saturday and Sunday for customers arriving for brunch. 
Some very interesting breakfast options. You have the standard Staples and then some very unique dishes like donuts French toast! Which I highly suggest you try it's not a sweet donut like you would expect it to be but it's got that little hint of sweet. 
Great open concept to this restaurant where you can see the entire kitchen and the shuffling that happens behind the scene making the outing More interactive.   
I might have to plan a re-visit for their taco night's on Wednesdays."}
{"text":"Decided to check out Roosevelt for brunch on Saturday before all the St. Patties madness officially began.

Cute little place definitely similar to 80TH and Ivy which wasn't much of a surprise. Loved the R sign on the wall and the light fixtures. The bathrooms are also a bit trippy when you can see through the glass to where the boys are then everyone goes into their separate little stall/bathroom combo unit. 

They serve complimentary donuts and milkshakes with brunch which is a nice extra treat although after eating that you'd feel silly getting their spa breakfast.

We have three orders of the eggs and bacon and one friend had the Tuna Albacore Sliders. He said the sliders were good and the tuna was done perfectly. We all enjoyed our eggs and bacon, thick cuts of bacon and really good hash browns, crisp on the outside and super soft on the inside with lots of flavor and seasoning. 

Our waitress was really friendly and fast although it wasn't super busy when we were there. She even gave us an extra bag of donuts on our way out because my BF was wearing his Chive shirt. Nice little touch. Good job Roosevelt, we'll be back."}
{"text":"Good place for drinks, brunch is so so but ok. I won't take a family there since the poor waitresses have to wear this almost indecent dresses, but sure it's awesome for the bros... Overall not bad but not the best. Go check it out to do your own opinion."}
{"text":"Solid choice for dinner and drinks.

Brunch is amaze-balls.  Plus at the end of your brunch you get freebies; a little bag of mini donuts and a mini milk shake that is today's feature flavor."}
{"text":"The Mussels are still good. the service was decent, and I couldn't find anything wrong!
They let us make a reservation on Friday night which was very convenient.
I would recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I met my girlfriend here on Friday for a midday bite to eat. I had heard they served excellent milkshakes, and seeing that my friend is pregnant, I thought it would be a good alternative to a typical afternoon of drinks at a pub. 

I was pleasantly surprised when I walked in - it's a big change from the dark, dingy space where Classic Jacks once was. The concept is very open, bright, and inviting. The chairs are uncomfortably hard, though...not a huge issue, just something I noticed. It wasn't very busy so we sat down right away, and I ordered a drink - the waitress returned to tell me that they were out of one of the main ingredients in the drink, and that they took it off the menu entirely. Apparently, the menu is changing and they will be getting new ones next week. Fine, I ordered the Nutella Milkshake and my girlfriend ordered the Strawberry. Both were SO delicious! I also ordered the kale salad, which had an option to add chicken or steak. I opted to go without, although I definitely regretted it. The kale was really well dressed in a citrusy vinaigrette and a parmesan cheese, but the salad itself was boring, uninspired, and lacked creativity. It would have been great with some texture - maybe nuts, fruit - really ANYTHING would have punched it up seeing as how it was just kale and cheese. I definitely could make a better kale salad at home, it was not worth the money. 

Anyway, we were having a nice time visiting and drinking our shakes when the waitress came over and asked if we would mind settling the bill, as she was done for the day. It REALLY annoys me when servers do that, clearly we're not done, and asking us to settle the bill makes us feel like we have to leave. But whatever, we'll pay as we weren't going to order any more anyway. I got out my debit card and she tells me they don't take debit - another thing I hate when restaurants do (so that I'm forced to use your ATM which charges me $5 or pay with my credit card all because you're greedy?). I paid with credit, she brought out the machine and then stood over me the entire time, awkward...she also clearly wasn't happy with the tip I left (which was standard and more than her service warranted since she was awful) and slammed down the receipt without so much as a \"thank you\" or \"have a nice day\". 

The milkshakes were what earned my 3 stars but my meal was not that great and the service was horrible. I probably wont be back, which is a shame given the location and beautiful space. I do like the bathrooms though!"}
{"text":"Roosevelt has become my go-to for weekend brunch. The food is always good and the coffee keeps coming. The last few times I've been in I've had the same sever - Andrea I think? And she is an absolute doll. Love coming here."}
{"text":"Well I don't think I'm ever coming back here. The service was horrific. I cannot believe the attitude of the server. Flat out rude to us the entire night and rolled her eyes when we tried to order food. We asked once if they served pitcher's of anything as we had a large table - her response \"uhhh no.\" seriously? Unfortunately because we ewre a larger table it was an automatic 18% tip which made me even more unhappy. I don't love rewarding people that treat you like that.... it just isn't right!"}
{"text":"Came for brunch. Place is nice but food just so so, fish and chips the batter is too thick and soggy.. Disappointed"}
{"text":"We hit up 17th avenue with the intentions of going to Cibo for brunch, only to discover they only offer brunch in the summer.  We saw Roosevelt when we walked out and figured they would have a brunch menu for the weekend.  It was Saturday around noon and it wasn't too busy for the brunch hour, the layout is very spacious and simple.  We got seated at a high top table and handed brunch menus. Alex and Liz got a mimosa while Kim and I just got water.  The menu is a typical brunch menu with some benedict, signatures, omelettes and French toast options.  Us ladies went with the classic benedict and Alex went with the Roast chicken cast iron frittata.  After we ordered, our waitress came by with two little bags of mini donuts for us to snack on while we wait - sweet deal!  They're not as good as the stampede mini donuts but they kept us busy.  

Our food arrived in good time - the benedicts came on a long plate with a side of crispy hash browns, ketchup and seasonal fruit.  Alex's frittata was a mix of tomato, spinach, green onion, and fontina, also with a side of hash browns and fruit.  As we were digging in, our waitress came by with cute little vanilla coke milkshakes for us to sample - super sweet deal!  The bennies were nothing out of the ordinary but still tasty, the hash browns were nice and crispy and the seasonal fruit didn't see that fresh.  Alex enjoyed his frittata with ketchup and ate it all up.  

I found that after we received our meals, our waitress kind of disappeared, we had to wave her down for refills but overall it was decent.  The food was good and the service was good when it was there.  Brunch is served on the weekends and holiday Mondays from 10am to 2pm.  The mini donuts and milkshakes were a part of the brunch deal which is cool.

I'll definitely stop by again to try things other than the brunch menu because they looked delicious.  For an inexpensive good brunch without having to wait in a line, Roosevelt is the place to be."}
{"text":"In house made sushi cones are spankin delicious ! They make the candied salmon from scratch and man is it tasty. Order one kind or mix and match for a flavor delight"}
{"text":"I'll admit, I'm biased towards roosevelt since I go there at least once a week.

If you ever feel like watching a sports game then this is the place to go, there are numerous screens to watch whatever game it is you're interested in. 

The food here is surprisingly good for what I'd describe as \"bar food\".

Staff here is super nice unless it's a  thursday night (wing night), by then it gets very busy and wait times can sometimes be longer than usual. They still do a pretty good job of taking care of you. 

All in all a pretty solid place to go if you're looking to chill with some friends and drink some beer. 

Prices are alright.. restrooms are almost always clean (except on thursday nights). 

What more do you want?"}
{"text":"Roosevelt is the newest gem in the Group933, namely 1410, 1600 and 80th & Ivy.  Hmm... just noticed, it's also the first one that doesn't have a number of some sort in it's name.

Well, regardless of that, I had heard that they had burgers and shakes, and in fact celebrate it to the best of their ability.    While maybe not declared to be a Gastro-Pub, it very much follows that trend with some good, basic bar favorite foods, but brought to a new level.  

I've tried the Big Ass Burger, a havarti, smoked brisket, beer battered onion rings, house mustard and ketchup on 8 oz of sterling silver beef patty with an awesome soup and salad (or fries if you want).  Paired with it, a Nutella milkshake, an uberthick vanilla bean ice cream, nutella and toasted hazelnuts milkshake that made me turn various shades of blue while trying to slurp it.  Ye gods... that was a tough one to drink, and even after an HOUR of straining on it, it was still THAT thick!  What can I say?  It's was a pretty fricken' decent burger, done medium rare perfectly, juicy throughout, and incredibly messy.  Also, considering all of the toppings, they well complimented the burger and didn't overwhelm the great meat.  

There's daily specials every day (I recommend going there on Tuesdays when all of the burger platters are only $12) in both drinks and food.  There's a few interesting other alternatives to burgers, like Indonesian noodles, classic Fish and Chips and tons of specialized salads.  There's even a $12 daily lunch sandwich special with sides, dessert and coffee or tea.  I wonder how's their smoked meat personally, and might just drop by next Monday in fact (being the special sandwich that day).

It's at night is when this place seems to come alive from trendy lunch spot to happening nightclub and bar.  While I'm not the club person these days (or ever really), I've seen the place packed every night complete with lights and beautiful people.  Sounds like a great start!

{"text":"Sooooo.. Classic Jacks got a great upgrade...but it's still a diner - but a great one.

Located on 17th Avenue in the old Classic jacks location, The Roosevelt is a new place that I literally stumbled upon when another place was too full for me (sad face). First step was to check the outside menu - decent pricing: Check, decent food: Check, seating available on a Saturday: Check! 

The inside is pretty cool. Its a similar style to many new restaurants in that its open, and relatively simple/warehouse but comfortable at the same time. One wall is the wide open kitchen (love it) and the other side is the bar area. For the hockey enthusiasts - TV's were on an opposing side as well. We were greeted by a pretty girl with long dark hair (irrelevant info).

We were seated quickly and asked if we had been here before. As we had not the waitress took the time to explain that everything is made in house and sourced locally (a big trend In YYC that I am a big fan of). \"Even the mustard and ketchup are made in house\", she continues to say. Along with the regular menu she provided a menu of about five \"New York Deli Sandwiches\" which were 12$ including a side - very affordable. 

We ordered some beers (German imports - fantastic) and perused the menu. Looks like we got some decent appys, a burger menu that looks good, more sandwiches, and a milkshake menu (one has nutella - oh boy). There were some pizzas and a section with a couple of noodle and Asian dishes, fish and chips, etc. \"Odds and Ends\" as they called it. 

I ordered the grilled vegetable sandwich with side salad (and it also comes with a soup). My partner in eating crime ordered the haddock and chips with homemade tartar sauce (a milkshake was tempting). No too long later the meal arrived, and impressive it was. The fish and chips were three large pieces of fish and a basket of fries that were soooo hot and delicious. The fish was some of the best I have had to be honest. The batter was flaky and light and the fish was fresh, and hot and flaky and perfect. We mentioned to the waitress how good it was and she said it was the head chefs \"family recipe\". I was in the wrong family growing up apparently. My veggie sandwich (wait for it as you are not going to believe me) was absolutely unbelievable. I DO NOT KNOW what they did, but it's one of the best things I have eaten. It was sliced butternut squash (yes, sliced thin squash), arugula, fig jam (this might have been the secret), grilled onions and brie on a really good ciabatta. I was literally thankful to be a vegetarian at this point in my life. Served with the sandwich from heaven was a mug of squash and roasted onion soup (very tasty) and a really great side salad with a lot of ingredients and flavor. Overall, a fantastic \"diner\" meal for a hungry vegetarian. 

Turns out - we were pleasantly surprised. Service was impeccable. I wish I knew her name, but she was really, really great. Food was hot, fresh, tasty and pretty delicious. Price point was also impressive - 13$ for a well crafted sandwich/soup and salad - so awesome, and the fish was 15$ for a large serving. 

Definitely will go back! The burgers (for meatatarians) come out with two massive onion rings on them (that they hand batter on ordering), with a huge patty. The salads were massive and the pizzas looked really good (thin crust). I'll wanna try the nutella shake next time and well, maybe the same sandwich again (I need a redo).

Give it a go on a Friday for after work drinks and supper - then stay for more drinks:)"}
