{"text":"Saw the yelp review and since close to our motel we gave it a try.
It is great. Had the wedding soup and corned beef sandwich.
So many chips we had to take them to motel."}
{"text":"Loved this place great pub food and good beer selection. The soup of the day was good and the burger one of the best."}
{"text":"Excellent Schmidt's Deluxe 1/2 LB burger and homemade chips. Close to the airport and easy homey place with friendly staff and locals."}
{"text":"Great place!  Friendly staff behind the bar.  Good food, great prices, and great mom & pop style."}
{"text":"Schmidt's Tavern is awesome!  I've been there several times and have had great experiences.  The food is standard 'bar food', but their burger is MASSIVE and delicious.  They have at least 3 different types of french fries, which are all good, and French Onion soup that is to die for!  I recommend stopping by this 'hole in the wall' restaurant and bar for a good, inexpensive meal with pleasant servers and an ever-present owner that is happy to walk around and meet his customers.  5 stars to Schmidt's!!"}
{"text":"Best burger I've had in a long time, if I lived here this would be my go-to-spot for good food, good brews, and good people. 

If your stuck in a hotel outside the PIT airport, make your way here and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great food thus far...dined in twice and take out twice (Italian hoagie, cheeseburger, fries and wings). I highly recommend Cajun Dry rub (crispy) with a side of hot sauce and blue cheese dressing (add your own Stilton/Blue to theirs). I feel as they have the best Wings in the Pittsburgh area, good cheeseburgers along with good service and very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Phenomenal.... I had the \"small\" fried cod sandwich and wasn't going to eat the whole thing...but just couldn't help myself. Hand cut fries and some of the best cole slaw I've had. Great little dive bar..."}
{"text":"Small hole in the wall bar, friendly staff with great fish sandwiches.  They also have wings and other food.  Very casual, highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"I have been traveling back and forth to the area since early March and we have tried just about everywhere to eat.    

Sitting at the hotel and I asked my co-workers if we can try that little place down the street that looks like a house, because the reviews weren't too bad.... and here we ended up.

It looks like a little house with  parking directly off the street that spreads out on each side of the house.  I tried not to feel guilty as I watched a ton of joggers across the street running up and down the tree-lined path... and proceeded inside.

Small is an understatement.  Maybe 4-5 tables and a tiny bar with about 8-or so bar stools.  I was surprised by not deterred.  Super, super friendly service.   We assumed the menu would sport a bunch of fried food.  But there was some nice choices.  My friend had the French onion soup and said it was really good, like other reviewers stated. Another friend had wings and said that they get a thumbs up as well.  I got the French dip... curly fries... thumbs up from me as well. 

Since this is close to the hotel, I would venture out here again :)   Nice little spot."}
{"text":"They have a killer fish sandwich that I swear they make out of a whale, it is that huge. Also great burger also huge but a heart attack on a plate.  Other than that it is a bit of a dive, your typical bar."}
{"text":"Great staff and great food. We heard about the fish and burgers being good but we tried the wings. Everything we seen come out of the kitchen looked great and the wings were awesome. The waitress knew the answers to our many questions and was as friendly as you could ever ask for. We sat on the porch for a few minutes before we left and the owner had a good chat with us too. We can't wait to go back and my wife loved their homemade blue cheese as well as her wings. Beers were reasonable and the food was great, what else do you need ?"}
{"text":"Averages prices for average beer. 4 tall beers and 20 or so on bottle. Multiple large TV's to watch the big games. Went by myself and met some nice country locals, who bought me a beer for being new to the area. Very low key bar, karaoke on Saturday nights. Didn't get the food, so couldn't say how it was, but the food selection was average."}
{"text":"Waitress was outstanding.   Food was excellent.   Homemade chips are the best we've ever eaten.  Price was extremely reasonable."}
{"text":"If you know anything about me, you know I love obscure, out of the way hole-in-the-walls. I've driven past this mom and pop half a dozen times, and today, I decided to stop! It may be small, and the parking my be poor (look both ways multiple times before pulling out of the parking lot), but boy is the food worth it!

I tried their lunch special, small fish sandwich w/ coal slaw and fries. Special it was! Aside from the fries, everything was awesome! I am a fan of the slaw and this was by far the best I've ever had. Calling the sandwich small is like calling little John little... seriously, it was enough fish to actually fill up a foot long hoagie.

So, if you are a fan of large portions, good quality, and reasonable prices, be sure and take the time to drive off of the beaten path and pay this place a visit.

PS. Did I mention it is a bar... so yeah, the booze are good too... ;-)"}
{"text":"Outstanding service and food. It's a strange hole on the wall but will be back a few times while visiting town."}
{"text":"This is by far the most mom and pops place that I've ever been to with the food receiving the attention you will expect made from somebody in their homes kitchen and a very generous amount to boot.....!"}
{"text":"Got a beer and food. Food portions can feed two and were ok. Played jukebox and cook came out cause he never heard it. Don't think it's a place for music nightlife. Good neighborhood bar. Tab was the same as Tilted Kilt without the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Accidental find while meeting family near the airport. The fish sandwich is amazing. The Reuben as well. Located along a bike-hike trail. Around the corner from a trail head. Not a kid friendly destination; but good food at a very friendly price."}
{"text":"It was alright. The soup and service was great, cant go wrong with mash n gravy, the meat was a bit on the prepackaged sandwich side, but at $10 a main, no complaints. I shouldve had the wings, thats what theyre famous for!"}
{"text":"I was in the mood to try a new place for lunch today and I decided to welcome myself into this gem. I wasn't disappointed in my decision, walked in, took a seat, and was immediately waited on by the waitress/bartender. It helped that we went in past lunch time rush.
Lunch consisted of the small fish sandwich with french fries and coleslaw that was on special. For 9.50, you definitely get what you pay for, no skimping on anything. The fish, fries, and coleslaw were very fresh and you can immediately taste the real difference because of it!
The ambiance of the bar area felt very dark, but what bar doesn't? So yeah, this place could use some better lighting and upbeat atmosphere, but if that doesn't bother you, go here for some good food."}
