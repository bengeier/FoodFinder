{"text":"The best Pakistani food restaurant with authentic flavours.  We ordered Haleem,  Nihari, chicken Malai Tikka and bihari boti. Every thing was excellent with good serving size. Naan were fresh right from the oven and the service was also excellent and fast. We ended this amazing food experience with Kheer which too was a treat. SHAMIANA restaurant has become my favorite Desi food restaurant now."}
{"text":"This restaurant is new give it a try won't regret it!!"}
{"text":"Delicious nihari and BBQ! The place is not that nice of a sit down which is why I only gave it 3 stars. But the food is great! The Kashmiri chai is also not be missed. Just be sure to ask for more tea and a little less milk since they tend to put too much milk for my liking. The service here is amazing!!"}
{"text":"This nine month old restaurant has created a permanent place in my palette and stomach. The food is simply fantastic- cooked with lots of care and love. Service is pleasent and care giving. Prices are just right. Next door Silverspoon may be a great place for takeaway but this 65 seater dine-in restaurant cannot be ignored. Don't miss out.  https://www.tripadvisor.ca/ShowUserReviews-g154996-d12909895-r526850996-Halal_Shamiana-Mississauga_Ontario.html#"}
{"text":"Totally disappointed with them on my last evening visit .. the only thing I've given them 1 stars is for their fresh breads .. they seem to have forgotten to cook completely .. the nihari was a mess, and I had given this place top ranking when it started initially. The BBQ was completely dried out, and wraps were just sauce and may be a piece here n there of chicken. It was rush hours on a weekend, and never thought this place will kill the cuisine themselves."}
{"text":"STAY AWAY... the owner who is also the \"chef\" is serving stale and pre cooked food from past few days. We ordered a biryani and karahi gosht and they both were stale. For biryani we were given the bottom crust of rice which tasted nasty. We sent it back and the owner started to speak in his language to his worker saying \"you should tell them we don't take food back, if they need fresh biryani tell them it takes 2 hours to make I can't make fresh biryani for everyone\". He thought we didn't understand but he was pretty loud. The girl at the front cashier alimony has no voice of her own anything you ask Her besides ordering food she will ask the owner which made us think why is she even working there if she has to bug the owner for every small thing and pick up a paycheck. It was definitely a weird place. The karahi gosht got my wife and I literally sick. We went back home and had a upset stomach for 4 days and finally recovering now.   He takes credit cards but says only cash or debit so he doesn't have to show cash to the government for taxes. His fellow restaurant owners follow the same this cash/debit scam.  Watch out and save your stomach!"}
{"text":"BBQ platter with 3 naan and 2 pop for 29.99. Not at all bad. Chicken malai boti was the best, kabab were also moist.they have the best brain masala and its not as spicy as BBQ tonight. Sitting area is ordinary but food makes up to that.  The waitress was really curtious and took good care of us. Highly recommended for Pakistani food.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"So far my review is related to the samosa chaat (4.5/5) and peshawari chapli kabab (5/5 - my parents). Oh man both were amazing! In regard to the samosa chaat, the size was generous, the quality was great, and the price was very reasonable ($3.99). I unfortunately did not try the kabab myself, however it was met with nothing but praise from my parents!   Moreover... what made me really unhappy was that my sister placed an order for pick up 30 minutes in advance, and even though there was no line up, we had to wait an additional 5 minutes upon arrival. I suppose compared to the overall experience this was negligible - albeit I hope this does not become a frequent thing.   Nonetheless, I will definitely drop by again to try other items on the menu! Thumbs up for the great food!"}
{"text":"Best Indian Restaurant in ssauga!!  Small place but amazing food. Had the meat platter shared with two other friends...wow wow wow the taste and smell was sooooo delicious. Price was reasonable and service was great and welcoming. Would recommend all my friends to check out this place . Will go back atleast once or twice a month."}
{"text":"My favourite pakistani restaurant in Mississauga. Amazing nihari, great bbq. Server is also very helpful and friendly.  Update: I do not recommend the biryani. Had to take a star down - the biryani was quite disappointing."}
