{"text":"Excellent tea, great service! Cozy atmosphere, clean and indirect lighting give it ambiance. The decor is quasi-Moroccan/Turkish, with little alcoves for groups to sit. Extensive tea list, if you like tea this is THE place to go!"}
{"text":"Great place for tea! I was skeptical when it first opened next to several other successful coffee/tea shops, but I thought I'd give it a try! I was very pleasantly surprised with the great varieties of tea. The staff was very knowledgeable and eager to help me make a decision. They keep a little book about the different teas you can order, and I learned a lot by reading through it. That was pretty cool. They really want you to enjoy tea, not just spend your money, which is really nice.  I liked the variety of places to sit as well. Good for groups, where you can sit on fun little seat things in a booth type area, or good to just grab a little solo table by yourself or with a date. The employees give you a little bell to ring if you need something, so otherwise you're left to yourself, which is kind of nice! I wouldn't say the atmosphere is \"cozy,\" but it is pretty quiet!  I've never been on an \"event\" type of night, but I would love to stop in when they are having belly dancing!  The only thing I have to say is that when I have gone, it's been relatively dark. In my experience, it's not a great place to go and read a book since the lighting is dimmer."}
{"text":"Overpriced, awkward AND TERRIBLE SERVICE.  I was invited here on a first date. My date arrived before me and chose a cubby to sit in - which meant we had to sit on the floor. He was comfortable with this, but I wasn't. I was not dressed for sitting on the floor, I was dressed for a date. If I had known I was going to have to sit on the floor I would have stayed at home to play with my pets. Having to be on the floor in tight jeans and a shirt that given my now hunched over position only served to highlight my normally passable muffin top took me from \"hot and fun\" to \"chubby and uncomfortable\".   The menu is 64 pages long, the first 40-ish pages are in the $25 rage. I was shocked. But given my current situation, I was in no position to point out the short-comings of the menu.  My date pointed out the Specialties section and I selected the Scent of Jerusalem tea ($4.50). You ring a little bell on your table to get the service staff to come to your table. You know, like you're a entitled snot in a British drama. Our hipster - sorry waiter - arrived in his own time. 30 minutes after ordering we finally got our tea. I'm not kidding, 30 minutes! It's tea, not a meal - and even a meal is served faster in a restaurant. And that goes for Applebee's and Butcher in the Rye, alike.  We each got a pot and a cup on a little platter. The waiter, reached over me, poured my male date's tea and then walked away. Apparently my date had his own personal valet and I, the unworthy, muffin-topped, homunculus was left to my own devices.  You want sugar and milk? Too bad. None was offered. Again- when you wait 30 minutes for tea, you hardly ask for more.   Had they not taken half an hour to make 2 pots of tea, I might have ordered a piece of baklava just to see how much filo dough and honey I could have dropped on my shirt and lap.  Never again."}
{"text":"Ok. Went there with my date and we ordered 2 teas and baklava. Will just say take this place with grain of salt.."}
{"text":"I am completely obsessed with this cozy tea haven! Dobra has a good hundred options of teas to choose from and the staff is consistently helpful and nice. Additionally, the vibe is very relaxing and warm, and totally different than any other coffee shop in the Pittsburgh area. I love the music they play as well.  Definitely worth trying the Chai Chai Chai (traditional Indian tea) or the Tulsi tea. Don't miss the hummus that they offer from Greek Gourmet, either."}
{"text":"Love this place! If you are a tea lover, you need to come here. For someone who's been to China and India, and lived in the UK, I'm very picky about my tea. You can choose the region, the varietal, the potency, etc. The super friendly staff is knowledgeable and they truly want you to enjoy your tea (they won't try to upsell you or anything like that).   The Gong Fu Cha is an awesome experience if you've never had a traditional tea ceremony. The chai and the masala tea are both amazing if you're into that kind of flavor.  The selection of Pu'er is incredible, and if you're someone who is really into Chinese tea, you will appreciate it. It's fermented and has all sorts of healthy qualities, plus it is really earthly and just delicious.  The redbean desert is a perfect little sweet to end the meal. This place is the best, I'm here at least once a week, nothing more I can say but it's my favorite place in da burgh.  Also, don't be that person on your cell phone for 20 mins, this is a tea shop not starbucks!"}
{"text":"Well.... if you have a 'no food' policy please tell about it nicely. trying to scare me with shouting words 'we will kick you out and you may never come back' are not a part of a nice customer service. By the way, small piece of food was brought from festival on Murray and was never eaten inside your store. Educate your waiters about customer service."}
{"text":"A tea lovers dream. The atmosphere is perfect for studying or chatting with a friend.   The chai is amazing!  I just hope they have mochi in stock soon!!! XD"}
{"text":"This is quickly becoming my favorite place to study in Sq Hill. The atmosphere is really relaxing, and you have a nice amount of privacy that you don't get at other coffee/tea shops. The tea selection is epic, and the staff are really nice and attentive.  A little bit pricey,  but worth it for the experience"}
{"text":"Convenient venue for meetings, gatherings, book clubs, etc, because the numerous half-open/half-separate rooms provide for focus as well as creativity. Hundreds of teas, each delicious and unique. Traditional tea service available. The seating is a treat, with a selection of chairs, benches, cushions, and loveseats. Pleasant music that doesn't distract me from a task. For just a few bucks, I can drink special and expertly brewed tea for hours. And the staff is always adorable, very nice, and competent."}
{"text":"Finally had the opportunity to stop in Dobra today.   The first thing I noticed was the space was a bit cramped. There was a college student sitting at the table by the window with all his stuff sprawled across the floor which didn't help matters, but still, several people checked out as I waited for my to go order and there really seemed to be no good place to stand and wait.  My second thought was 'holy hell, where do I begin?' Lol. Seriously, I'm a pretty serious tea drinker, or at least I used to believe that, but Dobras selection was absolutely overwhelming. So, so, so many delicious options! Wasn't sure where to begin so I asked about my decaf options....again overwhelmed lol. My server began going over the list and asking me questions about my tastes when I mentioned my belly was bothering me. 'Oh we have just the thing for that!' I said 'great, do it up.' Needless to say I left with a delicious cup of tea, that as advertised, settled my stomach down.  Long story short: huge selection, quality product, good price and helpful staff. I just wish this was a little closer to my office, something tells me I'll be taking more long lunches to Sq Hill just to stop for a good cup of tea."}
{"text":"I went to Dobra tea with my grandma and cousin. There was one other couple in the whole place, and two people working. It took them over 20 minutes to make 3 hot chocolates. By the time we got them, one was cold, one was warm, and one was hot...."}
{"text":"This place is best to hang out with friends and play some board games. Amazing selection of tea. I took minimum 5 mins to choose from menu and I loved the Indian snacks it tastes so very authentic. One of the coolest and best place to hang out."}
{"text":"Hands down the best place for tea in Pittsburgh. Great atmosphere, wonderful variety of teas with a friendly knowledgeable staff. It's the perfect escape from the cold!"}
{"text":"Chill place for tea. Brought some friends here and they were very impressed. I really liked the masala tea"}
{"text":"Go.  Now.  Go to Dobra Tea.  Don't read any more reviews.  Just go there.  The fact that you're sitting somewhere else and not at Dobra Tea right now means you're going to feel like an idiot for not going sooner when you get there.  It's obvious the owners and staff really care about the environment and their craft, and I don't think I've ever witnessed that at any other establishment anywhere.   It's not just tea, it's an experience.  I felt like an Arabian princess.  I was astounded by the details (the Dobra Tea logo on the mugs and pots, the carpet nailed to the walls with a space cut out for an outlet, etc).  It smells pleasant, the music is really soothing, it's perfect if you need to find some peace and quiet to just chill or if you want to get some work done.  The only criticism I have is that the table had wet spots on it (probably from being recently cleaned) and I was a little surprised that we didn't receive more than a couple cocktail napkins-- we ordered crystallized ginger, 2 teas, 3 cookies, & the hummus plate, so I feel a few more napkins would've been smart, but it really wasn't a big deal, and I was too mesmerized by the place so I neglected to ask any of the two servers who handled us.  Again, I've never been somewhere before where the passion for the art of the product has been so abundant and the attitude of the staff has been so gracious.  I was blown away.  If I lived closer, I would be there every day.   Read about the origins of the place on the first page of the menu!  This location is only the FIFTH in the United States!  How lucky are we, Pittsburgh?!??"}
{"text":"I discovered this place thanks to Yelp and after vicariously experiencing it through Yelp finally made it there to form my own opinions!    The ambiance is wonderful.  There are many cozy nooks with pillows and platforms where one can recline for a nice chat.  The music was extremely worldly but not identifiable as any one culture (Radio Tarifa) which I feel is the vibe they are going for in general.  The tea menu comes in a 60 page binder, I kid you not.  It can be hard to choose from all of the options!  The main downside is the price ($6 for a cup of tea seems a bit much.)  I realize some of the offerings may be exotic and for the proper tea connoisseur this may be no big deal, but the price is the main factor that will prevent me from coming too often."}
{"text":"Talk about relaxing! Such a great place to meet a friend. First date. I am a tea person so the extensive tea menu is right up my alley. I had the baba ganoush and snuck some wonderful olives off my companion's dobra plate. Delish! For desert, baklava and a chocolate medicine ball. I will return often."}
{"text":"The dull white guy that took our order (happens to be the owner apparently) was undeniably rude the way he took our orders because my 3 year old son wanted his attention to order something. Next he tells us not to ring the small bell ever again (ever heard of saying pls?) and then he pretty much made two of our Chai extra light instead of extra strong! Shame how manners, ethics and hospitality is lost on some people. Must be a racist Trump  supporting fan! He should learn something from the other black guy who had some decency at the least.  Update - In reply to Nathaniel P. (Dobra Employee in defense of my review above). Our son did not scream at your owner/jerk who was taking our order. He's a liar beside a racist clearly. We were 6 adults present (we all feel the same way and i'll have them write their review here as well now) with our 3 year old who said \"Excuse me, can i have this (pointing at the menu) when your guy rolled his eyes and completely ignored him. And that little bell is so small it should not have bothered anyone to begin with! And he came way late anyway just to tell us \"Don't do it again\". Own what happened and try to be better to your customers in the future. You guys have a beautiful place minus the adequate manners and decency."}
{"text":"This is a really nice place to have a chat with friends or to just chill and work or to just chill and drink some exotic tea and pretend to work. Either way, the atmosphere inside is almost Zen like and nobody inside seem to be in any rush. And that can be a good thing sometimes. The menu with the list of teas is not a menu, it's a book. No kidding, it's a book with contents with page numbers at the start. I have probably explored only 5% of the teas here and I would say about 95% of them were good. They have light snacks too, but don't count on making a meal out of it."}
{"text":"Wonderful, the kind of place you need to fix a bad day, or simply enjoy some introspective time"}
{"text":"Visited Dobra for the first time today to get some work done with a friend. The atmosphere is really quaint and unique - you totally forget that you're in Pittsburgh once you step in! They have various types of seating as well.  You can opt for regular tables and chairs or sit on the floor with low tables with dividers to ensure privacy.   We got the brown rice+matcha tea in a pot. I loved how rich the tea was and the fact hat they allow free hot water refills is a plus!   Overall, it's a GREAT place to catch up with a friend, do work, or just for a quiet escape (: will definitely come back to try their wide array of tea!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful place to hang out or to cozy in and study - I just wish it was an option to make a reservation!"}
{"text":"I've been to Dobra half a dozen times. It's consistently good in terms of tea variety and quality, service and atmosphere. Their menu has dozens of choices from Asia, Africa and around the world, as well as a good selection of small bites. Servers are knowledgeable about what they serve too. I like the small bells they give you to call servers when you're ready to order. Cushioned benches in alcoves are nice, and seating arrangement is good for conversation in small groups. This is a great place to go to pass a relaxing  hour with friends."}
{"text":"I am no expert, so i needed help deciding since there is a whole binder of teas. It was a very relaxing, and calm atmosphere. The only negative I'd say is that they use bells to call over the hosts, which I find degrading to them. I feel like I am calling a dog. It may be just me, but I feel like I am putting someone down. Anyways, its great, and would visit again!"}
{"text":"Big selection of all sorts of tea! Good selection of snacks! Cute sitting area! Our favorite tea is the Moroccan mint tea. Baba ganoosh plate is pretty good for light dinner/lunch. For sweets, we have had baklava, French meringue, dried fruits, all pretty good."}
{"text":"Rude service, I ordered hot chocolate and it took 20 minutes to arrive, and when it did, the server had his thumb on the lip of the mug. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"I have been going here for years with my mom and this is definitely the place to kick back and open up your laptop to study, or even just get away. Favorite drink: The Bees Knees"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places!! The tea list is awesome. It's my husband and Is new weekly relaxation after work to get tea. Every tea I have tried has been amazing, the stout iced teas are delicious, and we usually get the hummus plate as a snack! I would recommend this place to anyone :)"}
{"text":"Man, I wish I actually lived in Pittsburgh. This would easily be a go-to place, good for anything from lazy conversations with friends, to a focused work-day on my laptop, to an afternoon with a book. Cozy atmosphere with colorful tapestries and pillows.  The people who work here know about their tea, and I KNOW they know about their tea, because I've been a tea enthusiast pretty much since I was born. The selection is huge, enough to keep even tea connoisseurs coming back repeatedly.  Another great feature: the tea itself is steeped in a small cup, but you're provided with a pitcher of boiling water that is kept hot over a candle. Good for steeping and resteeping over a couple hours.  A great find!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots in the city. Their tea is great, and it's such a relaxing atmosphere. I would love to have a group of friends here to just hang out and talk in one of the spaces where you sit on the floor (don't forget to take your shoes off!). It's very intimate. I also love their babaganoush. I don't know where they get it, but I can't find it nearly as good anywhere else."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite place!!!   My friends and I went to Dobra for my friend's birthday. And let me say...they have a wide selection of teas and food. I had the Wu Long Cha(Oolong tea) and it was the best I tea I have ever tried. We also got the baklava, hummus plate, baba ghanoush plate, and the donut to share. Everything was very tasty and had great seasoning.    The ambience had a bohemian-style to it, and it felt very calming and relaxing. Moreover, it was very spacious and had some semi-private areas, if you want to have a good conversation, like we did.        Sorry this is not a long review, my mind is still happy that we went there and I can't process a lot right now."}
{"text":"Such a relaxing environment! Friendly staff and I love my experience here each and every time. And, their tea selection is magnificent. There is always something new to try. Great place to meet friends for snacks and tea. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This place is amazing - a very large selection of teas, polite service, and comfortable / chill atmosphere. Great place to read a book. Wish I lived in Pittsburgh so I could come here more often!"}
{"text":"I had a meet-up with a friend of mine to discuss health and books. It was my first time their and I couldn't express how wonderful this shop is. I will emphatically suggest that friends go here based on the stellar service, selection and atmosphere.  The sitting areas were enclosed and opening with soft comfortable pillows.   The tea selection was suggested by a gentleman that had a wide knowledge of all the teas and we received our pots of tea quiet quickly.  It's a place I could sit and drink many pots of tea all day discussing a variety of topics with friends and strangers.  The prices were exceptional and I suggest you bike over instead of driving so you can bike through schenley or frick park after a wonderful evening."}
{"text":"Stopped by on a whim, and enjoyed \"The Bee's Knees\" iced tea with lavender, mint, coconut water, and honey. It was sweet and very refreshing. I would come again if I'm in the area. These people know their tea!"}
{"text":"This place has become my favorite spot for tea in Pittsburgh. I haven't found any other place here with the same set up- a true tea house with properly served/brewed tea and the perfect ambience (alcoves where you sit on the floor, sans shoes!).  The tea selection is impressive, if not daunting, but the staff is friendly, quick and offer plenty of advice. Personally I stick with the Japanese green teas and one of the Turkish black coffees. Prices are quite reasonable too. The chai, I've heard, is good but I make it plenty at home so I don't often get it. Make sure to get in one of the alcoves if you want the true experience. Some have plugs and there's free wifi."}
{"text":"They have an amazingly huge selection of teas and all the staff is very nice.   The seating is awesome with the pillows and carpets. I love coming here with my friends every once in a while to chat and hangout."}
{"text":"Dobra has been and continues to be one of my favorite spots in Pittsburgh to unwind either with a friend or alone. Their drinks are delicious and suited for all taste palates. The atmosphere is hip and cool, set by vibrant colors and patterns that decorate the place. Their food is great too although Dobra isn't a place to eat a meal; it's better for appetizers and/or satisfying teas."}
{"text":"Dobra Tea is a unique experience, and everyone should come at least once. From the outside, it looks like any other tea shop, but once you walk in, you will be able to see why it deserves a special mention. There are little rooms spaces, designed like a Japanese tatami room except with carpet instead. There are also table spaces in the case you don't feel like sitting criss-crossed... whichever you feel more comfortable. You are given a tea menu and a bell. You ring the little bell when you're ready to order. The server's really patient and respects your space. The teas are loose leaf teas, and are generally of okay quality--I tried the rolled and roasted oolong teas--but the environment definitely makes up for it. The environment is generally dim (some rooms are brighter than others), so if you come to do work, I'd suggest keeping your work to your laptop. Otherwise, the ambiance makes it also a good place to go to in a casual afternoon date with a friend or significant other.  P.S. If you come during the weekdays, and you can come around lunch time, there is a lunchtime special from 12pm to 2pm of getting a hummus and pita platter with a pot of tea for $12!!! I just missed it... And I decided to get the hummus platter anyway. It's significantly a lot more expensive doing it that way, but worth the experience, right?"}
{"text":"This place has a nice vibe, and we liked that you could get tea to go since we were in a tiny hurry. All of the staff was friendly and nice, and helped us choose something since we were a liiiiittle overwhelmed with choices. We'll be back the next time we're in Squirrel Hill!"}
{"text":"Start with the good. The atmosphere is very nice. A great place to read, study, or hold and intimate business or social meeting. What I don't like about the place is that the owner and employees are tea dilettantes. When I want to try something new when I asked for a recommendation instead of making the recommendation they go into a 15-minute lecture on the different kinds of teas and the values of each it's all a little too much. There are other places for tea in the neighborhood and those are the places I usually end up visiting."}
{"text":"Love this place, my husband and I go there at least once a week for some relaxing tea time."}
{"text":"I heard great reviews about this place and was very excited about coming but when I arrived from a 35 minute drive they claimed to be \"closed\" because they didn't have \"hot water\".This was unusual due to the fact I just wanted ice tea which does not use hot water. Also, the back of the place had customers in it which furthered me and my friends confusion.The person who I tried to talk to on the phone after leaving was also unhelpful and very rude. Very unpleased with this place!!"}
{"text":"This place is simply the best. Quaint, peaceful, and amazing quality of tea. Massive selection for any tea aficionado, sometimes I just like to go here and destress from grad school life."}
{"text":"A wonderful addition to Squirrel Hill.   I went there a few days ago with a party of two. We had three different teas. The staff pays great attention to the details of tea making: they advised us to take a bowl instead of a pot for two of the teas because the water had to be at a particular temperature (different one for each tea) which would be difficult to do in the pot.    Great choice of teas from all over Asia.   The space is also very friendly and comfortable. It feels very relaxing.   Finally, the prices are very reasonable and not at all nasty with your wallet.   Go there folks. Make sure this place thrives."}
{"text":"Can't believe I haven't put down a review for this place yet.  We've been to this place so many times now, we've long lost track. This is a slightly dim, cushioned little tea shop where you can either sit at small round tables with chairs, booth-like fabric cushioned seats with porcelain(?) top tables, or on a carpeted raised dais with round cushions. You walk in, grab menus and a bell on the right, and find a seat, then ring the bell when you're ready to order.  There's a couple of wall sockets near these sitting areas so you can work with a laptop here for a while, especially if it's not the weekends and you don't have to worry about the 2-hour time limit.  We've tried a good percentage of the teas here now, and holy crap are there a bunch of teas to choose from. Some of our favourites include:  Hotcha (hot matcha drink) Chai Chai Chai!!! (delicious chai) Forest Dragon (refreshing cold matcha drink) Gong fu (tea tray, clay teapot, the whole works) Bubble tea (Matcha flavour especially)  There are two comfortably large bathrooms available, which is great if you're guzzling teas like we love to do. Service here has always been friendly and top-notch.  I only wish two things were different: 1) Thai Boba Tea on the menu please! 2) Wish we could bring in our own snacks to accompany the teas. The snacks on the menu are nice, but still limited."}
{"text":"I don't know why I've waited so long to try this place.  You need to drop everything, come here, and relax!  Hurry.    If you're a tea nerd (guilty!) this place is amazing.  They have the largest selection of loose teas of anywhere I've been in the 'burgh.  If you're not a tea nerd, you won't be intimidated.  The menu explains all of the teas, and the service comes with lots of explanation and no judgement.  The pu ehr tea was perfectly set up and explained--how long to steep, how to strain, how to pour, and how many milliliters each drink should be (ok, the last one I made up.)  I'll be a regular here starting immediately."}
{"text":"Dobra Tea is definitely the place to learn about teas. The menu of teas is phenomenal. This is the place to go to learn all about tea. They're beer teas are the best hot weather cold teas."}
{"text":"This place has the best ambience and amazing music. Music is kind of tribal music taking you through a journey of different countries and cultures. Great place to relieve yourself from stress and have some positive vibes !!  They definitely leave you in a dilemma to choose from a ton of varieties of teas from different parts of world with a briefing of the origination of tea and its history. I am definitely coming back here more often as its literally off my street !!"}
{"text":"Love coming here with my kids!  A unique tea experience, tons of great memories here.  It is quiet and sometimes crowded, so my kids need to be in a serene mood for this to be a good fit ;)"}
{"text":"Wow, I had no idea a place like this existed in Pittsburgh! There are so many coffee shops in the city, but only a few tea shops and this one being one of them. It's such a neat concept too. They give you a bell and a menu, you choose a seat and ring the bell when you're ready to order. The menu is HUGE and it's a little overwhelming (for those like me who don't know much about tea), but it includes a description for everything! Me and my group ordered both hot teas and iced teas. The hot teas came out in tea kettles, the staff pour you your first cup and the remainder is for you to pour. The iced tea came out in one glass. The amount of tea they give you, you can tell they want you to stay for a while and relax. My recommendation is to sit as close to the front as possible because in our case, we sat in the way back and the staff could not hear our bell when we were ready to order. If you like tea, this is a great place to learn and try new kinds!"}
{"text":"Wow. How have I not been here before? With all the other coffee shops along Murray and Forbes, I just never made it in here until tonight. Wow, wow, wow. Definitely the chillest hangout spot around. You walk in and are handed a menu and a bell to ring for when you're ready to order. Lolwut? Okay. I mean, I guess I can pretend like I'm living the life of the 0.01%. If you insist.  You then get to choose from an array of seating arrangements, ranging from traditional tables and chairs near the counter to semi-enclosed rooms with gorgeous mosaic coffee tables and cushion-lined seating banks to squat little tables that you can sit cross-legged around. Did I mention you feel transported to another world by the architecture, the sumptuous decorations, the sounds, and the smells? Yep.   I had an herbal Tulsi chai, which did a surprising job of resembling an actual chai. Very nice work. Bravo, yinz. I'll be back the next time I'm in Squirrel Hill."}
{"text":"Dobra is a great place to go if you love tea. The staff there has always been friendly and seems much more knowledgeable about different varieties of tea and how to prepare it when compared to their competitors that I have visited. The interior has a very relaxed feel to it. It's also got a very wide selection and even has the option to create your own blend. The only things I don't like: service can be a bit slow sometimes, it's a bit pricy compared to other options (but keep in mind that it's very good quality), and it feels weird that they make you ring a bell when you're ready to order. Overall, Dobra is definitely worth a visit, and if you're looking for a place to either study or write while you have a cup of tea, this is the perfect option."}
{"text":"Seriously amazing. I love tea (tea and kettles are all people seem to get for me around holidays and birthdays), but this place makes me feel like a total novice. The tea is truly fantastic, the selection is huge, and the ambiance so relaxing. The best part is that it is relatively affordable too! I have been here many times and will continue to come here as long as I live in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I've been to Dobra Tea twice, and thank goodness I came back that second time. The first time I came here I honestly wasn't sure I would be back, as the staff flat out lost my tea order. Not exactly a good first impression from a tea house, huh? Fortunately, friends convinced me to come back, and the second visit went much more smoothly. Thank goodness, because I as a tea drinker belong at a place like Dobra.  This place is so unique in the city of Pittsburgh. The place is set up in such a way that you can pick the best spot for your outing's needs - some areas feature some actual seating, others further back require that you remove you shoes and sit on cushions or mats on the floor, and there are curtains that help to separate many of these different areas and rooms. No matter where you decide to sit, every table includes a thick book of tea that any tea lover will just want to browse through for the duration of their visit. Be advised if you're not a regular tea drinker - this place offers so many types of tea that they can divide up their booklet into chapters, each dedicated to a different type of tea. Newcomers may be a little overwhelmed.   By the way, don't worry about coming in hungry: not only is Dobra home to a massive collection of tea options - they make yummy snacks to go with them. Cookies, hummus, the best grape leaves I've found locally to date...can you say yum? Because I'm thinking \"yum\".  I'm not a big fan of the bell system here - that's really my only complaint, and I say this mostly because it's easy to accidentally ring the bell and summon a staff member. It's not a huge problem and it does match the set-up as a whole, so I kind of accept this and try really hard not to touch the bell unless I'm 100% ready for more tea or snacks.  So on that note, who wants to come split a pot of tea with me sometime? I think ready for visit #3!"}
{"text":"This is a nice small tea shop. They have a selection of tea for purchase by the oz or by the cup and pot.   The sit down area was very nice. Seats a little tight for the larger man but a great ambiance.   My tea was of avg quality and resteeped ok. The reason I didn't have a second cup of something else was the lack of a modern tea steeper. I was surprised by hot water when I tried to strain my second cup in their system.   The tea for sale was nice a 1oz starting point though you can tell they aren't sales people. While he asked if I needed brewing instructions he never talked about storage and although most of their teas are in Tina as they belong some of their was is in a wall system that isn't moisture safe.   I took two teas Togo to try though and suggest if your in the area you stop by and give this place a try."}
{"text":"Was so excited to find this spot.  The aroma of all of the rich-flavored teas hits as soon as you walk through the door.  Japanese matcha tea went perfectly with the tea cookies and the baba ganoush was some of the best I've had.  Can't wait to come back for some miso soup and baklava:)"}
{"text":"This is a really great place for a casual chat with your friend or getaway from work."}
{"text":"Dobra tea is a nice place to relax. Good tea and good location. Love to sit and study here."}
{"text":"Going to this place was such a great experience! I like the cozy and comfortable atmosphere where you can take your shoes off and be served. The tea selection was phenomenal and the service was also great.  I had some type of pita bread with oil and it was definitely freshly made. It makes a perfect atmosphere to catch up with a friend in."}
{"text":"Long story short, the stars are purely for physical atmosphere. The first time I came here we were treated with arrogance and eye rolls. Instead of using it as a great opportunity to educate patrons about tea varieties and such, we were treated as a nuisance. I went back a couple years later only because some out of town friends wanted to go and had a similar experience. Ordered Moroccan mint tea which was expected to be served in a Moroccan tea pot and matching glasses but instead was served in a white ceramic tea pot. Just ruined the experience. Otherwise the interior is very nice and the little cubicles and cushions create a nice presentation and atmosphere."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to chill and relax with friends. Quaint little place with a huge variety of tea and finger food. Definitely a unique place. Check it out it you aren't quiet in a mood to eat a whole meal with a friend or when going out for ice cream gets old."}
{"text":"Dobra is a really cool place. They have regular tables, but also little cushions where you and your friends can sit comfortably around a table that is much closer to the floor. They give you a bell to ring when you want someone to some to your table, so they don't have to constantly check in (also- you get to ring a little bell for service and it's kind of fun and amusing).They have a billion different teas and a good selection of interesting snacks to eat. I highly recommend dobra if you're looking for a new and interesting place to drink your tea/do homework/play on your laptop/read/have a get together with friends."}
{"text":"This place was so chill. If you have patience you need to check out this tea time hangout. They have over 100 teas, small plates, sweets and snacks. We loved the spiced oranges. The toddler got a hot chocolate but it wasn't sweet enough so we added some sugar. I got a decaf spiced chai which was bomb. And the fiancé got her usual, Earl Grey. Just remember not to be shy about ringing the bell for device and be patient. Tea takes time to brew."}
{"text":"I live opposite this place and absolutely love it. The staff are well informed about their pretty comprehensive menu (they all have to go through a certification). Must try the chai, is the  closest you will come to authentic indian tea. Great space and love the occasional belly dance."}
{"text":"An authentic experience! There are a variety of little cubbies/rooms so you and your party have a private area to sit and enjoy your tea/snacks and the ambience and decor made me love it the second we walked in. Each one is adorned with pillows and cushions for a comfortable stay.  I ordered the matcha green tea and saw as they used proper techniques to prepare it.   The chai pie was also delicious and unexpected. I also enjoyed the hummus plate quite a bit.  The most trying part of the experience was simply choosing what to order from a menu the length of a short novel but from my experience, you'll be highly satisfied with anything, as well as with the service and experience. There is a small bell at room that you ring when you need anything - how fancy ;)  Especially suggested if you're a tea lover or want a place to chat, read, or relax!"}
{"text":"LOVE the atmosphere in this place.  Deceiving on the outside, it looks like Dobra is just three tables and a counter, but once inside you'll see that it stretches far back to the end of the building. It's an incredibly comfortable atmosphere, to the point where you'll be wondering if you should take your shoes off (not necessary unless you sit in the way back)  The menu for teas is literally a book. It's huge and maybe a little intimidating, but any server would be more than happy to guide you to something that fits your tastes.  If you're a vegetarian (or if you're not) their Baba Ghanoush is delicious.   As far as teas go, I love their tea beers (non alcoholic, but they _look_ like beer) and their Forest Dragon."}
{"text":"Relaxing, zen atmosphere.  Good energy.  Wonderfully attentive staff.  And great tea to boot!  :)"}
{"text":"This is my go-to study spot. The atmosphere is great, it's quiet and relaxing. There's always soft music playing and the setup makes it so that you feel like you're in your own private little tea room. It's a little pricey for tea, but as far as I know it's the only place to get such a nice variety of authentic, traditional teas. The hummus plate is also delicious, and I usually get the lunch special of a hummus plate with a pot of tea. The tea pots come on candles to keep the water hot so you can take your time and sip away!"}
{"text":"Parts of this place could be five stars. The vibe, the tea, the differentness of it all. Fantastic. My eight year old and I went in and loved it very much. And we are big fans of Te Cafe. But Dobra had us sold. Brought the wife back with us next time.   Waited an hour for hummus, hot chocolate and two pots of tea. After 45 minutes went to ask. They couldn't have been more unworried or dismissive. After the hour, stuff comes out. Forgot my tea completely. But as they were bringing stuff out piecemeal, it wasn't apparent for another five minutes. They said they were really busy. There were five tables. They had substituted babaganoush for hummus. Ok. We are laid back. It's cool. But they didn't even tell us and were annoyed when we brought it up. It's as rude a staff as I've seen. God, I wanted to love this place. If you get good service, you'll have a great time. But when it's bad.....oh my. Head across the street."}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE this place.  You go in, have a seat either at a table or the carpeted floor seating areas (I'm sure they have a name, but I don't know what they are called).  A server brings you a menu book (it's really a book with all kinds of teas, and explanations of each, and how different teas are made and grown).  The waiter also brings you a bell and you ring whenever you're ready or if you need anything during your visit.    It's a great place to relax, have a philosophical discussion with friends or strangers.  Pleasant atmosphere and helpful wait staff.  Perfect place for a tea guru or the beginner.  My first time there we sat for at least 2.5 hours and it was great.  I wish there was a place like this closer to where I live."}
{"text":"I love everything about this place. Casual, so serious about tea. Great for studying or a date or a chat with a friend."}
{"text":"Wonderful cozy ambiance with the funnest little sitting areas and the BEST CHAI I've had in America.  For reference, I lived in India for 3 months :).  Getting someone to get your order is a bit of an ordeal but just learn to be a princess with your ringing bell and they come right over.  I always order the Chai tea and it come hot in a clay cup. The flavors are amazing and it is the perfect sweetness level. Be careful with the hot beverage and take your time sipping :).  One of my favorite places to meet up with friends in squirrel hill."}
{"text":"Awesome place to relax and spend time with friends. They have an extensive menu and I would highly recommend their boba. If you're looking for a fun unique experience then check this place out."}
{"text":"This place is a gem.  Great place to study, etc.  Excellent wifi... amazing team and overall great vibe."}
{"text":"This is the best place for tea. It's authentic and I love the seating and little \"rooms.\" It's a comfy and warm place. The rooibos is my favorite!!"}
{"text":"Exotic decoration which makes me feel in another country and relaxed. They have a huge choice of tea from all around the world. Some of them are unique and you can't find in other stores but every time I was there with my friends it took long, long time to be served. I recommend to go if you have plenty of time and it's okay to wait and wait.  They don't have so many options for food. The only sweet I had it wasn't good. This store is mostly for tea."}
{"text":"Unusual, exotic fun.  Everyone should at least try this place.  Great place to experience something different.  I went during the Bellydance Hafla, but there are all kinds of events held at Dobra.  There are all kinds of nooks to sit and talk, this place is warm and welcoming.  Plenty of teas to choose from, wonderful ambiance."}
{"text":"Wow! I can't believe I've slept on this place!   The atmosphere is beautiful, comfortable, and intimate. This seems like a great place to study or get to know a date.   When you walk in, you can grab a menu, a bell, and pick a place to sit. (I recommend the last room on the left. There are a few steps though so that room might not be accessible to all).   There are so many teas and interesting information in the menu that it reads more like a book. You should come in with a lot of patience or knowing what tea you are interested in drinking.  We softly caught the server's attention once he finished with a nearby table. We were uncomfortable using the bell to summon people due to historical trauma from the treatment of our ancestors, and not having prior experience in a culture where it is polite to summon people in that manner.   The teas were delicious! My friend had the spiced chai and I have the peach cobbler chai. Both were served in clay cups that were beautiful, but very hot to hold.   I can't wait for my next visit!"}
{"text":"I went to Dobra Tea on probably the snowiest Saturday of 2015 which made the delight of sipping Tea just more delightful. This place takes me right back to my High School days working at my Mom's Teastore [miss you mom - and the Marktfrau store] with many familiar names and terms.   I arrived here with my Tepper ladies at High Noon after trekking our way up through the snowy slopes of Murray avenue and were greatly with a fresh fragrant smell of loose leaf green and oolong teas. The front of the shop is an actual store where one can purchase many varieties of loose leaf teas, a few tea cups and the needed tools to make it at home, but our goal was the Tea house portion in the back of Dobra. Behind the curtain there are a multitude of tables and benches where arriving in groups is quite encouraged.  Having arrived slightly before everybody else [on foot we had no issues with the snow] I desperately needed to warm up. On the front door there was [faux pas me I don't care] a sign for hot chocolate which was just calling my name. Find a picture of it somewhere amongst the gallery. It was rich in flavor and steamed just to the correct temperature without the slight burnt milk flavor which usually scorches my tongue at restaurants.   With our party in tact we got to ordering. After stumbling through the large menu [the server will gladly help you with this] and the delightfully delicate descriptions of each tea [Sarah got the best kick of these] we rang the bell [love it!] for the server to come. We had two pots communally and one of our ladies had the rooibos masala [no caffeine for this chickie -- rooibos is a herbal african bush which is steeped as tea is and 100% caffeine free]. We had the flavored plum tea which is a black tea with dried plums. Some of the dried fruit is left in the pot for added flavor. I was happy with the correct tartness I was expecting. I was disappointed that we got through it too quickly [only 1 infusion]. We then had the Jin Xuan Oolong which bears a nutty flavor, perfect for spring or summer. This is my kind of Tea! I could drink for ages. Thankfully Oolongs are standard to all our Chinese restaurants.  Alongside the tea we ordered a hummus plater as well as the Baba Ganoush, an order of the dried fruit and the 6 tea cookies [yes - we feast!!] The Baba Ganoush was perfectly made [this is my current favorite thing to snack on - I may go on a rampage like my mother did with Obatzda back in the day] but by far the best were the Tea cookies. They were perfectly spiced, not too spicy, not too sweet and just moist enough.  Last but not least [We are greedy girls] we had the Bai Mu Dan, which is a light white tea that will give you multiple infusions as a Gong Fu Tea. The Gong Fu Tea ceremony is the ritualistic pouring of Tea stemming of the Chaozhou in the Guangdong province in Southeast China. The Gong Fu Cha [mostly me, but other learned quickly] will systematically infuse and pour the tea to all those participating in the ritual. It gives the Gong Fu Cha [teacher] a sense of peace and serenity and the guests a stimulated experience.   All in all this experience was beyond enjoyable and I do urge you to check it out!"}
{"text":"This place has awesome ambience. A large number of varieties of teas to choose from. The place looks pretty small and unimpressive from outside but interiors tell a totally different story.  Loved it!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Great atmosphere and great selection of tea. I've had something new everytime I've been here, and it never fails to please."}
{"text":"Tea Nirvana. 60 page book of awesome teas + Super-helpful staff who know their stuff + Plenty of room and comfy seating (Hurray for personal space!) + Music that isn't distracting when you're working/talking/reading/etc. + Fantastic, healthy snack food = Perfection. I really love this place. The atmosphere, the tea, true - It can be a bit pricy - but I haven't found any place like this in Pittsburgh and I believe it's worth it. I never thought I'd find a tea-house in Pittsburgh to rival some of the ones I went to in DC but Dobra has proved me wrong."}
{"text":"If you're a tea lover and you live in PGH, you must give Dobra Tea a try.  They offer teas you can't find anywhere else in the city from at least five (maybe six) continents.  I've come here on several occasions (the last one being while back), and have ordered the rooibos, chai, and even a clear, delicate type of tea that had a flower that bloomed in the pot as you watched!  You can order tea by the pot here, so I always come with some friends and split two pots with them. We've also ordered some of the snacks, as well, including the cinnamon orange slices, which were yummy and an interesting change of pace from the baked goods that most other local coffee and tea shops serve.  Aside from the gargantuan selection of teas (you order from a menu that's quite literally a book--with chapters, no less!), the atmosphere of this place is quite distinctive.  While there are some regular tables in the front, I enjoy sitting in the rooms in the back, in which you sit on cushions and sip your drinks from low tables.  These rooms are cordoned off from one another with opaque, velvety curtains, giving you the feeling that you're somewhere in the Orient, rather than in the middle of Sq. Hill in PGH!  Service has always been fine, if a bit slow, but I kind of feel like that's to be expected in a place like this, which clearly wants you to savor your tea and provide you with an experience, rather than a mere beverage."}
{"text":"Very conflicted about how to rate this place for the following reason:  I love the atmosphere and the staff! It's a great study/work spot and very relaxing, but still productive.  However, you are paying for the atmosphere here because I think their drinks are on the pricey side for what they serve. Also, they charge extra for milk and sugar, which is mainly an issue since their teas lack flavor. I have liked some of their iced teas and pastries, but a lot of the hot teas have been a disappointment to me, which really makes them lose a star being that their primary product is tea.  I don't want to dwell on this too much because I still think it's a unique and amazing spot in the area and I always love coming back here!"}
{"text":"My favorite tea place in Pittsburgh! The owner, Nate, as well as the rest of the staff, are friendly and always give good tips on their selection. The aforementioned selection is beyond expansive! The atmosphere is key and keeps you in the shop longer than you'd initially expected. I usually come with a book or a friend, and just soak in the vibes. I live down the street and I know from multiple visits that it is an absolutely wonderful place to go."}
{"text":"Always enjoy Dobra Tea as a place to relax and have a great conversation with friends. The inside is super cozy, with a range of colorful chairs, booths, and pillows to sit. I typically go for their tasting duo; two pots with contrasting flavors that you can enjoy back to back. It's enjoyable as all of the tea there is wonderful, and the staff takes time to explain the differences in flavor of the teas so that the customer can have a great experience.  Our most recent visit was unfortunately a bit disappointing regarding the service. I was stopping in with my boyfriend and his sister visiting from out of town, and we were excited to show her the atmosphere at Dobra, as she is a huge tea fan. Since the menu has so many options, we wanted to start off with a tasting duo to sip while we look through the rest of the menu and decide what else to try. When I ordered the duo, I asked if it would be possible to include a third cup so each person could have their own. While this has never been an issue in the past (I have been in with groups of 3 or 4 and ordered the tasting duo), our server gave us a hesitant, but clear \"....no.\" He then proceeded to explain that the duo was intended for 1 or 2 people and would not be suitable for 3. After a few back and forths, and trying to explain that we were planning on ordering more but just wanted to start off with something first, he finally agreed to provide the third cup.   While it's not a huge deal, and the server was friendly enough still - it kind of left an uncomfortable feeling for a bit - the embarrassing implication that we were somehow cheap customers or making an unreasonable request for trying to share an order. Especially since we had someone from out of town we were showing around, it left a poor impression.   Ultimately, though, it's just one negative experience out of many good experiences. Dobra Tea is a great tea house with a wide selection of teas, a beautiful interior, and knowledgeable staff. Definitely a must try for anyone in the area who enjoys a hot beverage!"}
{"text":"I have officially found my favorite tea place...EVER! This beautiful tea house has the most interesting interiors and decor with ethnic wall art and ornate carpets and furniture. You can choose to sit at a table or in one of their more casual booths where you can curl up on the carpet and enjoy your favorite brew. They hand you these cute little bells when you enter that you have to ring to get your servers attentions when you're ready to order. Dobra offers way more varieties of teas than I could count... even the famous Kashmiri Noon Tea which is a pinkish milky and salty (yes, salty) brew.. which I was delighted to see. I was a bit of a cliché that afternoon and went for the masala chai. I love the unique and interesting China that they serve their teas in. Mine came out in this darling little tea pot with a matching cup and saucer and milk separately all on a pretty tray..just like how it was served growing up in the Army culture in India. It tasted absolutely perfect and brought back memories of cold winters of North India. Their snacks also are carefully chosen to complement the teas. I'm definitely going to going back. I plan to find my favorite carpet to curl up on and try more varieties of tea whilst enjoying a nice book. Great place with a lovely vibe and very polite and gracious service."}
{"text":"I was in from out of town and loved this place. The atmosphere is amazing. Reminded me of some time I spent in Nepal. Great, intimate seating. You get to ring a bell when you're ready to order. The tea was really good and the snacks were reasonable. I'm going back...today!"}
{"text":"Beautiful, comfortable interior, delicious tea. A perfect place for a leisurely catch up with friends. Reminds me of Samovar in San Francisco and Andala in Cambridge, if you've ever been to those. This place is a true gem of Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I love this place! I come here basically all the time.  TEA: They have a wide selection of teas, and an especially wide selection of what I like to call \"tea concoctions\" (a.k.a. things that are more than just leaves + hot water, e.g. mixtures with milk, honey, spices, etc). There's also a few options if you'd like to do a tea tasting to explore different teas. The staff is very knowledgeable and can help you navigate the menu to find what you'd like.  FOOD: They also have a very appealing selection of snacks, not just the sad pastries many other places offer. They boast a very classy array of cookies and sweet treats, as well as hummus, miso soup, spiced orange slices, and more.  AMBIANCE: While I'm quite fond of Dobra's tea and food, the real reason I keep coming back is I just really love their whole ambiance and aesthetic. The space has a kind of boho, Moroccan-inspired vibe. The tea and snacks are presented so beautifully with pots/cups/plates that enhance your enjoyment of them. It's a great place to chill.  There's another tea place right across the street called Té Café, but I 100% prefer Dobra (I only go to the other place if Dobra is closed).  One warning though: Their signs claim that they take their last orders 30 minutes before closing, but it seems they don't follow this very literally. I once rushed over to Dobra so that I could get my fix before last call and arrived with 10 minutes to spare, only to be told they had already stopped taking orders :(."}
{"text":"Love the environment and I've had a great time with my friends!! But my knowledge about the menu is limited.  Have learnt a lot from the introduction and tasted some refreshing foods."}
{"text":"Normally one to study at Te Cafe, my friend and I wanted a change of scenery to study for finals.  Enter Dobra Tea.  We arrived at opening on a Sunday morning, and they were about 20 minutes late to open.  The space does not seem to be air-conditioned so heads up if you can't deal with that.  I liked the fans over the air conditioning so this was a plus for me.  First, I ordered a pot of the Cinnamon Rooibos tea, and it was spectacular.  It was full of flavor and one of the best teas I have ever tried.  The little tea cups and pots were cute, but this does lead to less tea which is a bummer.  The honey that came with the tea was extra delicious too.  The atmosphere was a bit weird here.  This is definitely a place to come with a group and to socialize.  The cliental was mostly middle-aged, loud, gossipy women when we went in.  Also, the music was not good, which killed the atmosphere.  The servers also had a bit of an air but none of this would stop me from coming back.  I will say, the whole ringing a bell for your server seems a bit disrespectful to me, but what do I know? They accept credit!"}
{"text":"Extremely friendly and informative staff, and the beer tea is a clever, well-executed drink. The decor is clean, spacious, and minimalistic, and the tea is endlessly wonderful. Rumor has it that the owner is growing tea- assam lines the windows in pots. This is a lovely little spot that I'll certainly return to."}
{"text":"A tea shop that's more than just a place to get tea - it's a place to *experience* tea. And yes, there is a difference. :)  The experience begins at the door. You walk in, grab a little green binder and a bell, and find the seat that most speaks to you. There are conventional tables, but also lots of soft pillows to sit on and comfy little hideaway spaces all throughout the shop. No two seats are the same in this beautiful location.  Once you find the perfect spot, open the menu and begin the journey. The binder has tabs for every type of tea - white tea, green tea, black tea, oolong tea, specialty teas, and more. There is not just a line about what tea options you have, there is a full story about the tea, the flavors, the way it is created, the best way to steep it, and the land from which it came (complete with any legends or lore that accompany it).  Plan to spend at least 5-10 minutes selecting your tea, unless you're a regular and know what you like. (And even then, unless you only like 1 or 2 teas, plan to spend a long time browsing!)  Don't forget to check out the food menu in the back of the binder. The plates are small, but the servings are hearty. The babaganoush is a personal favorite, served with warm pita and fresh veggies. The hummus is a solid bet as well, and the pita lebanon is spiced more perfectly than any pita bread that ever came before it! They also serve enormous bowls of miso soup unlike any you've ever had. Delicious and just what you need on a chilly day in this escape from reality.  Once you've decided on your tea and your snacks, ring your little bell. Like magic, one of the tea masters will arrive at your table and take your order.  When they bring the tea back, you'll gain a few more pearls of wisdom about the varietal, including how long to steep your next serving. You receive a small pot with the tea leaves, and a large pot of hot water, kept toasty above a candle's flame, as well as your tea cup.  Stay as long as you like, taking in the earthy incense scents, enjoying the vast array of musical selections, exploring the art and photographs on the walls, or working on your own great masterpiece at your table. (Yes, they have free WiFi, just ask your server for the password.)  When you're ready to head back to reality, leave your tea mugs and plates at the table and go to the front counter. You can ring out with cash or card (and you can tip on your card from the Square machine).  Especially as winter draws near and the temperatures drop, you'll find no better warm, welcoming escape than Dobra Tea."}
{"text":"As someone who is not really big on tea, I was worried that this place would not have much to offer me. I came here with a couple of friends and was blown away by the atmosphere they have created, which I found impressive because I rarely notice the decor in places I go. The menu was also impressive - they hand you a little binder filled with pages that go beyond just listing their wide selection of teas and actually talks about the origin and flavors of each drink they offer.  I ordered a no-frills hot chocolate. They have different flavors you can add into your hot chocolate, such as lavender. It arrived piping hot, so I waited for it to cool down. It was just an average hot chocolate, a step from your average powder mix, but nothing to write home about. I had a sip of oolong milk bubble tea with rice milk and it was also really good. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone, even if you don't like tea, to just come here and order anything and enjoy the atmosphere and relax with some friends or homework!"}
{"text":"I used to love this place. But, I'm giving the rating for the horrible service. The tea & sweets are excellent, but the service is so bad they should be ashamed of themselves. There's only 5 of these throughout the nation I think, and Pittsburgh is getting the worse comments. No menus or a bell was a given and we weren't greeted at all, in fact, they put the CLOSED sign 1 1/2 hrs in advanced right when we were about to walk in. There was only 4 of us so not sure about the rude looks...perhaps because we're not white (Which is pretty typical in Pgh, but NEVER acceptable). We understood the 30 minute rule so quickly ordered 1 1/2 hrs prior to closing. When I simply asked if we can get a cup, the waitress flipped out and said they're closing in an hr and said all this gibberish about customers coming in etc. when all we wanted was just a yes or no, so we took that as a no when she didn't finish her sentences and walked away. Okay fine, we will share our cups between the four of us, but don't freak out...it's not like she had a job like ours where you're saving a dying person daily and under that kind of stress. The workload isn't horrible to grab us an extra cup geez. How bad was it? Had to go up to the register to order and get menus and questioned if we needed to wait it ourselves. Will go here again for the tea, but just grabbing it to-go instead, but no tips anymore."}
{"text":"This was my second visit here. Dobra tea has a really nice ambience. Most customers were working or talking with friends over tea. Four of us  were playing cards and had a really great time. The servers were super friendly. We moved places thrice to get our place of choice, which is the booth at the extreme end of the shop.  The best part are the cute bells that you ring to get attention of the servers."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. So completely chill and unique.  The list of tea is unreasonably long. In a good way- a really good way! I can't do caffeine so usually what I can get is very limited. However there were plenty of great choices. It was actually hard to decide. And in addition to an extensive list of you tea... All presented in the most famous way.... They have cold teas.  My companion got a cold teas that was like a beer without alcohol and tasted off the chain. So good! I cold only have a sip some it was caffeinated. I totally wanted more!  We sat on the floor in one of the back tables. You have to take your shoes off. But it's such a cool thing to sit at the little table in the floor on the carpet and pillows. I definitely think that this is not for everyone but I loved it. We also got some food... Some olives and hummus. Great to nibble on while we called and drank our tea.  This place is well with the trip. Give yourself some time to relax and enjoy.  This is no place to be rushed.  It's so awesome!"}
{"text":"My favorite tea place in town! I love the vibe and the music - great place to study or catch up with an old friend. The music is mainly jazz or other instrumentals so it's great for focusing on work or whatever your friend is saying haha.   The price is pretty worth it when splitting a pot of tea with friends. Gets a bit more expensive with single serving iced teas and snacks, but everything is top quality so I'd like to think it's worth it! Also awesome to try out different exotic teas without investing in an entire canister before finding out you don't actually like it very much.   I would recommend trying the masala tea, genmaicha matcha, forest dragon iced tea, and their bubble teas!"}
{"text":"So many teas to choose from, it's overwhelming, but a great place to experiment - just watch out for some very expensive \"rare\" varieties if you are budget minded. Teas are kind of like wine; just because it is more expensive, does not necessarily mean it is better. You can have a delightfully refined experience sipping a more commonly available tea here. The rarer stuff is best bought retail and check for a date and/or inspect/smell it to make sure it's not old before purchasing, because unlike wine, fine teas do not age well.   Now that the temperatures are rising I highly recommend the \"Tea Beers,\" they are refreshing and delicious!   Service is typically good (but it makes me feel like an asshole to ring a bell and expect a server to come running), and you can choose to sit on the floor which is actually my favorite thing about Dobra Tea.   FYI, Dobra Tea is a franchise."}
{"text":"There is no other place quite like this one in Pittsburgh. Dobra Tea is literally a teahouse; the inside is much larger than it looks from the outside, and you are paying both for the tea as well as the experience.   First off, we were attracted to try their store due to their chalkboard out in front, advertising interesting concoctions like the Bee's Knees. We were surprised to find out that they actually offer over a hundred different teas! Most are Asian types, from Chinese black and oolong to Japanese green teas. They offer a variety of Sri Lankan and other ethnic types as well.   They are a bit on the pricey side for a cup/pot of tea, so you'd do well to order things that are harder to find elsewhere. Otherwise, you can always order your own tea leaves to take home with you. If you choose to drink here, it's a pleasant and relaxing environment. If you have the time, you can chill away in the little tea rooms with friends, reading up on the different teas in the menu or maybe doing your own work."}
{"text":"OMG this is possibly the best place ever ever ever.   The staff was fantastic and knowledgeable and responded to the bell promptly. The music was soothing and the incense was aromatic and the decor was all my favorite shades of pastel.   I loved the selection of 100+ teas and plenty of snacks supporting other local establishments. I loved the informative book and the different tea cup/pot/mug options. I loved the fact that I could have stayed there forever in a state of pure bliss... Nirvana anyone?   If I ever have a dream tea shop, it would look and smell and feel exactly like Dorba teas. Also they should consider opening a massage parlor in the back because they would make a killing."}
{"text":"After a couple more visits, I've decided that I am, in fact, a fan of this place. So I have accordingly upped them to 4 stars.  Some additional comments since the original post: * The size of the tearoom is larger than it seemed to me at first (a trick of the lighting -- the room is a long rectangle with natural light concentrated in the front of the store).  * The seatings in the back of the room are more comfortable, and it's also more spacious with nicer  ambiance back there.  * That they serve different styles of teas in (approximately) culturally appropriate tea wares is a nice touch. * The little bells they give to the customers to call the wait staff are not as distracting or annoying as I thought they might be. * I've not encountered any further heavily spiced aroma since the first time. The music is usually played at a nice, not distracting, volume level. * Using their wifi is still not very convenient. You have to type in the password each time. * I still think they offer too many food items -- so they are either out of some things or they'd have to serve some things in their less optimal state -- one time when I ordered pita breads, they arrived warm, fluffy and nice, another time, they arrived warm but dried. * The people  who work there are attentive and friendly. They do have a tendency to talk a lot amongst themselves -- not just chit-chatting, but about the running the business -- which can be a little distracting. (I have to admit that one of the reasons I gave them a 3 stars after the first visit was because I couldn't help overhearing them strategizing on how to find Yelp reviewers to review their shop. But after some thoughts, I think I was too harsh -- they were a new business, so they clearly have a lot on their minds.)"}
{"text":"I've tried dobra on a few different occasions and have ordered different things each time. I'm very disappointed because the tea I have tried here has tasted literally the same. All the fancy names and taste descriptions are great, if only the teas actually tasted like they sounded! The food is decent but expensive."}
{"text":"this place is great! there's a great vibe, and music that i've never heard before but i love it. the part that i love best is taking off my shoes and sitting straight on the ground. it's so relaxing and comfortable. it was my first time there yesterday, and i spent 4 hours there (on the floor) doing working... and actually being productive!   you can tell that tea is their top priority, because... each type of tea comes in its own special tea pot. their collection is so extensive that the staff come by to help you out.  the service is amazing. i personally did not expect any service. i thought you order at the counter and that's that.. but no... they wait on you. it's pretty amazing.   aside from tea, they also have small menu items to nosh on, such as hummus and baklava. there's more, but those were the only things i got, and they were delicious.  i'm so glad to have this little place in my neighborhood! i will be visiting often."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I absolutely love the atmosphere inside- it feels like being transported to a new exotic place. They have a ton of different teas, and a really informative little menu book with more in depth descriptions of each tea. My only complaint maybe would be the limited number of outlets. This is probably better for casually meeting up with someone than for sitting down for a study session."}
{"text":"It is a nice place to chill and catch up with friends. They have different setting of tables/seats. On the front of the cafe they have their regular seating( two chairs and a table) where you can bring your laptop and work. On the back of the place they have floor seating which is good for people who are meeting to catch up.   They have a variety of options for tea. My personal favorite is the bubble tea which is usually available on the weekends. I've tried most of their snacks and they're all average."}
{"text":"This is also a great little tea shop in Squirrel Hill. You can tell that the leadership really put in the effort of making the experience authentic. I got a Chinese tea and my brother ordered Turkish and even the presentation represented the tradition of each teas's origin.  I'd recommend the hummus, as well as a couple pieces of baklava."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to relax after a float at Levity! Great tea and lovely sitting area!"}
{"text":"This is the best tea ever. The menu is HUGE and the staff is really helpful with people who aren't familiar with tea/non-tea experts like me. I always get two pots. One of something new I've never tried and then I top it off with Memories of Prague. I never use all the honey and eat the stuff out of the little pot with the spoon. It's a very relaxed atmosphere and I recommend it to everyone! Go here! Friday nights there's a lady who reads your eyeballs for your future. It's only $15 and I want to try it someday. We'll see!"}
{"text":"Great relaxing spot for reading/writing or visiting with friends. There are plenty of unique and rare tea options and some surprising but delicious combinations.   Their miso soup might be my favorite one in Pittsburgh.  The Dragon matcha iced tea is also delicious.  Among their many tea recommendations are concoctions to energize, focus, relax, cleanse or boost your immunity.   Service staff are knowledgeable and welcoming.    One negative is that there are not many electrical outlets."}
{"text":"These guys are the tea experts.  Knowledgeable and, even though I'm a tea drinker, these guys are tea purists.  Great selection -- probably the best in the region -- and great in-house \"teaing\" experience somewhere between Morocco and Japan.  Everything from the custom tea ware to the encyclopedic menu of tea shows great care.  They provide you with an education as well as a nice relaxing cup."}
{"text":"Last night my friend and I wanted a nice place to catch up at and we weren't feeling the bar, so we decided on Dobra. Both of us are tea fans, and some dreary winter weather made for a great day to sit inside and sip something hot.  You have to park on the street, but it happens. When I walked in, I could get a feel for the atmosphere immediately and it was so relaxed. We got our menus and were directed to choose our seats. It's almost like they have tiny open rooms that you can sit in. You choose one where you are on the floor with cushions or where you are on a couch-like seat. There are little colorful mosaic tables everywhere and intricate wall art pieces and dim lighting. WAY cooler than a Starbucks or some chain cafe by a landslide.   Quiet music plays in the background and you're seated with a tiny bell to ring when you are ready to order. We both got hummus plates with veggies and pita slices, she got the Queen Bea herbal iced tea, and I got the Rosemary Hotcha. The menu said it tasted like Christmas, and I knew I needed it. Our order arrived pretty quickly, and everything was great. My tea was adorable and did, in fact, taste like Christmas.  After we ate we sat and talked for another couple hours. The atmosphere is so great and it's easy to get lost in conversation just relaxing with your shoes off. It's a comfy little place to hang out. I'm upset it's been this long before my first visit!"}
{"text":"For the past few months, every time I passed by Murray I would notice this little tea room, so I finally decided to try it with some friends.  Personally, I prefer drinking tea to coffee, but in Pittsburgh, the only tea place I have tried is Teavana, and it is kind of far away. So having this tea room so much closer to where I live is definitely a good thing.   We went into this place after a hot and tiring kayaking trip. The cool temperature, dim lit room, and the plethora of fragrances of many teas and spices were extremely cooling and refreshing.   The menu was a book of hundreds of teas, and it was not easy to choose what to order, since everything sounded great. In the end, we each ordered an iced tea. I got the Forest Dragon. The mix of matcha flavor and fragrance of jasmine was something I have never thought of, but turned out to be a wonderful combination. My friends ordered the Bees Knees, a coconut water-based tea, and the Chilled Chai. All three teas were perfect for a hot sunny day.  The service was good. People who work there were attentive and patient when explaining all the different teas.  I will definitely like to visit this place again."}
{"text":"Ok, yes, this is a review on a tea house written by somewhat of a coffee geek. But hey, now I realize... Tea is great too.  So many selections of loose leaf teas, plus bubble tea! If you like red tea, please try the rooibus bubble tea. Best bubble tea ever.  Service was excellent too. I accidently rang a bell that was sitting on the table and a guy came running like I was king of the place.  Definitely worth passing most coffee shops for this."}
{"text":"Delightful little cafe with an abundance of teas. Stopped in for an iced tea in the afternoon and had an iced oolong that looked more like a beer than a tea, poured with a nice head. It was perfectly delightful."}
{"text":"The good:   Delicious, authentic tea house ambiance and experience here. Huge menu, lots of options, and reasonable prices for a pot of tea. The ice teas and smoothies are also good even if a tad overpriced. The presentation of everything was top notch, and the place really looked fantastic. Very chill vibes coming from there.   The bad:   I feel like a world class entitled jackass ringing a bell for someone to come wait on me. It feels condescending and makes me uncomfortable to the point where if I'd return I would most likely get something to go in order to avoid that whole mess.   Because of the layout of the place, the kitchen and tea prep area is almost entirely out of view from all the other patrons. This wouldn't be a problem if they have a traditional US serving structure (e.g. Each server has an assigned section and waits only on tables in that section), but because of the ring-a-bell-and-I'll-come-out-of-the-closed-off-prep-area-and-wander-around-wondering-where-the-ding-came-from, the service is EXTREMELY inefficient and slow.   The ugly:   For as large as this restaurant is and how busy they get, they are laughably understaffed. During my visit there were two gentlemen waiting tables and one dedicated tea person slinging drinks and filling snack orders. When the server didn't immediately need to take someone's order, they were helping make drinks. Often times all three staff members were in the kitchen making drinks/snacks for folks and 4 bells would go off. The server would finish the seemingly complicated drink, serve it, and then wander around and ask random people if they rang for service. The problem with this is that if a server asked a table who didnt ring their bell if everything was going alright and that table ended up needing something, you're stuck waiting even longer for them to get it together.   Once they cleared their drink queue, the servers didn't seem that attentive the things like clearing dishes, getting refills, bringing the check. They were perfectly content shooting the breeze amongst themselves and being cool with a half dozen pair of eyes staring daggers into the backs of their heads.   The baklava was entirely wack.   The music was too loud for the calm tea house vibe they were going for. I also had the unfortunate luck of sitting in one of those wicker tables in the front of the place and it was terribly uncomfortable. It's a good thing I was in great company or else I would have written this place off altogether. I'll be back for something to go if I'm ever back that way, but no way am I suffering through that crappy service again."}
{"text":"I gave Dobra tea one star not because the tea isn't great, but because the service is consistently rude, and slow.  I went to Dobra with 6 other people today as part of a meetup. No, we could not have seperate checks. No, we could not have the check while we sat, we had to go up to the register and figure it out. There were THREE other people in the entire cafe and they couldn't be bothered to even bring us the check?  Then at the register the waiter was beyond rude because EGADS! two people asked for change for a $20 and \"we should have asked for the check while we were seated\". Ya, we did ask you but you said no. What on earth is wrong with these people?   This was on top of his general rudeness and huffiness towards us the entire time we were there.   We've had rude service before and don't think we'll be going back. One of the other women at the meetup said that during one of her previous times at Dobra she asked about the waiter's opinions on dessert and his answer was \"I don't eat sweets, Sugar is death\". Ummm, your opinions on sugar are not what she asked for.   If Dobra wants to stay in business then they need to be a little nicer to paying customers."}
{"text":"I had been looking forward to trying this place for so long. And I wanted to love it. I wanted to make it my new go-to for studying. Upon entry, I was barely greeted and therefore confused as this was my first time. I hesitantly grabbed a menu and beelined for an open table.   The menu is expansive and takes time to go through, but I managed. However in this long time nobody bothered to come over to see if I was ready or had any questions. It turned out I was supposed to be given a bell to ring when ready, but I wasn't. There were also other confused patrons.   The teas were good overall and the atmosphere calm and cozy but if the staff would be a little less pretentious and talk to each other and friends less and customers more, it would be a lot better."}
{"text":"Cool chill vibe in here for hanging out and working.  Very large and diverse collection of tea, good coffee and their pita and hummus. Usually playing excellent music with live shows in the back.  Check them out at 'electro belly dance troupe'."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the atmosphere and decor of this place. It's really different that they give you a bell to ring when you need something. I got the chai tea I didn't particularly like it I should have gotten it spiced it was just too plain for me. They have so many options to choose from it's hard to pick just one the prices are reasonable so you can definitely try a few different teas while you are there. They also have loose tea you can purchase to go. I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Don't let the exterior of this place fool you, it is a warm and inviting interior, with private alcoves for enjoying quality time with friends and loved ones. I ordered Chai, and was treated to an authentic brewing. The gentleman behind the counter was helpful and informative. It's a place to a real cup of tea in a relaxing environment."}
{"text":"A very cozy tea house. They stock an extensive tea selection (the menu is 60 pages long). Fortunately, the staff is quite helpful and patient with the most indecisive of customers. The atmosphere is relaxing with your only worry being which delicious tea to try next.  Personally, I really enjoyed the touareg tea - a Moroccan green mint tea with hints of citrus (possibly orange).  It's a worthy place to check out if you're in Pittsburgh (especially the Squirrel Hill neighborhood)."}
{"text":"My greatest fear coming here was finishing the tea in two gulps and going to another restaurant later, but I ended up feeling completely full.  I ordered a small pot of Turkish Cay and goji squares, that was more than enough, and both were delicious.  My friend ordered a stuffed grape leaves and large pot of Pu-er tea and it came with the whole tea set and it was completely smooth, the only downside is I wished the tea wasn't as strong/fresh so the last cup was a bit diluted."}
{"text":"As a tea amateur, this place was fantastic. The atmosphere is legit without being intimidating, and the menu describes each tea in detail. If you are a novice, it is probably best to stick with a house specialty. Taste of Kashmir was wonderful."}
{"text":"This is a great place to get together with a few close friends, or to go on a cute date for something different than your usual restaraunt. There is a bell at each table & whenever you're ready to order, you ring for someone to come take care of you. The tea menu is impressive. They have teas in each category from around the world, & the menu has detailed descriptions of the teas' history & flavors. I haven't had many food items here, but I know their hummus is good.  They serve hot & iced teas, but i prefer to order hot because they bring you the tea leaves, cups, & a pot of hot water so you can re-steep the tea over and over. Getting an iced tea just isn't as much fun for me. Today I tried the Yin Zen Bing Cha. It's a pu-erh  tea (tea that is aged in a cave) made with white tea buds instead of black tea leaves. I've never even heard of that before! The flavor was silky, a little smokey & had a delicate, earthy finish. SO GOOD. You can tell that the white tea is of good quality by seeing the downy hairs on the tea buds. It might be my new favorite tea (I drank about 3 pots to myself). I'm always disappointed that they're out of Yellow Tea, my original favorite kind. I've come here a handful of times over the past few years & it's never in stock. I understand that it's very rare, but I kind of wish they'd remove it from the menu because I get exited every time I see it & feel let down every time."}
{"text":"One of the best tea houses I've been to. Great sitting area with Persian styled carpets and low tables, along with a wide selection of teas from far and wide. I personally recommend the \"Kashmiri Chai\": a soft textured, pink-coloured tea flavoured with milk."}
{"text":"Best place for a cup of tea! I love how authentic their tea is. I once asked them for Kahwa which is a special Kashmiri tea. They didn't have it but I was very impressed that they knew about it. The varieties of tea available is impressive along with their choices of snacks which compliment the tea you order. 5 stars for sure!"}
{"text":"Great spot to just relax and have a conversation with a friend! I got a dark hot chocolate and my friend got the Lu Mu Dan flowering tea . The drinks are on the pricier side but the ambiance is nice."}
{"text":"I love this unique and cozy little spot! I got an iced herbal jasmine tea here and it was great. Love the vibe of this place and the people working here were super friendly. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Lucky people in Pittsburgh!  Variety of tea ;each one served in special pot. Cinnamon and Darjeeling tea were wonderful.  Very beautiful and Bohemian style...  Baklava: delicious :))  Overall: lovely lovely lovely"}
{"text":"Dobra Tea is a beautiful combination of extensive tea collection and ornate decor.  I had a Chinese Green Tea -- the first one on the list -- that was accompanied by detailed directions on how to let the leaves steep by my server. It was like a schooling on teas, and I really appreciated it. I also might have eaten an entire Goat Cheese, Pita, Olive/Tomato platter all by myself.   I would definitely go back. It's peaceful there and can accommodate large groups or loners like me."}
{"text":"Went here with friends after hearing a lot about the place, but was honestly a bit disappointed. The vibe of the place is very relaxing, but a little bit cramped. The seating idea is interesting, although not always practical, especially when you have sit on the cushions when wearing a dress. It is quite busy. Although the place is famous for its large selection of teas, I ordered a bubble tea which was truly awful. The food selection is limited and decent. I felt most items are a tad bit overpriced."}
{"text":"This is the first time I have been to Dobra and it will not be the last.I had a great time, service, and passed many hours without even knowing it with my friends. The ambiance is fantastic. The booths were warm, welcoming, and so comfortable. I was amazed at people just lounging with each other and not being weirded out by the the fact they were sitting right next to people they may or may not know. I have driven past Dobra in the past, and will not just drive by anymore.   Tea: I got a calming tea to sip on when I was there. It was refreshing. I also ordered a side of honey. The honey was not that great. I know it said it was local and all, but it tasted very plastic and not fresh at all. I even had my tablemate taste it to see if I was being crazy, and she also agreed it tasted...off. That is my only complaint. The tea was warm and refreshing. I was relaxed and just had a great time drinking and keeping company. It was nice to sip a perfectly steeped tea with friends.   Food: I was a little bit hungry so decided to look over the menu and purchase some nibbles.   HUMMUS PLATE: Local and Vegan. A traditional dish, popular in the Middle East, made from chickpeas, tahini (sesame seed paste), lemon juice, and olive oil, sprinkled with Zaatar. Served with warmed, local pita and slices of fresh vegetables. Hummus from the Greek Gourmet (L, V). I loved this plate. The veggies were crunchy and fresh and pita was delicious. I did not really like the sprinkled Zaatar spices on all the veggies, but will know for next time to ask for that to be left off. It was just not needed, at least I thought. My friend liked it but it just wasn't for me. I loved the hummus more than I liked the other dish that we got. I would suggest this one for any nibbles that need to be had.   BABA GHANOUSH PLATE Local and Vegan. A popular spread, popular in the Middle East, made from roasted eggplant, tahini (sesame seed paste), lemon juice, and olive oil, sprinkled with Zaatar. Served with warmed, local pita and slices of fresh vegetables. Baba G from the Greek Gourmet (L, V). Again, much like the hummus plate I liked the pita and the veggies. I was not 100% thrilled with the baba. I like it to be a little less smokey and this was overly smokey and was not the best of flavors. I know that is more the Greek Gourmet than Dobra. So I suggest the hummus over this dish.   Loose Leaf: I have not been sleeping very well and asked for a suggestion for some tea that could help me relax. They suggested the Somulance tea. This tea came with a warning, \"do not drink it if you have to drive.\" Apparently it makes people so sleepy that they have had accidents! I have yet to try it out but I hope it will help maybe make my sleep a little less rocky.  I honestly had a great night. I cannot wait to go back! It was cozy, warm, inviting, and just a wonderful place to spend time with friends. I hope that you go there and try it out!"}
{"text":"Cool environment! Love the feel inside but I have yet to have a drink I like and I've tried several. Their baklava is amazing though! I prefer Té Café across the street for their tea selection"}
{"text":"This is, by far, the most amazing tea place I've ever been to! Walk in the doors and make a right to escape to a foreign land! The ambiance is so beautiful with Middle Eastern, or \"Bohemian\" influences. There is so much tea to choose from and there are also small eats available. Here is a link to their menu: http://dobrateapgh.com/menu/. This is a great place to order a pot of tea and talk to an old friend, or meet for tea with someone for the first time! It is fairly quiet in here, even at busier hours of the day, which makes for nice conversing. The staff is friendly and helpful if you are looking to try something new! I really hope that you try this hidden gem! No where else can you experience such culture and unique teas all in one!"}
{"text":"Finally I made it here! I've been wanting to check it out for a while, but was disappointed when I did. I was not impressed. Staff is rude and not friendly, ESP the girl with blonde hair in a pony/ facial piercing I think. I had chamomile tea-- ugh-- prob the worst I've ever had. Forget trying to read and concentrate- place is very noisy. Hummus with veggies gave me a bad stomach ache. Overall, I tried it- I would not go back."}
{"text":"I come here almost every other day to kick off my shoes, lounge here, get my reading done, and savor some excellent Bombay chai. These guys know their tea - I've tried a variety of green, black, and iced cocktail teas and have never been disappointed. The menu is huge, the price is right, the ambience is great, and the only minor complaint I'd have is that the place seems a bit understaffed and service can be a bit slow on busy days. Five stars."}
{"text":"I was finally able to try Dobra a couple months ago after many of my friends have recommended it. Dobra has very comfortable seating areas suited for various group sizes. I made the mistake of assuming Dobra would provide a quiet environment to take phone calls and do work on a weekday. You can definitely do work, but the background music and other guests can cause noise if you need to take calls or if you need somewhere quieter. However, if you are at Dobra for purely social purposes, it's a great environment. My tea of choice was the \"Queen Bee,\" a light and refreshing cold tea. I would recommend it, but not necessarily order it again only because there are millions of other teas that looked interesting.   Taste | 4 Atmosphere | 4 Presentation | 4 Service | 3 OVERALL | 4"}
{"text":"A cute and cozy tea shop in Squirrel Hill. A great place to come with friends and catch up or do some work! My friends and I came on Sunday and it was quite crowded. After waiting for a few minutes we were able to grab a table. Their tea menu is extensive. They also have smalls snacks. We got pots of the Turkish tea and the Touareg tea. The Turkish tea was pretty mediocre, nothing special. The Touareg tea however was delicious. It was sweetened and had a nice mint taste to it. The mint was not too overpowering but nice and soothing. When you split a pot of tea, the prices are very reasonable. Overall, an excellent place to have a nice afternoon sipping tea."}
{"text":"Original review (5 stars): Great tea room with relaxing and intimate ambiance. Good for studying or meeting with friends or sitting by yourself. The tea selections are super varied, and the menu does a great job of explaining teas for those who are not as well-versed in tea-lingo. I've been looking for a good tea place in Pittsburgh, and this is definitely the front runner right now!  Updat: The last few times I've been there the service has been lacking quite a bit. Still great tea, but I either don't get served at all without having to approach the front of the shop or wait an inexplicably long time for service."}
{"text":"Suncake pastry was marginal--dry and relatively flavorless. Selection of tea is good. Ordered a rooibos Chai to go. Server was average in knowledge and helpfulness. Tea was tasty but the teamonger (my term) did not tell me that he did not have a lid for my drink until I waited 10 min for my drink to be ready. Frustrating as I have a 1.5 mile walk to my car. Ugh."}
{"text":"Magical things happen at Dobra. Conversations more stimulating, atmosphere more relaxing, and tea more aromatic. There are so many different kinds of tea to choose from that it has something to please any tastebud. I prefer the rooibus tea and Memories of Prague. The service is fantastic as well. My only complaint is that i was unimpressed by the Chai pie, perhaps because it was a bit of a tea overload. However if you want to stew in great conversation with friends while sampling some exceptional pots of tea, Dobra is the place to be."}
{"text":"Great Tea, Great snacks, AWESOME CUSTOMER SERVICE. Good place to be at on a cozy evening or weekend."}
{"text":"This place is unfortunately very overrated. The best thing about Dobra is probably the ambiance and the seating setup. The tea and food I've tried here has been OK. I find their menu to be long, exhaustive and extremely confusing. It's literally a small book! The most irritating thing about this place is how they ask their customers to leave at the end of the day. I was there with 2 friends once and we were literally shocked by the use of a gong to signal people to leave! The server had walked up to us half an hour before closing and rushed us to order tea so the entire experience felt unpleasantly hasty. I've been to other tea places in Pittsburgh around closing time and no one does anything as nasty as this. If you ask me, this place is very commercially driven (likely due to the huge influx of tea lovers they have been gradually attracting over the years) but lately they have been taking it to a whole other level. I guess it's time to drink some chamomile tea and calm down a little, Dobra! :)"}
{"text":"Dobra tea is located at the corner of Beacon St and Murray Ave. There is a pay parking lot nearby. I went in and noticed all the various teas. A man helped me and told me to sit anywhere. It was lunchtime and hardly anyone was there.  I noticed a sign that said, \"please silence your mobile device.\" I couldn't understand why because I did hear folks in conversation. Nevertheless, the place has a Middle Eastern theme to it. I was given a menu that lists all their teas. It has sections in it that are divided by type and a detailed description of each. Their teas are white, black, green, Asian, African, and Japanese influences to name a few. In the back of the menu there were some food options. I was handed a \"bell\" by which I could summon him for what I needed.  I asked about their teas and sampling some. He said they don't do samples but asked what I preferred. I settled for a plum tea and was told that a pot would be about 10 oz. I also ordered   a slice of pumpkin bread. My tea came in a small teapot along with a tiny cup to drink it from. The tea was supposed to have plum leaves in it but it tasted like plain black tea and very bland. The pumpkin bread was a very small piece but was very good. I rang my bell and asked for some honey just to give it some flavor.  I noticed a man at a nearby table with a different teapot. I learned that they try to match the teapots to the type of tea you ordered. When I was done I asked my server how to pay and he told me to come to the front of the store. There they have a gift shop and of course you can buy loose tea in a bag for about $5.00 per ounce. The teapots on sale were similar to the ones served but were very pricey. I did mention to him how bland my tea was and he apologized by saying he probably didn't steep it that much.   Meantime I looked on the counter and there were tiny cups of different types of loose tea for purchase. He told me that since they had been sitting out I wouldn't be able to smell them but could smell any of my choice. I asked to do that with a few and learned that if I could have done this in the beginning it would have helped me choose a better tea. There was one I really liked with cinnamon in it. He sells that tea but you have to add your own cinnamon. I paid my bill and decided to leave since it was under $10.00.   Needless to say it was a fair visit.  I like how it is served and the atmosphere but if you are unacquainted with tea then this place would not be your best bet."}
{"text":"Incredibly cool space with an amazing assortment of teas to choose from. Plethora of food options as well that look great!"}
{"text":"Back again after two years we still love Dobra tea. A nice vibe with interesting and relaxing nooks to enjoy a wide selection of teas served both hot and cold.  It's low key and cool on a hot day to come and peruse the menu or take suggestion from the knowledgeable staff. It's great to just chill here after a day at the Botanical Garden or Shenley Park with your favorite tea, maybe a simple tea cookie or baclava or a hummus platter. Lovely rugs adorn the floors and some walls. Over the air plays a conscious choice of jazzy trip hop or something more tantric. Two years ago my wife and I were together alone. This year we are joined by our 6 year old daughter who is just sitting here with her coloring books on a pillow, low to the ground listening quietly and waiting for her hot chocolate and donut. Very much at peace in this moment of paradise."}
{"text":"Top notch tea, service, and atmosphere - my go-to date spot!"}
{"text":"They have amazing flavors of tea.. If you're a tea lover definitely check out this place. Good for students also to sit there and work on their assignments ;)"}
{"text":"Idk how anyone disses Dobra. Seriously, at first I was really wary of the whole funky ~*global~* theme but they won out by how dedicated they are to indigenous tea cultures. And the chai they make is not that \"chai tea latte\" swill. There was actual ginger, actual black pepper, actual cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, etc. The only issue is that they shouldn't use the fancy-pants assam teas b/c real chai is a not about being a tea connoisseur but about the drink as a whole. Use the cheapest damn mamri (CTC) tea, no bags, and brew it in 2% milk, no water. Some of the alkaloids in the spices are only fat-soluble and brewing in water and adding milk later won't do any good. (if the owner is reading this: yes, it really does make a huge difference in taste) It's supposed to be brisk and whole point is that the maltiness of the tea is balanced by the cardamom. Their matcha tho was the most stimulating thing I've had in my life. Although sometimes, I'll admit, the serving sets are a little bit cumbersome and spills are likely if you're inexperienced so ask the staff to show you how. Usually they'll make the first pour, just make a mental note of it."}
{"text":"This place is really cool!  My friend and I came here on a Sunday afternoon. When we walked in we weren't sure where to sit or what to do. Eventually someone told us we could sit anywhere but didn't mention if it was table or counter service.   Their menu is HUGE! They have a whole table of contents that shows their white, green, black, herbal and specialty teas! They also have snacks, light fare foods in the back of the book.  We picked out a Jasmine flower flowering tea and a lychee black tea. My friend also had miso soup (not pictured.) The teas were very good! We also really enjoyed their honey but we had to ask for it. My friend seemed to like her miso soup but I didn't get her whole opinion.   This place is very relaxing and a great place to talk! I'm giving it four stars because the service was confusing. They're a table service restaurant but it wasn't clearly articulated. I had to go to the counter to actually get any server's attention.   I'll definitely be back though! Hopefully the service is just a little more attentive next time."}
{"text":"I avoided Dobra for a long time, out of loyalty to Te Cafe. I finally went in tonight since I was in the mood for a matcha latte and, wow, that is quite a tasty item. I think I'll go back tomorrow and get another. The inside is surprisingly spatious and looks like a great place to study. So, I'm quite impressed."}
{"text":"For a tea lover this is EXACTLY what Pittsburgh needed! A tea paradise with over 100 different selections. As soon as I walked in I was in heaven.  I think I weirded out the owner and server with how excited I was, but I really love tea! I just saw tea in the title as I was browsing Yelp and literally just went there. So I had no idea what to expect. I went prepared to either walk in to buy tea or sit down and work.  Good thing is it's set up like a tea room, so you can sit down and enjoy your tea with friends or bust out some work (yay for me!). It's really cool inside. There's little rooms you can sit in with a group of friends that almost look like it could transport you to a different country. Adorable, really!  There's literally a whole book full of teas you can order from. There's black, white, oolong, etc etc etc. Too too many to even name! I went with the Black Vanilla tea. It was delicious. Would have gone with a touch of milk, but I didn't know if it was \"proper\" to ask.   They also have some very light snacks and desserts. I'm so excited to come back, I'm sure I'll get to the eats at some point. Although, I wasn't really a fan of the music. It was kinda like something you'd hear at a spa. If I had ear buds with me, I probably would have popped them in. But I get why they're playing it, for ambiance.   Whatever, I'll be back working my way through the menu!"}
{"text":"Hipsters in Pittsburgh are all here, I guess.   Place is very spacious : I am so surprised that they can handle more many groups of people and allow ppl to enjoy tea and fun time together  The decoration is cool tho. I felt like it was like Indian styled interior design. But I am not sure, very thing here made me feel like I was in a foreign country.   Tea: they probably have the most variety of tea kind compared to all other tea places I have been. It is focused on Asian tea : white tea, black tea, green tea herbal tea etc. too my surprised, they have kongfu tea ! I think it's pretty authentic both the flavor n the courtesy.   Service: unique and nice. You will take a menu and a bell when you come inside. The bell will be used every time you decided to order something   Overall: sooo nice!!! A hidden gem in Pitt!!  If you are in town and have spare time, this is a must."}
{"text":"This was my first time going into a tea house. Amazing service and selections of Teas. Will go back."}
{"text":"This place has a really great tea menu for more traditional teas and less fruity blends.  The menu is huge, comes in a large book.  They prepared the tea perfectly, I had the Darjeeling first flush and my friend had the rose tea.  They also have a lot of interesting iced tea options and the chai is fantastic.  The cookies were just okay.  The decor is not my style but cozy.  The staff have an incredible knowledge of tea and are great for answering any question you could have about tea."}
{"text":"Very interesting place. I have been here twice. One of my friends who was visiting from California liked their tea so much that she took a bag of lemon balm and spear mint with her. Ambience is welcoming and cozy. They have a floor seating kind of thing which is good if you are with a group of friends. I like their lemon balm and spear mint tea and Rize cay tea. The staff is friendly."}
