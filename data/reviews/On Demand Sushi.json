{"text":"Our new favorite sushi place! The food was amazing and really fresh. Best sushi place in town for pick up or catering. I can't wait to be back here :))))))))))"}
{"text":"Interesting concept - still a work in progress.  Sushi is fresh and the rice is very good. good size amounts for the price. Take out the best way to go, a great alternative to Super Bowl pizza."}
{"text":"One word comes to mind. Quality  I have had sushi all over the United States from New York , ft Lauderdale, Seattle, California, and Colorado I've been to every state in the U.S. and now Las Vegas is on the map with this place the fish is fresh and every bite is the way it should be.this is the best sushi in Vegas"}
{"text":"Thick amount of fish supernyummi my Husband and I had the ahi roll and we ordering for the Super Bowl.  FRESH"}
{"text":"One word! Excellent! The sushi was fresh and very yummy! The owner was so professional and nice! Thank you for a wonderful sushi meal. Was my first time ordering and I am So happy! Delivery was Awesome  and fast!"}
{"text":"Stopped in last night with the family to pick up some sushi, ending up hanging with the owner for an hour. He asked us what we liked and started whipping up these giant rolls. Everything was super fresh. I can't even say what my favorite item was because it was all delicious....maybe the marinated ahi. Great prices too! Prices are cheaper if you go in and pick it up as opposed to having it delivered by ubereats."}
{"text":"Great sushi, high quality fish. Best place in town to carry out sushi. I even had an amazing poke bowl.  Owner is super friendly and welcoming. Catering trays look great, planning on ordering for work events.  I will definitely be back often."}
{"text":"The people who work there are super nice and friendly. You get big rolls for a small price, that will fill you up. Even the standard rolls are packed. If you like sushi this is definitely a place to try!"}
{"text":"Ordered directly through the Yelp app. They weren't very familiar with it so it took a little longer to pick up but not a big deal. Walking in it smelled fishy and looked like a dive...,,made me a little worried. However no need to worry! The food they produced was beautiful & delicious! Had the California roll, the Cros, tiger,and fire down below. All delicious & less than $40 with a tip!"}
{"text":"Owner was super nice and welcoming. Good rolls, and very affordably priced for the good quality.  Warning - Rolls are BIG.  Will definitely make this our take-out go-to joint!!!"}
{"text":"Just stopped by right now and they look like they are not in business anymore. Called earlier and no one answered so drove to order. It says they are open until saturday and its only 5:45! Inside looks disorganized with supplies scattered around. :("}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The prices are so good and the tuna is mouth watering. I will be here every week. You can call ahead and have it ready or use uber eats. They use real crab in their California rolls too!  Go here- you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"Hadn't even heard of this place til I found a Groupon- and it's not a bad deal. They market themselves as wholesale sushi, and while that doesn't exactly conjure up the most positive impression, it isn't misleading either. Location is bare-bones, in the back of the Juan's Flaming Fajitas plaza, mostly takeout with one table to dine in.   They have basic rolls (Philly, Cali), specialty rolls (rainbow, spider), and Premium rolls. Rolls are good-sized but fairly basic even for the specialty options, and our large order of 6 rolls was very hit or miss. The Kelly Crunch and the Alaskan (with jalapeno and asparagus) rolls were good but the spicy scallop roll was awful with a metallic aftertaste and the imaginative fried okra in the Cajun roll was hard and offputting. I like that they're trying to expand and offer different rolls, but some of them didn't really work.   TIP: They have check in discounts (free basic roll with $25+ pickup), a Yelp deal ($20 for $25), Groupons, etc available for an even cheaper home sushi party experience."}
{"text":"Their sushi was delicious and the staff is so pleasant! Definitely a place to come visit for some yummy to go sushi!"}
{"text":"Carey, thank you for accommodating my order.  I came in Saturday morning right at opening at 11am and threw a 4 order roll at him from hungry co workers wanting sushi for lunch.  The rolls were excellent and hit the spot.  We will for sure be coming back to order again so be ready for us!!!"}
{"text":"On demand sushi is a catering/pick up type place. We ordered 5 different sushi rolls for pick up. Service was good and the staff are friendly. When we picked up the food the presentation looked great. Beautiful looking sushi with flowers on a nice platter. Unfortunately, the sushi it self didn't taste as good as it looked. The rice consistency was not the right type for sushi and practically fell apart while trying to dip into the soy sauce. The fish wasn't very fresh either, and my husband nor myself were able to finish them. It is kind of comparable to grocery market sushi."}
{"text":"Excellent food, awesome owner! Very delicious, would recommend to anyone looking for yummy take out."}
{"text":"Very quaint venue. Take out/ delivery (I walked in to order take-out). Amazing presentation, friendly service, DELICIOUS FOOD, ridiculous pricing. I would visit simply because of the convenience alone, but I was stunned at how flavorful and beautiful the food is compared to other poke bowl establishments. The price seals the deal. BY FAR. Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"We stopped because it was close and we needed to be somewhere. It was not what we expected. It is a bare bones operation designed for takeout. But, do not be dissuaded. What we really didn't expect was the absolutely amazing sushi. Clarence, the sushi chef, is a master. We basically said do what you do best. All four rolls were wonderful. The fish was fresh. We also tried perfectly prepared poke.  The owner is a super nice guy who has a true passion for what he is doing. I think I am going to have a party just to order their sushi boat."}
{"text":"We got a groupon for this place and was very pleased when we tried it last night.  The owner was really nice and chatted with us the entire time he was making our sushi.  Prices are very reasonable and everything was tasty and the quality was great.  There isn't a huge variety of fish, but it was great for the rolls!  We looks forward to going back!"}
{"text":"I work right next door and this is my go to lunch spot basically everyday! The sushi is always fresh and amazing! The owner will make any roll you want on top of his already amazing menu selections!   My favorite roll is the sex on the beach extra spicy! Also his spicy ponzu sauce is to die for! I plan to use them to cater an event in the future! So good! Must try it!"}
{"text":"The chef was so nice, he delivered our food himself. The sushi was fresh and delicious. I was very impressed! I ordered like 6 different rolls. I will be ordering again soon. :)"}
{"text":"Great find!!! Really great fresh sushi!! I found this by accident and love it... the owner is really nice and welcome. Guys need to try this!!"}
{"text":"When we went there they start cut whole fish to make my order. During the waiting they were so friendly. If you have party or big event I definitely say order here even small order they are smiling to make sushi for us and it's take out place so make sure you order before you come. I didn't know how so I just visiting to take out order :)"}
{"text":"I bought a Groupon to check this place out. And Im so glad I did! The owner was so friendly and gave me good advice on what I should try instead of ordering the usual items. This was over the phone when I placed my order for pick up. He asked me what I liked and I went with whatever suggestions he made. When I picked it up the owner was super friendly. This restaurant is just for pick up or delivery only BUT there is a table there in case u needed to eat there. The establishment is still under works so its not fancy or anything. The sushi rolls were HUGE and FRESH. Price is great! Im definitely ordering pick up from this place again! Great place for pick up instead of ordering the expensive sushi at all Japanese restaurants. I wished I had pics to show but we ate it all too fast :)"}
{"text":"Stumbled on to this place the other day, and I'm so glad I did! They are greatly priced and everything I got was so fresh. They even put real crab in their Cali Roll! Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! Not only is the food to die for (BTW they use real crab in the California Roll)but the service and the people who work there are so friendly and nice. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Not only was the sushi amazing, the prices are fantastic! The fish was really fresh and they use REAL crab. They deliver but I stopped in and the owner and the chef were there, they were very kind and pretty hilarious. I live on the other side of town but will be back for the delicious sushi, great prices, and the laughter."}
{"text":"We discovered this place on accident after having dinner next door. Very fair priced Sushi for the quality (fresh). The owner is personable and helpful. Looking forward to trying more of their menu."}
{"text":"Carey is great. Only fresh fish cut here. Best place in town for pick up or catering. Not a restaurant but you can sit at the counter if you don't want to go! Will call to cater from this place! Excellent! Thank you Carey enjoys your down to earth personality and magic enthusiasm !"}
{"text":"Myself & a few family members were coming down from California & we were craving sushi so we came across this place. Absolutely loved it ! The service was great & the ppl were very friendly & attentive. If you ever want fresh & delicious sushi Seriously come here !"}
{"text":"So their posted hours currently show that they are open only Saturdays. Made an order last night - a Saturday - for pickup through Eat24, their ordering platform. Made the order, got halfway down to the restaurant to pick it up and got a phone call on the way. It was from Eat24, telling me that they had just heard from the restaurant owner and the restaurant was closed. (this was two hours before posted closing time). Sounds like this place is on the verge of closing permanently. Buyer beware."}
{"text":"I had a Groupon, ordered 3 rolls on a Saturday morning. Maybe it was just bad timing, but my rolls were not fresh! They tasted worse than some supermarket sushi. I ended up throwing most of my food away. Even with the Groupon, it was a complete waste of money. Service is good, so 2 stars."}
