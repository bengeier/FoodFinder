{"text":"Well this place was good. Not drive 50 miles to get this good but if you are driving through boulder city you should stop in. It gets 4 stars because I ordered the Kobe Burger medium but it came to the table well past well done."}
{"text":"If you live around or inside Boulder City, this place is a must see venue.  Granted, there are a lot of things to see in Boulder City....  maybe not, but this place is high on the list.  I had the bacon burger and it was outstanding.  The best part of the burger was the soft bun.  This cannot be underestimated when enjoying a good burger.  The only thing stopping me from giving five stars was our waitress.  She just wasn't really interested in our presence and it seemed as though we were an annoyance.  Either way, the food was outstanding.  If you are in the area stop by and enjoy."}
{"text":"They make the best milkshakes in southern Nevada!!! Great food, great price, and great service, who could ask for more. I had the Peanut Butter shake, the fish fry, fried pickles, the Red, White, and Blue burger and they all were fantastic, just like you are eating at home."}
{"text":"Great hamburgers & Best Crinkle fries I ever had. The waitress was fast and friendly. Only been there once, I will be back."}
{"text":"I go for the fries once a week. BEST IN TOWN! Only $3.05. Very large portion. Burgers are good. But the wife and I are not big fans of the buns or lettuce. We would like a healthier bun and green leaf lettuce as an option. Customer service has always been great and friendly."}
{"text":"We visited here on vacation a few months back. We only went because of the good reviews on yelp! The Kobe burger is to die for!!  I live 1300 miles from this place and I would drive back just to eat here. The fries and \"fry sauce\" are amazing. This is definitely a diamond in the rough. If you plan on visiting Hoover Dam make this a stop  on your way."}
{"text":"Lunch at about 2pm on a Sat.  Had a party of 7, restaurant not crowded looked to have 2 waitresses.  Ours seemed to have tunnel vision and not able to multi-task (but very nice)  Had to ask to get started on our drinks, then to come take our orders (this before the drinks ever arrived) and ask for the bill.  Good note was that the food was fantastic but would not go back due to service.  It should be 1,2,3 and more like 3,2,1.  If you are not in a hurry and know they aren't busy then go on in."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to go out for a good burger.  However it seems to be under new ownership.  I was not impressed.  Why did they get rid of the deep fried Twinkie's?!  Not as impressed as usual but still love this place.  I will give them another chance."}
{"text":"This place has great food. Came at lunchtime. Had the kobe burger while the wife had the pancake special. We kept eating each others food!! Thick cut bacon, fluffy pancakes, and a juicy burger were excellent."}
{"text":"Yum, yum, and yum!!! Have had a few things on their menu, all were great!! If you're in Boulder, you must eat here!! Great service, great atmosphere, great food! It's a bit rough looking on the outside, don't judge. :o)"}
{"text":"Ended up at Star Burger after I tried calling my bro in BC about dinner plans but he did not answer.  What a coincidence that he would be dining right down the road at Casa Flores...

 Tonight my GF tried the green chili burger.  It is one of the best damn burgers it has ever been my pleasure to taste.  My Red, White & Blue burger with home made curly fires was just as good as it always is."}
{"text":"Found this great place on Yelp while visiting Hoover Dam. It's awesome - and should be featured someday on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives.  My buddy and I both got the green chili angus beef burger, and we split their two varieties of French fries. The meal was fantastic!  And the staff are great people. They came over to chat with us about the place during our visit. Even the chef came out to show us a few \"burgers of the past\" photos from his iPhone, including one he said he made a while back for a biker with a huge appetite.  He claims the biker survived, although from the size of the burger one would have to wonder!  Great place - great people."}
{"text":"Excellent food and a great price.  Bacon burger and fries for less than $6.  How can you beat that price!

I put a four but this place is edging on the boarder of a five.  I found this location while coming back from Hoover Dam.  The place felt like something straight out of my youth.  The service was extremely friendly and the view out the window was of the town.

The food here was absolutely amazing the the price was great.  I must admit I couldn't eat here everyday, since most of the food is certainly not on any health list I've seen, yet that didn't stop me from having one the better burgers I've had in a while.  

A definite must stop if you are driving through Boulder City."}
{"text":"Eh, it was alright. I opted for the basic burger - single patty, lettuce, tomato, pickles, and \"star sauce\", with cheese. For the fries, I went with the curly fries.

The bad:
- No restrooms.
- Service, while friendly when it happens, was lacking.
- The lemonade, which was listed separately from the sodas, was just the crappy fountain pink \"lemonade\".
- The \"star sauce\" was no different than any other \"special sauce\". In fact, I'm pretty sure I have a bottle of it in my fridge.
- The toppings (lettuce, pickles, etc.) were not of good quality. 
- The burger itself was nothing of note - no great flavor, no juiciness.

The good:
- Free refills.
- Table service.
- Extra \"star sauce\" automatically comes with your order in a little plastic side cup, which was nice for fry dipping.
- It's got a dive-y, roadside feel to it that was nice.
- Ample parking.
- The curly fries, while a bit undercooked, had a good flavor.
- The menu was fairly sizable with plenty of burger, sandwich, and ice cream offerings.
- There's also a drive-thru.
- It probably is the best burger in Boulder City.

I would probably stop here again next time I am in the BC. However, I would not be inclined to order a burger."}
{"text":"Awesome! One of my favorite places to eat. I just wish it was closer. Nothing like this place in Vegas. Great burgers. Great fries and onion rings. Awesome soft serve ice cream. If you're out on a weekend drive, stop by."}
{"text":"NOTE:  This place hasn't closed as erroneously reported here,  but it has changed names.  It is now called the Little City Grill, same location:

{"text":"Quick!  Name another reason to go to Boulder City-other than taking a tour of Hoover Dam?  

Now you have one.....

Star Burger is the real deal!  From the outside, this place looks like a dump- let's not kid ourselves. After contemplating other options, my family and I gathered up the courage and headed in --expecting the worst. Instead, we were greated by a friendly staff and inviting dining area.

I decided to try the green chile burger and homemade curly fries. The burger itself was a good size and the bun was super soft. The burger comes with ranch on it, but I chose to have it on the side in case green chile and ranch was not a good combination. Surprisingly, I didn't even need the ranch.  The juicy burger, tomato, and green chile was tasty enough without it. 

The fries do not come with the burgers...... please take note. You will have to pay extra if you want either the curly fries or crinkle fries. Both were good- not great. The curly fries were a little overdone, and not seasoned as much as they could have been. 

My wife and daughter chose the regular bacon burger that came with a thousand island sauce on it. This burger was delicious as well, but I would recommend having the sauce on the side here too. The bun is soft, so the sauce on it almost makes it dissolve  by the end of your burger. 

We finished our meal by sharing a small chocolate/raspberry milkshake. If I wasn't lactose intolerant -I would have really enjoyed this more. The total was $50.00 for the family and was well worth it.

Bottom line, burgers are amazing and the service is good. We will be coming back -real soon."}
{"text":"I came here with 4 of my friends for lunch today.I got chicken fingers with crinkle fries,2 of my friends got blt's and the other 2 got bacon cheeseburgers.I just got water but my friend got a choco milk shake and it was yummy,standared but good.

Chicken fingers-personaly i dont think there as good as the ones at pitstop there smaller and you only get 4 of them but there not fatty or anything and its white meat

Fries-Ok these are kind of adicting they are crispy and yummy defently better looking then the curly fires.

Onion rings-my friend gave me hers from her baken burger becuase she didnt want it.It was defently crips and flavorful,the only down side was when you tryed to break it in half most of the onion came out with it,other then that very yumm i may get those next time

Star sause- The lady was very nice and gave us like 6 containers of it for our food.I personaly like this sause better then the fri sause at pit burger.It is sweeter and very very good! It tasted hella good on the fries and the onion ring.

ps;they have fried pickes for $ 4.something and i want to get those next time because they look good and ive never had them before.Its a little more expensive then pitstop on something,but others are cheaper,and most things come with a drink so thats good.Good place to eat ill come back."}
{"text":"I will start off with the fact that I was starving when I visited Star Burger (soon to be Little City Grille). I had the Bacon Burger ($5.39) with regular fries. It was super tasty. Nice soft bun, crispy onion ring and bacon, cheese nicely melted and the burger was very juicy. The fries came out hot and crispy and the fry sauce was pretty tasty too. Service was prompt and friendly. Goodly sized portions for the price."}
{"text":"Okay...let me just say that I had the best veggie burger I have ever had in my life last night. YUMMY!  Homemade, tasty, and healthful.  Not a processed, pressed pattie that was frozen prior to being cooked.  Little City Grille, formerly Star Burger, has knocked it out of the park with their scrumptious mix of veggies in this handcrafted vegetarian delight.  That coupled with the homemade curly fries made my not so good day bright again.  It's tough to be a vegetarian and find a great \"burger\" but Little City Grille delivers with theirs."}
{"text":"The staff is always friendly. Their kobe burger is THE BOMB!!! Love their soft serve ice cream."}
{"text":"Found this place on the way home from a visit to the Hoover Dam. I have to say I was a little nervous by the look of it, but my boyfriend insisted it was probably a local treasure so we stopped in. I hate to say he was right. The friendliest service! Even though I popped in about 15 times (we were sitting outside with a dog) with different requests, the girls working were so nice! 

We had the green chili burger, the 410 breakfast wrap and the curly fries. The burger and breakfast wrap were delicious and giant. We didn't even get through half of the wrap. The curly fries are what they're losing half a star for (the other half is for the rundown exterior). I LOVE curly fries and was pretty disappointed by the sogginess of theirs, especially when it said it was a house specialty. 

If you ever find yourself in Boulder City, definitely give them a try!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were drawn into this place by their signage that said \"HOMEMADE CURLY FRIES!\"  Sounds delicious, doesn't it?

This place has the old burger stand feel to it. When you enter through the front door, you are greeted and welcomed to grab a menu and sit where ever you like.  For us, we sat underneath the cool air conditioning vent.

The bathrooms are clean, the dining area is clean, the employees are cheery and very friendly.

My wife and I actually mirrored our orders off each other.  We both got:

- Kobe Burger with Swiss Cheese & Mushrooms
- Curly Fries
- A Drink
- Malt Shakes (I got chocolate, she got raspberry)

Everything was delicious.  The people there are super friendly and attentive to our needs. I had a great experience and made a great day even better!

My one tip for you yelpers is that the portions are HUGE!  My wife and I were not even half done when we looked at each other and moaned.  We could have easily just split the burger, fries and shake between us.

We are glad we didn't though.  Through stuffing ourselves and then finally admitting defeat, the leftovers were a beautiful reminder of the awesome food they have here.

I am a fan, I love it here. I will drive 40 miles and 1 hour from home just to come here again. And I will bring people, lots of people. ;)"}
{"text":"Heading to Boulder City, we decide to grab a bite before going antiquing. We drive by Star Burgers and it kinda had that old school burger joint look, so we decide to give it a shot.

Browsing the menu, I come across the Fried Egg Burger-SOLD! along with Onion Rings and a Vanilla Malt. Wifey gets a Bacon Cheeseburger with Crinkle cut fries and a Root Beer Float. The burgers here are pretty solid, but their \"Star Sauce\" tastes like nothing more than a mixtue of ketchup, mayo, and worcestershire...Service was great and so was our lunch!...ALOHA!!!!"}
{"text":"When I need a large peanut butter chocolate milkshake, a bowl of mac n' cheese, curly fries, chili and a greasy burger with thick cuts of kielbasa on top, then I go to Star Burgers. 

Even if I don't need all that, it's obligatory to drop in and order a large peanut butter chocolate milkshake when ever I am within ten miles of the vicinity.

Star Burgers is good at being what it is: a greasy burger and fatty milkshake diner in a cozy little town.

And they have bathrooms. Out back."}
{"text":"The food was great. I ordered the kobe burger but the waitress brought me the LeBron. Don't get me wrong, it was good enough to get to the playoffs, but it doesn't win a championship."}
{"text":"We discovered Star Burgers for dinner one evening while spending one night in BC at the Boulder Dam Hotel (fantastic historic place) on our way to visit my family in AZ over Christmastime 2011.  Hubby's cheeseburger was huge, well cooked, piled with fresh lettuce, tomato and onion with sides of their famous curly fries and coleslaw.  His soda was never empty.  I ordered the Clam Strip Basket served with cocktail sauce, curly fries, coleslaw (which I gave to hubby) and I added (for only $1.50 more) their homemade mac 'n cheese which was delicious!  I loved their thick chocolate shake served with the long spoon since the ice cream barely made it through the straw!  Yes the portions were big...hubby polished off his, but I had some clam strips left over.  Service was prompt and very friendly and we liked the old-fashioned burger dive feel to it. 

All-in-all a yummy burger joint experience.  We'll eat there again when we travel to see my family the end of this year."}
{"text":"found this place on our ride back from the dam and i ordered a Kiebasa burger and it was great. All the way to the bread to. Also got the crinkle fries with them and they where cooked perfect.
My wife hated her chicken sandiwch though :-("}
{"text":"When I go to Boulder City, I usually go to Pit Stop. Actually, that isn't true. I ALWAYS go to Pit Stop when I go to Boulder City. For me, Pit Stop was the king of Boulder's burgers. Now that I've visited Star Burger, I feel like a new king could be crowned. I'll need to do more research before saying that for sure, but at the very least they should be co-kings.

The burger selection at Star Burger is huge. They have Kobe burgers, burgers with eggs on them - all kinds of burgers! I ordered mine with an egg on it. They normally cook the eggs medium but will change it on request. I told them that I like my yolk a bit more runny and they happily obliged. The patty wasn't overcooked and had plenty of flavor. 

They have homemade curly fries, too. I rarely get fries when I eat unless they are something special. Curly fries are normally on the bottom of my \"something special\" fry list. My brother talked them up a lot so I ordered some. They did not dissapoint! Too often curly fries are hard as a rock, but these didn't have that issue. Maybe they could have been a little crunchier but they were still good. And they actually tasted like potatoes - a requirement the makers of most curly fries seem to forget about.

Star Burger has great food, friendly people and a lot of options. I'll be visiting this place again when I'm in Boulder. Pit Stop has well established itself as Boulder City's burger place, but if it's variety and something new you want, give Star Burger a try!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in here for a bite to eat on our way back to Phoenix from Las Vegas.  A little rough around the edges but its a pretty cool place.  The service was fantastic. Everyone was so friendly! We sat at the counter bar which was not the most comfortable spot but it was fun to watch people pull up to the drive thru window.  Also, we got to chit-chat with the waitresses and people picking up their takeout orders. This place does a pretty good business. It seems like there are a lot of very loyal regulars.

I have to admit that I was a little underwhelmed by the food but I think my expectations were just too high after reading all the soaring paises in the Yelp reviews. I got the chilli Mac and cheese which was decent but a little bland. Next time I will get a burger since my hubby really liked his.

fyi, the owner mentioned that they are going to be changing their name soon, but I can't remember now what the new name is, so I guess that's not very helpful. Something like City Grill, I think."}
{"text":"I went with three others who reported that their burgers were excellent.  We ate the grasshopper pie, which was darn good.  I don't eat meat so I had hoped to try the vegetarian burger, but they were all out.  My only other option was the grilled cheese and it was WAY too much cheese and therefore basically inedible for me.  So, if you are vegetarian, this is probably not a good option.  I'm still giving it 4 stars though because it is a burger joint, not a vegetarian restaurant."}
{"text":"Star Burger is changing it's name to the Little City Grille. Based on Yelp reviews and since I was heading to Arizona to buy lottery tickets I decided to give Star Burgers a try. 

Parking was a breeze and I was in the door fast. Once inside I immediately felt comfortable. I was met promptly, told to pick any place to sit that I wanted, and I had a menu and was being read the daily specials in no time. I ended up ordering the Green Chile Burger with avocado (again based on Yelp comments), with curly fries and ice tea. 

My food didn't take too long to make, and it looked good. I made it a point to try the Star Sauce but the fries and the sauce didn't really work for me. The fries could have been a bit crispier, and the sauce was a little too...well saucy, as in too creamy for me. It was good, but not great. The burger was juicy without being too much so. Being a green chile burger I expected a bit more heat, the nice woman who took my order said she ordered the avocado to take the heat out, but I was thinking it needed more heat, not less. Still it was good. 

I ordered a strawberry shake to go. I wish I could say it was something special but it's just another strawberry shake. They do offer pineapple ones and I wish I had tried that instead. 

Overall, while the fries and sauce were ho-hum, a good juicy burger and SERVICE with a SMILE wins me over again. 4 stars. Oh and they even asked for feedback and didn't give any attitude when I mentioned the fries. They care and it shows. I got a strong hunch I'll be back."}
{"text":"We went there after a day of window shopping in downtown Boulder City. 
This place has the feel of an old fashioned burger joint. 
The staff was very friendly. The kids menu is a good value. It comes with drinks and an ice cream cone. I had the chile burger which had a great flavor and wasn't too hot. The fries are fresh made on this contraption which makes really long, curly, shoestring fries. Nothing like fresh cut fries!!! 
I saw the Kobe burger for $10, next time I'm gonna get it! 

All in all, a good experience.. I will definitely go there again."}
{"text":"I give this place a huge thumbs up. It is a great spot to go to if you're looking for that one hidden place. Their burgers are a huge winner on the menu. Any burger. Pick one and I would tell you that it will rank as at least a top 5 burger on your list. Green chili burger, legit. Bacon burger, legit. I'm a huge fan."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PLACE!!

It's a MUST place to go after a great day on the lake! The portions are huge great for when your super hungry! The place itself is a warm and cozy old burger joint vibe and it only is only topped by the great service! Everyone there is always in a good mood and pleasant...I have never had my drinks go below half full! The homemade fries and burgers are to die for!!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a burger in Boulder this is a great bet and the place to stop. Recommended by a local ranger who I work with--who appreciates good food. Nice dinning area or there are picnic tables out back.  A local business with friendly service. Burgers were hand formed and  had a good sear and therefore good beefy taste (some places don't sear the meat very well and the patties tend to be more steamed cooked).  Very good cheese burger, crispy fries, and a coke + tax and tip, $10."}
{"text":"I was drawn to this place by the rave reviews and wanted to see how it compared to Pit Stop.  I was expecting a typical fast food set-up, but this is a homey sit-down joint with very friendly waitresses.  I ordered the mushroom and Swiss burger with fries and just like when I ordered the same thing at Pit Stop, there were canned mushrooms instead of fresh--is this a Boulder City thing?  Other than that, the food was tasty. I liked this place more than Pit Stop and will return, but I think I'll try the mac n cheese next time--there aren't mushrooms in that."}
{"text":"Awesome, awesome, awesome! Huge burger selection, friendly employees, such a cute little roadside stop! This is a great place to stop before or after a Hoover Dam tour. 

Favorite burgers were Red, White & Blue and also the Green Chile Burger. If you decide to get fries, get the fries AND drink combo. For whatever reason, it is 14¢ cheaper than getting just fries.

Overall, highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Came here after a visit to Hoover Dam. It's a fun place, the staff is very friendly. The burgers are handmade. I agree with others that the fries are not very crispy, so we went with the onion rings. Very good. My only complaint was we had trouble getting the check. We probably waited an extra 10 minutes, and that made us not order a cone to go."}
