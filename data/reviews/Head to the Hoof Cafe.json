{"text":"Had a Mediterranean Salad Plate with Lamb and it was very tasty. Lamb is not usually my first choice, but other patrons were raving about it, so I gave it a shot. It was great. I'd definitely order it again. Hummus was yummy, as was the cucumber salad, and the hot sauce. My only gripe was the amount of raw onions on my plate. I picked out the equivalent of an entire red onion."}
{"text":"Thank you Head to Hoof for supporting Red for Red today.  I have to say that the steak wrap is the most delicious thing I have eaten in a really long time.  It had a really good grilled wrap filled with grilled veggies, steak, French fries, and some really good sauce. In my yelp world I would have given you a 4 because it was a pretty long wait from ordering to get the food but it was SO worth it!  Every dish that was coming out of the window looked delicious. I split the wrap with a friend and we both wished we had the whole thing to ourselves."}
