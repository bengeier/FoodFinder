{"text":"Finally, I have found the perfect Pizza in our area. Not too salty. Real cheese. Absolutely delicious. Our new go-to got pizza delivery. And the menu looks good too. I'll be heading in to dine-in soon. Awesome."}
{"text":"I 'm happy to see that we have a good \"Greek\"  place near my place of residence . the  chicken souvlaki pita, and gyros are very good. The gyro meat has actual identifiable meat,  :-) Not that grayish minced meat that I\"ve seen at other places,,   The pizza has mucho cheese just like I like it, although I must  say I wasn't crazy about the sauce,   Portion sizes are not disappointing and the service is quick and friendly.  A definate repeat revisit."}
{"text":"Amazing, simply amazing!! we went in around 10:00pm on a Saturday night, we were all tired and cranky after a long drive from Toronto, but from the minute we walked to the minute we walked out, was one of the best food experiences we had in Montreal.  The portion sizes were generous, and by god they were filling!! we will definitely   be going back, the next time we are in town! and big shout out to Micheal!!! For the amazing service! :)"}
{"text":"Growing up, my dad used to take me to Pizza Dorion  and fondly recall stories of him and his friends hanging out here eating a large pizza, each. Things have changed and taking down a large all-dressed pizza with a side order of fries or a poutine are a thing of the past, now we share.   Pizza Dorion is pizza the way pizza should be. Baked to perfection with just the right amount of cheese. There's a reason this place has been around for decades, they know their stuff and do it right. Their price point is reasonable and the portions are adequate.  You go there for the food, not the decor, which is borderline tacky. Bt the food omg the food. One of my favorite poutines in a city known for its poutine.  One day I hope to take my kids there and share in the experience, much like my own dad did."}
{"text":"A new resto opened up less than a block away from my home and once I received their menu pamphlet I noticed that like all good places in Laval... it seems no restaurant can be limited to one sort of cuisine.  Everyone must have a complete pizza selection, a \"unique\" Italian section, not to forget the submarine selection along with all the different variety of comfort foods anyone may want such as burgers (beef or chicken!), fries, poutine and hotdogs. Heck, there's even a FISH section if you crave some fish & chips. You want it, they got it.  Really?  Oh well, I immediately ordered from them and after two experience with them, I can confidently state that they indeed offer some quality Greek food yet our ordering experiences rarely limited us to only ordering Greek food.  Our experiences are :  - The chicken souvlaki pitas are very good and probably the best we can order unless we leave our homes to go eat at Marathons in Chomedy. Every time we order, this is a MUST HAVE!  - The pizza (All Dressed) was a decent Quebecois styled meal that had the right amount of topping and sauce but the dough felt off.  - The submarine (Le Quebecois) was disappointing. It lacked something... substance...quality... flavor? Needless to state, the weakest thing I've ordered from them. I've since this review tried the carnivore several times and it's excellent. So unsure if the first experience was an off night but it has since been excellent.  - Fries were decent, nothing to write home about. Portion was about right.  - Onion rings were crispy and tasty, yet the portion was a bit limiting sadly.  The price-tag is average.  Will order again.  DEM PITAS!!!"}
{"text":"I've heard many good things about this joint but my small experience was far from pleasant. I ordered some delivery from the joint and I only got the order 1.5 hours later. The restaurant is down the street and I didn't order much. My food arrived burned and very cold. See the pictures and you tell me if that Pizza looks appetizing. The poutine is very bad, and the pizza a major let down, go to L'Ã©toile instead."}
{"text":"Everything on the menu is absolutely delicious. I crave this pizza and routinely drive over 40 min to satisfy it. Gryo and salad is so so good! Don't overlook this great restaurant"}
{"text":"Best pizza ever! these guys are awesome. can't wait to order \"the Dorian special\" again."}
