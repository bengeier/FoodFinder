{"text":"1. Employees are often rude and unprofessional when greeted at POS stations, they will often not respond to \"how are you?\" and will often just blankly stare at you. 
2. While all Barret Honors Dining Hall Aramark employees are professional acting and fluent English speakers, whereas other dining halls this is not the case for the employees? The language barrier is a health and safety concern as allergens cannot be properly conveyed when requested.
3. Employees working at food stations tend to stand in back of station, acting busy and avoiding eye contact with guests, to avoid having to retrieve their food. This is especially prominent at the grill stations. They act as though they are immune from any employer discipline for wrongdoing.
4. Employees scuff when asked for an entre at a food station. Often will not say anything after being told \"thank you\" and will toss plate at you under sneeze guard while staring at you.
5. Guests often do not of options at food stations such as tomatoes or lettuce on hamburgers, because they are not clearly displayed on glass and employees often close lids to obstruct view of those items.
6. Employees are often not in correct uniforms, sometimes wearing MLB caps. I have seen POD workers, and other Aramark employees not wearing identifying name badges.
7. I witnessed a POD employee drop a sleeve of unwrapped ICEE cups on ground and then proceed to refill the cup dispenser with those contaminated cups.
8. I have received dirty, coated beverage cups from the \"clean\" cup racks, this is a health and safety concern and is often a warning sign that dishes are not being properly sanitized.
9. The soda fountains do not have ice machines for some reason and on a daily bias run out of ice, and sometime are just completely out of operation. Nearly every day I need to select my third or fourth choice of drink simply because only water comes out, meaning the BIB (bag in box) needs to be changed.
10. There are often no utensils necessary to eat a meal available to guests, they are only put out in limited batches and I have been dining where there wasn't a single one for in the entire dining establishment. There are no utensils at grill station.
11. Menus posted to sneeze guards often contain unavailable or had never been available items.
12. Sun Devil Dining and Aramark seem to cater to the \"vegan\" crowd, while removing food options for other guests, most likely because transitioning to this type of food is cheaper than serving traditional food, but at the same costs to all guests? 
13. The single limited condiment station is out of sauces on an hourly basis, I once notified an employee there was no condiments to which she assured me \"Yes, yes, I get someone\". After waiting for 10 minutes no employee had come to correct the issue.
14. Employees often seem to be sent on break during key operational periods (lunch/dinner \"rush\") and will be seen lounging around on cell phones while stations will often form extremely long lines.
15.  Consistently there are several employees on \"cleaning duty\" simply wiping down tables when long lines at food stations, but somehow the dining hall is consistently in unclean condition.
16. Guests often complete the surveys asking what they would like to see improved but Sun Devil Dining / Aramark have not acted on a single one of these suggestions.
Overall, the dining experience with Sun Devil Dining / Aramark has been the worst ever seen on any university or institution campus, and it seems to stem from the employee/company culture of \"we have your money, what are you going to do about it?\" 
Immediate change is needed or will result in sharing of these findings to prospective students, and if deemed necessary local and state health and safety organizations.

{"text":"Where do I start? Do I start with the pizza that makes Little Cesar's look like luxury or with the hotel eggs served with pancakes I had to ask and make sure we're pancakes. 

Actually I'll start where I start every time I walk in; with the friendly staff that swipe my card and grin at me when I say thank you. Now that's what I call service! Then I make my way to grab a slice of pizza and carefully find the pizza slice with the least amount of burned cheese on it. Then I usually walk over and grab myself a chicken sandwich because that's the only thing that tastes good in the entire dhall. After that, I set my plates down and start praying that the soda machine is actually working today because half of the time water comes out of almost all of the soda slots. I would mention the Mexican food and vegan choices but I haven't tried them yet because they make McDonald's look like a 5 star restaurant. 

Overall, just a great place to eat. I'm really looking forward to eating here for the next 7 months of my freshman year."}
{"text":"Recognizing that if you're not an ASU student, staff member, or faculty member, you will likely not be visiting a residence hall dining center, Hassayampa has found a good way to put many tastes together in an all-you-care-to-eat meal.  Hassayampa is a residence hall on the southeast corner of the ASU Tempe Campus.  In addition to eight buildings housing about 1800 students, there is The UPS Store, Subway, a marketplace, tutor center, and several academic offices.  Then there is the Hassayampa Dining Center!  

Though there is a coffee shop and a fancier dining center in the Barrett complex nearby, Hassayampa has a slightly lower price than Barrett.  The service is good with helpful managers.  They get feedback from students and make changes as often as they can.  For instance, they started serving individual personal pan pizzas with YOUR choice in toppings instead of the three types of large pizzas they previously made (and gave by the slice).  They also took student feedback to serve cage-free eggs and to change the dining hours.  

The food stations change menus daily and include a deli, soup, home station, grill, salad bar, international entrees and vegetarian/vegan entrees.  Semester hours are Monday through Thursday from 7 AM to 9 PM, Friday from 7 AM to 7 PM, Saturday from 8 AM to 7 PM, and Sunday from 8 AM to 8 PM.  

Where else can I go to lunch, get a sandwich made my way, a small salad, some french fries, and a bowl of cereal with a banana to go?"}
