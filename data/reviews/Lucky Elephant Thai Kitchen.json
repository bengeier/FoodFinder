{"text":"Some of the dishes are really good, but sorry i cannot remember the name, one of my favourite is the duck dish served  in a coco ,"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch special and ordered Pad Thai and another lunch special. In all honesty, i didnt like how they cook it, too saucy, too reddish. My daugther didnt even eat half of her meal.  Didnt finish my meal and I wont be coming back. Sorry i tasted better Thai foods."}
{"text":"You want authentic great tasting thai food made from a real asian chef, then this is the place to go! my fav is the basil chicken among many other of their delightful dishes."}
{"text":"Slow service and had to go to get our own receipt at front register, but food was all-in-all quite good, with an exception. Also prices were decent.

I was a tad upset where they were helping customers that came in after m'lady and I arrived. Also, I wasn't a fan of them cooking with ketchup (looking over the counter you could see their kitchen, and the humongous can of ketchup they had confirmed my suspicions).

In terms of having to get my own receipt, basically they left the bill on the table and then disregarded us, so ended up having to go to the counter to pay, as they kept helping other customers and then not coming back out from behind the counter when they weren't helping others.

All-in-all aside from the food being made with ketchup, the food was quite decent as were the prices, so I'd most likely be willing to try them again if I was in the area."}
{"text":"My first time coming here and I'd say the price is reasonable. I got the chicken pad that with spring roll for lunch special and it's $5.95. The chicken is nice and tender. The noodles might be a bit too saucy for some, but that's how I like my pasta/noodles. The place looks clean and cozy. I'd go back here again."}
{"text":"This place is the real deal. If you love Thai curry this is the place to get it. It's a small restaurant, but quaint. The staff are attentive and the menu is quite extensive with lots of vegetarian options."}
