{"text":"Oh! This place is soooooo gooooooooood. Brunch buffet is absolutely ridiculous - prime rib on Sunday, every kind of breakfast food you can imagine, for a little extra you get all you can drink mimosas, cinnamon rolls are awesome.  For dinner I was a huge fan of the cheddar burger (you get a ton of shredded cheddar on top) and the prosciutto pizza. Beer was great too.  Service is typical. Decent prices. Food is fricking awesome."}
{"text":"Love the food here! Always delicious and their happy hour prices are great, I always get the flatbread pizza. Beer is delicious and they have something for everyone. Also if you work in the mall they will deliver your food to you! Great for when someone calls in and you can't leave the store to get dinner!!  Service is always excellent and I recommend it to a lot of my customers passing through openly talking about where to go for dinner or lunch."}
{"text":"The food was great. The prices are reasonable and service was outstanding. My favorite go to place in Madison."}
{"text":"The service was awesful! My boyfriend and I went there for a nice dinner and the food was very good but the service was the worst either of us had had. Our waitress was not personable at all. She did not bring us any water, we had to ask another waitress for some because she didn't bring us any and we didn't see her after she seated us. It took the other waitress a good 10 or so minutes to bring us water, everyone it seemed was super slow.  It took them almost an hour after we ordered to bring us our 2 cups of soup and the apitizer we ordered. And when we got the apitizer she was not the one to bring it to us, 2 separate waiters did. Then she finally came and checked ok us after we had finished our apitizrs to make sure everything was ok. Then the food came a half hour later. Then, yet again, she did not check in with us until our meal was finished. When she came over to see how we were, she didn't even ask if everything was ok, just if we were ready for a to go box. Also, as we were leaving she dis not even say goodbye or havw a good night, just walked right by without a word. It was very frustrating because the food was very good, but know one one seemed to care hoe we were doing or if we needed anything. I would not go back there again because I  could get the same quality food else where with better service, and to me dining out isn't just about the taste of the food, it's about the whole exerpeience, and this one was not a good one. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Granite City on a whim after we hit the Dick's shop in Legacy Village on the same trip. After a quick look at their menu, we decided to pop in for an early dinner.  Granite City is a great place to go for a meal, for sure! My husband had the peppercorn burger and I had their vodka mussels. For our starter, we had the red pepper hummus, which was delicious. All-in-all, their food was great. Their vodka sauce is amazing and paired with the toast that came with the mussels - a definite must order.  Their craft beers are also quite tasty. I had the Batch 1000 and was impressed. Just the right amount of hoppiness to it.  I would definitely visit this place again."}
{"text":"I was with a group of 12 for brunch. I'm not a huge fan of brunches as I feel I pay way too much for food I don't really care for.  I don't normally get an omelet. The line was short so I went for it. I am so glad I did! I think it was the best omelet I've had in a very long time. The gentleman running the station was polite and very  proficient. I was impressed. Everything else was good. Fresh fruit, bacon, cinnamon rolls, and everything else other people eat. I wad told there was a pasta station, which I never saw so I can't help you out there. I would recommend for brunch or any other time for food.  I have not been disappointed yet."}
{"text":"Amazing costumer service and food was super quick. Server was great and general manager was very friendly. Very impressed."}
{"text":"Wicked good brunch! They have good beers, great portions and fair prices. I have always had fast and friendly service. If you are going to try this place don't miss the Sunday brunch, you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"Simply put, great food, fine beer, and a killer brunch! Definitely have to try all the Flatbread pizzas.  Took a growler of the Two Pull with me before I exited."}
{"text":"First time coming here, it is a Friday night 9 pm, not super busy but they did have a couple large tables. We got the server with large table, they should have given us to a different server. She was busy and really didn't come back after we ordered our food. It took 45 minutes to get our appetizers we ordered as our dinner. Mine was burnt, cold and overall hard to eat. My other half was ok with his flatbread. I was able to flag her down while she was bussing he table to order dessert is been 10 minutes to get to the table and now that her large table is gone she had time to be friendly and give us a bill. The cookie was over cooked and super hard to get out of the pie tin and it was cold so that the ice cream didn't even melt. The other dessert my other half enjoyed. Overall not a good first visit. Probably won't come back either with all the other choices out there."}
{"text":"First time I've been to Wisconsin in 45 years. Flew in to Madison and came to Granite City for dinner. Had my heart set on beer cheese soup, and they didn't disappoint. Rich, creamy, with a wonderful balance of the cheddar cheese and the beer. Heaven!  The beer battered fish and chips also hit the spot. Super light flavorful batter. Great friendly service by Rachel. Thanks for the wonderful experience."}
{"text":"I felt bad for the servers, there was only so much they could do. The table beside me had an issue with their food and she was scrambling. My chicken was dry but I didn't want to overwhelm my server. She was very nice and I was trying to be too. My family ate here two years ago and it was night and day better. I may give it another chance if I'm dying of starvation, but given the choice I may just choose starvation. Try the beer, they can't screw that up"}
{"text":"I read the reviews and didn't expect much. I was pleasantly surprised. Food was good and service was friendly. I had the pork chops and they didn't dissapoint."}
{"text":"I went to Granite City today for their Sunday Brunch.  I usually go twice a month.   The brunch is very tasty and has a lot of variety.   Today, I had a bad experience.  I showed up at 10:30 a.m. and asked for a table of one.  The hostess said they were very busy and that I needed to sit at the bar.  I told her that I need to sit at a table.   She said  they did not have anything available.  I initially walked out the door, but then I came back and said that i would sit at the bar.   When I went to the buffet line, I noticed that they had 10 empty spots, including 6 tables.   Every guest entering the restaurant behind me were seated, including two tables.  During the time that I was there every guest coming into the door were seated at either a table or booth.  I told the bartender about my experience.  She was going to tell the manager.   She also said that she spoke to the hostess.  The hostess claims there were no servers available to wait on someone at a table.  The hostess lied because every guest entered the restaurant was allowed to sit at a table or a booth.   As a disabled person with a muscle movement disability, I'm disappointed with the way that I was treated.  I don't think asking to sit at a table is too much to ask a restaurant.   I would have waited for a table, but they did not even offer it."}
{"text":"I love brew pubs, and was looking forward to dining at this one.  It's a very nice place, very large, inviting, and crowded.  Our server was pleasant.  We ordered burgers and fish and chips.  The food arrived promptly but it was not up to the usual pub food.  It was fairly tasteless, under seasoned, greasy (fish) and the bleu cheese burgers didn't have any bleu cheese.  I ordered Bennie beer and was very disappointed.  The description said it was a dark German lager, very hoppy, caramel overtones.  It was watery tasting and almost flat, no overtones let alone caramel ones.  When we needed our server to come and get dessert/coffee orders he didn't turn up.  We saw him in a group of servers standing right behind us watching the basketball game on TV and chatting with one another, totally ignoring customers.  I hate it when that happens as it means the servers are not well-trained and the manager is either tolerating their behavior or just not available to see what was happening.  With a crowd like they had, the servers should be hustling, but they were mostly ignoring everything but the TV and each other.  They need to try harder in every respect as I think the place has lots of potential but they aren't getting the basics right."}
{"text":"Ok, Ok. I know 5-stars for a chain? I must be smoking something.......   Don't be a food snob, it can happen and it does happen with Granite City.   The appetizers, I can only vouch for the spinach artichoke dip. We first came here several ago and ordered this and haven't stopped. It's that good. It was so good that I called the kitchen manager and bought some for last thanksgiving (which was a big hit)........mmmmm.... It has the perfect blend of ingredients. So cheesy! YUM!   Soups-the french onion is great, a really nice deep onion flavor, and of course the slab of melted cheese on top can't hurt. (have i mentioned that I LOVE cheese?   the main courses. We have tried most of their menu. The sandwiches-cuban and overlake-the ciabatta bread they use is good, and the meat is a good quality. simply a good sandwich. The signature selections we tried have been good, better than all chains you find the area.   but now the real reason you should eat at Granite City. The have the BEST HAMBURGERS!! Please for food's sake order the Bedda Chedda Bacon Burger, with a side of reggiano hashbrown casserole. OH MY GOD! When they bring it to your table, your mouth will be wide open, eyes wide open and parts of you will tingle in ways that Homer Simpson would recognize. ALL OF THAT and you haven't even had the first bite. It is simply the best. the best.   The desserts-we have only ordered for birthday occasions. because with the food they serve it is impossible to save room. The chocolate cake is very good, and worth ordering.   The Sunday brunch-the reggiano hashbrowns make this brunch worth going to. The eggs are nicely cooked-not gross like you get at most buffets, the biscuits are hit and miss, gravy average, the french toast are ok the strawberry syrup is yummy! and the eggs Benedict are very good. try the one with spinach artichoke dip.   Service-We go there every couple of weeks or so and have gotten to know some of the staff. They have always been consistent, pleasant and prompt.   The only negative is that its a 40 minute drive away."}
{"text":"They do not actually make beer.  They only ferment wort.  I had the ribeye, which was not seasoned at all, and was a very poor cut of meat.  It was cooked by someone who has no idea what a good steak is. The beer is not that good, the Duke being their best example.  The service was excellent, but does not make up for the lousy food and lousy beer.  Granite city beer taste results: Northern:  Warm water with a hint of beer. Bennie:  Well balanced lager, caramel notes, watered down. Two Pull:  Watered down Bennie. Kolsh:  Sour, sharp hops, yeasty Belgian: bitter, lacking malt taste, salty aftertaste, probably a bad batch die to lack of sanitation. Duke:  Sierra Nevada clone with a bit more hop characteristic.  Cascade hops. Not too heavy.  Excellent beer."}
{"text":"Another waste of time and money in Madison's west side brunch desert. Hungover staff, bins of cheap food and $10 bloody marys. Yikes."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the blueberry wheat beer quite a lot!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and great food. Highly recommend this place, it's well worth the money."}
{"text":"Love this place. Blue peppercorn burger...amazing.  Their blue cheese dressing is so much better than any I have ever had. The Adult Mac-n-cheese is heaven. Love the 2 pull beer. Overall, great experience. Surprisingly, they are not actually attached to the mall. Keeps it less hectic. Easy going atmosphere with large portions. Parking was readily available. Great experience. We will be back."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty standard bar food. Nothing stands out. The fries could use some little blue pill assistance, if you know what I mean.  I tried the french onion soup. The broth was salty but lacked other flavors, and whoever cut the onions left some of the outer skins in the batch. The worst part was the piece of plastic in the soup, cut exactly to the size of the chewy outer onion skins.  While the waitress and the manager did come over to apologize, they also took the time explain several times that the plastic was likely from the cheese wrapping. It almost sounded like an excuse, like it happens all the time. I don't care where it came from - I just care that I almost ate it. While they offered a new bowl, I was near the end of the bowl I had, so it seemed pointless to accept a new one.   After several apologies, we expected at least that the soup or our appetizer would be comped. But alas, no such service to be found here.   With so many amazing dining options in Madison, I don't know why anyone would choose this place."}
{"text":"My family and I were looking for a new place to try after the Badgers game and found Granite City. I heard many good things about this place, but we were very disappointed!!!  I wish I could give 0 stars. Our server was extremely slow and was not interested in getting our order correct at all. We were sitting in the bar section and couldn't understand the service issue considering it was 3 pm when the restaurant was not crowded at all. My daughter ordered the Chicken wrap with garlic mashed potato. I ordered the Bedda Chedda Bacon Burger. The food was ice cold and when I asked the woman that brought our food for ketchup she told me that we need to ask our server!! Justin was not available so I went to the bar and asked for the ketchup from the bartender.  I couldn't wait to get out of there. Not sure what's going on in this place, but they need to get their act together. Don't even want to give them another chance. Lousy food and bad service. I will not be going back there again."}
{"text":"The only reason I keep coming back to this restaurant it's their classic hamburguer, it is the most plain one they have but it is good! In my opinion, it's the best burguer in town and believe me, I have tried many in Madison, the meat has such a great grilled flavor, the bun has a nice golden brown color and if u ask for sautéed onions it tastes even better! They used to have thin French fries and I liked them a lot but they changed those for the thick ones and it is not the same  their potato chips are good. However, they need to work in their customer service, there have been many times that I placed an order over the phone and they made my order wrong, they either did not put lettuce and tomato or they put the wrong side, besides, they made you wait a lot to correct the mistake. They really should work on that!"}
{"text":"The only thing worse than the atmosphere was the food. Food came out cold. The minestrone soup tasted like Campbell's condensed. When I got my flatbread pizza it was cold and underwhelmingly seasoned unless you count the extra crunch of the FINGERNAIL I found in it. Needless to say I didn't finish my meal and leaving the restaurant was the highlight of my visit. The wait staff was great if you could hear them over the screaming in the kitchen. Ate here a year ago and food was good don't know what happened but bring the old chef back!"}
{"text":"My family ate here Sunday.  We arrived at 5:20 and were told it was a 10 minute wait even though there were dozens of open tables.  After waiting 20 min. I complained and we were finally seated.  The service was slow and receiving our food even slower.  I had an Asian salad with chicken.  The salad was a prepackaged bag salad which was brown and wilted and the chicken was sliced lunch meat.  The rare avocado cheeseburger my husband ordered was VERY well done and had no avocado.  The server finally brought 3 tiny brown slices of avocado and charged us $1.50.  Our son's medium rare cheeseburger was also well done yet the cheese not melted.   The food, service and the dining experience were awful."}
{"text":"Great brunch, albeit not a huge offering, the prime was excellent, several different kinds of fruit, eggs ben in several different incarnations, hashbrowns reggiano were all notable, in addition to more standard brunch fare.  And when they say spicy bloody mary, be prepared for a lot of tabasco."}
{"text":"walked in on rainy day; floor materials very slippery, fortunately  I have great balance.  Ordered  the House IPA draft beer during posted happy hour.  It was just so-so, for an IPA, for which there's a ton of great competition.  Barmaid billed me $12, when I was expecting like 4, so she was like \"whoops! gave you someone else's bill\" then gave  me a bill for full price beer; I asked why not happy hour price. \" Oh, that's not one of our happy hour beers.\"  Clientele also didnt interest me as much as other nearby places, so I won't be back, even if someone else is paying"}
{"text":"It's really not often that I write reviews for restaurants but this place is a must! Zero for this place!!!....., our waitress was rude, ordered drinks when I got there and got them when I payed the bill!! Workers setting up being loud next to our group even though closing time was hours away...Bad experience, really bad service only positive thing was when I got the bill so I could leave!"}
{"text":"There were a few times in my life I've been unhappy with a restaurant, unfortunately this was one of those times.   It's been awhile since I've been there, but historically I like a couple of their menu items and drinks. Of course, the 2 items I knew I liked were taken off the menu and 1 was only available at lunch (not their fault) and the Flying Monkey drink was watery with no flavor, and I'm pretty sure very little alcohol.   The server was newer, not a problem, she  just didn't know the menu well- didn't know what items were made of and what adaptations could be made for my daughter's allergy. I know special requests are annoying and I always feel amazingly guilty for being a challenge. The server didn't leave us with an empty glass, which gave my satisfaction a boost.  The server recommended the Adult Mac n Cheese.  The sauce was good, albeit a bit salty. The meat had no flavor. The menu item itself was blah in color and I feel it should have come with bread.   My daughter was unable to eat her Cajun Pasta. I told the server of the situation, and she responded \"oh, I'm sorry\". I'm not saying I didn't want to pay for the meal, because I would have insisted I do, I just expected more of a response for better customer service. My daughter was embarrassed (she's a teen) and didn't know what other options were available and the server didn't help with that much. Ultimately, she ordered an additional side of fries (which of course we were charged for).  My son was happy with the few bites he took of the specialty cheeseburger folks rave about,  though he commented how greasy it was, which made it difficult to eat. That being said,  he's a tween, and not a big eater.  Sad to say,  I left stressed and with a hungry kid. Paid almost $70, it just wasn't worth it."}
{"text":"This place has decent American food, but it's not the place to go if you want gourmet dishes. The fries and burgers are fine, but it's a bit pricey for what you get. Sometimes the flavors aren't there, but like I said, it's not gourmet food."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!! It's my  go to dinner place. I've tried almost everything there, good is great, beer recommendations are good and the staff is super helpful and nice! If you can't think of a place to go and don't want Mexican/Italian/whatever... granite city is always the best option in my opinion."}
{"text":"THE FOOD IS HEAVY, GREASY, SALTY, MASSIVE, OVERCOOKED, DEVOID OF SUBTLTY.  With dozens of fine, independent eateries in all of the Cleveland Metro area, why settle for mass-produced, formulaic, feed-bag food like this?  I think even Applebees is better. We tried GC only because we had a gift card from a friend.   They claim that their food is freshly made, but they kill that freshness by overworking it. The artichoke and spinach app was more cheese than A & S, and the bread was unnecessarily saturated with butter. Spread the fat on the fat!  The flatbread pizza was decent, and the beet salad was probably the best item we had.  Each was large enough to be full meals on their own, maybe even too large. The chicken, ham and aspargagus linguini was not balanced - too heavy on the meat and sundried tomatoes and too light on the pasta and asparagus. There was way too much going on with the topping, and several big flavors were competing against each other. There was a strong anise flavor that was, ironically, off-putting just to the one of us who likes that flavor otherwise.    It was surprisingly busy on a Tuesday evening, but the service was polite and efficient, if a bit robotic. Our server seemed detached while she recited what seemed like a memorized script. But with the noisy and bustling ambiance, it was not conducive for being personable. Later, she separated our leftover flatbread into individual pieces and piled it sloppily into a mound in a small take-out box, and the dressing for the salad was dumped on the salad leftovers, instead of being put into a lidded cup. We saw others walk out with large flat boxes in the shape of the flatbread, and I assume they were carrying their leftovers. Well, at least our carbon footprint was smaller.  The cavernous space lacks any intimacy, unless you can score a booth or that rare table in a relatively secluded spot. The loud music was a good selection that seemed geared toward baby-boomers. We didn't check out the restrooms, which can give you a good indication of the general cleanliness of a restaurant, but the rest of the restaurant seemed clean. Lighting is fine, not too dark or too bright.   In the end, we would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Pretty good for a chain. Good food, great brunch, ($7.99 bottomless mimosas? Sign me up) and great beer.  Brunch is a buffet that's a little pricey, but is full of awesome food. Their pizza/flatbreads are good for bar food, and the wings are not bad."}
{"text":"I was happy they were able to accommodate our party of 14 on a Sunday evening. The two servers were nice, but the food took a really long time to come out even considering the size of our party. My wife ordered Chicken Alfredo and she liked it during dinner, but felt sick later at home. Not sure if it was the pasta but whatever. I tasted the pasta she had and it did taste good to me. I ordered the Bleu cheese burger with onion strings. I have never tasted a burger devoid of taste than the one I was served. The burger could not have been seasoned. All I tasted was the bacon and onion strings. The fries were basic. Three other people in our party ordered burgers and they felt the same way. My mom ordered the Honey steak and it was over cooked on the edges.   They place looks immaculate, and its very big. But I probably wouldn't return. I definitely wouldn't get a sandwich."}
{"text":"I'd really wanted to like this place, but it just isn't happening. Family has eaten here several time and we've had excellent meals (burgers in particular), but not consistently. There is always something wrong: burger over cooked, cold food, orders not correct. If a restaurant is going to charge the higher prices, I expect consistently good food and service - not hit and miss."}
{"text":"I came here on Sunday for brunch to cure my hangover. There was a 15 minute wait - not too bad. The restaurant was very spacious with high ceilings, and the tables were not too close to each other (major plus). Our waiter was friendly and prompt. However, one of our coffees had a mysterious gross-looking brown stain inside the cup. Our waiter exchanged it for us right away, but still. Also, he didn't tell us ahead of time that OJ's are not refillable, so we paid for two OJ's in the end...  Anyway, the food was really good, way better than the standard buffet that I expected. A lot of the selection is greasy though: fruit (melon, grapes), scones, croissants, cesar salad and another salad, scrambled eggs, poached eggs, biscuits and gravy, bacon, sausage, cheesy potatoes, prime ribs. We also got a huge warm cinnamon bun per person at our table... it was delicious!  All in all, not a bad experience... I only had one and a half plate and was completely full! It didn't come as a surprise when I saw lots of overweight people in the restaurant... this is the best place to go for brunch if you have a big appetite!"}
{"text":"Eh, My fiancée and I tried Granite City and were disappointed.  We did sample most of Granite City's beer for $5 which was a decent value however they did not have all their regular brews available.  Eventually the bar tender went to work for us and got the stout added to the sampler which was the best beer on tap.   The food at Granite City mediocre at best.  I had the popular BBQ cheddar burger featuring a beef patty was squished down and was very thin.  My fiancée had some chicken sandwich that was nothing to rave about either.  We choose to eat in the outdoor beer garden but were seated at the unleveled table that was hiked up by a big staff of beer coasters- always a pet peeve of mine.  The staff was friendly but at times slow.  Unless we can meet up with Paul Blart, Mall Cop for a beer we probably won't come back."}
{"text":"Mac and cheese is awesome! Service was fabulous. I will be back to try the burgers next."}
{"text":"This is an update from my previous review from 3/1/2010.   I am done with Granite City. There is nothing redeeming about it anymore. Even though it's been years since they discontinued it, I'm still sad that you don't get a small loaf of sourdough bread before your meal anymore. It was so tasty.  My bf and I used to order soups to-go and pay for extra bread because it was so good.   Now onto my most recent dining experience: The hostess seemed very annoyed to be there. The menu has been revamped and I was disappointed with the current selection. The table we were seated at was clean-looking but sticky; the silverware wouldn't even slide across the table. The beer was mediocre. My bf ordered a stout but it had a very mild flavor - not what you'd expect from that type of beer. I ordered an appetizer of pretzels with beer/cheese sauce and then beer cheese soup with dinner. I'm pretty sure the dipping sauce was exactly the same as the soup.   Overall, I'm very disappointed in the turn this restaurant has taken in the past few years. I used to love going here but will not return."}
{"text":"Had dinner here with some friends. Great decor however can't say the same about the food and the service.   I'm convinced that they make all the food extra salty so that you keep ordering more beer. All of the different 4 dishes that we ordered they were all salty. Ingredients were not fresh in our salad not too mention the salad was soaked in dressing making it very soggy. French fries were cold. Server was slow. Did not get us our water for over 15 minutes.   By the way this was our second time going and the first time was just as bad. We just thought we should give it another chance before boycotting this place  Definitely won't be going back"}
{"text":"This place is OUTSTANDING!  I had their asian salad and that might be one of the best salads I have ever had.  Have also had their brunch which is outstanding.  Probably the best thing on their menu is the Ruben sandwich.  It is the best sandwich I have ever had in this area!  The pricing is fair and the bloody mary's are awesome!!  Great service as well.  I would highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"We visited in the afternoon on Sunday, 7/31/16.  It was not busy at all.  The food was good, the service was well below average.  We were not asked if we wanted additional drinks.  We were not asked if we were interested in  dessert.  The check was dropped off at our table after we had our first few bites and we never saw the waitress again until she picked up our credit card.  Since she was not interested in our business, we left and went somewhere else for another round.  It seemed to us that our waitress could not get rid of us  fast enough.   Very disappointing. Update.  Immediately after writing my review, I recevied an auto reply asking me to describe my experience.  It was supposedly from the owner.  I replied back and explained the sub-standard experience.   It has been over a week and have not heard anything back.  It is safe to assume that I am not a valued customer and that it really does not  matter that I had a negative experience.  I don't think it even matters to the owner  if I return."}
{"text":"I've been here many times and have had a variety of different things. I typically go during their happy hours, for $3.25 beers (and their beers are 20oz, bigger than most places) and I get the Bennie which is pretty good. For the food, I've gotten the Cajun Pasta a number of times which I quite like. I've also gotten sandwiches, steak, and other things, which are mainly just okay. The steak ended up a bit dry and overcooked (I ordered Medium, I got more like Medium-Well) and the asparagus that I paid extra for was like 8 small spears. I haven't had anything here that was really bad though, and it's got a lot of options so it should be agreeable to groups."}
{"text":"While waiting for our table we thought we'd go over to the bar for a beer, almost impossible to get served! The bar was full of people eating and nowhere to flag the bartender. It took way longer than normal to get seated, we had to ask several times. They gave 3 people a booth that could have fit our group of six. The food was good but with the seating time I don't know how soon we will go back. The pork chops are great, and the chocolate cake is wonderful!"}
{"text":"so glad I did not pay attention to many of the previous reviews - i almost didn't go based on so many bad ones - However - we went on a Sat afternoon @ 3pm - we were seated immediately - our server came over and said that it was shift change and he would go get his replacement so that she could take care of us from start to finish.  Very nice young lady - attentive without being overbearing.  My husband ordered their BBQ burger - cooked rare and it was served as ordered - I had a cup of the cheddar/beer soup - it was OK - have had better but I enjoyed their version.  I also ordered the shrimp tacos with the glaze on the side - came with the glaze and it was replaced very quickly - so glad I had the spicy glaze on the side.  The pico that came with the taco was spicy enough - the glaze was firey hot - too hot for my taste.  We were not rushed but never had to wait either - drinks refilled as needed, check brought when we were done.  Will return again."}
{"text":"I joined my family for a large dinner of 20 people. With that said, I could understand there being a certain level of confusion for our waitress.  She was never rude, however she never came around other then taking our initial order. We couldn't order drinks the entire evening unless we flagged her down.    The wrapped silverware was clearly dirty and my cousin sitting next to me had a hair in her food.  Once we tracked the server down they were quick to bring her a new dinner and give us clean silverware.  I had the chicken chopped salad and thought it was pretty good.   The atmosphere is the only reason this place got 2 stars. It is huge and beautifully decorated. There are multiple fireplaces and the bar is great! And it also was really clean, other than the silverware.    If they could get there act together this place could be great.  Maybe there under staffed for a place this big."}
{"text":"Granite City is easily one of my favorite restaurants in Madison.  The food is always, always good. If something does happen to be wrong with your meal it is fixed immediately. Options for everyone and quality is good across the board.  Their beer is good as well, my favorite is the two pull which is a mix of their lager and bock.   My suggested dishes: Chicken Bruschetta Salad, Blue Peppercorn Burger, and the Chocolate Cake."}
{"text":"After a long work week, I stopped into Granite City for a Friday Night dinner to unwind and refuel.  Thinking most all restaurants in this area have a Friday Fish special, I asked the waitress and discovered this place is an exception.  They do have fish on the menu, but not a special offer on Fridays.  I started the meal with a glass of the local special beer.  It was ok, a little too hoppy for me though.   The restaurant is big, but the noise level is high.  The food arrived all at the same time.  The fish is deep fried and comes with waffle fries and coleslaw.  The coleslaw was good - a hint of sweetness.  The fish had way too much breading and had kittle flavor.  The food portion was enormous - they are making up in quantity what is lacking in flavor.  With so many other choices fir Friday Night fish in the area, I would suggest to look elsewhere."}
{"text":"My husband and I tried this place out last night. We were not impressed. The inside is beautiful, a lot of brick work and nice wood. It has a nice feel....that's where it ends. We sat at the bar and debated whether to eat here or Bar Louie. My husband ordered some chocolate/caramel tasting beer. The first few sips were ok and then it was a bit much. I ordered a lager, it was average. As we were looking over the menu the lady next to us got her food. It looked awful. She had what we think was salmon, it looked dry and over cooked. Everything on her plate looked dry, the asparagus was shriveled and the wild rice looked clumpy. I actually felt bad for her. We paid our tab and left. Probably won't be there again."}
{"text":"Granite City advertised the October Chef's specials.  The Bavarian Burger made me plan a date night just so I could get to try the meal! My fiance and I went to an early dinner.  Our drink orders were taken quickly.  However, that was the end of quick and thoughtful service. I appreciated the Gluten Free menu, my fiance has Celiac.  After placing our order we continued to wait for our drinks which finally arrived about 10 minutes after ordering them- the were delicious, props to the bartender.  Our waitress never asked us about appetizers, which would have been nice since we waited awhile for our entrees-drinking on empty stomachs!  My fiance's GF burger came first.  He awkwardly nibbled at his chips while watching the kitchen for my meal...Finally, my entree came out at least 5 minutes after his meal.  Needless to say, I was let down SO badly about the Bavarian Burger: NO pretzel bun (which our waitress admitted she forgot to mention was out of stock --- umm big part of the burger and an option for ALL burgers on the menu), no mustard, and skimpy kraut.  We scarfed down our meal and left.  Underwhelmed. For the PRICE and the WAIT we didn't get much.  The drinks were the saving factor.  Honestly, there isn't a reason to return."}
{"text":"I usually prefer the locally owned restaurants to support our local economy, but their Bruscetta Salad is to die for!  Yummy!  My husband likes their beer selection as well, so we joined the \"Mug Club\".  For a one time $10 fee, you receive 10% off all your meals and you get \"upgraded\" to a larger mug!"}
{"text":"Boo-yah!  Mom found a gift card for Granite City.  Sobieski Classic Cosmos on the cheap because it's happy hour?  Make it two please.  Each...    Mother and I have dinner at home or out every Thursday; we went out to dinner here even though our show  (SCANDAL) was delayed due to WIAA basketball games.  Grrr...  Our Waitress was Kate and she was great; personable, knowledgeable, and her smile was genuine.  We each had the 'Bedda Chedda bacon burgers; mine with raw onions along with the garlic mashed potatoes (awww soooo good...), her's with sauteed onions and the baked potato. We were seated in the third booth with a birds-eye view of the tv's and people watching and ear hustling (some interesting dialogue in the next booth was eye brow raising and made us chuckle.)  I didn't find this place too loud or too anything; it's a bar and there were no kids afoot so we chilled with our drinks, with our food and laughed and conversed freely.  We were there about an hour and a half and although I never make it to the west side much, I'd return to GC.  Two-fold."}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch.  Beer was good as was the decor.  Has a lot of potential but management must rebuild the food and service from the ground up.  Horrible food.  I had the dinner salmon and got a small dry piece of salmon plopped on some rice with overcooked asparagus, it was really bad.  I could forgive one bad meal but my wife's luncheon burger was worse than anything out of McDonald's.  She commented that it looked like a frozen burger that you buy at the grocery store.  It was on a cheap bun with store bought chips.    As far as the service, our meals came out at different times and we had to have them redo our bill three times as they added other people's bills to ours.  Could be ok to drink but every place at Legacy has better food. Note to management:  Fire the cook, rethink your menu, include some fresh ingredients, and retrain your staff and you could have a winner here.  Cleveland is a food town. We notice these things.  We will not be back."}
{"text":"I recommended this place to a friend for a business lunch.I was their guest . Our server did not explain the beers,food,specials....nothing! \"What can I cut you to drink\" was all he said. Our food came,I had the French Onion soup....OMG was it salty!! I tried to dilute with water...didn't help. Then our entrees came,I forgot the name of the \"fried club sandwich\". It was very greasy and the fries had a ton of salt on them. I would think the servers would be trained to spot barely eaten food as a signal that something is not right. NOT!! Since I was a guest,I did not complain about the service or food. I guess I would have been embarrassed since I DID recommend the place! At the end, I politely said,\"Please tell the cooks that the need to lighten up on the salt back there\" He said.....wait for it.....\"I will\" then brought the check! Geez!!"}
{"text":"This place can get pretty noisy. The silverware was dirty. I ordered salmon, asparagus and wild rice. Now let's talk about my rice. I asked if they had brown rice, his reply was we have wild rice which is brown rice. The rice was overcooked. How can you mess up rice? Anyway, the other guests at my table had no compliments to give. I guess one person mentioned the online menu does not match their menu in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Went to Granite city for the first time tonight and it will be my last time.  But some highlights first.    PROS: Server David A took care of us very well.  It pushed the kids food through because they were so hungry.  He also took the time to do the checks right and he was very personable.     CONS: We called ahead days before and they said they didn't take reservations but on the day of you could call ahead and put your name in.  We called in for a time at 6pm for 13 people.  Got there 10 mins before 6 and checked in they said it was going to be 45 mins. An hour and thirty five mins later we got seated.  This time was spent dealing with four kids under four years old, hungry and getting tired. Manager never visited and seemed to avoid our table.  Once we ordered the food, it came in an acceptable time frame.    I got a soup and a salad. The french onion soup was very tasty.  The salad on the other had had soggy lettuce with brown and slimy ends.  The bread that came with it was more butter and salt then anything.  I was very disappointed at the food.  Side note.  Floors in the restaurant were very slippery even when the floor looked dry.  Men's restroom was dark and it looked like the urinals over flowed so the floors were covered in water or other.    I will not be visiting again."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the flatbread, service was amazing from tonya and the young pretty manager!  Beer was decent.  If I didn't live in CA, I'd come back again"}
{"text":"I came on thanksgiving night while the family shopped after dinner, I found granite city, but it was open but deserted. But to my surprise the bartender welcomed me and offered to stay open for awhile so I could have a beer. I had an IPA and before I knew it the bar had 10 other war wore shopper seeking a cold beer. I was able to have a few more before she called last call so she could close. Very rare to have such friendly staff on a holiday night away from there family."}
{"text":"Super slow service. 20 minutes and still no sign of appetizers. Waitress has been talking to friends. So disappointed with this visit. Update, the GM reached out and was very apologetic and discounted our bill!!"}
{"text":"This place was recommended by a few friends so I thought we should check it out. Once we sat down and looked at the menu's I realized we were basically in a Chili's or an Applebee's Plus. Friendly waiter made it better. The food average and cost more than it should. About an hour after dinner I had to run to the toilet. Not good. Something I ate there is dying to get out. Totally sharted a few minutes ago. WTF! We spent $60 on one beer a kid's meal, a steak, and a burger with fries. And  I have diarrhea now. Don't think I'll be going back. Seems popular though. Not sure why."}
{"text":"At 5:30 pm on a Friday evening, we called the restaurant and asked if we could make a reservation for a party of 7. The hostess said they don't take same day reservations. We then asked if they took call ahead seating. She said they do not. Still, we decided to go at 7 pm, knowing that we might have to wait a while. Posted on the door was a sign that said, \"Now accepting call ahead seating.\" When we asked the hostess about that, she said, \"Our manager told us not to accept call ahead seating today.\" Another hostess said, \"We want to get that sign changed.\" Hmmmm...We took a pager and was told there would be a 45 minute wait. After 45 minutes there was no indication that a table would be available any time soon (despite many parties of 3-4 being seated throughout our wait). Nor did anyone at the hostess station seem to care. They were busy talking. So, we called Brio - also in Legacy Village - and they said they could seat us immediately. Much better food and no wait!"}
{"text":"Ya know, for a chain, Granite City is pretty dang good.  My personal fave is the grilled chicken bruschetta salad, a salad in name only as it comes with not one but SIX slabs of garlic cheese bread(!!)  Burgers, soups are all good, if a little predictable.  Prices are moderate, and I like that it's attached to the mall, but just a little separate.  Outside dining is also available, although it comes with a great view of Sears' parking lot.  Minus one star for continuing to try to sell us the worst table in the house, right at the top of the stairs where literally everyone passes by.  Um, no, thanks."}
{"text":"Worst Brewpub in Wisconsin, Worst Beer in the Entire State (And That Includes Blatz).  I came here with my daughter one Friday night and we had a bit of a wait, so that should be a good sign, right, that lots of people want to eat there?  At the end of the meal, I concluded that the explanation was that there were either a lot of people who were clueless about this restaurant (counting myself as a former member of that group) or were clueless about how good food and beer taste.  I have to say that Granite City's facility is very attactive and much more upscale than any other brewpub I've been in, the equal of most of the higher end restaurants in Madison.  That was one of only two highlights with this entire meal.  We sat down and had a lengthy wait before our server, a middle-aged woman, brought us a complimentary tray of carrot sticks and ranch dressing, the only other positive experience of the entire meal.  We experienced a lengthy wait before receiving our beverages and initially, our server forgot my daughter's drink.   I ordered the reuben and our server listed a bunch of sides that I could select with it, and I chose sweet potato fries.   I believe my daughter had macaroni and cheese, but it may have been a sandwich; whatever she ordered, she didn't like it much.  My reuben was supposed to have a half pound of corned beef, but I doubt it had even a quarter pound of meat in it.  Honestly, I think it had at least half as much butter on the bread as it had meat in the sandwich - it was extremely greasy, the greasiest reuben I've ever had, which really detracted from what might have been a pretty good sandwich.    I ordered a beer sampler tray with 8 glasses of their beer.  Let me preface this comment by saying that I consider myself to be rather knowledgable about beer.  I've visited most of the brewpubs in Wisconsin, I've had beer from every brewery in the state, and I enjoy a broad variety of beers.  I'm also a homebrewer.  I know what a good beer tastes like.  Two of these eight beers were drinkable.  Several, of these were so awful I didn't bother with a second sip.  They were swill, so bad that I suspect that GC's brewer got lazy, didn't adequately clean their tanks, and the beer was contaminated.  GC's manager, a younger, cocky sort of guy, stopped by and asked disinterestedly how our meal was.  I told him my reuben was really greasy and explained to him that the beers really weren't good at all, that I was familiar with all of the state's microbreweries and Granite City's beers were by far the worst beer in the state.  The manager could see I had hardly touched six out of eight of the sampler glasses.  He looked up in surprise and said with a sneer, \"Well I'm sorry we don't meet your standards,\" turned his back on us, and walked away.  If this dillweed had no intention of doing anything if there was a problem, why the hell had he bothered to ask?  After a long wait, server finally brought the check.  I discovered that she had charged me $3 more for my sweet potato fries.  I asked her why she had never told me they were an extra charge.  She said it was clearly marked on the menu. and walked away.  After being extremely slow, inattentive and unfriendly, I took the extra $3 out of her tip.  On the way out the door, I stopped at the front desk and asked to see a menu.  The same manager handed me one and notwithstanding he could see I was not happy, did not ask me if there was a problem.  Sure enough, in very fine small print, there was a mention of the upcharge on the sweet potato fries, very excessive one.  In summary, we had bad food, slow, inattentive service, some of the worst beer I've ever drunk, and management was rude and awful.  I recommend staying far away from this joint, especially when Madison has perhaps the best brewpub in the country, the Great Dane."}
{"text":"Food was good, but beer and service were subpar. This is a microbrewery. Give me good beer and bar food and I would be happy. But good food and subpar beer? Two varieties of subpar beer? Unfortunate."}
{"text":"I normally take the wife and two kids to Granite City for a nice weekend meal. The Sunday \"Kids Eat Free\" day is what brings us back week after week! I love the Buffalo Chicken Wrap and my wife loves the Bruschetta Chicken  Salad or the Cajun Pasta.  We tried the beer sampler once and we loved every single one. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is a dumb reason, but still valid. The wifi there is free, but it is VERY slow. Our kids like to watch some kid videos on Youtube or Netflix while waiting for food, but it is always slow and it gets annoying. If they had faster wifi, the 5 stars for sure!"}
{"text":"We've only been here once but we won't be back. The place was crazy busy which is expected for a new business so we were patient. But when the 4th server came to out table and we had to beg them to take 1 food order, we were a little unsure of what to expect. Waited a reasonable time for our drinks. The pomegranate mojito was awesome. The beer cheese soup was excellent. My salad was supposed to come with grilled chicken, there wasn't any. I asked the waiter after he checked in ten minutes after the food was delivered. He was great and got me a plate from the kitchen. So then we felt better. Then our drinks were dry and we ordered after another twenty minute wait. All of them except our sampler showed up. Throughout the course of the next hour we asked three more times for our beer sampler. Finally after a full hour I went to talk to the manager  and he went an got it for us himself. Finally we decided to leave and go somewhere else and it took us another 20 minutes for our server to come back by and then another 25 minutes for the check. We were a group of 11 and none of us will probably ever come back by choice."}
{"text":"Decor is cool, food is great! Love the lunch menu. Burgers were great as well as the Bacon Avocado Sandwich. Large portions and kids menu is very nice as well."}
{"text":"Food was below expectation. Service was spotty but it wasn't our servers fault. She did as good a job as she could given the hectic restaurant. The focus here is on fun drinks and enjoying alcohol with your friends. There were lots of large groups and the place is noisy. Beer was pretty good. All in all, not a bad concept but the food kills it. I won't be going back unless for only a drink at the bar."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in the Madison area.  Te beer is pretty darn good and the food is fabulous.  Have never had a bad meal here.  Te burgers are great, my kids love the Cubans and I love the Asian salad.  The meatloaf is excellent also.  Not sure why there are any 1 or 2 star ratings.  Bad day for them?  If not why is there almost always a wait just about any time you go?  This brew pub and the Great Dane are tied for first place for Madison.  Great Dane has better beer and more selection but I like the food more at Granite City.  This is one of the go to places for me when friends or relatives come to town."}
{"text":"I'd give this place a happy three stars.   I was a little skeptical and didn't know what to expect from a restaurant that's attached to a mall. That being said,  I was pleasantly surprised.   We were a table of 9 on a Friday night but the wait wasn't bad. We waited at the bar while trying out their drinks. They make good Long Island iced teas ($6.25) and their watermelon martini ($8) was absolutely decadent, although I'm not sure if it contained any alcohol.   The prices on the menu was a bit all over the place, $12 for Idaho nachos, which were essentially waffle fries dressed up in bacon bits, a sprinkle of green onions and tomatoes.  $19 for 10 oz sirloin, $16 for linguini, wraps and cheeseburger for $10, fish tacos were $13, and $15 for fish and chips.   Don't come here expecting a Friday night fish fry,  the fish tacos and f&c were about the closest thing to it.  My fish was very light and delicate, maybe too much so. The light breading didn't help keep the fish on my fork. It comes with waffle fries and coleslaw. I think for the price,  there's better options out there.   I didn't hear anyone that complained about their food,  but no one in the group raved about it either."}
{"text":"Asked for a table for 2 at approximately at 6:15 pm on a Monday night for dinner. There was a 15 minute wait.  When our table was ready we found it odd that there were plenty of empty tables...so why the wait?  I guess because not enough servers? That being said, server was friendly and our drinks/entrees came quickly.  I ordered the crispy shrimp taco trio which was wonderful...had the right amount of heat.  I would have given 4 stars because of the food, but because of the wait time/empty tables I'm giving 3 stars."}
{"text":"Good was pretty good   Service was slow Bathrooms smelled of urine.  I told the host of the condition of the bathrooms. He looked at me like I was speaking Navajo."}
{"text":"Had dinner there last night and was quite disappointed, although I've been to Granite City before first at this location. Service was so slow and yes it was Saturday, but it wasn't crowded. Food was subpar to say the least, we ordered the mango habanero BBQ wings as an appetizer now those were tasty. The Hungry like a Wolf martini was super weak! Ordered a Cosmo after 15 mins of waiting I said forget it!"}
{"text":"Stopped by with family for lunch. Hostess that greeted us was rude an unfriendly. Table service was lousy at best. Food was horrible. French fries were stone cold. Ordered medium cooked burgers that came rare and dripping blood. They were cold as well. Staff in general was lacking in any type of personality, and couldn't care less about our experience. Worst place we ever ate and obviously there will not be a return trip for a second chance. This place is gross and I would recommend you stay away."}
{"text":"Yesturday (August 22, 2015) was my second time coming here. We were welcomed by three ladies at the front desk who were very kind and took in our party of 10 fast! We also had two toddlers that our waiter was extremely nice to. The place is relaxing and the food is fantasic! I love the bacon potato soup! I wish it was available every day instead of only saturdays!"}
{"text":"The 4 of us came here because a friend recommended it. The place is beautiful and we looked forward to having a great meal and awesome drinks. After asking and being turned down for a booth seat we were seated by the rest room. It took 15 minutes for our waiter to come and introduce themselves and run down the list of some of there choice beers. Everyone at the table ordered the blueberry beer and I ordered the Sangria sunset. We also at this time we ordered wings as an appetizer. When I asked for water everyone at the table followed suit and also asked for  water. We got our drinks 10 minutes later. After the first sip of beer, everyone looked at each other lol no one tasted the blueberry in the beer and throughout the dinner they tried to find at least a hint of blueberry with no success. the boneless wings were good even though they seemed like the sauce was lightly sprayed on the wings because there was barely any sauce on them. I ordered a VERY expensive steak dinner because nothing else on the menu interested me. My steak came with garlic mashed potatoes and asparagus. My Boyfriend ordered the mac and cheese which the  waiter said was \"very cheesy\". Our main dishes came out 25 minutes later. Instantly we were disappointed.  My steak was good... nothing special but my asparagus was cooked to the point that it tasted and had the soft consistency of okra and my mashed potatoes seemed as if no milk or anything was added to make them mashed potatoes. I seriously think they baked a potatoe and roughly mashed it with a fork and threw it on my plate. My boyfriend was really upset because there idea of mac and cheese is totally different from his. He got a big bowl of rigatoni pasta that had chives and cheese sprinkled on top... this dish had no type of cheese sauce and after tasting his dish I asked him where was the cheese.  I left the restaraunt with almost all of my food in a box and my boyfriend didnt even want to take his. I got home and gave the entire $27 steak to the neighborhood cat. Overall we left agreeing that Applebee's had better food than this place... and we don't plan on visting again. I'm gonna stick to J Alexanders for now."}
{"text":"Their \"Famous Sunday Brunch\" - *sigh* where should I start... Firstly, we came at 11:00am, and were told \"20-30 mins\". Just over 45 mins later, our buzzer finally went off. We later found out that they were telling 20-30 mins to everyone, not just parties of 2.  For myself, the scrambled eggs were dry and stiff. The hash-brown casserole... oily and greasy. The bacon, so over cooked!  The gentleman they had cutting the prime rib... God... I wanted to the take knife and fork away from him and slap his hand for ruining such a beautiful piece of meat! He was constantly sawing tiny bits off, using short little strokes with the 16\" of blade he had in his hand... the gal at the eggs benedict station actually had to show him how to use the honing steel when he indicated it was getting harder to cut the meat. (We were seated within 10 ft of the prime rib and eggs benedict stations, and saw the whole thing)  My fiance' was very upset about it after paying $15 for something she felt that they heralded it as a \"Famous Sunday Brunch\", and yet it wasn't even as good as some continental breakfasts you can get a nicer hotel.  There was barely any fruit - only sliced musk melon and grapes. Also, it took my fiance' almost 10 minutes to receive her drink order of milk.  Neither of us are big beer drinkers, so this is yet another place that overcharges for food because they make \"great beer\" that we will simply not be going to again."}
{"text":"You see... I love this place! Food is great and  we love the atmosphere! The weight sometimes is a drag! But yet, we love this place!"}
{"text":"I thought this place was great!! I was ready to have terrible service based on the other reviews I have read. Our waitress was Ashley and she was perfect. She was attentive but did not bug us. She knew the menu well and made great recommendations. She told us about all the beers and we tried a sampler. Each of us had our favorite. We got the nacho appetizer and it was HUGE. 6 people could easily share this. You must get it with the granite city dip. I don't know what they put it in (I still think crack. jk!), but it was to die for. I had a salad and my boyfriend had a burger. The salad was perfect and the burger was huge too! It was very tasty. The decor was nice and sound level was good. You can see them cooking in the kitchen which is always a plus.  It seemed like we timed our visit right and gave them long enough to work out some of the kinks that previous yelpers complained about."}
{"text":"this place is pretty average. i've been twice and both times i haven't really been impressed.  the first time, i got the blackened chicken linguini. sub par, i felt.  the sauce wasn't very flavorful and i just thought it was pretty blah-tasting.  i also had the northern light lager -- which they brew in house i guess.  also not really impressive.  felt like a beer i could get anywhere.  we went back last night to give it a second chance. we shared the idaho nachos -- a big plate of waffle fries smothered in cheese, bacon, tomatoes, chives and sour cream.  this was actually pretty good considering that when i make mashed potatoes, i add everything aforementioned.  also, it was a HUGE plate and it pretty much filled me up.  along with the nachos, we shared a cheeseburger with bacon.  even though i only had to conquer half a burger, i still didn't manage to eat all of it.  not because it was so huge but because we ordered it medium-well and it came way over well-done.  definitely wasn't to my taste.  we had the burger and nachos come at the same time though, so the potatoes kept me from leaving hungry.  to note, all sandwiches only come with either potato chips or coleslaw.  getting waffle fries or mashed potatoes costs an extra 1.50$.  getting a soup or salad to start costs 2.50$.  i feel like at a burger place, fries should come standard.  3 stars for being mediocre: service was good and the manager was actually very attentive, the idaho nachos were delicious, heart clogging and huge, and a point for being part brewery.  blah food though.  it probably won't be on my list of places to frequent."}
{"text":"Food is pretty average, service wasn't bad. Loved their house garlic sauce for the loaded potatoes.  Overall it was great experience, the Sunday brunch can use more selections of food for the price they charge"}
{"text":"The food is good here but I had a wacky waitress who sat next to me in my booth while I was asking some questions about  when our food was coming! Intimidationl"}
{"text":"Red ruby tuna appetizer was clutch! Be sure to sign up for the Mug Club. amazing beer selection."}
{"text":"I just had a bad experience at granite city. I order the meatloaf and it was cold. I ask for it to be heated up. I had to wait 15 minutes, but first I ask our sever what was going on with my meal. He forgot my meal. I ask for the manager. The manager mentioned that they were sorry about meal, and she would inform the kitchen. My drink was good."}
{"text":"Food was awesome, get the shrimp appetizer! Service was really bad. The waitress forgot to put in the appetizer and soup and still charged for it even though it came out well after our entrees. Not to mention it took about 40 min to get a salad and basic salmon dish. $11 for a glass of decent Sauvignon blanc. They need to work on their service! Manager stopped by but was already leaving before we could say anything. It was like she wasn't even waiting for an answer."}
{"text":"Did the Sunday brunch buffet.  Food was what you would expect.  It was good but not terrific.  The service was good.  May go back there for a regular meal but I get the impression this place would be hit or miss.  They have a good childrens menu."}
{"text":"First time visiting.  Went on a Sunday, it was quick seating  with or no wait. Wanted to try something simple so I got the bock cheese flat bread.  It was pretty good. Servers were very nice and professional.  I will visit again."}
{"text":"I had a really nice experience here. It was a spur of the moment pic and I was pleasantly surprised! First, I ordered a watermelon martini which was fantastic! Whoever the bartender was that night did a great job! For an appetizer I got the spinach artichoke dip which was probably the best I'd ever had. Just enough of each ingredient! (Had a friend with me thy wasn't a fan of that dip, but loved this restaurant's version). My main complaint was with my entree. I ordered the Cajun creole pasta, which was good enough, but with the ridiculous amount of grease that came with it you just couldn't eat it. I felt as if my entire meal was swimming in grease. Granted, I'm not oblivious that \"grease was involved in the making\", but do I really need to see it ALL? And for $16? Yuck. I'd definitely go back and try something else, because the rest of my experience was a good one."}
{"text":"This is my boyfriend and I's go-to date night dinner spot and I recommend it to anyone that is in need of a new dinner location for a date. We both always order their top sirloin entree, which comes with a delicious garlic butter on top of the steak. I've also had Granite City's Bennie Mac & Cheese before and it is AMAZING. I have never been disappointed by their entrees. For dessert, we do the trio which comes with a delicious, refreshing raspberry sorbet, creme brulee, and a brownie sundae! The food is consistent, and good.   Their beers are also delicious and they usually have seasonal brews that are exciting as well! They have a rewards program for frequent customers that is really nice as well.  This place does get very, very busy on weekend nights and there usually is a wait. The majority of the time, staff is attentive and friendly, but I am giving this 4/5 because I've had a few bad experiences with inattentive staff members and longer than necessary wait times for items. I also find the prices to be higher than I would hope. In the end, though, I still think this is a nice dinner date night location!"}
{"text":"Came back the for two nights in a row now! Got the prime rib which was not very fatty and very flavorful- just how I like it. Members of my party tried to meatloaf which was very huge and had nice flavor too, and the margarita flatbread which was good-I wasn't a huge fan of the balsamic glaze though. Another winner with our server: Orion!"}
{"text":"Food came to the table cold after waiting 30/45 minutes for food prices are very high small drinks double billing on my ticket 107.00 for 2 with 1 drink a each green beans were not done will I go back maybe with smaller parties maybe 4 or less drink/steak was great best steak in a long while"}
{"text":"For a long long time I avoided this place because I was sick and tired of chain restaurants.  But after sitting down and eating I was pleasantly surprised by this place. (As evidenced by my clean plate!) I would have given them a 4 rating, but I need a few more visits before going there."}
{"text":"This was probably my 7th visit and was sadly disappointed. Previous visits were good but this time the food was not up to the usual standards. We were a table of five and after waiting around a half hour for our cocktails and appetizers, the food was lukewarm or cold. The manager did have our food prepared again but the experience  did have us rethinking our happy hour and lunch location."}
{"text":"Decent beer and food, both are overpriced. Probably a little below par to similar places in the area."}
{"text":"I will never step foot in that place again for what we paid we got crappy service from a crappy waitress, she acted like it was her 1 st day at work service was slllllloooooowwww, and she was reslllly bad. I don't even watch to rate it."}
{"text":"Went and got a flatbread pizza and they said they dropped some of it on the floor so it would be three minutes till they brought one out. Asked for it without basil it came with basil on it, bit into the pizza and the crust was like biting into a piece of cardboard and it tasted like it had been sitting under the heating lamp. They asked if we wanted them to just bring our food and not the pizza anymore so we said yes. They brought our food and all four of our entrees were warm on the outside, barely warm on inside and hot on the bottom."}
{"text":"For a chain this place serves pretty decent food. Let me start by saying however that this location really REALLY needs a renovation. The booth I sat on had a tear down the middle and the paint on the walls was chipping off. Really doesn't seem like they care about upkeep (sad). So I would have given 2 stars just for that, but service was good and food was decent so I bumped it to 3.   I started with the sampler of beer, which seems to be a pretty good value. I wasn't a fan of a couple of them but really enjoyed their seasonal beers and their IPA. I'm not normally an IPA drinker so that was a little surprising but I'll go with it. I then ordered a cup of the Northern Cheddar and Ale Soup for a starter. I really enjoyed this soup, my boyfriend doesn't normally like soup and he even finished his entire serving. It's hard not to like something that places beer and cheese together, though. For my entree I had the Maple Pepper Bacon and Tomato Flatbread. The bacon was just a little too sweet in my opinion, but overall I enjoyed the dish and happily ate the leftovers the next day.   I would consider returning to Granite City for another meal, but will probably wait until they update the space. I would hope they can do better than ripped seats and dirty carpet."}
{"text":"Along with myself there were 2 other people. This place was pretty good. I had the shrimp tacos which were really good I would say the worse thing about the place was the length of time it took to get our food. I would have to say it took about 30 mins for our to come out. They didn't bring out anything while we waited, we should've ordered a starter item but I didn't expect the food to take so long. Our waitress finally offered to bring us some bread but they charged us extra for the bread and it wasn't warm. All and all this place prob won't be a favorite where I go all the time but once in a while maybe."}
{"text":"This place is great for Sunday brunch. The price is right and the selection is wide. I would suggest going early before 12pm. After 12pm and you get a rush of church goers and children. The service is average and below considering it's a buffet and servers only have to make sure your drinks are filled you would think the service would be better. The food is really great but can sometimes be cold. Mimosa's and bloody Mary's are always on point so kudos to the bartenders! The meat carving station with the prime rib is a meat lovers dream and the smoked salmon cream cheese for the bagels is heaven. Definitely a great experience."}
{"text":"Sunday brunch is terrible. Do not go here for $18.95 it is not worth it. You would be better off paying for a room at the holiday inn express and eating their free breakfast, it's less expensive, better food, and you can take a nap after breakfast in your room."}
{"text":"This was our first time here and it was quite a challenge to find. There are arrows pointing the direction to go to enter but I accidentally ended up walking into Pearle Vision. Oops!  I ended up finding the place and we got a table for 4 and they asked the names of the other couple.  Fast forward 15 minutes and I get a text from the other couple that they now have a table. Why bother asking their names if you aren't going to seat them with us?  The bar sampler for only $4.95 is a steal.  A friend ordered two instead of ordering a beverage.  The beer was quite tasty.  I got a steak...and it was amazing.  They messed up the order on a friend's burger as well.  Service was pretty slow most of the evening.  Our friends raved about their brunch but also seemed disappointed in the dinner we had so next time we'll be sticking to brunch."}
{"text":"This place is a big disappointment. They call themselves a brewery, albeit a chain, but cannot deliver a proper beer. I went with some friends to try this place out on a Sunday evening. When we received our beers, they were all flat and watery (we had each ordered a different beer). When we notified the waiter and he confirmed that almost all of the draft beers were coming out flat, we were pretty surprised that this \"brewery\" could not keep their beers carbonated. Surprisingly, servers continued to serve these flat beers to other patrons after they had learned that the beers were flat. This is not a way to run a \"brewery.\"  Our service was good, but our food was pretty average."}
{"text":"Uhh, where do I begin. being harassed upon entry, I got \"served\" by a waitress with a less than desirable attitude. I asked for no tomatoes and no ranch in my wrap. Guess what was in it? Tomatoes and ranch. On top of that I was about to sit down until I noticed that there was a rogue butter knife in between the cushions, waiting to find it's way into my behind. It took a ballpark estimate 27 minutes to receive our drinks (not saying I counted... But I did.) a lot of the waiters are pretty friendly only to be dragged into the bottomless pit of hopelessness and sass that is customer service by their female counterparts. A joyous night of fun and love quickly took a 180 into a night of sass and disappointment. That's not even the half of it. But alas, I digress."}
{"text":"Service was great. Staff were pleasant and welcoming. The Asian shrimp appetizer was satisfying. For dinner I had the salmon oscar.  Wow did they nail this one. I enjoyed a very satisfying meal with colleagues."}
{"text":"I was in town visiting family and we all settled on Granite City Grill after we discovered that the Cheesecake Factory in the same complex had a minimum of a one hour wait.    Even though Granite City was pretty busy, we were actually seated very quickly.    I have eaten at Granite City before in the Indianapolis area where I live.   The Indy location is great, so I figured it would be comparable at this location; and it really wasn't too far off the mark.     The spinach dip appetizer was great as always, and we tried the maple sugar bacon pizza appetizer as well.  That was excellent too.    We had a big party of 7 dining that evening.   Everyone seemed to like their meals except for one guest who thought her steak was cold when it was served to the table.  Her meal was redone, but by the time she got her replacement meal, the rest of us were finished eating.  It took quite some time for her meal to be prepared. The manager also came out and apologized, but I am unclear if her meal was comped because I didn't pay the bill.    The beer was good.  We got a sampler platter, and I ordered one very tall monster mug.    I got the reuben sandwich again with turkey instead of beef.  I also got the fries and cole slaw.   I really have to give a big compliment/shout out to their cole slaw.  It is some of the best I have ever had.  It is in very stiff competition with mine.  ;o)   All in all, I do like Granite City Grill, and have never had a bad experience.   It's a shame this location has a fairly low Yelp rating."}
{"text":"There were 6 of us this past Saturday and we had a great time. Service was perfect and timely. Drinks were good and fairly priced. Atmosphere is real nice. We had 3 apps. Wings, soft pretzels with cheese dip and spinach and artichoke dip. All 3 were outstanding especially the habanero BBQ sauce for the wings. The reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 were the entrees. They were better then average but nothing super special. Will go back for sure but will probably stick to just drinks and apps."}
{"text":"Don't go here on the weekend for dinner if you aren't willing to be patient. We arrived around 7:30 and they said it would be an hour to an hour and a half wait which was fine, it was a saturday night so we understood. We ended up being seated after only a half hour but then after being seated for 15 minutes no one came to take our drink orders. we ended up having about three different people wait on us, continuously asking us to repeat our order. my food finally came out after a short wait time but the two other people i was with NEVER got their food. i finished my meal before anyone even came up to us again. i understand that they were busy but they shouldn't have seated us if they didn't have a server available to wait on us. we ended up leaving around 9 because we didn't want to wait for the food any longer :/"}
{"text":"Slow but friendly service. Way slow from the bar.  Beers were not good. 1 or 2 were passable. The rest tasted like nothing, cheap domestics, or soapy. Other drinks were on the pricey side. $11 for a marker mark?!  The app we ordered was good. Pretty hard to screw up cheese covered waffle fries though.   Decor/atmosphere is ok. Slightly better than any chain restaurant and not an authentic brewery/brewpub feel.   Wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Meh.  My wife had gone with a group previously and liked the food, so maybe we caught them on an off day. We were in at an odd time (around 1:30 pm on a weekday). Maybe I'm making excuses for what was to come because I really liked the look and decor when we walked in. Really cool design elements all around. Maybe I was expecting the food and beer to match.  I hate to say it, but I'm a bit of a beer snob. I like stouts and porters thick and rich and IPA's hoppy and crisp. It was cool and rainy so I decided to go with a flight of the dark beers, which really only ended up with one, the Broad Axe Stout. Calling the rest of the flight 'dark' is dubious. I had high hopes for the Broad Axe, so I saved it for last. The other three beers were the Bennie (bock), Black & Tan (Broad Axe+Duke) & Blarney (Broad Axe+Bennie). I'll save the space of breaking them down individually. All three shared the exact same characteristic, WATERY & flat. My wife, far less critical of beer than I, tried two and said \"these seem watery\". At least I had my Broad Axe Stout left. To my chagrin, the stout too, was watery and flavorless. I felt like I had 4 glasses of light beer with different levels of food coloring in them. It was a real bummer across the board.  As for our food. Some hits and misses. We started with the soft pretzels. They were great. Hot, fresh & doughy. My wife's burger was super-juicy and tasted great. My grilled chicken/avocado wrap was good but the chicken was thin slices (lunch meat?) Not what I think of when picturing grilled chicken, but that could be on me. Our daughter had 'boneless wings' for lack of any noticeable kid's menu. Some were good. Some seemed way over cooked and bone dry. Two of us had French fries and our daughter had sweet potato fries. One commonality. SALT! Sweet Fancy Moses! All the salt a person needs for a week. 5 hours later, we're parched and dying of thirst no matter how much we drink.  I would also note that our server was a great guy and on top of things.  As I said, I love the look of the place. I'd maybe come back for cocktails & burgers."}
{"text":"The service was extremely slow. I wish I could give half stars here. We got sat in a timely manner but it was simply downhill from there. After sitting for 40 mins our orders were taken. It wasn't packed in the restaurant at all. Our server was simply slow. 30 mins later, my beer flight arrived. You can't beat the price of the flights. The food was tasty but as everyone in my party was tired from traveling we rushed through it when it finally did arrive."}
{"text":"This is my yearly choice for my birthday meal for the past 3 or now 4 years; as I have loved their brunch for both quality and value.  Last year we learned we needed a reservation to really get a seat so we planned ahead this year. This will be the last year I spend my birthday here.   We walked in right at opening time and no one was at the hostess station. We sat right next to the station and waited (we had our twins with us and their kindles were keeping them not crappy)...for no one to notice us as one server was too busy admiring her triangular/pointy manicure and a second was trying desperately to not make eye contact by looking at the same three sheets of reservations four times.  A couple came in after us and sat across from us, and while we were ignored they were asked if they'd been helped...while we continued to be ignored.  Same two women: same functions of ignoring us.  Wait another two parties to be sat (my husband now standing in a magical line of folks now pouring in) while I'm keeping twin toddlers calm - saw a man with menus walking behind the front pole/hostess station and asked if someone would actually help us.  Pointy manicure girl was asked to take us to a table which she obliged - and somehow thought a massive U shaped booth with table too far into my 32 week pregnant belly would be perfect...and when we explained those reasons why the table wouldn't work we were greeted with an eye roll and lack of help - my husband actually suggested an alternative seating.  (Service is now a zero star in my opinion) but it's 10:20 our 10 am reservation obviously completely not needed for any reason but supposed societal convention aside that mistake won't be made by this patron again...  So we sit down, order juice for our two year olds (I kee saying this as it will come into need later) and order one piece of French toast per person (4) it says to do that on the menu sheet - it also says kids 5 and under eat buffet free.  Hubbs gets one plate (fruit for the kids while we wait for the French toast and some bacon - their bacon IS killer).  I then went and got bacon, those parm regg potatoes, fruit and one caramel roll) not a lot for a chubby food loving lady but waste not want not.  Other patrons - LEARN TO CLOSE THE LIDS! that's how food stays hot...and I should not be walking behind other patrons doing this - LEARN FOOD ETTIQUITE.   Anyhoo our server was one of the worst waitresses I have ever had in my 37 years...we spied her at least 3 times selfie checking her make up and hair - but only our water refills once and never asked again about more French toast - the only thing besides bacon our kids ate...  Did I expect more bc it's my birthday meal? No one knows that - would I have expected the manager I had to complain about to get my reservation honored and sat to check on us - that I would have - because I would have as a service professional...but oh well obviously our business didn't matter.    The delay with the food for them (which we never got the additional two piece order) caused them to lose their stuff and we left without me even finishing breakfast as I could tell people around us were done with twin toddlers...the check comes and there was a $6.99 charge for each kid - odd as remember the buffet info card says 5 and under free.  We asked the first person we saw (pointy manicure girl) and she said \"no I don't think so\" so the hubbs had to show her their own PRINTED TABLE CARD.   Overall the fabulously tasty food which I credit totally to an on point kitchen staff is why this for any stars from me."}
{"text":"Great food, get there early!  Met up for happy hour with some friends tonight and had a great time! You are able to get the happy hour special anywhere in the restaurant, so we got a table in the dining room. I think we ended up getting every app on the hh menu, and enjoyed every one of them!! The food was FANTASTIC, hot, and came out in a reasonable amount of time. The hh drink menu is just as good, with a diverse selection of drinks available at a discount. I tried a few of the cocktails, and they were all great.  My only complaint of the evening was the wait time to get our drinks. There seemed to be an ample amount of wait staff who was always around to take our plates, bring food and ask us if we needed more to drink; however when we ordered a drink, we were in for a LONG wait! :( for the amount of staff as well as it being a brewery, I would have thought they would have had more bartenders.  We will definitely be back for the food, and make sure to order 2 drinks at a time!!"}
{"text":"Pretty damn good for thanksgiving dinner. Portions could be bigger but they give u more if u ask for it.  Great servers and atmosphere.  Would definitely go again."}
{"text":"This is a craft beer emporium with an American food menu. Stopped in during lunch hour, about 1:30 PM and a handful of patrons were seated at the bar. The bartender greeted me before I sat down and asked if I wanted to see a beer menu, which was most excellent service! The only \"problem\" is that the bar serves beers in 20oz glasses which I believe is a tad too much for responsible drinking & driving, not trying to preach here, but one beer would be my limit. Thus, I ordered a flight of 4 beers @ 4 oz each, also ordered Idaho Nachos & Margherita Flatbread Pizza. Food took about 10 minutes and was hot & fresh, very tasty indeed. If you want a casual atmosphere with decent craft brews, simple comfort foods and friendly wait staff, I highly recommend a visit. Another plus is that there are USB charging outlets under the bar for all patrons...enjoy & cheers!"}
{"text":"Love the food! My favorite thing to get here are the nachos. Pair it with your favorite drink at the bar and it's a great night! They have TVs so you can watch your favorite sports team play and the bar tenders are friendly and fun to talk to and give great suggestions on drinks like the margarita in the picture. Considering the amount of food you get and its quality, it is worth the price."}
{"text":"After a very bad first experience, I just went there for a second and final try.   Monday evening, we sat at the bar. There was only 1 other person seated. There was a tall, thin man behind the bar wearing black.  He never looked at us.   After a solid 5-10 minutes, at the other side of the bar, I see him leaning with his back to the bar, arms crossed & just staring ahead.   I finally said, \"Excuse me.\" He just turned his head & glared at me, while continuing to lean against the bar. Then I had to ask, \"Can I get a drink?\".  He said Yes, but still didn't move for another 15 seconds.  What is wrong with this guy?  Both times I've seen him, he was extremely rude.    He still never waited on us.  He got another girl to come over.  She continued to help us & was very nice. Don't know who this tall, thin guy is, but he is doing NO service to the restaurant.  After the 1st bad experience we said we wouldn't come back.  I thought I would try it again, but see it hasn't changed with this guy still there.  The other 2 girls said they have no intention of coming again, either.    The only reason I'm giving a 2 star, is because of the nice girl who finally waited on us."}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere, Asian shrimp is spiiiiiicy, Asian chicken salad is awesome, beer sampler is great!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a great dinner recently at Granite City.  I had the salmon and it was delicious!  My husband had pasta and my son had steak and they were very happy with their meals.  They started off with some wings and they also enjoyed those.  My husband is a beer drinker and he appreciated the vast beer menu at Granite City.  Our server was attentive and pleasant.  My only complaint (and it's a minor one!) is that the food took a little long to come out and it wasn't too busy on a Friday night."}
{"text":"I'm in between on this place.  I've been here for lunch during the week with a group of friends for lunch and had no problem getting a seat.  I've also been here at 6:00 pm on a Saturday night on my own and had trouble finding a spot at the bar.    The decor and set up is awesome, that much I love.  The longer tables in the bar are good for groups of people, but there's no where to put your coats on them when it's colder out.  Drinks: over priced.  $8 for a Baily's on the rocks and $8-9 for a margarita.  Food: over priced as well.  I got the shrimp tacos, the lunch portion (Friday during Lent) and 2 of them were $12.  Tacos were decent with some good flavor.  I've also gotten the turkey burger, cooked through and ok.  The waffle fries were probably my favorite part of everything.  If someone was meeting me somewhere and wanted to go, I may or may not depending on the day"}
{"text":"Very surprisingly over thrilled. The beer was not what expected, it was better. Same with food.   Had the Cajun Pasta. Perfectly put together. The right amount of pasta to meat and vegetables. Spice was spot on. And portion was large.   Wife had Pecan Pork Chops. OMG, huge!  And 2 of the monster chops. Glaze complemented perfectly cooked pork well.   By all means get the beer sampler. They have put their own touch to each that makes them not what you expect. I like dark brews but found the light ones good too."}
{"text":"Arrived at 12:30 and was advised of a 10-15min wait. At 12:45 we were seated. At 12:50 we gave a drink order, ordered an appetizer, a bowl of soup and a flatbread. At 1:00 we were told they were out of the appetizer (soft pretzels) and I asked for French Fries instead. We left at 1:30 after our waitress (Melanie I think) passed us a dozen times without so much as a word. (Or an obvious drink refill.) She seemed interested in stopping to talk at other tables...and wait stations...and the bar...and the front desk. We won't be back. A bowl of soup, fries, and flatbread shouldn't take 30min in a half-full restaurant that's serving a buffet at the same time."}
{"text":"Met up with some coworkers here on a Friday night. I thought the place would be packed, but we were seated right away. It took a few minutes for my coworkers and I to decide on what to order, but our server was quite accommodating and allowed us the time we needed.  I started off with a glass of cabernet, not sure what they gave me, but it was decent for a $5 glass of wine. Prior to coming here, I wasn't aware that it was a brewery. They offer several beer options. If you can't decide, they do have a beer sampler for about $5. I begrudgingly went with the wine instead as I'm trying to limit my beer intake and had a long drive home!  We skipped the appetizers. I ordered the Bleu Peppercorn Burger, medium, for my main dish. It was cooked to perfection and not too peppery. I thought the crispy onion strings were a little excessive, at first, but once I took a bite, I quickly changed my mind. I ended up eating the whole thing including the side of natural cut fries!  My coworkers ordered the Grilled Salmon Oscar, and BTA with the Northern Cheddar and Ale soup. Both were quite satisfied. They also ordered the \"mini\" dessert, but was actually the perfect size for one. They ordered brownie w/ ice cream and creme brûlée. From the looks of it and their reactions, I wish I had made room!  Our server was quite attentive throughout our visit and even the manager came to inquire about our meals. I would definitely come here again and will certainly try their beers next time. They have decent prices for the amount of food you get. My bill came out to about $18, not including tip. Not bad for a place in Legacy Village."}
{"text":"I really like the bartender,  she kept busy, but had time to recommend some great beer.  I really had a great time"}
{"text":"This was the worst experience I have had at a restaurant in a long time. Went with my family for dinner on a Sunday night. Not one person out of 8 liked their meal. The service was horrible...lots of the blame game and other excuses from the staff. We felt like prisoners in this place because we just wanted to get the bill and leave and that seemed an impossible task. Stay away from this place!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the candied pecan pork chops.  About a 1/2 mile thick, yet cooked perfectly."}
{"text":"We were doing some out of town shopping at the West Town Mall.  We left the mall to look for something to eat only to drive around the area for 30 minutes and find no place interesting or that didn't have too long a wait.  We ended up at Granite City, a restaurant we'd never heard of, just out of desperation.  What a pleasant surprise this place was.  I agree with many of the other reviews that the service was way above average.  Our waitress treated us like old friends and the comfortable atmosphere contributed to this feeling.  After we sat down I discovered this was also a brew pub and so I ordered one of their beers which was very good.  They brought out bread first and we both agreed it had an unusually delicious flavor.  I never order Mac&Cheese but it sounded so good on the menu I went for it.  My girlfriend tried the Quesadilla.  Both were excellent, exceeding anything we expected.  After reading the other food reviews I can't wait to go back here and try some other things.  If you're at the West Town Mall don't miss GC."}
{"text":"I would give this place a 3.5 for the food but the service was absolutely wonderful so i'm rounding up! I came here to grab dinner with my friend and his family. We wanted to eat somewhere to avoid the snow and that was in the middle of us both so when we found that there was a mall with a restaurant and brewery we couldn't resist. Side notes: there is only one entrance and it is outside of the mall. They do not have a connecting door which sucks, but just incase you were wandering around inside the mall, you'll never find it.   Any whoooo, this place is apart of a chain, but they are on site brewers. they have their main batches prepared from a central location but then each of the different locations finish the prepping of the beer. This leads to some potentially different flavors but also allows for alot of guest beers to be featured but using their favorite bases. I loved this idea and was even happier when i found out that if you mention it is your first time visiting they'll give you a flight on the house! If you're not a fan of beer i highly recommend ordering a Shandy (half lemonade half beer) they're delish and free for your first time too! Whats even more wonderful is you can choose which beers you'd like to try or the waitress can choose the flight based on beers you normally drink.   I wasn't too hungry this evening so i got their main caesar salad with salmon. It was delish, but you can't mess up too bad on a caesar. My friend got the mac and cheese and it was really good! They pour their carmally malty beer on top of it, which i wasn't too sure about, but it worked!   I'll definitely be back to try their different foods and guest beers. It wasn't super greatly priced but reminded me of a BJ's or some type of chain like that. It's a convenient location at the mall for a quick lunch or casual dinner.   happy drinking and eating!"}
{"text":"CRAP service!  My husband and I sat at the bar on a fairly UNcrowded Saturday afternoon and waited a LONG time for the bar-tender to notice us.  It was also painfully long to place an order.  The food and beer were average- not great, not terrible.  After we finished our food our empty plates sat in front of us for over 15 minutes while the bartender spent his time counting his tips.  I had my EMPTY glass sitting in front of me for far too long as well.  With all the other options of bars and restaurants in the area I have NO reason to return to Granite City."}
{"text":"This is a review of the Granite City brunch buffet. I arrived to a nearly empty restaurant at 10am on a Sunday morning. After about a 5 minute wait at my table, we were greeted by our server and offered drinks. We were also informed that the price of the brunch buffet had increased to $17.95. Whatever, I thought, if it's good it won't really matter that it's priced at the higher end of Sunday brunches around town.   My mistake: it would have been overpriced at $1.79. I could go on and on about how the choices were limited, about how the Eggs Benedict had been sitting in their pod for so long that everything was congealed and dry, or about how the turkey bacon was a monochromatic strip of cold, limp tasteless faux meat. But you will get the picture if I just say that the best thing this buffet had going for it was the wheat toast. It was all down hill from there.  Do yourself a favor. Make yourself a bowl of cereal and pass on this mess. Especially at $17.95."}
{"text":"I don't understand why this has low ratings - you're not coming here for top chef dinners. The beer is delicious and the food was great. I must say the atmosphere was on point and the service was good. We had salads and a beer. Nice job."}
{"text":"I've always really enjoyed this restaurant! I've tried many items on their menu and it's always delicious. I most recently tried the Turkey Overlake with Mesquite-smoked turkey, thick-cut bacon, tomatoes, garlic aioli, Monterey Jack cheese for $10.95. I also had their Flying Monkey signature drink and it was all very good."}
{"text":"I love this places rib eye, the steak is one of my favorites. Great price and great food. I'm not a huge beer drinker, but they certainly have a wide selection. They are a brewery and have made some pretty tasty beers.  The burgers are good, make sure you get a pretzel bun for even better taste.   I've been here 5 or 6 times, a few times the service has not been all that stellar with waiters forgetting about my table all together.  They have call a head system, but not reservations which means there is usually a wait.    Good atmosphere, appropriate for the whole family."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place has two and a half stars... Although the line wait was ridiculous for large groups it was just the two of us. We like sitting at the bar because the service is always super. We had the delicious vanilla porter, bloody Mary, full rack of ribs, and French onion soup. Everything was tasty. We live in Lakewood and would not mind coming back again soon!! The service was great and the environment was not over the top loud and obnoxious!!"}
{"text":"I've only been here twice so far but I'm already \"in-like\" with this place. My boyfriend and I just moved to Cleveland Heights recently and we're  always in search of a good brewery and happy hour. Granite is only about a 10 minute drive from our residence and I love the vibe of legacy village so it's pretty much in the perfect location.    Let's start with the decor. It's definitely more modern and chic than I would expect from a brewery. And I almost ALWAYS judge a place by its bathrooms. If an establishment takes time to put the same amount of effort and decorating into its bathrooms as it does the rest of the place, the restaurant/bar/etc is USUALLY a winner. Granite City hasn't let me down yet so as of now, my \"bathroom theory\" is on point.   Now, the food. I've mostly only tried the items on the happy hour menu ( chicken wings, Batch 1000 Pork nachos, and the mini Asian shrimp tacos). Everything was delicious. And let's talk about the marinated pork on those nachos! Amaze balls! I could literally just eat those nachos and be satisfied. Also, I was really surprised at how much shrimp came on the tacos, considering that it was the happy hour-sized portion. I would get those again for sure. My mom ordered the fish n chips (which I tasted of course ;)) and it was pretty good.  Crunchy and seasoned pretty well. I didn't care too much for the coleslaw but I'm not really a fan of coleslaw in the first place.   On to the drinks, I ordered the blood orange bourbon sour which was okay but had a weird after taste. Probably wouldn't get it again. My mom ordered the American Mule. She said it was good but disappointed that it didn't come in the typical copper mug. With my mom, it's all about asthetics so of course she felt some type a way about this lol she mentioned it to the bartender who responded \"well, it's an American mule not a Moscow mule so.....\" Anywho, we happened to visit during Craft Beer Week so we were able to try the various in-house brews for a really good price (2.50$ pint special on Tuesday during beer week). My favorite would have to be their staple, Batch 1000. I wasn't too found of their 3 seasonal beers. Again, a weird after taste.   So overall, I will definitely be back to Granite City and I highly recommend staying up to date with their specials by signing up for their eclub. See you soon Granite City!"}
{"text":"Just left Granite city and had one of the worst dinners of our lives.  All our food was cold and was sitting around 20-30 minutes before making it to our table. Service was excruciatingly skow. Flatbread was cold and tasteless and fish tacos were  barely edible. A nice anniversary dinner ruined by a poor service and bad food. Management came over and asked how it was and we said we just want to get out of her and want our check. She did no further digging. After complaining still had to wait  for 15 minutes for check. 72 dollar wasted."}
{"text":"Great prices with okay beer--doesn't measure up to Ale Asylum or Capital beer--and excellent dishes with great flavor that hasn't disappointed. Our expectations have been exceeded every time we've stopped here. My wife LOVES the asian salad, and I try something new with every visit. I definitely recommend this restaurant to everyone."}
{"text":"This evening I had the most wonderful experience dining at The Granite City. We had Adam the server -WOULD RECOMMEND! This was the best meal I've ever had. Got the salmon my friend Jadyn got the GC dip and Idaho nachos. Will come back. Cheesecake Factory has nothing on this West Towne Mall original"}
{"text":"Two words. Sunday brunch!  One of the best in town for being a chain.  Well worth the money!"}
{"text":"Vodka Mussels-excellent. Salmon Crab Asparagus (sans Hollandaise) Excellent. French Soup-best in the midwest. Creme Brule - parochial, inexcusable in it's grade school quality. Only bad thing though-this place is top notch otherwise."}
{"text":"Avoid this place at all costs if you go here you will regret it. There's a reason why they make pens and paper and apparently GC hasn't grasped the concept of this yet,  and that just may be why everyone's order at my table came out wrong. Out of a party of 4, 3 people had to send their food back more than once. And waiting on drinks to come from the bar literally took 30 minutes which actually never came at all it was that long before the manager was asked to come over so that we could explain our concerns with the service, but it seemed as her attitude was as  nonchalant as everyone else's that works there. The final straw was when one person found a hair in there food, at this point it was almost comical but in sad type of way, again the management was made aware of this issue and again nothing was done about that. I wish that I would have read the yelp reviews beforehand because if I did we would have never gone there. They will never see us again in there.  Buyer's beware!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Service is absolutely awful. We went about a year ago and had terrible service. Decided to give it another try and it was worse. We were seated right by the door - it was freezing. There were plenty of other tables available. Server was slow and unattentive. Had to search for her to order our meals after the appetizers. She never checked back to see if we needed more beers, water. Had to ask for someone to find her multiple times so we could get service. I'm done. Won't be back. Managed poorly. Service is awful. Food and beer were good."}
{"text":"The Bleu Peppercorn Burger is an incredible delight. The charbroiled burger is moist and smoky and blends seamlessly with bacon and blue cheese. Scrumptious!"}
{"text":"Stopped in to the Legacy Village location and it was packed!  But the wait wasn't too long and we were able to sit near the bar in the meantime.  Once seated, I had the French Onion soup and the Barrundi (white fish) for my meal.    The French onion soup was delicious.  The barrundi was topped with a burre blanc with sundried tomatoes.  The fish was moist and really didn't need the burre blanc, but it's \"mo betta\" with the burre blanc.  The fish was plated on top of quinoa - flavored I suspected with chicken stock.  Excellent pairing of the quinoa and fish."}
{"text":"Okay, Okay, in all fairness, I must give credit where credit is due.  My first visit to Granite City was a disaster.  I've been back twice, since and both times, I left full and satisfied.  Just by coincidence, I visited 2x in one week.  The first time I had the fish tacos and the puff pasty apple dessert.  The second time I had an awesome flatbread pizza and house salad, accompanied by a Sangria.  The price point was right, the service was good and the food was tasty.  I'm glad that I gave this place a second chance."}
{"text":"My daughter took me to Granite City Brewery for my birthday.  Upon arrival the young people serving as Hosts immediately placed us and were really polite (not something I experience often).  Our waiter (Ray) was an exceptional young man and went to great lengths to ensure we were taken care of properly.  Well mannered and professional he deserves a raise!  The beer(s) I tasted were excellent and I highly recommend the Cheddar Cheese and Ale soup.  The appetizer we ordered was one of the Flatbreads...and it was truly great.  I ordered the Braised Short-Rib, which came with Horseradish Mashed and fresh young Green Beans.  The potatoes were a little lacking in flavor and I missed the Horseradish.  The Short-Rib could have been seasoned better...but all in all...the meal was good.  Well definitely return for more of the goodies on their menu...and the beer too!"}
{"text":"I went to Granite City for happy hour with a girlfriend and had a lovely time. They have a full menu of $5 happy hour options. The pork nachos and the wild mushroom flat bed were delicious! We also enjoyed $5 craft cocktails (can you say Blood Orange Bourbon Sour!?). A great happy hour experience, will be back again."}
{"text":"We like the friendly staff here, although they did have an odd server change the first time we visited. I would say the service is good, but not always as consistent as you might like in the dining room. My pick is to sit in the bar area, which is always spot-on.  The only other major grumble - I had to ask for ketchup with my side of fries, and it seemed like it took 5+ minutes to get it. Weird, huh? why do they send out fries with no ketchup!?!??! c'mon guys! Put it out on the table like the rest of the world! Barring that, the food runner can ask when the food comes out, or (better yet) note when you take the order!   After getting that off my chest, I'll say that I'm a big fan. The beer is good and the food is solid, maybe not spectacular, however there are some pretty tasty items here and there, and as a solo diner, I appreciated having a comfy place to hang out at the bar and have a beer with dinner.  Some of the highlights:  * Truffle fries - these were tasty with a nice truffle hint, a nice starter  while you sip on a beer and decide on what else to order  * Pepper Bacon and Tomato flatbread pizza - the maple pepper bacon was REALLY tasty, and the sliced tomato and cheeses made a nice counterpoint. It can be a bit messy to eat as finger food, but sooooo yummy. I ordered one as my entree and couldn't quite finish it. Wash it down with a cold beer and you're a happy camper.  * French Onion Soup - this had a bit less onion than I might prefer, but had a really nice beefy broth with a nice layer of melted cheese on top. Definitely worth adding on a cup with your sandwich or burger.  Buffalo wings - nice and spicy but not to the point of burn-off-your-face. Great blue cheese sauce, too.  * Chicago Style Prime Beef - this was a sandwich with a very delicious identify crisis - thin sliced beef, onions, bell peppers and a melted slice of cheese on lightly toasted ciabatta bun, and served with a cup of au jus. I'm not sure if it was leaning towards the Philly Steak or French Dip direction, but with the beefy au jus and just the right amount of toasted crunch on the bread, it really hit the mark for me.  Of course, what brew pub would be complete without a good selection of house brews, and Granite City delivers pretty well in the area too, especially when you make it on a Tuesday or Thursday or one of the other days when they have the $6 pitcher specials =-)   The weekend brunch is also amazingly popular. Check it out!   I'm definitely looking forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"I went to Granite City for the first time on a Saturday afternoon.Initially the hostess was going to sit us right away but then said there would be a 10 minute wait. It was relatively empty inside but I assumed maybe they were not fully staffed so whatevs. After a short wait we were escorted to one of the high top tables in the bar area. The register for the waiters to ring in meals directly faced the table,,, can you say awkward! We requested to be moved to a \"real\" table but was told that nothing else was available at the time. We wait for a good 5 minutes when the other party who had came in after us and had been waiting were escorted directly to a booth even though we were told no tables were available. We continued to wait a bit longer while the individuals who were seated after us now had a waiter coming to take their order. No one ever even came to take our drink order after 10 minutes or so we left. So I'm not sure how good the food is but I guess I'll never know. There are too many other restaurants in that immediate vicinity to have such poor service. We went on over to Cheesecake Factory and enjoyed a great lunch there."}
{"text":"First time here. It was pretty packed for a Friday night but got seated within 10 minutes after arriving. My server was very pleasant and knowledgeable of the beer selection. She recommended I try a seasonal called Blue eyed brunette girl. It actually was made with bourbon. The beer was very dark but smooth and you could definitely taste the bourbon. I ordered a chicken bruschetta salad which came to my table in less than 15 minutes. The food was very good and tasty and the portion size was ok. All in all I was satisfied with the service and the food and would go back again."}
{"text":"For the most part I liked Granite City for my first time for the price you get a lot of food I realized I ordered too much food I could not eat it all. Overall the waiters were nice and pretty helpful. I wouldn't  get the drinks just my opinion I think they may be watered down a little expensive. But overall I will eat at Granite City again"}
{"text":"Wait staff was awesome. Food was great. Front desk staff was SO rude. Probably won't come back because of how inconsiderate, impatient and overall rude they were. Also, they say the have \"call ahead seating\" but they don't. But don't worry, the front desk will meanly tell you that when you call to ask!"}
{"text":"A friend and I came for dinner for the first time. I wish I remember our servers name,he was very personable and ultimately helped us decide what we were going to order since we were both torn...everything sounded great. We both ordered appetizers to share,the bbq chicken flatbread and the spinach artichoke dip. Both appetizers were pretty good,we both like the flatbread the best. Adding cilantro to the flatbread was a great touch and added extra flavor. My friend ordered the Fish and Chips. I tried it,I usually hate fish at restaurants but it was yummy. I would ask them to fry it extra crispy though. It definitely is a nice sized portion,especially if you're super hungry. I ordered the Adult Bock Mac and Cheese. Oh my goodness,it was the best dish I've had from a restaurant in a while. It was so creamy and flavorful. The bacon bits on top really added an interesting spin to the already amazing bowl of deliciousness. I also had a small Caesar salad which was pretty good. The lettuce was fresh it could however have used more dressing. The restaurant has a nice atmosphere and the service was pretty good considering how busy it was. I will definitely eat here again!!"}
{"text":"I have been to this resturant on several occasions and every time they exceed my expectations.  They are always very friendly and smiling.  They greet you immediately when arriving.  Asking you where you would like to be seated.  Today I was on a mission to try some of thier craft beers so I chose to sit at the bar.  I truly enjoyed several of thier beers.  The bar was being tended by great bartender that really knew her stuff and also was very knowledgeable about her companies craft beer.  I enjoyed the conversations. I would say my favorite was thier brown ale with a nice nutty flavor.  I also truly enjoyed the amber colored beer.  Unfortunately I cannot remember the names of all the beers.  What I do know is that I will be back again.  I had wonderful appitizers while enjoying my beers.  The prices here are very fair. Stop in and see for yourself."}
{"text":"Granite city, yall call that brunch?? Terribly executed! ! People please don't waste your money here."}
{"text":"Met my family there to catch up on our lives. Because the purpose of our gathering was social we didn't require much attention...yet our server somehow managed to neglect us. Food was cold, drinks were watered down, and service was poor. I won't go back nor do I recommend anyone going there."}
{"text":"Well you would figure that I would learn from my first mistake which I didn't. About 1 year later from my previous review my family went back to Granite City. Initially there was a wait for tables so we gave them our phone and they texted us about 25 minutes later when the table was ready. When we arrived back at Granite City we are properly seated, Ironically, in the exact same booth we sat in one year prior which I'm not sure if that's a good or bad omen. It took our server a few minutes to get around to us and she was pleasant enough, we ordered our drinks which took another few minutes to get. We did decide to get some pretzel appetizers and although they brought plates, they did not bring napkins or Forks. We were able to flag down another server who is able to get us the required silverware and linens.  Now comes the awkward part. Unfortunately I like to time my servers because being in the restaurant business previously I kind of like to know how they're doing. There was a time when I was literally standing up in the booth and waving my arms to any server who would look at me to try to get some sort of service mind you this was about 15 minutes after our drinks were empty and our appetizer plate was clean. There was one server who was over ringing his order in who appeared to notice us but did not do anything. I finally was able to turn around to see a manager type talking with a kitchen manager type towards the back of the kitchen and was able to flag him down waving my arms like a mental patient. This manager finally came over and I was probably a bit terse with him as we were going on well over 15 minutes just to order our food. After explaining the situation that our server was ignoring us as well as every other server in the restaurant I asked him to please place our order we already knew what we wanted and if they could get us another round of drinks as well. now the apologies started coming but at this point that meal was already ruined as we were now close to. Being seated in the same booth and almost 40 minutes indoor meal without any food in front of us. Finally the food came and I really have no complaints about my meatloaf however my wife's linguine was heavily salted. I know this is a chain restaurant but I would hope they would at least try to give a rat's patootie about their tip or the service level they're giving. Unfortunately for our server her tip was commensurate with her level of service. I shan't be returning."}
{"text":"Nice brunch. Very good bacon ,as was made to order omelet.Tasty rare prime rib. No juices? $14.50 price tag on point. Attentive service.Recommend a try."}
{"text":"Came in for a lunch on Saturday with group of 3. Place was not busy by any means. Placed a drink order which took about 20 minutes to come for no evident reason. Drank my pale ale which was actually very good. Promptly left after this due to the continued slow service. I hope for their sake this was an isolated incident but we will not be back. Can't imagine they will be around that area long with all of the competition."}
{"text":"General information: great atmosphere, good food and pretty good selection of their own line of beer.  Our experience: had reservations at 7:30pm and we weren't seated until shortly after 8pm.  Service was pleasant and personable. We came with a group of people, shared appetizer. Appetizers that stood-out was the Artichoke Dip, very tasty!   Meals people ordered that stood-out were the flatbreads, steaks and burgers. Pasta I got was a little too rich, fish taco 2 people got were just okay and the salmon 2 others got were okay.  Overall, had a great time with friends while enjoying a new experience. More likely won't return as we know what they have to offer and more likely be able to experience better elsewhere."}
{"text":"I have been to Granite City now twice since relocating to the Madison area. Both times I found GC a-ok. The first time I was there on a date with my husband. We had heard about Granite City's beers. We tried three different ones and found them a-ok. We were not blown away...but found them good. The same of the food. We enjoyed the experience but just found the food standard.  It was crowded both times we frequented. The first time we brought our infant son. He slept most of the meal in his car seat. However, from the reaction of some guests I wouldn't bring him again. There were other families with older (8-10 age range) children.   The second time I was there, it was for lunch. It again was crowded and I found the food the same. It has a great westside location which is my guess as to its business."}
{"text":"I struggled with the star rating on this. For my birthday, my boyfriend made a reservation for 7:30 and when he called to confirm, they told him they were closed for a private party but we could come before 6:30 if we still wanted to come. Now, when you're taking a reservation from a potential customer, you should probably note if there is a giant party. That's not rocket science. Had he not called to confirm, we'd not have been able to get in to eat at another place at the desired time.  Next, It's really hit or miss with how your served there. You can have a great, attentive server or a server who checks on you once and lets your drinks go unfilled. At this point out of about 7 visits at various times 5/7 times service was a miss. It's really hard to get a server to actually check on you and ask to refill drinks or to see if you need anything. The food is pretty tasty and the beer is good so that's why we go back and it gets 3 Stars. The service really leaves something to be desired. And let's be real, when you go out for dinner, you go out expecting good service at the very least. That's not what you're going to get here 2/3 of the time."}
{"text":"This place is too LOUD.... Why? The food was just ok, service was ok with waitstaff. Bartenders were stuck up.... You're working at GC, this isn't Michigan Ave. sweetie.   Reasons Why I won't go back... 1) Noise level 2) Just okay food 3) Service, was lacking..... A lot...."}
{"text":"I stopped here for of beer or two with my girlfriend after some shopping at West Towne mall.  I didn't know what to expect as Granite City is a corporate chain and I normally steer clear of them. GC was  surprisingly pretty good.  We ordered a flight of beers and some appetizers. As expected some of their beer was just not good but the Bennie was surprisingly delicious. The spinach artichoke was soso but the maple bacon tomato flatbread was a treat."}
{"text":"Terrible service. There was barley anyone working there and it took us over an hour to get our food. The hostess kept walking away so when customers would come in, no one would be there. I saw atleast 10 people walk in and leave in a short period of time. I can only imagine the lost business this place has because of the incompetence of the employees. The food was a disappointment, portions where incredibly  small. I was extremely disappointed in this place and I will never return. The waitress was completely unhelpful and had no idea and what was on the menu or what drinks there was to offer. We asked her what was the best meal and drinks and she was dumbfounded. I hope no one ever goes here and that this place goes out of business so a real restaurant can take over this valuable real estate that this garbage restaurant  is on."}
{"text":"The salmon and chicken Alfredo were both good, the beer sampler they offer for $5 is a great deal and I would recommend giving their seasonal beers and the double IPA a shot"}
{"text":"We had reservations and still had to wait an additional 20 minutes. When I went to hostess stand to ask how much longer, she couldn't even find our pager number, however we were seated immediately. We sat at the bar to wait for friends, had sampler and french onion soup. Both great.  We were seated in a booth. The waitress was awful! Our orders were not complete, we had to ask for condiments with our meals (if you are serving a burger to someone, with fries, shouldn't they have ketchup??? we had to keep asking for water.. ridiculous. The bathrooms were so dark, and dirty! They smelled awful. As we were leaving the restaurant, the same funky smell was through the whole place!  The food was OK, but we probably won't be back!"}
{"text":"One of the best brunch buffets in the area.  We met a couple friends for brunch around noon, today.  There was a 30-minute wait and it was well worth it.  We were seated at a comfortable booth in the bar.  It has been a couple years since I've been to the brunch at Granite City and the food is as good as I remember.  I typically enjoy the breakfast options while my wife enjoys more lunch-style options.  Granite City's brunch buffet has a good selection of both.  Eggs, bacon, sausage along with pasta, garlic mashed potatoes and a carving station for prime rib.  It was all great.  The biscuits and gravy were especially delicious.  Didn't get to try the hash browns because they were so popular that the pan was empty on both trips.  Still found enough space for a sticky bun to round out the meal.  The only disappointment was the Bloody Mary.  I ordered it spicy and what I got was watered-down tomato juice.  Should have ordered a beer, instead.   Typically, there is a mindset that a buffet could mean a lesser quality of food.  Not the case, here."}
{"text":"Tried this place on a whim while we were out today. We really liked it!  The Zug Zwang vanilla porter was great.   The food was bar food, but it was still tasty.   The service was solid as well.   We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Second time here this week, service has gone from bad to worse. None of the staff seem to have a clue of what they are doing. Very slow service, they are unaware of their promotons.  Harder to get a drink than in the Sahara desert.  Food arrives before beer. None of their craft beers are memorable, except for  the Batch 1000 IPA. Only thing they seem to do well is apologize."}
{"text":"I wanted to give this place a great review, but unfortunately I cannot. We arrived at the restaurant a little before 6p on a Saturday night and were told the wait was 35 minutes for a table, which didn't seem too bad. After 45 minutes had gone by and we had still not been seated we started to debate whether we should leave. We decided to stay thinking any moment now. At 1 hr, we went to use the bathroom and noticed at least 9-10 tables were EMPTY! And, we saw the managers on the floor actually waiting tables!! It was then we realized the place wasn't as busy as we thought they were, they were poorly understaffed. After 1 hr and 23 minutes we were finally seated. A manager was our waiter. He was nice, but there were things he forgot to bring with our food that he had to go back for.   My boyfriend tried the beer, which he enjoyed. I ordered a chocolate martini, which was weak, flavorless and disappointing (and I didn't think that was possible with a chocolate martini). Against my better judgement, I ordered a Belvedere and cranberry and was equally disappointed. I spent $20 on two drinks and felt I would have better off ordering a sprite. The food was good, but not enough to overcome the disappointment of the wait time and the weak drinks from the bar."}
{"text":"Still better food than the Dane, except that the Dane has plantains. Not great service in recent times and I'm not digging the food like I was. Still have some pretty decent items like the cuban and the meatloaf."}
{"text":"As brewpubs go, this one seems about par for the now almost clichèd course. Their house-brewed beer is pretty average, but I admittedly only tried the Bennie and the Northern. For a place that calls itself a brewery, offering only 4 or 5 house-brewed beers is weak, at best.  Now the food is where things began to get really shaky. I ordered a medium-rare NY Strip steak and my friend simply ordered wings and nachos. It's pretty difficult to mess up a medium-rare NY strip, right? However, my steak came out painfully dry and overcooked (medium-well, at best), and I never thought I would stare longingly at nachos, but I did. I ate half the steak and devoured the nachos instead.  Overall, I've certainly had better. Even for a brewpub chain, this is lackluster. It can be done so much better than this."}
{"text":"This was an okay spot.  The food and service was okay, but nothing special.  If we were in the area and no where else had seating we would go again."}
{"text":"My Fiancè and I really like this place! They have good in house beers and the food is wonderful. I always get the chicken bruschetta salad, DELICIOUS! My Fiancè gets the spicy shrimp tacos, also delicious! The facility is very big (it replaced a book store, so it's massive) and it's very clean. The only down side is the long cooking time. I like to go during the week when not many people are there. The wait for the food is a good 45 mins, which is a bummer. It's even longer on a weekend night when they actually get busy. If you go with a group of people as least you can distracted by conversation and not notice the long wait as much. I would still recommend this place."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner tonight and it was excellent.  The service was the best we've had at any restaurant in a very long time and the server was attentive but not a nuisance.  I order the salmon which was to die for - blackened with great Asian sauce and veggies.  My husband had fish and chips - five huge pieces of fish.  We brought home two pieces which will be lunch tomorrow.  We truly enjoyed it and highly recommend it."}
{"text":"The wait time is absolutely horrendous! Close to an hour.  Then, the table they took us to wasn't even completely set up. Once at the table, we waited another 10 minutes for our waitress to show  and we've been waiting close to an hour for food. This is not a way to run a business.  When the dessert came out, the other meals, which were burgers, still hadn't made it to the table."}
{"text":"Sorry to right this review but all there fills on beer r short there 20oz is about 2oz short a20oz same 4 there 25oz can anyone in the state of Ohio fill a glass ever were u go in Ohio they short pour  pints in Ohio r only 14oz not16oz sham on Ohio and granit city"}
{"text":"I've been to Granite City multiple times, both for regular meals and for their Sunday brunch.  I have never been let down by their food.  It is in some ways a basic Wisconsin restaurant, however, it has some great distinctive attributes.  Their in house microbrewery adds a nice touch to the drink menu, not to mention that the beers are quite delicious.  On Sundays they have Brunch drink specials, which are always nice. The cheesy hashbrowns and the eggs benedict station on the brunch buffet are definite winners.  On the regular menu, the cheesy ale soup is absolutely fantastic.  I will say that it can get quite crowded for Brunch service, so don't go if you are on a schedule.  All in all, a good restaurant!"}
{"text":"I had lunch here with a couple coworkers, and we were all surprised to not see this place very busy. Our server, Rico was spot on and was very personable. Food was pretty good, maybe a bit on the pricier side but the ambiance is more high-end. It looks like they brew their beer in house but unfortunately didn't have the chance to try any. Would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"We went to Granite City for brunch one Sunday after visiting the mall.  We've heard good thing about the brunch so we figured why not.  The place was packed.  It was an hour wait to sit at a table so we opted to sit at the bar.  For the two of us, my husband and I, we spent about $45 dollars.  That included two mimosas and two brunch buffets.  The buffet was nice although I really think it was hyped up.  They have an omelet station, a carved meat station, a bread station, a waffle station with various toppings, a breakfast food station (thinking bacon and eggs) and a lunch food station.  I visited the carved beef a few times.  It was soooo delicious.  It was prime rib.  The carver was a nice older gentleman that really ensure you left with a smile.  I also appreciated the fact that they had turkey options for the bacon and sausage for those of us that don't eat pork.  The food that I had was good.  I tried the scrambled eggs, however, and didn't quite like the texture and how dry they were.  Otherwise, the mimosas were good and the food was good.  Although I don't see this as our weekly brunch spot, I can see us going back in the distant future."}
{"text":"I checked the reviews here before going but have heard great things from multiple friends so I decided to check it out and see for myself. I have zero complaints about my experience here. We were greeted promptly when we arrived, seated quickly and approached immediately to give our drink order. The server was helpful and friendly, checked on us as often as is reasonable. I got the simply grilled salmon with mixed veggies and green beans and loved it all. My boyfriend got the maple bacon-topped burger with waffle fries and he enjoyed his meal as well. After seeing the low rating on yelp, I can only guess that people had one-time terrible experiences or expect way too much from a casual brewery restaurant. Loved it and will absolutely be back."}
{"text":"This was my 3rd visit to this restaurant and I must say their service hasn't gotten any better! It was a Wednesday night at 5:00 and not very busy. I met a friend and we were seated in a booth for about 8 people! We moved to a smaller booth on our own and asked for a happy hour menu and we were told they didn't have any more available! Really??? I ordered a glass of Pinot noir and was told they were out of the happy hour price wine.. I told the waitress to tell the manager that she should substitute it for another Pinot noir she said she couldn't so I settled on a different wine. After watching our waitress talking to the manager she came back with Pinot noir. The service was extremely slow, the manager never came to the table to see how our meal was. She delivered my friends meal and thought we were sharing then said she would go back and get my meal and came out of the kitchen with two other meals for other patrons. Never saw the manager again! Very slow service and I totally blame the management for the poor service!"}
{"text":"I went this past Saturday afternoon. A friend told me that they have Happy Hour on weekends from 12p-5p, so that was right up my alley. Although 13oz beers are only $3 as the Happy Hour price, I'm a beer drinker, and it was suggested by the server that I try the sampler of the 8 beers they craft themselves. That was $4.95. You can see the brewery in the back which is a cool visual. My favorite beer was the Batch 1000. I like IPA's; this was a double IPA. I also had a BBQ Chicken Flatbread which was great.  There is a LOT of space; I actually wish there was a second bar because it fills up very fast. There's plenty of room for another. I liked how TV's were placed throughout so I can watch sports.   I'll definitely come back again. Very good service (well, the waitress we had that day was good), and the location works for me."}
{"text":"Could've given this place four stars if not for two issues with our meal...  Arrived just before 6:00 on a Wednesday night.  While there were a few open tables, the place was pretty busy.  Got busier during our visit, too.  Food - apps were pretty good.  Tried the Idaho Nachos and the Buffalo Wings.  They were nice enough to put the buffalo sauce on the side since we had kids in our party who can't take the heat.  I had the Blue Peppercorn Burger.  Would've been tasty except for (ISSUE #1) the fact it was medium rare at best, and I ordered medium.  Did not finish burger and left the most undone part for the wait staff to see.  Normally, I would ask for a new one, but that's another issue...the other members of my party were satisfied with their meals TIP: the flatbread pizza on the kids menu is a HUGE serving.  It can easily be shared between two small diners.  Beer - surprisingly good.  Tried an Irish Red, The Bennie and a Two-Pour(?).  Had a couple others they offered that looked good as well.  Nice bar area where I could see myself downing a few while watching a game.  Service: very friendly for sure, but (ISSUE #2) the food took FOREVER to get to our table.  We were seated a few minutes after 6 PM, and while we admittedly had to wait about 10 minutes for my wife to arrive, we did not leave until almost 8 PM.  The main courses took at least 30 minutes to get to our table once ordered, and all we had were a couple of burgers, a couple flatbread pizzas and a bowl of soup.  If our food service was more timely, I'd know we be coming back.  As it is...maybe?"}
{"text":"I agree with most of the reviews on the site. The decor was nice but the food was worse than Applebees but more expensive. I think the hamburger was purchased from the frozen foods section at Giant Eagle and some of my wifes mussles were not open.  Hopefully the place will close and a local place will open to take advantage of the money they spent on decor."}
{"text":"I used to love this place, but they changed their burgers. Much smaller and not as good. Really disappointed in the changes they made."}
{"text":"They are ok... brunch was ok. I think it's over priced and the drinks are watered down. Again just ok"}
{"text":"This place is pretty meh. The beer is best described as watery, over carbonated, and lacking in any flavor.  The servers are friendly enough but the food is very generic and every time I've been there there were toddlers running around and generally making a nuisance of themselves, which, for a brew pub isn't exactly the atmosphere I would expect."}
{"text":"Food and atmosphere is wonderful at Granite City. Unfortunately I cannot say the same about the service. This is my fourth time here and was hoping they would have it more together by now but that's not the case. It just seems like the staff is always confused and no one knows what's going on. Servers are not attentive at all and not educated on the menu. Will definitely still frequent here just fear that if the staff doesn't get it together soon it may not make it much longer."}
{"text":"I'm a stout kind of guy. their stout is good, the rest of the beer is okay.  appetizers are kind of lacking, typical good ole American greasy & flat bread pizza was average... burgers are great, chicken wrap was ok  I'm a mug member so the 25oz is a good price... come here once in a while... nice atmosphere, good decor"}
{"text":"I went for brunch and while the food was pretty good (I don't eat pork, so that ruled out a majority of the options) it wasn't amazing. The temperatures weren't all where they should have been. For example, the mashed potatoes and gravy were cold, which caused the gravy to be congelled.   While the food would probably get 2-3 stars, the service was slow and negligent. The only two times we engaged with our server was when we flagged her down to ask for drinks and when we flagged her down to ask for the check. I noticed that most of the tables around us were recieving the same shoddy service. The woman at the table next to us never even got to order a drink and just went up and helped herself to the bruch buffet. Maybe the morning that I went was an outlier, but based on that experience, I don't think it's worth going back."}
{"text":"Yum!  For a mall restaurant I was pleasantly surprised.  It has a great quality of food and clean, friendly atmosphere.  The booths are big and comfy.    The beer here is pretty good but the food is delicious.  I had a sandwich and the presentation was fantastic.  I kind of wish this restaurant was not at the mall.  I hate battling the parking lot to go to this restaurant.  You would think with neighbors like the Olive Garden, this place would not have the level of service it gives you.    Love, love, love.  Whether you head to West Towne to shop or just to grab a beer here, you will not be disappointed.  I would give it a try, but like I said I hate the parking.  I wish I could write more on this but it is clear, cut great restaurant."}
{"text":"Have not been here in a while. After being taken to our table, it took more than 15 min for the server to come and greet us, even though the restaurant was half empty. The manager came later and offered a joke of an excuse. Food was fine, but customer service is below standard, Will not come back in a while."}
{"text":"Good food and drinks.  Slow service.  Poorly cleaned floors felt filmy under my feet.  Tables were also poorly bussed."}
{"text":"Once again I was not disappointed. Had the flatbread pizza and it was very good. If you like fish you must get the fish and chips. They are the best in the city."}
{"text":"Very annoyed that they want to call me by name and shake my hand.  All just seems a little to intrusive.  Beer garden could be cool if they build a fence around it.... Otherwise you'll be staring at lots of blacktop and Sears."}
{"text":"I have only been to Granite City for brunch, so I can only review that portion of their menu, but I think the food is easily worth the $18 if you come hungry... They have prime rib, amazing cinnamon buns, bacon, sausage, cheesy shredded potatoes, mashed potatoes, alfredo pasta, soup, waffles and french toast with toppings, biscuits and gravy, an omelet bar, plus salad, pastries, and fruit. And that is only the stuff I can remember off the top of my head, so needless to say, there is a large variety. They do only have the brunch on Sunday mornings, and there are a lot of large groups who go, so you may have to wait in line for a minute or 2 to get food, but it is so delicious it's worth it.  They do try to push selling beer at all hours since they are technically a brewery, and to be honest that is the last thing I want on a Sunday morning, but that is my only complaint. If you find yourself at Legacy Village on a Sunday morning, check out Granite City!"}
{"text":"NIce restaurant.  Good service.  Absolutely delicious soup."}
{"text":"Bad beer, bad food, bad service! What more could you ask for. Three of us had fish and chips which our terrible waitress said was awesome. I guess she has never had good fish and chips because this was like fish fingers and waffle fries on a bed of wilted lettuce. And it was cold. It took 15 minutes to get a cloudy barely drinkable pale ale. I would never go back to this place, there are just too many better alternatives"}
{"text":"Came for Sunday Brunch.  Came with a group of 13, and seating was somewhat fast as we called in 30 minutes before we arrived.  Once we got there, it took 15 minutes for us to be seated. Food was good, however they ran out of some entrees during the buffet, and they did not refill them.  That was a bummer.  Another issued I had was they did not refill my water, even after I asked for a refill.   All and all an average experience.  I believe for the price ($14.99 each) the customer service was under par, especially when it came to not replenishing the food."}
{"text":"I joined my mom and aunts for dinner in the middle of their annual post Thanksgiving shopping trip.  Granite City was close to the shopping so we stopped in here.  It was fairly average.  I'd say the food was better than the beer.  The portions are huge.  Our waitress was really nice, though it would been good if our soups/salads had come earlier than our entres.  This place is worth a shot if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Loved the beer cheese soup, the soft pretzels, and the beers. A flight of beer is very reasonably priced. The Northern Light really pairs well with the beer cheese soup.  The service by the bartender, Andy, was good. He was attentive, polite, and very informative about the beers he was pouring for us."}
{"text":"This place is very kind hearted and down to earth.  The new manger is taking matters into his own hands.  I have more than enough faith he will continue to make Granite City a fantastic place to go out to eat, enjoy a sports game and have amazing be"}
{"text":"Been here twice. Good food. Long waits though for both times. I love the cookie cake they have for dessert (warning: has nuts in it for those who are allergic). Also reccomend the half slab or full slab ribs and the burgers."}
{"text":"Very disappointing experience.  Flatbreads were served ice cold.  They were replaced with an apology, but at least one should have been comped, or a complimentary dessert served.  The final straw was when a busboy cleared the table into a container he carried, containing dirty, disgusting dishes from other tables.  Gross!!!  This wasn't at a camp, but at a restaurant. This was reported to management, which apologized and promised to better train the staff."}
{"text":"All show. No substance.  Our server was not so good. Messed up drink order. Kept forgetting to bring water. No silverware.   The place looks spectacular, but food is very average. Burgers seem like frozen patties. Fries are frozen for sure.   Bison burger was small portion.   Pretzel sticks were good but cheese sauce had a crusty layer on top.   The place is not worth the price. It's no better than chili's or TGIF."}
{"text":"Friendly servers, food was ok/average. Cool interior. Happy hour pricing is good but make sure to get your order in before it ends as the bar can take awhile and you can get charged the regular price if you aren't careful."}
{"text":"Went there this afternoon since there was a 60 min wait at B Spot for 2. Was very disappointed with the turnaround time for a buffalo chicken wrap and a salad- it took about 30 minutes after ordering.   When the food finally arrived, the salad was definitely from a bag and the lettuce was overly stumpy- not leafy green like one would expect.  The chicken wrap was ok...and I subbed in the garlic mashed potatoes instead of fries and they were COLD. They weren't bad, just cold.   Not wanting to complain and have to wait any longer - I took about 70% of my meal to go and we abandoned the majority of the salad too.    There are a lot of other places where I can get a much better $30 lunch and not have to be there for 90 minutes . (No booze consumed). -  we won't be going back!"}
{"text":"We had the best dinner here tonight.  The only complaint was that our dinner arrived right after our appetizers. The food was delicious.  They are also offering $5 pitchers which is a steal. Kelsey, our waitress, was unbelievable.  She is a must to a fun dinner!!!  Ask for her when you go in.  Funny, kind, quick and good with kids.  Excellent night out and good value for the food."}
{"text":"Service was a bit slow, but friendly and the food was mediocre at best!  I tried the chef suggested meatloaf and the meat tasted old/reheated - Yuck!  We liked the decor and the drinks were Awesome!  If we go back, it will be for bar service only."}
{"text":"Today was our first time here. We were interested in trying some place new.  We opted for the brunch because it was served buffet style. However, apparently we came late because there wasn't much left and they refused to refill anything. Kinda bummed about that. Especially because we had to wait 30 minutes for a table.  I ordered a blueberry mimosa and that was tasty.  What was left at the buffet was okay, however it all made me very very ill and I've been unable to leave my bathroom since getting home.  Our server was awesome and the restaurant was clean. We just won't be returning for the sheer fact I've been in the bathroom for over an hour."}
{"text":"Came here around 5 pm on a Saturday with a friend. We were originally just looking for a happy hour, but the menu swayed us to order an entire meal! Also, they don't have a happy hour on Saturdays, not uncommon or even a deal breaker, just very disappointing. I had the betta chedda burger and my friend had the ruebon. We both really liked our entrees! Our server was very attentive and offered samples of not only the beers on tap, but the beer mixers as well! I was pretty disappointed at the lack of Hefeweizen, but the Bennie wasn't bad. We left feeling full and slightly tipsy, exactly what you want from a brewpub experience! I've had many friends and family members turn their noses up at GCB because it's technically a chain, but it's a good one and I will be bringing them there to taste it!"}
{"text":"You think with the restaurant being also being a brewery the beer would be out of this world, but I was not all that impressed. I like hoppy IPAs and just couldn't find one that satisfied my craving of a cold beer. The food is good, lunch menu is decent with more than enough food. If you are looking for a good beer, I'd skip this place."}
{"text":"Nothing to make me want to come back.  There are much better places to eat in Madison and other places have the added benefit of not being anywhere near the mall."}
{"text":"You expect a brewery to have really good, hearty and home style selections made from local sourced products.  You also expect, that as a brewery there's going to be a sizable bar to pull up to. Sadly, neither is the case.  The food tastes like boil-in-bag reheated fare, the kind you get at Applebee's only covered in butter to make up for it.  Everything swims in grease.  If you can find a seat at the bar, you'll be waiting for service.  At least when they opened they thought they didn't have to pay attention to you. If my bartender doesn't make eye contact, or seems to be to good to keep my beer full, find a new job.  Because I'll certainly be finding the next new bar.  Case closed."}
{"text":"Mediocre food. Pleasant servers. He got a beer flight with decent flavors, but we weren't blown away. I'd go here again if there was a long wait at every other restaurant in the area and they offered a huge discount."}
{"text":"Went there twice during the Legacy Village Restaurant Week.  The cheddar soup is perfect!  Very creamy, but not super rich, thick or too overbearing.  Love the combination of the rye bread croutons with the cheesy soup.  The first time I went I had the ribs, with corn on the cob and cole slaw.  The ribs were downright amazing.  Pull off the bone tender, juicy, and perfectly messy to eat just the way ribs are supposed to be.  I will note that a friend who ordered them the same meal seemed to get the short end of the stick and her's seemed much tougher.  The corn on the cob was perfectly cooked and seasoned.  For dessert I had the mini brownie sundae.  It took FOREVER to get to the table.  Like I'm talking greater than 25 minutes after they had cleared our plates from the entrée.  The manager came over to apologize once, and the waiter as well, but it was getting to take so long I was ready to leave.  There was no comping or extra treats for our wait, which wasn't expected but would have been a nice bonus for the wait.  The brownie sundae once we got it was good, but not amazing.  If I went back I'd skip dessert and head over to the local ice cream place instead for a much more delicious dessert well worth the calories.  The beer was great.  I had their shandy made with lemonade and it was a perfect balance of beer with a little sweetness from the lemonade.  Nice and light and summery.  Would definitely order again.  The ambiance is great.  I couldn't believe how large it was inside.  It is definitely a comfy cozy restaurant that will do great in Legacy Village."}
{"text":"Wasn't sure what to expect with the mixed reviews but we had a very good experience. The food was good. My daughter was the only one that felt her salmon was a little over cooked but burgers, salad and soup for the rest of us were very good. Chocolate cake for desert was delicious but glad we elected to split it amongst ourselves because we still couldn't finish. I would definitely return again. It was a Sunday night so slow service was not an issue."}
{"text":"The hamburger my mom ordered had a flimsy ass top bun. It looked like someone sat on it, or used a rolling pin and rolled it out. The inside of the top was burnt, like a grilled cheese sandwhich. She's been waiting like 10 minutes to eat it. Hasn't touched it. Not sure if we will come back or not. Our server (whatever the hell his name was) was hard to get when we needed something."}
{"text":"I have to preface this review. I have been going to GC for 13 years regularly. This is the the first location I've been to that, i would consider a failure, in dining experience and multiple ways. It wasnt just one fail. I actually own stock in this conpany, Since 2008!  So it saddens me to write this. But it has to be done."}
{"text":"Being new to the area, I am constantly venturing out to find new and exciting places to eat. I must say that I am not a fan of beer but I was shopping in Legacy Village and I smelled a wonderful aroma coming from Granite City and had to give it a try.   My experience was very pleasurable. First, I was seated quickly and was able to have the table of my choice. The service was great. The waitress explained the menu and offerings quite well. Additionally, she gave her personal suggestions and helped us to navigate the menus easily.   Now on to the food...the Idaho nachos were nothing short of amazing! Don't forget to order the Granite City dip. It's a must. Although they charge $1.99 for it, it is worth every penny. The dip is a sour cream based concoction with a curry-ish paprika flavor. When you add it to the nachos you have an explosion of flavor. Honestly I didn't need to buy a meal. I was full after I ate these. I also had the shrimp tacos. I didn't like them. They were too saucy and the shrimp were minuscule.  Overall, it's a great place to eat when shopping in Legacy Village and the wait is not nearly as long as Cheesecake Factory"}
{"text":"Had dinner with several friends. I had a couple of beers, an Elf and a Duke. Both were very good. The Elf was more of a Christmas Ale or Winter Warmer. The Duke was like an American Pale Ale. I had meatloaf with green beans and mash potatoes. The service was great and very helpful continuing to check in with us and fill water glasses. This a great alternative to the other restaurants near by."}
{"text":"Every time I come to madison I have to come eat here. Sometimes the wait is long to be seated, but the food is definitely worth the wait!!! Soups are amazing, fries are perfect, breakfast was amazing, burgers are to die for, drinks are pretty good to!  Everytime I've been at this restaurant the waiters have been amazing, bartender at the main bar wasn't so nice, but the waiters made up for that."}
{"text":"I was there with friends the day after Thanksgiving.  They were serving their happy-hour menu late-night, though that doesn't seem to be advertised on their website, so I don't know if that's an ongoing or just a Thanksgiving break thing.  The place seems to be gunning for some of the same business as the nearby Cheesecake Factory, they have a very colorful cocktail menu and hearty appetizers and meals.  I tried one of the house beers (\"The Bennie\"), which was great!  Everyone was pleased with the food (fancy flatbreads and substantial sandwiches), and the service was also good.  Still a few bumps, it was a crowded night and they were out of some of the house beers and some of the more popular food items.  But it was a fun night, and I'd be glad to go back."}
{"text":"Look, I'm not a fan of chains to begin with but my fucking family doesn't trust hole-in-the-wall mexican joints so every so often I gotta put up with fucking Granite City. When it comes to lunch and dinner this place is nothing special. I've also had issues with wrong orders and food not arriving at the same time.  However they get a 3 because they do have a pretty dynamite Sunday brunch. The stout is the best beer on tap."}
{"text":"Terrible. We called when we were 5 min away and were told no wait. When we arrived the wait had magically increased to 25 min. However, there were many tables visibly open. Not a way to run a restaurant."}
{"text":"Better than the food court for sure. Great salads, buffalo wings and soup! Burgers are mediocre."}
{"text":"Food horrible chicken taco from happy hour menu no flavor, boneless chicken wings same . Waitress Ashley slow n the place was empty at 4pm today Tues. kept badgering us to order food while we had a cocktail, told her come back in 10 mins she finally came back 20 mins later, had to ask for silverware, water... slow slow slow. Only good item was a happy hr drink, will not go back******update MANAGEMENT, from reading a lot of bad reviews due to the slow service and tasteless food what are you doing to improve?? A lot of dumb ppl stating what do you expect it's a chain are not use to going out,no matter the price you expect good service and good food, that's what keeps ppl going bad and eliminates bad reviews"}
{"text":"We had a great experience here. Seated right away on a Saturday night and had spectacular service. Many options of food to choose from on the menu, seafood, steak, pastas, burgers, tacos, & sandwiches. They have beer, wine & cocktails which I would recommend the Strawberry fields martini. . Delicious! Very cozy, warm and rustic environment. . I loved it and I would definitely tell anyone to give it a try!"}
{"text":"For those of you who have been to a BJ's, this is like that but with good service and food that doesn't make you sick. The beer is decent and they put pork on waffles. I'd go back."}
{"text":"Whenever we visit Cleveland, I do not hesitate to say that we will be going to Granite City for lunch/dinner. I have yet to have a meal I did not like.  The first time I went to Granite City, I ordered the Asian Flatbread and WOW was it better than I expected! It is probably big enough for 2, but you know I ate that whole thing by myself! It was delicious! I also ordered an oatmeal stout (I forget the name), but it was glorious. I ended up getting a pitcher because I think it was cheaper than getting one or two beers! Can't beat that!  The second time I went, they were having their Oktoberfest specials! I didn't get beer this time, but we ordered twice as much food haha. We started with the loaded waffle fries and pretzels with beer cheese (which are a must!). The loaded nachos, even drenched in cheese and other topping, were still crunchy! The pretzels, well, I'll let you try them for yourselves! Then I ordered the Reuben...let me tell you...they loaded that sucker up with LAYERS of corned beef and just enough sauerkraut! With a side of their fries - you won't leave on an empty stomach!  Unfortunately I haven't gotten to their desserts, but maybe I've built up enough momentum for my third trip. We'll see! ;)"}
{"text":"After moving back to Cleveland i stumbled upon this place during craft beer week. They have a pretty awesome happy hour(The only time I've been) from 3p to 6p. Cheap drinks and cheap food that u can't beat. The decor is pretty nice inside. I've also heard they have a pretty nice brunch on Sunday. I got the pulled pork nachos which was amazing and a big portion during happy hour. The pork alone was great since it was made with their batch 1000 beer. Also 3p-4p is the sweet spot to go because lunch end at 4 and happy start at 3, so you get the best of both worlds!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love coming here. The food is delicious (with HUGE portions! I get at least three meals from one dinner!) Service is always extremely friendly and attentive. It's one of our favorite date night restaurants."}
{"text":"We went for dinner this past Friday night. There was no wait to speak of. The host and server were great- pleasant, well spoken, on their game. The menu looks excellent and all four of us were buzzing about the selections.  The food was disappointing. The meat flatbread was cool and bland, reminiscent of old Trade Winds pizza. Really. A chicken pesto sandwich contained a charred dry breast. The kids pasta wasn't bad, and the pork and waffles were damned good. We did wait some time for our food, so we decided not to ask for anything to be replaced.  Conclusion- food doesn't live up to the menu descriptions, it's not fast, but the people are nice."}
{"text":"I'd never been to a Granite City before this visit. Apparently they are a regional restaurant & brewery chain.  I came in for dinner one evening - and to try out a flight of brews.  I sat at the bar and ordered the meatloaf - which was actually very good. If I was ranking Granite City only on my food experience - I'd give them 4 stars. But...  I also ordered two flights of brews:  The Northern (American Lager) (4.4% ABV) Peel Off (Witbier) (5.5% ABV) Prairie Vixen (Hefeweizen) (4.8% ABV) The Admiral (Pale Lager) (4.7% ABV) The Duke (Pale Ale) (5.4% ABV) Batch 1000 (DIPA) (7.2% ABV) Nemesis (Black IPA) (5.5% ABV) Oktoberfest (6.1% ABV)  I found all of the brews to be very vanilla - very average. Nothing about any of them got my taste bud excited. None of them were bad, just, well, average.  The service at the bar was pretty good."}
{"text":"I've had great experiences here and horrible experiences. The first time we went in, we loved it! It has a nice & fun atmosphere. We got speciality drinks and the cookie dessert, both were great. Our next visit we got dinner, service was slower and the food was ok. We decided to give it another try and stopped in for lunch. The hostess was rude and we sat at our table for 20 -30 minutes without a server stopping by once even after we mentioned it to the hostess. We ended up walking out and haven't been back since."}
{"text":"Granite City is the best! I LOVE their Pork Nachos! They have beer specials almost every day of the week! Can't beat it!"}
{"text":"The brunch is well worth it.   Prime rib is the only drawback as the au jus is not noticeably next to the meat it is however over by the potatoes. Heated Aus Jus is needed to further cook the medium temperature meat without drying it out, nor over cooking the item.   If it wasn't clear; I don't like bloody meat.    Moving along: there always seems to be a wait on Sunday. However, the restaurant did a bang up job of replenishing things as the brunch was winding down which is most appreciated as most buffets do not embody this practice.   The fruit was fresh and sweet. My word those were great selections (three different berries and watermelon).   The hash browns ran out and ask for more the server brought them to the table. Her name: Heather. Not the quickest with the refills but she holds her own in banter as we had a Heather in our party. I loved the freshly made mashed potatoes. Notice..I'm a carb-o-holic so I can give it to you raw and uncut how to compare the carbs. I did good and only got a snail sized portion. Asked for my prime rib to be heated and they threw it on the grill and returned a sirloin-esque prime rib. My heather enjoyed it - me, not so much. I loved the attention to requests.   Biscuits were akin to homemade buttermilk biscuits. Good Job.  Don't know what was in the gravy for the biscuits but it looked like rotel dip.  Honey child they made a spicy sausage dish with peppers that I only got a sampling but I think of it fondly. Good job. Not to hot, just the right spice can be appreciated by any Cajun or Louisianian such as myself.   Would I pick them over Samba? Maybe once a quarter. Would i say this is worthwhile: hell yea (in my Drake voice).   Value: 4 stars Price: 3 stars - it's about average as everyone else but should be less. It's brunch not dinner.  Although there are a lot of places in New Orleans that charge $25+ for brunch, but this ain't Nawlins' Ambience: 2 - Hate to say it but it's true. Water dripped from the ceiling with no warning, no notices in place right by the prime rib and eggs benedict station. This turned off a party member.  Service: 3 - busy or not, they don't float enough for me. Refills are essential as it's just water.  However, the manager made it a point to ask around before closing the Brunch buffet. Cool~ Overall: 4, as I'm a fan based on this visit and the previous ones."}
{"text":"I stopped in for my lunch with my family. We sat in a spacious booth with a great veiw of the resturant! Our server was fantastic! Her name was Tam, she always kept our drinks full and provided us with all the information we needed about the menu! The lunch combos were the perfect size. The rest of the staff was also very friendly, and stopped by on occasion to check on us. The manger Jackie, came to check on us at the very end of our meal...just to make sure every thing was perfect for us. Overall a wonderful experience, can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"A very solid brunch choice!  Prime rob, omelet station,  cinnamon rolls and plenty of hearty dishes on the buffet.  Something for everyone at a very fair price."}
{"text":"I miss Joseph Beth and their amazing little cafe.  I dropped by Granite City with some coworkers for some holiday cheer and happy hour action. (4-6 pm weekdays, 12-5 pm on Saturday) They have a huge selection of $5 cocktails and select drafts for $3. They also had some appetizers available for $5 and flatbreads for $6.   I was the second in my party to arrive. The first person to arrive was seated in a booth in the bar area. He waited for awhile hoping to see a server but ended up having to flag down a manager. I had a similar experience. I waited for over 10 minutes and then physically got up to talk to the handful of managers who were standing around the bar area. The one I spoke with was nice and very apologetic and took my drink order. So then I waited some more. The person who ended up being our server eventually sauntered up to the bar and must have been told by the manager to pay better attention to use because she brought my drink over right after that. When the next person in our party arrived, she was able to order pretty quickly, but it took seemingly forever for her to get her drink. I know this because we were waiting to do a toast, and I sat looking at my $5 skinny margarita with puppy dog eyes.   The first round went down pretty quickly and we wanted to order another drink before 6pm but...there was no one to take our order. Our waitress showed up at 6:02 and told us we were SOL. Nicely, but  we were pretty unhappy because we were there for happy hour. (my $5 skinny margarita turned into an $8.75 margarita after 6 pm)  There were a few vegetarian options on the menu but no vegan options. Besides a couple side dishes. To not feel left out while my coworkers noshed on pizza and spicy shrimp from the happy hour menu, I sadly ate a side of sweet potato fries. Weep womp. They enjoyed their food. Good thing because it's not like anyone checked on us to see how our food was.   To be honest, I was a little embarrassed to have suggested this venue for a happy hour. Sure, the pricing was great and the ambiance was cool (lots of stone, fireplaces, etc.) but...the poor service coupled with the lack of vegan options doesn't make me want to go back anytime soon. I guess if you're looking for some cheap drinks and aren't in a hurry, this is the place to go, but otherwise? Go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and friendly staff.  Had a problem with CO2 system when we were there so they had no beer.Bummer. Food is good."}
{"text":"Went for the first time Sat, 11/23/13. Was seated fairly quick(2).the service was really slow. Waited almost 20 min for our drinks. No silverware on the table. Waited for condiments in mid meal. House wine was $12.00(seriously). They have many KINKS to work out b4 I go back.food was ok."}
{"text":"Nice place to stop in and have a quick micro-brewed beer and a great appetizer and or lunch after an exhausting shopping spree at west town mall.. Very nice bar and wait staff.."}
{"text":"We went there for a business dinner. Salmon too dry"}
{"text":"Yes I am a fan but I do have one major criticism, the prime rib is wayyyyyy under cooked. It is very raw in the middle and I will only eat it if I can get an end piece. The sausage is wonderfully rich, the Mimosa's are delishious, and the eggs benedict table is great with all the different ways you can order it."}
{"text":"Went to dinner there tonight.  It is crowded, but an early 6pm arrival time should assure a table without a wait.  The food continues to be good and the service outstanding.  The menu is large and the flatbread margareta (sp?) is terrific.  While it is designated as an appetizer, it is enough for an entire meal.  Its primary business is a brewery, but the operators are savvy enough to have many other choices for those of us who don't like beer."}
{"text":"All of the food I've had has been mediocre at best, and the service WAY overworked.  BUT... it has a great new thai chicken salad- that's definately worth getting again."}
{"text":"Felt obligated to review after my second visit. Wait time was great: walked right in. Unfortunately we were met at hostess station with a server throwing a fit about something. Not a great showing to begin our dinner. We then waited 15 after ordering drinks for the server to reappear.   My wife ordered the pasta with chicken, asparagus and prosciutto: not much flavor and extremely oily. My fish and chips was alright but the portion size was disappointing (I don't have a huge appetite at dinner but this didn't fill me up even after an appetizer). My son's burger was barely worthy of a McD's Happy Meal: tough and tasteless with a greasy bun.   We missed out on dessert because our dinner took 90+ minutes to complete and our 9 month old was running out of patience.   In summary: the lack of professionalism and overwhelming ineptitude of the entire staff is a true disappointment considering this restaurant is in a prime, upscale shopping area. Will not ever go back."}
{"text":"Granite City is the place to be if you want to have fun with friends or office mates. Catch up with life after work while drinking your favorite beer or cocktails. Servers are very attentive and always have a smile on their faces! Try  Belgian wheat beer!!!"}
{"text":"Our biggest problem with Granite City was figuring out where the entrance was! No, really... we entered from the patio. Whoops!  Our server was really fun, and provided a lot of good advice on the beers here.  My wife had the beer flight, and said she was a fan even of the varieties she doesn't normally dig (the hoppier ones).  My cheeseburger was probably more on the medium-well side than the medium I asked for, but it was still very juicy and had good flavor - it might be that the thinner, wider patties are harder to prepare.  The fries were perfect, and the dessert (a small molten brownie with ice cream and caramel) was delicious and larger than I thought it'd be for a \"taster\" - it was enough for two, after a meal.  We'd mentioned to our server that it was our first visit, and the manager stopped by to see how we'd enjoyed our food and gave us a coupon for our next visit.  Overall, it was a great experience.  Our excellent server is what pushed it to 4 stars, and the tasty but not amazing burger keeps it from a 5."}
{"text":"A typical chain restaurant (that I had never tried) - I was hungry, tired, and wanted a quick meal so I popped in here after a short taxi ride  I ordered a beer and cheese soup and an Asian salad. The soup was surprisingly good, but hurt my stomach after a while. The salad was decent."}
{"text":"Went from never having gone to Granite City, to being there twice in a week. Whoa nelly. The first time I went was for dinner last week Wednesday. My dinner date and I went all out. Drinks (Flying Pig and Juicy Watermelon), appetizer (spinach artichoke dip), and entrees (fish taco trio and grilled chicken asparagus linguini).  Second time I went was last week Friday for happy hour. I had white wines, the GC signature mojito, and flat breads. The flat breads were really great! For $8 each, I was able to try the Maple Pepper Bacon & Tomato and the Margherita. Both were tasty and crispy and filling.   The drinks really are the main issue and reason why they only get an A-OK rating. They were just... weak. Sometimes that happens during happy hour, but on a Wednesday? How dare you hoodwink me on my alcohol content when it is being paid for with the full price! Plus, the food was really just basic for the most part. Nothing you couldn't make at home. Plus my pasta was remarkably drenched in oil."}
{"text":"Granite City sits between 2 stars and 3 stars but not quite a 2.5 stars.   Went there last night with my boyfriend to use one of our free appetizer vouchers we received from the manager during a previous occasion due to service.   Decided to try the Asian Glazed Shrimp as an appetizer. It sounds/looks better than what it  actually taste. This wasn't \"Asian\" at all. It is presented beautifully. That's the one positive things I can say about the appetizer. It comes with a salad which consist of cabbage, tomatoes, green peppers, this white mayo dressing  and I am assuming a chili  spice. The only thing \"Asian\" about the salad was the cabbage. I have never known any Asian dishes to use tomatoes or dressings. It was an assortment of ingredients that didn't fit the name. The shrimp weren't bad. The glaze tasted like it was made with a teriyaki or sweet and sour sauce. The shrimp were large sizes (NOT jumbo like the menu claims) however, you get 8 shrimp for $13. WHAT?! Forget that. Thank goodness we got it for free or I would have been extremely upset to pay such a price for poor food.   For my meal, I ordered the Peppercorn Burger with no bacon. ( I don't eat pork. BTW: Why does nearly everything on their menu have pork in it?!?!?) My burger was decent but had far too much going on. It comes with onion strings, bleu cheese, tomatoes and a pickle spear. I think they may use a certain kind of sauce or marinade for the burger patties. It would have been idea to have pickle chips instead of the spears but whatever. The burger was very juicy/greasy which caused it to get very sloppy and hard to eat. My fries were hot which is good at least. However, they were salty. Considering they used sea salt, they really do not need to go crazy on the salt content. I dash would have been fine. I almost sent them back but decided against it. I ended up brushing off the salt on a napkin...  The worst part for me was later that night when I began to feel uneasy. I had a hard time sleeping  because the food was so heavy. It was like it was stuck in the pit of my chest and wouldn't go down. Still the next morning, after hardly getting much sleep, I continued to have the same feeling until I went and got some soup to settle my stomach better.    I really don't know what to make of Granite City now. The last two times I've dined there have been bad. I know they are switching management. I really hope to see some major improvements. They have potential to be a great restaurant for the west side of Madison but really need some tweaking."}
{"text":"Another Sunday brunch spectacular!  Thanks for going well beyond to make our get together a success:)"}
{"text":"Good beer and food. Went here and a date. Service was very good. They give samples of the beer so try as many as you want!"}
{"text":"Came in hoping to find a great brewery that was close to home, left with the fear of never leaving our bathroom."}
{"text":"Go to this restaurant for the atmosphere and the beer.  The food is mediocre.  I came to Granite City because I wanted to eat at Legacy Village, but eat at someplace different from Claddagh's or the Cheesecake Factory.  The restaurant is very large and was reasonably busy, but not very crowded, on a weeknight.  The outdoor patio was not very large, but comfortable.  I ordered the grilled chicken and asparagus linguini.  In my opinion, the chicken was not seasoned well.  I was also disappointed with the sauce, which to me was watery and not very flavorful.  The portion size was average - filling, but not as large as I would get with a similarly sized/priced dish at Cheesecake Factory.  Overall, not too impressed.  Wouldn't mind coming here again though just for a beer on the patio."}
{"text":"Granite city has a lovely decor wide space and very comfy atmosphere. The server ashley was kind knowledgeable but not overly chatty. She also had a cute little bun in her hair! I ordered the cajun pasta and wedge salad with light sauce very tasty. My sexy date ordered the chicken salad sandwhich and house salad which she enjoyed. She forgot to ask for no walnuts though, what a silly bean she is. I like the way the staff dressed. The place was very tidy n clean. I guess it would be cool if I could get my salad before my pasts when ordering off the lunch menu, however im assuming most people are on a timeline when dining at that hour (not a complaint) The manager came and said hi to us which was nice, but is just bait for yuppies to complain so be careful staff!. 4 stars.I cant give 5 stars because I didnt have a drink there. I definitely recommend."}
{"text":"If you like warm beer and do not get the salad and app that you ordered , then this is the place to go. We told our waitress our beers were warm and she said next ones would be colder but they were not. The waitress was very good but she had too many tables to accommodate us. The manager came to our table but did nothing about our issues."}
{"text":"Well I wish I could tell you how the food was but I never had a chance to order. 20 minutes and order for drinks was taken but no drinks. Wife asked someone else near bar and they said good food but service is terrible. That said it. We paid for drinks and left.  I wish managers would read this and fix thinks. They missed out on a $150 table. Good luck staying in business."}
{"text":"Love the Mac n cheese. Ask to have it baked, makes it even better! The food and atmosphere hVe changed over the years but I've had a good experience the last several times I've eaten here. The wait for a table on a Friday night isn't so unreasonable anymore now that there are other places to eat around the mall. Always like the beer selection and order a two-pull."}
{"text":"I used to be a weekly regular at GC because they had a versatile menu, great consistency, and warm services.   Unfortunately the key word here is HAD. I don't know if there's been a change in management or kitchen staff, but recent visits have been way off. I'm not jumping to conclusion here. I have made enough visits to confirm their down slide which brought me to the decision to part ways after 4 years of loyal patronage.   After numerous inattentive high school eye rolling hosts and \"i don't give a f\" waitresses, the $15+ big show burger was the straw that broke the camel's back. Yes you read that correctly. $16+ including tax for a burger in the midwest. Not NYC, not Vegas, but here. In Madison. At a CHAIN restaurant. I can overlook the price if the burger weren't so overcooked that the meat became crumbly even though I asked for medium rare, and the bun was stale. I asked for a side of mayo assist in swallowing the meat and left the buns on the pate. If you're a brewery it's almost illegal to do burgers wrong.   I'm literally done. And judging from the general attitude of the staff it's very likely that i'm more saddened by this break up than they are."}
{"text":"A chain, only one in WI.  Before our food arrives it really resembles a Claim Jumpers.  But it is brewery too.  I am trying a Bock & Wheat. Food and service excellent. Very high level casual!  We will be back next time in Madison!"}
{"text":"A lackluster experience to say the least.My girlfriend wanted to eat here for her birthday so I am always willing to make her happy.  The decour is nice. Our waitress was not very good. She was rude and ignored us most of the night. The food was okay. Small portions. Honestly I could have went to Apple Bee's for what they offered. Very limited menu its 2014 every restaurant should have a turkey or veggie burger option. I wanted to try the crème brulé but did not want to spend another second there"}
{"text":"Been here several times. Always great food with decent service. The 2 things that stand out for me   on the negative side is the wait time can be long sometimes and it can get a little noisy.My favourite is the beer cheese soup ."}
{"text":"It's a stretch to call yourself a brewery when you only serve five beers, but when you're out of two of them it's time to cover the \"brewery\" on the sign out front  Three beers Three stars"}
{"text":"The happy hour was amazing and the prices were decent, but it's a chain. You can't expect much. Large plates and okay flavor. Everything needed salt or it either had too much salt. It has a great choice of beer and a wonderful set up for a getting together with friends or even a party but like I said, it's a chain so don't expect \"wow\" food."}
{"text":"Good prices, casual atmosphere, I must say though I had higher expectations for the beer! I tried the \"Hoppy Flight\" of in-house brewed beers and was just left a little high and dry. The beers weren't bad, but each one tasted like it was missing something. I'd still recommend the restaurant though, good experience overall."}
{"text":"Perhaps this is unfair, but I've seen a general downward turn in Granite City.  My husband and I began going there weekly after a dance class.  It was one of the places near us with delicious food that was open after 9:30.  We both joined the Mug Club, and we got great deals on food after 9 pm.  Later they added $2 tap, which couldn't be beat.  But Granite City as a corporation seems to be spreading and standardizing things, which isn't always for the best.  The food is still delicious.  The Shrimp Taco Trio is incredible; Blue Peppercorn Burger is amazing; we always get an order of their pretzels (that's what got us hooked on GC in the first place).  But the great deals we initially experienced have disappeared.    Since we've been going regularly - always on Wednesdays - we've developed a relationship with our server.  She's absolutely wonderful and friendly.  Last week we went to GC with a big group to celebrate my birthday, and our server brought me a dessert -- a cookie with candles :)  So we still go because the food and service are terrific, but I also think that if we were getting acquainted with GC now, it wouldn't be something we'd do regularly."}
{"text":"I was not impressed at all with the food, but our server....omg he was FABULOUS. I would go back just to see him again (Johnathan!!!). He was absolutely funny, knew not only the menu but the drinks as well, and he was so hilarious and personable. Two of my friends ordered the beer samplers, which were a pretty awesome price, and he explained the different types of beers, which ones he liked, and gave us some lemonade so we could make our own shandies.  He was great.  I stuck the the happier hour menu. I ordered the raspberry mojito, which borderline tasted like cough syrup.  For dinner I ordered the Idaho nachoes, which were really lacking on the toppings. I also got one of the flatbreads--maple pepper bacon, something like that? I think it was too much maple for me.  It almost tasted like someone put extra maple syrup on it.   One of my friends ordered the London Broil, which to me looked like meatloaf. It was $18, and I don't even buy that from the store when it's that expensive....not sure what she was thinking, but I would have been disappointed if that would have been me.  It definitely does not have a brewery ambiance.  It just felt like a really nice restaurant. It was a typical Legacy Village restaurant feel."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time on a Sunday night around 8 p.m. We were seated immediately, but were not visited by our waitress for at least 15 or 20 minutes - and the first visit was only for her to tell us she would be right over to get our drinks. When she returned, we placed our entire order, drinks and food, as we had more than enough time to decide.  Our waitress ended up being nice enough - though she did try very hard to push their reward program, though neither of us were interested - but her service was still quite slow. We waited another 10 or 15 minutes after placing our order to get our drinks (we each ordered a craft beer, nothing fancy), and our food arrived almost immediately afterwards. The food itself was very good (I got the Grilled Asian Chicken Salad, he got an asparagus pasta), as were the beers. I'm not sure if it made up for the long wait, though. Portions are just large enough that you could eat the entire meal in one sitting if you were hungry enough, or take half home for lunch the next day.  Atmosphere itself was also pretty nice; I feel like it can be described as a mix between an Applebee's and a Town Hall/Market Garden type of restaurant. Very cool lighting fixtures, and they had a lot of TVs broadcasting sporting events, which we enjoyed. It was pretty loud, and there were a number of groups with children, so it's not the place to go if you're looking for a quiet, intimate setting.  Will I be back? If I'm around Legacy and hungry, I would stop in again, maybe try sitting at the bar to see if the service is any quicker. However, I probably won't seek this place out without first being in the area. The service time was just too slow to have this be at the top of my list."}
{"text":"Granite City is a great option in the Legacy Village plaza.  I heard good things from colleagues about the food and beers here so I decided to give it a whirl on a recent trip to Cleveland.  I liked it so much that I came back again on another trip I was on a few weeks later!  They are a brewery so there are quite a few craft brews on the menu.  There are also cocktails and wine for the non beer drinkers.  They offer a happy hour until 6 pm with discounts on drinks and appetizers.  As for the food, I had the bruschetta chicken on my first visit and the garlic butter sirloin on my second visit.  Both of these entrees were really good and they do have some more casual options, as well.  Over all, I enjoy this spot and will consider this a go to on my future Cleveland trips."}
{"text":"Came for Sunday Brunch on Easter. Food was fresh. Food tasted very good. Everything from salmon to omelets to fruit and dessert. The hubby and I were very pleased. Service was fine, I'm not sure what others have experienced but we will be back for lunch one day and check it out. 4 stars because we didn't get the whole restaurant experience since we came foe a buffet brunch."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I have to agree with a majority of the posts on here. This place has potential to be amazing - the decor is beautiful and the concept is really cool. I've sincerely tried to like this place...I've gone around 4 times, and have been disappointed every time. The service every time has been AWFUL. Do not go here and expect to grab a \"quick bite\" it takes anywhere from 45 minutes to 3 hours. The waiters are nice enough, but will disappear for 10-15 minutes and simply make remarks like \"you need a refill\" and then not refill your drink. You could really get the same type of food and alcohol and an Applebee's or Ruby Tuesdays (and for about half the cost). It's decent enough, but not anything really special. I watched our appetizer of pretzels sit under the heat lamps for 20+ minutes before they were brought out...cold. Not good. Like I said before, great concept, but with all of the other choices in Legacy, I suggest you go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Went there for second time and.experience was just as bad as first time.     server forgot to come back and get our orders after apps, food took forever!     They were not even busy.   A beer flight took longer to get than apps 15 min!    Sides were wrong on one of meals and two of four at our table complained of stomach problems next day!    Manager didnt even bother asking how.things were just said good night on way out.    Last time going food is average at best, atmosphere is nice but bad service and overpriced going to bar loius instead next time."}
{"text":"I visited granite city to celebrate my friends birthday. The food was good, but our experience at the restauant left much to be desired.   First, someone in our party of 8 called the restaurant earlier in the week to make reservations and was told that they do not accept reservations, but have call ahead service.  We called ahead for a table that was supposed to be ready at 6:30pm. When we arrived at 6:30 we were told that we would have a 25 minute wait. After waiting for almost 45 minutes we spoke with a woman at the desk who told us that we didn't have a reservation and would have to wait. We explained that we tried to make reservations earlier in the week but were told that we couldn't. This woman was short and offered little help.   After waiting for 55 minutes we were seated and waited another 20 minutes for our drinks and almost 45 minutes for our food.   I am disappointed that our experience was unpleasant and that the staff were unwilling to help. Next time we will certainly be looking at other restaraunts in the area."}
{"text":"Really underwhelming. The atmosphere is nice but the service was so slow and apathetic. Short wait on a table around 7 on a Saturday so that was a plus. Almost an hour wait for the food however. I got the short ribs, and they were pretty good. Flavorful and tender, but the whole dish was ruined by the fact that it came out room temperature. My friends' dishes were also cold, so I assume they were sitting for a while before they got to us. Our water glasses were also not refilled once. My friend got fish, which was chewy and they totally forgot her side dish. She was halfway through her meal before they finally brought it after she asked. Also, random, but the poor woman in the stall next to me in the bathroom had to ask me to hand her toilet paper. Keep your bathroom stocked guys.   The server was generally disinterested in us and didn't comment or ask about the fact that I barely touched my food.  Our water glasses were also not refilled once. She didn't thank us for coming or even smile when she brought our checks as well. I will not be returning. It's too bad there are so few good dining options in the Legacy Village area."}
{"text":"Been to Granite City several times.  Twice with a larger group and the service took awhile, I suppose that can be expected though.  I love their Idaho Nachos and flat bread pizza.  The primary thing I love about Granite City is the Sunday Brunch! So much food and so many choices! Fresh fruit, awesome scones, amazing hash brown potatoes, unbelievable cinnamon rolls.  The eggs never really impress me but I get to full on everything else that it never matters.  I've had their brunch four or five times now and I have no doubt I'll do it again."}
{"text":"Will never go back. After waiting nearly an hour and 15 minutes for two simple appetizers, I've spent the rest of my afternoon praying to the porcelain gods. If the slow service wasn't enough, the sickness is insult to injury.."}
{"text":"Went there for the 1st time on a Friday. Had to wait for 15 mins to be seated. We were a group of 4 & hung out by the bar. The bar is pretty cool with a humongous TV screen. Had their brew (lager), nothing too impressive. It's a very big restaurant, with a 'chain' like feel. Our server was just not interested.   I don't think I will go again for dining but could stop by for a drink at the bar with the 'BIG' screen TV."}
{"text":"Visited this location for the first time a few days ago.  I was looking forward to an exceptional dining experience.  While the table service was outstanding ( waiter Eric), the food was barely mediocre.  My Mediterranean chicken tasted more like a reheated Stouffers dinner.  It was bland and the presentation was as basic as it could be.  My friends flatbread pizza was much the same.  Sadly, two individuals had given me similar reviews prior to going there.  However, I sure enjoyed the beer!  Probably won't be going back, though."}
{"text":"Server was fantastic! Food was 6 out of 10 stars!  Great place to go if your shopping or whatever. Large portions, timely service. However, food was not very hot, appetizer was supposed to be warm pretzels with cheese, the pretzels were cold, the cheese was weird, it was more like beer soup. Ribs were great, fries great too. Had to wait forever for a dinner side salad that came with dinner, took it back because typically that is brought before dinner and after appetizer. I will give it another try one day..."}
{"text":"Just had the Maple Pepper Bacon & Tomato flatbread-----awesome good.  More than enough for two. Service st the bar has been great."}
{"text":"I like their home brew beer. I recommended the member card. just $10. I will go there again for sure."}
{"text":"First time here. Enjoyed the cheese soup and BBQ chicken flatbread. Good sized portions. There were 7 of us and everyone enjoyed their food. Fast service on a Friday night. My second and third visits weren't nearly as good. Food quality has gone down. I was there yesterday with three others. Although the place was quiet, we were there for an hour and twenty minutes for lunch. Service was SLOW. Not going there again."}
{"text":"The food is overpriced for what you're getting- bar food spiced up with fancy crockery. The service was awful! Our waiter was very friendly, but incredibly neglectful. I'd love to attribute it to the birthday party next to us, except we saw plenty of staff who seemed oblivious to our pleas for attention, including the manager. When we did get their attention, they were rude, and made it clear how much we were inconveniencing them. Just don't go."}
{"text":"Granite city used to be a great restaurant for family outings until they changed their menu a couple of years ago. The portion sizes are greatly reduced and some of the menu favorites are not the same. For example, the bruschetta salad used to have some delicious marinated tomatoes in balsamic. To my surprise last time I ordered this salad, the tomatoes were just cut, not marinated and they served it over a bed of romaine lettuce out of a bag. The service has also been better. The server was inattentive and the food took forever, over 50min. We also ordered the chicken noodle soup and it was so salty that it was uneatable. I don't think we will come back again. It's a shame."}
{"text":"I've been to a few Granite City Breweries before, and this one follows the mold pretty well. To start, it's beautiful inside. The giant kettles that line the main dining area give a great ambiance, and the rest of the restaurant is cozy and inviting. On ambiance alone, this is one of the best restaurants in Legacy Village.  The happy hour menu is an excellent way to pair your beer with some inexpensive and tasty food. I'd especially recommend the Irish nachos. Beer is good and drinkable, and they keep the ABV nice and low to allow for trying multiple options. The problem is, for people with a bit more refined craft beer palette (which a lot of Clevelanders have), it falls short. They have been working in a few more seasonal options to help keep things fresh, which will likely keep me stopping back in for a couple happy hour drinks every once in a while.  On the whole, the food is ok. Entrees get a bit pricy for the quality, but there are so many options, maybe I just haven't found the right one. This is a pretty good place to take a few generations of family members, as it doesn't play to a specific crowd. A nice addition to the Legacy Village area."}
{"text":"Very good place to eat! I've never had a bad meal at this restaurant or a rude server, I would recommend the Margherita pepperoni flatbread. If you ask, the wait staff will turn on the Packer game for you! Friendly service and fresh food, the only downside is the wait time to get a table, depending on how busy they are."}
{"text":"Went there with my family to celebrate 2 birthdays,  our server seemed annoyed that my 7yr son was with us at 5:30 on a Tuesday night. Server was both slow and rude, took 10 min for my beer to get to me, 27 min for our food to come out, mine with the incorrect side dish. By the time our server came to check on everything we were all done eating. When told about my side dish being wrong she said \"it happen sometime\". Don't waste your  money and patients with this place, to many other options in the area."}
{"text":"Once we sat down it took 30 min to get 4 drinks.  Took 3 times to get my simple drink order right, 30 min later finally got our appetizer. 35 minutes finally got our lunch. Food was decent, burger was still bloody...  waitress was horrible. Manager comped our bill a little which helped but we will never go back unless we get the food to go. 2.5 hrs for a lunch we expected to take 45 min - 1hr.  Wasted a beautiful day which we could of spent walking around shopping."}
{"text":"The food (I had the fish and chips) and beer were delicious.  The service was fine.  The atmosphere in the bar was meh"}
{"text":"We swung into Granite City to grab a local brew, get some food and watch some football.  The oatmeal stout we ordered was delicious and was served with a great head. We were seated at a table with a great view of the big screen. Seemed as though we were off to a great start.  We placed our order trying a variety of dishes. Burger, chicken and a salad. The food arrived in a timely manner but was not very appealing. Taste was ok but nothing more than typical bar food.  Overall, a good place for a local brew and watching some tv. After that, quality falls off quick."}
{"text":"Granite City is another addition to the chain restaurant take over of Beachwood. Therefore, expect that. It's basically The Cheesecake Factory with a brewery. Had the Margarita Flatbread which was kind of soggy, the grilled cheese, and a big cookie. I had heard good things about the grilled cheese but I really didn't like it. I brought my boyfriend the \"Chef's Selection\" sandwich and he said it was okay. Plus, they were out of the beer I wanted to try. Oh well, overall a very \"meh\" experience."}
{"text":"If I were rating on brunch alone it would definitely be 5 stars, it's amazing.  Thursday's soup (chicken tortilla) is cant miss.  Its my favorite soup EVER!  The regular menu stuff, just ok.  Service is always good."}
{"text":"Stopped to have a quick lunch while shopping, and it was a horrible experience.  The service was extremely slow and the food was cold.  The server was upset we didn't take the brunch buffet option because it meant she actually had to work"}
{"text":"Second time I've been to this location and it was an awful experience. I was less than impressed the first time for breakfast and now lunch I was hoping it would be better. First off my friend and I sat at the table for 10 minutes without having a waiter stop by with at least water and it wasn't busy since it was 1:30pm after typical lunch time. The waiter had a poor attitude the whole time. My friends food was just fine but my Mac and cheese arrived cold. No steam for the pasta and the chicken was as cold as it came out of the fridge. The table next to us had the same problem with the pasta. The manager eventually came by and said it would be remade and taken off our bill. The dish was okay, nothing special so I was disappointed. When it was time for the bill the waiter said we would get a free dessert instead which we didn't want but picked the mini brownie and creme brûlée. The brownie was cold and the creme brûlée was too runny. Little disappointed they didn't hold up to crediting the meal because we didn't even want dessert. Won't return again."}
{"text":"I've been to Granite City about 9 times since they opened. Always had great service and the food is fantastic. Their ribs are amazing! Not really a beer drinker so I've never tried any of that but the cocktails Ade great that's for sure! Gets sort of busy on Thurs-Sun but in this area everything does, so a 45-60 minute wait is expected, shame they don't do reservations. Haven't tried their brunch yet, but several friends have told me its really good. Overall, great restaurant and definitely some place I will go again and recommend you do too!!"}
{"text":"Maple Bacon Tomato Flatbread Pizza.  Need I say more?"}
{"text":"Went here twice now. Both times were disappointing. Service is friendly but very slow. The beer is average, and the food is hit or miss, with the good food not even being that great. Most recently it took 10 min of waiting plus going back to the host stand to get a waiter to the table, (at this point i started timing) 8 min to get the drinks, and another 21 min after the drinks to get the food. The place looks great but is super loud too. If im in legacy ill find somewhere else to go."}
{"text":"My husband and I went in without reading too much about the place first, the online menu looked pretty good and I am always on the lookout for new micro-brews so we decided it was worth a try.  I was a bit surprised at how empty it was on a Saturday night but I decided it was early still and that should not deter me.  It felt very corporate inside and really felt like a chain.  Our server seemed busier than he should have been for how empty it was but he was pretty good, our waters were always full.  We ordered the beer sampler and found them all very bland.  There was very little flavor difference between the IPA and the wheat beer.  I love hoppy IPAs so I was disappointed in the lack of flavor.  My husband ordered Korean tacos and he was pretty happy with them.  They did not have any vegetarian choices I could eat so I went with the grilled salmon.  When the plate was put in front of me I caught a distinct fishy smell.  I tried one bite and it was horrible, the fish had been sitting around for much too long.  The waiter and manager both apologized but you cannot apologize enough to someone who has that fishy taste stuck in their mouth.  I did not find anything there worth going back for."}
{"text":"First off, ORDER THE IDAHO NACHOS! They're breathtaking! Overall this place has a really good atmosphere. The beer they brew up is nothing i'd write home about, but still not too bad. Food has always been fantastic and service on the occasions i've been was just ok, giving 4 stars for as my group had our drinks messed up a couple times. I'd recommend this place and will definitely be going here again. Cheers!"}
{"text":"We visited on a weekend night with friends and kids. The ambiance is nice and the place was pretty kids friendly. It probably would have been different on a weekend.   The prices are very affordable. I had the beer sampler, we got an appetizer, and we were still on at $54 for the bill.   Despite the nice atmosphere, good prices, and friendly staff, the food and beer were both underwhelming. Sadly, out of the 8 beers that cMs on the sampler, not one of them was good enough for me to order a full size. All of the beer lacked body and mouth feel. The flavor profiles were mediocre, and not up to stuff especially considering the competitive micro brew market.   I had the fish tacos . They were poorly seasoned and did not with a side. Weird. My wife had the Reuben which claimed thinly sliced corned beef, but why came out was more like slabs of roast beef.  The staff was fine, not exceptional.   Probably will not return."}
{"text":"Very good beer.  This is a chain brewpub but has high quality food and beer.  On par with the location in Sioux Falls, SD that I visited a couple of years ago."}
{"text":"Sunday brunch: restaurant was very busy, but we got a pager and were seated within 15 minutes.  Brunch is a buffet and included the following things : melon & grapes, scones, two green salads,pasta dish,cheesy potatoes, eggs, bacon, sausage, french toast, biscuits and gravy, prime rib, omelette station. Also they give a caramel bun (one per person) on your table--they are huge!  They are basically cinnamon buns with a caramel sauce.  If you are interested in alcohol with your brunch, they do have some decent deals on bloody marys and mimosas--all you can drink mimosas for $10, and bloody marys are available with all the fixings and made to order.  As for the brunch food, as many other reviewers said, it is extremely high calorie--not saying that's a bad thing, but the eggs definitely were full of butter and cream, thick cut bacon, huge caramel buns, etc.  runch buffet definitely did not have healthy options aside from fruit.  Caramel buns were good, scones were definitely from frozen or par baked dough (well, I'd say the same for the buns but they tasted better).  One really bizarre thing at Granite City is their service standards.  It's actually too much.  They always have 2 people just to open the door for you, and if you go to the bar, the bartender introduces themself and shakes your hand.  I know they are required to do so per management, but I actually find it a turnoff.  Granite City is more expensive than Dane or other places in Madison.  I used a Bucky Book coupon; without a coupon, I'd be less inclined to go.  On the other hand, there are not many restaurants like this in the West Towne area."}
{"text":"Had the sirloin steak and was not impressed. Wings for appetizers were nothing special--something I could've bought and made from a box.   BFs steak was good but it was smothered in sauce...so not sure if it was the sauce or the actual meat. Mine was super dry and I didn't finish it :(   I did get a 10% discount through my employer so that was nice!"}
{"text":"So this is a chain and even though it is a chain, I felt like we needed to try it since the sign stares me in the face whenever we are in town.  On a Saturday at 1, we waiting about 15 minutes for a table.  It was a little weird - it didn't look that busy and tables were empty but they seemed to be staggering seatings.  Not sure if they didn't have enough people or what but we got seated within the time they said we would be so that was fine with me.  Our server got to our table quickly and my only real issue was that there is kind of a hard sell on their beer club.  Kind of meh about those sorts of things to begin with and we're from *out of town* so no, not going to be purchasing.  That said, they were out of their wheat beer but the stout the husband got was pretty good and only $3.  Our food was pretty standard - moderate portions and fairly appropriate for the price.  The French onion soup was good - quite good, actually - and would have been just right if the cheese on top of the bowl had been a tiny bit browned rather than just melted.  I tried the Monterey chicken wrap and it was middle of the road while DH had the Overlake, which he liked well enough, and some garlic mashed potatoes that were decent.  Not sure we'd revisit but for a chain, it wasn't the worst food I have ever had, just not quite elevated as many brewpubs are doing in a lot of other places.  There is potential so hopefully there is continued improvement."}
{"text":"This place is located in Legacy Village and I have been to this location couple of times. The atmosphere is more upscale with a lot of tables and open bar space. The hostess will get you seated immediately if there is no wait. The service is usually good but a lot of the people that are working there do not know much about the beers. The short list of beers they have are good but not great! I have had their happy hour pork nachos and french fries with dipping sauce. The happy hour pork nachos are very small I would say enough for one not really to share! The nachos were okay. There wasn't anything special about it! I also ordered the french fries with dipping sauce. I expected the fries to be warm and the dipping sauce to have more flavors. The fries came out almost cold and the dipping sauce was very unflavorful. For dinner I ordered the Margherita Flatbread and their hot buffalo wings. I was really disappointed in their flatbread! It was soggy with whole pieces of tomatoes and hard cheese! I have never had anything like this. It was not good at all! And the hot buffalo wings were not good at all!  This place lacks the flavor and taste in food. The service was okay and the beers are okay. There are a lot more breweries and food places in cleveland that are better!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time tonight and was disappointed. Service took awhile, although the waiter was friendly. I ordered a cup of the French onion soup and was surprised by how small the portion was when it came out considering it was about 4 dollars. It was just about the size of a tea cup. And the bread took up most of the room to in it. It did taste good, although nothing special. For my meal, I ordered the BTA (bacon tomato avocado) and it was extremely bland. There was barely any cheese and barely any bacon. I've had plenty of BLTs in the past and they had a lot more flavor. I was excited to try this spin on a classic and was very disappointed. And the fries that came with it were very starchy."}
{"text":"My husband and I had some time to kill while waiting for his glasses to be prepared at Lenscrafters.   An associate there recommended Granite City so we thought we would check it out.  The food was delicious and the staff friendly.  Unfortunately there must have been a mixup in the kitchen as we waited well over half an hour to get our food.  My steak and baked potato were piping hot but my husband's ribs and mashed potatoes were stone cold.  Our waitress was very apologetic and immediately remedied the situation.  The manager also stopped by and made things right for us.  We will definitely give them another chance.  We left with the feeling of being very well cared for."}
{"text":"Would def recommend this place to friends. My wife and I planned to go to Maggiano's but they were closed due to inclement weather. We drove around legacy village thinking of another place to go and saw this where the old bookstore used to be.   We got the beer sampler and it was great. Our server explained all the beers thoroughly, more than I would ever expect. We got the buffalo shrimp flatbread and boneless wings for appetizers. They came out quick and the flatbread was amazing. For dinner we got shrimp tacos and the cheddar bacon burger. Let me just say, I've been looking for the perfect bacon cheddar burger for 27 years and I think I found it!  Glad we found this place!"}
{"text":"Made an 11:00 reservation didn't get seated until 11:30. The food was super average the only thing I enjoyed was the sausage gravy. Eggs bland and out of a carton. The bacon was burnt, the cinnamon rolls were hard and most of the buffet chafers were empty and covered in sticky food. I thought I liked the waffles but they had some kind of spiciness to them and it turned me off. It's not worth the $20 they charged. Didn't meet my expectations at all!"}
{"text":"Sat at the bar on a Saturday afternoon and had great service. The food, the short ribs and Mahi tacos, was delicious! My husband enjoyed the beer. He tried the Admiral and I tried the American Mule cocktail. Both were great. We plan to be back soon."}
{"text":"When ever I go home I like to take my (not so) little brother to a new restaurant so that we can have some brother/sister bonding time. This time we chose Granite City and brought one of our other sisters along. Walking in I didnt have high expectations of the place. The decor was nice but the service from the start was pretty bad. We stood at the hostess stand for a solid 5 minutes as people walked by, looked at us and kept walking. One person I could understand as it looked like he was grabbing stuff for a table, others were simply avoiding helping us or at least letting us know when someone would be able to help us. We were seated toward the back of the restaurant so I got to see a bit of the decor and loved that you could see how they brew through the glass windows.   On to the dinner portion of the night.. I decided to try their Shandy and while i normally love a shandy theirs was far too sweet! I couldnt even finish it.. We stuck pretty basic with the food (pasta, burger and sandwich) and they were all pretty good. Things were cooked just to our liking and so I have no complaints there. Our waitress was a little more attentive than the folks at the hostess stand so that helped the experience a little. Over all i really give them a meh, but since the food wasnt bad I went up a star.."}
{"text":"The first time I went to Granite City is not memorable at all. It was about a year ago and all I remember is a salad, so when I went this time I made sure to take it all in.   The environment of Granite City is super fun, especially for a mall restaurant. It is a perfect place for a big party of people or a family. We didn't have a beer, but being a brewery they seemed to have some cool brews.  We had the BBQ flatbread and it was perfectly crispy and light. Perfect for sharing.  We also had the April special which was a BBQ pork waffle, which was one of the best dishes I have had in a while. I was apprehensive to try the weird combo, but the sweetness of the pork combined with the crispy onion straws and soft waffle was an amazing combination and I wish this was a dish I could order every time I go."}
{"text":"Awful. Good beer, but plan on eating elsewhere.   If I could give it 0 stars I would.  We came here for my birthday on a Sunday night, normal party of 5.  This place was not my choice for food, but I didn't want to be difficult and I did want to see the inside, which I heard was pretty cool.  First:  I checked in with the hostess for our reservation under my brother's name.  They had it spelled incorrectly and rather than just seat us, they made a point of telling me that \"That isn't how we have it spelled.\"  Ummmm - not my fault you spelled it wrong and why would I crash my birthday dinner for a table that was already half-seated?  Bad start.  Second:  Waitress was pretty young, which is fine, but when some members of our party ordered \"light beer\" or \"dark beer,\" hoping for a suggestion, she was clueless and a bit rude.  Not everyone knows your craft beers - have your staff ready to provide suggestions, tastings or at least be old enough to drink!  Third:  3 members of the party ordered the overpriced steaks all at medium rare.  The waitress suggested that we order them at rare since the kitchen overcooks then  OK.  When the steaks came out, we had one well, one still attached to the cow and one cooked ok.  And then you were out of asparagus.  45 minutes after we ordered.  But charged us for it anyways.  At least my ribs were passable, but not for the price.  Perhaps your young waitress thought my father's accent made him an indiscriminate diner.  She was VERY wrong.  And very wrong about the rest of the party."}
{"text":"I have gone to Granite city 4 times, each time getting the same results, no matter how much I wish it was different.            The opportunity for them to succeed is there, both with the demographic and the theme, but the service is deplorable. Absolutely zero passion from the servers, they act as if I am an inconvenience to them because if I am paying I demand what I am paying for.          As for the food, it is fantastic on paper, however they fail to get the basics, hot food hot/cold food cold. If I order mashed potatoes with gravy I don't want it to be warm, I expect it to be so hot I have to wait a second or two for it to cool off to eat. Bagged salads? With the prices as high as they are I demand something more than a stemmy, brown, wilted salad.          I really, really wanted this place to succeed but being in the service industry myself I am not going to return. Every place has problems, whether with vendors or staff members, but those problems usually get fixed. The same problems persisted over the course of 4 months. The same problems persisted with 4 different servers and 4 different appetizers and 4 different entrees and 12 different cocktails.         The good reviews I read on yelp ring untrue as being either hired to give good reviews or as actual staff. I know what I experienced and what everyone I have spoken to has experienced. Occasionally even a blind squirrel will find a nut, but not at granite city.        I will recommend anyone considering granite city to just go to TGIFridays or Melt"}
{"text":"Second time here  I absolutely hated my first time here. It was when the brewery first opened, and literally everything that could go wrong went wrong.   However, I was pleasantly surprised this time. The bartender was very nice and knowledgeable. Remember, this is a brewery so you should be able to answer all my questions about the beer you guys make, and this bar tender did just that. My meal was French onion soup with crispy shrimp tacos. Both were excellent. The shrimp is spicy and crunchy and the soup was cheesy and full of flavor. I ordered this with a pear beer and everything was great.   Will return again."}
{"text":"Was here tonight and although we like some of the food/beer at this place, truly was disappointed with the service.  Our waitress pointed out our drinks were empty 2 times before refilling them, and by the time our refills came 15 min after the second time she noticed, we were done with our food.  I understand things can get busy, but these are the little things that make a dining experience a bad one."}
{"text":"Love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, their chocolate cake with rum butter sauce. Amazzzzzzzzing!!  Thats all."}
{"text":"I tend to agree with most of the comments I've ready here.  The food is just ok, but overpriced, the staff is friendly but not very experienced or efficient and for some odd reason they are out of EVERYTHING  lol  The ambiance is very nice, with a \"cool pub vibe\".  We ordered a beer we've had at another chain location, which was apparently seasonal...ok no problem.  They were also out of my choice of steak so I had to order a different cut ($15 more a serving), they were out of green beans so the only other option I liked was a FRUIT BOWL(?)...I asked for a salad but was advised this is a \"stand alone item\" and I can't substitute my OUT OF STOCK green beans for a salad.   I asked our waiter, Eric (who was friendly enough) to get me some butter, then listened as he talked to the table behind us about family and friends for 5-10 minutes while my food got cold.  I decided I wasn't having a great experience and wanted to voice my concerns.  The manager was apologetic and offered me a salad immediately but unfortunately, that's it.  No concession for a comp drink or dessert, just an apology and offering me the salad the waiter should have given me before I finished eating.   I've heard other locations of this chain are much better but I certainly won't be going back to the one in Legacy Village."}
{"text":"Had the salmon. Cooked to perfection. Happy hour 3 to 6 a steal. A scoop of ice cream was 99 cents. A great chain from !Minnesota.  PS service was excellent."}
{"text":"Yelp really needs a button for 0 stars. This place deserves it. I called ahead for a larger party and still waited over an hour to be seated. I won't even get started on how long we waited after that to get our drinks. Service was horrible and food was terrible. Every time I go here I seem to experience the same issues."}
{"text":"Let's start with the positives, because there are many!  From the salads to the pasta, the food here is gratifying.  I have yet to have a dish that I have not enjoyed.  Like many restaurants in Madison they brew their own beer, but here the prices seem much more affordable.  The only downside to this eatery is that it is attached to a mall.  If that is something that bothers you, then it may not be the place to eat on a first date.  But if you're looking for a place to have lunch or a quiet night for dinner, then check this place out."}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner here last night, and we couldn't believe how good the service was.  Our waitress was amazing.  She anticipated our needs and checked on us just the right amount.  Our water glasses were never empty, she brought out ketchup for my fries before our meal was delivered, got us extra napkins when our meals proved to be a little messy, and she was very friendly and polite.  The manager even checked in on us and asked how everything was.  To be perfectly honest, I expected an average meal from this place, but I was pleasantly surprised when my expectations were exceeded.  The food was very nicely plated.  (I'm kind of a foodie, so I pay attention to these things.)  My husband enjoyed the reuben sandwich and mashed potatoes, and I had the buffalo chicken wrap with waffle fries.   I would definitely try this place again.  I think my husband's favorite part was that he was able to strategically place himself in perfect view of the TV without me noticing that he was watching sports throughout our dinner :)"}
{"text":"Great brunch food, including the crispy bacon and delicious fresh made omelette.   However, a complaint I have is concerning the omelette station. Me and my friend ordered French toast before getting in the long line for an omelette. It took 30 minutes for us to finally get one due to individual customers being allowed to order 2 omelettes. This slowed the process and we, and the many behind us, almost missed the chance to get an omelette, since that station stops at a certain time. I highly HIGHLY suggest they allow one omelette per customer at a time for fairness to everyone.  Elsewhere, it's a good place to find for brunch."}
{"text":"Well, the first time I was here, service was impeccable. The happy hour was one of the best around. My second time here is a much different experience. The happy hour menu shrunk and the prices skyrocketed. Beers are now 3.50 plus tax. To top things off, service was nonexistent. Our server, Nathan, barely even acknowledged us. And the bar was empty! I don't know. Not staying. Headed down the road to the pub."}
{"text":"I would not recommend this place, very disappointed in our dinner tonight. I ordered a featured cocktail but couldn't taste the alcohol at all. Then we got the spinach and artichoke dip, which tested like straight cream cheese. My sister got the Asian salad for dinner, the consistency was all wrong and it lacked flavor. I got the salmon oscar, which spelled fishy and had this most disgusting fake cheese sauce on top. Plus the broccoli they served on the side was practically raw. Everything tasted artificial, processed and pre-frozen. If you're looking for a decent option in the area, you're better off at any of the surrounding restaurants for ambiance, drinks or dinner."}
{"text":"I had to go get my growler filled, it was long over due. Their 'Two Pull\" has been one of my favorite beers for a long time. Slightly biased and sentimental, but I do love it. Beer was great. Food was ok, I've had it better at other GCB's. That will come with time. However, I was really let down with our service. it was just really slow, and unorganized..we got beers before waters, and thats even with asking for waters twice.  I understand this place just opened. So I don't expect perfection. Even though knew it could have been a little better. But i can't wait to go back, as i know i will for a better experience and of course their delicious beer."}
{"text":"Not Impressed!! Went with friends for an after Thanksgiving night of drinks and you would have thought they just opened. We sat near the bar and several glasses broke. One over the ice which they kept on using.....  Great, ice in my water glass. Justin, our server was awesome! Handled every request and was cool to have around. Food was mediocre, not really different. Never seen a Manager even after the 2nd glass broke. Decent bar atmosphere."}
{"text":"Do not go here for cocktails!!! They are made poorly and are weak!! They taste good but aren't strong at all. However, The flatbreads are delicious! We got the margarita pizza and the bacon flatbread and both were amazing. Over all I'd only go again if somebody insisted."}
{"text":"The newest addition to the Cleveland food scene is a real winner! We went for the VIP grand opening last night and were very impressed. From the excellent beers to the fantastic food, all presented by a warm, friendly and well trained staff. This place should be a big hit. Try the ribs or the flatbread pizzas, both are delicious! Best of luck to the Granite City Brewery, and welcome to Cleveland, thanks for coming!"}
{"text":"Our first visit.  Wonderful service.  Very good food at a reasonable price.  We will return.  I recommend asking for Jenny; I expect that she will serve you as well as she did us."}
{"text":"Went to check out this place last night with two of my friends for dinner! We went around 7:30 and the placed was PACKED! The Restaurant itself is HUGE. You walk in and there's a huge bar area to your left with (on an empty night) a lot of standing space and a bunch of tables and booths (still have to wait for those tables, not first come first serve like some places). And from there, you can see across the restaurant to other areas where people may be seated for dinner. It's super adorable- high ceilings, very open, lots of stone.  We were given a wait time of 2 hours, so we went to the bar hoping to grab drinks. Despite it being super packed, every bartender seemed super attentive, friendly, and easy to grab. We ordered our drinks (white sangria, red sangria, and skinny mojito) and waited. The girls sitting at the bar in front of us kept ordering apps, making us more and more hungry, so we put in an order for flatbread. We lucked out because a girl from a party of 4 came up to us and said her pager was buzzing, but they weren't going to use it anymore so we were able to sit within 30 mins of being there :)   Food - the Margherita flatbread was AMAZING. You can totally make it a meal for 1 person with some leftover if you want, in my opinion. But we made shared it between 3 of us as an app. For dinner, I got the buffalo chicken wrap with waffle fries. The fries were alright, they were clearly sitting out for a while. The buffalo chicken wrap was good! My friends got the Mussels (with vodka sauce) and the shrimp tacos and they both LOVED their meals.  Drinks - White sangria and red sangrias literally tasted like JUICE, they were so delish. I got the skinny mojito, since I wanted a drink but am trying to be healthy, along with the rest of the world. It was really good. I def didn't feel like I was drinking a \"diet\" drink. Since we were in a brewery and I LOVE beer but didn't want all the carbs, I got a sample of the northers - an american lager. It must have been about 4-5 oz and cost me 75 cents... CENTS. Def a good way to try a beer :)   Service - ok this is where I take away a star. Service was horrendous when we got to the table. But, I'm only taking away one star b/c it was clearly crazy busy. Our waitress was really nice, but just seemed so frazzled the entire time - so I kind of also felt bad for her. She gave us a heads up about the bar taking forever (as some of the reviews below mentioned), which we appreciated, so she made sure she put our drinks in ahead of time. She was MIA for about 10-15 mins between taking drink orders and coming to take our orders (and that's only b/c we asked someone to find her). We were semi-ok w/ the pace as it was super busy, but didn't really appreciate how she would trash talk her co-workers and blame delays on them every time she came back.  Overall, I'll def be back. I want to check out their HH, more of their delish food, different beers, and their BRUNCH -they have BRUNCH!!"}
{"text":"Just got home from Granite City, our first time there.  We had the Oriental Shrimp for our appetizer.  It was AWESOME!  My husband ordered the Walleye, and I had the Honey Rosemary Tenderloin Salad for entree's.  His Walleye was pretty good, said there was too much breading.  My salad, on the other hand, was outstanding.  Tons of tenderloin, perfectly cooked.  I made the comment to my husband, \"Usually a salad is 99% lettuce, and 1% good stuff.  This salad is 99% good stuff, and 1% lettuce.\"  Nice big chunks of Blue Cheese.   We will not hesitate to go back.  Maybe, next time, we'll have room for dessert!"}
