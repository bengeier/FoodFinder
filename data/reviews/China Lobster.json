{"text":"Not a huge selection for a buffet. The food was dry and cold; odd considering we went for lunch at 12:30pm. Crab rangoons tasted rancid, chicken in cashew chicken was chewy, and sweet and sour sauce was bland and watery. I'd recommend the buffet in the plaza across the street. The other restaurant (Top China Buffet) has lower prices with better quality food and more buffet choices."}
{"text":"Very very good chinese buffet. The place is really clean and the quality of food is really good as well.  Just a bit of a drive for me"}
{"text":"Worst dining experience in a long time.  We have gotten sick off the buffet in the past, kept going back thinking it was a fluke.  Today we ordered off the menu.  Our waiter was unfamiliar with the menu items, placed my order incorrectly and when sent back, he served the same meal on a different plate.   Probably the last time we will ever go to China Lobster.  For a far better experience, Shanghai Tokyo in Sarver far surpasses this restaurant and the prices are around the same if not better."}
{"text":"My all time favorite Chinese place.  Yes they are a little more expensive but the food is well worth it! The other buffets in the area are disgusting. You get a great atmosphere and wonderful service.  It's really worth the price. Plus they deliver which is fantastic! It's always served hot and fresh!"}
{"text":"The food & service is so good! We have gone here for years & just love it. For the quality of the buffet, the price is very reasonable. You can sit in a booth or place tabels together for larger groups. I would love to have their sauce recipes. They have been in the area for over 16 years."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised, this is a nice little restaurant. Decent buffet, sushi bar, full menu. I'll be coming here again!"}
{"text":"We really enjoy this place. The buffet is very large and good but the sushi is excellent. Sit at the sushi bar in the back and the sushi chef prepares everything right there. It is always fresh and wonderful and the chef always slips in a few surpises. The spicy tuna roll and the Steeler roll are our favorites. Also, check out the bar. Great cocktail specials and Greg, the bartenter is the best! Fun place to visit. The new location is so nice."}
{"text":"Ate from the buffet last night, woke up this morning with food poisoning so bad I had to call off work. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Good food. Clean. Excellent service. Priced right. Food was fresh and a nice variety."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is lovely! Sadly the price you pay for the buffet, it really brings the rating down a lot! The food is at best mediocre. Small buffet selection. Hardly any desserts. The sushi bar, is over priced and not all that great. The service is okay, but good luck seeing your waiter more than twice during the meal. If you are coming for a pretty place to have a drink or meet with friends you found it! But if you're coming for the food, eh keep looking...."}
{"text":"Yuck. Food is nasty. Very bad experience. Do not eat here. Food is bad tasting. I would give it zero stars if that were an option.   Did I say yuck and nasty?"}
{"text":"Meh.  Recent lunch buffet here.  The staff is friendly, but I really don't see what is so great about their food.  There isn't much variety, and no hibachi.  Not really worth $9 for lunch."}
{"text":"I got the buffet and it was really good. Tons of food to choose from and very tasty. The service is super friendly as well. Five stars for my favorite Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"I would not eat here the food is subpar. The prices are kind of high. There is there is a big selection of food but the food some of the food was cold. I did mention it to a manager and they said they would look into the situation it is $15 for Buffet on weekend night I would go to the other one in Lower Burrell"}
{"text":"Lunch prices were very affordable. the quality of the food was excellent when compared to other buffet style restaurants in and around the area."}
{"text":"Let's start with starters. The spring rolls are great! Delicate crust. Fresh vegetables. And your choice of meats. Fried to perfection. I could make a meal out of these alone. There is a large assortment of other appetizers to please everyone.       The chef's specials, are wonderful. The menu is large and full of many varieties of Chinese cooking. Everyone should be able to find something that pleases them.        They also offer a few desserts. The fried cheesecake is delicious.      The staff here is friendly and courteous. Prices for average. All in all, if you're looking for Chinese food, you can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Charged my wife's debit card twice. When I asked to talk to the manager I got a horrible attitude, & dirty look from the cashier. Manager came out and acted so rude for no reason.  I simply explained that they charged my wife's card twice, & he said we didn't f**king charge her card. I said screw this and left. Got my money back from my bank. Total scammers."}
{"text":"It is good, but not amazing especially for the price. The location is wonderful and close to my home. The sushi is pretty good. I have had better, but I have also had a lot worse. I had a French Kiss my last visit and it was very good and pretty strong."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since they were connected to the Cedars and have always left satisfied.  China lobster is quality over quantity.  Great choices,  friendly service,  clean, just a solid Chinese restaurant experience whether you're buying the buffet or ordering.  Delivery is always quick enough and hot which is another great perk.  It's the best Chinese buffet in Lower Burrell easily.    Edit: I always see people complaining about  the price,  but stop for one second and realize that there aren't many places that offer unlimited shrimp,  and large shrimp at that,  all combined in the price on a daily basis. They just added fried fantail shrimp and it is incredible.  Add in the salt and pepper shrimp which is again,  incredible, the chili shrimp etc.... And you have one awesome buffet for a really good price considering what you get."}
{"text":"Twice my family took me here for late lunch.I have to say it was affordable and enjoyable  all at the same time. I usually disregard and avoid Chinese buffet restaurants, but this place is an exception and exceptional in what they do.The buffet gives you good hot food  and all you can eat.Classic soups, Kim Chee, salads, appetizer bar , nice variety of entrees as well as desserts and real scoop your own ice creams.  Voila: you have a winner!"}
{"text":"Affordable with many items on the buffet! Our server was attentive and the food was tasty."}
{"text":"Don't go here- they are scammers. The food is sub par, so that's part of the reason. Also, when I was here with my friend the other night, we asked for a split check. Each of our orders was $14.31 and when we BOTH checked our bank account afterwards, we were charged $14.31 TWICE. I can understand a mistake and it being on one card, but on both of our cards is ridiculous. Tried to call them and complain, but they just said that on the weekends, they charge double. No? I've eaten there on weekends several times and this is the first time it's happened. They won't listen to reason when we tried to explain the situation, just kept talking over us and telling us that WE were in the wrong. Never coming here again."}
{"text":"The buffet is good but you pay a little more than other buffets in the area. You are paying for the atmosphere which I don't mind. It is nicely decorated, has nice lighting and is a good place to relax. They also serve alcohol and have a bar. If you don't need all that you can visit Top China Buffet across the street in the Hillcrest Shopping Center. The buffet is about $4 less per person and the food is just as good."}
{"text":"Don't eat here.!!! I would give this place negative stars if that was possible.  Chinese food is my favorite but I tried almost everything at the buffet and nothing was edible-or fresh. Very nasty and gross and I felt sick after I ate here. My girlfriend and I eat Chinese food all the time and both felt that this was the worst place we have ever been. This place is disgusting!!!!"}
{"text":"Location now at 3215 Leechburg Rd.    My lunchtime experience was great.  it's a nice venue and you couldn't ask for a better buffet.  It's quite extensive including one buffet of Chinese food selections, another with fried everything, another for salads, and an ice cream station.  I found enough to keep me happy (more than enough, really)."}
{"text":"We go here frequently for the fresh sushi. Ryan is a personable and talented sushi chef and creates unique custom delights! Dave is always friendly and funny. An amazing place for the buffet also. Huge selection, reasonable prices and fantastic staff."}
{"text":"Always a delicious pick! The buffet is great and has so many options. I love that you can get a to go container for the buffet and pay by the weight. The coconut shrimp and steamed dumplings are my favorites. Highly recommend!!"}
