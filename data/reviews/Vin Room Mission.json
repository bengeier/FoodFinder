{"text":"Summary: a good wine list, some tasty food, but the atmosphere feels a bit forced sometimes (& only a small part is actually accessible for wheelchairs)  The first time we visited the Vin Room, we had a gift certificate from my SIL, & were not sure what to expect. We were a bit disappointed.  Although we had reservations, the table was not available when we arrived, & they expected us to stand 10 minutes while waiting. Only after my partner pointed out my cane did they offer us bar stools in the front window. That should have been automatic when you see a cane  If I were rating the Vin Room on that visit alone, it would only be a 3, given that we never felt comfortable during the entire evening. Fortunately subsequent visits have been better, although not spectacular.   The menu varies, including daily appetizer specials. On the last visit I found it hard to make a decent vegetarian meal from the tapa style dishes, since I had tried most of the things I could eat on my previous outing. I usually end up with a lot of cheese, & while it is of excellent quality, you can't eat like that all of the time.   The wine menu is extensive, with 2 oz tastes available as well as larger servings. They will help you out putting together a tasting flight if you wish, but they don't offer preset ones, & you could easily spend a few hours there without knowing about the flight option  The last server we had was great; we didn't feel rushed or uncomfortable, & his suggestions were useful & not intrusive. We didn't feel like we shouldn't be there, which, honestly, we should never feel if we are spending $150 and we aren't rowdy or rude.   It is listed as an accessible restaurant, but that only covers 4 tables at the front, plus a washroom off the bar. The overwhelming majority of seating is not accessible due to stairs, plus most of the front space is actually bar height, leaving you far below your dining companions if you are in a wheelchair. If making reservations, specify you have a wheelchair in the group, or suitable tables might not be available   One piece of advice to the management - if you are going to do staff pep talks about how to maximize sales, which end with \"let's go sell some wine!\", try keeping that behind closed doors, ok? It's extremely tacky to do that at the bar directly in front of customers."}
{"text":"Was here for the first time on the weekend. Decor is modern chic, nicely done. Great wine list for all price ranges and tastes, love how there are different rooms in the venue, upstairs main floor and patio, all provide a different atmosphere. The servers were very friendly and knowledgeable....didnt have food, but menu looks delish!"}
{"text":"SWANK. Not what I would say could be considered casual at all, so put your fanciest duds on and prepare to spend your dough if you want to be able to actually eat here. I'm just lucky i didn't have to pay :). Vin Room is a tapas bar, which a good choice of offerings. Our server was very knowledgable with wine and food pairings, and I actually found a glass of wine I enjoyed (I'm not a wine drinker).  We were feeling a bit adventurous, so we tried things we had never had before, or aren't served on many menus. Like the bone marrow. It looks a little gelatinous, but tastes amazing - yes!  Equally good, were the oysters (fresh), bison tartare, grilled octopus, cheese croquettes and Israeli couscous. Again, unless you have the money to blow, this isn't a place where you'll leave having to undo your top button. It's good for a special occasion, or something different. It's conveniently located in the Mission district, and has a great patio in summer on the roof."}
{"text":"I didn't love this place as much as everyone else seems to. We went on a Saturday night with a group of 3 couples, mid twenties, 3 separate bills. We ordered 2  bottles of champagne and many other drinks. The bill for just me and my boyfriend was over 250 including tip- the other 2 couples bills where a little lower but still well over 100, in other words Vin Room made quite a bit off our table that night. I think the main disappointment was the service, I mean sure we got what we ordered but there was not even a hint of a friendly manner. I felt like I had to \"catch\" the waiter to ask for something (another dish, or drink) and when I did, i felt like I was burdening him. By the way, I saw 2 other tables eating at this time, did not seem busy at all. We ate; the flatiron steak, oysters, scallops, double dip, carpaccio, pork belly wraps and lobster nachos. Out of this list I would say only the steak and scallops were worth praise. The lobster nachos, I was so looking forward to, were cold...and we were sitting right in front of the kitchen .. A-OK...but probably wouldn't return."}
{"text":"Can't get over how good the service, food, and wine is here. Vin Room, you continue to impress!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here last night to have a fun, fancy meal - and I am so glad we did! There is an impressive selection of wines-by-the-glass, as well as seemingly ever-changing dishes.  Unfortunately they were out of steelhead gravlax and elk salami so we skipped charcuterie, but we munched our way through eggplant chips, paprika prawns, lobster nachos and a caprese salad. We enjoyed them all, but especially the caprese salad and the lobster nachos! Put it this way - my boyfriend dislikes lobster but really enjoyed those nachos.  Our waiter mentioned that he has tried all 111 wines they serve by the glass, so after we had ordered 2 2 oz. glasses, we asked him to bring out wines that he thought would work for our dishes - we gave him a price point, and he brought out some fantastic stuff for us to try. It was really fun to have him explain why he chose what he did, it was pretty clear he loves what he does and sharing his passion for good food and good wine with his customers!"}
{"text":"Wow,what a night! We went to this place which was near our B&B.Read the reviews on Yelp and wanted to experience a tapas style bar.We were not disappointed.The tapas were great......well most of them.I would have to say I was not a fan of the lobster tacos.However,the lamb kebobs and the Israeli couscous were out of this world!So was the Oka cheese.We also savoured many different wines with our food.We were lucky as everything we ordered was quite good.To pick a fav wine is close to impossible but here I go......the Maxwell Four Roads Shiraz-Grenache-Voignier blend.Having said this,the next time I go I would have to say I will have another fav wine so don't hold me to this.Service was very helpful and efficient.Our server was a great guy by the name of Tirele(hope I spelled that right).Very knowledgeable and friendly.We also met the owner who was personable and welcoming. I would definitely go back and would also recomend this place to friends.Pricey for sure but we had a great time so it was money well spent for us."}
{"text":"I went here for dinner with a few friends. I read great reviews of this place and had to try it out. Lets say my high expectations were not let down. I tried their eggplant chips, pistachio crusted scallops and feature crem bule. It was exquisite.  It can be a little pricy if you start ordering wine, but the experience is like none other you will find in Calgary."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a glass of wine after dinner.  Enjoyable place for a casual nightcap.  We provided our drink preferences to the waiter who then recommended two wines, both of which were exactly what we were looking for.  Knowledgeable Service, pleasant vibe"}
{"text":"LOVED IT!  Staff was wonderful, always checking in.  They know their wine list and pairings!  We picked food and they picked the wines for us.  Food was great, wine was even better! Will come back again!"}
{"text":"The concept is perfect, the location good, the menu worthy so why then staff it with persons who really want to be somewhere else?  In fairness, I love wine flights. The ability to taste 2oz of almost everything on the menu is awesome. This is an attractor (made it up, so sue me) so I'll be back, been a half dozen times already so I know I will. But sure wish the staff would get more pleasant.  I really liked the pates and cheeses, but pass on the \"house made\" cheese they just don't cut it.  Footnote: coolest menu covers ever. Cork bound, very nice."}
{"text":"A very cool place to wine and dine. Especially nice for a romantic dessert outing! I got the Apple Pear Crumble (Brandy soaked raisins, walnuts, vanilla rooibos gelato) paired with a glass o fN/V Dutschke The Tokay Muscadelle (Australia). My boyfriend enjoyed the Chocolate Banana Bread Pudding (with bourbon caramel sauce, cr√®me anglaise) paired with 1965 Caves Messias Colheita Tawny (Portugal) -- that port was older than both of us!   This place has a warm and trendy environment that's great for a night out with the girls or an intimate night out with a loved one.   You should check it out!"}
{"text":"I suffer from first born syndrome so it veers me from situations that require sharing. I'll just use that excuse as to why I've never been to a tapas bar lol  But I decided to join some friends for a birthday celebration at Vin, not really knowing what to expect.  Our table of 9 was on the upper level - right at the top of the stairs so it was kinda awkward.  Our server was quick to greet each one of us as we arrived, drink orders taken promptly. Glancing at the menu, I was keeping tabs of things that I wanted to try - keeping in mind I had to share ;)  We settled on the grilled pork belly lettuce wraps, calamari, pistachio crusted scallops and lobster nachos. Our vegan tolerant friend went with the double dip, seasonal veggies, eggplant chips and chickpea fritters.  Everything came our pretty quick, and we were all ready to dig in. The pork for the lettuce wraps had a similar flavor to the charbroiled pork chops you get at Vietnamese restaurants. I loved the raisin pineapple chutney that came with the scallops! And the lobster nachos that everyone recommends did not disappoint! Hearty chunks of lobster meat complimented the pico de gallo and cheese. Everything was so good! I managed to sample an eggplant chip and a chickpea fritter, both were pretty tasty.   After being completely stuffed, we were suggested with the idea of dessert. Taking a small peek, we decided to share the s'more. And good thing we did, it was HUGE! It was enough to satisfy 4 of us and yes, at one point we did want s'more :)  Vin made me a believer that sharing is caring! I can't wait to come back to try out the other items on the menu"}
{"text":"The Vin Room patio is a great little oasis on a warm summer afternoon/evening, to drink some good wine and nibble on some tasty treats. I like that you cant really hear the street the way you can with some other area patios. It would be nice if the restrooms weren't such a trek, but that happens with unique locations sometimes.  The service we had was fantastic. Great humour, good recommendations and just the right amount of checking in. The food was good - some awesome, some meh but overall decent offerings. We had the eggplant chips (they were okay), calamari (good), meatballs (great),scallops (okay), flatiron steak (great) and grilled seasonal veggies (meh).  This place seems to have a lot of returning regulars, which is nice to see. It has a casual hey hip vibe. Great place for a night our with a friend or a date.  Pretty easy to find street parking in the area too which is always a bonus!"}
{"text":"Awesome wine selection especially for flights! We had great service. Grabbed some appies and cheese which had a good presentation and great flavors. Knowledgeable servers when it comes to pairing. Great ambiance in the place cool decor. A bit pricey but what wine bar isnt."}
{"text":"Vin Room is a jewel in Mission.  This intimate restaurant has a France-meets-1940s-Americana style that's both appealing and relaxing.  The restaurant is a converted WWII house next to the Second Cup and across from the Joyce on 4th, and I guarantee if you don't look for the red and black sign, you'll probably miss it.  The menu is tapas and (as the name suggests) wine, wine and more wine! I have yet to meet a wine menu like it in Calgary. Absolutely everything on the wine list is available in a variety of glass sizes as well as bottles. This is possible care of the extra cool Italian-invented wine dispenser system at the front bar.  Besides the stellar wine selection, the food here is something to write home about. The tapas menu is not fat; but is far from skinny; and features must-try's like the eggplant chips (which you will read here, are a popular item), a wild mushroom Israeli couscous, a beet and quinoa salad with mint yogurt, a lobster taco, grilled bison and a nice selection of charcuterie and cheese plates. You should try all those, seriously.  I have always had a notable experience at Vin Room, and as I gracefully transition from Club Rat to Lounge Lizard, the Vin Room is an excellent spot to relax - hang out - drink great wine and eat great food all night long with someone you love (or even just like, or your mom, or your friend).  T."}
{"text":"We were looking for a late night patio in mission and decided to hit up vin room. The roof top patio is perfect.   Our server was fantastic. Charming, good raport, and just the right amount of attentiveness. We had a lovely bottle of wine and a few tapas: eggplant chips, lamb kabobs, and a couple of oysters. The lamb kabobs stole the show, so tender and spiced perfectly. Delish."}
{"text":"If they don't have a working menu in the website that says it all . Get it fixed . Waste of people's time"}
{"text":"Excellent selection of wine and this establishment neutralizes a huge pet peeve of mine; staff that genuinely knows good wine based on described taste and pallet. They don't push the priciest or labels, but what works with your taste or food selection. This is service I'm willing to pay for.  Another great feature is the fact they have found wines from smaller boutique wineries and nearly all the staff is educated in each one. I highly recommend the venue for business meetings or somewhere you wish to have conversation. I could actually hear the whole table and it caters to a more professional crowd; which is something I prefer."}
{"text":"Came with reservations for a date night. Wine selection was amazing and the sommalier came by a few times and was very knowledgeable. Built our own charcuterie platter and all of it was delicious"}
{"text":"Damn Africa, what happened? (High fives to all that know this reference ps)   But really though, Vin Room. What did happen? You used to have great service, delicious food and a wonderful vibe. Now, since my last visit I will never return.  Shall I elaborate? OK, since you asked....  Two of my friends and I came here around 8pm on a Friday looking for a few glasses of wine, some tasty nibbles and a good girls night. Both of them never been here before but love wine and so after me convincing them that this place was \"sooo good\", we decided to go. MISTAKE.   When we arrived there was maybe 3 or 4 other tables of two but it wasn't super busy by any means so we got sat right away. Our server that came over was an older gentleman (At least that is what I will call him since my mama raised me right) however buddy was no gentleman. From the moment he came over to our table AGE DISCRIMINATION set in.   He was very condescending from the start, he would scoff/rolled his eyes and sigh loudly when we didn't know what type of wine to order and when we asked for suggestions. Once we got that out of the way and he brought our wine over, we said we'd like to order food as well, he nodded and walked away.... Then, we sat for 20 mins for him to come back and take our food order. This service kept up the entire night. At one point, we had to wave another person down and ask if our server was ever going to come back to our table so we could order a second glass of wine each...   What was worse, was this wasn't an issue with just him in general though, because with all the other tables he was serving (which by the way were all older than us) he practically kissed their feet and was constantly chatting with them and bringing them drinks.   We felt unwanted and the whole situation was damn right appalling. We went to the bar without ordering a second glass, paid our bill and left.   And you know what made me the most upset? That I put my lovely ladies into this environment, thinking that we would have a really nice evening - like I have in the past.   Not cool, and never again"}
{"text":"Vin Room is a funky little place with a great vibe and interesting decor.  We went for the tapas and had a good experience.  Service was just okay, seemed a little distracted and didn't seem to think we were interested in a pre-dinner cocktail -- wrong assumption.  Which, by the way, was a treat. The wine inspired cocktails while expensive are worth a try.  We had a number of tapas dished. The meat and cheese board selections are over priced but good. Of the various tapas items, their \"special\" lobster nachos was just okay, overcooked lobster on soggy nachos.  The meatballs, falafel and scallops were all very good and I recommend them.  We liked the char as well and the bread pudding for dessert was a good as it gets.  One thing, TAKE THE CHICHARONES OFF THE MENU.  They are an embarrassment to the restaurant and I would have given Vin Room a 4 star rating if it wasn't for them.  They are Safeway Pork Rinds -- do NOT -- repeat do NOT order them.  Save your money and buy 10 bags of them at Safeway if you want to experience them for the same price."}
{"text":"Vin Room was the venue of choice for a recent get together with friends.  It was a fabulous place to be able to catch up, while leisurely enjoying a meal and a few drinks.  The ambiance is trendy, yet comfortable. There is a nice romantic undertone to it teamed with enough energy so it is not awkwardly so, making it a great place to go on those first few dates you rather fancy.  Food was fantastic!  Being tapas, portions are smaller and ideal for sharing.  We had a group of four and it was nice to be able to easily nibble at a bunch of dishes, instead of sticking to our own.  Each dish was presented in a eye pleasing fashion & flavors danced on my tongue. Had no desire to rush through any of the meal. Lobster nachos were better than I expected, with generous chunks of meat on the dish.  The bone marrow was a special treat & a must try if you are adventurous. The dessert had me wanting to lick my plate afterwards (not a usual desire of mine.)  I took a chance and ordered the chocolate banana bread pudding, even though I am not normally a bread pudding kind of gal. The bourbon sauce is still stuck in my mind. Sign of a truly wonderful dessert.  I am looking forward to going back so that I can try the lamb kabobs & eggplant chips.  Wine is definitely a highlight here!  You can order anything from tastes to full bottles.  Allows for ample opportunity to try something you would not normally have, without feeling like you are making a commitment.  Service was laid back, but not lacking.  There was no pressure to hurry things along and any questions were happily (& thoughtfully) answered. Suggestions were available if needed.  DEFINITELY MAKE A RESERVATION!   Pros: - Amazing food - Large wine selection (check out the cool setup behind the bar!) - Friendly service - Hip atmosphere  Cons: - Breezy when seated near the door - A little squishy in terms of space - Women's bathroom was a little dirty"}
{"text":"Oh love, love, love this place! Came here with for some wine and conversation and left with a fully belly, feeling satisfied.   The concept is great where you can order small tasting glasses of wine, full glass, and so on. The selection of tapas is creative and full of wonderful choices as well. My only problem is that I would want to camp out here forever so I could try everything!  The sommelier was very attentive and gave excellent recommendations, so if you really don't know what you are in the mood for, you have someone who can make the decision for you.  Come here with an open mind and lots of time. Don't rush the experience and  you will get full enjoyment!"}
{"text":"Been here for lunch, dinner and just drinks. I have been with friends as well as for business. Each time has been great and I can only recall one time when I left annoyed and disappointed. Which isn't bad since I have been here at least 10 times.  The food and service is great and I do like the sleek and modern decor. Will be back again."}
{"text":"I thought i had moved to Hollywood when I first heard about this place. Everyone was telling me it was hard to get a reservation. We tried it for a work drinks night and the server was decent. She accomodated us only after a member of our group turned out to be a friend of the owner. Everything is overpriced and the food isn't that good. Another LA restaurant in Calgary...great."}
{"text":"We extended our double date last night to this venue and I am so glad that we did.  We decided to go for wine and dessert and it was so worth it!     We sat upstairs and the setting was trendy and romantic yet comfortable.  I fell in love with the place immediately and loved a green retro looking high back sofa.  Perfect for two!  However, we were 4, so we sat at a comfortable double couched table.    Our server was fantastic!  Great for giving recommendations, but had a sense of humour as well... even going as far as teasing my hubby for copying me and getting a blush as well.  I chose the JaJa De Jau rose which I really enjoyed.    Hubby and I decided to share two desserts.  The first being the creme brulee and pistachio shortbread cookies and the second was a delicious dark chocolate espresso delight!  Both were so good and I cannot really say I had a favorite between the two.    The service was prompt and our waters never got close to being empty until we were done.  Two hours flew by so quickly and again our time there was fantastic!  I will definitely be a repeat offender!"}
{"text":"We visited the Vin Room on Saturday night.  The atmosphere is terrific, great lighting and decor.  We were all psyched for a great date night and it was underwhelming.   We felt the menu was too big and when we asked our waitress for some recommended pairings, she pointed out the single flight and bite on the menu and said that was it.  We had hoped that she could actually give us some great options.  It may have been that they were just out of everything.   There were several cheese and meat choices that were no longer available.  We had the lamb meatballs and they were excellent, the egg plant chips were good and that was the description we had for all the 5 other items we had with the exception of the sweet potato dip which lacked flavour and was left practically untouched.    We did like the descriptions of the wines and were very happy with the beer, 3 wines and the prosecco that we chose and the coffe was excellent too.   We chose this restaurant based on the other reviews we found on Yelp and we seemed to have a very different experience than most other people on the site.  We wonder if it was just inexperienced staff or a bad night in the kitchen.. We will likely go back when the rooftop patio is open, but all in all it just didn't wow us."}
{"text":"Wonderful - afternoon with our Westie! Great wine tidy little appies, great oysters! Dog people head that way, if the front patio has room, go in and sit down!! Wonderful way to spend and afternoon."}
{"text":"Easy to get to on 4th and easy to find parking in Mission on the nearby streets. I had not been here before but anything that serves Tapas - I am in, a nosher I am!!!! Good suggestion by my dining partner as usually he wants me to initiate where we go! Walked in - lack of hostess at the stand for a few min - not good - hate standing there at the front when people are seated and eating, trying to relax. 2 hostesses came then at the same time, menus were grabbed and up to a 2nd level we went! This place is like a renovated house that must have cost a fortune to open up into what it has become. The interior is clean and well decorated, just stunning - chandeliers, jaw dropping!  The second level has a very dark, fancy \"vampirey\" (as described to me but I agree somewhat) feel to it. It could have used some splashes of red maybe on the walls but it was a really cool room. The music was Depeche Mode style throughout the whole dinner. I could take or leave that. Our server Christian was a doll. A fellow foodie he was and he had no problem telling us our 3 tapas choices were his absolute faves and he talked about his favourite wines as well. Even brought us a light sample of red zin to try on the house. Classy. We ordered:   1 - Lobster tacos (thanks to some reviews on here (*thanks guys and dolls*) and they did not disappoint. FRESH tortilla chips and yummy hot sauce on top)  2 - Lamb Skewers (to die for, we forget to cook lamb at home these days and I miss it - melt in your mouth lamb on a bed of cooked spinach in a curry like sauce)  3 - Seared Scallops (OMG! Ony get 2 on the plate but the broth it comes with is MMMMM - great seasoning on everything and the scallops were cooked to perfection!)  We also ordered some bread and smoked butter ($3) and 2 glasses of Malbec ($10 each, not bad) We also ordered a dessert! A chocolate torte, not on the menu - sooo good. All desserts with the exception of the gelato are made in house! All desserts $9.  Service was good, friendly as mentioned but slow at times getting food and dessert out. The upstairs was busy so I am not sure if Christian was slow due to the kitchen but...  the food was so carefully prepped and delicious, it was worth the wait. The restaurant focuses on LOCAL goods and SEASONAL dishes.      $71.40 before tip and this was was incredible value in my opinion for what we got including wine!           Thanks Vin, I left a Happy Cat and we will be back!"}
{"text":"I have since spoken with the owner of Vin who has been very gracious and understanding.  I have decided that it is silly of me to not give this place a second visit.  As a new buisness, when I had my experience, they may have been still working out all the kinks. I appreciate the time which was taken to hear my concern."}
{"text":"We love the Vin Room. Good wine list and great food. The service is always professional. Thank you Phoebe Chow for doing such a great job."}
{"text":"Went in with a group last night to support the Vin Room, which just opened back up post-flood.  We had a pitcher of sangria, which was out of this world. We also had a whole truckload of food: charcuterie, lobster nachos, house made potato chips with paprika and chipotle lime sour cream (yes, that's right!), grilled prawns, lamb chops on quinoa. And it was all the most delicious thing. All of the things. So. Delicious.  Our servers were so attentive and friendly. I want to be their friend. All of them. Hey! Vin Room Servers! Wanna hang out?  Vin room, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Went here for dessert once with Port, and another time for appetizers with wine pairings. The food is amazing and the wine list impressive. There are over 70 bottles available by the glass.   This makes the perfect place for a romantic night. One day it is my dream to come there with a bunch of friends and like $150 each and try wines all night long."}
{"text":"Sometimes exceptional, sometimes less than average.  4 stars because of their wine selection.  Them do have signature dishes, lobster nachos are a must.  Good cocktails menu also.  Service was very good on the last visit though."}
{"text":"Thank-you for another fantastic evening with great food, wine, service and company! Can't wait to spend some summer evenings out on the rooftop patio!"}
{"text":"Wonderful wine, food, service, and atmosphere. The food is tapas style (small plated to share) but not necessarily Spanish. The lobster nachos were unreal - i would highly recommend them to anyone! We also really loved the cauliflower flatbread and roasted vegetables. I had a rosemary and gin cocktail which was delicious and of course the wine here is amazing. Our server was fantastic and made some really great recommendations. We also appreciated that it was quiet in the restaurant and easier to converse. I hope to be back soon!"}
{"text":"These guys evidently weren't paying attention in bartending school. Whatever garbage well whiskey they used for this old fashioned is frankly insulting to this classic cocktail. No cherry?? Needs much improvement."}
{"text":"I've been to the Vin Room twice, and it's been an excellent experience both times. While I'm not a wine lover (yet, I'm trying, but I'd prefer a cocktail given the choice), they are always very patient and help me select something I'll enjoy. The wine list is extensive (as you'd hope) and I like how they have it separated by \"taste\" for those of us not familiar with different wines. They also have an impressive machine the spans the entire bar to keep open bottles fresh.   The food (tapas) is excellent. As a non-red meat eater it can be a little harder to find items for consumption, but they do have quite a few that fit into my lifestyle. We had lobster nachos (about what you'd think), polenta hush puppies (the red pepper sauce was awesome) and the grilled cheese (would have been nice for the pear flavour to stand out a little). The tartar and bone marrow were ordered by my tablemates and both received rave reviews.  Desserts were to die for. The apple/pear crumble, almond cake and banana bread pudding were all excellent. There's also a good selection of dessert wines, ports and liquers.  Overall, a great experience. Servers came around often to check on us & we had a good evening."}
{"text":"My first visit here with a group that was supposed to be 8 and ended up being 14! Our server took it in stride and provided amazing service.   Instead of having us order, he suggested that they just bring share plates out of their more popular dishes. It was a fantastic suggestion and went over so well! The food was amazing!  What a great, cozy atmosphere they have- you feel right at home as soon as you walk in. I want to go back right now!  Oh, and the wine!! Our server was so knowledgeable and there were soooo many wine options by the glass, you could really find something for anyone. Also some great wines from less known regions.  The restaurant owner, Phoebe, even came over to ask how we were and helped out with the service (I just love when this happens!)  5 stars hands down and will definitely come back again and again!"}
{"text":"Vin room ... What happened?!?! We used to be friends - your food is still tasty and your wine divine ... But why must you close early all if the time??? Not once but twice now the last 2 times we have tried to go for a drink you have your doors closed early. Last night was my birthday we drove downtown to have some celebratory drinks only to be turned away. The doors were open, staff inside and customers and no chairs up yet... Not even 10 pm and the door clearly states open until 11 - but the host said we are closing up soon - we said that was fine we just wanted to have drinks - but were told no.... Not cool vin room not cool :("}
{"text":"Review #27 of Yelp's 30 Day Challenge 2012  I had heard a lot about this place...in fact was due to meet a friend here for dinner a year ago and plans fell through.  And so expectations were high...maybe too high.  I had made reservations a month prior since we had cousins coming into town joining us for dinner & a concert later.  We arrived and the place was not that busy for a Sunday evening.  But right after us people started coming in and it filled up.  We enjoyed reviewing the menu selections and ended up ordering quite a feast which included 2 charcuterie boards and another 6 tapas.  Initially the waitress was a little pushy trying to get us to place an order and hovering (nothing like feeling pressure) and when I finally ordered the wine for the table she seemed slightly taken aback that I ordered the wine instead of the menfolk (I worked in the biz 20yrs ago and I know wine, so really who cares who orders).  Our cousin (the other lady in the group) ordered a flight of wine tasters and was waiting for the charcuterie to arrive so she could enjoy some of the cheese with her wine.  45 minutes later we finally had to enquire as to where are meal was since we had a concert to go to in an hour.  What we were \"told\" was there was a large group in the house and only 2 in the kitchen.  What we \"heard\" was we didn't properly staff our restaurant for this evening and so all the customers food will take a long time.  Seriously a charcuterie board taking 60 minutes??  10 minutes later it finally arrived.  It was certainly delicious but the wine flight had long been consumed by this time.  5 minutes later the tapas started arriving and of course we were running late so everything was eaten hastily and we can't help but wonder prepared this way also.  The BC Seared Scallops were gritty although the broth was tasty.  The Eggplant Chips were missing the eggplant and all you could taste was the crispy coating.  The Falafels were doughy inside.  The Flight & Bite with Lamb Stew was good.  The Artic Char was good....the Lobster Nachos had a nice flavour but seemed to be missing lobster (3 pieces is all we could find).   Finally the Flank steak arrived and made hubs happy.  Cooked to perfection.  Even more delightful were the accompanying cooked winter greens.  Holy deliciousness...everyone agreed and we chowed down on those delectable greens like hungry little rabbits.  During our meal we asked for the wine menu again since the cousin with the empty wine flight had not been asked if she wanted anything further to drink.  For a waitress who was hovering at the beginning we had to battle to get and keep her attention now.  Our cousin was drinking white and asking for suggestions.  She was given a recommendation by the waitress who then turned to leave without addressing any of the rest of us.  We called her back...since we also wanted to order more wine.  Wow does body language speak volumes and we felt like we were imposing on our waitress.  I ordered 2 more wine tasters for hubs & myself.  Then the waitress turned to run away again not even addressing the white wine drinker who was also ready to order.  We called her back YET again and uneasily felt like we were still bothering her.  Since we were already late for the concert we had no time for dessert or an after dinner beverage.  We spent a lot of money for a mediocre evening and left slightly disappointed by the overall experience.  The cousins advised they enjoyed the company and some of the food/wine but this would not be there first choice again.  As for us I am hoping it was just bad planning and a bad night for the restaurant unfortunately at our expense.  I can honestly say I would try any of the other dozen wine bars first before rushing back here.  First impressions......"}
{"text":"Hippy New Years everyone!!  Welcome to 2010!  The hotspot of choice for this yelper to bring in the new years was The VIN Room in the Mission Area.  There was an awkward reservation/table misunderstanding at the beginning but that was very easily cleared up, and we found ourselves upstairs at a swagger table for two by the window.   Very elegantly dressed and extremely cozy.  The top floor stays in keeping with the decor of first floor, with black wallpapered walls with just a hint of floral design.  Deep chocolate brown highlights and a punch of aquamarine blue in the glass candle holders to rightly bring all that class together.  Bursts of black accents embracing light fixtures and a modern fireplace with sleek mosaic work at the far end of the room.  It was all so perfect for setting a tone for a great New Year's to come.  Tonight VIN offers a 4 course New Years Eve Dinner with a wine pairing list if you choose to step it up a notch. I wanted to ease down on the drinking this year and decided to try a couple of 2 oz glasses of red instead which were both full bodied and smoky.  The first course was served immediately upon sitting, a simple combination of capresse skewers with pita and white bean dip.   The second course were these extremely delicious cod cakes.  These just melted in my mouth.  With these two courses we were already full but when the lamp chops were presented in front of me, of course I found room for them.  These were grilled to perfection and accompanied with a wonderful mint sauce.   All courses were served at the appropriate intervals, and Phoebe the owner checked in on us periodically which is always a nice personal touch.  And finally to bring everything together a nice smooth Cr√®me Brule for dessert.    The New Years Eve Dinner was only $45, which was amazing considering the quality and portions of all four courses.  It was such a wonderful evening overall, and we still had enough time to dance the night away.  Again I insist in review number three, that Vin Room serves it up as one of the best spots for wine, food and ambiance."}
{"text":"YAY!!! I finally got to try Vin Room!  I've been hearing so many wonderful things and of course, reading all of the positive Yelp reviews. So after Lilac Fest yesterday, boyfriend and I walked over to Vin Room hoping to score a spot on their super cute patio. Luckily they had a table open, although it wasn't a prime people watching spot. I was pretty content nonetheless. They had a special Lilac Festival menu, so I didn't have the chance to scope out their everyday offerings, but everything looked so wonderful! We actually only planned to have a glass of wine, but I ended up ordering some oysters and they were delicious. My wine was a wonderful compliment and our server was lovely.  I cant wait to come back here for dinner and try more of what Vin Room has to offer. The restaurant itself is beautiful and cozy, and would make for a perfect date night! 5 stars from me!"}
{"text":"My friends and I were looking for a dog friendly patio as my husband and I were in town but travelling with our dog.   This patio was really great! They had little dog beds for your furry friend to lay on. And when they served our meal, they brought out some in-house dog treats for my pup. Amazing!   The food we ordered was exceptional! My favourite was the beef carpaccio. It comes with a side of fresh chips and was really delicious!   Other winners : -lobster nachos -chicken meatballs (only $5 and really tasty!)  -eggplant chips -short ribs (crispy and melt in your mouth!)   My husband and I ordered way too much food and so only ordered one dessert to share. The cr√®me brulee was so yummy, especially paired with one of their lattes. But we're still kicking ourselves for not ordering the carrot cake when it arrived for my friend. It looked unreal!   Service was fast and very friendly. The only thing I would have loved to see available on the menu is a sweet cider or a sweet sangria!   We had a really great experience at this tapas bar and I'm already looking forward to returning!   Ashley Marie"}
{"text":"Finally have the time to review this very SEXY, SLEEK and SEDUCTIVE joint. Very posh, intimiate venue with equally impressive wait staff.  Every server is well equipped to suggest a good wine, even if you don't know what you want. Seating spaces are fitted, layout definately makes you engage your company a little more than intimately (so bring a hot date).   Menu allows you to try many different types of wines without committing to a bottle (if you have commitment problems and just want some fun) in 2oz 4oz or 6oz, so it's a great place to find \"that one special wine for you.\"  One of my secret spots (not so secret now) is here, on the patio. This place features an absolutely fabulous second floor patio that overlooks 4th street, so you can watch the drunkies across the way, or enjoy the cars and people through your wine glass. The trees are lit up with lights and on brisk nights the patio is heated with heat lamps. Absolute perfect place to curl up to your newly found love. *hugs wine glass*  On busy nights, wait can be a bit long so make resos."}
{"text":"I had THE BEST time at Vin Room yesterday. It was sooooo good, in fact, that I just had to upgrade my review from a 5 start to, well.. a 5 star. Have you read any reviews that wished they could give a biz 0 stars? The same feeling works in the opposite direction. I wish there were unlimited amounts of stars to shower on the delightfulness that is Vin Room.  It was the first time I had been upstairs at Vin Room and we spent our Friday afternoon ordering tapas from the menu and sipping on custom flights of wine that our server, Christian, put together for us. Once again, those egg plant chips had a love affair with my mouth, and the first of the white wines danced around my tastebuds as I swished the light, sweet liquid around my palate.  Other tapas we tried included the couscous with quinoa. The quinoa added texture and substance to the dish. I'm not so sure about the presentation on this one, it came out in this silver bowl, and it was made into a square in the middle. I felt a little bit like I was eating out of a dog food dish. Let me make very clear, however, that it tasted nothing like dog food. It was light and delicious and I gladly ate every last morsel from that dish... which in fact came in handy for ensuring nothing was leftover. So, while it looked a little weird, it was indeed very practical.  We also chowed down on the Cornish game hen. One leg/thigh piece battered and brought up for us to share. Maybe battered isn't quite the right word, it wasn't like a deep-fried piece of chicken, but rather came lightly dusted with spices and with a crispy skin on the outside.  And lastly, we finished off with a cheese board, goat cheese, blue cheese and brie. And I cannot forget my final glass of port. I think I spent 20 minutes sniffing it before I was ever ready to take a sip. It smelled of Sun-Maid raisins the minute you open the little box.   At the end of our visit, we were the only two left sitting upstairs. Christian took care of us every step of the way. He even stayed well beyond his shift (he ended at 4) instead of simply passing us on to someone else. At one point in the afternoon, Tara had something caught in her eye. While she was in the washroom taking care of it, Christian inquired after her, \"I hope she's alright,\" he said with genuine concern. He even offered to fetch the Vin Room's eye wash kit if she was unsuccessful in her efforts to remove whatever was bothering her eye. Talk about your table-side manner.  Suffice it to say, I'm in love with this spot. From food to drink to service, it's a real treat every time I visit."}
{"text":"When I used to live in Calgary I definitely went to this restaurant a fair bit as I loved the atmosphere, food, wine selection, service etc... I was back in town visiting family and decided to go there after my extended hwy drive from Edmonton (due to weather conditions) at the last minute with 2 other people and was impressed with our hostess as she got us in and it was busy in there! So I was grateful for that. The food and the wine were as exceptional as I remember if not better! I won't go into the details as many of the reviews have captured how good the food is! So then you ask why I give such a poor start rating? It was our server!  I felt like I was being belittled when and how she asked me if I wanted a \"starter price or high end price\" for wine when I was ordering a glass. I have never been asked that even in some of the even higher end restaurants in New York, Scottsdale, Tokyo, London etc... After that, everything was an up-sell once she overheard the other two at my table were Lawyers from encouraging us to order more food and the more expensive items and extra dessert. Finally, nothing against charity but I felt we were very pushed to buy these calendars their restaurant was selling as the money was going to the United Way. I donate and even volunteer my time to charities so I get it. And United Way is a very worthy charity but when she made me feel like I was a horrible person for not donating as well as being a dog hater because the calendars featured dogs I was done!"}
{"text":"The wine choices and the wait service were fantastic, but I think the Vin Room is for a very specific crowd, for specific situations.  I went there for the first time recently for some after-work chill time with the girls and felt of place in business casual clothing. The staff were great and helped us find some nice wines when we got seated. I wanted something light to eat but the fried garbanzo beans I ordered were way too salty. It was the only vegetarian option on the menu, so my friend decided not to order anything. I also wish they did debit payment at the tables. Paying to leave took a really long time from the one till. I left hungry and a little annoyed that I went all the way there from across town for a mediocre experience.  I think I would go back if I had a client who was a true blue wine connoisseur and it was post-meal, but it's not my kind of place to frequent."}
{"text":"Drinking wine and creepin' people on 4th St as they go by...does it get any better?  I have two favorite spots at Vin Room. In the winter, it's perched in front of the window watching everyone walk by. In the summer, it's perched on the patio overlooking everyone walking by. Yes, creeping on strangers is more socially acceptable if you have a glass of wine or a cocktail in your hand. You should try it sometime.   The Vin Room does have an extensive wine list, but they also have some interesting (read: unusual) cocktails worth trying, if you are adventurous. I went in there last night and our waiter recommended a Japanese whiskey. It was stellar. I can't wait to get my hands on a bottle.   I've always felt that the food was a bit odd. they do some cheese, charcuterie and tapas dishes, so you'd think there would be something for everyone - but it seems to be quite narrow in focus. I notice there isn't very much for high maintenance eaters - either gluten free or vegetarian. I wouldn't go there hungry, but if you're looking for a small bite, have at 'er.   Note: The Vin Room is a wine bar, so not having huge quantities of food doesn't really affect my opinion of the place, I'm still a fan. I like how helpful and friendly the staff is and the dark/cozy vibe in winter (as well as the sunny, amazing patio in summer)."}
{"text":"I've wanted to try the Vin Room for sometime and considering it was my partner's birthday, we thought - perfect timing.   The ambience of the VIN Room is cozy luxury with great tables and comfortable chairs. I prefer the upstairs to the main floor. There were very few people when we arrived so the service was intimate, yet respectful.   I love to explore flavours and this is where the Vin Room excels. It is taster wines meet tapas plates. This is where the joy of wine meets the joy of food.   Tonight we had meatballs, chicken skewers, charcuterie mixed with gamay  and prosecco. Tons of flavours and experiences in one night. This place is about wine and food.   No big heavy meals here with only bottles of wine, you can sample amazing flavourful dishes with incredible wines and stay within a reasonable budget.   As Arnold said - I'll be back."}
{"text":"The BF and i were in the mood for a light meal and we decided to give Vin Room a shot.  The decor was luxe, and stylish with the direction it was going. The set up was very intimate and cosy - we got a little corner table upstairs in the back with ostrich leather seats. I found the service erratic and random. We had 4 different servers, who were all dressed differently. I wouldn't have known they were servers if they hadn't been carrying trays. They mostly seemed detached and distracted, maybe it had been a busy night?  There was a good variety of wine, and our first server was helpful in suggesting one according to my requests. We ordered the seared scallops, duck, several cheeses, and a dessert. I thought the presentation of the food was great, but the flavours and textures mediocre. The scallops weren't as creamy as I hoped, and the duck wasn't anything special. Nonetheless, I was grateful for the gluten-free S'more dessert, which was delicious.  The tapas were good, just not good enough to justify the prices.   I did not regret my experience at Vin Room, but I am not sure if i will come back."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant twice now. The first time was average and the second time was so awful that I would not consider going back. The food is overpriced for the portions and quality that you receive. They do have a good selection of wine but the overall experience just seemed too pretentious and uncomfortable....especially during my second visit. This restaurant is located in my neighborhood and I would never consider stepping foot in here again. There are too many other good options in Calgary."}
{"text":"Nice and wide wine variety, good tapas, excellent place, good attention"}
{"text":"Excellent wine!! Delicious appetizers!! And good service!! I had a great time in this place  ! The oysters were good and the meatballs delicious! We also had the \"make your own plate\" and everything was great!! Definitely would go back there!!"}
{"text":"Our server was not attentitive and pre judged us for sure. I am in the industry and know good service- this was not it.  When we told her that we had shells in our oysters she just walked away. Waited too long for a glass of wine and she was not very informative. We had to ask other servers for help and guidance with the menu.  Please note that especially over the holidays some of us are willing to spend really good money on food and drink...if we choose YOUR venue...you should know this."}
{"text":"I had high expectations for the Vin Room.  We tried the Big Taste Event in March to try out high end restaurants for a reasonable price.  While the food was very good, some things didn't work for me.  The glasses for one.  A restaurant that prides itself on it's wine tasting should have big round bowl glasses so customers can really swirl and taste the wine. The food was served on a porous uneven slate rectangle that made it hard for a fork to scoop up the pureed carrots. And the whole upper floor was very dark.  It would benefit from a candle or two at the table. As food is a sensory experience, one should be able to see the food as well as taste it.  As well, there were extra charges for a few extra pieces of bread, or crackers to go with the cheese pieces.  Bread is cheap.  It makes the restaurant feel cheap if they charge for these nice little extras. The server was annoying as well.  She interrupted the conversation at least 5 times to ask about various things.  She could have timed her interjection a bit more skillfully. And when a customer chooses a wine, the server should not offer a different one (and twice as expensive) unless asked to recommend one. Overall, I won't go back. Even though I love wine, there are so many other wonderful places to go and enjoy it with good service and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Vin Room is one of those not so usual places which may be either loved tenderly, or avoided carefully. And I am sort of on the \"avoid\" side as a final verdict, but feel like making certain points to recognize the definitive qualities of this place.  - I loved their little \"patio\" on the roof, it was always fun to sit there, with all those cozy pillows and huge glasses on the shaky tables.  - I loved their menu, offering that comfortable approach to browse and select \"something red... heavy... lots of flavor... oh here - like seven options to choose from! Ok, let me try this one...\"  For the \"deltas\":  - I did not like the food. Even though Vin Room is not a place to eat, still, it would definitely help to provide something nice for the stomach, not only for the liver and kidneys.  - I did not like the service, which was always slow and sort of absentminded when you were asking them precise questions about the wine you are looking for. A bit snobbish at times, too - or so I felt. Maybe should have used the office attire instead of casual, I don't know.  And for the price... Ah... Ok, wallet-scratching, though not a big deal - but I just finally gave up. Not even me - my wife decided that she'd rather no, and I concurred."}
