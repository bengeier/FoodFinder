{"text":"Have now been to KuuSushi twice and both times have been excellent!  Really enjoyed the soup and salad bar.  Ordering on the tablet ensures that everything you order arrives...and arrives fast!  Sashimi was presented beautifully.  We tried several new sushi rolls and loved each one.   The Thai dishes were wonderful.  We tried almost everything.  My parents favourite was the sweet and sour shrimp.  I loved the mango chicken and Cantonese chow mien.  We tried almost all of the beef dishes and every one was great.   The staff was pleasant and helpful.  Looking forward to many more delicious meals at KuuSushi!"}
{"text":"Food arrived fast, but service was bad. The wait staffs goal is to leave things on the edge of the table and leave asap. Whole table had to wave their hands in the air to flag a staff down and that took a good minute or more each time. The so called buffet is a joke since they can't even refill the few items they have.  The soft serve ice cream is dripping all over the floor and no one cared to clean it up from the time we arrive and left.  Food quality is mediocre. Had better. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Can't say much about the AYCE, but we ordered off the a la carte and had a decent amount of food (for two) for $35 (this was on a sunday where AYCE was 28.99 each). Sushi was great, and i dont usually get cali rolls but their was amazing. worth it, but can't say much for AYCE."}
{"text":"Came here because couple people recommended it and it was really close to home.   We had a reservation and still had to wait 30 minutes for a table. The restaurant had many empty tables. When we sat down, the waiter asked what we would like to drink and we said tea. Turns out the tea isn't free. Turns out everything aside from water isn't free.   We had tablets to pick what we wanted, afterwards we couldn't decide where to put the tablet! It was so big compared to the table. We looked around and saw many had proped it up against a wall of some sorts. We didn't have that luxury.   The food took a while to come. Some dishes which we ordered first round came in second. The food was okay, not bad but not special. Although their blow torch sushi is absolutely amazing. If you come here, I highly recommend that.  The salad bar was a complete let down. The miso soup stayed empty for the entire time we were there. Even so, alot of people were checking it out. Seems like they don't really keep an eye on the bar.  Prices were expensive, especially since drinks weren't included. Probably won't return, but good to go atleast once to try the blowtorch sushi."}
{"text":"favourite all you can eat sushi restaurant in the suburbs! worth the price.  the sushi is always fresh fast and very friendly. clean restaurant. awesome buffet of salads soups and dessert. amazing variety of sushi rolls and asian / thai food. you order off an ipad. so easy and fast to process. love the description of what you are ordering. i love the friendly service. love the freshness of the food. thanks for always making my sushi kuu experience the best. this is the only sushi restaurant i will continue to eat at. amazing!! keep up the great food & amazing service and you will be successful and busy for many more years to come! customer for life! :)"}
{"text":"Very nice place. Fresh food. We had all you can eat.  Salmon tataki and white fish carpacio are really good."}
{"text":"Super surprised that I really loved this place! I was prepared for another typical mediocre AYCE place but this new joint has really one upped the game.  Food - Quality is good. Fish is fresh, the salad bar was fully stocked and had some great options. The rolls are complex and interesting which really was wonderful. They also have a soft-serve machine for dessert which was amazing!  Service - I'm so shocked that the service was actually great! They were friendly and super attentive. They also accommodated all our weird requests no problem. Kept re-filling our drinks and brought out all the menu items we ordered. I'm not sure if this positive experience is just due to our past AYCE bad service experience, or if they actually do have really good service! Hoping its the latter.  Atmosphere - This is a new place so it was clean, and recently renovated. It was comfortably setup. They also have the ipad ordering system so that was good too.  Price- This is the only downside, you're paying for all the goodness above at it comes at a cost of more than $10 over the average AYCE place. I'd go again for a special occasion."}
{"text":"Great sushi for a great price. Very visually appealing as well. A definite must go to"}
{"text":"I was hesitant to try this place because of the price (compared to the usual place that I go to). But I was surprised. The foods pretty good and they have cheese wontons! I like ordering from the tablets so we don't have to wave down any waiters. I also like the sushi/salad bar. Nice and clean place. Our server was professional and actually smiling! I will definitely go back. FYI: they charge for tea"}
{"text":"We sent to Kuu for lunch with a group of 8 people. It is a new place, nicely renovated with beautiful interior. It is more like upscale all you can eat.  The price for lunch during the week is $18.  You order through a tablet and you get food very quick. This way there was no confusion with your order.  The menu doesn't have too many roll choices, but all food was very delicious.  Salads, soups and ice cream are served as a buffet table. I found it convenient. The service was ok, like in all similar places. I never actually got an excellent service in all you can eat. The reason I'm giving this place a 4 star review is because they still didn't open the patio and were sitting people only in one half of the restaurant. I don't like when restaurants do it, it is convenient for them, but very unprofessional. Everyone has to sit back to back when other side of the restaurant was empty. Patio has all the furniture, not sure why they don't use it. It was a wonderful day to be outside."}
{"text":"Have been here a few times and the food is pretty good but not outstanding compared to most AYCE sushi places. Have to pay for tea which is not good. The main reason for writing this review is that this time my wife and I both had food poisoning, definitely from here. It lasted a couple of days and was probably from a chicken dish that we both had in common. We will probably not visit again."}
{"text":"Consistently good and fun place. Updated my review from 4 to 5 stars as I feel they deserve it. Great selection of food and easy tablet ordering."}
{"text":"I like this place. The quality is not top notch, but compared to other All you Can Eat sushi spots I have tried all over town, both their service and their variety is great. I specially love the soft serve ice cream machine. It is spacious and the Sushis are fresh. However, it is an all you can eat after all so it sometimes takes them a while to replenish their desserts and other buffet items."}
{"text":"New favourite AYCE spot, people say this place is a little pricer than other AYCE spots but i think the price not bad at all considering the quality of the food here. Service was quick and friendly. A help yourself salad bar is available with desert on the side to your pleasure as well. The rolls were amazing, a lot of different rolls that seems to take more time to make but were so delicious. By far the best AYCE sushi i've been to!"}
{"text":"Amazing experience | Great value for money | Top notch service | Tablet ordering system | Excellent presentation  This will be our go-to AYCE sushi. Went on a Saturday for Dinner ($28.99 Adult).  DECOR: Very modern, clean, nice lighting and murals. The tables are quite close together, but I didn't care, I'm there to eat and enjoy the time with the wife; not listen to other people's gossip :D  DISHES: + FRESH, DELICIOUS, GREAT PORTIONS    = Sushi and sashimi were very fresh to the taste    = Very well made sushi rice and the perfect serving size  SERVICE: + ATTENTIVE SERVERS    = Was able to easily flag down servers    = Finished plates were removed often    = Water was refilled frequently without asking    = All orders came out and fast (even though it was peak dinner time)  SUMMARY Overall had an amazing experience. For us two, we had 70+ orders and was totally worth the price. We do not eat out often, so choosing a reliable place with great value and quality is really important to us.  FAV. DISHES: + SUSHI: Squid, salmon, unagi, great dragon roll(? one of their signature rolls) + SASHIMI: Salmon tataki, omelette + ALL THE TORCHED SUSHI!!! + OTHERS: ika yaki, enoki roll, shrimp skewer"}
{"text":"Terrible terrible customer service and there food comes very slow. They constantly pressure you to finish your food and threaten you with charging extra. Very cheap people. Their manager, Steven, is very rude. He is not supportive at all and talked back to countless customers while I was there including me. They get your money and do not treat you right! You should never go there!"}
{"text":"This place is worth a try. Kaka used to be my no. 1 favourite AYCE place but I would say Kuu is on the same par and it even offers a better and more comfortable ambience, and a more decent food portion. The service was fast and food was absolutely great. We were given a Lindt chocolate on our way out too!! Probably because it's a Christmas Eve"}
{"text":"The torched salmon is perfection! Nothing like I have tasted before. I love the decor. It's warm and inviting. I would give 5 stars if they had better service. I had to ask for extra napkins and Ginger four times."}
{"text":"Came here due to yelp review and I was in the area Vaughan. Good atmosphere, good selection of AYCE and friendly staff. The only think I would change is that their specialty roll came in fairly big portion and when it's two people who want to try different things on the menu, it a little to much to share. Overall I would definitely recommend it over many of the AYCE sushi in the area."}
{"text":"FOOD I'd definitely go back again. Food tasted fresh, had unique dishes where you can't get at any other sushi restaurants. You order food through a tablet and food comes at a reasonable time.    PARKING Not too much parking available on a weekend. We were lucky to find one close by.   PARENTS W/ INFANTS OR TODDLERS On a weekend it is might packed. You won't be able to fit a stroller in as the restaurant isn't that big. You can however bring the infant car seat in if anything! The change table is only available at their handicap bathroom. The bathroom is huge and plenty of room for you to change comfortably. There is a hook on the door for you to hang but it's fair few feet to get to from the change table. The women and men's washroom does not have change tables."}
{"text":"Food is ok for buffet. what really ticks me off is that bigger parties have priority and gets seated first.  I saw other people walk in, grab a number and seated first when we've been waiting for 20 mins.  Totally treated unfairly.  comes to mind how many $ per table brings rather than customer service"}
{"text":"I came here Friday evening for dinner with a group of coworkers (roughly 16 people). We booked for 7pm, but our table was not ready as the place was really busy.  Once seated we ordered through their tablet ordering system and then went to grab the salads and soups that they had at a self serve station which I thought was good. We didnt have to wait to eat.   The orders came out quickly and the sashimi was good for an ayce place. We made quite a few orders and they never delayed the food coming out like what many ayce places do. However they gave us 2 tablets as we were in a large group; told us it was so they would know which end to bring the food to, but all the food ended up coming to one side of the table.  Overall I enjoyed the food here and would return.  *Almost forgot, but like many previous reviews about the soft served ice cream, their ice cream still has the bits of milk pieces in it. I didn't try it myself but my coworker had it and were fine with eatting it that way."}
{"text":"This was my first time going to Kuu after a friend recommended it, read some reviews on it and figured I would give it a try. I'm usually very hesitant on trying out new sushi restaurants as I never like to gamble with food poisoning. Upon arrival they had a table ready for us which was great, we went on a Thursday for lunch! The service was amazing, the food was ready in ample time and was super fresh!   I was surprised because some restaurants I've been to with quick service taste re-heated or stale. Not Kuu, it tasted very good.   The decor was nice though not something very important as the food is what really matters.   Their salad bar was less than great, so I didn't really use it.  A really nice touch was the self-serve ice cream machine! It was super fun and the soft serve was pretty good.   A little pricy for lunch though $20.90 after tax, for the same quick service, and freshness level. There are less expensive restaurants."}
{"text":"We came after 3pm on sat. The food is just OK.  But the service is awful. The food was served after one hour and twenty minutes!!!! The place was almost empty. No way I will come here again"}
{"text":"It's not everyday you can come across an AYCE sushi restaurant that excels in quality, but I think I've finally found the place. Being from the Markham area, this is a relative comparison to Kaka in terms of the quality and selection of different sushi.   A few things I found odd/out of place: there's an open buffet where you can get cocktail shrimp, mussels, soups, salads, and desserts. It got me a little confused as to whether it was an AYCE or buffet-style restaurant. Of course, if you think about it - they were being creative in the fact that you can get as much as you want without bothering the servers too much. Creative, but not entirely necessary imo.  Secondly, I found it odd how they had such a wide variation of Asian foods on their menu. What I mean by this is that they have a random range of Thai food that you can order, as well as Chinese food. Also slightly unnecessary for a sushi place. Of course, at the same time they still had a wide variation of sushi!   But daaaaamn. The fish was hella fresh! Everything my boyfriend and I ordered tasted amazing - we got a bunch of things: beef tataki (our fav), torched sushi, the volcano roll, Kuu roll (their speciality)... just to name a few! For the weekend, the price is $28.99 per person before tax and tips. We also went when it was CNY but waited for only around 20 mins for two people. Definitely recommend this place for the sushi!"}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this AYCE sushi restaurant. My boyfriend and I have gone to so many AYCE sushi locations, and I must say, this place is one of our favourites.   Decor is absolutely amazing. We were also amazed by the utensils/cutlery since it was pretty fancy for an AYCE sushi restaurant. Food comes out fast, even during the busy lunch rush, and they are very giving with portions (even the sushi!). They have a whole bunch of selections, and many that we have never seen at the other sushi restaurants we've ever been to, which is why we absolutely love this place. Servers are friendly, and great at checking in on you. Price is reasonable and around the same price as other AYCE sushi restaurants.  Only a few complaints: this place is pretty small. I noticed that half of the restaurant wasn't being seated, which led to customers waiting for a table to free up. Also, the salad bar and desert bar is decent. They only have a few selection, and there's nothing really special about it. You might as well order other appetizers or soup that's on the ipad. As for the desert, either I missed it on the menu, or they just don't have it? But I really wanted some deep fried pudding with my ice cream...oh well, still a happy customer!  We will definitely be back as regulars!"}
{"text":"The food was OK. The place is spacious and nice. The service isn't so great, specially if you order off the menu. Staff is nice though. Oh, and they charge for green tea (even if you get all you can eat)!"}
{"text":"Initially thought it would be great because the place itself is beautiful. Greeter was very polite too.  iPad menu did not have pictures, which I was going to forgive because they are a new place.  The options were terrible, they didn't even have basics like green or red dragon. The sushi I did order was all too moist. The iPads were annoying to use because a server had to sign in to let you continue ordering after an order was placed. The price was also higher than other places for lunch time.   The ultimate failure was we were told we cannot order after 3 pm (we arrived at 2:15) because technically it's past lunch. Then, a mother and toddler came in and were told to leave because it was not lunch anymore nor dinner yet. That is the worst customer service ever."}
{"text":"This doesn't even need a TL;DR just don't go here lol. The fish was so bad that it made the table beside us say \"the more I eat this sushi the more sick I feel\" RED FLAG ALERT.  The cooked dishes were okay, didn't feel a gut wrenching churn, but once we started eating the raw fish, me and my fiancee were in and out of the washroom like alright.   The only thing that kept mostly me there was the all you can eat self serve watermelon because what do you lose when you repeatedly throw up? Hydration! Thank god becuase I had about a whole watermelon and like 30 orders of the deep fried custard. It was dessert heaven.   For the steep price of I think $30. It wasn't worth it because a whole watermelon is like... $5 and you can make a shit ton of custard at home for like... another $5. I mean that's of course you don't pay for electricity or gas to make your deep fried delicacies LOL.  And the soft serve machine wasn't even soft serve. It was like, melting chunks of, icecream powder and milk and a whole lot of sugar. I'd rather just go buy like 3 icecream cones at an icecream truck because they know what they're doing for $8 (including that yummy chocolate dip and crushed peanuts).   Just like, don't come here. Unless you like throwing up."}
{"text":"I came here with my family and wasn't really impressed. I'm both lactose and gluten intolerant so my meal choices were limited on their AyCE menu. I was able to eat some of the sashimi and some other items that were plain.  The sashimi was definitely not fresh. I had to spit out a few pieces. Most of the salmon was chewy and it did not melt in my mouth. As someone who predominately eats sashimi at Japanese restaurants, I know when it is fresh and theirs was not fresh in any way shape or form. Some of the white fish tasted like it was previously frozen. The texture was off and it tasted pretty gross in my mouth.   I'm assuming their sushi rolls with add-ons like tempura, mayo and soya sauce must be better than what I received and the ingredients cover up the freshness of the fish.  I would not make this my top pick in Thornhill. I'll keep looking for a better sushi restaurant with fresh sashimi."}
{"text":"Very clean with great service however the price is slightly above average. Portions are average but definitely more flavourful than the average sushi restaurants. Servers were friendly, helpful with suggestions, efficient and quick and came to check up regularly to clear the table and see if we needed anything else. Food was also prepared and came out faster than the usual sushi restaurants. Will definitely come back if I am in the area and craving sushi."}
{"text":"Love this place! Not as pricy as I thought but the quality was way better than I expected!   They have salad bar set up where you can get a variety of salads and desserts. Their signature rolls are sooo good. Kuu sushi is a must-have. Mustard roll was yum too, with the torched salmon on the top. That mango roll was also great.  For the regular rolls, had crunchy spicy salmon and yam rolls. Both were yummm. I like the way they made rice, moist and soft, exactly my type.  The service was nice and quick, not like other places where ppl act like we owe them money.   I would definitely come again."}
{"text":"Excellent selection and decent quality for AYCE. I made the trek out here after I saw a glowing review of this place, and I can definitely see the appeal. On prime time Friday night we got seated immediately, which was great. The open food bar with peel and eat shrimp and soft serve ice cream machine is a definite highlight. The only items I didn't like were the signature sushi rolls. They all tasted fishy, and not in a good way (even the spicy avocado roll :/). But the regular sushi and sashimi was quite good, and the torched steak sushi was a very delicious and unique item. Some of the hot food portions (like fried rice) are quite large, so be prepared! I did not correctly anticipate the size and wasn't able to finish it all, but thankfully they didn't charge us for leaving some food behind.   Their iPad system seems quite good, and waiters don't need to verify the order - it just goes straight through to the kitchen. The food came fast and the service was good. The only issue is that there is no alcohol menu - I wanted a beer, but by the time I got situation and figured out the system, the moment had sort of passed. But definitely one of the better AYCE places out there!"}
{"text":"Solid ayce...good value for your money. We've been here many times. We like their torched sushi and tataki. Dinner is when we go since they serve sashimi. We also like the garlic steak, salmon belly, shrimp in skewers, cheese wonton, japanese fried rice. Their tempura batter is quite heavy. I also found the fried custard weird. But overall good ayce...one of our go to's."}
{"text":"Not really into all AYCE places but I don't mind Kuu at all. The interior of the place looks very modern and clean. The food is pretty good for an AYCE place. Orders usually come out pretty quick (even when it's busy) and servers are attentive.  Every table has an iPad for ordering -- they have a huge selection on the menu. They also have a soft serve ice-cream machine if regular ice-cream doesn't do it for you.  I see a few reviews that mention their price -- it is a few bucks more than other places but I think it's worth it! As of right now, this is my favourite place for AYCE sushi."}
{"text":"Love going here, always go for the ayce and it never disappoints. I like that they have a salad bar even though its small it does the job. Their menu is really good they even have roti and lamb curry!"}
{"text":"Relatively new, this resto is mainly AYCE which we don't usually like as quality is usually sacrificed for quantity. We asked for a la carte menus and were handed a bunch of ratty papers, they really should get proper menus! Service was surprisingly quick and portions were small. Basically the same as the AYCE servings so I think its a better value to do the AYCE because we ended up ordering more than usual due to small serving size. Sashimi was fresh and delicious. Curry and roti were yummy as well. Definitely a great addition to the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Typical AYCE in Thornhill, but with a heftier price tag.    Came to Kuu for an early Sunday evening dinner.  The ambiance is cool and the decor is great.  Upon entry, there's a salad and soup bar-- you can help yourself to as much or as little as you want.  Touches of modern dining-  each table receives an iPad and orders off of a digital menu that's sent directly to the kitchen.  Service is too slow-- it took a while to get everything we ordered (and some stuff we didn't).  Food was just alright.. what can you really expect from an AYCE?"}
{"text":"ATTENTION EVERYONE, SCAM they said only $17.99 on SUNDAY but when I came there it's $20.99,  SCAM SCAM, FALSE ADVERTISED  Ordered dynamite sushi roll, it came with no avocado, replaced with cucumber inside, wHen I asked the server, he said \"the pics on the tablet was ONLY for REFERENCE\" FALSE ADVERTISED, SCAM  Eveything advertised there was only for REFERENCE Baddd service  I rather come to sushi 168 instead, better server better food   DO NOT COME THERE TO EAT"}
{"text":"I was recommended Kuu Sushi and after I read the reviews, I had to give it a try!  I was pretty impressed!  Kuu has a lot of things that aren't part of your typical Japanese AYCE that I found pretty cool.  They have a small buffet area with a salad bar, soup, ice cream, soft serve ice cream (which was amazing!), fruit and a couple desserts, and cold shrimp and mussels.  The highlights were the shrimp and soft serve ice cream!  The shrimp was peeled and fairly big, I had a plate full of them!  The chocolate soft serve ice cream was really good.  It has tiny bits of chocolate in it and was probably some of the best soft serve ice cream I've had.  The service was very quick.  From clearing plates, to asking if I wanted drink refills, to quickly bringing out the food, I was really impressed with them.  They seemed a bit rushed at times but the restaurant was very busy so it was understandable.  All my orders were also exactly correct, which unfortunately seems to be rare for AYCE restaurants.  The decor was modern and very clean but my area felt a bit too cramped.  The table next to me was about an arms-length away.  They have booth areas where I wish I was seated instead.  I like that Kuu tries to have something for everyone.  Aside from the food I mentioned earlier, they also have a bunch of other items that aren't typical of your standard Japanese AYCE: french fries, onion rings, Thai noodles and curries, roti, and more.  I also like that they have descriptions for all of their sushi rolls so you know what's in them and what to expect.  My biggest gripe with Japanese restaurants is that they make up sushi rolls and don't tell you what's in them.  While I wish Kuu had a wider variety of rolls that don't have torched salmon or cream cheese (stick to the basics!), I like that I know what I'm getting by reading the descriptions.  While some of their food is hit and miss, overall I really enjoyed Kuu Sushi!  I'm definitely going to be going back and bringing everyone I know!"}
{"text":"Torched sushi and tablet ordering seems like all the rage these days. This is what distinguishes this place from the neighboring AYCE sushi places. The next place with Torched sushi would probably be 10km away. Honestly it's nothing to go crazy about. Might be nice the first time but it doesn't fundamentally change the AYCE experience.   There's nothing else that stands out from their menu. All your typical things can be found here.Nothing struck me as incredible or terrible. Everything is more or less average. So it gets an average score.  The only note worthy thing I will add is that we came as a group of 2. We saw lots of empty tables yet people were not seated quickly. I don't understand the wait...did you have problems with tablets or something? With people waiting by the door, it seemed logical to get people seated so they can start eating. Nope...I don't understand the front wait staff. If they didn't want a group of 2 to take a big table, I understand. But there were other larger groups waiting too...Anyways...not a big deal. Still giving it my standard 3 star."}
{"text":"$28.99/person on a Sunday. Hot water/tea is additional cost... which I did not like.  This is an OK AYCE restaurant. The quality is not bad in terms of AYCE standards. Beef tataki was a good dish - the flavour was slightly different than other places I've been to. Their torched and pressed sushi were better than a few other places I went to.   They have a salad and dessert bar that is close to the front of the restaurant. Very cool to have a soft serve machine you can use yourself!  Decent variety of food on the menu (lots of curry and thai dishes too). The food comes relatively fast and most of our dishes came to our table. Decent service since it was iPad ordering system. Side note, their iPads battery are not great/ they did not charge them as we had to change ours 3 times.  Overall - not bad AYCE option"}
{"text":"I came here with my dad earlier this week, Wanted to try out a new place & I always pass by this place.  must say it was a pretty good choice to try.  To start, very important, they have great service. Food comes out crazy fast, which was a bit of an issue cause we didnt have enough time to finish what we had to make room on the table for what they were bringing lol.  The quality of the food was great.   One thing I was confused and a little disappointed about was the fact that they had no dynamite rolls, how do you not have dynamite rolls....... Theyre my dads favourite, and about 90 % of the persian community. haha . But it was made up to my dad with the black dragon roll and the appetizers.  they also had no edamame.. which is also wierd. But I guess theyre 'different' ?  Salad bar was crap though. There was a pretty large variety of food to choose from so no crazy complaints, I left full and satisfied.   Just a note, Prepare for higher prices than most. Dinner on a weeknight was $30 ..."}
{"text":"Overall, would probably be 4 stars, but, since I'm not a fan of either a buffet style self-service or the higher prices, it comes down to 3.  Otherwise, beautiful new restaurant with nice decor/atmosphere. Came for lunch when it wasn't particularly busy, but service was still a bit spotty.  I can't say there was anything particularly memorable about any of the menu items, other than it also offers green/red/yellow curry dishes, which is nice.  I wouldn't be against coming back if someone suggested doing so as a group, but I wouldn't choose this restaurant if it were up to me."}
{"text":"Food was good, waiter for hockey sushi works there, super nice guy  A little over priced for what you get but the quality was great and they have an great. Ice cream !"}
{"text":"I am very familiarized with AYCE sushi and Kuu definitely fall short from many aspect.   Food - Sashimi is ok fresh, except the saba, which was very mushy and falling apart. Fried items (eg. tempura and chicken wings) are not bad. However, most hot items are mediocre warm when they arrived. They have a ice cream machine which many kids enjoy it. A good place for family gatherings with kids.  Service - The servers know nothing about alcohol drink menu. When we ask our 1st server, she said \"only soft drinks are available\". When we asked our 2nd server, she said, 'yes we have beer', and we ask for a drink menu, she said there's no drink menu. We ordered a 220ml sake and it costs $11.99, very expensive compare to other places.   My partner and I haven't ate anything raw except the sashimi and we both have diarrhea afterwards. Mind you, we are from Asia and have relatively strong stomach and not easy having diarrhea. Ruined our night :("}
{"text":"This place is just awful.  The food, the service, the attitude of the staff.    Lack of customer respect.   Etc etc etc.  After spilling sauce all over my shirt, the manager offered us a 10% discount.   Lol.   If I wasn't in a hurry to leave, I'd raise a fuss, I choose not to come back to this place instead."}
{"text":"We've been to Kuu a few times and enjoy their selection. For an AYCE place, the food and service have been generally good.  However, on our last visit, we got there and were told the wait was 20 minute which we were fine with. However, after sitting there for 45 minutes, we had not been seated yet. This normally wouldn't be a big problem, except that the owner (?) was talking to his staff in Chinese thinking we could not understand/hear. He was basically prioritizing the larger tables despite the queue that was forming in the front. After waiting 45 minutes, all the tables of 2-4 people were still waiting whereas all the larger groups who had come in later had been seated. Normally, I would give them the benefit of the doubt except that we actually heard this straight from the owner's mouth! We had asked them a couple times how much longer we had to wait and why others were being seated before us and they just kept making excuses. We ended up just walking out after hearing the owner say that because it was clear our business wasn't important to them. The worst part was they had a large table at the back that had been empty for the whole time we were there. I assumed it was a reservation but considering it had been empty for so long, they could have easily broken it up and seated all the people who were waiting."}
{"text":"We came for the first time to Kuu for my mom's birthday. I've been to pretty much almost all you can eat Japanese restaurants. I am very pleased with the overall quality and variety, especially with their cooked food. The red Thai curry with fish and green thai curry was comparable with Thai restaurants. I like it how they have a side salad and soup bar where you can get up and get your own cocktail shrimps, wonton and soup. It's a good break from just sitting all night and not getting up, it divides the all you can eat experience.  The wonton were tasty too. My picky birthday mom kept going back to refill. We ordered the Kuu roll that consists of: shrimp tempura, mixed crab and cream cheese, rolled with torched Talapia, fish egg, green onion, served with Kabayaki sauce and spicy mayo. Everything went pretty well together! I've also enjoyed the pressed shrimp aburi sushi. I really enjoyed  the Kuu Vermicelli, it was delicious with baby scallops and shrimps, definitely comparable to the authentic Chinese restaurant.  Overall, the food, both cold and hot were good and I recommend for those of you who haven't ventured out to this relatively new Japanese  all you can eat!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. Wide food selection. And the wait staff are very patient, attentive and helpful."}
{"text":"I am sorry to write a poor review. I didn't come here. I just want to write about my experience contacting them this week.   I phoned within the business hour and was told the voice mail of the person I was trying to reach was not initiated. I phoned 3 or 4 times with the same result. On the 5th try I finally got through, the person on the other line asked me to hold. I waited. They didn't put me on hold with background music indicating I am waiting, but instead I listened to 20 minues or so of argument about reservation and number of people (between the front desk staff and patrons). They seemed to have forgotten that someone was waiting on the phone. I kept saying hello and there was no answer. Finally I couldn't be bothered and hung up.   It's a shame because this looks like a good restaurant but if the way they handle phone calls is any indication of their customer service I would be wary to come here."}
{"text":"This is the best AYCE sushi place I've personally been to (so far!). Anytime I'm craving sushi there is no hesitation to come here. Their sashimi is fresh, nigiri and maki rolls are delicious, and other apps are amazing as well. Would definitely recommend the salmon and beef tataki, really delicious and plated nicely. I'm all for aesthetically pleasing plating. The only thing they're missing here is the green dragon roll - which I usually love to try at every sushi restaurant. The concept of the salad/soup/ice cream bar is great, and I love that they have an ice cream machine for the twist. Overall, always a great experience here. Servers are always attentive and nice."}
{"text":"Kuu Sushi is one of the first sushi places I've been to in Vaughan and it really did not disappoint.   On a Wednesday night around 7pm I still had to wait about 15 mins for a table that was empty..... That I was confused by because I saw the table and had to wait then was seated when it was cleaned and prepped the whole time.   ANYWAYS, the seats we're very close to each other to the point that I can hear the table's beside me conversation. I had some trouble going in and out to their buffet bar because only one person can go down the aisle at a time.   The buffet bar had shrimp, mussels, salad, and fruits. I got some shrimp because I thought it was cool and I liked the fact that it was prepeeled for me.   The actual sushi menu at Kuu has a huge selection of stuff from rolls, sashimi, curry, to roti. My partner got one roll that I do not remember the name of but it was deep fried with cream cheese and artificial crab meat and it was soooo good. The sashimi tasted fresh and soft. I would recommend getting the pad Thai too, this is something I don't often get at sushi restaurants but my partner wanted Thai food but I wanted sushi (clearly I won) so we ended up getting Thai food with low expectations. But the pad Thai was realllllyyy good. I don't recommend the curry though. For dessert we ended up just going for the soft service ice cream and I think this was our favourite thing because the chocolate ice cream had little bits of chocolate in it  I really wished they had this in ice cream trucks because we ended up not using a cone but instead put the ice cream on a plate. I wanted fruits too but by the time I got there, there was only one piece of watermelon left when I saw a huge array of fruits when I first started my meal so it'd be nice if they constantly refilled the buffet bar. Overall, with its huge selection of food, it was really delicious.   The service of this place is a little iffy. We ran out of water and placed our cups at the edge of the table and no one filled it up for a good 20 minutes until we asked when our next round of food came. Maybe because our seat was in the corner of the restaurant, they didn't come by to take the plates from our table too. The tables are very small so I'd expect them to do frequent clearings so we can eat comfortably but we ended up stacking plates on top of each other just to get more space.   I give Kuu a 3/5 because service isn't that amazing and the privacy is very minimal, but for the price even though it's on the higher side, it's worth it because of all the dishes they have to offer."}
{"text":"The food was crap and portions were bad and forced us too sit in a bad seat even thought there were lots of better ones , and made us throw up ."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, as the interior is very welcoming, the seating is comfortable and the tablets with an app for ordering the food are very convenient.   The problem is that the food is blah, the fish is low quality, the soft serve ice cream is just sugar with something in it - the list goes on and on.   I would have rated the place one star higher, if not for the price - they cost almost as much as Mandarin, on the weekends, so the value for money is definitely not there.   Won't repeat if I don't have to."}
{"text":"The price was totally worth it. My boyfriend and I tried almost 25 dishes and expect for one or two every dish was flavourful.  I am not a fan of wonton, however the cheese wonton is a must try and the kuu sushi as well."}
{"text":"We were looking for an AYCE near Promenade and I remembered this recommendation from a Facebook group. The sushi and sashimi is fresh and love that they have pressed and torched sushi. There is a large selection that you can choose from their tablet. Didn't have a chance to try their cooked foods such as pad Thai etc. Definitely coming back here. We came here with our 8 month old,so they do have high chairs and booster seats."}
{"text":"Rating: 2.5  I went here with a few of my friends for my birthday dinner and it was a meh experience.   The food tasted alright. Pretty fresh, pretty flavourful. I just felt like for a place that is charging people like 30.99 for dinner, I expected there to be more options on the menu? I felt that it was pretty limited tbh. There weren't a whole lot of interesting things to choose from either. It was pretty standard and lame ngl. No ramen? HOW?! And OMg. If you wanted like a drink like pop, you still have to pay like $2.5...... like ?!?! Um... how about no?! LOOL ITS 30.99 HOW AND WHY DO WE NEED TO PAY ANYMORE. I find that pretty atrocious. So I just got water.   Service wise, it's not too bad I guess. When I sent in my first order, the food came HELLA fast. After that, it literally took ages for the food to arrive like what happened? There weren't as many people as well so ?! The servers were meh too. I felt that some had a bit of attitude like okay girl. I also felt that they wanted to kick us out at one point. Just a bunch of flares and stares. How beautiful.   But yeah, I don't think I'll ever come back and oh yes. I don't even know why but their floors are so fking slippery ....... Like I legit almost slipped. I didn't know eating AYCE can be so dangerous."}
{"text":"Among the worst ayce I've ever attended and I base that statement mostly on the service. It was chaotic. I couldn't sit anywhere I wanted to but fortunately another hostess greeted me and seated me at a booth that even had an outlet so I could continue working on my laptop. I had to beg for a tablet menu (I got some ancient paper menu first and then a tablet) and that alone was a 6 min wait as I had to struggle to flag down somebody. I was always struggling to find somebody to ask for things that should just be naturally set up -  ginger, soy sauce, napkins, menu, top up water. Then just as I figured my plates stopped coming out I asked for the bill, went to go get a bit of ice cream and when I came back there were four veggie dishes on my table! Like how long does it take for veggie dishes - cmon. I refuse to cave in and pay for uneaten items so I tearfully finished the plates and threw back my water. There was only one server who was super friendly and thoughtful so I made sure that when it came time to pay I paid the bill and went directly to her to give her the tip. Not one single other person deserved it.   The food: couldn't eat the shrimp skewers... Tasted and smelled too old, too fishy, unappetizing texture. Sent it back. Salad bar is nice and fresh and I enjoyed adding ingredients to my miso soup and filling up on wakame and tomatoes. Sashimi was cut quite thin and not as great as I'd hoped for - wouldn't go back for Sashimi (poor presentation too). Chicken skewers are good but the unagi isn't something I'd go back for. Japanese light cheesecake and another light cake dessert were a nice treat and unique from other ayce I've been to.   Anyway, I wanted to try Kuu and there - I've tried it. I wouldn't go back though as Kuu charges $26.99 for dinner menu and $16.99 for lunch and hockey sushi just down the street beats those prices by at least four dollars. Also, at Hockey the menu has more variety and the service is more attentive perhaps because it's a smaller venue.  Tl:dr: Kuu = a fail. Too pricy and very poor service.   Tip: both hockey sushi and Kuu do not offer Sashimi for lunch. I guess this is the norm but I don't go for lunch often so didn't know. I'm pretty sure 168 offers though.   Tip: last call for lunch is 3pm.  Tip: Can accommodate large groups."}
{"text":"This place is decent.  Their torched sushi is great.  Excellent selection on the most part.  Too many stupid rolls.  Also they don't wast time for sending your order.  Order slowly.  If you send a bunch of items to your table they will all come fast.  But overall great place."}
{"text":"I had to take off a star because of the price. Other than that - it was great! This place probably has the fastest service ever. I think it took them less than 5 minutes to bring our 36 piece order to our table! That's the speed!! Almost everything we ordered I liked except maybe a few items (which is ok, considering we ordered half of their menu). Sushi and sashimi tasted very fresh which is important. Will come back for sure!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch after realizing that most of the AYCE sushi places near a 50 km radius from Kuu charge the same price on Friday's. Food arrived fast and had flavor. Table was cleared right away after each finished plate. Didn't care for the salad bar nor that they charged for tea as I decided to skip my morning Starbucks that day. Definitely will be back real soon."}
{"text":"It was new, clean & good environment. The food was good and I think its one of the best in this area."}
{"text":"Love the salad bar option, Unlimited mango salad sooo good. They have a different soup selection every time I go, and their dessert options change as well. Usually some kind of cakes.  I really love the broad menu selection, the Kuu sushi roll is absolutely delicious, the portions are really great as well. I come all the time!!"}
{"text":"Food was good at best. Service was minimal. It was impossible to flag a server down. I arrived between lunch and dinner and let me tell you this. Salad bar was not refilled. Soups were not refilled. When I brought this to the attention of the server she merely shrugged her shoulders - obviously, it wasn't her fault.   Floors are greasy and slippery.   The food though is fairly good. If the service was good I would have given this place a solid 4 stars. Unfortunately, it was absolute poop, which is unfortunate.   3 stars. There are much better sushi places for equal or less prices."}
{"text":"Excellent choice of sushi and other Japanese style foods. All you can eat menu on iPad that works very effectively. Prompt service to bring the order out and to clean the dirty dishes from the table. Overall very positive impression of good food quality and excellent service. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"My wife and I are major sushi addicts. We've been to a ton of different all-you-can-eat places but nothing comes remotely close to this one. The service here is impeccable, the decor is very tasteful, and the quality of food is absolutely phenomenal. They really do leave all their competition in the dust. The only downside is it's relatively pricier than other places, though still very much on par with what they offer. I don't think we'll ever go to another all-you-can-eat again."}
{"text":"Ordered take out.....a variety of veg rolls and shrimp rolls plus raw fish. Very filling and everyone was happy with the variety and choice"}
{"text":"They have an icecream machine that's pretty legit and a seafood/salad bar that's buffet style. But apart from that it's nothing special in my opinion. The selection of food is the same as many other places and their desserts were kinda disappointing... They didn't even have the default mango yogurt.. :("}
{"text":"This is my third or fourth time here, and I have been here for both lunch and dinner. For an ayce, they are pretty attentive, food comes out quick and they have a small appetizer/dessert bar when you first enter.  It's a bit on the pricier side ($26.99 dinner weeknight), but you do get what you pay for here.  Their menu is quite extensive (they have red/green/golden curry combination dishes), and a lot of different fried rice.  They have some torched and pressed sushi, and some interesting appetizers. I recommend trying the eggplant sashimi pizza (appetizer). The eggplant is fried tempura style, with spicy salmon and and avocado on top.  They also have variety of skewers (chicken, beef, shrimp etc)  Food, service and ambiance wise a pretty nice sushi AYCE."}
{"text":"My wife was craving for torch sushi, so we decide to come here to try.  The restaurant is big with lots of seats.  We didn't have to wait long to get a seat.  The interior design looks very modern.  We ordered a lot of food in our first round. Torch sushi, sashimi, rolls, beef ribs, beef rolls, beef and egg with rice, etc.  All the food is tasty except the beef and egg with rice which we find a bit salty (too much sauce).  They also serve soft ice cream on a cone.  Service was good and our order was submitted through iPad.  The price is not cheap as we went on a Saturday night.  Expect $40 a person after tax and tips.  Weeknight would be cheaper."}
{"text":"My new favourite Ayce sushi. I used to frequent Matsuda and Kyoto quite a lot and still do, however after finding this gem which is closer to home, I was in love. The appetizers, torched sushi series and tatakis won my heart.  I highly recommend you to try that along with the delicious unagi roll AND garlic bok choy. It is SO GOOD and worth a visit."}
{"text":"The positives about this place is it new and has a cool deco, with a faster and more efficient way of ordering AYCE using iPods.   The food is decent with most of it tasting like a la carte, not like most AYCE loading up all the sushi with tons of rice to fill you up. If your a mango lover... Its the right place for you. Most of the sweet rolls include mango, also the salad and desert stations include mango salad and mango everything deserts. ** the station allows you to have a few bites before you wait to get your food**   Some things to improve on for the place in my opinion is finish uploading all the pictures on the iPads. Dim the lights a bite to get more atmosphere. Faster delivery times could be   All in all slightly better then average place then most but the price point is higher due to - iPods and app stations   Cheers"}
{"text":"Came here for AYCE eat dinner which was about $30+/PP after tip, tax. Sushi was good but not the best.    Favourite item to order was the deep fried custard. It was so crispy on the outside, creamy and smooth on the inside. We ordered about 5 plates and there was no sharing. Bonus was the self serve salad bar! Great if you don't want to wait for all of the main food to come out   Overall, great service and decor! 4 stars because I think $27 for AYCE on a weekday is pretty pricey as the sushi was not the best."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on the weekend since it was a bit cheaper than dinner. Mostly just came here for the aburi sushi ( seared sushi). Heard good things from Yelp and other people who had tried this place out. Wanted to try something different aside from going to Kaka.   Since there aren't that many torched sushi AYCE places in the area people say this place does it right! Even though I wasn't able to experience this places full menu, their lunch menu is decent and has a good variety of items on there. There no sashimi for lunch which isn't uncommon at most AYCE if you go for lunch.   They have more limited quantity of rolls and some cooked items but that's ok. The torched sushi is what matters the most =)  The torched sushi is pretty good in comparison to other places. I feel like the sushi at this place is made with more 'quality' as its prepared better. (e.g once you grab it with your chopsticks it doesn't fall apart into millions of pieces).   For lunch they dont have much dessert.. They have an area where you can make your own ice cream cone, but there isn't much variety of flavors, only vanilla. They do have deep fried banana's on the menu but that's about it. Lunch is good for the value and price but need to come and try this out for dinner another time and see what's their menu like!"}
{"text":"Grabbed an early dinner here tonight. Service was excellent with food arriving quickly and plates cleared rapidly. The quality was higher than a typical AYCE but so too was the price tag.  I liked that items could be ordered individually - just about everything. The torched sushi and sashimi pieces were very small, but delicious.  I would go again if I was really hungry to make it worthwhile."}
{"text":"clean but extremely overpriced! The place is a rip off unless you are some kind of an oriental food gourmet. I know that they would tell me \"yes, fellow, our restaurant is not for someone like yourself, go suck ur d because we serve all these medical doctors that work nearby and these managers and executives that work in the oil and gas industry\".  That is true, I am not one of them. I am an honest working middle class American who cannot afford to pay $100 per person. But my point is that having paid this kind of money for the privilege to eat some kind of ikebana, you leave with an empty stomach. and as such, this place does not serve its purpose. It is simply an exhibition of carefully crafted pieces of Japanese culinary art. Basically, you are leaving with a feeling of being completely fooled like that simpleton in one of the streets of Bucharest that paid a 20 euros to a gypsy to tell him that he had a father and a mother.  Go and try yourselves! If gypsies have been outlawed in almost every state despite that they tell the truth sometimes, why would this establishment exist?  a luxurious diet club"}
{"text":"This AYCE sushi place is one of the better ones! The menu has an endless variety of sushi rolls, appetizers, noodles and dishes! No complaints about the items ordered for our group of 8 people. The soup and salad bar is a nice touch as well and a nice way to get a bit of a stretch while getting more food!  Decor is nice and modern with a red and black theme, as well as pretty chandeliers all around. The place was clean overall and nice ambience for a group dinner. Not too loud either compared to other AYCE places considering it was packed.  Staff are attentive and quick to bring ordered items despite the fact that it was busy around the holiday season. Give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Friday night AYCE, $28.99pp - doesn't include drinks, not even green tea..  Salad and dessert bar selection is small and cluttered.. Dining table is small and not enough room for the Samsung tablet, seems everyone else had the same problem..  Food came pretty slow, so the desert bar had line ups and also because the selection was small,   Sashimi and sushi selection was ordinary.. The rice on the nigiri were warm every time.. 2 stars  Tempura quality was buffet style.. Some (not all) of the kitchen items were like warm..  The garnish is a bit better then most AYCE, felt like other tables actually had legit garnish, we didn't.. Just plastic leaves..  On the positive side, The press sushi and blow torch sashimi was good and a must try if you're here (4 stars)  There signature rolls and signature Tamakis were good too (3 stars)  Overall the food was too sweet for our table's taste..  AYCE Food, price, service, decor Final rating, 2.8 stars   Forgot to add, no liquor for another 1 month or so.."}
{"text":"This is definitely one of my fave\"eat all you can\"restaurant.Food was delish and served in an appetizing manner!Servers are fast and nice.No wonder there's always a line up for diners."}
{"text":"I didn't have high expectations for this place. I heard it was good, but I've heard that before. They have a soft serve machine  Believe me when I say this place is good. It isn't cheap. But I definitely got my money's worth.  To be honest (and why wouldn't I be) they had be at the soft serve machine (you read that correctly). The staff were friendly and accommodating and they made sure we were taken care of. There isn't anything that I ate that I didn't like. I REALLY enjoyed the torched sashimi, well worth ordering a few if you get a chance. I could definitely order another 15-20 pieces on their own.  I do plan on going again and I hope it's just as good as this last time. It's hard to find an AYCE place that delivers regularly on the quality. Also, it's closer to my place but that more of a plus for men that those reading this review.  There is an a la carte menu but I didn't get a chance to look at it.  Did I mention the soft serve machine? I don't think I mentioned it enough........Soft serve machine"}
{"text":"AYCE sushi and this place has torched sushi as well. We came here for the dinner ayce on Wednesday. I will say that the torched sushi was very yummy. The sashimi, for the most part, was alright. Salmon and tilapia was fresh. The escolar was still frozen when it got to our table. And the saba/mackerel was not good at all...was rough in texture and also a bit frozen. The beef tataki and salmon tataki were underwhelming, both were slightly frozen.  I was not impressed by the fact that our orders came to our table very slow on a Wednesday evening. Especially the kitchen items. I asked a server about my missing fried rice and other kitchen stuff and he said it will come soon, but never checked up on it. We ordered our kitchen food at the beginning of our meal and close to the end of our meal it finally arrived. This is particularly bad as not everyone in my table wanted to eat sushi/sashimi.   Also, be sure to read the descriptions of each sushi carefully as I noticed a lot of these signature rolls they make are full of kamaboko (imitation crab) and deep fried bits. Another thing I noticed is that the servers did not want to remove plates that had remnants of food. They would only clear empty plates. Only at the end of our meal did they remove these plates."}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant with a friend. Once you enter there is a hostess that seats you. The decor is really nice, they have large Japanese themed painting on the walls.   This is an all you can eat sushi restaurant, weekdays are 26.99/ person. They use the typical ipad order system. You self select the items you want and send it in. The beverage menu on the iPad doesn't work. But all drinks are $2.50 and there's unlimited refills.   We ordered mostly sashimi and torched sushi. The sashimi is pretty fresh.  The torched rolls are okay. Not my favourite. There was one torched one I really liked though and it was the torched white tuna.   I also like salmon and beef carpaccio. But the tuna one was a little off. It was a little too cooked which gave it a weird texture.   The wonton soup is pretty good. The soup base is a little different the ones you get at other restaurants.   We also ordered one portion of beef rice. The beef rice portion was huge. At most ayce places one order means a small bowl. This one gives you a huge bowl, it's about 3 orders at a different ayce place.   They also charge you $1 for every piece you don't finish and they enforce it.   Besides the things you can order on the iPad, there is a open seafood bar where they have, shrimps and mussels. A soup section where you self scoop your own soups and toppings. They also have a selection of dessert there too. They have watermelon, brownies, cookies and etc. Also, they have an ice cream machine where you can serve your self your own ice cream. Which is really cool. But too bad the ice cream wasn't processed properly. There was chucks of vanilla and chocolate in there chocolate twist ice cream. On the other hand, if you do not like soft serve, they also have the typical hard ice creams that most Japanese restaurants serve. The matcha flavoured one, mango and other flavours.   As for service, some of the servers are really polite and nice but others are really rude (Asian server with the long hair in a ponytail).   Overall, the restaurant is off my typical route. So I would not go out of my way to eat here. The foods decent but you can find many other restaurants at this similar level."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. Close to home, I'm okay with the price. I just expected more? The food was good... nothing amazing. Their Yorksafe (health inspection) records have me apprehensive about returning. I would avoid in the future."}
{"text":"New sushi spot that opened up where Panera Bread used to be. Decided to check it out for lunch. $17.99 a person for AYCE lunch.   They had a soup, salad and dessert bar located near the entrance of the restaurant. It had a nice selection of soup. The salads were very basic and the dressing didn't have any labels on them. They have soft serve ice cream and scoop your own as well. They had very small selection of random other desserts too.  Ipad ordering, fast service and nice atmosphere. The food itself was okay. The cooked dishes - tempura, chicken cutlet, popcorn chicken - they all came out warm. Usually when we order things like that they are hot because they were freshly cooked. We also ordered a beef and broccoli dish that you can see the steam come out of so that was good. I orders a few different types of rolls (3pcs. per order - which I enjoyed since I was able to switch it up) The spicy salmon roll is waaaay different from any I had ever tried.. it was not for me today.   Overall it was okay, would I go back? Maybe just out of curiosity to see what dinner is like.."}
{"text":"Went to Kuu Sushi last week.  Atmosphere was great. Staff were so friendly and helpful.  Place very clean. Best of all, food was excellent.  Great things to order from computer.  Very nice salad bar and dessert bar.  Loved it."}
{"text":"Very Good Food, The Kuu Roll is AMAZING, basically that's what I order for myself till I'm close to blow up :)"}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong I have been here and have gotten take out on many occasions but today was by far the worst experience ever with the I got take out and honestly tasted like \"Mac Sushi\" would highly suggest they fix it or they would end up like that hockey place"}
{"text":"4.5 Stars   Kuu was AWESOME!! I've heard of this place before, but never ventured inside until now.   Went for dinner on a Saturday night, and I was thoroughly impressed. Called ahead to get my name on a list, so by the time I arrived I only had to wait 5 minutes.   Firstly, the decor was great. The chairs were especially cool - blue velvet wingback chairs - you feel like royalty in it!   After being seated, the waiter brought the tablet which you can place your order on. As my table was completing the order, I went to the buffet area and helped myself to some soup and salad. This was a great feature of the restaurant.   After a short while, the food came, and it was delicious. They have torched sushi here so that's a big plus for me. The sashimi and raw dishes (i.e. Salmon rose) were great too! Very fresh and great presentation.   Also ordered a couple of rolls, some rice dishes, teriyaki...everything was great.   And now dessert...the dessert is part of the buffet section and self serve...and they have a soft serve ice cream machine...it was unbelievable! The ice cream has tiny grains of chocolate in it, making for a very tasty soft serve treat.   In all, I was quite impressed by Kuu, and looking forward to visiting again soon!"}
{"text":"Really impressed when I dropped by yesterday for dinner - saw the reviews and heard the hype so definitely wanted to give this place a try!  When I first walked in I immediately saw the soup and salad bar (there were also boiled mussel and shrimp !!) & the dessert bar, my friend and I tripped out and had to Snapchat it ASAP LOL  Food came out really quickly and there were many options except there were no fried UDON noodles... I love fried UDON dishes at AYCE restaurants. I was a little disappointed but the other food made up for it. Sashimi was super fresh, and the spicy salmon rolls were amazing!! You definitely have to try the beef tataki too! What surprised me was that they offer torched and pressed sushi on their menu too! Kuu sushi is like the KAKA All you can eat in Vaughn LOL  Service was okay, they don't really clear your plates until it is completely gone.. even when I stacked the finished plates on top of a plate that had 2 pieces of bitten kalbi, the servers took all the plates and left behind the kalbi plate LOL! Guess they didn't really get the message...   Overall, I definitely recommend this place! The food is really good and unique compared to many sushi restaurants. The price was okay - $28.99 per guest on a weekend but I expected it since they do offer the torched and pressed sushi. Only complaints I really have is the servers not clearing the tables properly and not offering fried UDON! However very minor issues, will definitely be back with more friends!!"}
{"text":"Came here last night for a birthday dinner party and the place was very accommodating. We had 4 tables in the back for a huge gathering. We were able to fit two baby strollers against the wall.  We had two servers watching over our 4 tables and each table had their own IPAD to order off of. The food came quickly and the servers were amazing, grabbing drinks, refilling our drinks, grabbing ginger and napkins. They were so patient with us and great.   This place also had an appetizer stand with cold shrimp and mussels which was amazing! Not your average dinky little shrimp cocktails but they were huge. They had four different types of soup, your standard seaweed and crab salad with other salads. They had different types of salads and dressings. There was also desserts and ice cream at the station.   Some of the faves that we kept ordering was the beef and salmon takashi, octopus balls (SO DELICIOUS!), the black dynamite rolls was amazing, the cheese and crab wonton was good too. I loved the bok choy in garlic sauce and their specialty rolls are pretty amazing. The fried potatoe croquette was yummy but cold.. would have tasted better if it was hot.   The okay dishes were the mussels, that is NOT cheese, that is all mayo.. If that is your thing you will definitely enjoy this. The general tao was okay. The spicy salmon torched sushi was alright. It kind of tasted like a spicy salmon cake smothered in sauce.   I wish we didn't order too much because we got super full fast and couldn't order more. Next time, we will definitely pace ourselves and try other things like the curries and the noodle soups!   Do come here, it is a bit pricy during the weekdays 28.99 for dinner on a Wednesday but honestly it was worth it. The servers were great, the food was amazing and the sushi was super fresh!"}
{"text":"First time going here and I thought it was alright, great location and somewhat busy.  Food: Food was okay, very generic AYCE sushi. Ordered from an iPad which is always nice, but found it different that soup, some salads and deserts (ice cream, brownies) where on a table near the entrance. Wasn't really a fan of this but hey food is food.  Service: Good, very friendly and we were seated pretty quickly. Some of our orders didn't come but I guess that happens to all sushi restaurants.   Overall: Probably would come back again, decent food, decent service and its near by!"}
{"text":"Food was decent but sushi was typical sliver of fish on a riceball that can be expected from an all-you-can-eat. Service was friendly and prompt even on a busy night. The soft ice cream machine was good for the kids though."}
{"text":"One of the best AYCE sushi restaurants that I've been to.  The sushi was presented beautifully, and they didn't load up on the rice like many buffets do! Although some of the side items (curry, teriyaki) weren't out-of-this-world amazing, their sushi and nigiri more than made up for it. Even though the price point was higher than other restaurants in the area, their pressed sushi and torched sashimi make it worth it, and are a must-try!  They are lacking on the dessert options (who goes to an AYCE sushi restaurant for dessert anyway?), but they do have a soft serve machine that had one of the best soft serves that I've ever had.   Kuu is my new go-to spot for AYCE sushi!"}
{"text":"Wow, I've gone to soooo many AYCE sushi Joints, and this honestly the best AYCE sushi ever! Great quality food, fast service, staff are friendly and professional , atmosphere is amazing...  the menu options are phenomenal , I love that I can order with an IPAD! Mmmm the sushi, maki's and the red curry shrimp/beef, sour pineapple chicken ... ok I can go on lol we're AMAZING!! Mmmmmmm I wanna go again!  I love that there was a salad bar with mango salad and and AYCE ICE CREAM/ DESSERT BAR!!! KUU HANDS DOWN YOU GUYS ROCK #1"}
{"text":"Big selection and high quality AYCE! The price is appropriate for the vast menu they have, which is $20 for lunch. The service was quick and I like ordering on the ipad. Also, the washrooms were clean and I enjoyed the Japanese decor. I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"classy and sophisticated dining room. Excellent service with ipad menu. My go to sushi restaurant and highly highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Food: I would probably rate this place 4 or 5 stars. It's probably the best AYCE sushi place I've been to.  Why it's 3 stars: -The service was slow. Some items took well over 30 minutes. -Some of the food didn't even come. We ordered the sashimi multiple times, and we had to tell the server until it came. It seemed like it took longer for the items that cost more. -Because of the above reasons, we weren't sure what was going to come and what wasn't going to come. It felt like a surprise every time we ordered (which is not what you want at an AYCE restaurant lol). -They have soft serve!!! :D However, The icecream was super runny. -There was no toilet paper in the washroom the entire time I was there.  So even though I'm giving it 3 stars, I would probably visit this place again and reevaluate my review."}
{"text":"Nothing special about this all you can eat. Yes, its nice, modern and still kind of fresh, but the food and service are not. Most of the items were spicy even though it was not mentioned on the menu. Squid was rubber, torched sushi were massively covered with mayo (common!) and some other orange sauce. One of our orders didn't come out for about 40 minutes, I had to catch the waitress and ask her before it actually came out. Even though this place closes at 10, staff stopped caring about customers and started urgently cleaning the tables at 8:30. We wanted to finish up our dinner with desserts right before 9, but everything was simply gone! No mango pudding, no fruits, no pastries, just some left overs of ice cream. What a disappointment paying the same amount of money as other people, but getting much less. When we asked the server if they could restock desserts she said \"no more for tonight, next time\". Seriously? I don't think there will be a next time for me thats for sure. This is a typical place with asian \"standards\" of customer service."}
{"text":"I don't go to all you can eat sushi places often, but Kuu is one of my go-to's when I do (the other being Kaka).  Kuu Sushi is located in a large plaza close to Promenade Mall, with lots of parking spaces available. Their restaurant is pretty big and has lots of seating, so reservations aren't necessary for small groups. In terms of pricing, their dinner menu is a bit expensive but where I think they shine is their lunch menu. Most all you can eat sushi restaurants with torched sushi will only have it on the dinner menu, but Kuu actually has those options available to you during lunch! They are definitely on the pricier side of all you can eat lunches, but its still reasonably priced.  They have a salad soup and dessert bar in the middle of the restaurant so that you can browse desserts and get your own salad. The restaurant's decor is really nice despite it being an all you can eat joint. They have iPad menus which is becoming increasingly common, with a large variety of food to choose from. Their food is pretty good quality for an all you can eat sushi place, on par with Kaka sushi.  Their quality and torched sushi at lunch really sets them aside from the competition. It's only SLIGHTLY more expensive than some of the cheap options down the road, but the decor, quality, and variety is way better."}
{"text":"I've been going to this place since it opened in Vaughan. They have been really good for first year or so. Suddenly the flavour and taste all changed and it's not as good and fresh as before. I thought I give another go and went today but again disappointed... bland, not very fresh... all specialty rolls seemed to be pre-made so it was cold. (I had honey mustard and torch salmon sushi). Salmon skin roll the skin was not very crispy.   Food quality: NOT GOOD! They need to go back to how they used to make their food.   Service: it's alright  I love sushi and yes I'm Asian."}
{"text":"The menu option was amazing, friendly staffs and the food tasted really fresh and good. It's my first time here with my boyfriend. We even recommended to our friends and family to come check it out. AND their music choice is amazing, they play throwbacks!!! Reason why it's not a 5 star is because they didn't have much options for dessert... other than that we were very happy with the service."}
{"text":"DO NOT GO HERE! Worst customer service ever!! We had a reservation for a party of 5. First person arrives and is told that the rest of the party must come in order to be seated. A party of 5 come in shortly after and is given a table right away. Two more people in our party arrive and the hostess crosses off our reservation name and programs the iPad. She walks around the corner to see that there is no table available. She comes back and says we must wait for the whole party to arrive in order to be seated. Typically, restaurants will seat you with at least 50% of your party there. I ask to be seated only because we are not sure when the other two will arrive - at least we could order drinks and maybe some food. The hostess hesitated and asks when the other two will arrive. I tell her 10 minutes. By this time, she's constantly trying to figure out what to say to us as we can clearly see the restaurant is not full. She's making up all sorts of excuses. Suddenly, she goes to the manager and comes back and says we can be seated - without any explanation. I see the manager and ask what's up with all this bs and he begins with all this attitude and is extremely rude, not giving us much of an explanation. I don't understand how you can run a business and speak to your customers in such a disgusting way. I will never set foot in this place again!!"}
{"text":"This review is for weekend lunch. Tldr; a lot of things right, a few flaws from kitchen dishes 3.5/5. I'd put kuu pretty close to Kaka but not at the same level  Sat we came for an early mother's day lunch, it was 17.99. It was pretty packed but wasn't too crowded. We waited 10min. And were taken to a nice round table by the window. The chairs in this section of the resto were these blue armchairs. Very comfy.   As soon as you go in you can see the salad bar which has a nice array of salads and soups. They were pretty good quality. I really enjoyed their crab salad and mango salad. Miso soup abd wonton soups were flavourful too. So far so good.  We ordered a whole bunch of sushi and rolls. There was such a big variety, I loved it. The fish were generally fresh for an AYCE but the fish to rice ratio was average. My favourite rolls were the ones with torched fish, the kuu roll and dynamite roll, very flavourful. The staple rolls like the spicy salmon roll were all made well and tasted good.  My only criticism for this resto comes from their kitchen dishes.. we got the pineapple shrimp fried rice, curry fish, Cantonese chow mein, pad Thai, baked mussels. Chow mein was actually good. The rice, pad Thai, and curry were all underwhelming and lacked flavour(as if ingredients were mixed in a bowl and heated in 5 minutes).. very disappointing as they came in huge portions.. very different from their rolls(comes in 3 pcs) and beef orders(comes in small bowl) which came in small amounts so you can order to taste. Also, a lot of orders over use mayo. I'm not quite sure if that is a certain style of cooking but eating a tablespoon of mayo with a single mussel is not my thing.. if you stay clear of these certain food dishes.. you'll enjoy your time for sure. Loved the self-serve soft serve ice cream at the end mmmm."}
