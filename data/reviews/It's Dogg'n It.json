{"text":"We got in yesterday from Toronto and this was the only beer store we could find.  We bought a 12 pack of Stella. We found when we were back at the hotel that the box was actually opened on the side and taped shut.  They had removed 1 Stella bottle and replaced it with an old random wheat beer that had obviously been sitting awhile as it had sediment built up.   I don't know what the laws are here but that's tampering with food and beverage products.  If you buy here, check over the box to make sure it hasn't been open."}
{"text":"Decent craft beer collection. Prices are higher than I'm used to in Buffalo but that might be due to PA's ridiculous laws about where beer can be sold. Easy walking distance from the Hilton"}
{"text":"This place has decent collection of beers. Open till late night. Especially till 2:00AM on Friday, Saturday and 12:30 AM on weekdays."}
