{"text":"My in-laws live close by so I'm glad there is a good halal Hakka Chinese place now close to them. Went there with some friends who are visiting from out of town and decided to go here based on other reviews.   The location is hidden but I remember when Jaipur used to be here. The food was really good. We got chilli chicken, sweet n sour chicken, chilli tofu, shrimp chow mein and fried rice. The serving size were decent and had plenty of left overs.  Will definitely return"}
{"text":"Good food and very friendly service. We had the chili chicken, Hakka fried rice and corn soup, all very tasty and reasonably priced.  Our waitress was super nice and entertained our one-year old as the restaurant wasn't busy.   Recommended!"}
{"text":"My family and I made a split-second decision to eat here after an stressful appointment with an interior decorator. I was impressed by the amount of people inside as it seemed to be pretty full. We ordered the Hakka Chicken Chow Mein, the General Tao chicken with Rice, and the Manchurian Chicken Chow Mein.   My parents loved the Hakka Chicken Chow Mein and I have to admit it was delicious. I had the General Tao chicken with Rice as that's what I always get. I ordered the most spiciest one because I know its on the sweeter side. I really loved it, I'm actually really sad that it's so far from where I live because its hard to find good Hakka food around Caledon.  Lastly, the Manchurian Chicken Chow Mein was the family favourite. Even my sister, someone who hates spicy food, loved it. My family loves Machurian, it's one of our go-to foods, but we've never had Manchurian noodles before and it was actually a very present experience.   Overall, the food was amazing and it tasted and looked fresh. The prices were good and reasonable based on the quality of the food.   I would definitely visit again :).   P.S. Free Wifi !!"}
{"text":"We ordered the Singapore noodle , veggie pakora with eggplant added , and egg drop soup.  It was not bad. But not great."}
{"text":"Came for lunch and ordered the manchurian chicken special with soup and spring roll. There was sand in the food and couldn't finish the dish! Chicken was very soggy also. Too bad as the price was good and service was friendly."}
{"text":"Super good, best chili chicken I've tasted between highway 7 and 16th and possibly in Toronto. A little on the spicy side so if u can't handle spice, make sure to tell them mild..or just don't bite on the chili peppers.   Small place, but like a previous reviewer mentioned a gem. Usually Yelp reviews disappoint, but this one lived up. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Very good food with many options to choose from. We came here for dinner and the service was excellent. The shrimp pakoras are great here. The food is halal"}
{"text":"Dropped by for dinner after an appt in the area. Our second time here and we ordered the wonton soup, Thai basil chicken and mango salad with rice. The food was simple & delicious. We finished our meal with the fried banana & ice cream dessert to share...that just hit the spot! Thank you once again for the great food and warm and friendly service."}
{"text":"One of the best places to eat chinese/Indian chinese in this region. The Machurian fries are awesome. We also had some American chopsuey and spring rolls. Lots of quantity, excellent taste and not expensive at all. Simple place but the service and food is really great."}
{"text":"Ever since one of my favorite Hakka Joints closed down in Markham. I've been on a journey to look for some similar. To my surprise I found somewhere better! I've been going to Hakka 77 regularly for the last 2 years. Every visit has been welcoming and consistent. Service is fast and always with a smile. Everything is fresh and appetizing. My all time favorite is the Chili Chicken on steamed rice. Just the right amount of sauce, spice and aromatics. Great prices and portions. 5/5 and will continue visiting on a by weekly to weekly basis!"}
{"text":"Ordered the manchurian chicken dish, which comes with a bowl of rice. I thought the dish was pretty flavourful with a creeping hint of spiciness, as I was not expecting that at all. Then again, maybe I should have.   Overall, the ambiance was average, dress code - casual, the service was friendly, attentive and arrived promptly each time.   The food was also decently priced for the portions they gave out. Would recommend."}
{"text":"Lets start off by saying that this is a restaurant that has not only tasty food but  it comes with affordable pricing. The staff are so kind and very attentive to customers needs as well. I ordered Manchurian noodles and chilli chicken. Both were amazing and the noodles came in a big amount size that met the pricing.  I love how they have an all day menu. .its sets them  aside from other competitors. They have  great choices too.  I would highly recommend this place to not only people in the  city but if you are travelling, this friendly atmosphere will definitely settle in your budget."}
{"text":"Im sorry but Fredricks has nothing on this place. Food tastes better, less oil, bigger portions and very friendly staff. If you're feeding a group of people and want tasty food look no further, this place is the real deal."}
{"text":"Finally, a new hakka place closer to me. Wanted to come here for a while and finally ended up here with a big group of friends on a Saturday night after being turned away from several restaurants.   The interior is quite simple but clean. When I was there, the staff seemed a bit new and seemed to be still in training, therefore our ordering was bit slow and they forgotten one of our dishes. However, the boss came around and expedited our forgotten dish.   We ordered two hakka fried rice, beef and chicken. The proportions were quite big and filling and people were satisfied. To fill my veggie quota I ordered the stir fried green beans. It was quite good, and relatively well portioned and not too oily. I also ordered a cashew nut chicken because I didn't want anything fried. And it was exactly what I had wanted, a healthy portion of chicken and veggies with rice. I also tried a piece of their chili chicken and it was delish! Maybe another time when I have quota for eating fatty dishes.   Overall I thought the food was pretty good and seemed to be less oily than their F* competitor, which is quite alright with me. The employees were very nice and friendly. I do understand that they just opened and may need to work out a few kinks. I'm sure the next time I visit, the service will be smoother."}
{"text":"Hands down the best hakka food in Richmond Hill!  Food was amazing, not too greasy or salty... just right and the portions was ginormous; family run, owner was very courteous and tentative...you could also ask to customize the food to your taste; gotta try their chilli chicken, chicken pakora and the very authentic hakka noodle...2 thumbs up."}
{"text":"Huge portions for $6.95.  Lots of rice with the mains.   Overall worthwhile for cheap eats.   We got the chili chicken, general Tao chicken, basal chicken and sweet and sour garlic chicken.   I added $2 for stir fry noodles which were not that good."}
{"text":"Great little Hakka place in Richmond Hill. Many locals comes here for lunch and dinner. If you enjoy spicy homestyle cooking, give this place a try, you won't be disappointed! I love their chicken dishes!!"}
{"text":"Portions are small.  We came on a Friday night around 7pm and arrived to an empty restaurant.  It picked up a bit and started to fill up around 730. Th staff are very nice, seems family run. We ordered the chicken pakoras, crispy schezuan beef, crispy green beans, and Hakka fried rice. First came out the pakoras and they were good! They were crispy but I noticed that they were smaller than ones Ive had elsewhere and not spicy!! To be honest we got regular spice for all dishes thinking it would be a medium heat (my dinner mate can't take spice smh) and honestly it wasn't spicy at all! (again dinner mate begs to differ) as the other dishes came out I couldn't help but be a little disappointed at their size. The portions are half of what would have been served at Lin garden for the same price. The crispy beef wasn't crispy at all. I will say though,  the pieces of beef were more substantial that other places, but without the crisp and spice it's not the same. The green beans were also not crisp nor spicy. All in all,  I'd probably only come back for the pakoras if I was in the area, but there are other places that have good pakoras and great other dishes."}
{"text":"Craving Hakka Chinese? This is your place! People often use Fedricks as the benchmark when it comes to hakka, well this place will surely please those who do. The seating is very basic but being in an industrial area type location, that's what you get. Roomy yet bare.  The prices are slightly more than your average Hakka establishment but that being said, the portion sizes are on point.  I ordered the customary chicken pakoras and they definitely hit these out of the park! Adequate chicken pieces and just enough heat to please your discerning palate, a must have! Chilli chicken with gravy was slightly less heat than one would expect but I think you can ask them to adjust the heat with each order so go ahead and wow your tastebuds as you please.  The only disappointment was the ginger beef. Slightly chewy cut of meat and the ginger gave it almost a sweetness-sorry Fedricks got this one. Hakka noodles were generous and tasty, another comparable pleaser. So my lesson for tonight's meal? Don't order four dishes for two people unless you plan to have a lot for your doggy bag. I will be enjoying Hakka all day at home! Final verdict-they plan to obtain their LCBO status soon so enjoying my pakoras with an ice cold one will happen every time I crave those fritters. See you again Hakka 77 very soon!"}
{"text":"$7 meals all day? I'm in! The place is quite new, friendly service as well.  I ordered the chili chicken (obvs) and vegetable pakora with rice. The chicken pakoras were an appy and they were amazing. Would definitely go back for them alone. Good seasoning, crispy outside and soft inside.   The chili chicken was great. Out of the 7 Hakka places I've been to, this is the top 3. The vegetable pakoras is a bit different, smaller dumpling type things in sauce. It was also very good.   When you order the $7 meals you get to choose spring roll, pop or soup. I got the soup, it was corn and something. It wasn't memorable. Next time I'd go pop and just order the hot and sour soup as an app.   The service was a little slow in refilling our water (I know small gripe). This is a hard 4.5 rating. Would go back again and update the review. The value is wonderful!"}
{"text":"Pretty good place. Great price. Fast and amazing service. Food isn't the greatest but it's pretty good. I had the Chilli chicken which was good but not anything special."}
{"text":"Came into town with my girlfriend and thought we would try it out. Friendly staff greeted us right away and had us seated. Food was hot and fast out of the kitchen. Great selection and I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday late afternoon for a late lunch, and the place wasn't busy at all. There were only 2 other people eating aside from us.  Service was quick. The place is clean and neat. They even have free wi-fi!  Me and my fiance ordered Chili Chicken. Mine was mild and his was medium spiciness.  Only took about 10 minutes for the food to arrive. We took advantage of their all-day specials, and for $6.95 I think the price is fair for what you get. I got a Nestea with the combo, and I got charged an extra 50 cents for it. My fiance ordered root beer and there was no extra charge for that drink.  The mild one is pretty good, which is still a bit spicier than I expected. The Chili Chicken at Faley Restaurant is still better in my opinion, because I believe that has more flavor.   Food is average, but the service is great and the all-day specials are worth a try.  Review 63 of 100"}
{"text":"I got the chili chicken after reading all the good reviews here and I was left feeling a little disappointed. Wasn't much flavour. It is relatively cheap but food is just average. They only accept credit over $10, so bring cash/debit if you are getting the lunch special!"}
{"text":"Bought the chilli chicken with white rice lunch special.  Can't go wrong at this place.   Chicken, rice, spring roll and soda all for just $6.95.  The meal was delicious and perfectly seasoned.   If in in the area again I will go again."}
{"text":"Chili chicken and General Tao. That's all I gotta say . I used to go to this Hakka place by Milliken mills high school that was called Lee's wok, but unfortunately they closed down sometime this year.... Been searching for a duplicate restaurant... This is it!  my favourite Hakka place"}
{"text":"Another hidden gem in Markham and this place is REALLY hidden.  Tucked right in between two plazas within the same plaza where Marathon milk tea shop and Inaho Japanese restaurant are.  At first I thought this was a Hakka food place, but after stepping in, it's actually an Indian Chinese restaurant (or do they mean the same thing?!!).  Either way it doesn't matter because this place serve great food at VERY good prices!  They have a decent selection of Daily Specials which is around $6.99 before tax and it comes with rice and your choice of side, a spring roll and a soup or a drink.  On top of the very good prices, the food portion is HUGE, which is perfect for one person!  $6.99 with such large portion, you cannot go wrong.  A group of 3, we ordered the Green Curry Chicken Rice, Red Curry Chicken Rice and as per the owner's recommendation, Chili Chicken Rice and a plate of Pakoras to share.  The Green Curry Chicken was great, just about right in terms of spiciness and great curry flavour.  The Red Curry has very strong Coconut flavour which I was not a big fan off, but taste wise it is still very decent because of the great tasting chicken.  Chili Chicken is by far the best rice dish out of the three, great sauce with nicely fried chicken meat on rice!  White rice needs a lot of sauce and this was perfect!  The best of all is the Pakoras!!  I tried it at a friend's wedding last year and I enjoyed it, so when I noticed they serve them here, I order one plate as well.  It has around 10 Pakoras and they are fried to perfection!!!  Great spiciness, flavour and fried texture, the Chicken Pakoras was fried so well it tasted like Popeye's fried chicken!!  I really enjoyed my time here and highly recommend anyone to go here for a quick, cheap and decent meal!!"}
{"text":"This is not a bad place for Hakka food. It wasn't busy on a weeknight. The food came in decent portion but the sauce could have been a little bit more flavourful. It was a little too bland for my taste. But considering the price it wasn't bad. The staff was friendly and helpful. I would visit again to try other dishes."}
{"text":"I tried this place out based on a relative's recommendation while I was in Markham for work. The food I had was good but not memorable. It came out quickly and the service was prompt, although the interior of the restaurant was pretty generic. Overall this was a solid choice."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service.  Had the Manchurian beef, chilli chicken and chicken pakoras.  B All were super tasty.  Chicken pakoras were my favourite"}
{"text":"Visited last Saturday,  not too busy. We ordered chicken pakora chili chicken,  crispy ginger beef, hakka machurine noodles. All prepared fresh and perfect. Service was great. Will visit often."}
{"text":"Just ate here today unfortunately I did not take any pictures. I was extremely satisfied with my meal I got the lunch special which came out to about $7.50 roughly. It came with your choice of meat, white rice, a spring roll and your choice of either soup or a can of pop. Now I've eaten at a lot of hakka style Chinese restaurants and I can tell you that this is a very good deal. What immediately impressed me was the cleanliness inside the restaurant which is sometimes rare in the smaller Chinese joints. The woman at the front desk greeted me with a nice hello and immediately made me feel welcomed which I also noticed lacks at other establishments. The food was fantastic exactly what I hoped for. I got the general Tao  chicken it was great the meat seemed to be good quality and made very well. Will definitely visit again and try the chili chicken next time!"}
{"text":"Came by on the Saturday 12:30pm. The place was empty. Since I already knew what I want to try. Ordering was done in 10 seconds. No taste on my corn soup at all, I have to use salt and pepper to make it edible. We ordered their chili chicken and chili fish. So-so, nothing to complain or praise about. The main point here is the price.  $6.95 all day special. Normal portion of food, a spring roll and your choice of soup(don't) or Pop."}
{"text":"Went here for a quick bite and the portions are incredible and prices are very reasonable. The service is very quick and friendly. Ordered the Szechuan rice with the chili chicken. Asked the waiter to make it spicy and it definitely was. I would come back for sure when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Saw the lawn signs around the area and thought I'd give it a try.  This location has changed hands many times and I've tried it each time.  Still my favourite was when it was the Nepalese buffet.  I'm quite sad to see it go.  Then it was a Indian buffet which was also short-lived.  Now, it's Hakka cuisine. My co-worker and I work just around the corner so we decided to give it a try over lunch.  I don't have much experience with Hakka cuisine, but I found it a bit too spicy but don't get me wrong...I love spicy food.  This type of spice just wasn't for me.  I found the spiciness overpowered the flavour of the food.  The price was right, at $6.95 you get rice, meat/veg dish on the side, spring roll and soup/pop.  I had the hot & sour soup, but found it hot, but not sour enough and there was lack of the ingredients to spoon out.  Ordered the Chili Fish, the portion was big, the fish didn't taste fishy, overall taste was alright, not spectacular.  The spring roll was fresh and crispy.  We didn't have to wait too long for the food probably because we got there early they just opened and not alot of people know about it.  The staff was very attentive and friendly.  Full marks for service.  Great place if you want an inexpensive lunch or dinner (since it's All Day Special) so I will try something different next time."}
{"text":"One of the best Hakka places I have come across. It's run by a family that hails from Calcutta and they have nailed the Hakka food. The pakoras  are yummy. Don't miss out on the manchurian. It's pretty good. A nice friendly clean place with some good food. If you are nearby watching a Bollywood film and don't want to eat Indian food at the Host, this one is a great option!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch. Price was reasonable. Friend ordered the Chili chicken and I had the Manchurian chicken. Food had flavour. Lunch special comes with choice of pop or hot and sour soup and a spring roll. Asked for extra chicken and the extra charge was reasonable. Looks like I've found a new Manchurian restaurant hang out."}
{"text":"great for lunch   very inexpensive and portion sizes are amazing. My office eats here at least twice a week. love it !"}
{"text":"After ready the reviews we decided to try this place. Clearly it wasn't my day. Hot and sour soup and chicken corn was a little diluted/watery. The cashew nut chicken was ok. The service was good."}
{"text":"Solid, solid food. Fresh, fast, tasty, provided by someone who could be my Chinese aunty. Had the fried wontons, hot and sour soup, and garlic shrimp. All very good. Will be back for sure the next time I'm in TO. Thanks for feeding me well Hakka 77."}
{"text":"Very friendly place for Hakka - a bit hard to find on the back side of a strip mall.  Reasonable prices.  Perhaps a bit less spicy than some others, but food was very flavourful and portions were generous.    Recommended if you have a craving for Hakka in the Richmond Hill area or nearby."}
{"text":"Food is quite decent, but what really differentiates this place is the nice homey atmosphere.   Definitely recommend having the pakoras, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Hakka 77 is a new hakka chinese food place.  It's a full house tonight.  The prices are excellent, dishes are wonderful.  Staff is very friendly and it seems like they know all their customers personally.  Free wifi.  They are the only Hakka place in the area and it looks like they are doing very well.  We love hakka food and will return!"}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed this family run restaurant.  Seafood soup was light and not too thick, mango salad was perfect, chili chicken was good but too saucy, crispy beef was a little dry, pad Thai was a bit too ketchupy tasting and vegetables was underdone, green curry was tasty, the best was the fish pakora - it was very flavourful and delicious! Will come back again to this homey restaurant"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch to try this new Hakka place with some coworkers since it's right across the street. It wasn't too busy when we got there around 12:30 but they did just open recently. Good thing is their meat is halal so my coworker was able to eat whatever she wanted.  The service was good, the waiters were friendly. The food did take a little bit but there was another large table of 10 so that might be what was slowing them down. We were a party of 3 and got our food pretty much at the same time which was good.   I ordered the chili chicken special that comes with rice, spring roll, and soup or pop for $6.95. This is an all day special too, not just for lunch. Plus, on top of that they have a store opening discount of 10% right now until the end of January.   Anyways, back to the food - it was a decent portion and tasty. Is it the best chili chicken I've ever had? No. I think Federicks has forever ruined all other chili chicken for me because I have yet to find one comparable to theirs. Don't get me wrong this was tasty and great value for the price. The depth of flavour just wasn't as developed. It was basically fried chicken that was tossed in sauce for a bit. I'm actually pretty sure that's what they do because I tried my coworker's manchurian chicken and it tasted almost exactly the same. I also tried a piece of my other coworker's chicken pakora which was $10.95 for about 8-10 pieces. Nice and crispy but it had a strong parsley taste (idk if this was because I really hate parsley and can taste it from a mile away) so I wouldn't order it again. Not the best pakora I've had. Guess who that award goes to? Federicks. My Hakka lover. Plus $11 for that amount of pakora is a bit much. Overall I would come back here for a cheap lunch but nothing really stood out."}
{"text":"Went for a late night dinner.  It's a little hidden but the food is great and staff is very friendly"}
{"text":"Overall, I have to say that this Hakka place was disappointing. I think I had higher expectations due to Yelp reviews and the fact that the East end tends to have better Asian food overall than the West end.   Upon walking in, the restaurant looked clean and only a few tables were filled. It got a bit busier throughout the night though.   There were some menu options to choose from but not as many as other Hakka places. This doesn't matter much to me as long as the food is good but some people might want to keep this in mind before going.  My husband and I ordered the chili chicken since it was raved about on Yelp and it was the most flavourful out of the 3 orders but only a bit spicy. This dish wasn't anything to complain about but we've had better elsewhere. The hot and sour soup (which I thought was hard to mess up) was awful and just did not taste anything like how it should! I really don't recommend getting this! We also ordered vegetable fried rice which was bland and even worse the next day when we ate the leftovers. In terms of price, it was reasonable for the portions but because the flavours didn't wow me, I unfortunately can't say that I'll be back."}
{"text":"Haven't eaten Hakka food for a long time so my husband and I went out for lunch  to try this place out. We had the lunch special chili chicken and manchurian fish. It comes with daily soup(corn soup)or pop and spring roll. Per order is just $6.95 and serving size is big. I can't resist and ordered the shrimp pakora.. ooohhh I'm glad I did! Lunch is cheap and we get to take home leftovers still."}
{"text":"Just finished eating takeout from Hakka 77  I had the chilli chicken and the Manchurian veggie noodle chicken and a shrimp pad Thai for my wife  Review - our food was amazing. Large portions at a good price  Will definitely come back"}
{"text":"Great food with lots of flavor and taste. Lyn, is a good hostess.Will definitely go back. A hidden gem that we found and its our second visit and truly enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Came here at 7pm on a Saturday night.  Had come to go to the nearby restaurant mall, couldn't find parking, so we tried Haka 77.  It was quiet on a Saturday.  It's a bit secluded and not visible from the street.  Apparently they do a lot of take out.    We were greeted by friendly people and seated immediately.  There's a pretty varied menu.  My girlfriend and I decided on the deep fried wontons and the fish pakora for apps.  I also had a small seafood soup.  Our mains were the General Tao's beef for me and the Thai green curry for her.  I will review each dish.  Wontons: these were pretty standard fare for a westernized Chinese place.  They were crispy, hot and flavorful. Filling was good, and the sweet Thai chili sauce they came with was tasty.  This is not my favorite dish, but from a technical aspect they were perfect.  Could not have made them better, and if you like wontons, you will not be disappointed.  My girlfriend loved them.  Fish Pakora: these were amazing.  Complex yet subtle flavor, made better with a squeeze of lime. They were served piping hot, crispy and delicious. The portion was 10 pieces each about 2.5 inches across.  This is easily an appetizer for 5 people.  They are also pretty good cold, which is great because you will have leftovers. I'm not kidding when I say piping hot.  They look like something you'd want to stuff whole into your mouth and then spend 5 minutes trying to chew.  When they are cold that's a great idea.  When fresh, if you try that you will need a trauma ward, reconstructive surgery and a burn unit.  Seafood soup: delicious.  Fish, crab, shrimp, egg, tofu, carrots, peas and a hint of cilantro.  I added a bit of salt and some of the delightful chili sauce and it was excellent.  10/10 would eat until I explode.  Good old General Tao:  if you like this dish, you will like their version.  Tender beef, tasty chillis, celery and onions in a hot, sticky mess of a sauce.  I ate enough that I began to question my life choices but not my meal choices.  Green curry: I stole a bunch of it from my girlfriend.  It was also an amazing dip for the pakora. Coconutty, tenderiffic, veggieful and currylicious.  I know these are not real words. It was tasty enough that it needed new words.  I'm ordering it next time. This dish and the general Taos came with a big shared bowl of steamed rice.  I strongly recommend this restaurant.  Give it a shot, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"All day special 6.95 wow   These guys have great service, good food and HUGE portions. Chilli chicken wasn't too soggy like most places. Manchurian noodle had good flavour. Definitely will be back"}
{"text":"One day when I was working from home, I decided to check out Hakka 77 for lunch.  I called them over the phone, put in my order for the chili chicken lunch special, and picked up 10 minutes later.  The lunch special included a vegetarian spring roll, a hot and sour soup or can of pop, and your main dish on white rice.  Portion wise, for the price that you pay is quite decent.  I can't remember the exact amount, but for some reason $7 is standing out in my head.  But taste of the chili chicken is lacking.  There was enough gravy for the rice, but it just tasted soy sauce salty with a bit of spice."}
{"text":"3.5 star = 3 for food +0.5 for service/value  All Day Combo for $6.95!   Hakka 77 is perfect for lone diner like myself. Their All Day Combo is such a good value as the portion is generous and even comes with a choice of pop.   Chili Chicken (chili, garlic, onion) Manchurian Chicken (chili, garlic, onion, ginger, cilantro)  Both looked and tasted similar with the same soy sauce gravy base.  Hakka 77 now is on my lunch rotation in the area.   My review rating might change after trying other all day combo items or even something from the regular menu.  Extra Spicy please and a ginger ale to sooth the burn!"}
{"text":"Craving for Hakka food!  First time to eat here and not disappointed at all.  Place still has the decor from the previous Indian restaurant.  It's hidden from the main road. Not too impressive from the outside but you can't judge it by its outside look.  The food is good.  We ordered the chilli chicken, Hakka noodles and spicy dried beef.  Will be back again to try other dishes."}
{"text":"I recommend this place if you're really hungry. They have BIG portions and the price is reasonable! I visited around 4pm and the place was empty, so it was nice and quiet. I  got their chilli chicken and szechuan fried rice, both were very good! Service here is also good, the lady serving us was very friendly."}
{"text":"Recently, I've been on a Hakka feeding frenzy.  Been here a couple of times now and I really enjoy their food. Took the fam on a weekend to the joint and ordered up a whack of food. Chilli Chicken, Ginger Beef, H&S Soup, Golden Chicken Dumpling, Eggplant, and Chicken and Mixed Veggies. The Ginger Beef was not my fav.  I forgot that I liked CRISPY ginger beef.  One thing for sure, there was plenty of ginger.  Minus that plate everything else was very good. Big on the list, their Chilli Chicken and the Eggplant. The place was not busy.  Usually their big days are the weekdays where they have their excellent lunch value menu. The lady that served us was extremely pleasant and helpful.  Though not a biggie to some, it was great that she spoke perfect english.  No chance of misinterpretations here. This will be my go to place for Hakka in Richmond Hill."}
