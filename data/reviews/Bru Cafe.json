{"text":"Ice cream and service is great; a bit pricey for one scoop ($5)...but then again, its Yorkville. Its also not your typical sit and eat ice cream joint, more like your grab and go for a walk. They have 2 choices: Italian gelato and Kawartha ice cream; you can get an espresso too! An Italian tip...order an espresso with your ice cream and pour it on top!!! Amazing."}
{"text":"One of the best  Italian gelato and Kawartha ice cream ever! It is my favorite  place to grab my morning Espresso before I get to work.....Friendly staff , totaly recommend!"}
{"text":"This is a new place where you can pick up a coffee, gelato, etc.  The service was very friendly and welcoming.  I wish them good luck!  Lots of competition in the Yorkville area...  I only grabbed a drink and did not sample the gelato.  I was offered, unlike SOME places where sampling is not allowed, ahem, down the street..."}
{"text":"Bru Espresso Bar opened three months ago but I only just noticed it. Their business card, website and Facebook all list different phone numbers right now so I think they're still getting things together. For some reason, there is currently no signage that even mentions the word \"Bru\", so look for a cute lower-level spot advertising \"ESPRESSO + GELATO\". I just visited for the latter and it was lovely.  Aliya was a ray of sunshine behind the counter and helped us narrow down our flavour selections. The hazelnut/chocolate Bacio was delicious, as was the Cappuccino and Blood Orange. Prices are high and the same as Gelato Simply Italian a few doors down ($5 for a small cup or cone, $6.5 for medium and $7.50 for large), but I had a \"medium\" cup from the other place yesterday (yes, I had lunchtime ice cream two days in a row, I just can't worry 'bout no haters, gotta stay on my grind) and it was less than today's generous small cup from Bru. And the service here is friendlier.  You can also pay with PayPal here, and it's a breeze."}
{"text":"I pass by Bru frequently without giving it a second look, as I assume most people do, given that  it's been operating for a few months now on some prime Toronto real estate. I must admit that the only reason I stopped to enter today is because of the #paypalitTO promotion (great promotion btw!). The $5 Paypal gave me was just enough to purchase a small gelato with two flavours.   Upon entering, the lady behind the counter was quick to spot us peering through the glass window to examine each of their 12 flavours of gelato. She offered to let us sample her favourite combination - hazelnut and pistachio. I liked it so much that I ordered it right away.   .Gelato down the street makes a slightly better pistachio gelato, but Bru isn't far off. However, their hazelnut was one of the best I've tasted. They had many other tempting flavours, like Bacio and Ferraro Rocher (yeah I love hazelnuts).   My first time at Bru's was a pleasant experience, with good gelato and great service. Being able to pay easily through Paypal was definitely a plus."}
{"text":"I'm not much of a nut-flavoured ice cream person, but their pistachio gelato was really good! And there's a nice park right outside where you could sit down and hang out too! Was definitely worth the $5 for the small gelato."}
{"text":"Great place to grab an Espresso..or two :)..and some Gelato. The staff is all really nice and the service is quick.  It's on the bottom unit under a Sunglass store"}
