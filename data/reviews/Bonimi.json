{"text":"Bonimi has the best things about ethnic cuisine in Toronto: delicious food, servings that are beyond generous, friendly service, inexpensive, and a casual environment. The interior of Bonimi is small, decorated a lot like a house in the suburbs with lots of modern elements but very little character.  

The food that is served up makes a huge impression against the benign atmosphere.  We ordered the veal soup, a light, flavourful broth with a touch of cream served up with delicate chunks of veal.  Next we ordered some fried Serbian cheese, very simple and wholesome tasting, perfect against the Montenegran Vranac we chose for wine.  

Then came the grill sampler for two, which may as well have been for four.  A massive helping of cevapi, plescavica, chicken schnitzel, pork medallions, and the heart attack inspiring karadjorvjeva (fried veal rolled up filled with cream cheese, or \"kajmak\"), along with piles of steamed veggies and a delectable cabbage salad.  On the side was a hearty container of beans, shopska salad, and lepinya bread filled with more kajmak.  Honestly, if you looked at our take-out bag you wouldn't have thought we'd eaten anything at all.  Prices are extremely reasonable for the quality and quantity.

Do it."}
{"text":"Big portion, good taste, decent pricing, great service! Love their complementary crepe with Nutella!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing at this little restaurant. Had the pljeskavica and it's very authentic. They gave us a yum desert on the house, great! 

One waitress was clearly more friendly than the other. The interior of the place has no character whatsoever. Which is unfortunate as this food would go so well with an extended living room feel. 

However, the food is so tasty that I will come back regardless of the decor."}
{"text":"This is my favourite restaurant in this area!  The veggies are fresh, the grilled meats are grilled but still succulent, and you get huge portions as well (the \"smalls\" aren't really that small :) ).  I usually hate beans but they do an awesome job at that as well.  If this is your first time coming here, I highly recommend the \"Mesano Meso\" mixed platter to sample everything but you'll eventually want to explore their entire menu.  I also highly recommend the gypsy minced steak and the pork Bonimi schnitzel."}
{"text":"I'm a bit biased being of Serbian ethnic origin, but I very much enjoyed my recent visit to this little gem of a restaurant in the west end.  The food was delicious and authentic, and the service was professional and friendly.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I can't get enough of this place. The most recent time I've gone I had the meat platter at $50 with 4 friends. You're effectively paying $12 to get stuffed on the most delicious meat dishes ever. Ask for the apricot liquor too. Goes well to settle your stomach after. This place is definitely a good replacement for Rakia."}
{"text":"Amazing food and so consistent...never been less than completely satisfied! Meat platter is what dreams are made of."}
{"text":"As a Bosnian, I can say this food is good. I have brought my friends here on numerous occasions to try their food and they also loved it. Start with the meza, then kackavalj and for a main have ?evapi!  Naturally, don't forget the sljivovica. Hearty food. Great service. Will keep coming back."}
{"text":"If you're a meatatarian like me then this is the place for you! I came here with my family for a birthday dinner and we ordered the share platter for four which is chock-full-o grilled and deep fried meats. And it can definitely feed more than four people! Everything was delicious and our server was very nice (the girl with the Marilyn Monroe lip piercing). On top of the already awesome food we got complimentary crêpes for dessert!

Tip: Choose the homemade bread over \"regular\" bread...it's only $3 more and it's so worth it!"}
{"text":"I don't often get out for Serbian food and was very excited when my friend suggested we go to Bonimi. We were welcomed immediately and the excellent service continued throughout our meal.
We got salad to start which was solid but the topper was the meso meat sampler plate. Great mix of their best dishes that didn't disappoint!
Super pleased and have already recommend to multiple people."}
{"text":"Was in the neighbourhood and wanted to try something new. Went to Bonimi based on the reviews. Was not disappointed. Food was good portions were big. Staff was friendly. Would come back."}
{"text":"Had a business lunch here on a Friday.  A colleague recommended it.  

Really friendly service and it got quite busy at lunch with several larger groups.  Server recommended some dishes to us along with the homemade bread.  We didn't feel like fried food like schnitzel so that limited us somewhat.

The bread was amazing.  I think that was my best part of the meal!  My chicken dish was fresh but it looked and tasted like a pan fried chicken breast with no seasoning or marinade.

Will return and try the more popular menu items next tine."}
{"text":"Having seen only 4-5 star ratings on Yelp, my expectations were fairly high walking in to the Bonimo Cafe. Inside, the restaurant is quaint and small, a real mom and pop shop. 

I ordered the gurmanska for lunch which was a dish that resembled a beef steak with cheese filling. It was accompanied by three sides (an onion coleslaw, a lettuce coleslaw, and scalloped potatoes) 

The dish was beautifully plated and I was excited to dig in! But having never had Serbian food before, I found it to taste rather strange. The beef steak was salty and didn't taste like beef and as a result, I only ate about half of my meal. I'll make note that I can be a picky eater and that my friend finished her meal deftly.

The service was good. Waiter was nice and attentive.

Overall, I can't personally recommend eating here, though I believe other people's positive reviews to be genuine."}
{"text":"I can honestly say I've never (knowingly) eaten Serbian food before, but this was quite good and will inspire a return visit. It's admittedly not the cheapest lunch, but even if choosing from the large plates/dinner menu everything on the menu was under $20.

I had mince meat sausages that were wrapped in bacon which were satisfying, but admittedly I was more jealous of my dining associates massive minced meat steak stuffed with cheese and prosciutto which looked pretty epic. 

Atmosphere is pretty basic but service was very friendly. It's worth visiting, especially if looking for something tasty but different from the norm."}
{"text":"Pork schnitzel was perfectly cooked - light and crispy on the outside, flavourful on the inside. We were given complimentary crêpes when we were leaving. Customer service was good. Will be coming back again."}
{"text":"These people that own the restaurant are amazing!!!  The chef is the best!!!... and the service is more than amazing!  
Anybody from ex Yugoslavia will appreciate this place!!! Not to mention anyone who appreciates GREAT Food! YUM!"}
{"text":"Classic Serbian food. Get the platters! Bring friends and family and feast! Not a place for salad eaters but you can still have the best salad...opska (shopska). And a MUST is the bread with kajmak.....mmmmmmm"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing. That is all I can say. Incredibly good food, it will make you full and you will leave satisfied by how natural everything looks and tastes. It has a very European touch, which I highly enjoyed. Serbian/Croatian/Bosnian cuisine is amazing. The price is also very good, ~120 altogether with tip for 4 people. 10/10 would recommend the Gurmanska Pljeskavica."}
{"text":"The best ever restaurant with the best food taste specially Karadjorjeva and Shapska! Don't forget to ask them for Palachinki after meal, that's amazing desert!"}
{"text":"The food here is great, considering this is my culture food, I know what great Serbian food tastes like and it is at par with my grandmothers (which happens to be fantastic). I also love how dessert is on the house with most meals. I usually go for the cévapi which has been cooked perfectly every time I go. The crepes (palechinka) are light but very tasty. Love this place !"}
{"text":"I came here with some Macedonian friends. This place is authentic Serbian with wonderful food. The service was great and price was good. If you are in the area and are up for authentic Balkan cuisine Bonimi is a great choice."}
{"text":"This place is a must-try. Cevapi are great tasting. First time here and will be back again. Nikola was awesome and very professional. Clean place."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I very rarely eat Eastern European, and so I have little experience with such cuisine.

But I definitely recommend Bonimi to anyone, especially if you don't have it often like me! I went there for dinner with a friend, and it's a very nice place to eat and have a nice quiet conversation. Our server was Stefani, and she very nice and patient with us, despite our having remarkable dietary restrictions and needing to have the menu explained to us.

I ordered a schnitzel stuffed with mushrooms, mozarella, and something else which I forget, and I had expected it to be breaded and deep fried, but it was grilled, and now I know I infinitely prefer grilled over fried. The entree was very flavourful and clean, and Stefani even let us know that we could order 2 1/2 sides, and so we found out the rice and vegetables were great as well!

On top of this, dessert is on the house!!!! A crepe with your choice of nutella, jam, or honey (or a mix) with crushed walnuts on top. Simply yummy!

Highly recommended for the food and service! Great atmosphere for 1-on-1s or family get-togethers."}
{"text":"Note:  Not really as casual as a \"cafe\", but I'd say Serbian/Modern European is more accurate.

Parking:  Paid parallel in front of restaurant on Bloor OR Green P on either side of the restaurant.  I didn't note any parking specifically for Bonimi around back OR it wasn't marked properly.  There are no parking signs in the residential area directly behind the restaurant.

Location:  Diagonally across the street from Islington Subway stn.

My dining companion said the food at Bonimi was very similar to Royal Meats, so if you've ever been there, that would be a close comparison.  (I've never been, so I cannot comment.)  However, I wouldn't really say it's a \"light\" meal, unless you just get a salad.  Entrees are more meat 'n potatoes type fare.

Average entree prices were around $15 for a \"small\" portion and I'd say that small is quite generous!  I shared a small Bonimi Schnitzel (battered, rolled up, with cream cheese, & deep fried) + a small Cevapi with my friend.  That was more than enough food, and we were both stuffed, although we didn't have any leftovers to speak of.

Both food + sides were good.  Home fries were more like hand cut wedges.  And I really enjoyed the baked beans!  Again, not \"light\", so if you're looking for more of this kinda meal, it's a great option especially considering the area."}
{"text":"Definite neighborhood gem! Don't let the name fool you, this place is a small sit-down restaurant, definitely not a cafe.

They have a small menu consisting of various types of Serbian grilled or fried meats, some seafood, and sides. According to my bf (who is Balkan), the whole menu can all be considered typical home cooking dishes, so very rustic, no-frills food.

Our lunch was very hearty, and very, very tasty. We each got a small main, and had a salad and homestyle bread to share. The portions were very generous. My bf said everything tasted the same as he remembers from back home, and I think he enjoyed it so much he  even got a little emotional.

It's a place we know we're going to keep coming back to!"}
{"text":"Finally made it back here for dinner last night. It's our 2nd visit and I still remembered how much we loved it the first time when we came.  Discovering Serbian cuisine was the best thing ever!  If you are a foodie, you must try Serbian food!  It's too bad that we weren't living in the west end or we would be here on a regular basis.

Last time we had the mixed grilled platter for two small which is a perfect dish if you are coming for the first time - a little bit of everything.  Since this was our 2nd visit, we tried a few new dishes - pljeskavica (minced meat steak), Karadjordjeva(schnitzel rolled up stuffed with cheese) and of course Cevapi (minced meat roll) which is my favorite dish.  And you can choose any 2 sides - I recommend the cole slaw, rice and/or potatoes.  It was all very delicious!  And to finish it off, they gave us free dessert - sweet crepe with your choice of topping.  The Nutella one is my favorite!  The portions are huge so you will definitely be full and the service is excellent."}
{"text":"Never thought I'd be giving 5 stars to a Serbian/Croatian restaurant but this place is dynamite. I enjoyed their grilled squid with potatoes and vegetables and of course my husband went for the ?evape. The kajmak was delicious. The quality of the food is insane and the portions are generous. The service was just lovely. It was almost better than my mom's and dad's home cooked traditional meals. And their bread! I think this is the first time my husband and I polished off a whole bread basket. Our meal ended with complimentary Nutella and hazelnut crepes that just put us in a state of ecstasy. From now on I'm taking all my family and guests here. Just wonderful."}
{"text":"Walking back and forth on Bloor St. not knowing what to eat, my girlfriend and I stumbled upon Bonimi. They highlighted they serve Eastern European food and we were intrigued since we had no idea what Eastern European food is like.

While sitting on the patio, trying to Google what everything is, a satisfied customer came out and made recommendations based on what she just had. We were super excited to hear someone raving about the restaurant after a satisfied meal. 

We went with the meat platter for 2..... It was A LOT of food. From what my remembered, There was 4 little sausages (THEY WEER AMAZiNG), a patty, chicken and pork slices, with a side of veggie and bread ... for only 30$!"}
{"text":"What can I say!? I finally get to write about this amazing place which I've been to for over 4 years. Visited and loved it: probably over 12 times!!! 

The decor isn't much. It sits about 30 people. It's small and quaint, but the service is excellent and the food is awesome!! 

Bonus - it comes with complimentary crepe dessert which they have kept it since I tried it over 4 years ago! 

Happy:  It's definitely a hidden gem at the intersection of Bloor and Islington. I've brought many friends to this place and all of them loved it! Today, I ordered my usual which is the veal vienna schnitzel that comes with home fries (which they cut it round and fried it, like wedges but better) and steamed veggies. The tartar sauce is to die for, that's why I keep on coming back and back. I've tried other dishes and they are not bad at all too. 

You will leave this place honestly truly happy and full! You might have trouble walking since they feed you well. It comes with chewy bread which is nice. 

Not happy:  Nothing!!  =)

Verdict:  Yummy food! Yummy food! You must try it to believe it. You won't be disappointed. I haven't - yet!"}
