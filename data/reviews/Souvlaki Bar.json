{"text":"There are times when restaurants are busy, and it takes long to get served. There are times when restaurants are understaffed. This is one of those stories, only way worse. We arrived 10 minutes early for our 7:30pm reservation, and were seated just before 8:00pm. After ordering our meals soon afterwards, we spent almost ah hour looking at our empty glasses, while we waited for our food. During that time, a round of ouzo shots were ordered, and they took over half an hour to arrive at the table. The food wasn't bad, but it certainly wasn't worth the poor/lack of service. I will never be back. I already know I can get a Greek meal just as good or better for less money, and less hassle at Arahova."}
{"text":"Il y a de l'amélioration. En fait, hier c'était la 4e fois qu'on va au Souvlaki Bar. L'atmosphère est bien et la terrasse nous fait revenir lorsque Mme Météo le permet. Par contre, la qualité  de la nourriture nous faisait hésiter. Il faut dire qu'à Laval, nous sommes bien servis par les restos grecques. Par contre, je dois avouer que le restaurant s'améliore et je vais retourner encore. J'espère que la qualité et la constance vont être au RDV. Félicitation pour l'amélioration."}
{"text":"We were really excited that they decided to open a Souvlaki Bar in Saint-Laurent and it didn't disappoint. Service was quick and friendly (we even had our favorite waiter from the location in Centropolis!). The food was just as good as we expected with the juicy flavorful meat and tasty potatoes. The portions are huge. The ambience was nice. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Loved loved the chicken pitas!! Friendly professional staff. Came in at closing time and received freshly made food. Dining room looked spotless.  Highly addictive tzatziki sauce keeps me coming back."}
{"text":"Probably the best Greek restaurant I've been to. I adore Greek food and it's spot on. The servers are cool, very kind, service is quick, and the design is modern, yet, has a Greek feel to it. Would recommend a lot. If you want a quick meal or you just wanna hang out, it's perfect."}
{"text":"Service was excellent (attentive, friendly).  The food was great.  I tried the Bifteki which I was told was the owner's GrandMother's recipe from the old country (Greece/Macedonia).  I had the one-skewer which was plenty (2pcs of 4oz).  Lots of TVs to watch the big game, but the noise level was reasonably low which was nice.  Great Value - Prices were very reasonable for what you received.  On-Tap beer selection could've been broader, but they had some good choices despite this."}
{"text":"I travel a ton for work.. so I eat out - a lot. I found this place through Google by happenstance, and I'm really glad I did! I ordered the Dolmades (grape leaves stuffed with rice, veggies, and spices), the Village Salad, and Chicken/Beef Souvlaki. First, the food was delicious! Seasoned just right, and they worked with my food allergies! They also told me about specials I might be interested in during the week that would work with my allergies. (Anyone who has allergies would attest - it's nice to have someone be super careful and caring with the food.) Second, even though the food was to go, when I arrived at my hotel - the food was packed with great presentation. I appreciated again, the care that was placed. Third, I think for the amount of food I ordered, the price was spot on. Great service, great food, great place! I recommend you give this place a try. It's worth it."}
{"text":"Service can use a little work, but the food is very good, as is the ambiance."}
{"text":"So I have been to this restaurant twice. First of all I love that the restaurant inside makes you feel like your in Greece from the ceiling to the chairs to the floors. The decor is seriously spot on. Now the drink situation, I really like that they incorporate Greek liquor in their special drinks! Also the Greek beer, try a \"FIX\" it's like Greek Heineken! It is truly something different. Now as for the food!! So number 1 I have yet to try the souvlaki. I have tried the gyro meat which is very very good (not disgustingly greasy) so I enjoyed that. However the star plate here is really the biftekakia plate. They literally taste like your grandma just made them, try this plate and you wont regret it. Don't expect bread though, the plate comes with 2 decent sized patties. You have to choose between fries, rice or Greek potatoes. The Greek potatoes melt in your mouth and you don't need a knife to cut them, they are great because you taste the lemon and olive oil.  The rice is also very good here, but it is the traditional chicken stalk with carrots and maybe some celery. If you are expecting extravagance from rice don't get it. I love the biftekia here and the gyro meat so I will definitely go back. The plates are not huge  but once you finish your food you are full, so I can't complain there.  I haven't had bad service so far everyone has always been super helpful and great at giving suggestions ! If I ever do will post about it! P.S. really not expensive here so that is definitely a plus!"}
{"text":"This is a really nice location with big open dinning area a lot of the staff is Greek so you can feel like your out in Greece having an authentic meal. The service is good and the speed at which the food arrives is great and it's super tasty. The price is average for a Greek restaurant. They have a large selection of Greek spirits as well. I think you'll really enjoy this place !"}
{"text":"Stumbled here while looking for dinner during a weekend trip to Montreal and we were staying in Laval. It is in the Centropolis plaza and we thought this was an interesting restaurant, so we stopped in. We were pleasantly surprised. Our waitress, Lisa, was the nicest person we have ever met! She took her time to explain the menu and recommended awesome drinks. Never did she get rude or become inpatient. We ordered the fried calamari appetizer and the meat shovel (gyro version) the other version is the stick version and the meat is on a stick rather than in pieces. You get an option of a potato with the meat shovel (though it states it serves 2, it definitely can serve 3! The calamari were LARGE and perfectly fried. The meat was alright. I preferred the pork and chicken over the sausage and hamburger meat. We chose roasted potatoes, and that was pretty good as well. Souvlaki Bar has a great atmosphere for the weekend as it was packed and lively! Their drinks were also pretty potent! The meat shovel also comes with 2 pitas which were soft and fluffy.   Parking may be difficult to find in this plaza as we were only able to find a spot all the way across the plaza. It was also a very cold night so if they start to valet (maybe it's an American thing), it would be amazing.  Overall we had a great time, highly recommend."}
{"text":"We really liked the food. The portions were great and the service was friendly. Chicken souvlaki was very good."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. I really enjoyed the shrimp plate and the mini souvlakis."}
{"text":"I went to the new location in Ville St. Laurent. It opened this week so it was very busy. The staff was very friendly and polite. The food took a while but I was expecting that because of it being new. It was hot and fresh but just, ok. The chicken in the pita was over cooked but the fries were to die for. When I asked if they served Naturizzata water they offered me Greek bottled water. If you like clean fresh water find the restaurants that serve Naturizzata water. It's the best and so many very decent restaurants in Montreal have it.  Btw, the water in Ville St. Laurent is aweful."}
{"text":"Very nice establishment and friendly staff. Didn't have a lot of vegan options but has a few vegetarian ones. Had a bowl of lentils, salad and potatoes, it was very good, specially the potatoes :)"}
{"text":"Si vous trouvez le McDo trop salé, ce restaurant n'est pas pour vous. C'est le royaume du sel.   Pita au porc salé garni une sauce tzatziki salée avec un peu de salade, oignons et tomates pour souligner le goût de sel. C'était accompagné de frites salées et le tout saupoudré de sel aromatisé.  Qu'est-ce qu'on ferait pour apprêter des viandes sans sel et sauce?"}
{"text":"If you're looking for an excellent Greek meal, at very reasonable prices, then this is your place; however make sure you come hungry as the portions are a good size!  The staff are extremely friendly and do a great job of attending to everything. I sat in the bar area as I was solo and it was pretty wide open at the time.  A good selection of beer on tap so things were off to a great start.  I foolishly ordered the tzatziki.  Although it tasted great, when I got my Chef's plate of a half a chicken, Greek style, I had food overload. As I said to my waitress, I can't believe how tender the chicken is.  Amazing.  Bursting with flavour.  The salad was excellent.  Wonderful dressing, a chunk of feta and the biggest tomato slices I've seen in a restaurant.  The lemon potatoes were excellent, although I would have liked a few more. Overall a great dining experience and highly recommend it for a Greek feast!"}
{"text":"Came out here with a friend for a  casual weeknight dinner. Like most places in Centropolis, the space is very large with high ceilings. There's some nice greek inspired decor mixed in with sports memorabilia and TVs playing the hockey game. I know it's meant to be casual and as the restaurant name implies \"Bar\"-like but personally i found the design a bit strange...  Anywho, on to the food. At the recommendation of the waiter I ordered the 1/2 pound pork gyro plate with greek style potatoes and salad while my friend ordered a pita. I swear the order came out in less than 5 minutes! Don't get me wrong, I love speedy service.  However I do believe it can be a bad thing to be too quick on service. Made me wonder if there are just trays of food lingering around in the kitchen... my plate was borderline warmish-cold. The gyro was tender but nothing too memorable. The potatoes were an oily and bland letdown while the salad was a sloppy mix of unevenly cut veggies drowned in what tasted like store-bought Kraft dressing. Honestly the main course was hardly better than food court fare.   On a more positive note the dessert we ordered was the redeeming factor. A cross between a baklava and cheesecake. Satisfyingly sweet and perfect to share.  Our server was attentive enough but often gave us a vibe of being in a hurry to clear our plates and make us leave. There were several free tables throughout the restaurant and it was far from being late (8 pm) so it did strike us as odd.   If you're looking for a true Greek experience definitely look elsewhere. It'll do for a quick meal but I find Arahova and Marathon taste better."}
{"text":"I've had Greek food plenty of times, but this is the first with someone of Greek decedents.  Apparently this place is where all the young Greek gods and goddesses like to gather.  The restaurant has a high ceiling, with a smaller second floor that is great for private parties and can look down onto the stage where there are singing performances in evenings.  There are also outside seatings.   We started with some dip platter, and I couldn't get enough of the taramosalata, which is made with fish roe. The shovel is what everybody orders here, a generous pile of food including sausage (loukaniko), gyros or skewers, burger (befteki).  The burger and sausage both have oregano, mint and other seasonings that give them a \"Greek\" taste.   This being Montreal, we have to order poutine.  The Greek version of it, topped with tzatziki and feta, is delicious, and definitely one of my favorite versions of poutine.  The tzatziki's tanginess is great to make the fries feel less greasy.    They have a few Greek beers available, and we also ordered a frappe.  Now, frappe as I know it, in the U.S., means a frappuccino,  a smoothie-thick latte, but a Greek frappe is an iced coffee drink, made from instant coffee covered with a layer of froth that results from shaking the coffee in a shaker.   Not the best coffee as it's made with Nestle instant, but hey give it a try if you've never!"}
{"text":"A reasonable priced Greek restaurant;Souvlaki Bar is beautiful, clean, bright and big restaurant, the only distraction of this resto is the non necessary posters of singers, actors that damages the decor.  The service was super friendly. Our waitress was very knowledgeable. She was also funny. Our food arrived quickly.   There was Chicken Souvlaki pita plate, Calamari pita plate, the Grilled Shrimp plate and grilled Octopus with Greek salad. All food tasted very good, I wouldn't say it was out of ordinary.   The prices were reasonable. It didn't hurt the wallet, phew!   If near Saint Laurent or you are passing by Place Vertu Mall; it is a pretty decent restaurant to try."}
{"text":"Quite disappointing, so many other great gyro spots in the city. The gyro pita had no taste, the actual pork on its own was subpar and the tzatziki lacked garlic. I have no idea what those fries were all about. The lentils in the soup were only half cooked."}
{"text":"First time eating here- will be returning for sure. Excellent service by our waiter, George. He explained the menu and how they cook their food and he was always making sure we didn't need anything else. My boyfriend and I shared the meat shovel and had a Greek salad on the side. All the food was out of this world delicious. Great ambience too, very authentic. Best Greek restaurant in Montreal!"}
{"text":"Went for a quick work lunch and I haven't been this impressed with a restaurant at lunch in a while.  The souvlaki pita was very good but the highlight was the Greek potatoes. Baked in the oven with lemon juice and Mediterranean salt and herbs. I could have just eaten a plate of that.   The house red wine was also very good. Very nice decor and friendly staff. Can't ask for more. Will be making this a regular lunch stop."}
{"text":"I was really hesitant to change my review of Souvlaki Bar but I feel that people have the right to know...  As my earlier review mentions, I never wrote a review of my first experience at Souvlaki Bar because it was just horrible but it was opening week and mistakes happen.  The second time we went it was much better (the proof is in my 5* review).  However I have now been 4 additional times since my last review (Each time I am an invited guest of someone else, not my own choosing). While the food has always been decent to good the service has always been horrible on each of those 4 occasions!   Here are some highlights from my visit in early June. 1. Had to flag down waitress to place order 2. Had to flag down waitress to clear our plates 3. Had to flag down waitress to BEG for water or a second beverage 4. Had to flag down waitress to request coffee and dessert 5. Had to flag down waitress to pay our bill.  (As a side note, we ordered a Meat Shovel for 4 people and we ALL hated the fact that our fries, which we paid extra to upgrade, were buried underneath the 4 types of meat. I would make a friendly suggestion to put fries on the side!)  Highlights from our visit last night: 1.Asked for water from our waitress when 1. Placing our order for drinks 2. Placing our order for apps, 3. Placing our order for main course. Only got water when stopping ANOTHER waitress. 2. Ordered a Coke which was flat, had no taste. Waitress said \"Sorry\" and left it on our table. Asked another waitress to take it away and bring us a bottle of water. 3. The oven roasted potatoes were NOT oven roasted. In fact they were boiled and meant to be finished off in the oven but weren't left long enough. Potatoe was undercoked, had no browning or any flavor.  4. The french fries on the \"Massacre\" tasted like store bought french fries. 5. Was charged for returned coke. When asked to have the bill adjusted it took over 20 minutes. Waitress seemed very unhappy that we didn't want to pay for a crap product and said \"its better than nothing\".  Needless to say, I don't care if Adam Levine himself invites me to Souvlaki Bar, I'll have to say no....okay maybe I'd go and watch him eat while I sip on an Athena cocktail because THAT is good!"}
{"text":"I went with my friends Thursday night. The food is great! Love the tzaziki sauce! The ambiance is really fun and different. The waitress was really kind and good service. The boss or the manager came a few times to our table to see if everything was ok. Really sweet and kind. Every boss should be as kind and a good mood as him. But we were freazing inside. It was really cold inside. We left earlier because of that."}
{"text":"Came here yesterday for some lunch, it was my first time. I would say i was quite surprised at how good everything was. I got the chicken Gyro which comes with salad, rice, greek potatoes and a bunch of tzatziki. The chicken is very flavourful , they cook it differently then most other Greek places I've tried. For dessert, I took a Baklava cheesecake to go, i had it later that day and it was amazing. I'm usually not really a dessert person but this was so creamy and delicious , you can't NOT like it."}
{"text":"There are much better souvlaki places in Montreal but in Laval, it's not a bad restaurant. The Greek potatoes were a good accompaniment. It's a bit pricey but the decor is nice."}
{"text":"I was so excited when I found out that there will be a new greek restaurant opening near my place. My friend and I decided to give a try. We took the one chicken stick plate. It comes with salad, fries and rice. Nothing special though.  It never goes wrong. Ive had this plate in other places. It is just good comfort food. But we enjoyed it. It has a lot a seats, the decors are pretty and the design is quite original.  I would come back."}
{"text":"Do you like greek food?  This is the place! Not known for its old school looks or vibes, this place has a modern take on greek platers. I came with my family and we all took appetizers. Spanakopita, sesame feta and a classic calamari.. amazing!  As a main meal, we all took pitas. Chicken gyros and chicken souvlaki. They all came with rice, fries and salad. Now, I'm not someone that eats salad but I ate everything! Haha.  Great vibe, lots of people (New to the cornor) but I think this will thrive here!  Enjoy:)"}
{"text":"Came here 2 weeks ago for a work 5a7. We were a pretty big group and for the most part, the waitress did a really good job with our orders and splitting the bills at the end.  We split a pitcher of blue sangria (yummy) and some appetizers, which were all delicious. I tried a little bit of the spanakopita, the honey sesame oven-baked feta cheese, and the trio of dips served with thick pita bread. Great start to the meal.   Because it was a Thursday evening, they had a special $2 mini pitas! So I got 2 chicken mini pitas all dressed with a small shovel of fries to share. Their tzatziki is delicious but super intense garlic-wise.   What I love about the location is the beautiful decor, the easy access to the highway and the ample parking space. Very yummy and would consider going back!"}
{"text":"First visit. How does it compare to Marathon or Arahova? It was okay.  Chicken souvlaki is different, cut for you in the pita. Tzaziki not quite the same as the other 2.  My wife liked the gyro more than Marathon and my kids like the chicken souvlaki better than Marathon as well.  To each their own I guess. Fries are pretty good (on the soaked in oil side though). Salad a little on the drying out side.  Atmosphere was good and the waiter was good as well."}
{"text":"Theres room for improvement!! I was looking forward to this greek fast food restaurant since it has the same name as the one in laval.Im not impressed with the quality of the food here unfortunately..I wish it was better. Got 1/2 portion of chicken souvlaki comes with rice,salad & fries and tzatziki. Rice is overcooked must be microwaved. Fries are good and tzatziki was very delicious. Chicken portion was small and marination was not greek style spices.salad dressing not the greatest. Decor is fun and cool but im looking for quality please ill come back I hope it will improve."}
{"text":"Delicious food however a long wait if you go on a friday or saturday evening! Have to grab a Mylos beer and a gyro pita delicious!! Busy restaurant because the food is quite authentic. Second floor lots of room if you want to plan a birthday or family get together."}
{"text":"I had suggested trying souvlaki bar to some  friends  and had regretted suggesting it   First point  we waited a very long time to be served,  Second point We could barely converse as the music was too loud. When the appetizers arrived they were good, particularly the calamari, and the tsaziki,  I must say however that  my chicken souvlaki was burnt to a crisp, literally crunchy ashes on some of the bites  The prices weren't too high and the portions sizes were good  I will not go back"}
{"text":"Montreal's Greek immigrant community has made the city famous for its Souvlaki. I knew that a Souvlaki joint in Montreal would be good eating, but I had no idea how good it would be at Bar Souvlaki. Brought the family here for dinner after a long day. Our meals were perfection. I had the Calamar pita and a green salad with some chicken on the side. The pita was amazing, as were the salad and chicken. The chicken was so good that my wife, who ordinarily turns up her nose at dark meat, readily wolfed it down with me.   My wife had a chicken pita with the Village salad, an authentic Greek salad without lettuce. She especially loved the tsatsiki, didn't want the meal to end, and is now begging to come back here for lunch.   My kid had the chicken pita kids meal, served with rice and steak fries."}
{"text":"Prices are reasonable, huge portions but the taste and the way they cook their meat are not constant.  I've been there 4 times, ordering the same dishe and it tasted different each time."}
{"text":"Original greek restaurant,  the decor and the food presentations are different than the your usual Greek dinner. The food in itself is basically the same you will find the tsadziki. Fried calamari, Saganaki cheese(grilled  white cheese ). For the main course you can order a shovel of meats for 2 or 4 (its a shareable dish with porc and chicken souvlakis and biftekia (ground beef patties) and  loukaniko(pork sausage ). You can also get individual plates and sandwiches. The prices are fair."}
{"text":"I have been here for business for a little over a month and am amazed at all the great food in this area, so I expected nothing less than the best and was not disappointed.  The atmosphere was great and food even better.  I'm sad I may not be in the area again anytime soon. Give it a try, you will not be let down!"}
{"text":"We've been to Souvlaki Bar on a couple of occasions. It has delicious, well-prepared Greek food. The different kind of fries and the honey-glazed sesame crusted cheese are excellent. Service is quick and friendly."}
{"text":"Food was average: octopus appetizer was microscopic, the meat shovel sounded good but was terribly executed. Got a sprite which i instantly regretted: served in a cup with 3/4 ice and bar soda gun no name lemon-lime soda. My parents asked for loukoumades which i tried to tell them not to and we were informed that their fryer was off so we waited 20 minutes for the saddest loukoumades we've ever had and our waiter didn't even offer it to us for free for the kitchen's incompetence. The other group next to us knew the owner so they got the vip treatment: bottle waters for all, even got their food before us (they arrive 15 minutes after us). The service was absolute shit; not a single water refill in 2 hours. Asked for extra pita and the waiter was condescending saying: \"start with this and i'll get you more\". The nerve on this guy. Then the pita comes out cut up into triangles. Overall a waste of money and time. I'll be getting my fix from Marven's and Marathon's. If you're in the area you're better off going to Cage aux Sports or even Mcdonald's. You will be getting better service garanteed."}
{"text":"I have been to the souvlaki bar a few times now, and it's not a bad place. The problem with this place is consistency. You could have the best souvlaki, or grilled chicken greek style with fresh salad and great pita bread or you can end up having dried chicken, burnt bread and salad with yellowish lettuce. It's really a 50/50 chance. Same goes for the staff, they can be really friendly nice or they can completely forget your there. Overall If you have never been here i would give it a try."}
{"text":"La pelletée de viande est succulente. L'ambiance est familiale. Une bonne expérience."}
{"text":"Super super super disappointed with the service. I went in with two friends on a Tuesday night. There was a line out the door, yet there was plenty of seating available. Don't understand why they kept everyone waiting... people were very confused. Anyway, we finally got to our table after 15 minutes.   I was already a little annoyed, but it soon magnified. It took 30 minutes to get a waiter to come to our table! No water, nothing. The restaurant wasn't even half full. No apology, of course. Food took another 30 minutes to arrive, and we never got our cocktails. Really not impressed. Food was pretty good, but not worth the pointless wait. Never going back. I hear this happens often. I'm incredibly turned off."}
{"text":"The place looks great and you are greeted at the door by a distinguisted gentleman.He seems to be looking over everything that it is running well.  The calimari appie and dinner was excellent. The pork souvlaki a little over done. The burger pattie was cooked perfectly, juicy and delicious. The greek sausage was a nice addition. The tzatziki was terrible it tasted like the  glue you used to use  in primary school.I added some lemon and it was passable. For a place that prides it's self on great Greek food, this is somewhat shameful.  They don't make it, its a brought in product that I have seen before. At least the waitress admitted this.The meat shovel was tacky even if it's done in a nice shovel(?). The staff was friendly but then none existent. Drop the plates and disappear. Prices are quite good for the food value just the service is lacking."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of eating here last week with a few friends, we heard about there meat shovel which gets a lot of buzz, so we decided to try it out.. it came with biftekia, almost like a Greek hamburger patties which was fantastic, chicken, beef and pork along side with a few pitas and choice of potatoes and of course tzatiki, and we also ordered the calamari plate, which was fantastic, the batter was light and crispy.  Everything was great, I found the chicken to be a tad too oily but still very flavourful, I was pleased with the huge portion they brought to the table, it didn't disappoint. The restaurant itself has that old school Greek feel, a lot of blue and white everywhere, but still a sense of modern sleek design. The service was quick and friendly, I'll definitely have to come back and try a few of there other dishes and maybe a frappe or 2!"}
{"text":"Souvlaki bar opened up last year and located in the middle of Centropolis. We came here for lunch to celebrate a coworker's birthday. Despite my apprehension of prior experiences I had in restos located in Centropolis as well as precedent Yelp reviews of this establishment... I'm pleased to report my experience here was quite positive.  We went with the gyro meat shovel plate (was that even a debate?!?) as well as with their greek village salad. The plate comes in two formats of dinner for 2 or 4. Four our group of 3, this was sufficient. The meats were very good and I enjoyed making my own pitas with the provided meats and dressing. I even snuck in a few crispy fries to make it authentic.   Service was very good but the place was quiet for most of the service so I can't judge how efficient they are during busy hours. However Yanni was efficient and friendly.  The price-tag is higher than average but then again you're paying for dining in Centropolis.   I'd definitely come back and in fact.... it may come sooner rather than later!"}
{"text":"Ambiance chaleureuse, bon service! 15 minutes avant d'être servit. Lorsque vous demandez pour de l'alchool, ils s'empressent de vous le servir! Ils passent de multiples fois avant le repas pour confirmer que tout est bon pour vous! j'ai été très satisfait. Leur combo pour 2 vaut la peine en masse!"}
{"text":"Great place, great people. Nice ambience. The food tastes fresh and the portions are great. Souvlaki was excellent and the salad huge. Worth a visit or for takeout."}
{"text":"Delicious Greek food, all your classics and familiar flavors in a trendy up beat environment.   Went with a group and we ordered a bit of everything including the most expensive and supposed largest portion, \"meat shovel\" as the name implies it's a selection of 4 types of meat and a choice of sides served in a shovel. No complaints with the taste every single thing we ordered was delicious however the meat shovel was underwhelming for its size. At over 60$ that portion is meant to serve 4 adults but two people were easily able to finish it. Plus they were stingy with the rice, potatoes and tzaziki sauce. Each person only gets a tiny cup smaller than a shot glass.   If you are expecting huge portions from the meat shovel, I don't recommend it because it is not worth the money.   Other downfall is just concerning the seats, all chairs are wicker, so flimsy and light. If you opt for a booth, there are no cushions it's just solid wood so it's not a comfortable dining experience. Add that to the non stop loud blaring Greek music.   Still a great place to check out if you're not fussy about your comfort!  Fun bonus, they have a slush machine and make all kinds of alcoholic slush based drinks or you can just have it virgin of course :)"}
{"text":"I went 3 times.  It's not exceptional food. It is very basic . However, the meat shovel concept is fun and it makes for a nice family style atmosphere at the table.   Avoid the baked feta... It is covered in honey and the combination is a little nauseating. The burger meat is delicious. The salads are fresh but very bland.   I noticed many bad reviews about the service. I am surprised since I always had great service at this restaurant and all 3 times, my waiters were super friendly and efficient.   I will probably go back because my husband loves it. I don't mind because, like I said, they are very nice and the food is acceptable."}
{"text":"Mauvais. Tot était fade et sans goût. Les aliments n'étaient pas frais et goutaient le frigo. J'y suis allé avec les enfants et leur repas étaient tous aussi mauvais. Éviter cette place. Il y a bien meilleur pour le prix."}
{"text":"Nothing special. Greasy Greek food just like you'd find at Arahova or Marathon at twice the price. Annoyingly loud music, like they're desperately trying to create an atmosphere from nothing. Not planning to go back there."}
{"text":"I enjoy this restaurant. Nice atmosphere. Great food. Service is alright. The most important part is the food so yes it's good stuff. It's kids friendly too which is practical with 2 little boys."}
{"text":"went for their thursday 2 dollar souvlakis.  not anything special.if you want a cheap meal i guess it's not bad"}
{"text":"A must go on Thursdays! Mini souvlakis for only 2$ each. They are not that mini, smaller than a regular souvlaki but a good size for a simple 2$! Available in either pork or chicken. No minimum spending required unlike some places where you have to at least get a alcoholic beverage. Both souvlakis were very good, we also got cretan fries and Santorini salad. Salad was over priced at 9$ for a small and a little acidic. Fries were toped with myzithra cheese, a salty cheese that had the texture of parmesan. Fries were good. Cheapy Thursday is to take advantage of!"}
{"text":"Very good food, but going there on a Saturday night proved very noisy and it had a zoo-like atmosphere. The food was 4 stars otherwise. We had the spanakopita and the calamari plate, both of which were very good. I needed to use earplugs as the noise level was excessive. The next time we ate there we took salads out, which was much better idea although it wasn't nearly as crowded as the previous time. If it is noisy and you are sensitive to noise, bring earplugs, otherwise it is recommended."}
{"text":"Très bonne expérience Grecque! J'ai choisi le combo pita/frites et c'était vraiment excellent. Les ingrédients étaient frais et le poulet de bonne qualité. J'ai aimé le service qui était rapide et efficace. Le prix était tout à fait correct et l'ambiance, bien que bruyante mais normale vu la disposition du restaurant, était festive. Je reviendrais sûrement pour me faire une idée sur les autres plats typique proposés car il y en avait beaucoup !"}
{"text":"Great spot in Centropolis area of Laval. Food is good and prices are reasonable. I usually like getting the Gyro Shovel to share and kids love the Gyro Pita and blue slush drinks."}
