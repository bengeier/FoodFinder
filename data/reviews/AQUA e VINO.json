{"text":"I dined there on two occasions. TH place was recommended by one of my \"worldly\" friends. Hands down, it was excellent. I cannot wit to go back"}
{"text":"We loved the old place, Il Nido, but this is a fantastic transition. The place is small so reservation is a must. They are new so still working out some kinks. 

We split 3 things. Beet salad, the cheese ravioli and the lamb chops. All 3 were amazing. 

The big negative I had here was the service. It took FOREVER. I think they have a small staff and a small kitchen, however you would also think with a small number of tables you would have a lot of attention. Not the case. So if you do go, plan on at least a 2 hour dinner.

The food is amazing, just be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to do a for review for months now.We've been several times. I can't say enough.Between ourselves and friends I think we've had everything on the menu! All the Primi are out of this world my favorite is the gnocchi no matter how it's served I also love the chicken\"my nonna style\".You might want to start with Dessert so as not to miss out.Best in the city and all made in house.The service is always on point and  friendly.It's so nice to see people enjoying their work.I could go on and on about Chef Grigo his staff the food the wine.Make sure to make a reservation or call a head!"}
{"text":"Spectacular! Absolutely the closest to an authentic Italian restaurant you will find in Charlotte. Trust me, I know because I am married to someone from Italy. We took his parents there and they were so impressed. They are extremely picky when it comes to eating out but loved their experience here. Wonderful authentic dining experience."}
{"text":"This is the best Italian restaurant in Charlotte, hands down. Very little publicity but oh man, the food is absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"We have celebrated a family event here and were absolutely blown away with the exquisite dishes suggested and prepared by Chef Gabriele, outstanding service and sophisticated but still casual pleasant atmosphere. We enjoyed arugula and ricotta gnocchi a lot and the rabbit roll with broccoli rabe was so juicy and tender. For dessert we had Napoleon and it was phenomenal! Made in house by the Chef himself! We will definitely come back again and again! Thank you Aqua e Vino!"}
{"text":"Real Italian food served with wonderful service! Try the primitivo wine. Fresh, unique, fantastic."}
{"text":"Third dinner at Aqua e Vino last night and it was amazing, as always. It is my favorite restaurant in Charlotte!  The chef came out and talked with us and we decide to let him pick our menu, which was out of this world delicious. The chicken with greens on top is my favorite, but the fresh pasta can't be beat. The service is second to none. It is fantastic night out with friends or date night. GO!"}
{"text":"We called for a reservation 2 weeks in advance. We walked in and we're told we didn't have a reservation because there was a party. I then asked them to check and one of the servers immediately said \"it's impossible!\" Another server said he had no record of my call. They continued to treat meet like I was stupid for showing up. Then another said she would look in the reservation book. And there it was for the next night! No one was apologetic at all. Don't waste your time!"}
{"text":"Dear God, just go! That's all I have to say.

** just a little side note I did hear the owner mentioned that they would be closing soon through till August 2018 because of construction work. So I would call ahead to make sure they were open but definitely make reservations!"}
{"text":"This place takes me back to being in Europe.  It is a very quaint and romantic place.  We started with the prosciutto and two choice cheese plate.  It was amazing, the prosciutto was hand carved right in front of us and the cheese was served with fig, honey and I believe an apricot marmalade.  We were both so happy with our selection but sad that we were getting full.  Instead of skipping dinner, we opted to split a plate of gnocchi.  I can only say it was gnocchi love.  The wine selections were also fabulous and we opted for a bottle of Italian.  The atmosphere, food and attentive staff made this evening such a wonderful evening.  We definitely will be back to try more of the amazing food & wine, plus take in the atmosphere of this quaint place."}
{"text":"This is by far the best Italian restaurant in Charlotte.  We celebrated our first wedding anniversary here after getting married in Orta San Guilio, Italy.  Our dining experience reminded us of being back there.  Every food course was impeccably prepared.  So delicious.  The lamb chops and risotto were to die for.  The cheese plates and deserts divine.  Chef Grigo made sure everything was presented properly.  Perfect for special occasions, even better to impress a first date or business associate."}
{"text":"Fantastic meal!  Best meal we ever had during Queens Feast Week.
The chef and waiter were most gracious and took care of every request.  Planning to go back next month and in December for the Truffle meals."}
{"text":"Phenomenal, amazing, wonderful. Can't come up with sufficient superlatives. Absolutely the best northern Italian- real Italian, not \"American Italian\"- in Charlotte, and for me the best and finest restaurant experience in Charlotte period, without question. There's a reason it's packed to the rafters with regulars for every seating, every night it's open. 

Chef Gabriele is phenomenally talented, yet manages to present food that is authentically \"home\", from his native region of northern Italy. I've been eating here for two years, since just after the restaurant opened, and have never had a meal or a dining experience that wasn't perfect. Chef treats you like family, and while he certainly  appreciates the regular customers, he's also welcoming to new diners. This is a very special experience, with very competent staff who know their business and work hard; they also get to know their customers and do treat regulars accordingly, so don't be surprised to hear wait staff speaking familiarly with the customers at the next table. Everyone becomes friends and family here.  

A few things to point out, if you're a first time customer:

The restaurant is very small, with maybe 40 covers total per seating, so there isn't much wiggle room for the staff if a table decides to relax and have another bottle of wine... it's not the restaurant's fault if diners take a little extra time to finish their meal, so there may sometimes be a short wait for a table to open, even with a reservation, but it's rare. 

It's very hard to get seated as a walk-in most nights, so a reservation is most definitely recommended. 

There's virtually no space inside the restaurant to wait if you're there early, so you may have to stand outside for a bit. The patio is lovely and it's nice outside. Enjoy it. The food and experience will be more than worth it.  

And yes, this is most definitely a true European restaurant, with exquisitely prepared food in portions planned for multiple courses, so if you're looking for one huge portion of pasta, red sauce on everything, lots of beer, a kid's menu, or a salad the size of a shoebox, turn left instead of right and go across the patio to Red Rocks and enjoy it. They're nice too, just a different experience. 

You'll never find better prepared food in Charlotte than Aqua E Vino. Not anywhere. Go once and try it. Go twice. Go every week. Get to know your server. Be patient; it's an intimate restaurant, and the food is prepared just for you. Get to know the chef... ask Gabriele to come out and talk about the preparation of a dish. He will be happy to talk to you if it's not crazy busy. You can't go wrong at this place; I'd eat there every night if I could. Absolutely wonderful in every way."}
{"text":"Wish I could give this place 10 stars! Best experience of my life !!! 
Excellent experience from beginning to end !
I am from Italy, so I was looking for something truly authentic! This is sometimes hard to find .
We made a reservation for 5pm on the same day, i recommend doing this as it is a very small and intimate space, you want to call ahead.
Once we arrived we were warmly welcomed by The hostess and accommodated by Franco.
The place was clean and smelled divine.
Italian tunes were playing in the background and 
Franco spoke fluent Italian as well as the owner/chef!
The chef came out to greet is personally, by this time we were the only people in the restaurant.
He brought out his meats and cheese tray and started the most beautiful charcuterie I've ever experienced, he cut everything to perfection and in perfect proportions! Meanwhile Franco delivered our freshly baked bread basket composed of a mix of focaccia bread, Grissini and home bread! Just delicious ! Then another small bread basket my husband and I were fighting over this. 
Then he asked us what we wanted and I asked him to surprise us! Did he ever!! He came out with a triple treat of pasta, risotto and kale pasta plates. They were all delicious, each with its own carefully crafted flavor I cannot tell you a favorite as they were all magnificent. I will just upload my pictures as this is so hard to express but pictures are a different story
We also had the best coconut cake dessert, one of 3 he served us. Just magnificent.
To top it off we got to meet the chefs wife who was absolutely delightful!
This was he lost intimate lovely dinner I have ever experienced and my hubby and I were in awe at the family atmosphere, I felt as if I was back home in Milano! I'm a happy girl"}
{"text":"Didn't measure up.   Based on all the positive reviews it's possible our experience was atypical but we didn't enjoy our food.  A roasted chicken dish was 2 small wheel-like slices of dry chicken wrapping an undistinguished stuffing. Very small portion.  Prosciutto appetizer was cut on the thick side, so it was tough and chewy. My wife's soup came cold.  Service was friendly but it didn't compensate for the mediocre food."}
{"text":"The best in Charlotte. By far. Call for reservations because the secret has gotten out."}
{"text":"Authenticity at it's best. The service matches the quality of their food.

By far the best Italian in Charlotte."}
{"text":"My favorite Italian restaurant in Charlotte! Very authentic and the chef is so creative. His food is amazing. Five stars!"}
{"text":"Charlotte now has four restaurants that match some of the best in the country. Aix en Provence, Barrington's, Kindred, and Aqua e Vino. We had dinner at the latter for the first time and every aspect of it was superb. The atmosphere is so inviting -- warm, cozy, and a respite from the world outside. 

It is exciting that Charlotte's restaurants are finally great."}
{"text":"Superior meal, gentle and excellent service, reminds me of a good European style restaurant, have been before and will return."}
{"text":"Belated New Years Review

Work has been chaotic since we got back from New Years since our employees have been decimated by the flu. Falling a bit behind on reviews but finally getting caught up.

Before my wife left for Pittsburgh to see her daughter, I ran across something under Yelp Events that looked interesting. It was for a Prix Fixe dinner at Aqua e Vino on New Years Eve. Actually it was for two different ones. The  first was an early one with four courses that started at 6 pm and a second larger one that started at 9 pm and lasted till Midnight aka New Years.

Considering the distance to Cornelius and not wanting to be out on the road around New Years, we chose the 6 pm flight.

Even though I hit the  \"I'm in\" response button, was not sure that was going to work so I called for reservations the following week. They are closed on Monday so that did not work and ended up leaving a voice mail the next day. Telephone tag and we finally connected and nailed it down.

Wife returns from Pittsburgh the day before and after experiencing hours of driving in a white out, was looking to a nice quiet night out.

New Years Eve arrived and after watching the Panthers Game which ended at exactly the right time, we left and drove down to Aqua e Vino. Due to construction on I-77 we had budgeted extra time but ended up arriving about 15 minutes early.

No problem. Our hosts could not have been more gracious and seated us at our assigned table and brought us water and asked if we wanted any thing to drink.  Upgraded to a nice sparkling water which was good.

This gave us a chance to survey the restaurant. Small and I would guess it probably seats around 30 or so patrons. Intimate and somewhat romantic but my wife would tell me, I'm too old for that. Very pleasant atmosphere and could enjoy the restaurant just because of the atmosphere.

The appointed hour of 6 arrived and while folks started to trickle in, the started to serve those who were there. Made for a bit uneven serving on the part of the staff but they did a great job adjusting.  Did notice that most of the patrons were regulars since everyone knew each other.

Everyone started out with a glass of Champagne and of course, a toast to the New Year.

The Antipasto came first and we had a choice of three.  One was House Cured Arctic Char (misspelled chard on the menu) and buckwheat  blinis; another was homemade foie gras \"au torchon\", porto gelee, baby greens and croutons. The last was raviolone, spinach,sheet ricotta, egg surprise, parmigiano butter and perigord truffle.

My wife ordered the Char and I ordered the foie gras.  Both of which were excellent. As for the foie gras, great texture and great balance of various flavors.

For the Primo or First Course, it was the same for all and was an enhanced Risotto with aged Parmigiano and While Truffle Lamelle.

Again excellent although I do like my Risotto a bit softer with a creamier texture but great blend on taste.

For the Secundi or  Second Course, again a choice. My wife and I both ordered the Grass Fed Beef Tenderloin with Mushroom Farcie, Maidera Glaze and Perigord Truffle . The other choice was a poached Wild Sea Bass and Lobster.

The other choice sounded great as well but the tenderloin was outstanding. Great taste and texture and presentation was outstanding.

Finally was Dolce or Desert which was a Classic Vanilla Souffle served with a hot Chocolate Sauce on the side.

Simple dish but in that is the secret to it's elegance.  Had to wait a bit for the Chocolate Sauce to cool down but it was a perfect compliment to the Souffle. A perfect end to the meal.

Perfect way to ring in the New Year.  Great Food in a Cozy Atmosphere with great Service.

If they have it available next year, will probably make a point of trying it again"}
{"text":"Awesome meal. Ingredients fresh,  food delicious, cocktails and wine list vast, and homemade dessert divine!"}
{"text":"The food was good but they made us feel like they were doing us a favor to serve us. Told us we needed to be there at either 5:30 or 8 pm when we made the reservation (in addition to providing a credit card). We chose the early time slot but ended up being the only people in the place other than one other couple that arrived after we did, for the first hour or so. Told us we had to order entire meal at once. Rushed us through the meal and told us they were out of coffee! I guess our time was up"}
{"text":"Amazing food.  Small quaint hidden gem of a restaurant.  The chef Gabriel is very talented and adds a creative personal touch to every dish.  I recommend the anti pasto meat and cheese plate where the prosciutto is fresh  carved right in front of you.  You must  make reservations as this place fills up every night."}
{"text":"This place has amazing food and service. Be careful though, this restaurant is tiny with no bar area- reservations are needed, especially on weekends. The chef is very talented and many times will come out of the kitchen to greet guests."}
{"text":"Delicious food from a real Italian chef. Finally, I found Italian food in Charlotte. Not a knock off but the real soul of an Italian kitchen. Perfection from the service to the kitchen I can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Better late than never...how could I have forgotten to write about you Aqua e Vino??!!!

Used to be they had Antipasto and Primi on Tuesdays for $35 per person. This has been replaced with the Butta Pasta program Tuesdays through Thursdays which offers Antipasto, 3 pasta dishes and dolce for $40 per person.

Aqua e Vino is small, quaint and warm - great place to enjoy a romantic dinner or have a long dinner talking with friends. I took my journey with John, Tonya and my lovely wife (bonus points).

For Antipasto/Appetizers we had the Beet Salad, Hen of the Woods Mushrooms Fritti, Grilled Octopus with Artichokes and Capers, and the Cauliflower flan. All of them were great in their own way but the Cauliflower flan was warm, creamy and unexpectedly wonderful: like baby food/comfort food for grown-ups!

For Primi we had the Gnocchi Bolognese, Shrimp Risotto and Mahi over Black Rice. We all took bites and then changed plates until everyone had a portion. Solid dishes all around but the homemade sauces like the Bolognese really stand out!

The best part - I repeat the best part was dessert! Whoever makes the pastries here has some major skill!! When they brought the dessert tray, we pretty much ordered everything. Chocolate and Hazelnut Torte, Lemon Meringue Tart, Semifreddo with Hazelnut Pralines, Pear Tart and last but not least, my favorite, Apricot and Marzipan Tart!! Seriously, they were all simply amazing!

Sorry for taking so long A e V but hopefully it was worth the wait!!!"}
{"text":"Second time I've been there. Once again the food was excellent. The space is small just 8 tables, two seatings.
You will enjoy."}
{"text":"Great little spot! Make a reservation, this place fills up quickly -- even on weeknights. Went to AQUA e VINO last night for 3rd or 4th visit. Expect updated dinner menus at reasonable"}
{"text":"Great Northern Italian food-A small restaurant but very cozy, excellent service-spectacular food"}
{"text":"One of our favorite restaurants in Charlotte. Very attentive service, great menu selection. The chef Gabriel always try to spend time with guest and explain dishes. Great Italian place."}
{"text":"The new best Italian restaurant in Charlotte. High quality of food prepared to perfection. All at a fair price and great service. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This was one of the best dining experiences my wife and I have had in Charlotte, and we have both lived here for about twenty years. We went during restaurant week for our one year anniversary so we really got to explore the menu and taste several dishes. The grilled octopus appetizer was the most tender I've ever had. My grouper and risotto entree was perfectly cooked and very well seasoned. My wife had what we thought was going to be a caprese salad but turned out to be a very refreshing cold heirloom tomato soup (almost like a gazpacho) with fresh mozzarella, a basil leaf and focaccia bread croutons. It was delicious. Her eggplant and ricotta manicotti was excellent too. It wasn't covered in melted mozzarella and not smothered in chunky, overly-flavored tomato sauce like other places do, which really let the pasta, delicate sauce, and filling stand out on this one. Desserts were homemade and light, and a perfect end to the not overly filling meal, accompanied by an espresso to keep the night going! The plating and presentation was top notch. You can tell the chefs put all their effort and passion into each dish and do not let any plate leave the kitchen that is not up to Chef Grigo's standards. It was a nice surprise to see Chef Grigo come out to the dining area and slice the prosciutto on the carving station to prepare the meat and cheese platters. He even carved us each a slice to try since he caught my wife watching him work. The fact that there are only about 8 tables in the restaurant allows for an intimate or small group dinner with great service. I highly recommend everyone give this place a try."}
{"text":"Questo ristorante è un piccolo pezzo di Italia a Charlotte! È così autentica, mi ha ispirato a scrivere questa recensione intera in italiano. Ok, on second thought, maybe not... But seriously, Aqua e Vino is so good, it's going to make you want to learn Italian and move to Italy ASAP. I lived in Italy for 4-years and what you see above is the extent of my awful, broken Italian. My crappy Italian is not the point of this review though. The point is that Aqua e Vino is one of the most authentic Italian restaurants I've had the pleasure of discovering this side of the Atlantic. 

We visited on a Wednesday for their Butta la Pasta special. For $40 per person, your table gets to enjoy a huge, family style spread of charcuterie and cheese to start (you can also opt to choose 3 anitipasti to share, but we love meat and cheese so that was a no brainer for us!), followed by your choice of 3 pastas and all wrapped up with a sampling of their desserts. Every dish was a hit, the wine selection was great, service was spot on and the atmosphere was small and intimate. 

I loved how leisurely and meandering the meal was. We lingered for 2+ hours but never felt like there was a lull in service. Our group of 12 filled the time with amazing food and wine and friendly conversation. It's hard to pick a favorite part of the evening, but if I had to narrow it down to a handful, it would be the bottle of chianti (I love a good chianti!), the tagliatelle with duck ragu (mmmmmm!) and fresh, pillowy, housemade gnocchi, and the berry cake made with Greek yogurt. Oh! and I almost forgot the fresh whipped cream. So, maybe a little more than a handful of favorites. 

I am literally counting down to the next special occasion for an excuse to visit again. Who has a birthday or anniversary that needs celebrating??"}
{"text":"The owner came to our table and made recommendations, the food was delicious, and the experience excellent. Quiet inviting atmosphere, personable, and quaint. You would not expect such a great experience, but while there a number of repeat customers were met with hugs.  Add this place to you list of stops!"}
{"text":"Still drooling thinking about the dinner I had last night at AQUA e VINO.  We had had this place ear-marked for the longest time and the universe finally aligned so that we could meet and enjoy this place.

First off... if you rely on your GPS, the address for the restaurant is a bit wonky and you will end up behind it.  The key is to just park on either end (Fresh Market parking lot or the lot in front of Red Rocks) and then wander into the small alley to find the entrance to AQUA e VINO.

Really intimate space, but still warm and relaxed.  Our server was very friendly and we started a great meal with some bubbles.  She did know the menu very well as we peppered her with questions and recommendations.

Since it was Tuesday, they do a $35 Antipasti & Primi (or Secondi) with a dessert.  Our group ended up going this route and then we played \"pass the plate\" clockwise to try a little bit of everything.  I ordered the octopus appetizer and house made gnocchi.  We ended our meal with so many pastries and the delicious semifredo.

Overall the experience was a great one.  There was a large table (8) that were celebrating a birthday that night.  With how small the restuarant was, it was hard not so jump in and sing the birthday celebrant into a new year. We all left with lots of laughs and a ton of pictures of food that I'll be thinking about for a long long time."}
{"text":"What a great evening. Such a pretty, quiet, romantic spot. The menu changes daily. The food is incredible, and the service perfect. The timing between courses could not have been better. We were able to talk and enjoy our wine without feeling rushed. 
We split the octopus, the linguine with clams and the filet which had fresh tomatoes and a soft, delicate cheese....perfect."}
{"text":"Wooohooo I won a free meal voucher from Yelp's 2015 Charlotte Restaurant Week giveaway to Aqua e Vino so I was super excited to try this place out. Free food is basically my favorite thing ever. 

Making a reservation was a bit of a process. I am a spoilt millennial and it has been ages since I made reservations without an online option. It took 3 calls but we finally snagged a Sunday night reservation (they are not typically open Sunday but made an exception for restaurant week). 

Basically as soon as I received the certificate I eagerly pulled up their menu. I was bamboozled by that amount of unfamiliar Italian words so I did extensive googling before we reached the restaurant. Turns out all the wait staff were happy to answer questions on the menu. They provided complimentary bread and marinara sauce which were both delicious. 

I started with the Bresaola Cornet which was my first time eating bresaola and robiola cheese and they made a completely delicious combo! The boyfriend was adventurous and ordered the Fritto Piemontese - sweet bread, polenta, sausage, apple. I had never had sweet bread before either and the sample I had was interesting and tasted better when combined with the apple. The sausage was amazing! 

For the main I ordered the Catch of the Day \"Pesce Al Cartoccio\" which was a tropical fish I had never heard of. It came wrapped in the parchment sheet it was baked in. This was a novel experience and I am still unaware of the proper way to unwrap a meal. The fish was good but a bit dry but the vegetables baked under it had a great flavor. 

For dessert he ordered the mixed berry tart and I had the Pesche Farcite both of which were excellent. The entire meal was an adventure of new tastes and everything was wonderful. We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"We had an excellent dinner. The chef spent time with us describing his dishes and just talking with us. It felt like a nice dinner with friends. They offer indoor and outdoor seating. Our food was very tasty."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Every. Time. Gabriele is phenomenal, he always has something new cooking up and it is ALWAYS great. We've tried Sunday brunch/lunch served family style, we've tried a wine paired dinner (three times) and we even held our daughter's first communion luncheon there. All fantastic. I'm stingy with my five star reviews, this restaurant easily deserves one."}
{"text":"Amazing! Before going, I had only ever heard good things from coworkers. Boy were they right! The food was outstanding and the service was impeccable. I will absolutely recommend this place and I'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"I liked the quaint setting of Aqua e Vino in Strawberry Hill. The chef sent us donuts as a filler because the kitchen was a bit behind. Nice touch. The donuts were more savory than sweet, but good. 

The wine list @ Aqua e Vino is extensive (hence the namesake?) and I ordered a glass or two of red. We shared the Octopus as an appetizer and, for my main meal, I ordered the Salmon w/ butternut squash.

My food was well cooked and presented well. I consider Aqua e Vino a \"pretty food\" restaurant with relatively small portions, hearty prices, and a smallish menu. It feels like a special night out restaurant and you could see and taste the chef's talents. I didn't 'love' the hard bread personally (which is probably an authentic Italian restaurant bread choice) but I don't need the extra bread anyway. :)

Great place for a special night or date. Make a reservation!"}
{"text":"Simply fabulous. My husband and I went for restaurant week and everything we ate was super delicious!! The service was top notch too. The servers here really know how to connect with the diners. Very tiny inside and slightly cramped, but they do well with the space and make you feel comfortable."}
{"text":"I was recently invited by some friends to Aqua e Vino for Pasta Night. Pasta Night is a family style meal, offered on  Wednesday for $40 per person. The evening starts with some amazing rolls with marinara, followed by charcuterie, then three pastas served family style and desserts.

From the minute we arrived, we were treated like royalty. Drink orders were taking and an overview of the evening was provided. We decided to take advantage of the family style meal. We started with charcuterie, which included several meats and cheeses, some olives and breads. The selections were amazing, loved every bite.
On to the pasta! From the menu, we selected the Fregola with Clams, Pappardelle with Duck Ragu and Gnocchi. All were amazing, but the Pappardelle with the Duck Ragu was my favorite! You can tell the pasta is homemade, and the accompaniments were cooked to perfection, all served piping hot.
To top the evening off we enjoyed a platter of desserts, which included a chocolate cake, berry layered cake, coconut cake and homemade whipped cream. A perfect way to end the evening!

I cannot stop thinking about the meal, and cannot wait to return.
Reservations are definitely recommended as this is an intimate atmosphere with a small setting. So, definitely consider next time you are craving an amazing Italian dinner for a special event. Aqua e Vino is worth it!"}
{"text":"We recently went here for dinner because we saw that it got great reviews on Yelp and trip advisor, however, I beg to differ. We had dinner reservations for 5, we showed up a little early and it was about 32 degrees outside and they absolutely did not open their doors until 5pm sharp. They unlocked the front door but did not open the doors for us, so we let ourselves in. The waitstaff is all male, they are extremely sarcastic and rude. One of the waiters knocked my mothers purse off her chair and did not apologize. Our waiter was very rude and sarcastic probably shouldn't be in the restaurant business. The way menu is set up they want you to order an anti pasta, primi then second, or three meals essentially. Each meal ranges from $25-$35, so
If you order the way they suggest you're looking at $80-$100 a person. The portion sizes are \"European\" or what we would consider kid size portions. A side salad cost $13 and it was 5 little pieces of lettuce it was a joke. They were all out of Pinot noir and most beers? I ordered the Roasted Eggplant Ravioli which was $22, the food took 45 minutes to come out and there was a measly 5 ravioli on my plate (what a joke)! If you want my honest opinion, save your money and go to a less expensive restaurant with bigger portion sizes, this place was ridiculous!"}
