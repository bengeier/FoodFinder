{"text":"Very nice place for a Sunday lunch. We started out with a side of Baba Ghanouj. First time ever trying it before. Awesome! Then a buddy and I split the Filet Lamb Kabob. Really, really good! Meat was very tender and juicy. All the portions were reasonably large, definitely enough to split the main dish. Especially getting the dinner size. Our server was very sweet and did a great job despite a large party going on. The only problem is that it's not enough different from Aladdin's. Pretty much the exact same restaurant."}
{"text":"I've been here twice for lunch and once for dinner.  The service and food have been great each time.  We've enjoyed the mixed drinks, wine, hummus, falafel, salads, sandwiches and baklava.  Even for those not familiar with Mediterranean cuisine there are good kabobs and salmon on the menu too."}
{"text":"Outstanding wine, appetizers, entrees and ambiance!  We highly recommend Saaj for a special night out or a quick, casual dining experience after a long day."}
{"text":"I really had high hopes for this restaurant. Solon needs more independently owned ethnic restaurants. My husband I ordered two falafel saaj-wiches and fries. Fries were great, but the falafel was really dry. Also, the sandwiches were put together so that all the tomato, humus, etc was on only one half of the sandwich, so my first half was just bites if dry falafel.  It was a disappointment.  Maybe an off night??"}
{"text":"Fast seating, friendly staff, and better Mediterranean than Aladdin's!  Incredibe restaurant!"}
{"text":"I was in town for the weekend with friends. We stumbled upon Saaj and were very pleased with the food and service. We shared an appetizer platter and each had entrees. Each was flavorful and delicious! Excellent food!"}
{"text":"Another great Yelp find! We were in Solon for a movie and were so glad to find this place. Hummus outstanding. Lamb kabob very good. Also enjoyed the Lebanese beer. Friendly, prompt service and restaurant is open late.   We'll come again if we're in Solon."}
{"text":"Spouse and I have been here several times, and each visit has been enjoyable. Today we are sitting outside. Aurora road is not the champs élysées , but the shrubbery helps. We both recommend the falafel. Either salad or sandwich. Both great. Crispy outside, soft and tender inside.  Spicy but not too, \"a party in your mouth\" says spouse, imitating a comment by our foody youngest daughter. Fresh warm  pita starts the meal with an olive oil sesame and semic (? Crushed dried red cherries) dip. My only wish is for draft beer. Bottled only. Minor point. I can't wait to come back for belly-dancers on first Fridays. Spouse says \"ok!\"  You read it here. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Good middle eastern food in Solon. This american-middle eastern restaurant is a good destination for an informal/family dinner in the Solon area. The food was all well prepared and service was prompt. The location is near a busy road making the outdoor seating less desirable."}
{"text":"Have been here multiple times and it is incredible. By far the best hummus around and just great food in general. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I'm reading all these reviews and I'm a little surprised. My experience wasn't so great.  I sat outside where I was only one of two tables out there, for lunch at about 1:30 on a Sat.  I asked if i could put the umbrella down at the empty table next to me because it was blocking the sun and was told NO because if someone else came... there were plenty of other tables for that someone else to choose from and it was late for there to be a lunch crowd still coming.  When ordering, I asked for the mixed veggies but without the rice/bulgur that it came with.  I was told no, they couldn't accommodate.  It wasn't busy at all and certainly it would take no more time to leave OFF something?  I asked for a salad with only romaine, no iceberg as listed in the ingredients.  I was told no - it has to have the iceberg. I tried to order one of the salads that you can choose the meat you want for an additional price, but i wanted it without the meat.  I was told that additional amount would still be applied (i forgot the amount, maybe $5?) and was advised maybe I shouldn't order that salad. I was just so blown away with how UNaccommodating they were.  Everything was NO.  They did, however, bring out my mixed veggies without the rice/bulgur (to my surprise) so I'll give them that.  Unfortunately, the veggies were swimming in oil.  I was dyeing for a healthy meal and was so excited to discover a Lebanese restaurant in my neck of the woods (Solon).  I couldn't get health here.  I poured the oil into another dish and wiped the oil with napkins....  It was a bummer.   Anyway, maybe it was a bad waitress (who said no to everything)?  Who knows.  The food was good, even though not healthy.  I'd give them another chance in a few months from now as I think they will find that they cannot survive without becoming more accommodating.  Too many other restaurants to choose from, and with Taza not too far away who accommodates just fine, they need to step it up!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Best hummus around and the lamb dishes are outstanding. The servers are clearly well trained and they did a great job hiring. Service is prompt and friendly. This is my new favorite restaurant in Solon - lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"A buddy and just ate lunch there today.  The place is really nice inside, clean and overall a great atmosphere.  We were greated when we entered, our waitress was on point and the manager/owner (I think) stoppped said hello, came back asked how everything was and made a point to say good bye to to visit again.  Exceptional service from start to finish.  We ordered the Hummus with their hot sauce, the pita bread and all of the sauces were out of this world.  Then the Chicken Shawarma was excellent (i ordered it with the garlic sauce) and it came with a great side salad for only 9 bucks.  I will be returning to this location often, i suggest you do the same."}
{"text":"So happy to have Saaj in Solon -- a reliable Middle Eastern gem close to home! Casual environment. Minimalist decor. Huge portions. Great service. Flavorful, authentic Lebanese cuisine. Nothing more, nothing less.   I have been here five or six times and the service and food are consistently excellent. Have yet to be disappointed by an entree, appetizer, or service in general. Whatever you get, be sure to ask for hot sauce on the side -- tangy, piquant, and just plain delish.  Great place for a simple, low-key date night, family dinner, or lunch with coworkers."}
{"text":"This place is always good. The portion sizes are hardy especially their grape leaves appetizer. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance. Felt like we were dining among friends. Even after we told them we were using a living social coupon.   The lamb was tender, flavorful and ample. The garlic and hot sauces excellent and no sugar! I have a limited diet and Kate was accommodating, helpful and honest!  The falafel was typical and good. My husband had the combination. We both agreed my lamb was better than his chicken or beef. He enjoyed the kafta and it was fresh and flavourful. All our fellow customers were happy, jovial and energetic. The place felt alive. It was refreshing.  We will go back."}
{"text":"Married into a Lebanese family, so the bar was set pretty high, this place was amazing!!! Their kibeh neyyie (raw kibeh) was outstanding!!! Will return many times to this location for sure! Bringing the in laws next time. The lemonade (fresh squeezed at the bar) was so good."}
{"text":"very impressed!  My husband and I recently moved to Solon and were looking for new restaurants.  We ate Middle Eastern food a lot while living in Chicago.   When we saw this restaurant open, we were excited to try it.  Boy were we impressed!  The food was fantastic!!  We ordered an appetizer platter of hummus, baba ghanoush, tabouli and falafel.   Fantastic!  I think the best falafel we've ever eaten.  A friend ordered the mudardara and it was wonderful.  My husband and I split the chick shawarma sandwich and the kebob combination plate.  Delicious!    And, they have a children's menu that includes chicken tenders and fries.  Great news since my 3 year old still doesn't eat anything but a few dishes!  We are really excited to eat here again.  They offer take out, which is even more exciting for us!"}
{"text":"I just think this is the best Mediterranean I Cleveland.  Service is excellent and the shawarma is excellent.  Try it and you will love.  William and Byron are awesome .. Be sure to say hi to them."}
{"text":"As I have mentioned in other Yelp reviews, I absolutely LOVE Middle Eastern cuisine.  Saaj did not disappoint!   I've been looking forward to trying this place for some time.  My daughter and I arrived mid-afternoon on a Saturday.   There were a few other guests inside and also outside on the patio.  We were seated right away and greeted by our server.  We ordered tabouli, and saajwiches (rolled pita sandwiches).  I ordered the falafel and my daughter ordered the Chicken Shawarma.  Shortly after placing our order we received palm-sized pieces of warm, freshly made flatbread and a dish filled with zahtar.  The bread was fluffy and tasty and the zahtar was a great accompaniment.  The tabouli arrived shortly thereafter.  The portion was huge and the ingredients were fresh and tasty.  Our entrees arrived....2 very large rolled pita sandwiches, accompanied by fresh hot fries (there is also the choice of a side salad).  The sandwiches were toasted and filled with fresh ingredients.   The sandwiches were so large, that we each packed 1/2 of our sandwiches in to-go boxes.  Our beverages were promptly refilled and our server was prompt, courteous and accommodating.  All in all this was a great meal.   I can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Was there for lunch. Good food, Nice ambiance. What else do you need"}
{"text":"This restaurant just opened in Solon and it's a gem.  We had the hummus which is one of the best we've ever tasted.  The falafels and mujadara were absolutely delicious.  Service and atmosphere completed the experience in a very positive way. We will definitely be back very soon."}
{"text":"Love Mediterranean food! So when Living Social had a deal for this place, I bought it right away so we can try Saaj. Our first time here. Restaurant was nicely layed out, friendly staff, a great variety on the menu. Excellent service by Roosevelt! Food was great, but a bit overpriced... especially for the portions received. My first time there, I figured I'd go for the gold and got the Mishwee Combo Kabob platter for $20. Again, it was great, but I expected more for $20. There just wasn't enough of everything, including the rice. I'd be okay with the portions if it was priced a little more appropriately. I'll likely be back to try again, though."}
{"text":"Good prices great food. Really enjoyed the lamb kabobs.  We had take out so nothing to say about the staff really. The girl on the phone was nice and helpful and the staff was friendly when I paid inside.  The inside is nice. Looked clean and well decorated. I would love to eat on their patio sometime.  Will definitely go again."}
{"text":"What a surprise! As a longtime resident of Solon, I've seen 3 restaurants attempt this location only to leave, dejected and probably a little angry, within a year or months. It's close to everything \"downtown,\" with ample parking, and in a well-lit, easy to find corner of the shopping center. For some reason, previous restaurants ranging from an Asian buffet to sushi bar have all fallen flat.  I think Saaj is here to stay. My friend and I caught up over dinner here tonight and the food, service, and ambiance were all commendable.  I don't recommend coming here for a fancy night out or a date, as it's strictly for families and is table-cloth-less. The layout is not unique, with booths in back and larger tables on a landing a few steps below, but the renovators really did an excellent job painting the place bright shades of red and orange, adding in some high-class lighting behind the bar, and coordinating furniture with the desired laid-back clime.  We ordered the sampler mezza with hummus, baba ganoush, tabbouli, and falafel. Best falafel I've had in the Midwest, hands down. Taza doesn't even come close. My beloved Mamoun's in NYC has a formidable challenger, too. The falafel stole the show, but the tabbouli and baba were also excellent and perfect for mopping up with the steady pita refills.   Note: they give you pitas and a dipping oil at the very beginning, so you might be able to skip the appetizers, especially the pita-based ones. We were gluten happy by the time our entrees came. I had the house lentil soup, which was the perfect temperature. The bowl size is perfect for a dinner portion, but combined with the sampler platter, I had too much food! Never a bad thing. The soup is vastly improved by vigorously squeezing the lemon slice they give you. Wonderful aromas and tastes like home-cooking, if I were Lebanese and this were my home cooking?  My friend had the falafel sandwich, which came with an attractive side salad.   We each owed $15 with tip, which was incredible considering the quality of food and the attentiveness of the service. It's a shame it's not more walkable from other parts of town, or I think this would be a formidable watering hole for large parties. The bar is stylish and the drinks looked like bargains.  I highly recommend Saaj for your next night out, or even for a solo culinary experience! It's about time Solon expanded its ethnic food offerings, and Saaj hits it out of the park."}
{"text":"This is a very nice find in the eastern suburbs. The hummus and fatouche salad were excellent and the falafel might have been the best I've ever had.  The pita possibly was baked on premise and was warm and excellent. We went there on New Year's Eve and the menu was shortened so we were forced to order main courses and not sandwiches. I ordered the lamb kebab which was good but had too many tough bits of meat and arrived cold along with the couscous. Other members of the party had similar issues. Go there and eat Lebanese style with casual appetizers and you will love it, it's the real deal."}
{"text":"The tabbouli was really light, fresh, and flavorful. Unfortunately the beef shawarma wasn't what we were expecting at all. as it was served with paper-thin lavash-eque bread that couldn't hold up to the large chunks of beef that were unfortunately quite fatty."}
{"text":"I'm almost always in the mood for Lebanese, so I was excited to try out Saaj after a long day of work. Saaj is fairly large, but it feels very cosy and I like that there is a variety of seating to appeal to a variety of tastes.   While I found the food to be tasty--the warmed pita refills were a nice touch--I didn't find it as exceptional as the reviews had led me to believe. Except for the hot hummus. That was great! 10/10, would nom again. But as for the rest of the food... to be honest, when it came down to it, it tasted just like Aladdin's--which isn't a bad thing, to be sure. I just expected a bit more... oomph. Tasty, filling, but not really exceptional. Makes for great comfort food, though.  I hope to return as the spicy hummus was delicious and I'd like to try some of their falafel as well as their lamb dishes--with a side of the hot sauce that is recommended so many times on here. Definitely a place to add to your restaurant list if you're in the Solon area!  (Yes, I realize this review is full of contradictions, which is how I feel about it. On the one hand, I had a great and filling meal. On the other, I walked out feeling like something was missing from my dinner.)"}
{"text":"Love this place, awesome food! Great choices for a vegan."}
{"text":"Please allow me to add my five stars to this wonderful restaurant.  The food is fantastic! I have probably had most of their non beef menu over the last five visits both for lunch and for dinner. Highlights include an amazing baba ghanouj, unlimited pita, a unique dipping sauce (hint - dig down deep under the oil for the REAL sauce), and other unique dishes. Portions are large, food is very tasty, and the service is fantastic. If I had any criticism, I wish they had a little bit more diverse menu especially for the chicken and fish dishes."}
{"text":"First time at this new restaurant and glad to see that is managed by someone who has years of experience with Lebanese restaurants and in fact is from Lebanon.  Loved the Mudardara, made with lentils, rice, some vegetables and caramelized onions and seasoned with traditional Lebanese spices.  My wife had the chicken kabob with rice.    And to drink the freshly made limeade hit the spot.  We highly recommend this new addition to Solon"}
{"text":"My mother and I came in earlier today for lunch. We were seated, and proceeded to watch for over 45 minutes as people who came in much later than us were served. After an hour with no service, we left. Atrocious and shameful. We won't be returning."}
{"text":"Place has excellent food and also very nice inside. If you are a fan of Taza in Woodmere, do yourself a favor and try this place. I highly recommend and endorse this place as the food and service are simply fantastic."}
{"text":"Tried Saaj today after reading some great reviews here on Yelp. Everything was so fresh and delicious with good size portions and reasonable prices. The hot/spicy sauce is really good. I had a chicken shawarma sandwich on Saaj bread and it was excellent. My wife had the chicken soup and a $5 house salad that was huge. The roasted red pepper hummus with some hot/spicy sauce on the side was the best we have ever had. The owner or manager made a point of checking on every table.....you gotta love a place that cares! Try Saaj soon, you will be glad you did."}
