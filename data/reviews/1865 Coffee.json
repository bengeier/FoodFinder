{"text":"Quaint, comfortable, lots of table space. A great place to read for an hour (or three)."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Their baristas are so nice and friendly!! There is plenty of tables and free WiFi!! Also they just started serving gourmet grilled cheese and bagels!! I get an iced tea or hot cocoa and a grilled cheese!! It is a great environment to do my homework and it's really close to ASU!!!"}
{"text":"I really like the environment and coffee was delicious, it's a nice quaint place very cozy! They also had really good cupcakes when I went in, nice sweet treats."}
{"text":"Hidden gem of Tempe!  The most affordable coffee place around. Free bagel Tuesday. Lots of tables and seating. Not too noisy. Perfect for studying or a work meeting.  Sadly hours are 8-5 and limited during spring break when students are not available for work."}
{"text":"This place is gorgeous! Delicious coffee, chill atmosphere, and free Wifi. Definitely going to become my new work spot on campus."}
{"text":"Great prices for yummy strong coffee!  Has all the amenities of a pricey cafe and more. Quiet and perfect for studying."}
{"text":"Great coffee, and really chill vibe! I went to catch up with a friend and we loved it! The coffee is delicious and the service was great!"}
{"text":"Has a coffee shop every felt like home?  1865 is hands down the best coffee shop I've been to in the State of Arizona. Not only is the coffee high quality, but it's one of the most affordable spots in all of Tempe with numerous options (I got a medium salted caramel latte for $2.65!!! and they threw in a free bagel). The baristas are genuinely kind and make conversation with you. I've always had a good experience and left feeling like I made a friend. There's plenty of seating here as well, free wifi, and positive vibes stenciled on the walls keeping you motivated and optimistic as you do your work. Now that I've come here a few times, I'm making it my go-to study spot for all these reasons and more. I love its proximity to ASU, it can be a little difficult to spot initially since its next to the Salvation Army store and there's not apparent sign. But its worth looking for because once you find it, you will fall in love.   They're also on the Hooked App! So everyday you can grab their coffee and grilled cheese on an even lower discount. Hallelujah"}
{"text":"Great local coffee shop right next to ASU's Main / Tempe campus! I grab my dirty chai & a bagel for only $6 then I'm good to go. So not just coffee but you can also grab a bagel & cream cheese or a grilled cheese! Great coffee's from all over the world that are certified fair trade. Great service 1865 team.   It's kind of a hidden gem, but it's just west of Chuck box on the north side of University. Also I noticed they have a stage where you can hear live music, acoustic, poetry, etc on a weeknight. It reminds me of a shop in Austin TX. The best part is since it's a Salvation Army ran coffee shop, your money goes to help fund their adult & youth programs! It's like your directly donating for a good cause. Thanks guys for being awesome & serving the Tempe community!"}
{"text":"There cold brew Is so good! Grill cheese also amazing. Friendly staff. They serve both fair trade coffee and locally roasted/owned coffee.Worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Every time I've come in the person working is always genuinely nice and not robotic like at Dutch bros. I've only ever had the lattes and mochas before but they're really good, and the large iced comes with 4 shots in a 24 oz cup and is only $4! I will be coming back many times."}
{"text":"I love the coffee which was great and the atmosphere was amazing! It was a super comfortable environment!"}
{"text":"Really excited about this new business! The space is really cool, there are lots of tables and free wifi, so it's a perfect place to study while getting a caffeine fix. They also support the Salvation Army that is right next door by donating a portion of their proceeds to them. The coffee is SUPER  cheap."}
{"text":"Great coffee! My favorite is the hot turtle mocha and they also serve bagels. The staff is friendly and the atmosphere is calming. Great place to do homework, get work down or sit and chat with a friend."}
{"text":"I was glad I checked the time for when they close (which is 2PMfor summer hours) because I would have missed out on this delicious cold brew and free bagel (on Tuesdays)! The gentleman who helped me was so sweet and made sure I was taken care of for my order! I thought the prices here were extremely reasonable, especially for being in the heart of a college town. I work down the street so I was able to walk there and take a few minutes to read my book. So quiet and calming in there. I can see myself doing some work or just sitting and reading for a while.  I would assume this is a common place for college students to go to during the school year but I appreciated it being completely dead so I could have some silence. I got my punch card and I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Excellent coffee & service. Lots is open space and free WiFi. Great location if visiting ASU."}
{"text":"A hidden coffee gem in Tempe!   I can't believe I've lived in Tempe for years and have not heard of 1865! It is a small shop, in between the Salvation Army station and Shady Park. The baristas are super sweet and kind, and are fast to deliver your coffee. 1865 also has a \"Pay It Forward\" program, where you can donate a dollar and a coffee sleeve to help someone else get a cup of coffee. I adore the fact that 1865 is giving back to the community!    Great place to get work done or hold meetings, as the shop is relatively quiet all the time.   Also, free bagel Tuesday! What's not to love?"}
{"text":"A smaller, but cool atmosphere to hang out, study, read, or work on your laptop. The coffee was pretty good too, the only bad thing I have to say is that they had a huge list of intricate and cool sounding coffees in their menu (which I studied for a good 10 minutes and then decided on one) but then when I went up to the woman working the register she said they no longer had any of those intricate coffees anymore and that she should have told my friend and I. Oh well! But the coffee I did get was served to me immediately, and the woman was very nice."}
