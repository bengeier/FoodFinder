{"text":"What a GREAT restaurant!  We're new to Solon, but Jimmy Dadonna's has quickly become a favorite.  HUGE portions -- we always count on having enormous leftovers.  We come here for anything from pasta (yum!) to carbonara (yum!) to pizza (yum! yum!).  In fact, it's our favorite pizza place in town, too!"}
{"text":"Staying on Solon overnight, looking for good Italian and went to Jimmy Dadonna's. Nice clean atmosphere, good menu at reasonable prices. Food was good, but my wife's Lasagna was served tepid to cold. She didn't say anyting until I took a bite and realized it...she didn't want to mess with it. My egplan parm was tasty. Meatballs were good, but a littl bready. Service was friendly, but a little slow. All in all, I'd go back next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Garlic balls, garlic balls, garlic balls!!!  I love me some Jimmy Dadonna's garlic balls!  Ordered some Jimmy Dadonna's take out last night. Love the house salad dressing and enjoyed my cheese ravioli.  Most meals serve 2-3 people so splitting is ideal.  Reasonable prices for the large portions!!  Best part of the meal has to be the bread! The restaurant also has a bar and outside seating area. Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Good food, but NOT family friendly. When we had a moms group come to their restaurant (and they knew this in advance) they only had three high chairs and three booster chairs. 

They  were not very accommodating - I would not bring my children there again or a mom's group."}
{"text":"The service has usually been hit or miss. The food has always been great.   The garlic knots are the best.  I always get the chicken marsala and in 19 years have not been disappointed.  The salads are fresh.  Normally we have to take the side spaghetti home. The food has been consistent.   Sorry to hear they are closing after 30 years.  So, if you want delicious Italian food, please stop in before they close or you could be kicking yourself.  They will truly be missed by my family."}
{"text":"The food is very, very good. The portions are huge. (I'll bet you take half home!) The garlic rolls are to die for. Service is good. One of my Italian friends drives 25 miles to eat here. - - - Value = 5 stars."}
{"text":"I will definitely be stopping by Jimmy's to enjoy his place and show support for a great Solon restaurant establishment before January 1st. I can only suggest others do the same. Buon Appetito!"}
{"text":"Last few visits have been disappointing.  They do not have enough help.  Food was good but service was awful.   I felt sorry for our server so we didn't ask for more coffee, beer or even stay for dessert.
Previous visit, the server seemed harassed...wasn't friendly...Didn't want to ask for anything. 
Jimmy you need more help and they need to.be friendly...hostess also seemed harassed.  She pitched in to help...but wasn't welcoming to us."}
{"text":"Despite posted online they close at 9pm and I got there at 8:55pm. They were very understanding and let me place a take out pizza order and sat at the bar to have a drink or two while I waited. The bartender also offered all of the left over rolls that remained from the evening for free. The pizza was good and the toppings were fresh. If you're here from out of town and need a place to eat in the area I would swing by."}
{"text":"This place has always been my favorite Italian place to go in the city of Cleveland.  Everything from the food to atmosphere makes each visit enjoyable.  The portions are very good size and the prices are easy on the wallet.  Of course I love the garlic nubs and the house salad dressing.  I'm pretty easy going and mostly go with the pasta and meat sauce.  Tried the location on the westside and it doesn't compare to the original!"}
{"text":"Fair Italian food with generous portions.  The service was not spectacular but overall not a bad place."}
{"text":"This is the best Italian restaurant in the entire world.  I have never been to Italy but I assume if I do go, I will say \"This food is great, but not nearly as great as Jimmy Daddona's\".  I've been a patron of theirs for a long time - before they moved to the Enterprise Parkway area - and I will continue to be a loyal customer until the restaurant closes or the world ends, whichever happens first.  Why?  First, the garlic rolls.  Second, the Italian house dressing.  Third, the garlic rolls dunked in the house dressing.  Fourth, the aglio e olio white pizza.  Fifth, the veal aglio e olio.  Sixth, the chicken parmigiana.  Seventh, the fettuccini alfredo.  No eighth - I'm drooling."}
{"text":"Very good food and large portions. The Ma√Ætre de was very pleasant and helpful, but the wait-staff was kind of brusque. The decor and ambiance were nice, but maybe not nice enough to warrant the price. With tax & tip, I paid $75 for dinner for two (with an appetizer and 1 drink each). The overall experience felt more like the total should have been in the $40-$50 range."}
{"text":"Really love this place! Been here twice now. Service has been great. McKala does a great job and makes some awesome drinks! Try the clam appetizer!"}
{"text":"This is a good neighborhood spot, very welcoming and friendly. But that's not where the compliments end. The food is good but there are some hit or misses. However, they're more hits than misses, one such hit is the spaghetti and meatballs. Another hit is the chicken Marsala, a little lighter sauce then I'm used to but still a good entree. One noticeably missing item is the ubiquitous Italian dish chicken piccata. On one night there I asked them to make it for me, they did and it was a big miss. Overall good food, good atmosphere, great service and wonderful garlic knots!"}
{"text":"We visited this place due to the great reviews on yelp.  I could not disagree more.  The restaurant is dingy.  Our appetizer plates were dirty.  Should have left then.   We asked our server to make some recommendations and she just told us to order whatever we like, which I found strange...  We went very early and there were only a few others in the restaurant.  Those garlic rolls taste like they have been deep fried in butter and incredibly salty.  They are gross fat bombs as was the rest of the food we ate.  The large amount of salt  was a problem because it was very difficult to get refills on water due to the horrible service.  It took over an hour to get the dinner, which was way too much food  and quite frankly not very hot.  I ordered the chicken marsala and realized that the chicken was not cooked thoroughly and pink on the inside.  OMG!  Unfortunately our server was nowhere to be found, so I sent it back with another server who never even bothered to share that important data.  So I ate some of my husbands veal which slathered in way too much hollandaise sauce.   I can't remember the last time I had a meal this bad.  I am praying I do not get sick."}
{"text":"I have been a fan of Jimmy Dadonna's since it was a tiny storefront on Station Street.  I love the garlic nubs, the cavatelli, and the portions that are large enough to share (or to eat as leftovers for days later).  The service is unpredictable, sometimes great, sometimes pathetic, and the front desk is always chaotic and frenzied, but the food and the overall atmosphere makes up for it.  If you're in the Solon area, and have a craving for great, reasonable Italian, check out Dadonna's."}
{"text":"Well...  I came back again.  I tried the lasagna this time and it was probably the best meal yet.  Unfortunately they are scheduled to close down the restaurant on December 22,2016.  I was told that the owner was done and ready to retire.  I am happy for him.  I hope he enjoys retirement.  I am told that it is everything it is supposed to be."}
{"text":"Still the best. Been going there for 20 years. Great food. Great value.  $9 for huge bowl pasta includes salad and best rolls in town. Pizza excellant too."}
{"text":"Our food was good but nothing amazing.  The portions were ridiculously huge.  My Alfredo with shrimp was too heavy but the shrimp were large and well cooked.  I do have to say that the cheesecake was delicious and apparently made homemade in house.  Overall, in Solon, a nice restaurant."}
{"text":"This place was good, not great. 

Came here on lunch with some coworkers and on this particular day they opened late due to some technical reason or another... They opened at noon and had a sign on the door.. since we got there at 11:45 we were ok to wait.

Maybe what ever delay they had put the server in a bad mood because she was not super helpful and friendly.    A few times when we asked for something she seemed frustrated and said \"I am very busy, I will try to get that when I can\"... actually more than once.... strange... we were forgiving of that because it was getting busy.

We mostly got pizza's and I got a chicken dish.  It was ok, and everyone enjoyed their pizzas.   I really like the garlic rolls in the beginning... they were super good."}
{"text":"Some of the best Italian I've had in some time.  HUGE portions with the feel of real home cooking - fantastic place.  Casual dining room with outdoor seating available as well.  Service was above average.  Dining room could be a little more intimate but it wasnt bad at all.  Appeared as if they hadnt been in the space for long.  Probably because they ran out of room at the old place...they really seem to draw the people."}
{"text":"I have been a patron of this fine restaurant for the past 20 years, ever since they were  tucked away in a strip mall on Station Street.  Generous portions and delicious entrees have always been standard, but the prices are unbeatable. Every entree comes with a side salad and garlic knots. Among my favorite dishes are the Salmon Picatta - a filet served in a lemon butter white wine sauce with capers, spaghetti marinara(chunky tomato sauce), and of course the garlic knots, which are to die for.  Additionally, the pizza is superb and is made to order with a variety of toppings.  Having eaten at just about every Italian restaurant in Northeast Ohio, Jimmy Daddonas continues to be my favorite and is usually my first choice for Italian food.  I would say that it is definitley the best in Solon, and one of the top 10 in Cuyahoga County."}
{"text":"Service was slow, which is unacceptable when there's only 2 occupied tables. Food was good, but a bit pricey. Worth a try, but keep your expectations low."}
{"text":"First timer.  My brother has recommended I check out Jimmy Daddonas and never had a chance to. Went last night for a late dinner with a friend and we both agreed that the garlic buns are to die for.  The house dressing was great.  We had the cheese ravaoli with marinara sauce.  Excellent.  Would highly recommend and will be going back with my group of friends that like to find non chain restaurants to eat at."}
{"text":"I wish it were possible to give half stars as the 3.5 stars this restaurant has is right on in my estimation. I gave it 4 as I always like to give a place the benefit of the doubt. 

It's a very solid traditional Italian restaurant, but it's not an outstanding one. I went here on a Tuesday night with a business partner and it wasn't very crowded, we were seated immediately. The server was on top of her game, everything was timely and she was personable enough. 

They serve warm fresh rolls at the beginning of the dinner and they are awesome. I had a veal dish which was good but not something I'd rave about. My business partner had a pepperoni pizza which he liked. We each got a side salad which was fine. They have a decent wine list, had an Italian wine that I had never heard of the type and it was really good and reasonably priced as was everything else on the menu. I see a few other comments where they think it's an expensive place and I'd have to disagree, not cheap but reasonable for the quality and quantity of food. 

When I'm back in the area I'd probably go back if I was looking for Italian food."}
{"text":"Outstanding food. Pasta was not over cooked, sauce was on par with my own."}
{"text":"Started with a bowl of Italian wedding soup. It was excellent, and tasted like it was made from scratch. I ordered the seafood fettuccini. Wow! Overall a great experience. Highly recommend heading over there when you're in the mood for Italian."}
{"text":"Jimmy Dadonna's is hidden away at the end of a strip mall driveway in Solon, OH, but it is a great place to eat. In an area overrun by chain restaurants, this is a little slice of Italian heaven. I tried the lasagna and was not disappointed. The noodles were cooked to perfection, the sauce was tangy with large chunks of tomato and an ample amount of cheese provided a tasty topping to the dish. The portion was a little more than I could eat - I'm a big eater - and the meal came with a small salad and bread. The price was reasonable and the service above average. I hear the chicken parmigiana is pretty good too. Nice place!"}
{"text":"First time here and everything was great. We went for lunch. For starters the garlic rolls are delicious. I ordered the tomato cream pasta and was not disappointed. The portion size is huge. A side salad came with it. I barely made a dent in my dish before I was full. So excited for leftovers. My husband ordered a small pizza with tomatoes and eggplant and he was very happy with it. Our sons shared a pepperoni pizza and they devoured it. I only wish I would've had room for dessert. Other reviews have stated that it's overpriced. I disagree. I will easily get 3 meals out of the dish I ordered and it was $13.99. We paid $40 and that included our drinks. 
My one and only complaint was that they isn't have kid cups but that's not a huge deal at all. 
We will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Beware. They may close early without notice. Got there at 8:30 and they were supposed to close at 9PM.  There were two tables seated and they said they decided to close early."}
{"text":"Let me clarify my 4-star rating. Something at Dadonna's has changed. The food is still very good, but it's just...not the same. New cooks? I don't know. BUT, it is still very good, and I will go out of my way for it!

My fav is Chicken Jobre, but I order it minus the shrimp and served over plain spaghetti. Yum-o at dinner, and it will feed me for at least 2 more meals. Makes the $20 price far more tolerable because there is just SO much food.

Garlic balls still rock. Greasy, garlicky, and plain ol' delish. And absolutely go for the house dressing. My family has been known to order a pint of dressing to have at home - it's THAT good.

The only other \"ding\" factor that takes it down a notch is the service. As others have said, unpredictable. Years ago, when it was a tiny little place, the service was great. Nowadays...well, you get what you get."}
{"text":"Huge portions, fresh food, friendly service.
This is one of those places we take visitors - casual but nice enough for a good evening meal and convenient to Solon hotels.
Almost too big a meal for lunch. If you have 4 people at a 4-top you will have real trouble fitting all the plates on the table. So plan on leftovers (or sharing. Or going into a lasgna induced coma when you get back to work)."}
{"text":"We haven't been here for a couple years but had a nice experience last night.  The food was excellent. My daughter had the seafood fettucini which looked really good and she loved it my wife and I both had the veal parm which was a huge portion and I ordered a side of fettucini alfredo with it instead of the regular spaghetti so yummy. Of course the garlic bread is always a big hit. The only negative I will say is our server seemed a bit stressed like they may be slightly understaffed but other than that we had a great meal will definitely return"}
{"text":"Make it 3.5 stars for me.

Ate here last night with a large party.  We arrived early and they had our table ready.  Waiter (Ben) was attentive and helpful.  I think they knew a big bill (and tip) was coming their way, and they certainly earned it.

The food was decent.  Sampled the fried calamari (okay), fried mozzarella (good), and crab-stuffed mushrooms (bland).  The garlic knots are good, and were a big hit with most in our party.  For the main course, I had the lasagna (per the waiter's suggestion) and the house salad.  The house dressing is a vinaigrette, and was not to my personal liking, although others did.  The lasagna was standard - nothing special, but definitely edible.

The decor in the dining room is a little sparse, but the bar area looks pretty nice.  Wouldn't mind eating there (sans kids) sometime."}
{"text":"My family has been patronizing jimmy Dadonna's for over 15 years and had always found the food and experience to be very good - until last night.  Let me start by saying my family never complains In restaurants since my father had been in the business for years prior to retiring last year. 

The meal started with the appetizers of fried banana peppers and the artichoke hearts. The banana peppers were cold and two of the four artichoke hearts were frozen in middle. The artichoke hearts were not the same as in the past and appeared to be a frozen off site prepared product.  The waitress reluctantly took back the two artichoke hearts and brought back 2 more. For the price they charged, she should have brought back an order of four that were hot and acceptable. 

The usually excellent garlic knots were doughy and gummy - not anything like usual. The house salad dressing was lousy and also appeared to have been changed. 

After waiting a long time for our meals, the three orders of shrimp Parmesan came out ice cold with the cheese and sauce congealed. The chicken joble was hot, but laden with oil and the sauce had broke. The same can't be said for the broccoli which accompanied the chicken Joble which was ice cold also.  The veal parm never made it to the table as it was lagging behind and our group had decided to end the already pitiful meal. 

The waitress was quite \"bitchy\" and the manager was ineffective and refused to touch her fingers to the cold food and stated that the bottom of the plates were warm. Too bad we don't eat the plates since those had been in contact with a Warming tray.   We left the restaurant with a $42 bill for 2 soda pops and the crappy appetizers.   Any effective manager would have apologized and said they were having an off night and don't worry about any bill. 

Because of the way this situation was handled we will NEVER return to a jimmy D's and will let others know of our experience.  I suspect many things have changed at Jimmy D's and these changes will most likely lead to the demise of a previously special restaurant."}
{"text":"We used to love this place.  The key word is used to.  Let's start with the appetizers. The calamari was cold and nothing like is used to be the last 12+ years.  The marina sauce, which is usually wonderful, had chunks of tomatoes the size of quarters.  It didn't taste or even look like it usually does.  I didn't have a mozzarella stick but I'm told they were good.  The best part, we waited almost an hour for our rolls and appetizers.  Speaking of the rolls, they were also not up to par.  They had very little garlic on them they also arrived cold.

Now let's talk about the entrees.  I always order the large Aglio E Olio pizza as I like to have extra for at home. I used to think this was the best white pizza anywhere.  I say used to because that was not the case tonight.  While it wasn't bad it had very little garlic on it.  This is supposed to be a garlic sauce pizza.  I will say the crust was good and there were lots of mushrooms and mozzarella on it.  My mother had a small Aglio E Olio with mozzarella and artichoke hearts.  Her pizza was good except the artichokes were very bland.  Since we've had it before we know it's not normally like that.  The others in our group had Chicken Parmigiana, Veal Parmigiana and Tilapia.  Their food was good although the sides of spaghetti were not equal.  One was overflowing and the other about half full.

Our entire dinner experience took over two hours.  We were seated by 6:05 and left at 8:15.  We did not sit around talking after dinner.  It took that long to get all of our food.  I will say that our waitress was nice and kept apologizing for the wait.  She said they were unusually crowded today.  When we came in there were people eating but no one waiting.  I've been here before when we've waited for almost an hour but this was not the case.  When we left we were the last people in the restaurant.  I found that strange considering they claimed to be so busy.  We won't be going back any time soon."}
{"text":"Have wanted to go back for many years. Used to go here for lunch occasionally when I worked in Solon and loved it. Tonight did not disappoint. Service was very good.  Our server Tina was amazing. Very personable, knowledgeable and made our dining a pleasure. Food was delicious, large portions. Leftovers were double wrapped in plastic and labeled, nice touch. We will definitely put this on our list to return regularly. Just hope we get a table with Tina again :)  Oh and those garlic rolls are the reason we had so many left overs, they were super delicious."}
{"text":"Nothing anyone at my table ordered was correct, however, I'd say we still enjoyed our meals.  Customer service was pretty shoddy though.  The waitress was nice enough, just didn't seem to know what she was doing.  The Caesar side salad had an awesome dressing and the dinner rolls were awesome.  When it came to the entry I ordered a pasta dish with scallops, however, the scallops didn't come out and it took forever to flag down a waitress.  When they eventually brought the scallops out it tasted like they microwaved them to get them to the table as soon as possible, not good.  I was kind of disappointed that I had to pay full price.
I may be willing to give this place another chance; however, they definitely have things to work on."}
{"text":"Has been a favorite of ours for at least 20 years. Service is hit or miss but that's true with most eateries.  The restaurant and menu may not appeal to millennial but what the hell do they know.  Bottom line is that they have very good food for a fair price.  If I could change one thing. I would update and upgrade their wine offering."}
{"text":"The location is not the best. I had to turn back a couple times because it was behind another building. The food was good. The rolls were awesome. The prices were high but the portions were big. I'd go back if I was in the area and in the mood for Italian."}
{"text":"This is a great Italian restaurant. Our table ordered the calamari as an appetizer and I don't even like calamari but it was deliciously cooked in a sauce that I've never tasted before. It was like an oil, butter, lemony sauce.

 For my entr√©e I ordered chicken parmesan and the cheese on it was amazing! You get a pasta of your choice and a side salad with the order. I also got to try the chicken Marsala and the sauce on that was also delicious. I had the privilege of meeting the owner and he was very nice! I definitely recommend this Italian restaurant to anyone!"}
{"text":"We sat in a booth in the empty bar instead of the main dining room. I'm not a freeze baby but it was freezing.

Waitress was barely adequate and a bit short with us, as well as slow given that we were one of only two couples on that side of the restaurant. She was nicer at the end if our meal, boxing our leftovers before marking each ine and saran-wraping each container.

Garlic rolls provided with dinner in place of bread were really good (addictive). They were probably the best part of our meal.

The salads were bagged iceberg with just carrots, cucumbers and fresh shredded mozzarella, nothing to write home about. However, the house dressing was good. Salads came with our entrees. 

My wife's chicken Marsala (about $15) was interesting. We loved the sauce (in the sweet side). The chicken was unbreaded tenders, instead if scalopini. The fresh mushrooms were  good. The dish came with a side of steamed broccoli. Her dish came with a side of pasta, a good sized bowl of spaghetti and a decent marinara. She asked to substitute fetuccini alfredo, but decided not to pay the additional $6 (waitress said the give you a larger portion and make the sauce fresh.)

My cavatelli ($8) was not good. The pasta was okay. I should've asked for the marinara instead of the \"meat flavored sauce\". The two large meatballs (2.50) I could have certainly lived without. 
The portions were large. We could have easily split an entree, but would have paid a $6 plate split fee. Bill was $30 plus tip (no drinks)."}
{"text":"Meh.

Way over priced, but this seems to be the norm for Cleveland area restaurants that think they offer something of substance.

Garlic knot roll things. First one was excellent, the remainder were very underdone and doughy.

You can tell the food is or has been frozen. The taste just didn't bounce out like it should."}
{"text":"The seafood fettuccine was huge- with a wreath of mussels around, and 4 scallops, 4 shrimp. The dish was $23, the most expensive dinner entree, but came with a side salad that was fresh and dressing automatically comes on the side. The only disappointment was it wasn't until the end of the meal that I realized I never got any of the garlic knots others had been raving about as coming with entrees, and I saw the basket at other tables. And yes, everyone goes home with leftovers, every table, every person!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome! Not sure where the negative reviews are coming from. Our service here was awesome and we got our food right away. I ordered the cheese pizza. My wife had the chicken parm. We also had the fried mozzarella for an appetizer. All three were some of the best we've had since living in Ohio. The garlic knots were also highly addicting and tasted so good. We received them served warm and they definitely lived up to the hype. We will definitely be back and tell all of our friends about this place. Definitely looking forward to returning here in the next few weeks. This has definitely become our go to place for italian food."}
{"text":"Very enjoyable group dinner. Their private room was set up perfectly for a group of 25-30... anything more than that might be a little tight though. Calamari and toasted mozzarella appetizers were both very tasty. The marinara sauce tasted homemade. Dinner was served buffet style with pasta, chicken parm, beef marsala, and greens. Don't forget to try the garlic rolls with dinner. Service was attentive and wines selections were inviting. Just wish we had remembered to order desserts."}
{"text":"They always quote about 45 to 55 minutes for pizza and it turns out cold. The hosts excuse was that he doesn't keep the pizza under the heat lamp because it makes the box soggy. Why wouldn't you just quote accurate pick up times? Host told me next time to tell him to put it under the heat lamps......will not be back. The service here will not improve since it has really been the same for at least ten years."}
{"text":"After finding this place tucked behind another building and next to a theater, I was warmly welcomed by the hostess and seated promptly.  The ambiance was nice, but at the same time casual.
After looking over the menu, I ordered the shrimp parmigiana.  The waiter seemed flustered the whole time - not sure what that was about.
The salad came promptly and was a nice start.
The little garlic rolls were hit or miss.  About a 1/3 could have used some help; another third were a nice complement to the meal; and the last third were so good they could have been a meal on their own.
The shrimp were so good that they just disappeared.  Took the spaghetti home, too full to finish."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to do lunch in Solon. The service is decent, the food is good, affordable and the portions are large. The veal sandwich my co-worker ordered looked great. I think most sandwiches are about $7 or $8. I had the aglio e olio with chicken. It was a lot of food so I only ate about half with more than enough for another meal. It is sitting at the fridge at work. I hope nobody steals it."}
{"text":"Holy geez, I love me some Jimmy Dadonna's.

Located in a renovated building that used to be a food court, Jimmy Dadonna's is a full-service, sit-down, classy-but-casual kinda place. As I sit here in Washington, DC, I miss the garlic ball thingies that are delivered to the tables at Jimmy D's. Sigh...

Jimmy's menu consists of all sorts of Italian-American staples: pastas topped w/marinara, meat sauce, aglio e olio, clam sauce, etc.; chicken/veal/shrimp/eggplant parmesan; pizzas; and other yummy stuff.

All main courses are served w/a salad. What my mom typically does is order the calamari appetizer as a main course, ask me not to eat my salad, and then toss the hot calamari over the cold salad. She always has calamari leftover for future use in another salad.

There used to be a dish on the menu called shrimp sherry. It consisted of sauteed shrimp in a garlicky, sherry-laced, chunky tomato sauce served over spaghetti. Years ago my dad decided to order this dish--but with chicken. Ever since then, this is his staple at Jimmy D's as well as my own. When my dad is feeling really gluttonous, he eats the whole thing. I'm not sure how, as there is literally a pound of pasta on the plate. And probably about half a lb. of chicken breast pieces. Whenever I order this, it lasts me about three meals. If not more. I'm serious. Portions at Jimmy D's are absolutely huge.

Jimmy's specialty is marsala sauce, w/veal or chicken. When Jimmy's in the kitchen, it gets a special touch (owner's love? I do not know). My grandma loves this stuff SO much that she spoons the extra sauce directly into her mouth. The last time I was there (May 2006...far too long ago), I convinced my grandma to slurp the leftover sauce up w/a straw. She did so without reservation. Or shame. And I have a picture of it.

Jimmy Dadonna's doesn't feel like it used to be the home of a Sbarro and the now-defunct Cajun Joe's chicken restaurant--but it was. The place has been transformed into a restaurant w/high ceilings and a warm and cozy interior. I believe they opened up a party room a year or a year and a half ago, so people can now have engagement parties and the like in the space.

Everyone I've brought to Jimmy Dadonna's has really enjoyed it. The large portions will run you a bit more than at other places (I think chicken sherry is somewhere around $16...same w/other chicken dishes...and a small pizza is probably around $10...I think the aglio e olio I had was $12 or so, but it lasted a looooong time), but the quality of the food is fantastic. Plus, I really love being able to enjoy a meal a second and third time!

The service isn't anything special--no one seems to go out of his way to make your experience amazing--but no one is rude. The staff is friendly enough and they make sure your water glass and bread basket are full. I don't need every whim catered to here; all I want is to sit back, eat some garlic balls, and enjoy my food w/friends and family.

Whenever someone asks me if I miss Cleveland, I say no. Then I pause and say, \"Actually, I don't miss Cleveland, but I miss one particular restaurant...\""}
{"text":"This is our favorite Italian Restaurant.  Great sauces and pasta, terrific garlic bread, good salads.  All at very modest prices."}
{"text":"If everything else had been average, I think that the garlic rolls alone could have earned this restaurant 4 stars...buttery, garlicky, greasy balls of heaven. However, my entire meal happened to be delicious also.
All the entrees come with a salad, so I started with a tossed salad with their \"House\" italian, which was yummy. A little thick, not too sweet, lots of flavor. I ordered the tilapia, served over spinach and artichokes with a sun-dried tomato tapenade (I skipped the \"heavy\" choices bc I knew I'd overdo it on the rolls).....it was light (although serving was huge) and delicious. It also came with a side of pasta. 
I will DEFINITELY be back here for more. Don't get the wrong idea....I wouldn't say this is a date-night type restaurant. More of a family-friendly, casual place to get a good italian dinner (or lunch!) without the italian chain restaurant stigma (cheese sauces, cream, stuffed everything, ugh)."}
{"text":"This place has always had excellent food, even before, when it was on station street- yes now I'm dating myself :-).  There portion size is always genorous, food full of taste and pazazzz.  Oh and just order a pizza on the side- you won't regret it- one of the best pizza's around this town of Solon- and you will defiantly have leftovers to enjoy again."}
