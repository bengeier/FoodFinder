{"text":"Highly disappointed with my ribs at the Pittsburgh Rib Fest. They were bland and dry. I've had good smoked ribs prior to this experience. My fathers friend makes them, so I know good smoked ribs when I taste them and sadly for Bad Azz theirs definitely didn't make the cut. Also, the beans were too spicy and mushy and the Mac and cheese tasted like the kind you could purchase from giant eagle or Walmart. Not impressed. Not sure how they won any awards with these."}
{"text":"This place was part of the Corks and Kegs festival at The Meadows Race Track and Casino. I'm always up for a good BBQ pace so opted to give this a try. Almost always I go with pulled pork or chicken. They were already sold out of chicken when I got there (good sign) and thought I'd go with ribs.   I rarely choose ribs because I don't like to fight for my food. More often than not ribs have the meat so attached to the bone it's hardly worth the effort. Boy was I happy that I chose them this time! I ordered a half rack for $11. A real value since the bones slid right out and I was left with a ton of meat that was extremely tender and smoked really nicely. Just enough smoke to still taste the meat. BBQ sauce was sweet with a hint of spice. I like both sweet and hot so this was a good balance.   Happy I got in line early because this guy was BUSY! Only thing this place needed was four more hands to handle the crowd.   I definitely would like to try more from Bad Azz. Have to imagine if the ribs were this great at a festival that in house is probably the bomb. I kinda want to see if I can pull out all the bones at once. BBQ party trick? If you see Bad Azz out and about at a festival, it's worth the taste."}
{"text":"All I can say is, I recently saw 2 people wearing BAD AZZ BBQ t-shirts in COSTCO buying about 30 rotisserie chickens - the already cooked ones - not raw chickens. If they sell premade Costco Chickens as their 'quality BBQ' I think I will go somewhere else..."}
{"text":"This place is now down on Becks Run Road by Paige's. This would be my first time stopping here but probably not my last. We got a whole rack of ribs half a chicken and two soda of Mac n cheese. The ribs were pretty good, the BBQ sauce wasn't bad either. The Mac n cheese was cheesy and the half chicken was good. My overall opinion on this place is not great but not bad either. If you're looking for a quick BBQ fix and don't want to travel far. This is a decent local spot to grab something from."}
{"text":"Best ribs I have ever had!  I have visited them during the Rib Fest on multiple occasions and the rib flavor and sauce is the best around."}
{"text":"I visited Bad Azz BBQ's stand during the annual Rib Fest at Heinz Field last Mon.  Having seen at Bloomfield Little Italy Days that they were the defending Rib Fest champion, I was eager to try them out.  Unfortunately for me, so was everyone and their brother, given that they had the longest line of all the rib stands that I walked by.  However, I'm willing to wait for great BBQ, so I decided to bite the bullet and get in line.  It took about half an hour to make it to the front of the line and receive food, but it was worth the wait when it comes to ribs.  A friend and I split a half rack of ribs ($15), plus baked beans and mac and cheese ($3 each).  The ribs were perfectly cooked, falling off the bone easily when we dug in.  They came pre-sauced, and the sauce was delicious--it was a vinegar-based tomato BBQ sauce.  While the sides were okay, I must confess that I found them a bit underwhelming, given the price.  The mac and cheese noodles were on the mushy side, and had less sauce than I'd like.  The baked beans were spicy, due to red pepper flakes present in the sauce.  While I'm not opposed to spicy food, spiciness in baked beans seemed out of place from a BBQ stand.  Overall, I enjoyed my meal from Bad Azz BBQ.  I'd order their ribs again for sure, but would steer clear of the sides in the future.  If you see their stand, I'd encourage you to give it a try, since they have some of the best BBQ ribs in PGH, for sure."}
{"text":"This was my stop at the Ribfest. Ribs fell off the bone and chicken was fantastic. Ribs are my choice whenever I go out. This is the top of my list."}
{"text":"Truly an embarrassment to BBQ. Pulled pork was super dry no taste and no thought behind it. I gave them an extra star for attempting BBQ ."}
{"text":"Stopped by Bad Azz stand at the Rib Fest at Heinz Field.  Most of the different rib stands were busy and so was Bad Azz.  Their line was one of the longer and It took about 30 minutes to get our order in but we received our order in just a few minutes.   Ordered ribs plus beans and Mac & Cheese.  The ribs were cooked perfectly..tender and tasty and moist.  The sauce is a tomato based smokey sweet with some spiciness, really a winner.  The Mac & Cheese was good with a little sharper cheese than most places and the noodles were the usual overcooked/soft that you get at BBQ places.  The  beans were very tasty with a touch of spiciness."}
{"text":"my ribs were cold today. I was already in my office, although 2 miles away. Could not  turn around. :(  Sauce was good. Beans were a little spicy. I'm sure if someone ate spicy unlike me, they would like them."}
