{"text":"Wonderful, fresh, flavorful, high quality food, prepared perfectly and portions to satisfy! The service is very good, with friendly and attentive wait staff. I love this beautiful restaurant and highly recommend to all!"}
{"text":"Very clean place, food is delicious The taste is like a homemade Mexican food. The server are really friendly. I recommend this place."}
{"text":"This place was good ...i felt like I was at my friend Alans house!!! lets just say I felt like I was in Mexico with the music playing..the food was fresh very tasty. Chips in salsa was on point like a box cutter. People were friendly ..overall place was clean and I will be coming here more often ..no more Filismoothies for this litto stomach."}
{"text":"Super friendly and the food is great!  The place is brand new and decorated well.  Can't miss here."}
{"text":"Tried it today for the first time. The food was very good and reasonably priced. My only \"complaint\" is the server never asked if we needed  refills on our drinks, which we did. The spicy, but very awesome salsa was the culprit. I will be back, I'm sure."}
{"text":"Yum, tasty and fresh. Great selection. If you like spice, they will give you spice. I joked that the salsa wasn't that spicy. Our waitress had them whip us up some, we didn't ask, she just did it. She brings it out and it was HOT, but so good. Everyone friendly, nice, helpful. We love it. And the nights we order ahead and pick up the food is just as good."}
{"text":"Went in for a late lunch and while it was too late for their lunch special, I ordered a Polo Asada burrito. When it arrived it was enough for two people and was quite possibly the best Polo Asada I have had in Arizona. The service was great, my glass of water never hit empty. The prices are good as well. I would certainly recommend them to others. The restaurant has a very coastal Mexican feel to it, very colorful and enjoyable."}
{"text":"It was surprisingly good! Really good in fact. I will come back next week... My daughter said the best cheese crisp ever... I had a combo plate and they were all great!"}
{"text":"Love the food and service! Our waiter took the time to ask how we liked the food. My boyfriend doesn't eat a whole lot. He asked him if he really liked his food or not. Very considerate and observant. My boyfriend felt appreciated for his concern. Will be back again!"}
{"text":"I am at Anaya's again. Awesome food, I cannot tell you how much I love this place. Maybe I just did. lol"}
{"text":"We love this bright colorful place! Highly recommend the Camarones ala Diabla (Spicy Shrimp in red sauce). It is soooo good. Lots of depth, great flavor. Also fantastic is their version of Pollo Fundido. Be warned, if you eat Anaya's pollo fundido, you may not enjoy others! Haha."}
{"text":"This place is great and has the best ceviche I have ever had its made with tiger shrimp and the customer service is out this world you have to try this place"}
{"text":"The restaurant was very nice looking and clean. My wife had the Arizona Chimi and said it was alright. I ordered the New york Steak and Mas AND IT WAS AWFUL!l! 

I ordered it medium rare. It came out with a suspicious gray color and well done. The server offered to bring out another. When it arrived, it too was gray. Upon cutting it in the center, it was a dull color, yet some of the edges of the steak were deep red and cold.

It was then that I realized that they may put \"grill\" marks on the steak, they actually cook it in a microwave oven. I've seen that gray color before and the uneven (raw) nature of the cooking confirmed it.

I was polite in declining another \"steak\" yet the server never apologized and still charged for half the plate.

We finished our dining experience, politely paid the check, and left.

I doubt we will go back. Too many other choices out there and microwaved, cold steak is NOT one of them. This was around 4:30pm on Monday, 8/12/2013"}
{"text":"I am a native Phoenician and Mexican American. I was shocked to find this restaurant serving such authentic Mexican dishes. It was similar to my Mother's cooking. Try the seafood with Mojo de Ajo (Garlic sauce). They added peanut butter to the Mojo de Ajo and this was truly a delicacy know  to very few locals.
Try the Dos Amigos (Prawns and Scallops) - $13.25. The cooks are the 2 owners  Man and Wife. Beautiful decor and very pleasant young waiters/waitresses

  12-29-12  looking forward to 2013"}
{"text":"Solid, honest Mexican fare with great ambiance and excellent service. Is it Barrio Cafe or Los Dos Molinos? No, but for no nonsense Mexican food, this place delivers. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Love this place.  We come here often. The food is fresh, and the staff extremely friendly and helpful. This is one of the few Mexican restaurants that still serve traditional mole!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is fast becoming our neighborhood restaurant... let me tell you why.  First, you feel at home, always a smile, super super clean, the service is fast but the food is delish and hot.  The Blue margarita... is must have!!!! after one, you can't drink and drive... hahaha, sooooooooo good.  Bottom line is, we love it... we go once a week, the price is so good, we can actually afford to go once or twice a week.  I hope it stays the way it is... plus my hubby loves when the waiter call him \"my friend\" LOL.

Re-review

After over a year of loving this place, they change staff and the new people are horrible, the food change, sad but I would never go back."}
{"text":"Phenomenal food, excellent service, and really cute decor.  I love this place.  No matter what I order the food is amazing.  The horchata is completely delicious and the serving is huge.  I had the burrito and it was amazing.  Everyone I was with ordered something different and we all loved our meal. I'll be back, again and again."}
{"text":"I was visiting from Utah and my mother took me to Anaya's for lunch. The decor is absolutely stunning! The tables, chairs, and booths are carved reliefs of Mexican scenes and painted in beautiful vivid colors. I've never seen anything like it!
I had al pastor street tacos and shrimp cocktail. There were plenty of good-sized shrimp in the cocktail, and the al pastor was perfect. Sooo good! I miss authentic Mexican food since moving North, and I was like a kid in a candy store. Mom had a green corn tamale and she said it was awesome as well. 
The service is excellent. I will definitely go back to Anaya's next time I am in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Tasty Mexican food!
Very prompt and polite service!
Colorful decorations, from the tables to chairs to the ceiling!
Currently they are having El Trio de Jesse Armenta playing every Saturday night between 6 and 8 pm!
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!"}
{"text":"I've been in Arizona for 11 years and finally we have found a Mexican restaurant that we love.  In two days I've eaten here twice.  First day I had their street tacos and day two I had their carnitas and they were both excellent.  Anaya's is clean, comfortable, great prices and tasty.  I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Found this very very nice Mexican restaurant close to 43rd & Dunlap 
It's called Anaya's 
Food is amazingly tasty  & the guys/dames who run this place are very hospitable & friendly!!!
That means a lot coming from a picky eater & a food critic like me - as you know!
U should come here with ur friends!
They have a full bar!!"}
{"text":"The food here is great and the service was fantastic!  Super nice folks and the right amount of spice.  This is one of our favorites!"}
{"text":"Sorry - tonight, Anaya's was off. The \"salsa\" we were served with our chips and drinks tasted like jar tomato sauce spiced with chili powder. We asked if there was \"real\" salsa and staff said that was it. So sad. We had enjoyed prior visits and like that it is just around the corner. Needless to say, we didn't order food because we were concerned other sauces might be off. Hope they read this and switch to better salsa and someone updates review. We would like to go back but won't until we know food has improved."}
{"text":"Went to try this after months of driving by. Its right by our house so we thought we would finally give it a try. The food was ok and way overpriced. I paid $10.99 for a chimichanga that was the size of a taco bell bean burrito and the beans werent very good either. I will not be back. Macayo's here I come!"}
{"text":"We used to be regulars at Mixteca before moving right around the corner from this place so we were really hoping that Anaya's could be our new favorite. Everyone that helped us was super friendly and the food is pretty good too. We were underwhelmed by the street tacos and they seemed small for $3.25 each. I got the 2 item combo plate for less than $10 which is a good deal! I love that they have a drive thru where you can pick up take-out. This was a good find!"}
{"text":"Amazing place all around! The decor is perfectly festive, the food is top notch, and the service has been great every time, whether in person or at the drive-through to-go pickup. The Camarones a la Diabla was the best my wife ever had, while the Pollo Fundido was off the charts for me. They even have a non-spicy salsa available for my kids!"}
{"text":"My first visit to this cafe and it was wonderful.I ordered the chipotle chicken, very delicious, good flavor, it was Saturday evening and to my surprise, there was a mariachi band, how nice to have a fresh new  restaurant in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"This is the real deal! This is AUTHENTIC Mexican food. The waitstaff is attentive and friendly. The food is fabulous. I'm vegetarian, and the cooks are willing to cater to me by altering certain menu items and preparing something suitable for vegetarians. The prices are reasonable and it's the cleanest restaurant I've ever dined in. I always have a good dining experience at Anaya's."}
{"text":"I am a totally picky Mexican food eater, and Anaya's was amazing. My mom and I stopped in for lunch today and we were sat immediately and served our drinks and chips and salsa. The salsa was too DIE for. We chose our meals off the lunch menu which was very reasonably priced. I had the arroz con pollo which had tons of fresh veggies and the sauce was great. My mom had the pollo fundido and it was excellent as well. Over all the atmosphere and the service was excellent while still offering great prices. We will definitely be back. My only down point was I don't believe the tortillas were homemade, other than that is was wonderful! Glad to have a great alternative to Manuel's and Don Rubens in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Hands down best Mexican food in town. The colorful atmosphere and clean environment makes for a wonderful dining experience with amazing Mexican food. The street tacos are a personal favorite, try it with shredded beef. They make the best micheladas that you can't find anywhere, just like in Cabo and actually on the menu. My older brother introduced us and it's been a love affair since. On our way now to try the other location on Thunderbird."}
{"text":"Hands down amazing Mexican food! The price was subtable for the amount of food given I had the plain chicken shredded chicken baritone and was taken back to my childhood, it was delicious! The horchata was creamy and made from scratch taste made me ask for refills. Overall, the food was great but the decor won my heart over, I'll be asking where they got their chairs from next time I go!"}
{"text":"This is a solid place! We have been here a few times and they get an A+ on, fresh tasting food, friendliness and cleanliness!  Everything we have ordered has been really good. Ceviche is great and is loaded with fresh seafood, tomatoes, cucumbers and avocado! .Yummy! Give them a try!"}
{"text":"This applies to both the 43rd ave and Olive and the 59th ave and Thunderbird locations. I have eaten at both and food and service are PHENOMENAL. Tonight took the cake though. I called and ordered a meal with a lot of substitutions and silferoto. The gentleman took down the order perfectly and even made suggestions to make the dish better. Great customer service. He then reposted the order to me and confirmed the location. Apparently I had accidentally called the 43rd ave location as it came up first on Google despite the 59th ave location being much closer. I said that I would call them thanked the gentlemen. He then told me not to worry and said they he would call over to them and place my order, telling me I could pick it up in ten minutes at the other location. I went there in the stated ten minutes and the order was just coming out and was perfect. I cannot highly recommend them enough. Best customer service I have ever received and the food is QUALITY. They're affordable as well."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this gem while searching for some quality Mexican food. This place is the truth! Amazing food, drinks and service!"}
{"text":"The food for the most part was delicious. The Steak Fajita Salad was okay, the steak lacked flavor and could have been more moist. The Chile Relleno and chips/salsa were good. On the other hand, the Pollo Fundido was one of the best I've ever had. The chicken was very moist and had lots of flavor. I would go back for that reason alone. Also, the service was good, the waitress we had was very attentive."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service, open at 10am to 10pm to enjoy an excellent breakfast, lunch and dinner. This September 2017 ANAYA'S in the location 9240 N. 43Ave. Glendale have the promotion bucket of 6 beers CORONA LIGHT to $ 20dls and TEQUILA OF THE HOUSE to 2.99dls

Every day have promotions ask the waiters."}
{"text":"The BEST salsa lives here!  The restaurant is very clean, has cute booths, and friendly service.  Fajitas were tasty and we really enjoyed this restaurant."}
{"text":"I was not impressed with this restaurant. I found the food to be bland and over priced. Service was decent and restaurant was clean."}
{"text":"The Caldo De Res, a very hearty beef stew, after squeezing on lime, it was heaven.  The street taco's were just ok for me, but my daughter loved them.  I think the price is higher than most mexican restaurants that are sitting in a strip mall but if you really like something from there, then it is worth the cost. The people that work there are sweet but they don't speak much English.  I don't mind, but I am sure it may be a little bothersome for others.   I will be back for the Caldo when I am being lazy and don't feel like cooking."}
{"text":"I recently returned to the valley and found this gem in my old neighborhood. 
Every dish my wife and I have tried has been great. Excellent spicy salsa! Love the ceviche appetizer and seafood entrees too.  
Clean, bright and cheerful décor combined with a great serve staff make this my go to Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"Visited Anaya's 5830 W. Thunderbird Rd Glendale location four times while visiting a family member in the medical center across the street. This place is numero uno in my book! The margaritas, chips & service are the best. The food is authentic & delicious! I'm so glad we found this hidden gem and wish I could visit more often. Try it! You'll be pleasantly surprised!"}
{"text":"Been here a couple times and I've left happy each time.
The food is good, not authentic really, but definitely good.
The margarita flavors are interesting (banana?) but also good.
I would definitely come back.
Oh, and parking is usually super easy because it's in a shared lot."}
{"text":"Nope not good at all. They'll up sale you even if you want beans instead of meat in your burro. Burros are the size of taco bell. Waitress not nice.  It's too bad too because when they first opened their portions were good,  service was good. We won't be coming back.  At Popos at least toy get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Five stars because we are absolutely satisfied with the food, service, and ambiance (clean and comfortable). Today we came for breakfast/lunch. Just as we ordered. Posting pics."}
{"text":"Very very good. Fun decor, and clean inside. Staff was friendly. The food was delicious. I had \"Dos Amigos\".
(shrimp, scallops, and mushrooms in red sauce)
It really hit the spot. I will definitely be going back.
I highly recommend this place when you get a hankerin for mexican food."}
{"text":"Stop by here for a to-go order one night order the chimichanga I would have to say it was pretty damn good especially for taking it home it made it home still crunchy I like the flavor of the shredded beef no fat season very well got the counter-attack the order was very friendly Castle brought a glass of water while I was waiting definitely back"}
{"text":"Even though it's located in a strip mall, the restaurant is authentic and the food is delicious. One of the best Mexican places in Glendale and the west valley. The Happy Hours on weekdays are also great for unwinding and have a wide selection of drinks."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying Anaya's and I was quite disappointed. The staff was very friendly and helpful, but the food was mediocre and over priced. 

I got the veggie chimichanga for $9.99. The chimi was small for the amount I paid. It was soggy and not crisp like a chimi should be. I also tried the green corn tamale. It was $3 and gross. I didn't even finish it. 

I would not come back to Anaya's. Which is disappointing - it is hard to find vegan mexican food."}
{"text":"Excellent food and excellent service! I had the seafood chimichonga and it was awesome! I will see definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Stopped in to grab takeout the other day. It was early on a weekend day so the restaurant wasn't very busy, only a couple patrons. The staff was friendly and took care of us quickly.

I ordered a bean and cheese chimichanga, enchilada style, a cheese crisp for the kids, and my partner ordered a carne aside chimichanga, enchilada style. I'd say it took about 20 minutes until we got our food - not horrible but better to call ahead. When we got home, the food was hot and the chimichangas weren't too soggy. Everything was just as we had ordered. 

They have a Taco Tuesday deal we noticed a sign for. I believe it was street tacos for $1.25/ea and crunchy tacos for $2.25/each. We were talking about how we definitely wanted to come back and try that out. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"We were just out and about, stopped in. My expectations were drop kicked to the curb. This place was awesome. I really enjoyed the food. The beans seemed home made like my momma's.  The service was awesome. It was very clean and really enjoyable. I will be back to combat my hangovers with some good ceviche."}
{"text":"I used to go to this place before it burned down so I figured I would give it a shot since it was completely rebuilt.  I was disappointed to find out it was a totally new owner, name, recipes and menu.  They did an outstanding job of renovating the place.

I came in for lunch one day and ordered the fajitas.  The food was just okay.  Your typical run of the mill mexican restaurant.  I was disappointed with the portions as they were rather small.  For the amount of money I spent I feel that the portions were skimpy and therefore I havent been back."}
{"text":"Awesome ceviche, their establishment is nicely decorated, the staff was great, overall it was great."}
{"text":"Fourth time in and has been excellent every time. Some of the best chips and salsa and excellent margaritas. Latest dish I've had was the Chile Verde, very fresh and tasty. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This was our 2nd time coming because the first time it was good. Well I don't know what happened but the waiter did not even pay attention to what he was doing. The food wasn't even good the green chili tasted water down and the carne Asada plate tasted like the meat was old. The horchata was disgusting and this will be the last time we come here"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times now.  The first time I was disappointed in almost every item I tried.  From the salsa, to the taco, to the enchiladas, to the taquitos.  This last time I thought it was much better.  I ordered a super michelada that was ten bucks and came with a huge glass of beer and spicy clamato juice and other spices, as well as, a small beer upside down on top and a shot of tequila on the side.  It was definitely worth 10 bucks and delicious!  

I also had an order of a dozen raw oysters with ceviche on top.  It was a high price to pay at 22 bucks but they were really good.  Each oyster was covered with ceviche, jalapenos, red onions, cilantro, and lime.  

I also tried a bloody mary which was just okay.  It was very small and not nearly spicy enough.  Last item I tried were the bacon wrapped shrimp.  The meal came with beans, rice, tortillas, and 6 or 8 bacon wrapped shrimp.  The shrimps were small and way overcooked.  The beans and rice were both very average as well.  

If I went back I would only opt for oysters and micheladas."}
{"text":"This place is got to be the absolute when it comes to hometown service. Living in a big city like Phoenix it's hard to get taken care of in a place where people know you by name. I have never been disappointed by the kindness and superior service at this restaurant. My family and I come here often and we wouldn't have it any other way. This is my absolute favorite place to be because I always feel so comfortable and welcome. Also the michaladas are on HIT!!"}
{"text":"Service at drive thru was convenient. Seems they do charge quite a bit extra for any little thing (e.g. 50 cents pico, 1.50 for two tortilla). Also, this may just relate to take-out but the portions were skimpy compared to pricing.

Spinach enchiladas and vegetarian chimichanga were great and the order was correct. I'd eat here again."}
{"text":"We came during the evening time and got seated promptly. They brought complementary chips and salsa to the table. I was excited to find the chips warm and fresh. The salsa was really good. It was a little spicy and with a lot of flavor. We got a cheese crisp that was actually crispy. Probably the best I have had from a Mexican restaurant. I got the Arizona chimichanga that was good as well. It came with beans and rice.

I would say things are moderately priced. They have a happy hour from 3PM to 6PM where some drinks and appetizers are 50% off.

One of the fun things about this place is the bright colors they use. The restaurant was very easy to find with lots of parking. The staff was nice and helpful.

If your feeling like some Mexican food. I would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Always friendly!
Always fast!
Always good!
This hidden gem is worth a try. Great value especially for the price point."}
{"text":"this place has great posole and its such a fun place on Saturdays. If you arent interested in traditional Mexican music then do not attend on Saturdays but otherwise, their food is delicious and I've never had a complaint on their service. I like that its ran by a family and they're always very attentive and courteous. It always looks clean and spotless, despite their crowds on the weekends."}
{"text":"Since a regular yelper.  I got a coupon for 50 percent off cheese crisp.  The waitress said it wasn't good until after 6pm. Although it didn't say that."}
{"text":"We have been to both locations, I like this one the best! I was so happy to see Pollo con crema on the menu, can't find it here, 3 Margaritas in Colorado has my favorite! But gave it a try here and it was good! Have been back 5 or more times to have it again! The servers are always friendly except for one male! He was grumpy and rushing us to order! But still will return! Hubby likes there Tuesday tacos, but if another day he has no problem with picking other dishes! Love the decor, and food is always hot and fresh! It's not close but manage to go there anyway!"}
{"text":"Are you serious with this? I ordered a burrito for $9 (green chile) picked it up at the window. The burrito is TINY, what the F, I'm a man with a concept of value, this is crazy. Adding a pic with my hand for reference"}
{"text":"I usually eat at the Anayas at 59 and Thunderbird, taco was dripping orange grease, filled a napkin with grease, salsa not quite as good, margarita packed no punch, was there ANY liquor in it? Won't be back here, sticking with the other location."}
{"text":"Ordered a couple times to go. Both times order wasn't right. Food is really good. Just not so good with special requests.  We ordered shrimp fajitas and it only came with 6 shrimp.  They were on the larger side but still seemed like a small portion for the cost. Maybe one more chance..."}
{"text":"Good food at good price and friendly staff. The margaritas are strong, they don't skimp on tequila 

Wasn't noisy either, tables and booths are very decorative and comfortable. Highly recommend to anyone who likes Mexican food"}
{"text":"I just happened upon this place one day and I have to say the food is really good.  I am always on the hunt for good Mexican food, which is very hard to come by in Phoenix.

My first visit I had the pozole.  It was so good!  The service was friendly and the place looked new and clean!  I am a fan!"}
{"text":"Excellent. Friends and I arrived there for an early lunch prior to our flight from PHX. Delicious food, fun atmosphere, and attentive service. 

I with I lived in Phoenix so I could come back more often! We could not have been happier."}
{"text":"Let me start off with, I live in the Chicago area in a heavily Latin/Mexican populated area. I am used to true, authentic Mexican food. Coming down to Arizona for Spring Training my family and I were looking for some Mexican food. Of course we went to Yelp and we were not disappointed. We went on a Saturday night when the mariachi band was playing. It was fun, delicious, AND authentic. The salsa comes free with the meal, but it was a bit spicy so be sure to order some of the delicious guacamole to cool you off a bit. The chips were fresh and warm. When they brought those chips out I knew the rest of the food was going to be amazing. 
Also, some of the best salsa verde!!  When I come back down here in the future I will make it a point to come back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"i went based on good to great recent reviews.and they didnt disappoint. i had machaca breakfast w/came w/rice n beans n tortillas. however, when asked for another order of tortillas i wasnt informed there was a charge. to my surprise it was $1.50 for 2 small flour tortillas. you can get a dozen  for .99........anyways food was good but lil things like that dont sit well w/me n im sure you can agree. like free refills or extra salsa come on guys...ill bring to their attention next time personally..."}
{"text":"Food was ok, bartender was terrible.  We sat at the bar so she waited on us too. Myself and two others came here last Friday.   We were treated horribly.   The bartender provided one small basket of chips and one salsa.  Mind you,  we are sitting at the bar so I would have had to get out of my seat,  walk over to my friend to get a chip as she put the chips and salsa, not in the middle so we could all reach it but only to one person in our group of 3.  I asked for more chips and salsa and was told I would need to pay. Absolutely rediculous! !!  I agreed to pay,  knowing right then we would never come back (why would we when we can go anywhere else and get it for free).  From here it only got worse,  she poorer my vodka soda so light. ....barely put vodka in it and the others drank beer so they were good to go except she would not bring us more drinks unless we asked.  It was like she wanted to go home and was upset we came in. ...mind you we came in 1 hour and  15 min before the listed closing time.  I felt like the salsa, chips and vodka were all coming out of her pocket or paycheck personally. ...man she did not want to give it out.....stingy .   We will NEVER go back, subpar food and service was literally the worst I have ever had.   They won't stay open long and she should retire as a bartender,  service and living off tips is not her calling. I have never tipped zero but did here, happily."}
{"text":"The salsa is surprisingly good, very fresh and with good spice. It wasn't hot (to me) but it had great flavor and I'm pretty much a freak of nature when it comes to hot stuff. The chips came out hot and freshly made, as they should. The salsa was the best part of the meal in my opinion. I had the Veggie Chimichanga, which was a first for me...it was pretty darn good though. The service was slightly slow, but we were there on a Friday night so that was to be expected... and their friendliness definitely made up for any delay. That and munching on the chips and delicious salsa of course. The restaurant is small but bright and feels like it's family run. We also tried the fried ice cream and were pleasantly surprised there too. It was fresh and delicious. We've been many places that pre-make theirs and keeping it the freezer completely destroys the texture. Glad that wasn't the case here. We will definitely be back and it's nice to have a go to spot in our new area."}
{"text":"Visiting from CO and was on the hunt for locally owned and good food.  This place did not disappoint!  The Cadillac Margarita was excellent as well as the food!  The waitress was cheerful and patient with us and our ability to order in Spanish.  Very clean establishment!  We will definitely return again!"}
{"text":"We were in the area getting our taxes done and had some time to eat. I truly don't believe this was here last year. But I have been wrong before. 
First of all, not their fault but it's a bit smelly outside. Like sewage smelly!  When you go inside, a very happy and with a big smile on her face welcomes you. There are plenty of booths and tables to sit down. There are also a bar to sit at. It was in between breakfast and lunch when we got there. Plenty of options on the menu. So of course I decided to order off the menu. I had a chili verde and egg burrito. It was good, not the way I would have prepared it. It had beans, rice, eggs, and chili verde. It could have been better if they would have put less of the beans and rice. Really liked it how they grilled the burrito. Chips and salsa was very good.  The decor was very bright and colorful. Very clean inside, and very friendly staff. Need to come back to try more on the menu."}
{"text":"Great, great, great.....we were looking for a Mexican place and Anaya's came up on the search, looked good so got the directions and headed there.  So glad we did, some of the best food I have had here in the valley. Right up there with Cafe Bario. I had the traditional chimi and it was great, everything was fresh (you can tell when it is so). My friend had veggie burritos, the biggest and best margherita she had ever had (two of them actually) and loved them both. Interior is fun with colorful chairs and dividers. The wait staff was friendly, cheerful and attentive. The whole experience was just great. This is one place I will return to, recommend to others and take guests when they come to visit"}
{"text":"Loved the brightly colored interior which made for a festive atmosphere. The staff are very friendly and helpful. Excellent beef chimichangas, my fave. The beef enchiladas are very flavorful as well. Would highly recommend Anayas for Mexican food that is muy bueno! Truly an original twist on some old favorites!"}
{"text":"Good, but not great . . . Reasonably priced . . .  Sunday after 2 PM was not crowded.  Staff friendly."}
{"text":"The one at 59th and Thunderbird is much better. I ordered a salad instead of rice and beans it was so small and they only have two dressings ranch and ceasar  not even Italian dressing, I was told because the other ones across from the hospital they have more choices. The food is greasier here too.  Not a fan of this location."}
{"text":"The service is fast and friendly. Ordering is a snap. Street tacos are legit. Asada, cilantro and onion. Why mess with a good thing. Will be back!  Chips and salsa with every order.  Awesome"}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE this place and their delicious margaritas!  My bf and I came here and couldn't get over the colorful theme of the place and the friendly service from Lety, our waitress. Stop on by for happy hour and grab some margaritas or their \"coffee\" drinks ."}
{"text":"This place is a good find. 

The people working here are really nice. My friend and I went on a Thursday evening. There were only a few other families in the restaurant, so it was a comfortable environment. 

We ordered the Camaron enchiladas and Sunrise enchiladas. Both were delicious, but we liked the camaron enchiladas the most. Everything came with chips and salsa too. 

The bathrooms were clean, and the restaurant's interior had festive decor and seating. 

I'd recommend this place. Hope to be back soon."}
{"text":"We didn't feel like driving to Commodor Guadalajara, and heard this place was good so decided to try. When I order a beef taco, I expect the entire thing to be fried, not prepared shredded beef placed in a precooked shell. All the beef in all the items was the same, whether it was a taco, burrito or enchilada, flavor was ok. Tortillas were very thick. Rice and beans were good. I wasn't happy with the food, servers were very nice though. Pretty decent bloody Mary. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Very friendly service! Food are fresh, delicious, authentic and good potions. Love the colorful painted chairs."}
{"text":"Perfectly good Mexican food in Glendale. The hot tortilla chips and spicy salsa keep coming throughout the meal. The carnitas were dry, yet had a lot of flavor. Margaritas were fine, typical sour mix and cheap tequila. The restaurant is accommodating to larger groups and splitting checks. This was my second time and I enjoyed it. Not the best mexican in the whole world, yet very tasty.

{"text":"I'm a wanna-be abuela. 

Fun decor - a nice surprise for a strip mall location. Great service, muy attentive. Good food. I wish the Poole had more flavor but would choose to come here again."}
{"text":"Clean place, great salsa, great service and really good food!  So glad we had lunch here. Do yourself a favor and try the Carne asada."}
{"text":"Amazing salsa and delicious food. When we want something spicy this is where we go. The red and green salsas are both hot in a good way. Never disappointed with anything we have ordered. I love the ceviche!!"}
{"text":"TACO TUESDAY hidden gem alert!! It's not on their regular menu, but the taco Tuesday special is amazing!!"}
{"text":"I've ordered here too many times in the last few days, but still haven't been disappointed with there take out service.  This is fast food, so I rate it based on what people are generally looking for, when they want fast food.  It's not the healthiest, probably nothing organic about it.    Every take out has been delicious, fresh, and ready when I got there.  The customer service has been very friendly.  I owed 10.98 on my last meal. I handed him a 10 dollar bill.  He told me it was 10.98 but not to worry about it, recognizing me from the previous few days. That's perceptive, forward thinking, competition crushing business, especially in the fast food industry.   I appreciate the service and product, thank you."}
{"text":"We just discovered this place and loved it! I had the enchilada deluxe with ground beef and green sauce and my boyfriend had a carne asada burrito. Their food is just great and the staff very friendly. I enjoy coming here once a week, if you go on a Friday they have live music playing. It's very very nice and I recommend it to anyone looking for great Mexican food."}
{"text":"Great quality! Best Mexican food in Glendale, nice decor, good service!"}
{"text":"Anaya's is a great place to eat some legit Mexican food, and I'm from New Mexico where we love spicy. The salsa is actually pretty good and has a little spice to it. It's really hard to find good salsa in Arizona. So it's a pleasant surprise. If you have kids, they even bring out a not-at-all spicy version of their salsa and I find that to be awesome. I normally get the make-your-own combo plate with three items, chicken or beef taco, chicken enchilada, and red tamale. The taco is amazing 9 out of 10 times. That one time, it will come out a little to crispy or burnt. The enchilada is on point. As for the tamale, the first time I ordered it it was spicy and had great flavor. Since then, I feel that the masa has been extra lard-y tasting. So beware. If you're in the mood for an adult drink, try the \"Bartender's Special Margarita\" Mmm! 

All-in-all, they have great service, a great atmosphere and above average food. And for an added taste of Mexicana, go there on a Saturday evening for live mariachi music."}
{"text":"Delicious and pleasing to the eye the restaurant has a drive thru however why would anyone not want to dine in the decor is so gorgeous and great customer service"}
{"text":"As I scrolled through yelp for a local place to meet my husband for lunch I stumbled across this place.  When walking in immediately I fell unloved with the decor. We were seated promptly by a very nice lady wish I could remember her name.  The food; amazing .doesn't even begin to decide how good it is.  I ordered cheese enchiladas, my super picky husband ordered chicken mole. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant last night and I think I found a new favorite. Mexican restaurants are a dime a dozen in AZ, but Anaya's stands out. They make southern-style Mexican food which is quite different than typical  Tex Mex. The food was so good that part of me wanted to eat there again for lunch today! 
The food tastes fresh and homemade like someone's abuelita is cooking. 
I took off 1 star because although their staff is friendly, the service was a bit slow. Will be a regular customer!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Visited phoenix in March, had an excellent experience with kids and family. Second visit in July, and another great dining experience. Waiter was extremely courteous, informed us mariachi bands Saturdays @6. I had the steak fajita lunch and hubs had seafood chimi! We will visit again!"}
{"text":"Uses lard and chicken stock.... Not very friendly or knowledgeable. Would not return."}
{"text":"First time was great best tacos ever second time polar opposite won't be returning this place is very inconsistent."}
{"text":"Great food!
Friendly service!
Attractive restaurant!

Anaya's Fresh Mexican food is how they bill themselves. Fresh for sure!  I loved my dish. It was arroz con pollo (chicken with rice). An attractive plate that included lightly sauteed zucchini, mushrooms and peppers in a spicy sauce. A generous dish so I had leftovers--a lot of food for the price. Lunch buddy enjoyed the same dish except with prawns (shrimp).

Anaya's has an extensive menu, the usual Mexican fare but lots of different dishes and many that included seafood. They open early and even have a drive thru where you can get takeouts, like breakfast burritos or lunch or dinner. How convenient!

The Mexican furnishings and decor are authentic and outstanding--a cheerful atmosphere. Our server had a great attitude, friendly and helpful. 

Anaya's is a new family-owned restaurant in Glendale. I hope it does well because it has a lot to offer. Looking forward to another visit and trying some other dishes."}
{"text":"This is our favorite place for Mexican food. There food is wonderful and full of flavor. The restaurant is so clean and fresh. I tell all my friends that they have got to try this place out. The service and atmosphere is excellent!"}
{"text":"Ajo Al's? no... Popo's on 59th? no... Abuelo's? Arriba's? no... On The Border or Macayo's? Oh hell no! My wife and I turned to Yelp and decided to try this place called Anaya's Fresh Mexican Restaurant. I have added this photo of what was left of my combination plate which consisted of a ground beef burrito, chicken taco, rice and beans. Was it good? Barely... I hesitate to give Anaya's 4 stars and think it really deserves three. After all, who really wants to have a ground beef burrito when you can have a shredded beef or carne asada burrito, but they don't offer it (disappointment) and I thought \"what the heck,\" It has been years since I've had a Taco Bell burrito. Yes, I finished everything on my plate. Burrito was a two, chicken taco was a three, rice was a three, beans were a five, chips and salsa were a five and the service was a four. My wife had the Enchiladas De Spinacas. If she were on Yelp, she would probably give her dinner a five star review. Me, a three star review. We will be back, not anytime soon and I will try something different like the Pollo Con Crema."}
{"text":"I like the place so far, the breakfast burritos are awesome.  I had also ordered the pollo fundido but that is just okay.  The chips and salsa are fantastic and the service is always good.  I like the casual atmosphere, you can tell it was a fast food place because they have a drive thru but I think that is only for pick up now.  I would have to say it is the nicest casual Mexican place I have been too."}
{"text":"I was really skeptical coming to this restaurant because there were only 5 reviews. 

The interior seating reminds me of some of the local restaurants in Mexico. Brings back joyful memories and a sense of comfort.  
The host was friendly and welcoming. Our waitress was very nice and helpful with the menu. 

I ordered the chicken mole which was tasted fresh and delicious! My wife had a mini-chimichanga with shredded chicken. She also enjoyed the food. My 5-year old son ate his rice and beans. He doesn't normally eat well at restaurants if he doesn't like the food. He loved it!

They also have a full bar with 2 flat screens hanging at both ends.

The service and food here is excellent and I am definitely coming here more often. 

5 stars!"}
{"text":"Met a coworker up at this place at first glance it looks like a generic Mexican restaurant chain that ends with bertos. Once I stepped in I thought I was in Narnia, colorful walls and animated tables and chairs filled the room. They were playing traditional regional mexican music reminded me of my friend Alan's house ( he's a Mexican that I met looking for work outside Home Depot) . The menu has fair prices for the quality of food they serve I ordered the huevos rancheros with a Jamaica ( you get one free re fill). The waiter was very friendly he looks like aziz ansari he was very efficient. All in all it was a good experience. I will be coming back to try the melon margarita."}
{"text":"Once again I go to a new place based off of someone's else's review  and it was underwhelming. The customer service was great but they nickel and dime you on the kids meal. Almost everywhere I have gone they don't charge you for drink with a kids meal. They charge you for a drink. I ordered a simple cheese crisp for my daughter and it comes out basically burnt and they walk away saying enjoy. It's was so crispy it was dark brown. The cheese was stiff. My pollo fandido was ok. I would definitely not pay almost $8 for a kids meal for something that is so so and they mess up over a tortilla and cheese item"}
{"text":"Great Mexican food...no wait on a Friday night. ..be careful when asking for a hotter salsa...boy is it HOT!! Good was great...got chicken enchiladas. .very good..a must try!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Our waiter was very nice and service was quick. The food was also delicious. Usually when I go to a Mexican food place I am disappointed, but not here. I ordered a chicken chimichanga enchilada style and it was amazing!!!The salsa was very spicy and yummy! I love it here. Will definitely be coming back since I live so close and the service is great."}
{"text":"Always good and always friendly service. Have even ordered dishes that weren't on the menu and they made it no problem and it came out great. No complaints at all. Definitely worth stopping by and trying for yourself."}
{"text":"Definitely my new favorite Mexican restaurant.  This is my third time here to get the seafood chimi... It is absolutely to die for."}
{"text":"It's good food (what the rest of my party had) and great service, but my entree fell short. It wasn't bad just unremarkable. I mark a good Mexican restaurant by how well they make their chile rellenos - this one had the seeds still in it. Which shows lack of attention to details in prep and just ruins the chile. It was flavorless and I pushed it aside. Super attentive servers.  Fast refills. Really good prices for food and drinks, including Margaritas."}
{"text":"Great customer service, they always make you feel like you are family. Food is good. I get the chipotle chicken and it is amazing."}
{"text":"Anayas is one of the best Mexican restaurants I've eaten at.  Their salsa is wonderful.   I usually don't do too spicy, but where this salsa is concerned, I  can't stop eating it.  The staff is friendly and helpful and the food is excellent.  I especially like their red child tamale.  I've already recommended Anayas to family members and a friend.   If you're looking for good Mexican food, I recommend Anayas."}
{"text":"Good authentic food, service and very clean! My son and i enjoyed our visit there! I recommend it!"}
{"text":"\"Fresh\" is the key word here. I ordered (at the waitress' suggestion) a chicken and vegetable fry with Spanish rice. Although not as spicy as I would've imagined/hoped, it tasted like a home-cooked meal. Tender chicken, crisp vegetables, flaky rice, and a tangy sauce that didn't seem to be loaded with MSG. Very large servings. Easy parking. I was one of only two people dining here on a Tuesday night. Not a place I would go out of my way for, but highly recommended for those staying in or near the neighborhood."}
{"text":"We were visiting the area, we were looking for a nice Mexican restaurant for breakfast on Sunday morning we found ANAYAS, WAS NOT disappointed, good was delicious I had the shredded beef enchiladas with two perfectly cooked eggs(over easy)
My husband had chimmichangas with red sauce and two eggs, coffee delicious (my husband put 2 cups of cream and a lb of sugar,not a coffee drinker) our server was Lety, very nice, very personable...delish food. thank you."}
{"text":"First let me tell you how picky I am when it comes to Mexican food, I will drive 30 minutes to eat at my favorite Mexican restaurants. I was recommended to try this restaurant that is 2 minutes away. Let me tell you I was pleasantly surprised the food is actually really good. 

Food; Posole was actually one of the best I have ever had, this will be my place just for Posole. Also, Michelada is by far the best I have ever had, perfect amount of ingredients where you can still taste the beer. My daughter had the shrimp cocktail, she didn't like that they don't remove the tails but over wise very delicious. 

Service; our Server was so sweet, it appeared she may have been the only one working so drinks were not refilled super quick, but she was a doll. 

New favorite place"}
{"text":"Was craving fried ice cream this was the first place I could find...boyfriend ordered five tacos it was taco Tuesday he loved every single one of them kept saying \"oh my gosh they are so good best tacos I've ever had\" my fried ice cream was just OK it cost about five dollars it was kind of small but it taste all right the tacos were very good though we will be back to try more"}
{"text":"This place is really good! So close to giving a 5star!  Best meal I've had in a long while.  Outstanding service, the margarita (whoa) muy peligroso! 
The prices are a little steep, but the food and service make up for it.  My server Lety was the best!  
I'll definitely be back!!! Many times."}
{"text":"A place that probably won't last, which is too bad. There's nothing bad to say about the restaurant, service, or food. Unfortunately there isn't anything good to say about the food either. The food is fine, it's just not worth going back for. Gave 4 stars because its clean & servers are nice."}
{"text":"Some of these negative reviews crack me up... \"My taco was greasy!\" Are you serious? lol

This place is amazing. The ingredients are always fresh, staff is very friendly, and the micheladas are the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"Great service and VERY CLEAN (oh yeah the food is good too) I'm not on this side of the valley often but I'm glad I tried Anaya's!"}
{"text":"I have been here about twenty times. It was good from the start, but, every time there is some little improvement that impresses me even more. Last night I had theh 9 oz New York Strip medium rare, rice, whole pinto beans, a chile relleno. and some flour tortillas.  I always dump a whole little dish of their fresh salsa on my rice. I also had a margarita the way I prefer them with Cointreau and Corralejo Blanco Tequila. Everything was very tasty.  I will get the exact same thing next time."}
{"text":"Been to this location and the one on T-bird & 59th. Both are great in terms of food & service. This one actually has a drive thru, which is awesome for those lazy, don't wanna cook days. Their food is so fresh and flavorful. Bonus points for their chips always being fresh and warm, not old and stale like some places. Salsa was a bit too salty but still quite tasty. I ordered the Filete Marinero. It's a hefty tilapia portion smothered with a white Mexican cream sauce cooked with thinly sliced onions. Absolutely delicious! My only gripe is how much of that cream sauce they loaded on. They could lighten up a tiny bit. Despite this, still one helluva dish. 
Rice & beans surprisingly good. I'm a rice snob at Mexican restaurants. I will judge rice and it can determine if I will return to a place. Yup, I said it... I'm a rice judger! Theirs measures up- its fluffy, moist and flavorful. The perfect accompaniment to a good Mexican meal. They also have a full bar with great drink specials. Lotsa good looking desserts that I plan to try at some point. 
Service is always on point, both locations. Such friendly staff. You're doing good, Anaya's! Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Much more like the mexican food we eat in Mexico.  Terrific service, terrific looking place, outstanding margaritas (huge bargain at happy hour), and great food.  Wish we lived nearby - we would be regulars!!!!"}
{"text":"Great little spot.  Friendly staff every time we are there.  There hasn't been anything on the menu that hasn't been really good. I think my fave is the spinach enchiladas.  Well, maybe the margarita."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try Anayas for a while now but my husband was skeptical. He either wants Macayo's for sit down or Filiberto's for drive thru. Anaya's is a little bit of both.  

Stopped in on a Friday night around 6:30 to find it empty except 1 table with 3 diners. That was a red flag but we were greeted promptly and the restaurant was exceptionally clean, even the restrooms were spotless. We were seated quickly and immediately were given chips and salsa, and without asking they brought out basically tomato sauce for my 5 year old son. He was ecstatic, he had his own salsa and it made him feel special.

I wasn't really feeling Mexican..I know, I know, so I just ordered a cheese crisp. My husband ordered the Expresso Burrito with Asada, the child ordered off the kid's menu. All items are only $3.99 and come with either rice & beans or fries. He wanted the kid's cheese crisp. I tried to get him to order something else..so we could share, but he wasn't having it.  My husbands Aunt ordered a Pastor street taco with rice. 

Food came out quickly and was plated attractively.  My cheese crisp looked run of the mill, but I have to say it was exceptional. I'm really can't place what they did to that tortilla but it was delightfully crisp..almost like it was deep fried.  Husbands burro was of good size but he said the meat was cooked to much. I tried it and I would order it next time. To me the meat was carmelized from the grill and had excellent flavor. Aunt said the Pastor was good, she would visit and order the same thing again.  I did try the son's rice & beans. The beans had a good taste but the rice was just run of the mill spanish rice.

Our first dining experience at Anaya's was a excellent one, and it's a place we keep on our list. For 3 adults and a child our bill was only $40 and that included a margarita, Dos XX's and a soda. Fresh, fast food in a friendly, clean atmosphere. I hope they survive in this economy, it's a great neighborhood restaurant."}
