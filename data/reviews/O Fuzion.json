{"text":"Très bon restaurant pour livraisons, habituellement rapide (un peu moins en heure de pointe) la nourriture est toujours chaude. Je n'ai jamais eu de problèmes dans ma commande (JustEat) et le livreur était très sympathique à chaque fois ! Le général tao est excellent (la sauce goûté beaucoup l'ail il faut apprécier) riz frit au poulet basic, egg rolls et rouleaux de printemps dans la moyenne, côtelettes de porc a l'ail excellente.  je recommande !"}
{"text":"I ordered delivery. Dinner for 2 option. Contained fried rice, general tao chicken, beef brocoli and egg rolls. Food was delivered warm. When I had proceeded to pour the rice onto my plate I noticed an odour coming from it. The fried rice smelled like it was old and should have been thrown out. It was very unpleasant. It smelt like a week old fried rice was just warmed up and served. Everything else was fine though."}
{"text":"Just placed an order.  Went through the process of creating an account and all.  Less than 5 minutes later, I get a voicemail message saying my order has been canceled.  Is this how you do business?  I can order from any place I want to, and chose your business.  However, you chose not to complete an order. 

First time, last time."}
{"text":"I've ordered delivery from this place a few times and we really love it. 

It's another one of those confusing \"Asian fusion\"  places that Montreal has a ton of (I don't quite understand it) Chinese AND Sushi. 

This review is solely for the Chinese as I have not tried the sushi. Need to work up some courage for that. 

This place serves a significantly better quality of the food court style Asian food. The type of food you want when you have a bit of a hangover or are tired/sick and want something comforting, affordable and a ton of leftovers. 

The portions are amazing. They do either set meals for a certain number or you can choose separate dishes. Set meals come in smaller containers, individual dishes larger. But they are always JAM PACKED.

Tons of meat/protein, they do not skimp, and everything is cooked right. 

Best general tso's I've had in Montreal, and they're huge/crispy battered, but still juicy, giant pieces of real chicken. 

Always satisfied, and the delivery driver has always been super polite and friendly. This is our go to place on rainy or harder than usual days."}
{"text":"Love ordering delivery from this place when craving junk Chinese food. Affordable and tasty meal options. We always order the General Tao which they make with white meat and just the right amount of batter. Honestly, one of the best general tao that we've had. The pieces are chunky and generous unlike many other places that serve it as empty fried dough balls. Hunan beef and sesame beefs are pretty good too. We usually get a combo and are never disappointed. Delivery is quick (30 mins) and so easy via just eat."}
{"text":"I literally saw LeeLee's review of this place come through on the Yelp homepage and then placed my order within like 5 minutes of reading it. So you know, the system works!! 

To be honest what initially appealed to me about her description was yes, that the food was actually good and affordable, but also, that I could order online. Because the Venn diagram of when I want to eat basic, comforting Chinese/American food like fried rice and General Tao chicken, and when I don't want to talk to other human beings, is pretty much a circle. I just want the food to come to me while I hide and watch bad TV and recover my dwindled reserves of interaction energies, and ordering online speaks deeply to my whiny soul at those moments. 

So I ordered online from O Fuzion and it was actually fun and literally painless. They have several meal options all planned out for you so you don't really have to make decisions. I got a meal for one which included a small hot and sour soup, peanute butter dumplings, a single serving of General Tao, a fried rice with shrimp, a fried beef dish, and a serving of vegetables. I think it was supposed to come with Imperial rolls too but I was satisfied and also, as mentioned, not interested in talking, let alone complaining. Myself and a friend who popped over (fortunately after I had eaten a bunch of the soothing and restorative eats) feasted on this \"meal for one\" which cost me $17 plus tax and tip and arrived hot and fresh within 45 minutes of me clicking \"Confirm.\"  A triumph. 

The Genera Tao was actually really great and so was the beef thing. Everything tasted freshly made and had big real chunks of meat which is good if you're hoping to not just eat a mountain of fried dough when you order the General. The veggies and the fried rice had a flavour that for me wasn't quite right for Chinese food, not bad just not quite hitting the flavour spot, but I dosed it in hot sauce and it was OK. Since this is a \"fuzion\" place with Thai food and sushi on the menu maybe someone in the kitchen has a different flavour reference than I do, which isn't a bad thing. I will totally try the Thai food the next time the \"everybody leave me alone but also bring me delicious food\" vibe hits. Looking forward to it!"}
{"text":"Good portion for the price, but the fried rice lacks of flavor. The delivery time is about 1 hour."}
{"text":"Opinion mitigée quant à ce resto ...
J'ai commandé en ligne avec RestoMontreal.
Beau menu, beaucoup de choix ! Difficile de choisir parmi tout ce qu'il y a !
je commande une soupe won ton , un poulet aux arachides avec riz et nouilles Shangai 
Je reçois la confirmation de RestoMontreal 10 minutes après avoir commandé et ils prévoient que la commande sera livrée d'ici 45 min. D'ici là, tout va bien 
1h15 après avoir reçu la confirmation, toujours rien. Je tente d'appeler au resto, aucune réponse...
La commande arrive finalement 1h45 avoir reçu la confirmation...
La Soupe est tiède , mais bonne
Les nouilles Shangai sont finalement des spaghettis avec de la sauce soya et des légumes..
Le poulet aux arachides est bon. La sauce émaux arachides est délicieuse! Le poulet semble avoir été bouilli, ce qui lui donne une drôle de texture.. 
je ne sais pas si je commanderais à nouveau!"}
