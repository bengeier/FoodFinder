{"text":"We love to come here for their pasta night! The service is wonderful. The waitress is always happy to see us and loves to see our toddler, and sometimes they bring him toys to play with while we wait. Never a long wait, good quality food, and the waitress is always very attentive, we never run out of water.  I'm always too full from the pasta to try it, but my husband orders a huge pizza every time to have as well and have leftovers for lunches. He raves about how good it is. This place is great!"}
{"text":"Lisa had the spaghetti napolitana. I had the #9 pizza, ham pepperoni and mushroom. The pasta was cooked aldente and the sauce tasted homemade. My pizza was really good, nice sauce, good cheese, the crust was perfect and the toppings were fresh. They have great specials and they deliver in a limited area. We will order our pizza from here from now on and we will be in again for a meal.  Oh yes, they like their garlic!"}
{"text":"We ordered pizza take-out. Large with green peppers, salami, and tomatoes, and added feta.  It was ready on time, there was a lot of cheese on it (too much?) and none of it tasted like feta, and there were no obvious feta chunks on it. So I'm not sure if it wasn't a flavourful one or they missed it, but feta should always be tasted.  Overall it was a bit greasy, nothing special. The toppings were fresh and it was tasty.  Going to try dining in and try a pasta next time."}
{"text":"Stopped in with my wife and kids for pre mother's day meal.  Service was excellent, food was outstanding!  Double baked potato was unreal, and a 10 oz New York steak for $19 was fantastic!  Would recommend this neighborhood family run restaurant!"}
{"text":"Tried this place with my family as the reviews seemed positive. The location is in a little plaza, nothing fancy but the interior is kept clean. We checked out the menu and I realized no menu or meal options for kids! We placed our order and we didn't wait long for our meal. Drinks are served on a small mason jar which is cute but for 2.50 and no refills was a little steep. So for our family of 5 , I found it overpriced for what you get personally.  It may be a family restaurant but it's not what I expected. Food was hot and fresh and waitress was friendly"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Fantastic service. Great price for what you get. This place is awesome!"}
{"text":"Our extended family loves this small restaurant. It is frequently the location of our family get together meals. It blows a chain restaurant out of the water with value and taste. Very clean and a gentle atmosphere, not loud with posters and clutter but friendly and homey if you understand my meaning. My roommates make it their choice restaurant for ordering pizza take out and we have never been disappointed. The chicken wings leave a bit to be desired in meatiness but the flavour is always tasty."}
{"text":"My fianc√©e and I recently moved to Coventry Hills, just around the corner from Palermos. We went for Monday pasta night, $6.95 pasta chosen from a menu of about 10 different dishes. The restaurant is small, cozy and comfortable, with a decent selection of bottled beer, but not a huge bar. Definitely a neighbourhood family restaurant. The service was the best part, the waitress was super nice and quite charming. The calamari was yummy, however it had a thicker batter than we normally prefer, but that is just us. The pasta, for $6.95, was a steal.  The portion was perfect, the ham and mushroom was much better than the Vongole.  It also came with garlic toast which was nice. A lot of people were eating the baked lasagna, so I plan to try that next time. Good experience, will definitely go back on pasta night the next time we feel like going out for a quick close bite to eat, but probably wouldn't pay the full menu price."}
{"text":"They have delicious pizza, are always welcoming and friendly! It is a great local restaurant. They have excellent prices."}
{"text":"Eat here quite often,  the Palermo Special pizza is super good if you like a everything style of pizza.  Never had bad food and always fast delivery and resonably priced!"}
{"text":"Palermo's is a great local family restaurant.  They are available for dine-in, take-out, or delivery.  This restaurant specializes in pizza and pasta... all for a reasonable price.  I have no complaints about the pizza.  It's fresh, fast, and mighty tasty!  It has a nice homemade feel to it, unlike most of the other pizza places.  When I eat Palermo's pizza I don't feel like I'm stuffing my face with grease and cheese.  Instead, I feel like I'm getting a healthier, quality pizza.  They are a quick, inexpensive alternative to the regular pizza places you're used to.  They offer many different pizza's all with fresh ingredients.  If you're not in the mood for pizza, try one of their other menu items, like pasta or salad.  They have a wide menu and everything is sure to please!  If you live in the surrounding areas and haven't tried Palermo's yet, you're missing out.  Give them a call, you won't be sad you did!"}
{"text":"I dont really like the pasta here, its very bland and lacks spices. I do love their chicken cordon bleu in mushroom sauce though. So if you want to try anything here, thats my suggestion!"}
