{"text":"Pro: good price, really big portion, looks clean, tasty Con: slow and long waiting, =(  Overall good experience except the long waiting again."}
{"text":"I've been a regular customer at this restaurant for over a year now. Each time I've been to the restaurant - whether I was picking up food or eating at the restaurant - the staff was extremely rude (excluding the one friendly Asian lady with very short hair). They started off by giving me tea cups with bugs in them... All I have to say is that they have no idea how to treat customers. The service is bad and the servers are just awful!"}
{"text":"I always love going to Pho because it's fast, cheap, and relatively satisfying. I think because of that, I don't have too high an expectation for the restaurant surroundings or service (unless it's beyond terrible of course..). Pho Mi was exactly the restaurant that fills this situation. The restaurant is by no means fancy, it's kind of dark inside, the food presentation isn't the best, and the server doesn't really do much.....BUT, the food is alright, and is quite affordable.  I ordered a large \"special\" pho that came with all the typical ingredients that you'd expect: beef balls, tripe, tendon, flank, beef, etc. I have to admit, the pho here was really good. They used authentic pho noodles that were cooked just right, and the beef was a really good cut of meat. Of course the soup was basically all MSG, but I found it wasn't as bad as a lot of other pho places. The portions was also huge! The bowl was actually bigger than my head.   I wouldn't seek this place out, but at least I wouldn't refuse to come back. If I was ever in the area I suppose."}
{"text":"My most frequented lunch spot during the work week. Pho is great, but don't allow yourself to stop short there. Some of the other great items are the curry, pad Thai, fried rice etc. Decent enough service considering there are only 2 girls working the whole floor.   Oh, and the pricing is excellent."}
{"text":"#314 here is the best. I've tried it at other v restaurants to try to find a better replacement, hoping to find one closer to home, but no. Of coz this is not the only item that's good, it's just my fav. Value wise this place is still good, unlike fine v restaurants that jacked up their prices in recent years. Waitresses are very friendly, restaurant is clean."}
{"text":"Food is always consistently good. Always hot and fresh.  Service is pretty decent, they are always nice and friendly.  I usually order T12 which is the Thai chicken coconut soup, which is delicious.  Also order 802 which is a rice noodle with steamed vegetables and a choice of chicken or beef.  Portions are huge and anything you don't finish can go home with you.  I have been coming here for a few years and always enjoy the food. I will continue to come back. Decently priced and good for the family."}
{"text":"Decor is outdated...more like ghetto....and it seems that the staff has no understanding of cleanliness.  What's worse, they come and wipe the dirty table that they seat you at with a smelly towel.  How is one to enjoy a meal when the table smells like dirty *ss?  The staff, they seem to get ruder with each visit.  And one of my pet peeves, when people speak another language meanwhile looking and pointing at you.  WTF is that?  Not sure why but I went back giving it another chance 4 or 5 times now...I've learned my lesson and will never go back.  The first visit I was actually impressed with the food and since that first visit, it gets worse each time.  The pho consisted of a big bowl of noodles all stuck together and maybe two slices of edible beef.  The remaining pieces of beef could not be recognized, concealed in all that fat.  Tried quite a few different menu items and sadly nothing satisfying.  I'd rather drive 25 minutes or more to go get a good bowl of pho."}
{"text":"Cheap price, big portion, great broth definitely one of the best in the area. But the cleanliness was a minus as expected in any pho restaurant. Service is very friendly recommended to 2 of my friends who are also pho enthusiasts and they agree with rating.  I got the Pho dac biet (Large) for 8.00 tax non-included. Lean meat almost no fat on it and comes in great quantity.  4/5 just because of the lack of cleanliness"}
{"text":"My favorite Vietnamese restaurant when visiting Toronto from New York. I typically always get these two usuals   1 - 7 Course Beef  Order only if you can really eat a lot of food...usually for group eating Also quite hands on as you are eating lots of wraps using Rice paper, lettuce and of course different versions of cooked beef.    2 - Durian milkshake Its like heaven =)   Spring rolls are good too.  Not sure about all the other poor reviews about the Pho beef noodle soup  as I've never tried it.  Everytime I'm in town from Buffalo, NY and bring friends, they are rave about the 7 course beef too!"}
{"text":"Terrific Pho place. I can't count the number of times I've been here, but it's almost always my go to when I want a delicious bowl of pho or vermicelli.   Their selection of food is great, although similar to other pho restaurants. I do wish they had rice flour rolls though.. But their Viet iced coffee is spot on.   Service is always amazing here. They're extremely friendly, welcoming and prompt. I can't say enough good things.   Highly highly recommended."}
{"text":"Friendly and authentic! Never disappointed with any dish I've ordered here. It's hard to find a place that fits my taste buds. From the generous salad/cold/fresh rolls with pork and shrimp to the massive Pad Thai and the authentic Pho. This place is always on point!"}
{"text":"We went back to this place and enjoyed the Pho . The reason I am changing my review is we ordered the chicken wings and they were bloody inside which was fucking disgusting and worrying. The very nice waiter half apologized and suggested that we ask for them well done next time. Maybe it is me but I didn't think this is something you have to specify."}
{"text":"Place looks average, not too clean, but half decent.  Absolutely aweful service!  Dropped in when they aren't really busy but still waited 10 minutes with menu closed to have somebody walk up and ask 'hot or cold tea?'  Few minutes later a kid with pants halfway down his ass literally dropped a cup and kettle on the table and stalked off.  Just for service alone was considering walking out but was pretty hungry and in the mood for some pho.  Got the medium Pho Tai Chin, arrived about 10 minutes later, it's pretty huge and looks decent.  That's as far as the compliments go, the broth is bland, noodles even more so and the quality of the beef is mediocre.  Will not be coming back here."}
{"text":"I've eaten here about 10 times over the last six months and have the following to report.  The food can be hit or miss it seems most recently that my well-done beef has been served with nothing but a lot of fat.  also I should note that many of their Thai style dishes were not very enjoyable.    There a few hits:  pork and shrimp cold roll, golden chicken curry, wonton egg noodle soup, bun with bean curd, shredded pork, beef, steamed egg, fried egg.    This place is cheaper then Vaughan mills area, but the quality is lower.  It has always been busy and I've never noticed other reviews of dirtiness."}
{"text":"Food is great, never disappoints. The grilled beef with rice and store fried mixed vegetables with tofu are my favorites. Their Thai fried chicken is also amazing!"}
{"text":"Came here for a quick bite and the soup was awesome! I was hesitate at first as there are many great pho restaurants in markham and toronto but this place didn't disappoint. Quick, fast and easy. The broth was authentic and the beef was yummy! I would definately go back again!"}
{"text":"Friendly and authentic Vietnamese cuisine. The staff are polite and have good customer service. The bun rieu is probably the most authentic I've tasted in comparison to other Vietnamese places. Similar to homemade bun rieu. The broth is nice and hot and comes with a good amount of meat and noodles. The stir fried noodles are stand out here. Over good service and good Vietnamese food for a decent price"}
{"text":"This is the worst restaurant in Vaughan. The food are bad and dirty. Never want to set my foot in."}
{"text":"Had diner, price still reasonable and food okay! Large beef special was $8.50. Spring roll came out no flavour and no more credit card! Cash only wtf"}
{"text":"New to the neighborhood. Was originally from dt coming up here is just as good!!! Food is good and price is not bad also."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and while it's not a fancy place, it is good value for your money. It's one of those go to places when you want cheap eats that are far from the pizza, panino places in the vicinity.  The pho is well done and they offer a large and varied menu featuring vietnamese, chinese, and thai options. Fresh garnishes accompany your pho and the small size can easily feed to people when coupled with an appetizer like their spring rolls. The table also has sauces to kick the flavors up in your dish. Take note though, they don't take credit only cash or debit.  So next time, try this place and order the chicken pho with fresh spring rolls, and their chicken fried rice, your wallet will thank you!"}
{"text":"Nice casual pho place. Came here for lunch with my employees. Pretty mixed crowd between casual and office employees and construction workers  Nice portion of noodle and meat for a nice price of 8.50  Great tasting broth!  Friendly and on point service!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love Viet Thai!   Service: 10/10 I'm reading a lot of people think it's slow but I've never found it to be that way. No matter who is working (the two girls or the three guys), they always ask how our meal is at some point and are always cheerful  Food: this is the only pho place where their dishes are consistent throughout. Their vermicelli, rice, pho, pad thai and shakes are all tasty and fresh  Would recommend :)"}
{"text":"Many years ago this was our Go-To place for a steaming bowl of PHO, before the days of Vaughan Mills and the development that grew around it.  It was a POPULAR lunch spot as it had a bit of a monopoly as the only Viet/Thai place around.  In comparison to the newer spots in the area, I enjoy the various Beef toppings but the noodle can be SOFT at times.  It has a bit of a special LAY-OUT as it sits on a corner spot of the plaza.  Inside, the back corners are DARK booths while the center has larger round tables for groups.  Surrounding the CENTER COURT is a large \"C\" one step up that gives it a different landscape as it has railings separating it, a terrace feel?  The UPPER DECK as I call it is nice and bright as there is surrounding windows where you can look out to the plaza and street but at the same time a large TREE gives some shade.  I find that you can actually enjoy a NICE chat as I've done before.  It doesn't ECHO sounds like other larger Pho places and that I've noticed there's less KIDS as well."}
{"text":"My fav local pho restaurant. Great soup base and fair pricing. If I ever feel like a hot bowel of noodles, this is my go to place. Servers are always fast and very friendly. Their TVs hung from the ceilings are horrible though. Time to change them or simply get rid of them."}
{"text":"It's good pho. It's cheap pho. It's fresh pho. It's just right.  Seriously too much goes into reviewing a bowl of beef broth soup. The meat is tender and delicious. Not fatty. Broth is aromatic, fresh, and flavourful. A bowl costs $6.50, $7.50, or $8.50 for small, medium or large. Service is friendly and fairly fast. Lots of table options including salt pepper soy sauce hoisin and chillies.  Again that dated age look is what you typically find with good places and this one is no exception. The dates tube tv and oak wood finishes everywhere is just a bonus.Would be happy to return if I was in the area.  Lots of free parking and other places to try and eat as well in the same plaza. Can't go run parking in here.  4.5 out of 5.0 rounded up."}
{"text":"Pretty much your standard, inexpensive Viet resto offering up decent food and nofrills service. The service part isn't really that horrendous; it's pretty much in line with what you'd get at most standard Viet restaurants, though there has been a slight shift in the industry to improving that, I've noticed. If you're a regular at Vietnamese restaurants, you'll pretty much know what to expect. I didn't think that the clientele in this area would be ready for this type of service, but they've been open for this many years now, so I guess I was wrong.   The pho is ok. I've since switched over to trying their stir-fried dishes (e.g. stir-fried rice noodles) and surprisingly they are quite good, even better than many Chinese restaurants."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a place for dinner after shopping at vaughan mills or a day at wonderland, Pho Mi Viet Thai is a good option!   The restaurant has plenty of seatings but it does get very busy during dinner time.  We got there around 7 on a Saturday night and the place was full. We were able to get seats after around 5 mins as two small tables have just left (we were a large group but ended up splitting for two small tables to avoid wait time). Good news is I believe they take reservation, so recommend to call ahead if you are have a big group.   I ordered 511 (grilled chicken or pork + crab meat steam egg rice) $7.5.  Both the portion and price is good.  Food is delicious as well. However the wait time for food was a little longer than I expected (but then I'm comparing  to super fast service at other Viet restaurant haha). My friend's soup pho came shortly after ordering, but those of us who ordered a rice dish had to wait another about 15-20 mins after his pho was served - which was a bit awkward.  And lastly, on the menu it has a sticky that says the menu does not reflect the updated price, please ask your server. So you would not know the exact price of each dish unless you ask the server. But based on our experience, at most it was a $1 more than the menu listed price, so it wasn't too bad. Regardless, hopefully they update the menu soon for clarify.    Overall I would come back again if Im in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Nice place to eat, the people are nice and friendly and the food is good. They made a mistake with my order of spring rolls but they corrected it. Unfortunately I had to drive back from my house because it was a takeout order."}
{"text":"I was in the area and decided I wanted some pho. Delicious authentic Vietnamese beef noodle soup. Best pho I've had in awhile. Service is great, attentive and there are servers who speak perfect English too! Perfect place to grab a quick and delightful meal"}
{"text":"This place is close to where my friends live, so naturally, when they suggested to eat there I agreed. I have never been there before and I usually don't miss a chance to explore a new pho place. Ok, so here comes:  1. Interior/ambiance: non-existent/generic.  2. Food: average, unremarkable. 3. Service: not bad, above average. 4. Menus look like they are the same age as the servers. I'm not kidding! :-/"}
{"text":"Pho Mi Viet Thai serves it's purpose as a Pho Joint that provides a satisfy meal at a decent price.  Services though slow but we eventually got what we ordered.  Special Pho Large ($7.50) is good for a meal for one or something to share with a friend as a snack. Broth is quite savoury and have star anise kick. Beef and noodle quite standard and both A-OK.  Hot Vietnamese Coffee with condensed milk ($3.00) is just too strong and sweet for me. I don't really like to be too caffeinated and sugar high at the same time.  Pho Mi though looks dated and a little sketchy..  remind me of the old days...  11/15"}
{"text":"I came here for dinner with a group on the recommendation of a friend. It's located in the same plaza as WaffleU, so it wasn't difficult to find parking. We ordered a number of dishes, including the chicken congee, a golden curry with beef, Chinese broccoli, and a cat fish in a clay pot. The congee was just okay, but the chicken was tasty. The curry was just okay as well. The beef and vegetables tasted fresh, but the curry tasted like the type that comes from Golden Curry brand cubes. If it does, I guess it was just as advertised. Of the dishes, I liked the cat fish the most. The marinade was tasty and the fish was soft. Maybe I'll stick with pho next time."}
{"text":"This place has become my go to Pho place for cheap and good. Yes the service is okay but food is consistent and the family run business model works well for me."}
