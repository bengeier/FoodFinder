{"text":"What a complete disappointment. It has gone all the way downhill. I used to enjoy this place a lot when it was good and it was expensive. Now the sushi is cheap and it shows. There must have been a change of ownership. The rice tastes wrong, the fish is cut wrong. The shrimp in the dynamic roll looks and tastes more like a frozen spring roll. The food is seriously just barely edible."}
{"text":"This place is terrible. The only reason I gave this place a shot after experiencing their sloppy food is because it's so close to engineering campus.

A word of caution for those who care:
None of the non-sushi items are vegetarian it turns out. Before I order something, I usually make a point to double-check. When I asked about the 'vegetable teriyaki', the guy rudely said 'that's why it says vegetable'.

When I received my plate after his reassurance, I noticed some meat in the dish. I took the thing back to him, and he refused to talk to me because he said 'I wasn't a customer'! What?! I lost it when he told me to get out of the line.

Bottom line is that place has bad service, is extremely inhospitable, and is not suitable for vegetarians. Furthermore, after the owner had to get involved, I learned that the all sauces/broths have some chicken in them. I can understand when someone makes a mistake. I hate when people who cannot admit it when it happens and make no attempt to rectify the situation afterwards."}
{"text":"Don't let the name deceive you, because this is a one-stop Asian food shop, not just for sushi, which is what I originally thought, and consequently didn't come here for four years. The menu is huge, definitely biased toward sushi and sushi rolls, but contains other things like rice porridge, teriyaki, or noodle soup. 

I had a sushi roll, which was, expectedly, pricey and did not fill me up, but the following time I enjoyed a very agreeable bowl of vegetable congee. I'm usually wary of places that try to cook such a huge menu of foods, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that they are doing a pretty ok job of it.  

Definitely stop by, at least once, it's worth a look."}
{"text":"I usually come here about once every two weeks. And I keep coming back here because there's no other place where you can get three delicious sushi rolls for $10 on campus or frankly anywhere in Illinois. This place get too many negative reviews about the quality of the sushi, but obviously, at these prices, you won't get the best quality out there."}
{"text":"Great place for sushi with amazing prices. The sushi is made to order and the ingredients are super fresh! Combo meals come with a delicious spring roll. I ordered a vegetarian roll that came with veggies as well as tofu inside, the consistency was perfect. It is often rare to find a decent veggie sushi roll, but the chefs at Sushi Ichiban know what they are doing. 

Only problem I encountered is that there is a $7 minimum if you are paying with credit card. This is not an issue of you are getting a combo roll.

Highly recommend, will definitely go again!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Sushi Ichiban for the past three years. Initially, I was skeptical about this place because the appearance of it reminds me of a Chinese restaurant with all of the printed out pictures and unmatching outdated marketing strategies - However, the more frequently I come here, the more nostalgic it becomes when I eat sushi at other restaurants. It's extremely inexpensive and very basic sushi, but their flavors are so unique and hard to find anywhere else - 

I typically order the any three roll. I highly recommend ordering the dynamite roll, palatine roll, and fancy roll. I have never seen a roll with deep fried sweet potatoes, shrimp, and cream cheese. The dynamite roll is so memorable, sweet, and delicious. Additionally, the palatine roll is served with a generous amount of eel and salmon. This roll would probably cost about $15+ at any other sushi restaurant. It's delicious. Lastly, the fancy roll - the fancy roll is mashed up with raw salmon and avocado wand some special brown sauce. Although it's simple, it's tasty, umami, and yummy. Also, I get a complementary egg roll with free additional ginger and spicy mayo with the combo - Such a deal!"}
{"text":"The Good:
-The sushi itself is pretty good, not fantastic, but good. The rolls are a little sloppy, but not too bad. 
-The prices are fantastic, and definitely good for a college student. 
The Bad:
-The miso soup is just not good. The tofu chunks are enormous (around 1\"x1\"), and the broth has very little flavor.
-The service is meh, no waiter service, unless you get All You Can Eat."}
{"text":"Obviously, at these prices you're not going to get top quality sushi. But the lunch specials (3 rolls for $10, 2 for $8) are good deals."}
{"text":"Nice sushi roll restaurant just near the library. Lunch discount offered for sushi rolls. Fish goes good usually but it might be bad depending on your luck. Congee tastes good but a little be pricey. I am always full after eating 2 sushi rolls."}
{"text":"Price is nice I was able to get 6 pieces of a salmon roll for $4 (plus about .38cents tax). The rolls weren't huge (like mini logs they were about an inch and a half in length and the size of about a quarter in width/on circular ends) but they satisfied my sushi-urge/craving (they served as a light snack). So far all I have tried is the salmon rolls and they were delish! And I will be coming back for more! Also really nice staff, as well :)"}
{"text":"Decent place.  Large portions and tasty.  My boyfriend had the sushi which came attractively plated and I had the chicken teriyaki.  He  makes his own sushi and enjoyed his dish, said it was decent.  My dish was a bit bland but a great place for a college student on a budget.  I had leftovers to take home.  Don't expect ambiance and attentive waiters.  Staff were friendly and service quick.  Will go back."}
{"text":"I was really disappointed with my meal today. I didn't have great expectations after reading the reviews, but I figured it would at least satisfy my craving for sushi. Instead, I was thrown off the minute I opened the bag. Instead of sushi soy sauce, it was just plain, cheap soy sauce, which is never a good omen. If you're going to name your restaurant \"Sushi... -anything-\" it's probably a good idea to actually provide the right condiments. 

The quality of the rolls were really poor. They were sloppy, falling apart, and some were sliced paper thin, while others were so large I couldn't even eat them without making a huge mess. The smoked salmon tasted like it had been soaked in liquid smoke instead of actually smoked. It was sour, fishy, and really terrible. The roll that was supposed to have tobikio on it had maybe 3 eggs per piece, which was terribly upsetting because it was the whole reason I'd decided on the roll.

The only thing I enjoyed was the mini egg roll I received. It was hot, crispy, and quite honestly, really delicious. Maybe their regular menu is better, but I will definitely not be ordering sushi from here again."}
{"text":"New management and a new look! They serve great sushi at a reasonable cost.  One of the best places we have been to in Toronto. The new owners are super friendly and the quality of their food  is amazing.  We can't stop going back!"}
{"text":"The fish on the sushi gave my friend food poisoning. Worse part is the manager is literally watching you from the Cameras in the back. 

The worst part is that if you order more of the same sushi they reduce the fish portion and increase the rice amount. I ONLY TASTED STICKY RISE!!!"}
{"text":"Sushi Ichiban has delicious, fresh sushi for an unbeatable price!  I always get one of the 2 or 3 roll sushi specials that come with an egg roll which are $7 for 2 rolls or $9 for 3 rolls for lunch and then $1 more at dinner time. They have the popular sushi rolls you would get in your average Japanese restaurant but a few special rolls as well. 

It has a sort of fast food feel to it because you order at the counter but the taste is better than any of the other sit down sushi restaurants on campus.

I get the take out quite often and they are VERY quick and always do a good job of packing enough condiments. 

I will definitely be eating here several times a week during the school semester - it has become one of my favorite campus restaurants since it's opening."}
{"text":"I first came to Sushi Ichiban coming with very high expectations from what I heard from friends. We came with a group of four of us and we got the all you can eat. At first it was satisfying. The california rolls were tender shedding the upmost vivid memories of my childhood. When I got home, I felt something tingly in my stomach. My intestines were starting to swell. Immediately I ran for the toilet and felt an insatiable desire to poop. I couldn't however because for some reason I couldn't let it all out. I sat back up after twenty minutes and found blood spewing out of my anus. As well, I started to feel something crawling up my throat. Before I knew it I was hurling throw up for minutes. Before coming to Sushi Ichiban make sure you take precautions. Make sure you have your cell phone in hand in case you have to call 911 at any given time."}
{"text":"Decent sushi (for the midwest) and friendly staff. A little pricy though."}
{"text":"When I ate here I got the sushi buffet.  When my friend said that they had a buffet, I expected a normal buffet table with old lukewarm sushi sitting on it, but it turns out that they bring out the sushi fresh to order.  You can order any type of roll or nigiri that they offer (a wide variety) and as much as you can eat.  The sushi tastes great and is plated beautifully.  All of that for $25!  I recommend the sushi here."}
{"text":"Not bad, especially for lunch specials. I ordered the chicken teriyaki lunch special for under $8 and it lasted me for several meals. The chicken teriyaki itself was decent, noodles were not the best but edible, and a salad is a salad. 

In sum, passable food with a big portion that earns its low price."}
{"text":"My friends and I got several rolls of sushi and they were all poorly rolled. They all fell apart and the rice was unevenly distributed on the seaweed. All my rolls looked scraggly. They also didn't advertise that they have edamame but they actually do. The shrimp tempura in my roll was pretty stale as well. Definitely not worth the money I spent."}
{"text":"Sushi ichiban is yet another excellent stop for hungry college kids. After tasting the delicious menu in ko fusion, I had pretty high standard but I was pleasantly surprised. I ordered the 3 roll combo for 10.99, I got the salmon roll, spicy tuna and fancy roll. All three were superb. The fish tasted fresh and the taste was authentic, not to mention it was an incredible deal for that price. I didn't get the chance to try their non sushi dishes though. I'll definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"My Mom has an exchange student from Japan, so she wanted to get her some comfort food or at least something familiar! We've eaten form here before and weren't disappointed. It's always fresh, quality is very good, staff is very friendly and like to talk while they're putting your order together. Provided it's not too busy, in which it wasn't when we dropped in, Sunday afternoon, there was no one in the place. Prices are good and so is the quantity and quality of your food so keep this place in mind when you feel like sushi, there will be no regrets. I'm not a huge sushi/sashimi person but when my wife feels like again we know were to go, Ichiban! And so should you."}
{"text":"The location is close to campus which is a plus. The food here is OK and cheap. Sushi lunch special is a great deal. New York Roll is delicious. Teriyaki chicken is a bit too savory but very filling."}
{"text":"The sushi here can be really good if you know what to order. And the prices are great :)
I always get the lunch special which is any 2 rolls for $9 or any 3 rolls for $11!!!
I Recommend the Michigan and the New York rolls"}
{"text":"You're literally going to get what you paid for. It's decent sushi and can help if you want that quick sushi fix for such a cheap price. They're also fast and friendly and I am super happy I found this place. Very creative rolls--I absolutely love their dynamite roll with shrimp tempura and sweet potato."}
{"text":"After going to Sushi Avenue, man does this place drop in my book. I already have serious qualms with that guy at the counter. And now I realize that Sushi Ichiban has the aesthetic appeal of a hospital waiting room. Unless you want a foam box full of average teriyaki, save your prime dollars for a sushi place that is worth going to... I'll give you a hint, it's on Green Street."}
{"text":"It's cheap and decently fresh sushi. We are in the middle of nowhere - fish can't exactly be delivered and prepared on the same day, so don't go in expecting something fancy. Like its rating, it's A-OK sushi. Sushi Ichiban has a huge menu though, and they offer Chinese food along with a wide range of sides, appetizers, and drinks. You can even get packaged food to go if you're in a rush.

I only go here when I feel a craving for sushi and want to go all out with the all-you-can-eat offer. It's $25/person and you get a menu to mark what you want. Then they bring out your order and when you're done, you can ask for another sheet to order more. The number of choices is quite large and chances are you'll find something you like. I enjoy the sweet potato roll, the Las Vegas roll, New York roll, and the Bubba Gump roll the most. They sometimes look good, but sometimes they look hastily made and are unevenly cut/fall apart. I also hate it when they cram the rolls full of veggies/rice and only a small bit of fish. The miso soup is okay though.

Tip: The raw tuna they use sometimes tastes bad, so eat at your own risk. It's not worth getting something like the spicy tuna roll and having to eat it or pay the $1/piece left uneaten fine. My tuna roll had a strange, fishy taste and the color was a dull reddish-brown with a glossy sheen to it.

Waiter service: almost non-existent. You get water by yourself (grab a pitcher if you have a big party), and the only service is when they bring you your sushi. There is one Caucasian waiter who is really nice and dedicated to good service. He jokes around, is totally friendly, and he works really hard. I dislike the Chinese waiter though because my boyfriend and I were eating together and he gave our order to another couple who didn't even look like us. He literally decided to give it to the first table of two he saw. After a long wait, I asked him about my bf's order because I overheard the couple picking at the rolls and saying they weren't sure if this was their order. He says, \"Oh, I gave it to that table.\" No apology or anything. We had to reorder and wait even longer for his order to come out. They also messed up my order and out of the three rolls I ordered, they completely forgot to give me my third one. 

As a poor student, I guess this is the highlight of my sushi experience when I want okay sushi, but don't want to splurge."}
{"text":"Been coming here for sushi for 4 years now and I love it. It's cheap and always tastes fresh. I don't know how, but they always have fresh avocados."}
{"text":"The sushi is of poor quality. After eating I felt very sick and had stomach problems. Do not get the New York roll it is extremely slimy and the fish tasted old. overall this is a poor quality restaurant"}
{"text":"Main thing to get here is the lunch special 3 rolls, you get to select three rolls from the regular sushi menu which gives back good value and hits the spot for some decent sushi. Obviously it's not on the same level as Sakanaya but it works :)"}
{"text":"DON'T GO! This place made me TERRIBLY SICK twice. The first time I had their raw fish, and I was paralysed the next day (fever/aching everywhere/weak/nausea/diarrhea). I decided to give them a second chance, so I went again with the prior knowledge not to order anything raw. BUT, I GOT THE SAME SYMPTOMS AGAIN. By the way, I'm very used to raw fish, as I've eaten sushi and sashimi growing up. Their food quality is seriously concerning."}
{"text":"Got lunch from here last week.  It's just okay.  Nothing special, nothing bad.  I had the 2 roll lunch special which was $6.99.  I had the shrimp tempura roll and an eel roll, so I can't really comment on the quality of the fish, but what I had seemed to be of decent quality.  

Oddly the sushi combo came with an egg roll which decent as well.  If I feel like eating some sushi this place would suffice without breaking the bank."}
{"text":"If you're craving sushi, don't want anything fancy and want to eat lots of good sushi go to this place. Their 3 roll combo for $10 is guaranteed to leave you full without burning a hole in your wallet. We had also ordered veggie tempuras, but it was undercooked (I thought it was cheese at first but figured out it was tempura batter :P ). We let them know and they promptly gave us a fresh order which was thankfully cookee.  If it weren't for the tempuras i would give this place 4 stars."}
{"text":"Sushi Ichiban is ironically named. It is certainly not ichiban lol. 

I tried their yakisoba and as far as cheap Asian-y takeout-y noodles go, I can't believe I'm saying this, Chopstix does it better. It's edible though so whatever. Lol.

Their sushi rolls were a huge disappointment :c. I got the Palatine Roll. First thing I noticed: they don't know how to roll their rolls. Everything was loose and falling apart. The rice wasn't packed well and it just looked like some amateur rolled it in the dark. With no hands.

Second, the pieces of fish were miserly thin. I've only had thinner pieces at My Thai, which is the worst restaurant that I've ever been to in my life (Not just sushi restaurants. I'm talking out of ALL restaurants). 

Most of the roll was rice or veggies (not even the avocado kind of veggie). Sushi Ichiban engages in the practice of using rice as one of their fillings for an inside-out roll. That means that the rolls are double-stuffed with rice, which I hate because they're cheaping out on you and trying to make it seem like it's all cool. It left me feeling played like they didn't even try. I've been to plenty of cheap ass sushi places that do not double stuff.

The only positive is that it tasted pretty good. I've had some awful sushi and this sushi is not at that level. It's pretty yummy, honestly. But... how many offensive  flavors can cheap, white rice really have..."}
{"text":"I love coming to sushi ichiban for their all-u-can-eat sushi special! At first, I was a bit suspect based on what others have told me and having eaten at places in chicago, but I was pleasantly surprised! They have a large variety of sushi from spider rolls to something called a spicy tuna pizza, which is a rice patty tempura with spice tuna and spicy mayo on top. They should really add to the appetizer portion of the all-u-can-eat menu though. The only thing that really irks me about this place is that they raised the prices by like $8 within a year! WHO DOES THAT!??! Thank the lord my friends have coupons so we were able to still get the deal for a decent price. Overall, the all-u-can-eat deal is good, but only if you have those coups, lol."}
{"text":"It's alright. Not particularly great, it's pretty much just Sarku Japan, as you might expect. Lunch and dinner special prices are good, otherwise the prices aren't too great considering the casual atmosphere. Sushi is okay, but nothing special. Eggrolls and crab rangoon seem to be the same premade stuff you get at alot of places. The teriyaki chicken and beef are pretty decent though."}
{"text":"If you are looking for high quality sushi, the kind that makes your palate sing and your cheeks soften with tenderness, this is not your sushi place. Nor is it a sushi restaurant with great variety of rolls. 

The quality is decent enough, the rolls large, and the meal filling. We ordered 6 different types of rolls (a lot of food -- we were not able to finish), all roughly $5-6 each, and all tasted about the same. Many of the rolls come stuffed with cream cheese. The main flavor difference between them was whether a fried ingredient was also included. Vegetables, too, added a little variation -- the asparagus offered texture. Many of the rolls promise \"crab,\" but the cashier told me that the rolls include imitation crab meat. 

The seaweed salad had a tasty sesame oil dressing. It made a nice contrast as a side. Two of us shared one portion (priced around $6).

The free fried eggroll, a small complementary item, that came with our rolls was not very good. It was room temperature and oily.

The restaurant is clean, but extremely plain and spare."}
{"text":"The best parts about this place would have to be the friendly customer service, little wait time, and cheap prices. That being said, it's good to keep in mind that you get what you pay for when buying cheap sushi. They offer various different rolls, but they all taste the same, with just a slightly different look to them. It's almost as if they use the relatively same ingredients for every roll and just mix and match different sauces on top. You can especially see this if you indulge on their all you can eat option. But I guess you can't complain for the price!"}
{"text":"If you're in the mood for inexpensive, decent-quality sushi on campus, look no further. I went a number of times with my girlfriend and we found that the 3-roll combo was enough to satisfy us both. I wouldn't say we were full, and it definitely wouldn't satisfy the hunger of a busy day, but another inexpensive roll or two probably would have done the trick. The quality of the sushi isn't bad, definitely higher than you would expect from the price tag. I never felt nauseous at all after eating it. Definitely worth stopping in!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I go here on the weekly and it literally is so fresh, consistent and amazing every single time! 10/10!!! Loveeee the staff!"}
{"text":":/  It's alright.

No servers, you must order and come back to the counter to pick up your meal but staff is friendly and courteous. 

Establishment is clean. Water is self serve in styrofoam cups from plastic pitchers near soda fountain machines. 

Spicy & Hot Beef Noodle Soup:
Broth was tasty and spicy as advertised. Ingredients didn't have any of the broth tastiness. Beef was a little chewy/rubbery. Veggies and noodles were fine. 

Miso Soup:
About the size of a can of Campbell's soup."}
{"text":"Service was good. Rolls were okay. I had a cali roll, hubby had an avocado roll and my brother had a salmon roll.

They all looked okay, a bit sloppy. Taste was okay.

Love that there is soy sauce and sriracha on each table. I asked for a side of spicy mayo for my roll, it was good.

The specials here are really good. We came for a snack around lunchtime. 3 rolls, for 10 dollars. It made a great snack."}
{"text":"new grand opening sushi and teriyaki japanese style restaurant in campus, sushi all you can eat only $16.99, lunch special 2 roll $6.99, 3 roll $8.99, chicken teriyaki with white rice only $4.95. and all dinner special only add $1. table is very clean everything looked so great. i like it."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of their 3-roll lunch combo: 3 different types of sushi (about 18 rolls total) for $12. They also give you wasabi sauce and soy sauce on the side. I'm also a fan of their noodle soups.

Sushi Ichiban located close to Green and Wright close to Campustown. It might not be \"authentic Japanese food\" per se, but it's tasty and inexpensive."}
{"text":"The worst fake Japanese food I've ever tried. I recommend them to change their name to \"sushi saiyaku\" which means \"the worst sushi\" lol"}
{"text":"The best sushi place in C-U.  Not exclusively because of quality, but when you factor in their great prices, it takes the cake.  Their lunch specials are a fantastic price, and the best way to order is to call in and order the 3-roll special and when asked what rolls just say \"whatever the chef wants to make\".  The chef doesn't go all cheap when you do this - he puts out his best work in appreciation of the implicit compliment.  This is the only way I order any more."}
{"text":"This is a nice place to get fresh sushi and other Japanese dishes.  The service was friendly.  You order at the counter and pick up when they call your number.  The prices are okay for this sushi place."}
{"text":"I will always rate this place a five out of five stars.
Best bang for your buck sushi on campus, and I would really recommend coming here during lunch time and ordering the three roll combo. I always order the spicy salmon, spicy yellowtail, and fancy roll. That's 18 pieces of sushi for only $10! 
The owners are friendly people and service is always polite and fast."}
{"text":"I'm usually a kofusion girl but my friends and I decided to try this on a whim based on a recommendation from another friend and I'm so glad we did ! We came for lunch and I got 2 rolls for $8.48 which ended being $9.29 with tax but still, I got 11 pieces for $9, which is cheaper than what I would spend at most sushi places. I got a shrimp tempura roll and a Philadelphia roll. The Philadelphia roll was good and the shrimp tempura roll was AMAZING. I would definitely come back here again, although I know the 2 roll combo is more expensive at dinner time so I'd probably come for lunch if I really wanted a great deal. All in all, I'm really glad I checked this place out, my friends and I left very full and satisfied !"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now for the unlimited sushi deal.  It's pretty easy to get your money's worth.  However, like most places on campus, the sushi just isn't that good.  Don't get me wrong, it's not bad.  There's only one roll I've had here which I didn't like, and that's not because it was poorly made or anything; I just didn't like the flavor (the Texas Scorpion, in case you're wondering).  I tend to prefer fancy rolls, but most of the specialty rolls here are pretty similar, and I'd prefer some variety.

I always get a ton of yellowtail when I go, though.  It's pretty tasty."}
{"text":"It's pretty cheap (we paid about $25 for 2 orders veggie tempura, 2 avocado, 1 cucumber, 1 sweet potato, and 1 vegetable roll and were totally stuffed when we were through), but it looks like their specials seem to be where the best deal is at; quality is so-so, nothing to write home about. The place would definitely benefit from some minor renovation...it has this almost kind of like \"Panda Express\" feel to it. I dunno, not a fan of that aspect considering it's a one-of-one as far as I know. It is what it is, but it could be nicer, hip-er even, with not a lot of effort.

P.S. This is where I made my discovery that (since they are super stingy with the sweet sauce) mixing Sriracha with soy sauce is a pretty dang delicious dipping sauce for tempura. I did appreciate that they had a big bottle of hot sauce on every table."}
{"text":"You want some average sushi? Well, here you go. For sushi, it's best to get the lunch special where you can get two sets of rolls for a reasonable price."}
{"text":"I brought my family of 5 to eat at this establishment. I ordered the all you can eat sushi. I wrote on the bottom of the order sheet that I wanted unagi and spicy mayo sauces on the side. I gave the young lady the sheet before I paid. When I received my food the sauces weren't on the side. My wife went up to get the sauces. She came back to the table with 1 sauce. They said I had to pay .50 for the extra sauce. Now if she would have read my order sheet and added the .50 to the total bill I would not have had a problem paying it. However, the lady that was making the food wasn't budging or willing to admit that she was wrong. However, she continues to tell me that I needed to read the menu and I would have known that I would have had to pay the extra .50. I paid with a credit card so the young lady taking the orders took my signed cc receipt and tried to add the .50 to my total. I was like this is illegal. My total bill was $67 and they put up an argument over .50. If .50 is going to hurt your business then you don't need to be in business. 

Now my review of the food sub par at best. My unagi (eel) was over cooked. They didn't give me all the pieces that I ordered per roll. I would not recommend this place to anyone. 

In a service industry you're supposed to take care of the customer/client (Especially when they don't do their due diligence and/or negligent). 

I will never come back. I had a really bad experience."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever!!! The working stuff was really rude and even asked me to f*ed the shut up when I was ordering because I didn't NOTICE he was busy."}
{"text":"Incompetent management, slow and unfriendly staff, less than decent sushi...worst dining experience of my life. I didn't expect much from a fast food sushi place on campus, but I certainly did not expect to be screamed at by the old manager when all I did was simply inquire about my order since I'd been waiting over an hour for TWO rolls of sushi. Rude much? 

Never going back again.I wouldn't recommend it to anyone if it was the last place to eat on Earth."}
{"text":"The place is small and could use a makeover, but it isn't as drab as other places. I went there for dinner, I knew that was a bad choice when I got my receipt-- 2 rolls and a soda for $12? Oy, this better be good sushi-- and it was just okay.

I got the sweet potato tempura and tuna roll. The sweet potato roll was good, though not the best I've ever tasted. I wanted more than fried tempura shrimp in rice and seaweed-- rather too simple from the others that I have tried. The tuna roll left something to be desired-- the tuna was not fresh and lacked a natural \"tuna\" taste I oh so love. Both of the rolls were sloppily made-- both of the rolls were uneven and had more stuffing in others. I like food to be quick, but I also value what I eat. Two more minutes wouldn't have killed me.

The free egg roll that came with my meal was small and was seriously cold. Not worth eating. 

I have a few more days in Champaign, and rather than going there one more time, I will stick to Sushi Rock."}
{"text":"Got the all you can eat way too overpriced for 24.99, sushi variety low no hand rolls, or sashimi variety with basic rolls. Come for the specials, but sushi all taste the same"}
{"text":"Sushi Ichiban likely has the cheapest sushi in town, both in terms of price and quality. I've never had a problem with the service there and I've also spoken to the Chinese store owner on several occasions to arrange large orders for student organized events. Sanitation is a little questionable; I'm not sure they always wipe their knife after cutting and the tables aren't always clean. The stir fry is exactly as you'd imagine what a typical brown stir fry would look and taste like. You get what you paid for."}
