{"text":"Ordered takeout twice now, and I am definitely a fan.  Love that they pack the noodles for the chow mein separate, even cutting a small hole in the container so that the noodles remain crispy.  The sweet and sour pork is well balanced.  The fried rice is not soggy with soy sauce.  It's pale, wokked and delicious.  The shrimp with lobster sauce is generous with shrimp, the sauce is a little gluey, but had great flavour.  The black bean sauce with spareribs were a little meh (needed garlic), but it's hard to beat my mom's.  Very glad I found this place!"}
{"text":"My favourite Chinese delivery!! Great Cantonese chow mein. Great beef with black bean sauce either with or without noodles.  I don't like the wonton soup. It always comes too watery.  The pho is quite good. The broth is delicious!"}
{"text":"On my search of super spicy foods, I just had to enter this place.  Pepper Chili, how can a name sound spicier?  At first glance, the place looked old and crummy and I knew I should have left.  However I decided to take a look at the menu.  I started getting hungry and said, whatever.   I ordered the Spicy Crispy Beef.    10 long minutes later my dish came out.  It was a very small portion laid out on a bed of greens. The greens were soft and flaccid.  The beef was soggy and drenched in a greasy, oily sauce.    I was turned off by the place and decided to get out of there and chow down real quick.  When the time came to pay, my total was 8.99$ plus tax, however on the menu it was $7.99.  When I asked about this, I was told it was an old menu that needed to be updated.   She corrected the price, however it seemed to have annoyed her.  If you are looking for somewhere to eat, just walk a few more minutes east along Gerrard and I'm betting wherever you stop will be better than this."}
