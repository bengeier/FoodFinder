{"text":"This place is a disaster.  Went there with my wife and a couple of friends on the weekend, looking forward to trying a new beer market (as they advertise).  We made a reservation for about 7:30 (which was completely unnecessary as it wasn't really busy at all) and were shown to our table which is a picnic table.  At this point, I should probably mention that this place used to be the Back Alley nightclub which we used to go to from time to time and were quite interested in seeing how they changed it around inside.  Basically they painted, made a few minor changes to some walls, but everything else is exactly the same.  They put up a moveable partition between the dance floor/nightclub side and the \"restaurant\".  A little less than blown away so far, we go to order our drinks.  I love beer and am really looking forward to trying some new craft beers....unfortunately they don't really have anything new or different that I couldn't get at most other pubs in the city.  I settle for ordering my standby Creemore Springs from our waitress (who informs us that it's happy hour and I can get a \"glass\" of beer for $5...ridiculously pricey as I will explain).  I don't want a glass of beer, and am told I can order a quart if I want, which of course I do.  She returns a little while later with our drinks and I shit you not, comes in a glass milk jug accompanied by a mason jar that I'm supposed to pour it into and drink from.  Are you kidding me?  What kind of a \"beer market\" doesn't serve its beer in a proper beer glass?!  I'm now laughing at this point, but it gets even better.  We all order our food (2 crab mac&cheese, 1 risotto and one chicken dinner) and just try to make the best of it.  Neither of us can finish the mac&cheese as it's really bland and not very good, the risotto was okay and the chicken was actually pretty good.  The waitress notices the unfinished meals and makes a comment in a tone like we aren't the first people to only finish half of it, but we decide to not worry about it and just finish up and go.  Now at this point, it's getting close to 9:00 and the music has started on the other side (top 40 dance music, not my cup of tea and definitely not the type of music they used to play, but c'est la vie).  People are starting to show up for the night club, which is fine, but I really wasn't expecting what happened next.  The bouncers come over and remove the partition so the restaurant has officially become part of the night club.  I'm not kidding, it's pretty much the Back Alley again only with music I don't care for and about 200 eleventeen year olds (mostly girls in tiny little black dresses and 4 inch heels which only a few know how to walk in).  Seriously...there is nothing about this place that should be referred to as a beer market.  It's a confused night club that wants to try and get some revenue during the day with false advertising, in my opinion.  It's expensive, the food was very average, they have lots of ordinary beer on tap an d they can't wait until they can close the kitchen and start slinging vodka slices to the kids.  Brutal."}
{"text":"Nice enough venue, but really, really shitty event planning. Started the Sloan show super early & then they kicked everyone out at 9:30 for some rapper. They're doing the same for the upcoming Brian Jonestown Massacre gig so some DJ can play afterwards. They even cancelled the local band opening for the show because of the early start. Double booking weekend shows is ridiculous. I'd advise bands to stay away from playing here. Marquee is going to put Calgary on the map as another city great bands will avoid because of this."}
{"text":"I don't know what this club is like inside, my only experience was one staff member at the front door. 
I was the designated driver at my friend's birthday party on Saturday. Hadn't had a drink. I was in the middle of the group entering the club. Stood around outside for a few minutes, then we got past the look-in-the-camera-guy without issue. I walked into the hallway for the pat-down guy. He doesn't give me any instructions, doesn't say a word to me, just starts groping. I put my arms up to the sides, and he kind of stuck his fingers into my front pants pockets, and (as in the airport) I volunteered 'I can empty my pockets for you.'
'GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE!' 
'Seriously?'
Then he shoves me backwards, curses some more, and shoves me again into another bouncer. 
I'm 30 years old, calm, decently dressed, sober. Pretty fun time."}
{"text":"Somebody tried to sell me Coke while I was taking a shit in one of the stalls- which don't have locks. Just want to take a shit in peace without ppl pushing in the doors. Too much to ask for?"}
{"text":"We decided to stop in for a beer after taking in a theatre performance on a whim. As soon as we sat down a waitress came at us with 'just so you know we're not serving food anymore'. It was 9:20 on a Wednesday night so I'm not sure what the deal was. It was pretty slow so maybe someone was trying to get home early? Anyway our second waitress let us know we were special and that they would serve us food if we wanted it. OK.
I ordered some lemon pepper wings and they were really good. Not just the dry lemon pepper seasoning but actual pepper with a squirt of lemon juice. We also had beer but we were a bit confused when we were told they came in 14 oz and 20 oz glasses. Our waitress said the 20 oz was 'like a pint'...yeah a British pint! So when we got our beer I got the standard glass of an American pint which of course is 16 oz. I know this because my husband had his in a half pint Ball jar which is 8 oz. Coincidentally it may look cool to serve beer in a jar but it is for sure the wrong shape for it. Keep the jars for your cocktails.
So the wings were good, the beer delicious (but short)...
What made me want to leave is watching the barkeep eat half a sandwich, pick his teeth with his finger then proceed to empty the clean dishwasher. Ew."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible service. Trying to ask a question, good luck because no one will help or they treat you so badly. Tried to show the bouncer we were on guest list and he told me to \"back the f**k up and go back under the line\" guest list means nothing. I suggest you don't treat your customers like trash since they are the ones keeping you in business and paying your bills."}
{"text":"Wow so disappointed. Came for dinner extra hungry with this being the first meal of the day  ready to do some damage.... Left not finishing my meal it was that bad. So sad

Wings were dry and skinny, possibly cooked earlier during the day?

Spaghetti and meatballs, drowned in tomato sauce, with meatballs tasting like rubber. 

I'm giving this 2 stars bc the beer selection is decent, and the beer was cold."}
{"text":"I've been here for a few shows which have been very good (Due to good artists, only reason for two stars). However, this place seems to be very poorly managed. I paid cash for a show ticket but needed to go to the ATM to get it. I left my ID with one of the staff but did not end up getting it back. I have tried sending multiple emails to the contact on their website but have yet to receive a response. If you call there is no option for a voicemail (they do not pick up the phone). I have tried visiting in person but the hours they have posted are clearly not correct as I have yet to see this place open again. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"I've been to Marquee for different events in the past, but this past time the bartender who served me (Holly), went above and beyond compared to previous times. I had asked for a double vodka soda in a tall glass with a lemon and a lime.. when she came back she gave me multiple fruits of both my asking (the more the better) then also gave me a longer straw to accommodate my taller cup. It seems silly but made my experience way better when normally the bartenders are not polite to female patrons. Thank you Holly and you will
 be part of the reason I come back."}
{"text":"I have attended numerous events at this location (Whether it's drinks, dinner, or club/concert show, it's been 7+ times) and I am reminded every time why I don't go. This Friday was a test, to see if Marquee has changed and got better since last summer, and I won't be going again. Just saw TI last Friday with a bunch of friends, and the worst part of this venue is the staff. The front door staff, security AND coat check, are just horribly rude. Not friendly, no smiles, no \"hi\" or a \"hi\" back when greeted, kept interrupting and taking people in front of us. Nothing. Ignorant and arrogant. We had VIP passes and the girls at the coat check were so rude, fought with us to pay the $3 a jacket fee even though we had free coat check passes, and told us we had to go back out of the building and walk around to the other entrance (dinner side?) to see if we could get free coat check. Straight bitchy for no reason. If you're having a bad day, stay in bed. It took 15 minutes to get our jackets hung. Every time I have been here the staff is just horrible. The security management at Marquee Beer Market has a violence issue as well. I will not be returning as I will not be putting money into Marquee to keep them going, regardless of the shows they get lucky enough to catch. Disappointing."}
{"text":"Bring back the Back Alley.  At least that place recognized itself as a dive bar and acted accordingly.  

Marquee thinks it's better than the hot garbage it actually is"}
{"text":"A long day at work deserves a good brew, with this in mind and having Marquee on the drive home we decided to stop in for a few nibbles and sips.

We sat in the bar side and I have to say the d√©cor looked and felt cheap. I know it was going for a gastro pub feel but it doesn't seem that way to me. The music blaring in the background was not my scene for that evening especially considering all the rock legends portraits they have on the walls I wasn't expecting to hear \"thong song\" and the like.

The beer menu is pretty good and there is a extended happy hour, but it made me wonder...why? Is it good for business or are they hurting for it? We got waited on right away, but it was the I haven't sat down and taking off my jacket while being questioned what drink would I like... thanks for being attentive but I haven't even looked at the menu.

We ordered a few shareables.. The mussels, bruschetta and a salad. Mussels were cold upon arrival and were in a weird greasy clear broth that tasted like nothing... the fries that came with were over seasoned. Bruschetta was ok and the salad was just meh. 

There was nothing that would bring me back, plus I didn't like the location much. Putting it on the list of  \"been there, done that.\""}
{"text":"Really not impressed with Marquee Beer Market which sucks because its on my way home from work and I was excited for the concept. Stopped in the first week they opened, first the waitress tried to seat us in the way back which is as dark as a dungeon, we asked to sit near the window because the place was dead and no one was sitting there. She had to 'check' with the head Hostess which took a few minutes and finally she sat us. 

Drinks were delivered quickly but everytime she brought us a new one she asked if we wanted to eat, each time we told her we were only there for drinks, fairly pushy.

Finally at the end we get the cheque, and the drinks are full priced. We were there from 5:00PM - 6:00PM and were confused because their sign read they had Happy Hour from 4-8 and their menu had special Happy Hour prices. We bring this up with her and she runs to ask a Manager (it should be noted that she had to keep running back and forth to a 'Manager' who was no-where to be seen, he/she never came out to talk with us). The waitress told us the Happy Hour promotion doesn't start until their second week (which is insane, btw. I'm in the Food & Beverage industry and opening week is the BEST time to have your best deals). So the resolution was basically, \"fuck you guys\". Well we didn't like that and reiterated that the sign states their Happy Hour is on now. She goes back to the Manager and comes back offering us a 15% discount which is 10% less than the intended Happy Hour discount. We didn't feel like playing this game anymore and so settled up with the 15% discount. Bad customer service, no manager and completely disorganized. 

I'll find somewhere else to spend my money after work."}
{"text":"Marquee is the greatest and Jeremiah is a god-send."}
{"text":"I've enjoyed some fun evenings at Marquee.  While my 24-year-old self mourns greatly for The Back Alley, Marquee is a complete overhaul from the former rock club.  It has been fully renovated, and now offers bottle service areas, seating in the restaurant, and a pub-style beer market.  They have a wide selection of beers and great service.  I have yet to try the food, but as a place to go for drinks and dancing, it's a good time."}
{"text":"I dunno. I've only been here once. It was for my stagette. So we felt waaaay older than everyone in there. We didn't have any food. Just booze. Pretty basic bar booze...shots and beer. The music was brutal. Shitty DJ, trance music. Def not my style. It had a big dance floor etc but I'd not be rushing back."}
{"text":"Tried to book a dinner reservation through their site for 8pm... Apparently the restaurant no longer \"opens early\"... It doesn't open until 9pm. Is it just me or is anyone else wondering how 8pm for dinner is considered early? I'm not looking for an early bird special... I'm only 26 but by 9pm, I'm probably hangry and not in the mood to be social anymore."}
{"text":"You can take the place out of the trash, not the trash out of the place. It's a craphole. I'd rather drink on the sidewalk than pay for overpriced food and drinks. I did. I sat on the curb off of the main road and 3 people joined for 3 bucks a beer. That's how bad this place is. Pretentious, overpriced and soon to be out of business. Marquee has substandard everything."}
{"text":"went to the Marquee  lastnight on the Halloween Howler and the girl in the cheeta costume serving at the bar was the most rudest girl i have ever met! we paid good money to be there and she was a cunt! totally destroyed the rest of our evening, all becuase she was talking with her friends and we asked for a drink!  Never again! Marquee should have standards on service, not just hiring pretty girls with no serving or people skills"}
{"text":"I came here with friends for the launch party for The Drop Saturdays (supposedly Calgary's biggest hip hop night). If you get on the guest list and arrive before 11pm cover is free; otherwise, it's $10. I love hip hop and I thought the music was great! Mostly popular mainstream stuff that you can really dance to. Everybody else there seemed to also just be there for the music, which is personally my favourite way to go clubbing. The venue was large and clean, service was quick at the bar, and the sound system seemed just the same as any other club (I think - I'm no audiophile). The only reason this place doesn't get 5/5 is because it's in such a weird location. The only way you can get to and from it is by cab, and I hate taking cabs. I had a great night here and if they're still doing hip hop every Saturday I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Ive never been here for the food. but after reading some of the reviews I don't think I will. 

We have come here for a few shows. 

1) the sound is absolutely horrible. They need to fire their sound guy and maybe do some acoustics work to the room. If you enjoy ear piercing highs then this is the place for you!! 

2) if you like being treated like cattle by some meat head juice junky than this is the place for you! the staff is incredibly rude. The bouncers are the absolute worst. and the \"servers\" flat out ignore mostly every one at the bar. 

3) the smoke pit is tiny. you literally can't get through all the people out there. honestly how hard would it be to extend this a little wider.... give me a break. 

4) the atmosphere is just an over all feeling of grossness. and there is pretty much no decoration. The lights are ok. but everything else is below meh."}
{"text":"I attended an *art* event at @MarqueeYYC and was quite displeased to find out that they had a \"mandatory\" coat check policy.  Their sign indicated that the rule came straight from the AGLC (Alberta Gaming and Liquor Commission).  When I probed, the coat check attendee was apologetic and said, \"I have no control over it.\" .... that is total BS because A) There is no AGLC by-law which states a coat check is mandatory.  If it were, then all places that serve alcohol would be doing this and they aren't; the AGLC did have a roundtable on violence where a participant endorsed mandatory coat checks, but someone saying something at a roundtable discussion does not make it a LAW!  B) Once inside I counted about 5-6 people with their coats on.

This establishment clearly discriminates upon appearance, age and possibly race.  They mask their policies under the AGLC umbrella so people are less likely to complain.  The coat check is nothing more than a cash grab at $2 a coat.

Once inside the band that was playing during an ART event had really bad sounding levels which tells me either their sound system is crap or they have really bad sound people working there.

Clearly the management at Marquee Beer Market has a violence issue and they use deception of the laws to try and combat it.  It's a matter of distrust in the management which will never make me return."}
