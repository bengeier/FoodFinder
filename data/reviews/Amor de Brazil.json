{"text":"Save your money and choose Chima for a slightly higher price and a better experience. I had dinner at this place just last night. The trays at the salad bar were almost always empty and nobody was bringing more food. The meat wasn't that great, some cut was chewy and some other too dry. Definitively not worth it."}
{"text":"Went for dinner yesterday (Easter) and had a great experience. I had garlic steak which was delicious. Jason the server was great at keeping our drinks filled, Nick the bus boy was also great- he made the fried bananas which were extremely delicious! Then Brandon the other server was also extremely nice. I had a great personal experience and I was glad I got to know the boys here. Defiantly will be back!"}
{"text":"Great destination dining with first class friendly service. Salad bar is far more than your average vegetarian salad, it can become a full meal all on its own with all of the extras to choose from. Did I mention the rotisserie, to die for, it will keep on coming until you scream \"no mas\" . If you're looking for an elegant dining experience with a special someone, you owe to yourself to try Armor de Brazil"}
{"text":"They just opened and I gotta say the steak is great and the salad bar is amazing. I heard they'll have  performances at night soon so it might be a great spot to for dinner on weekends now. Now I don't have to drive to downtown Charlotte to have a rodizio experience."}
{"text":"Great Food. Great Service ,  It's 30 dollars a person very good deal . Just make sure you are really hungry  and ready  to eat because they never stop  bring different meats to your table to try. I must have had  6 different meats .   I will be back with my baseball team so we can get our after game Win meal !!!"}
{"text":"Lousy service.  We had a reservation on Open Table for 6:15 and when we hot there at 6, they said it would be 45 until we'd be seated.  It was like a Seinfeld episode.  No one there to talk to, and service was lousy. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Delicious! A great variety of buffet items, and the meats brought out were excellent! Expect a gratuity to be added to your tip, I feel it was fair because so many different people were milling around helping everyone in the restaurant."}
{"text":"My visit was driven by the fact that I had a coupon and I had heard this place mentioned on Charlotte Talks.  By coincidence, we ended up going to Chima during January restaurant week.  We really enjoyed our experience at Amor.  The meats were delicious, and the salad bar was well done with a nice variety.  The service was outstanding, and they made my 4 & 6 year olds feel very welcome.  I would not take my kids to Chima, but this is a family-friendly restaurant.  If you have adolescents who are big eaters, you will get your money's worth!  In comparison to Chima, the selection was very similar, with perhaps a smaller salad bar.  Food quality was comparable.  A more intimate atmosphere with lower prices.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"excellent food. amazing service.  The new owners have really made this a great destination.   We eat Paleo & love how this fits in our dietary restrictions."}
{"text":"I love this place. Come hungry. For $30 you get the full rodizio. That is the salad bar, all the meats, and the bread and fried plantains. The salad bar is huge. There salad bar consist of already made salads, make your own salad, shrimp, fish, and a vast array of cheeses and sliced meat. I tried not to eat much off the salad bar because I was here for the meat. Once you flip your card to green, Its go time. The parade of meats begins. Each person comes around with something different and ask if you would like some. I had too flip my card to red so I could catch up. My favorite was the house steak and the lamb. I didnt like the garlic steak, which was very overpowering. The service is outstanding. The owner even walks around to make sure that you are doing fine. We arrived at 6 on a Saturday night. We were seated right away. They do take reservations though. I will be back here again. I love a place where they seem to care if you are enjoying yourself."}
{"text":"We made 7:00 reservations for the day after Valentine's Day, so I went in to Amor de Brazil expecting a short wait, especially with a party of 5.  This was our first visit, and it was highly anticipated. We had been to Rioz in Myrtle Beach and really enjoyed the experience.  When we checked in, there were 2 couples ahead of us.  We were told that our table would be available shortly.  The hostess kept leaving the host stand to check on different tables, wipes down and replace linens and silverware, etc.  While she was gone, the small foyer/waiting area filled up with people. After about 30 minutes, we were told that we could wait in the bar for our table, that people were taking longer than expected to finish their meals.  We went into the bar area - which was empty - sat at the bar, and were ignored by the bartender for about 10 minutes before she even acknowledged we were there.  When I asked for a wine list, she gestured to the restaurant seating area and said they were \"all out there\" and handed me a cocktail list. Seeing that all of the cocktails and martinis were $8.75 and up, I chose to wait to have a glass of wine with my meal. An hour and 15 minutes after our reservation, another member of our party went to the hostess stand and asked if any of the empty tables were for us. We were told by the hostess that our drinks at the bar would be comped for our wait, and when I mentioned that I never saw a wine list, she said that she would comp all of the first round of drinks at our table.    We waited about 20 minutes for a waiter to come by and bring us water, get our drink order, drop off the \"meat indicator\" for the meat servers to stop at our table. No one ever stopped, and we tried to flag down the hostess 3 times and were promptly ignored.  Finally a waiter walked by and one of our friends got his attention and told him we had not gotten any service. He apologized, said he would take care of us, and brought out water for everyone, and I told him that the hostess had agreed to comp our drinks.  He looked at me like I was crazy, so I told him about the wait we had experiences.  He shrugged and didn't respond.  We went and got our salad bar items, which were delicious and plentiful. The variety was great - mussels, shrimp and salmon on the bar, as well as a variety of salads, cheeses, and sliced deli meats. The cooked meat was delicious - the tri-tip steak and lamb were both cooked perfectly.  I tried several other portions and enjoyed it all.    The waiter never came back by our table to refill our water glasses or ask if we wanted another drink from the bar.  He was very attentive to the table next to ours - spending 4 or 5 minutes chatting with them, making sure everyone had drinks and everything they needed.  Almost 3 hours after our reservation time, we flagged down another server and asked to see the manager.  Turns out that our \"waiter\" was actually the manager!  When we told him how disappointed we were with the service, he asked if he could bring us a dessert or another drink from the bar, which we declined, and asked for our bills.  He apologized again and brought us our bills.  Our drinks were comped, as the hostess promised.  We will probably never go back to Amor de Brazil.  The food was good, but the service was awful."}
{"text":"I have visited this restaurant on two occasions. The first was with a party of 8 for my birthday. After visiting a different Brazilian restaurant in Charlotte with terrible service i was really hoping this would be better. Boy what a night and day difference. This place has amazing service! The owner stopped by our table to thank us and check on us. Our server was extremely attentive, the food was delicious and kept coming all night. They made my birthday a very special occasion.   I visited again last week and it was just as good if not better than the first time!! Keep up the good work :)!!"}
{"text":"I have been here several times with little to no issues. The food is great and the service is near immediate. Dinner allows unlimited cuts of different high end meats and an endless salad bar. Lunch offers a salad bar and a few different meats. I recommend you eat here at least once. Dinner is a little pricey, but make sure you go there hungry to get your money's worth!"}
{"text":"The overall experience was just odd. There is no one there to greet you when you walk in and no directions whether to sit or not. The signs out front advertise pizza but the main sign says Brazilian. The food has potential minus the undressed salad, but the menu does not have descriptions, the wait staff was not able to answer my questions and the service was terrible.   I went into the restaurant in a whim for lunch but was a little confused because the new sign said pizza and the old sign said Brazilian food. Upon entering, I waited for about three minutes before anyone noticed me. It's very clear that they have no idea how to run a restaurant. When the waitress finally noticed me she was very friendly and showed me the menu. None of the foods had descriptions and it being my first time in a Brazilian restaurant, I had a lot of questions. I asked what the Brazilian sausage was and she said \" I will get one.\"  I initially thought that was very nice of her to let me sample one. She brings it out for me to look at, not taste, and then takes it back to the kitchen still not being able to tell me exactly what's in a Brazilian sausage. I at this point, a little confused decide to order the sausage combo to try it. She then says sit anywhere you like. This whole exchange was done at the bar because no one seated me. I ordered a sausage plate that came with rice and beans, plus two sides.  I chose fries and a salad. It wasn't until five minutes after sitting that someone asked if I wanted something to drink. Keep in mind there is only one other full table at the time and they look less than pleased with the service. I asked for a water and the waitress goes to the bar where a glass of water with a straw had been sitting since I entered and gives that to me.  I had no idea if that was someone's water or not.  The food comes out quickly and the sausage was delicious but the other sides were nothing special. My salad had no dressing, the beans were from a can, and the fries were pretty standard. No one asked if everything was ok until I was done  and it wasn't until I was almost done that someone asked if I wanted more water. The wait times for water and the check were a little ridiculous. If they were busy I would be more understanding. After paying my check I tried to leave but the door was locked in the middle of the day. Someone had to let me out. Overall I was just a really strange experience."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch.  Almost all of the vegetables  tasted like it was tainted by some sort of soap and I immediately spit my food out.  We could smell the soap on the broccoli.  The manager just said that the broccoli was supposed to smell like that and walked away.  Needless to say, I won't be coming back here again."}
{"text":"We ate there on a Sunday evening. Their online reservation system worked well.  We were seated immediately.  The salad bar was very good.  Would like to see a couple more hot items since this is all you get other than meat, but the variety was impressive.  The meat was fantastic.  I think I counted 15 different kinds.  The lamb was cooked perfect as were most of the other cuts.  We never ran out of meat on our plate.   Service was very good, but we were not asked to buy another drink, so they missed out on that sale.  The Brazilian Flan was very good.  Overall a very good experience and will be going back."}
{"text":"There's been quite a stir of Brazilian steakhouses as of late. My mom in particular, has been spent quite an insane amount of money here, taking me, all her friends, and more recently, my monster meat-eating brother, visiting from NYC.   I actually wondered if, upon bringing my brother here, a buffet would finally cut us off. His metabolism and appetite makes me want to enroll him in one of those Japanese eating contests, kid you not.   So first off, what did we order. Well, you have two options really:  *Pay $25 for the salad bar,  *or $30 for the salad bar and unlimited meat   The first time I came here, the salad bar reminded me of the typical kinds of tapas items I used in catering to large parties/events. High quality cheeses (fantastic Manchego), chickpea salads, asparagus, the whole basil mozz thing, high quality pasta salads, and tropical fruits (mangos), smoked salmon, mussels-- reminded me quite like Scandinavia \"kaldbord\" --cold boards. There's a relatively high profit margin in buying these things, and ppl always leave happy. Considered \"luxury\" to Nordic farmers, or Southerners.   But as someone who opted for only the salad bar, I have to say, $25 is a bit overpriced. The wine list, however, is FANTASTIC. I had an Italian pinot, and normally woulda been quite satisfied with good cheese, wine, and mussels... but the mussels...   The seafood available is OK (after living in Scandinavia, it's hard to impress:), but the mussels at the buffet were terribly overcooked. So I asked them to make a fresh batch, since it was the only hot \"meat\" part of the salad bar. The result was a somewhat discoloured, un-fresh grey version of the previous batch of mussels. Cie la vie. One nice thing they do however, is also bring out hot little \"Brazilian\" dishes, like baked cheese bread balls (fabulous) and fried polenta (also fabulous).   As for the meat. There's a good variety -- from sirloin steak, garlic steak, chicken sausages, lamb, spicy chicken, mainly. MOST of the meat was cooked very well, but there was an occasional bout of meat that was overcooked to death, or undercooked and bleedin' thru the ears. On the other hand, it must have been hard to constantly keep up with the ferocious appetite of my brother...   Let me make an injunction here, and say the service is truly impeccable. The owner, in his sporty jumpsuit, literally comes out with a doner in hand to ensure you are getting every bit of meat you want. When my brother asked for more sirloin, it was like the apocalypse had broken out-- the owner, the head chef, the waiters, went into a mad rush. Our server Antonio came over multiple times making we EVERYTHING was good. But not in an annoying American sort of way, a genuine, relaxed and helpful sort of way.   My mother leaves here with smiles, understandably. The quality of the buffet is good. I'm a bit jaded, thinking again that they're making donkeyloads of money. Purely based on the overpriced salad bar (to me, rice, beans, some nice pasta salad doesnt warrant $25), so I wouldn't come back here -- I also have a slight ethical problem with encouraging unlimited, mass consumption of meat (maybe why it appeals to Americans) -- as for my family members, I'm sure they'll become regulars.   Rankings  *# of times dined here: 3rd   *Cost of Bill: $30-35 for 1person   *Food Rating: 8/10  *Service Rating: 11/10"}
{"text":"We went at lunch time on a Saturday and while I expected a limited menu I did NOT expect a limited buffet. If you offer a lunch menu it should ALL be available. We paid for the lunch buffet but nothing was on the seafood side only empty ice. Also, the meats were VERY limited; chicken wings, over cooked beef and processed turkey breast.  This was my first and possibly last visit as I also felt that it was not really explained that we would not experience the same menu and service that is offered after 5pm."}
{"text":"Perhaps, I got lucky, but I just don't think so.  We were seated immediately. Our wait staff was excellent. The \"meat guys\" made their way around the room often, and I even asked for a few items again.   My husband took me for my birthday, and after reading some of these reviews, I was kind of concerned (Matthews is an hour drive). The \"salad bar\" was a beautiful place that I really could have made the drive for alone. There were a couple of meats that I didn't care for: Chorizo and flank steak, but the filet mignon wrapped in bacon and the chicken wings were SPOT ON!   Our drink glasses never went empty. We were brought fried plantains and roasted pineapple, which certainly made this experience quite complete. It was my first time at a churrascaria, and it won't be my last! I can't wait to return.   PS... We had a Groupon too, and there was no issue at all."}
{"text":"We had a reservation on a Saturday night.  We were seated right away.  Waiters were watching for us to turn over our cards.  They came immediately with skewers of all kinds of meats. Some in our party wanted rare, others more towards well done. All were accomodated well.  Salad bar and sides had a good variety and were well prepared.  Meats were perfectly seasoned and perfectly cooked.  Service was excellent."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to eat at Amor De Brazil for our 9th anniversary dinner without the kids. The food was great, the staff was fabulous and attentive and the atmosphere was comfortable. We will definitely eat here again. We made a reservation and I'm glad we did as it gets pretty busy in there."}
{"text":"The food was ok. I dont like rare meat. If you like that then you may enjoy this restaurant. Salad bar was good.  Service was very slow... Not to mention when we had a server spill 5 drinks on our table. We had a large party which may have contributed to the slow service. Not a place i will eat at again. It was fine for me once."}
{"text":"I ate lunch here a while back. The food was amazinggggggg. The meat falls off the bone and the sides are tasty. There are plenty of options so it's a good place to go for anyone. Even a young child could find something they want"}
{"text":"Brazilian Steakhouses are some of my favorite places to eat.  What is not to like about all you can eat meat.   Well, there were a few things I was unhappy about while going to Amor de Brazil.   The service was very nice and pleasant.   They continued to fill my water up and brought more fresh banana's when mine were getting a little cold.  The restaurant was clean and nice.  Of the many different Brazilian steakhouses I have been to though, I was really disappointed in the meat selection and more importantly, the speed at which they brought out the meats.   There were sometimes a good 5-10 minutes in between meat runs.   There were not many people in the restaurant, but 5-10 minutes between new meats was not okay.    The flavor of the meats were very bland, I found myself adding lots of salt to all of them.  The meat was also fairly tough, especially the smaller portions.   I kept asking for medium rare, but all they seemed to ever bring out was well to well-done.   Very frustrating!"}
{"text":"The service was attentive, warm, genuinely desirous of pleasing.  The salad bar is perhaps high priced, when salad is not combined with meat, but that is understandable for a steak and meat restaurant. The salad bar is diverse and very tasty, and with various fish and egg options, terrific chooses, and gives the half-veggie plenty of choices.  This is not a typical chain store salad and soup bar!  My wife had several meats and found them inconsistent..  She didn't try the poultry.    All in all, this is a pleasant place that we will probably return to, and a very nice start to an evening t the movies."}
{"text":"I will never return here.   As some others have stated their service is horrible. I guess in my situation I cannot even comment on the service because we NEVER got a server!   We arrived and there was already a crowd at the door.  No one ever said well it'll be this amount of time or sorry for the wait or would you like a drink from the bar. Just nothing! After waiting nearly 30 mins after our reservation time we were seated. Not before asking 3 different people for help. The second person we asked said \"well we close in 30 mins so I don't know what to tell you\" WOW! The other two said I'll get someone to help you.   We sat another 15 mins or so before assuming if we got up to get our salad it would be a sign for a server to bring our drinks and other necessities (tongs, signal for gauchos, instructions etc.) The couple with us had never been to this type of restaurant, good thing we were with them! They would have never eaten!  My husband managed to flag down the manager and he brought out our drinks. Eventually the gauchos made their way to us despite not having a signal thing. They actually we more help than anyone else. They brought us tongs and a signal thing and tried to get someone to help us. The crazy thing is we were surrounded by tables getting help from more than one server! None the less we ate the food with was pretty damn good. We asked for dessert, they brought us out something else bc they were all out.   At the end of the day, the manager took $5 off our meals and said that's all he could do.   I'll go to Chima from now on."}
{"text":"Went there last night on a Thursday.  Worst experience in a long time.   Where to start.  In an hour and a half saw one employee visit the salad bar.   Salmon was dry, as it sat there an hour and a half on my watchm.  Muscles were tough.   Worst chicken salad ever.   Tbf as only 5 employees were working, I wouldn't doubt if everything was canned.     The meats were all tough and overcooked.  The cook who was doubling as a server (not sure how sanitary that is) spoke poor English.    And obviously as he is serving no one is watching the food.   The last piece of meat tasted rotten.  Honestly, I almost puked.   Had to wash it out with bananas.....which were good.   That was about it.   Too bad for $35 they served it in a paper dish?   Really?   And on that, sauces?   No sauce dishes so I had to put any sauces on my plate so it ran.  Picky I know.     There beer selection was bla.   Lots of domestics like budwiser or Mexicans.   No craft beers that most places serve now.     Servers and hostess were friendly and accommodating.   For that reason only I give 2 stars ."}
{"text":"Went during restaurant week in July. Great food. Great atmosphere. Comfortable but nice.  Pleasant staff.  Whenever we requested specific meats, they ensured they quickly came. Cheese bread.. to die for. My boyfriend and I were quite happy with everything."}
{"text":"A very nice experience. A good special occasion restaurant.   It's kind of pricey so come hungry!  The staff was very polite and accommodating. Food was plentiful and delicious."}
{"text":"We treated my husband and Father to dinner for Fathers day. We had reservations and were quickly seated. Our server was fine he wasn't around much though which became somewhat annoying when people at the table needed dirty plates taken away.   We ordered a pitcher of Red Sangria. It was overly sweet and tasted as if powdered sugar was added.   Their salad bar was rather impressive with a large variety of items. Everything I tried was very fresh. The cheeses and cured meats were delish and the hot items like the mussels or the beans and rice were equally as good.  The meats that were brought to the table were very good. In the future I will forgo the sausage. It was nothing special. It tasted like a store bought meat and was very greasy. The lamb was beyond Divine. I did however have to ask for it to be passed around again. If you like a specific cut of meat, be sure to ask, they will always bring it out again. The majority of meats were Beef. Beef wrapped in bacon, beef tips, Top sirloin, etc. All were very tasty. I would highly recommend you tell the server how you like your meats prepared because they ASSUMED I liked my cut of meat well done and every time they sliced it, it would be from a part that was cooked well done. Oh no no no no no!!! I told the server the rarer the better and he asked if I was joking. No I'm not joking. I would like for it to still be mooing if at all possible. They also offered pork which was cooked perfectly and chicken which was a tad bit dry.   For dessert we had the Flan which I heard was very good. I did not try it. I'm just not a fan of Flan. I had the Lava Cake with ice cream. It was OK nothing great. Truth be told I would take more of the lamb over dessert any day.  All in all it was a good experience and we will go back again."}
{"text":"This place is great, love it so far , the meat is juicy and tender , the service is great, cute servers and very nice!   Idk, but my server is a candy for the eye .....  I will coming back ^^"}
{"text":"Go to Chima, go to Brazz, but only go here if both of those places are booked and you just really want a brazilian style feast. The atmosphere is crowded, loud, and cramped. I unfortunately took my sister here for her birthday. It was ok. But the service was not good and none of us could here anything the others were saying. For the poor atmosphere, service, etc, the prices should be way lower. If I'm paying a significant amount, I at least want to feel like it was worth it."}
{"text":"I truly did not enjoy the food (some meats were just okay, salad bar was AWFUL) I will never return.  On the plus side, waiters we're friendly but they try to get over and leave themselves extra tips. The only reason I gave this place 2 stars is because the live music was lovely. Brazz is a much better restaurant, I'll stick to what I know!!!"}
{"text":"Came here on a hopping SAT night. They really know how to take care of you here with a personal touch. Not stuffy or corporate, like the uptown joints.  I'd recommend coming on a weekday. Why? When it's busy, you may only get your fave cut of meat 1-2x over a 2hr dinner. Of course, they will ALWAYS bring your cut to the table if you ask.  Red wine bottles start at $24, and glasses $7/each. I agree that for veggie eaters, the $25tab is overpriced. All in all, Hope this place does well (and does not raise its prices).   Will be back very soon with out-of-town guests."}
{"text":"I have been to this new Brazilian restaurant twice now. I was pleasantly surprised by the excellent food and sophisticated ambiance.  It was an unusual combination: luxury restaurant at affordable prices. $30 for all-you-can-eat, a good value for quality and all-you-can-eat food, covers gourmet buffet and freshly roasted meats.  The buffet, having both meats and vegetables, had great quality and variety of cold and hot items.  The meats are served \"rodizio\" style: waiters bring speciality meats to your table for you to choose from.  The excellent music was non-intrusive, at ideal volume to allow normal conversation.  Occasionally, at the bar, there is great authentic live music. Parking is free and plentiful. Staff was exceptionally friendly and food was delicious.  Overall, I highly recommend this establishment."}
{"text":"The lunch was worst I have had in Charlotte. 2 dried up meats in a steamer getting drier. Salad bar... Not worth leaving your TV dinner."}
{"text":"The restaurant is beautiful and authentic. My husband is Brazilian and I have traveled to Brazil numerous times. The food here was amazing! Our new favorite restaurant in Charlotte! Highly recommended! The environment is casual chic, the food was fantastic, service was helpful and friendly. The salad bar had a lot of options, which reminded us of Brazil. The price was very affordable and not overpriced at all, for the quality of what you receive. Go eat here! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I have been here twice now and have had two very different experiences. One was close to 5 star, the other was wavering on 3.   My last visit was on a Sunday, I am generally a light eater and did not want the full rodizio, but my husband and son did select the full menu. The waiter pointed out that on the Sunday special it was only 7$ more to get the full rodizio. I felt a little pressured and as though I was being cheap by not taking him up on it. But sure enough, when the salad bar choices had been consumed, I was full. So I asked him to adjust it back down and that I'd be skipping the full meal. I again felt I was being pressured to get the meats. I declined but it was bothersome to have to insist on what I really wanted.   Both my husband and son had asked for two certain meats to come out and it was nearly the end of the meal before they came to our table, though those meats had been at the nearby tables and each time told they'd be right back when we tried to flag the servers down. It felt a bit like we were being punished by not all having the full rodizio.   The fried bananas are very good, the salad bar plentiful and delicious shrimp available which was the perfect protein for me. Both my husband and son commented on how tender and tasty the meat dishes were.   The three of us split a dessert, which was S'mores lava cake...except the interior 'lava' was cold and not one bit warm. It would not be a choice I'd make again.   Parking is very easy and it appears they have outdoor seating, though it was cordoned off with yellow caution tape when we visited. The live music was far too loud and we were thankful when the performer took a break so that we could hear one another speak.   Everything we saw-tables, salad bar area and the mens and ladies restrooms were all very clean.   It is good, but not great and would be a place I would return to only if those I were dining with selected the restaurant."}
{"text":"Great service!  It was noticed that I liked my meat a little more med rare vs. well done & it was brought right out.  Good salad bar but a little disappointed because the offerings that particular day did not match the website.  Overall a good experience."}
{"text":"I give it a 4 star review because of the quality of food we got. The service was AMAZING though. From the moment we walked in, the staff was welcoming and very friendly. We both had to full rodizo menu and salad bar. Sides at the salad bar are just okay. For $70 I would've expected it to be better. The meats were so good though! Also, at the end they asked if there was anything we'd like to have again. I thought that was a nice touch. A great night!"}
{"text":"Excellent. We went on a weeknight & it was SLOW. But service was fantastic. And food was plenty, excellent selection & very good. We did the full rodizio. There were a couple meats that were just ok, but always hot & tasted fresh. But overall great selection of meat & extras on the salad bar!!   Owner came to out table to ask about our experience & be sure we were satisfied. He thanked us for coming & invited us back.    It looked very elegant. And it was certainly clean.    Would & have highly recommended  them to anyone. Can't wait till we can go again!!"}
{"text":"Will stick with Chima!!!  Service sucked!!!  Waited 30 minutes for check!!!!!!  They were more focused on large groups then on small ones. Could have gotten up to leave without paying & no one would have noticed.  Won't be back!!!  No one knew what the heck was going on.  Couldn't handle the crowd either."}
{"text":"VERY arrogant staff that works here. We got pushed in the corner and didn't have a server come serve us for over 30 minutes. The food was cold and the 5 different meats, which they say they serve more, all taste the same. The chicken and steak all taste the same and don't have much flavor and are dry. When we finally complained about our experience with the neglect in service, the owner didn't have much to say and didn't have a remedy to fix the situation other than saying, \"I understand and you don't have to leave a tip if you don't want to!\"....what?! Since when is that a solution to YOUR bad service and food that is cold with no flavor? I'm pretty sure I always had the choice whether to leave a tip or not, that's not a fix for how we were treated or lack there of. Needless to say, I felt robbed and was disgusted to pay almost $100 for 2 adult dinners at this very under scale restaurant. I recommend to never try this place!"}
{"text":"Wonderful quality meat and salad bar items. Friendly staff, moderately priced. Amor de Brazil delivers wonderfully on the best rodizio."}
{"text":"We went about a month ago. This place was average at best.  My husband specifically wanted the lamb chops (that is his favorite at Fogo) and it took over 30 minutes for them to bring them out (we asked for them a few times). I was expecting more from the salad bar. Plus side, they are less expensive than Fogo (however Charlotte does not have one)."}
{"text":"So glad I decided to give this place another try! Living in Charlotte the only options are Chima and here, and since Amor de Brazil's full rodizio dinner is about $40 cheaper for two people, it wins. Went on a Friday night at 6, it was crowded but the wait was only about 5 minutes. Service was impeccable, very attentive. The cheesy bread rolls were hot and fresh -- major plus especially in comparison to Chima. The salad bar/hot bar area was not as fancy as Chima but still a great variety. The meats were very tender and flavorful. Only downside I would say is some of the meats, if they come out not cooked the way you like (medium rare, etc) you pretty much have to take it however it is. I didn't like that the filet came out well done when I preferred medium. Other than that, everything was excellent. My server asked and I told him I was waiting on lamb chops, as soon as they were done they were brought right out to me, as many as I wanted. This is the lowest priced rodizio I've ever visited so that's a major plus!  Tip: Thursday is Ladies' Night -- half off the full Rodizio price! Sundays the price goes from 33.99 to 24.99!  Update: went back on a Sunday night...service was not that great. Guess it depends on who the server is. It also took a good 20 minutes (after we had to ask) to get some cheesy rolls and they never served the plantain side dish to any table at all. This place needs more consistency but that won't stop me from coming back consistently!"}
{"text":"This place sucks. Don't go here. And don't fall for the Groupon. I have been taught for the last time that if a restaurant has a Groupon deal, there is a reason. We literally had no server for our entire time. I had to go to the bar for drinks, had to get my own silverware and napkins, etc. The gauchos brought a total of three meat cuts out, and so infrequently that you were lucky to get a sliver from every third or fourth guy to come by. No picanha sirloin, no filet, no ribeye. Just sausages, overdone top sirloin and some weird fatty cut.   Just don't go here, trust me."}
{"text":"First Visit: We came on a Friday at 615. It was busy but we didn't need a reservation for two. I would recommend one for more than that but it seemed to slow down by 8pm. Salad bar is phenomenal!  They allow you the option of salad only or salad and meat. Do both and leave room for dessert!! It is worth it! They will sing happy birthday to you in portuguese!! The service was over the top.   Second visit: I went during Queens Feast, busier of course and service was not a 5 star but it was a 4 star :) food still amazing, this time I had the salmon at the salad bar and I can't say enough how WONDERFUL IT WAS! Wow, the food is just so well prepared, and the deal for the week of $30 for Salad/Meat, Choice Dessert of Flan or Passionfruit Mousse was truly a great deal and well worth it for dinner."}
{"text":"Our family ate here tonight although we were very hesitant based on the reviews we read.  We eat out often all over the country, and expect good food and service. We were greeted immediately and sat quickly.  The food was very good and the service amazing.  The servers passing the meats joked with our kids and made sure they had fun. We will be back and definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Barely 3 stars, I doubt I'd give them even 2 back in Miami This review is about their lunch, which I did twice for the salad bar - full disclosure I'm no fan of any \"all you can eat\" Rodizios, I'd much rather order and pay for what exactly I want.    $12 buys you the Brazilian salad buffet and three pieces of Rodizio meat.  The buffet was a somewhat limited selection and of the usual offerings, passable but  nothing tasted too great and the Fejoada was almost non-existent both times.  The rodizio was a boring piece of chicken (overcooked both times), a tiny chorizo that I didn't care for (and I LOVE the Argentine style chorizo) and a small cut of wanna be picana . Once it was so tough as to be uneatable, the second time it was ok but I don't buy that it was top sirloin as depicted.  Most likely cheap sirloin tips, but I didn't care because I came for the salad bar, which I wish was better.  All together not a bad lunch value if that's you're in the mood for, but I can't imagine paying dinner prices."}
{"text":"Amor de Brazil is your typical Brazilian steakhouse offering a decadent salad bar and a rodizio consisting of various steak, chicken, pork, and sausage. Compared to other Brazilian steakhouses, Amor de Brazil ranks at the top in my opinion.  SERVICE I will start here since this seems to be a complaint among other Yelpers. I went with my family around 7 PM on a Friday. I was very nervous as the place was almost empty...never a good sign for a Brazilian steakhouse. I was definitely wrong to be worried, though.  It's clear that the owners of Amor de Brazil read Yelp because the service that evening was top notch. The restaurant had plenty of staff, which resulted in my glass always being full, meat routinely brought to my table, etc. I requested several types of meat, and they were brought to my table almost immediately. I am a stickler for service, and Amor de Brazil passed my sniff test.   FOOD The salad bar has your standard offerings, but what really stood out to me was the quality of some of the food. Salmon, several types of deli cuts, and various vegetables were all tasty and clearly freshly prepared.  The rodizio meats offered were all standard for a Brazilian steakhouse. They did have a grilled pineapple topped with cinnamon that stood out to me, so kudos for offering something unique.   PRICE I went during Queen's Feast (Charlotte's restaurant week) in January 2017, so the pricing was a bit lower than it usually is. The regular prices are in line with what other Brazilian steakhouses charge. Not much more to say here.   Given Amor de Brazil's service and quality of food, it definitely warrants a repeat visit and gives Charlotte's other Brazilian steakhouse (Chima) a run for its money. I would recommend Amor de Brazil and will visit again."}
{"text":"The fella and I ventured to Matthews on a Saturday and made reservations here for 7:00.  The place is easy to find and parking is easy in the shopping center.  Upon entering, we were greeted pleasantly by the hostess, and that same friendly service continued throughout the night.  Our waiter, Antonio, was fantastic and friendly and helpful.  We had thought about having a pre-dinner drink at the bar but were glad we decided against it since there really is no bar!  So, we ordered a bottle of wine... they were out of it.  So, we ordered another bottle of wine... they were out of it, too.  Ahem.  The fella gave them two more options, and thankfully they managed to have them in stock.  Onto the food!  The salad bar is pretty fantastic and had a variety of food including rice, black beans, potatoes, an assortment of divine cheeses, mussels, shrimp cocktail, quail eggs, mozzarella and tomato salad, etc.  And, of course, the meat was a-plenty!  We tried filet, pork, flank steak, bacon wrapped chicken, and even grilled pineapple when it came around.    So, why only three stars?  While the meat was plentiful, most of our pieces were so incredibly chewy.  I realize they have to cook the meat pretty well to appeal to most of their customers, and the fella and I are pretty much rare/medium rare meat eaters, but some of it was not only hard to chew, but also hard for the waiters to slice off their skewers.  At one point, we got pork and chicken and couldn't tell the difference.  Boo.  All in all, it's a smorgasbord of just okay food, and I was grateful that it was less expensive and snooty than Chima."}
{"text":"Great food. Service wasn't as expected. Also the real expensive meats, such as Filet mignon, only come around about once an hour."}
{"text":"Only have been to this place one time, and it was during the restaurant week but I really enjoyed our meal.  I'm usually cautious about going anywhere during restaurant week as typically the product is not quite as good as their normal product as the servers care a little less since they are catering to a class that usually would not be dining in the higher end places, and automatically assume tips will be down  (I.e. I will never go back to Mortons again).   Anyways that was not an issue servers were flying around keeping drinks full and my plate piled high with super tender juicy meat.  I mean honestly a place that serves unlimited steak? Sign me up!  Everything was really good, choices on the Salad bar were ridiculous... the salad bar had salmon! And it was sooo good! Really good place can't believe its been so long since I have made a return trip, this is now a priority!"}
{"text":"We attended a rehearsal dinner hosted here. The service was amazing and the food was great. The waiter kept our drinks full and we were constantly getting meat offered. The flank steak was to die for and there was great variety. Will definitely return and would recommend for large groups."}
{"text":"A few friends and I visited this place a few weeks ago.  We reserved a table for 6 for 8pm.  We weren't seated until 9pm.  On top of that, the hostess had an attitude when I asked her why it was taking so long.  If they couldnt accommodate us at 8pm then they should've just said so.  Then while we were eating, it took the waiter a while to get our drink orders and food orders.  Although I got the Rodizio, I was a bit disappointed in the amount of time it took them to bring the meats to our table.  All in all, the food and service was not that great. And my friend was saying how their Capirinhas were not good either.  Those are the most popular Brazilian drinks, and yet somehow they were not tasteful.  We even complained to the owner and instead of giving us free desserts or apologizing, he changed the subject and talked about how his \"online reviews\" were excellent.  Seriously?  Needless to say, later that evening me and one of my friends got extremely sick and threw up.  It's a shame because when we first visited back when they opened the food was great, excellent service and overall great experience.  It's too bad that their quality and service has gone downhill.  Never going there again."}
{"text":"Expectations were too high! Worst Brazilian steakhouse ever! Steak didn't have much flavor and all seemed to be cooked well. Horrible and overpriced! Read the reviews and don't waste your money! Wish I could get a refund!"}
{"text":"Omg. Amazing! Literally everything I had tasted incredible... My best friend took me here for my birthday and we had such an amazing experience. Our waiter, Tony, was super nice, told everyone that it was my birthday, all the people who worked there were super friendly and it was just lovely. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Uh. No. Never again. Don't do it...I told you so! Chimas alone would beat this place hands down on the salad bar. Never before have I tasted this type of mediocrity. I give it one more year. And even my family shook their heads. So sorry I left the house tonight. Meats were overcooked and dry, salad bar was lacking, and no desserts anywhere on the bar. Chima does it right. Every. Time."}
{"text":"Service is beyond terrible. Not enough staff and way worse than Chima (which is already bad). For the price they charge we would expect a much better service and quality. As a Brazilian myself I would never eat here again. If you want to experience a truly Brazilian rodizio you will have to go to Fogo de Chao. These so called brazilian steak houses are never ran by southern Brazilians and often the taste is tailored to people of central Brazil and they use a lot of garlic to mask the bad meat. Chima does not do that but their service and price are completely incompatible as just like this place."}
{"text":"We've been to this place twice for dinner. My wife and I love this steakhouse. Portions are very consistent and plentiful. Price is very reasonable for what you are getting. There are some Brazilian steakhouses in NY that are better, but for Charlotte this one is tops. Very relaxed atmosphere and it makes for a wonderful dinner date."}
{"text":"Terrible service..... Overpriced     Never again.   Food can't make up for terrible service.   Save your money and visit somewhere like Grapes or Texas Roadhouse"}
{"text":"Great place to eat! Food was good and the staff was helpful and attentive and very kind. The atmosphere was nice and everything was very clean including the bathrooms! I would definitely go here again!"}
{"text":"So, we're in a good part of town and we've been craving a steakhouse. We walk in and are greeting very nicely. The ambiance wasn't great for a steakhouse, but it can be overlooked. Waitstaff did a wonderful job, unfortunately they led us to a salad bar which left a lot to be desired. It had many choices, but they were not seasonal and consisted of canned beets, under ripe tomatoes, slimy shrimp cocktail, and slabs of prosciutto and salamis.  We return from the salad bar, after ordering a $20+ bottle of wine, and turn our 'baton' to green.  Out first offering was chicken wrapped in bacon, that was dry and the bacon was not crispy. The second offering was a filet mignon which could have been the sole of my shoe, and that's disgracing my shoe. The third offering was a pork something, it was very over done and he garlic was excessive.   We then politely asked for the check. A woman came over, and nicely said they were only charging us for the salad bar. We thought that made up for it, and was very nice to notice that we picked at the previous offerings. However, we get our bill and it was $21.95 a person for the salad bar... FOR WHAT?!?!?"}
{"text":"Amor de Brazil is a solid Brazilian steakhouse.  My partner and I checked this place out during restaurant week, which is a heck of a deal.  If you've been to Chima, it's hard not to compare the two places.  However, quite a few things make this place a little different.  Table goodies: They brought fried bananas and cheese bread to the table.  The bananas had a great level of sweetness and the right about of cinnamon to make them perfect.  The cheese bread was surprisingly very cheesy.  Salad bar: This salad bar, while not quite as big as the one at Chima, has a solid selection of goodies to enjoy.  They have several hot and cold seafood dishes, such as mussels, smoked salmon, and a baked fish dish.  They also have a variety of different salads, such as tabbouleh.  My favorite part is definitely the dried meats and cheeses.  They had an apricot ginger cheese the day we went which was FANTASTIC.  They probably had about 10 different cheeses to try and about 6 different styles of dried meat.  I really enjoyed that part.  Meat: I thought the quality of meat here was a little better than Chima.  During restaurant week, you still get to try most of the meat Amor de Brazil offers (unlike Chima, which has a more limited selection).  My personal favorites were somewhat surprising - the bacon-wrapped chicken was tender and flavorful, the sausage was smoky and a little spicy, and the leg of lamb was moist and delicious.  Dessert: Both the passion fruit mousse and flan were delicious.  The flan was a perfectly cooked custard and I loved the caramel that went with it.  The mousse was rich and smooth.  Service here was pretty good, although getting the good meats took a little time.  However, my favorite part about this was that you can tell the server what you are waiting for and (s)he will try to get that meat to your table.  We waited a long time for lamb, but once we asked out server, the lamb made it within a few minutes.  Overall, I am a big fan of this place.  Make sure you come hungry and expect to be uncomfortably full when you leave."}
{"text":"What can I say, I love Amor de Brazil! I've been eating here since 2012.  There has been many changes with the price and the salad bar variety has decrease but the food still delicious. I do wish they could bring back the smoked salmon since it was my favorite thing to eat. Other than that I haven't had any issues with them. I will definitely continue to visit this steakhouse."}
{"text":"Finally had my second visit and I must say....midday Sunday must be the best time to go or the owner's are reading the Yelp reviews. Why? They kept the cheese breads rolling. hot, fast, and dirty (my little pun there)...don't worry everything was clean and everyone was attentive.   ALL day Sundays seem to be the discount day for the Full Rodizio. This nice. Drinks are not included.   3 stars for the location  5 stars for the employees/staff/workers 4 stars for the meat and cold/hot bar options as there could be more but the Chimichurri (I'm sure I misspelled this) is quite flavorful and differs at each place I dine but again a solid *muah* 5 stars for the attention today, 3.5 stars for the previous dining experience attention which brings us to a solid 4.  Ambiance on a Sunday is 3 on a Friday/Saturday night is a 5. Again, average is 4.   All in all, they offer Restaurant Week/GroupOns for 2 or 4 and they are local owners so GO SUPPORT.   FYI: we only consume Med. Well or Well so if you're the same --- just ask.  Kudos for the cheese breads being offered repeatedly and often."}
{"text":"The good:  We came at 5:30pm on a Friday night.  We were asked if we had a reservation (we didn't), but promptly seated.  Water and drink service arrived thereafter which was good. Only 3 other tables at this time as they had just opened at 5pm.  Waiter very attentive, all the way through the end of our stay.  Now mind you, he was the only waiter when we left at 7pm, and by that time there were 11 seated tables. I hope he gets help.   The \"could do better\" Tabletops are very slippery.  Granite/stone tops with no place mats make very slippery surfaces for plates.  Cutting meat was a chore as the plates slid back and forth (more on the meat below).  Floor was sticky where we sat.   No music playing. I could hear other people's conversations about work and complaints about significant others.    The bad:  The FOOD - The taste of sanitizing solution (or maybe soap?) was predominant in 2 of their vegetable dishes (I tried 5). The tomato salad (had to set this one to the side immediately) and the eggplant salad - ordered a Caipirinha. Took a sip and got a mouthful of sugar. Alcohol content slim to none.  Felt like I was drinking tonic water with lime.  Maybe bartender is having an off day (?) - All the beef didn't taste \"clean\".  Tasted rather metallic (excess blood) or beef that wasn't rinsed prior to grilling.  Asked for medium rare and continuously got medium to well done.  - pork ribs was extremely fatty and gamey. Again, I felt like it came straight out of a vacuum sealed bag and straight into the fire.  A little trimming here and there and a rinse would do it justice.  - lamb: rather dry but the salt and garlic helped with the dryness.  - chicken wing: this was good. About the only meat I would have 4 helpings of.   Meat choices limited to how they cook it. Given we arrived as soon as they opened, we were limited to eating overcooked meat since they couldn't shave off the well done portions to give us the medium or med rare portions. This is prob our fault for coming early.   I guess I had higher expectations having been to numerous churrascaria while on vacation and living in other places. I wanted to see if this place was a good alternative to Chima in uptown Charlotte since we live much closer to Amor de Brazil. Sad to say we will have to make the trek uptown after all.   The reason I'm giving this place two stars (instead of 1) is because I know they could do better with the food, we didn't leave upset at anyone and the service was decent.  Overall however, I was quite disappointed."}
{"text":"Love Love this place. took my Boyfriend here for date night and he loved it. The food selection and quality is amazing. the staff is super nice and interact with the customers. great for a romantic dinner and is so much cheaper than chima. will definitely come again."}
{"text":"The dinner group met here this week for something different.  This was our first dinner in the Matthews area.  Besides seating at the table being a bit tight for 8 people, this is a great place.  It works like any other Brazilian steakhouse, you start at the salad bar and then come back and turn over your card when you are ready for the parade of meat.  Some items that stood out to me were the Spicy chicken and the sausage.  I didn't care for the steak but I am not a big steak eater anyway.  On the salad bar, the mango salad was delicious as well as the cooked salmon.  The hostess was very friendly and asked if we had been here before and for all of us it was our first time.  There were comparisons with the group to Chima but I think this place is equivalent to Chima, but just a bit cheaper."}
{"text":"Could've been an off night but based on one evening, not the Brazilian place we'd go back to.  Cold air blowing on us cooling our steak off fast.  Fantastic salad bar; wishing they'd denote foods w gluten in them clearly.  The meat was good not great.  Music was good but way too loud."}
{"text":"Holds its own if you've been to a few rodizio restaurants but not the best I've been to.  Only been twice but its always been good.  One time the Sangria was great and another time I swear I could see powder in it so I'll give it a 2 out of 3 before I stop ordering it.  I'm hoping this place stays and does well though!"}
{"text":"I loved this place...the wait staff acted like they genuinely loved their jobs...the food was very good...the salad/cold bar offered a lot of variety...I was there with a vegetarian and even he loved it!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time on Tuesday night. Have been to Brazilian rodizio before and even here in Charlotte at Chimas many times.   I have to say that I was very impressed. It has a different feel from Chimas. Whereas Chimas has more of a swanky slightly snobby feel to it, Amor de Brazil felt more comfortable. Had an excellent experience including awesome staff, especially Ricky.  I totally recommend this place to others. Had an A+ experience.  So here are my observations... Based on a scale of 1-10.  Food Quality: 9 - I even ate the lamb leg which usually isn't my first choice ) Ambiance: 8 - Its not as swanky as Chimas but it is still upscale enough but not over the top. Cleanliness: 10 Staff Friendliness: 10 Price: 8 - Much cheaper than Chimas Likely to go again: 10   Overall, it was great food and great time. It was well worth the drive from Charlotte."}
{"text":"This place is pretty nice, you have to give it a try, here is why ...  Lots of food in the salad bar, really good selection of cheeses, salads and  side dishes, the seasoned potatoes were the best. The Meats are delicious and you can really fill up with the amount of food there. Great concept, and service is good. Every once in a while you will see a pretty girl  walking around offering a Brazilian featured drink made on the spot at an additional charge, what a great idea, that was new to me.   The only one thing I could suggest to the kid at the host table on the front to not tell the clients to keep the diner time under 2 hours,because they have other reservations...\" I thought that was a bit tacky, the average time is about 2 hours anyway, is it really worth it to make your guests feel rushed from the moment they walk in?  NA !  That little comment cost them a star on my review :( But yes I def recommend this place. Casual and the owners or managers are very warm people, they stopped at our table to make sure  everything was good, on the way out one of us got a surprise embracing hug, to thank us for the visit and ask us to come back... was a bit awkward lol and we got a good laugh about after."}
{"text":"Let's face it - we are all both attracted to and repulsed by the buffet experience at the same time. It's probably the allure of getting a deal by paying a fixed price and making off with more food than we should, while paying as little as possible. Enter the churrascaria - put another way: Lots 'o meat.  Is it authentic? Perhaps. I really can't say. I can say that they are neither the best nor the worst such experience I have ever had, and you are probably likely to find both better and worse places to spend your money to eat (both buffet and non-buffet alike).  First, if you're going for dinner, you may not want to eat lunch beforehand. Perhaps for several days. It's a lot of food, mostly meat. While there is a salad bar, let's face it - no one goes to a place specializing in meat, delivered to your table and gets a salad bar. It doesn't make sense on any level.  While the salad bar isn't bad, you're simply wasting your money by filling up your gut on salad, so even though it's not bad, skip it and eat your fill of meat. If you absolutely must have salad, try the lunch instead. You can then have the salad and a smaller sampling of the meats, at a lower price.  For dinner, you get the full array of meats - unless you go for restaurant week, where they do a section between lunch and the full spread - so that's going to be full price. And those meats are brought around on these long skewers. The servers are supposed to look at the card on your table, and if the card is green, offer you food, and if the card is red, they keep going. In reality, the card doesn't matter much.  If you get their attention, they will serve you, and that is the real problem - you can generally get it, but only at certain times, and you will find that if you want to try everything they offer, it takes a very long time. Everyone wants to try everything on the menu, and so when a new skewer comes out, the meat is rapidly gone, so it takes a while for the variety to make its way around the room - you then have to put in a request. As a result, the most common meats are the ones you see most frequently. I suspect these are the cheapest (understandably - that way they make the most money), and so you have to decide if it's worth $30+ on dinner. Generally it's a losing proposition, as you get increasingly frustrated because the more interesting items are never making their way to you.  Still, if you've never been, it's worth a trip - probably not worth multiple trips, however."}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times since they opened, as I usually make it a point to eat here when I visit my family in the area.  On my first visit, I was very impressed by the service (friendly, attentive, caipirinhas were made tableside, etc), quality of the salad bar and meats, and the value (it was $29.95 at the time I believe).  As time has progressed, it has crept up in price ($33.95) and there has been a subtle but steady decline in the level of service and quality of meats (also no more tableside caipirinhas).  The most recent experience was this past Sunday, where they had an Easter special going on all day for $29.95. At that price (compared to Chima), I decided to make last minute dinner reservations to treat my Mother for the day.  We were seated promptly, there was a live band playing, and water was brought quickly. However, the side dishes took a good ten to fifteen minutes after we started eating to arrive to the table. The salad bar still maintains a high level of quality and offerings. I refuse to load up on the hot/cold bar offerings when visiting these types of restaurants in the US as the experience really is all about the meat, but the sauteed mushrooms in sherry sauce were absolutely divine.  The meat was very slow to arrive, and the same three or four offerings kept rotating about (coxa de frango, frango com bacon, garlic sirloin, and linguiça). We had to specifically request the picanha and cordeiro, filet com bacon and maminha were offered only once, and there was a grilled pineapple making the rotations, but we were never offered any. There was no lombo de porco, and alcatra did not start circulating until we were leaving. Overall, the meats were of decent quality but severely lacked any flavour or seasoning (i.e. sea salt).  Service was acceptable, but certainly not as friendly as it used to be. The \"gauchos***\" weren't all that friendly and contrary to previous visits, no one stopped by to chat or see how things were going. The hostess did have a brief conversation with me early on, but only because she is originally from São Paulo and was excited to meet someone else who lives there.  I had recently read that this location was under new management. I'm not sure if this is entirely true as the manager with whom I had interacted on previous visits (including my first visit shortly after they opened) was still working there. However, unlike previous visits, she neither remembered me nor cared. Not once did management stop by our table to say hello or ask if things were enjoyable.  Overall, for the price, this remains a great value for the Charlotte area, especially if you are seeking the full service rodizio environment. However, as noted the level of service has definitely declined and is lacking. Hopefully management will read these reviews and bring the restaurant back to the standard it once was.   ***Gauchos are essentially \"Cowboys\" and hail from Southern Brazil, Uruguay, and Argentina. In my experience in the US, \"Gauchos\" are rarely from this region, and if they are Brazilian, they hail from the Norte, Nordeste, Centro-Oeste, ou Sudeste"}
{"text":"Want to now how to go to a Brazilian Churrascaria and leave hungry? Easy: go eat here.   I've been sitting at this restaurant for 50 minutes and have seen meat exactly 3 times. Sell you another beer? Certainly!.  Want another glass of ice cold water? Surely! Bananas? But,of course! Barbecued pineapple? Why, sure! Actual churrasco is, sadly, harder to come by because when it does, it is pretty good. I want to be clear: the issue here is not the quality of the product, but the speed of its supply.  Someone should organize the serving properly: the servers ALWAYS start at the front  of the room; Brazilian churrasco comes on a stick, which means there is a limited supply on each turn. Guess what happens with those of us seating at the back? We either get nothing or the center, which is going to be rare. If you, like me, do not like your beef while it still mooing, you're out of luck. Note to management: tell your people to start serving **where they left off** not again with the people in the front,  who are already stuffed with every turn you gave them what should have be my food, too.  I wrote this whole thing on my phone while waiting to be served. When do you have time to even breath between servings in a Churrascaria? That's right: pretty much never. Unless, of course, you eat here tonight.  This is a two-star review instead of one  because the food is pretty good, the ambiance is great and the people are really nice. I hope they get the service mess resolved."}
{"text":"Tried to call ahead to set up a reservation and could not get through. Once I got there the hostesses told me that \"3 people were working the phones today taking reservations\" yet no one answered. I was turned away and told that I couldn't sit at the bar and be served food. I would not recommend this place to anyone. I was only coming here to use a groupon."}
{"text":"We went as a party of 5 on Friday evening. The place was at half capacity with a full staff so we should be seeing those meats coming by the table left and right, right? NOPE. All night it was slow service, we even inquired where the rare lamb skewer was? oh its coming sir....well no not really, its not.....The coffee was terrible. The dessert proportions were small for 5 bucks, Oh and ALL the meats - every one I tried - was way over salted, OK, lets leave them on a positive note - the salad bar while small was well stocked with great choices, quality food here at the salad bar.  My bill for dinner dessert and a soft drink with gratuity was 48 bucks. And NO I did not just have a meal worth 48 bucks.....(and yes I have been to 3 or 4 other Brazilian style steakhouses before this one)"}
{"text":"So I really don't understand why it takes over thirty minutes for these guys to bring any sort of food.  It's like, if I wanted to just eat salad I would have paid for the salad bar ONLY!!  Definitely not coming back to this place!! They are slow and stingy on serving the meat!!  Do they think I came for bread and salad??  NO!! I came to taste their meat and how well they cook their food!!!!  NOT COMING BACK TO THIS PLACE EVEE AGAIN!!!"}
{"text":"Good for Gluten Free diners too! Salad bar is huge and not just salads. Cheenies GF bread served at table."}
{"text":"Wife and I went for dinner the other evening. The place was clean and spacious. We were greeted at the door and seated promptly. The greeter made sure to explain the process and bought a wine list and invited us to begin. The service was a bit disorganized. A number of people were milling about but no one came to introduce themselves as our server until about 10 min after sitting down. The 'salad bar' was good. Lots of options for any pallet, but would have liked to see more fresh fruit options. Then came the meats... There was a good selection, well seasoned and most beef options were med rare as I like them. The chicken and sausage were also good. Service could use a bit of polish, but all in all a good dining experience."}
{"text":"We love this place and always enjoy ourselves and the food. Wait staff are great! If you ever wanted to try a Brazilian steak place, you have to experience one, and this place is great! Tip: save room for the grilled pineapple!"}
{"text":"Service and food was great. The salad bar had a huge variety of quality food. Clean and great ambiance. The only negative is that the bill included an 18% gratuity but the server never mentioned it - easy to overlook. Would have been better if he told us a gratuity was included,"}
{"text":"With the GROUPON this place has excellent value.   Otherwise, I'd score them a 2-2.5 on the Brazilian scale with Fogo scoring a 5.   There is an abundance of good food.  But the experience is overall lacking.   Go with Groupon or don't go.  You will be disappointed at full price."}
{"text":"This is a review of the lunch buffet. Not many options,  and really not that good.  The ppl are friendly though. Maybe dinner is better"}
{"text":"Love this place!!!  We keep coming back and love it every time!  I saw the review from yesterday about the person waiting 1/2 hour for them to start serving meat, but that was not our experience at all. We were the first customers here right at 5 today. We had our drink order taken immediately and went right up to the \"salad bar\" that had much much more than salad. By the time we got back to the table, our drinks were there.   They came to our table and said 5 minutes till the meet will be served. And that was the case. It was perfect.   My daughter loves the salmon on the salad bar. That is the main thing she eats, besides the roasted pineapple.  Both of which she calls her favorite. My favorites this time were the beef and yucca soup, flank steak, tritip steak, and the filet. Soooooo delicious!  My son loves the multiple chicken choices and my husband loves all the steak and sausage. The lamb was also very good.  The service was spot on. This time we came for my birthday and I could not have been more pleased with my bday dinner. :). Highly recommend!!! Come hungry!!!"}
{"text":"Amor de Brazil is definitely cheaper than Chima. However, they don't have many options with their meats compares to Chima. Though, they do have a really nice salad bar that consisted all kinds of cheeses ( you have to try the goat cheese and the wine cheese, they're awesome!).  The decor was fairly nice, not too extravagance. Services was okay, the waiters and waitresses was attentive. Uno problemo, when they were ringing me up, I noticed that they charged me 10% tax which I believe supposed to be 7.52% or somewhere around there tax. I'm not a cheapskate but I didn't feel like it was fair when they are charging a inaccurate tax on all of their clients in-order to gain extra profits. When I addressed this issue, no one, and I mean no one, knew the answer. All they said was they will correct it (which I hope they did).  Other than that issue, I'm quite satisfied with the restaurant."}
{"text":"We went a little later in the day, so the meat was a bit dry after sitting in the flaming pans for too long. Nevertheless meat was good. I managed to pick out the juicier pieces. Definitely dig the buffet set up."}
{"text":"We were there Monday and left pleasantly stuffed!  Service was great and the salad bar was awesome!  The garlic baby steak was phenomenal.  The lamb had to be by far my favorite meat choice.  As a tip I suggest sitting in the corner table by the kitchen... We got first choice on everything that came out!  We will definitely be back... Probably sooner than later!"}
{"text":"I was truly disappointed in my experience here. I had purchased a groupon that made it somewhat affordable to give this place a try and made a reservation as was suggested. We arrived and waited over 10 minutes before a hostess ever came to greet us, and finally were seated in the middle of the restaurant, which you may assume to be a good seat...wrong! We constantly had to flag down the servers with the meat, because they would completely bypass our area.   Personally I thought the food needed seasoning and flavor. I guess if you like seasoned-less meat then this is the place for you. The salad bar did have quite a bit of a selection, but I wasn't impressed with the taste/quality of the food.   I have heard of other brazillian steak houses in the Charlotte area, so my advice would be to choose one of the other two and don't waste your money here."}
{"text":"I gave this place another try after a day at Costco. Never again, first off the meat was not ready when we arrived. Even after requesting medium cooked meats we received over done or raw. The only thing I liked was the cheese popovers, but 36$ to eat just popovers. Luckily we received 50% off one of the meals.  My husband and both didn't feel well after eating here, in about an hour it was not a pretty site. Sick doesn't even begin to describe us and it had to be this place because that is the only thing we ate that day. I would recommend staying away from this place. If you can afford it Chima is good, but if your at the beach Rioz is the bomb!"}
{"text":"We tried out this place because we love the Brazilian Steak Houses. This one was fair. Food was VERY slow coming out,  kept trying to give us lamb and sausage instead of the sirloin.  The mashed potatoes on the bar tasted like they came from a box. The salad were so-so.   The web advertised a Sunday Special of $26.95. Well not the Sunday we went. We were told that it was $30 because it was restaurant week...,.  Hmmmmm. Pay more?  I will stick with Chima,"}
{"text":"Ohh my this was an absolute treat. It's well worth the search to find. Right across the parking lot from jimmy johns. Amazing lunch buffet steak chicken mashed potatoes and sticky rice. I'll be coming back to try dinner. Ohh and they have a full bar."}
{"text":"Came here for restaurant week and was really impressed. It was beyond crowded and we ended up waiting two hours for a table, but hey, it was restaurant week!  Once we got to our table, the service was fast and the buffet was plentiful and had a great variety of choices. The meat was also cooked to perfection. I'd definitely come here again."}
{"text":"On 6/16 I booked a reservation for 7:30  7/1, our 4th wedding anniversary. We arrived at the restaurant at 7pm, only to find that the restaurant was closed. No sign in the window to indicate why they were closed (vacation? power outage?), just a locked door and a dark restaurant. I tried calling from the parking lot but it went to a generic voice mail, and I haven't heard anything in response to the message I left. I received no call or email stating that they weren't accepting reservations or that they'd be closed, no word whatsoever. As a result, the special dinner we'd planned to celebrate our anniversary as well as a new job and a promotion was ruined by the lack of professionalism of those running this restaurant. We'd eaten here once previously and enjoyed it, but will not bother to again in he future, since they can't be counted on to inform patrons of changes in plans or to honor reservations."}
{"text":"We went on a Saturday about 6 PM and it was an average crowd. The Service was great. The servers came out in a timely manner. The food was excellent. I believe the price was fair for the quality and amount of food we ate. The salad bar was OK, however I didn't go there for the salad it was for the proteins."}
