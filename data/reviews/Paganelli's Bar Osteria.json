{"text":"Great little gem.  Clean fresh food.l had the wild boar stew.  Nice twist on stew.  My wife had the best pasta AL vodka.   Nutella pizza was the best desert  ever.  The only complaint I have is the  pizza was nothing special.  It was the sauce.  No punch to the pizza sauce."}
{"text":"Went for dinner a couple weeks ago. Ordered calamari and a salad. Average tasting. For dinner had a pizza and gnocchi with mushrooms. Pizza was good but I wouldn't order the gnocchi again. Service was good."}
{"text":"Paganelli's has a lot going for it in Brampton. Its a nice Italian place, table cloth dinning, and a diverse menu; all together is hard to find in one place in Bolton. But with all of these good points, I want to want Paganelli's more. 

We came here for lunch and was surprised to find all dinner menu items available for lunch, just at a discounted price of 20% off. No lunch or daily specials. After coming here a few times I would stick to the pasta dishes. They have a pasta with wild boar that provides a filling lunch. My complaint about the pasta dishes is that if you are not Italian and well versed in all the various types of pasta and cheeses you will be whipping out your phone and looking up the dishes or just roll the dice with something that sounds nice. 

The salad was a bit disappointing; the dressing and tomatoes lacked flavor, and the grilled chicken was just heated up and had no grill marks. 

Paganelli's is OK, and if I had to bring business clients out to a nicer lunch or dinner I would pick this place. I would also pretty exclusively stick to pasta here, which they seem to do well in if you can understand the menu."}
{"text":"This place is a gem - great home made forced meats, clean simple food and great service. By far my favourite spot in Bolton."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant twice now. The  food is good. The sit down is probably the nicest in Bolton. Nothing terribly wrong with this place, but there is one thing that gets under my skin: the lunch menu is the dinner menu, minus 20%.

I don't get this concept. Why should the food be cheaper just because I ate it earlier? It just comes off as lazy. This isn't some hole-in-the wall joint that's trying to appeal to high schoolers, it's a real restaurant. The other thing is that dinner food shouldn't be lunch food. Dinner is usually heavier and people have more time to eat it. Lunch should be quick, executive, satisfying but light. There's room to create some great, simple, fresh options for lunch that would draw in a crowd. Maybe 6 items at $12 each? No more of this dinner menu minus 20% stuff.

Lunch is lunch. Dinner is dinner."}
{"text":"Nice place.  The standard fried calamari app was way better than you'll get most places: it was actually calamari and shrimp and veggies, perfectly coated and cooked, and a large plate of it.  The pizza is very thin crust, but then it's around 14\" across so it's still filling.  Pasta was good.  Caesar was fine, not exceptional, big enough to share.

I'll be back to try the risotto some day."}
